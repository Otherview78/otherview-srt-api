1
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:18,942
Sméagol!

2
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:20,444
I've got one!

3
00:01:22,154 --> 00:01:23,989
I've got a fish, sméag. Sméagol!

4
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:27,284
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

5
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,336
Smeagol: Déagol!

6
00:02:34,726 --> 00:02:36,561
Smeagol: Déagol?

7
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:41,358
Déagol.

8
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:59,251
Give us that, déagol, my love.

9
00:03:04,214 --> 00:03:05,507
Why?

10
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:08,844
Because...

11
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,764
It's my birthday and I wants it.

12
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:52,072
My precious.

13
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:02,541
Gollum: They cursed us.

14
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:04,084
Murderer.

15
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:06,711
"Murderer” they called us.

16
00:05:06,878 --> 00:05:11,675
They cursed us
and drove us away.

17
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:14,511
Gollum.

18
00:05:14,678 --> 00:05:16,388
Gollum.

19
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:18,390
Gollum.

20
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,063
And we wept, precious.

21
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,817
We wept to be so alone.

22
00:05:31,403 --> 00:05:35,198
And cool so nice for feet

23
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,579
and we only wish to catch a fish

24
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:43,999
so juicy sweet

25
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:53,884
And we forgot the taste of bread...

26
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,679
The sound of trees...

27
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:01,766
The softness of the wind.

28
00:06:02,392 --> 00:06:08,064
We even forgot our own name.

29
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:22,621
My precious.

30
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:09,125
Wake up!

31
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:11,836
Wake up!

32
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:13,797
Wake up, sleepies.

33
00:07:13,964 --> 00:07:15,840
We must go, yes.

34
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:18,677
We must go at once.

35
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:25,308
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,063
I've gone and had too much.

37
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,191
Must be getting late.

38
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:34,859
Frodo:

39
00:07:35,026 --> 00:07:36,945
It isn't.

40
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:40,156
It isn't midday yet.

41
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:42,409
The days are growing darker.

42
00:07:47,163 --> 00:07:49,374
Come on!

43
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:54,045
Must go! No time!

44
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:56,589
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

45
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:59,634
Gollum: No time to lose, silly.

46
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:09,686
Sam: Here.

47
00:08:12,897 --> 00:08:14,733
What about you?

48
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:18,278
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for iembas bread.

49
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:24,367
All right.

50
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:27,037
We don't have that much left.

51
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:30,081
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

52
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,170
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

53
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:36,755
I've rationed it.

54
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:38,923
There should be enough.

55
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:42,302
For what?

56
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,722
The journey home.

57
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:55,899
Gollum: Come, hobbitses.

58
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,152
Very close now.

59
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:02,572
Very close to mordor.

60
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:05,408
No safe places here.

61
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:07,744
Hurry.

62
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,840
Merry: It's good.

63
00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:04,509
Definitely from the shire.

64
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,847
Longbottom leaf.

65
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:18,523
I feel like I'm back at
the green dragon.

66
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:22,861
- Mmm. Green dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

67
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:27,615
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

68
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:31,661
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

69
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:47,510
Welcome, my lords...

70
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:49,929
To isengard!

71
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:54,058
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

72
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:59,230
And now we find you feasting
and... and smoking!

73
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:02,609
We are sitting on a field of victory...

74
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:06,237
Enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

75
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:11,159
The salted pork is particularly good.

76
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:14,078
Salted pork?

77
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:18,708
- Huh. Hobbits.
- We're under orders from treebeard...

78
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,711
Who's taken over management
of isengard.

79
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:27,258
Treebeard: Young master Gandalf.

80
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:32,013
I'm glad you've come.

81
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,601
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

82
00:11:36,768 --> 00:11:40,438
But there is a wizard to manage here...

83
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:42,607
Locked in his tower.

84
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:46,611
Show yourself.

85
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:48,571
Be careful.

86
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:51,991
Even in defeat, saruman is dangerous.

87
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:54,244
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

88
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:59,165
We need him alive.

89
00:12:04,587 --> 00:12:08,841
Saruman: You have fought many wars
and slain many men, théoden king...

90
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:10,510
And made peace aftennards.

91
00:12:10,677 --> 00:12:15,598
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

92
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:19,018
Can we not have peace, you and I?

93
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:21,062
We shall have peace.

94
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:25,108
We shall have peace...

95
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:29,362
When you answer
for the burning of the westfold...

96
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:37,203
We shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers...

97
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,414
Whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

98
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,126
Against the gates of the hornburg,
are avenged!

99
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:50,258
When you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows...

100
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:53,428
We shall have peace.

101
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:58,891
Gibbets and crows?

102
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:04,772
What do you want, Gandalf greyhame?

103
00:13:05,773 --> 00:13:08,276
Let me guess. The key of orthanc.

104
00:13:08,443 --> 00:13:11,404
Or perhaps the keys of barad-dur itself...

105
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:15,575
Along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the five wizards!

106
00:13:15,742 --> 00:13:18,661
Your treachery has already cost
many lives.

107
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,247
Thousands more are now at risk.

108
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:23,750
But you could save them, saruman.

109
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,252
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

110
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:29,672
So you have come here for information.

111
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,425
I have some for you.

112
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:40,808
Something festers
in the heart of middle-earth.

113
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:43,269
Something that you have failed to see.

114
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:49,275
But the great eye has seen it.

115
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:53,988
Even now he presses his advantage.

116
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:59,118
His attack will come soon.

117
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:03,456
You're all going to die.

118
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,170
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

119
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:13,966
You cannot think that this ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of gondor.

120
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:20,223
This exile, crept from the shadows,
will never be crowned king.

121
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:25,228
Gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him...

122
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:28,356
Those he professes to love.

123
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,986
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the halfling...

124
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:36,531
Before you sent him to his doom?

125
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:44,330
The path that you have set him on
can only lead to death.

126
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:46,833
I've heard enough!

127
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,835
Shoot him.
Stick an arrow in his gob.

128
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:51,003
Gandalf: No.

129
00:14:51,462 --> 00:14:53,673
Come down, saruman...

130
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,760
- And your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

131
00:14:57,969 --> 00:14:59,262
I have no use for it!

132
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:10,022
Gandalf: Saruman...

133
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:13,025
Your staff is broken.

134
00:15:25,037 --> 00:15:28,541
Grima, you need not follow him.

135
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:32,378
You were not always as you are now.

136
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:35,381
You were once a man of Rohan.

137
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:36,757
Come down.

138
00:15:36,924 --> 00:15:39,635
A man of Rohan?

139
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:42,805
What is the house of Rohan...

140
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:46,642
But a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek...

141
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:50,563
And their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs?

142
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:57,528
The victory at helm's deep does not
belong to you, théoden horse-master.

143
00:15:58,112 --> 00:16:02,742
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

144
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:06,746
Grima...

145
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,457
Come down.

146
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,250
Be free of him.

147
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:15,421
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

148
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:18,424
Get down, cur!

149
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:21,427
Saruman!

150
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:24,263
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

151
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:26,933
Tell us what you know!

152
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:33,648
You withdraw your guard, and I will
tell you where your doom will be decided.

153
00:16:33,814 --> 00:16:36,776
I will not be held prisoner here.

154
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:06,097
Send word to all our allies...

155
00:17:06,264 --> 00:17:09,141
And to every corner of middle-earth
that still stands free.

156
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:12,812
The enemy moves against us.
We need to know where he will strike.

157
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:35,918
The filth of saruman...

158
00:17:36,127 --> 00:17:39,922
Is washing away.

159
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:44,677
Trees will come back to live here.

160
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:47,346
Young trees.

161
00:17:47,513 --> 00:17:49,682
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

162
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:01,360
Bless my bark!

163
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,362
Gandalf: Peregrin took!

164
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:06,198
I'll take that, my lad.

165
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:08,200
Quickly, now.

166
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:03,964
Theoden: Tonight we remember those who
gave their blood to defend this country.

167
00:19:04,632 --> 00:19:06,676
Hail the victorious dead.

168
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:08,260
All: Hail!

169
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,148
No pauses.

170
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:25,486
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

171
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:27,655
So it's a drinking game?

172
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:31,826
Last one standing wins.

173
00:19:36,163 --> 00:19:38,332
Man: What'll we drink
to? Let's drink to victory!

174
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:39,834
Men: To victory!

175
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:25,504
Theoden: I am happy for you.

176
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:28,299
He is an honorable man.

177
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:31,177
You are both honorable men.

178
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:38,350
It was not théoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

179
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:48,360
Ah, don't listen to me.

180
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:50,696
You are young.

181
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:53,199
And tonight is for you.

182
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:09,215
Here, here.

183
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:16,597
It's the dwarves that go swimming
with little, hairy women.

184
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:23,229
I feel something.

185
00:21:25,397 --> 00:21:27,900
A slight tingle in my fingers.

186
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,152
I think it's affecting me.

187
00:21:32,071 --> 00:21:33,781
What did I say?

188
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:37,284
He can't hold his liquor.

189
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,960
Game over.

190
00:21:46,126 --> 00:21:48,504
Merry & pippin:
Oh, you can search far and wide

191
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:50,130
you can drink the whole town dry

192
00:21:50,297 --> 00:21:53,676
but you'll never find a beer so brown
but you'll never find a beer so brown

193
00:21:53,884 --> 00:21:58,264
as the one we drink in our hometown
as the one we drink in our hometown

194
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,309
you can drink your fancy ales
you can drink 'em by the flagon

195
00:22:02,476 --> 00:22:05,646
but the only brew for the brave and true

196
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:09,608
pippin!

197
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:13,112
Merry & pippin:
But the only brew for the brave and true

198
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:15,489
comes from the green dragon

199
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:21,662
Merry: Thank you! I win!

200
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:25,958
No news of Frodo?

201
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:29,628
No word. Nothing.

202
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:32,631
We have time.

203
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:37,428
Every day, Frodo moves closer to mordor.

204
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:40,222
Do we know that?

205
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:45,811
What does your heart tell you?

206
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:56,155
That Frodo is alive.

207
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:04,705
Yes, he's alive.

208
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:10,002
Gollum: Too risky. Too risky.

209
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:11,378
Thieves.

210
00:23:11,545 --> 00:23:13,589
They stole it from us.

211
00:23:18,594 --> 00:23:22,181
Shh! Ouiet! Mustn't wake them.

212
00:23:22,348 --> 00:23:24,850
Mustn't ruin it now.

213
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:27,102
But they knows.

214
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:29,188
They knows.

215
00:23:29,355 --> 00:23:31,982
They suspects us.

216
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:36,695
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

217
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:40,491
Is sméagol losing his nerve?

218
00:23:41,116 --> 00:23:43,535
No. Not.

219
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:47,915
Never. Sméagol hates nasty hobbitses.

220
00:23:48,082 --> 00:23:52,920
Sméagol wants to see them dead.

221
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:55,631
And we will.

222
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:59,885
Sméagol did it once.
He can do it again.

223
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:05,891
It's ours!

224
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:08,727
Ours!

225
00:24:09,812 --> 00:24:12,731
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

226
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:16,276
Patience! Patience, my love.

227
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:20,823
First we must lead them to her.

228
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,745
We lead them to the winding stair.

229
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:29,581
Yes, the stairs. And then?

230
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:32,751
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

231
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:39,299
Until we come to the tunnel.

232
00:24:39,675 --> 00:24:42,803
And when they go in...

233
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,764
There's no coming out.

234
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:49,601
She's always hungry.

235
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:54,523
She always needs to feed.

236
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,108
She must eat.

237
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:58,444
All she gets is filthy orcses.

238
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,321
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

239
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:08,454
Not very nice at all, my love.

240
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,457
She hungers for sweeter meats.

241
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:13,459
Hobbit meat.

242
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:18,464
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

243
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,675
Then we will find it.

244
00:25:21,842 --> 00:25:26,180
And take it for me!

245
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:29,349
For us.

246
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,853
Yes. We meant "for us."

247
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,482
Gollum. Gollum.

248
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:41,153
The precious will be ours...

249
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,824
Once the hobbitses are dead!

250
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:47,826
You treacherous little toad!

251
00:25:50,496 --> 00:25:52,831
No! No! Master!

252
00:25:52,998 --> 00:25:54,625
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

253
00:25:55,501 --> 00:25:58,170
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

254
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:02,508
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

255
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,553
He's a horrid, fat hobbit...

256
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,347
Who hates sméagol...

257
00:26:08,514 --> 00:26:11,266
And who makes up nasty lies.

258
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:14,144
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

259
00:26:16,188 --> 00:26:17,731
Sam:
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

260
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:23,362
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

261
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:26,698
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

262
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:28,367
Sam: You don't see it, do you?

263
00:26:28,742 --> 00:26:30,202
He's a villain.

264
00:26:31,203 --> 00:26:34,790
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

265
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:38,544
I need you on my side.

266
00:26:39,294 --> 00:26:41,672
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

267
00:26:43,173 --> 00:26:46,093
I know, Sam. I know.

268
00:26:46,677 --> 00:26:48,637
Trust me.

269
00:26:48,804 --> 00:26:51,223
Come, sméagol.

270
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:00,626
What time is it?

271
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:04,463
Not yet dawn.

272
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:14,389
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

273
00:28:14,556 --> 00:28:18,560
Climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

274
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:22,314
I stood upon the brink.

275
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,360
It was utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet.

276
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,073
A light shone behind me...

277
00:28:31,698 --> 00:28:34,159
But I could not turn.

278
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:37,704
I could only stand there, waiting.

279
00:28:39,164 --> 00:28:41,875
Night changes many thoughts.

280
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:44,419
Sleep, eowyn.

281
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:47,214
Sleep...

282
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:51,843
While you can.

283
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:18,245
The stars are veiled.

284
00:29:19,246 --> 00:29:22,749
Something stirs in the east.

285
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:26,545
A sleepless malice.

286
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,425
The eye of the enemy is moving.

287
00:29:44,855 --> 00:29:47,566
Merry: What are you doing?

288
00:29:52,195 --> 00:29:53,655
Merry: Pippin!

289
00:30:01,163 --> 00:30:02,914
Pippin?

290
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:17,095
Pippin.

291
00:30:17,763 --> 00:30:20,432
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

292
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,683
Just one more time.

293
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:24,019
Merry: Put it back.

294
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:36,114
Pippin.

295
00:30:49,252 --> 00:30:50,545
Pippin.

296
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,050
He is here.

297
00:30:55,217 --> 00:30:57,511
Sau Ron: I see you.

298
00:31:00,514 --> 00:31:02,140
Pippin!

299
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,533
Merry: Help! Gandalf, help!

300
00:31:21,284 --> 00:31:23,161
Someone help him!

301
00:31:29,543 --> 00:31:30,752
Pippin!

302
00:31:31,878 --> 00:31:33,130
Fool of a took!

303
00:31:54,234 --> 00:31:56,445
Look at me.

304
00:31:58,405 --> 00:32:02,534
Gandalf, forgive me.

305
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:04,578
Gandalf: Look at me.

306
00:32:04,744 --> 00:32:06,580
What did you see?

307
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:12,169
A tree.

308
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:15,005
There was a white tree...

309
00:32:15,172 --> 00:32:16,673
In a courtyard of stone.

310
00:32:19,468 --> 00:32:20,760
It was dead.

311
00:32:24,931 --> 00:32:26,766
The city was burning.

312
00:32:26,933 --> 00:32:30,312
Minas tirith? Is that what you saw?

313
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:33,023
I saw...

314
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:37,777
I saw him.

315
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,033
I could hear his voice in my head.

316
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,619
And what did you tell him?

317
00:32:45,785 --> 00:32:47,621
Speak!

318
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:54,961
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

319
00:32:55,128 --> 00:32:56,588
He hurt me.

320
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:59,216
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the ring?

321
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:05,180
There was no lie in pippin's eyes.

322
00:33:06,014 --> 00:33:08,266
A fool...

323
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,727
But an honest fool he remains.

324
00:33:11,186 --> 00:33:14,731
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the ring.

325
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:18,151
We've been strangely fortunate.

326
00:33:18,318 --> 00:33:22,197
Pippin saw in the palantir
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

327
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:27,077
Sauron moves to strike
the city of minas tirith.

328
00:33:27,661 --> 00:33:31,414
His defeat at helm's deep
showed our enemy one thing.

329
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:33,917
He knows the heir of elendil
has come forth.

330
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:36,211
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

331
00:33:36,378 --> 00:33:40,173
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

332
00:33:40,382 --> 00:33:42,259
Sauron fears this.

333
00:33:42,425 --> 00:33:46,763
He will not risk the peoples of
middle-earth uniting under one banner.

334
00:33:47,931 --> 00:33:50,350
He will raze minas tirith
to the ground...

335
00:33:50,517 --> 00:33:54,020
Before he sees a king
return to the throne of men.

336
00:33:54,187 --> 00:33:58,108
If the beacons of gondor are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

337
00:33:59,025 --> 00:34:01,236
Tell me...

338
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:05,198
Why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

339
00:34:09,077 --> 00:34:10,912
What do we owe gondor?

340
00:34:12,038 --> 00:34:14,082
- I will go.
- No!

341
00:34:14,249 --> 00:34:17,419
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

342
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:23,383
You must come to minas tirith
by another road.

343
00:34:23,925 --> 00:34:28,388
Follow the river.
Look to the black ships.

344
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:31,308
Understand this:

345
00:34:31,474 --> 00:34:35,145
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

346
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:38,732
I ride for minas tirith...

347
00:34:40,984 --> 00:34:43,653
And I won't be going alone.

348
00:34:45,405 --> 00:34:49,075
Of all the inquisitive hobbits,
peregrin took, you are the worst.

349
00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:51,745
Hurry! Hurry!

350
00:34:53,246 --> 00:34:54,664
Where are we going?

351
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:56,082
Why did you look?

352
00:34:56,249 --> 00:34:59,002
Why do you always have to look?

353
00:34:59,169 --> 00:35:02,255
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

354
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:04,132
I'm sorry, all right?

355
00:35:06,217 --> 00:35:09,137
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

356
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:11,848
The enemy thinks you have the ring.

357
00:35:12,015 --> 00:35:15,769
He's going to be looking for you, pip.
They have to get you out of here.

358
00:35:17,187 --> 00:35:19,856
And you...? You're coming with me?

359
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:23,485
Merry?

360
00:35:23,652 --> 00:35:24,944
Come on.

361
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,826
How far is minas tirith?

362
00:35:31,993 --> 00:35:34,621
Three days' ride, as the nazgul flies.

363
00:35:34,788 --> 00:35:38,291
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail.

364
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,502
Here.

365
00:35:40,669 --> 00:35:42,462
Something for the road.

366
00:35:43,338 --> 00:35:45,298
The last of the Longbottom leaf.

367
00:35:45,465 --> 00:35:49,469
I know you've run out.
You smoke too much, pippin.

368
00:35:49,636 --> 00:35:52,138
But... but we'll see each other soon.

369
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:57,977
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

370
00:35:59,854 --> 00:36:02,023
I don't know what's going to happen.

371
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,900
- Merry.
- Run, shadowfax.

372
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:05,527
Show us the meaning of haste.

373
00:36:05,694 --> 00:36:07,612
Merry!

374
00:36:18,081 --> 00:36:19,207
Merry!

375
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:31,177
He's always followed me...

376
00:36:31,845 --> 00:36:33,888
Everywhere I went...

377
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:36,015
Since before we were tweens.

378
00:36:37,183 --> 00:36:41,104
I would get him into
the worst sort of trouble...

379
00:36:41,271 --> 00:36:43,356
But I was always there to get him out.

380
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:47,694
Now he's gone.

381
00:36:49,362 --> 00:36:52,282
Just like Frodo and Sam.

382
00:36:52,907 --> 00:36:55,660
One thing I have learned about hobbits:

383
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:57,495
They're a most Hardy folk.

384
00:36:58,037 --> 00:37:01,750
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a took.

385
00:37:16,222 --> 00:37:18,516
Elrond:
Take her by the safest road.

386
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:21,186
A ship lies anchored
in the grey havens.

387
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:25,231
It waits to carry her across the sea.

388
00:37:25,398 --> 00:37:28,777
The last journey of arwen undomiel.

389
00:38:34,384 --> 00:38:37,470
There is nothing for you here...

390
00:38:37,971 --> 00:38:40,181
Only death.

391
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,773
Elf escort: Lady annen...

392
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:51,609
We cannot delay.

393
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,321
My lady!

394
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:17,343
Arwen: Tell me what you have seen.
Elrond: Annen.

395
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,470
Arwen:
You have the gift of foresight.

396
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:21,431
What did you see?

397
00:39:22,056 --> 00:39:25,393
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

398
00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:28,062
But there is also life.

399
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:34,027
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

400
00:39:34,652 --> 00:39:37,196
Elrond:
That future is almost gone.

401
00:39:37,363 --> 00:39:39,365
But it is not lost.

402
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:44,162
Nothing is certain.

403
00:39:45,872 --> 00:39:48,583
Some things are certain.

404
00:39:52,378 --> 00:39:55,214
If I leave him now...

405
00:39:55,381 --> 00:39:58,009
I will regret it forever.

406
00:39:59,093 --> 00:40:01,429
It is time.

407
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:10,480
Arwen:
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

408
00:40:10,647 --> 00:40:14,067
a light from the shadow shall spring

409
00:40:14,233 --> 00:40:17,528
renewed shall be blade that was broken

410
00:40:24,911 --> 00:40:28,122
The crown/ess again shall be king

411
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:33,920
re-forge the sword.

412
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:11,499
Elrond: Your hands are cold.

413
00:41:14,877 --> 00:41:18,006
The life of the eldar is leaving you.

414
00:41:21,426 --> 00:41:23,344
This was my choice.

415
00:41:25,179 --> 00:41:27,473
Whether by your will or not...

416
00:41:28,808 --> 00:41:33,104
There is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

417
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:23,154
We've just passed
into the realm of gondor.

418
00:42:37,627 --> 00:42:39,962
City of kings.

419
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:13,121
Make way!

420
00:43:42,316 --> 00:43:44,152
It's the tree.

421
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:45,987
Gandalf. Gandalf.

422
00:43:46,154 --> 00:43:48,406
Gandalf:
Yes, the white tree of gondor.

423
00:43:48,573 --> 00:43:50,408
The tree of the king.

424
00:43:50,575 --> 00:43:53,244
Lord denethor, however,
is not king.

425
00:43:53,411 --> 00:43:56,080
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

426
00:43:56,831 --> 00:44:00,376
Now listen carefully.
Lord denethor is Boromir's father.

427
00:44:00,918 --> 00:44:04,714
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

428
00:44:05,173 --> 00:44:08,634
And do not mention Frodo or the ring.

429
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:12,263
And say nothing of aragorn either.

430
00:44:14,098 --> 00:44:17,977
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, peregrin took.

431
00:44:48,132 --> 00:44:54,639
Hail denethor, son of ecthelion,
lord and steward of gondor.

432
00:45:00,144 --> 00:45:04,857
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

433
00:45:05,816 --> 00:45:09,195
Perhaps you come to explain this.

434
00:45:14,825 --> 00:45:19,372
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

435
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:36,847
Boromir died to save us...

436
00:45:37,014 --> 00:45:38,683
My kinsman and me.

437
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:42,353
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

438
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:51,320
I offer you my service, such as it is...

439
00:45:51,862 --> 00:45:53,864
In payment of this debt.

440
00:45:56,033 --> 00:45:59,370
This is my first command to you.

441
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,541
How did you escape
and my son did not...

442
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:06,210
So mighty a man as he was?

443
00:46:06,877 --> 00:46:10,214
The mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow...

444
00:46:10,464 --> 00:46:12,383
And Boromir was pierced by many.

445
00:46:16,512 --> 00:46:18,222
Get up.

446
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:23,019
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

447
00:46:23,477 --> 00:46:25,229
But it is not now.

448
00:46:25,938 --> 00:46:28,149
War is coming.

449
00:46:28,482 --> 00:46:32,903
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

450
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:37,241
With the defense of this city.
Where are gondor's armies?

451
00:46:37,408 --> 00:46:42,288
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

452
00:46:42,455 --> 00:46:46,959
Send word to théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

453
00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:52,089
You think you are wise, mithrandir.

454
00:46:52,256 --> 00:46:55,301
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

455
00:46:57,428 --> 00:47:01,599
Do you think the eyes
of the white tower are blind?

456
00:47:01,766 --> 00:47:04,852
I have seen more than you know.

457
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:08,230
With your left hand you would use me
as a shield against mordor.

458
00:47:08,397 --> 00:47:11,275
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

459
00:47:11,442 --> 00:47:15,154
I know who rides with théoden of Rohan.

460
00:47:15,321 --> 00:47:21,285
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this aragorn, son of arathorn.

461
00:47:21,452 --> 00:47:26,290
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this ranger from the north...

462
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:30,961
Last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

463
00:47:31,128 --> 00:47:36,967
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

464
00:47:37,134 --> 00:47:41,555
The rule of gondor is mine
and no other's.

465
00:47:46,727 --> 00:47:48,521
Gandalf: Come.

466
00:47:56,445 --> 00:47:59,031
All has turned to vain ambition.

467
00:47:59,198 --> 00:48:02,660
He would even use his grief
as a cloak.

468
00:48:05,538 --> 00:48:08,332
A thousand years
this city has stood.

469
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:11,836
Now, at the whim of a madman,
it will fall.

470
00:48:13,045 --> 00:48:15,256
And the white tree,
the tree of the king...

471
00:48:15,423 --> 00:48:16,966
Will never bloom again.

472
00:48:17,133 --> 00:48:18,843
Pippin:
Why are they still guarding it?

473
00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:21,053
Gandalf:
They guard it because they have hope.

474
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,848
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

475
00:48:24,014 --> 00:48:28,769
That a king will come
and this city will be as it once was...

476
00:48:28,936 --> 00:48:31,856
Before it fell into decay.

477
00:48:32,022 --> 00:48:35,276
The old wisdom borne out
of the west was forsaken.

478
00:48:35,443 --> 00:48:39,738
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

479
00:48:39,947 --> 00:48:41,866
And counted the old names
of their descent...

480
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:44,827
Dearer than the names of their sons.

481
00:48:44,994 --> 00:48:50,040
Childless lords sat in aged halls,
musing on heraldry...

482
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:55,546
Or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

483
00:48:55,713 --> 00:48:59,508
And so the people of gondor
fell into ruin.

484
00:49:00,468 --> 00:49:02,803
The line of kings failed.

485
00:49:03,512 --> 00:49:05,890
The white tree withered.

486
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:10,769
The rule of gondor was given over
to lesser men.

487
00:49:21,489 --> 00:49:22,740
Mordor.

488
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,911
Yes, there it lies.

489
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:31,081
This city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow.

490
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:34,752
A storm is coming.

491
00:49:35,419 --> 00:49:38,339
This is not the weather of the world.

492
00:49:38,506 --> 00:49:40,716
This is a device of Sauron's making.

493
00:49:40,883 --> 00:49:44,637
A broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host.

494
00:49:45,221 --> 00:49:47,681
The orcs of mordor
have no love of daylight...

495
00:49:47,848 --> 00:49:49,683
So he covers the face of the sun...

496
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:53,604
To ease their passage
along the road to war.

497
00:49:53,771 --> 00:49:57,066
When the shadow of mordor
reaches this city...

498
00:49:57,775 --> 00:49:59,485
It will begin.

499
00:50:01,153 --> 00:50:02,738
Well...

500
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:07,743
Very impressive.

501
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:10,671
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, peregrin.

502
00:50:10,746 --> 00:50:12,957
There's no leaving this city.

503
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:18,420
Help must come to us.

504
00:50:20,005 --> 00:50:22,675
Sam:
It must be getting near teatime.

505
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:26,554
Leastways, it would be in decent places
where there is still teatime.

506
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,307
We're not in decent places.

507
00:50:35,854 --> 00:50:37,106
Mr. Frodo?

508
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:41,360
What is it?

509
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:46,198
It's just a feeling.

510
00:50:48,617 --> 00:50:50,786
I don't think I'll be coming back.

511
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:57,835
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

512
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,337
That's just morbid thinking.

513
00:51:00,796 --> 00:51:03,257
We're going there and back again...

514
00:51:03,424 --> 00:51:05,718
Just like Mr. Bilbo.

515
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:08,804
You'll see.

516
00:51:16,979 --> 00:51:20,608
Frodo: I think these lands
were once part of the kingdom of gondor.

517
00:51:24,987 --> 00:51:29,033
Long ago, when there was a king.

518
00:51:49,678 --> 00:51:52,514
Mr. Frodo, look.

519
00:51:54,141 --> 00:51:56,894
The king has got a crown again.

520
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:12,284
Come on, hobbits!
Mustn't stop now. This way.

521
00:52:29,134 --> 00:52:33,180
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

522
00:52:33,347 --> 00:52:37,601
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

523
00:52:38,435 --> 00:52:41,689
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

524
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,234
You'll have to do as you're told,
peregrin took.

525
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,782
Ridiculous hobbit.

526
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:55,160
Guard of the citadel.

527
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,505
Thank you.

528
00:53:15,889 --> 00:53:18,142
There's no more stars.

529
00:53:18,642 --> 00:53:19,852
Is it time?

530
00:53:25,399 --> 00:53:27,067
It's so quiet.

531
00:53:28,068 --> 00:53:32,322
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

532
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,368
I don't want to be in a battle...

533
00:53:37,202 --> 00:53:42,166
But waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

534
00:53:45,711 --> 00:53:49,339
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

535
00:53:50,674 --> 00:53:53,802
Gandalf:
There never was much hope.

536
00:53:55,763 --> 00:53:57,514
Just a fool's hope.

537
00:54:03,395 --> 00:54:06,190
Our enemy is ready.

538
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:09,026
His full strength's gathered.

539
00:54:09,193 --> 00:54:12,696
Not only orcs, but men as well.

540
00:54:12,863 --> 00:54:15,908
Legions of haradrim from the south...

541
00:54:16,074 --> 00:54:18,786
Mercenaries from the coast.

542
00:54:18,952 --> 00:54:21,538
All will answer mordor's call.

543
00:54:21,705 --> 00:54:23,248
Man: Come on.

544
00:54:24,374 --> 00:54:27,711
This will be the end of gondor
as we know it.

545
00:54:27,878 --> 00:54:31,256
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

546
00:54:32,216 --> 00:54:36,553
If the river is taken,
if the Garrison at osgiliath falls...

547
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,390
The last defense of this city
will be gone.

548
00:54:40,557 --> 00:54:44,603
But we have the white wizard.
That's got to count for something.

549
00:54:55,781 --> 00:54:59,451
Gandalf: Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

550
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:03,747
The one who will lead
mordor's armies in war.

551
00:55:03,914 --> 00:55:09,086
The one they say no living man can kill.

552
00:55:10,087 --> 00:55:12,256
The witch-king of angmar.

553
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,717
You've met him before.

554
00:55:16,385 --> 00:55:18,971
He stabbed Frodo on weathertop.

555
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:28,230
He is the lord of the nazgul...

556
00:55:28,689 --> 00:55:31,149
The greatest of the nine.

557
00:55:31,316 --> 00:55:34,862
Minas morgul is his lair.

558
00:55:38,407 --> 00:55:41,952
Gollum: The dead city.

559
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:47,332
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

560
00:55:54,548 --> 00:55:56,717
Quick. Quick.

561
00:55:56,884 --> 00:56:00,888
They will see. They will see.

562
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:15,444
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

563
00:56:15,611 --> 00:56:19,489
The way into mordor.

564
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:23,994
The secret stair.

565
00:56:24,411 --> 00:56:26,788
Climb.

566
00:56:47,059 --> 00:56:49,811
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

567
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:57,527
- Gollum: What's it doing?
- No.

568
00:56:57,694 --> 00:57:00,781
They're calling me. Gollum: No.

569
00:57:30,435 --> 00:57:33,397
Gollum: Hide! Hide!

570
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,776
I can feel his blade.

571
00:58:31,455 --> 00:58:33,582
We come to it at last.

572
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:38,295
The great battle of our time.

573
00:59:17,459 --> 00:59:20,712
Come away, hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

574
00:59:30,597 --> 00:59:33,600
The board is set.

575
00:59:33,767 --> 00:59:36,144
The pieces are moving.

576
00:59:38,855 --> 00:59:41,525
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

577
00:59:41,691 --> 00:59:44,361
And then it's into the tunnel.

578
00:59:44,528 --> 00:59:47,739
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

579
00:59:48,281 --> 00:59:51,034
You listen to me,
and you listen good and proper.

580
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:54,121
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

581
00:59:54,287 --> 00:59:55,872
One sniff something's not right...

582
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:59,209
One hair stands up
on the back of my head, it's over.

583
00:59:59,417 --> 01:00:02,087
No more slinker. No more stinker.

584
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:05,048
You're gone. Got it?

585
01:00:05,924 --> 01:00:07,926
I'm watching you.

586
01:00:13,265 --> 01:00:15,267
What was that about?

587
01:00:15,433 --> 01:00:17,853
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

588
01:00:24,484 --> 01:00:27,362
Peregrin took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

589
01:00:27,529 --> 01:00:32,117
Another opportunity for one of the
shire-folk to prove their great worth.

590
01:00:36,955 --> 01:00:38,540
You must not fail me.

591
01:01:12,782 --> 01:01:15,869
Madril:
It's been very quiet across the river.

592
01:01:16,036 --> 01:01:18,371
The orcs are lying low.

593
01:01:18,538 --> 01:01:20,540
The Garrison may have moved out.

594
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:24,377
We've sent scouts to cair andros.

595
01:01:24,544 --> 01:01:26,864
If the orcs attack from the north,
we'll have some warning.

596
01:01:53,156 --> 01:01:54,366
Quiet.

597
01:01:58,453 --> 01:02:00,413
Soldier: We need 10 more.

598
01:02:40,578 --> 01:02:42,998
They're not coming from the north.

599
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:48,753
- To the river. Quick. Quick.
- Go. Come on.

600
01:02:52,215 --> 01:02:53,800
Faster.

601
01:03:06,938 --> 01:03:09,316
Draw swords.

602
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:06,456
Faramir: Hold! Hold them!

603
01:05:26,744 --> 01:05:28,621
What?

604
01:05:41,176 --> 01:05:42,594
Amon din.

605
01:05:48,391 --> 01:05:51,436
Guard: The beacon.
The beacon of amon din is lit.

606
01:05:54,689 --> 01:05:58,902
Hope is kindled.

607
01:07:31,286 --> 01:07:35,665
Aragorn: The beacons of minas tirith!
The beacons are lit!

608
01:07:36,874 --> 01:07:38,501
Gondor calls for aid.

609
01:07:49,012 --> 01:07:51,931
And Rohan will answer.

610
01:07:52,348 --> 01:07:55,143
Muster the rohirrim.

611
01:08:10,241 --> 01:08:12,201
Assemble the army at dunharrow.

612
01:08:12,368 --> 01:08:16,748
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

613
01:08:16,914 --> 01:08:22,211
On the third,
we ride for gondor and war.

614
01:08:22,712 --> 01:08:24,380
Man 1: Fonnard.
Man 2: Very good, sir.

615
01:08:24,547 --> 01:08:25,965
Gamling. Gamling: My lord.

616
01:08:26,132 --> 01:08:27,759
Make haste
across the riddermark.

617
01:08:27,925 --> 01:08:30,053
Summon every able-bodied man
to dunharrow.

618
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:31,804
Gamling: I will.

619
01:08:35,892 --> 01:08:39,062
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

620
01:08:39,228 --> 01:08:43,149
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

621
01:08:49,697 --> 01:08:51,616
The men have found their captain.

622
01:08:51,783 --> 01:08:55,119
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

623
01:08:55,286 --> 01:08:56,871
You have given us hope.

624
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:02,043
Merry: Excuse me.

625
01:09:03,378 --> 01:09:04,879
I have a sword.

626
01:09:05,171 --> 01:09:06,547
Please accept it.

627
01:09:07,674 --> 01:09:12,178
I offer you my service, théoden king.

628
01:09:15,598 --> 01:09:17,684
And gladly I accept it.

629
01:09:18,768 --> 01:09:22,855
You shall be meriadoc,
esquire of Rohan.

630
01:09:27,735 --> 01:09:28,945
Horse-men.

631
01:09:29,612 --> 01:09:35,243
I wish I could muster a legion of dwarves,
fully armed and filthy.

632
01:09:35,618 --> 01:09:38,579
Your kinsmen may have no need
to ride to war.

633
01:09:38,746 --> 01:09:42,166
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

634
01:10:00,643 --> 01:10:04,105
Theoden: So it is before the walls
of minas tirith...

635
01:10:04,272 --> 01:10:08,151
The doom of our time will be decided.

636
01:10:10,737 --> 01:10:16,284
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

637
01:10:16,451 --> 01:10:20,830
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land! Hyah!

638
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,041
Faramir!

639
01:11:11,339 --> 01:11:15,051
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

640
01:11:15,635 --> 01:11:18,721
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for minas tirith.

641
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,732
Nazgul.

642
01:11:32,109 --> 01:11:34,570
Soldier 1: Take cover!

643
01:11:34,737 --> 01:11:37,281
Soldier 2: Nazgul!

644
01:11:56,634 --> 01:12:01,222
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Soldier 3: Run for your lives!

645
01:12:25,454 --> 01:12:29,792
The age of men is over.

646
01:12:29,959 --> 01:12:35,590
The time of the orc has come.

647
01:12:37,967 --> 01:12:40,303
Soldier 1: Keep going.
Soldier 2: It's the nazgul.

648
01:12:41,929 --> 01:12:44,307
Soldier 1: Take cover, my lord!

649
01:12:44,599 --> 01:12:45,933
It's coming!

650
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,859
- Man: It's mithrandir.
- The white rider!

651
01:13:34,815 --> 01:13:36,192
Guard: Pull!

652
01:13:53,918 --> 01:13:56,337
Faramir: Mithrandir.

653
01:13:56,504 --> 01:13:58,255
They broke through our defenses.

654
01:13:58,422 --> 01:14:00,633
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

655
01:14:01,717 --> 01:14:03,719
Battalions of orcs are crossing the river.

656
01:14:03,886 --> 01:14:05,888
Iorlas:
It is as the lord denethor predicted.

657
01:14:06,055 --> 01:14:10,601
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

658
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,399
Faramir?

659
01:14:18,317 --> 01:14:22,154
This is not the first halfling
to have crossed your path.

660
01:14:25,866 --> 01:14:27,410
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

661
01:14:28,285 --> 01:14:31,706
- Where? When?
- In ithilien.

662
01:14:31,872 --> 01:14:33,958
Not two days ago.

663
01:14:34,417 --> 01:14:38,879
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the morgul vale.

664
01:14:39,588 --> 01:14:42,216
And then the pass of cirith ungol.

665
01:14:44,427 --> 01:14:46,804
What does that mean?

666
01:14:46,971 --> 01:14:51,892
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

667
01:14:52,059 --> 01:14:54,103
Tell me all you know.

668
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:58,691
This is how you would serve your city?

669
01:14:58,858 --> 01:15:02,153
You would risk its utter ruin?

670
01:15:03,195 --> 01:15:04,780
I did what I judged to be right.

671
01:15:05,489 --> 01:15:08,492
What you judged to be right.

672
01:15:09,118 --> 01:15:14,999
You sent the ring of power into mordor
in the hands of a witless halfling.

673
01:15:18,961 --> 01:15:23,799
It should have been brought back
to the citadel to be kept safe.

674
01:15:27,386 --> 01:15:30,139
Dark and deep in the vaults...

675
01:15:30,306 --> 01:15:32,475
Not to be used.

676
01:15:36,645 --> 01:15:41,525
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

677
01:15:41,984 --> 01:15:44,028
I would not use the ring.

678
01:15:44,195 --> 01:15:47,281
Not if minas tirith were falling in ruin
and I alone could save her.

679
01:15:47,615 --> 01:15:52,453
Ever you desire to appear lordly
and gracious...

680
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:54,872
As a king of old.

681
01:15:56,665 --> 01:16:00,419
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

682
01:16:00,836 --> 01:16:03,297
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

683
01:16:03,506 --> 01:16:06,050
Boromir would not
have brought the ring.

684
01:16:06,467 --> 01:16:09,738
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

685
01:16:09,762 --> 01:16:12,562
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

686
01:16:13,891 --> 01:16:16,060
And when he returned...

687
01:16:17,186 --> 01:16:18,854
You would not have known your son.

688
01:16:19,021 --> 01:16:21,565
Boromir was loyal to me!

689
01:16:21,732 --> 01:16:24,318
Not some wizard's pupil!

690
01:16:32,451 --> 01:16:33,786
Father?

691
01:16:46,465 --> 01:16:48,384
My son.

692
01:17:14,618 --> 01:17:15,995
Leave me.

693
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:52,114
Gollum:
Careful, master. Careful.

694
01:17:52,448 --> 01:17:55,367
Very far to fall.

695
01:17:57,870 --> 01:18:01,790
Very dangerous are the stairs.

696
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:07,004
Come, master.

697
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:15,971
Come to sméagol.

698
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:23,812
Sam: Mr. Frodo.

699
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:26,357
Get back, you!

700
01:18:26,523 --> 01:18:28,734
Don't touch him!

701
01:18:32,863 --> 01:18:35,699
Why does he hates poor sméagol?

702
01:18:35,866 --> 01:18:39,578
What has sméagol ever done to him?

703
01:18:42,915 --> 01:18:46,377
Master carries heavy burden.

704
01:18:46,543 --> 01:18:51,966
Sméagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

705
01:18:52,132 --> 01:18:55,386
Fat one cannot know.

706
01:18:57,429 --> 01:19:00,182
Sméagol look after master.

707
01:19:01,392 --> 01:19:03,602
He wants it.

708
01:19:03,769 --> 01:19:08,315
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

709
01:19:08,482 --> 01:19:13,946
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

710
01:19:14,113 --> 01:19:17,992
The fat one will take it from you.

711
01:19:25,207 --> 01:19:29,545
Witch-king:
Send forth all legions.

712
01:19:29,712 --> 01:19:33,757
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

713
01:19:34,466 --> 01:19:37,594
Slay them all.

714
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:45,060
- What of the wizard?
- Witch-king: I will break him.

715
01:19:48,397 --> 01:19:50,816
Guard:
Where are théoden's riders?

716
01:19:50,983 --> 01:19:53,569
Will Rohan's army come?

717
01:19:57,031 --> 01:20:00,909
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

718
01:20:05,706 --> 01:20:08,417
Pippin:
What were you thinking, peregrin took?

719
01:20:10,502 --> 01:20:16,216
What service can a hobbit
offer such a great lord of men?

720
01:20:16,383 --> 01:20:17,885
Faramir: It was well-done.

721
01:20:21,055 --> 01:20:25,100
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

722
01:20:25,851 --> 01:20:28,395
You are to join the tower guard.

723
01:20:28,937 --> 01:20:31,940
I didn't think they would find any livery
that would fit me.

724
01:20:32,107 --> 01:20:34,568
Once belonged to a young boy
of the city.

725
01:20:34,735 --> 01:20:36,278
A very foolish one...

726
01:20:36,445 --> 01:20:40,699
Who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

727
01:20:40,866 --> 01:20:43,619
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

728
01:20:43,786 --> 01:20:45,579
My father had it made for me.

729
01:20:46,622 --> 01:20:47,956
Well...

730
01:20:48,123 --> 01:20:50,125
I'm taller than you were then.

731
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:53,629
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore,
except sideways.

732
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:58,634
Never fitted me either.

733
01:20:58,801 --> 01:21:01,637
Boromir was always the soldier.

734
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,059
They were so alike, he and my father.

735
01:21:10,938 --> 01:21:12,147
Stubborn even.

736
01:21:13,899 --> 01:21:15,401
But strong.

737
01:21:16,902 --> 01:21:20,072
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

738
01:21:20,697 --> 01:21:23,158
And one day your father will see it.

739
01:21:27,329 --> 01:21:31,125
Pippin: Here do I swear fealty
and service to gondor...

740
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:32,793
In peace or war...

741
01:21:33,419 --> 01:21:35,879
In living or dying...

742
01:21:37,256 --> 01:21:38,507
From...

743
01:21:41,176 --> 01:21:43,971
From this hour henceforth...

744
01:21:44,138 --> 01:21:46,056
Until my lord release me...

745
01:21:47,558 --> 01:21:49,768
Or death take me.

746
01:21:50,352 --> 01:21:52,855
And I shall not forget it...

747
01:21:53,021 --> 01:21:56,400
Nor fail to reward
that which is given.

748
01:22:03,991 --> 01:22:06,285
Fealty with love.

749
01:22:07,369 --> 01:22:09,037
Valor with honor.

750
01:22:10,622 --> 01:22:13,959
Disloyalty with vengeance.

751
01:22:22,593 --> 01:22:26,680
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

752
01:22:26,847 --> 01:22:29,600
Defenses that your brother
long held intact.

753
01:22:29,766 --> 01:22:32,269
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

754
01:22:32,436 --> 01:22:35,230
The river in pelennor unfought.

755
01:22:35,397 --> 01:22:37,065
Osgiliath must be retaken.

756
01:22:37,232 --> 01:22:39,276
My lord, osgiliath is overrun.

757
01:22:39,943 --> 01:22:42,738
Much must be risked in war.

758
01:22:45,365 --> 01:22:49,328
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

759
01:22:55,542 --> 01:22:58,795
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

760
01:22:59,755 --> 01:23:02,591
That I had died
and Boromir had lived.

761
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:10,641
I wish that.

762
01:23:19,024 --> 01:23:21,527
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

763
01:23:23,362 --> 01:23:26,281
I will do what I can
in his stead.

764
01:23:34,456 --> 01:23:38,919
If I should return,
think better of me, father.

765
01:23:41,004 --> 01:23:44,633
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

766
01:25:07,924 --> 01:25:10,260
Sam: What are you up to?

767
01:25:10,427 --> 01:25:11,678
Sneaking off, are we?

768
01:25:12,387 --> 01:25:14,222
Sneahng?

769
01:25:15,223 --> 01:25:17,392
Sneahng?

770
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:21,980
Fat hobbit is always so polite.

771
01:25:22,147 --> 01:25:27,235
Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

772
01:25:27,402 --> 01:25:29,571
And they say "sneak."

773
01:25:33,408 --> 01:25:36,119
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

774
01:25:36,286 --> 01:25:38,914
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

775
01:25:40,165 --> 01:25:42,376
You just startled me is all.

776
01:25:42,876 --> 01:25:44,711
What were you doing?

777
01:25:46,338 --> 01:25:48,465
Sneamng.

778
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,927
Fine. Have it your own way.

779
01:25:54,179 --> 01:25:56,682
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

780
01:25:57,057 --> 01:25:59,017
We have to be moving on.

781
01:26:05,941 --> 01:26:08,151
It's always dark here.

782
01:26:12,406 --> 01:26:14,324
It's gone!

783
01:26:15,534 --> 01:26:18,412
- The elven bread.
- What?

784
01:26:18,578 --> 01:26:20,038
That's all we have left.

785
01:26:24,126 --> 01:26:26,628
He took it. He must have!

786
01:26:27,129 --> 01:26:30,382
Sméagol?
No, no, not poor sméagol.

787
01:26:30,549 --> 01:26:33,468
Sméagol hates nasty elf bread.

788
01:26:33,635 --> 01:26:36,805
You're a lying rat!
What did you do with it?!

789
01:26:36,972 --> 01:26:38,515
He doesn't eat it.

790
01:26:39,516 --> 01:26:41,852
- He can't have taken it.
- Gollum: Look.

791
01:26:42,894 --> 01:26:44,730
What's this?

792
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:50,736
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

793
01:26:53,947 --> 01:26:58,160
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

794
01:26:58,326 --> 01:27:00,120
That's a filthy lie!

795
01:27:00,287 --> 01:27:02,497
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

796
01:27:02,664 --> 01:27:03,915
Sam! Sam: Call me...

797
01:27:04,082 --> 01:27:05,333
Frodo: Stop it!

798
01:27:08,837 --> 01:27:12,466
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

799
01:27:13,508 --> 01:27:19,055
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... so angry.

800
01:27:19,222 --> 01:27:21,349
Here, just...
Let's just rest a bit.

801
01:27:21,516 --> 01:27:23,602
- I'm all right.
- No.

802
01:27:23,769 --> 01:27:26,855
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

803
01:27:27,022 --> 01:27:29,149
It's that gollum.

804
01:27:29,316 --> 01:27:31,026
It's this place.

805
01:27:31,193 --> 01:27:33,779
It's that thing around your neck.

806
01:27:37,282 --> 01:27:38,575
I could help a bit.

807
01:27:38,742 --> 01:27:41,411
I could carry it for a while.

808
01:27:41,578 --> 01:27:43,330
Carry it for a while.

809
01:27:43,497 --> 01:27:44,977
I could carry it... I could carry it.

810
01:27:45,373 --> 01:27:50,837
Share the load... share the load...
The load... the load.

811
01:27:51,004 --> 01:27:52,214
Get away!

812
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,020
I don't want to keep it.

813
01:27:57,552 --> 01:27:59,554
I just want to help.

814
01:28:04,392 --> 01:28:07,813
He wants it for himself.

815
01:28:07,979 --> 01:28:09,689
Shut up, you!

816
01:28:10,232 --> 01:28:12,067
Go away! Get out of here!

817
01:28:12,234 --> 01:28:14,069
Frodo: No, Sam.

818
01:28:14,236 --> 01:28:15,487
It's you.

819
01:28:19,699 --> 01:28:21,409
I'm sorry, Sam.

820
01:28:23,078 --> 01:28:24,454
But he's a liar.

821
01:28:24,621 --> 01:28:27,290
He's poisoned you against me.

822
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:30,627
You can't help me anymore.

823
01:28:32,587 --> 01:28:34,464
You don't mean that.

824
01:28:36,967 --> 01:28:38,760
Go home.

825
01:29:58,798 --> 01:30:00,592
Gandalf: Faramir!

826
01:30:00,759 --> 01:30:02,677
Faramir!

827
01:30:04,179 --> 01:30:06,222
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

828
01:30:07,390 --> 01:30:09,434
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

829
01:30:10,185 --> 01:30:12,520
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

830
01:30:13,146 --> 01:30:16,066
This is the city of the men of numenor.

831
01:30:16,691 --> 01:30:19,486
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

832
01:30:19,653 --> 01:30:22,864
Her memory, her wisdom.

833
01:30:25,241 --> 01:30:28,662
Your father loves you, faramir.

834
01:30:29,371 --> 01:30:32,374
He will remember it
before the end.

835
01:31:41,985 --> 01:31:43,528
Can you sing, master hobbit?

836
01:31:46,406 --> 01:31:47,907
Well...

837
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:50,076
Yes.

838
01:31:50,785 --> 01:31:54,539
At least, well enough
for my own people.

839
01:31:56,166 --> 01:31:58,585
But we have no songs
for great halls...

840
01:31:59,627 --> 01:32:00,879
And evil times.

841
01:32:01,713 --> 01:32:04,883
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

842
01:32:07,677 --> 01:32:09,095
Come, sing me a song.

843
01:32:20,148 --> 01:32:23,485
Home is behind

844
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:35,663
And there are many paths to tread

845
01:32:37,457 --> 01:32:41,002
through shadow

846
01:32:41,169 --> 01:32:45,340
to the edge of night

847
01:32:47,008 --> 01:32:52,097
until the stars are all alight

848
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:59,437
mist and shadow

849
01:32:59,604 --> 01:33:03,900
cloud and shade

850
01:33:06,277 --> 01:33:09,614
all shall fade

851
01:33:48,528 --> 01:33:51,990
Lead orc: March! March!

852
01:34:00,832 --> 01:34:03,168
Man 1: Make way for the king.

853
01:34:04,669 --> 01:34:06,671
Make way.

854
01:34:09,132 --> 01:34:11,176
Man 2: The king is here.

855
01:34:13,136 --> 01:34:14,762
Man 3: My lord.

856
01:34:16,014 --> 01:34:17,974
Man 4: Hail to you, sire.

857
01:34:18,433 --> 01:34:19,642
Grimbold, how many?

858
01:34:19,809 --> 01:34:22,270
I bring 500 men from the westfold,
my lord.

859
01:34:23,229 --> 01:34:25,899
Fenmarch man: We have 300 more
from fenmarch, théoden king.

860
01:34:27,025 --> 01:34:30,987
- Where are the riders from snowbourn?
- Gamling: None have come, my lord.

861
01:34:48,046 --> 01:34:50,173
Theoden: Six thousand Spears.

862
01:34:51,216 --> 01:34:53,218
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

863
01:34:53,509 --> 01:34:56,888
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of mordor.

864
01:34:59,641 --> 01:35:01,392
More will come.

865
01:35:01,768 --> 01:35:04,729
Every hour lost hastens gondor's defeat.

866
01:35:04,896 --> 01:35:07,482
We have till dawn,
then we must ride.

867
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,295
The horses are restless...

868
01:35:29,462 --> 01:35:30,964
And the men are quiet.

869
01:35:31,422 --> 01:35:34,550
They grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain.

870
01:35:37,011 --> 01:35:38,888
Gimli: That road there...

871
01:35:39,806 --> 01:35:41,891
Where does that lead?

872
01:35:42,642 --> 01:35:46,479
It is the road to the dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

873
01:35:47,188 --> 01:35:50,191
None who venture there ever return.

874
01:35:51,401 --> 01:35:53,278
That mountain is evil.

875
01:36:04,622 --> 01:36:06,708
Man: Hold!

876
01:36:16,217 --> 01:36:18,052
Gimli: Aragorn.

877
01:36:18,803 --> 01:36:20,722
Let's find some food.

878
01:36:39,574 --> 01:36:42,577
A true esquire of Rohan.

879
01:36:46,247 --> 01:36:47,915
I'm ready.

880
01:36:49,834 --> 01:36:51,085
Sorry.

881
01:36:51,252 --> 01:36:53,546
It isn't all that dangerous.

882
01:36:54,047 --> 01:36:56,382
It's not even sharp.

883
01:36:57,050 --> 01:37:00,428
Well, that's no good. You won't kill
many orcs with a blunt blade.

884
01:37:00,595 --> 01:37:02,096
Come on.

885
01:37:06,267 --> 01:37:08,770
To the smithy. Go!

886
01:37:10,271 --> 01:37:12,774
You should not encourage him.

887
01:37:12,982 --> 01:37:15,443
You should not doubt him.

888
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:18,905
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

889
01:37:21,616 --> 01:37:23,201
Why should merry be left behind?

890
01:37:23,368 --> 01:37:25,995
He has as much cause
to go to war as you.

891
01:37:28,122 --> 01:37:31,292
Why can he not fight
for those he loves?

892
01:37:34,587 --> 01:37:37,590
You know as little of war
as that hobbit.

893
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,927
When the fear takes him...

894
01:37:41,094 --> 01:37:46,140
And the blood and the screams
and the horror of battle take hold...

895
01:37:46,516 --> 01:37:48,643
Do you think he would stand and fight?

896
01:37:51,229 --> 01:37:52,814
He would flee.

897
01:37:53,022 --> 01:37:55,066
And he would be right to do so.

898
01:37:57,276 --> 01:38:01,239
War is the province of men, eowyn.

899
01:38:36,858 --> 01:38:40,611
Arwen: I choose a mortal life.

900
01:38:43,531 --> 01:38:46,367
I wish I could've seen him...

901
01:38:47,535 --> 01:38:50,204
One last time.

902
01:39:01,382 --> 01:39:02,842
Man: Sir?

903
01:39:04,677 --> 01:39:07,221
King théoden awaits you, my lord.

904
01:39:28,034 --> 01:39:29,994
I take my leave.

905
01:39:44,634 --> 01:39:45,885
My lord elrond.

906
01:39:46,427 --> 01:39:49,931
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

907
01:39:53,059 --> 01:39:55,061
Annen is dying.

908
01:39:59,857 --> 01:40:03,903
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from mordor.

909
01:40:04,654 --> 01:40:08,032
The light of the evenstar is failing.

910
01:40:08,199 --> 01:40:12,203
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

911
01:40:12,370 --> 01:40:16,123
Annen's life is now tied
to the fate of the ring.

912
01:40:16,874 --> 01:40:19,460
The shadow is upon us, aragorn.

913
01:40:19,794 --> 01:40:21,462
The end has come.

914
01:40:21,879 --> 01:40:24,465
It will not be our end, but his.

915
01:40:25,258 --> 01:40:28,803
You ride to war, but not to victory.

916
01:40:29,804 --> 01:40:33,474
Sauron's armies march on minas tirith,
this you know.

917
01:40:33,683 --> 01:40:38,104
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

918
01:40:38,563 --> 01:40:41,983
A fleet of corsair ships sails
from the south.

919
01:40:42,608 --> 01:40:44,694
They'll be in the city in two days.

920
01:40:45,194 --> 01:40:47,989
You're outnumbered, aragorn.

921
01:40:48,739 --> 01:40:50,825
You need more men.

922
01:40:51,242 --> 01:40:52,994
There are none.

923
01:40:54,745 --> 01:40:58,666
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

924
01:41:07,675 --> 01:41:09,844
Murderers...

925
01:41:10,011 --> 01:41:11,429
Traitors.

926
01:41:13,848 --> 01:41:16,017
You would call upon them to fight?

927
01:41:16,225 --> 01:41:17,810
They believe in nothing.

928
01:41:17,977 --> 01:41:20,104
They answer to no one.

929
01:41:20,271 --> 01:41:23,357
They will answer
to the king of gondor.

930
01:41:30,489 --> 01:41:35,620
Andt'jril, the flame of the west,
forged from the shards of narsil.

931
01:41:49,884 --> 01:41:54,347
Sauron will not have forgotten
the sword of elendil.

932
01:42:08,402 --> 01:42:13,157
The blade that was broken
shall return to minas tirith.

933
01:42:13,324 --> 01:42:15,743
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

934
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:19,789
Can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

935
01:42:21,582 --> 01:42:23,751
Put aside the ranger.

936
01:42:23,918 --> 01:42:27,254
Become who you were born to be.

937
01:42:55,449 --> 01:42:57,118
Why are you doing this?

938
01:42:57,618 --> 01:43:00,830
The war lies to the east.
You cannot leave on the Eve of battle.

939
01:43:03,249 --> 01:43:05,334
You cannot abandon the men.

940
01:43:06,627 --> 01:43:08,212
Eowyn...

941
01:43:08,379 --> 01:43:10,589
We need you here.

942
01:43:11,716 --> 01:43:13,592
Why have you come?

943
01:43:15,261 --> 01:43:17,221
Do you not know?

944
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:29,483
It is but a shadow and a thought
that you love.

945
01:43:33,446 --> 01:43:35,865
I cannot give you what you seek.

946
01:43:49,378 --> 01:43:53,299
I have wished you joy
since first I saw you.

947
01:44:12,443 --> 01:44:14,695
Gimli:
Just where do you think you're off to?

948
01:44:16,405 --> 01:44:18,616
- This time you must stay, gimli.
- Mm.

949
01:44:21,327 --> 01:44:24,163
Have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of dwarves?

950
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:28,000
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

951
01:44:50,314 --> 01:44:52,483
- Man 1: What's happening?
- Where is he going?

952
01:44:52,817 --> 01:44:54,693
Where's he going?

953
01:44:57,238 --> 01:44:59,323
I don't understand.

954
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:05,538
Man 2: Lord aragorn!

955
01:45:05,955 --> 01:45:08,666
Man 1:
Why does he leave on the Eve of battle?

956
01:45:09,875 --> 01:45:11,961
He leaves because there is no hope.

957
01:45:12,586 --> 01:45:14,755
He leaves because he must.

958
01:45:14,922 --> 01:45:16,590
Gamling: Too few have come.

959
01:45:16,757 --> 01:45:18,968
We cannot defeat
the armies of mordor.

960
01:45:23,556 --> 01:45:24,765
We cannot.

961
01:45:27,685 --> 01:45:31,480
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

962
01:45:45,911 --> 01:45:47,621
I have left instruction.

963
01:45:50,291 --> 01:45:53,586
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

964
01:46:00,134 --> 01:46:02,428
Take up my seat in the golden hall.

965
01:46:03,637 --> 01:46:06,473
Long may you defend edoras...

966
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:09,018
If the battle goes ill.

967
01:46:10,102 --> 01:46:13,522
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

968
01:46:15,733 --> 01:46:17,651
Duty?

969
01:46:29,496 --> 01:46:31,624
I would have you smile again...

970
01:46:35,044 --> 01:46:40,049
Not grieve for those
whose time has come.

971
01:46:44,845 --> 01:46:48,349
You shall live to see
these days renewed...

972
01:46:52,686 --> 01:46:55,481
And no more despair.

973
01:47:01,695 --> 01:47:05,366
Gimli: What kind of army would linger
in such a place?

974
01:47:05,574 --> 01:47:07,368
Legolas: One that is cursed.

975
01:47:09,370 --> 01:47:11,872
Long ago, the men of the mountains
swore an oath...

976
01:47:12,331 --> 01:47:15,084
To the last king of gondor...

977
01:47:15,668 --> 01:47:17,211
To come to his aid...

978
01:47:17,378 --> 01:47:19,129
To fight.

979
01:47:19,630 --> 01:47:21,799
But when the time came...

980
01:47:22,383 --> 01:47:25,052
When gondor's need was dire...

981
01:47:25,219 --> 01:47:27,054
They fled...

982
01:47:27,221 --> 01:47:30,641
Vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain.

983
01:47:31,684 --> 01:47:34,019
And so isildur cursed them...

984
01:47:35,562 --> 01:47:39,400
Never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

985
01:47:43,737 --> 01:47:46,907
Who shall call them
from the grey twilight?

986
01:47:47,366 --> 01:47:49,576
The forgotten people.

987
01:47:49,743 --> 01:47:52,246
The heir of him to whom
the oath they swore.

988
01:47:52,746 --> 01:47:54,623
From the north shall he come.

989
01:47:55,124 --> 01:47:56,750
Need shall drive him.

990
01:47:57,876 --> 01:48:01,380
He shall pass the door
to the paths of the dead.

991
01:48:19,857 --> 01:48:23,152
The very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away.

992
01:48:28,699 --> 01:48:30,659
The way is shut.

993
01:48:31,410 --> 01:48:33,370
It was made by those
who are dead.

994
01:48:33,954 --> 01:48:36,248
And the dead keep it.

995
01:48:36,790 --> 01:48:38,292
The way is shut.

996
01:48:49,678 --> 01:48:51,180
Brego!

997
01:48:54,683 --> 01:48:57,394
I do not fear death.

998
01:49:09,698 --> 01:49:12,117
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

999
01:49:12,284 --> 01:49:16,955
An elf will go underground
where a dwarf dare not?

1000
01:49:18,624 --> 01:49:21,460
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1001
01:49:36,475 --> 01:49:38,685
We must ride light and swift.

1002
01:49:38,852 --> 01:49:40,646
It is a long road ahead.

1003
01:49:40,813 --> 01:49:43,857
And man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight.

1004
01:49:49,363 --> 01:49:52,366
Little hobbits do not belong in war,
master meriadoc.

1005
01:49:52,741 --> 01:49:54,701
All my friends have gone to battle.

1006
01:49:54,868 --> 01:49:56,787
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1007
01:49:56,954 --> 01:49:59,039
It is a three-day gallop to minas tirith.

1008
01:49:59,248 --> 01:50:01,625
And none of my riders can bear you
as a burden.

1009
01:50:02,626 --> 01:50:04,753
I want to fight.

1010
01:50:05,254 --> 01:50:07,256
I will say no more.

1011
01:50:24,064 --> 01:50:26,024
Ride with me.

1012
01:50:27,484 --> 01:50:28,902
My lady.

1013
01:50:29,069 --> 01:50:31,405
Eomer: Form up! Move out!

1014
01:50:31,572 --> 01:50:34,825
Form up! Move out!

1015
01:50:37,911 --> 01:50:39,079
Theoden: Ride!

1016
01:50:39,288 --> 01:50:42,249
Ride now to gondor!

1017
01:51:23,874 --> 01:51:25,626
Gimli: What is it?

1018
01:51:25,792 --> 01:51:27,336
What do you see?

1019
01:51:27,586 --> 01:51:29,713
I see shapes of men.

1020
01:51:32,382 --> 01:51:33,759
And of horses.

1021
01:51:34,468 --> 01:51:35,719
Where?

1022
01:51:35,886 --> 01:51:38,847
Legolas:
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1023
01:51:41,266 --> 01:51:43,477
Spears rise...

1024
01:51:44,102 --> 01:51:47,564
Like winter-thickets
through a shroud of mist.

1025
01:51:48,815 --> 01:51:50,984
The dead are following.

1026
01:51:52,152 --> 01:51:53,654
They have been summoned.

1027
01:51:54,363 --> 01:51:56,156
The dead?

1028
01:51:56,573 --> 01:51:58,283
Summoned?

1029
01:51:58,659 --> 01:52:00,577
I knew that.

1030
01:52:03,914 --> 01:52:05,666
Very good.

1031
01:52:06,375 --> 01:52:08,460
Very good! Legolas!

1032
01:52:46,415 --> 01:52:47,833
Do not look down.

1033
01:53:40,427 --> 01:53:45,557
King of the dead:
Who enters my domain?

1034
01:53:49,269 --> 01:53:51,521
One who will have your allegiance.

1035
01:53:54,483 --> 01:53:59,780
The dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1036
01:54:00,113 --> 01:54:02,783
You will suffer me.

1037
01:54:26,306 --> 01:54:29,726
King of the dead:
The way is shut.

1038
01:54:30,894 --> 01:54:35,315
It was made by those who are dead.

1039
01:54:35,732 --> 01:54:39,903
And the dead keep it.

1040
01:54:49,037 --> 01:54:52,124
The way is shut.

1041
01:54:53,834 --> 01:54:56,503
Now you must die.

1042
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:03,176
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1043
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:08,515
None but the king of gondor
may command me.

1044
01:55:14,104 --> 01:55:16,273
That line was broken.

1045
01:55:18,859 --> 01:55:21,111
It has been remade.

1046
01:55:29,035 --> 01:55:30,537
Fight for us...

1047
01:55:30,704 --> 01:55:33,290
And regain your honor.

1048
01:55:37,461 --> 01:55:38,795
What say you?

1049
01:55:51,016 --> 01:55:52,559
What say you?

1050
01:55:52,726 --> 01:55:55,061
Ah! You waste your time, aragorn.

1051
01:55:55,228 --> 01:55:58,398
They had no honor in life,
they have none now in death.

1052
01:55:58,899 --> 01:56:01,401
I am isildur's heir.

1053
01:56:01,985 --> 01:56:03,904
Fight for me...

1054
01:56:04,529 --> 01:56:08,116
And I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1055
01:56:12,037 --> 01:56:13,997
What say you?

1056
01:56:21,922 --> 01:56:24,132
You have my word!

1057
01:56:24,424 --> 01:56:28,428
Fight, and I will release you
from this living death!

1058
01:56:29,888 --> 01:56:31,389
What say you?!

1059
01:56:34,684 --> 01:56:37,646
Stand, you traitors!

1060
01:57:04,589 --> 01:57:05,632
Out!

1061
01:57:26,987 --> 01:57:28,572
Legolas!

1062
01:58:37,223 --> 01:58:39,267
We fight.

1063
01:58:49,653 --> 01:58:52,238
Iorlas: Open the gate! Quick!

1064
01:59:23,269 --> 01:59:25,271
Quick! Hurry!

1065
01:59:39,035 --> 01:59:40,620
Faramir!

1066
01:59:41,621 --> 01:59:44,916
Say not that he has fallen.

1067
01:59:46,084 --> 01:59:47,627
They were outnumbered.

1068
01:59:48,044 --> 01:59:49,629
None survived.

1069
01:59:50,338 --> 01:59:52,340
Fean

1070
01:59:52,882 --> 01:59:56,094
the city is rank with it.

1071
01:59:58,430 --> 02:00:00,890
Let us ease their pain.

1072
02:00:01,141 --> 02:00:02,892
Release the prisoners.

1073
02:00:03,059 --> 02:00:04,978
Catapults!

1074
02:00:08,273 --> 02:00:10,358
Man: Shields up!

1075
02:00:18,366 --> 02:00:21,828
Denethor: My sons are spent.

1076
02:00:22,871 --> 02:00:25,790
My line has ended.

1077
02:00:28,626 --> 02:00:30,003
Pippin: He's alive!

1078
02:00:30,170 --> 02:00:33,339
The house of stewards has failed.

1079
02:00:33,506 --> 02:00:35,008
He needs medicine, my lord.

1080
02:00:36,009 --> 02:00:38,678
My line has ended!

1081
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:42,182
Pippin: My lord!

1082
02:00:49,189 --> 02:00:51,274
Orc: Put it in!

1083
02:00:58,323 --> 02:01:00,700
Has deserted us.

1084
02:01:15,173 --> 02:01:18,384
Théoden's betrayed me.

1085
02:01:29,521 --> 02:01:31,356
Abandon your posts!

1086
02:01:32,398 --> 02:01:36,319
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1087
02:01:38,822 --> 02:01:40,657
Oh!

1088
02:01:46,454 --> 02:01:47,997
Prepare for battle!

1089
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:51,709
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1090
02:01:52,877 --> 02:01:54,838
Man: Over here!

1091
02:01:55,588 --> 02:01:57,966
Gandalf: Return to your posts!

1092
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:11,396
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1093
02:02:21,573 --> 02:02:23,032
Stay where you are.

1094
02:02:40,008 --> 02:02:41,426
Soldier 1: We need more rubble!

1095
02:02:41,593 --> 02:02:43,469
Soldier 2: Watch out!

1096
02:02:43,636 --> 02:02:46,139
Soldier 3:
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1097
02:02:48,057 --> 02:02:49,601
Soldier 4: Double up, men!

1098
02:03:58,586 --> 02:04:01,589
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1099
02:04:02,090 --> 02:04:05,593
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1100
02:04:46,259 --> 02:04:47,885
Not at the towers!

1101
02:04:48,052 --> 02:04:51,055
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1102
02:04:51,764 --> 02:04:53,641
Bring them down!

1103
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:30,803
Fight them back!

1104
02:05:30,970 --> 02:05:32,972
Peregrin took!

1105
02:05:33,806 --> 02:05:36,976
- Go back to the citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

1106
02:05:52,700 --> 02:05:55,078
This is no place for a hobbit.

1107
02:06:20,812 --> 02:06:22,271
Guard of the citadel, indeed.

1108
02:06:22,855 --> 02:06:26,234
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1109
02:06:37,537 --> 02:06:40,540
What are you doing,
you useless scum?!

1110
02:06:40,706 --> 02:06:42,667
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1111
02:06:49,006 --> 02:06:51,384
Get back there and smash it down.

1112
02:06:51,551 --> 02:06:53,553
But nothing can breach it.

1113
02:06:56,514 --> 02:06:58,766
Grond will breach it.

1114
02:07:02,186 --> 02:07:04,272
Bring up the wolf's head.

1115
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:12,780
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1116
02:07:13,072 --> 02:07:16,909
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1117
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:22,290
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1118
02:07:22,999 --> 02:07:26,669
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1119
02:07:27,086 --> 02:07:31,257
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1120
02:07:31,424 --> 02:07:35,052
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1121
02:07:56,302 --> 02:07:58,095
Aragorn: You may go no further.

1122
02:08:01,307 --> 02:08:03,476
You will not enter gondor.

1123
02:08:05,061 --> 02:08:07,021
Who are you to deny us passage?

1124
02:08:07,104 --> 02:08:10,942
Legolas, fire a warning shot
past the bosun's ear.

1125
02:08:13,152 --> 02:08:14,779
Mind your aim.

1126
02:08:19,617 --> 02:08:21,410
Oh!

1127
02:08:21,494 --> 02:08:23,996
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1128
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:25,832
Prepare to be boarded.

1129
02:08:27,583 --> 02:08:29,001
Corsair bosun: Boarded?

1130
02:08:29,085 --> 02:08:30,795
By you and whose army?

1131
02:08:32,338 --> 02:08:34,632
This army.

1132
02:08:51,315 --> 02:08:53,150
In there.

1133
02:08:54,819 --> 02:08:56,696
What is this place?

1134
02:09:01,075 --> 02:09:04,495
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1135
02:09:05,872 --> 02:09:09,876
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1136
02:09:11,961 --> 02:09:14,213
It's the only way.

1137
02:09:16,549 --> 02:09:18,551
Go in...

1138
02:09:19,093 --> 02:09:21,345
Or go back.

1139
02:09:24,015 --> 02:09:26,767
I can't go back.

1140
02:09:38,988 --> 02:09:41,741
- What's that smell?
- Gollum: Orcses' filth.

1141
02:09:41,824 --> 02:09:45,077
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1142
02:09:50,082 --> 02:09:51,918
Hurry.

1143
02:09:56,797 --> 02:09:58,758
This way.

1144
02:10:01,594 --> 02:10:03,429
Sméagol?

1145
02:10:04,388 --> 02:10:06,557
Gollum: Over here.

1146
02:10:11,395 --> 02:10:12,772
Oh!

1147
02:10:14,774 --> 02:10:18,027
It's sticky. What is it?

1148
02:10:18,110 --> 02:10:20,488
Gollum: You'll see.

1149
02:10:20,571 --> 02:10:22,990
Oh, yes.

1150
02:10:23,074 --> 02:10:26,285
You will see.

1151
02:10:35,169 --> 02:10:36,837
Sméagol?

1152
02:10:38,130 --> 02:10:39,465
Sméagol!

1153
02:10:42,134 --> 02:10:44,095
Sméagol!

1154
02:12:35,372 --> 02:12:37,541
Galadriel:
And you, Frodo Baggins...

1155
02:12:37,625 --> 02:12:43,047
I give you the light of earendil,
our most beloved star.

1156
02:12:43,798 --> 02:12:47,134
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1157
02:12:47,218 --> 02:12:50,805
When all other lights go out.

1158
02:14:07,173 --> 02:14:10,509
Gollum: Naughty little fly

1159
02:14:10,593 --> 02:14:13,846
why does he cry?

1160
02:14:14,346 --> 02:14:17,725
Caught in a web

1161
02:14:17,808 --> 02:14:20,644
soon you'll be...

1162
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:22,855
Eaten.

1163
02:15:00,017 --> 02:15:02,770
Got away, did it, precious?

1164
02:15:05,147 --> 02:15:08,234
- Not this time!
- No!

1165
02:15:15,074 --> 02:15:18,410
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1166
02:15:18,911 --> 02:15:21,580
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.

1167
02:15:21,664 --> 02:15:23,624
We promised.

1168
02:15:23,707 --> 02:15:26,293
You must believe us.

1169
02:15:26,377 --> 02:15:28,212
It was the precious.

1170
02:15:28,295 --> 02:15:33,092
The precious made us do it.

1171
02:15:50,234 --> 02:15:53,112
I have to destroy it, sméagol.

1172
02:16:02,121 --> 02:16:05,457
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1173
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:42,661
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1174
02:16:47,124 --> 02:16:49,668
I'm so sorry.

1175
02:17:15,444 --> 02:17:20,240
Galadriel: This task was appointed
to you, Frodo of the shire.

1176
02:17:21,367 --> 02:17:23,827
If you do not find a way...

1177
02:17:25,037 --> 02:17:26,330
No one will.

1178
02:18:00,114 --> 02:18:02,950
Eomer: The scouts report
minas tirith is surrounded.

1179
02:18:03,033 --> 02:18:05,369
The lower level's in flames.

1180
02:18:05,786 --> 02:18:08,288
Everywhere,
legions of the enemy advance.

1181
02:18:08,372 --> 02:18:09,623
Time is against us.

1182
02:18:10,249 --> 02:18:11,625
Make ready!

1183
02:18:11,708 --> 02:18:13,627
Take heart, merry.

1184
02:18:13,710 --> 02:18:15,921
It will soon be over.

1185
02:18:16,547 --> 02:18:18,090
My lady...

1186
02:18:18,715 --> 02:18:21,260
You are fair and brave...

1187
02:18:21,593 --> 02:18:24,054
And have much to live for...

1188
02:18:25,389 --> 02:18:27,766
And many who love you.

1189
02:18:30,561 --> 02:18:33,272
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1190
02:18:33,814 --> 02:18:37,067
I know there is not much point
now in hoping.

1191
02:18:38,277 --> 02:18:41,697
If I were a knight of Rohan,
capable of great deeds...

1192
02:18:41,780 --> 02:18:44,992
But I'm not.

1193
02:18:49,663 --> 02:18:52,166
And I know I can't save middle-earth.

1194
02:18:55,586 --> 02:18:57,921
I just want to help my friends.

1195
02:18:59,965 --> 02:19:01,467
Frodo.

1196
02:19:05,637 --> 02:19:07,681
Pippin.

1197
02:19:09,141 --> 02:19:12,186
More than anything,
I wish I could see them again.

1198
02:19:16,440 --> 02:19:18,817
Eomer: Prepare to move out!

1199
02:19:18,901 --> 02:19:21,695
Make haste.
We ride through the night.

1200
02:20:04,655 --> 02:20:06,406
Back to the gate!

1201
02:20:06,698 --> 02:20:08,867
Hurry!

1202
02:20:28,762 --> 02:20:33,308
I am steward of the house of anarion.

1203
02:20:33,392 --> 02:20:35,852
Thus have I walked.

1204
02:20:37,062 --> 02:20:40,148
And thus now will I sleep.

1205
02:20:46,196 --> 02:20:48,282
Gondor is lost.

1206
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:52,244
There is no hope for men.

1207
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:09,678
Why do the fools fly?

1208
02:21:11,221 --> 02:21:14,266
Better to die sooner than late.

1209
02:21:16,435 --> 02:21:18,478
For die we must.

1210
02:21:30,616 --> 02:21:33,702
No tomb for denethor
and faramir.

1211
02:21:34,786 --> 02:21:40,834
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1212
02:21:40,917 --> 02:21:46,131
We shall burn,
like the heathen kings of old.

1213
02:21:49,801 --> 02:21:51,595
Bring wood and oil.

1214
02:21:54,431 --> 02:21:55,849
Gandalf: Steady.

1215
02:21:55,932 --> 02:21:58,018
Steady.

1216
02:22:12,449 --> 02:22:14,993
You are soldiers of gondor.

1217
02:22:15,243 --> 02:22:19,665
No matter what comes through that gate,
you will stand your ground.

1218
02:22:26,171 --> 02:22:27,339
Soldier: Run!

1219
02:22:29,257 --> 02:22:30,759
Volley!

1220
02:22:31,510 --> 02:22:33,428
Fire!

1221
02:24:26,500 --> 02:24:28,585
Let him go, you filth.

1222
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:32,130
Let him go!

1223
02:24:33,423 --> 02:24:35,592
You will not touch him again.

1224
02:24:38,678 --> 02:24:40,597
Come on and finish it.

1225
02:26:53,605 --> 02:26:55,649
Oh, no.

1226
02:26:55,732 --> 02:26:57,734
Frodo.

1227
02:27:04,449 --> 02:27:05,784
Wake up.

1228
02:27:09,621 --> 02:27:12,040
Don't leave me here alone.

1229
02:27:13,541 --> 02:27:15,961
Don't go where I can't follow.

1230
02:27:20,298 --> 02:27:21,633
Wake up.

1231
02:27:28,306 --> 02:27:30,558
Not asleep.

1232
02:27:53,289 --> 02:27:54,833
Shagrat: You get back, you scum!

1233
02:28:04,467 --> 02:28:05,802
Gorbag: What's this?

1234
02:28:06,970 --> 02:28:09,681
Looks like old shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

1235
02:28:11,683 --> 02:28:14,269
Shagrat:
Killed another one, has she?

1236
02:28:19,107 --> 02:28:21,109
This fellow ain't dead.

1237
02:28:21,401 --> 02:28:23,737
Not dead?

1238
02:28:23,820 --> 02:28:29,701
She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1239
02:28:30,035 --> 02:28:32,746
Then she has her way with them.

1240
02:28:33,121 --> 02:28:34,831
That's how she likes to feed.

1241
02:28:37,584 --> 02:28:39,919
Get him to the tower!

1242
02:28:43,381 --> 02:28:45,133
Samwise, you fool.

1243
02:28:45,216 --> 02:28:48,136
Tower orc: This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

1244
02:28:48,219 --> 02:28:50,764
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1245
02:29:15,080 --> 02:29:18,291
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1246
02:29:19,375 --> 02:29:20,794
He is burning.

1247
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:23,254
Already burning.

1248
02:29:23,671 --> 02:29:25,673
Pippin: He's not dead.

1249
02:29:26,091 --> 02:29:27,759
He's not dead!

1250
02:29:34,390 --> 02:29:36,434
He's not dead!

1251
02:29:36,810 --> 02:29:40,313
- Farewell, peregrin, son of paladin.
- Pippin: No! No! No!

1252
02:29:40,396 --> 02:29:43,775
I release you from my service.

1253
02:29:45,110 --> 02:29:49,447
Go now and die in what way
seems best to you.

1254
02:29:51,616 --> 02:29:53,952
Pour oil on the wood!

1255
02:29:55,703 --> 02:29:57,747
Soldier:
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1256
02:29:58,248 --> 02:30:01,126
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

1257
02:30:01,501 --> 02:30:02,961
Where is Gandalf?

1258
02:30:10,802 --> 02:30:11,970
Gandalf: Retreat!

1259
02:30:14,139 --> 02:30:15,974
The city is breached!

1260
02:30:16,057 --> 02:30:19,018
Fall back to the second level!

1261
02:30:22,814 --> 02:30:24,440
Get the women and children out!

1262
02:30:24,816 --> 02:30:26,609
Get them out!

1263
02:30:26,693 --> 02:30:28,236
Retreat!

1264
02:30:28,319 --> 02:30:30,155
Soldier: Come on. Come on.

1265
02:30:30,488 --> 02:30:34,784
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

1266
02:30:42,792 --> 02:30:45,170
Guard: Take them down!

1267
02:31:05,690 --> 02:31:08,651
Gandalf:
Fight. Fight to the last man!

1268
02:31:08,735 --> 02:31:10,069
Fight for your lives!

1269
02:31:17,327 --> 02:31:20,038
Denethor has lost his mind!

1270
02:31:20,121 --> 02:31:22,457
He's burning faramir alive!

1271
02:31:22,540 --> 02:31:24,375
Up! Quickly!

1272
02:31:31,216 --> 02:31:32,717
Go back to the abyss.

1273
02:31:34,219 --> 02:31:37,430
Fall into the nothingness
that awaits you and your master.

1274
02:31:37,513 --> 02:31:44,103
Witch-king: Do you not know death
when you see it, old man?

1275
02:31:44,187 --> 02:31:48,983
This is my hour.

1276
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:12,465
Witch-king: You have failed.

1277
02:32:13,258 --> 02:32:18,096
The world of men will fall.

1278
02:33:15,403 --> 02:33:16,863
Courage, merry.

1279
02:33:16,946 --> 02:33:19,407
Courage for our friends.

1280
02:33:22,952 --> 02:33:26,039
Gothmog:
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1281
02:33:26,122 --> 02:33:29,459
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1282
02:33:37,508 --> 02:33:40,720
Theoden: Eomer, take your éored
down the left flank.

1283
02:33:40,803 --> 02:33:42,180
Eomer: Flank ready.

1284
02:33:42,263 --> 02:33:45,224
Theoden: Gamling, follow the king's
banner down the center.

1285
02:33:45,308 --> 02:33:49,062
Grimbold, take your company right
after you pass the wall.

1286
02:33:49,145 --> 02:33:52,023
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1287
02:33:52,106 --> 02:33:56,069
Arise, arise, riders of théoden!

1288
02:33:56,152 --> 02:34:01,449
Spears shall be shaken,
shields shall be splintered...

1289
02:34:01,532 --> 02:34:05,370
A sword-day, a red day...

1290
02:34:05,453 --> 02:34:09,040
Ere the sun rises!

1291
02:34:16,839 --> 02:34:21,177
Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

1292
02:34:27,517 --> 02:34:29,560
Theoden: Ride now!

1293
02:34:31,020 --> 02:34:33,189
Ride now!

1294
02:34:33,731 --> 02:34:36,567
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1295
02:34:36,651 --> 02:34:39,487
And the world's ending!

1296
02:34:43,199 --> 02:34:46,202
All: Death!

1297
02:34:46,285 --> 02:34:49,539
Theoden: Death! All: Death!

1298
02:34:49,997 --> 02:34:51,541
Theoden: Death! All: Death!

1299
02:34:52,250 --> 02:34:55,711
- Death!
- Death!

1300
02:35:00,842 --> 02:35:03,219
Forth eorlingas!

1301
02:35:46,220 --> 02:35:47,930
Fire!

1302
02:35:57,148 --> 02:35:58,441
Charge!

1303
02:35:58,941 --> 02:36:00,526
Fire at will!

1304
02:36:57,833 --> 02:37:01,170
Set a fire in our flesh.

1305
02:37:18,813 --> 02:37:20,523
Stay this madness!

1306
02:37:24,860 --> 02:37:29,490
You may triumph in the field of battle
for a day...

1307
02:37:30,032 --> 02:37:33,703
But against the power that has risen
in the east...

1308
02:37:33,786 --> 02:37:37,039
There is no victory.

1309
02:38:08,154 --> 02:38:10,906
You will not take my son from me!

1310
02:38:24,253 --> 02:38:25,921
Faramir.

1311
02:38:39,477 --> 02:38:43,439
So passes denethor, son of ecthelion.

1312
02:39:10,966 --> 02:39:12,802
Drive them to the river!

1313
02:39:15,513 --> 02:39:17,515
Make safe the city!

1314
02:39:57,513 --> 02:39:59,515
Re-form the line!

1315
02:40:00,641 --> 02:40:02,560
Re-form the line!

1316
02:40:09,567 --> 02:40:12,194
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1317
02:40:12,862 --> 02:40:15,030
Charge!

1318
02:41:33,943 --> 02:41:35,361
Man 1: Cut him down!

1319
02:41:37,112 --> 02:41:39,073
Man 2: Follow me!

1320
02:42:02,012 --> 02:42:04,640
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1321
02:42:07,017 --> 02:42:08,310
Left!

1322
02:42:25,703 --> 02:42:27,413
Aim for their heads!

1323
02:42:33,419 --> 02:42:36,672
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

1324
02:42:50,519 --> 02:42:52,021
Merry!

1325
02:44:05,427 --> 02:44:07,513
I didn't think it would end this way.

1326
02:44:08,764 --> 02:44:10,224
End?

1327
02:44:11,433 --> 02:44:13,602
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1328
02:44:16,105 --> 02:44:19,233
Death is just another path...

1329
02:44:19,775 --> 02:44:21,443
One that we all must take.

1330
02:44:22,736 --> 02:44:26,198
The grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back...

1331
02:44:26,281 --> 02:44:29,952
And all turns to silver glass.

1332
02:44:32,121 --> 02:44:34,123
And then you see it.

1333
02:44:36,041 --> 02:44:38,419
What, Gandalf?

1334
02:44:42,131 --> 02:44:44,299
White shores...

1335
02:44:45,968 --> 02:44:48,429
And beyond.

1336
02:44:49,847 --> 02:44:51,640
A far green country...

1337
02:44:52,349 --> 02:44:55,310
Under a swift sunrise.

1338
02:44:59,314 --> 02:45:00,858
Well...

1339
02:45:00,941 --> 02:45:02,693
That isn't so bad.

1340
02:45:06,321 --> 02:45:07,990
No, it isn't.

1341
02:45:24,339 --> 02:45:27,718
Rally to me! To me!

1342
02:45:48,489 --> 02:45:53,035
Witch-king: Feast on his flesh.

1343
02:45:57,372 --> 02:45:59,750
I will kill you if you touch him.

1344
02:45:59,833 --> 02:46:05,380
Witch-king: Do not come between
the nangl and his prey.

1345
02:47:13,782 --> 02:47:16,952
Orc commander:
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1346
02:47:17,411 --> 02:47:19,663
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1347
02:47:19,746 --> 02:47:23,000
Come on, you sea rats!
Get off your ships!

1348
02:47:38,473 --> 02:47:40,684
There's plenty for the both of us.

1349
02:47:40,767 --> 02:47:42,853
May the best dwarf win.

1350
02:48:00,329 --> 02:48:02,623
Witch-king: You fool.

1351
02:48:02,706 --> 02:48:06,168
No man can kill me.

1352
02:48:08,503 --> 02:48:11,673
Die now.

1353
02:48:22,351 --> 02:48:24,394
I am no man.

1354
02:48:40,911 --> 02:48:44,414
- Fifteen! Sixteen!
- Gimli: Seventeen!

1355
02:48:52,214 --> 02:48:54,091
Merry!

1356
02:49:36,091 --> 02:49:37,926
Legolas!

1357
02:50:00,282 --> 02:50:02,659
Thirty-three, thirty-four.

1358
02:50:49,790 --> 02:50:52,209
That still only counts as one!

1359
02:50:52,292 --> 02:50:54,503
Come on, then. Come on!

1360
02:51:38,213 --> 02:51:41,049
Theoden: I know your face...

1361
02:51:42,884 --> 02:51:44,719
Eowyn.

1362
02:51:47,347 --> 02:51:49,724
My eyes darken.

1363
02:51:56,731 --> 02:51:59,234
I am going to save you.

1364
02:52:00,569 --> 02:52:02,904
You already did.

1365
02:52:06,575 --> 02:52:08,243
Eowyn...

1366
02:52:09,744 --> 02:52:12,247
My body is broken.

1367
02:52:17,252 --> 02:52:19,754
You have to let me go.

1368
02:52:25,594 --> 02:52:28,221
I go to my fathers...

1369
02:52:29,639 --> 02:52:32,517
In whose mighty company...

1370
02:52:32,934 --> 02:52:36,271
I shall not now feel ashamed.

1371
02:52:52,913 --> 02:52:54,539
Eowyn.

1372
02:53:41,002 --> 02:53:43,505
Release us.

1373
02:53:47,259 --> 02:53:51,179
Very handy in a tight spot, these lads,
despite the fact they're dead.

1374
02:53:51,263 --> 02:53:53,306
You gave us your word.

1375
02:53:55,016 --> 02:53:57,185
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1376
02:54:00,689 --> 02:54:02,357
Be at peace.

1377
02:54:45,734 --> 02:54:47,652
Merry.

1378
02:56:44,853 --> 02:56:46,062
Pippin: Merry!

1379
02:56:47,689 --> 02:56:49,691
Merry!

1380
02:57:01,035 --> 02:57:02,871
Merry.

1381
02:57:05,373 --> 02:57:06,583
Merry, it's me.

1382
02:57:09,210 --> 02:57:10,795
It's pippin.

1383
02:57:13,298 --> 02:57:15,592
I knew you'd find me.

1384
02:57:15,675 --> 02:57:16,926
Pippin:

1385
02:57:19,387 --> 02:57:21,431
Are you going to leave me?

1386
02:57:22,015 --> 02:57:23,725
No, merry.

1387
02:57:25,018 --> 02:57:27,228
I'm going to look after you.

1388
02:58:11,231 --> 02:58:12,732
Hands off!

1389
02:58:12,816 --> 02:58:15,985
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1390
02:58:16,277 --> 02:58:20,448
It's going to the great eye,
along with everything else.

1391
02:58:21,950 --> 02:58:25,787
Shagrat: I don't take orders from
stinking morgul-rats!

1392
02:58:26,621 --> 02:58:31,876
Gorbag: You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

1393
02:58:52,480 --> 02:58:54,357
The scum tried to knife me.

1394
03:00:39,420 --> 03:00:41,422
That's for Frodo!

1395
03:00:41,798 --> 03:00:43,925
And for the shire!

1396
03:00:47,553 --> 03:00:49,639
And that's for my old gaffer!

1397
03:01:19,127 --> 03:01:22,463
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1398
03:01:23,631 --> 03:01:28,302
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1399
03:01:35,643 --> 03:01:38,354
- Not if I stick you first.
- Sam!

1400
03:01:44,110 --> 03:01:46,195
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1401
03:01:46,279 --> 03:01:48,322
Sorry for everything.

1402
03:01:48,823 --> 03:01:52,535
- Sam: Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

1403
03:01:52,618 --> 03:01:55,580
They've taken it. Sam...

1404
03:01:56,330 --> 03:01:57,832
They took the ring.

1405
03:01:58,624 --> 03:02:01,335
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1406
03:02:13,306 --> 03:02:15,516
I thought I'd lost you.

1407
03:02:15,850 --> 03:02:17,602
So I took it.

1408
03:02:18,728 --> 03:02:20,855
Only for safekeeping.

1409
03:02:22,106 --> 03:02:23,858
Give it to me.

1410
03:02:27,361 --> 03:02:29,614
Give me the ring, Sam.

1411
03:02:34,243 --> 03:02:35,536
Sam.

1412
03:02:37,121 --> 03:02:39,040
Give me the ring.

1413
03:02:59,769 --> 03:03:01,771
You must understand.

1414
03:03:04,565 --> 03:03:06,400
The ring is my burden.

1415
03:03:07,568 --> 03:03:09,737
It will destroy you, Sam.

1416
03:03:12,907 --> 03:03:14,909
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1417
03:03:16,244 --> 03:03:17,912
We best find you some clothes.

1418
03:03:17,995 --> 03:03:21,082
You can't go walking through mordor
in naught but your skin.

1419
03:03:42,770 --> 03:03:44,981
Sam: We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1420
03:03:45,481 --> 03:03:47,775
We made it to mordor.

1421
03:03:49,110 --> 03:03:50,778
Frodo:
There are so many of them.

1422
03:03:51,779 --> 03:03:54,323
We'll never get through unseen.

1423
03:03:59,453 --> 03:04:02,790
It's him, the eye.

1424
03:04:10,506 --> 03:04:13,134
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1425
03:04:13,634 --> 03:04:15,636
There's nothing for it.

1426
03:04:18,639 --> 03:04:23,102
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

1427
03:04:32,445 --> 03:04:35,656
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1428
03:04:36,991 --> 03:04:39,869
The darkness is deepening.

1429
03:04:39,952 --> 03:04:42,413
If Sauron had the ring,
we would know it.

1430
03:04:42,496 --> 03:04:44,624
It's only a matter of time.

1431
03:04:46,125 --> 03:04:48,502
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

1432
03:04:49,545 --> 03:04:54,133
But behind the walls of mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

1433
03:04:54,217 --> 03:04:56,135
Let him stay there.

1434
03:04:56,219 --> 03:04:58,930
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1435
03:04:59,013 --> 03:05:04,268
Because 10,000 orcs now stand
between Frodo and mount doom.

1436
03:05:11,025 --> 03:05:13,778
I've sent him to his death.

1437
03:05:17,573 --> 03:05:19,283
There is still hope for Frodo.

1438
03:05:19,575 --> 03:05:23,704
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of gorgoroth.

1439
03:05:24,830 --> 03:05:27,375
- We can give him that.
- How?

1440
03:05:27,708 --> 03:05:30,461
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1441
03:05:30,544 --> 03:05:32,797
Empty his lands.

1442
03:05:32,880 --> 03:05:36,092
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the black gate.

1443
03:05:37,635 --> 03:05:39,971
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

1444
03:05:40,054 --> 03:05:41,472
Aragorn: Not for ourselves.

1445
03:05:41,555 --> 03:05:47,228
But we can give Frodo his chance
if we keep Sauron's eye fixed upon us.

1446
03:05:49,021 --> 03:05:52,817
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1447
03:05:53,567 --> 03:05:54,777
A diversion.

1448
03:05:54,860 --> 03:05:56,779
Certainty of death...

1449
03:05:56,862 --> 03:05:59,615
Small chance of success...

1450
03:06:00,533 --> 03:06:02,076
What are we waiting for?

1451
03:06:02,702 --> 03:06:05,079
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1452
03:06:05,913 --> 03:06:07,915
He will not take the bait.

1453
03:06:09,417 --> 03:06:11,919
Oh, I think he will.

1454
03:06:46,329 --> 03:06:48,956
Long have you hunted me.

1455
03:06:49,874 --> 03:06:51,125
Long have I eluded you.

1456
03:06:52,960 --> 03:06:54,587
No more.

1457
03:06:56,297 --> 03:06:58,674
Behold the sword of elendil.

1458
03:07:43,177 --> 03:07:45,679
Eova:
The city has fallen silent.

1459
03:07:47,348 --> 03:07:50,434
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1460
03:07:51,185 --> 03:07:52,937
It grows so cold.

1461
03:07:55,940 --> 03:07:58,984
It's just the damp
of the first spring rain.

1462
03:08:05,366 --> 03:08:08,536
I do not believe this darkness
will endure.

1463
03:08:37,189 --> 03:08:38,732
Sam: Look, the orcs...

1464
03:08:39,275 --> 03:08:41,277
They're moving off.

1465
03:08:42,361 --> 03:08:44,447
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1466
03:08:44,530 --> 03:08:46,949
Some luck at last.

1467
03:08:47,032 --> 03:08:48,909
Orc sergeant:
Move it, you slugs!

1468
03:08:50,244 --> 03:08:53,581
Come on! Faster!

1469
03:09:01,589 --> 03:09:04,925
Come along, you scum...

1470
03:09:05,009 --> 03:09:09,263
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

1471
03:09:12,141 --> 03:09:13,809
Come on!

1472
03:09:13,893 --> 03:09:16,312
What have I told you?!

1473
03:09:23,110 --> 03:09:24,612
Get up!

1474
03:09:25,029 --> 03:09:27,698
Come on, you slugs!

1475
03:09:27,781 --> 03:09:31,494
You two are going straight
to the front line!

1476
03:09:31,577 --> 03:09:36,582
Now, move it! Go on!
Fall in! Move it!

1477
03:09:49,553 --> 03:09:53,349
To the gate, you slugs!
Now, move it!

1478
03:10:02,775 --> 03:10:06,320
Don't you know we're at war?

1479
03:10:28,676 --> 03:10:31,512
Orc sergeant: Company, halt!

1480
03:10:35,349 --> 03:10:38,769
Inspection!

1481
03:10:38,852 --> 03:10:41,397
Frodo: Sam, help me.

1482
03:10:41,480 --> 03:10:43,357
Sam: Mr. Frodo!

1483
03:10:46,110 --> 03:10:48,696
Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up!

1484
03:10:48,779 --> 03:10:50,656
Frodo: It's so heavy.

1485
03:10:59,748 --> 03:11:00,916
Sam: Oh, no.

1486
03:11:06,547 --> 03:11:08,549
What do I do? What do we do?

1487
03:11:11,427 --> 03:11:12,803
Frodo: Hit me. Sam: What?

1488
03:11:12,886 --> 03:11:15,055
Frodo:
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1489
03:11:15,139 --> 03:11:16,724
Sam: Get off of me!

1490
03:11:17,391 --> 03:11:19,727
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1491
03:11:28,402 --> 03:11:30,404
Get off of me!

1492
03:11:31,363 --> 03:11:33,240
Break it up! Break it up!

1493
03:11:35,784 --> 03:11:40,456
Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't
shut this rabble down!

1494
03:11:40,539 --> 03:11:42,916
Frodo: Go, Sam. Now!

1495
03:11:51,800 --> 03:11:53,427
Move along, scum!

1496
03:11:53,510 --> 03:11:55,429
Back in the line!

1497
03:11:55,929 --> 03:11:57,765
You maggots!

1498
03:11:58,432 --> 03:12:01,435
Get back into the line,
you slugs!

1499
03:12:03,812 --> 03:12:07,274
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1500
03:12:09,985 --> 03:12:11,945
Move it!

1501
03:12:56,073 --> 03:12:58,200
I can't...

1502
03:12:58,283 --> 03:13:02,037
I can't...
I can't manage the ring, Sam.

1503
03:13:02,287 --> 03:13:03,414
It's... it's...

1504
03:13:03,497 --> 03:13:06,166
It's such a weight to carry.

1505
03:13:08,210 --> 03:13:10,170
Such a weight.

1506
03:13:15,175 --> 03:13:17,636
We're going that way.
Straight as we can.

1507
03:13:19,054 --> 03:13:22,182
There's no point carrying anything
we're not sure to need.

1508
03:13:44,830 --> 03:13:46,665
There is light...

1509
03:13:46,999 --> 03:13:49,418
And beauty up there...

1510
03:13:49,501 --> 03:13:51,295
That no shadow can touch.

1511
03:14:42,346 --> 03:14:43,931
Take mine.

1512
03:14:44,431 --> 03:14:46,600
There's a few drops left.

1513
03:15:01,782 --> 03:15:04,409
There will be none left
for the return journey.

1514
03:15:05,285 --> 03:15:08,455
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1515
03:16:01,341 --> 03:16:03,510
Frodo, get down!

1516
03:16:25,198 --> 03:16:26,658
Where are they?

1517
03:17:02,736 --> 03:17:05,739
Let the lord of the black land come forth!

1518
03:17:06,698 --> 03:17:09,534
Letjustice be done upon him!

1519
03:17:53,036 --> 03:17:56,957
My master, Sauron the great,
bids thee welcome.

1520
03:18:02,796 --> 03:18:06,550
Is there any in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

1521
03:18:06,925 --> 03:18:10,053
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1522
03:18:10,137 --> 03:18:13,181
Faithless and accursed.

1523
03:18:13,265 --> 03:18:16,810
Tell your master this:
The armies of mordor must disband.

1524
03:18:16,893 --> 03:18:19,688
He is to depart these lands,
never to return.

1525
03:18:19,771 --> 03:18:23,150
Aha. Old greybeard.

1526
03:18:24,609 --> 03:18:28,864
I have a token I was bidden
to show thee.

1527
03:18:33,869 --> 03:18:35,203
Frodo.

1528
03:18:38,081 --> 03:18:39,499
Frodo.

1529
03:18:40,500 --> 03:18:41,710
- Silence.
- No!

1530
03:18:42,586 --> 03:18:43,879
Silence!

1531
03:18:45,672 --> 03:18:49,468
The halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1532
03:18:50,469 --> 03:18:54,556
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

1533
03:19:00,020 --> 03:19:05,817
Who would've thought one so small
could endure so much pain?

1534
03:19:08,403 --> 03:19:10,572
And he did, Gandalf.

1535
03:19:19,498 --> 03:19:21,041
And who is this?

1536
03:19:21,124 --> 03:19:23,251
Isildur's heir?

1537
03:19:23,335 --> 03:19:26,379
It takes more to make a king
than a broken elvish blade.

1538
03:19:31,176 --> 03:19:33,720
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1539
03:19:35,889 --> 03:19:37,057
I do not believe it.

1540
03:19:39,059 --> 03:19:40,352
I will not.

1541
03:20:12,926 --> 03:20:14,928
Sam: It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1542
03:20:17,430 --> 03:20:20,475
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

1543
03:20:20,559 --> 03:20:22,435
Something's drawn its gaze.

1544
03:20:39,953 --> 03:20:42,706
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1545
03:20:44,791 --> 03:20:48,795
Sons of gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1546
03:20:51,631 --> 03:20:53,508
I see in your eyes...

1547
03:20:53,925 --> 03:20:57,971
The same fear that would take
the heart of me.

1548
03:20:59,931 --> 03:21:03,852
A day may come
when the courage of men fails...

1549
03:21:03,935 --> 03:21:07,355
When we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

1550
03:21:07,439 --> 03:21:10,150
But it is not this day.

1551
03:21:10,442 --> 03:21:13,528
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

1552
03:21:13,612 --> 03:21:16,531
When the age of men
comes crashing down.

1553
03:21:16,615 --> 03:21:19,201
But it is not this day.

1554
03:21:19,284 --> 03:21:20,994
This day we fight!

1555
03:21:23,455 --> 03:21:27,167
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

1556
03:21:27,250 --> 03:21:31,504
I bid you stand, men of the west!

1557
03:22:59,968 --> 03:23:03,555
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an elf.

1558
03:23:03,972 --> 03:23:06,349
What about side by side with a friend?

1559
03:23:44,596 --> 03:23:46,639
Do you remember the shire,
Mr. Frodo?

1560
03:23:49,642 --> 03:23:51,895
It'll be spring soon.

1561
03:23:52,645 --> 03:23:55,398
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1562
03:23:55,482 --> 03:23:59,194
And the birds will be nesting
in the Hazel thicket.

1563
03:24:00,612 --> 03:24:04,616
And they'll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields...

1564
03:24:05,658 --> 03:24:09,996
And eating the first
of the strawberries with cream.

1565
03:24:11,956 --> 03:24:14,459
Do you remember
the taste of strawberries?

1566
03:24:16,002 --> 03:24:17,796
No, Sam.

1567
03:24:17,879 --> 03:24:20,840
I can't recall the taste of food...

1568
03:24:22,008 --> 03:24:25,345
Nor the sound of water...

1569
03:24:25,428 --> 03:24:29,015
Nor the touch of grass.

1570
03:24:32,435 --> 03:24:33,812
Naked in the dark.

1571
03:24:35,480 --> 03:24:37,816
There's... there's nothing.

1572
03:24:37,899 --> 03:24:42,654
No veil between me
and the wheel of fire.

1573
03:24:43,863 --> 03:24:45,824
I can see him...

1574
03:24:46,199 --> 03:24:47,867
With my waking eyes.

1575
03:24:48,952 --> 03:24:51,371
Then let us be rid of it...

1576
03:24:51,996 --> 03:24:54,207
Once and for all.

1577
03:24:54,958 --> 03:24:57,085
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1578
03:24:57,168 --> 03:24:59,838
I can't carry it for you...

1579
03:25:00,213 --> 03:25:02,257
But I can carry you.

1580
03:25:02,841 --> 03:25:04,551
Come on!

1581
03:25:34,998 --> 03:25:37,917
Sau Ron: Aragorn.

1582
03:25:49,512 --> 03:25:52,098
Elessar.

1583
03:26:04,110 --> 03:26:06,529
For Frodo.

1584
03:26:41,481 --> 03:26:42,982
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1585
03:26:43,650 --> 03:26:45,860
A doonnay.

1586
03:26:46,486 --> 03:26:48,154
We're almost there.

1587
03:26:50,490 --> 03:26:54,452
Clever hobbits to climb so high!

1588
03:27:08,341 --> 03:27:10,009
Mustn't go that way.

1589
03:27:11,594 --> 03:27:14,055
Mustn't hurt the precious.

1590
03:27:14,138 --> 03:27:16,015
You swore!

1591
03:27:16,099 --> 03:27:18,184
You swore on the precious!

1592
03:27:20,103 --> 03:27:22,021
Sméagol promised!

1593
03:27:22,981 --> 03:27:24,983
Sméagol lied.

1594
03:28:46,439 --> 03:28:48,232
Eagles.

1595
03:28:49,609 --> 03:28:51,110
The eagles are coming!

1596
03:29:21,099 --> 03:29:22,350
I'm here, Sam.

1597
03:29:29,816 --> 03:29:31,484
Destroy it!

1598
03:29:41,994 --> 03:29:45,373
Go on! Now!

1599
03:29:45,456 --> 03:29:48,042
Throw it in the fire!

1600
03:30:01,389 --> 03:30:04,058
What are you waiting for?

1601
03:30:05,977 --> 03:30:08,354
Just let it go!

1602
03:30:41,554 --> 03:30:43,806
The ring is mine.

1603
03:32:46,304 --> 03:32:48,180
Gollum: Yes!

1604
03:32:52,184 --> 03:32:55,104
Precious! Precious!

1605
03:32:55,187 --> 03:32:58,107
Precious! Precious!

1606
03:33:51,369 --> 03:33:53,204
Give me your hand!

1607
03:34:01,545 --> 03:34:03,923
Take my hand!

1608
03:34:15,226 --> 03:34:17,144
Don't you let go.

1609
03:34:21,774 --> 03:34:23,317
Don't let go.

1610
03:37:23,455 --> 03:37:25,291
It's gone.

1611
03:37:29,753 --> 03:37:31,463
It's done.

1612
03:37:31,964 --> 03:37:33,966
Sam: Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1613
03:37:35,342 --> 03:37:37,803
It's over now.

1614
03:38:03,454 --> 03:38:05,831
I can see the shire.

1615
03:38:08,000 --> 03:38:10,336
The brandywine river.

1616
03:38:12,504 --> 03:38:14,506
Bag end.

1617
03:38:16,842 --> 03:38:19,511
Gandalf's fireworks.

1618
03:38:19,970 --> 03:38:23,682
The lights in the party tree.

1619
03:38:25,184 --> 03:38:28,354
Rosie cotton dancing.

1620
03:38:29,480 --> 03:38:32,191
She had ribbons in her hair.

1621
03:38:35,069 --> 03:38:38,030
If ever I was to marry someone...

1622
03:38:38,989 --> 03:38:41,200
It would've been her.

1623
03:38:42,660 --> 03:38:44,703
It would've been her.

1624
03:38:56,882 --> 03:39:00,052
I'm glad to be with you,
samwise gamgee...

1625
03:39:04,390 --> 03:39:07,309
Here at the end of all things.

1626
03:41:40,462 --> 03:41:42,256
Gimli!

1627
03:43:25,275 --> 03:43:28,987
Now come the days of the king.

1628
03:43:33,992 --> 03:43:36,328
May they be blessed.

1629
03:43:56,640 --> 03:43:59,351
This day does not belong to one man...

1630
03:43:59,434 --> 03:44:01,353
But to all.

1631
03:44:03,021 --> 03:44:05,983
Let us together rebuild this world...

1632
03:44:06,066 --> 03:44:10,362
That we may share
in the days of peace.

1633
03:46:44,850 --> 03:46:46,893
My friends...

1634
03:46:52,190 --> 03:46:54,860
You bow to no one.

1635
03:47:39,070 --> 03:47:41,239
Frodo: And thus it was.

1636
03:47:41,323 --> 03:47:44,993
A fourth age of middle-earth began.

1637
03:47:45,076 --> 03:47:47,746
And the fellowship of the ring...

1638
03:47:47,829 --> 03:47:52,417
Though eternally bound
by friendship and love...

1639
03:47:52,501 --> 03:47:54,920
Was ended.

1640
03:47:59,925 --> 03:48:04,805
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey...

1641
03:48:04,888 --> 03:48:09,100
We found ourselves
looking upon a familiar sight.

1642
03:48:11,645 --> 03:48:14,397
We were home.

1643
03:48:39,965 --> 03:48:42,175
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1644
03:49:30,181 --> 03:49:31,892
Male patron:
More of the same, Rosie.

1645
03:49:31,975 --> 03:49:34,019
Good night, lads.

1646
03:50:18,563 --> 03:50:20,023
Pippin:

1647
03:50:31,576 --> 03:50:35,580
Frodo: How do you pick up the threads
of an old life?

1648
03:50:36,915 --> 03:50:39,167
How do you go on...

1649
03:50:39,250 --> 03:50:44,547
When in your heart
you begin to understand...

1650
03:50:45,757 --> 03:50:48,760
There is no going back?

1651
03:50:49,427 --> 03:50:53,098
There are some things
that time cannot mend...

1652
03:50:53,598 --> 03:50:56,559
Some hurts that go too deep...

1653
03:50:58,269 --> 03:51:01,106
That have taken hold.

1654
03:51:39,310 --> 03:51:41,146
Sam: Mr. Frodo?

1655
03:51:44,482 --> 03:51:45,859
What is it?

1656
03:51:47,694 --> 03:51:51,656
It's been four years to the day
since weathertop, Sam.

1657
03:51:52,323 --> 03:51:55,076
It's never really healed.

1658
03:51:58,997 --> 03:52:04,294
"There and back again: A hobbit's tale
by bilbo Baggins.

1659
03:52:05,003 --> 03:52:08,840
And the lord of the rings
by Frodo Baggins."

1660
03:52:14,345 --> 03:52:15,847
Frodo: Not quite.

1661
03:52:16,681 --> 03:52:19,184
There's room for a little more.

1662
03:52:21,853 --> 03:52:26,107
Frodo: Bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end...

1663
03:52:26,191 --> 03:52:29,527
That each of us must come and go
in the telling.

1664
03:52:30,403 --> 03:52:33,239
Bilbo's story was now over.

1665
03:52:33,740 --> 03:52:36,743
There would be no more journeys
for him...

1666
03:52:39,162 --> 03:52:42,749
Bilbo:
Tell me again, lad, where are we going?

1667
03:52:42,832 --> 03:52:44,918
Frodo: To the harbor, bilbo.

1668
03:52:45,001 --> 03:52:47,796
The elves have accorded you
a special honor...

1669
03:52:47,879 --> 03:52:50,548
A place on the last ship
to leave middle-earth.

1670
03:52:52,258 --> 03:52:53,927
Frodo...

1671
03:52:55,386 --> 03:52:59,891
Any chance of seeing
that old ring of mine again?

1672
03:53:00,558 --> 03:53:02,769
The one I gave you.

1673
03:53:06,397 --> 03:53:08,566
I'm sorry, uncle.

1674
03:53:11,152 --> 03:53:13,780
I'm afraid I lost it.

1675
03:53:16,366 --> 03:53:17,784
Pity.

1676
03:53:20,578 --> 03:53:24,415
I should like to have held it
one last time.

1677
03:53:49,399 --> 03:53:51,067
Oh!

1678
03:53:53,611 --> 03:53:58,616
Well, here's a sight
I have never seen before.

1679
03:54:12,797 --> 03:54:16,134
The power of the three rings is ended.

1680
03:54:16,968 --> 03:54:19,804
The time has come...

1681
03:54:19,888 --> 03:54:23,224
For the dominion of men.

1682
03:54:37,906 --> 03:54:42,327
Quite ready
for another adventure.

1683
03:55:13,358 --> 03:55:15,735
Farewell...

1684
03:55:15,818 --> 03:55:18,571
My brave hobbits.

1685
03:55:20,531 --> 03:55:22,533
My work is now finished.

1686
03:55:26,496 --> 03:55:31,376
Here at last,
on the shores of the sea...

1687
03:55:32,043 --> 03:55:34,879
Comes the end of our fellowship.

1688
03:55:38,383 --> 03:55:40,885
I will not say, "do not weep"...

1689
03:55:41,552 --> 03:55:45,556
For not all tears are an evil.

1690
03:56:03,116 --> 03:56:05,076
It is time, Frodo.

1691
03:56:10,581 --> 03:56:12,583
Sam: What does he mean?

1692
03:56:15,086 --> 03:56:17,922
We set out to save the shire, Sam.

1693
03:56:19,549 --> 03:56:22,260
And it has been saved.

1694
03:56:25,930 --> 03:56:28,599
But not for me.

1695
03:56:29,559 --> 03:56:31,978
You don't mean that.

1696
03:56:33,229 --> 03:56:35,273
You can't leave.

1697
03:56:43,781 --> 03:56:46,451
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1698
04:00:19,580 --> 04:00:22,458
Frodo: My dear Sam:

1699
04:00:24,335 --> 04:00:27,713
You cannot always be torn in two.

1700
04:00:27,797 --> 04:00:32,009
You will have to be one and whole
for many years.

1701
04:00:32,718 --> 04:00:38,182
You have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do.

1702
04:00:39,475 --> 04:00:42,645
Your part in the story will go on.

1703
04:00:43,354 --> 04:00:45,147
Well...

1704
04:00:47,024 --> 04:00:48,693
I'm back.

1705
04:02:31,253 --> 04:02:35,299
Lay down

1706
04:02:36,926 --> 04:02:41,305
your sweet and weary head

1707
04:02:43,015 --> 04:02:46,644
night is falling

1708
04:02:47,311 --> 04:02:52,149
you have come to journey's end

1709
04:02:52,817 --> 04:02:56,612
sleep now

1710
04:02:56,696 --> 04:03:02,368
and dream
of the ones who came before

1711
04:03:04,161 --> 04:03:08,124
they are calling

1712
04:03:08,207 --> 04:03:12,336
from across the distant shore

1713
04:03:13,963 --> 04:03:18,884
why do you weep?

1714
04:03:18,968 --> 04:03:24,056
What are these tears
upon your face?

1715
04:03:24,140 --> 04:03:29,270
Soon you will see

1716
04:03:29,353 --> 04:03:34,400
all of your fears will pass away

1717
04:03:34,483 --> 04:03:39,697
safe in my arms

1718
04:03:39,780 --> 04:03:44,368
you're only sleeping

1719
04:03:44,452 --> 04:03:49,540
what can you see

1720
04:03:49,623 --> 04:03:54,920
on the horizon?

1721
04:03:55,004 --> 04:03:59,592
Why do the white gulls

1722
04:04:05,598 --> 04:04:10,269
Across the sea

1723
04:04:10,352 --> 04:04:15,733
a pale moon rises

1724
04:04:15,816 --> 04:04:18,611
the ships have come

1725
04:04:18,694 --> 04:04:24,533
to carry you home

1726
04:04:26,744 --> 04:04:31,332
and all will turn

1727
04:04:31,415 --> 04:04:36,837
to silver glass

1728
04:04:36,921 --> 04:04:41,300
a light on the water

1729
04:04:41,383 --> 04:04:46,972
all souls pass

1730
04:04:47,056 --> 04:04:51,268
hope fades

1731
04:04:52,853 --> 04:04:57,775
into the world of night

1732
04:04:58,442 --> 04:05:02,279
through shadows falling

1733
04:05:03,113 --> 04:05:08,285
out of memory and time

1734
04:05:08,953 --> 04:05:12,665
don't say

1735
04:05:13,457 --> 04:05:18,462
we have come now to the end

1736
04:05:19,296 --> 04:05:23,801
white shores are calling

1737
04:05:23,884 --> 04:05:27,513
you and I will meet again

1738
04:05:27,596 --> 04:05:34,103
and you'll be here in my arms

1739
04:05:35,312 --> 04:05:39,400
just sleeping

1740
04:05:39,483 --> 04:05:44,405
what can you see

1741
04:05:44,488 --> 04:05:49,535
on the horizon?

1742
04:05:49,618 --> 04:05:54,540
Why do the white gulls

1743
04:06:00,170 --> 04:06:05,384
Across the sea

1744
04:06:05,467 --> 04:06:10,556
a pale moon rises

1745
04:06:10,639 --> 04:06:13,517
the ships have come

1746
04:06:13,601 --> 04:06:19,982
to carry you home

1747
04:06:21,191 --> 04:06:26,322
and all will turn

1748
04:06:26,864 --> 04:06:31,744
to silver glass

1749
04:06:31,827 --> 04:06:36,081
a light on the water

1750
04:06:36,165 --> 04:06:40,085
grey ships pass
