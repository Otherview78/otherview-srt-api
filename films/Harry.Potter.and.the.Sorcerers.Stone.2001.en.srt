00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,230
I should have known you would be here
Professor McGonagall

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,037
Goose Night Professor Dumbledore

4
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,318
Are the rumors true, Albus?

5
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,554
I'm afraid so Professor.
Both the good and the bad...

6
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,877
And the boy?
Hagrid takes him with him

7
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,874
Do you think it is wise to entrust
something so important to Hagrid?

8
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,070
Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.

9
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,119
Professor Dumbledore,
Professor McGonagall...

10
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,029
There was no problem I hope?
No, sir.

11
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,518
The little one fell asleep when we flew over Bristol

12
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,669
So I let him sleep...

13
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,431
Here you go

14
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,997
Albus, do you think it's safe to
leave him here with these people?

15
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,228
I have been observing them all day,
they are the worst Muggles imaginable

16
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,268
They really are...
They are the only family he has

17
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,230
This boy will be famous,
every child will know who he is

18
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,118
Precisely...

19
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,438
He's better off without all that...

20
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,439
Until he is ready

21
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,239
There you go, Hagrid.
It's not goodbye after all

22
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,033
Good luck to you...

23
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,069
Harry Potter

24
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,798
Get up! Step up...

25
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,753
Now!

26
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,111
Get up Potter, we're going to the zoo!

27
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,914
Get up Potter, we're going to the zoo!
Congratulations, my boy

28
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,717
Finish your breakfast,
and try not to burn anything

29
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,675
Yes, Aunt Petunia
I want everything to be perfect on

30
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,678
...my little Dudley's big day

31
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,670
Bring me my coffee, boy!
Yes Uncle Vernon

32
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,832
Aren't they beautiful, my darling?

33
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,276
How many are there?
36, I counted them myself.

34
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,552
36! But last year I got 37!!!

35
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,469
But some packages are bigger than last year
I don't care how big they are!

36
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,069
Wait, wait, you know what we do...

37
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,478
When we go out, we buy
two more presents, my dear

38
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,753
It will be a good day at the zoo.

39
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,672
I'm warning you now, son...
If you do anything stupid...

40
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,236
If you do something stupid...

41
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,352
In general... How to smoke
all your meals for a week

42
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,752
Jump in!

43
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,949
Get him moving

44
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,158
-Get moving!

45
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,755
Move it!!!
He's asleep!

46
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,394
He is boring

47
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,119
Ignore him

48
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,869
He does not understand how it feels

49
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,069
to lie there day after day,
while people stare at you

50
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,280
Can you hear me?

51
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,559
It's just that... I've
never talked to a snake before

52
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,353
Are you talking about

53
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,519
Often with people?

54
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,751
You are from Burma, right? Was it nice there?

55
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,155
Do you miss your family?

56
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,436
I understand, I didn't know my parents either

57
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,430
Mother! Father! Come and see the snake!

58
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,511
Thanks to

59
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,073
There was so little

60
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,111
A snake!

61
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,157
Momaaa!!!

62
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,392
But Dudley! How did you get in there?!

63
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,749
What happened?
I don't know, I swear!

64
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,514
It's ok.
We need to get you out of these cold clothes.

65
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,998
What happened?
I swear I don't know!

66
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,909
First the glass was there, then it disappeared...
It was like magic!

67
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,833
Magic does not exist!

68
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,680
HARRY POTTER THE CUPBOARD UNDER THE STAIRS

69
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,952
Let's see! Harry has received a letter
Give it to me, it's mine!

70
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,799
Yours? -Who would write to you?

71
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,157
No more letters in this mailbox

72
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,559
Have a nice day at work, my dear

73
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,880
Go now

74
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,473
Nice day, Sunday

75
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,551
The best day of the week in my opinion

76
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,992
You know why, Dudley?
There is no mail on Sundays.

77
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,839
Absolutely right Harry!
No mail on Sundays. -Ha!

78
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,275
No damned letters today!
No, not a single one...

79
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,069
No cursed letters...

80
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,236
Give it to me!
Give me that letter!

81
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,593
Mom, what's going on?

82
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,032
Those are my letters!
Let go of me!

83
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,232
Let go of me!

84
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,833
Those are my letters!
Let go of me!

85
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,518
That's enough! We are traveling far away,
where they can't find us!

86
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,675
We travel far away,
where they cannot find us!

87
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,997
Daddy has gone mad, hasn't he?

88
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,675
Make a wish Harry

89
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,076
Who is there?

90
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,069
Pardon my entrance.

91
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,071
I demand that you leave.
This is trespassing!

92
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,559
Relax, Dursley, you old fart!

93
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,916
I haven't seen you since you were a little baby.

94
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,477
Harry.
You've grown a lot. Especially around the belly

95
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,399
I... I am not Harry

96
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,709
I am...
Of course you are!

97
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,993
I have something for you

98
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,558
I think I've mashed it a bit
but the taste is probably the same

99
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,236
I have written the text myself

100
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,549
Thank you.

101
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,759
It's not every day you turn 11, is it?

102
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,279
Excuse me... but who are you?

103
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,190
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of the Keys
and estate manager at Hogwarts.

104
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,989
But you know all about Hogwarts.
No, I don't.

105
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,270
Not ... ? Then how do you think
your mother and father learned everything?

106
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,839
Learned what?

107
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,474
You are a wizard Harry

108
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,596
I am a what?
A magician!

109
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,712
And a powerful one at that,
with a little practice.

110
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,713
No, you're probably wrong

111
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,798
I cannot be a T-wizard.

112
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,991
I'm just Harry

113
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,874
...just Harry? Well, "Just Harry," you've never
had anything strange happen

114
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,551
Something you could not explain
when you were angry or scared?

115
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,272
Dear Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you
...that you have been admitted to the

116
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,597
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

117
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,555
No he can't go! We don't want to hear about
any more of this nonsense!

118
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,799
You knew that? You knew all along
and you didn't tell me?

119
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,958
Of course we knew that!

120
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,709
How could we avoid it when my
"perfect" sister was who she was.

121
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,631
Her mother and father were so proud when she got her letter.

122
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,833
We have a witch in the family,
isn't that amazing?

123
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,555
I was the only one who saw what she really was.

124
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,432
A freak!

125
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,473
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

126
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,152
Then she met that Potter and had you,
and I knew you would be the same...

127
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,150
And then, you can imagine, she went and got
blown up, and we got you on the neck!

128
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,194
Blown up in a car crash?
You said my parents died in a car accident!

129
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,558
A car accident? Lilly and James Potter dead in a car accident?
car accident?!

130
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,514
It is nonsense! It is a scandal!

131
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,075
He can't leave!

132
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,477
Do you think a Muggle like you can stop him?

133
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,629
"Muggles?

134
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,794
People without magic powers...Ever since he was born
he has been destined for...

135
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,709
to attend the best wizarding school in the country.

136
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,597
And... be trained by one of
Hogwarts' finest wizards, Albus Dumbledore.

137
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,396
I'm not paying some idiot
to teach him magic!

138
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,957
Never insult
Albus Dumbledore

139
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,116
in front of me.

140
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,308
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
to anyone at Hogwarts about it.

141
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,473
I'm not really allowed to use magic.
Ok

142
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,598
We are a little behind schedule,
we have to go.

143
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,592
Unless you'd rather stay here, of course?

144
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,471
Each student must have with them

145
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,478
a standard-sized tin cauldron.

146
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:55,232
And they can also bring
an owl, a cat or a toad

147
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,948
Can we find all that in London?

148
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,435
If you know where to go.

149
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,113
Oh! Hagrid, the usual?

150
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,029
No thanks, I'm on official
mission for Hogwarts

151
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,198
I help Harry with
buying study materials.

152
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,830
My goodness... it's Harry Potter!

153
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,270
Welcome back Mr. Potter.

154
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,632
Doris Crawford, Mr. Potter.
I can't believe I finally get to meet you.

155
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,108
Harry P-Po-Potter. It is truly an
honor to meet you.

156
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,754
Hello Professor! I didn't see you at first.

157
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,750
Harry it's Professor Quirrel.

158
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,269
Nice to meet you.

159
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,478
He will be your teacher in
"Defense Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts.

160
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,117
Not f-because you need it, right Potter?

161
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,993
We need to move on...

162
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,872
Goodbye

163
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,916
See Harry there? You're famous.
But why am I famous, Hagrid?

164
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,430
How is it that they know who I am?

165
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,269
I am probably not the right person to tell Harry.

166
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,195
Welcome to Diagon Alley Harry.

167
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,269
They have paper and pencils!

168
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,274
They only have magic items.

169
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,189
Wow, look at that! The new Nimbus 2000.

170
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,591
The fastest model....

171
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,551
But Hagrid, how can I pay?
I don't have any money, do I?

172
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,991
There's your money, Harry!
Gringotts. -The magic bank.

173
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,479
There is no safer place,
except Hogwarts.

174
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,434
Hagrid, what are those people?

175
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,668
"Black elves" - Quite cunning
and not very friendly.

176
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,757
You better stay close to me.

177
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,155
Harry Potter wishes to make some withdrawals.

178
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,237
And does Harry Potter have his key?

179
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,232
One moment... I have it here somewhere.

180
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,679
Ha! Here is the little rascal.

181
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,633
Just one more thing...

182
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,037
Professor Dumbledore gave me this

183
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,789
It is about, you probably know "what"
in the vault, you probably know "which"

184
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,917
Excellent.

185
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,639
Valve 687.

186
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,675
The lamp, please.

187
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,114
The key, please.

188
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,195
You didn't think your parents
would leave you empty-handed?

189
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,989
Vault 713
What's in it, Hagrid?

190
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,193
Can't tell you about it.
Hogwarts business, very secret.

191
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,919
Move backwards

192
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,713
Better not mention this to anyone, Harry.

193
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,554
I still need... a magic wand

194
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,036
A magic wand? Go to Ollivanders.
There is no better place.

195
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,635
You slip in there for a moment,
and I'll run a quick errand

196
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,632
Hello?

197
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,232
Hello?

198
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,718
I was wondering when I would
see you, Mr. Potter.

199
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,316
It feels like it was just yesterday your

200
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:45,157
parents bought their first magic wand.

201
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,755
Let's see.

202
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,434
Wave it around!

203
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,074
Obviously not the

204
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,316
Maybe...

205
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,990
This one

206
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,197
No, no... definitely not

207
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,678
I wonder...

208
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,875
Strange.

209
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,878
very strange

210
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,072
What is strange?

211
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,871
I can remember all the ones I have sold,
and now it happens to be so-r.

212
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,719
-that the phoenix whose
tail feather is in your staff

213
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,436
Tail feather is in your wand.
left behind one more feather...just one more.

214
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,798
just one more.

215
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,152
It's strange that you decided to do this.

216
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,838
When its brother gave you that scar.

217
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,672
And who owns that staff?

218
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,789
We do not mention his name.

219
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,596
The wand chooses its wizard Mr. Potter.

220
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,678
It is often not known why.

221
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,396
But I think it is fairly certain
that

222
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,354
you will do great things.

223
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,633
The "he" we should not mention

224
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,440
accomplished great things?

225
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,551
Terrible ...

226
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,117
Yes! But magnificent.

227
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,476
Harry! Harry!

228
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,115
Happy birthday to you!

229
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,316
Are you okay, Harry?

230
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:49,038
He killed my parents, right?
The one who gave me the scar.

231
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,710
You know that, Hagrid. I know you do.

232
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,797
It is important that you understand this.

233
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,434
Not all wizards are good

234
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,029
Some of them turn evil.
A few years ago it was

235
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,030
a wizard who became as evil
as you can possibly get.

236
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,710
His name was V...
Can't you write it?

237
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,717
No I can't spell it.

238
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,993
Well, then... Voldemort
Voldemort?

239
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,950
Those were dark times Harry.

240
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,152
Voldemort gathered companions".

241
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,597
with him to the Dark Side.

242
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,912
He killed anyone who resisted.

243
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,912
Your parents fought against him.

244
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,749
But no one he had decided to kill
to kill, survived....

245
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,428
None.

246
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,915
Besides you...

247
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,799
Me? Did Voldemort try to kill... me?

248
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,233
That's no ordinary scar
you have there on your forehead Harry

249
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,038
Such a mark is only given by
a very strong and evil curse.

250
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,710
What happened to... "You know who"?

251
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,031
Some say he is dead.

252
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,549
Silly nonsense in my opinion.

253
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,877
No he is still somewhere
out there,

254
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,913
too weak to continue...

255
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,319
But one thing is for sure, there was something about
you that knocked him out that night

256
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,633
That's why you're famous,
that's why everyone knows about you.

257
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,595
You are the boy who survived.

258
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,154
What are you looking at?

259
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,751
Damn, is that the time?

260
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,794
I have to run Harry!
Dumbledore is waiting for

261
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,676
Uh... wait for me. Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

262
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,000
Here is your ticket. Do not lose it. It's important,
so don't lose it!

263
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,910
Perrong 9 3/4?

264
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,716
But Hagrid, there must be something wrong

265
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,117
It says platform 9 3/4
but there isn't one, is there?

266
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,393
I beg your pardon

267
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,479
Excuse me for a moment

268
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,159
On your left.

269
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,029
Excuse me but can you tell me where
I can find platform 9 3/4?

270
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,674
9 3/4 - Are you trying to make fun of me?

271
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,077
It's like this every year,
filled with Muggles. Let's go, come on!

272
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,751
Muggles?
Platform 9 3/4 this way!

273
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,237
Okay Percy, you first

274
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,949
Fred, now it's your turn

275
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,709
He is not Fred, I am Fred!
And you call yourself our mother?

276
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,797
I'm sorry, George.

277
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,069
Excuse me, George.

278
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,108
Excuse me!

279
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,833
Can you tell me... How to...

280
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,430
How to get to the platform?
Don't worry

281
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,995
It's Ron's first trip to Hogwarts too.

282
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,877
All you need to do is
walk straight into the wall between platforms 9 and 10

283
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,390
Better run, if you're nervous.
Good luck to you!

284
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,713
I beg your pardon? Do you mind
me sitting here? The others are full.

285
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,036
Not at all

286
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,309
I am Ron, Ron Weasley

287
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,074
I am Harry, Harry Potter.

288
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,356
It is true!

289
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,233
I mean, do you really have a...

290
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,553
A what?
A scar?

291
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,716
Awesome!

292
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,029
Anything from the kiosk cart?
No, thanks, I'm fine. I have my own with me.

293
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,115
We take it all

294
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,996
Bertie's multi-flavor beans?
They come in all flavors

295
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,631
There is chocolate and peppermint,

296
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,515
spinach, liver and cumin.

297
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,713
George thinks he got
a booger-flavored one once.

298
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:17,320
They're not real frogs, are they?
Just magic, besides it's the card you want

299
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,753
Each pack features a famous witch or wizard.

300
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,395
Watch out!

301
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,949
What bad luck! I myself only have
one who is good at jumping.

302
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,474
I got Dumbledore
I have 6 of him

303
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,639
-He's gone!

304
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,150
You didn't think
he would hang around here all day?

305
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,752
These are Scabbers by the way. Pathetic, huh?

306
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,075
A little bit

307
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,477
-Fred gave me a spell that turns him yellow.
You want to see?

308
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,636
Yes!

309
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,678
Has anyone seen a toad?

310
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,600
- A boy called Neville has lost one.
- No, he didn't.

311
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,312
Oh! Are you doing magic! Let's have a look.

312
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,472
"Daisy, sunshine, nice smooth butter.
This stupid,"

313
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,678
fat rat yellow now do

314
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,713
Are you sure it's a real spell?
It wasn't very good, was it?

315
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,037
I have only tried a few simple ones
myself, and they always work for me.

316
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,754
and they always work for me.

317
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,196
For example,

318
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,233
Oculus Reparus.

319
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,754
That's better, right?

320
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,634
Oh my goodness! You're Harry Potter!

321
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,276
I am Hermione Granger,
and you are... ?

322
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,032
I am Ron Weasley
Pleased to meet you...

323
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,109
You two should probably get changed.
I think we're almost there.

324
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,390
You have dirt on your nose, by the way.
Did you know that?

325
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,477
Right there.

326
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,949
All first year students this way!

327
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,154
Let's go! First-year students.
Hurry up!

328
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,713
Hi Harry
Hi Hagrid

329
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,912
Come on, this way to the boats.
Follow me!

330
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,478
Fantastic!

331
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,630
Welcome to Hogwarts!

332
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,674
In a moment you will

333
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,715
but first you will be divided into your dormitories

334
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,912
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,

335
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,398
Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

336
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,635
While you are here, your
dormitories will be your family.

337
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,596
Your triumphs will earn you points.

338
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,759
Your achievements will earn you points,
and violations will deduct points.

339
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,034
At the end of the year, the school with the
most points will win the Pupil Accommodation Cup.

340
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,508
Trevor!

341
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,638
I beg your pardon

342
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,628
The sorting ceremony
will begin in a moment.

343
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,117
So it's true what I heard...

344
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,034
Harry Potter has arrived at Hogwarts.

345
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,593
Harry Potter?

346
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,760
This is Crabbe and Goyle,

347
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,155
and I am Malfoy

348
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,710
Draco Malfoy.

349
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,036
Do you think my name is funny?
Then I can ask for yours!

350
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,792
Red hair and a torn coat...
You must be a Weasley.

351
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,559
You soon discover, that some
families are better than others.

352
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,389
And you should not associate with the wrong kind.

353
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,670
I can help you with that.

354
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,475
I think I can tell which
variety is wrong myself, thanks!

355
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,996
We are ready now. Please follow me.

356
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,152
It is actually just a roof
with an enchanted night sky.

357
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,233
I've read about it in "Hogwarts History.

358
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,679
Can you wait here, please?

359
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,713
Before we begin, we want to

360
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,037
Professor
Dumbledore say a few words.

361
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,836
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

362
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,236
I have a few practical details.

363
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:48,277
Note this.
The Dark Forest is forbidden to all students.

364
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,799
And our caretaker,
Mr. Filch would like to remind you

365
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,437
-that the corridor to the right on the
third floor is closed off

366
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,759
for anyone who does not wish to suffer
a very painful death.

367
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,957
Thank you.

368
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,553
When I call out your names, you come forward.

369
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,230
I will put my hat on my head

370
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,512
and you will be assigned to your dormitories

371
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,234
Hermione Granger.

372
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,914
Okay, relax.

373
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,511
She has a screw loose.

374
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,469
Well, yes...

375
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,116
Okay. Gryffindor!

376
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,233
Draco Malfoy.

377
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,716
Slytherin!

378
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,438
It's only the slimy ones
who are in Slytherin.

379
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,074
Susan Bones.

380
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,316
Harry, what is it?

381
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,154
Nothing... I'm fine.

382
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,753
Let's see

383
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,152
I know... HUFFLEPUFF!!!

384
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,149
Ronald Weasley.

385
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,230
Another Weasley, I know exactly where you are going

386
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,115
Gryffindor!

387
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,469
Harry Potter.

388
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,678
Hmm, difficult, very difficult...

389
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,668
Lots of courage I see, no bad head
either.

390
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,075
There is talent.

391
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,955
and a strong desire to show
ability

392
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,230
But where should I put you?

393
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,189
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.

394
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,910
Not Slytherin, then? Are you sure about that?

395
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,796
You could be great, you know.

396
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,120
And Slytherin would help you on your way
towards greatness, there is no doubt about that

397
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,877
But if you are so sure

398
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,752
It better be...

399
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,837
...Gryffindor!

400
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,993
Your attention please

401
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,554
Let the party begin!

402
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,279
I am half of each.

403
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,597
Father is a Muggle, mother is a witch.

404
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,156
So it was a shock for him
when he found out.

405
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,749
Tell me Percy, who is the teacher
who talks to Professor Quirrel?

406
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,072
It's Professor Snape, Headmaster of Slytherin

407
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,111
What does he teach?
Potions

408
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,678
But his favorite subject is black arts.
He's been after Quirrel's job for years.

409
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,230
Hello there! How are you?

410
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,711
Welcome to Gryffindor!

411
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,789
Look! The Bloody Baron!

412
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,913
Hello Sir Nicholas, did you have a nice summer?

413
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,319
Once again I have been rejected
to participate in the Headless Hunt!

414
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,038
I know you!
You are Almost Headless Nick

415
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,879
I prefer to be called Sir Nicholas!
Thank you, sir.

416
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,436
Almost headless?
How can you be almost headless?

417
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,637
This is how!

418
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,915
Gryffindor, follow me.

419
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,272
Ravenclaw, you are coming with me.

420
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,717
This route takes you directly to your rooms

421
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,913
Watch the steps, they like to move around.

422
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:37,232
Keep moving forward and follow me

423
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,000
Look at that! ...the paintings are moving!

424
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,556
- Look at that one
- I think she likes you.

425
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,470
- Check it out
- Who is the girl?

426
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,114
Welcome to Hogwarts

427
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,993
password

428
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,113
Caput Draconis.

429
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,276
Come on... hurry up a bit

430
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,189
Gather here

431
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,991
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room

432
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,432
The boys' toilets are on the top right.
Girls' on the left

433
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,632
Your luggage is already checked in

434
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,598
We got him!

435
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:50,032
Imagine McGonagall's face,
if we were late.

436
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,915
- That was pretty damn cool!
- Thanks for the assignment.

437
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,238
Maybe it would be better if I turned you into a
a clock? So you could arrive on time!

438
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,512
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

439
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:11,238
We got lost - Maybe a map then?
I don't suppose you need one to find your seats?

440
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:24,518
There is no ridiculous waving
with wands during my lessons.

441
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,190
I do not expect that many of you will achieve full
understanding

442
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,989
of the beauty of these potions.

443
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,158
but on the other hand

444
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,237
I can teach you

445
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,911
to bewitch the mind

446
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,918
and mislead the senses....

447
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,554
I can teach you how to bottle reputation,

448
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,437
brews glory, even corks death.

449
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,996
Then maybe some of you have come to
Hogwarts with one of these

450
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:11,911
formidable knowledge that makes one so confident

451
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,953
that you are not paying attention!

452
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,148
Mr. Potter.

453
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,995
Our new ... celebrity

454
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:35,632
What do I get if I add crumbled
root of aphodilla to a decoction of wormwood?

455
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,069
Don't you know?
Let's try again

456
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,717
Where would you look if I asked you
to find me a bezoar?

457
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,279
I do not know...

458
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,235
And what is the difference between
a balaclava and a top hat?

459
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,830
I do not know...

460
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,108
Sin

461
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,799
So fame is not everything

462
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,193
Mr. Potter?

463
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:15,673
This water shall be turned
and become a cup of rum

464
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,200
What is Seamus trying to do with the water?
Turn it into rum.

465
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,956
He actually managed to
make some tea yesterday for...

466
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,231
Oh! The mail is here!

467
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,033
Can I borrow this?

468
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,916
Check it out! Neville has received a Remembrance Ball

469
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:19,399
I have read about them. They turn red,
when you've forgotten something.

470
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,957
The only problem is
I can't remember what I've forgotten?

471
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,516
Ron, there's been
a break-in at Gringotts.

472
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,235
"Listen, unknown sorcerers
or witches are believed to be behind...

473
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,952
Gringotts insists that nothing was stolen.

474
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:41,632
The vault in question, number 713
had already been emptied earlier that day.

475
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,913
It's the same vault that
Hagrid and I were in

476
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,075
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

477
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,953
Hello students
Hello Mrs. Hooch

478
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,555
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

479
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,514
Well, what are you waiting for?
Everyone stands to the left of their broom.

480
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:14,078
Hold your right hand over the broom and resign!

481
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,157
Get up!

482
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,310
Up.

483
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,512
Up.

484
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,678
Up, up, up. Up!

485
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,791
With feeling.

486
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,156
Shut up Harry.

487
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,837
Then I want you to sit on it.

488
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,874
Take a firm grip, so you don't slip off.

489
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,995
When I blow the whistle, I want you to
to stomp away from the ground.

490
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,875
Hold the broom firmly,
Float for a moment

491
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:58,198
and then lean forward
slightly, and then land again.

492
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,432
Ready? 3-2...

493
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,079
Mr. Longbottom.

494
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,273
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

495
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,674
Neville!

496
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,800
Come down immediately!

497
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,875
Get out of the way!

498
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,270
Is he ok?

499
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:03,078
Oh dear, a broken wrist.

500
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,791
Everyone stays on the ground, while I follow
Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing

501
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,515
I see a single broom in the air

502
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,748
the person sitting on it will
will get out of here

503
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,791
Did you see his face?

504
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,675
If he had this in his hand.
he would have landed on his fat ass.

505
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,269
Give me that, Malfoy.

506
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,629
No, I'll let Longbottom
get it himself.

507
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,995
What about up on the roof?

508
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,795
Something wrong, Potter?
Is it beyond your reach?

509
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,875
Harry! No, no, no, no! You heard what she said.

510
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,878
And you can't fly!

511
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,991
What an idiot!

512
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,590
Give it to me or I'll push you off the broom!

513
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,836
Oh, you do?

514
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,035
Okay, take it then!

515
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,910
Bravo Harry!
Well done!

516
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,076
Harry Potter!

517
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,911
Follow me

518
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,270
You wait here.

519
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:07,034
Professor Quirrel,
may I borrow Wood for a moment?

520
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,992
Yes, of course.

521
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:19,958
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I've found you a Seeker.

522
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,316
Harry Potter is the new Gryffindor seeker.

523
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,676
I knew he would do well

524
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,999
A seeker? But first-year students
have never been involved in the dormitory games

525
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,512
- You are the youngest player of this
century according to McGonagall.

526
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,234
Good luck Harry, Wood just told me.

527
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,829
Fred and George are the batsmen of the team.

528
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,589
Our job is to protect you.

529
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,360
Quidditch is a brutal game.
but no one has died in years.

530
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:52,348
Some have disappeared but

531
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,199
they'll turn up again!

532
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:00,833
Quidditch is a cool game Harry,
it'll be right up your street.

533
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,112
I've never played Quidditch.
What if I mess up?

534
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:09,116
You will not make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

535
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,995
Harry, you never told me that
your father was also a Seeker?

536
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,916
I did not know that.

537
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,631
It's scary! She knows
more about you than you do yourself!

538
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,035
Who doesn't?

539
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,956
What is happening?

540
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,199
The stairs sometimes change direction.

541
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,718
Come this way.
Before the stairs move again!

542
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,316
Do you also feel,
that we should not be here?

543
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,596
We MUST not be here!

544
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,554
This floor is forbidden!

545
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,193
Let's get out of here.

546
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,073
It's Filch's cat!
Run!

547
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,917
We are hiding behind that door!

548
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,796
It's locked!
We are now out of business

549
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,070
Get out of the way!

550
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,036
Alohomora!

551
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,711
In!

552
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,955
Alohomora?

553
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,594
Standard spells, chapter 7.

554
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,031
Is anyone here?

555
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:52,995
Come and join us.

556
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,195
He has gone

557
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,910
Wonder why the door was locked?

558
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:29,793
What are they thinking? To keep such a
such a monster locked up in a school?

559
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,515
You don't use your eyes, do you?
Did you not see what it said?

560
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:37,713
I did not look at its feet! I was
more concerned with its heads

561
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,673
Or did you not notice that there were three

562
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,395
It was sitting on a trapdoor

563
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,990
It is guarding something.
Guarding something?

564
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,995
I'm going to bed now,
before you come up with something else

565
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,670
that can kill us

566
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,872
or even worse... Get us suspended.

567
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,073
She needs to get her values in order
her values in order.

568
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:14,559
Quidditch is simple to understand.
Each team has 7 players.

569
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:20,232
Three hunters, two hitters,
one guard and one seeker - "you"

570
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:29,079
There are three balls.
This one is called the clone.

571
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:34,991
To score points, hunters must try to
to get the clone through the 3 rings.

572
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,398
The guard - 'I', defends the rings.
Do you understand?

573
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,878
I think so.
What is it?

574
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,150
Hold it here.

575
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,473
Be prepared... it will come back.

576
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,270
Excellent Potter. You'd make a great Slagman.

577
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,435
What was that?

578
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,755
A Dunkaree. Mean little bastards.

579
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,316
But you are a seeker.

580
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,151
The only thing you need to think about... is this.

581
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,789
The Golden Heifer.

582
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,878
I like this one.
You do now,

583
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,914
But just wait...
It's very fast and hard to see.

584
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,997
What should I do with it?

585
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,317
Catch it before the other team's seeker.

586
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,915
If you catch it, the fight is over.

587
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,908
You catch that Potter
and we'll win the fight.

588
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:19,720
One of the many skills of a magician
is levitation

589
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,708
or...the ability to make things float.

590
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,229
Do you have your feathers?

591
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:31,395
Don't forget the wrist movement
that we have practiced.

592
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,797
Now all of them: Flip and flip.

593
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:40,713
And remember to pronounce the magic words

594
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,518
Wingardium Leviosa.

595
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,909
Wingardium Leviosa.

596
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,390
Wingardium Leviosa.

597
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:59,153
Stop, stop. You're going to poke someone's eye out.

598
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:05,111
By the way, you pronounce it wrong.
It is Leviosa, not Levi-o-sa.

599
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,878
Wingardium Leviosa.

600
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:26,473
Well done. Look, everybody!
Ms. Granger has done it!

601
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,272
Excellent, excellent

602
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,916
Well done.

603
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,873
I think we need a new spring Professor.

604
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:50,193
It is called Leviosa! Not Levi-o-sa!

605
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:55,560
She is a nightmare
No wonder she has no friends.

606
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,634
I think she heard you.

607
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,111
Where is Hermione?

608
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,312
She does not want to come out of the toilet

609
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:35,433
she has been sitting there
crying all afternoon.

610
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,195
Trolls in the basement!

611
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,637
Trolls in the basement!

612
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,550
Thought you should know.

613
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,879
SILENCE!

614
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,279
No panic please!

615
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,433
Now...

616
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,997
to take you back to your dormitories.
The teachers follow me to the basement.

617
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:18,276
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

618
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,917
Keep up the pace Gryffindors, and pay attention.

619
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,792
How can a troll get in here?

620
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,949
Maybe it's some kind of Halloween joke.

621
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,994
What?
Hermione! She knows nothing!

622
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,717
The troll is no longer in the cellar.

623
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,510
He goes into the girls' toilet.

624
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,555
Hermione, get out of the way!

625
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,759
Help, help

626
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,671
Hey, nutcase

627
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,397
Help and advice

628
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,955
Do something

629
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:28,108
What is it?
Anything at all!

630
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,029
Hurry up!
Flip and flick.

631
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,470
Wingardium Leviosa.

632
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,871
Cool.

633
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,999
Is it dead?

634
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:15,954
I don't think so, it's just passed out.

635
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,190
Ööörk! Troll snakes

636
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,990
Oh dear!

637
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,637
Now you two can explain yourselves.
It's all my fault, Professor McGonagall

638
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,869
Miss Granger?

639
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:43,589
I was looking for the troll.
I thought I would make it.

640
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,597
But I was wrong.

641
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:50,635
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
I would probably be dead now.

642
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,832
It is very possible
It was a very stupid idea!

643
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:01,478
I would have expected you to be more sensible than that

644
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,558
5 points deducted for Gryffindor,

645
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:08,196
for your poor judgment.

646
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,551
And you two gentlemen

647
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:14,036
I hope you realize how lucky you were

648
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,516
Not many first-year students could handle
a full-grown mountain troll

649
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,234
and survive!

650
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,789
5 points...

651
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,112
For recklessness!

652
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,555
I'm keeping watch. It might wake up.

653
01:10:48,104 --> 01:10:50,743
Have some breakfast.

654
01:10:50,944 --> 01:10:54,016
Ron is right. You need your powers today.

655
01:10:54,224 --> 01:10:56,340
I am not hungry.

656
01:10:56,904 --> 01:11:02,297
Good luck today Potter.
Now that you've dealt with a troll

657
01:11:02,504 --> 01:11:05,541
a Quidditch match shouldn't
be any difficulty for you.

658
01:11:05,744 --> 01:11:08,736
Even if it is against Slytherin.

659
01:11:16,104 --> 01:11:19,380
- This explains the blood
- Blood

660
01:11:19,784 --> 01:11:23,743
I think Snape unleashed the troll
as a diversionary tactic

661
01:11:23,944 --> 01:11:26,504
to get past the three-headed dog,

662
01:11:26,704 --> 01:11:29,343
but he was bitten. That's why he's limping.

663
01:11:29,584 --> 01:11:31,700
Why would anyone go near that dog?

664
01:11:32,344 --> 01:11:35,461
When Hagrid and I were in Gringotts
he took something from the vault

665
01:11:35,664 --> 01:11:38,781
Something secret that had to do with Hogwarts.

666
01:11:38,984 --> 01:11:40,053
So you are saying that...

667
01:11:40,264 --> 01:11:44,576
That's what the dog is guarding!
That's what Snape wants!

668
01:11:57,184 --> 01:12:00,972
Isn't the mail a bit early?
But me, I never get mail?

669
01:12:01,504 --> 01:12:02,983
Let's open it!

670
01:12:12,744 --> 01:12:13,938
It's a broom!

671
01:12:14,704 --> 01:12:18,663
It's not just a broomstick Harry!
It's a Nimbus 2000!

672
01:12:20,064 --> 01:12:22,020
But who...?

673
01:12:42,784 --> 01:12:45,173
Scared, Harry?
A little.

674
01:12:45,384 --> 01:12:48,899
I was also scared before my first match.

675
01:12:49,104 --> 01:12:52,460
What happened?
I don't really remember.

676
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:55,304
After 2 minutes I got a slap

677
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:58,223
and woke up in hospital a week later.

678
01:13:19,504 --> 01:13:22,735
Hello and welcome to the first
first Quidditch match of the season.

679
01:13:22,944 --> 01:13:27,460
Match of the day:
Slytherin meets Gryffindor!

680
01:13:56,504 --> 01:13:58,859
Players take their positions

681
01:13:59,064 --> 01:14:02,693
while Mrs. Hooch starts the game!

682
01:14:02,904 --> 01:14:06,101
I expect a nice and fair match!

683
01:14:06,704 --> 01:14:09,013
Of you all!

684
01:14:13,944 --> 01:14:16,742
The batters are on the move followed by
The Golden Heifer

685
01:14:16,944 --> 01:14:19,538
Don't forget that it gives you 150 points.

686
01:14:19,744 --> 01:14:23,373
Whoever catches the Quack wins the match!

687
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:33,223
The dunk is going off... and the game is on!

688
01:14:51,144 --> 01:14:55,740
Angelina Johnson scores!
10 points for Gryffindor!

689
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:01,932
Well done

690
01:15:06,144 --> 01:15:11,616
Slytherin takes control of the Dunkirk,
and passes it to Marcus Flint.

691
01:15:42,344 --> 01:15:45,017
Another 10 points for Gryffindor!

692
01:15:58,264 --> 01:16:00,061
Give it to me!

693
01:16:30,224 --> 01:16:32,738
Take that side!

694
01:17:20,184 --> 01:17:23,301
What happens to Harry's broom?

695
01:17:31,864 --> 01:17:33,980
It's Snape, he's bewitching the broom!

696
01:17:34,184 --> 01:17:38,382
Bewitching the broom? What are we going to do?

697
01:17:59,264 --> 01:18:00,743
Leave it to me.

698
01:18:14,264 --> 01:18:17,859
Lacarnum Inflamarae.

699
01:18:24,664 --> 01:18:27,576
Fire! You are on fire!

700
01:18:44,704 --> 01:18:46,774
Let's go!

701
01:19:36,664 --> 01:19:38,894
It looks like he is not feeling well.

702
01:19:39,944 --> 01:19:41,343
He has the Quicken!

703
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:45,457
Harry Potter gets 150 points for catching the Quack!

704
01:19:45,664 --> 01:19:47,256
Gryffindor wins!

705
01:20:29,064 --> 01:20:33,137
Stupid! Why would Snape
Why would Snape hex Harry's broom?

706
01:20:33,344 --> 01:20:37,098
Who knows, but why did he want to pass by
the dog on All Hallows' Eve?

707
01:20:37,304 --> 01:20:39,613
Who told you about Fluffy?
Fluffy?

708
01:20:39,824 --> 01:20:43,339
Does the creep have a name?
Yes, he does. He's mine.

709
01:20:43,544 --> 01:20:48,618
I bought him from an Irishman.
That's how he became Dumbledore's guard dog.

710
01:20:48,824 --> 01:20:53,215
I should not have said that.

711
01:20:53,784 --> 01:20:57,618
But Snape tried to steal it?

712
01:20:57,824 --> 01:21:01,134
Professor Snape is a teacher at Hogwarts.

713
01:21:01,624 --> 01:21:06,493
Teacher or not. I recognize
a spell when I see one.

714
01:21:06,704 --> 01:21:10,140
You maintain constant eye contact,
and Snape didn't blink!

715
01:21:10,344 --> 01:21:12,494
Precisely

716
01:21:13,144 --> 01:21:15,783
Now you three listen to me

717
01:21:15,984 --> 01:21:20,455
You are interfering in matters that do not concern you.
That is dangerous.

718
01:21:20,664 --> 01:21:25,533
What the dog guards only concerns
Professor Dumbledore and Nicolas Flamel.

719
01:21:25,744 --> 01:21:27,097
Nicholas Flamel?

720
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:32,580
I should not have said that.

721
01:21:32,784 --> 01:21:36,697
Nicholas Flamel.
Who is Nicolas Flamel?

722
01:21:36,904 --> 01:21:38,815
I do not know.

723
01:21:56,904 --> 01:21:59,623
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas

724
01:21:59,864 --> 01:22:02,537
Ring Hogwart Watch

725
01:22:02,744 --> 01:22:05,417
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas

726
01:22:21,464 --> 01:22:24,661
Knight to E-5.

727
01:22:32,024 --> 01:22:34,094
Queen to E-5.

728
01:22:39,504 --> 01:22:40,857
That is barbaric!

729
01:22:41,464 --> 01:22:44,854
It's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

730
01:22:45,064 --> 01:22:46,463
I see that you don't have it.

731
01:22:46,824 --> 01:22:51,739
Change in plans. My parents are going
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie

732
01:22:51,944 --> 01:22:55,619
He studies kites.
That's nice. Then you can help Harry.

733
01:22:55,824 --> 01:22:59,055
He goes to the library to look for
information about Nicolas Flamel.

734
01:22:59,264 --> 01:23:02,620
We have searched 100 times!

735
01:23:03,224 --> 01:23:08,252
Not in the forbidden section.
Merry Christmas.

736
01:23:10,384 --> 01:23:13,182
I think we have a bad influence on her.

737
01:23:15,624 --> 01:23:19,776
Harry, wake up!

738
01:23:29,224 --> 01:23:32,421
Merry Christmas, Harry.
Merry Christmas, Ron.

739
01:23:32,624 --> 01:23:34,740
What are your clothes?

740
01:23:35,304 --> 01:23:38,853
My mother made it.
You have also received something.

741
01:23:39,944 --> 01:23:42,253
Have I received Christmas presents?
Yes!

742
01:23:49,384 --> 01:23:51,375
There they are.

743
01:24:01,944 --> 01:24:05,300
Your father left this in my care before he died.

744
01:24:05,544 --> 01:24:09,503
It is now time for you to get it.
Use it well.

745
01:24:25,624 --> 01:24:29,173
What is it?
Some kind of cloak.

746
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:32,262
Put it on.

747
01:24:37,464 --> 01:24:38,692
My body is gone!

748
01:24:38,904 --> 01:24:42,340
I know what it is!
It's an invisibility cloak!

749
01:24:42,864 --> 01:24:44,695
Am I invisible?

750
01:24:45,144 --> 01:24:49,376
It is very rare.
Who could have given it to you?

751
01:24:49,824 --> 01:24:54,420
It just said "Use it well".

752
01:25:21,344 --> 01:25:26,976
Famous fire-eaters.Themes about the
15th century

753
01:25:27,184 --> 01:25:32,781
Flamel... Nicolas Flamel.
Where are you?

754
01:25:50,824 --> 01:25:52,655
Where are you?

755
01:25:58,544 --> 01:26:03,937
I know you are there.
You can't hide.

756
01:26:11,024 --> 01:26:14,619
Who is it?... Come out!

757
01:27:01,824 --> 01:27:05,533
You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrel.

758
01:27:05,744 --> 01:27:10,260
What do you mean?
You know exactly what I mean.

759
01:27:26,784 --> 01:27:29,856
We continue our little chat

760
01:27:30,064 --> 01:27:35,297
when you have had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

761
01:27:35,544 --> 01:27:39,776
I found this ...
in the forbidden section.

762
01:27:40,304 --> 01:27:45,139
It is still warm. That means
that one of the students is not in his bed!

763
01:29:13,464 --> 01:29:15,216
Mother?

764
01:29:18,344 --> 01:29:20,255
Father?

765
01:29:53,584 --> 01:29:58,339
Ron, you have to see this!

766
01:30:00,104 --> 01:30:02,857
Ron, come on, get up!

767
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:06,500
What's the point?
It's something you have to see!

768
01:30:12,944 --> 01:30:17,062
Come on, let's go!
Look, my parents!

769
01:30:18,464 --> 01:30:20,341
I only see us.

770
01:30:20,584 --> 01:30:23,781
Look carefully, stand there.

771
01:30:23,984 --> 01:30:29,661
Can you see them now?
That's me! I am the organizer.

772
01:30:30,144 --> 01:30:32,374
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

773
01:30:32,624 --> 01:30:36,617
And for goodness sake...
I'm holding the Quiddich trophy

774
01:30:37,704 --> 01:30:40,059
I look good!

775
01:30:40,664 --> 01:30:44,339
Harry, do you think it shows the future?

776
01:30:44,544 --> 01:30:49,299
How could it do that?
My parents are dead.

777
01:31:11,504 --> 01:31:13,574
Here again Harry?

778
01:31:16,544 --> 01:31:18,933
Now you, like many others

779
01:31:19,144 --> 01:31:23,137
discovered the joy of the Erised mirror.

780
01:31:23,464 --> 01:31:27,457
By now you know what it does.

781
01:31:28,704 --> 01:31:31,138
Here is a hint.

782
01:31:31,664 --> 01:31:33,700
The happiest man in the world

783
01:31:33,904 --> 01:31:37,135
would look in the mirror and see only himself

784
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:39,574
just as he is in real life.

785
01:31:39,784 --> 01:31:44,619
It shows us what we want.

786
01:31:44,824 --> 01:31:47,463
Yes...and no

787
01:31:48,464 --> 01:31:50,819
It shows us nothing less than the deepest and

788
01:31:51,024 --> 01:31:56,735
most burning desire we carry in our hearts.

789
01:31:56,944 --> 01:32:01,460
So, Harry, you never knew your family.

790
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:05,373
You see them gathered around you.

791
01:32:05,584 --> 01:32:07,893
But remember this, Harry

792
01:32:08,144 --> 01:32:13,776
Gives us neither knowledge nor

793
01:32:13,984 --> 01:32:16,020
Truth.

794
01:32:16,944 --> 01:32:22,735
Many have wasted ages in front of it
even gone mad.

795
01:32:23,744 --> 01:32:27,703
Therefore, it will be moved tomorrow.

796
01:32:27,904 --> 01:32:29,735
And I must ask you
not to look for it again.

797
01:32:30,664 --> 01:32:34,373
not to look for it again.

798
01:32:35,104 --> 01:32:38,096
One should not sink into dreams

799
01:32:38,664 --> 01:32:41,417
so you forget to live

800
01:33:33,904 --> 01:33:39,342
I made you look in the wrong place.
How could I be so stupid?

801
01:33:39,584 --> 01:33:42,542
I borrowed it several weeks ago,
to have something easy to read.

802
01:33:42,744 --> 01:33:44,655
Is this "easy"?

803
01:33:49,064 --> 01:33:51,373
Here it is!

804
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:55,418
Nikolas Flamel is the only known
creator of the Philosopher's Stone!

805
01:33:55,664 --> 01:33:56,779
What?

806
01:33:57,424 --> 01:34:00,302
Do you never read?

807
01:34:00,504 --> 01:34:04,816
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance

808
01:34:05,024 --> 01:34:07,538
that can turn metal into gold

809
01:34:07,744 --> 01:34:11,578
and produce the elixir of life,
the liquid that makes you immortal.

810
01:34:11,784 --> 01:34:13,854
Immortal?
It means that you never die.

811
01:34:14,064 --> 01:34:16,055
I know what it means!

812
01:34:16,904 --> 01:34:21,420
The only existing stone
belongs to Nicolas Flamel

813
01:34:21,624 --> 01:34:26,573
An alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday.

814
01:34:28,224 --> 01:34:30,294
That's what Fluffy is guarding.

815
01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:35,020
That is what is under the trapdoor.
The Philosopher's Stone!

816
01:34:51,104 --> 01:34:54,733
Unfortunately, I am not able to
receive guests today.

817
01:34:54,944 --> 01:34:57,538
We know the 'Philosopher's Stone'!

818
01:35:02,064 --> 01:35:06,979
We think Snape is trying to steal it.
Do you still suspect him?

819
01:35:07,184 --> 01:35:09,857
We know it's him,
we just don't know why?

820
01:35:10,224 --> 01:35:14,217
Snape is one of the teachers protecting the stone.
He has no intention of stealing it.

821
01:35:14,464 --> 01:35:15,499
What?

822
01:35:15,664 --> 01:35:18,940
I'm a bit busy now so

823
01:35:19,144 --> 01:35:21,704
Wait a minute... One of the teachers?

824
01:35:21,904 --> 01:35:25,613
Of course it is!
Other teachers protect it too

825
01:35:25,824 --> 01:35:28,338
with incantations!
Quite rightly

826
01:35:28,584 --> 01:35:31,496
A waste of time in my opinion.

827
01:35:31,704 --> 01:35:33,695
No one can get past Fluffy.

828
01:35:33,904 --> 01:35:37,419
No one knows how except
me and Dumbledore.

829
01:35:37,664 --> 01:35:41,100
I should not have told you

830
01:35:54,384 --> 01:35:59,253
Hagrid, what is that?
It's... uhh

831
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:01,415
I know what it is!

832
01:36:01,624 --> 01:36:04,138
But Hagrid, how did you get one?

833
01:36:04,504 --> 01:36:07,621
I won it from a stranger down at the inn!

834
01:36:07,824 --> 01:36:11,737
He seemed happy to get rid of it

835
01:36:33,064 --> 01:36:35,180
Is it

836
01:36:35,944 --> 01:36:37,059
What about dragons?

837
01:36:37,264 --> 01:36:41,496
It's not just a kite.
It's a Norwegian Ridge Kite.

838
01:36:41,704 --> 01:36:44,457
My brother Charlie studies them in Romania.

839
01:36:44,664 --> 01:36:49,340
Isn't it cute?
Look, look, look! He knows who his mom is.

840
01:36:49,984 --> 01:36:51,656
Hello, Norbert.

841
01:36:51,984 --> 01:36:56,102
Norbert?
He must have a name.

842
01:36:56,824 --> 01:36:59,179
Right, Norbert?

843
01:37:05,864 --> 01:37:08,856
He has to be trained a bit, of course.

844
01:37:12,584 --> 01:37:14,575
Who is it?

845
01:37:16,224 --> 01:37:18,215
Malfoy.

846
01:37:18,944 --> 01:37:20,297
Oh dear!

847
01:37:21,944 --> 01:37:26,540
Hagrid has always wanted a kite.
He told me that the first time we met.

848
01:37:26,744 --> 01:37:30,623
That's insane.
And now Malfoy knows it.

849
01:37:30,824 --> 01:37:34,737
I don't understand... is it not good?
Not good at all.

850
01:37:35,024 --> 01:37:37,094
Good evening.

851
01:37:40,584 --> 01:37:43,382
Nothing, and I mean nothing

852
01:37:43,624 --> 01:37:46,980
gives a student permission to
stay up at night.

853
01:37:47,184 --> 01:37:51,860
So as a penalty, you will be deducted 50 points.

854
01:37:52,064 --> 01:37:54,294
50?!
Where!

855
01:37:55,304 --> 01:37:57,579
And to be sure it is not repeated

856
01:37:57,784 --> 01:38:00,981
all 4 of you will receive detention.

857
01:38:01,864 --> 01:38:04,697
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

858
01:38:04,904 --> 01:38:07,134
Excuse me professor, maybe I heard wrong

859
01:38:07,344 --> 01:38:09,733
No, you heard right, Malfoy.

860
01:38:09,944 --> 01:38:14,734
Even if your intentions were good,
you were up at the time yourself.

861
01:38:15,184 --> 01:38:18,017
You may join your peers
company during detention.

862
01:38:28,784 --> 01:38:32,618
It's a shame that the old methods of punishment have been abolished.

863
01:38:32,824 --> 01:38:37,340
Once upon a time, people were hung from chains.

864
01:38:37,544 --> 01:38:40,263
I miss their screaming!

865
01:38:42,704 --> 01:38:45,855
You will receive your detention together with Hagrid.

866
01:38:46,064 --> 01:38:51,184
He has a small mission in the Dark Forest.

867
01:38:53,184 --> 01:38:56,017
Sorry about all this, Hagrid.

868
01:38:57,424 --> 01:39:02,214
You're not still thinking about
about that damn dragon?

869
01:39:04,384 --> 01:39:06,375
Norbert is gone.

870
01:39:06,904 --> 01:39:10,294
Dumbledore sent him to a
colony in Romania.

871
01:39:10,584 --> 01:39:13,701
That way he can be with his own kind.

872
01:39:13,864 --> 01:39:16,094
What if he doesn't like Romania?

873
01:39:16,304 --> 01:39:20,377
What if the other dragons are naughty?
He's just a kid, right?

874
01:39:20,984 --> 01:39:26,012
Pull yourself together, man!
You're going into the forest.

875
01:39:26,224 --> 01:39:28,499
Better get your brain working.

876
01:39:28,704 --> 01:39:34,142
The forest? I thought it was a joke!

877
01:39:34,584 --> 01:39:38,259
Students are not allowed to go there! And there are

878
01:39:39,744 --> 01:39:40,938
werewolves!

879
01:39:41,344 --> 01:39:44,495
There's more than werewolves there, son.

880
01:39:44,704 --> 01:39:47,264
Be sure of it.

881
01:39:49,144 --> 01:39:50,497
Natti, natti

882
01:39:52,984 --> 01:39:55,703
So let's go

883
01:40:32,344 --> 01:40:34,653
Hagrid, what is that?

884
01:40:34,864 --> 01:40:38,095
What we have come here for.
Can you see this?

885
01:40:38,584 --> 01:40:43,738
It is unicorn blood. I found a dead
unicorn a few weeks ago.

886
01:40:44,264 --> 01:40:48,655
This one has been seriously wounded.

887
01:40:55,864 --> 01:41:01,382
So it's our job to find the poor animal.

888
01:41:01,584 --> 01:41:04,576
Ron, Hermione. You're coming with me.

889
01:41:05,024 --> 01:41:08,175
Harry, you go with Malfoy.

890
01:41:09,384 --> 01:41:11,579
But I get Faithful!

891
01:41:11,744 --> 01:41:17,262
Yes, of course. I just want you to know
he's a real coward.

892
01:41:20,784 --> 01:41:25,574
Wait till my father hears about this!
This is a job for servants!

893
01:41:25,784 --> 01:41:29,538
One might think you are afraid.

894
01:41:29,744 --> 01:41:32,212
I'm not afraid, Potter.

895
01:41:33,304 --> 01:41:35,181
Did you hear that?

896
01:41:37,624 --> 01:41:38,977
Come, Faithful

897
01:41:39,184 --> 01:41:40,617
Afraid!

898
01:42:04,584 --> 01:42:06,654
What is it Faithful?

899
01:43:14,144 --> 01:43:19,423
Harry Potter, you must go!
You are known by many creatures here.

900
01:43:19,624 --> 01:43:23,458
The forest is not safe at that time,
especially not for you.

901
01:43:23,664 --> 01:43:26,303
But what was it you saved me from?

902
01:43:26,504 --> 01:43:31,624
A terrible creature!
It is terrible to kill a unicorn.

903
01:43:31,824 --> 01:43:37,137
Drinking its blood keeps you alive,
even if you are a hair's breadth from death.

904
01:43:37,344 --> 01:43:42,213
But you pay a terrible price.
When you kill something so innocent

905
01:43:42,424 --> 01:43:47,054
the moment it touches your lips
your lips, you will have half a life.

906
01:43:47,264 --> 01:43:48,982
A life under a curse.

907
01:43:49,184 --> 01:43:52,972
Who would choose such a life?
Who do you think?

908
01:43:53,184 --> 01:43:57,939
Are you saying that what killed the unicorn

909
01:43:58,264 --> 01:44:02,018
and drank its blood
It was Voldemort!

910
01:44:02,224 --> 01:44:07,173
Do you know what is hidden here in the forest right now

911
01:44:07,984 --> 01:44:09,463
"The Philosopher's Stone"

912
01:44:10,744 --> 01:44:12,655
Harry!

913
01:44:13,224 --> 01:44:17,536
Good evening, Florence.
I see you've met young Mr. Potter.

914
01:44:17,744 --> 01:44:19,814
Are you okay, Harry?

915
01:44:20,904 --> 01:44:25,022
Harry Potter,
I'll leave you here.

916
01:44:25,864 --> 01:44:29,539
You are safe now. Good luck to you.

917
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:40,823
You mean "You know who"
is out there in the forest?

918
01:44:41,024 --> 01:44:43,697
But he is weak. He lives on
unicorns.

919
01:44:43,904 --> 01:44:46,702
We were wrong.

920
01:44:46,904 --> 01:44:51,102
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself,
it's for Voldemort.

921
01:44:51,304 --> 01:44:55,661
The Elixir of Life makes Voldemort strong again.

922
01:44:55,864 --> 01:44:57,377
So that he can return.

923
01:44:57,584 --> 01:44:59,256
But if he comes back

924
01:44:59,504 --> 01:45:03,292
You don't think he will
try to kill you, do you?

925
01:45:04,264 --> 01:45:07,654
I think he would have killed me
tonight if he had the chance.

926
01:45:07,864 --> 01:45:11,300
And I, who have only been worried
about my potions exam.

927
01:45:11,504 --> 01:45:14,940
Wait a minute, we're forgetting one thing.

928
01:45:15,304 --> 01:45:19,980
Which wizard is it that
Voldemort has always feared?

929
01:45:20,704 --> 01:45:25,619
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

930
01:45:25,824 --> 01:45:29,703
As long as Dumbledore is here,
you're safe. he won't get to you.

931
01:45:35,224 --> 01:45:40,423
I thought the Hogwarts exam would be scary,
but it was actually pretty fun.

932
01:45:40,624 --> 01:45:44,139
Speak for yourself.
Are you okay, Harry?

933
01:45:44,344 --> 01:45:49,293
My scar... it burns.
It has happened before!

934
01:45:49,504 --> 01:45:52,064
Not like this.
Maybe you should see a doctor?

935
01:45:52,264 --> 01:45:55,620
I think it's a warning.
It means that danger is coming.

936
01:46:02,944 --> 01:46:05,299
Of course it is!
What is it?

937
01:46:05,504 --> 01:46:09,099
Isn't it strange, that what Hagrid
wants most of all is a dragon

938
01:46:09,304 --> 01:46:12,262
and then a stranger shows up who just happens to have one?

939
01:46:12,464 --> 01:46:15,024
I mean, how many people walk around
around with dragon eggs in their pocket.

940
01:46:15,224 --> 01:46:17,374
Why didn't I think of that before.

941
01:46:22,744 --> 01:46:26,100
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

942
01:46:26,304 --> 01:46:28,943
I don't know, he was wearing a hood.

943
01:46:29,144 --> 01:46:31,612
What were you talking about?

944
01:46:32,184 --> 01:46:35,574
He wondered what kind of animals I had.

945
01:46:35,784 --> 01:46:39,618
I said that after Fluffy,
a dragon should be no problem.

946
01:46:39,824 --> 01:46:44,102
Did he seem interested in Fluffy?
Of course he was!

947
01:46:44,504 --> 01:46:48,497
How often do you see a three-headed dog?

948
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:54,097
I told him that the trick to dealing with
a beast like that is to know how to calm them down.

949
01:46:54,304 --> 01:46:59,537
Take Fluffy, for example.
Play him some music and he will fall asleep.

950
01:47:01,104 --> 01:47:03,698
I shouldn't have told you that...

951
01:47:03,944 --> 01:47:06,060
Where are you going?

952
01:47:12,784 --> 01:47:15,423
We need to see Professor Dumbledore, now!

953
01:47:15,864 --> 01:47:18,378
But Professor Dumbledore is not here, I'm afraid.

954
01:47:18,584 --> 01:47:22,702
He received an urgent summons from the
Magic Association and flew directly to London.

955
01:47:23,104 --> 01:47:25,538
Has he gone away? But it is important!

956
01:47:25,784 --> 01:47:27,900
It's about the Philosopher's Stone!

957
01:47:29,744 --> 01:47:33,293
How do you know...?
Someone is trying to steal it!

958
01:47:33,904 --> 01:47:38,898
I do not know how you know about the stone.
But I can assure you that it is safe.

959
01:47:39,104 --> 01:47:43,222
Now go back to your rooms.
Quietly and calmly.

960
01:47:51,184 --> 01:47:53,857
It was Snape that Hagrid met!

961
01:47:54,064 --> 01:47:56,624
And now he knows how to get past Fluffy.

962
01:47:56,824 --> 01:48:00,533
And now that Dumbledore has left...
...hello...

963
01:48:02,504 --> 01:48:05,462
What would three young Gryffindors...

964
01:48:05,704 --> 01:48:09,822
What are three Gryffindors like you doing
doing inside on a day like this?

965
01:48:14,384 --> 01:48:17,774
Uh... We, uh...
You should be careful

966
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,181
People might think that you

967
01:48:24,304 --> 01:48:26,898
is doing something.

968
01:48:36,784 --> 01:48:38,695
What do we do now?

969
01:48:38,904 --> 01:48:42,499
We go down through the trapdoor. Tonight.

970
01:48:55,704 --> 01:48:57,103
Trevor.

971
01:48:57,424 --> 01:49:00,700
Trevor, shut up! You can't be here!

972
01:49:00,944 --> 01:49:06,143
Neither can you.
You're going to sneak out again, aren't you?

973
01:49:06,344 --> 01:49:10,132
Neville listens
No you can't!

974
01:49:10,384 --> 01:49:14,775
You're just making trouble for Gryffindor again.
I'll kick your asses!

975
01:49:14,984 --> 01:49:19,102
Neville, I'm sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

976
01:49:26,744 --> 01:49:30,373
You're a little scary sometimes, you know that?

977
01:49:30,624 --> 01:49:34,094
Good... but scary.

978
01:49:34,744 --> 01:49:36,700
Let's go

979
01:49:36,904 --> 01:49:40,977
I apologize for that.
But it's for your own good.

980
01:49:46,184 --> 01:49:49,972
Ouch! You stepped on my foot!
Sorry about that.

981
01:49:53,704 --> 01:49:55,660
Alohomora.

982
01:50:07,184 --> 01:50:09,652
Wait a minute, he

983
01:50:10,824 --> 01:50:12,894
Snoring.

984
01:50:15,304 --> 01:50:20,617
Snape has already been here.
He has cast a spell on the harp.

985
01:50:22,144 --> 01:50:25,022
It has a horrible smell!

986
01:50:27,504 --> 01:50:29,495
We have to move his paw.
What? Uh...

987
01:50:29,704 --> 01:50:31,057
Let's go!

988
01:50:34,944 --> 01:50:36,935
Okay... hugs!

989
01:50:59,144 --> 01:51:02,614
I will go first. Do not follow until I give the signal.

990
01:51:02,824 --> 01:51:07,614
If something goes wrong,
make sure you get out!

991
01:51:08,384 --> 01:51:11,694
Hasn't it become a bit quiet?

992
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:14,136
harp

993
01:51:14,784 --> 01:51:17,378
It no longer plays.

994
01:51:27,024 --> 01:51:28,093
HOPE!

995
01:51:41,704 --> 01:51:45,174
Luckily, there were plants here.

996
01:51:59,024 --> 01:52:01,982
Don't move! It's the Devil's Snare.

997
01:52:02,184 --> 01:52:05,733
You have to relax...
Otherwise it will just kill us faster.

998
01:52:05,944 --> 01:52:10,734
Killing us faster?
Now I can really relax!

999
01:52:12,904 --> 01:52:14,178
Hermione!

1000
01:52:14,744 --> 01:52:18,373
What do we do now?
Just relax!

1001
01:52:18,584 --> 01:52:22,896
Hermione, where are you?
Do as I say! Trust me!

1002
01:52:29,704 --> 01:52:32,901
Are you alright?
-Yes, I'm fine.

1003
01:52:33,104 --> 01:52:36,016
He is not relaxing.
Obviously not.

1004
01:52:36,224 --> 01:52:38,658
I have to do something!
What?!

1005
01:52:38,864 --> 01:52:41,662
I read something about it in biology!

1006
01:52:42,504 --> 01:52:46,179
"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare...
to get free...

1007
01:52:46,384 --> 01:52:50,582
you light a candle, of course!
Of course you do! It hates sunlight!

1008
01:52:50,824 --> 01:52:52,780
Lumus Solem.

1009
01:53:00,544 --> 01:53:03,012
Ron are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

1010
01:53:05,624 --> 01:53:07,979
Luckily, we did not panic.

1011
01:53:08,704 --> 01:53:12,060
Good thing Hermione listened to the lessons.

1012
01:53:13,624 --> 01:53:15,057
What is it?

1013
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:18,813
I don't know... it sounds like wings.

1014
01:53:31,424 --> 01:53:34,734
That's strange. I have never seen such birds.

1015
01:53:34,944 --> 01:53:38,414
They are not birds.
They are keys.

1016
01:53:38,624 --> 01:53:41,934
And one of them probably fits the door there

1017
01:53:45,264 --> 01:53:49,701
What is the point of this?
I don't know what it is.

1018
01:53:55,344 --> 01:53:57,300
Strange...

1019
01:53:57,704 --> 01:53:59,899
Alohomora!

1020
01:54:02,744 --> 01:54:04,894
It was worth a try.

1021
01:54:05,104 --> 01:54:08,221
What are we doing?
There must be 1000 keys up there!

1022
01:54:08,424 --> 01:54:12,178
It's probably an old-fashioned rusty one.

1023
01:54:12,384 --> 01:54:15,660
There it is! The one with the broken wing!

1024
01:54:19,104 --> 01:54:21,334
Is something wrong Harry?

1025
01:54:22,184 --> 01:54:23,617
It is too easy.

1026
01:54:23,824 --> 01:54:28,375
Come on, Harry!
If Snape can catch one, so can you!

1027
01:54:28,584 --> 01:54:31,974
You the youngest searcher of this century!

1028
01:54:48,144 --> 01:54:51,022
This makes it slightly more difficult.

1029
01:55:11,424 --> 01:55:13,255
Catch the key!

1030
01:55:17,504 --> 01:55:19,335
Hurry up!

1031
01:55:50,504 --> 01:55:54,975
I do not like this
Not in the least

1032
01:55:55,184 --> 01:55:58,221
Where are we? In a cemetery.

1033
01:55:58,584 --> 01:56:01,098
This is not a cemetery.

1034
01:56:08,304 --> 01:56:11,102
It is a chessboard!

1035
01:56:22,584 --> 01:56:24,415
There's the door!

1036
01:56:35,984 --> 01:56:37,417
What do we do now?

1037
01:56:37,784 --> 01:56:41,743
Of course it is!
Let's play our way across the room!

1038
01:56:42,304 --> 01:56:45,899
Harry, you take the runner's place.

1039
01:56:46,224 --> 01:56:50,263
Hermione, you will be the tower
closest to the lady.

1040
01:56:50,504 --> 01:56:54,383
And me, I'm a runner!

1041
01:57:01,264 --> 01:57:02,902
What happens next?

1042
01:57:03,664 --> 01:57:06,542
White always starts first.

1043
01:57:06,744 --> 01:57:08,541
and then...

1044
01:57:10,224 --> 01:57:11,418
we play.

1045
01:57:21,584 --> 01:57:26,419
Ron, do you think it will be the same

1046
01:57:26,664 --> 01:57:30,054
...like in real wizard chess?

1047
01:57:30,424 --> 01:57:33,257
You there! D-5!

1048
01:57:47,264 --> 01:57:48,777
Yes, Hermione...

1049
01:57:48,984 --> 01:57:53,853
I think it will be
exactly like wizard chess!

1050
01:57:59,544 --> 01:58:01,933
Runners, to E-4!

1051
01:58:05,424 --> 01:58:07,619
Farmer, to C-3!

1052
01:58:50,424 --> 01:58:54,258
Wait a minute
Listen, Harry.

1053
01:58:54,504 --> 01:58:59,020
When I make my move
the Queen will take me.

1054
01:58:59,624 --> 01:59:01,854
Then you are free to put the king in check!

1055
01:59:02,064 --> 01:59:04,658
No! Ron! Ron, no!
What's happening?!

1056
01:59:05,264 --> 01:59:09,735
He is going to sacrifice himself!
You can't! There must be another way!

1057
01:59:09,944 --> 01:59:13,539
Don't you want to stop Snape from getting the Stone?

1058
01:59:13,744 --> 01:59:17,180
Harry, it is you who must continue!

1059
01:59:17,664 --> 01:59:20,303
Not me, not Hermione, but you!

1060
01:59:30,144 --> 01:59:32,942
Runner to H-3!

1061
01:59:53,024 --> 01:59:54,935
Chess.

1062
02:00:22,904 --> 02:00:24,622
Ron!

1063
02:00:24,824 --> 02:00:30,376
No! Don't move!
Don't forget that we are still playing.

1064
02:00:44,824 --> 02:00:46,052
Checkmate.

1065
02:01:05,184 --> 02:01:07,573
Take care of Ron. Then go to the owls

1066
02:01:07,784 --> 02:01:11,493
and send word to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1067
02:01:11,704 --> 02:01:13,501
I have to keep going.

1068
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:19,661
Don't worry Harry
You are a great wizard.

1069
02:01:19,864 --> 02:01:22,253
Not as good as you.

1070
02:01:23,064 --> 02:01:27,694
Me? Books and wisdom
There are more important things

1071
02:01:28,864 --> 02:01:34,257
Friendship and courage.
Be careful now Harry

1072
02:02:10,784 --> 02:02:12,376
You?

1073
02:02:13,144 --> 02:02:16,819
No, it is impossible! Snape he

1074
02:02:17,024 --> 02:02:19,936
He seems to be that type, doesn't he?

1075
02:02:20,144 --> 02:02:23,136
Because who would suspect

1076
02:02:23,344 --> 02:02:27,098
S-stackars, s-stuttering
Professor Quirrel?

1077
02:02:27,304 --> 02:02:32,458
But when we played the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me!

1078
02:02:32,664 --> 02:02:35,337
No, my boy. I tried to kill you!

1079
02:02:35,824 --> 02:02:39,817
If Snape's cape hadn't caught on fire,
and I lost my eye contact

1080
02:02:40,024 --> 02:02:42,140
I would have succeeded!

1081
02:02:42,344 --> 02:02:45,222
Even if Snape was muttering counterspells!

1082
02:02:45,424 --> 02:02:47,540
Snape tried to SAVE me?

1083
02:02:47,744 --> 02:02:52,864
I knew you were a danger to me.
Especially after All Hallows' Eve.

1084
02:02:53,064 --> 02:02:57,137
So it was you who let the troll in?
Excellent Potter. Yes.

1085
02:02:57,344 --> 02:03:00,222
However, Snape was not fooled.

1086
02:03:00,784 --> 02:03:05,539
When everyone went to the basement
he was on the 3rd floor to stop me.

1087
02:03:06,424 --> 02:03:09,780
He didn't trust me anymore after that.

1088
02:03:10,744 --> 02:03:15,772
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1089
02:03:15,984 --> 02:03:19,863
I am never alone. Never.

1090
02:03:20,064 --> 02:03:23,977
Well, what does this mirror do?

1091
02:03:25,504 --> 02:03:27,540
I see what I want

1092
02:03:28,064 --> 02:03:32,296
I see myself holding the stone.
But how do I get it?

1093
02:03:32,504 --> 02:03:34,574
"Use the boy"

1094
02:03:35,344 --> 02:03:39,098
Come here Potter! NOW!

1095
02:03:50,704 --> 02:03:54,538
Tell me, what do you see?

1096
02:04:18,664 --> 02:04:20,973
What is it? What do you see?!

1097
02:04:21,184 --> 02:04:26,133
I shake hands with Dumbledore.
I have won the dormitory cup.

1098
02:04:26,344 --> 02:04:27,823
"He is lying"

1099
02:04:28,304 --> 02:04:31,853
TELL THE TRUTH! WHAT DO YOU SEE?!

1100
02:04:32,064 --> 02:04:36,262
"Let me talk to him"
Master, you are not strong enough!

1101
02:04:36,504 --> 02:04:40,338
"I have enough strength... for this"

1102
02:04:57,784 --> 02:05:00,537
Harry Potter...

1103
02:05:00,744 --> 02:05:02,974
...we meet again.

1104
02:05:03,184 --> 02:05:04,537
We meet again.

1105
02:05:04,744 --> 02:05:08,532
Yes, it is. Do you see what has become of me?

1106
02:05:08,784 --> 02:05:12,220
Do you see what I have to do to survive?

1107
02:05:12,424 --> 02:05:16,383
Sharing my body with someone else...
Like a parasite.

1108
02:05:17,024 --> 02:05:20,221
Unicorn blood can strengthen me.

1109
02:05:20,424 --> 02:05:23,939
But not enough to create a body of their own.

1110
02:05:24,144 --> 02:05:27,534
But there is something that can.

1111
02:05:27,744 --> 02:05:33,182
Something that is just enough. It's in your pocket.

1112
02:05:33,544 --> 02:05:35,023
Stop him!

1113
02:05:39,864 --> 02:05:42,503
Don't be a fool!

1114
02:05:42,984 --> 02:05:45,976
Why face certain death

1115
02:05:46,184 --> 02:05:49,654
when you can unite with me
and continue living?

1116
02:05:49,864 --> 02:05:50,899
Never!!!

1117
02:05:52,824 --> 02:05:57,420
Courage. Your parents had it too.

1118
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:01,295
Tell me, Harry...

1119
02:06:01,544 --> 02:06:05,253
Would you like to see your mother and father again?

1120
02:06:05,504 --> 02:06:07,495
Together...

1121
02:06:07,704 --> 02:06:10,138
we can get them back.

1122
02:06:10,544 --> 02:06:15,060
All I ask for is little things in return.

1123
02:06:21,504 --> 02:06:24,496
That's right Harry

1124
02:06:25,344 --> 02:06:29,053
There is no good and evil.

1125
02:06:29,264 --> 02:06:32,142
There is only power.

1126
02:06:32,344 --> 02:06:36,303
And those who are too weak to seek it out

1127
02:06:36,944 --> 02:06:41,779
Together we can do incredible things

1128
02:06:42,184 --> 02:06:44,334
only you give me the stone!

1129
02:06:46,864 --> 02:06:47,979
You liar!

1130
02:06:48,184 --> 02:06:50,220
Kill him!

1131
02:07:12,784 --> 02:07:17,904
What kind of magic was that?
Idiot! Take the Stone!

1132
02:08:58,864 --> 02:09:01,253
Good afternoon, Harry

1133
02:09:03,304 --> 02:09:07,616
Gifts from your admirers.
Admirers?

1134
02:09:07,824 --> 02:09:13,581
What happened between you and
Professor Quirrel is an absolute secret.

1135
02:09:13,784 --> 02:09:18,380
So... of course... the whole school knows about it.

1136
02:09:20,624 --> 02:09:24,094
I see Ron has saved you the trouble
with

1137
02:09:24,304 --> 02:09:27,023
to open your chocolate frogs.

1138
02:09:27,224 --> 02:09:30,102
Is he okay?
and what about Hermione?

1139
02:09:30,304 --> 02:09:34,980
They are both fine.

1140
02:09:35,544 --> 02:09:38,217
What happened to the stone?
Calm down my boy

1141
02:09:38,544 --> 02:09:41,263
The stone has been destroyed.

1142
02:09:41,504 --> 02:09:45,543
My friend Nicolas and I had a little chat

1143
02:09:45,744 --> 02:09:49,532
and agreed that it was for the best.

1144
02:09:49,744 --> 02:09:53,419
But won't Flamel die then?

1145
02:09:55,384 --> 02:10:00,663
He has enough elixir of life in stock
to get his affairs in order.

1146
02:10:00,864 --> 02:10:03,936
And then, well... he will die.

1147
02:10:04,144 --> 02:10:06,499
How could I get the stone?

1148
02:10:06,704 --> 02:10:09,138
First it was in the mirror
And then in my pocket.

1149
02:10:09,344 --> 02:10:13,257
You see, only a person...

1150
02:10:13,544 --> 02:10:17,298
Only the one who wanted to find the stone.

1151
02:10:17,544 --> 02:10:21,901
But not using it
could get it.

1152
02:10:22,824 --> 02:10:26,180
It is one of my better ideas.

1153
02:10:26,384 --> 02:10:31,219
Between you and me... that's saying something.

1154
02:10:32,624 --> 02:10:37,618
Now that the stone is gone,
Voldemort will never come back?

1155
02:10:37,824 --> 02:10:40,054
I am afraid that...

1156
02:10:41,424 --> 02:10:45,303
there are possibilities that he can return.
in which he can return.

1157
02:10:45,984 --> 02:10:48,452
Harry, do you know why...

1158
02:10:48,664 --> 02:10:52,498
Do you know why Professor Quirrel
couldn't stand you touching him?

1159
02:10:52,704 --> 02:10:57,141
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed her life for you.

1160
02:10:57,664 --> 02:11:00,736
That kind of action leaves a mark.

1161
02:11:00,944 --> 02:11:04,573
No, this mark cannot be seen.

1162
02:11:04,784 --> 02:11:09,494
It's under your skin.
What is it, then?

1163
02:11:10,304 --> 02:11:13,899
Love Harry. Love Harry

1164
02:11:21,624 --> 02:11:25,583
Oh, Bertie's multi-flavor beans!

1165
02:11:25,784 --> 02:11:30,255
I had the misfortune in my youth,
to get a vomit-flavored one.

1166
02:11:30,504 --> 02:11:33,655
Since then I have not really liked them.

1167
02:11:33,864 --> 02:11:37,095
Well, I should be able to feel safe.

1168
02:11:37,304 --> 02:11:39,579
with a good caramel taste.

1169
02:11:43,504 --> 02:11:44,983
Unfortunately...

1170
02:11:45,664 --> 02:11:47,700
Earwax!

1171
02:12:02,304 --> 02:12:05,341
Okay, Ron?
Okay, uh... How about you?

1172
02:12:06,424 --> 02:12:09,018
Hermione?

1173
02:12:09,664 --> 02:12:11,416
Never had it better.

1174
02:12:26,584 --> 02:12:28,939
Another year has passed!

1175
02:12:29,664 --> 02:12:34,021
My understanding is that
students should be rewarded.

1176
02:12:34,224 --> 02:12:36,738
The position is as follows:

1177
02:12:36,944 --> 02:12:42,496
In fourth place...
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1178
02:12:44,384 --> 02:12:49,822
In third place...
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1179
02:12:54,904 --> 02:12:56,622
In second place...

1180
02:12:56,824 --> 02:13:01,420
Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1181
02:13:06,864 --> 02:13:08,502
And in first place

1182
02:13:08,824 --> 02:13:14,023
with 472 points, Slytherin.

1183
02:13:19,384 --> 02:13:21,500
Nice one, mate.

1184
02:13:25,184 --> 02:13:29,097
Yes, yes! Bravo Slytherin!

1185
02:13:29,344 --> 02:13:33,462
Anyway...New events must be taken into
be taken into account

1186
02:13:33,664 --> 02:13:38,419
I have some "last minute" points to share.

1187
02:13:39,024 --> 02:13:44,303
Ms. Hermione Granger...
For her use of cold logic...

1188
02:13:44,504 --> 02:13:47,177
when others were in great danger

1189
02:13:47,864 --> 02:13:50,014
50 points.

1190
02:13:50,904 --> 02:13:52,132
Well done.

1191
02:13:59,544 --> 02:14:05,335
Second... to Ronald Weasley...
For the best chess game...

1192
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:10,852
ever played at Hogwarts...
50 points.

1193
02:14:15,304 --> 02:14:17,260
Thirdly.

1194
02:14:17,784 --> 02:14:20,537
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1195
02:14:20,744 --> 02:14:24,862
For his outstanding courage and his great presence of mind

1196
02:14:25,424 --> 02:14:30,100
I award on behalf of Gryffindor 60 points.

1197
02:14:38,064 --> 02:14:39,895
We are equal with Slytherin

1198
02:14:40,104 --> 02:14:45,861
And finally...It takes great courage to
to resist your enemies.

1199
02:14:46,064 --> 02:14:49,773
but even more so to resist
against their friends.

1200
02:14:49,984 --> 02:14:52,817
I give it 10 points...

1201
02:14:53,024 --> 02:14:56,096
to Neville Longbottom.

1202
02:15:08,904 --> 02:15:12,180
If my calculations are correct

1203
02:15:12,384 --> 02:15:16,741
we need a small change in the decorations.

1204
02:15:21,584 --> 02:15:24,815
Gryffindor wins the dormitory trophy!

1205
02:16:01,304 --> 02:16:04,501
Come on, come on! Come on, hurry up! You'll be late.

1206
02:16:04,704 --> 02:16:08,822
The train is leaving soon! Come on, let's go.
Come on, hurry up.

1207
02:16:14,024 --> 02:16:17,175
Just a moment.

1208
02:16:23,184 --> 02:16:26,779
You weren't going to leave without saying goodbye, were you?

1209
02:16:29,864 --> 02:16:31,616
This one is for you.

1210
02:16:47,704 --> 02:16:49,740
Thank you Hagrid.

1211
02:16:55,344 --> 02:16:59,576
There you go, off you go. And by the way Harry...

1212
02:16:59,984 --> 02:17:04,262
Would your cousin Dudley.
That dork... give you trouble

1213
02:17:04,504 --> 02:17:07,064
you can always.....

1214
02:17:07,264 --> 02:17:10,017
threaten him with a pair of ears
to match his pigtail.

1215
02:17:10,224 --> 02:17:15,093
We're not allowed to practice magic outside Hogwarts.
You know that.

1216
02:17:15,544 --> 02:17:19,696
I know that...but your cousin doesn't,
does he?
