1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,079
<i>I used to want to
save the world.</i>

2
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,847
<i>This beautiful place.</i>

3
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:58,678
<i>But I knew so little then.</i>

4
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:03,274
<i>It is a land of
magic and wonder.</i>

5
00:01:04,343 --> 00:01:06,837
<i>Worth cherishing in every way.</i>

6
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:11,442
<i>But the closer you get...</i>

7
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,236
<i>...the more you see the great
darkness shimmering within.</i>

8
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,892
<i>And mankind?</i>

9
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:26,981
<i>Mankind is another
story altogether.</i>

10
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:34,150
<i>What one does when faced with the truth...
is more difficult than you think.</i>

11
00:01:44,464 --> 00:01:46,196
<i>I learned this the hard way.</i>

12
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:49,285
<i>A long long time ago.</i>

13
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:53,209
<i>And now...</i>

14
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:57,711
<i>...I will never be the same.</i>

15
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:06,844
Merci.

16
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:54,177
Hello, Diana.

17
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,108
<i>- Hello, Diana.
- Hello.</i>

18
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:58,004
<i>Diana!</i>

19
00:02:59,363 --> 00:03:00,439
Diana!

20
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,051
Come back!

21
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,443
- Looks very good.
- Very good.

22
00:03:43,644 --> 00:03:44,493
How is she?

23
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:45,788
She's good.

24
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:47,297
- Keep working.
- I will.

25
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:50,327
Niobi.

26
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:12,938
Diana!

27
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:16,046
Diana, I see you.

28
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:24,538
Where are you going?
Slow down!

29
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:36,645
Hello mother.

30
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,747
How are you today?

31
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:42,867
Let's get you back to school,
before another tutor quits.

32
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:46,454
But don't you think it's time
to start my training?

33
00:04:47,106 --> 00:04:48,913
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

34
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:50,979
Does she?

35
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,182
I could begin showing
her some things.

36
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:58,147
She should at least be
able to defend herself.

37
00:04:58,486 --> 00:04:59,487
From whom?

38
00:04:59,742 --> 00:05:01,569
In the event of an invasion.

39
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:05,071
Isn't that why I have the greatest
warrior in our history...

40
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:07,574
...leading an entire army,
General?

41
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:11,739
I pray there will never come
when she has to fight.

42
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,014
But you know,
a scorpion must sting...

43
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,698
- A wolf must hunt.
- She is a child.

44
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,287
The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.

45
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:21,333
But, mother...

46
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,731
There will be no training.

47
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,978
What if I promise to be careful?

48
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:34,810
It's time to sleep.

49
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,807
What if I didn't use a sword?

50
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,709
Fighting does not
make you a hero.

51
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:44,634
Just the shield then,
no sharp edges.

52
00:05:45,468 --> 00:05:48,905
Diana, you are the most precious
thing in the world to me.

53
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,798
I wished for you so much, so I
sculpted you from clay myself.

54
00:05:54,073 --> 00:05:56,564
...and begged Zeus
to give you life.

55
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,398
You've told me this story.

56
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:02,514
Which is why... tonight
I will tell you a new one.

57
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:06,326
The story of our people
and my days of battle.

58
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:07,386
Yes!

59
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,600
So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.

60
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:20,175
<i>Long ago, when time was new...</i>

61
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:23,804
<i>...and all of history
was still a dream...</i>

62
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,307
<i>...the gods ruled the earth.</i>

63
00:06:26,573 --> 00:06:29,141
<i>Zeus king among them.</i>

64
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:34,916
<i>Zeus created beings over
which the Gods would rule.</i>

65
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:37,964
<i>Beings born in his image...</i>

66
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:41,826
<i>...fair and good,
strong and passionate.</i>

67
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:46,657
<i>He called his creation "Man".
And mankind was good.</i>

68
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:50,863
<i>But Zeus' son.. grew
envious of mankind...</i>

69
00:06:51,164 --> 00:06:54,229
<i>...and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.</i>

70
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:58,704
<i>This was Ares,
the God of War.</i>

71
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:05,075
<i>Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.</i>

72
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:07,369
<i>He turned them against
one another...</i>

73
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,564
<i>...and war ravaged the Earth.</i>

74
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:15,680
<i>So, the gods created
us, the Amazons...</i>

75
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:18,329
<i>...to influence men's
hearts with love...</i>

76
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,027
<i>...and restore
peace to the Earth.</i>

77
00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:27,152
<i>And for a brief time,
there was peace.</i>

78
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,476
<i>But it did not last.</i>

79
00:07:41,264 --> 00:07:44,970
<i>Your mother, The Amazon
Queen, led a revolt...</i>

80
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:48,073
<i>...that freed us all
from enslavement.</i>

81
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,370
<i>When Zeus led the gods
to our defence...</i>

82
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:01,703
<i>...Ares killed
them one by one...</i>

83
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:05,059
<i>...until only Zeus
himself remained.</i>

84
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:10,848
<i>Zeus used the last of his
power to stop Ares...</i>

85
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:16,393
<i>...striking such a blow, the god
of war was forced to retreat.</i>

86
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:18,789
<i>But Zeus knew...</i>

87
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:23,128
<i>...that one day Ares might
return to finish his mission.</i>

88
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:25,064
<i>An endless war...</i>

89
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:28,653
<i>...where mankind would finally
destroy themselves...</i>

90
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,221
<i>...and us with them.</i>

91
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:34,923
<i>So Zeus, left us a weapon.</i>

92
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:38,222
<i>...One powerful enough
to kill a god.</i>

93
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:43,442
<i>With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island...</i>

94
00:08:43,443 --> 00:08:45,616
<i>to hide us from
the outside world...</i>

95
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:48,238
<i>...Somewhere Ares
could not find us.</i>

96
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,019
<i>And all has been
quiet ever since.</i>

97
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:06,877
We give thanks to the gods
for giving us this paradise.

98
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:10,305
And the God Killer?

99
00:09:15,077 --> 00:09:16,108
The God Killer?

100
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:18,823
The weapon that is strong
enough to kill a God.

101
00:09:19,864 --> 00:09:21,147
Can I see it?

102
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:33,137
The Gods gave us many gifts.

103
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,338
One day, you'll know them all.

104
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,853
This great tower
is where we keep them.

105
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:52,514
The God Killer.

106
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:57,761
It's beautiful.

107
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:00,719
Who would wield it?

108
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:05,873
I pray it will never
be called to arms.

109
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,563
But only the fiercest
among us even could.

110
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:11,975
And that's not you, Diana.

111
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:15,177
You see?
You are safe...

112
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:18,599
...and there is nothing you
should concern yourself with.

113
00:10:31,975 --> 00:10:33,572
You keep doubting
yourself, Diana.

114
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:36,001
- No, I don't.
- Yes. You do.

115
00:10:36,656 --> 00:10:37,657
No, I don't.

116
00:10:42,313 --> 00:10:46,341
You arestronger than you believe.
You have greater powers than you know.

117
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,651
- But if you don't try harder...
- Diana!

118
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,494
Are you hurt?

119
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:03,003
No, Mother, I'm fine.

120
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:04,897
- I was just...
- Training.

121
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:08,819
Seems I'm not the
revered queen I should be.

122
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:11,339
Disobeyed, betrayed
by my own sister...

123
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,689
No, mother. It was me.
I asked her...

124
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,951
Take her to the palace.

125
00:11:17,238 --> 00:11:18,239
Off you go.

126
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:28,604
You left me no
choice, Hippolyta.

127
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:32,940
You neglect your duty,
if she cannot fight.

128
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:35,277
You speak of a time
that may never come.

129
00:11:37,178 --> 00:11:41,382
He might never return.
He could have died from his wounds.

130
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:44,294
Ares is alive.

131
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,999
You feel it as I do,
in your bones.

132
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:51,078
It is only a matter of
time before he returns.

133
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:58,880
The stronger she gets,
the sooner he will find her.

134
00:11:59,104 --> 00:12:01,769
Hippolyta,
I love her as you do.

135
00:12:03,344 --> 00:12:06,315
But this is the only way
to truly protect her.

136
00:12:17,385 --> 00:12:20,711
You will train her harder
than any Amazon before her.

137
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:23,124
Five times harder...

138
00:12:23,503 --> 00:12:25,506
...ten times harder.

139
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:28,609
Until she's better
than even you.

140
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,012
But she must never
know the truth...

141
00:12:31,263 --> 00:12:32,669
about what she is...

142
00:12:33,414 --> 00:12:35,417
...or how she came to be.

143
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,071
Harder.

144
00:13:31,088 --> 00:13:33,229
You are stronger
than this, Diana.

145
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:35,271
Again.

146
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,099
Never let your guard down.

147
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:56,936
You expect the battle to be fair.

148
00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:58,698
A battle will never be fair.

149
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:13,717
Antiope!

150
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:16,632
Lay still..

151
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:18,159
You're bleeding.

152
00:14:19,137 --> 00:14:21,661
- I'm sorry...
- Wait, Diana.

153
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:29,134
What had I done?

154
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:32,408
I'm sorry.

155
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:05,673
Where did this fog come from?

156
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:12,294
There...
Go forward.

157
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:30,126
<i>There he is!</i>

158
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,858
<i>- The pilot! I can see him.
- He's there!</i>

159
00:18:03,576 --> 00:18:04,877
Wow.

160
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:09,185
You are a man.

161
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:16,402
Yeah. I mean...

162
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:20,092
Do I not look like one?

163
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:25,828
Where are we?

164
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:27,819
Themyscira.

165
00:18:27,935 --> 00:18:28,951
What?

166
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,526
Who are you?

167
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,516
I'm one of the good guys and
those are the bad guys.

168
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:42,722
What?

169
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,869
The Germans.
Come on, we need to get out of here.

170
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:46,625
- The Germans?
- Diana!

171
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:49,391
Step away from her. Now!

172
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:53,472
Ready your bows!

173
00:18:56,546 --> 00:18:57,884
They have guns.
Right?

174
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:01,769
Fire!

175
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,109
Come on!

176
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:42,930
Stay down!

177
00:21:21,217 --> 00:21:22,636
Shield!

178
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:44,868
No!

179
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:47,068
No!

180
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,277
No.

181
00:21:53,686 --> 00:21:57,286
No. No.
Antiope.

182
00:21:57,448 --> 00:22:00,041
Antiope, hey.

183
00:22:03,863 --> 00:22:04,886
Diana.

184
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,572
- The time has come.
- No.

185
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,511
You... you must...

186
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,807
What?
What, Antiope?

187
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,043
God Killer!

188
00:22:20,836 --> 00:22:22,773
- Diana, go...
- Go where?

189
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,761
- Where?
- Go...

190
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:29,190
No, please no.
No, no!

191
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:32,576
- No!
- Antiope!

192
00:22:34,528 --> 00:22:35,541
No!

193
00:22:42,713 --> 00:22:44,391
- You.
- No..

194
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:46,821
No mother no.

195
00:22:46,846 --> 00:22:48,454
He fought at my side
against the invaders.

196
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:50,800
What man fights against
his own people?

197
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:51,733
These aren't my people.

198
00:22:51,743 --> 00:22:54,053
Then, why do you
wear their colors?

199
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:57,111
I can't tell you that.

200
00:22:57,136 --> 00:22:58,488
You need to tell us now!

201
00:22:58,588 --> 00:22:59,479
What's your name?

202
00:23:00,955 --> 00:23:02,241
I can't tell you that either.

203
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:06,089
We should kill him now
and be done with it.

204
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:07,416
If he dies...

205
00:23:07,775 --> 00:23:11,966
...we know nothing about who
they are and why they came.

206
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:20,969
My...

207
00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:27,149
Name is Captain Steve Trevor, pilot,
American Expeditionary Forces.

208
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:30,537
Serial number 8141921.

209
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,499
Assigned to British
Intelligence.

210
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:43,010
What the hell is this thing?

211
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:46,012
The lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

212
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:47,908
But it's really hot.

213
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:50,914
It is pointless and
painful to resist.

214
00:23:52,002 --> 00:23:53,260
What is your mission?

215
00:23:53,497 --> 00:23:57,123
Whoever you are, you are in more danger
than you think.

216
00:23:57,223 --> 00:23:58,663
What is your mission?

217
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,793
I am a...

218
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,492
I am a...

219
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,503
I'm a spy.

220
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:18,946
I'm a spy.
I'm a spy.

221
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,160
<i>British Intelligence got word...</i>

222
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,955
<i>...that the leader of the
German Army Gen. Ludendorff.</i>

223
00:24:26,182 --> 00:24:30,005
<i>...would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman empire.</i>

224
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:33,104
<i>I posed as one of their
pilots and flew in with them.</i>

225
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:36,923
<i>According to our Intel, the
Germans had no troops left...</i>

226
00:24:36,948 --> 00:24:39,768
<i>...no money, no
munitions of any kind.</i>

227
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:44,531
<i>But our Intel was wrong. The German
had the Turks building bombs for 'em.</i>

228
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:46,874
<i>And not just bombs, new weapons.</i>

229
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:48,483
<i>Secret weapons.</i>

230
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:55,226
<i>Invented by Ludendorff's chief
psychopath, Dr. Isabelle Maru.</i>

231
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:59,563
<i>The boys in the trenches
called her "Doctor Poison".</i>

232
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:01,975
<i>And for good reason.</i>

233
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:34,565
<i>From what I could tell if Dr. Maru
was able to complete her work,</i>

234
00:25:34,685 --> 00:25:37,986
<i>...millions more would die.
The war would never end.</i>

235
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:40,148
<i>I was there to observe and
report, nothing more...</i>

236
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:43,393
<i>...but, I had
to do something.</i>

237
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:55,059
...penetrate the mask. Which is...
I need more time.

238
00:25:55,157 --> 00:25:56,904
Unfortunately Dr.,
we do not have more time.

239
00:25:56,905 --> 00:25:59,394
This work, this...

240
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,647
Get that man!

241
00:26:06,672 --> 00:26:07,736
Now!

242
00:27:01,465 --> 00:27:04,473
But if I can get these notes back to
the British Intelligence in time...

243
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:08,292
...it could stop
millions more from dying.

244
00:27:08,492 --> 00:27:10,683
It could stop the war.

245
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:12,979
War? What war?

246
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:16,684
The War.

247
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:22,057
The war to-to end all wars.

248
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:25,061
Four years...

249
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:29,835
27 countries...
25 million dead.

250
00:27:30,453 --> 00:27:32,155
Soldiers and civilians.

251
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:34,713
Innocent people...

252
00:27:35,393 --> 00:27:37,627
...women and
children slaughtered.

253
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:42,213
Their homes and their villages
looted and burned.

254
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:49,456
Weapons far deadlier
than you can...

255
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,397
...ever imagine.

256
00:27:57,924 --> 00:27:59,871
It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

257
00:28:00,902 --> 00:28:03,009
It's like the world's gonna end.

258
00:28:04,868 --> 00:28:06,128
Should we let him go?

259
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:09,231
And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?

260
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:11,304
We can not hold him
forever, my queen.

261
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:13,276
Mother, excuse me...

262
00:28:13,301 --> 00:28:17,559
...but after everything the
man said, this must be Ares.

263
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:18,882
What are you talking
about, child?

264
00:28:18,883 --> 00:28:22,354
Forgive me, Senator, but the man
called it a war without end.

265
00:28:23,047 --> 00:28:25,102
Millions of people already dead.

266
00:28:25,812 --> 00:28:27,743
Like nothing he's ever seen.

267
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,682
Only Ares could do such a thing.

268
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,976
We can not simply let him go.
We must go with him.

269
00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:38,506
I will not deploy our army and
leave them scare defences...

270
00:28:38,606 --> 00:28:39,365
...to go and fight their war.

271
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:41,285
It's not their war.

272
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,539
Zeus created man to be just, and
wise, strong and passionate...

273
00:28:44,564 --> 00:28:46,955
That was a story, Diana!

274
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,641
This much, you
do not understand?

275
00:28:48,642 --> 00:28:49,643
Men are easily corrupted.

276
00:28:50,014 --> 00:28:52,178
Yes, but Ares is behind
that corruption!

277
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,990
It is Ares who has these
Germans fighting..

278
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:59,762
And stopping the God of war
is our fore-ordinance.

279
00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:02,671
As Amazons this is our duty.

280
00:29:02,744 --> 00:29:06,126
But you're not an Amazon
like the rest of us.

281
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:08,062
So you will do nothing.

282
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,230
As your queen I forbid it.

283
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,516
Strange.

284
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:28,037
Is it true you saved his life?

285
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:29,744
Who told you that?

286
00:29:30,093 --> 00:29:31,094
He did.

287
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,586
Ah... I didn't see you come in.

288
00:30:04,563 --> 00:30:07,446
Would you say you are a...

289
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:11,107
...a typical example
of your sex?

290
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,628
I am...

291
00:30:16,217 --> 00:30:17,893
...above average.

292
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:22,866
What's that?

293
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,166
It's a...

294
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:29,274
Oh...

295
00:30:32,156 --> 00:30:33,156
It's a watch.

296
00:30:33,978 --> 00:30:34,979
A watch?

297
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,351
Yeah, it's a watch.

298
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:37,986
Tells time.

299
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:40,524
My father gave it to me.

300
00:30:42,326 --> 00:30:43,726
Went through hell 'n back with him.

301
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,082
Now it's for me and,
good thing it's still ticking..

302
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:50,204
What for?

303
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:53,746
Because it tells time.

304
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,626
When to eat, sleep,
wake up, work...

305
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,125
You let this little thing
tell you what to do?

306
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:03,891
Yeah...

307
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:11,797
Can I ask you some questions?

308
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,040
- Where are we?
- Themyscira.

309
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:18,821
No, I got that before, but I mean...
where are we?

310
00:31:19,732 --> 00:31:21,717
What is this place?
Who are you people?

311
00:31:21,817 --> 00:31:24,025
Why does the water do that?

312
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:26,677
How come you don't know what a watch is?
How can you speak English so well?

313
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:28,460
We speak hundreds of languages.

314
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:32,724
We are the bridge to a greater
understanding between all men.

315
00:31:34,955 --> 00:31:36,178
Right.

316
00:31:39,512 --> 00:31:42,359
You know, I didn't get a chance
to say this...

317
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:48,021
...earlier, but thank you for
dragging me out of the water.

318
00:31:49,446 --> 00:31:50,831
Thank you...

319
00:31:51,571 --> 00:31:53,760
...for what you
did on the beach.

320
00:32:01,735 --> 00:32:02,735
So...

321
00:32:04,107 --> 00:32:05,557
...you are here to let me go?

322
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:10,421
I tried, but it's not up to me.

323
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,811
I even asked them to
send me with you..

324
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:16,802
Or anyone.

325
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:18,161
An Amazon.

326
00:32:18,314 --> 00:32:20,216
The Amazons.

327
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:21,426
The Amazons?

328
00:32:21,681 --> 00:32:24,327
It is our sacred duty
to defend the world.

329
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:27,209
And I wish to go..

330
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:32,037
But my mother will not allow it.

331
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,511
Well...

332
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:38,399
I can't say I blame her.

333
00:32:39,412 --> 00:32:40,601
The way this war's going...

334
00:32:40,602 --> 00:32:43,102
...I don't wanna let
anyone I care about near.

335
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,563
Then why do you want to go back?

336
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,210
I don't think "want"
is the word, right?

337
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:52,565
I guess I gotta try.

338
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:57,088
My father told me
once he said...

339
00:32:57,095 --> 00:32:59,174
"If you see something wrong
happening in the world...

340
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:01,834
"you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."

341
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:05,537
And I already tried nothing.

342
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:45,692
Nice outfit.

343
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,565
Oh, thank you.

344
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:51,413
Now.. I'll show you the
way off the Island...

345
00:35:52,179 --> 00:35:53,743
...and you'll take me to Ares.

346
00:35:54,843 --> 00:35:55,844
Deal.

347
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:06,027
I am leaving on that?

348
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:07,534
We are..

349
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:10,905
Yeah, we're leaving in that?

350
00:36:11,105 --> 00:36:12,507
Do you not know how to sail?

351
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,984
Of course I know how to sail.

352
00:36:13,994 --> 00:36:15,956
Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just...

353
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,426
It's been a while.

354
00:36:47,557 --> 00:36:49,022
I am going, mother.

355
00:36:49,913 --> 00:36:53,018
I cannot stand by while
innocent lives are lost.

356
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:58,407
If no one else will defend the
world from Ares, then I must.

357
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,438
I have to go.

358
00:37:01,815 --> 00:37:02,937
I know.

359
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,714
Or at least I know I
can not stop you.

360
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:14,039
There is so much...

361
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,116
So much you do not understand.

362
00:37:16,117 --> 00:37:17,338
I understand enough.

363
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:21,684
But I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves.

364
00:37:24,504 --> 00:37:25,965
Like you once did.

365
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:28,573
You know that if you
choose to leave...

366
00:37:30,193 --> 00:37:31,791
...you may never return.

367
00:37:33,379 --> 00:37:35,563
Who will I be if I stay?

368
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:47,491
This belonged to the greatest
warrior in our history...

369
00:37:47,804 --> 00:37:49,991
...our beloved Antiope.

370
00:37:50,152 --> 00:37:52,525
Make sure you're worthy of it.

371
00:37:54,124 --> 00:37:55,685
I will.

372
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:01,156
Be careful in the
world of men, Diana.

373
00:38:02,892 --> 00:38:05,266
They do not deserve you.

374
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:12,653
You have been my greatest love.

375
00:38:16,584 --> 00:38:18,097
Today...

376
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,778
...you are my greatest sorrow.

377
00:39:00,895 --> 00:39:02,548
Should you have told her?

378
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:07,764
The more she knows, the
sooner he will find her.

379
00:39:19,229 --> 00:39:21,121
How long until we reach the war?

380
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:24,456
The war, which part?

381
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,292
The Western Front in France is...

382
00:39:26,301 --> 00:39:28,695
...400 miles long, from the
Alps to the North Sea.

383
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:32,236
Where the fighting is
the most intense then.

384
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,290
If you take me there, I'm
sure I'll find Ares.

385
00:39:39,015 --> 00:39:41,246
Ares as in...
the God of War?

386
00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:45,346
The God of war is our responsibility.
Only an Amazon can defeat him.

387
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,258
With this.

388
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:51,013
And once I do...

389
00:39:51,352 --> 00:39:53,174
...the war will end.

390
00:39:59,985 --> 00:40:02,462
Look. I appreciate your spirit...

391
00:40:02,854 --> 00:40:04,401
...but this war is...

392
00:40:04,455 --> 00:40:07,413
It's a great big mess.

393
00:40:08,037 --> 00:40:10,812
And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.

394
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:13,679
I mean, we can get back to London
and try to look for men who can.

395
00:40:13,773 --> 00:40:15,758
I'm the man who can!

396
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:17,978
Once I find and destroy Ares...

397
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,855
...the German armies will be
freed from his influence...

398
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:23,441
...they will good men again
and the world will be better.

399
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:29,072
Great.

400
00:40:29,758 --> 00:40:30,809
You will see.

401
00:40:34,395 --> 00:40:35,196
What are you doing?

402
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:38,340
I thought maybe you wanna...

403
00:40:39,394 --> 00:40:40,544
...get some sleep.

404
00:40:43,536 --> 00:40:46,414
What about you?
Are you not sleeping?

405
00:40:46,681 --> 00:40:48,507
Does the average man not sleep?

406
00:40:52,731 --> 00:40:55,554
Yes, we sleep. We just
don't sleep with a...

407
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:56,971
You don't sleep with women?

408
00:40:57,167 --> 00:40:59,904
No, I mean, I do, I sleep with...
I sleep with...

409
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:02,697
Yes, I do.

410
00:41:02,722 --> 00:41:04,334
But out of the...

411
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,448
...confines of marriage.

412
00:41:12,031 --> 00:41:14,006
Not polite to assume, you know?

413
00:41:18,036 --> 00:41:19,354
"Marriage"?

414
00:41:19,355 --> 00:41:21,239
Weird! You don't have that...

415
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:23,888
You go before a judge...

416
00:41:24,213 --> 00:41:28,695
...and you swear to love, honor
and cherish each other...

417
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,897
...until death do you apart.

418
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:32,719
And do they... love
each other till death?

419
00:41:33,001 --> 00:41:34,836
Not very often, no.

420
00:41:34,861 --> 00:41:36,288
Then why do they do it?

421
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:38,894
I have no idea.

422
00:41:40,474 --> 00:41:42,720
So you cannot sleep
with me unless I marry you...

423
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,562
I will sleep with you if you want.
I'll sleep right there.

424
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:45,647
There is plenty of room.

425
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:48,239
- Then fine, if you don't mind...
- No, it's up to you.

426
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:51,074
- I'm just fine.
- Coming to sleep with you.

427
00:41:51,163 --> 00:41:52,284
Okay.

428
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:18,488
You know, where I come from,
I'm not considered average.

429
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,844
You know, um...
being a spy...

430
00:42:22,142 --> 00:42:25,217
You have to show a
certain amount of...

431
00:42:26,867 --> 00:42:28,066
...vigor.

432
00:42:31,404 --> 00:42:34,733
Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?

433
00:42:34,975 --> 00:42:36,582
I have no father.

434
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:38,876
My mother sculpted
me from clay...

435
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:41,292
...and I was brought
to life by Zeus.

436
00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:45,716
Well that's neat.

437
00:42:49,428 --> 00:42:50,429
Sorry.

438
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:54,921
Where I come from...

439
00:42:56,359 --> 00:42:58,535
...babies are made differently.

440
00:42:59,593 --> 00:43:01,432
You refer to
reproductive biology.

441
00:43:01,457 --> 00:43:03,150
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know.

442
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:05,463
I know all about that.

443
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:08,549
I mean I refer to that
and other things.

444
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,778
The pleasures of the flesh.

445
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,231
Do you know about that?

446
00:43:16,841 --> 00:43:20,441
I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's
criticism on earthly pleasures.

447
00:43:22,323 --> 00:43:23,623
All 12, huh?

448
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:30,221
Did you bring any
of those with you?

449
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:31,991
You would not enjoy them.

450
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:33,426
I don't know.
May be.

451
00:43:33,642 --> 00:43:34,647
No you wouldn't.

452
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:35,912
Why not?

453
00:43:36,453 --> 00:43:39,552
They came to the conclusion that men
are essential for procreation...

454
00:43:39,592 --> 00:43:41,577
...but when it comes
to pleasure...

455
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:43,775
...unnecessary.

456
00:43:43,945 --> 00:43:44,946
No.

457
00:43:50,256 --> 00:43:51,257
Goodnight.

458
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:06,775
How long until we're operational?

459
00:44:07,076 --> 00:44:08,397
Two days, sir.

460
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:10,280
We'll have it up
tonight, Captain.

461
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:14,625
Sir, the men have had
no food, no sleep.

462
00:44:14,626 --> 00:44:16,787
Do you think I have had a
neat food or rest, captain?

463
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:19,266
Do you hear me making excuses?

464
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:20,066
No.

465
00:44:20,222 --> 00:44:21,965
Your men, they are
weak, complacent.

466
00:44:22,165 --> 00:44:24,610
You've let them forget for an
attack can happen at any time.

467
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,140
...from any cover!

468
00:44:26,321 --> 00:44:27,821
So let's you and I remind them...

469
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:28,982
Shall we?

470
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,336
- Doctor.
- General.

471
00:44:45,566 --> 00:44:46,567
Progress?

472
00:44:46,689 --> 00:44:47,996
Not enough.

473
00:44:48,808 --> 00:44:50,639
It is over, General.

474
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,724
Germany is giving up.

475
00:44:52,915 --> 00:44:56,818
Von Hindenburg has recommended
the Kaiser sign the armistice.

476
00:44:57,141 --> 00:44:59,108
We have run out of time.

477
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:03,462
As soon as the Kaiser sees
the newest weapon...

478
00:45:03,711 --> 00:45:05,434
...he will not
sign the armistice.

479
00:45:05,435 --> 00:45:06,622
But without my notebook...

480
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,207
We will get your book!

481
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:10,719
It is you that I believe in,
not it.

482
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:15,199
I know that you can
and will succeed...

483
00:45:16,987 --> 00:45:20,276
It is what you're put
on this earth to do.

484
00:45:23,923 --> 00:45:27,257
Something, did come
to me last night.

485
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,482
A different type of gas.

486
00:45:30,713 --> 00:45:31,616
For you.

487
00:45:32,123 --> 00:45:34,067
To restore your strength.

488
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,842
I have got it!
I have got it!

489
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:10,095
And if it's what I think...

490
00:46:11,397 --> 00:46:13,262
It's going to be...

491
00:46:14,804 --> 00:46:16,279
...terrible.

492
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:38,845
Morning!

493
00:46:39,238 --> 00:46:41,935
We got lucky. We caught a
ride, we make some good time.

494
00:46:42,336 --> 00:46:44,621
Welcome to jolly old London!

495
00:46:44,907 --> 00:46:46,549
It's hideous.

496
00:46:46,758 --> 00:46:48,562
Yeah, it's not for everybody.

497
00:47:10,568 --> 00:47:12,185
- Good morning Darling.
- What a babe.

498
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:13,439
Oh no!

499
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,929
Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much.

500
00:47:17,895 --> 00:47:19,754
Come on!

501
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,871
Why are they holding hands?

502
00:47:23,811 --> 00:47:25,994
Probably because
they're together.

503
00:47:28,793 --> 00:47:31,379
No... No.. We're not together,
I mean, in that way.

504
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:32,665
This way.

505
00:47:32,765 --> 00:47:33,766
To the war!

506
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:36,754
Well, technically, the war is that way.
But we gotta get this way first.

507
00:47:36,764 --> 00:47:38,110
And where are we going?

508
00:47:38,431 --> 00:47:40,102
We gotta get this
notebook to my superiors.

509
00:47:40,103 --> 00:47:41,423
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

510
00:47:41,424 --> 00:47:44,595
No, no, no, no. I let you go.
You take me to Ares.

511
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,593
- We made a deal, Steve Trevor.
- Yeah.

512
00:47:46,594 --> 00:47:48,056
And a deal is a promise.

513
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,198
And a promise is unbreakable.

514
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,153
Oi, damn it, alright.

515
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:55,936
Come with me first
to deliver this...

516
00:47:56,232 --> 00:47:57,792
...and then we'll
get you a ticket...

517
00:47:58,809 --> 00:47:59,810
...to the war.

518
00:48:00,093 --> 00:48:01,094
Deal?

519
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:03,728
- Let's go.
- Diana...

520
00:48:03,937 --> 00:48:04,753
What are you doing?

521
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:07,194
You can not do that because
you're not wearing any clothes.

522
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:10,430
Let's go... Let's go
buy some clothes.

523
00:48:10,718 --> 00:48:12,635
What do these women
wear into battle?

524
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,012
They don't...

525
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:15,875
A baby!

526
00:48:17,153 --> 00:48:18,371
No, no.
No babies.

527
00:48:20,403 --> 00:48:22,253
This one's not made out of clay.

528
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:23,618
Come on.

529
00:48:23,837 --> 00:48:25,846
Diana! Please.

530
00:48:41,268 --> 00:48:42,501
Thank God! You're not dead!

531
00:48:45,237 --> 00:48:46,805
Hurray!

532
00:48:46,806 --> 00:48:49,139
I did think you're dead till
I got your call, you know?

533
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,081
He's been gone for weeks.
Not a single word.

534
00:48:52,404 --> 00:48:53,405
Very unlike him.

535
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:55,860
I am introducing myself.
It's Etta Candy.

536
00:48:55,861 --> 00:48:57,878
I am Steve Trevor's secretary.

537
00:48:58,165 --> 00:48:59,363
What is a secretary?

538
00:49:00,017 --> 00:49:01,018
Well, I do everything.

539
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,672
I go where he tells me to go and
I do what he tells me to do.

540
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:06,172
Well, where I am from,
that's called slavery.

541
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:07,445
I really like her.

542
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,032
Fantastic.
Ladies after you.

543
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:10,202
Oh, I do, I like her.

544
00:49:18,865 --> 00:49:22,886
Is this what passes for
armor in your country?

545
00:49:23,636 --> 00:49:25,517
Ah. well, "Oh my".
It's fashion.

546
00:49:25,744 --> 00:49:27,150
Keeps our tummies in.

547
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:28,853
Why must you keep them in?

548
00:49:29,186 --> 00:49:31,311
Any woman with a tummy
would ask that question!

549
00:49:33,105 --> 00:49:36,525
Conservative, but
not entirely unfun.

550
00:49:37,749 --> 00:49:39,074
Try it on at least.

551
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,452
Very well.

552
00:49:41,841 --> 00:49:42,842
No!

553
00:49:50,218 --> 00:49:51,219
Come on!

554
00:50:00,491 --> 00:50:03,153
How can a woman
possibly fight in this?

555
00:50:03,532 --> 00:50:04,542
Fight?

556
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,151
We use our principles.

557
00:50:06,428 --> 00:50:08,108
I mean that's how we are
gonna get to vote.

558
00:50:08,325 --> 00:50:11,936
Although I am not opposed to
engaging in a bitter fist stickups...

559
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:13,861
...should the occasion arise.

560
00:50:15,316 --> 00:50:16,521
Lovely.

561
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:20,485
It's itching.
It's choking me.

562
00:50:21,959 --> 00:50:23,836
Can they blame it?

563
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:25,371
Etta.

564
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:26,649
Where is she?

565
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:29,133
She's trying on up to number 226.

566
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:42,046
Ms. Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less

567
00:50:42,269 --> 00:50:43,286
...distracting.

568
00:50:45,704 --> 00:50:46,815
May I?

569
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,653
Yeah, really? Specs?

570
00:50:52,867 --> 00:50:55,307
Certainly she's not the most beautiful
woman you've ever seen?

571
00:51:01,774 --> 00:51:02,968
Better.

572
00:51:14,174 --> 00:51:15,389
Yep, that's not gonna work.

573
00:51:15,668 --> 00:51:17,316
Please put the
sword down, Diana.

574
00:51:17,568 --> 00:51:18,569
Diana!

575
00:51:19,789 --> 00:51:20,790
Let me try it by myself.

576
00:51:21,096 --> 00:51:22,096
After you, sir.

577
00:51:31,642 --> 00:51:32,672
Etta...

578
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,364
Why don't I meet you
back at the office?

579
00:51:35,614 --> 00:51:37,435
And meanwhile, I'll take
this for safekeeping.

580
00:51:37,714 --> 00:51:38,715
Oh no, I don't think so.

581
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:40,545
You gotta put the sword down, Diana.
Please.

582
00:51:40,781 --> 00:51:42,553
- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- At all.

583
00:51:42,554 --> 00:51:44,840
Put the sword down,
first of all.

584
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:50,835
Promise me you'll protect
it with your life.

585
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,241
Yes... no.

586
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:55,434
You can trust her.
Just hand that over.

587
00:51:55,819 --> 00:51:57,611
- Shield.
- And the shield to her...

588
00:51:59,043 --> 00:52:00,075
You got it? Thanks, Etta.

589
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,317
This is easy.

590
00:52:03,648 --> 00:52:04,649
There we go.

591
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:33,661
What is it?

592
00:52:35,684 --> 00:52:37,736
Hopefully, nothing.
Come on.

593
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,502
- Steve, why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on, come on!

594
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,735
Captain Trevor.

595
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,648
I believe you have something that
is the property of Gen. Ludendorff.

596
00:53:06,409 --> 00:53:08,882
Ah, it's the bad guy convention.

597
00:53:09,661 --> 00:53:11,239
Give us Dr. Maru's note book.

598
00:53:12,069 --> 00:53:13,469
Where I put that thing?

599
00:53:15,644 --> 00:53:16,445
Stand back!

600
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:28,631
Or maybe not.

601
00:53:44,716 --> 00:53:45,717
Oh, tough luck.

602
00:53:52,499 --> 00:53:54,545
Is there anything else
you wanna show me?

603
00:53:55,549 --> 00:53:57,236
Where do you think you're going?

604
00:54:03,978 --> 00:54:06,469
I'm sorry, but you're clearly
under Ares' control.

605
00:54:07,064 --> 00:54:09,377
- Diana.
- Let me help you get free.

606
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:11,077
Where will I find Ares?

607
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,289
He's... He's dead.

608
00:54:21,584 --> 00:54:22,743
Cyanide.

609
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:33,346
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

610
00:54:33,588 --> 00:54:36,221
<i>Come on! Gentlemen, please!</i>

611
00:54:41,704 --> 00:54:43,048
<i>Let him speak!</i>

612
00:54:43,148 --> 00:54:44,406
Yes thank you, gentlemen...

613
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:49,055
<i>Germany is an immensely
proud nation.</i>

614
00:54:50,312 --> 00:54:52,213
<i>They will never surrender.</i>

615
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:55,240
<i>Now look.
The only way to end this war...</i>

616
00:54:55,241 --> 00:54:57,876
Colonel, I need to
talk to you outside.

617
00:54:57,976 --> 00:55:00,562
<i>...and restore world peace...</i>

618
00:55:01,194 --> 00:55:02,836
<i>is to negotiate...</i>

619
00:55:04,643 --> 00:55:06,226
...an armistice.

620
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:08,432
<i>There's a woman.</i>

621
00:55:09,422 --> 00:55:10,886
What is she doing here?
Get her out.

622
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,091
Ger her out.

623
00:55:14,734 --> 00:55:15,735
Sorry.

624
00:55:15,783 --> 00:55:18,238
Blind sister,
she got lost on the way to her bathroom.

625
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:20,417
I think it's this way.
Sorry guys.

626
00:55:21,144 --> 00:55:23,099
<i>Our only aim at this time...</i>

627
00:55:23,124 --> 00:55:25,944
<i>...must be to achieve peace...</i>

628
00:55:25,945 --> 00:55:27,948
<i>...at any cost!</i>

629
00:55:31,556 --> 00:55:33,854
Why you been not hearing speech?
He is talking of peace.

630
00:55:33,855 --> 00:55:35,466
Not right now!

631
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:43,050
Trevor, what the hell were you thinking
bringing a woman into the counsel?

632
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:45,063
The Intel that I brought
back is time sensitive.

633
00:55:45,356 --> 00:55:47,281
This is one of Dr.
Maru's notebooks.

634
00:55:47,381 --> 00:55:48,017
Notebook or notes...

635
00:55:48,068 --> 00:55:48,945
We need to get it
to Cryptography.

636
00:55:48,946 --> 00:55:50,724
And I need a immediate
audience with the generals.

637
00:55:50,725 --> 00:55:52,807
You do not just barge in here.

638
00:55:52,841 --> 00:55:54,575
Sir with all due respect.
What I saw in my last trip...

639
00:55:54,576 --> 00:55:55,712
...will change the
course of war.

640
00:55:55,713 --> 00:55:57,303
Captain Trevor!

641
00:55:59,425 --> 00:56:01,151
I heard we lost you in
one of your mission...

642
00:56:01,152 --> 00:56:02,583
...and yet here you are,
back from the dead...

643
00:56:02,584 --> 00:56:04,534
...and I see you
brought a friend with you.

644
00:56:04,563 --> 00:56:06,325
My deepest apology for
interruption sir.

645
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:07,993
No, no no... nonsense.

646
00:56:08,196 --> 00:56:09,961
Thanks to this young woman...

647
00:56:10,263 --> 00:56:13,612
...the room was finally quiet enough
for me to get at least a few words in.

648
00:56:13,863 --> 00:56:15,914
Sir Patrick Morgan,
at your service.

649
00:56:16,036 --> 00:56:17,888
Diana, princess of the...

650
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,870
"Prince". Diana Prince.

651
00:56:20,738 --> 00:56:21,786
She is...

652
00:56:22,036 --> 00:56:23,037
and I...

653
00:56:23,203 --> 00:56:24,204
...are...

654
00:56:24,366 --> 00:56:25,367
...working together.

655
00:56:25,897 --> 00:56:27,979
She actually helped me bring
this notebook back here.

656
00:56:28,122 --> 00:56:29,784
That's from Dr. Maru's lab.

657
00:56:29,809 --> 00:56:33,076
I think the information it contains
inside will change the course of the war.

658
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:35,101
My... God.

659
00:56:36,141 --> 00:56:38,048
- Dr. Poison herself.
- Yes.

660
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:09,442
Yes.

661
00:57:10,049 --> 00:57:11,250
Intriguing.

662
00:57:11,509 --> 00:57:12,872
Any further intelligence?

663
00:57:13,118 --> 00:57:15,881
Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography had no luck.

664
00:57:16,101 --> 00:57:18,040
It seems like it's a mixture
of two languages...

665
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,834
...but as if they failed to
determine which two languages.

666
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:23,708
Ottoman and Sumerian.

667
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,388
Surely someone else in
this room knew that.

668
00:57:28,668 --> 00:57:29,699
Who is this woman?

669
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:31,650
She is my...

670
00:57:32,484 --> 00:57:33,485
...secretary, sir.

671
00:57:33,986 --> 00:57:36,218
And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?

672
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,092
She's a very good secretary.

673
00:57:40,433 --> 00:57:43,071
Sir, if this woman
can read it...

674
00:57:43,302 --> 00:57:45,128
...we should hear
what she has to say.

675
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:47,025
Yes, very well.

676
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,854
It's a formula...

677
00:57:55,336 --> 00:57:57,834
...for a new kind of gas.

678
00:57:57,859 --> 00:58:00,592
Mustard gas, hydrogen
based instead of sulfur.

679
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:02,002
<i>Hydrogen based...</i>

680
00:58:02,303 --> 00:58:04,814
Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen.

681
00:58:05,103 --> 00:58:07,824
The book says, they plan
to release the gas...

682
00:58:08,044 --> 00:58:09,501
At the front?

683
00:58:09,714 --> 00:58:10,513
When?

684
00:58:10,608 --> 00:58:11,881
It doesn't say.

685
00:58:12,335 --> 00:58:13,839
Wait. In "front" of what?

686
00:58:13,864 --> 00:58:14,957
Sir...

687
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,613
...that is the
evidence we need.

688
00:58:16,614 --> 00:58:18,440
You have to find out where
they are making that gas.

689
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:19,817
You have to burn
it to the ground.

690
00:58:20,037 --> 00:58:21,038
Destroy it.

691
00:58:21,114 --> 00:58:23,521
Ludendorff was last
seen in Belgium.

692
00:58:23,804 --> 00:58:27,904
We can't be seen sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium...

693
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:31,362
...as we are negotiating
their surrender.

694
00:58:31,387 --> 00:58:33,266
Sir, I have seen that
gas with my own eyes.

695
00:58:33,299 --> 00:58:36,158
If it is used, it will kill
everyone on both sides.

696
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:37,029
They will all die.

697
00:58:37,276 --> 00:58:40,219
Yes, that's what
soldiers do, Captain.

698
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:42,988
Send me in... with some
logistical support.

699
00:58:43,038 --> 00:58:46,002
At least give me the chance to take
out Ludendorff's operation myself.

700
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:47,128
Are you insane?

701
00:58:47,629 --> 00:58:49,789
I can't introduce rogue
elements this late in the case.

702
00:58:49,801 --> 00:58:50,525
Sir, I can take...

703
00:58:50,765 --> 00:58:52,009
Now more than ever...

704
00:58:52,293 --> 00:58:55,953
...the armistice is
off paramount importance.

705
00:58:56,154 --> 00:58:58,654
It must be negotiated,
it must be signed...

706
00:58:58,671 --> 00:59:00,471
and this is...

707
00:59:00,587 --> 00:59:03,286
It's the best way
of stopping the war.

708
00:59:03,501 --> 00:59:05,400
Captain, you will do nothing.

709
00:59:05,663 --> 00:59:07,718
And that is an order.

710
00:59:08,607 --> 00:59:09,608
Yes sir.

711
00:59:10,961 --> 00:59:11,962
I understand, sir.

712
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,792
I don't!

713
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,561
Diana, I know this confusing...

714
00:59:15,642 --> 00:59:17,975
- It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!
- Who is this woman?

715
00:59:17,976 --> 00:59:19,092
She is with me, she is with us.

716
00:59:19,093 --> 00:59:20,253
I'm not... I am not with you!

717
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:23,336
You would knowingly
sacrifice all those lives.

718
00:59:23,337 --> 00:59:24,800
...as if they mean
less than yours.

719
00:59:24,825 --> 00:59:26,912
- Diana, let's talk about it outside.
- As if they mean nothing?

720
00:59:26,913 --> 00:59:29,947
Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards.

721
00:59:29,948 --> 00:59:32,194
That's enough! They fight
alongside their soldiers.

722
00:59:32,195 --> 00:59:34,022
They die with them
on the battlefield!

723
00:59:34,023 --> 00:59:35,747
- That's enough! My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

724
00:59:35,748 --> 00:59:37,111
- My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

725
00:59:37,121 --> 00:59:39,041
- Diana... Diana!
- All of you should be ashamed!

726
00:59:40,568 --> 00:59:42,017
Please slow down!

727
00:59:42,235 --> 00:59:43,435
That's your leader?

728
00:59:43,763 --> 00:59:45,809
How could he say that?
Believe that?

729
00:59:46,127 --> 00:59:47,465
And... and you!

730
00:59:47,695 --> 00:59:49,955
Was your duty to simply
give them a book?

731
00:59:49,969 --> 00:59:50,500
No!

732
00:59:50,508 --> 00:59:52,137
You didn't stand your ground.
You didn't fight.

733
00:59:52,138 --> 00:59:53,810
Because there was no chance
of changing anything.

734
00:59:53,811 --> 00:59:57,111
This is Ares and he's not
going to allow a negotiation

735
00:59:57,123 --> 00:59:58,548
or a surrender!

736
00:59:58,573 --> 01:00:01,275
The millions of people you
talked about, they will die.

737
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,659
We are going anyway!

738
01:00:05,006 --> 01:00:06,864
You mean you were lying?

739
01:00:07,265 --> 01:00:08,964
I'm a spy!
That's what I do!

740
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:11,182
How do I know you're not
lying to me right now?

741
01:00:16,185 --> 01:00:17,741
I'm taking you to the front.

742
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:20,136
We are probably gonna die.

743
01:00:21,215 --> 01:00:23,163
This is a terrible idea.

744
01:00:27,854 --> 01:00:29,601
We're gonna need reinforcements.

745
01:00:40,384 --> 01:00:42,374
These are the reinforcements?

746
01:00:42,399 --> 01:00:43,400
Yep.

747
01:00:43,532 --> 01:00:45,490
Are these even good men?

748
01:00:46,116 --> 01:00:47,701
Well, relatively.

749
01:00:48,849 --> 01:00:52,891
Even in Africa gentlemen, we
haven't seen such luxuries.

750
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:57,197
The luxury that we have now is like...
is like we can't stop making money!

751
01:00:57,222 --> 01:00:59,584
So my uncle, the
Prince, and I...

752
01:01:00,145 --> 01:01:01,576
Which prince is that?

753
01:01:02,202 --> 01:01:04,344
I decided to extend
your profanity...

754
01:01:04,345 --> 01:01:05,967
But seriously, which prince?

755
01:01:06,822 --> 01:01:09,436
Hey, Sultan, Angoora,
Next Kashmir...

756
01:01:09,585 --> 01:01:11,386
<i>...Care to talk for a minute?</i>

757
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:14,090
Gentlemen, excuse me one second.

758
01:01:15,188 --> 01:01:16,759
- A bar... Well, a pub.
- You hypocrite.

759
01:01:16,959 --> 01:01:20,098
I've been racing those peacocks
all night, and you've...

760
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,211
Oh my goodness, gracious.

761
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:24,034
That's a work of art.

762
01:01:24,035 --> 01:01:26,313
Sameer, Diana.
Diana, Sameer!

763
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:28,590
Hi, Diana. You can
call me Sammy please.

764
01:01:28,615 --> 01:01:29,424
"Sammy".

765
01:01:29,425 --> 01:01:31,965
Oh Sameer, I wouldn't...
do that if I were you.

766
01:01:32,008 --> 01:01:33,314
Sameer is a top undercover man.

767
01:01:33,339 --> 01:01:35,984
He can talk the skin off a cabbage
many ways as you can.

768
01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:38,993
<i>He doesn't look that impressive to me.</i>

769
01:01:39,194 --> 01:01:40,646
<i>You do for me.</i>

770
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:43,931
<i>Your eyes, as soft as your smile.</i>

771
01:01:44,157 --> 01:01:45,108
<i>And your eyes...</i>

772
01:01:45,133 --> 01:01:48,011
<i>...looks like they want something.</i>

773
01:01:48,449 --> 01:01:50,369
<i>I know Chinese too, tricky girl.</i>

774
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:52,653
<i>But, can you recite Socrates
in ancient Greek?</i>

775
01:01:55,014 --> 01:01:56,017
Oh, you're done.

776
01:01:56,042 --> 01:01:57,043
Where is Charlie?

777
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:02,171
Voila!

778
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,309
At least this Charlie
is good with his fists.

779
01:02:08,577 --> 01:02:09,710
That's not Charlie.

780
01:02:17,693 --> 01:02:18,794
That's Charlie.

781
01:02:23,232 --> 01:02:24,233
Steven!

782
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:27,222
May god grow a flower
upon your head son.

783
01:02:27,322 --> 01:02:28,366
Good to see you.

784
01:02:29,932 --> 01:02:31,835
So what were you fighting about?

785
01:02:33,078 --> 01:02:35,569
I mistook his glass for mine.
That happens.

786
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:37,304
This man is no fighter.

787
01:02:37,517 --> 01:02:39,526
Charlie is an expert marksman.

788
01:02:40,096 --> 01:02:41,408
Means he shoots people.

789
01:02:41,433 --> 01:02:42,998
From very far away.

790
01:02:43,323 --> 01:02:44,593
They never know what hit 'em.

791
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,823
So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?

792
01:02:49,024 --> 01:02:51,186
I don't. Trust me
it's better that way.

793
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:52,784
You fight without honor.

794
01:02:53,092 --> 01:02:54,941
Who gets paid for honor?

795
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:57,707
So, what's the job, boss?

796
01:02:59,205 --> 01:03:00,221
Two days tops.

797
01:03:00,222 --> 01:03:02,844
We need supplies and
passage to Belgium.

798
01:03:02,944 --> 01:03:04,176
What's the going rate?

799
01:03:04,276 --> 01:03:04,989
Better be a good pay.

800
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:07,201
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

801
01:03:09,346 --> 01:03:11,066
Ehm... I told you it was going to be quick.

802
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,011
And there's a lot to
be gained by this.

803
01:03:14,286 --> 01:03:16,210
It's for a great cause...

804
01:03:17,509 --> 01:03:18,510
...Freedom.

805
01:03:19,044 --> 01:03:20,452
Friendship...

806
01:03:23,021 --> 01:03:24,218
...ending the war, friendship...

807
01:03:24,219 --> 01:03:25,574
- Okay, You have no money.
- No.

808
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:28,852
<i>All I want now is a picture
of that beautiful face.</i>

809
01:03:30,022 --> 01:03:31,832
<i>You will not need a photo...</i>

810
01:03:32,217 --> 01:03:33,337
<i>...because I'll go with you.</i>

811
01:03:34,238 --> 01:03:35,239
What?

812
01:03:35,294 --> 01:03:36,364
What is this?

813
01:03:36,392 --> 01:03:37,725
We're gonna drop her up at front!

814
01:03:38,016 --> 01:03:39,618
- "Dropping her off"?
- Yeah.

815
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,466
Question sweetheart, I am not
gonna get myself killed...

816
01:03:42,476 --> 01:03:43,796
...with helping every last human.

817
01:03:43,822 --> 01:03:46,422
- That's no I mean.
- Here's the little thief now!

818
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,319
I am both frightened and aroused.

819
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,492
Oh here they are! Sorry I'm late.
Sir Patrick!

820
01:04:11,517 --> 01:04:13,136
Yes, that's what I
was gonna mention.

821
01:04:14,513 --> 01:04:16,172
- Sir Patrick.
- No, no, no, no...

822
01:04:16,617 --> 01:04:18,651
Gentlemen, sit.
Ms. Prince, sit.

823
01:04:23,487 --> 01:04:25,400
I assume you are here
planning something...

824
01:04:25,472 --> 01:04:28,447
...that's going to get you
either court martialed or killed.

825
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:30,688
And I assume,
you are here to stop us.

826
01:04:31,238 --> 01:04:32,239
No.

827
01:04:32,718 --> 01:04:34,530
Not at all in fact...

828
01:04:35,354 --> 01:04:36,296
Well, look.

829
01:04:36,321 --> 01:04:37,488
I was an younger man once.

830
01:04:37,489 --> 01:04:41,399
And had I been in better health,
I like to think that I might do the same.

831
01:04:42,486 --> 01:04:44,933
It's a very very honorable
thing you're doing.

832
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:45,733
Therefore...

833
01:04:46,711 --> 01:04:48,012
...I am here to help.

834
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:49,986
Unofficially, of course.

835
01:04:51,127 --> 01:04:52,354
What's your plan?

836
01:04:53,885 --> 01:04:56,990
If there's another weapon's
facility, find it and destroy it.

837
01:04:57,459 --> 01:04:59,267
Along with Ludendorff and Maru.

838
01:05:00,356 --> 01:05:02,940
In that case, to
allay suspicion...

839
01:05:03,978 --> 01:05:08,287
...our charming Etta could run
the mission from my office.

840
01:05:08,641 --> 01:05:09,642
"Run"...

841
01:05:11,786 --> 01:05:12,787
Also.

842
01:05:13,822 --> 01:05:16,280
...There is enough
here for a few days.

843
01:05:21,923 --> 01:05:22,924
Thank you sir.

844
01:05:23,077 --> 01:05:24,400
You're very welcome.

845
01:05:25,272 --> 01:05:27,026
Take great care all of you...

846
01:05:27,051 --> 01:05:28,052
...and good luck.

847
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,261
<i>Fresh ice-cream.</i>

848
01:05:51,362 --> 01:05:53,266
Hello miss, would you like
to buy an ice cream?

849
01:05:53,387 --> 01:05:54,806
- Me?
- You hungry?

850
01:05:55,058 --> 01:05:56,059
Yes.

851
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,238
Thank you.

852
01:05:57,263 --> 01:05:58,704
Eight pence please, sir.

853
01:05:59,026 --> 01:06:00,168
There you go, and keep the change.

854
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:01,711
Thank you very much sir.

855
01:06:02,862 --> 01:06:04,364
- What you doing?
- It's wonderful!

856
01:06:04,389 --> 01:06:05,541
Yeah.

857
01:06:06,516 --> 01:06:09,168
- You should be very proud.
- Thank you very much!

858
01:06:09,193 --> 01:06:10,570
You should be very proud.

859
01:06:21,049 --> 01:06:23,850
I hope I got niches here.
The chief's expecting us before dark.

860
01:06:24,996 --> 01:06:26,103
Chief?

861
01:06:27,128 --> 01:06:28,709
Oh yeah.
A smuggler.

862
01:06:29,546 --> 01:06:30,903
Very reputable.

863
01:06:31,332 --> 01:06:34,309
A liar, a murderer,
and now a smuggler.

864
01:06:34,913 --> 01:06:35,914
Lovely.

865
01:06:36,384 --> 01:06:37,585
Careful, I might get offended.

866
01:06:37,609 --> 01:06:39,111
I wasn't referring to you.

867
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:40,963
Really?

868
01:06:40,976 --> 01:06:43,225
I wanna recover from pretending
to be somebody else.

869
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:45,299
...I shot people on your
beach, smuggle a notebook.

870
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,904
A liar, murderer and smuggler.
You still coming?

871
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:08,458
It's awful.

872
01:07:09,798 --> 01:07:11,241
That's why we're here.

873
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,115
The gas will kill everything.

874
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,564
What kind of weapon
kills innocents?

875
01:07:34,492 --> 01:07:35,985
In this war...

876
01:07:36,103 --> 01:07:37,254
...every kind.

877
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,616
You were absent at the
counsel meeting, General.

878
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:48,498
I see you are negotiating the
terms of the armistice without me.

879
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:51,027
- On the Kaiser's behalf.
- I'm on your insistence.

880
01:07:51,907 --> 01:07:54,910
We could easily win this war if
only you had a little faith.

881
01:07:54,935 --> 01:07:56,166
We don't.

882
01:07:56,491 --> 01:07:58,521
There are shortages of food...

883
01:07:58,546 --> 01:08:00,391
...meds and ammunition.

884
01:08:01,398 --> 01:08:05,282
Every hour we delay costs
thousands of German lives.

885
01:08:05,407 --> 01:08:08,139
One attack and the
world could be ours.

886
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,531
As we speak, my chemistry...

887
01:08:12,556 --> 01:08:14,702
We stand against you and your...

888
01:08:14,727 --> 01:08:15,966
...witch.

889
01:08:16,702 --> 01:08:21,881
Ludendorff, enough!
24 hours from now...

890
01:08:21,906 --> 01:08:23,878
...this war will end.

891
01:08:24,426 --> 01:08:26,062
It is over.

892
01:08:27,251 --> 01:08:28,679
It's over for you.

893
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:33,892
It is over for all of you.

894
01:08:50,527 --> 01:08:52,518
But the mask won't help.

895
01:08:52,543 --> 01:08:53,786
They don't know that.

896
01:09:08,738 --> 01:09:09,998
Let's go.

897
01:09:10,023 --> 01:09:12,674
Time to stage a demonstration
for the Kaiser!

898
01:09:15,348 --> 01:09:16,048
You're late.

899
01:09:16,181 --> 01:09:17,307
Cowboy sneak attack, chief!

900
01:09:18,639 --> 01:09:19,651
How are you?

901
01:09:20,566 --> 01:09:22,562
- Good to see you pal.
- Big mike.

902
01:09:25,075 --> 01:09:26,803
- Good to see you.
- Oh yes!

903
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:29,197
Good to see you my friend.

904
01:09:29,964 --> 01:09:31,184
Yaa beauty!

905
01:09:31,609 --> 01:09:32,979
Who is this?

906
01:09:39,889 --> 01:09:41,534
And I am Diana.

907
01:09:42,925 --> 01:09:43,975
Where did you find her?

908
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:45,403
She found me.

909
01:09:45,808 --> 01:09:48,008
- I plucked him from the sea.
- Well. It's a long story.

910
01:09:48,097 --> 01:09:49,609
You don't have to talk
about that right now.

911
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:51,011
What's there?

912
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,302
British tea from the Germans...

913
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:56,518
...German beer for the British.

914
01:09:56,543 --> 01:10:00,608
And Edgar Rice Brurroughs
novels for both.

915
01:10:00,819 --> 01:10:02,120
And guns!

916
01:10:03,297 --> 01:10:06,889
Well...
May we get what we want?

917
01:10:06,914 --> 01:10:08,122
May we get what we need.

918
01:10:08,516 --> 01:10:10,516
But may we never get
what we deserve.

919
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:11,542
Bang!

920
01:10:19,166 --> 01:10:20,390
Strange thunder.

921
01:10:21,905 --> 01:10:23,412
German 77's.

922
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,183
Guns, big ones.

923
01:10:26,298 --> 01:10:27,744
It's the front out there.

924
01:10:28,948 --> 01:10:32,972
- The evening hay.
- So, who do you fight for in this war?

925
01:10:32,997 --> 01:10:34,266
I don't fight.

926
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:36,156
You're here for profits then?

927
01:10:36,641 --> 01:10:38,602
No better place to be.

928
01:10:39,591 --> 01:10:42,073
Nowhere better to be than in a
war where you don't take a side.

929
01:10:42,492 --> 01:10:44,649
I have no where else.
The last war took

930
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:47,314
everything from my people.
We have nothing left.

931
01:10:48,009 --> 01:10:49,379
At least here...

932
01:10:49,806 --> 01:10:51,165
...I'm free.

933
01:10:51,984 --> 01:10:53,749
Who took that from your people?

934
01:10:54,511 --> 01:10:55,692
His people.

935
01:11:00,649 --> 01:11:01,697
<i>Don't go...</i>

936
01:11:02,568 --> 01:11:05,347
<i>Don't go there.
Do not go!</i>

937
01:11:07,186 --> 01:11:08,704
<i>Don't go in there.</i>

938
01:11:08,729 --> 01:11:09,827
You are safe.

939
01:11:10,028 --> 01:11:12,658
You are safe.
Are you okay?

940
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:14,227
Shut up, you woman!

941
01:11:14,252 --> 01:11:16,005
Stop making a fuss!

942
01:11:16,328 --> 01:11:17,487
God!

943
01:11:21,572 --> 01:11:23,947
He sees ghosts.

944
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:29,973
Hey, you're gonna get cold.

945
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:31,220
Oh I do...

946
01:11:31,699 --> 01:11:34,149
Don't worry about Charlie.
He doesn't mean anything by it.

947
01:11:54,309 --> 01:11:56,328
These animals, why are
they hurting them?

948
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:58,471
Because they need to move quick!

949
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,916
- Like us!
- But this is not the way.

950
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:02,551
I could help them.

951
01:12:02,552 --> 01:12:03,855
There is no time.
Come on, woman!

952
01:12:07,282 --> 01:12:08,284
Mama!

953
01:12:13,046 --> 01:12:15,167
That man... he's wounded.

954
01:12:15,468 --> 01:12:17,625
There is nothing you can
do about it, Diana.

955
01:12:17,895 --> 01:12:19,207
We must keep moving.

956
01:12:40,491 --> 01:12:41,334
What is this?

957
01:12:41,548 --> 01:12:43,441
You wanted me to take you to war.
This is it.

958
01:12:43,508 --> 01:12:44,938
Then where are the Germans?

959
01:12:45,282 --> 01:12:47,446
Couple of 100 yards
across the field.

960
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:49,133
- The trench is...
- Watch out!

961
01:12:51,791 --> 01:12:53,820
Chief! Oh it's good to see you.

962
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,285
Oi, chief's back! Chief's back!

963
01:12:57,470 --> 01:12:58,753
Alright, let's move.

964
01:12:59,986 --> 01:13:01,727
<i>Help me please.</i>

965
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,892
<i>They have taken everything...</i>

966
01:13:03,893 --> 01:13:05,898
<i>...houses, food...</i>

967
01:13:06,142 --> 01:13:07,978
<i>...and those who
could not escape...</i>

968
01:13:08,195 --> 01:13:10,094
<i>...they were taken
away as slaves.</i>

969
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:11,337
<i>Where did that happen?</i>

970
01:13:11,338 --> 01:13:14,618
<i>In Veld... On the other
side of No Man's Land.</i>

971
01:13:14,619 --> 01:13:15,716
Diana, we have to go.

972
01:13:15,717 --> 01:13:17,154
We need to help these people.

973
01:13:17,179 --> 01:13:18,326
We have to stay on mission!

974
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:20,008
Next safe crossing is
at least a day away.

975
01:13:20,222 --> 01:13:22,790
- What are we waiting for?
- We can not leave without helping them.

976
01:13:22,791 --> 01:13:24,325
These people are dying.

977
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:26,201
Nothing to eat and
in the village...

978
01:13:26,211 --> 01:13:27,851
<i>- enslaved, she said!
- I understand that.</i>

979
01:13:27,857 --> 01:13:28,857
Women! Children!

980
01:13:28,861 --> 01:13:30,151
We need to make our next
position by sunset.

981
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:32,199
How can you say that? What
is the matter with you?

982
01:13:32,862 --> 01:13:34,821
This is No Man's Land! Diana!

983
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:37,345
Means no man can
cross it, alright?

984
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:39,769
This battalion has been
here for nearly a year...

985
01:13:40,094 --> 01:13:42,352
...and they barely
gained an inch.

986
01:13:42,566 --> 01:13:45,265
Alright? Because on the other side,
there are a bunch of Germans

987
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:48,092
...pointing machine guns at
every square inch of this place.

988
01:13:48,343 --> 01:13:50,591
This is not something you can cross.
This is not possible.

989
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:51,984
So what? So we do nothing?

990
01:13:52,201 --> 01:13:54,075
No, we are doing something.

991
01:13:54,076 --> 01:13:55,455
- We are, we just...
- Steve.

992
01:13:55,702 --> 01:13:57,091
We can't save
everyone in this war.

993
01:13:57,318 --> 01:13:58,550
Steve...

994
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,440
This is not what we
came here to do.

995
01:14:16,888 --> 01:14:17,889
No...

996
01:14:17,941 --> 01:14:19,841
...but it's what
I'm going to do.

997
01:14:35,114 --> 01:14:36,373
Diana!

998
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,850
What the bloody hell she's playing at?

999
01:15:06,515 --> 01:15:08,515
<i>Engage, fire!</i>

1000
01:15:17,357 --> 01:15:19,543
She's taking all the fire!
Let's go!

1001
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:25,119
Sniper! stay down!

1002
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,667
Stay down! That's an order!

1003
01:16:19,852 --> 01:16:20,853
Come on!

1004
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:22,757
She's done it!
Let's go!

1005
01:16:42,779 --> 01:16:43,780
Steve!

1006
01:16:44,211 --> 01:16:45,358
Let's go!

1007
01:16:48,105 --> 01:16:49,862
Come on, go!

1008
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:11,870
Stay here, I'll go ahead.

1009
01:17:47,408 --> 01:17:48,685
- What the...
- Let's move.

1010
01:18:27,068 --> 01:18:28,495
We need more firepower.

1011
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:45,990
Sniper!

1012
01:19:46,054 --> 01:19:47,267
Move!

1013
01:19:49,603 --> 01:19:50,368
Get in!

1014
01:19:50,668 --> 01:19:52,075
Charlie, bell tower.

1015
01:20:00,331 --> 01:20:01,601
Come on, Charlie. Shoot him.

1016
01:20:03,175 --> 01:20:04,714
It's okay.

1017
01:20:09,692 --> 01:20:11,694
Follow me.
Give me some cover.

1018
01:20:18,402 --> 01:20:19,455
Good!

1019
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:22,535
We're gonna put this on our
backs and when I say go...

1020
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,721
- ...Lift hard!
- All right.

1021
01:20:24,792 --> 01:20:26,905
Diana! Shield!

1022
01:20:30,602 --> 01:20:31,603
Go!

1023
01:21:33,799 --> 01:21:36,178
Stay very very still,
for me my friends.

1024
01:21:36,203 --> 01:21:37,841
Please. It's so important.

1025
01:21:41,811 --> 01:21:42,981
Thank you very much.

1026
01:21:43,006 --> 01:21:45,875
This has been such an honor
for me taking your photograph.

1027
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:46,965
Thank you so much.

1028
01:21:53,401 --> 01:21:55,620
For obvious talk of shooting...

1029
01:21:55,941 --> 01:21:57,712
...you cannot shoot.

1030
01:22:00,359 --> 01:22:02,777
Not everyone gets to be where
they want to be all the time.

1031
01:22:03,442 --> 01:22:05,824
Me, I'm an actor.

1032
01:22:05,973 --> 01:22:07,286
I love acting.

1033
01:22:07,552 --> 01:22:09,169
I didn't want to be a soldier.

1034
01:22:10,478 --> 01:22:11,819
But I'm the wrong color.

1035
01:22:12,832 --> 01:22:15,121
Everyone's fighting their
own battle, Diana.

1036
01:22:16,776 --> 01:22:18,081
Just as you're fighting yours.

1037
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:25,737
<i>Oh it's too much. I wish you...</i>

1038
01:22:25,738 --> 01:22:26,739
<i>Thank you.</i>

1039
01:22:30,854 --> 01:22:32,431
Hi. I'm on the phone...

1040
01:22:32,849 --> 01:22:35,921
Ah, it's "Veld", V-E-L-D.

1041
01:22:35,946 --> 01:22:37,653
It's a tiny village.

1042
01:22:37,678 --> 01:22:39,534
It may not even be on the map.

1043
01:22:39,559 --> 01:22:40,850
Ooh! I found it!

1044
01:22:41,104 --> 01:22:42,964
Did you find
Ludendorff's operation?

1045
01:22:42,989 --> 01:22:44,702
No. No, but I located him.

1046
01:22:44,868 --> 01:22:47,739
And oh, lucky you, he's
only a few miles away...

1047
01:22:47,764 --> 01:22:49,480
...at German High Command.

1048
01:22:49,937 --> 01:22:51,480
<i>The German High Command?</i>

1049
01:22:51,603 --> 01:22:52,957
And to Intel report...

1050
01:22:53,228 --> 01:22:55,449
...Ludendorff is
hosting a gala.

1051
01:22:55,665 --> 01:22:56,983
Sort of the last hurrah...

1052
01:22:57,308 --> 01:22:59,810
...before the Germans
sign the armistice.

1053
01:22:59,835 --> 01:23:02,690
And then the Kaiser himself
is going to be there.

1054
01:23:02,917 --> 01:23:05,343
As well as Dr. Maru.

1055
01:23:06,094 --> 01:23:07,741
Actually the Gala could
be perfect cover.

1056
01:23:07,766 --> 01:23:09,728
- Captain Trevor.
- Yes sir.

1057
01:23:09,753 --> 01:23:12,957
You're under no circumstances
to go anywhere near that...

1058
01:23:12,982 --> 01:23:14,518
...gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?

1059
01:23:14,569 --> 01:23:17,085
You'll be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for.

1060
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:18,928
You can not compromise
the armistice.

1061
01:23:19,393 --> 01:23:20,864
- Sir, there will be no armistice...
- Steve!

1062
01:23:20,865 --> 01:23:22,858
...once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line.

1063
01:23:23,112 --> 01:23:24,166
Hold on one second, sir.

1064
01:23:24,191 --> 01:23:26,476
We shouldn't be bothered about
setting the peace agreement.

1065
01:23:26,477 --> 01:23:28,153
- Why not?
- Ares would never let...

1066
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:29,755
What?

1067
01:23:30,281 --> 01:23:31,282
What is that?

1068
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:33,654
Of course, it makes
complete sense.

1069
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:38,330
Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised.

1070
01:23:38,355 --> 01:23:40,032
- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No.

1071
01:23:40,597 --> 01:23:41,991
I mean Ares.

1072
01:23:42,636 --> 01:23:44,794
Ludendorff is Ares!

1073
01:23:45,684 --> 01:23:47,726
Sir, this is our last chance...

1074
01:23:47,751 --> 01:23:49,501
...our final chance to find
out where the gas is...

1075
01:23:49,502 --> 01:23:51,827
...and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it.

1076
01:23:51,852 --> 01:23:53,729
No, no, no, no. I forbid it.

1077
01:23:53,754 --> 01:23:54,904
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1078
01:23:54,929 --> 01:23:56,655
Sir, I am losing you! Sir?

1079
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,110
- Hello?
- Sir...

1080
01:24:01,413 --> 01:24:03,093
How likely is he to
respect my wishes?

1081
01:24:03,115 --> 01:24:05,399
Not very likely, I'll be honest.

1082
01:24:11,027 --> 01:24:12,828
Sammy, Sammy, no, no.

1083
01:24:13,306 --> 01:24:14,420
Sammy, I have to work.

1084
01:24:14,827 --> 01:24:18,230
I gotta rustle up with a German uniform
I took to plough the course tomorrow.

1085
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:19,528
That's easy, boss.
Come on.

1086
01:24:19,777 --> 01:24:21,319
There's nothing we can
do till tomorrow.

1087
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,361
You said yourself, Steve.

1088
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,644
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1089
01:24:47,885 --> 01:24:49,076
You did this.

1090
01:24:51,337 --> 01:24:52,391
We did.

1091
01:24:57,145 --> 01:24:58,737
Do you have dancing on...

1092
01:24:59,786 --> 01:25:01,001
...Paradise Island?

1093
01:25:01,026 --> 01:25:02,747
Oh, dancing, yeah of course.

1094
01:25:03,728 --> 01:25:06,887
These people are just...
swaying.

1095
01:25:07,884 --> 01:25:11,237
Okay, if you're gonna be
fighting the God of war...

1096
01:25:11,238 --> 01:25:14,658
...I might as well teach you how
to dance, you poor thing.

1097
01:25:14,713 --> 01:25:17,276
Alright, probably
without the gun.

1098
01:25:21,403 --> 01:25:22,854
If you would...

1099
01:25:23,704 --> 01:25:24,705
Well...

1100
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:29,238
If I'm going to the Gala, I'll
need to know how to dance.

1101
01:25:29,263 --> 01:25:30,398
- You aren't going to the Gala.
- Of course I am.

1102
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:32,450
- No.
- Why wouldn't I?

1103
01:25:32,657 --> 01:25:34,560
Well, for one, you don't
know how to dance.

1104
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:37,541
I would argue with this, they
don't know how to dance.

1105
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:38,968
Be polite. Be polite.

1106
01:25:41,795 --> 01:25:44,154
All right.
Give me your hand.

1107
01:25:44,155 --> 01:25:45,428
Like so.

1108
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:49,320
And I'll put my arm...

1109
01:25:49,321 --> 01:25:51,185
...around you like so.

1110
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:53,997
And we just...

1111
01:25:54,336 --> 01:25:55,739
What do you call it? Sway?

1112
01:25:55,764 --> 01:25:56,765
We'll just sway.

1113
01:25:57,454 --> 01:25:59,023
You're awfully close.

1114
01:26:01,257 --> 01:26:03,310
Nice ritz.

1115
01:26:06,276 --> 01:26:07,517
I see.

1116
01:26:16,282 --> 01:26:18,464
I haven't heard him
sing in years.

1117
01:26:35,801 --> 01:26:37,754
It's started to snowfall.

1118
01:26:42,089 --> 01:26:43,176
Touch it.

1119
01:26:46,649 --> 01:26:48,153
It's magical!

1120
01:26:48,718 --> 01:26:50,350
It is, isn't it?

1121
01:26:52,539 --> 01:26:53,854
Yes, yeah.

1122
01:27:00,513 --> 01:27:03,919
Is this what people do when
there are no wars to fight?

1123
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:05,890
Yeah.

1124
01:27:06,928 --> 01:27:09,931
Yeah, this... and other things.

1125
01:27:10,173 --> 01:27:11,604
What things?

1126
01:27:19,114 --> 01:27:20,657
They have breakfast.

1127
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:22,867
They really love a breakfast.

1128
01:27:22,895 --> 01:27:25,730
And they love to wake up...

1129
01:27:26,701 --> 01:27:28,874
...read the paper
and go to work.

1130
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:31,571
They get married.

1131
01:27:32,367 --> 01:27:34,060
Make some babies and
grow old together.

1132
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:35,603
I guess.

1133
01:27:39,595 --> 01:27:41,146
What is that like?

1134
01:27:45,276 --> 01:27:46,710
I have no idea.

1135
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:23,146
The villagers gave them to us.

1136
01:29:23,946 --> 01:29:26,534
- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes.

1137
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:28,112
You are.

1138
01:29:28,777 --> 01:29:30,473
Hey, fellas, I know that...

1139
01:29:31,771 --> 01:29:33,662
...I said this job
was 2 day's...

1140
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:36,905
...and a deal is a deal.

1141
01:29:39,052 --> 01:29:40,510
You can't last without us.

1142
01:29:41,398 --> 01:29:42,399
Yeah.

1143
01:29:42,613 --> 01:29:44,775
We all know Diana is capable
of taking care of herself.

1144
01:29:45,336 --> 01:29:47,109
I'm worried that
you won't make it.

1145
01:29:47,814 --> 01:29:48,639
No more money.

1146
01:29:48,664 --> 01:29:50,056
We have been paid enough.

1147
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,434
No, Charlie.

1148
01:29:56,812 --> 01:29:58,769
Who will sing for us?

1149
01:29:59,766 --> 01:30:01,775
- Yeah.
- Oh no, please.

1150
01:30:02,815 --> 01:30:03,881
Sing?

1151
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:06,271
You asked for it.

1152
01:30:06,452 --> 01:30:08,796
<i>The reeds are green.</i>

1153
01:30:09,273 --> 01:30:12,897
<i>The reeds are green.</i>

1154
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:16,687
<i>The sweetest hours I could live.</i>

1155
01:30:17,702 --> 01:30:19,923
You must think I was
born yesterday.

1156
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:21,847
I know it sounds
crazy, but it's true.

1157
01:30:22,112 --> 01:30:23,203
Every word.

1158
01:30:23,693 --> 01:30:24,957
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1159
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:27,096
There is a whole island
of women like her?

1160
01:30:27,298 --> 01:30:28,901
And not a single man among them?

1161
01:30:30,372 --> 01:30:31,242
How do we get there?

1162
01:30:32,522 --> 01:30:33,443
And she thinks...

1163
01:30:33,444 --> 01:30:35,596
...that Ludendorff is
Ares, the god of war?

1164
01:30:35,627 --> 01:30:37,414
And only by killing
him will the war end.

1165
01:30:38,155 --> 01:30:40,767
Don't be daft.
You saw what happened out there.

1166
01:30:40,961 --> 01:30:42,864
The way she dropped
that machine gun next.

1167
01:30:43,185 --> 01:30:44,960
The way she took out the tower?

1168
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:48,118
May be it's true.

1169
01:30:49,256 --> 01:30:50,508
I think it's true.

1170
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:52,144
I believe it's true.

1171
01:30:53,229 --> 01:30:56,833
Steven son, you don't really
believe those rubbish thing?

1172
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:22,283
Diana, Diana,
hide in, hide in.

1173
01:31:24,649 --> 01:31:26,473
How the hell do
we get into that?

1174
01:31:27,032 --> 01:31:29,690
I see only a couple of guards
in the door to distract.

1175
01:31:29,945 --> 01:31:31,271
Yeah, it won't look
suspicious...

1176
01:31:31,472 --> 01:31:33,037
...when I wanna come
sauntering out of the woods.

1177
01:31:33,038 --> 01:31:33,829
I could get in.

1178
01:31:34,005 --> 01:31:36,015
You are not going in
there, it's too dangerous.

1179
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,522
- Too dangerous?
- Yes, too dangerous.

1180
01:31:37,536 --> 01:31:38,806
And you are too distracting.

1181
01:31:39,031 --> 01:31:41,083
Look, I will go in there, follow them to...

1182
01:31:41,084 --> 01:31:43,812
...where ever they are working on the gas or
better yet, where it is.

1183
01:31:44,027 --> 01:31:46,229
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you are not coming with me.

1184
01:31:46,286 --> 01:31:48,218
What you're wearing isn't
exactly undercover.

1185
01:31:48,744 --> 01:31:49,334
I don't know.

1186
01:31:49,335 --> 01:31:52,134
I would say she was pretty undercover
on that battlefield.

1187
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:55,666
It's just gonna, we can't get you there.
It's all scouted out, we'll put back...

1188
01:31:55,691 --> 01:31:57,493
But as long as he's still
alive, it doesn't...

1189
01:31:57,502 --> 01:31:59,889
You cannot go into German high command
and kill anyone.

1190
01:32:00,434 --> 01:32:02,243
You just can't.
You have to trust me.

1191
01:32:03,610 --> 01:32:05,167
- Oh, Wow!
- Where did that come from?

1192
01:32:05,292 --> 01:32:07,517
Oh, can I drive it?
Please let me drive it!

1193
01:32:07,592 --> 01:32:08,713
Yes, I'll be your chauffeur.

1194
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:10,059
Come on... come on.

1195
01:32:10,537 --> 01:32:11,538
Stay put!

1196
01:32:13,484 --> 01:32:14,359
Where this come from?

1197
01:32:14,559 --> 01:32:16,079
A field over there.
It is full of them!

1198
01:32:20,555 --> 01:32:21,975
Chief, I think you and
me scope out the area...

1199
01:32:21,976 --> 01:32:23,845
...in case we need to
beat the haste and retreat.

1200
01:32:23,846 --> 01:32:25,421
- What do you say, Diana?
- Huh?

1201
01:32:30,746 --> 01:32:31,747
Colonel.

1202
01:32:35,934 --> 01:32:38,449
Steve, they have invitations.

1203
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,278
Don't worry. Play it cool,
you go this, you got this.

1204
01:32:46,381 --> 01:32:48,003
Your invitation, please.

1205
01:32:48,028 --> 01:32:50,214
<i>Thank you sir.
The Colonel and I wish...</i>

1206
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,586
...many blessings and all my
love to fall up in your head.

1207
01:32:52,837 --> 01:32:56,345
Your head must be empty.
Find the invitation, you idiot.

1208
01:32:56,645 --> 01:32:57,345
I am sorry.

1209
01:32:57,384 --> 01:32:59,986
I am so sorry, I must apologize
a thousand times, my master.

1210
01:33:01,002 --> 01:33:03,969
I made the most horrible,
the most unforgivable mistake.

1211
01:33:04,261 --> 01:33:06,287
- I lost the Colonel's invitation.
- What?

1212
01:33:06,588 --> 01:33:09,200
You saying we travelled all the way
through the mud and rain...

1213
01:33:09,493 --> 01:33:12,689
- ...Only for you to loose my invitation?
- No, I am a bug.

1214
01:33:12,714 --> 01:33:14,860
Not even a bug, I'm
a dung of a bug.

1215
01:33:14,885 --> 01:33:16,105
And you're right master...

1216
01:33:16,545 --> 01:33:17,902
Blessing will up on us.

1217
01:33:28,444 --> 01:33:29,802
This is ridiculous.

1218
01:33:30,036 --> 01:33:32,052
I'm not gonna be spending
my evening out here.

1219
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:34,557
You stupid idiots!
Move your car!

1220
01:33:55,757 --> 01:33:57,644
What are you supposed to be?

1221
01:34:00,941 --> 01:34:02,815
What are you doing?

1222
01:34:27,504 --> 01:34:28,524
Excuse me.

1223
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:32,766
I don't drink.

1224
01:34:40,893 --> 01:34:41,918
Have we met?

1225
01:34:41,943 --> 01:34:43,703
No, but I have
been watching you.

1226
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:46,445
Following your career.

1227
01:34:47,542 --> 01:34:50,057
You are Dr. Isabel Maru.

1228
01:34:50,082 --> 01:34:52,624
The most talented chemist
in the German army.

1229
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:54,560
I am a friend.

1230
01:35:05,634 --> 01:35:07,712
I hope I'm not causing any...

1231
01:35:09,447 --> 01:35:11,711
I know you and General
Ludendorff are...

1232
01:35:11,737 --> 01:35:12,702
...very close.

1233
01:35:12,727 --> 01:35:16,247
We work well together...
Yes.

1234
01:35:16,825 --> 01:35:19,813
Tell me some one like
me behind you...

1235
01:35:20,569 --> 01:35:22,470
I could provide a lot more.

1236
01:35:22,495 --> 01:35:24,263
And who are you?

1237
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:28,553
A man who shows you appreciation
a genius like yourself deserves.

1238
01:35:35,243 --> 01:35:37,814
I love fire. Don't you?

1239
01:35:40,206 --> 01:35:41,852
It is like...

1240
01:35:43,506 --> 01:35:45,608
...a living act of entropy.

1241
01:35:45,633 --> 01:35:48,247
The ultimate weapon
of destruction.

1242
01:35:48,932 --> 01:35:51,158
Reminding us that in the end...

1243
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:54,996
...everything eventually
returns to the ash it came from.

1244
01:35:57,502 --> 01:36:00,766
There is something reassuring about it.

1245
01:36:05,367 --> 01:36:07,480
I see all of that in your eyes.

1246
01:36:10,956 --> 01:36:13,168
Perhaps you could show me
what you're working on.

1247
01:36:29,202 --> 01:36:30,820
I hear it is...

1248
01:36:33,098 --> 01:36:35,103
I hear it is extraordinary.

1249
01:36:36,068 --> 01:36:39,692
I appreciate your
interest in my work...

1250
01:36:39,717 --> 01:36:42,073
...but I'm loyal to
General Ludendorff.

1251
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:43,881
Besides...

1252
01:36:43,906 --> 01:36:46,545
...Now I see your
attention is...

1253
01:36:50,022 --> 01:36:51,023
...elsewhere.

1254
01:37:15,137 --> 01:37:17,058
Enjoying the party?

1255
01:37:19,081 --> 01:37:21,885
I confess I'm not sure what
it is we're celebrating.

1256
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:24,806
A German victory, of course.

1257
01:37:25,107 --> 01:37:25,814
Victory?

1258
01:37:25,835 --> 01:37:28,536
When I hear peace
could be so close.

1259
01:37:28,731 --> 01:37:29,840
Peace...

1260
01:37:29,858 --> 01:37:31,727
is only an armistice...

1261
01:37:32,001 --> 01:37:33,534
...in an endless war.

1262
01:37:34,202 --> 01:37:35,657
Thucydides.

1263
01:37:36,064 --> 01:37:37,703
You know your ancient Greeks?

1264
01:37:37,967 --> 01:37:39,711
They understood...

1265
01:37:39,732 --> 01:37:41,175
...that war was a god.

1266
01:37:41,716 --> 01:37:44,395
A god that requires human sacrifices.

1267
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:45,660
And in exchange...

1268
01:37:45,685 --> 01:37:48,425
...war gives man purpose...

1269
01:37:48,450 --> 01:37:50,397
...meaning, a
chance to rise...

1270
01:37:50,422 --> 01:37:52,800
...above his petty,
mortal little self...

1271
01:37:53,535 --> 01:37:54,850
...and be courageous...

1272
01:37:55,673 --> 01:37:57,064
...Noble!

1273
01:37:58,300 --> 01:38:01,515
Only one of the many
gods believed in that.

1274
01:38:02,512 --> 01:38:04,098
And he was wrong.

1275
01:38:05,395 --> 01:38:06,780
You know nothing of the gods.

1276
01:38:06,805 --> 01:38:08,312
<i>Herr General.</i>

1277
01:38:11,442 --> 01:38:12,995
Enjoy the fireworks.

1278
01:38:18,608 --> 01:38:19,669
What are you doing?

1279
01:38:19,694 --> 01:38:21,135
- Out of my way!
- Diana, look at me.

1280
01:38:21,265 --> 01:38:23,102
If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas...

1281
01:38:23,103 --> 01:38:24,514
...we won't be able to stop anything.

1282
01:38:24,515 --> 01:38:25,694
I will stop Ares!

1283
01:38:25,719 --> 01:38:27,252
What if you're wrong?

1284
01:38:28,822 --> 01:38:30,424
What if there's no Ares?

1285
01:38:32,187 --> 01:38:33,638
You don't believe me.

1286
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:35,475
I can not let you do this.

1287
01:38:36,137 --> 01:38:37,595
What I do is not up to you.

1288
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,553
Diana!

1289
01:38:49,828 --> 01:38:50,829
Diana...

1290
01:38:51,330 --> 01:38:52,331
The gas.

1291
01:38:53,338 --> 01:38:55,346
The villagers!

1292
01:38:57,516 --> 01:38:59,148
What they cheering for?

1293
01:39:01,696 --> 01:39:02,775
Diana!

1294
01:39:05,166 --> 01:39:06,774
What did they fire?

1295
01:39:07,087 --> 01:39:08,088
The gas.

1296
01:39:08,119 --> 01:39:10,159
- It was Ludendorff.
- I saw him, he was in the tower.

1297
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,628
Wherever he goes you follow.

1298
01:39:12,427 --> 01:39:13,862
How will you find us?

1299
01:39:14,347 --> 01:39:15,782
I know how.

1300
01:40:33,589 --> 01:40:34,937
Diana!

1301
01:40:37,931 --> 01:40:40,593
They are dead.
They are all dead.

1302
01:40:41,509 --> 01:40:43,160
I could have saved them.

1303
01:40:43,490 --> 01:40:45,833
I could have saved them
if it weren't for you.

1304
01:40:46,075 --> 01:40:48,051
You stopped me
from killing Ares!

1305
01:40:48,252 --> 01:40:50,640
- No!
- Get away from me!

1306
01:40:50,835 --> 01:40:52,332
I understand everything now.

1307
01:40:52,357 --> 01:40:54,143
It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted.

1308
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,461
It's you too.

1309
01:40:56,147 --> 01:40:57,174
All of you.

1310
01:40:58,369 --> 01:40:59,675
I'll find Ares...

1311
01:40:59,896 --> 01:41:01,460
...and I'll kill him.

1312
01:41:04,781 --> 01:41:05,916
Diana!

1313
01:41:06,958 --> 01:41:08,066
That smoke...

1314
01:41:09,203 --> 01:41:10,205
...it's the chief!

1315
01:41:10,226 --> 01:41:11,673
He followed Ludendorff.

1316
01:41:13,164 --> 01:41:14,747
Follow the smoke!

1317
01:41:41,062 --> 01:41:42,761
Hey! Diana, Over there!

1318
01:41:59,177 --> 01:42:00,377
Come on. Let's go!

1319
01:42:22,457 --> 01:42:24,067
Ooh, what a surprise.

1320
01:42:24,693 --> 01:42:25,985
Strange.

1321
01:42:27,364 --> 01:42:29,469
Unfortunately, I have
another matter...

1322
01:42:30,527 --> 01:42:31,528
...to attend to.

1323
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:39,195
What are you?

1324
01:42:39,196 --> 01:42:40,435
You will soon find out.

1325
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:18,756
As magnificent as you are, you
are still no match for me.

1326
01:43:22,607 --> 01:43:24,590
We'll see about that.

1327
01:43:48,944 --> 01:43:50,927
I am Diana of Themyscira...

1328
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:54,689
...daughter of Hippolyta...

1329
01:43:55,708 --> 01:43:58,094
...Queen of the Amazons.

1330
01:44:00,816 --> 01:44:03,564
And your wrath upon
this world is over.

1331
01:44:21,049 --> 01:44:23,548
In the name of all that it
is good in this world...

1332
01:44:23,799 --> 01:44:26,400
...I hereby complete the
mission of the Amazons...

1333
01:44:26,686 --> 01:44:28,488
...by ridding this
world of you...

1334
01:44:28,743 --> 01:44:29,744
...forever!

1335
01:45:37,309 --> 01:45:38,310
Diana?

1336
01:45:44,047 --> 01:45:45,048
Diana!

1337
01:45:49,324 --> 01:45:50,863
I killed him.

1338
01:45:52,492 --> 01:45:54,682
I killed him, but nothing stopped.

1339
01:45:56,129 --> 01:45:58,802
You kill the god of
war, you stop the war.

1340
01:45:59,078 --> 01:46:01,068
Exactly what we have to do now.

1341
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:02,650
We need to stop the gas.
Come on.

1342
01:46:02,864 --> 01:46:04,325
No. All this should
have stopped.

1343
01:46:04,393 --> 01:46:05,293
Diana...

1344
01:46:05,295 --> 01:46:07,404
The fighting should have stopped.
Why are they doing this?

1345
01:46:07,414 --> 01:46:09,489
I don't know! I don't know.

1346
01:46:09,710 --> 01:46:10,570
Ares is dead.

1347
01:46:10,811 --> 01:46:13,803
They can stop fighting now.
Why are they still fighting?

1348
01:46:14,011 --> 01:46:15,704
Because maybe it's them!

1349
01:46:16,124 --> 01:46:17,125
Maybe...

1350
01:46:18,961 --> 01:46:21,516
Maybe people aren't always good.

1351
01:46:22,589 --> 01:46:24,437
Ares or no Ares...

1352
01:46:25,738 --> 01:46:29,053
...Maybe it's just,
who they are.

1353
01:46:31,989 --> 01:46:33,280
- Diana...
- No.

1354
01:46:33,611 --> 01:46:35,063
Diana, we can talk
about this later.

1355
01:46:35,268 --> 01:46:36,607
- I need you to come with me.
- No, no!

1356
01:46:36,608 --> 01:46:38,373
After everything I
saw, it can't be!

1357
01:46:38,597 --> 01:46:39,804
Can not be!

1358
01:46:40,254 --> 01:46:42,335
They were killing each other.

1359
01:46:42,587 --> 01:46:45,118
Killing people they cannot see.
Children...

1360
01:46:45,398 --> 01:46:46,984
Children!

1361
01:46:47,219 --> 01:46:49,565
No, it had to be him.
It can not be them!

1362
01:46:49,813 --> 01:46:52,140
Diana, people... I...

1363
01:46:52,398 --> 01:46:53,942
She was right.

1364
01:46:54,468 --> 01:46:55,477
My mother was right.

1365
01:46:55,478 --> 01:46:57,523
She said the world of
men do not deserve you.

1366
01:46:57,725 --> 01:46:59,419
They don't deserve
our help, Steve.

1367
01:46:59,665 --> 01:47:02,222
- It's not about deserve!
- They do not deserve our help.

1368
01:47:02,247 --> 01:47:04,117
Maybe we don't!

1369
01:47:05,778 --> 01:47:07,946
But it's not about that.
It's about what you believe.

1370
01:47:08,943 --> 01:47:11,757
You don't think I get it, after
what I've seen out there?

1371
01:47:13,242 --> 01:47:16,724
You don't think I wish I could tell
you that it was one bad guy to blame?

1372
01:47:17,355 --> 01:47:19,029
It's not!

1373
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,880
We are all to blame.

1374
01:47:23,154 --> 01:47:24,154
I am not.

1375
01:47:25,763 --> 01:47:27,365
But maybe I am!

1376
01:47:31,242 --> 01:47:32,243
Please.

1377
01:47:32,604 --> 01:47:34,463
If you believe that this
war should stop...

1378
01:47:34,464 --> 01:47:36,280
...if you want to stop it...

1379
01:47:36,612 --> 01:47:38,053
...help me stop it right now.

1380
01:47:38,061 --> 01:47:39,361
Because, if...

1381
01:47:40,761 --> 01:47:46,066
If you don't, there will be thousands
more. Please, please come with me.

1382
01:47:46,091 --> 01:47:47,574
I have to go.

1383
01:47:54,094 --> 01:47:55,707
I have to go.

1384
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:08,566
Hey!

1385
01:48:13,099 --> 01:48:14,547
- Where is Diana?
- We are on our own.

1386
01:48:14,557 --> 01:48:17,369
- What?
- What did you see, Charlie?

1387
01:48:17,809 --> 01:48:19,396
Seems like a bunch
of gas pumps...

1388
01:48:19,658 --> 01:48:21,991
...but I can't see where
they're taking them.

1389
01:48:22,028 --> 01:48:23,628
How are we gonna get in there?

1390
01:48:24,359 --> 01:48:26,462
I have got an idea.
Come on guys.

1391
01:48:26,691 --> 01:48:27,692
Come on!

1392
01:48:41,293 --> 01:48:43,038
Who's there?

1393
01:48:55,510 --> 01:48:57,420
Sir Patrick.

1394
01:48:58,129 --> 01:49:02,460
You were right, Diana.
They don't deserve our help.

1395
01:49:03,623 --> 01:49:07,488
They only deserve destruction.

1396
01:49:08,851 --> 01:49:10,319
You...

1397
01:49:11,993 --> 01:49:13,952
You are him.

1398
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:18,824
I am.

1399
01:49:19,211 --> 01:49:23,836
But I'm not what
you thought I was.

1400
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,045
What is that?

1401
01:49:47,338 --> 01:49:48,655
Future.

1402
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:55,376
I'm not your enemy, Diana.

1403
01:49:57,406 --> 01:50:01,145
I'm the only one who
truly knows you.

1404
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:05,900
And who truly knows
them, as you now do.

1405
01:50:08,219 --> 01:50:11,889
They have always been
and always will be...

1406
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:16,030
...weak, cruel, selfish...

1407
01:50:16,131 --> 01:50:19,404
...and capable of the
greatest horrors.

1408
01:50:28,690 --> 01:50:30,140
All I ever wanted was...

1409
01:50:30,141 --> 01:50:35,200
...for the Gods to see how
evil my father's creation was.

1410
01:50:37,177 --> 01:50:38,322
But they refused.

1411
01:50:38,648 --> 01:50:39,889
I am Diana of Themyscira...

1412
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:41,548
So I destroyed them.

1413
01:50:41,582 --> 01:50:43,581
...daughter of Hippolyta...

1414
01:50:43,619 --> 01:50:45,651
...and I am here
to complete her...

1415
01:50:53,623 --> 01:50:55,253
The God Killer...

1416
01:50:57,953 --> 01:50:59,975
My dear child...

1417
01:51:01,302 --> 01:51:03,824
...that is not the God Killer.

1418
01:51:06,318 --> 01:51:07,819
You are.

1419
01:51:10,408 --> 01:51:13,546
Only a God can kill another God.

1420
01:51:14,590 --> 01:51:18,486
Zeus left the child he had
with the Queen of the Amazon...

1421
01:51:18,713 --> 01:51:20,986
...as a weapon to
use against me.

1422
01:51:21,011 --> 01:51:22,884
No. You liar.

1423
01:51:24,668 --> 01:51:26,981
I compel you to
tell me the truth.

1424
01:51:29,284 --> 01:51:30,771
I am.

1425
01:51:57,174 --> 01:51:59,520
I'm not the god of war, Diana.

1426
01:51:59,728 --> 01:52:02,196
I am the God of truth.

1427
01:52:03,729 --> 01:52:05,052
Mankind...

1428
01:52:05,686 --> 01:52:08,703
...Stole this world from us.

1429
01:52:10,711 --> 01:52:14,206
They ruined it, day by day.

1430
01:52:14,207 --> 01:52:18,483
And I, the only one wise
enough to see it...

1431
01:52:19,939 --> 01:52:22,705
...was left too weak to stop them.

1432
01:52:23,632 --> 01:52:27,258
All these years I have
struggled alone...

1433
01:52:27,259 --> 01:52:29,411
...whispering into their ears.

1434
01:52:29,412 --> 01:52:34,231
Ideas, inspiration
for formulas...

1435
01:52:35,145 --> 01:52:36,741
...weapons...

1436
01:52:39,403 --> 01:52:41,940
...but I don't
make them use them.

1437
01:52:42,998 --> 01:52:44,947
They start these
wars on their own.

1438
01:52:45,943 --> 01:52:49,761
All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep...

1439
01:52:50,035 --> 01:52:52,280
...in the hope they
will destroy themselves.

1440
01:52:54,338 --> 01:52:56,434
But it has never been enough.

1441
01:52:57,872 --> 01:52:58,971
Until you.

1442
01:53:01,621 --> 01:53:05,875
When you first arrived I
was going to crush you.

1443
01:53:06,453 --> 01:53:09,585
But I knew that if
only you could see...

1444
01:53:09,790 --> 01:53:13,661
...what the other
gods could not...

1445
01:53:15,035 --> 01:53:19,548
...then you would join me, and
with our powers combined...

1446
01:53:19,821 --> 01:53:23,753
...we could finally end all the
pain, all the suffering...

1447
01:53:23,974 --> 01:53:26,539
...destruction they bring.

1448
01:53:26,992 --> 01:53:32,125
And we could return this world to
the paradise it was before them.

1449
01:53:33,729 --> 01:53:35,459
Forever.

1450
01:53:38,350 --> 01:53:39,833
I...

1451
01:53:44,628 --> 01:53:47,362
I can never be a part of that.

1452
01:53:50,484 --> 01:53:53,260
My dear, I don't
want to fight you.

1453
01:53:54,367 --> 01:53:55,640
But if I must...

1454
01:54:05,233 --> 01:54:07,088
- Steve!
- Come on, let's go!

1455
01:54:07,597 --> 01:54:08,861
Sammy, let's go!

1456
01:54:09,301 --> 01:54:10,788
Get these things out of here.

1457
01:54:40,722 --> 01:54:45,166
Oh my dear, you have
so much to learn.

1458
01:55:10,195 --> 01:55:12,680
Oh my God!

1459
01:55:13,153 --> 01:55:14,581
What are we gonna do?

1460
01:55:16,339 --> 01:55:18,432
There is not much we can do...

1461
01:55:18,579 --> 01:55:20,208
...if that's who I think it is.

1462
01:55:25,493 --> 01:55:27,432
But we can stop that plane.

1463
01:55:40,637 --> 01:55:42,533
If we could get on the radio...

1464
01:55:42,534 --> 01:55:45,119
...we can ask flying
corp to shoot her down.

1465
01:55:45,144 --> 01:55:48,420
No. If it crashes, it will wipe
everyone out for 50 square miles.

1466
01:55:48,445 --> 01:55:49,364
We gotta ground it!

1467
01:55:49,589 --> 01:55:51,180
Bad news. It's on a timer.

1468
01:55:51,482 --> 01:55:53,640
If we ground it here,
it's the same thing.

1469
01:56:00,674 --> 01:56:02,617
Is it flammable, Chief?

1470
01:56:02,642 --> 01:56:06,119
Yes, you said it's hydrogen.
It's flammable.

1471
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:15,690
I need you guys to clear
me a path to that plane.

1472
01:56:15,715 --> 01:56:17,867
- No, Steve!
- Hey, Steve!

1473
01:56:19,889 --> 01:56:20,890
Come on!

1474
01:57:03,502 --> 01:57:05,926
Come on! This way! Steve!

1475
01:57:15,492 --> 01:57:17,339
- Come on, Steve.
- Ahead! Go!

1476
01:57:17,753 --> 01:57:19,227
Steve!

1477
01:58:02,143 --> 01:58:05,269
Let's see what kind of
god you really are.

1478
01:58:31,728 --> 01:58:35,072
You will help me
destroy them, Diana.

1479
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:40,136
Or you will die.

1480
01:58:50,199 --> 01:58:52,551
Come on! Let's move, let's go!
Go. Go. Go.

1481
01:58:55,733 --> 01:58:57,731
- Now!
- Go! Run!

1482
01:59:22,790 --> 01:59:25,535
Is that all you have to offer?

1483
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:45,751
It is futile to
imagine you can win.

1484
01:59:46,588 --> 01:59:48,297
Give up, Diana.

1485
01:59:52,325 --> 01:59:53,987
Chief! Anything left?

1486
01:59:54,012 --> 01:59:54,947
I got nothing.

1487
01:59:54,972 --> 01:59:56,278
- Anything!
- No!

1488
02:00:14,117 --> 02:00:15,118
Steve.

1489
02:01:01,591 --> 02:01:03,043
Steve.

1490
02:01:06,092 --> 02:01:09,941
No!

1491
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:45,762
Yes, Diana!

1492
02:01:46,164 --> 02:01:48,730
Take them all!

1493
02:01:49,075 --> 02:01:52,161
Finally you see.

1494
02:01:52,585 --> 02:01:55,159
Look at this world.

1495
02:01:55,458 --> 02:01:58,274
Mankind did this, not me.

1496
02:02:00,059 --> 02:02:02,132
They are ugly...

1497
02:02:02,157 --> 02:02:03,971
...filled with hatred...

1498
02:02:04,272 --> 02:02:05,355
...weak.

1499
02:02:05,756 --> 02:02:08,556
Just like your
Captain Trevor.

1500
02:02:09,048 --> 02:02:14,762
Gone and left you nothing.
And for what?

1501
02:02:15,149 --> 02:02:16,734
Pathetic!

1502
02:02:18,108 --> 02:02:19,851
He deserved to burn!

1503
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:34,996
Look at her and
tell me I'm wrong.

1504
02:02:43,403 --> 02:02:47,402
She is the perfect example
of these humans...

1505
02:02:49,158 --> 02:02:53,064
...and unworthy of your
sympathy in every way.

1506
02:02:54,568 --> 02:02:56,715
Destroy her, Diana.

1507
02:02:57,798 --> 02:03:01,198
You know that she deserves it.
They all do.

1508
02:03:04,379 --> 02:03:05,739
Do it!

1509
02:03:10,548 --> 02:03:12,250
Diana!

1510
02:03:15,459 --> 02:03:16,893
Diana...

1511
02:03:26,422 --> 02:03:27,423
What?

1512
02:03:27,923 --> 02:03:29,527
We have to go.

1513
02:03:32,273 --> 02:03:33,766
What are you saying?

1514
02:03:34,332 --> 02:03:35,378
Steve...

1515
02:03:36,210 --> 02:03:38,342
Whatever it is, I can do it.

1516
02:03:38,668 --> 02:03:39,516
No.. No..

1517
02:03:39,643 --> 02:03:41,032
- Let me do it.
- No.

1518
02:03:41,257 --> 02:03:42,909
It has to be me.

1519
02:03:42,934 --> 02:03:44,588
It has to be me.

1520
02:03:44,908 --> 02:03:48,156
I could save today.
You can save the world.

1521
02:03:56,973 --> 02:03:59,413
I wish we had more time.

1522
02:03:59,658 --> 02:04:02,437
What?
What are you saying?

1523
02:04:05,345 --> 02:04:06,346
I love you!

1524
02:04:18,288 --> 02:04:19,770
You are wrong about them.

1525
02:04:29,542 --> 02:04:31,205
They are everything you say...

1526
02:04:32,073 --> 02:04:33,662
...but so much more.

1527
02:04:33,932 --> 02:04:35,229
Lies!

1528
02:05:01,474 --> 02:05:05,104
They do not deserve
your protection!

1529
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:07,967
It's not about deserving.

1530
02:05:12,842 --> 02:05:14,746
It's about what you believe.

1531
02:05:18,381 --> 02:05:19,761
And I believe in love.

1532
02:05:19,795 --> 02:05:25,042
Then I will destroy you!

1533
02:05:52,259 --> 02:05:53,988
<i>Goodbye brother.</i>

1534
02:09:26,149 --> 02:09:28,542
<i>I used to want to
save the world.</i>

1535
02:09:29,631 --> 02:09:33,372
<i>To end war and bring
peace to mankind.</i>

1536
02:09:34,126 --> 02:09:38,000
<i>But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their mind</i>

1537
02:09:38,849 --> 02:09:41,114
<i>...and learned that inside
every one of them...</i>

1538
02:09:41,829 --> 02:09:44,115
<i>...there will always be both.</i>

1539
02:09:44,821 --> 02:09:47,677
<i>A choice each must
make for themselves.</i>

1540
02:09:47,944 --> 02:09:51,373
<i>Something no hero
will ever defeat.</i>

1541
02:09:52,719 --> 02:09:53,963
<i>And now I know...</i>

1542
02:09:55,135 --> 02:09:59,678
<i>...that only love can
truly save the world.</i>

1543
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:03,103
<i>So I stay...</i>

1544
02:10:03,370 --> 02:10:05,524
<i>...I fight and I give...</i>

1545
02:10:08,511 --> 02:10:10,487
<i>...for the world I know can be.</i>

1546
02:10:15,063 --> 02:10:16,731
<i>This is my mission now.</i>

1547
02:10:19,602 --> 02:10:20,945
<i>Forever.</i>
