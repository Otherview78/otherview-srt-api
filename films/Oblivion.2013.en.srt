1
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,961
<i>Earth, before the war.</i>

2
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:48,716
<i>New York, before I was born.</i>

3
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:53,846
<i>A place I've only
seen pictures of.</i>

4
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:55,598
<i>I know you...</i>

5
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,725
<i>But we've never met.</i>

6
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:00,770
<i>I'm with you...</i>

7
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,315
<i>But I don't know your name.</i>

8
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:10,780
<i>I know I'm dreaming. But
it feels like more than that.</i>

9
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,742
<i>It feels like a memory.</i>

10
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,080
<i>How can that be?</i>

11
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:32,176
<i>March 14th, 2077.</i>

12
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:35,388
<i>Five years since
the mandatory memory wipe.</i>

13
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,516
<i>And I'm still haunted
by these dreams.</i>

14
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,980
<i>Victoria and I were
assigned together.</i>

15
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:48,484
<i>In two weeks, our mission here will
be finished, and we'll join the others.</i>

16
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:52,154
<i>But the questions I ask,
she doesn't.</i>

17
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,324
<i>The things I wonder about,
she won't.</i>

18
00:01:56,617 --> 00:02:00,371
<i>It's been half a century since the
scavengers destroyed our moon.</i>

19
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:05,001
<i>Forced to leave their own dying
planet, they came to take ours.</i>

20
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,337
<i>Without the moon, the
Earth was thrown into chaos.</i>

21
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,840
<i>Earthquakes toppled
cities within hours.</i>

22
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:14,302
<i>Tsunamis wiped
out what remained.</i>

23
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,512
<i>Then came the invasion.</i>

24
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,682
<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

25
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,268
<i>We used the nukes.</i>

26
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:27,440
<i>We won the war,
but lost the planet.</i>

27
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:31,652
<i>Left it contaminated.
Most of it uninhabitable.</i>

28
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,657
<i>What remained of humanity
had to leave the Earth.</i>

29
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:40,828
<i>We built the Tet,
our mission control.</i>

30
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:44,373
<i>A temporary space station
before the migration to Titan,</i>

31
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,542
<i>Saturn's largest moon.</i>

32
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,294
<i>Everyone's there now.</i>

33
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,922
<i>Well, almost everyone.</i>

34
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:56,635
<i>Until our tour is complete,
Vika and I do our job.</i>

35
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,387
<i>We protect the hydro rigs,</i>

36
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,473
<i>which convert
Earth's sea water</i>

37
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:02,558
<i>into fusion energy
for the new colony.</i>

38
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:05,144
<i>The survival of humanity
depends on it.</i>

39
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:11,734
Thank you
for the coffee.

40
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:15,946
<i>Remnants of the scavenger army
continue to disrupt the operation.</i>

41
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,532
<i>They attack our drones
at night,</i>

42
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,910
<i>and try to kill me
during the day.</i>

43
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:24,246
<i>There's still fight in them,
but I don't know why.</i>

44
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,167
<i>Mission says
we have done well.</i>

45
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:32,004
<i>That we are an effective team.</i>

46
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:44,183
<i>Vika's my
communications officer.</i>

47
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,352
<i>She keeps an eye on me.</i>

48
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,188
<i>I handle drone maintenance.</i>

49
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,274
<i>The drones watch everything.</i>

50
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:57,113
<i>Vika can't wait to go.
Me, I'm not so sure.</i>

51
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:01,117
<i>I can't shake
the feeling that Earth,</i>

52
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,411
<i>in spite of all
that's happened...</i>

53
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,163
<i>Earth is still my home.</i>

54
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,858
Jack Harper, Tech-49.

55
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:03,012
Morning, Bob.

56
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:11,854
<i>Tower, comm check.</i>

57
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,857
<i>Drone Maintenance
Technician 49, hydro rig support.</i>

58
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,902
All Bubbleship systems
are green.

59
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,111
I'm good to go.

60
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,572
Copy, Tech-49, you're cleared.
Be careful out there.

61
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,699
Always am.
No, you're not.

62
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:27,828
Yeah, you're right.
I gotta work on that.

63
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,380
All right, Tet's coming
online in 30 seconds.

64
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,717
Relaying hydro rig
coordinates now. Confirm visual.

65
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:49,683
I got 'em. Hydro rigs
are sucking seawater.

66
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,228
You got 'em, Bob?

67
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,899
Drone 185 looks good.

68
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,699
Jack,
we've got two drones down.

69
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:08,244
Shit.

70
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,995
Stand by,
Mission coming online.

71
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,083
<i>And we have Tet contact.</i>

72
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,087
Morning, boss.

73
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,423
<i>Tower 49,
this is Mission Control.</i>

74
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,676
<i>How y'all doing
this lovely morning?</i>

75
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:28,013
Another day in paradise,
Sally. Uploading data now.

76
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,725
49 mission log.
Day 1642, hydro rig support.

77
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,769
I have two...
<i>You have two drones offline.</i>

78
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,771
<i>Perimeter's compromised.</i>

79
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,732
Copy that, relaying to Tech.
Stand by.

80
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:43,612
Jack, 166 is down in Grid 37.

81
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,573
Linking to beacon now.

82
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,950
<i>You'll go there first.</i>

83
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:50,744
Got it. On my way.

84
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,332
<i>Mission, Tech-49 is
en route to Grid 37 now.</i>

85
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,501
<i>Can you plug that hole
with Drone 109?</i>

86
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:01,130
Negative, 109 is in the dock.
Still waiting for parts.

87
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,591
<i>Jack better find those drones
and get 'em flying.</i>

88
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,968
<i>Those rigs can't be
exposed overnight.</i>

89
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:08,137
Copy that.

90
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,078
<i>Tower,
didn't he fix 166 recently?</i>

91
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,039
Jack has fixed all
the drones recently.

92
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,874
And, if we had the parts
that we've been asking for,

93
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,500
we wouldn't be running
a skeleton crew down here.

94
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,337
<i>Understood.
We're doing the best we can.</i>

95
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,671
<i>Are you an effective team?</i>

96
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,715
We are an effective team.

97
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:52,264
<i>Your directive today
is to rehabilitate 166</i>

98
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,183
<i>and find 172.</i>

99
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,517
<i>Get 'em flying by sundown,</i>

100
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,562
<i>and I'll buy you two a round of
drinks when you get up to the Tet.</i>

101
00:07:58,729 --> 00:07:59,980
You had better
be ready, Sally.

102
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,607
Two weeks now,
we're keeping track.

103
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,693
Okay.

104
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,781
Come on, Bob. Work
with me, here, buddy.

105
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:17,915
Tech-49?

106
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,542
<i>Tech-49?</i>

107
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,047
<i>Jack?</i>

108
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,548
Copy, Tower.

109
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,550
What happened?
I lost you for a second.

110
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,135
Really?

111
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,222
<i>Coming up on location.</i>

112
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:46,985
There it is.

113
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,738
I've got
multiple scav kills.

114
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,074
Drone 166 put up
a hell of a fight.

115
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,326
Got any movement?

116
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,995
No sign
of scavenger activity.

117
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:00,416
But I've got limited visibility, here,
Jack, due to low angle of Mission.

118
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,252
Copy that.
I'm coming in hot.

119
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,323
Starting repairs.
Watch my back.

120
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,660
I always do.

121
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,310
You know,
I read about this game.

122
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,023
It was played right here.

123
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,484
The last Super Bowl.

124
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,110
Please don't tell me
it was a classic.

125
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:11,779
A classic game.

126
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,157
Down by four.

127
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,827
<i>The ball</i>

128
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,497
<i>was on the 50-yard line.</i>

129
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,165
<i>Seconds left on the clock.</i>

130
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,960
The ball is snapped,

131
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,213
and the QB fumbles.

132
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,716
Disaster.

133
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,636
Looks like the game is over.

134
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,181
I'm reading the whole
central core off-alignment.

135
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:41,350
You don't have the necessary
tools down there.

136
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,143
<i>And a new fuel cell is
not going to fix that.</i>

137
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:49,358
But this QB runs back,
and picks up his own fumble.

138
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:50,692
Hold on, what did you just do?

139
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,403
<i>There's a wall of line backers
closing in on him.</i>

140
00:10:55,322 --> 00:11:00,202
<i>So, he throws a long ball with
no idea who is at the other end.</i>

141
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,037
A Hail Mary.

142
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,124
Eighty-thousand people
on their feet,

143
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,418
watching this ball
sail through the air.

144
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:15,384
Downfield is a rookie
wide receiver, third string.

145
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,053
He just leaps out of the pack.

146
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,598
Touchdown!

147
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:41,785
Contact! West contact!

148
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,540
<i>Jack?</i>

149
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,250
It's okay, Vika.

150
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,086
It's just a dog.

151
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,344
Hey.

152
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,889
Now, go on. You
gotta get out of here.

153
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,266
Go on, get!

154
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,560
Get out of here! Go!

155
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,778
<i>Tech-49, Jack Harper.</i>

156
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,724
You're welcome.

157
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:51,772
166 is back online.

158
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:03,575
Two drones shot down today. Ten
fuel cells stolen in just over a month.

159
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,994
These scavs are
getting bolder.

160
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,163
<i>Well, the hydro rigs
are taking all the water.</i>

161
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:11,416
Once we're gone, they'll have
nothing but dust and radiation.

162
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,835
<i>This is bullshit.</i>

163
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,837
We won the war.

164
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,507
Now we have to leave.

165
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,511
Two more weeks, Jack.

166
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,514
<i>Then we'll be on
our way to Titan.</i>

167
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:27,849
Yep.

168
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,478
That drone is out
there somewhere.

169
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,023
We just have to find it.

170
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,527
Without a beacon, that's like
finding a needle in a haystack.

171
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,204
So we go
to our ground game.

172

00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,562
down a sinkhole.

175
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,815
No visual,
but I can hear it.

176
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,067
Tet's so far off angle,
I can barely see you.

177
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:43,443
How's it look?

178
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,406
It's good, it's good. There's
no sign of scav activity on top.

179
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,617
<i>Tet's offline
in 15 minutes.</i>

180
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,496
<i>After that,
you're on your own.</i>

181
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,015
<i>Mission,
this is Tower 49.</i>

182
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:18,353
<i>Jack has located drone 172.
Engaged in recovery now.</i>

183
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,940
Requesting backup
to his location ASAP.

184
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,013
I've got a visual
on Drone 172.

185
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,056
Jack?

186
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,749
What the hell?

187
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,380
Shit.

188
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,353
Ha!

189
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,189
Jack!

190
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,263
Tech-49,
Jack Harper.

191
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,602
Jack Harper, Tech-49!

192
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,146
Hey!

193
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,528
Oh, no.

194
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:23,950
Come on.
Not my goddamn bike!

195
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:32,101
"How can a
man die better Than facing fearful odds

196
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,355
"For the ashes of his fathers
And the temples of his Gods"

197
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:36,731
Jack?

198
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,527
Yep, I'll be right there.

199
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,712
<i>How does 109 look?</i>

200
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:00,880
Can it fly?

201
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,715
Barely.

202
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:06,427
And without armor,
she's a sitting duck.

203
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,597
Well, I'll talk to Sally about
that shielding in the morning.

204
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:10,807
Okay.

205
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,891
Again.

206
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:20,191
What, Jack Harper?

207
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,659
Where did you get this?

208
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,202
It was growing in...

209
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,635
Come on, Jack,
you know the regulations.

210
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,970
I know you think
I'm a stickler

211
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,346
but you have no idea
what kind of toxins

212
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,473
could be in something
like that.

213
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,183
It's a flower, Vika.

214
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,476
Yeah,
that's not the point.

215
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,645
It's that we are
so close to the end,

216
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:00,565
and the last thing that we
need is you putting it all at risk.

217
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,068
Okay.

218
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,741
Every day,
you have to go down there

219
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,578
and see what was lost.

220
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:17,206
But we've done our job,
Jack.

221
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,879
It's time to go.

222
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,096
I don't think they were
trying to kill me today.

223
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,182
The scavs.

224
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,147
They were trying to catch me.

225
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,446
Well, they can't have you.

226
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,047
Come on.

227
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,107
You should come with me
sometime, before we leave.

228
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:11,237
There's a place I found
I'd like to show you.

229
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:17,368
I'll show you something.

230
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,913
Hey, hey!

231
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,997
Oh, my God.

232
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,717
<i>It was a six-stage
meltdown from inside the hydro rig's core.</i>

233
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,511
<i>It's offline permanently.</i>

234
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:01,430
<i>Tower 49, you have put
the whole operation at risk.</i>

235
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,683
<i>I need to know
exactly what happened.</i>

236
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,561
<i>Jack believes the scavs
weaponized one of the stolen fuel cells</i>

237
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,771
<i>and got it into the suction.</i>

238
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,356
<i>Tower, hold.</i>

239
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:16,070
Tower, I've got a rogue signal
in Grid 37. Are you seeing this?

240
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:17,572
Yes.

241
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,365
<i>It's gotta be scav.</i>

242
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:21,576
It's not one of ours.

243
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:25,705
Jack, the signal is
being directed off-planet.

244
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:27,748
On my way.

245
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:33,087
<i>Tower, our logs show you are
missing an additional nine fuel cells.</i>

246
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,255
<i>Can you confirm?</i>

247
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,465
Negative, Mission,
that number is 10.

248
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,051
Drone 172 was
lost last night.

249
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,097
109 is combat-ready as soon
as we get that shielding.

250
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,308
We can cover the remaining
rigs with drones in the field.

251
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,434
I've run the numbers.

252
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:48,436
<i>We'll do the numbers up here,
Tower.</i>

253
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:51,022
<i>I'm tasking the drones
to defensive positions.</i>

254
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:52,690
Copy.

255
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:56,110
<i>Our job is to run those rigs.
Your directive is to protect them.</i>

256
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:59,947
<i>We cannot afford to lose
another. Do you copy?</i>

257
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:01,032
Copy.

258
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,284
<i>Are you and Jack
an effective team?</i>

259
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,577
Damn right we are.

260
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:16,464
Jack?

261
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,133
You're right on top of it.
Do you have a visual?

262
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,470
<i>Jack?</i>

263
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,722
Yeah, I got it.

264
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,913
They have some kind
of a repeater.

265
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,501
The scavs are using
the building as an antenna.

266
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:18,669
Can you decrypt?

267
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,051
It's a set of coordinates.

268
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,261
<i>Grid 17.</i>

269
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,388
<i>It's a goddamn homing beacon.</i>

270
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:30,765
Grid 17.

271
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,349
What the hell is out there?

272
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,189
Nothing.
It's the middle of nowhere.

273
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,108
<i>What is going on?</i>

274
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:45,404
Why would the scavs send
a signal off-planet, Jack?

275
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,657
I'm shutting it down.

276
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:04,465
Tech-49, check your course.
You're headed right for the border.

277
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:09,136
<i>That radiation will cook you
from the inside before you know it.</i>

278
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,263
It's okay, Vika.
I see it.

279
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:17,728
I'm gonna do a perimeter check
before I head home.

280
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:21,232
I may go off-comm.

281
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:22,566
Jack,
we should keep in contact.

282
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,901
Just let me
know where you are.

283
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,071
<i>Do you copy?</i>

284
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:30,116
<i>Jack, do you copy?</i>

285
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,000
That's right, Bob.

286
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,503
You know where we're going.

287
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,397
Are you gonna miss me?

288
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,784
I'm gonna
miss this place.

289
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:40,329
It would have been great.

290
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:49,964
It would have been great.

291
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:56,697
<i>Vika? Vika,
did you get that?</i>

292
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,365
<i>Jack,
where have you been?</i>

293
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,492
An object came down in 17.

294
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,952
That's the beacon coordinates.

295
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,078
Exactly.

296
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:04,997
<i>I saw it.
Some sort of vessel.</i>

297
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:06,540
Jack,
Mission's almost offline.

298
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,375
<i>I'm en route now.</i>

299
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,712
Mission, we have an
unidentified object impact in 17.

300
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:14,048
It came down at coordinates
sent by a scav beacon.

301
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,215
My tech's en route now.

302
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,551
<i>Tower,
we're going offline soon,</i>

303
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,845
<i>but drones are already
mobile and executing.</i>

304
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,722
<i>Have your tech stand down.</i>

305
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,307
Copy.

306
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:25,851
Jack, Mission wants you to stand
down. The drones will handle it.

307
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,644
<i>That's a negative,
Tower.</i>

308
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:30,064
With Tet offline,
we need our eyes on this.

309
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,066
I want to know
this site is secure.

310
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:37,404
Sally, my tech's concerned
about the security of the site.

311
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:39,865
<i>Tower, you have lost
enough assets for today.</i>

312
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,992
<i>Keep your tech out of there.
Do you copy?</i>

313
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,410
Copy, Command, I'm...

314
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:51,919
Jack, Command wants you to stand
down. The drones will handle this.

315
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:53,670
<i>I'm on site.</i>

316
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:55,089
<i>Jack.</i>

317
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,925
<i>I don't have eyes on you.
Command's offline.</i>

318
00:36:58,092 --> 00:37:01,053
Vika,
I think it's one of ours.

319
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:05,265
This thing is ancient.
It looks...

320
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,267
...pre-war.

321
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,770
The scavs brought
this thing down, Jack.

322
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:11,230
There's no sign of scavs.

323
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:12,773
<i>Technician,
this is your Control.</i>

324
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,068
I'm ordering you to pull out and
return to the tower immediately.

325
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,446
Touching down.

326
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,777
They're human.

327
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,745
Tower, we have got survivors.

328
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:13,917
There are four...
Check it, five survivors.

329
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:16,003
They are human.

330
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:49,953
Stand down!

331
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,080
Vika, the drones are
firing on survivors.

332
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:55,751
Jack, the Tet's offline.
I don't have control.

333
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,044
Stand down!

334
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:07,638
<i>Jack Harper, Tech-49.</i>

335
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,897
<i>Back off, you son of a bitch!</i>

336
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,822
<i>Back off!</i>

337
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,308
Open the door.

338
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,186
Vika!

339
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,243
Get the med kit.

340
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,371
Get the med kit!

341
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,053
This has to be reported.

342
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,512
Be sure and report
that the drones

343
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,181
killed the crew from
one of our own ships.

344
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,058
See what Command
makes of that.

345
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:26,151
It's breathing fluid.
Just let her get it out.

346
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:38,538
Jack.

347
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,609
Here.
You're still dehydrated.

348
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:24,668
Where are we?

349
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,421
I'm Victoria,
this is Jack.

350
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,010
What's your name?

351
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,723
I'm Julia.

352
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,599
Julia...

353
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:43,061
I'm sorry for what
I have to tell you,

354
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,272
but you were in a crash.

355
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,191
Your ship came down.

356
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,653
Jack managed to pull you
from the wreckage.

357
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:54,948
But none of
your crew survived.

358
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,291
What do you mean?

359
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,835
You're the only one
that made it.

360
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:11,548
I'm sorry.

361
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:22,267
You've been in delta sleep
for a long time.

362
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:26,646
Some disorientation is normal.

363
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,106
How long?

364
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,154
Sixty years.

365
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:35,989
At least.

366
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:49,419
I have to get
back to our ship.

367
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,553
It's too dangerous down there.
You need to rest.

368
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:10,190
Vika...

369
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:14,361
Don't touch me.

370
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:23,036
Your ship's re-entry was triggered
by a beacon from the surface.

371
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:25,539
Do you know
anything about that?

372
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:35,882
What was your mission?

373
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:40,262
It's classified.

374
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,888
Well, we have
no record of an <i>Odyssey...</i>

375
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:43,223
I can't
tell you anything

376
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,933
until I get the flight
recorder from my ship.

377
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:49,229
Julia, a lot has
changed in 60 years.

378
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:58,071
While you were
in delta sleep,

379
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:00,448
Earth was attacked.

380
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,952
Call them scavs.

381
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:09,583
They destroyed our moon
and with that, half the planet.

382
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:13,420
Then they invaded.

383
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:15,088
We won the war,

384
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:17,674
but Earth was ruined.

385
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,011
Everyone's on Titan now.
It's a moon of Saturn.

386
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:25,432
Or on the space station,
getting ready to go.

387
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:31,438
We're here for security
and drone maintenance.

388
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:35,525
We're the mop-up crew.

389
00:45:56,296 --> 00:45:58,340
You've lost people.

390
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:00,967
Everything.

391
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,723
If you want to be alone,
we understand.

392
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:22,489
The drones killed
her entire crew.

393
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:26,660
If I hadn't gotten there...

394
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,370
I want her gone first thing.

395
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:29,913
Vika...

396
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:34,876
Do you have any memories
before the mission?

397
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:38,672
Before the security wipe?

398
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,884
Our job is not to remember.

399
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:45,887
Remember?

400
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,181
Do you remember her?

401
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:54,396
Jack...

402
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:59,359
That was a scav beacon
that brought her down.

403
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,279
We don't know who she is.

404
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,449
Or what she is.

405
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:11,705
Let's just get
through the night.

406
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,707
Okay?

407
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,580
You fly that thing?

408
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,708
Yes.

409
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,297
What happens now?

410
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,760
The Tet will
be online soon.

411
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:10,221
Victoria will
report your rescue.

412
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:13,308
They'll send
someone down for you.

413
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:16,269
From the Tet?

414
00:48:17,062 --> 00:48:18,271
Yes.

415
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,569
I need to get the flight
recorder from my ship.

416
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,448
The scavs,
they move at night.

417
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:30,533
They could be
all over it by now.

418
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:32,535
I need to
know what happened.

419
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,915
You need to
know what happened.

420
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:40,627
Please.

421
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,110
Jack?

422
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,320
Jack, what are you doing?

423
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:08,780
Vika, she's a flight officer.

424
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:12,200
She wants to see her ship
and secure the flight recorder.

425
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:13,827
Now, you would
want the same thing.

426
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,662
<i>Jack, I...</i>

427
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:20,500
I can't protect you.

428
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,838
No, I understand.

429
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,634
This one's on me.

430
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:13,928
I couldn't save them.

431
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:27,442
Jack. Jack!

432
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:33,573
Jack, can you hear me?

433
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,566
All right,
it's time to go.

434
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,109
Jack.

435
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:12,487
I found it.

436
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:25,708
Jack!

437
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:34,193
<i>Tower 49, how are y'all
this lovely morning?</i>

438
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,946
Another day in paradise.

439
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:39,407
Sally...

440
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:45,204
Jack took a pre-dawn patrol

441
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:49,000
and went off-comm

442
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:54,172
near the canyons in 17.

443
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:57,508
Now,
I know we're low on drones,

444
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:03,306
but, um, requesting one
to sweep the area.

445
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,394
Just a quick scout.

446
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:13,649
<i>Copy 49,
tasking 185 to Grid 22.</i>

447
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:50,937
"And how can a man
die better Than facing fearful odds

448
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,565
"For the ashes of his fathers

449
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:57,610
"And the temples of his Gods"

450
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,421
I've been watching you, Jack.

451
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:19,465
You're curious.

452
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:21,843
What are you looking
for in those books?

453
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:26,139
Do they bring
back old memories?

454
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:28,641
You won't get
anything from me.

455
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:30,476
My memory has been
wiped to protect...

456
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:33,563
...the security of
the mission. Yes.

457
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:37,024
You can't have
your precious memory

458
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:39,444
falling into the wrong
hands, now, can you?

459
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,238
Tell me.

460
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:46,742
Have you ever met
a scav up close?

461
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:52,498
Of course not.
You just repair drones.

462
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,251
"Don't go into
the radiation zone."

463
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:59,464
"Don't ask too
many questions."

464
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:04,343
Not part of
the job description.

465
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,220
Lights.

466
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:32,205
We're not alien, Jack.

467
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:34,290
We're human.

468
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:38,461
Of course, for us,
being human is a problem.

469
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:46,844
Old stealth fighter tech.
Shields us from your scanners.

470
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,846
Vocal scrambling.

471
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:50,848
Can you hear me, Jack?

472
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:54,685
Keeps your drones confused.

473
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:58,564
Well, most of the time.

474
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,149
The drones are programmed...

475
00:56:00,233 --> 00:56:01,859
To kill humans, Jack.

476
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:05,029
You saw what they did
to those sleep pods.

477
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:09,408
You almost got yourself blown
to bits protecting that woman.

478
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:15,665
Why did you do that?

479
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:18,584
Anyone would have.

480
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:19,961
"Anyone."

481
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:22,630
Interesting.

482
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,298
We're wasting our time.

483
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:26,759
The drone will
track him here.

484
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:28,052
That's Sergeant Sykes.

485
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:32,390
He thinks I'm a fool for
having brought you here.

486
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:40,356
I hope you prove him wrong.

487
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:53,035
Mission,
I'm picking up a bio trail

488
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,287
somewhere near
the west canyons.

489
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:55,913
Can you confirm the sequence?

490
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,415
<i>Stand by.</i>

491
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,502
<i>DNA confirmed.
It's Jack.</i>

492
00:57:04,297 --> 00:57:06,173
<i>Vika, are you okay?</i>

493
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:08,884
<i>Everything good
between you two?</i>

494
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:10,469
Of course.

495
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,972
<i>You're still
an effective team?</i>

496
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,099
We're great.

497
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:17,893
Never better.

498
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,396
<i>We were running
a ground game, and losing.</i>

499
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:22,815
So, we decided,
"What the hell?

500
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:25,276
"We've got to
throw the long ball."

501
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:28,821
It took us decades just
to crack the GPS codes.

502
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:31,657
That's how you brought
down the <i>Odyssey.</i>

503
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,411
Why?

504
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:40,041
The <i>Odyssey's</i> compact
reactor, courtesy of NASA.

505
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:42,752
Very hard to come by.

506
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:47,340
Did you like
the show last night?

507
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:53,095
That was just one fuel cell.

508
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:56,182
Imagine what 10
of them will do,

509
00:57:56,349 --> 00:58:00,519
with a core of
weapons-grade plutonium.

510
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:05,066
We have a nuke, and
we have a drone to carry it.

511
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:09,195
But we can't access it.
It doesn't know who we are.

512
00:58:11,364 --> 00:58:13,824
But it knows you, Jack.

513
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:23,125
We need you to
program the drone.

514
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:26,879
Have it carry our
nuke up to the Tet.

515
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,136
End this war.

516
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:39,809
There are people up there.

517
00:58:42,103 --> 00:58:43,104
Sergeant.

518
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:46,899
Program the drone
to return to the Tet.

519
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:50,986
It needs to go
right to the center.

520
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:54,073
Screw you.

521
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:57,910
We haven't got time for this.

522
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:24,770
Hey. Hey!

523
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:37,783
No.

524
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:45,958
Let's go!
Get him up.

525
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:44,850
Mission,
185 just went off-grid.

526
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:46,977
<i>Copy, Tower,
we're seeing the same thing.</i>

527
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:49,688
Permission to task
two additional drones?

528
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:54,026
If one drone is here,
more will come.

529
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:57,404
And they won't stop
until they find me.

530
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,865
They'll turn
this place to dust.

531
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:03,160
But if you let us go,
I'll call them off.

532
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:09,834
It's your only chance.

533
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:26,851
I've been to your

534
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:29,395
"radiation zones."

535
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:32,231
If you're looking
for the truth,

536
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:35,901
that's where you'll find it.

537
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:53,043
You've risked all our lives.
Everything.

538
01:01:53,586 --> 01:01:56,297
What makes you
think he's different?

539
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,049
She does.

540
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:58,984
<i>Mission, I've found
my tech over in 37.</i>

541
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:00,653
<i>You can call off the search.</i>

542
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:03,322
<i>Copy that, Tower.
Glad Jack's safe.</i>

543
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:06,617
<i>Tasking the other drones
back to rig support.</i>

544
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:32,351
Where are we
going now?

545
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:35,980
Who are you?

546
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:41,402
What aren't you
telling me?

547
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:43,696
Jack, I...

548
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,531
What were you
doing on the <i>Odyssey?</i>

549
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,409
What was your mission?

550
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:55,249
It was a research flight
to Titan. My first.

551
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:58,877
That's what it was
supposed to be.

552
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:05,718
Six weeks to launch, deep space
scanners picked up an alien object.

553
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:08,387
We were reassigned
to investigate.

554
01:04:09,263 --> 01:04:10,472
They put us all in delta.

555
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:14,560
They must have woken
you and Victoria first.

556
01:04:19,148 --> 01:04:20,274
What?

557
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:22,401
That object

558
01:04:22,568 --> 01:04:24,570
was the Tet, Jack.

559
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,490
The Tet was our mission.

560
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:33,954
That's impossible.

561
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:36,457
That's impossible!

562
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:39,001
Who are you?

563
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:44,089
I'm your wife.

564
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:53,265
I don't know what happened, but
you're not who you think you are.

565
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,318
Jack, we were here.

566
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:09,698
You asked me to meet you,
brought me up on top of the world.

567
01:05:15,162 --> 01:05:18,123
I could tell
you were nervous that day.

568
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:20,959
It was right here, Jack.

569
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:27,633
You said,

570
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,968
"Look through here,

571
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:32,513
"and I'll show you the
future."

572
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,850
And I held up a ring.

573
01:05:57,663 --> 01:05:58,831
And you said...

574
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,541
"Yes."

575
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:09,883
There you are.

576
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:14,179
There you are.

577
01:06:38,412 --> 01:06:39,413
Hi.

578
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,456
Hello.

579
01:06:44,293 --> 01:06:45,794
Come on.

580
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:50,525
<i>Vika, I'm coming in.</i>

581
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:55,906
<i>Do not report to Mission
until I get back. Do you copy?</i>

582
01:07:56,782 --> 01:07:58,242
<i>Do you copy?</i>

583
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:17,678
Vika, open the door.

584
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:20,013
Stay away from me.

585
01:08:21,265 --> 01:08:23,016
I don't want
to hear it.

586
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:26,853
It's not safe here,
and we need to leave, now.

587
01:08:30,524 --> 01:08:32,442
It was always her.

588
01:08:35,362 --> 01:08:36,697
Wasn't it?

589
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:39,199
Vika...

590
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,498
She's my wife.

591
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:04,683
Mission,
this is Tower 49.

592
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,184
<i>Go ahead, 49.</i>

593
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:07,728
No.

594
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:10,314
I'm having a problem
with my technician.

595
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,232
No, you don't know
what you're doing.

596
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,026
He found a survivor
at the crash site.

597
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:15,152
You've gotta listen to me.

598
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:17,404
She's impeding
his abilities,

599
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,324
and he is unfit
for service.

600
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:21,783
No, no, no.

601
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:24,661
<i>I'm sorry to
hear that, Vika.</i>

602
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:27,205
<i>Are you still
an effective team?</i>

603
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,291
Vika...

604
01:09:29,458 --> 01:09:31,168
Open the goddamn door, Vika!

605
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:33,045
No.

606
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:39,176
We are not
an effective team.

607
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:04,076
Vika, please.
We have to go now.

608
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:06,578
I'm not going anywhere
with you, Jack.

609
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:10,248
There's a place I know.
We'll be safe.

610
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:12,542
I'm going to Titan.

611
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:16,213
There is no Titan.

612
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:18,340
They lied to us.

613
01:10:18,507 --> 01:10:20,801
Just stay away from me.

614
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:25,222
Vika, please,
there are things...

615
01:10:25,389 --> 01:10:26,431
Things you need to know.

616
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:28,433
I don't want to know!

617
01:10:32,938 --> 01:10:33,939
Jack...

618
01:11:13,645 --> 01:11:17,357
<i>Hi, Jack. I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.</i>

619
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,360
What have you done?

620
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:24,281
<i>You can't blame yourself
for this. Drones are unreliable.</i>

621
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:26,366
<i>Sometimes things go wrong.</i>

622
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:29,077
"Go wrong"?

623
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:33,248
You killed her.

624
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:38,295
<i>I know, it's tragic.
She was a wonderful person.</i>

625
01:11:38,462 --> 01:11:41,631
<i>Jack, we want to bring you in.</i>

626
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:44,468
<i>I've been
authorized to tell you</i>

627
01:11:44,593 --> 01:11:46,803
<i>we're going to
assign you a new mission.</i>

628
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,847
<i>You and the survivor.</i>

629
01:11:55,437 --> 01:11:58,648
<i>There's a lot of interest
up here. Bring her up.</i>

630
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:02,277
<i>We can debrief,
then anything's possible.</i>

631
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:05,530
<i>It's time to come home, Jack.</i>

632
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:07,991
<i>Jack?</i>

633
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:09,868
<i>Jack?</i>

634
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,088
Jack...

635
01:12:24,758 --> 01:12:26,218
I'm sorry.

636
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:40,232
Hang on.

637
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:02,212
Lightning.

638
01:13:02,754 --> 01:13:03,755
That's the plan.

639
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:40,500
We need cover.

640
01:13:41,501 --> 01:13:42,627
There.

641
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:31,486
Are you okay?
No.

642
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:43,915
Don't worry,
we're staying out of there.

643
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:54,426
Are we gonna die?

644
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:55,593
No!

645
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:00,348
Maybe.

646
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:02,600
Jack!

647
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:44,684
Son of a bitch.

648
01:16:52,776 --> 01:16:53,777
Wait here.

649
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,442
Who is it?

650
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:14,983
Hey!

651
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:16,985
Wait!

652
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,153
Wait!

653
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,947
Hey!

654
01:18:39,507 --> 01:18:40,717
Drop your weapon!

655
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:57,984
It's okay.

656
01:19:01,613 --> 01:19:02,780
Don't move!

657
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:09,287
We have to shut
that drone down.

658
01:19:11,456 --> 01:19:12,457
Stop moving!

659
01:19:12,624 --> 01:19:13,666
Jack!

660
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:22,068
It's okay.

661
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:44,382
Julia.

662
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:48,344
Julia!

663
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:58,771
Don't.

664
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:01,399
Don't touch me.

665
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:20,209
Hold on.

666
01:21:20,835 --> 01:21:22,336
Just hold on.

667
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:56,621
Jack Harper, Tech-52.

668
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:07,650
Hey.

669
01:23:07,817 --> 01:23:09,527
There you are.

670
01:23:13,531 --> 01:23:15,032
What happened?
Are you okay?

671
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:18,619
That bogey came across
the border and then I lost you.

672
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:22,498
False alarm.

673
01:23:27,128 --> 01:23:28,462
I should get back out there.

674
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:32,175
You come all the way home,
and I don't get a kiss?

675
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,062
What's going on up there?

676
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:48,399
I was thinking...

677
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:51,402
Why don't you
come down with me?

678
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:54,572
To the surface?

679
01:23:54,822 --> 01:23:56,657
We could go right now.

680
01:23:57,033 --> 01:23:58,576
Now?

681
01:23:59,452 --> 01:24:00,494
Yeah.

682
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,997
Are you serious?

683
01:24:03,164 --> 01:24:05,666
You won't believe
what's down there.

684
01:24:10,213 --> 01:24:11,923
Jack...

685
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,717
You know the regulations.

686
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:17,094
Yes.

687
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:22,767
Can we not do this again?
I'm done talking about it.

688
01:24:24,852 --> 01:24:26,354
Okay.

689
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:16,862
This is gonna hurt.

690
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:30,334
Hell of a day, huh, Bob?

691
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,838
You always loved this song.

692
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:03,427
I'm not him.

693
01:27:06,514 --> 01:27:08,265
I know I'm not.

694
01:27:11,602 --> 01:27:13,562
But I've loved you...

695
01:27:16,357 --> 01:27:18,526
...for as long
as I can remember.

696
01:27:19,944 --> 01:27:22,405
I don't know
how else to say it.

697
01:27:27,785 --> 01:27:30,413
You know what
you said to me once?

698
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:36,085
You said when it was all over, you
would build me a house on a lake.

699
01:27:39,046 --> 01:27:42,800
We would grow old
and fat together.

700
01:27:44,218 --> 01:27:45,886
And we would fight.

701
01:27:47,096 --> 01:27:49,432
Maybe drink too much.

702
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:52,560
Real romantic.

703
01:27:56,522 --> 01:27:59,358
And then we would die

704
01:28:00,443 --> 01:28:03,028
and be buried in
a meadow by the lake.

705
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:08,492
And the world would
forget about us.

706
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:15,082
But we would
always have each other.

707
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,587
I remember.

708
01:28:21,338 --> 01:28:24,049
Those memories
are yours, Jack.

709
01:28:25,593 --> 01:28:27,052
They're ours.

710
01:28:29,263 --> 01:28:30,264
They are you.

711
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:33,744
Good morning.

712
01:29:39,959 --> 01:29:42,378
I wanted to spend
the rest of my life here.

713
01:29:44,338 --> 01:29:45,506
You still can.

714
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,428
I have to go.

715
01:29:51,929 --> 01:29:54,348
Those people need my help.

716
01:30:01,272 --> 01:30:03,274
We'll come back
when it's over.

717
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,443
Promise me.

718
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:10,698
We'll come back
when it's over.

719
01:30:47,526 --> 01:30:49,862
You had me worried
for a second.

720
01:30:51,155 --> 01:30:53,324
I thought you
weren't coming back.

721
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:58,037
Well,
I had to prove him wrong.

722
01:31:01,332 --> 01:31:02,541
You look like shit.

723
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:07,046
You should see
the other guy.

724
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:08,964
If I had told you what
you'd find out there,

725
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:11,008
you would have
thought I was crazy.

726
01:31:12,176 --> 01:31:14,011
I still do.

727
01:31:15,846 --> 01:31:16,889
Malcolm Beech.

728
01:31:17,181 --> 01:31:18,390
Julia Harper.

729
01:31:26,732 --> 01:31:27,983
Come on.

730
01:31:34,365 --> 01:31:35,491
<i>Mission,
I'm picking up a bio-trail</i>

731
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:36,700
<i>somewhere near
the West Canyons.</i>

732
01:31:36,867 --> 01:31:38,702
<i>Can you confirm the sequence?</i>

733
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:40,371
<i>Stand by.</i>

734
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:43,749
<i>DNA confirmed,
it's Jack.</i>

735
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:47,878
<i>Mission,
185 just went off-grid.</i>

736
01:31:48,045 --> 01:31:50,339
<i>Copy, Tower.
We're seeing the same thing.</i>

737
01:32:00,641 --> 01:32:04,728
I'd been in the army less than a
year when that unholy Tet arrived.

738
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:08,190
I saw the moon
get taken out.

739
01:32:08,357 --> 01:32:10,651
Right up there
in the night sky.

740
01:32:12,611 --> 01:32:13,779
I couldn't believe it.

741
01:32:15,531 --> 01:32:18,200
After that,
nature took over.

742
01:32:19,368 --> 01:32:20,828
There's bedrock
around Chicago,

743
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:25,290
so we were spared the worst
of the waves and the quakes.

744
01:32:27,084 --> 01:32:28,961
Most people just starved.

745
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:33,674
Then the Tet sent
troop ships down.

746
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:35,801
The doors opened,

747
01:32:36,969 --> 01:32:39,096
and out you came.

748
01:32:40,472 --> 01:32:42,975
Astronaut Jack Harper.

749
01:32:44,393 --> 01:32:46,603
Thousands of you.

750
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:50,274
Memory wiped.

751
01:32:52,317 --> 01:32:53,777
Programmed to kill.

752
01:32:55,696 --> 01:32:58,198
They had taken
one of our best

753
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:00,993
and turned him
against us.

754
01:33:04,413 --> 01:33:05,914
No soul.

755
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:09,835
No humanity.

756
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:15,174
The Tet.

757
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:18,719
What a brilliant machine.

758
01:33:19,553 --> 01:33:23,390
Feeding off one planet
after another for energy.

759
01:33:25,184 --> 01:33:28,187
Phase Two was drones.

760
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:30,314
Repairmen.

761
01:33:30,856 --> 01:33:36,653
50 years of watching those
hydro rigs suck our planet dry.

762
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:40,908
Then one day,

763
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:45,120
I saw you set down.

764
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:48,165
Another drone to fix.

765
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:53,170
But in the rubble
that day was a book.

766
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:56,965
You picked it up.

767
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:59,384
You studied it.

768
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:04,515
And I thought I saw a way.

769
01:34:06,683 --> 01:34:09,895
When you stepped in front
of that drone and saved her,

770
01:34:11,063 --> 01:34:12,189
I knew.

771
01:34:13,524 --> 01:34:16,193
You were in there somewhere.

772
01:34:17,361 --> 01:34:20,697
I just had to find
a way to bring you back.

773
01:34:44,555 --> 01:34:46,139
Watch it,
watch it.

774
01:34:46,306 --> 01:34:48,141
Eyes on it.
Steady.

775
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:50,310
Give it some space.

776
01:34:50,936 --> 01:34:52,729
Come on, you're
making it nervous.

777
01:34:56,066 --> 01:34:58,610
That is one
pissed-off weapon.

778
01:34:59,403 --> 01:35:02,573
No, it's just a machine.

779
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:07,953
<i>I'm the weapon.</i>

780
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:24,887
I would love to
be there to see

781
01:35:25,012 --> 01:35:27,180
that thing's face
when this goes off.

782
01:35:27,598 --> 01:35:29,766
That would be
a one-way trip.

783
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:33,395
Yeah,
but it would be worth it.

784
01:35:51,872 --> 01:35:53,957
Welcome back, Commander.

785
01:36:34,373 --> 01:36:35,749
Open the doors!

786
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:03,276
Shit!

787
01:37:03,402 --> 01:37:04,528
Spread out!

788
01:37:11,785 --> 01:37:13,537
Head down,
keep your head down!

789
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:45,902
Jack!

790
01:37:46,862 --> 01:37:48,238
Follow me!

791
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:49,132
Come on, you son of a bitch!

792
01:39:50,652 --> 01:39:51,653
Hey!

793
01:40:52,172 --> 01:40:53,298
Jack.

794
01:40:59,596 --> 01:41:01,473
I'm okay.

795
01:41:21,952 --> 01:41:23,328
The drone.

796
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:25,622
Send the drone.

797
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,670
It's gone.

798
01:41:33,797 --> 01:41:35,966
I thought we had it.

799
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:38,718
I really did.

800
01:41:40,470 --> 01:41:42,681
I can take
the bomb myself.

801
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:44,140
Ah...

802
01:41:45,141 --> 01:41:47,644
You know it will
swat you like a fly.

803
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:49,562
Not if I go.

804
01:41:52,565 --> 01:41:53,817
No.

805
01:41:55,193 --> 01:41:57,529
She asked you
to bring me up.

806
01:41:59,155 --> 01:42:00,532
So bring me up.

807
01:42:03,702 --> 01:42:06,371
We'll go together.

808
01:42:21,553 --> 01:42:24,055
It reminds me of home.

809
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:35,692
Ready?

810
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:15,273
Jack.

811
01:43:19,569 --> 01:43:21,363
Dream of us.

812
01:43:36,378 --> 01:43:37,712
Jack...

813
01:44:25,969 --> 01:44:29,305
<i>Flight
recorder play back for the</i> Odyssey <i>mission.</i>

814
01:44:29,472 --> 01:44:31,975
<i>3 May, 2017.</i>

815
01:44:32,142 --> 01:44:33,768
Okay, Bob.

816
01:44:34,644 --> 01:44:36,438
Ready for space?

817
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:51,035
<i>Good morning,</i> Odyssey,
<i>from your friends here at Mission Control.</i>

818
01:44:51,202 --> 01:44:53,204
<i>Good morning, Mission.
This is Commander Jack Harper.</i>

819
01:44:53,371 --> 01:44:55,665
<i>Thank you for that
fantastic wake-up call.</i>

820
01:44:55,832 --> 01:44:57,125
<i>Pre-rendezvous
checks complete.</i>

821
01:44:57,292 --> 01:45:00,670
<i>Electrical guidance
and nav systems, all good.</i>

822
01:45:00,837 --> 01:45:04,048
Range behind object,
250 clicks...

823
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:08,011
12 below V-bar, closure rate
200 kilometers per hour.

824
01:45:08,178 --> 01:45:11,014
<i>Copy that.
It's good to see you, Jack.</i>

825
01:45:11,181 --> 01:45:14,184
<i>After 39 days of sleep,
sounds like you're ready to go.</i>

826
01:45:14,893 --> 01:45:16,561
I'm ready to go.

827
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:18,563
<i>Your next burn will
bring you up level</i>

828
01:45:18,730 --> 01:45:21,900
<i>and co-speed at 50 kilometer
range, where you'll hold.</i>

829
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:24,694
Copy. We'll hold
50 clicks from object

830
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:26,988
for sensor scan
and evaluation.

831
01:45:27,405 --> 01:45:28,865
Targets look good.

832
01:45:29,032 --> 01:45:32,368
Initiating burn in 3, 2, 1 ...

833
01:45:32,535 --> 01:45:33,578
Ignition.

834
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:38,708
<i>We see a good burn.</i>

835
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:41,419
<i>Are you reading any
output from the object?</i>

836
01:45:41,586 --> 01:45:42,587
Negative.

837
01:45:42,754 --> 01:45:44,672
Zero heat.
No EMR.

838
01:45:45,381 --> 01:45:46,716
There's no sign of life.

839
01:45:46,883 --> 01:45:48,760
<i>How is the rest
of the crew doing?</i>

840
01:45:48,927 --> 01:45:51,221
Co-pilot Victoria Olsen
should be up here shortly.

841
01:45:51,387 --> 01:45:54,724
The rest of the crew
remains in delta sleep.

842
01:45:55,141 --> 01:45:56,184
<i>Copy that.</i>

843
01:45:56,267 --> 01:45:58,603
<i>You missed a hell
of a game last night.</i>

844
01:45:58,770 --> 01:46:01,689
What did I tell you guys? No
spoilers about last night's game.

845
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:04,234
I'm looking forward to
watching it when I get back.

846
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,236
You're not talking about
football already, are you?

847
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:07,737
<i>Good morning, Vika.</i>

848
01:46:07,904 --> 01:46:08,905
<i>Good morning, Sally.</i>

849
01:46:09,239 --> 01:46:11,032
<i>How are you doing
this lovely morning?</i>

850
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:13,743
Another day in paradise.

851
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:15,411
Hey.

852
01:46:20,416 --> 01:46:21,417
One for history.

853
01:46:21,501 --> 01:46:22,502
Yeah.

854
01:46:35,765 --> 01:46:38,977
<i>Tech-49,
I have you on approach.</i>

855
01:46:39,561 --> 01:46:41,062
Hello, Sally.

856
01:46:42,438 --> 01:46:44,607
It's a busy morning, huh?

857
01:46:44,774 --> 01:46:47,986
<i>I'm picking up
a second passenger, Jack.</i>

858
01:46:51,406 --> 01:46:53,908
It's Julia Rusakova,

859
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:57,120
the female survivor
from the crashed module.

860
01:46:57,787 --> 01:46:59,956
<i>State your intention.</i>

861
01:47:00,748 --> 01:47:04,294
Deliver the survivor,
as requested.

862
01:47:04,794 --> 01:47:06,462
We are

863
01:47:08,464 --> 01:47:10,800
a more effective team.

864
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:13,636
<i>Proceed to entry.</i>

865
01:47:18,975 --> 01:47:21,477
<i>Mission,
we have a situation.</i>

866
01:47:21,644 --> 01:47:25,648
<i>The last burn was spot-on to
give us a 50-click hold from object,</i>

867
01:47:26,149 --> 01:47:28,318
but radar range
still decreasing.

868
01:47:28,484 --> 01:47:31,279
We're accelerating
toward the object.

869
01:47:31,446 --> 01:47:32,989
We're going to need
full OMS burn to pull away.

870
01:47:33,156 --> 01:47:34,782
Initiate now.
Entering target.

871
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:38,578
Gimbals set.
Target's good.

872
01:47:38,745 --> 01:47:40,663
Arm forward engines.
Engines on.

873
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:42,832
Ready? Let's go.

874
01:47:52,342 --> 01:47:55,345
Mission, we're in full OMS
burn, trying to back out.

875
01:47:55,511 --> 01:47:57,096
There's a lot of vibration.

876
01:47:58,306 --> 01:47:59,766
We're not getting
away from this thing.

877
01:47:59,932 --> 01:48:02,518
Odyssey, <i>telemetry shows
structural overstress.</i>

878
01:48:02,685 --> 01:48:05,021
<i>Knock off the burn.
Do you copy?</i>

879
01:48:05,313 --> 01:48:06,356
Cutting off burn.

880
01:48:08,858 --> 01:48:10,526
Mission.

881
01:48:11,194 --> 01:48:12,654
Mission?
Mission?

882
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:14,030
Sally?

883
01:48:15,156 --> 01:48:17,033
Increased acceleration
toward the object.

884
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:19,285
Estimated contact
within two minutes.

885
01:48:24,832 --> 01:48:26,793
I'm going to eject
the sleep module.

886
01:48:27,502 --> 01:48:29,462
It's programmed for
reinsertion into Earth orbit.

887
01:48:29,629 --> 01:48:32,548
I'll fly the Command module
out if I break free.

888
01:48:32,715 --> 01:48:34,509
I want you back there now.
Absolutely not.

889
01:48:34,676 --> 01:48:35,760
That's an order!

890
01:48:35,885 --> 01:48:37,053
Jack, no, we're a team.

891
01:48:59,701 --> 01:49:02,412
We've got to go,
Jack! 30 seconds!

892
01:49:05,164 --> 01:49:07,709
Dream of us.

893
01:49:48,374 --> 01:49:49,375
Jack...

894
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:08,895
<i>Tech-49,
enter at headway speed.</i>

895
01:50:09,937 --> 01:50:12,273
Entering at headway.

896
01:50:28,456 --> 01:50:29,624
You buck up, Bob.

897
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,336
Don't go all shaky on me.

898
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:09,121
<i>Jack,
I can't help notice</i>

899
01:51:09,288 --> 01:51:13,000
<i>your respiration
and heart rate have increased.</i>

900
01:51:13,835 --> 01:51:16,337
I'm just excited to
finally meet you, Sally.

901
01:51:16,504 --> 01:51:21,509
<i>There's been a pattern of
insubordinate behavior recently.</i>

902
01:51:22,802 --> 01:51:24,095
Yeah.

903
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:26,514
I feel bad about that.

904
01:51:27,723 --> 01:51:31,519
<i>Voice analysis indicates
you are lying to me, Jack.</i>

905
01:51:31,686 --> 01:51:33,479
<i>Tell me why you are here.</i>

906
01:51:33,646 --> 01:51:35,273
<i>You have five seconds.</i>

907
01:51:42,488 --> 01:51:44,574
I want Julia to live.

908
01:51:45,992 --> 01:51:48,661
I want our species
to survive.

909
01:51:50,705 --> 01:51:52,665
This is the only way.

910
01:51:58,379 --> 01:52:02,216
<i>Proceed to landing.
Atmosphere provided.</i>

911
01:53:00,358 --> 01:53:03,527
<i>Welcome home, Jack.</i>

912
01:53:16,499 --> 01:53:17,500
Come on.

913
01:53:17,667 --> 01:53:20,503
<i>Jack,
you're doing the right thing.</i>

914
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:24,382
I don't know what
you are, or where you're from,

915
01:53:26,258 --> 01:53:29,261
but I'd like to tell you
about something I read.

916
01:53:30,221 --> 01:53:33,349
A story from Rome,

917
01:53:34,350 --> 01:53:36,852
a city you destroyed.

918
01:53:37,687 --> 01:53:39,355
It's a classic.

919
01:53:40,231 --> 01:53:43,359
There was a guy, Horatius,

920
01:53:44,235 --> 01:53:47,363
held the bridge alone
against a whole army.

921
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:49,991
And what Horatius said was,

922
01:53:50,157 --> 01:53:52,201
"How can a man die better..."

923
01:53:52,368 --> 01:53:56,956
<i>You don't have to die, Jack.
She doesn't have to die.</i>

924
01:53:57,123 --> 01:53:59,500
Everybody dies, Sally.

925
01:53:59,667 --> 01:54:01,377
The thing is, to die well.

926
01:54:10,386 --> 01:54:14,890
<i>Jack, that's not
the survivor you promised me.</i>

927
01:54:15,641 --> 01:54:17,643
No, it's not.

928
01:54:40,166 --> 01:54:43,878
What Horatius said was,

929
01:54:44,045 --> 01:54:47,048
"How can a man die better

930
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:52,553
<i>"Than facing fearful odds"</i>

931
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:56,307
Drones!
Get inside! Get inside!

932
01:54:56,474 --> 01:54:58,142
<i>"For the ashes of his fathers</i>

933
01:55:01,187 --> 01:55:03,773
<i>"And the temples of his Gods"</i>

934
01:55:05,316 --> 01:55:07,443
<i>I created you, Jack.</i>

935
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:09,695
<i>I am your God.</i>

936
01:55:22,083 --> 01:55:23,751
Fuck you, Sally.

937
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:20,141
<i>Earth, after the war.</i>

938
01:56:20,808 --> 01:56:24,270
<i>Three years have passed
since I saw your face.</i>

939
01:56:25,896 --> 01:56:29,567
<i>I wonder if I come to
you at night, in dreams.</i>

940
01:56:30,442 --> 01:56:33,946
<i>In the day, as memories.</i>

941
01:56:35,197 --> 01:56:38,951
<i>Do I haunt your hours
the way you haunted mine?</i>

942
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:42,913
<i>And I wonder if you see me</i>

943
01:56:43,581 --> 01:56:45,249
<i>when you look at her.</i>

944
01:56:57,386 --> 01:56:59,305
Mommy, look.

945
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:09,148
<i>If we have souls, they are
made of the love we share.</i>

946
01:57:12,651 --> 01:57:14,987
<i>Undimmed by time.</i>

947
01:57:16,071 --> 01:57:18,407
<i>Unbound by death.</i>

948
01:57:36,091 --> 01:57:39,637
<i>For three years, I searched
for the house he built.</i>

949
01:57:41,513 --> 01:57:42,932
<i>I knew it had to be out there.</i>

950
01:57:46,769 --> 01:57:49,146
<i>Because I know him.</i>

951
01:57:56,904 --> 01:57:58,906
<i>I am him.</i>

952
01:58:01,158 --> 01:58:02,326
Who's that?

953
01:58:10,626 --> 01:58:13,087
<i>I am Jack Harper.</i>

954
01:58:14,505 --> 01:58:17,174
<i>And I am home.</i>
