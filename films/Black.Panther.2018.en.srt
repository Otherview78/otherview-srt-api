00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:06,883
Baba...

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,259
<i>Yes, my son.</i>

3
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:09,844
<i>Tell me a story.</i>

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,096
<i>Which one?</i>

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,348
<i>The story of home.</i>

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,102
<i>Millions of years ago...</i>

7
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,855
<i>a meteorite
made of vibranium...</i>

8
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:23,357
<i>the strongest substance
in the universe...</i>

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,443
<i>struck the continent
of Africa...</i>

10
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:30,489
<i>affecting the plant life
around it.</i>

11
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,658
<i>And when
the time of man came...</i>

12
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:36,662
<i>five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.</i>

13
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,959
<i>The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...</i>

14
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:44,295
<i>until a warriors ha man...</i>

15
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:47,423
<i>received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...</i>

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,635
<i>who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...</i>

17
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:53,054
<i>a plant that granted him</i>

18
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:57,141
<i>superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.</i>

19
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:58,726
<i>The warrior became king...</i>

20
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,270
<i>and the first Black Panther...</i>

21
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:04,023
<i>the protector of Wakanda.</i>

22
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,026
<i>Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...</i>

23
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:11,530
<i>but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.</i>

24
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:15,326
<i>The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...</i>

25
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:18,746
<i>more advanced
than any other nation.</i>

26
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,581
<i>But as Wakanda thrived...</i>

27
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:24,168
<i>the world around it descended
further into chaos.</i>

28
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:29,548
<i>To keep vibranium safe...</i>

29
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,677
<i>the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...</i>

30
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,513
<i>keeping the truth
of their power</i>

31
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,598
<i>from the outside world.</i>

32
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,977
<i>And we still hide,</i> Baba?

33
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,020
<i>Yes.</i>

34
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:44,897
<i>Why?</i>

35
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,118
- Lucky shot!
- That ain't lucky!

36
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:58,619
Whatever!
Get outta here!

37
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,745
Check up.

38
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,998
Pick your man up! He open.

39
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,208
Where you at?

40
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,168
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

41
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,503
Pass! Pass!

42
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,796
- Got you, E.
- E, hurry up!

43
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,464
Watch me get this.

44
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:13,426
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.

45
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,510
Come on.

46
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,594
What you got?

47
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:16,679
You ain't got nothing.

48
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,723
Hey, look,
if we get in and out quick,

49
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:19,807
won't be no worries.

50
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,934
You in the van,
come in through from the west.

51
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:23,269
Come around the corner.

52
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,520
- Land right here.
- Mmm-hmm.

53
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,314
Me and the twins
are pulling up right here.

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,649
We're leaving this car behind,
okay? We come this...

55
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:34,030
Hide the straps.

56
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,373
Yo, is it the Feds?

57
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,377
No.

58
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:03,309
It's these two
Grace Jones-looking chicks.

59
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,019
They're holding spears.

60
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:06,604
Open it.

61
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:08,481
You serious?

62
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:11,192
They won't knock again.

63
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,044
Who are you?

64
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,254
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.

65
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:36,467
Prove to me you are one of us.

66
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,267
My King.

67
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,271
Leave us.

68
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,441
This is James. I trust him
with my life. He stays...

69
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,735
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.

70
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,321
As you wish.

71
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,614
At ease.

72
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,168
Come, baby brother.

73
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,045
Let me see
how you are holding up.

74
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,222
You look strong.

75
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,307
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.

76
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,392
How is home?

77
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,688
Not so good.

78
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,648
Baby brother.

79
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,191
There has been an attack.

80
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,818
This man...

81
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:38,904
Ulysses Klaue...

82
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,324
stole a quarter ton of
vibranium from us...

83
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,743
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.

84
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,539
Many lives were lost.

85
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,917
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...

86
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,627
and how to strike.

87
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,714
He had someone on the inside.

88
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,883
Why are you here?

89
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,344
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...

90
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,431
and tell me
why you betrayed Wakanda.

91
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:08,225
I did no such thing.

92
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,188
Tell him who you are.

93
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,690
Zuri, son of Badu...

94
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:15,858
What?

95
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,074
James. James, you lied to me?

96
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,159
Leave him.

97
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,243
You were Wakandan
this whole time?

98
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:27,328
You betrayed Wakanda!

99
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,412
How could you lie
to me like...

100
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,456
Stand down.

101
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:37,338
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?

102
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,560
Prince N'Jobu...

103
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,354
you will return home
at once...

104
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,397
where you will face
the Council...

105
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,234
and inform them
of your crimes.

106
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,696
Check up!

107
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,408
Guard your man,
guard your man!

108
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,702
Yo.

My Prince...

127
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,330
coming up on them now.

128
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,772
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.

129
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,024
Hmm.

130
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,947
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.

131
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,204
Just don't freeze
when you see her.

132
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:16,914
What are you talking about?

133
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,708
I never freeze.

134
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:36,767
What's going on?

135
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,396
It's the car.
It lost power. It won't start.

136
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,690
The car no start.

137
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:44,108
What happened?

138
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,526
The engine failed.

139
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,195
Ours, too.

140
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,493
What is it, Captain?

141
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,421
Defense positions.

142
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,880
Defense positions.

143
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,382
Are we under attack?

144
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,967
Defense positions.

145
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,262
Get around to the side.

146
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,305
Defense positions.

147
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,643
Hey. Defense positions!

148
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,689
No games.

149
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,211
What do you see?

150
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,764
Come in. Come in.

151
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,265
Over there! Look back!

152
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,100
Watch out!

153
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,336
T'Challa, no!

154
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,755
This one's just a boy.

155
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,258
He got kidnapped as well.

- Hey!

159
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:46,480
I have her!
Don't move! I will shoot!

160
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,398
I will shoot her right now.

161
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,157
You froze.

162
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,159
Ah...

163
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,998
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.

164
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,377
My father is dead, Nakia.

165
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,548
I will be crowned king
tomorrow.

166
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,592
And I wish for you
to be there.

167
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,393
Carry yourselves home now.

168
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,477
Thank you.

169
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,062
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.

170
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,522
Thank you oh.

171
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,407
You will speak
nothing of this day.

172
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:39,908
Yes.

173
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:41,785
Thank you.

174
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:43,829
Thank you.

00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,574
Sister Nakia...

176
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,534
My Prince...

177
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:24,953
we are home.

178
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,866
This never gets old.

179
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,047
Queen Mother...

180
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:00,966
Princess...

181
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,051
My comfort for your loss.

182
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,261
Thank you, Nakia.

183
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:07,055
It is so good
to have you back with us.

184
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,307
Take her to
the River Province

185
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,600
to prepare her
for the ceremony.

186
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,935
Yes, General.

187
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,237
Did he freeze?

188
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,698
Like an antelope
in headlights.

189
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,325
Are you finished?

190
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,291
So surprised
my little sister came

191
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,293
to see me off
before our big day.

192
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,461
You wish!

193
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,297
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.

194
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,632
Update? No.
It worked perfectly.

195
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,259
How many times
do I have to teach you?

196
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,635
Just because something works

197
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,429
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.

198
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,765
You are teaching me?
What do you know?

199
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,059
More than you.

200
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,729
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...

201
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,814
to your ceremonial outfit.

202
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,400
Shuri!

203
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,194
Sorry, Mother!

204
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,030
How are you
feeling today, Mama?

205
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,573
Proud.

206
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,328
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.

207
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,873
He is with us...

208
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,085
and it is your time
to be king.

209
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,896
Good morning.

210
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,565
How can I help you?

211
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,609
I was just checking out
these artifacts.

212
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:43,860
They tell me
you're the expert.

213
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,238
Ah. You could say that.

214
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,074
They're beautiful.

215
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,702
Where's this one from?

216
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,329
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...

217
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,747
present day Ghana...

218
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:56,998
19th century.

219
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,166
For real?

220
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,169
What about this one?

221
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,965
That one's from the Edo people
of Benin...

222
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,008
16th century.

223
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,098
Now, tell me about this one.

224
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:17,060
Also from Benin,
seventh century.

225
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,229
Fula tribe, I believe.

226
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,773
Nah.

227
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,608
I beg your pardon?

228
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,652
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin

229
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,903
but it's from Wakanda.

230
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,572
And it's made
out of vibranium.

231
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,367
Don't trip.

232
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,910
I'mma take it
off your hands for you.

233
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,289
These items aren't for sale.

234
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,041
How do you think
your ancestors got these?

235
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,710
You think they paid
a fair price?

236
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:44,045
Or did they take it, like they
took everything else?

237
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,131
Sir, I'm going to have to

238
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,674
ask you to leave.

239
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,301
You got
all this security in here

240
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,886
watching me
ever since I walked in.

241
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,429
But you ain't checking for

242
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,556
what you put in your body.

243
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,891
All right, mate.
Let's have it.

244
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,517
Come on, mate. Time.

245
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,144
I think she might not
be feeling too good.

246
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,688
Somebody get some help!
Come here!

247
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,566
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!

248
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,775
Medical emergency
right away

249
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,235
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.

250
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,403
Look out.

251
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,114
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.

252
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,992
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.

253
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,494
I'm gonna take a break.

254
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,875
Let's give the lady
some space, please.

255
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,084
Step back,
please, gents.

256
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,461
Step back, please.

257
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,217
Hey, come here.

258
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,261
Come here. It's okay.

259
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,140
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?

260
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:44,814
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?

261
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:45,899
Because it's better to leave

262
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,025
the crime scene
more spread out.

263
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,903
Makes us look like amateurs.

264
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,879
Now then,
let's see if you know

265
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:09,547
what you're talking about.

266
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,431
That's just a taste.

267
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,158
- You're gonna be a rich boy.
- You better sell that quick.

268
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,952
It's already sold!

269
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,745
Whatever you try,

270
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:41,871
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.

271
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,415
That'll make my day.

272
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,791
I can kill two birds
with one stone.

273
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,254
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?

274
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,214
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

275
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,882
Onward!

276
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,342
Onward!

277
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:54,879
I, Zuri...

278
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,173
son of Badu...

279
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,092
give to you...

280
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,428
Prince T'Challa...

281
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,304
the Black Panther!

282
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,811
The prince...

283
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:14,607
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther...

284
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,026
stripped away.

285
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,852
Praise the ancestors.

286
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,312
Praise the ancestors.

287
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,483
Victory in ritual combat...

288
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,195
comes by yield or death.

289
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,907
If any tribe wishes to
put forth a warrior...

290
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,909
I now offer...

291
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:09,537
a path to the throne.

292
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:17,962
The Merchant Tribe
will not challenge today.

293
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:24,052
The Border Tribe
will not challenge today.

294
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:29,766
The River Tribe
will not challenge today.

295
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,729
The Mining Tribe
will not challenge today.

296
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,815
Is there any member
of a royal blood...

297
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,903
who wishes to challenge
for the throne?

298
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,493
This corset
is really uncomfortable...

299
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,913
so could we all just
wrap it up and go home?

300
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,581
Mother!

301
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,483
- Are they Jabari?
- Yes.

302
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,203
M'Baku, what are you
doing here?

303
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,332
It's challenge day.

304
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:43,172
We have watched...

305
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:46,301
and listened
from the mountains!

306
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,428
We have watched
with disgust...

307
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:51,389
as your
technological advancements

308
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,558
have been overseen by a child!

309
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,606
Who scoffs at tradition!

310
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:03,276
And now you want to
hand the nation

311
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,278
over to this prince...

312
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:11,409
who could not keep
his own father safe.

313
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:14,996
Mmm?

314
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,082
We will not have it.

315
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:22,337
I said,
we will not have it, oh!

316
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,006
I, M'Baku...

317
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,259
leader of the Jabari...

318
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:32,722
I accept your challenge,
M'Baku.

319
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,933
Glory to Hanuman.

320
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,204
Jabari!

321
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:57,914
Dora Milaje!

322
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,332
Onward!

323
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:09,258
Let the challenge begin!

324
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,854
Oh!

325
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:25,650
Stand up!

326
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,619
Come!

327
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,212
T'Challa!

328
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,885
Where is your god now?

329
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,814
Yes!

330
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:14,449
No powers.

331
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,242
No claws.

332
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,203
No special suit, oh!

333
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,415
Just a boy not fit to lead!

334
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:25,585
Show him who you are!

335
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,853
I am Prince T'Challa...

336
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,605
son of King T'Chaka!

337
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,398
You can do this, T'Challa!

338
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:02,205
Yes!

339
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:03,748
Come on!

340
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:06,083
Yield! Don't make me kill you.

341
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,835
I would rather die!

342
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,256
T'Challa!

343
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,467
T'Challa!

344
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:16,219
T'Challa!

345
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,221
T'Challa!

346
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,056
T'Challa!

347
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,265
You have fought with honor!

348
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:24,018
Now yield!
Your people need you.

349
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:25,186
T'Challa!

350
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:26,604
T'Challa!

351
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:27,855
Yield, man!

352
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:29,273
T'Challa!

353
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,691
T'Challa!

354
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:35,029
Yes! Yes!

355
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,178
I now present to you...

356
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,681
King T'Challa...

357
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:06,269
the Black Panther.

358
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,401
Zuri.

359
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,528
My King.

360
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,832
Wakanda forever!

361
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:30,084
Wakanda forever!

362
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,035
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

363
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:07,371
to restore the powers
of the Black Panther...

364
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,417
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

365
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,005
T'Chaka...

366
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:19,175
we call on you.

367
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:22,219
Come here to your son.

368
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:36,192
Praise the ancestors.

369
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,074
Father.

370
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:08,743
My son.

371
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:19,587
I'm sorry.

372
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:21,547
Stand up.

373
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,924
You are a king.

374
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,858
What is wrong my son?

375
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,611
I am not ready.

376
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,781
Have you not prepared

377
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:51,160
to be king your whole life?

378
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:54,872
Have you not trained
and studied,

379
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:57,875
been by my side?

380
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:02,296
That is not
what I am talking about.

381
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,428
I am not ready
to be without you.

382
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,599
A man who has not prepared
his children

383
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,226
for his own death...

384
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,561
has failed as a father.

385
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,272
Have I ever failed you?

386
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,316
Never.

387
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:30,574
Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.

388
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,287
I want to be
a great king, <i>Baba.</i>

389
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:38,249
Just like you.

390
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,835
You're going to struggle.

391
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,837
So you'll need to
surround yourself

392
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,630
with people you trust.

393
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:48,050
You're a good man
with a good heart.

394
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:51,554
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.

395
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,351
Breathe.

396
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,062
T'Challa, breathe.

397
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,232
Breathe.

398
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,776
He was there.

399
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,531
He was there. My father.

400
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,381
Just one?

401
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,056
Come home, Nakia.

402
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,474
I'm right here.

403
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,101
Stay.

404
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,272
I came to support you
and to honor your father...

405
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,815
but I can't stay.

406
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,819
I found my calling out there.

407
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,448
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.

408
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,450
I can't be happy here...

409
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:57,328
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.

410
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,373
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?

411
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,667
Share what we have.

412
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,336
We could provide aid...

413
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,503
and access to technology

414
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:07,796
and refuge
to those who need it.

415
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:10,424
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.

416
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:15,012
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.

417
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:18,098
If the world found out
what we truly are...

418
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,767
what we possess...

419
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:21,602
we could lose our way of life.

420
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,063
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others

421
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:25,981
and protect ourselves
at the same time.

422
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:30,694
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.

423
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:33,322
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.

424
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:36,992
- Ah! See, you admit it!
- If that's what I wanted.

425
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,751
Is that him?

426
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:51,006
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?

427
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:53,509
Of course.

428
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,345
I see Nakia is back.

429
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,014
You guys going to work it out?

430
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:06,480
T'Challa...

431
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:08,732
what's wrong?

432
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,484
Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.

433
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:11,652
More, like what?

434
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:14,071
Foreign aid, refugee programs.

435
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:16,073
You let the refugees in...

436
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,701
they bring their problems
with them.

437
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,161
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.

438
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:25,874
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...

439
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:28,544
to go out there
and clean up the world,

440
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,254
then I'll be all for it.

441
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:32,631
But waging war
on other countries

442
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:34,300
has never been our way.

443
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,055
You, too, huh?

444
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,890
Bast! We're in trouble.

445
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,020
<i>My King.</i>

446
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:47,938
<i>My love.</i>

447
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:51,567
<i>You will never guess who just
popped up on our radar.</i>

448
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,156
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...

449
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:59,992
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.

450
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:04,288
We have learned
Ulysses Klaue...

451
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:07,291
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...

452
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:08,792
in South Korea...

453
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,377
tomorrow night.

454
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:15,966
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.

455
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:20,387
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.

456
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:23,640
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.

457
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:28,437
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.

458
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:29,855
We need a king.

459
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:32,691
My parents were killed
when he attacked.

460
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:35,569
Not a day goes by
when I do not think

461
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,738
about what Klaue took from us.

462
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:40,366
From me.

463
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,452
It's too great
an opportunity to pass.

464
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:44,745
Take me with you.

465
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,830
We'll take him down together,
side by side.

466
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:50,042
I need you here
protecting the border.

467
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:51,460
Then I ask...

468
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,754
you kill him
where he stands...

469
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,006
or you bring him back to us.

470
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:58,300
You have my word.

471
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,179
I will bring him back.

472
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,682
We will proceed
with the mission.

473
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:52,729
My King!

474
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,648
Stop it. Stop it.

475
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,820
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.

476
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:02,322
Who are you taking with you
to Korea?

477
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,824
Okoye.

478
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,410
And Nakia as well.

479
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:12,040
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?

480
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,584
Yes.

481
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,794
We'll be fine.

482
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:17,796
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.

483
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,131
Yes!

484
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:21,675
I have great things
to show you, Brother.

485
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:24,219
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.

486
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,722
Unlimited range,

487
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,558
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.

488
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,059
Check these out.

489
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:35,397
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.

490
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:38,358
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.

491
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,068
Ah.

492
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,196
And what are these?

493
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:45,282
The real question is
what are those?

494
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,910
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?

495
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,078
What, you don't like
my royal sandals?

496
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,040
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.

497
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:55,125
I bet the eiders loved that.

498
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,377
Try them on.

499
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:02,508
Fully automated.

500
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:05,177
Like the old American movie
<i>Baba</i> used to watch.

501
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,261
Mmm.

502
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:08,514
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.

503
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:11,683
Interesting.

504
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,602
Guess what I call them.

505
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,145
Sneakers.

506
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,106
Because you...

507
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,441
Never mind.

508
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,319
If you're going to take
on Klaue...

509
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:26,657
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.

510
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:27,950
Exhibit A.

511
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,660
- My design.
- Old tech.

512
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,079
- Old?
- Functional, but old.

513
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:33,914
"Hey, people are shooting
at me.

514
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,958
"Wait, let me put on
my helmet."

515
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,709
Enough.

516
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:40,754
Now, look at these.

517
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:44,716
Do you like that one?

518
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,176
Tempting.

519
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,388
But the idea
is to not be noticed.

520
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,224
This one.

521
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:00,941
Now tell it to go on.

522
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,489
Ooh!

523
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:11,702
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.

524
00:40:12,578 --> 00:40:13,996
Strike it.

525
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,164
- Anywhere?
- Mmm-hmm.

526
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,295
Not that hard, genius!

527
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,672
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.

528
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,132
I invite you to my lab,

529
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,675
and you just
kick things around?

530
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:29,553
Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.

531
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,679
Hey.

532
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,306
Wait a minute.

533
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:35,183
The nanites
absorb the kinetic energy...

534
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,769
and hold it in place
for redistribution.

535
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,271
Very nice.

536
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:42,107
Strike it again
in the same spot.

537
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,278
You're recording?

538
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:48,614
For research purposes.

539
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,247
Delete that footage.

540
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,852
This way.

541
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,482
Bast willing,
this will go quickly...

542
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:26,652
and I can get this ridiculous
thing off my head.

543
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:30,030
It looks nice.
Just whip it back and forth.

544
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:32,866
What? It's a disgrace.

545
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,495
Hello Sophia.

546
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:38,997
Good to see you.

547
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,875
Who are these two?

548
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,086
My friends from Kenya.

549
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,630
Very deep pockets.
They're good.

550
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,508
Good for trouble...

551
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,259
...like you?

552
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:01,561
Thank you!

553
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:25,669
Spread out.

554
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:28,213
The buyer
is likely already here.

555
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,816
The woman outside.

556
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:50,944
What trouble
was she referring to?

557
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,822
Ah... I got into
a disagreement

558
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,741
with some ivory traders.

559
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,951
- Made a bit of a mess.
- Hmm.

560
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:00,203
And will there be
any trouble tonight,

561
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:02,205
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?

562
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:03,540
Depends...

563
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:05,917
on how quickly we finish
the mission.

564
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,919
<i>Can we please focus?</i>

565
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:10,964
Thank you.

566
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:13,592
Over here.

567
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:16,136
One whiskey, please.

568
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:29,566
Eyes up. Americans.

569
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:34,362
I count three.

570
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:37,741
Five.

571
00:43:37,908 --> 00:43:39,242
How could you miss
Greased Lightning

572
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:40,577
there behind you?

573
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:41,870
Six.

574
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:45,457
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.

575
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:48,210
It just got
a little more complicated.

576
00:43:51,505 --> 00:43:52,631
Agent Ross.

577
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:53,924
Your Highness.

578
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,009
You are buying from Klaue.

579
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,721
What I'm doing or not doing...

580
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:01,306
on behalf of
the U.S. government

581
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,599
is none of your concern.

582
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:04,434
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...

583
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,686
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.

584
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,146
I gave you Zemo.

585
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:09,689
Didn't I keep it
under wraps...

586
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,483
that the king of
a third world country

587
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,527
runs around
in a bulletproof cat suit?

588
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,070
I'd say we were even.

589
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:16,822
You really need to leave, now.

590
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:20,784
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.

591
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,495
You've been warned.

592
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,456
Three, craps.

593
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:28,333
Hey, you won!

594
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,169
You know what?

595
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,338
I think
I'll just take these...

596
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:35,215
bring them over here

597
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,634
- and hold on for safekeeping.
- Mmm-hmm.

598
00:44:40,262 --> 00:44:43,348
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.

599
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:45,225
He cannot leave with Klaue.

600
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:47,769
All right.

601
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,312
Vibranium from the attack
on Sokovia

602
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:50,397
links back to a person...

603
00:44:50,564 --> 00:44:51,690
that I'm not actually saying

604
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:52,774
I'm here to make
a deal with...

605
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:55,318
but that deal
will not be called off.

606
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:56,736
When the dust settles,

607
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,363
you and me can work
something out.

608
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,407
I'm not here to make a deal.

609
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:29,311
Klaue, plus eight!

610
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:30,645
General.

611
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,689
In position
to secure our exit.

612
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:33,857
And the vibranium?

613
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,650
I don't see it yet.

614
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:38,403
<i>I thought there were
no weapons allowed in here.</i>

615
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,322
There's not supposed to be.

616
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,866
Somebody did not get the memo.

617
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,368
Definitely armed.

618
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,079
Well, that is quite
the entourage.

619
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,414
You got a mix tape coming out?

620
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:52,208
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, actually, there is one.

621
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,252
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.

622
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,712
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?

623
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:57,464
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.

624
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,382
I just meant you got a lot of
people with you.

625
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,968
You think they're for you?

626
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,262
Don't worry.

627
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,306
I can do a deal with you
all by myself,

628
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:07,557
thank you very much.

629
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,484
<i>Six more. It's a setup.</i>

630
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:19,736
You got the diamonds?

631
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,197
Okay. That's enough.

632
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:26,701
- We need to move on Klaue.
<i>- Stand down.</i>

633
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,787
We can't afford a shootout.

634
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:29,955
Vibranium?

635
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,383
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...

636
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,052
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.

637
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:46,137
It's now or never.

638
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,430
Stand down!

639
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:48,723
Hey!

640
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:04,030
Wakandans! They're here!

641
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:08,076
- Get outta here!
- Kill 'em all!

642
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:11,329
Diamonds, quick!

643
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,095
Murderer!

644
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,979
You know, you look just like
your old man.

645
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:29,866
I made it rain!

646
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,659
Let's get out of here, boss!

647
00:48:35,497 --> 00:48:38,374
That was awesome!
That was awesome!

648
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,086
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

649
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:45,423
- Do we just leave him?
- He'll catch up.

650
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:54,808
Shuri!

651
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,395
Yes!

652
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,981
<i>Remote
driving system activated.</i>

653
00:49:02,816 --> 00:49:04,526
Wait! Which side of
the road is it?

654
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:05,735
<i>For Bast's sake!</i>

655
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:07,237
- <i>Just drive!</i>
- Okay, calm down!

656
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:17,205
Whoo! Let's go!

657
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:19,582
Put some music on. What do you
think this is, a funeral?

658
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:24,671
Which one is he in now?

659
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:28,299
Hey, split up!

660
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:31,636
- They're trying to lose us.
- I'll take the right.

661
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:36,474
We'll take the other two!
I see a shortcut.

662
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:53,783
We're not going to make it!

663
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:56,536
Keep going!

664
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,627
Whoo! Brother!

665
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:15,597
Hey, what was that?

666
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,765
Don't worry
about it. You're doing great.

667
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:30,320
Guns.

668
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:32,864
So primitive!

669
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:34,866
It's a vibranium car,
you idiots!

670
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,117
The bullets won't penetrate!

671
00:50:38,328 --> 00:50:39,370
What are you doing?

672
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,747
Just drive.

673
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,806
- Whoo!
- Shit!

674
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:13,821
Hey, look at your suit.

675
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,114
You've been taking bullets,

676
00:51:15,198 --> 00:51:17,075
charging it up
with kinetic energy.

677
00:51:18,952 --> 00:51:20,161
Pull around the truck.

678
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,209
Where'd he go?

679
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:36,928
You show-off.

680
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:39,180
There he is!

681
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,600
Hold tight!

682
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:47,563
All right.
Let's have some fun!

683
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:16,926
Hop in.

684
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:19,804
Put that spear in the trunk.

685
00:52:25,018 --> 00:52:26,144
Faster, Shuri.

686
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:27,937
I'm going as fast as I can!

687
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:30,815
Take a right! Take a right!

688
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:36,612
No, no, no!

689
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:40,074
Brother!

690
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:04,599
Klaue!

691
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:08,353
Did you think we would forget?

692
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,364
Look at me, murderer!

693
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,783
Where did you get this weapon?

694
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:24,619
You savages didn't deserve it.

695
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:30,750
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.

696
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:33,044
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.

The world watches.

699
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,050
Come on. Guys.
Let's go, huh?

700
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:45,807
Yeah.

701
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:01,781
Hello.

702
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:07,453
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.

703
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,380
So this is a big mess, huh?

704
00:54:17,547 --> 00:54:19,757
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.

705
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,217
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.

706
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:25,179
We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.

707
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:31,227
Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes

708
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,230
than to make a scene here.

709
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:36,732
After your questioning,

710
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:38,734
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.

711
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,446
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.

712
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:44,407
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.

713
00:54:44,574 --> 00:54:46,242
Listen, I'm doing you guys
a favor

714
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:47,910
by letting you
even be in here.

715
00:54:51,247 --> 00:54:52,748
If he touches you again,

716
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:55,668
I'm going to impale him
to this desk.

717
00:54:56,586 --> 00:54:57,920
Does she speak English?

718
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:00,006
When she wants to.

719
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,883
Huh.

720
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,009
I'm going in.

721
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:05,261
When I'm done,
you guys are up.

722
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:07,180
- Agent Ross.
- Yeah?

723
00:55:07,722 --> 00:55:10,641
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.

724
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:12,393
You see that?

725
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:14,145
It's called diplomacy.

726
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:16,272
You're welcome.

00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:38,461
I'm much more your speed.

734
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:40,463
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.

735
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:43,132
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.

736
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:44,467
Where'd you get that?

737
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:46,344
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.

738
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:48,888
But I can get you one,
if you like.

739
00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:50,890
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier,

740
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,016
and I'll ask them.

741
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:53,643
He's right outside.

742
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,394
Why don't you
ask him yourself?

743
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,063
What? T'Challa?

744
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:00,566
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?

745
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:01,734
Bingo.

746
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:06,072
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?

747
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:07,490
Um...

748
00:56:08,658 --> 00:56:10,743
Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.

749
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,203
<i>It's all a front.</i>

750
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:15,414
<i>Explorers searched for it
for centuries.</i>

751
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,042
<i>El Dorado, the Golden City.</i>

752
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:20,545
<i>They thought they could
find it in South America...</i>

753
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:23,589
but it was in Africa
the whole time.

754
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:25,550
A technological marvel.

755
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,135
All because it was built
on a mound

756
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:30,263
of the most valuable metal
known to man.

757
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,516
<i>Isipho,</i> they call it.
The gift.

758
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,226
Vibranium.

759
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:37,562
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.

760
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:38,938
It's not just a metal.

761
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:41,649
They sew it
into their clothes.

762
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:44,610
It powers their city,
their tech...

763
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:46,028
their weapons.

764
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:47,780
Weapons?

765
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:48,948
Yeah.

766
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,450
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.

767
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:52,910
That's a nice fairy tale,

768
00:56:52,994 --> 00:56:54,912
but Wakanda is
a third world country...

769
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,540
and you stole
all their vibranium.

770
00:56:57,707 --> 00:56:59,000
I stole...

771
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:03,629
All of it?

772
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,508
I took a tiny piece of it.

773
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:09,385
They have
a mountain full of it.

774
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:11,762
<i>They've been mining it
for thousands of years...</i>

775
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,181
<i>and they still haven't
scratched the surface.</i>

776
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,309
<i>I'm the only outsider
who's seen it</i>

777
00:57:16,392 --> 00:57:17,977
<i>and got out of there alive.</i>

778
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:19,812
<i>If you don't believe me,</i>

779
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:23,149
<i>you ask your friend
what his suit is made of</i>

780
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,068
What his claws are made of.

781
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:50,760
Your father told the UN...

782
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,846
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.

783
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:55,556
But now he's telling me
you have more.

784
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:57,141
And you believe the word

785
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,727
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?

786
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,622
Where is that?

787
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,375
Back there.

788
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:35,513
How much more are you hiding?

789
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:38,849
Something is happening
out back.

790
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:46,107
Get down!

791
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:52,029
Stand down!

792
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:56,575
Cover!

793
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:57,702
Grenade!

794
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,582
I see you took your time,
didn't you?

795
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:24,562
My King!

796
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:29,024
My King.

797
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,317
Nakia.

798
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,864
He just jumped in front of me.

799
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,368
I don't think
he'll make it here.

800
00:59:39,452 --> 00:59:40,828
It hit his spine.

801
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:45,166
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.

802
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,422
This will stabilize him
for now.

803
00:59:59,472 --> 01:00:00,973
Give him to us.

804
01:00:01,891 --> 01:00:03,392
We can save him.

805
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:14,820
Our mission
was to bring back Klaue.

806
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,281
We failed.

807
01:00:17,573 --> 01:00:20,659
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.

808
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,370
How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?

809
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:24,789
He took a bullet for me.

810
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,665
That was his choice.

811
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,376
So now we are just supposed to
let him die?

812
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,378
Let us consider
that we heal him.

813
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:34,799
It is his duty to report back
to his country.

814
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:37,635
And as king, it is your duty
to protect ours.

815
01:00:37,802 --> 01:00:40,221
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.

816
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:44,016
I cannot just let him die...

817
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,228
knowing we can save him.

818
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,814
Where exactly
are we taking him?

819
01:00:57,446 --> 01:01:00,241
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.

820
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,368
This is going to be fun.

821
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:10,709
He will live.

822
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:16,340
W'Kabi is here.

823
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:27,977
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?

824
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:30,020
He's not here.

825
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:36,110
He slipped through our hands.

826
01:01:37,695 --> 01:01:38,904
"Slipped"?

827
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:44,660
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.

828
01:01:44,827 --> 01:01:47,037
With you,
I thought it'd be different.

829
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,915
But it's more of the same.

830
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:11,437
Let's get going, boss.

831
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,815
You always sell to the CIA?

832
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:16,901
I sell to the highest bidder.

833
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,194
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...

834
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,654
and I lay low for a bit,

835
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:22,156
I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.

836
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:24,033
Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.

837
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:25,117
I know you good for it.

838
01:02:25,284 --> 01:02:27,870
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.

839
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:28,954
You don't want to
go there, boy.

840
01:02:29,038 --> 01:02:30,039
Yeah, I do.

841
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,001
Drop it!

842
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,629
Or your little
Bonnie and Clyde routine

843
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:38,005
ends today.

844
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:39,548
Put your gun down now!

845
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:41,300
I'm sorry.

846
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:43,719
- Sorry, Erik.
- It's gonna be okay.

847
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:14,625
You really want to go
to Wakanda?

848
01:03:15,668 --> 01:03:17,127
They're savages.

849
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,215
This is what they do
to people like us.

850
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:22,549
I ain't worried
about no brand.

851
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:24,176
Check these out.

852
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:26,887
Each one is for a kill.

853
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:30,057
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.

854
01:03:30,224 --> 01:03:33,018
To them,
you'll just be an outsider.

855
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:35,479
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.

856
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:45,322
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.

857
01:03:59,628 --> 01:04:00,921
Leave us!

858
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:15,352
So your mission did not go
as planned.

859
01:04:16,437 --> 01:04:20,107
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?

860
01:04:20,816 --> 01:04:23,610
My father told me
he disappeared.

861
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:26,155
There was a man today...

862
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:31,035
wearing a ring
identical to this one.

863
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:34,580
That is not possible.

864
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,459
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!

865
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,878
My grandfather's ring!

866
01:04:41,045 --> 01:04:42,588
Do not tell me
what is possible.

867
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:43,714
Tell me the truth!

868
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,012
Some truths...

869
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:56,477
are too much to bear,
T'Challa.

870
01:04:57,478 --> 01:04:59,980
That is not your choice
to make.

871
01:05:00,856 --> 01:05:01,857
What happened to him?

872
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,484
I promised the king
to say nothing.

873
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,486
I am your king now!

874
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:23,420
Your uncle took...

875
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:28,592
a War Dog assignment
in America.

876
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:32,596
Your father...

877
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,099
placed me there...

878
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:36,975
<i>to observe...</i>

879
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,646
unbeknownst to him.

880
01:05:40,813 --> 01:05:43,732
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.

881
01:05:44,316 --> 01:05:45,526
They had a child.

882
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:49,279
The hardships he saw there...

883
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:52,741
radicalized your uncle.

884
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:55,119
I observed
for as long as I could.

885
01:05:56,328 --> 01:05:57,955
Their leaders
have been assassinated.

886
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:00,541
Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.

887
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:03,085
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.

888
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:05,295
All over the planet...

889
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,755
our people suffer because

890
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:08,841
they don't have the tools
to fight back.

891
01:06:09,842 --> 01:06:11,135
With vibranium weapons,

892
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:12,803
they could overthrow
every country...

893
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,763
and Wakanda could
rule them all

894
01:06:14,847 --> 01:06:16,140
the right way.

895
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:19,852
He knew your father
would not support this.

896
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:23,814
So, your uncle betrayed us.

897
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:25,190
No!

898
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:28,610
<i>He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.</i>

899
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:31,572
No, no, no.

900
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,323
You will return home
at once...

901
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,325
where you will face
the Council...

902
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:38,453
and inform them
of your crimes.

903
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,330
<i>He drew his weapon
on me.</i>

904
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:42,749
No!

905
01:06:57,848 --> 01:07:01,602
<i>Your father
killed his own brother...</i>

906
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:05,647
to save my life.

907
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,654
Speak nothing of this.

908
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,327
And the child?

909
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:23,707
We left him.

910
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:33,300
We had to...

911
01:07:34,426 --> 01:07:35,594
maintain...

912
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:38,347
the lie.

913
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,249
What is this?

914
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:07,292
Just a little gift.

915
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,317
Who are you?

916
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,201
All right, where am I?

917
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:25,996
Don't scare me like that,
colonizer!

918
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:28,332
What?
My name is Everett.

919
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:31,626
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...

920
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:34,588
former air force pilot
and now CIA.

921
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,131
Right.

922
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:42,262
Okay, is this Wakanda?

923
01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:44,056
No, it's Kansas.

924
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,894
How long ago was Korea?

925
01:09:49,061 --> 01:09:50,187
Yesterday.

926
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:51,355
I don't think so.

927
01:09:51,438 --> 01:09:53,732
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.

928
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:56,026
They do here.

929
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:59,446
But not by magic,
by technology.

930
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:07,079
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.

931
01:10:30,811 --> 01:10:33,271
These train things...

932
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,690
that's magnetic levitation,
right?

933
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:36,900
Obviously.

934
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:41,321
Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.

935
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:45,075
The light panels,
what are they?

936
01:10:45,534 --> 01:10:47,744
<i>-Sonic stabilizers.
- Sonic what?</i>

937
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,413
In its raw form...

938
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,206
vibranium is too dangerous

939
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,041
to be transported
at that speed...

940
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:56,294
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.

941
01:10:57,421 --> 01:10:58,922
<i>There's vibranium
on those trains?</i>

942
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:01,299
There's vibranium
all around us.

943
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:04,636
That's how I healed you.

944
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,187
<i>Where is T'Challa?</i>

945
01:11:14,354 --> 01:11:16,356
<i>His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off</i>

946
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:18,775
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.

947
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,235
<i>A man showed up at the border</i>

948
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:21,611
<i>who claims
to have killed Klaue.</i>

949
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:22,779
What?

950
01:11:22,863 --> 01:11:25,407
<i>W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.</i>

951
01:11:25,574 --> 01:11:27,409
<i>We need to find your brother!</i>

952
01:11:27,576 --> 01:11:28,577
An outsider?

953
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:30,370
<i>No, a Wakandan.</i>

954
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:31,955
He's not a Wakandan.

955
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:35,792
He's one of ours.

956
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,849
He killed his own brother...

957
01:11:51,016 --> 01:11:53,185
and left a child behind...

958
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:54,603
with nothing.

959
01:11:56,563 --> 01:11:58,190
What kind of king...

960
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:02,277
What kind of man does that?

961
01:12:02,444 --> 01:12:04,654
No man is perfect.

962
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,865
Not even your father.

963
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:09,743
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.

964
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:14,706
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...

965
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:18,168
he may have created something
even worse.

966
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:19,586
Hey.

967
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:22,589
Look at me.

968
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:29,721
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.

969
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:35,977
You get to decide what kind of
king you are going to be.

970
01:12:42,067 --> 01:12:44,653
<i>Brother, you need to
get here now!</i>

971
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,363
Erik Stevens.

972
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:49,032
Graduated Annapolis age 19...

973
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:51,117
MIT for grad school.

974
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:53,453
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...

975
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:55,038
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,

976
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:56,206
like it was a video game.

977
01:12:56,665 --> 01:12:58,416
Started calling him
Killmonger.

978
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:01,253
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.

979
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:02,837
They will drop off the grid...

980
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,256
so they can
commit assassinations

981
01:13:04,339 --> 01:13:05,465
and take down governments.

982
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:09,678
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?

983
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,513
He has
a War Dog tattoo...

984
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:14,766
but we have no record of him.

985
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:23,316
Is this man Wakandan or not?

986
01:13:24,568 --> 01:13:26,361
Tell us what is going on.

987
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:46,840
Speak.

988
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:48,258
Speak.

989
01:13:50,218 --> 01:13:52,470
I'm standing in your house...

990
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,014
serving justice to a man

991
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:56,391
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.

992
01:13:57,225 --> 01:13:58,518
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.

993
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:06,610
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.

994
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,112
Only reason I don't kill you
where you stand

995
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,239
is because I know who you are.

996
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:14,200
Now, what do you want?

997
01:14:15,744 --> 01:14:17,454
I want the throne.

998
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,165
My goodness.

999
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:24,961
Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.

1000
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:27,088
Must feel good.

1001
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,299
It's about two billion people

1002
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:31,009
all over the world
that looks like us.

1003
01:14:31,593 --> 01:14:33,553
But their lives
are a lot harder.

1004
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,014
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.

1005
01:14:36,181 --> 01:14:38,391
And what tools are those?

1006
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,645
Vibranium. Your weapons.

1007
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:45,440
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.

1008
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:49,361
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...

1009
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,363
for people
who are not our own.

1010
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:53,406
Not your own?

1011
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:56,034
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?

1012
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:57,619
So ain't all people
your people?

1013
01:14:57,786 --> 01:15:01,414
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.

1014
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:04,167
And it is my responsibility

1015
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,127
to make sure
our people are safe...

1016
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:08,505
and that vibranium
does not fall

1017
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:10,382
into the hands
of a person like you.

1018
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:11,549
- Mmm...
- Son.

1019
01:15:12,092 --> 01:15:14,427
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.

1020
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:16,346
Reject his request.

1021
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:19,015
Oh, I ain't
requesting nothing.

1022
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:21,851
- Ask who I am.
- You're Erik Stevens.

1023
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:24,688
An American black operative.

1024
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,564
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.

1025
01:15:26,648 --> 01:15:27,649
That's who you are.

1026
01:15:27,816 --> 01:15:29,359
That's not my name, Princess.

1027
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,111
Ask me, King.

1028
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:32,445
No.

1029
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:34,698
Ask me.

1030
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,451
Take him away.

1031
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:40,912
Who are you?

1032
01:15:41,121 --> 01:15:45,375
I am N'Jadaka,
son of Prince N'Jobu.

1033
01:15:46,501 --> 01:15:47,544
Son of N'Jobu?

1034
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:48,670
I found my daddy

1035
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:49,796
with Panther claws
in his chest!

1036
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,965
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.

1037
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:53,258
You're lying!

1038
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:55,385
- Lies!
- I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.

1039
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:58,972
What?

1040
01:16:01,433 --> 01:16:02,600
The descendent of N'Jobu.

1041
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,310
Hey, Auntie.

1042
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:09,733
I'm exercising my blood right

1043
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:11,484
to challenge
for the mantles of king...

1044
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:13,236
and Black Panther.

1045
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:19,325
Do not do this, T'Challa.

1046
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,661
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,

1047
01:16:21,745 --> 01:16:23,371
he is within his rights.

1048
01:16:23,538 --> 01:16:24,831
He has no rights here!

1049
01:16:24,998 --> 01:16:27,083
The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.

1050
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:30,462
Weeks? I don't need weeks.

1051
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,881
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.

1052
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:35,216
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.

1053
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:42,140
T'Challa,
what do you know of this?

1054
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:45,894
I accept your challenge.

1055
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:05,413
He'll never beat T'Challa.

1056
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,665
He should've just come
to the first challenge

1057
01:17:07,749 --> 01:17:09,501
and gotten it over with.

1058
01:17:15,507 --> 01:17:17,884
The king
will now have the strength

1059
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,720
of the Black Panther
stripped away.

1060
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,003
Where is Agent Ross?

1061
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,923
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.

1062
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:03,304
This is your last chance.

1063
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:07,141
Throw down your weapons,

1064
01:18:07,225 --> 01:18:09,853
and we can handle this
another way.

1065
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:21,197
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.

1066
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:25,076
I trained, I lied, I killed...

1067
01:18:25,243 --> 01:18:26,953
just to get here.

1068
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:31,332
I killed in America,
Afghanistan...

1069
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:34,252
Iraq.

1070
01:18:35,837 --> 01:18:37,714
I took life from
my own brothers and sisters

1071
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:38,965
right here on this continent.

1072
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:43,094
And all this death...

1073
01:18:44,304 --> 01:18:46,681
just so I could kill you.

1074
01:18:54,314 --> 01:18:57,525
Let the challenge begin.

1075
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,106
Yield!

1076
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:00,213
Snap out of it, T'Challa!

1077
01:20:20,608 --> 01:20:21,609
Come on, get up.

1078
01:20:22,944 --> 01:20:23,945
Come here.

1079
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:28,950
This is for my father.

1080
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:31,703
Erik!

1081
01:20:32,412 --> 01:20:34,122
- Zuri, no.
- Stop!

1082
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:35,707
- Zuri!
- Zuri, don't!

1083
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,875
I am the cause of
your father's death.

1084
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,252
Not him.

1085
01:20:39,794 --> 01:20:40,962
Take me.

1086
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:43,881
I'll take you both,
Uncle James.

1087
01:20:44,799 --> 01:20:46,384
No!

1088
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:48,928
No! No!

1089
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:51,639
Zuri, no!

1090
01:20:52,974 --> 01:20:53,975
No!

1091
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:57,812
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!

1092
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:00,148
No! No!

1093
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,653
Is this your king? Huh?

1094
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:09,198
Is this your king?

1095
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:17,040
The Black Panther,

1096
01:21:17,123 --> 01:21:18,916
who's supposed to
lead you into the future?

1097
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,585
Come on, Brother!

1098
01:21:20,752 --> 01:21:22,045
Is there nothing
that can be done?

1099
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:25,548
Him?

1100
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:27,675
He's supposed to protect you?

1101
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,689
- No.
- No!

1102
01:21:49,197 --> 01:21:51,115
No!

1103
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:56,704
Nah. I'm your king.

1104
01:21:56,871 --> 01:21:58,539
- No! No!
- We have to go now!

1105
01:21:58,706 --> 01:22:00,792
Queen Mother, let's go!

1106
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:38,329
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?

1107
01:22:38,496 --> 01:22:40,164
Yes.

1108
01:22:40,248 --> 01:22:41,624
Thank you.

1109
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:44,168
We should get
to them immediately.

1110
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:46,212
I cannot.

1111
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:46,963
What?

1112
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,548
Though my heart is with you.

1113
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:52,260
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man

1114
01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:54,053
who showed up here
only hours ago.

1115
01:22:54,137 --> 01:22:55,138
He is of royal blood.

1116
01:22:55,263 --> 01:22:57,557
- He killed T'Challa!
- In ritual combat.

1117
01:22:57,723 --> 01:22:59,559
Does that really matter?

1118
01:23:02,228 --> 01:23:05,148
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.

1119
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:09,318
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.

1120
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:10,611
Overthrow?

1121
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:12,655
Nakia!

1122
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:16,868
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!

1123
01:23:18,619 --> 01:23:23,082
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.

1124
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:25,418
What are you loyal to?

1125
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,298
I loved him.

1126
01:23:31,716 --> 01:23:34,010
I loved my country, too.

1127
01:23:34,177 --> 01:23:36,220
Then you serve your country.

1128
01:23:36,387 --> 01:23:39,557
No. I save my country.

1129
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,650
What's wrong?

1130
01:23:49,984 --> 01:23:51,402
The king is dead.

1131
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,697
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.

1132
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:16,010
First <i>Baba.</i>

1133
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,096
And now my brother.

1134
01:24:21,933 --> 01:24:24,769
Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.

1135
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:35,029
- It's me.
- Nakia. Who is this man?

1136
01:24:35,196 --> 01:24:37,031
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.

1137
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:39,242
Where's Okoye?

1138
01:24:39,325 --> 01:24:40,409
Okoye is not coming.

1139
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,329
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.

1140
01:24:49,252 --> 01:24:50,586
Wait here.

1141
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:56,968
What has happened
to our Wakanda?

1142
01:24:59,345 --> 01:25:01,472
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

1143
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:04,600
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...

1144
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:07,561
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

1145
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:45,534
What did I tell you
about going into my things?

1146
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:46,911
Hmm?

1147
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:55,127
What did you find?

1148
01:26:56,045 --> 01:26:57,463
Your home.

1149
01:26:59,799 --> 01:27:02,802
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.

1150
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,847
Yes. The sunsets there

1151
01:27:06,931 --> 01:27:08,724
are the most beautiful
in the world.

1152
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:13,145
But I fear you still may not
be welcome.

1153
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:16,899
Why?

1154
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:20,736
They will say you are lost.

1155
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:22,988
But I'm right here.

1156
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:29,745
No tears for me?

1157
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,292
Everybody dies.

1158
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:39,088
It's just life around here.

1159
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:45,386
Well, look at what
I have done.

1160
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:49,473
I should've taken you back
long ago.

1161
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:54,728
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.

1162
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:02,445
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.

1163
01:28:04,447 --> 01:28:06,866
That's why they can't find us.

1164
01:28:13,873 --> 01:28:16,292
Breathe!
Breathe, My King, breathe.

1165
01:28:16,459 --> 01:28:18,836
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1166
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:37,438
The Heart-Shaped Herb
did that?

1167
01:28:40,483 --> 01:28:41,525
This all of it?

1168
01:28:41,692 --> 01:28:43,569
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,

1169
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:44,778
we will be ready.

1170
01:28:45,446 --> 01:28:46,697
Another king?

1171
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,951
Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.

1172
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:53,704
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...

1173
01:28:57,374 --> 01:29:00,336
When I tell you to do
something, I mean that shit.

1174
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,799
Burn it all!

1175
01:29:54,932 --> 01:29:56,433
You know, where I'm from...

1176
01:29:57,393 --> 01:29:59,520
when black folks
started revolutions,

1177
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:01,355
they never had
the firepower...

1178
01:30:01,522 --> 01:30:03,607
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.

1179
01:30:04,233 --> 01:30:05,859
Where was Wakanda?

1180
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:09,446
Hmm?

1181
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:13,701
Yeah, all that ends today.

1182
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:16,996
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.

1183
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,872
Already in place.

1184
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:20,374
I know how colonizers think.

1185
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:23,085
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.

1186
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:26,964
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.

1187
01:30:27,131 --> 01:30:29,842
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...

1188
01:30:30,009 --> 01:30:32,428
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.

1189
01:30:32,595 --> 01:30:34,263
And their children.

1190
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:36,098
And anyone else
who takes their side.

1191
01:30:36,265 --> 01:30:38,726
It's time they know
the truth about us!

1192
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,519
We're warriors!

1193
01:30:40,686 --> 01:30:43,856
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.

1194
01:30:45,399 --> 01:30:48,777
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.

1195
01:30:49,528 --> 01:30:52,197
Wakanda has survived
for so long...

1196
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:55,659
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.

1197
01:30:55,826 --> 01:30:58,454
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.

1198
01:30:59,997 --> 01:31:02,207
But the world is changing,
General.

1199
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,378
Elders, it is getting smaller.

1200
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:08,422
The outside world
is catching up...

1201
01:31:08,589 --> 01:31:10,591
and soon it will be
the conquerors

1202
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:12,760
or the conquered.

1203
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,388
I'd rather be the former.

1204
01:31:18,557 --> 01:31:21,185
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.

1205
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,146
<i>So where are we
going again?</i>

1206
01:31:24,313 --> 01:31:25,939
<i>We're taking
the Heart-Shaped Herb</i>

1207
01:31:26,023 --> 01:31:27,024
<i>to Jabariland.</i>

1208
01:31:27,191 --> 01:31:28,817
Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?

1209
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:31,403
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.

1210
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:34,156
It's what made T'Challa
so strong.

1211
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:35,741
Nakia.

1212
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,997
I don't like this.

1213
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:43,916
The Herb belongs to us.

1214
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:47,294
We may be creating
a bigger monster with M'Baku.

1215
01:31:53,384 --> 01:31:57,137
Nakia, you should
take it yourself.

1216
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:01,100
I am a spy with no army.

1217
01:32:02,476 --> 01:32:04,228
I wouldn't stand a chance.

1218
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:07,523
We'll go.

1219
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:15,447
Oh, boy.

1220
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:22,079
Oh, shit.

1221
01:32:23,205 --> 01:32:25,082
Look down. Stay calm.

1222
01:32:25,249 --> 01:32:26,250
Shuri.

1223
01:32:27,543 --> 01:32:28,961
Look down.

1224
01:33:04,288 --> 01:33:05,581
My son...

1225
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:10,252
was murdered in ritual combat.

1226
01:33:10,711 --> 01:33:12,880
- Were the odds fair?
- Yes, but...

1227
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,631
So it was less a murder
than a defeat.

1228
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:16,675
- Do not rub our noses in it!
- Silence!

1229
01:33:17,843 --> 01:33:20,429
I make
the pronouncements here, girl.

1230
01:33:20,596 --> 01:33:23,265
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...

1231
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:27,227
The new king...

1232
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:37,279
You cannot talk!

1233
01:33:37,446 --> 01:33:38,822
One more word,

1234
01:33:38,906 --> 01:33:41,158
and I will feed you
to my children.

1235
01:33:45,329 --> 01:33:47,539
I'm kidding.
We are vegetarians.

1236
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:58,050
Great Gorilla M'Baku...

1237
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:03,847
this is why we are here.

1238
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,809
To offer this to you.

1239
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:09,937
An outsider
sits on our throne.

1240
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,939
Only you can help us stop him.

1241
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:30,833
Come with me.

1242
01:34:47,182 --> 01:34:49,226
impossible!

1243
01:34:55,107 --> 01:34:56,149
Is he breathing?

1244
01:34:56,316 --> 01:34:59,069
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.

1245
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:01,113
<i>One of our fishermen found him</i>

1246
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:02,823
<i>at the edge
of the river border.</i>

1247
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:04,283
<i>He brought him to me.</i>

1248
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:06,201
Why do you have him
in the snow?

1249
01:35:06,368 --> 01:35:07,536
It is the only thing
keeping him

1250
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:08,662
from joining the ancestors.

1251
01:35:08,829 --> 01:35:11,373
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.

1252
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:13,083
Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.

1253
01:35:14,793 --> 01:35:16,420
Nakia, the Herb.

1254
01:35:33,312 --> 01:35:35,272
I call upon the ancestors.

1255
01:35:35,731 --> 01:35:37,691
I call upon Bast.

1256
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:41,153
I am here
with my son, T'Challa.

1257
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:43,655
Heal him.

1258
01:35:55,584 --> 01:35:58,545
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!

1259
01:35:58,712 --> 01:35:59,963
Okay.

1260
01:36:12,059 --> 01:36:13,393
Praise the ancestors.

1261
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,561
Praise the ancestors.

1262
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:17,147
Praise the ancestors.

1263
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:19,608
Praise the ancestors.

1264
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,110
Wake up, T'Challa.

1265
01:36:23,362 --> 01:36:24,696
<i>Wake up.</i>

1266
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:28,533
My son.

1267
01:36:34,957 --> 01:36:37,834
The time has come
for you to come home...

1268
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,420
and be reunited with me.

1269
01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:52,808
Why?

1270
01:36:54,935 --> 01:36:58,021
Why didn't you
bring the boy home?

1271
01:36:59,773 --> 01:37:01,274
Why, <i>Baba?</i>

1272
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:04,319
He...

1273
01:37:05,278 --> 01:37:08,573
He was the truth
I chose to omit.

1274
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:12,327
You were wrong to abandon him.

1275
01:37:12,494 --> 01:37:14,371
I chose my people.

1276
01:37:15,205 --> 01:37:17,749
I chose Wakanda.

1277
01:37:17,916 --> 01:37:19,793
Our future depended...

1278
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,503
You were wrong!

1279
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:23,922
All of you were wrong!

1280
01:37:24,965 --> 01:37:27,884
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!

1281
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:32,139
We let the fear
of our discovery

1282
01:37:32,222 --> 01:37:34,808
stop us from doing
what is right!

1283
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:37,227
No more!

1284
01:37:41,023 --> 01:37:44,776
I cannot stay here with you.

1285
01:37:46,570 --> 01:37:50,824
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.

1286
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:54,369
He is a monster
of our own making.

1287
01:37:56,038 --> 01:37:59,374
I must take the mantle back.
I must!

1288
01:38:01,418 --> 01:38:04,087
I must right these wrongs.

1289
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:16,600
Do you have a blanket?

1290
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:21,229
Killmonger
has the full support

1291
01:38:21,313 --> 01:38:22,481
of our military.

1292
01:38:24,608 --> 01:38:26,777
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.

1293
01:38:27,861 --> 01:38:28,987
Of course he did.

1294
01:38:29,071 --> 01:38:30,864
That's what he was
trained to do.

1295
01:38:31,031 --> 01:38:32,657
His unit used to work
with the CIA

1296
01:38:32,741 --> 01:38:34,576
to destabilize
foreign countries.

1297
01:38:34,743 --> 01:38:36,828
They would always strike
at transitions of power...

1298
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:39,164
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.

1299
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:41,708
You get control of government,
the military...

1300
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:43,960
- Our resources.
- Right.

1301
01:38:45,087 --> 01:38:46,088
The Great Mound.

1302
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:47,923
Our vibranium,
all of my designs.

1303
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:50,759
He will send our weapons
all over the world.

1304
01:38:54,096 --> 01:38:56,389
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.

1305
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:57,557
- What?
- What about you?

1306
01:38:58,475 --> 01:39:00,435
The challenge
will have to continue.

1307
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:03,897
T'Challa, we will not
leave Wakanda.

1308
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:06,066
It is my duty
to keep you safe.

1309
01:39:06,233 --> 01:39:08,735
If he gets control
of our technology,

1310
01:39:08,819 --> 01:39:10,153
nowhere will be safe.

1311
01:39:30,799 --> 01:39:32,717
The Black Panther lives.

1312
01:39:33,677 --> 01:39:35,762
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...

1313
01:39:35,929 --> 01:39:38,473
I will be right there
beside him.

1314
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:40,809
As will I.

1315
01:39:41,268 --> 01:39:42,519
I'm in, too.

1316
01:39:44,271 --> 01:39:46,356
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

1317
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:51,069
Are you done?

1318
01:39:52,237 --> 01:39:54,281
Are you done?

1319
01:39:55,824 --> 01:39:58,994
Could you give me
and Lord M'Baku a moment?

1320
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:08,628
Thank you.

1321
01:40:09,296 --> 01:40:11,548
I owed you a great debt.

1322
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,925
A life for a life.

1323
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:15,635
Consider it paid.

1324
01:40:16,303 --> 01:40:18,513
Please allow my mother
to stay here.

1325
01:40:19,306 --> 01:40:22,225
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.

1326
01:40:23,393 --> 01:40:26,062
You know, I could use
an army as well.

1327
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,857
I bet you could.

1328
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:30,192
But no.

1329
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:34,487
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.

1330
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:36,323
It is our cause.

1331
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:39,242
- It is for all of us.
- Oh, us?

1332
01:40:39,409 --> 01:40:41,661
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...

1333
01:40:41,828 --> 01:40:45,790
and now you speak of "us"?

1334
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:49,753
I cannot speak for past kings.

1335
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:53,256
But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.

1336
01:40:53,423 --> 01:40:56,301
We both know the power
of vibranium.

1337
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,054
If Killmonger
gains control of it,

1338
01:40:59,137 --> 01:41:01,097
who do you think
he will come for next?

1339
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:12,108
We will not help you.

1340
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:41,888
Everything is on schedule.

1341
01:41:42,055 --> 01:41:43,223
Have the spies been alerted?

1342
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:45,517
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.

1343
01:41:45,892 --> 01:41:47,394
But the War Dogs in London,

1344
01:41:47,477 --> 01:41:49,271
New York and Hong Kong
are standing by.

1345
01:41:50,939 --> 01:41:52,565
We'll strike there first.

1346
01:41:52,732 --> 01:41:54,526
The others'll come around.

1347
01:41:54,693 --> 01:41:56,069
Look at this.

1348
01:41:56,236 --> 01:41:57,320
A hand held sonic cannon,

1349
01:41:57,404 --> 01:41:58,780
powerful enough
to stop a tank...

1350
01:41:58,947 --> 01:42:00,573
untraceable by
metal detectors.

1351
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:02,784
And we got thousands of them.

1352
01:42:04,953 --> 01:42:08,081
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.

1353
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:40,822
He lives.

1354
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:46,786
N'Jadaka!

1355
01:42:47,996 --> 01:42:49,247
Wassup?

1356
01:42:49,414 --> 01:42:51,166
I never yielded!

1357
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:55,628
And as you can see,
I am not dead!

1358
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:58,256
All that challenge shit
is over with!

1359
01:42:58,340 --> 01:42:59,466
I'm the king now!

1360
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:01,843
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!

1361
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:11,895
- Shuri, now.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

1362
01:43:15,273 --> 01:43:17,984
Go, go, go!
Come on, Ross!

1363
01:43:18,151 --> 01:43:20,612
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.

1364
01:43:21,738 --> 01:43:24,824
W'Kabi, the challenge
is not complete.

1365
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:30,038
What will we do?

1366
01:43:31,456 --> 01:43:32,540
Border Tribe!

1367
01:43:46,596 --> 01:43:47,597
You!

1368
01:43:47,764 --> 01:43:50,100
Your heart
is so full of hatred...

1369
01:43:50,266 --> 01:43:52,102
you are not fit to be a king!

1370
01:43:56,481 --> 01:43:57,607
Come on!

1371
01:43:57,774 --> 01:43:58,775
Ayo, the king!

1372
01:44:14,374 --> 01:44:15,417
Shields!

1373
01:44:46,072 --> 01:44:47,073
Ah!

1374
01:44:50,535 --> 01:44:51,870
W'Kabi, stop this!

1375
01:44:53,121 --> 01:44:54,622
Stop this now!

1376
01:44:58,793 --> 01:44:59,794
No!

1377
01:45:28,156 --> 01:45:30,617
Nakia and I will get control
of the <i>Royal Talon</i> with this.

1378
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:32,243
So what do I do?

1379
01:45:32,410 --> 01:45:33,495
You'll have to fly it.

1380
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:36,289
- What?
- You were a great pilot.

1381
01:45:36,456 --> 01:45:38,500
Don't worry,
I'll guide you through it.

1382
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:40,793
It's just like riding
a hoverbike.

1383
01:45:41,503 --> 01:45:43,171
What? You guys
have hoverbikes?

1384
01:45:43,338 --> 01:45:45,131
Hey, Nakia, take that.

1385
01:45:45,298 --> 01:45:48,051
- I'm not a Dora.
- Just put it on, it's armor!

1386
01:45:49,552 --> 01:45:50,595
Come!

1387
01:45:53,014 --> 01:45:54,182
Good luck, Agent Ross!

1388
01:45:54,349 --> 01:45:55,725
Yeah, I don't know
what I'm doing with this.

1389
01:45:55,808 --> 01:45:57,185
We're counting on you.

1390
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:11,241
Wakanda forever.

1391
01:46:19,457 --> 01:46:20,458
Come on!

1392
01:46:30,969 --> 01:46:32,095
Go, go!

1393
01:46:37,976 --> 01:46:40,853
<i>Remote
piloting system activated.</i>

1394
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:42,897
My God.

1395
01:46:43,064 --> 01:46:46,109
<i>I made it American
style for you. Get in.</i>

1396
01:46:46,276 --> 01:46:47,819
All right.

1397
01:46:53,992 --> 01:46:54,993
Yes!

1398
01:46:57,078 --> 01:46:59,789
Go! We can't let those weapons
get beyond Wakanda.

1399
01:47:01,791 --> 01:47:02,834
All right, I'm on it.

1400
01:47:19,976 --> 01:47:21,227
Lock!

1401
01:47:22,395 --> 01:47:23,605
Get him down!

1402
01:47:23,813 --> 01:47:25,398
Get the necklace!

1403
01:47:25,857 --> 01:47:27,442
Get the necklace!

1404
01:47:34,115 --> 01:47:36,200
Wakanda forever!

1405
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,252
Okay, Shuri. I got 'em.
What do I do?

1406
01:47:46,419 --> 01:47:47,795
Shoot them down, genius!

1407
01:47:47,962 --> 01:47:48,963
All right.

1408
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:51,633
Here goes nothing.

1409
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:00,016
All right, got them.

1410
01:48:04,354 --> 01:48:05,605
Oh, shit.

1411
01:48:06,564 --> 01:48:08,316
Shit, shit, shit.

1412
01:48:28,586 --> 01:48:29,671
Nice!

1413
01:49:04,914 --> 01:49:05,957
Shuri!

1414
01:49:10,253 --> 01:49:11,629
What's up, Princess?

1415
01:49:11,796 --> 01:49:13,881
You'll never be a true king.

1416
01:49:16,843 --> 01:49:17,844
Brother!

1417
01:49:50,001 --> 01:49:51,294
Shuri.

1418
01:49:51,711 --> 01:49:52,712
Brother!

1419
01:49:53,588 --> 01:49:55,256
Turn on the train
on the bottom track.

1420
01:49:55,423 --> 01:49:57,467
<i>The stabilizers
will deactivate your suit!</i>

1421
01:49:57,633 --> 01:49:58,968
You won't have protection!

1422
01:49:59,135 --> 01:50:00,470
Neither will he.

1423
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:02,013
Okay!

1424
01:50:26,078 --> 01:50:28,331
I don't need a suit
to kill you.

1425
01:50:28,498 --> 01:50:29,707
Your reign is over!

1426
01:50:29,874 --> 01:50:31,459
You sat up here,
safe and protected.

1427
01:50:31,626 --> 01:50:33,044
You want to
see us become

1428
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:35,046
just like the people
you hate so much.

1429
01:50:35,213 --> 01:50:36,964
Divide and conquer the land
as they did!

1430
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:39,550
Nah, I learn from my enemies.
Beat them at they own game.

1431
01:50:39,717 --> 01:50:40,968
You have become them!

1432
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,638
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!

1433
01:50:43,805 --> 01:50:45,556
The world took
everything away from me!

1434
01:50:45,723 --> 01:50:47,225
Everything I ever loved!

1435
01:50:47,391 --> 01:50:48,851
But I'mma make sure
we're even.

1436
01:50:49,018 --> 01:50:50,144
I'mma track down
anyone who would

1437
01:50:50,228 --> 01:50:51,729
even think
about being loyal to you!

1438
01:50:51,896 --> 01:50:53,231
And I'm gonna put
they ass in the dirt

1439
01:50:53,314 --> 01:50:54,398
right next to Zuri!

1440
01:50:56,692 --> 01:50:57,985
Nakia!

1441
01:51:01,113 --> 01:51:02,907
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay. You?

1442
01:51:03,074 --> 01:51:04,826
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1443
01:51:11,958 --> 01:51:14,252
Shuri, I've lost one of them,
but two are on my tail.

1444
01:51:16,671 --> 01:51:17,880
Shit. What the hell was that?

1445
01:51:18,047 --> 01:51:19,382
<i>The lab is under attack.</i>

1446
01:51:19,465 --> 01:51:20,508
What? Where?

1447
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:22,510
<i>Deactivating hologram.</i>

1448
01:51:26,556 --> 01:51:29,392
<i>Ross, you have to
get out of there, now!</i>

1449
01:51:29,976 --> 01:51:31,352
How long have I got?

1450
01:51:32,061 --> 01:51:35,106
<i>Glass integrity is at 50%.</i>

1451
01:51:35,898 --> 01:51:36,941
Put me back in.

1452
01:51:37,108 --> 01:51:38,818
<i>Ross! Ross!</i>

1453
01:51:57,712 --> 01:51:59,213
Surrender now!

1454
01:51:59,672 --> 01:52:02,550
You have three seconds
to lay down your weapon!

1455
01:52:02,717 --> 01:52:03,843
One!

1456
01:52:03,968 --> 01:52:04,969
Two!

1457
01:52:15,021 --> 01:52:19,275
Witness the might
of the Jabari firsthand!

1458
01:53:00,358 --> 01:53:02,693
<i>Glass integrity is at 15%.</i>

1459
01:53:11,577 --> 01:53:13,537
- <i>Critical weapons failure.</i>
- Shit!

1460
01:53:18,751 --> 01:53:20,378
Hey, Shuri!
The last cargo ship

1461
01:53:20,461 --> 01:53:21,712
is almost at the border...

1462
01:53:21,879 --> 01:53:23,047
but they got me trapped
with some kind of cables.

1463
01:53:23,214 --> 01:53:24,507
Make an X with your arms!

1464
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:27,510
<i>Sonic Overload initiated.</i>

1465
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:29,512
Now break it!

1466
01:53:38,437 --> 01:53:40,356
<i>System rebooting in five...</i>

1467
01:53:40,815 --> 01:53:42,900
<i>four, three...</i>

1468
01:53:43,067 --> 01:53:44,694
<i>two, one.</i>

1469
01:53:45,277 --> 01:53:46,404
<i>System rebooted.</i>

1470
01:53:58,708 --> 01:54:00,042
Yes! We did it!

1471
01:54:00,209 --> 01:54:01,752
<i>Great!
Now get out of there!</i>

1472
01:54:12,930 --> 01:54:14,223
Charge!

1473
01:54:34,035 --> 01:54:36,370
Drop your weapon!

1474
01:54:37,913 --> 01:54:40,082
Would you kill me, my love?

1475
01:54:40,249 --> 01:54:41,709
For Wakanda?

1476
01:54:45,004 --> 01:54:46,714
Without question!

1477
01:55:30,716 --> 01:55:32,259
This is it for you, Cousin.

1478
01:55:57,993 --> 01:55:59,537
Hell of a move!

1479
01:56:20,724 --> 01:56:22,309
My pop said Wakanda was

1480
01:56:22,393 --> 01:56:23,978
the most beautiful thing
he ever seen.

1481
01:56:27,690 --> 01:56:30,192
He promised he was gonna
show it to me one day.

1482
01:56:31,861 --> 01:56:33,445
You believe that?

1483
01:56:34,321 --> 01:56:35,447
Kid from Oakland,

1484
01:56:35,531 --> 01:56:37,408
running around
believing in fairy tales.

1485
01:57:25,789 --> 01:57:27,708
It's beautiful.

1486
01:57:41,889 --> 01:57:44,308
Maybe we can still heal you.

1487
01:57:46,727 --> 01:57:47,895
Why?

1488
01:57:49,688 --> 01:57:51,899
So you can just lock me up?

1489
01:57:55,152 --> 01:57:56,487
Nah.

1490
01:57:58,697 --> 01:58:00,366
Just bury me in the ocean...

1491
01:58:00,532 --> 01:58:03,077
with my ancestors
that jumped from the ships.

1492
01:58:03,911 --> 01:58:07,289
'Cause they knew
death was better than bondage.

1493
01:59:31,832 --> 01:59:32,833
Thank you.

1494
01:59:34,835 --> 01:59:36,420
You saved me.

1495
01:59:37,338 --> 01:59:39,465
You saved my family.

1496
01:59:41,675 --> 01:59:43,093
Our nation.

1497
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:45,596
There's nothing
to thank me for.

1498
01:59:45,763 --> 01:59:47,306
It is our duty to...

1499
01:59:50,934 --> 01:59:53,604
It was my duty to fight
for what I love.

1500
01:59:54,646 --> 01:59:55,647
I should've...

1501
02:00:02,363 --> 02:00:04,573
You can't blame me,
I almost died.

1502
02:00:08,243 --> 02:00:09,495
Stay.

1503
02:00:11,955 --> 02:00:13,207
I think I know a way

1504
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:15,542
you can still fulfill
your calling.

1505
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:18,128
Please stay.

1506
02:00:51,245 --> 02:00:52,996
Oh, he moves it!
He moves it!

1507
02:00:53,163 --> 02:00:54,832
- Who man is that?
- Bucket!

1508
02:00:54,998 --> 02:00:55,999
Easy.

1509
02:00:59,002 --> 02:01:00,337
When you said
you would take me

1510
02:01:00,421 --> 02:01:02,339
to California
for the first time...

1511
02:01:02,506 --> 02:01:04,466
I thought
you meant Coachella...

1512
02:01:04,633 --> 02:01:06,093
or Disneyland.

1513
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:08,178
Why here?

1514
02:01:11,306 --> 02:01:14,768
This is where our father
killed our uncle.

1515
02:01:19,982 --> 02:01:21,733
They're tearing it down.

1516
02:01:22,818 --> 02:01:23,819
Good.

1517
02:01:23,986 --> 02:01:25,988
They are not tearing it down.

1518
02:01:27,114 --> 02:01:28,740
I bought this building.

1519
02:01:30,784 --> 02:01:32,703
And that building.

1520
02:01:33,537 --> 02:01:35,289
And that one over there.

1521
02:01:36,498 --> 02:01:37,791
This will be the first

1522
02:01:37,875 --> 02:01:40,210
Wakandan International
Outreach Center.

1523
02:01:41,462 --> 02:01:44,131
Nakia will oversee
the social outreach.

1524
02:01:44,882 --> 02:01:46,133
And you will spearhead

1525
02:01:46,216 --> 02:01:48,385
the science
and information exchange.

1526
02:01:49,094 --> 02:01:51,054
You're kidding.

1527
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:52,723
Eh?

1528
02:02:01,982 --> 02:02:03,025
Oh...

1529
02:02:03,108 --> 02:02:06,028
Hey, yo.
Man, what the hell is that?

1530
02:02:06,195 --> 02:02:07,905
That's like
a Bugatti spaceship!

1531
02:02:08,071 --> 02:02:10,657
Bro, it came out of nowhere.
Did y'all see that?

1532
02:02:13,785 --> 02:02:14,953
What?

1533
02:02:16,788 --> 02:02:17,789
Check it out, bro.

1534
02:02:17,956 --> 02:02:19,333
We can take this back
to the house.

1535
02:02:20,626 --> 02:02:21,710
Pull up to school in this.

1536
02:02:21,793 --> 02:02:23,754
Look, we can break it apart.
We can sell it.

1537
02:02:23,837 --> 02:02:24,838
On eBay.

1538
02:02:24,922 --> 02:02:26,006
Everybody get, like,
a million apiece.

1539
02:02:26,173 --> 02:02:27,424
I wouldn't do that
if I were you guys.

1540
02:02:27,508 --> 02:02:28,634
- Where you come from?
- From Wakanda.

1541
02:02:28,717 --> 02:02:29,843
What is a Wakanda?

1542
02:02:29,927 --> 02:02:30,928
Hey, yo!

1543
02:02:31,637 --> 02:02:32,846
This yours?

1544
02:02:36,642 --> 02:02:37,976
Who...

1545
02:02:38,352 --> 02:02:39,520
Who are you?

1546
02:05:25,519 --> 02:05:27,688
<i>My name is King T'Challa...</i>

1547
02:05:27,854 --> 02:05:29,981
<i>son of King T'Chaka.</i>

1548
02:05:30,148 --> 02:05:34,486
<i>I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.</i>

1549
02:05:34,653 --> 02:05:37,406
<i>And for the first time
in our history...</i>

1550
02:05:37,572 --> 02:05:40,784
<i>we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...</i>

1551
02:05:40,951 --> 02:05:42,828
<i>with the outside world.</i>

1552
02:05:42,994 --> 02:05:46,373
<i>Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.</i>

1553
02:05:46,540 --> 02:05:47,958
<i>We cannot.</i>

1554
02:05:49,084 --> 02:05:50,585
<i>We must not.</i>

1555
02:05:50,919 --> 02:05:53,547
<i>We will work to be an example
of how we...</i>

1556
02:05:53,714 --> 02:05:55,966
<i>as brothers and sisters
on this earth...</i>

1557
02:05:56,133 --> 02:05:58,176
<i>should treat each other.</i>

1558
02:05:58,343 --> 02:06:00,178
<i>Now, more than ever...</i>

1559
02:06:01,430 --> 02:06:05,851
<i>the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.</i>

1560
02:06:06,268 --> 02:06:08,186
<i>We all know the truth.</i>

1561
02:06:08,353 --> 02:06:11,773
<i>More connects us
than separates us.</i>

1562
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:13,650
<i>But in times of crisis...</i>

1563
02:06:13,817 --> 02:06:16,278
<i>the wise build bridges...</i>

1564
02:06:16,445 --> 02:06:19,239
<i>while the foolish
build barriers.</i>

1565
02:06:19,406 --> 02:06:21,450
<i>We must find a way...</i>

1566
02:06:21,616 --> 02:06:24,244
<i>to look after one another...</i>

1567
02:06:24,411 --> 02:06:29,124
<i>as if we were one,
single tribe.</i>

1568
02:06:29,291 --> 02:06:30,751
<i>With all due respect,
King T'Challa...</i>

1569
02:06:30,917 --> 02:06:32,169
<i>what can a nation of farmers</i>

1570
02:06:32,252 --> 02:06:34,129
<i>have to offer
the rest of the world?</i>

1571
02:13:33,715 --> 02:13:35,717
Are you playing around
with that man again?

1572
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:36,801
- No.
- You're teasing him again.

1573
02:13:38,219 --> 02:13:40,346
- Don't wake him. He must rest.
- No, I'm not.

1574
02:13:41,306 --> 02:13:42,682
No, I'm not.

1575
02:13:43,641 --> 02:13:44,851
Thabo,
you're doing that.

1576
02:13:45,018 --> 02:13:46,394
He's doing it.
He's lying.

1577
02:13:46,561 --> 02:13:47,979
No, he's resting.

1578
02:13:48,271 --> 02:13:49,480
Go, go!

1579
02:13:49,647 --> 02:13:51,441
White Wolf!

1580
02:13:51,566 --> 02:13:52,609
Stop that!

1581
02:13:52,734 --> 02:13:53,860
White Wolf!

1582
02:13:56,613 --> 02:13:58,239
Good morning, Sergeant Barnes.

1583
02:13:59,741 --> 02:14:00,742
Bucky.

1584
02:14:02,368 --> 02:14:03,411
How are you feeling?

1585
02:14:04,037 --> 02:14:05,038
Good.

1586
02:14:07,665 --> 02:14:08,750
Thank you.

1587
02:14:08,833 --> 02:14:10,376
Come.

1588
02:14:11,878 --> 02:14:13,755
Much more for you to learn.
