1
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:23,941
We've become bored with watching
actors give us phony emotions.

2
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:28,404
We're tired of pyrotechnics
and special effects.

3
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:33,784
While the world he inhabits is,
in some respects, counterfeit,

4
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:37,663
there's nothing fake about
Truman himself.

5
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,958
No scripts, no cue cards.

6
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:44,795
It isn't always Shakespeare,
but it's genuine.

7
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:46,964
It's a life.

8
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,762
<i>I'm not going to make it.</i>

9
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:55,973
<i>You're going to have to go on
without me.</i>

10
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:02,813
<i>No way, mister.</i>

11
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:07,485
<i>You're going to the top of this mountain,
broken legs and all.</i>

12
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,159
We find many viewers leave him on
all night for comfort.

13
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,163
<i>You're crazy, you know that?</i>

14
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,587
For me, there is no difference
between a private life and a public life.

15
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:30,007
My life, is my life, is <i>The Truman Show.</i>

16
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,426
<i>The Truman Show</i> is a lifestyle.

17
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,845
It's a noble life. It is

18
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,308
a truly blessed life.

19
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:42,019
<i>Yeah, tell me something I don't know.</i>

20
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:46,148
<i>All right. Promise me one thing, though.</i>

21
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,443
<i>If I die before I reach the summit,</i>

22
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:53,489
<i>you'll use me
as an alternative source of food.</i>

23
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:55,658
<i>Gross.</i>

24
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,372
It's all true. It's all real.

25
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,293
Nothing here is fake.
Nothing you see on this show is fake.

26
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,044
It's merely controlled.

27
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:18,264
Eat me, damn it. That's an order.

28
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,394
Maybe just your love handles.

29
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:27,940
I have love handles? Yeah. Little ones.

30
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,693
Truman. You're going to be late.

31
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:32,945
Okay!

32
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,961
- Good morning.
- Morning.

33
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:50,212
Good morning.

34
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:54,592
In case I don't see you, good afternoon,
good evening, and good night.

35
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:56,844
Yeah.

36
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,846
- Morning, Truman.
- Morning, Spencer.

37
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,723
Hey, Pluto. No, get down.

38
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,558
- He won't hurt you.
- Get down.

39
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,185
I know.

40
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,562
- It's just me.
- Come on, Pluto.

41
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,127
What is it?

42
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:55,528
<i>Here's a news flash just in. An aircraft
in trouble began shedding parts</i>

43
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,697
<i>as it flew over Seahaven
just a few moments ago.</i>

44
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,491
<i>Luckily, no one was hurt.</i>

45
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,660
<i>But, hey, how do you feel today?</i>

46
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,079
<i>That's good.
You thinking of flying somewhere?</i>

47
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,705
- Nope.
- <i>No? Good.</i>

48
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,874
<i>This is Classical Clive
with Classical Drive</i>

49
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,293
<i>so why don't you forget
about the perils of flying,</i>

50
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:14,380
<i>settle back,
and let this music calm you down?</i>

51
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,178
- <i>Dog Fancy,</i> please.
- <i>Dog Fancy.</i>

52
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:24,098
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

53
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,017
Give me a paper there, will you, Earl?

54
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,062
And one of these for the wife.

55
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:31,939
Loves her fashion mags.

56
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,566
Will that be all for you, Truman?

57
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,026
- That's the whole kit and caboodle.
- Catch you later.

58
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,154
Okay. Yeah.

59
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,662
Good morning.

60
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:49,832
- Hank.
- Morning, Truman.

61
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,377
- Good morning, Truman.
- How are you guys?

62
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,713
- Beautiful day, isn't it?
- Always.

63
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,423
And how's your lovely wife?

64
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,426
Good. How about yours?

65
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,012
- Couldn't be better.
- Fine.

66
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,930
- Nice talking to you, Truman.
- You, too.

67
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,140
We must go now.

68
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,852
Think about that policy. Okay,
that's two for one. That's a good deal.

69
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,146
- Doppelgänger special.
- Right.

70
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,397
Hi.

71
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,611
Hey, fellows. You going in? Go ahead.

72
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,989
- Go ahead.
- No, you first, please.

73
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,241
I'm not that anxious to get there.

74
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:40,382
Yes, hello.

75
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:44,011
Could I have directory assistance
for Fiji, please? Fiji islands.

76
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,513
Truman, did you see this?

77
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,475
I'm sorry, ma'am.

78
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,561
If he's in a coma,
he's probably uninsurable.

79
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,690
Hello? Yes. Fiji, please.

80
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,860
Do you have a listing for
Lauren Garland?

81
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,613
Nothing listed?

82
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,784
Okay. Do you have a Sylvia Garland?

83
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:08,452
"S" for Sylvia.

84
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,163
Nothing?

85
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,750
Okay. Thank you.

86
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:44,750
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

87
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,538
- Lawrence.
- Hey, Burbank.

88
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,041
Got a prospect in Wells Park
I need you to close.

89
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,837
Wells Park?

90
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,968
- On Harbor Island?
- You know another one?

91
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,888
I can't do it.
I have an appointment. Dentist.

92
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:16,061
You're going to lose a lot more than
your teeth if you don't meet your quota.

93
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:17,730
Look, Truman,

94
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,441
they're making cutbacks
at the end of this month.

95
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,027
- Cutbacks?
- Yeah. Now, you need this.

96
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:28,157
Besides, a half-hour across the bay,
a little sea air would do you good.

97
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,743
Thanks.

98
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,420
Hello.

99
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,673
Ferry's still here.
Thought I might have missed it.

100
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,675
One-way or return?

101
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,969
Return.

102
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,140
There you go, sir.

103
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:54,451
- Do you need any help, sir?
- You go ahead. I'll be fine.

104
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,287
Yeah.

105
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,136
Hi, honey.

106
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:16,306
Look what I got free at the checkout.

107
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:21,061
It's a Chef's Pal.
It's a dicer, grater, peeler, all in one.

108
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:23,897
Never needs sharpening,
dishwasher-safe.

109
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:24,982
Wow!

110
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,651
That's amazing.

111
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,070
Truman,

112
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,282
you missed a spot.

113
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,047
That is a beer.

114
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,719
You know, I'm thinking
about getting out, Marlon.

115
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,721
Yeah? Out of what?

116
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,348
Out of my job, out of Seahaven.

117
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,268
- Off this island. Out.
- Out of your job?

118
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,438
What the hell's wrong with your job?
You have a great job, Truman.

119
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,941
You have a desk job.
I'd kill for a desk job.

120
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:11,987
Here you go.

121
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,490
You should try stocking
vending machines for a living.

122
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,201
- No, thanks.
- Now there's excitement.

123
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,496
Don't you ever get antsy? Itchy feet?

124
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,832
Where's there to go?

125
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:26,794
Fiji.

126
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,839
Where the hell's Fiji? Near Florida?

127
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,805
- See here?
- Yeah.

128
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,348
This is us,

129
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,560
and all the way around here,

130
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,229
Fiji.

131
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,900
You can't get any further away
before you start coming back.

132
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,861
You know, there are still islands in Fiji

133
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:54,988
where no human being
has ever set foot.

134
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,369
So when are you going to go?

135
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,748
It's not that simple.

136
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,918
It takes money,

137
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,212
planning.

138
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,589
I can't just up and go.

139
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,591
Right.

140
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,220
I'm going to do it.
Don't worry about that.

141
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,515
Bonus time is just around the corner.

142
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:29,523
- You coming for a drink?
- No, I can't tonight.

143
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,421
I don't like the look of that weather, son.
I think we should head back.

144
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,048
- No, Dad. Not yet.
- No, come on. We should go back.

145
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,676
- A bit farther, please?
- Son, listen.

146
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,970
- Okay.
- Yes.

147
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,807
Daddy!

148
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,385
You're soaked. Where have you been?

149
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,679
I figure we can
scrape together $8,000...

150
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,138
Every time you and Marlon
get together...

151
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,307
We can bum around the world
for a year on that.

152
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:31,144
And then what, Truman?
We'd be where we were five years ago.

153
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:35,691
- You're talking like a teenager.
- Maybe I feel like a teenager.

154
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,735
We have mortgage payments, Truman.

155
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,404
We have car payments.

156
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,615
What, we're just going to walk away
from our financial obligations?

157
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,701
It would be an adventure.

158
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,831
I thought we were going to try for a
baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?

159
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,251
That can wait. I want to get away.

160
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,087
See some of the world, explore.

161
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,090
Honey, you want to be an explorer?

162
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,926
This'll pass.

163
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,555
We all think like this now and then.

164
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,768
Let's get you out of these wet clothes,

165
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,687
come to bed.

166
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,983
You never see anything anyway.
They always

167
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,986
turn the camera and play music and,

168
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,197
you know, the wind blows in,
and the curtains move

169
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,699
and you don't see anything.

170
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,956
- <i>Dog Fancy,</i> please.
- <i>Dog Fancy.</i>

171
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,542
Thank you.

172
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,588
- Paper, Earl, please.
- Paper.

173
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:44,551
I might as well pick one of these up
while I'm at it.

174
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,304
- For the wife?
- She's got to have them.

175
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,974
- Anything else, Truman?
- That's the whole ball of wax.

176
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,393
- Catch you later.
- Okay.

177
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,332
Dad?

178
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,378
What are you doing?

179
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,715
What the... Get out of the way!

180
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,342
Stop them!

181
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,513
Stop those people!

182
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,977
Open the doors!
Somebody, stop the bus!

183
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,189
Stop the bus! Somebody, stop it!

184
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,275
Somebody, stop the bus!

185
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,667
And wasn't it funny...

186
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,342
It doesn't sound insane at all, Truman.

187
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:11,304
I see him 10 times a week
in 100 different faces.

188
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,308
I almost hugged a perfect stranger
in the salon last Thursday.

189
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,979
It was Dad. I swear.
Dressed like a homeless man.

190
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,981
And you know what else was strange?

191
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,066
A businessman and a woman
with a little dog

192
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,777
came out of nowhere
and forced him onto a bus.

193
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,655
It's about time they cleaned up
the trash downtown

194
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,449
before we become
just like the rest of the country.

195
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,077
They never found Dad's body.
Maybe somehow...

196
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,162
God!

197
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:38,540
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him,
it was his twin.

198
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,045
- Did Dad have a brother?
- Truman, you know perfectly well

199
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:48,800
that your father was an only child,
just like you.

200
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,054
Now, sweetie,

201
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,892
you're just feeling bad
because of what happened.

202
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,104
You, sailing off into that storm.

203
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,776
But I've never blamed you, Truman,

204
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,946
and I don't blame you now.

205
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,410
Truman?

206
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,667
What are you doing down here?

207
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,795
Fixing the mower.

208
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,676
- Saw my father today.
- I know.

209
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,764
Your mother called.

210
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,394
You really shouldn't upset her like that.

211
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,063
Did you want... What did you want?

212
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,023
I made macaroni.

213
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,192
I'm not hungry.

214
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:33,655
You know, you really ought to throw out
that mower.

215
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,242
Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.

216
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,405
What's he doing?

217
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,491
See, they got rid of her,
but they couldn't erase the memory.

218
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,243
The memory of who?

219
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,298
- You okay? You all right?
- Excuse me. Hi.

220
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,634
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry I fell on you like that.

221
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,845
- It's okay.
- I've just been such a klutz all day.

222
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,430
It's all right.

223
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:25,558
Sprained this ankle. Oh, my goodness.
I'm so sorry.

224
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:29,521
- I'm so sorry to fall on you like that.
- That's all right. Don't worry about it.

225
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:31,981
- I'm Meryl.
- Hi, I'm Truman.

226
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,525
Hey, nice to meet you.

227
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:03,531
- Truman, you've studied enough.
- No. I got to commit this to memory.

228
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,575
Come on, Truman,
one ice-cold brewski.

229
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:06,910
Come on.

230
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:10,747
You're going to have to copy off me,
so be careful.

231
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,376
You're a better person than I am.

232
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,711
- See you later.
- Okay.

233
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,171
- Bye.
- Bye.

234
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,798
See you later, loser.

235
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,610
Hi.

236
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:30,410
- <i>Konnichi-wa.</i>
- What?

237
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,704
You take Japanese.

238
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,164
Yes.

239
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:39,752
Lauren, right?

240
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:41,462
It's on the...

241
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,674
Lauren. Right.

242
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,844
I'm Truman Burbank.

243
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,555
Yeah, I know.

244
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:54,100
You know, Truman,
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

245
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,393
Really?

246
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:01,816
Yeah. I can understand that.
I'm a pretty dangerous character.

247
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,110
I'm sorry. It's not up to me.

248
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:07,071
A girl's got to be careful.

249
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:13,036
- You have a boyfriend, right?
- No, it's not that.

250
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,664
Was it Meryl, that girl that was with me?
We're not... We don't...

251
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,167
We're just friends.

252
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,919
- It's nothing like that.
- It's how I look?

253
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,504
Not your type?

254
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:25,548
No.

255
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,551
I like your pin.

256
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,888
I was wondering that myself.

257
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,892
Would you want to maybe, possibly,

258
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:39,937
sometime go out
for some pizza or something?

259
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,648
Like, Friday?

260
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,108
- Saturday?
- I can't.

261
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,152
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?

262
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:53,242
- We have finals tomorrow.
- Yeah, I know.

263
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,913
If we don't go now, it won't happen.

264
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:01,459
Do you understand?
So what do you want to do?

265
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:38,621
Please keep your hands inside the car!

266
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,391
This is my favorite pizza place.

267
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,517
Tony!

268
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,644
One large, extra plankton.

269
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,773
We have so little time.
They're going to be here any minute.

270
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,818
- Who are?
- They don't want me talking to you.

271
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,945
Then don't talk.

272
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:26,669
They're here.

273
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,505
- Truman.
- What do they want?

274
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,716
Listen to me.
Everybody knows about you.

275
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,509
Everybody knows everything you do.

276
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,595
They're pretending, Truman.
Do you understand?

277
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:37,263
- Everybody's pretending.
- I don't know.

278
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,265
No, my name's not Lauren. It's Sylvia.

279
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,641
- My name's Sylvia.
- Sylvia?

280
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:43,102
- Yeah.
- Lauren, sweetheart, not again.

281
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:46,105
- Wait a minute. Who are you?
- I'm her father.

282
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:49,108
- I've never even seen him before.
- We weren't doing anything.

283
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:51,944
He's lying.
Truman, please don't listen to him.

284
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:56,783
Everything I've told you is the truth.
This, it's fake. It's all for you.

285
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:59,702
- I don't understand.
- The sky and sea, everything, it's a set.

286
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:00,787
It's a show.

287
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,247
Everybody's watching you.
Please don't listen to him.

288
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,458
He's going to lie to you.
They're watching us now.

289
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,544
- I want to know what's going on.
- Schizophrenia. She has episodes.

290
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:09,962
We've tried everything.

291
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:13,382
Hypnotism, shock therapy. Don't worry.

292
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,510
- Truman!
- You're not the first.

293
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:18,971
You're not the first. She brings
all her boyfriends down here.

294
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,641
What's he saying? Truman, he's lying.

295
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,894
- Get out of here. Come and find me.
- Don't worry.

296
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,439
We're going to Fiji.
Fiji. We're moving to Fiji.

297
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:29,607
Fiji?

298
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:42,787
Sylvia!

299
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,871
Hey!

300
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,925
Why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?

301
00:27:56,008 --> 00:28:00,471
His mother got sick, really sick.
He couldn't leave her. He's kind.

302
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:02,306
Maybe he's too kind.

303
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,518
I can't believe he married Meryl
on the rebound.

304
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,936
Excuse me.

305
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,312
Come on, Sal.

306
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:11,482
We've already got this
on the greatest hits tape.

307
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:12,608
Can I borrow that?

308
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,574
Close, but no cigar.

309
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:32,605
<i>And it's another beautiful day
in paradise, folks,</i>

310
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,441
<i>but don't forget to buckle up
out there in radio land.</i>

311
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,652
<i>Remember, a good driver...</i>

312
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:48,120
<i>...wait for the cue.</i>

313
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,415
<i>Stand by, one.</i>

314
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,834
<i>Countdown to action.</i>

315
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,461
<i>Stand by, one.</i>

316
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,509
<i>He's heading west on Stewart.
Stand by, all extras.</i>

317
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:05,930
<i>He'll be on you in about 90 seconds.
Props, make sure the coffee's hot.</i>

318
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:09,225
<i>Okay, he's making his turn
onto Lancaster Square.</i>

319
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,562
<i>Oh, my God! He nearly hit her.</i>

320
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:15,815
<i>Something's wrong.
Change frequencies.</i>

321
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,905
<i>Sorry about that, folks.</i>

322
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:25,324
<i>I guess we picked up
a police frequency or something.</i>

323
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:28,327
<i>It sometimes happens,
and it can drive you crazy.</i>

324
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,538
<i>Okay, it's Classical Clive back in here</i>

325
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:33,165
<i>and we've still got
some great music up ahead,</i>

326
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:34,500
<i>but don't forget to buckle up.</i>

327
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,211
<i>Remember safety.
A good driver is a safe driver.</i>

328
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,422
<i>A safe driver is what? Yes...</i>

329
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:56,939
Morning, ma'am.

330
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,041
- I love that idea.
- It's pretty cool, isn't it?

331
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:44,773
Can I help?

332
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:47,234
Yeah. I have an appointment
at Gable Enterprises.

333
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:48,777
They went bust.

334
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:55,993
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

335
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:59,205
- Just tell me what's happening.
- Got to go, sir. We're remodeling.

336
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,290
No, you're not.
What are those people doing?

337
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,083
It's none of your business!

338
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:05,628
If you don't tell me what's happening,
I'll report you!

339
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,463
You're trespassing.

340
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:39,954
Marlon.

341
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:43,249
- Truman. What are you doing here?
- I got to talk to you.

342
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,209
It's a bad time, okay? I'm way behind.

343
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,836
I'm onto something, Marlon.
Something big.

344
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:51,006
- You okay? You look like shit.
- I think I'm mixed up in something.

345
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,132
Mixed up in what?

346
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,968
There's no point trying to explain it,

347
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:57,179
but a lot of strange things
have been happening.

348
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:04,270
The people on the elevator.
There was no backing on it.

349
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,897
I looked out. There was people there.

350
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:10,192
And on the radio on the way to work,
it starts following me along,

351
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:11,986
talking about everything that I'm doing.

352
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,738
- Know what I mean?
- Truman, this is one of your fantasies...

353
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,240
I think this is about my dad.

354
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,534
- Your dad?
- I think he's alive.

355
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:23,414
Yeah. I'll tell you about it later.
I'm definitely being followed.

356
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:24,915
Who?

357
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:30,170
It's hard to tell.
They look just like regular people.

358
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:37,094
- How about those two?
- I don't know. Could be.

359
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:41,890
It's when I'm unpredictable, that's...
They can't, you know.

360
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,686
- Did anything happen?
- No.

361
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,980
We gotta get out of here.
You ready to go?

362
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,940
- No. I just came here.
- Come on.

363
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:51,734
I told you I can't.

364
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,906
You're going to get both our asses fired,
you know that?

365
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,159
- Okay, man, let's do it.
- What?

366
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,369
Whatever you say, I'm game.

367
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:04,955
- What are you talking about?
- Yes, sirree.

368
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,583
Your birthday comes but once a year.

369
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,255
Maybe I'm being set up for something.

370
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:15,507
You ever think about that, Marlon?

371
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:18,677
Like your whole life
has been building toward something?

372
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:19,762
No.

373
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:24,808
When you were hauling chickens
in the summer for Kaiser,

374
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:27,436
what was the furthest
you ever got off the island?

375
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,981
Went all over.
Never found a place like this, though.

376
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:35,319
Look at that sunset, Truman.
It's perfect.

377
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,279
Yeah.

378
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,990
That's the big guy.

379
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,911
- Quite a paintbrush he's got.
- Yep.

380
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,459
Just between you and me, Marlon,

381
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,129
I'm going away for a while.

382
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,633
- Really?
- Yeah.

383
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,095
Little angel.

384
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,144
My little clown.

385
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:12,940
Old carrot top.

386
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,317
The best of both of us.

387
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:19,655
We should be
getting you home, Mother.

388
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:23,200
Hold on a minute.
Here's us at Mt. Rushmore.

389
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,577
Do you remember, Truman,
when Dad was still with us?

390
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:29,123
That was quite a drive.
You slept the whole way there.

391
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,500
It looks so small.

392
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,836
Things always do
when you look back, darling.

393
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,379
Look, Truman.

394
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:38,257
The happiest day of our lives. Look.

395
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:43,095
Jean, Jodie, Joanne.

396
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,681
Doesn't she look beautiful, Truman?

397
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,225
She still does.

398
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:51,019
And there's lots of pages left over
for baby photos.

399
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:54,690
I would like to hold a grandchild
in my arms before I go.

400
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,443
Angela, we really should
be getting you home.

401
00:37:57,526 --> 00:38:00,028
- I'll take her.
- No. You stay, relax.

402
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,822
Enjoy yourself.
Your favorite show will be coming on.

403
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:02,948
You sure?

404
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,950
Besides, we have something
to discuss.

405
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:09,538
- A certain person's birthday.
- I see.

406
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:14,626
<i>And there'll be another episode of</i>
I Love Lucy <i>same time tomorrow.</i>

407
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,546
<i>But right now,
it's time</i> for Golden Oldies.

408
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,299
<i>Tonight, we present
the enduring, much-loved classic,</i>

409
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:22,468
Show Me the Way to Go Home.

410
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,761
<i>A hymn of praise to small-town life,</i>

411
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:27,139
<i>where we learn
that you don't have to leave home</i>

412
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:31,852
<i>to discover what the world's all about,
and that no one is poor who has friends.</i>

413
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:36,857
<i>Full of laughter and love, pain and
sadness, but ultimately redemption,</i>

414
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,651
<i>we share the trials and tribulations
of the Abbott family.</i>

415
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:42,654
<i>Note the touching performance
of Ronald Brierly as Uncle Bunny.</i>

416
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:45,324
<i>That scene with the bowl of cherries
is going to have you</i>

417
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:48,327
<i>splitting your sides
with laughter all over again.</i>

418
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:52,372
<i>And there'll be tears, too,
when David and Jennifer are reunited.</i>

419
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:56,293
<i>But enough from me.
Let's join the Abbotts in Camden village.</i>

420
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:25,405
Thank you, sweetie.

421
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:32,621
I need to talk to you,
but let's go outside.

422
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:37,459
- Sweetie, I'd love to, but I'm really late.
- What's your rush?

423
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:39,878
Surgery.

424
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:43,423
There was that elevator disaster
downtown. It was on the news last night.

425
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:45,217
This cable just snapped.

426
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,844
This elevator,
it just plummeted down 10 flights.

427
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:50,389
The non-union workers. Just monsters.

428
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:53,100
That building, it's right next door
to where you work.

429
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,185
Can you imagine
if you had been in there?

430
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:56,812
It's not even worth thinking about.

431
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,815
Anyway, I have an amputation
on one of the young women

432
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,402
who was in that elevator.
She's very young. It's very sad.

433
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:06,947
- Anyway, wish me luck.
- I'll cross my fingers for you.

434
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:52,409
Excuse me. Hi. Excuse me.
May I help you?

435
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:58,206
Yes. I'm looking for my wife,
Nurse Burbank. It's very important.

436
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,668
I'm afraid that that's not possible.
She's in pre-op.

437
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:05,047
Sure. Okay, fine.

438
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:08,133
- Can you pass along a message?
- I'll try.

439
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:11,970
Can you tell her I had to go to Fiji,
and that I'll call her when I get there?

440
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:15,724
- When you get to Fiji?
- You got it.

441
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:19,269
- Fine. I'll tell her.
- Thank you so much.

442
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:47,923
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

443
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,510
Here, let me help you with that.

444
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,182
He's here.

445
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:00,602
I know.

446
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:02,854
Scalpel.

447
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:13,198
I'm now making my primary incision

448
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:16,868
just above the right knee.

449
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:20,872
Hold her.

450
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:23,333
Nicely done.

451
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,712
This isn't going to be pretty.
Unless you're family...

452
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:29,297
It's just beautiful. Beautiful job.

453
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,802
I'll just let someone else tidy up here.

454
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,829
- I'm sorry to keep you.
- That's okay.

455
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:06,668
- How can I help?
- I would like to book a flight to Fiji.

456
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:11,047
When would you like to leave?

457
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,175
Today.

458
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:34,571
I'm sorry. I don't have anything
for at least a month.

459
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,532
- A month?
- It's the busy season.

460
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,953
You want to book the flight?

461
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:46,500
It doesn't matter.
I'll make other arrangements, okay?

462
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:52,631
Last call for Chicago!

463
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,383
All aboard!

464
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:01,848
Thank you.

465
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:06,728
Windy city, here we come.

466
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,065
- Hi.
- Hi.

467
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,403
Hello. Hi.

468
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,448
Sisters.

469
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:22,244
- Mom, isn't that...
- Face the front.

470
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:52,190
Everybody off. We've got a problem.

471
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,295
I'm sorry, son.

472
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:29,853
His father was from Chicago,
wasn't he?

473
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:33,815
No. His dentist was from Pensacola.
His father was from Des Moines.

474
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:35,984
But how come he wants to go
to Chicago?

475
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,695
He's not going to Chicago.
He's not going anywhere.

476
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:40,864
He has to have it out with Meryl.

477
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:58,006
Truman?

478
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:06,514
- Honey, are you okay?
- Get in.

479
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:11,394
Truman.

480
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:13,813
Look.

481
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,568
What?

482
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:22,364
I predict that in just a moment,

483
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:28,203
we will see a lady on a red bike,
followed by a man with flowers

484
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:32,207
and a Volkswagen Beetle
with a dented fender.

485
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,626
- Truman, please.
- Look.

486
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,633
Lady,

487
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,469
flowers,

488
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,764
and...

489
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:53,144
- Truman, this is silly.
- There it is!

490
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:55,563
There's that dented Beetle! Yes!

491
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:05,573
Don't you want to know how I did that?
I'll tell you.

492
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:08,076
They're on a loop.
They go around the block.

493
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,997
They come back. They go around again.
They just go round and round.

494
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,456
Round and round.

495
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,875
I invited Rita and Marlon
for a barbecue on Sunday.

496
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:18,420
- I'm gonna make my potato salad.
- I won't be here Sunday.

497
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,463
I need you to remind me
we need more charcoal.

498
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:23,425
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?

499
00:47:25,427 --> 00:47:28,930
You're upset because
you want to go to Fiji. Is that it?

500
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:32,809
Okay, go.

501
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:38,773
I think you should save for
a few months, and then go.

502
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:41,609
There. Are you happy now?

503
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:43,778
I'm going to go take a shower.

504
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:47,866
Let's go now.

505
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:50,994
I'm ready to go now. Why wait?
Early bird gathers no moss.

506
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,705
Rolling stone catches the worm, right?

507
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,876
Truman, what are you doing?

508
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:03,214
Truman!

509
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:07,135
Where shall we go?

510
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,722
- Truman, where are we going?
- I don't really know.

511
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,058
I guess I'm being spontaneous.

512
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:17,020
Somebody, help me!
I'm being spontaneous!

513
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:19,564
Forget Fiji.

514
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,567
- Can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?
- No.

515
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:28,865
- What about Atlantic City?
- No, you hate to gamble.

516
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:31,951
- That's right, I do, don't I?
- So why would you want to go there?

517
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:36,247
Because I never have.
That's why people go places, isn't it?

518
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:40,835
- Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
- Me, too.

519
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,638
Blocked at every turn.

520
00:48:52,806 --> 00:48:54,641
Beautifully synchronized,
don't you agree?

521
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:57,727
- You're blaming me for the traffic?
- Should I?

522
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:08,113
Truman, let's go home.

523
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,242
You're right.
We could be stuck here for hours.

524
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,661
It could be like this
all the way to Atlantic City.

525
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:16,246
Let's go back.

526
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:20,291
I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me.

527
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:26,005
Can you please slow down?

528
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:28,299
Yes, I can.

529
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:33,596
- Truman, that's our turnoff.
- I changed my mind again.

530
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,100
What's New Orleans like
this time of year? Mardi Gras!

531
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:47,360
Look, Meryl, same road, no cars.

532
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,862
It's magic.

533
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:52,490
Look, you let me out.
You're not right in the head.

534
00:49:52,574 --> 00:49:54,868
You want to destroy yourself,
you do it on your own.

535
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:57,078
I think I'd like a little company.

536
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:07,839
Truman, you knew this would happen.

537
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,968
You know you can't drive over water.

538
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,888
Let's go home where you'll feel safe.

539
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,601
- Give me your hand.
- Sweetie.

540
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,644
Drive.

541
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:23,438
Truman!

542
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,941
We shouldn't be doing this!
Truman, we're breaking the law!

543
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:28,735
- Oh, my!
- You can do it.

544
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,862
- Please, don't!
- You can make it.

545
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:32,488
Truman.

546
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:34,532
We're over.

547
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:37,952
- We're over the bridge.
- We're over?

548
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,580
- We're over the bridge.
- We're over.

549
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:48,213
Truman, what about that sign?

550
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:50,965
I'm sure they're exaggerating.
We'll be fine.

551
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,969
Exaggerating? Do you believe that?

552
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:57,013
- Truman, let's go back!
- Can't go back!

553
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,724
Oh, my! Truman, we're on fire!

554
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,226
- It's okay.
- We're on fire!

555
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:03,228
It's okay. It's just smoke.

556
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:04,854
- You okay?
- Yes.

557
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:07,065
- Want to do it again?
- No!

558
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:11,319
Truman, stop! Oh, God!

559
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:17,325
So what are we going to do for money
when we get to New Orleans?

560
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:20,370
I have my Seahaven bank card.

561
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:24,791
So what? We're just gonna eat
into our savings, is that it?

562
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:27,919
I'm going to have to call your mother
when we get there.

563
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:32,507
She's going to be worried sick. I don't
know how she's going to take this.

564
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,270
What now?

565
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:48,940
<i>This is a red alert.</i>

566
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,237
Truman, it looks like a leak at the plant.

567
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,447
Back up. Leak at the plant.

568
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:58,950
- We had to shut her down.
- Is there any way around?

569
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,744
- Whole area's being evacuated.
- Is there anything I can do?

570
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:03,788
- No, ma'am.
- Thank you for your help.

571
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,540
You're welcome, Truman.

572
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,334
Truman.

573
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,714
Truman!

574
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:14,799
Truman, come back!

575
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:18,720
Stop him!

576
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,389
Truman!

577
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:23,558
Catch him on the left!

578
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,451
Stay away!

579
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:48,875
No.

580
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:53,421
<i>...now in custody.</i>

581
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:00,595
Thank you both so much for your help.
I really appreciate it.

582
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:04,599
He's lucky to be alive, ma'am.
Next time, we'll have to file charges.

583
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,142
I understand.

584
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:08,603
- Thanks again.
- Good night.

585
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:29,040
Let me get you some help, Truman.

586
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,376
You're not well.

587
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:36,547
Why do you want to have a baby
with me?

588
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:39,384
You can't stand me.

589
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:41,427
That's not true.

590
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:48,810
Why don't you let me fix you
some of this new Mococoa drink?

591
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:52,146
All natural cocoa beans
from the upper slopes of Mt. Nicaragua.

592
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,981
No artificial sweeteners.

593
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:56,609
What the hell are you talking about?

594
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:58,986
Who are you talking to?

595
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:02,156
I've tasted other cocoas.
This is the best.

596
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:05,993
What the hell does this have to do
with anything?

597
00:54:06,786 --> 00:54:08,788
Tell me what's happening!

598
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:12,417
You're having a nervous breakdown,
that's what's happening.

599
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,710
You're part of this, aren't you?

600
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:18,881
- Truman.
- Meryl!

601
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:21,968
You are scaring me.

602
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:24,679
No. You're scaring me, Meryl.

603
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:28,891
What are you going to do? Dice me?
Slice me and peel me?

604
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:31,394
There are so many choices!

605
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,813
<i>Do something!</i>

606
00:54:35,106 --> 00:54:36,190
<i>What?</i>

607
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,860
<i>What did you say?</i>

608
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:42,321
- Who were you talking to?
- Nothing. I didn't say anything.

609
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:44,073
I didn't say anything.

610
00:54:44,157 --> 00:54:47,452
- You said "do something."
- No, I didn't. I wasn't talking to anybody.

611
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:50,913
- Talk to me!
- I don't know anything. Please stop.

612
00:54:50,997 --> 00:54:52,582
Stay where you are.

613
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:55,251
Truman?

614
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:57,962
Truman.

615
00:54:58,588 --> 00:55:02,258
Oh, thank God!

616
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:10,183
How can anyone expect me to carry on
under these conditions?

617
00:55:10,475 --> 00:55:12,477
It's unprofessional.

618
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:14,729
It's okay.

619
00:55:17,607 --> 00:55:21,861
Everything's going to be okay.
It's all gonna be fine.

620
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:27,575
I don't know what to think, Marlon.

621
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:33,915
Maybe I'm losing my mind, but...

622
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:41,589
It feels like the whole world
revolves around me somehow.

623
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:46,677
That's a lot of world for one man,
Truman.

624
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,932
Sure that's not wishful thinking?

625
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:54,393
You wishing you'd made something
more out of yourself?

626
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,438
Come on, who hasn't sat in the john,

627
00:55:57,522 --> 00:56:00,233
had an imaginary interview
on <i>Seahaven Tonight?</i>

628
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:03,528
- Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
- This is different.

629
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:05,613
Everybody seems to be in on it.

630
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:13,454
I've been your best friend
since we were 7 years old, Truman.

631
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:15,748
The only way you and I
ever made it through school

632
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:18,459
was by cheating off each other's
test papers.

633
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:21,379
Jesus, they were identical.

634
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:25,883
But I always felt safe knowing that.

635
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:29,929
'Cause whatever the answer was,
we were right together,

636
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:31,973
and we were wrong together.

637
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:36,686
Remember that time I stayed up
with you all night in your tent

638
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:39,063
because you wanted to play North Pole?

639
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,232
And I got pneumonia?

640
00:56:43,276 --> 00:56:44,652
You remember that?

641
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:47,989
You were out of school for
about a month.

642
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,164
You're the closest thing I ever had
to a brother, Truman.

643
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:05,298
I know that things

644
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:10,553
haven't really worked out for either of us
like we used to dream they would.

645
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:15,349
I know that feeling, when it's like
everything's slipping away

646
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:18,728
and you don't want to believe it,

647
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:22,064
so you look for answers
somewhere else, but...

648
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:30,072
The point is,

649
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,409
I'd gladly walk in front of traffic for you.

650
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:43,252
<i>The point is, I would gladly
step in front of traffic for you, Truman.</i>

651
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,673
And the last thing I'd ever do
is lie to you.

652
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:52,678
And the last thing that I would ever do

653
00:57:55,556 --> 00:57:56,807
is lie to you.

654
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:02,063
I mean, think about it, Truman.

655
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:04,357
If everybody is in on it,

656
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:09,028
I'd have to be in on it, too.

657
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,247
I'm not in on it, Truman, because

658
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,042
there is no "it."

659
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,548
You were right about one thing, though.

660
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:31,592
What's that?

661
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:35,346
The thing that started all this.

662
00:58:50,778 --> 00:58:53,572
Yep. I found him for you, Truman.

663
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,866
That's why I came by tonight.

664
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:59,120
I'm sure he's got quite a story to tell.

665
00:59:02,957 --> 00:59:04,291
Go to him.

666
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:12,466
Easy on the fog.

667
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,178
Stand by, crane cam.

668
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:19,014
Crane cam.

669
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:28,357
Button cam 3.

670
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,955
I never stopped believing.

671
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:49,044
And wide, curb cam 8.

672
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:50,880
My son.

673
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:54,675
- Move in for a close-up?
- No.

674
00:59:56,677 --> 00:59:58,095
Move back

675
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:00,723
and fade up music.

676
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,147
And now go in close.

677
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:11,317
<i>All those years wasted.</i>

678
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:16,864
<i>I'll make it up to you, son. I swear.</i>

679
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,205
<i>Dad.</i>

680
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:26,707
Yes!

681
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:37,676
Bravo.

682
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,262
That will win the ratings period.

683
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,056
Congratulations.

684
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,225
Okay, everybody, quiet down.
Let's concentrate.

685
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:46,101
- Great television.
- That was good work.

686
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,979
Let's get some champagne up here.

687
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:50,523
Congratulations.

688
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:55,528
- Well done, Christof.
- It was brilliant. It just broke my heart.

689
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,866
- Well done, everyone!
- Bravo!

690
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:02,243
Congratulations.

691
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:23,597
<i>1.7 billion were there for his birth.</i>

692
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,021
<i>220 countries tuned in for his first step.</i>

693
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:34,483
<i>The world stood still forth at stolen kiss.</i>

694
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:37,111
<i>And as he grew, so did the technology.</i>

695
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,280
<i>An entire human life</i>

696
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:42,366
<i>recorded on an intricate network
of hidden cameras</i>

697
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:46,287
<i>and broadcast live and unedited,
24 hours a day,</i>

698
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:49,456
<i>seven days a week,
to an audience around the globe.</i>

699
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:53,127
<i>Coming to you now
from Seahaven island,</i>

700
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:56,589
<i>enclosed in the largest studio
ever constructed,</i>

701
01:01:56,672 --> 01:01:58,924
<i>and along with the Great Wall of China,</i>

702
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:02,303
<i>one of only two manmade structures
visible from space,</i>

703
01:02:03,012 --> 01:02:06,223
<i>now in its 30th great year,</i>

704
01:02:06,307 --> 01:02:08,225
<i>it's</i> The Truman Show.

705
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,857
What a week it's been.
I don't know about you,

706
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,901
I was on pins and needles
the entire time.

707
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:20,154
<i>Hello and good evening.
I'm your host Mike Michaelson,</i>

708
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:21,614
<i>and welcome to</i> Trutalk.

709
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:24,199
<i>Our forum for issues growing
out of the show.</i>

710
01:02:24,283 --> 01:02:26,869
<i>But tonight,
something very special indeed.</i>

711
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:31,248
A rare and exclusive interview
with the show's conceiver and creator.

712
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:35,294
So come with us now as we go live
to the lunar room

713
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:38,756
<i>on the 221st floor
of the Omni-cam ecosphere.</i>

714
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:42,468
<i>That's where we'll find the world's
greatest tele-visionary.</i>

715
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:45,596
<i>The designer and architect
of the world within a world</i>

716
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,806
<i>that is Seahaven Island: Christof</i>

717
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:52,102
<i>Before we begin, I'd like to thank you
on behalf of our audience,</i>

718
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:54,021
<i>for granting this exclusive interview.</i>

719
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,357
<i>We know how demanding
your schedule is</i>

720
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,318
<i>and we all know how jealously
you guard your privacy.</i>

721
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:01,695
<i>This, sir, is indeed an honor.</i>

722
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:03,238
<i>Don't mention it.</i>

723
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:06,241
<i>The catalyst for the recent
dramatic events on the show</i>

724
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:08,410
<i>has been Truman's father, Kirk,</i>

725
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:11,872
<i>and his attempts to infiltrate the show.
But before we get into that,</i>

726
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:14,625
<i>I think it's worth noting
this is not the first time</i>

727
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:18,045
<i>someone from the outside
has attempted to reach Truman, is it?</i>

728
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,005
<i>We have had our close calls in the past.</i>

729
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:23,175
Truman! It's television! Yes!

730
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:27,096
Yes! I did it! I'm on <i>The Truman Show!</i>

731
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:29,932
<i>But there's never been anything
to compare with</i>

732
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,976
<i>this most recent breach in security.</i>

733
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:35,229
<i>The first intruder
to be a former cast member.</i>

734
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:36,981
A dead one at that.

735
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:40,651
<i>Got to say, writing Kirk back in,
masterstroke.</i>

736
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:43,612
<i>Since Kirk started this whole crisis
in Truman's life,</i>

737
01:03:43,696 --> 01:03:46,991
<i>I came to the conclusion that he was
the only one who could end it.</i>

738
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:48,200
Truman!

739
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:49,576
Truman, no!

740
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:51,745
That's off-limits.

741
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:55,541
- Why? What's over there?
- Nothing. It's dangerous. That's all.

742
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:58,002
You've got to know
your limitations, Truman.

743
01:03:58,085 --> 01:04:02,214
<i>But let's remind viewers of exactly why
Dad was written out in the first place.</i>

744
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:05,676
<i>As Truman grew up,
we were forced to manufacture ways</i>

745
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,511
<i>to keep him on the island.</i>

746
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:10,514
I'd like to be an explorer,
like the great Magellan.

747
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:12,099
You're too late.

748
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,560
There's really nothing left to explore.

749
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:21,692
<i>Finally, I came up with the concept
of Kirk's drowning.</i>

750
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:24,903
<i>Most effective. Truman's been
terrified of the water ever since.</i>

751
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:27,823
<i>When Kirk read the synopsis
for the</i> Death At Sea <i>episode,</i>

752
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:31,368
<i>he was disappointed, to say the least.</i>

753
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:35,039
<i>I'm sure that's what caused him
to break back onto the set.</i>

754
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:38,459
<i>But how do you intend to explain
his 22-year absence?</i>

755
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,671
- Amnesia.
- <i>Brilliant.</i>

756
01:04:43,464 --> 01:04:45,299
<i>Let's take some viewer phone calls.</i>

757
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:48,302
<i>Charlotte, North Carolina,
you're on with Christof</i>

758
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,846
<i>Yeah, hi, Christof</i>

759
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:54,641
<i>I was just wondering how many
cameras you got there in that town.</i>

760
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,227
<i>Somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000.</i>

761
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:02,357
<i>-That's a lot of cameras.
- Remember, we started with just one.</i>

762
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:06,153
<i>He was curious from birth.</i>

763
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:10,783
<i>Premature by two weeks. It was almost
as if he couldn't wait to get started.</i>

764
01:05:10,866 --> 01:05:13,160
<i>And his eagerness to leave
his mother's womb</i>

765
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,746
<i>was the very reason he was the one
who was selected.</i>

766
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:18,540
<i>In competition
with five other unwanted pregnancies,</i>

767
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:21,418
<i>the casting of a show,
determined by an air date,</i>

768
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:23,837
<i>Truman was the one who
arrived on cue.</i>

769
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:31,512
<i>Incidentally, I believe
Truman is the first child</i>

770
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:34,098
<i>to have been legally adopted
by a corporation.</i>

771
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:35,307
<i>That's correct.</i>

772
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:37,768
<i>The show has generated
enormous revenues,</i>

773
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:41,105
<i>now equivalent to the gross national
product of a small country.</i>

774
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:42,356
<i>People forget it takes</i>

775
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:45,150
<i>the population of an entire country
to keep the show running.</i>

776
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:48,904
<i>Since the show is on 24 hours a day
without commercial interruption,</i>

777
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:52,533
<i>all those staggering revenues
are generated by product placement.</i>

778
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:55,285
<i>That's true.
Everything on the show is for sale.</i>

779
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:58,664
<i>From the actors' wardrobe, food
products, to the very homes they live in.</i>

780
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:01,083
<i>All of it available in the</i> Truman <i>catalog</i>

781
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,543
<i>and operators are standing by.</i>

782
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:04,378
<i>Christof, let me ask you.</i>

783
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:08,048
<i>Why do you think
that Truman has never come close</i>

784
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:11,677
<i>to discovering the true nature
of his world until now?</i>

785
01:06:12,136 --> 01:06:15,180
<i>We accept the reality of the world
with which we are presented.</i>

786
01:06:15,264 --> 01:06:16,890
<i>It's as simple as that.</i>

787
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:19,143
<i>The Hague for Christof</i>

788
01:06:19,226 --> 01:06:21,436
<i>Hello? The Hague?</i>

789
01:06:22,938 --> 01:06:26,525
<i>All right, we've lost that call. Let's go
to Hollywood. You're on</i> Trutalk.

790
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:29,236
Hi, I'd just like to say one thing.

791
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,988
You're a liar and a manipulator.

792
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:33,365
<i>And what you've done to Truman
is sick.</i>

793
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:37,035
<i>We remember this voice, don't we?</i>

794
01:06:38,287 --> 01:06:40,789
<i>-How could we forget?
- Let's go to another call.</i>

795
01:06:40,873 --> 01:06:44,168
<i>No. It's fine, Mike.</i>

796
01:06:44,585 --> 01:06:47,504
<i>I love to reminisce
with former members of the cast.</i>

797
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:50,007
<i>Sylvia,</i>

798
01:06:50,966 --> 01:06:53,802
<i>as you announced
so melodramatically to the world,</i>

799
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:58,348
<i>you think because you batted your eyes
at Truman once,</i>

800
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:01,185
<i>flirted with him,</i>

801
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:03,812
<i>stole a few minutes of air time with him</i>

802
01:07:03,896 --> 01:07:07,065
<i>to thrust yourself and your politics
into the limelight,</i>

803
01:07:07,149 --> 01:07:10,861
<i>that you know him?
That you know what's right for him?</i>

804
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,989
<i>You really think you're in a position
to judge him?</i>

805
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:16,200
What right do you have to take a baby

806
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:18,952
and turn his life
into some kind of mockery?

807
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,580
Don't you ever feel guilty?

808
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:27,002
<i>I have given Truman a chance
to lead a normal life.</i>

809
01:07:28,337 --> 01:07:31,381
<i>The world, the place you live in,</i>

810
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:33,884
<i>is the sick place.</i>

811
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:38,055
<i>Seahaven is the way
the world should be.</i>

812
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:41,850
He's not a performer. He's a prisoner.
Look at what you've done to him!

813
01:07:41,934 --> 01:07:43,644
<i>He could leave at any time.</i>

814
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:46,396
<i>If his was more than
just a vague ambition,</i>

815
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,067
<i>if he was absolutely determined
to discover the truth,</i>

816
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:53,487
<i>there's no way we could prevent him.</i>

817
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:56,448
<i>I think what distresses you,</i>

818
01:07:57,407 --> 01:08:00,661
<i>really, caller, is that ultimately</i>

819
01:08:01,912 --> 01:08:05,540
<i>Truman prefers his cell, as you call it.</i>

820
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:07,668
That's where you're wrong.

821
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:10,921
You're so wrong,
and he'll prove you wrong.

822
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:15,550
<i>Aside from the heated comments
of a very vocal minority,</i>

823
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:18,470
<i>it's been
an overwhelmingly positive experience.</i>

824
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:21,014
<i>Yes. For Truman
and for the viewing public.</i>

825
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:23,016
<i>Christof, I can't thank you enough</i>

826
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,560
<i>forgiving so generously
of your time tonight.</i>

827
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:28,522
<i>I think it's safe to say that
now that this crisis is behind us</i>

828
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,274
<i>and that Truman's back to his old self,</i>

829
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:33,694
<i>we can look forward
to some exciting new developments.</i>

830
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:37,114
<i>Mike, the big news is
that Meryl will be leaving Truman</i>

831
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:38,782
<i>in an upcoming episode.</i>

832
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:41,535
<i>And a new romantic interest
will be introduced.</i>

833
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:46,540
<i>I'm determined that television's first
on-air conception will still take place.</i>

834
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:50,961
<i>Another television milestone
straight ahead. You heard it here first.</i>

835
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,797
<i>It has been a singular honor
and a pleasure, sir.</i>

836
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,466
<i>-Christof, thank you.
- Thank you, Mike.</i>

837
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,546
- Simeon.
- What?

838
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,511
Is he looking at us?

839
01:10:22,928 --> 01:10:24,888
Jesus, do you think he knows?

840
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:27,307
<i>Hello?</i>

841
01:10:27,808 --> 01:10:29,351
Better call Christof.

842
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:31,478
<i>Hello? Come in, Major Burbank.</i>

843
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:44,658
Jesus.

844
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,915
- He's back to his old self.
- Thank God.

845
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:02,217
That's an unusual cat, my man.

846
01:11:07,097 --> 01:11:10,350
<i>I hereby pro claim this planet...</i>

847
01:11:15,105 --> 01:11:17,899
<i>Trumania of the Burbank galaxy.</i>

848
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,696
- Is he gonna go?
- Okay, hallway camera ready.

849
01:11:24,573 --> 01:11:25,949
<i>That one's for free.</i>

850
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:27,993
Keep up with him,
'cause he'll move fast.

851
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:30,203
Stand by, all house cameras.

852
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:33,457
- Morning!
- Good morning.

853
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,292
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

854
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,043
In case I don't see you...

855
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:39,671
Good afternoon, good evening,
and good night.

856
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,468
- Good afternoon...
- Good morning.

857
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:46,678
...evening and good night.

858
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:49,473
- Morning, Truman.
- Morning, Spencer.

859
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:51,850
- How's it going?
- Let me check.

860
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:54,186
Vital signs are good.

861
01:11:56,563 --> 01:11:57,814
Pluto!

862
01:11:58,356 --> 01:11:59,983
Good morning, Truman.

863
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:02,819
- Look who's here.
- Beautiful day, isn't it?

864
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:04,237
Every single day.

865
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:07,240
The policy, we've thought about it
and we're gonna take it.

866
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:08,617
- You're kidding?
- No!

867
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,453
Why don't we go up to my office
right now and we'll sign the papers?

868
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:14,164
Next week would be much better.

869
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:17,459
- All right. See you guys.
- Okay, bye now. See you next week.

870
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:20,212
- Give me something to look forward to.
- You got it.

871
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:22,005
See, this isn't about insurance.

872
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:26,593
This is about the great variable:
when will death occur?

873
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:29,012
Could be a week, a month, a year.

874
01:12:30,055 --> 01:12:31,306
Could be today.

875
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,852
"Sunbather, minding his own business,

876
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:39,773
"stabbed in the heart by the tip
of a runaway beach umbrella."

877
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:42,400
No way to guard against
that kind of thing.

878
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:46,029
Sorry, excuse me.

879
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:48,532
Truman, this is Vivien.
Vivien, this is Truman.

880
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:50,951
The two of you are gonna be neighbors.

881
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:58,750
I guess what I'm saying is that life is

882
01:12:59,543 --> 01:13:00,794
fragile.

883
01:13:02,546 --> 01:13:04,172
- Vivien, your office.
- Sorry.

884
01:13:04,256 --> 01:13:07,300
What's that? I'm sorry.

885
01:13:08,343 --> 01:13:09,469
You do?

886
01:13:10,345 --> 01:13:13,306
Great. Let me take your information.

887
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:31,241
Ready, 2. Go to 2.

888
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:37,163
And back to medium.

889
01:13:39,207 --> 01:13:40,584
And wide.

890
01:13:48,592 --> 01:13:51,344
I was just trying to train the kid to...

891
01:13:52,262 --> 01:13:53,597
Never mind.

892
01:13:56,808 --> 01:13:58,852
What's he doing in the basement?

893
01:13:59,144 --> 01:14:01,646
He moved down there
after Meryl packed up and left.

894
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:03,148
Why wasn't I told?

895
01:14:03,231 --> 01:14:05,859
Any unpredictable behavior
has to be reported.

896
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:09,154
He's just sleeping, I thought.

897
01:14:09,237 --> 01:14:11,781
- This the best shot we've got?
- What's to see?

898
01:14:11,865 --> 01:14:15,493
- What's on the clock cam?
- It's an obstruction.

899
01:14:15,994 --> 01:14:19,748
- What happened down there?
- He was just tidying up his garbage.

900
01:14:20,749 --> 01:14:24,711
I was gonna call you, but halfway
through, he gave up, and he fell asleep.

901
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:28,256
I wanna check on the setups
for the insurance convention tomorrow.

902
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:29,716
- Yes.
- Yeah.

903
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:32,052
Nice move.

904
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:42,395
There you go.

905
01:14:53,365 --> 01:14:54,741
Isolate the audio.

906
01:14:56,076 --> 01:14:58,078
Give me a close-up on his torso.

907
01:15:00,914 --> 01:15:02,415
He's still breathing.

908
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:06,294
Where's Chloe? Call him.

909
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:09,756
- What do you want me to say?
- Tell him it's a wrong number.

910
01:15:13,218 --> 01:15:14,803
What took you so long?

911
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:17,806
Just had to wait for it. They were busy.

912
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:21,142
Here. What's going on?

913
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,728
I don't know. They're...

914
01:15:23,895 --> 01:15:26,856
He came down into the room. He did
nothing but stand around for a while.

915
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,441
Shut up and watch it.

916
01:15:29,067 --> 01:15:31,152
Then we went to night vision.

917
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:33,363
He's asleep.

918
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:36,241
- There!
- What?

919
01:15:36,658 --> 01:15:38,410
- Zoom in.
- On which?

920
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,328
Under the chair there.

921
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:44,124
Enhance it.

922
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:49,170
- Is it...
- My God.

923
01:15:50,964 --> 01:15:54,092
He couldn't have gone up the stairs.
He must still be in the room.

924
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:55,802
- Get Marlon over there.
- Right away.

925
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:12,652
Truman!

926
01:16:13,528 --> 01:16:14,821
Surprise party!

927
01:16:16,865 --> 01:16:18,158
Come on, buddy.

928
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:21,536
I got a six-pack of cold brewskis
with our name on them.

929
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:23,955
Come on, pal. Come on, buddy.

930
01:16:27,959 --> 01:16:29,043
Shit.

931
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:34,841
Marlon, find him. He's still in the room.

932
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:41,139
<i>Come out, come out, wherever you are.</i>

933
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:43,016
That's good. Keep it light.

934
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:46,394
<i>I know you're in here.
I'm gonna find you.</i>

935
01:16:49,981 --> 01:16:51,566
Check under the table.

936
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:54,611
The closet, behind you.

937
01:16:58,615 --> 01:16:59,616
Huh.

938
01:17:01,409 --> 01:17:02,410
Gee.

939
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:05,497
I wonder where he could possibly be.

940
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:15,673
The lawn cam, get me the lawn cam.

941
01:17:23,348 --> 01:17:26,017
Don't look in the camera.
Say something. Keep it going.

942
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,227
<i>He's gone.</i>

943
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:29,562
- Cut transmission!
- Cut transmission?

944
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:30,897
Cut it!

945
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:35,151
Jesus! God in heaven!

946
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:39,072
- Everything's black.
- Give me the phone.

947
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:54,128
I don't know where he is, but he's gone.

948
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:03,596
All right. We've got
every available extra looking for him.

949
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,976
The principals are helping out. The
crew, too. So every sector's covered.

950
01:18:08,643 --> 01:18:11,354
- What about prop cars?
- Yes, they've been accounted for.

951
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:12,856
He has to be on foot.

952
01:18:12,939 --> 01:18:15,859
He has the world's most
recognizable face. He can't disappear.

953
01:18:51,728 --> 01:18:52,812
Go.

954
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:57,317
Hunt him. Yeah. Go find him, Pluto.

955
01:18:57,901 --> 01:18:59,110
Good dog!

956
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:00,445
All this fuss.

957
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:03,281
If he could just hear my voice.

958
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,450
Truman!

959
01:19:08,578 --> 01:19:10,872
Let me try. Truman!

960
01:19:12,165 --> 01:19:14,000
It's me, Dad!

961
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:17,503
Let's talk.

962
01:19:19,172 --> 01:19:20,673
Yeah, I know.

963
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:24,302
Just about done with the square.

964
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:26,971
<i>Got to go back to Barrymore,
check the interiors.</i>

965
01:19:27,055 --> 01:19:29,265
- <i>He's got to be in there.</i>
- Barrymore.

966
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,809
But what about the college?
Who's watching that?

967
01:19:31,893 --> 01:19:32,894
<i>I don't know.</i>

968
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:35,313
- Send somebody over there, okay?
- <i>All right.</i>

969
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:41,945
Take another man
and get down there now, all right?

970
01:19:42,028 --> 01:19:44,280
I don't give a damn.
Just find the son of a bitch.

971
01:19:44,364 --> 01:19:45,323
Get some batteries.

972
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:48,117
This guy's not gonna glow in the dark.
Get them down here.

973
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:50,912
I don't know what's going on.
Reroute it back to me.

974
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:54,207
We need more light.
We'll never find him this way.

975
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:00,880
What time is it?

976
01:20:01,214 --> 01:20:03,508
It's way too early for that.

977
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:11,391
Cue the sun.

978
01:20:17,981 --> 01:20:19,357
What time is it?

979
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:22,068
Christof, what's going on?

980
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:25,571
Did you know there's a rumor
circulating that he's dead?

981
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:26,823
You hear me?

982
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:29,200
The media is having a feeding frenzy
over this.

983
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:31,035
All the phone lines are jammed,

984
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:32,704
and every network has a pirated shot

985
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:35,039
of Marlon making an ass of himself
in front of the camera.

986
01:20:35,123 --> 01:20:37,333
The sponsors are threatening
to rip up their contracts.

987
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:38,835
Why? We're getting higher ratings
with this graphic

988
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:42,005
than we've ever had on this show.

989
01:20:44,924 --> 01:20:46,217
<i>No sign of him.</i>

990
01:20:46,384 --> 01:20:49,178
Marlon, why don't you head back to town
and join the others?

991
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:52,223
Everyone else is at first positions, okay?
Thank you.

992
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:55,977
Everyone's at first positions, right?

993
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:14,871
We've got the light.
So he's got to be there somewhere.

994
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:19,375
We're not watching the sea.

995
01:21:19,459 --> 01:21:22,003
Hang on a minute.
Why would we watch the sea?

996
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:23,963
Sweep the harbor.

997
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,673
Bring up the harbor cameras.

998
01:21:25,757 --> 01:21:28,092
Shift all harbor cameras to computer,
please.

999
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:29,802
Some of those are out, aren't they?

1000
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:33,306
Yeah. We have four of them down,
but we have the lighthouse cameras up.

1001
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:35,850
- All buoy cams, please.
- What's happening?

1002
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:38,603
Long-lens, shore-based cameras.

1003
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:40,730
- Why are we looking at the water?
- Good.

1004
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,648
Pan and zoom please.

1005
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:47,320
Truman,

1006
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:50,990
where are you going?

1007
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,827
How can he sail? He's in insurance.

1008
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:57,413
- Isn't he terrified of the water?
- Resume transmission.

1009
01:21:57,497 --> 01:21:59,082
Resuming transmission.

1010
01:22:04,295 --> 01:22:07,423
- I got 2-to-1 he doesn't make it.
- I want a piece of that.

1011
01:22:07,507 --> 01:22:09,592
2-to-1 he doesn't make it.

1012
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:13,679
Just leave them in the car.

1013
01:22:26,734 --> 01:22:30,613
Let's get off this mast shot. We can't
see his face. Go to the cabin cam.

1014
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:35,159
There. Perfect.

1015
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:37,662
That's our hero shot.

1016
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:05,064
Let's get another boat out there.

1017
01:23:05,148 --> 01:23:08,401
Okay. Listen, Gus, I need you to talk
to the guys on the ferry.

1018
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:11,028
Come on. Get it moving.
Get it out of here.

1019
01:23:13,281 --> 01:23:14,532
Come on.

1020
01:23:15,116 --> 01:23:18,744
- I'm usually the bus driver.
- Bottom line is they can't drive the boat.

1021
01:23:18,953 --> 01:23:20,246
They're actors.

1022
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:26,169
How do we stop him?

1023
01:23:36,596 --> 01:23:37,805
Okay.

1024
01:23:40,308 --> 01:23:43,936
We're going to be accessing
the weather program now.

1025
01:23:44,604 --> 01:23:48,274
So hold onto your hats. You got that?

1026
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:52,945
No. I think we're gonna want to localize
the storm over the boat.

1027
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:58,034
You can get the coordinates for that.

1028
01:23:58,117 --> 01:24:00,745
There's no rescue boat.
He won't know what to do.

1029
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:03,122
He'll turn back. He'll be too afraid.

1030
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:07,919
Thar she blows.

1031
01:24:19,764 --> 01:24:20,932
Come on.

1032
01:24:44,664 --> 01:24:46,165
Give me some lightning.

1033
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:48,417
Again.

1034
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,211
Hit him again!

1035
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:04,183
For God's sake,
the whole world is watching.

1036
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:06,435
We can't let him die
in front of a live audience.

1037
01:25:06,519 --> 01:25:08,354
He was born in front of a live audience.

1038
01:25:36,966 --> 01:25:38,801
Come on, Truman!

1039
01:25:42,388 --> 01:25:44,724
You can do it! Hold on!

1040
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:12,084
Is that the best you can do?

1041
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:16,756
You're gonna have to kill me!

1042
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:20,176
<i>What shall we do with a drunken sailor?</i>

1043
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:22,845
- I demand that you cease transmission.
- Keep running.

1044
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:27,266
<i>What shall we do with a drunken sailor
Early in the mornin'?</i>

1045
01:26:27,475 --> 01:26:30,019
Increase the wind.

1046
01:26:32,438 --> 01:26:34,899
- I'm telling you for the last time.
- How close is he?

1047
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:36,400
- Very close.
- Capsize him. Tip him over.

1048
01:26:36,484 --> 01:26:39,362
- Damn you, Christof!
- You can't. He's tied himself to the boat!

1049
01:26:39,445 --> 01:26:40,446
Shut up!

1050
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,323
He's gonna drown,
and he doesn't even care.

1051
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:43,532
- Do it.
- No.

1052
01:26:43,616 --> 01:26:44,617
Do it!

1053
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:40,548
That's enough.

1054
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:53,133
I want to talk to him.

1055
01:32:12,111 --> 01:32:13,320
Truman.

1056
01:32:15,114 --> 01:32:16,407
You can speak.

1057
01:32:18,492 --> 01:32:19,785
<i>I can hear you.</i>

1058
01:32:24,331 --> 01:32:25,457
Who are you?

1059
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:28,127
I am the creator of a television show

1060
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:31,213
that gives hope and joy and inspiration
to millions.

1061
01:32:36,135 --> 01:32:37,386
<i>Then who am I?</i>

1062
01:32:37,803 --> 01:32:39,179
You're the star.

1063
01:32:45,269 --> 01:32:46,645
<i>Was nothing real?</i>

1064
01:32:47,271 --> 01:32:48,522
You were real.

1065
01:32:49,982 --> 01:32:52,276
That's what made you so good to watch.

1066
01:32:52,985 --> 01:32:54,528
Listen to me, Truman.

1067
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:56,822
There's no more truth out there

1068
01:32:57,906 --> 01:33:00,534
than there is in the world
I created for you.

1069
01:33:02,494 --> 01:33:04,037
<i>The same lies,</i>

1070
01:33:05,748 --> 01:33:07,082
<i>the same deceit.</i>

1071
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:09,460
But in my world

1072
01:33:11,295 --> 01:33:13,005
you have nothing to fear.

1073
01:33:16,383 --> 01:33:18,927
<i>I know you better than
you know yourself</i>

1074
01:33:19,011 --> 01:33:21,138
You never had a camera in my head.

1075
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,183
You're afraid.

1076
01:33:25,476 --> 01:33:27,269
That's why you can't leave.

1077
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,358
It's okay, Truman.

1078
01:33:34,485 --> 01:33:35,736
I understand.

1079
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:40,032
I have been watching you
your whole life.

1080
01:33:42,826 --> 01:33:44,953
I was watching when you were born.

1081
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:49,917
I was watching
when you took your first step.

1082
01:33:54,213 --> 01:33:56,715
<i>I watched you on your first day
of school.</i>

1083
01:33:59,593 --> 01:34:02,137
The episode when you lost
your first tooth.

1084
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,310
You can't leave, Truman.

1085
01:34:09,937 --> 01:34:11,355
Please, God.

1086
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:12,898
<i>You belong here...</i>

1087
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:14,316
You can do it.

1088
01:34:16,235 --> 01:34:17,444
...with me.

1089
01:34:19,947 --> 01:34:21,240
Talk to me.

1090
01:34:22,616 --> 01:34:23,867
Say something.

1091
01:34:28,288 --> 01:34:31,416
Say something, God damn it.
You're on television.

1092
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:33,794
<i>You're live to the whole world.</i>

1093
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:53,272
In case I don't see you,

1094
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:56,984
good afternoon, good evening,
and good night.

1095
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:01,238
Yeah.

1096
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:25,762
Yeah!

1097
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:38,525
- He made it! Yeah!
- All right, Truman!

1098
01:35:48,368 --> 01:35:50,871
- Cease transmission.
- Ceasing transmission.

1099
01:35:55,584 --> 01:35:57,878
- You want another slice?
- No. I'm okay.

1100
01:35:58,712 --> 01:36:00,714
What else is on?
Where's the <i>TV Guide?</i>
