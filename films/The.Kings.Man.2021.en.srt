1
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,751
Your grace.

2
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,746
(Indistinct chatter)

3
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,590
Sergeant, I'm here on behalf
of the red cross

4
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:14,433
and I'd like to speak
with general kitchener.

5
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,344
There is no general kitchener here.

6
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,846
Your grace? Your grace?
Let... let him in.

7
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,701
Well, if Morton's here,
then kitchener can't be far away.

8
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,685
My apologies, your grace.

9
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,187
Security's Paramount right now.

10
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,439
It's a secret that you're
visiting with the general.

11
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:30,316
We can't be too careful
with these boers

12
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,734
and their guerrilla tactics.

13
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:32,902
Too careful?

14
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:35,613
Looks like this place
could use a lot more care.

15
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:38,157
Begging your pardon, sir,
but these concentration camps

16
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,468
are the reason we're winning this war.

17
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,785
This way.

18
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:49,418
Orlando. Our knight in shining armor.

19
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,379
Thank you for coming.

20
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,381
What's going on, kitchener?

21
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:55,716
It seems that you've been

22
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,069
somewhat liberal with the truth.

23
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,387
Time has not been kind here.

24
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,150
Well, you'll have to explain that
to Emily.

25
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,058
On my return to england,
it will be my first port of call.

26
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:05,226
She's outside,

27
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:07,103
wit/7 Conrad

28
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,939
why are we here, mother?

29
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,484
Do you remember why
king Arthur and his knights

30
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:14,944
had a round table?

31
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:19,156
Because it meant
that all men were equal.

32
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,410
It's important that people
born into privilege

33
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,828
lead by example.

34
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:27,164
That's why your father and I
are patrons of the red cross.

35
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,458
Helping others,

36
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,378
not hiding behind our status.

37
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,884
Never forget that.

38
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:45,724
I'm just going to check on your father.

39
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,521
Stay here, Conrad.

40
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,529
This terrible war would be over, shola,

41
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:02,825
if king Arthur and his
noble knights were still here.

42
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:06,412
(Chuckles) Of course.
And which one would you be?

43
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:09,081
I'd be Lancelot.

44
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,876
Father would be Arthur.
Mother, Guinevere.

45
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,045
And you, the mighty Merlin.

46
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,130
Really?

47
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:20,718
Emily: This is ridiculous.
We're wasting precious time.

48
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,928
Look around, people are dying.

49
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,055
We have emergency supplies
from the red cross.

50
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,807
Thank god she's on our side.

51
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,225
Well, on my side, at least.

52
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,578
Kitchener: She's more of a force

53
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,871
than any of our enemies.
(Chuckles)

54
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,354
There's general kitchener.

55
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,774
Well, open the gates!
Bring in those supplies!

56
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,401
Emily!

57
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,612
- (Gunshot)
- (Groans)

58
00:04:41,238 --> 00:04:43,240
(People clamoring)

59
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:45,659
Lie down until I get back.

60
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,703
(Guns firing)

61
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,339
Go back to Conrad.

62
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,473
Go to hell, kitchener.

63
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,725
(Yelling)

64
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:15,356
Shola: I got him! Stop fire!

65
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,321
Emily!

66
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:25,115
Soldier: Cease fire!

67
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,534
(Firing stops)

68
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,701
(Groans)

69
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:29,995
Emily.

70
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:32,998
Darling, I'm here.

71
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:39,213
I'm here. Darling, I'm here.

72
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,008
That's it. I'm here.
You have to stay with me.

73
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:45,302
You have to stay with me.

74
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,595
Darling?

75
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,058
Protect our son.

76
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:56,605
Protect him from this world. And...

77
00:05:57,731 --> 00:06:00,067
Never let him see war again.

78
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,034
Promise me.

79
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,912
I promise.

80
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:29,531
(Engine whirring)

81
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,305
- You know, Conrad...
- Hmm?

82
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,308
Up there, I feel free.

83
00:07:56,392 --> 00:08:00,020
Yes, I'm very much looking foward
to my first solo flight.

84
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,189
Remember what happened
to icarus, Conrad,

85
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:04,525
when he flew too close to the sun.

86
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,903
Well, I remember him
needing to escape, no?

87
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:10,030
(Laughing) Well, he got burned.

88
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,866
I think we both see
that story differently.

89
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,993
- Welcome home, your grace.
- Thank you, shola.

90
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:19,373
- Afternoon, everyone.
- All: Afternoon, your grace.

91
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,724
Ready for your maiden flight yet, shola?

92
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,836
Well, if god wanted man to fly,

93
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,170
he would have given him wings.

94
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,257
Yes, I suppose.
You drive father's car?

95
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,675
Shola: Mmm-hmm.

96
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,844
You haven't any wheels.

97
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:45,314
Nanny Watkins.

98
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:49,611
My study in five minutes.

99
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:54,575
Your grace.

100
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,545
Your grace.

101
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:09,465
I should be reprimanding you
for your insolence.

102
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:12,593
Your opinion behind closed doors
is one thing, Polly,

103
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:14,887
but I will not tolerate
such demonstrations

104
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,096
in front of my household.

105
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,850
I'll play by your rules
when you play by mine.

106
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:22,102
Do you really think
you can keep secrets from me?

107
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,812
What do you mean?

108
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,857
Once again, you've turned down
cousin Felix's invitation

109
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,817
for Conrad to stay with him in Russia.

110
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:30,861
And how do you know that?

111
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:33,614
Us nannies love a good gossip.

112
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:34,990
And we've all noticed

113
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:37,576
that you've no problem
with Felix traveling here,

114
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:40,370
but you seem to have a problem
with Conrad traveling there.

115
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,039
Or anywhere, for that matter.

116
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,418
Yeah. Guilty as charged.
Well, I'm sorry.

117
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,212
I should have discussed it with you.

118
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:50,839
Has all this flying around in circles

119
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:51,983
made you forget your manners?

120
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:53,634
Well, what have I done now?

121
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:55,260
You haven't even offered me a drink.

122
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,304
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

123
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,682
And if we had discussed this,

124
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,810
what would my opinion have been?

125
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,687
You think that my

126
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,941
fear for Conrad's safety is a weakness.

127
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:10,567
Fear is natural.

128
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,195
The problem is,
the more you fear something,

129
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,072
the more likely it is to come true.

130
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:19,993
Hmm. So, then,
we're both in need of a nanny.

131
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,371
So it would seem.

132
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,171
(Shola yells)

133
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,798
(Both grunting)

134
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,719
Higher!

135
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,604
Can you fight with only one arm?

136
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,314
Oh, yes.

137
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:51,817
If I had someone left to fight.

138
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,613
(Gunshot)

139
00:10:57,447 --> 00:11:00,367
Shola. Do you really think
a knife can beat a bullet?

140
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,328
This is how people
are fighting nowadays.

141
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,705
Now, clean yourselves up

142
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:07,249
before this afternoon's appointment.

143
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:26,810
My father also brought me here
for my first suit.

144
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:30,397
Kingsman, world's finest tailor.

145
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:33,191
(Bell dinging)

146
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:40,240
- Morning.
- Your grace.

147
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,284
Fitting room number one
is ready for you.

148
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,036
Thank you.

149
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,332
Well, here we are.

150
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,002
I wish your mother could see you now.

151
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:54,630
She would've been so proud.

152
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,466
I hope so, father.

153
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,639
Although, I might get more use
out of a shooting suit or

154
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,183
a smoking jacket, you know.

155
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:09,519
Whatever might help
in the pursuit of fine birds.

156
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,105
Oh, come on, father.

157
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,358
It's a big world out there.

158
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:15,442
Sooner or later,

159
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:17,445
you're going to have to
let me enjoy it, even if,

160
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,905
you know, even if you don't want to.

161
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:23,575
You know,

162
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,868
Conrad,

163
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:30,457
our ancestors,
they were terrible people.

164
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:34,795
They robbed, lied, pillaged,
and killed, until one day,

165
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:37,255
they found themselves noblemen.

166
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,716
But that nobility,

167
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,886
it never came from chivalry.

168
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,598
It came from being tough and ruthless.

169
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:51,603
Back then, to be called a "gentleman"

170
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,563
would have been a death sentence.

171
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:59,361
Not the Mark of honor it is today.

172
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,530
We are Oxfords,

173
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,241
not rogues.

174
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:07,995
Kitch en er: Oxford!

175
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,706
- Kitchener.
- (Laughs)

176
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,582
Well, so glad we share the same tailor.

177
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,003
Indeed. Well, the kingsman clientele
is enough to make any club envious.

178
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:19,131
Mmm-hmm. Oxford, can I
borrow you for a moment?

179
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:20,757
Is there somewhere private?

180
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,718
May I suggest the pattern room
upstairs, sir.

181
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,094
Perfect.

182
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:27,097
Conrad, this is Morton,
my aide-de-camp.

183
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,599
Morton, look after
young Conrad for us, will you?

184
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,101
It will be my pleasure, my lord.

185
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:32,185
Good.

186
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,490
I gather you turned down
our Austrian friend

187
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,660
archduke ferdinand's
invitation to his shoot.

188
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:51,580
Surely your pacifism doesn't extend

189
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:53,582
to a few birds, does it?

190
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:55,292
Us bumping into each other here

191
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,335
was no coincidence, was it?

192
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,214
Walls have ears
in whitehall these days.

193
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,177
Which is why I felt kingsman
a safer place for a chat.

194
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,636
Oxford: Mmm-hmm.

195
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,347
I'm worried that ferdinand's
political ambitions

196
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,141
may be putting him in danger.

197
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,187
I need you to do me a small favor.

198
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,272
What sort of favor?

199
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:18,916
Morton: So, you're serious
about being a soldier?

200
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,942
- Oh, yes.
- Which regiment?

201
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,152
Uh... grenadiers.

202
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:23,653
Grenadiers. Well,

203
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,281
when the time comes, contact me.

204
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:27,407
I'll see what I can do.

205
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,825
Oxford: Conrad.

206
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,122
You're going to need
that shooting suit after all.

207
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,804
(Machinery rumbling)

208
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,942
(Alarmed bleating)

209
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,253
My Shepherd.

210
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:25,674
I have a faberge egg
made especially for you.

211
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:27,551
And look inside.

212
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,471
A little replica of Angus,

213
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,348
your favorite goat.

214
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:34,766
Shepherd: You're late.

215
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,352
Take a seat.

216
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,941
What is trust? Hmm?

217
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:47,362
Trust is having confidence

218
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:49,322
in the honesty of another.

219
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:52,993
That will be our weapon

220
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:56,079
to change the world.

221
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,415
Who do I trust?

222
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,418
Animals.

223
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:04,296
They never let me down

224
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:08,383
and they follow my commands blindly.

225
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:11,386
The question I now have is

226
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:16,057
can I trust you to behave like them?

227
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,393
Open the boxes in front of you.

228
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:26,985
These rings will be the symbol
of membership to my flock.

229
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:31,448
Put them on, and you will
share in our successes.

230
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:32,574
But,

231
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:34,576
break my trust,

232
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:37,329
and inside you will find

233
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:40,498
my final gift to you.

234
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,167
Man: A tortoise?

235
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,503
Am I not worthy of a better animal?

236
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,548
Rasputin, I have a bear.
I will happily exchange it with you.

237
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:52,010
Yes, princip.
I will be the great bear of Russia.

238
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:53,720
Take what you believe is yours.

239
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,056
And by all means,

240
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:58,099
treat our Shepherd
with the same respect you hold

241
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,061
for that joke of a man
who calls himself your tsar.

242
00:17:01,144 --> 00:17:04,189
Go ahead, Rasputin, take it.

243
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,566
- I dare you.
- (Shepherd chuckles)

244
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,943
Now, now, mata and Erik.

245
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:10,195
We are a team.

246
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:13,114
And Rasputin here... (Chuckles)

247
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:17,744
Is like my beloved Angus.
(Chuckling)

248
00:17:17,827 --> 00:17:18,870
(Angus bleats)

249
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,122
Shepherd: Always butting

250
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,959
and fucking.

251
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:28,088
(Bleating)

252
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:31,633
But do not mistake fondness
for weakness,

253
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:34,386
you late Russian fuckstick!

254
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:38,014
As everybody knows,

255
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,558
the tortoise

256
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:44,271
eventually wins the race.

257
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:53,613
Shepherd: Now...

258
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,532
(Hawks, spits)

259
00:17:56,199 --> 00:18:00,704
My spy, or should I say my mole,

260
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:03,498
in the British government

261
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:08,044
informs me that kitchener is
concerned for the safety

262
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,130
of the archduke ferdinand.

263
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,634
Princip, my wee bear.

264
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,469
Are you ready to prove

265
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,306
kitchener's concerns are justified?

266
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,225
Yes, I am, my Shepherd.
And I will not let you down.

267
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,061
Shepherd: Damn fucking right.

268
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,229
(Bangs table)

269
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,192
(Rhythmic banging)

270
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,598
(People cheering)

271
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,102
Oxford: Does that make sense
to you, ferdinand?

272
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,313
Archduke ferdinand:
Ah, now I understand

273
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:11,107
why you accepted my shooting invitation.

274
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:15,278
I didn't really believe
kitchener's scare tactics.

275
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,989
Harping on about my being in danger.

276
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,825
Oxford: Well, only a fool ignores
a friend's warning, ferdi.

277
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,369
Is it really too much to ask?

278
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,163
I think you should come back with me
and hear what he has to say.

279
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:28,541
Turning you down is a hard task.

280
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,960
I will give you my decision tonight.

281
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,045
Good.

282
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:55,318
- (People screaming)
- Drive! Drive!

283
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,197
(Indistinct shouting)

284
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,625
Archduke ferdinand:
I come here on a visit of goodwill,

285
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,127
to be greeted by bombs?

286
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,837
(Dignitaries chuckling)

287
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:15,380
Yes. (Clears throat)

288
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:17,882
(Muffled) It gives me
special pleasure...

289
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,051
I... I shouldn't have brought you here.

290
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,513
We need to get home,
where I can protect you.

291
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:24,596
What...

292
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:27,225
I just protected you.
I don't need protecting.

293
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:30,228
Yes, you do, Conrad. I'm sorry,

294
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:32,188
but you think you know
what the world is like,

295
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,731
but the truth is, you're just a boy

296
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,276
who has no idea
what men are capable of.

297
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,154
What? Watching my mother die
wasn't a good enough introduction?

298
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:52,667
(Lively music playing in distance)

299
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,383
(Breathing shakily)

300
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,559
(Horn honks)

301
00:21:09,642 --> 00:21:10,995
Man 1: Are you sure this is right?

302
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,271
Man 2: Just follow my orders.

303
00:21:14,063 --> 00:21:16,357
Take the first left.

304
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,039
Man 1: It's a dead end, you fool.

305
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:32,665
I knew this was the wrong way.

306
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,542
Man 2: I meant the next left.

307
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,466
Oxford: Stop arguing.
We're sitting ducks here.

308
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:38,505
Get this car moving now.

309
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,271
(People screaming)

310
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,880
Father, it's terrible
about ferdi and Sophie.

311
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,467
We're safe now, aren't we?

312
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,844
Yes, but for how long?

313
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:30,139
I'm beginning to understand
what kitchener was so afraid of.

314
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,432
Already there are rumors

315
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,768
the Austrians are mobilizing their army.

316
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:37,313
They don't believe this assassin
acted independently.

317
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:39,691
And neither do I.

318
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:40,817
It's just Serbia.

319
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,620
I mean, it's such
a small part of the world.

320
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,695
Why do they care?

321
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,533
Well, because small things
can grow into big problems.

322
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:50,660
You see, years ago,

323
00:22:50,743 --> 00:22:52,829
there were three young cousins.

324
00:22:52,912 --> 00:22:54,139
The eldest was a real troublemaker...

325
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:55,373
Put my soldier back!

326
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:56,791
There are no rules in war.

327
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:59,127
- I'll teach you war, Wilhelm!
- (All grunting)

328
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,854
Oxford: The/r grandmother
was queen Victoria...

329
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:02,088
Nicholas. Enough!

330
00:23:02,171 --> 00:23:03,440
Oxford: Who kept them in //ne.

331
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:07,093
They grew up to become
kaiser I/I/I/he/m of Germany,

332
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:10,638
tsar Nicholas of Russia,
and king George of eng/and.

333
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,723
(Laughing)

334
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:13,683
Oxford: And now,
poor ferdinand's assassination

335
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:15,810
has given the moronic kaiser

336
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:19,397
a reason to re/gnite
their childhood feud.

337
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:24,444
But surely they've matured
enough to avoid a war?

338
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:26,321
One would hope so.

339
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:29,198
And, thankfully,
we have our own king George

340
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,242
to help keep the peace.

341
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,705
Ah. There it is.

342
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,088
Look at us.

343
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,966
Three young cousins

344
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,177
who thought they knew how to rule.

345
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,471
But now the soldiers are real.

346
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,515
Get two copies of this photograph made

347
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,702
and have them delivered
with these letters immediately.

348
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,561
I'll have Morton see to it personally.

349
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,854
Excellent.

350
00:23:59,937 --> 00:24:01,481
Your majesty.

351
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:07,028
(Swears in German)

352
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:09,072
- (In English) Erik.
- My kaiser.

353
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:13,117
"Restraint is a virtue.
Remember your duty."

354
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:15,662
His majesty, my cousin,
the king of england,

355
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,373
strongly suggests we do nothing.

356
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,879
Remember how prince George
used to enjoy it

357
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:26,172
when your English mother

358
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:28,174
and her English doctors
would torture you?

359
00:24:28,257 --> 00:24:30,593
George would tease you about your...

360
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,554
Deformities.

361
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,391
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

362
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,477
And don't forget
that sniggering at his side

363
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,354
was your little Russian cousin,

364
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,815
tsar Nicholas.

365
00:24:43,898 --> 00:24:46,275
Cousin George
is imploring self-restraint

366
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,237
against our other cousin,
the moronic kaiser.

367
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:52,740
King George has always
protected our interests.

368
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,493
Why would we go to war
over something so trivial?

369
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:57,620
Because we gave Serbia our word.

370
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,914
And besides, I hate the kaiser.

371
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:01,833
It will be good for his oversized ego

372
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:04,043
to match his undersized hand.

373
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,170
(Girls chuckle)

374
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,673
A wise decision, my tsar.

375
00:25:09,215 --> 00:25:12,760
The soul of Russia is safe
in your hands.

376
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:16,013
Erik: The world will laugh at you

377
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,183
for not keeping your word
and standing by the Austrians.

378
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,687
Ignore the English king.

379
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:25,857
Tell George to mind
his own business, ja?

380
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,442
Huh? (Laughing)

381
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,740
If I want a war, then I will have it.

382
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,368
As Russia's ally,

383
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,495
we have no choice but to join this war.

384
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,998
I don't understand.
The kaiser and the tsar

385
00:25:42,081 --> 00:25:44,500
have both ignored
the king's wishes. Why?

386
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,585
That's a good question.

387
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:47,920
- I...
- With all due respect, sir,

388
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,023
this debate should happen
after we have won the war.

389
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:51,191
The prime minister is waiting.

390
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:52,592
And we're late.

391
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,177
Morton's right.

392
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,388
My lord, it would be
my honor to volunteer.

393
00:25:58,514 --> 00:25:59,766
Honor?

394
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,476
Kitchener:
Fine words, young Conrad.

395
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,102
But therein lies the problem.

396
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,980
Legally, you're not old enough
to join up.

397
00:26:06,063 --> 00:26:08,649
Hmm. But still young enough to believe

398
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,444
it's an honorable thing
to die for one's country.

399
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:16,282
The object of war is not
to die for one's country,

400
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:19,452
but to make the enemy die for theirs.

401
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:30,087
Commanding soldier:
Fix bayonets!

402
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:38,179
(Whistle blows)

403
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:40,264
- (Soldiers shouting)
- (Gunfire)

404
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,392
(Soldiers groaning)

405
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,149
(Panting)

406
00:26:58,115 --> 00:27:00,076
Shepherd: Not even/

407
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,330
could have imagined a war like this.

408
00:27:04,413 --> 00:27:06,249
(Gunfire and explosions)

409
00:27:06,332 --> 00:27:09,752
I/I/hat / thought would take
a decade for us to achieve

410
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:15,007
has taken two short years.

411
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:23,266
We have drained Europe's resources

412
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:27,979
and millions have died pointlessly.

413
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:29,605
Soldier: Fire!

414
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,233
Sh eph erd: We have broken the trust

415
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:35,778
between the people
and the inbred monarchs

416
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:39,574
who only rule
due to their fortunate birth.

417
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:43,828
Do you know who hates king George

418
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:45,705
more than the kaiser?

419
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:51,836
The English monarchy

420
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,797
has oppressed my beloved Scotland

421
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,674
for over 700 years

422
00:27:56,757 --> 00:28:00,136
and it is time for retribution.

423
00:28:00,928 --> 00:28:04,432
We will pull Russia out of our war

424
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:07,226
and unleash the full might of Germany

425
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,313
to destroy england.

426
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,523
Rasputin,

427
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:17,904
are you ready to begin
the demise of king George?

428
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,573
Thy will be done, my Shepherd.

429
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,706
They've started conscription.

430
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:30,833
Yes, I'm well aware of that, Conrad.

431
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,501
And?

432
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,128
Well, it was bad enough

433
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:35,480
I didn't join when it was voluntary...

434
00:28:35,504 --> 00:28:38,090
Conrad, this is not a war.
Do you understand?

435
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,884
It's not like any war
that we've ever seen.

436
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:41,886
I don't care! I should be fighting.

437
00:28:41,969 --> 00:28:44,513
It's not fighting. It's dying.

438
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,517
Much like this conversation.

439
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:52,313
Tell that to kitchener.

440
00:28:58,152 --> 00:29:00,279
(Door opens, closes)

441
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,580
Oxford: You're still too young, Conrad.

442
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,293
Conrad: But everyone's lying
about their age.

443
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,253
- They're all going over.
- I know.

444
00:29:17,004 --> 00:29:18,297
And I know you want to fight.

445
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:21,342
It's a testament to your character

446
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:23,177
and I'm proud of you for it.

447
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,054
Yes, but look what I was given.

448
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,222
In the village.

449
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:30,226
It's the symbol of a coward.

450
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:33,062
And I should suffer such humiliation?

451
00:29:34,313 --> 00:29:37,858
Reputation is what people think of you.

452
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,444
Character is what you are.

453
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:48,077
Conrad: Victoria cross.

454
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,371
Is it yours?

455
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:52,288
Yes.

456
00:29:53,165 --> 00:29:54,250
When I was young,

457
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:57,294
like you, I wanted to serve my country.

458
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,982
- (Gunfire)
- (Men groaning)

459
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:03,092
Oxford: But soon / began
to question what right we had

460
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:06,345
to take the land, riches,

461
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,723
and the lives of people

462
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:11,559
who were only defending their homeland

463
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:16,689
e I/e/y man / killed,

464
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,651
I killed a piece of m yse/fi

465
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,369
Maybe having a feather
would have been better.

466
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,832
So, the next day, I put down my rifle

467
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:36,042
and I picked up a stretcher.

468
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:39,420
I should've been given
the cross for saving lives,

469
00:30:39,503 --> 00:30:40,629
not taking them.

470
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,551
As soon as I replace this
with my own medal,

471
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,387
I'll join the medical corps.

472
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,142
I have informed kitchener

473
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:55,102
of your intention ofjoining up.

474
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,438
And he has assured me that he will not

475
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:59,607
let you slip through.

476
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,150
- I have a vision.
- (Groaning softly)

477
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:47,071
This boy is the symbol
of the soul of Russia.

478
00:31:49,615 --> 00:31:51,700
You must save Russia.

479
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:58,290
You must pull out of the war
to save your son's life.

480
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,959
This is nonsense.

481
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:05,172
You dare to question
the vessel of the lord?

482
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:12,429
You dare to risk your son's life?

483
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:16,725
Nicholas, come to your senses now!

484
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,644
Please.

485
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,855
Please.

486
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:30,322
Cousin Felix:
My dear cousin Conrad

487
00:32:30,906 --> 00:32:33,534
it has been too long
since we last saw each other

488
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:35,744
and I'm sorry I'm only writing
to you now, but...

489
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,996
(Chanting deeply)

490
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,748
In these difficult times,
I'm not sure whom / can trust.

491
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,709
(Rasputin continues chanting)

492
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,424
Welcome back.

493
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,887
Cousin Felix: For a while now,
we harbored my suspicions

494
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,723
of this so-called priest, Rasputin.

495
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,684
He has the tsar under his spell,

496
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:01,520
both spiritually and through opium,

497
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,609
and has persuaded him
to withdraw from the war.

498
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:10,571
The tsar intends to announce this

499
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:12,364
in his new year's speech.

500
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,034
Cousin Felix sends his regards.

501
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,330
Cousin Felix: Lhopeyour
father's influence can help.

502
00:33:20,497 --> 00:33:23,125
Morton, any ideas?

503
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:26,170
Well, sir, in my opinion,

504
00:33:26,253 --> 00:33:27,713
this is a very grave situation.

505
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:29,590
We can trust absolutely no one.

506
00:33:29,673 --> 00:33:31,967
I suggest we assemble
an elite squad of men,

507
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,720
we go to Russia,
and we sort it out ourselves.

508
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:36,889
Agreed. See to it immediately.

509
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:41,101
As I'm not allowed to join up,
may I at least go with you?

510
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:45,606
Conrad, you know your father
made me swear that I would...

511
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:48,651
Protect my son at all costs.

512
00:33:50,527 --> 00:33:52,613
Where do you want to go, Conrad?

513
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:56,075
- Russia.
- Why?

514
00:33:56,158 --> 00:33:58,911
To help cousin yusupov
deal with Rasputin.

515
00:33:58,994 --> 00:34:00,913
He's going to force Russia
out of the war.

516
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,624
Kitchener, have you killed so many men

517
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:06,144
that you're now relying on boys
to run your military intelligence?

518
00:34:06,168 --> 00:34:08,545
- How dare you speak to...
- Shut up, Morton.

519
00:34:11,006 --> 00:34:12,383
Conrad, we're leaving.

520
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,636
Now!

521
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,063
Your lordship?

522
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:30,734
Let's just hope we don't make
such a mess of things in Russia.

523
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:42,955
One more dispatch box for tonight, sir.

524
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,666
Damn it, Morton.

525
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:47,376
How much do you expect a man to read?

526
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:48,627
I'm terribly sorry, my lord.

527
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,380
I would help, but I'm definitely...

528
00:34:51,463 --> 00:34:53,966
Definitely more of a soldier
than I am a sailor.

529
00:34:54,049 --> 00:34:56,093
Well, go outside, man, and get some air.

530
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,178
Quite right.

531
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:06,103
- (Wind howling)
- (Waves crashing)

532
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,790
(Clock ticking)

533
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:46,643
(Men speaking in German)

534
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:04,870
Five million dead.

535
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,415
May god forgive me.

536
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,731
Conrad: First ferdinand,
and now kitchener.

537
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,775
This was not an accident.

538
00:36:35,317 --> 00:36:36,357
Kitchener was your friend.

539
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:39,113
Not to mention this country's last hope.

540
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:40,697
How can you be so calm?

541
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,408
Kitchener: My dear Oxford

542
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,285
I wanted to apologize
for our recent fracas.

543
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,705
In my opinion,
Conrad is a fine young man.

544
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,958
He was betrayed.
We must do something.

545
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:53,168
Kitchener: Always ready
to face the world

546
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,921
no, don't ignore me, father.
You know it's true.

547
00:36:56,004 --> 00:36:57,881
You cannot keep running away
from problems.

548
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,050
K I to h e n e r:
But / shall, of course,

549
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,427
respect your wishes

550
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,638
and do everything / can
to keep him out of harm's way.

551
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:06,640
I don't believe it was a German mine.

552
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:08,267
There is something more afoot.

553
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,479
And what if you're successful?

554
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,398
What if you're successful

555
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:16,161
and keep me locked away
as the world burns?

556
00:37:16,191 --> 00:37:18,360
Kitch en er: If all parents
shared your outlook,

557
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,028
there would be no wars.

558
00:37:20,654 --> 00:37:25,826
But until that day comes,
I will no doubt be kept busy.

559
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,288
I remain your friend kitch.

560
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,836
Your incessant need to protect me

561
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:38,380
will not redeem your own failure
to protect mother.

562
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,263
I'm sorry, father.

563
00:37:54,646 --> 00:37:56,148
(Chair scrapes)

564
00:37:58,859 --> 00:37:59,860
No, no.

565
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:04,072
I'm sorry.

566
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,037
Follow me.

567
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:47,032
Well, about time.

568
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,117
Welcome to the club.

569
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,537
Is he part of the briefing?

570
00:38:52,037 --> 00:38:53,121
Yes.

571
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:56,333
Take a look.

572
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:04,925
You see, this war has made me realize

573
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:07,261
that we cannot rely on politicians

574
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:09,680
to do their job properly.

575
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:11,848
So, I decided

576
00:39:12,474 --> 00:39:14,518
that we should do something about it.

577
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:16,645
This isn't making any sense
to me, father.

578
00:39:16,728 --> 00:39:17,854
Oxford: Let me explain.

579
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:22,359
My reputation is of a man
not wanting to be involved,

580
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:24,778
which means that my character

581
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:28,532
finds it much easier
to be involved unnoticed.

582
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:31,577
Just like domestic servants everywhere

583
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,829
who are seen but not heard.

584
00:39:33,912 --> 00:39:36,081
Essentially invisible.

585
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:39,543
Unless they're part
of the Oxford family, of course.

586
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,088
Shola and Polly have gathered

587
00:39:43,171 --> 00:39:45,299
a network of domestics

588
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:47,884
such as the world has never seen.

589
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,930
While British intelligence
listens at keyholes,

590
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:56,018
our people are actually in the room.

591
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:57,603
- Very clever.
- Hmm.

592
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,272
Now, after ferdinand's assassination,

593
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:04,318
I visited gavrilo princip
in his prison in Sarajevo.

594
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,821
(Grunts)

595
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:16,245
(Gasping)

596
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,545
- (Oxford groans)
- Princip: Thank you.

597
00:40:27,966 --> 00:40:29,301
Why did you kill my friend?

598
00:40:29,384 --> 00:40:32,554
It was the alcohol. I was overcome.

599
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:37,100
I'm just a simple serb.

600
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:41,772
A very expensive ring
for such a simple serb.

601
00:40:41,855 --> 00:40:44,316
Ah, and a secret compartment.

602
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:47,819
That smelled of almonds.
Therefore, cyanide.

603
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:51,281
Princip's ring proves
he was not acting alone.

604
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:54,117
There is, as you say, Conrad,
more afoot.

605
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,201
Polly: Indeed.

606
00:40:57,162 --> 00:41:00,123
Your cousin's letter made us
extend our network to Russia

607
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,500
and it paid off.

608
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,295
The tsar's nanny found a ring
in Rasputin's chambers.

609
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,882
Identical to princ/p 's,

610
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:10,967
but with a tortoise instead of a bear.

611
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,095
Then I think we must
go to Russia immediately

612
00:41:13,178 --> 00:41:15,931
and find a way to interrogate this monk.

613
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:18,517
Polly: But by all accounts,
Rasputin is unbreakable.

614
00:41:19,434 --> 00:41:21,353
As long as he's alive,

615
00:41:21,436 --> 00:41:22,938
the tsar will never change his mind

616
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:25,023
and with Russia out of the war,

617
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:27,234
england is doomed.

618
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,860
Shola: My lord.

619
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:37,160
One life to save millions.

620
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:44,000
Oxford: So,

621
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:47,921
the only way to honor the vow
I made to your mother

622
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,801
is to break the vow I made to myself.

623
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,680
I'm afraid we have no other choice.

624
00:41:58,306 --> 00:42:02,728
It is time for us
to kill grigori Rasputin.

625
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,231
(Train horn blaring)

626
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:11,153
Rasputin has accepted an invitation

627
00:42:11,236 --> 00:42:13,155
to your cousin's Christmas ball.

628
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,490
The tsar's nanny informs me

629
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:18,994
of Rasputin's weakness for sweet cakes.

630
00:42:19,494 --> 00:42:22,372
And even sweeter boys.

631
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,501
So, after the main course is served,

632
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:30,672
Conrad will entice Rasputin

633
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,633
to a private dessert in the summer room,

634
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:37,554
where nanny's legendary bakewell tart,

635
00:42:37,637 --> 00:42:39,055
laced with poison,

636
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,141
will be waiting for him.

637
00:42:41,224 --> 00:42:43,226
Polly, get baking.

638
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:46,438
Yes. And don't forget the poison.

639
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,529
Oxford: Get him to eat
the cake. Understand?

640
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:55,655
Yes, father.

641
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,325
Good. Tonight we will be rogues,

642
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,368
not Oxfords.

643
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,499
(Cane banging)

644
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,961
Our guest of honor, father Rasputin.

645
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,882
(Door opens)

646
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,300
Are you waiters or englishmen?

647
00:43:58,635 --> 00:44:01,596
Whatever you are,
get me a fucking drink.

648
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,391
Are you a monk or a ballet dancer?

649
00:44:10,438 --> 00:44:13,275
I see you've mastered
the beryozka glide.

650
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,445
Why don't you glide over there
and get me a fucking drink?

651
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,204
Englishmen.

652
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,206
I like the English.

653
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,211
But it's a long way to come
for a Christmas party.

654
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:36,131
Well, for me, yes.
But not for my son,

655
00:44:36,631 --> 00:44:39,551
who is certainly
a lot more fun than I am

656
00:44:39,634 --> 00:44:40,719
in these dark days.

657
00:44:45,098 --> 00:44:46,808
I'm looking for someone who can help me

658
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,894
gain an audience with the tsar.

659
00:44:49,394 --> 00:44:50,979
Perhaps you can be of assistance.

660
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,356
But I am just a humble monk.

661
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,068
Mmm, a humble monk
that this whole room reveres

662
00:44:57,819 --> 00:44:59,362
or fears.

663
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:08,580
I only make decisions
when my stomach is full

664
00:45:08,663 --> 00:45:10,665
or my balls are empty.

665
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:14,586
Well, thank god dinner is being served.

666
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:16,880
Rasputin: So, uh,

667
00:45:16,963 --> 00:45:20,800
your father tells me
you like to have fun.

668
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:24,596
Yes. I believe
I'm sufficiently open-minded.

669
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,349
What is it that you Russians do

670
00:45:27,432 --> 00:45:28,767
that an englishman can enjoy?

671
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,894
Rasputin: Well, everything.

672
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:34,230
Food, music, ballet,

673
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,942
tobacco, art.

674
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,526
But most of all...

675
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:46,284
We like to fuck like tigers.

676
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,622
(Growling softly)

677
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,959
(Snarls)

678
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:59,506
Is that something
an English boy might enjoy?

679
00:46:02,592 --> 00:46:03,593
Yes.

680
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:08,014
Hmm... but tonight
I do not want to teach.

681
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,933
(Indistinct chatter)

682
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,019
Change seats with your father.

683
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,899
I'm so sorry if I have offended you.

684
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:21,152
Only if you consider
being boring offensive.

685
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,946
Now do as you're told.

686
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:25,490
Yes.

687
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:33,498
(Softly) Sorry, father.
He wants us to swap places.

688
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,590
Excuse me, forgive me. Forgive me.

689
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:53,143
This leg is a fearful curse.

690
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,813
You know, if I didn't know any better,

691
00:46:56,896 --> 00:46:59,315
I'd say your son was trying to fuck me.

692
00:47:00,316 --> 00:47:02,944
More likely you were trying to fuck him.

693
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,155
Your reputation precedes you.

694
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:08,491
Well, if you know so much
about my reputation,

695
00:47:09,492 --> 00:47:11,286
put your leg in my lap.

696
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:13,538
I may be able to fix it.

697
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:16,166
- Here?
- Not here.

698
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:19,252
Somewhere private, of course.

699
00:47:26,342 --> 00:47:27,802
Here we are.

700
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:33,850
You are expecting someone?

701
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,144
Yes, our nanny is a wonderful cook,

702
00:47:36,227 --> 00:47:37,437
so she's made this cake

703
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,606
as a gift for our host, the prince.

704
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,151
Please,

705
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:46,362
take your trousers off and sit down.

706
00:47:47,947 --> 00:47:48,948
Certainly.

707
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,202
I will make the room warm for you.

708
00:47:57,415 --> 00:47:59,055
Rasputin: (Muffled)
In summer, I come here

709
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,752
with my young friends.

710
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:04,297
Swim naked in the bathing pond,

711
00:48:05,006 --> 00:48:09,761
then come inside
and fuck in front of the fire.

712
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:11,805
Naturally.

713
00:48:12,972 --> 00:48:14,099
Ah, there we are.

714
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,683
Trousers off.

715
00:48:24,025 --> 00:48:25,318
- Rasputin: Mmm.
- (Groans)

716
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:26,902
Steady.

717
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,447
Blood is life.

718
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,910
Its flow is healing.

719
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:38,832
And I can teach it where to flow.

720
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,672
Hmm...

721
00:48:46,756 --> 00:48:47,966
-Hmm.

722
00:48:48,049 --> 00:48:50,176
Your wound was fixed superficially

723
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,804
and with very poor needle work.

724
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:54,013
Oxford: Hmm.

725
00:48:57,058 --> 00:48:59,352
This cake is good, no?

726
00:48:59,435 --> 00:49:03,731
Yes. It's bakewell tart.
It's my favorite.

727
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:07,110
We can eat it together
when I put my trousers back on.

728
00:49:08,027 --> 00:49:11,281
No. Well, to do this properly,

729
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,576
I will need energy.

730
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,373
(Sniffing)

731
00:49:21,332 --> 00:49:22,750
Hmm...

732
00:49:33,928 --> 00:49:34,929
It's very good.

733
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:36,848
Oxford: Hmm.

734
00:49:38,516 --> 00:49:39,684
Very English.

735
00:49:39,767 --> 00:49:41,728
Yes. It's very English.

736
00:49:42,395 --> 00:49:43,396
Hmm.

737
00:49:57,035 --> 00:50:00,413
(Chanting deeply)

738
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,373
(Chuckles)

739
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,423
(Whispering) What's that noise?

740
00:50:10,506 --> 00:50:11,841
- We should go in.
- No, no.

741
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,384
It's Rasputin, not your father.

742
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,094
I think it's the poison killing him.

743
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,471
(Cont! N u es chant! Ng)

744
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,432
(Grunts)

745
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,064
(Oxford groaning)

746
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:33,905
Relax. Let the blood flow.

747
00:50:34,405 --> 00:50:35,949
- Let me lick your wounds.
- Yes.

748
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,825
- Trust me. Trust me.
- Oh, god.

749
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,535
- Oh, my, I can see it.
- Trust me.

750
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,830
Don't worry, I will help you,
and you will help me.

751
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:45,250
(Mumbling)

752
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,794
Why do you want to see the tsar?

753
00:50:47,877 --> 00:50:49,087
(Mumbles)

754
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:52,632
The tsar needs to stay in the war.

755
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:54,592
What makes you think he won't?

756
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,055
I'm told he's being influenced.

757
00:50:59,138 --> 00:51:00,640
Good. Now we are getting somewhere.

758
00:51:00,723 --> 00:51:03,685
So, if you really want your leg fixed,

759
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:04,811
tell me the truth.

760
00:51:04,894 --> 00:51:06,020
Why are you here?

761
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,146
I'm here...

762
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,815
- Because?
- Because...

763
00:51:08,898 --> 00:51:10,316
- Because?
- Because...

764
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,694
- Because?
- Because I'm going to kill...

765
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,959
I apologize.

766
00:51:32,588 --> 00:51:33,673
Your cake...

767
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,014
Did not agree with me.

768
00:51:41,806 --> 00:51:43,016
(Thuds) (Groans)

769
00:51:48,187 --> 00:51:49,314
Come!

770
00:51:50,773 --> 00:51:52,859
We must ice your leg.

771
00:51:53,901 --> 00:51:57,113
Only two minutes in the cold water,

772
00:51:57,196 --> 00:51:58,990
and you will be like a new man.

773
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:04,662
- My... my leg...
- Yes.

774
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,497
- Is healed.
- Yes.

775
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,124
- Yes.
- Walk to me.

776
00:52:08,207 --> 00:52:09,207
(Mumbles, chuckles)

777
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:12,879
No. No, no, no. Not the cane.

778
00:52:12,962 --> 00:52:14,047
Leave the cane.

779
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,923
- Oh, yes.
- Leave the cane.

780
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,468
(Laughing) I didn't believe you.

781
00:52:19,677 --> 00:52:22,930
Come to me. Come to me.

782
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:26,351
- Why is father laughing?
- I have no idea.

783
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:29,479
Now let the cold...

784
00:52:29,562 --> 00:52:31,564
Russian water...

785
00:52:32,106 --> 00:52:34,442
Heal you forever.

786
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:42,367
Come. Come. Come. Come.

787
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,203
- Oh!
- Come. Come.

788
00:52:45,286 --> 00:52:47,872
- Yes. Yes, yes.
- It's freezing.

789
00:52:47,955 --> 00:52:50,124
Let mother nature work her magic.

790
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,876
(Shivering)

791
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:54,420
Two minutes.

792
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,631
Two minutes, and you will be healed.

793
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,008
You will be healed.

794
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,302
Bakewell tart.

795
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:06,057
Tell me, a lot of almonds
in bakewell tart.

796
00:53:07,141 --> 00:53:10,019
What other ingredients in bakewell tart?

797
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,480
I have no idea. I'm not a cook.

798
00:53:12,563 --> 00:53:13,731
Well, I am.

799
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:18,027
And I also know
what else smells like almonds.

800
00:53:18,694 --> 00:53:20,029
Cyanide!

801
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:20,988
(Oxford grunts)

802
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,574
Rasputin: If you really knew
my reputation,

803
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:26,494
you'd know I take a little poison
for breakfast...

804
00:53:26,577 --> 00:53:29,038
- He's in trouble.
- To keep myself immune.

805
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,711
(Oxford gasping)

806
00:53:37,922 --> 00:53:39,590
Now, that's more like it.

807
00:53:41,467 --> 00:53:46,639
Time to dance... on your graves.

808
00:53:50,184 --> 00:53:52,019
Go and help your father.

809
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,148
(Yelling)

810
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,024
(Both grunting)

811
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,026
(Orchestral music playing)

812
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:02,405
Father. Father.
Oh, god. You're freezing.

813
00:54:02,488 --> 00:54:05,324
Father, are you all right? Breathe.

814
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,785
I'm so cold. I'm so cold.

815
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,668
(Yells)

816
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,133
(Music continues)

817
00:54:51,996 --> 00:54:53,372
(Weakly) Shola.

818
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,177
- (Yells)
- (Grunts)

819
00:55:18,814 --> 00:55:20,024
(Screams)

820
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:23,194
(Groaning)

821
00:55:27,156 --> 00:55:28,616
Shola.

822
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:38,125
Do it. Do it!

823
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,545
Do it!

824
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,218
Shoot me.

825
00:55:47,301 --> 00:55:49,095
(Gun clicking)

826
00:55:50,137 --> 00:55:52,473
Please kill me.

827
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:55,685
(Gun clicking)

828
00:55:55,768 --> 00:55:57,853
Beautiful boy.

829
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:59,480
- (Bones cracking)
- (Groans)

830
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,024
(Rasputin yells)

831
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,610
(Russian folk music playing)

832
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,785
(Grunting)

833
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,251
(Groaning)

834
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,259
Rasputin: I fixed your leg.

835
00:56:28,342 --> 00:56:32,221
Which is more than I can say
for your son's neck.

836
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,640
(Oxford yells)

837
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:51,532
(Straining)

838
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,133
(Both yell)

839
00:57:10,551 --> 00:57:13,137
(Yelling)

840
00:57:13,846 --> 00:57:14,846
(Screaming)

841
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,939
Thank you for my new leg. (Grunts)

842
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:34,533
(Groans)

843
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,084
Are you all right?

844
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,461
I'm fine. Thank you.

845
00:57:45,544 --> 00:57:50,257
No. Thank you. You saved my life.

846
00:57:52,968 --> 00:57:54,553
And you, mine.

847
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,431
- What about shola?
- Oh.

848
00:57:58,307 --> 00:58:01,435
He'll be all right.
He just needs to sleep it off.

849
00:58:04,855 --> 00:58:06,065
(Gunshot)

850
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:21,247
Why is it that boys
are always so messy?

851
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,709
Pick him up. It's time to go.

852
00:58:32,174 --> 00:58:35,803
Shepherd: You have got to be
fucking kidding me!

853
00:58:35,886 --> 00:58:37,722
(Bleating)

854
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:44,520
I want you to pick up
where Rasputin failed.

855
00:58:44,603 --> 00:58:48,899
I don't care about your ideology
or your politics.

856
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:51,485
Just start your fucking revolution

857
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:55,072
and get Russia out of my war,

858
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,198
comrade Lenin.

859
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,658
Yes, my Shepherd.

860
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,827
When my revolution is complete,

861
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:03,581
the flocks left will be so powerful,

862
00:59:03,664 --> 00:59:06,000
your one problem
will be finding my equal

863
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:07,918
to balance from the right.

864
00:59:15,801 --> 00:59:17,303
What's wrong with him?

865
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:21,307
Today your father broke
his vow of pacifism.

866
00:59:22,391 --> 00:59:24,059
But it was the right thing to do.

867
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:27,313
Right or wrong,
it doesn't make it any easier.

868
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:33,402
(Singing) Happy birthday to you

869
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:38,115
(shola joins in)
Happy birthday to you

870
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:43,078
happy birthday, dearest Conrad

871
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:49,835
happy birthday to you

872
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,798
shola: Good boy.

873
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,884
(All exclaim)

874
00:59:56,967 --> 00:59:58,302
(Laughing)

875
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:01,388
To my son.

876
01:00:04,391 --> 01:00:05,726
Thank you.

877
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:09,939
Today, you proved yourself a man

878
01:00:10,022 --> 01:00:13,526
and you've made us all very proud.

879
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:17,863
A toast to our successful mission

880
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,824
and my new leg.

881
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,742
(All laughing)

882
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,996
Happy birthday, Conrad.

883
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,832
Polly: Happy birthday.

884
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:31,001
Thank you, father.

885
01:00:34,004 --> 01:00:35,464
(Laughing)

886
01:00:46,058 --> 01:00:48,060
I'm glad that we can
finally see eye to eye.

887
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,105
Well, we can now.

888
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,233
(Chuckling)

889
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,384
Now that I've blown out 19 candles,

890
01:00:56,443 --> 01:00:58,487
I'm sure you'll give me your blessing

891
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:02,283
as I join up and finally
fulfill my duty to my country.

892
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:08,080
Conrad, you've just exceeded
your duty to your country.

893
01:01:09,206 --> 01:01:12,084
My wishes have nothing
to do with your age.

894
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:15,421
Father, your wishes were only granted
because of my age.

895
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,841
There's nothing you can do
to stop me now.

896
01:01:19,758 --> 01:01:22,678
All I ask for is your blessing,
at least.

897
01:01:25,764 --> 01:01:27,433
I'm sorry, Conrad.

898
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,102
But you're asking for the one thing

899
01:01:30,185 --> 01:01:33,188
that I cannot and I will not give you.

900
01:02:06,221 --> 01:02:08,057
(Man shouting commands)

901
01:02:25,115 --> 01:02:26,325
Erik: My kaiser.

902
01:02:26,408 --> 01:02:28,577
Our naval blockade around england

903
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,829
has sunk another
American passenger ship.

904
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:33,916
The American president
could soon run out of Patience

905
01:02:33,999 --> 01:02:36,502
and if they join the war
on england's side,

906
01:02:37,169 --> 01:02:38,420
we will be defeated.

907
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:41,048
There are no rules in war.

908
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:44,802
And making england
starve to death is worth the risk.

909
01:02:44,885 --> 01:02:45,970
Erik: Hmm...

910
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,597
But if you send this,

911
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:51,183
it will mitigate the risk.

912
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,148
Are you sure?

913
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:00,025
Yes, my kaiser.

914
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,155
Get me Zimmermann.

915
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:07,074
(Phone ringing)

916
01:03:07,157 --> 01:03:09,368
Zimmermann, telegraph the following.

917
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,835
Zimmermann:
Send this immediately.

918
01:03:17,918 --> 01:03:20,921
Use the kaiser's top-level encoding.

919
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,132
(Beeping)

920
01:03:24,758 --> 01:03:25,843
Officer: Gentlemen,

921
01:03:25,926 --> 01:03:28,303
we have a priority-one intercept.

922
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:31,056
Whatever you're doing, cease now.

923
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,100
We need this code cracked pronto.

924
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:38,313
- Tea?
- Please.

925
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:48,407
Oxford: Good job, Rita.

926
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:50,826
Polly: This code is what
the kaiser has been using.

927
01:03:50,909 --> 01:03:53,120
It must be unbelievably important.

928
01:03:53,203 --> 01:03:54,538
Can you break it?

929
01:03:55,539 --> 01:03:59,043
Officer: One! Two! Three! Four!

930
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:01,336
Polly:
Ill need a lot more information.

931
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,589
Trainer 1:
Keep your eye on the enemy!

932
01:04:03,672 --> 01:04:04,858
Trainer 2: Aim rifles to the left!

933
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:05,882
Trainer 3: Fire!

934
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:07,885
Thank you.

935
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:10,304
What makes the grass grow?

936
01:04:10,387 --> 01:04:12,347
Cadets: Blood! Blood! Blood!

937
01:04:13,265 --> 01:04:14,409
Trainer 4: I/I/hat're you gonna do?

938
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:15,976
Cadets: Kill! Kill! Kill!

939
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,145
(Cadets yelling)

940
01:04:18,979 --> 01:04:20,022
Shola: Here's your tea.

941
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,525
Drill commander: Quick! March!

942
01:04:26,862 --> 01:04:28,322
Ludendorff: Mmm-hmm. Ja.

943
01:04:28,405 --> 01:04:30,783
I am using the cipher.

944
01:04:30,866 --> 01:04:33,494
Is the eight a "z" or is it an "r"?

945
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,581
(Grunts in frustration)

946
01:04:37,664 --> 01:04:39,083
Chaplain: Godspeed to you all.

947
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,876
And remember...

948
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:44,880
”Dulce et decorum
est pro patria mori. ”

949
01:04:44,963 --> 01:04:46,173
Cadet: What does that mean?

950
01:04:46,256 --> 01:04:49,009
"It's sweet and proper
to die for one's country."

951
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:50,552
(Chirping)

952
01:04:51,845 --> 01:04:53,972
Shola: Direct from Germany.

953
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,224
Thank you.

954
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:04,316
Ludendorff: (On recording)
Ja. I am using the c/pher.

955
01:05:04,399 --> 01:05:07,778
Is the e/ght a ” ” or is it an ”r”?

956
01:05:09,696 --> 01:05:12,491
A 'z ” thank you.

957
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:24,545
I've cracked the code.

958
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,607
It's from Arthur Zimmermann,
the German secretary of state in Berlin

959
01:05:27,631 --> 01:05:29,800
to their ambassador in Mexico City.

960
01:05:29,883 --> 01:05:32,136
He proposes an alliance with Mexico.

961
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:35,180
Germany wants to divert
america's attention,

962
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,724
so they're asking Mexico
to invade america.

963
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,017
In print, there.

964
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:42,354
So, when president Wilson sees this,
then he has no choice but...

965
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,398
He has to enter the war.

966
01:05:44,481 --> 01:05:46,233
And the war will be over.

967
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,570
- Well done. Oh, my dear Polly.
- (Chuckling)

968
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:51,321
Well done, you.

969
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:53,073
(Laughing)

970
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:54,616
You are incredible.

971
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:57,578
And there's hope for Conrad.

972
01:06:02,207 --> 01:06:03,876
King George: Well done, Oxford

973
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:06,128
ll/ly idiot cousin, the kaiser,

974
01:06:06,211 --> 01:06:08,255
has finally shot himself in the foot.

975
01:06:08,338 --> 01:06:10,549
You've hit a six
with this telegram, old boy.

976
01:06:10,632 --> 01:06:11,800
Kitchener would be proud.

977
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,387
Well, I think champagne is in order.

978
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:18,599
Uh, thank you, your majesty,
but I vowed not to drink

979
01:06:18,682 --> 01:06:22,853
until Conrad has returned
safely from the war.

980
01:06:22,936 --> 01:06:24,563
Why didn't you mention that earlier?

981
01:06:25,105 --> 01:06:27,191
I'll make sure the only action
your boy sees

982
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,151
is sharpening the general's pencils.

983
01:06:29,234 --> 01:06:32,613
(Laughs) I'm not sure that's cricket.

984
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,285
Orlando, you know how many
boys' lives you've saved

985
01:06:38,368 --> 01:06:39,411
with this telegram?

986
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,872
At least let me save one.

987
01:06:47,669 --> 01:06:49,880
Now that Conrad's safety is assured...

988
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:53,926
To peace in our time.

989
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:56,803
To peace in our time.

990
01:06:58,388 --> 01:07:01,308
American general: King George is waiting
for your response, Mr. President.

991
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:03,852
But how can this telegram be real?

992
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:05,938
Not even the Germans
would be this stupid.

993
01:07:06,021 --> 01:07:08,815
- But, sir...
- I'm not doing a damn thing

994
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:10,859
till I have undeniable proof.

995
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,319
Douglas.

996
01:07:13,153 --> 01:07:15,072
Statesman on the rocks, please.

997
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:18,325
(Indistinct chatter)

998
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:25,332
Lieutenant Oxford reporting
for duty, sir.

999
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:28,585
Ah, yes. Oxford.

1000
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:32,589
Lucky man. You've been
assigned back to London.

1001
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:37,552
Sir, there must be some mistake.

1002
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:39,554
No. Fortune favors the brave,

1003
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:42,641
or those under the king's gaze.

1004
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:47,980
Sir.

1005
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:51,275
Attention!

1006
01:08:12,212 --> 01:08:13,714
Lance corporal.

1007
01:08:13,797 --> 01:08:15,757
- Sir.
- What's your name?

1008
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,342
Lance corporal Reid, sir.

1009
01:08:18,176 --> 01:08:19,176
Follow me.

1010
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,321
Shola, I presume.

1011
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:39,739
Yes.

1012
01:08:39,781 --> 01:08:42,159
Conrad has sent me to see the Duke.

1013
01:08:44,661 --> 01:08:45,662
And your name, sir?

1014
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:50,959
Good question.
It's a complicated answer.

1015
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:52,753
I can only tell the Duke in person.

1016
01:08:52,836 --> 01:08:54,588
Well, I still need a name.

1017
01:08:54,671 --> 01:08:56,506
This is gonna sound stupid.

1018
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,301
But according to Conrad,
I'm Lancelot.

1019
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,678
You're Merlin,

1020
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:04,306
and I'm requesting an audience
with king Arthur.

1021
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,267
Follow me, sir.

1022
01:09:10,103 --> 01:09:13,440
Oxford: "Doubts persist
as to telegram authenticity.

1023
01:09:13,523 --> 01:09:16,360
"Worried Wilson won't go to war."

1024
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:17,527
Idiots and fools.

1025
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:19,321
There's nothing left to debate.

1026
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:23,492
Polly, do you think
we can extend our network

1027
01:09:23,575 --> 01:09:24,576
to the white house?

1028
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:27,329
Most of their household staff
were trained in england,

1029
01:09:27,412 --> 01:09:28,556
so it shouldn't be a problem.

1030
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:30,058
Right. Well, let's get to work, then.

1031
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:32,250
- I'll get on to it right away.
- Thank you.

1032
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:37,381
(Knock at door)

1033
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:39,466
Yes, come in.

1034
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,096
Your grace. We have a visitor.

1035
01:09:44,179 --> 01:09:45,430
Who is it?

1036
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:48,558
A friend of Conrad saying he's Lancelot,

1037
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:50,185
asking to see king Arthur.

1038
01:09:50,268 --> 01:09:52,062
What? (Chuckling)

1039
01:09:52,145 --> 01:09:53,939
That brings back fond memories.

1040
01:09:55,732 --> 01:09:56,733
Show him in, would you?

1041
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:58,026
Yes, sir.

1042
01:09:58,902 --> 01:09:59,903
Sir.

1043
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:03,573
Who are you?

1044
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:06,368
Lance corporal Reid
of the black watch, sir.

1045
01:10:07,327 --> 01:10:10,122
So then why are you wearing
a grenadiers officer's uniform?

1046
01:10:11,164 --> 01:10:12,374
(Sighs)

1047
01:10:12,874 --> 01:10:13,875
This, uh...

1048
01:10:15,752 --> 01:10:18,004
This will explain it better than I can.

1049
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:20,215
It's a wee bit surreal, sir.

1050
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:25,679
Oxford: Hmm.

1051
01:10:26,763 --> 01:10:27,931
Odd.

1052
01:10:28,014 --> 01:10:30,684
(Laughing) It's a letter from Conrad.

1053
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:33,270
You're Lancelot.

1054
01:10:35,313 --> 01:10:38,525
Co n rad: Dear father.
/, too, can play games.

1055
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:42,154
I'i/e swapped places with Archie Reid

1056
01:10:42,654 --> 01:10:44,030
the man in front of you.

1057
01:10:44,614 --> 01:10:45,699
Archie?

1058
01:10:45,782 --> 01:10:47,534
- Con rad: He's a good man...
- Yes, sir.

1059
01:10:47,617 --> 01:10:49,494
Who is simply fol/o wing my orders

1060
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:52,038
and is possibly as confused as you are.

1061
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:54,166
Please ensure my actions

1062
01:10:54,249 --> 01:10:55,876
don't get him into any trouble.

1063
01:10:56,585 --> 01:11:00,046
Tomorrow / finally fulfill
my wish to go to the front.

1064
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:03,133
And in the meantime, / enclose a poem

1065
01:11:03,967 --> 01:11:06,094
which / thought you m/ght appreciate.

1066
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:08,680
Oxford: ”bent double...

1067
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:13,059

01:12:04,736 --> 01:12:06,446
”that dropped behind ”

1081
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:08,740
(indistinct chatter)

1082
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:15,247
Sergeant major: New lads.

1083
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:16,998
Welcome to the front line.

1084
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:18,434
This trench will be your home
for the next six...

1085
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:21,002
I don't bloody believe it. Runner!

1086
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,380
Sergeant major: Come on, lads!

1087
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,509
(Gunfire and explosions)

1088
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,059
Well, come on, lads! Cover the man!

1089
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:40,355
Cover the man!

1090
01:12:44,234 --> 01:12:45,151
Fire!

1091
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:46,611
(Indistinct shouting)

1092
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:47,696
Keep running!

1093
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,287
Sergeant major: Hold your fire!

1094
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:02,919
Good effort, men.

1095
01:13:03,795 --> 01:13:06,089
This war never stops surprising me.

1096
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:09,884
A German wavin' a union Jack!
What's next?

1097
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,405
Captain forrest: Allow me
to answer that, sergeant major.

1098
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:13,972
Sergeant major: Fall in!

1099
01:13:16,808 --> 01:13:19,519
That runner was actually a British spy.

1100
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:21,229
He was bringing me vital information.

1101
01:13:21,938 --> 01:13:23,291
Our country needs what he was carrying,

1102
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:25,483
and I therefore need six volunteers.

1103
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:28,170
You will accompany me
to retrieve what's left of him

1104
01:13:28,194 --> 01:13:30,280
as soon as it's dark.

1105
01:13:34,117 --> 01:13:35,243
Very good, lad.

1106
01:13:36,661 --> 01:13:37,746
Who else?

1107
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:40,915
Sergeant?

1108
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:45,003
You five. One step fonnard. March!

1109
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:49,174
Five more brave volunteers, sir.

1110
01:13:49,257 --> 01:13:52,719
Excellent. We move out at midnight.

1111
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:02,479
(Rats squeaking)

1112
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:28,046
(Faint rustling)

1113
01:14:33,468 --> 01:14:34,594
(Whispering) Hold your fire.

1114
01:14:35,428 --> 01:14:39,265
If they hear us from the trenches,
we'll be fired upon from both sides.

1115
01:14:48,316 --> 01:14:49,317
(Shushes softly)

1116
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:56,199
(Whispers) Boom.

1117
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,415
(All grunting)

1118
01:16:02,098 --> 01:16:03,224
(Muffled screaming)

1119
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:13,526
Trooper: Please...

1120
01:16:14,652 --> 01:16:16,571
- Please don't.
- (Man groaning)

1121
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:22,994
(Breathing heavily)

1122
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:28,750
(Trooper muttering indistinctly)

1123
01:16:30,668 --> 01:16:31,711
I'm so sorry.

1124
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:33,588
(Groans)

1125
01:16:33,671 --> 01:16:35,673
(Breathing heavily)

1126
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:40,637
(All grunting)

1127
01:17:01,157 --> 01:17:02,826
- (Clangs)
- (Gasps)

1128
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:04,160
What was that?

1129
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:06,204
(Speaking German)

1130
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:29,453
(In English) It's over there.

1131
01:17:29,477 --> 01:17:30,854
Conrad: Don't shoot!

1132
01:17:31,896 --> 01:17:33,064
(Indistinct shouting)

1133
01:17:39,195 --> 01:17:40,697
(Panting)

1134
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:55,878
(Yelling)

1135
01:17:57,463 --> 01:17:58,463
(Yelling)

1136
01:18:09,517 --> 01:18:11,936
- (Gunfire continues)
- (Indistinct shouting)

1137
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,316
- (Coughing)
- British soldier: Cease fire!

1138
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:24,616
(Panting heavily)

1139
01:18:29,787 --> 01:18:31,623
(Sobbing)

1140
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:42,759
Man: First time out here, lad?

1141
01:18:43,843 --> 01:18:45,428
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1142
01:18:47,263 --> 01:18:49,015
Same side.

1143
01:18:49,807 --> 01:18:51,351
Thank god for the union Jack, eh?

1144
01:18:55,813 --> 01:18:57,815
I can honestly say that my first time

1145
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,609
was worse than losing this leg.
(Chuckles)

1146
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:05,990
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't
be the one crying.

1147
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:08,493
Come over here and help me out.
I'm freezing.

1148
01:19:14,415 --> 01:19:17,210
Come here. Come on.

1149
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:19,253
(Shushing)

1150
01:19:20,546 --> 01:19:22,382
(Conrad continues sobbing)

1151
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:28,554
I thought... I thought I knew
what I wanted.

1152
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,772
My father warned me.

1153
01:19:38,856 --> 01:19:41,734
My father warned me.
I... I didn't listen...

1154
01:19:43,569 --> 01:19:45,530
And now it all makes sense.

1155
01:19:50,034 --> 01:19:52,495
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

1156
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:57,834
Well, I suggest we solve
both our problems, yeah?

1157
01:19:58,459 --> 01:19:59,836
Look.

1158
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:02,588
I need to get this to high command.

1159
01:20:03,089 --> 01:20:05,591
The contents could help
end this bloody war.

1160
01:20:06,634 --> 01:20:09,929
As I won't be walking any time soon,

1161
01:20:11,222 --> 01:20:13,933
I suggest you finish the mission

1162
01:20:16,227 --> 01:20:18,354
and go home to a hero's welcome.

1163
01:20:18,896 --> 01:20:23,693
No, no. No. Off we go
to a hero's welcome.

1164
01:20:43,671 --> 01:20:46,132
- (Whimpering)
- It's okay. I've got you.

1165
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:52,263
(Speaking German)

1166
01:20:55,099 --> 01:20:57,351
Shit. Hurry!

1167
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:01,814
British soldier: Covering fire!

1168
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:03,149
Give them cover, lads!

1169
01:21:06,611 --> 01:21:08,362
Fucking move!

1170
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:11,282
(Yelling)

1171
01:21:11,365 --> 01:21:13,159
Take out the machine gunner!

1172
01:21:13,242 --> 01:21:14,869
Soldier: Cover him!

1173
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:26,005
Run!

1174
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:29,133
- Soldier 1: Let's go, man! Run!
- Soldier 2: Run! Run! Run!

1175
01:22:08,047 --> 01:22:10,091
You all right? You all right?

1176
01:22:10,633 --> 01:22:12,927
Jesus Christ! You were amazin'!

1177
01:22:13,010 --> 01:22:14,846
I've never seen anything like it.

1178
01:22:14,929 --> 01:22:17,116
What the bloody hell were you doing
over there in the first place?

1179
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:18,808
(Panting)

1180
01:22:18,891 --> 01:22:20,893
You better ask him. Ask him.

1181
01:22:21,477 --> 01:22:23,354
He'll explain everything.

1182
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:26,149
Soldier: He took the full force
of that blast, sir.

1183
01:22:26,232 --> 01:22:28,484
Yeah. But at least
you made it back, son.

1184
01:22:29,068 --> 01:22:31,779
I tell you, if that ain't worth
a Victoria cross,

1185
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:32,947
I don't know what is.

1186
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:34,532
I must carry on the mission.

1187
01:22:34,615 --> 01:22:36,909
We need to get this
to high command immediately.

1188
01:22:36,993 --> 01:22:39,829
I'll take you there myself.
What's your name, soldier?

1189
01:22:41,038 --> 01:22:44,083
Archie. Lance corporal Archie Reid.

1190
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:46,047
Sergeant major atkins:
Archie Reid, did you say?

1191
01:22:46,669 --> 01:22:47,669
Yes.

1192
01:22:48,254 --> 01:22:49,422
That's right.

1193
01:22:49,505 --> 01:22:51,007
Lance corporal Archie Reid?

1194
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:53,968
Dog platoon, first battalion,
the black watch?

1195
01:22:58,181 --> 01:22:59,974
Is that your best Scottish accent?

1196
01:23:00,474 --> 01:23:01,475
You're not Archie Reid.

1197
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:04,228
Lance corporal Archie Reid's
a friend of mine.

1198
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:06,165
And I've been looking for him all night.
So who are you?

1199
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:10,193
Yes, yes. You're right.
There's a simple explanation.

1200
01:23:10,276 --> 01:23:12,069
- I'm not Archie Reid.
- Fuckin' German spy.

1201
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:13,279
I'm conra...

1202
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:36,359
Reid:
Your son was killed in action, sir.

1203
01:23:49,482 --> 01:23:50,482
Oxford: What?

1204
01:24:24,058 --> 01:24:25,559
(Sobbing)

1205
01:24:33,943 --> 01:24:35,027
Polly.

1206
01:24:38,447 --> 01:24:39,615
Polly.

1207
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:53,045
My son.

1208
01:25:03,389 --> 01:25:04,849
Why?

1209
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:20,865
Oxford:
”/f in some smothering dreams...

1210
01:25:20,948 --> 01:25:22,742
”You too could pace

1211

”Pro patria mori. ”

1226
01:26:26,013 --> 01:26:29,058
It is sweet and proper

1227
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:33,354
to die for one's country.

1228
01:26:50,871 --> 01:26:54,250
I, Nikolai aleksandrovich romanov,

1229
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:56,627
emperor of Russia,

1230
01:26:56,710 --> 01:26:59,130
do hereby declare
my irrevocable determination

1231
01:26:59,213 --> 01:27:01,298
to renounce the throne for myself

1232
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:02,466
and my descendants

1233
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:05,886
through this instrument of abdication...

1234
01:27:07,721 --> 01:27:09,265
Immediately.

1235
01:27:17,606 --> 01:27:19,567
All: Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

1236
01:27:35,624 --> 01:27:37,626
(Softly)
The documents Conrad recovered

1237
01:27:38,461 --> 01:27:40,296
turned out to be
the German ambassador's

1238
01:27:40,379 --> 01:27:43,674
original handwritten telegram
that I cracked.

1239
01:27:44,675 --> 01:27:47,219
It's the concrete proof america needed.

1240
01:27:47,928 --> 01:27:50,973
Shola: America will now
have to join the war.

1241
01:27:51,056 --> 01:27:54,059
Conrad succeeded where we all failed.

1242
01:27:57,521 --> 01:27:59,565
- (Swords clanging)
- (Men grunting)

1243
01:28:04,904 --> 01:28:06,030
Erik: My Shepherd.

1244
01:28:07,323 --> 01:28:08,675
Shepherd: There is a code of honor

1245
01:28:08,699 --> 01:28:11,869
and using a distraction
to your own advantage

1246
01:28:11,952 --> 01:28:13,621
breaks that code.

1247
01:28:13,704 --> 01:28:15,331
- What?
- Apologies, my Shepherd,

1248
01:28:15,414 --> 01:28:17,249
but I have disturbing news.

1249
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:20,836
While your plan for Russia
has been a great success,

1250
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:24,590
my plan to keep america
out of the war has backfired.

1251
01:28:25,216 --> 01:28:26,425
The American president

1252
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:28,219
is about to be given the actual telegram

1253
01:28:28,302 --> 01:28:29,720
I forced the kaiser to send.

1254
01:28:29,803 --> 01:28:31,722
Such undeniable proof

1255
01:28:31,805 --> 01:28:34,433
could provoke the Americans
into entering the war.

1256
01:28:35,643 --> 01:28:37,144
(Goats bleating)

1257
01:28:39,855 --> 01:28:41,106
Shepherd: En garde.

1258
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:50,199
I like a man who will admit
to his mistakes, I do.

1259
01:28:50,282 --> 01:28:54,828
But I like more a woman
who can fix them.

1260
01:28:54,912 --> 01:28:57,623
Have our American friend dupont

1261
01:28:57,706 --> 01:28:59,625
get mata into the white house.

1262
01:28:59,708 --> 01:29:01,794
Time for you to work your magic

1263
01:29:01,877 --> 01:29:04,088
on the president, mata.

1264
01:29:04,171 --> 01:29:05,589
Now, go on.

1265
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:08,300
It's time to show the president

1266
01:29:09,093 --> 01:29:11,595
who the real boss is.

1267
01:29:21,188 --> 01:29:22,523
Will your grace be having tea?

1268
01:29:25,985 --> 01:29:27,736
It's scotch time.

1269
01:29:28,654 --> 01:29:30,239
Twenty-four hours a day.

1270
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:42,585
(Door closes)

1271
01:30:07,484 --> 01:30:09,170
- (Knock on door, door opens)
- For the last time,

1272
01:30:09,194 --> 01:30:10,654
I don't want any fucking tea!

1273
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:12,156
Neither do I.

1274
01:30:13,699 --> 01:30:14,867
Oxford: Sir.

1275
01:30:17,828 --> 01:30:20,998
Though it looks like you could
use a strong one to sober up.

1276
01:30:22,416 --> 01:30:24,293
I'm afraid it'll take
more than that, sir.

1277
01:30:24,376 --> 01:30:26,920
Oh, well, maybe this will do the trick.

1278
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:28,797
Russia's pulled out of the war.

1279
01:30:29,673 --> 01:30:32,092
The British empire
faces imminent defeat.

1280
01:30:32,926 --> 01:30:35,554
America still refuses to join.

1281
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:39,516
I personally telephoned
president Wilson.

1282
01:30:40,934 --> 01:30:43,020
He didn't deign to receive my call.

1283
01:30:43,103 --> 01:30:46,023
Hmm. So, they got to him as well.

1284
01:30:46,106 --> 01:30:47,983
- King George: Indeed.
- Hmm.

1285
01:30:48,651 --> 01:30:50,569
The kaiser's blockade is working.

1286
01:30:51,403 --> 01:30:53,113
The people are hungry.

1287
01:30:53,906 --> 01:30:56,909
The next revolution might be here.

1288
01:30:58,535 --> 01:31:01,080
I've even been advised
to change my German surname

1289
01:31:01,163 --> 01:31:03,749
saxe-coburg to windsor.

1290
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:05,668
More English.

1291
01:31:05,751 --> 01:31:07,586
(Scoffing)

1292
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:10,005
I'm afraid, then, sir,

1293
01:31:10,547 --> 01:31:12,591
that england is doomed.

1294
01:31:20,015 --> 01:31:21,642
I wanted to give you this.

1295
01:31:23,102 --> 01:31:24,103
For Conrad.

1296
01:31:24,937 --> 01:31:27,523
A true hero.

1297
01:31:29,692 --> 01:31:32,111
A man who knew his duty.

1298
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:46,792
Enough of this self-pitying poppycock.

1299
01:31:47,459 --> 01:31:48,627
If it were just you...

1300
01:31:49,253 --> 01:31:53,465
You and I, in our grief,
I'd say do as you will.

1301
01:31:53,549 --> 01:31:57,469
Drown in drink, and I'd join you.

1302
01:31:58,512 --> 01:32:00,055
But he's watching.

1303
01:32:02,474 --> 01:32:05,185
And he would have been
such a better man.

1304
01:32:09,565 --> 01:32:11,108
But he can't.

1305
01:32:12,317 --> 01:32:16,113
He won't be that. Not anymore.

1306
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:20,868
So, you must, in his stead,

1307
01:32:22,536 --> 01:32:25,539
be the man your son would have been.

1308
01:32:32,421 --> 01:32:35,382
Regretfully, I can no longer
remain in your service.

1309
01:32:37,259 --> 01:32:38,719
Forgive me, my lady.

1310
01:32:47,519 --> 01:32:49,480
My heart is broken as well.

1311
01:32:50,606 --> 01:32:52,983
Polly. Polly.

1312
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:54,860
(Opens door)

1313
01:32:54,943 --> 01:32:56,737
I do not accept your resignation.

1314
01:32:59,448 --> 01:33:00,949
But...

1315
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:06,038
I will accept a very strong cup of tea.

1316
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:40,151
Looking better, your grace.

1317
01:33:42,157 --> 01:33:43,867
Feeling better, Polly.

1318
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:46,912
So, what have I missed?

1319
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:49,790
We followed your last sober order

1320
01:33:49,873 --> 01:33:53,085
and extended our network
to the white house.

1321
01:33:53,168 --> 01:33:54,878
The president's Butler informed us

1322
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:57,172
that since receiving
the telegram Conrad recovered

1323
01:33:57,256 --> 01:33:59,383
the president hasn't been himself

1324
01:33:59,466 --> 01:34:01,552
this may be the proof I asked for.

1325
01:34:01,635 --> 01:34:03,011
But remember my election promise.

1326
01:34:03,095 --> 01:34:04,972
Out of the war, not in.

1327
01:34:05,055 --> 01:34:07,808
Douglas, get me a statesman
on the rocks, now!

1328
01:34:07,891 --> 01:34:09,118
- (Phone rings)
- Polly: Constantly engaged

1329
01:34:09,142 --> 01:34:11,687
in top-secret conversations
with his embassy in London.

1330
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:14,231
And ignoring all advice to go to war.

1331
01:34:14,314 --> 01:34:16,483
And do we have someone in the embassy?

1332
01:34:16,567 --> 01:34:17,734
Of course.

1333
01:34:18,318 --> 01:34:19,318
Man: Mr. President...

1334
01:34:19,361 --> 01:34:21,029
I don't know how to proceed.

1335
01:34:21,113 --> 01:34:23,907
I/I/e 're meeting to discuss
her new demands.

1336
01:34:23,991 --> 01:34:25,534
- I see.
- She was very convincing.

1337
01:34:25,617 --> 01:34:28,412
And she suggests we make
an unannounced visit at 3:00.

1338
01:34:28,495 --> 01:34:32,082
Right, well. We had better
get a move on, then.

1339
01:34:46,388 --> 01:34:47,556
Oxford: Good afternoon.

1340
01:34:47,639 --> 01:34:48,974
Please inform the ambassador

1341
01:34:49,057 --> 01:34:50,851
the Duke of Oxford is here to see him.

1342
01:34:52,728 --> 01:34:54,146
Yes, your grace.

1343
01:34:54,229 --> 01:34:55,439
(Knock on door, door opens)

1344
01:34:55,522 --> 01:34:56,940
Mr. Ambassador.

1345
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,525
(Continues speaking indistinctly)

1346
01:35:02,529 --> 01:35:04,049
Oxford: I/I/hy did you kill my friend?

1347
01:35:04,489 --> 01:35:05,908
It was the alcohol.

1348
01:35:05,991 --> 01:35:06,992
I was overcome.

1349
01:35:08,368 --> 01:35:10,412
Mata: Thank you for your time,
Mr. Ambassador.

1350
01:35:13,999 --> 01:35:15,083
Hmm.

1351
01:35:17,544 --> 01:35:19,713
If you wouldn't mind...

1352
01:35:20,505 --> 01:35:23,842
I'm sorry. I couldn't help
admiring your scarf.

1353
01:35:23,926 --> 01:35:25,719
An exquisite cashmere.

1354
01:35:25,802 --> 01:35:27,179
Yes, it's very rare.

1355
01:35:27,262 --> 01:35:30,182
Hmm. Do you know the test
of a truly pure cashmere?

1356
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,851
- A ring.
- Mmm-hmm.

1357
01:35:32,935 --> 01:35:37,064
Yet, happily, you do not wear one.

1358
01:35:37,814 --> 01:35:39,775
You are

1359
01:35:41,109 --> 01:35:42,110
mistaken.

1360
01:35:42,194 --> 01:35:43,946
Now that

1361
01:35:45,155 --> 01:35:46,365
is disappointing.

1362
01:35:46,448 --> 01:35:48,033
But this

1363
01:35:49,534 --> 01:35:50,534
is not.

1364
01:35:57,167 --> 01:35:59,044
(Both grunting)

1365
01:36:02,839 --> 01:36:04,675
I believe it's ungentlemanly
to hurt a woman,

1366
01:36:04,758 --> 01:36:05,998
but since the fate of the world

1367
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:08,053
hangs in the balance,
I'm going to bend the rules.

1368
01:36:08,136 --> 01:36:09,346
Now tell me who's behind this,

1369
01:36:09,429 --> 01:36:12,224
or so help me,
you'll never breathe again.

1370
01:36:13,392 --> 01:36:15,602
You will have to kill me.

1371
01:36:25,153 --> 01:36:27,531
Ah... ambassador.

1372
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:30,951
- Is she dead?
- No.

1373
01:36:31,451 --> 01:36:34,079
She has an extreme case of hypoxia.

1374
01:36:34,162 --> 01:36:36,164
She'll be fine, and so will you,

1375
01:36:36,248 --> 01:36:38,834
as long as we have
an honest conversation.

1376
01:36:46,758 --> 01:36:48,093
Ambassador:
What you're lookin' at

1377
01:36:48,176 --> 01:36:50,470
is the lady you strangled.

1378
01:36:50,554 --> 01:36:53,223
She filmed herself
seducing the president

1379
01:36:53,306 --> 01:36:55,017
and is now blackmailing us

1380
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:57,936
to not even think
about entering the war.

1381
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:01,648
We cannot risk the integrity
of the us. Presidency.

1382
01:37:01,732 --> 01:37:03,025
I'm sure.

1383
01:37:03,108 --> 01:37:06,111
Now, if we can get that negative,

1384
01:37:06,194 --> 01:37:08,113
then we will happily join england

1385
01:37:08,196 --> 01:37:10,115
and put Germany out of business.

1386
01:37:10,198 --> 01:37:12,451
Well, I suggest you interrogate her.

1387
01:37:13,035 --> 01:37:16,288
And I'll follow up on this.

1388
01:37:18,749 --> 01:37:21,793
This is cashmere from the kamaliro goat.

1389
01:37:22,753 --> 01:37:23,754
It's very rare.

1390
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:25,589
Where does it come from?

1391
01:37:26,548 --> 01:37:29,259
Mr. Collins,
cashmere book number one, please.

1392
01:37:31,636 --> 01:37:32,637
Thank you.

1393
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:36,600
It comes from here.

1394
01:37:36,683 --> 01:37:38,185
The only place in the world

1395
01:37:38,268 --> 01:37:40,395
where the kamaliro goat breeds.

1396
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:42,481
Oxford: Excellent. Shola,

1397
01:37:42,981 --> 01:37:45,484
we're going into the cashmere business.

1398
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:06,421
I can see six men guarding the lift.

1399
01:38:08,632 --> 01:38:09,925
If you can call it that.

1400
01:38:10,008 --> 01:38:13,053
Give the word and their numbers
will be reduced.

1401
01:38:13,637 --> 01:38:14,638
Oh, no, Polly.

1402
01:38:14,721 --> 01:38:17,015
The film's negative
is going to be up there.

1403
01:38:17,099 --> 01:38:18,391
And that's our real prize.

1404
01:38:18,475 --> 01:38:21,686
If these guards are alerted,
then I don't think we'll make it up.

1405
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:23,814
It's vital that we control this lift.

1406
01:38:29,528 --> 01:38:32,864
This is called a parachute.

1407
01:38:33,365 --> 01:38:36,409
It means that one can jump
out of a plane safely.

1408
01:38:39,538 --> 01:38:42,040
Tomorrow at dawn I'll fly
the plane over the mountain

1409
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:43,625
and shola will jump out.

1410
01:38:44,292 --> 01:38:46,169
You land with the parachute,

1411
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:50,882
take control of the lift,
and then you fire this flare.

1412
01:38:51,383 --> 01:38:52,759
It's a signal to me,

1413
01:38:52,843 --> 01:38:54,845
by which time
I'll have landed the plane,

1414
01:38:54,928 --> 01:38:57,055
made my way over
to the bottom of the lift,

1415
01:38:57,139 --> 01:38:58,640
while Polly provides cover.

1416
01:38:59,558 --> 01:39:02,561
Sir, I could do anything for you,

1417
01:39:02,644 --> 01:39:05,063
but I cannot jump out of an airplane.

1418
01:39:05,564 --> 01:39:07,357
And it's not that I wouldn't try,

1419
01:39:08,608 --> 01:39:10,735
it's that I know I'd let you down.

1420
01:39:11,653 --> 01:39:14,239
Yes. Well, I appreciate
your fear of heights,

1421
01:39:14,322 --> 01:39:17,784
but I am the only one who can fly.
So...

1422
01:39:17,868 --> 01:39:19,578
But you wouldn't have to land the plane.

1423
01:39:19,661 --> 01:39:21,955
You just have to land yourself.

1424
01:39:23,707 --> 01:39:26,126
Hmm. Well, it, um...

1425
01:39:27,169 --> 01:39:29,754
It would be bad form to ask
a man to do something

1426
01:39:29,838 --> 01:39:32,174
that I wouldn't do myself.

1427
01:39:32,257 --> 01:39:36,094
All right, shola,
get ready for my signal.

1428
01:39:37,554 --> 01:39:38,889
We go at dawn.

1429
01:40:10,462 --> 01:40:12,130
(Engine stops)

1430
01:40:25,435 --> 01:40:26,853
(Screaming)

1431
01:40:29,105 --> 01:40:30,982
(Grunting)

1432
01:40:51,294 --> 01:40:52,462
(Grunting)

1433
01:40:55,924 --> 01:40:57,050
(Yelling)

1434
01:41:07,352 --> 01:41:09,020
(Screams)

1435
01:41:22,575 --> 01:41:24,160
Whoa.

1436
01:41:26,579 --> 01:41:28,456
(Goats bleating)

1437
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:40,468
(Grunting)

1438
01:41:44,681 --> 01:41:46,516
(Wind howling)

1439
01:41:49,602 --> 01:41:51,021
(Bleating)

1440
01:41:52,647 --> 01:41:53,648
(Groans)

1441
01:42:21,259 --> 01:42:22,802
(Grunting)

1442
01:43:03,009 --> 01:43:04,511
(Goat bleating)

1443
01:43:12,977 --> 01:43:14,104
(Grunts)

1444
01:43:14,187 --> 01:43:15,688
(Panting)

1445
01:43:30,995 --> 01:43:32,789
(Coats bleating)

1446
01:43:36,334 --> 01:43:37,752
(Rumbling)

1447
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:42,841
Shit!

1448
01:43:52,267 --> 01:43:54,144
(Growling)

1449
01:43:57,605 --> 01:43:58,982
- (Bleats)
- Oh!

1450
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:17,000
(Huffs)

1451
01:44:19,335 --> 01:44:22,839
Shh. That's it. That's it.

1452
01:44:34,225 --> 01:44:36,352
Shepherd:
Answer the question, dupont.

1453
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:39,564
Do you know where mata is?

1454
01:44:39,647 --> 01:44:40,648
Dupont: No. I...

1455
01:44:40,732 --> 01:44:42,775
Shepherd: Well, you fuckin' should.

1456
01:44:42,859 --> 01:44:45,278
Because I sent her
to the American embassy,

1457
01:44:45,361 --> 01:44:47,906
and she hasn't been
seen since! (Grunts)

1458
01:44:49,407 --> 01:44:51,034
Do you see this?

1459
01:44:51,117 --> 01:44:54,704
If the American president
thinks he can fuck me too,

1460
01:44:54,787 --> 01:44:56,706
he is very much mistaken.

1461
01:44:56,789 --> 01:44:59,209
Take this negative to the press,

1462
01:44:59,292 --> 01:45:01,711
and it will ruin his reputation.

1463
01:45:01,794 --> 01:45:05,548
War will be the last thing
on the Americans' mind.

1464
01:45:05,632 --> 01:45:07,467
And when the scandal is over,

1465
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:10,845
make sure the new president
is in our pocket!

1466
01:45:10,929 --> 01:45:13,014
Go on. Run! Run!

1467
01:45:13,097 --> 01:45:15,350
All the way to the white house.

1468
01:45:21,064 --> 01:45:22,357
Let's check the other side.

1469
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,150
Let's go around to the south.

1470
01:45:26,694 --> 01:45:28,863
Make it snappy, pal!

1471
01:45:43,336 --> 01:45:45,338
What the hell?

1472
01:45:46,422 --> 01:45:47,882
(Grunting)

1473
01:45:49,259 --> 01:45:50,885
(Crunts) (Yelps)

1474
01:45:50,969 --> 01:45:52,303
(Roars)

1475
01:45:52,387 --> 01:45:53,805
Buddy, what's the holdup?

1476
01:45:53,888 --> 01:45:56,641
(Growling)

1477
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:03,273
Look!

1478
01:46:04,065 --> 01:46:05,316
Polly: There's the signal.

1479
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,777
Get to the lift. I'll cover you.

1480
01:46:10,947 --> 01:46:11,948
(Fires gun)

1481
01:46:12,031 --> 01:46:13,908
(Screaming)

1482
01:46:13,992 --> 01:46:16,160
(Roars) (Crunts)

1483
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,083
Up on the hill!

1484
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:25,128
(Yells)

1485
01:46:39,017 --> 01:46:40,184
(Yelling)

1486
01:46:45,481 --> 01:46:46,482
(Grunts)

1487
01:46:47,191 --> 01:46:49,068
(Grunting)

1488
01:46:51,446 --> 01:46:53,239
(Yelling)

1489
01:46:59,996 --> 01:47:01,122
(Yelling)

1490
01:47:14,302 --> 01:47:15,470
(Yelling)

1491
01:47:17,221 --> 01:47:18,431
(Growls)

1492
01:47:19,057 --> 01:47:20,350
(Grunts)

1493
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:26,022
Who the hell is that guy?

1494
01:47:26,105 --> 01:47:27,940
(Screaming)

1495
01:47:28,024 --> 01:47:29,359
(Grunting)

1496
01:47:36,908 --> 01:47:38,076
(Gunshot)

1497
01:47:40,244 --> 01:47:42,121
(Laughing)

1498
01:47:46,584 --> 01:47:50,713
Shola! Stop fuckin' about!
Get on that countenlveight!

1499
01:47:58,846 --> 01:48:00,682
(Yells)

1500
01:48:05,395 --> 01:48:07,105
Oh, fuck!

1501
01:48:08,773 --> 01:48:10,650
(Screaming)

1502
01:48:16,614 --> 01:48:17,990
(Screaming)

1503
01:48:19,909 --> 01:48:21,828
(Groaning)

1504
01:48:35,133 --> 01:48:37,510
Oxford: (Sighs in relief)
Thank god you're here.

1505
01:48:38,636 --> 01:48:41,431
This plan hasn't exactly gone
by the numbers.

1506
01:48:43,224 --> 01:48:45,101
(Phone ringing)

1507
01:48:47,770 --> 01:48:49,605
Polly. Do you have the film?

1508
01:48:49,689 --> 01:48:51,774
I have the negative
in my hand, your grace.

1509
01:48:52,442 --> 01:48:53,693
Well done.

1510
01:48:53,776 --> 01:48:55,611
So we have what we came for.

1511
01:48:55,695 --> 01:48:58,448
Yes. But the cause of all this mayhem
is still in there.

1512
01:48:59,323 --> 01:49:01,951
Enough of dealing with tentacles, shola.

1513
01:49:02,034 --> 01:49:03,703
It's time to cut off the head.

1514
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:06,330
It's good to have you back, sir.

1515
01:49:11,252 --> 01:49:12,754
(Men clamoring)

1516
01:49:12,837 --> 01:49:14,046
(All grunting)

1517
01:49:35,568 --> 01:49:37,612
(Door creaking)

1518
01:49:45,328 --> 01:49:46,370
(Gunfire)

1519
01:50:01,719 --> 01:50:06,224
Shepherd: You have got to be
fucking kidding me.

1520
01:50:06,307 --> 01:50:08,559
The Thorn in my side

1521
01:50:08,643 --> 01:50:12,396
has just been
a peace-loving English Rose.

1522
01:50:13,105 --> 01:50:17,151
The Duke of Oxford.
Good day to you, sir!

1523
01:50:18,027 --> 01:50:19,737
You are the very symbol

1524
01:50:19,821 --> 01:50:22,281
of everything I'm tryin' to destroy.

1525
01:50:22,365 --> 01:50:24,075
Aristocrats like you

1526
01:50:24,158 --> 01:50:27,411
stole my parents' mill
in Scotland when I was a lad.

1527
01:50:27,954 --> 01:50:31,624
Entitlement has "title" in it
for a reason, no? Huh!

1528
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:36,212
I'm gonna fucking love killing you.

1529
01:50:36,295 --> 01:50:39,006
Come to papa, you posh prick!

1530
01:50:50,017 --> 01:50:51,017
I'm out.

1531
01:50:59,318 --> 01:51:00,318
(Gun clicking)

1532
01:51:02,071 --> 01:51:03,364
(Gun clicking)

1533
01:51:07,827 --> 01:51:10,705
Shepherd: The sound of silence.

1534
01:51:11,289 --> 01:51:14,792
It's my understanding that you, Duke,

1535
01:51:14,876 --> 01:51:16,919
are a formidable swordsman.

1536
01:51:17,753 --> 01:51:23,009
What say we end this shite as gentlemen?

1537
01:51:23,926 --> 01:51:25,094
After all,

1538
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:28,139
manners maketh man.

1539
01:51:28,806 --> 01:51:31,976
A gentleman does not hide
in the shadows.

1540
01:51:33,227 --> 01:51:34,228
Shepherd: Aye.

1541
01:51:47,158 --> 01:51:48,784
(In English accent) Surprise.

1542
01:51:57,084 --> 01:51:58,210
Morton.

1543
01:51:59,921 --> 01:52:00,922
You see,

1544
01:52:01,672 --> 01:52:02,757
a little misplaced trust

1545
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:04,967
allows one to get away with murder.

1546
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:08,179
This debate should happen
after we have won the war.

1547
01:52:09,263 --> 01:52:13,100
I suggest we go to Russia,
and we sort it out ourselves.

1548
01:52:13,184 --> 01:52:14,894
And in poor kitchener's case,

1549
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:18,940
quite literally.

1550
01:52:22,735 --> 01:52:24,153
Spoken like a true traitor.

1551
01:52:24,236 --> 01:52:27,156
(In normal accent)
As far as I'm concerned, his blood...

1552
01:52:28,157 --> 01:52:29,241
(Spits)

1553
01:52:30,284 --> 01:52:32,495
That's on your grubby hands.

1554
01:52:35,122 --> 01:52:36,207
Two on one?

1555
01:52:37,124 --> 01:52:39,919
Behaving like a true gentleman.

1556
01:52:44,131 --> 01:52:45,716
You're delusional.

1557
01:52:46,384 --> 01:52:47,593
And you've killed millions.

1558
01:52:47,677 --> 01:52:49,053
(Clicks)

1559
01:52:49,136 --> 01:52:51,889
What say one more, for good measure?

1560
01:52:58,479 --> 01:52:59,605
(Croans)

1561
01:53:00,439 --> 01:53:01,732
(Yelling)

1562
01:53:05,111 --> 01:53:06,612
(Both grunting)

1563
01:53:26,966 --> 01:53:27,966
(Yells)

1564
01:53:30,177 --> 01:53:32,346
(Chuckling) Come on, old man.

1565
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:34,056
- (Groans)
- Get up.

1566
01:53:34,849 --> 01:53:36,934
I said, get up!

1567
01:53:48,654 --> 01:53:50,197
(Both grunting)

1568
01:54:42,625 --> 01:54:44,085
(Croans)

1569
01:54:58,307 --> 01:55:00,893
Fuck this gentleman shite.

1570
01:55:14,365 --> 01:55:15,866
(Coats bleating)

1571
01:55:18,661 --> 01:55:19,870
(Croans)

1572
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,335
Fuck's sake.

1573
01:55:32,091 --> 01:55:33,384
(Grunting)

1574
01:55:33,467 --> 01:55:35,344
You bastard.

1575
01:55:35,427 --> 01:55:37,263
(Both grunting)

1576
01:56:02,329 --> 01:56:04,165
(Screaming)

1577
01:56:12,131 --> 01:56:15,968
Give my regards to dear old kitch, yeah?

1578
01:56:17,052 --> 01:56:18,637
(Screaming)

1579
01:56:23,058 --> 01:56:24,268
(Bleats)

1580
01:56:24,351 --> 01:56:25,561
(Yelling)

1581
01:56:34,570 --> 01:56:37,531
You can't do it. You can't let me fall.

1582
01:56:37,615 --> 01:56:39,909
It goes against your every belief.

1583
01:56:39,992 --> 01:56:42,411
You are a pacifist.

1584
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:45,873
(In English accent)
And I'm now completely reliant

1585
01:56:45,956 --> 01:56:47,458
on your mercy, old boy.

1586
01:56:47,541 --> 01:56:50,586
You're right. I shouldn't let you fall.

1587
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:56,508
Only now I have become the man
that my son would have been.

1588
01:56:59,553 --> 01:57:01,764
You... (Screaming)

1589
01:57:08,103 --> 01:57:09,939
(Conti n u es screaming)

1590
01:57:30,251 --> 01:57:31,543
Sir.

1591
01:57:31,627 --> 01:57:33,504
Shola, are you all right?

1592
01:57:34,505 --> 01:57:36,632
We've been through worse, your grace.

1593
01:57:38,050 --> 01:57:40,803
So, you'd jump
in front of a bullet for me,

1594
01:57:40,886 --> 01:57:42,638
but not out of an airplane?

1595
01:57:44,265 --> 01:57:45,849
So it would seem. (Chuckles)

1596
01:57:47,184 --> 01:57:48,644
Thank you, my friend.

1597
01:57:48,727 --> 01:57:50,187
My pleasure.

1598
01:57:51,939 --> 01:57:53,649
- So, shola.
- Hmm?

1599
01:57:53,732 --> 01:57:56,652
How are we going to get down from here?

1600
01:58:09,290 --> 01:58:10,708
President Wilson: Come in.

1601
01:58:11,375 --> 01:58:14,712
Mr. President, chef has made
your favorite peanut butter cookies.

1602
01:58:19,967 --> 01:58:21,302
Thank you.

1603
01:58:38,777 --> 01:58:42,114
Get me the generals, immediately.

1604
01:58:46,452 --> 01:58:48,704
We're goin' to war!

1605
01:58:52,583 --> 01:58:54,585
(All cheering)

1606
01:59:04,803 --> 01:59:08,474
King George:
This victory is all down to you

1607
01:59:08,557 --> 01:59:11,852
and your fine son, Conrad.

1608
01:59:11,935 --> 01:59:15,105
And the courage of so many others, sir.

1609
01:59:15,189 --> 01:59:16,523
Of course.

1610
01:59:18,150 --> 01:59:20,861
Britain thanks you. And I thank you

1611
01:59:20,944 --> 01:59:23,405
for ensuring that
I didn't meet the same fate

1612
01:59:23,489 --> 01:59:24,698
as my cousins.

1613
01:59:25,783 --> 01:59:28,535
I/I/I/he/m's abdication was understandable,

1614
01:59:29,787 --> 01:59:31,789
but what happened to Nicholas...

1615
01:59:32,664 --> 01:59:33,749
(Woman screams)

1616
01:59:34,666 --> 01:59:36,210
Was despicable.

1617
01:59:36,293 --> 01:59:38,003
It was, sir.

1618
01:59:38,087 --> 01:59:39,880
I owe you a great personal debt

1619
01:59:39,963 --> 01:59:41,924
that I still have my crown.

1620
01:59:44,551 --> 01:59:46,053
In that case,

1621
01:59:46,136 --> 01:59:49,807
would you meet me tomorrow
at kingsman, 3:00?

1622
01:59:49,890 --> 01:59:51,934
- A tailor shop?
- Yes, sir.

1623
01:59:52,017 --> 01:59:54,770
Number 11, savile row.

1624
02:00:00,025 --> 02:00:03,278
All of us here today are united,

1625
02:00:03,362 --> 02:00:07,157
sadly, in losing our sons and friends

1626
02:00:07,241 --> 02:00:09,284
in this terrible war.

1627
02:00:09,368 --> 02:00:12,204
What happened to this
generation of young men

1628
02:00:12,287 --> 02:00:14,373
must never happen again.

1629
02:00:14,456 --> 02:00:17,751
I believe the terms
of versailles are too onerous,

1630
02:00:17,835 --> 02:00:22,256
too extreme, and could
precipitate another war.

1631
02:00:22,339 --> 02:00:25,092
What the world needs is an organization

1632
02:00:25,175 --> 02:00:26,468
that can channel its resources

1633
02:00:26,552 --> 02:00:31,098
towards preserving peace
and protecting life.

1634
02:00:31,181 --> 02:00:34,101
An independent intelligence agency

1635
02:00:34,184 --> 02:00:37,271
operating at the highest level
of discretion,

1636
02:00:37,354 --> 02:00:39,606
above the politics and bureaucracy

1637
02:00:39,690 --> 02:00:42,734
of government-run spy organizations.

1638
02:00:43,485 --> 02:00:44,736
To that end,

1639
02:00:45,571 --> 02:00:48,532
I have acquired this shop.

1640
02:00:48,615 --> 02:00:53,620
And I propose that we become
the founding members of

1641
02:00:54,329 --> 02:00:56,999
the kingsman agency.

1642
02:00:58,667 --> 02:01:00,586
My code name will be...

1643
02:01:02,337 --> 02:01:03,464
Arthur.

1644
02:01:04,006 --> 02:01:05,424
And if you agree to join me,

1645
02:01:05,507 --> 02:01:07,092
you may turn over your place card,

1646
02:01:07,176 --> 02:01:09,595
where you will find your own code name.

1647
02:01:12,389 --> 02:01:14,391
I am Galahad.

1648
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:16,643
(Chuckles softly)

1649
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:19,938
I am Lancelot.

1650
02:01:21,607 --> 02:01:24,401
I am bedivere.

1651
02:01:27,696 --> 02:01:29,615
I am percival.

1652
02:01:29,698 --> 02:01:30,866
Excellent.

1653
02:01:32,201 --> 02:01:35,370
And this is Merlin,

1654
02:01:35,454 --> 02:01:38,373
who will be our quartermaster.

1655
02:01:39,333 --> 02:01:42,669
May our sons and friends rest in peace.

1656
02:01:42,753 --> 02:01:46,298
And long live the kingsman.

1657
02:01:47,633 --> 02:01:49,468
All: The kingsman.

1658
02:02:10,948 --> 02:02:12,824
Your body

1659
02:02:12,908 --> 02:02:16,662
ll/lo ves like a river
through a house of stone

1660
02:02:17,621 --> 02:02:19,331
so softly

1661
02:02:19,414 --> 02:02:22,960
like a shadow never comes undone

1662
02:02:24,419 --> 02:02:26,713
you can never know

1663
02:02:26,797 --> 02:02:30,509
your destiny

1664
02:02:30,592 --> 02:02:33,428
or what the mirror shows you

1665
02:02:33,512 --> 02:02:37,266
isn't real

1666
02:02:37,349 --> 02:02:40,435
only you can

1667
02:02:40,519 --> 02:02:43,397
7'ru/y understand

1668
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:47,734
the measure of a hero

1669
02:02:47,818 --> 02:02:53,490
is the measure of a man

1670
02:02:54,658 --> 02:03:01,123
the measure of a man

1671
02:03:02,332 --> 02:03:04,042
nobody

1672
02:03:04,126 --> 02:03:07,754
sees the man behind the face you show

1673
02:03:08,755 --> 02:03:10,507
nobody

1674
02:03:10,591 --> 02:03:14,094
feels the burden that is yours alone

1675
02:03:15,596 --> 02:03:17,764
you can never know

1676
02:03:17,848 --> 02:03:21,602
your destiny

1677
02:03:22,102 --> 02:03:24,730
or what the mirror shows you

1678
02:03:24,813 --> 02:03:28,567
isn't real

1679
02:03:28,650 --> 02:03:31,778
only you can

1680
02:03:31,862 --> 02:03:34,906
7'ru/y understand

1681
02:03:34,990 --> 02:03:39,620
the measure of a hero

1682
02:03:39,703 --> 02:03:46,209
is the measure of a man

1683
02:03:47,753 --> 02:03:50,756
now it's time to address
the balance of my new flock.

1684
02:03:50,839 --> 02:03:53,467
Thanks to you, comrade,
our left hand is strong.

1685
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:54,801
But as you once said,

1686
02:03:54,885 --> 02:03:56,887
our right hand now needs strengthening.

1687
02:03:56,970 --> 02:03:58,305
(Banging on door)

1688
02:03:58,388 --> 02:03:59,973
Come in.

1689
02:04:00,057 --> 02:04:01,475
(Door opens)

1690
02:04:04,853 --> 02:04:06,355
Don't be shy.

1691
02:04:06,938 --> 02:04:07,981
Come, come.

1692
02:04:12,444 --> 02:04:13,445
My Shepherd.

1693
02:04:14,154 --> 02:04:16,239
This young man will come to rival

1694
02:04:16,323 --> 02:04:18,659
your position in this world, my friend.

1695
02:04:19,743 --> 02:04:21,870
It is an honor, comrade Lenin.

1696
02:04:23,955 --> 02:04:25,582
And your name?

1697
02:04:27,376 --> 02:04:29,086
Adolf Hitler.
