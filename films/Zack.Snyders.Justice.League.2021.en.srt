1
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Alert the queen.

2
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hyah!

3
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,976
Bruce Vayne.

4
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Bruce Wayne.

5
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Talk.

6
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,976
I believe there is a stranger.

7
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,977
- Comes to this village.
- From the sea.

8
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,477
He comes in the winter

9
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:37,976
when the people are hungry.

10
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,976
He brings fish.

11
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,976
He comes on the king tide.

12
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That was last night.

13
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,976
You have eyes, so see.

14
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,976
Icebergs in the harbor.

15
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,477
It's four months since

16
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:56,976
the last ship got through.

17
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,977
Well, this stranger

18
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:01,000
doesn't come by ship.

19
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,977
There are enemies

20
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:12,000
coming from far away.

21
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,976
I need warriors.

22
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,477
This stranger,

23
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:17,976
others like him.

24
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,477
I'm building an alliance

25
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:22,976
to defend ourselves.

26
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,477
It's very important

27
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:26,000
that I see this man.

28
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,976
If this stranger exists,

29
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,976
he'll give him your message.

30
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,977
$5,000 American.

31
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:34,976
Look, I'll give you $25,000

32
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,477
to talk to this man

33
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:38,000
right now, outside.

34
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,477
How dare this dog

35
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,976
speak to us like children.

36
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,976
Ooh, magical man from the sea.

37
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,976
We are poor, not stupid.

38
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Get out.

39
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,977
Can't do that.

41
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll leave after we've spoken.

42
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He said, "Get out."

43
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,976
Arthur Curry.

44
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,477
Also known as.

45
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:40,976
Protector of the Oceans.

46
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The Aquaman.

47
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,977
So, let me

48
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:49,977
get this straight.

49
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,977
You do it dressed like a bat?

50
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:53,976
Like an actual bat?

51
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,976
Worked for 20 years in Gotham.

52
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,976
Oh, that shithole.

53
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,977
- When the fight comes,
- we'll need you.

54
00:12:00,003 --> 00:12:01,977
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

55
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:03,976
- 'Cause I don't like. - You coming here,
- Digging into my business.

56
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,477
And getting into my life.

57
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:06,976
I want to be left alone.

58
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,976
Is that why you do this?

59
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,977
- Why you help these people out.
- Here in the middle of nowhere?

60
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:11,977
I've read the stories.

61
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,977
- Your good deeds.
- You think no one sees.

62
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:15,976
You'll join us.

63
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,977
"Strong man

64
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:17,976
is strongest alone."

65
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,977
You ever heard that?

66
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:20,977
- You ever hear - of Superman?

67
00:12:21,003 --> 00:12:23,000
He died fighting next to me.

68
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,977
My point exactly.

69
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:26,477
He believed

70
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:27,976
we were stronger together.

71
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We owe it to him.

72
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't owe anyone anything.

73
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,976
Dressed like a bat.

74
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,977
- You're out of your mind,
- Bruce Wayne.

75
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Move over, Dusty.

76
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,477
My God, Master Wayne,

77
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:12,976
but this is cold.

78
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,977
Maybe we can catch

79
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,976
the next king tide in Jamaica?

80
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,477
Might be

81
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,976
a metahuman or two in Fiji.

82
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,976
Costa Rica's nice.

83
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I found him.

84
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,976
He said no.

85
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,477
So the draft stands

86
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:31,000
at naught for two?

87
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,477
Maybe a man who broods

88
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:35,976
in a cave for a living

89
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,977
isn't cut out to be

90
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,000
a recruiter. Hmm?

91
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000

Keep quiet!

119
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:22,976
Shut up! Shut up!

120
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Shut them up too!

121
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,477
We'll be making

122
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,976
a statement shortly.

123
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,977
- Until then,
- if I see any movement,

124
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:33,977
- You'll have a lot of dead kids.
- On your hands.

125
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,976
Should I take him?

126
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Hold your fire.

127
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,040
They've got kids in there.

128
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,977
- Yeah,
- he's not bluffing, chief.

129
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:00,977
- St. Brigid's had.
- A school trip today.

130
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Quiet! Shut up!

131
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,976
Down with the modern world.

132
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Back to the Dark Ages.

133
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Quiet!

134
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,477
I said

135
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:47,000
shut your fucking mouth.

136
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,976
-Who are you?

137
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,477
The Lasso of Hestia compels

138
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:06,000
you to reveal the truth.

139
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,976
Now, who are you?

140
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,477
We're a small group

141
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:11,976
of reactionary terrorists

142
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,977
who wanna turn back

143
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:13,977
the clock in Europe

144
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:15,977
- a thousand years.
- Boring. Why the hostages?

145
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:17,976
We have no demands.

146
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,977
- We're just stalling the police.
- While we do it.

147
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:20,977
While you do what?

148
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:22,977
You're too late.

149
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:25,000
The countdown's already begun.

150
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,477
In a few minutes,

151
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:29,000
four city blocks...

152
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
while the world watches.

153
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,977
No!

154
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,977
- Like lambs - to the slaughter.

155
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,976
I don't believe it.

156
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Believe it.

157
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,477
Is everyone all right?

158
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:46,976
Are you okay?

159
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,976
Good. It's okay.

160
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,977
- It's okay. It's over.
- You can stand up.

161
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:52,976
It's all good.

162
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,977
It's over now.

163
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:54,977
Are you okay?

164
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:57,000
You okay? Good.

165
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Are you okay, princess?

166
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Can I be like you someday?

167
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,477
You can be anything

168
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:14,000
you want to be.

169
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Come on. Let's go.

170
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,977
Any changes today?

171
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,000
No, my Queen.

172
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,976
The Mother Box has awoken,

173
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,976
yet nothing has happened.

174
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,477
It has slept

175
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:12,976
for thousands of years

176
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,976
since the First Age.

177
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Why did it wake at all?

178
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,977
- This is the first time.
- It's gone quiet.

179
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:26,977
Since the crack appeared.

180
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:28,477
Maybe it's going

181
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:30,000
back to sleep.

182
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Evil does not sleep.

183
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It waits.

184
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Something is coming.

185
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Prepare for battle!

186
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,977
Amazons,

187
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:16,977
on your marks!

188
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:19,000
Ready!

189
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Defenders.

190
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,477
They have failed

191
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,976
100,000 worlds.

192
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
They always fail.

193
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,977
I've come to enlighten you

194
00:27:58,001 --> 00:27:59,976
to the great darkness.

195
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I will bathe in your fear.

196
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Daughters of Themyscira,

197
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,977
show him your fear!

198
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:13,000
We have no fear!

199
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Gather the legions!

200
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,976
Go with her!

201
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You must seal the cage!

202
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,977
-Go!

203
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:40,001
-Phillipus!

204
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
No!

205
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Behind you!

206
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Ahhh!

207
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Epione.

208
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Honor us. It's right.

209
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Seal it.

210
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Ready the hammers!

211
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Seal it now!

212
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,977
Guard it with your life.

213
00:31:36,001 --> 00:31:37,977
- Yes, my Queen.
- Keep it moving.

214
00:31:38,003 --> 00:31:40,000
Hyah! Hyah!

215
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Hyah!

216
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Got it! Go!

217
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Hyah!

218
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,977
Oh, noble Queen.

219
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:53,000
Why do you fight?

220
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,976
You can't save her.

221
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You can't save any of them.

222
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,976
The great darkness begins.

223
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Amazons!

224
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yes, we will find the others.

225
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
-Draw!

226
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Loose!

227
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,977
He's gone back

228
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:30,976
to his universe.

229
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
No.

230
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,976
He's gone to the lands of men

231
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,976
to find the other two boxes.

232
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,477
We have to light

233
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:42,976
the ancient warning fire.

234
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,977
The fire has not burned

235
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:46,976
for 5,000 years.

236
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,976
Men won't know what it means.

237
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Men won't.

238
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
She will.

239
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,976
It's toxic.

240
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
That's good.

241
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,977
Go!

242
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:52,477
Follow the scent

243
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:53,976
of the Mother Boxes.

244
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,977
Find the missing two.

245
00:37:55,001 --> 00:37:56,977
Once they are found,

246
00:37:57,001 --> 00:37:58,976
The Unity will be formed.

247
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,477
This world

248
00:38:00,501 --> 00:38:02,000
will join the others.

249
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,976
He will be pleased.

250
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
He will see my worth again.

251
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,976
Hey.

252
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,977
- Anything on that kid.
- From the liquor store?

253
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:18,000
Possibly.

254
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,976
"Possibly."

255
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,477
If I had a dollar

256
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:23,976
for every "possibly."

257
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,477
Yeah, it would make you

258
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:27,000
even more insufferable.

259
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,477
Facial scan might have

260
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:31,976
got a hit on him,

261
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,976
our disappearing man.

262
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,977
One Mr. Barry Allen

263
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:39,000
from Central City.

264
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,977
- Might be.
- Another false positive,

265
00:38:41,001 --> 00:38:42,641
- You'll have to give me.
- A little time.

266
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,977
- To confirm.
- We don't have any more time.

267
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,977
Master Wayne,

268
00:38:48,001 --> 00:38:49,477
you've been working

269
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:50,976
as if there's no tomorrow

270
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,977
to build this team

271
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:53,976
of people you can't even find.

272
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,977
- I found one.
- I found two, including Diana.

273
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:58,000
Just because Lex Luthor says

274
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,480
- the planet's.
- In danger of attack?

275
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,977
- This has nothing.
- To do with Lex Luthor.

276
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:03,977
It has to do with him.

277
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:05,977
I made a promise to him

278
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:07,976
on his grave.

279
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,977
I spent a lot of time

280
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:11,976
trying to divide us.

281
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,477
I need to bring us together

282
00:39:13,501 --> 00:39:14,976
and make this right.

283
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,477
Well, it's been some time

284
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:17,976
since Luthor's warning.

285
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,977
No attacks.

286
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:21,976
No barbarians at the gate.

287
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,977
Maybe these barbarians

288
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:25,976
don't use a gate.

289
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Maybe they're already here.

290
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,977
- Keep looking.
- What else do you have?

291
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,976
Lab's all yours, Howard.

292
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,976
11:30.

293
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,977
Early night for you, Silas.

294
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:19,976
Yes, early night.

295
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,200
Tell your family I said hello.

296
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
What the...

297
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Jesus.

298
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,976
The Arrow of Artemis.

299
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,477
It will reach

300
00:42:20,501 --> 00:42:22,000
the lands of men.

301
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,977
Sky torch,

302
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:34,976
hero beacon,

303
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,976
scatter the darkness.

304
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,477
Burn as you burned

305
00:42:38,501 --> 00:42:40,000
in days before.

306
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,977
Show her the darkness before

307
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:44,976
the daylight of history.

308
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,977
Warn my daughter

309
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:49,000
that war has come

310
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
and protect her.

311
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Return to me, Diana.

312
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,477
What did you do

313
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:00,976
this weekend, Diana?

314
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,976
Nothing very interesting.

315
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,976
That's all you ever tell us.

316
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,477
What can I do?

317
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:08,976
I'm not that exciting.

318
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,477
You might as well disappear

319
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:14,000
when you walk out of here.

320
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,977
Again?

321
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:20,977
- What is it?
- Now what?

322
00:44:21,003 --> 00:44:24,000
Budget cuts, tomb raiders.

323
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Now add to the list "arson."

324
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,976
Yes, good morning.

325
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,977
-From the isle of Crete.

326
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:33,976
As you can see behind me,

327
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,977
an enormous bonfire

328
00:44:35,001 --> 00:44:35,977
is burning.

329
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:37,477
This fire has been burning

330
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:38,976
through the night.

331
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,977
We're now into the morning

332
00:44:40,001 --> 00:44:41,977
- and we are.
- At least five miles away.

333
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,477
And we can still

334
00:44:44,501 --> 00:44:45,976
see it burning as we speak.

335
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,477
This has baffled locals and

336
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:48,976
government authorities alike

337
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,976
here at this historical site

338
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,477
of the so-called shrine

339
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:53,976
of the Amazons.

340
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,979
- Now, locals and government.
- Officials are baffled as to.

341
00:44:56,003 --> 00:44:57,977
- What may have caused this.
- Invasion.

342
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,977
Ryan.

343
00:45:08,001 --> 00:45:09,977
- Hiya, Doc.
- Is the...

344
00:45:10,003 --> 00:45:11,977
- No damage.
- To the electron-laser.

345
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:13,977
- Uh, Dr. Silas Stone?
- Yeah.

346
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,977
- Ryan Choi?
- That's us.

347
00:45:16,003 --> 00:45:17,477
Um, who did this?

348
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:18,976
Did they steal anything?

349
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,977
- They took.
- Whatever was in here.

350
00:45:20,003 --> 00:45:21,977
That? Oh, that wasn't stolen.

351
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:23,976
Was it, Dr. Stone?

352
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,477
No. That was misplaced

353
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:26,976
a while ago.

354
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,977
Object 6-1-9-8-2. Department

355
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:30,976
of Defense Archives.

356
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,977
Mmm-hmm.

357
00:45:32,001 --> 00:45:33,001
-What was it?

358
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,976
I don't know.

359
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,977
You don't know?

360
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:37,979
- I don't know, which was why.
- I was studying it.

361
00:45:38,003 --> 00:45:39,976
What's your rank, Doctor?

362
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,977
Ryan, would you, uh,

363
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:41,977
do the honors?

364
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:43,977
- Sure. Okay.
- Thanks.

365
00:45:44,003 --> 00:45:45,977
- Civilian. STARLABS.
- Is a private contractor.

366
00:45:46,003 --> 00:45:47,976
We work for the DoD.

367
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,477
We advise them

368
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:50,976
on xeno-science.

369
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,977
"Xeno-science"?

370
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:54,000
Alien technology.

371
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
For example,

372
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
the Superman ship.

373
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,976
Eight people

374
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,977
- never signed out.
- Of the lab last night, Doctor.

375
00:46:17,001 --> 00:46:17,977
Cleaning staff, guards,

376
00:46:18,001 --> 00:46:19,977
- a few of.
- Your research scientists.

377
00:46:20,001 --> 00:46:21,001
They were abducted.

378
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,976
Are you sure?

379
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,977
Witness saw it all.

380
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:25,977
He escaped.

381
00:46:26,001 --> 00:46:27,977
He's here in quarantine now,

382
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:30,000
working on an ID sketch.

383
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,477
Any idea who

384
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:37,000
or what that might be?

385
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,977
The box

386
00:46:58,001 --> 00:46:59,001
isn't safe here.

387
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,977
Victor,

388
00:47:03,001 --> 00:47:04,977
- they came looking for it.
- At the lab.

389
00:47:05,003 --> 00:47:07,477
People were taken by some kind

390
00:47:07,501 --> 00:47:10,000
of monster or something.

391
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,976
You know a lot about monsters,

392
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
don't you?

393
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Especially how to make 'em.

394
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Mayday! Mayday, mayday!

395
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,977
My hull is breached.

396
00:50:33,001 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm going down.

397
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,976
Mayday!

398
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Is there anybody out there?

399
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Ahh!

400
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Whiskey.

401
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,977
Tell him to respect

402
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:37,001
the storm next time.

403
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It's on him.

404
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000

405
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000

King who would be man.

417
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,477
Son of a human father

418
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:21,000
and Queen of the Seas.

419
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,976
All the time I've wasted

420
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,477
trying to keep the promise

421
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:27,000
I made to your mother.

422
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,977
- Are you finished, - old man?

423
00:54:30,003 --> 00:54:31,477
You never sleep

424
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:32,976
in the same place twice,

425
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
yet you keep coming back here.

426
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,976
I like it. It's quiet.

427
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,976
It's your inheritance.

428
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,977
- You're the rightful king.
- Of Atlantis.

429
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,977
Our people suffer.

430
00:54:46,001 --> 00:54:47,976
Your people.

431
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,977
A brutal, petty,

432
00:54:50,001 --> 00:54:51,976
superstitious race.

433
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Is the surface any different?

434
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,977
Nobody calls me.

435
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,001
King of the Surface.

436
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,976
What do you want, Vulko?

437
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,977
- Guards near - the stronghold.

438
00:55:01,003 --> 00:55:02,976
Have been disappearing.

439
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,976
Snatchers from above.

440
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,976
Talk to King Orm.

441
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,977
- Your brother?
- Half-brother.

442
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:08,977
He's trying to fan the flames

443
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:10,976
of war with the surface.

444
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,976
He lies.

445
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,977
- The snatchers have come.
- From the dark place.

446
00:55:16,003 --> 00:55:18,000
They're looking for it.

447
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,977
The Mother Box

448
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:22,976
our people guard is not safe.

449
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,977
Go to the stronghold

450
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:25,001
of Atlantis.

451
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Protect the box.

452
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
The time has come.

453
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Take up your mother's trident.

454
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,977
You can't turn your back

455
00:55:46,001 --> 00:55:48,000
on the world forever, Arthur.

456
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Above or below.

457
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,976
DeSaad.

458
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
DeSaad! I call to thee.

459
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,477
Steppenwolf,

460
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:40,976
have you begun the conquest?

461
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,976
This world is divided.

462
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,976
They are a primitive species.

463
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,477
Unevolved and at war

464
00:56:47,501 --> 00:56:48,976
with one another.

465
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,976
Too separate to be one.

466
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,977
- Their free will.
- Must be ripped from them,

467
00:56:54,003 --> 00:56:55,976
Like the other worlds.

468
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,977
Given absolution

469
00:56:58,001 --> 00:56:59,976
in one glorious belief,

470
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
to serve him.

471
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,976
The Mother Boxes?

472
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,976
I have found one of the three.

473
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,477
The one that woke

474
00:57:09,501 --> 00:57:10,976
and called to me.

475
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,976
The other two still sleep,

476
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,977
but the parademons

477
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:16,976
feel their presence.

478
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,977
They fly,

479
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:19,977
they search, they take

480
00:57:20,001 --> 00:57:21,976
prisoners who carry the scent,

481
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,477
while I build a stronghold

482
00:57:24,501 --> 00:57:27,000
in the name of his glory.

483
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Yes.

484
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,976
Mighty Steppenwolf,

485
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,977
who might have sat here

486
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:39,000
by the side of the great one.

487
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
But undone by his self-pride.

488
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
DeSaad...

489
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,976
I fall before you.

490
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,976
Let me make a plea to him

491
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,976
that I may come home

492
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,477
after I take this world

493
00:57:57,501 --> 00:57:58,976
in his name.

494
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
You betrayed him.

495
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,976
Your own family.

496
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,976
I saw my mistake.

497
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,477
I slaughtered those

498
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:09,976
who sought his throne.

499
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,477
You still owe the great one

500
00:58:12,501 --> 00:58:15,000
50,000 more worlds.

501
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
He will hear your plea

502
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
when you pay your debt.

503
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,477
The Mother Boxes

504
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:27,000
will be found and united.

505
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,976
No protectors here.

506
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.

507
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,477
This world will fall,

508
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:37,000
like all the others.

509
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
For Darkseid.

510
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
For Darkseid.

511
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,977
- You know,
- I paid millions of dollars.

512
00:59:09,001 --> 00:59:09,977
For this building's security.

513
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:11,977
- You got - your money's worth.

514
00:59:12,003 --> 00:59:13,477
Took me almost a minute

515
00:59:13,501 --> 00:59:15,000
to disable it.

516
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Hi there.

517
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
A new toy?

518
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Prototype troop carrier.

519
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I once knew a man

520
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,977
who would have loved

521
00:59:28,001 --> 00:59:28,977
to fly it.

522
00:59:29,001 --> 00:59:30,977
- The best minds.
- At Wayne Aerospace.

523
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,001
Couldn't make it fly.

524
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,976
But you can?

525
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,976
I have no choice.

526
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,477
I need more range

527
00:59:38,501 --> 00:59:39,976
and I need more cargo.

528
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,977
- I think.
- There's an attack coming.

529
00:59:42,003 --> 00:59:43,976
Not coming, Bruce.

530
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,976
It's already here.

531
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,976
From what I've learned,

532
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,477
they are things

533
00:59:50,501 --> 00:59:51,976
from another universe.

534
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,976
They serve a dark power.

535
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,976
An old power.

536
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,976
What do they want?

537
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,977
To invade.

538
01:00:00,001 --> 01:00:01,976
To conquer.

539
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,977
They came here once before,

540
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:06,000
long ago.

541
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,477
A great armada

542
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:13,976
appeared in the sky,

543
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,977
- laying waste.
- To all who opposed it.

544
01:00:16,003 --> 01:00:18,477
The leader of the invaders

545
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:20,976
was a being called Darkseid.

546
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,477
A name cursed and feared

547
01:00:23,501 --> 01:00:25,976
in every universe.

548
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,977
Darkseid was met in battle

549
01:00:28,001 --> 01:00:29,976
by Earth's defenders.

550
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,976
The old gods, men...

551
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,477
Atlanteans before

552
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:36,000
their descent into the sea...

553
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,477
Amazons before their betrayal

554
01:00:40,501 --> 01:00:42,976
and enslavement

555
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,976
and guardians from the stars.

556
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,977
Their histories

557
01:00:46,001 --> 01:00:46,977
had taught them

558
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:48,976
not to trust each other,

559
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,976
not to hope for an alliance.

560
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
To fight apart.

561
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,477
As Darkseid

562
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:44,976
waged war on Earth,

563
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,976
he found a secret there.

564
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,977
A power hidden

565
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:50,976
in the infinity of space.

566
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,977
He called forth mystics

567
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:53,977
who worshipped and controlled

568
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,976
three objects...

569
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,977
the Mother Boxes.

570
01:01:57,001 --> 01:01:58,976
Wait, wait, wait.

571
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,977
"Mother Boxes"?

572
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:01,477
Indestructible

573
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:02,976
living machines,

574
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,477
made from a science

575
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:05,976
so advanced,

576
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,976
it looks like sorcery.

577
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,477
To conquer, three boxes

578
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:10,976
have to synchronize

579
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,477
and join together

580
01:02:12,501 --> 01:02:13,976
into The Unity.

581
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,477
The Unity cleanses

582
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:17,000
a planet with fire,

583
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,477
transforming it into a copy

584
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:20,976
of the enemy's world.

585
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,977
All who live

586
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:24,976
become servants of Darkseid.

587
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,976
Alive but drained of life.

588
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Parademons.

589
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
-Amazons!

590
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
With me!

591
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,977
But before The Unity

592
01:03:11,001 --> 01:03:11,977
could synchronize,

593
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:13,977
- the defenders of Earth.
- Attacked.

594
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:15,977
And fought as one.

595
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:19,976
Amazons alongside Atlanteans.

596
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,977
Zeus and his son Ares

597
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:22,977
alongside the guardians

598
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:24,976
from the sky.

599
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,477
A golden Age of Heroes

600
01:03:26,501 --> 01:03:27,976
fighting together

601
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
to defend life on Earth.

602
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,477
They did what no world

603
01:05:27,501 --> 01:05:28,976
had ever done.

604
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,477
Sent the enemies

605
01:05:30,501 --> 01:05:32,000
back into the stars.

606
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,977
The three Mother Boxes

607
01:05:36,001 --> 01:05:37,976
never synchronized.

608
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,976
-The Unity never came to pass.

609
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,976
But, in their retreat,

610
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,477
the boxes were left behind

611
01:05:45,501 --> 01:05:46,976
on Earth.

612
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,977
They grew weak.

613
01:05:49,001 --> 01:05:51,000
Dogs without masters

614
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,976
falling asleep,

615
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,976
awaiting their return.

616
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,477
Fading from the view

617
01:05:58,501 --> 01:05:59,976
of the enemy,

618
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,477
anonymous

619
01:06:01,501 --> 01:06:03,000
among a trillion worlds.

620
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,477
The defenders of Earth

621
01:06:21,501 --> 01:06:22,976
made a vow.

622
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,976
Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons.

623
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,976
Each would enshrine and guard

624
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,977
- one of the three.
- Sleeping Mother Boxes.

625
01:06:31,003 --> 01:06:32,477
According to the rites

626
01:06:32,501 --> 01:06:33,976
and rituals of their culture

627
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,477
in case a box

628
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:36,976
should ever wake again

629
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,977
- to call out.
- To the planet Apokolips.

630
01:06:39,003 --> 01:06:40,976
To return and conquer

631
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,977
the only world.

632
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:45,000
Darkseid had ever lost.

633
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,477
Something woke the box

634
01:08:02,501 --> 01:08:03,976
my people guard.

635
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,977
It called out

636
01:08:05,001 --> 01:08:05,977
to the dark place...

637
01:08:06,001 --> 01:08:07,477
to one of Darkseid's

638
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:09,000
conquerors.

639
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,976
The enemy is here.

640
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,976
If he's here, where is he?

641
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,977
- He'll be searching.
- For the other two boxes.

642
01:08:16,003 --> 01:08:17,477
Hiding until he has all three.

643
01:08:17,501 --> 01:08:18,976
Until he's ready.

644
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,477
Then we have to be ready.

645
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:23,976
You, me, the others.

646
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,477
They said the Age of Heroes

647
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:26,976
would never come again.

648
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,976
No, it will.

649
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It has to.

650
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,977
The others.

651
01:08:34,001 --> 01:08:36,000
Where are they?

652
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,977
Am I late?

653
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:00,977
- No, I'm so late.
- I'm very late.

654
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,976
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.

655
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,976
-Oh. No.

656
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,976
Okay, bye. Okay.

657
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,976
-I'm so sorry.

658
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I'm late.

659
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:17,977
- Are you, uh...
- I'm...

660
01:09:18,003 --> 01:09:19,979
- I'm so sorry I'm so late.
- I didn't mean to be so late.

661
01:09:20,003 --> 01:09:21,977
- I'm me and I'm here.
- And I'm so sorry I'm late.

662
01:09:22,001 --> 01:09:23,441
- Essentially,
- the bus didn't come,

663
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,976
Then the bus did come,

664
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:25,977
- but then there was.
- This old woman.

665
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:26,977
Counting change for the fare,

666
01:09:27,001 --> 01:09:28,977
- like, nickel, penny,
- nickel, penny.

667
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:29,977
- Like, jeez Louise,
- let this woman on the bus.

668
01:09:30,003 --> 01:09:31,976
She's 107 years old,

669
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:32,977
- these are some of her.
- Last few moments of life.

670
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:34,976
Resume.

671
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Resume.

672
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Come on.

673
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:44,976
Come on.

674
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:45,977
From the French, of course.

675
01:09:46,001 --> 01:09:47,977
"Resume," I believe,

676
01:09:48,001 --> 01:09:50,000
is a past participle of...

677
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,976
Uh, wow. That's no good.

678
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,840
- It's like, what lives.
- In my pocket, right?

679
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,977
- "Paper monster hungry."
- Uh...

680
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,477
Come on. Supposed to be

681
01:10:10,501 --> 01:10:12,000
friends now.

682
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
-Yes.

683
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,477
Central City College,

684
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:30,976
I'm a criminal justice major.

685
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:31,977
You said you had experience

686
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:34,000

See, in times of crisis,

706
01:13:17,501 --> 01:13:18,976
for dog work,

707
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,976
I always bring a meat snack.

708
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:21,977
'Cause it makes them

709
01:13:22,001 --> 01:13:22,977
feel calm.

710
01:13:23,001 --> 01:13:24,976
- 'Cause you never know.
- What's going to happen - In this city.

711
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:25,977
I mean, oh, my gosh.

712
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:29,000
Right? I start on Monday?

713
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,477
You have been

714
01:14:08,501 --> 01:14:10,000
near a Mother Box.

715
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,976
The scent is on you.

716
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:14,977
Where is it?

717
01:14:15,001 --> 01:14:16,977
No son or daughter of Atlantis

718
01:14:17,001 --> 01:14:19,000
will ever tell you.

719
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,977
- Our people have guarded.
- The Mother Box.

720
01:14:36,001 --> 01:14:37,001
For thousands of years.

721
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,477
I will never betray

722
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:46,000
my own people.

723
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
You already have.

724
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,477
This was taken in

725
01:16:01,501 --> 01:16:02,976
the deepest trench on Earth.

726
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,976
He must be an Atlantean.

727
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,977
A water-breather.

728
01:16:06,001 --> 01:16:07,977
- He was breathing air.
- When I talked to him.

729
01:16:08,003 --> 01:16:09,976
Mixed-blood, then.

730
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,976
He said he'll fight with us?

731
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
More or less.

732
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,976
More more or more less?

733
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:17,977
Probably more less.

734
01:16:18,001 --> 01:16:19,477
-He said no?

735
01:16:19,501 --> 01:16:20,976
-He said no.

736
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:21,977
Atlanteans

737
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:22,977
can be tricky.

738
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:24,477
My people went to war

739
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:26,000
with them once.

740
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,976
I'm not sure we can trust him.

741
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,977
- Diana,
- if we're gonna do this,

742
01:16:31,001 --> 01:16:31,976
You're gonna need to be open

743
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:32,977
- to more things.
- That we didn't...

744
01:16:33,001 --> 01:16:33,977
You know...

745
01:16:34,001 --> 01:16:35,977
- I'm sorry. That's okay.
- Sorry. My fault.

746
01:16:36,001 --> 01:16:36,976
Don't worry about it.

747
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
- Let's...
- It happens.

748
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:39,977
So...

749
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:41,977
- This is the - third person.

750
01:16:42,003 --> 01:16:43,977
- Disappears for 1/30
- of a second here.

751
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:45,977
One frame of video, see?

752
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:48,976
Barry Allen. Central City.

753
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:49,977
Go to him.

754
01:16:50,001 --> 01:16:51,976
I'll work on number four.

755
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,477
Organic and biomechatronic

756
01:16:53,501 --> 01:16:55,000
body parts.

757
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
He's a cyborg.

758
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:19,977
Ready!

759
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:21,001
Break!

760
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,976
Three...

761
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
eighty...

762
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
set... go!

763
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,477
Your son may be captain

764
01:17:56,501 --> 01:17:57,976
of the football team

765
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,477
and a certified genius,

766
01:17:59,501 --> 01:18:00,976
Mrs. Stone...

767
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Dr. Stone.

768
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,979
- But that doesn't mean.
- He can hack into our system.

769
01:18:08,003 --> 01:18:10,000
To change his friend's grades.

770
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,477
Sarah's family

771
01:18:12,501 --> 01:18:14,000
lost their house this year.

772
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:15,977
How could that child

773
01:18:16,001 --> 01:18:17,001
pass her classes?

774
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,977
Victor helped her

775
01:18:20,001 --> 01:18:21,976
'cause he's got a good heart.

776
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
What did you do to help her?

777
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,477
-Your father...

778
01:19:49,501 --> 01:19:51,000
-Mom, Mom, don't.

779
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,976
-He got held up at the lab.

780
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Okay. He always does.

781
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,976
He wanted to be here.

782
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
You always say that.

783
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:05,977
- Ma, you gotta stop.
- Making excuses for him.

784
01:20:06,003 --> 01:20:07,477
You're just as busy as he is,

785
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:08,976
but you still make the time.

786
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,977
He just has difficulty

787
01:20:11,001 --> 01:20:12,976
showing it, but...

788
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I know he's proud of you.

789
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,976
We both are, Victor.

790
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,976
Hey, hey, hey.

791
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,977
With everything I know

792
01:20:23,001 --> 01:20:24,976
you can do today,

793
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,160
- I can't wait to see.
- What you're gonna be tomorrow.

794
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,977
Dr. Stone,

795
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:35,001
I'm sorry,

796
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
your wife didn't survive.

797
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,977
- I'm afraid.
- Your son won't either.

798
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I won't let you die.

799
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I won't allow it.

800
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I won't allow it.

801
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Victor.

802
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,977
Victor, you're not

803
01:21:17,001 --> 01:21:18,976
stuck in here.

804
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,477
You still have a life

805
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:21,976
ahead of you.

806
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,977
Your mother would have

807
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:26,000
wanted you to live that life.

808
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
If you were there,

809
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Mom would still be alive.

810
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
All right, look,

811
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,477
you don't have to give me

812
01:21:40,501 --> 01:21:41,976
a second chance,

813
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
but give yourself one.

814
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,977
If you can't stand

815
01:21:47,001 --> 01:21:49,000
looking at me,

816
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
try listening.

817
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,976
What you can do now, Victor.

818
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,977
Your physical strength is

819
01:22:25,001 --> 01:22:26,976
just the tip of the iceberg.

820
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
The tip of the tip.

821
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:00,977
In the world

822
01:23:01,001 --> 01:23:01,977
of ones and zeroes,

823
01:23:02,001 --> 01:23:04,976
you are the absolute master.

824
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,976
No firewall can stop you.

825
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,976
No encryption can defy you.

826
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,976
We're all at your mercy, Vic.

827
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,979
- From our power grids.
- To our telecommunications,

828
01:23:15,003 --> 01:23:16,977
- Everyone's lives.
- Are controlled.

829
01:23:17,003 --> 01:23:18,977
And dominated

830
01:23:19,001 --> 01:23:20,976
by complex digital networks

831
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,977
that will bend

832
01:23:23,001 --> 01:23:25,000
without effort to your will.

833
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,976
The fate of the world

834
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,477
will literally

835
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:40,000
rest in your hands.

836
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,976
Its entire nuclear arsenal,

837
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,477
you could launch

838
01:23:51,501 --> 01:23:53,000
with a thought.

839
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,976
The world's monetary systems

840
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,120
and its complex interactions

841
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,977
- will seem as easy.
- To manipulate for you.

842
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
As a child's plaything.

843
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,977
The question...

844
01:24:47,001 --> 01:24:49,000
No, the challenge

845
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,976
won't be doing it.

846
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,976
It will be not doing.

847
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Not seeing.

848
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,977
- It is the burden.
- Of this responsibility.

849
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,477
That will define you

850
01:25:03,501 --> 01:25:05,000
and who you choose to be.

851
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Now, make a wish.

852
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,976
One more time.

853
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,976
Good job. Wave to Grandma!

854
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Hi, Grandma!

855
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
What?

856
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:48,977
Oh, my God!

857
01:26:49,001 --> 01:26:50,001
Oh, my God!

858
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:51,977
Oh, my God.

859
01:26:52,001 --> 01:26:54,000
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

860
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,976
Victor...

861
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,477
Victor, these are the words

862
01:27:04,501 --> 01:27:06,976
and deductions of a scientist.

863
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:07,977
That's how I've been

864
01:27:08,001 --> 01:27:09,001
speaking to you.

865
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,976
Now,

866
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,477
let me

867
01:27:15,501 --> 02:54:28,477
speak to you from my heart,

868
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,976
not as a scientist,

869
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
as a father.

870
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Hey.

871
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Hey, you!

872
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,477
Because you are

873
01:27:54,501 --> 01:27:55,976
holding yourself back.

874
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,976
You're going in circles, man.

875
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,977
Holding down

876
01:28:01,001 --> 01:28:01,976
three dead-end jobs,

877
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:02,977
going on four.

878
01:28:03,001 --> 01:28:04,977
- Where do you.
- Even find the time?

879
01:28:05,001 --> 01:28:05,977
I make the time.

880
01:28:06,001 --> 01:28:07,977
- I just need one more gig...
- Barry.

881
01:28:08,001 --> 01:28:08,977
- Then I'm gonna pay.
- For my own tuition.

882
01:28:09,001 --> 01:28:09,976
You can't.

883
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:10,977
- Like I always said - I would.

884
01:28:11,003 --> 01:28:12,977
- You cannot keep.
- Doing this to yourself.

885
01:28:13,001 --> 01:28:13,977
- Okay. I really don't wanna.
- Talk about this again.

886
01:28:14,003 --> 01:28:15,977
- Please, we have 10 minutes.
- And this is all to pay.

887
01:28:16,001 --> 01:28:16,977
- For a criminal justice degree,
- huh?

888
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:17,977
Yeah.

889
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:19,976
For what?

890
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,477
Huh, let's see.

891
01:28:21,501 --> 01:28:22,976
As I talk to my father,

892
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:23,977
- who's still in prison.
- For the murder.

893
01:28:24,003 --> 01:28:25,977
- Of my mother,
- which he didn't commit.

894
01:28:26,003 --> 01:28:27,979
- Yeah, how did I get interested.
- In criminal justice?

895
01:28:28,003 --> 01:28:29,976
I can't remember.

896
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:30,977
Oh, boy.

897
01:28:31,001 --> 01:28:32,977
- This path has clearly.
- Chosen me, Dad.

898
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Give me your hand, man.

899
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,477
I want you

900
01:28:42,501 --> 01:28:43,976
to listen to me, Barry.

901
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,977
I want you to listen to me,

902
01:28:46,001 --> 01:28:48,000
because I mean this.

903
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:54,977
I want you

904
01:28:55,001 --> 01:28:56,001
to give all that up.

905
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,477
And I want you to stop

906
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:02,000
coming to see me.

907
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I am a drag on your life.

908
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:13,977
Okay. Um...

909
01:29:14,001 --> 01:29:15,977
Please don't ever

910
01:29:16,001 --> 01:29:17,976
say that to me again.

911
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:18,977
Please.

912
01:29:19,001 --> 01:29:20,977
- Hey, you know what.
- Criminal justice.

913
01:29:21,003 --> 01:29:22,976
Would be for me?

914
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,000
My son not wasting his life.

915
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,977
- You can be.
- Whatever you wanna be.

916
01:29:31,001 --> 01:29:32,001
You're brilliant, man.

917
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Absolute best of the best.

918
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,477
I can't sit here and watch you

919
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:43,976
run in place in Central City

920
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,976
for some old dude

921
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,976
who's not going anywhere.

922
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,977
- Dad, that's not true.
- It's time.

923
01:29:51,001 --> 01:29:51,977
That's not true.

924
01:29:52,001 --> 01:29:53,976
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

925
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,560
- I want you.
- To make your own future.

926
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,976
- You're living in the past.
- Make your own future.

927
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:58,977
Open gate.

928
01:29:59,001 --> 01:30:01,000
Great.

929
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,400
- "You're living in the past.
- Make your own future, Barry."

930
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
- Clear.
- Close the gate.

931
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,976
Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

932
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,976
You said that like it explains

933
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,977
- why there's a total stranger.
- In my place.

934
01:31:08,003 --> 01:31:09,477
Sitting in the dark,

935
01:31:09,501 --> 01:31:11,000
in my second favorite chair.

936
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Tell me about this.

937
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,477
This is a person

938
01:31:20,501 --> 01:31:21,976
who looks exactly like me,

939
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
but who is definitely not me.

940
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,976
Somebody... I don't know.

941
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,976
Hippie, long hair.

942
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Very attractive Jewish boy.

943
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,477
Who drinks milk,

944
01:31:35,501 --> 01:31:36,976
I don't drink milk.

945
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,976
I know you have abilities.

946
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:39,977
I just don't know

947
01:31:40,001 --> 01:31:40,976
what they are.

948
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:41,977
My special skills

949
01:31:42,001 --> 01:31:44,976
include viola, web design,

950
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,477
fluent in sign language,

951
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:47,976
gorilla sign language.

952
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,977
Silica-based

953
01:31:50,001 --> 01:31:51,976
sand quartz fabric.

954
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:52,977
Abrasion resistant,

955
01:31:53,001 --> 01:31:53,977
heat resistant.

956
01:31:54,001 --> 01:31:55,977
- Uh, yeah, I do.
- Competitive ice dancing.

957
01:31:56,003 --> 01:31:57,977
- It's what they use.
- On the space shuttle.

958
01:31:58,003 --> 01:31:59,977
- To prevent it from.
- Burning up on re-entry.

959
01:32:00,003 --> 01:32:01,477
I do very competitive

960
01:32:01,501 --> 01:32:03,000
ice dancing.

961
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,977
- Look, man.
- I don't know who you are,

962
01:32:06,003 --> 01:32:07,977
- But whoever.
- You're looking for,

963
01:32:08,001 --> 01:32:09,001
It's not me.

964
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,976
You're the Batman?

965
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,976
So, you're fast.

966
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,680
- That feels.
- Like an oversimplification.

967
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:58,977
I'm putting together a team.

968
01:32:59,001 --> 01:33:01,976
People with special abilities.

969
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:02,977
- You see,
- I believe enemies are coming.

970
01:33:03,003 --> 01:33:06,000
Stop right there. I'm in.

971
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:07,976
You are?

972
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:08,977
Just like that?

973
01:33:09,001 --> 01:33:11,000
Yeah.

974
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,976
I need friends.

975
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,976
Great. Great.

976
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,976
Can I keep this?

977
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,977
- It's like this layer.
- Of dimensional reality,

978
01:33:23,001 --> 01:33:24,681
- And it seems.
- To manipulate space-time.

979
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:25,977
I call it the Speed Force.

980
01:33:26,001 --> 01:33:27,979
- Causes me to burn a tremendous.
- Amount of calories.

981
01:33:28,003 --> 01:33:29,477
So I am just a black hole

982
01:33:29,501 --> 01:33:30,976
of snacks.

983
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,976
I am a snack hole.

984
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,477
How many people are

985
01:33:34,501 --> 01:33:35,976
on this special fight team?

986
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,977
- Three, including you.
- Three?

987
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,976
Against what?

988
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,976
I'll tell you on the plane.

989
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,976
Plane?

990
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:45,977
What are your

991
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:46,977
superpowers again?

992
01:33:47,001 --> 01:33:49,000
I'm rich.

993
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,977
Oh, Miss Prince,

994
01:34:13,001 --> 01:34:13,977
let me do that.

995
01:34:14,001 --> 01:34:15,477
No, that's okay.

996
01:34:15,501 --> 01:34:16,976
I can do it myself.

997
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:17,977
Would you like

998
01:34:18,001 --> 01:34:18,976
to have some?

999
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Uh, no, thank you.

1000
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,976
If you put the water in first.

1001
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,477
Of course.

1002
01:34:25,501 --> 01:34:27,000
-So we don't scald the tea.

1003
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:30,977
-Yes.

1004
01:34:31,001 --> 01:34:31,977
-Great.

1005
01:34:32,001 --> 01:34:33,977
- No, that's probably.
- Enough tea.

1006
01:34:34,003 --> 01:34:35,976
All right.

1007
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,977
- Are you sure you don't.
- Wanna have some?

1008
01:34:38,003 --> 01:34:39,977
I won't, thank you.

1009
01:34:40,001 --> 01:34:41,976
And then leave it to mash.

1010
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,477
I will.

1011
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:44,976
I will, definitely will.

1012
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,976
Uh... What are you working on?

1013
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:48,977
It's a gauntlet

1014
01:34:49,001 --> 01:34:50,977
lined with specialized

1015
01:34:51,001 --> 01:34:52,976
polymer solar cells.

1016
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,477
-Wow.

1017
01:34:54,501 --> 01:34:55,976
-Here, let me show you.

1018
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,477
We borrowed this from

1019
01:34:57,501 --> 01:34:59,000
the Kryptonian scout ship.

1020
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,977
Oh, maybe you should, uh...

1021
01:35:02,001 --> 01:35:03,977
- a fraction.
- Thank you, thank you.

1022
01:35:04,001 --> 01:35:05,001
Of course.

1023
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,976
Ah.

1024
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,477
Ah, now,

1025
01:35:13,501 --> 01:35:14,976
let's see how that did.

1026
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,976
-Ha! Yes.

1027
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,976
Not to be sneezed at.

1028
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,477
A gauntlet that captures

1029
01:35:20,501 --> 01:35:21,976
and dissipates energy.

1030
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:22,977
It's Master Wayne's idea.

1031
01:35:23,001 --> 01:35:24,477
Maybe you should work

1032
01:35:24,501 --> 01:35:25,976
on a lasso, too?

1033
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,477
-In black, of course.

1034
01:35:27,501 --> 01:35:29,000
-Oh.

1035
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
-All right. Victor Stone.

1036
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,976
Something is not working.

1037
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Mmm.

1038
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,477
Looks like you have a date,

1039
01:36:09,501 --> 01:36:11,000
Miss Prince.

1040
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,477
Why are you looking

1041
01:37:09,501 --> 01:37:10,976
for me, Diana?

1042
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
You know who I am.

1043
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,977
- I know more than you.
- Can possibly imagine.

1044
01:37:15,003 --> 01:37:16,477
Then maybe you already know

1045
01:37:16,501 --> 01:37:17,976
I need your help.

1046
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
The world does.

1047
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Fuck the world.

1048
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,477
You've obviously

1049
01:37:25,501 --> 01:37:27,000
been through a great deal.

1050
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,976
I can't begin to imagine what.

1051
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,977
But whatever happened to you,

1052
01:37:33,001 --> 01:37:34,976
you have gifts now.

1053
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:35,977
Gifts?

1054
01:37:36,001 --> 01:37:37,477
What part of this

1055
01:37:37,501 --> 01:37:38,976
looks like a gift to you?

1056
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,976
We need you, Victor.

1057
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:41,977
And maybe you need us.

1058
01:37:42,001 --> 01:37:44,000
I don't need anyone.

1059
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:46,977
Not anymore.

1060
01:37:47,001 --> 01:37:48,477
I told myself the same

1061
01:37:48,501 --> 01:37:50,000
for a long time.

1062
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I lost someone I loved once.

1063
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,477
I shut myself off

1064
01:38:04,501 --> 01:38:07,000
from everyone.

1065
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,477
But I had to learn

1066
01:38:10,501 --> 01:38:12,000
to open back up again.

1067
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,977
The truth is,

1068
01:38:16,001 --> 01:38:17,976
I'm still working on it.

1069
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,976
And if you asked to meet me...

1070
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
you're working on it, too.

1071
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,977
- You were right.
- About the metal sample.

1072
01:39:38,003 --> 01:39:39,976
From the Superman ship.

1073
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,977
When we bombard it with X-rays

1074
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:43,976
from the electron-laser,

1075
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
look what happens.

1076
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,976
3.5 million kelvin.

1077
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,477
The inner core of the metal

1078
01:39:57,501 --> 01:39:58,976
becomes superheated.

1079
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Hot, dense matter.

1080
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,477
You're looking at

1081
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:07,976
the hottest thing on Earth.

1082
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:08,977
Exact words I said

1083
01:40:09,001 --> 01:40:09,977
to my prom date.

1084
01:40:10,001 --> 01:40:11,976
She dumped me anyway.

1085
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Yeah.

1086
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,976
Hey, Doc,

1087
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:19,977
- do you think.
- Batman is connected.

1088
01:40:20,003 --> 01:40:21,477
To the object

1089
01:40:21,501 --> 01:40:23,000
the CID is looking for?

1090
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

1091
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
No...

1092
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I don't.

1093
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Oh, Victor.

1094
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
All right! Let's go!

1095
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:29,976
Commissioner Gordon?

1096
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Come on!

1097
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:32,976
Your messages.

1098
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Hey, hey!

1099
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,477
Don't have to see the sky

1100
01:41:38,501 --> 01:41:39,976
to know it's a full moon.

1101
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,477
Half of Gotham's

1102
01:41:41,501 --> 03:23:21,477
reality-challenged

1103
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,976
community showed up.

1104
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,977
- Say they saw flying monsters.
- By the harbor.

1105
01:41:45,003 --> 01:41:46,977
- You were right, Ma.
- Police Academy.

1106
01:41:47,003 --> 01:41:48,977
- What's wrong.
- With dental school?

1107
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,477
"Attacked by

1108
01:41:53,501 --> 01:41:54,976
a flying vampire."

1109
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,477
"Looked like a giant bat

1110
01:41:56,501 --> 01:41:57,976
with huge fangs."

1111
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,976
On a possibly related note,

1112
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,477
sketch of the suspect

1113
01:42:01,501 --> 01:42:02,976
in the abductions

1114
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:03,977
at the lab across the harbor.

1115
01:42:04,001 --> 01:42:05,977
-Looks like...

1116
01:42:06,001 --> 03:24:10,076
-I know what it looks like,

1117
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,976
Crispus.

1118
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,979
- Come on, you think he fights.
- Criminals for 20 years here.

1119
01:42:10,003 --> 01:42:11,477
And then he goes to Metropolis

1120
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:13,000
and kidnaps eight people?

1121
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,976
I'll talk to him tonight.

1122
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:16,977
How, Jim?

1123
01:42:17,001 --> 01:42:19,000
How do you think?

1124
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Silas?

1125
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:39,976
Hey, hey.

1126
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Hey, hey!

1127
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:46,977
Oh, my goodness.

1128
01:42:47,001 --> 01:42:47,977
Where's the cyborg?

1129
01:42:48,001 --> 01:42:49,976
His name is Victor.

1130
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
We met, spoke.

1131
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,976
Give him time.

1132
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,976
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

1133
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,977
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana.

1134
01:43:00,001 --> 01:43:01,976
That's not right. Great.

1135
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,477
So, this is us.

1136
01:43:03,501 --> 01:43:04,976
Yeah, this is us.

1137
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:05,977
Oh!

1138
01:43:06,001 --> 01:43:07,477
Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal.

1139
01:43:07,501 --> 01:43:08,976
That's your...

1140
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:09,977
Oh, sorry.

1141
01:43:10,001 --> 01:43:10,977
That's your signal.

1142
01:43:11,001 --> 01:43:12,976
That means we have to go now.

1143
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,477
-Yeah, that's what that means.

1144
01:43:14,501 --> 01:43:16,000
It's so cool.

1145
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:14,977
- Commander Mera,
- I told the king.

1146
01:44:15,003 --> 01:44:16,977
- The perimeter guards.
- Were taken.

1147
01:44:17,003 --> 01:44:18,976
He won't send reinforcements.

1148
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,477
He says all the reserves are

1149
01:44:20,501 --> 01:44:21,976
needed in the rebel regions.

1150
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,977
He's as shortsighted

1151
01:44:24,001 --> 01:44:25,976
as he is cruel.

1152
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,977
- All right, take what men.
- We have left.

1153
01:44:28,003 --> 01:44:29,977
- And form a phalanx.
- Around the Mother Box.

1154
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,976
You can't escape.

1155
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,000
I'm not trying to.

1156
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:17,977
Vulko told me

1157
01:48:18,001 --> 01:48:18,977
you would come.

1158
01:48:19,001 --> 01:48:20,477
The firstborn

1159
01:48:20,501 --> 01:48:22,000
of beloved Queen Atlanna.

1160
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Wait.

1161
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Please.

1162
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I knew her.

1163
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,976
Well, that makes one of us.

1164
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,120
My parents died in the wars.

1165
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,976
She took me in.

1166
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,976
What a saint.

1167
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,977
- You dare speak.
- Of Queen Atlanna that way?

1168
01:48:48,003 --> 01:48:49,477
Your queen left me

1169
01:48:49,501 --> 01:48:50,976
on my father's doorstep

1170
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,520
- and never gave me.
- Another thought.

1171
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,477
Your mother left you

1172
01:48:54,501 --> 01:48:55,976
to save your life.

1173
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,477
You cannot imagine

1174
01:48:57,501 --> 01:48:59,000
how it hurt her.

1175
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
What it cost her.

1176
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,477
But you're not

1177
01:49:04,501 --> 01:49:06,000
a defenseless child now.

1178
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,680
- It would have been.
- Her responsibility.

1179
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,477
To follow that monster

1180
01:49:11,501 --> 01:49:12,976
to the surface and stop him.

1181
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Now,

1182
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,000
it's yours.

1183
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Yes.

1184
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:46,977
Steppenwolf,

1185
01:50:47,001 --> 01:50:48,976
tell me what you've learned.

1186
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,477
Two boxes

1187
01:50:50,501 --> 01:50:51,976
found and awake.

1188
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,477
With the combined power

1189
01:50:53,501 --> 01:50:54,976
of the two Mother Boxes,

1190
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,477
I've been able to finish

1191
01:50:56,501 --> 01:50:58,000
the stronghold's defenses.

1192
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,976
Where is the third Mother Box?

1193
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,477
The parademons

1194
01:51:02,501 --> 01:51:03,976
sense its presence

1195
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:04,977
and search for the third.

1196
01:51:05,001 --> 01:51:06,976
They have taken prisoners

1197
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
who carry its scent.

1198
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:10,977
Go.

1199
01:51:11,001 --> 01:51:13,000
Interrogate the prisoners.

1200
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Find the third.

1201
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,477
They will tell me

1202
01:51:18,501 --> 01:51:20,000
what they know,

1203
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
or I will rip it from them.

1204
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,040
How many of you are there?

1205
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Not enough.

1206
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,477
Dozens of witnesses

1207
01:52:13,501 --> 01:52:14,976
all over Gotham.

1208
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:15,977
- Description.
- Matches the suspect.

1209
01:52:16,003 --> 01:52:17,976
In the Metropolis abductions.

1210
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Parademons.

1211
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:20,977
Okay.

1212
01:52:21,001 --> 01:52:22,477
The demons must have caught

1213
01:52:22,501 --> 01:52:23,976
the scent of a Mother Box.

1214
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:24,977
At the lab.

1215
01:52:25,001 --> 01:52:26,979
- They carried people away.
- To find out what they know.

1216
01:52:27,003 --> 01:52:28,977
- So the eight.
- May still be alive.

1217
01:52:29,001 --> 01:52:29,976
Nine.

1218
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Oh.

1219
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:32,977
The head of STARLABS

1220
01:52:33,001 --> 01:52:34,001
was taken tonight.

1221
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,477
Wow, okay.

1222
01:52:40,501 --> 01:52:41,976
So, another scientist.

1223
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
So, how do we find him?

1224
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:44,977
There must be a nest nearby.

1225
01:52:45,001 --> 01:52:47,477
I plotted all the sightings

1226
01:52:47,501 --> 01:52:49,976
in Metropolis, Gotham.

1227
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,977
- No discernable pattern.
- I can see.

1228
01:52:52,001 --> 01:52:52,977
- The lines on the map.
- Don't converge.

1229
01:52:53,003 --> 01:52:54,976
On land.

1230
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:55,977
- These lead back.
- To Stryker's Island,

1231
01:52:56,003 --> 01:52:57,976
Between the two cities.

1232
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:58,976
These are air vents.

1233
01:52:59,000 --> 01:52:59,977
- They all lead.
- Down to the tunnel.

1234
01:53:00,003 --> 01:53:01,477
To a Metropolis project

1235
01:53:01,501 --> 01:53:02,976
that was abandoned in '29.

1236
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,976
The nest could be there.

1237
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,977
- Uh,
- is he coming with us now,

1238
01:53:07,003 --> 01:53:08,977
- Because we're not all.
- Gonna fit in your car.

1239
01:53:09,003 --> 01:53:11,000
I have something bigger.

1240
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,976
Do you really think that...

1241
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,477
Oh, wow, they just...

1242
01:53:16,501 --> 01:53:18,000
They really just vanish, huh?

1243
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Oh. That's rude.

1244
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,976
We're close.

1245
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
The scent of the enemy.

1246
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:05,977
Of absence.

1247
01:54:06,001 --> 01:54:08,000
Darkness.

1248
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:09,976
Death.

1249
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:10,976
Where are we, Alfred?

1250
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Stryker's Island.

1251
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,976
You should be directly under

1252
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:15,977
the venting tower

1253
01:54:16,001 --> 01:54:17,001
for the tunnel.

1254
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:18,977
Now look to your left,

1255
01:54:19,001 --> 01:54:20,977
- you'll see a staircase.
- To the machine room.

1256
01:54:21,003 --> 01:54:22,477
Thermal scan shows

1257
01:54:22,501 --> 01:54:23,976
a cluster of people there.

1258
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:24,977
That's it.

1259
01:54:25,001 --> 01:54:27,000
Let's go.

1260
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,477
Right.

1261
01:54:41,501 --> 01:54:43,000
Is there... Is there a plan?

1262
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:45,977
Either of you?

1263
01:54:46,001 --> 01:54:47,976
Don't engage alone.

1264
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
We do this together.

1265
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
I heard about you.

1266
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,080
Didn't think you were real.

1267
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,040
I'm real when it's useful.

1268
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,976
I grow tired of your silence.

1269
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,977
- Now tell me,
- where is the Mother Box?

1270
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,976
Please. We have families.

1271
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,976
Then you have weakness.

1272
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:31,977
Steppenwolf.

1273
01:55:32,001 --> 01:55:34,477
Okay, I'm guessing

1274
01:55:34,501 --> 01:55:36,976
that's the bad guy.

1275
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:37,977
Good guess.

1276
01:55:38,001 --> 01:55:39,977
I'm really, really missing

1277
01:55:40,001 --> 01:55:41,976
Superman right now.

1278
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,976
Circle to the other side.

1279
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,477
We'll surround them

1280
01:55:45,501 --> 01:55:47,000
and surprise him.

1281
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:51,977
You have been

1282
01:55:52,001 --> 01:55:52,977
near a Mother Box.

1283
01:55:53,001 --> 01:55:54,976
The scent is on you.

1284
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:55,977
- I don't know.
- What you're talking about.

1285
01:55:56,003 --> 01:55:57,977
- Where is it?
- Leave him alone!

1286
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
He... He doesn't know.

1287
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Wait, please, please!

1288
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,477
You carry

1289
01:56:13,501 --> 01:56:14,976
the scent, too. But stronger.

1290
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,976
I will die before I tell you.

1291
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,976
You'll die if you don't.

1292
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
No!

1293
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:30,976
Victor.

1294
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Kill them both.

1295
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,976
Ah, Amazon.

1296
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,976
But not like your sisters.

1297
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Stronger.

1298
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Amazon.

1299
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Hold!

1300
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
This one will be mine.

1301
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
I belong to no one.

1302
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Guys, this is not together.

1303
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,977
- Help get those people.
- Out of here.

1304
01:57:51,003 --> 01:57:52,977
- I'll make sure these things.
- Follow me.

1305
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Everybody, move!

1306
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
A little quicker.

1307
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:17,977
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

1308
01:58:18,003 --> 01:58:21,000
I've got this. Keep moving.

1309
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,000
This way.

1310
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:00,977
The energy

1311
01:59:01,001 --> 01:59:01,977
is dissipating.

1312
01:59:02,001 --> 01:59:03,976
My gauntlet worked!

1313
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,477
Celebrate later, Alfred.

1314
01:59:05,501 --> 01:59:06,976
I need the Nightcrawler.

1315
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,976
Thought you'd never ask.

1316
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,977
- Crawler's on the way.
- Initiating remote mode.

1317
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Thank you, Alfred.

1318
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Don't mention it.

1319
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
No!

1320
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Whew.

1321
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:16,977
- They're safe.
- Get back to the tunnel.

1322
02:00:17,003 --> 02:00:18,977
Tunnel. Right.

1323
02:00:19,001 --> 02:00:21,000
Aliens, bad guy, sword lady.

1324
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
My turn.

1325
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:56,977
- Catastrophic failure.
- Of all systems.

1326
02:01:57,003 --> 02:01:58,477
Are you all right,

1327
02:01:58,501 --> 02:01:59,976
Master Wayne?

1328
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Are you all right?

1329
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,477
You have the blood

1330
02:02:13,501 --> 02:02:15,000
of the old gods in you.

1331
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:30,977
You okay?

1332
02:02:31,001 --> 02:02:32,976
Mm.

1333
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Wasn't sure you'd come.

1334
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
You're my father.

1335
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Go.

1336
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
No!

1337
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,477
Relax, Alfred.

1338
02:03:42,501 --> 02:03:44,000
I'll take it from here.

1339
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Uh, do I know you?

1340
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,160
What are we under, right now?

1341
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Gotham Harbor.

1342
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Who is that?

1343
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Come on.

1344
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Diana, get on!

1345
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
What is it?

1346
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Show me.

1347
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,976
It is here.

1348
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,000
On this world.

1349
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:05,977
Sir, you're gonna

1350
02:08:06,001 --> 02:08:06,976
be in quarantine

1351
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:07,977
for possible alien microbes.

1352
02:08:08,001 --> 02:08:09,977
- U.S. government protocols.
- Require that...

1353
02:08:10,003 --> 02:08:11,477
I know the requirements.

1354
02:08:11,501 --> 02:08:13,000
I wrote them.

1355
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,976
It called to him.

1356
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,976
The Mother Box.

1357
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:21,977
The one he already has.

1358
02:08:22,001 --> 02:08:23,477
He has two. He took

1359
02:08:23,501 --> 02:08:24,976
the Mother Box from Atlantis.

1360
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,477
All he needs now

1361
02:08:26,501 --> 02:08:27,976
is the lost Box of Men.

1362
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,200
If he doesn't already have it.

1363
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,000
He doesn't have it.

1364
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,000
I do.

1365
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:49,977
Have you finished

1366
02:08:50,001 --> 02:08:50,977
the conquest?

1367
02:08:51,001 --> 02:08:52,976
Not yet, DeSaad.

1368
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,976
Then why do you summon me?

1369
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,976
I bring news.

1370
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:58,477
Before mighty Darkseid

1371
02:08:58,501 --> 02:08:59,976
came to the throne,

1372
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,477
he searched the universe

1373
02:09:02,501 --> 02:09:04,976
for the ultimate weapon.

1374
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
The Anti-Life Equation.

1375
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:08,977
The key to

1376
02:09:09,001 --> 02:09:09,977
controlling all life

1377
02:09:10,001 --> 02:09:11,977
- and all will.
- Throughout the multiverse.

1378
02:09:12,003 --> 02:09:13,477
He found it hidden

1379
02:09:13,501 --> 04:18:25,477
on a primitive planet,

1380
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,000
but before...

1381
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,477
The story of the defiance

1382
02:09:17,501 --> 02:09:18,976
is well-known.

1383
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,977
- I have found.
- The primitive planet.

1384
02:09:21,003 --> 02:09:23,976
The world that fought back.

1385
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,976
It is Earth.

1386
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,977
- The Anti-Life Equation.
- Is carved.

1387
02:09:28,003 --> 02:09:29,977
Into the surface

1388
02:09:30,001 --> 02:09:32,000
of this very world.

1389
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:36,976
Are you certain?

1390
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:37,977
I have seen it.

1391
02:09:38,001 --> 02:09:39,977
I have looked

1392
02:09:40,001 --> 02:09:42,000
with my own eyes.

1393
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Anti-Life.

1394
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
My lord.

1395
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:31,976
Oh, Steppenwolf.

1396
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,977
My lord, I am

1397
02:10:34,001 --> 02:10:35,976
but your humble servant.

1398
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,477
Can it be true

1399
02:10:37,501 --> 02:10:38,976
that you have found it?

1400
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:42,000
I have, great one.

1401
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,976
The lost world is Earth.

1402
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,976
Anti-Life is here.

1403
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,477
If it is redemption you seek,

1404
02:10:51,501 --> 02:10:52,976
find the third box,

1405
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,477
synchronize The Unity,

1406
02:10:54,501 --> 04:21:47,477
and when this world

1407
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,000
is scorched,

1408
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,477
I will come

1409
02:10:58,501 --> 02:11:00,000
for my great prize.

1410
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,976
You will come to Earth?

1411
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,977
I have turned

1412
02:11:06,001 --> 02:11:07,976
100,000 worlds to dust

1413
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,976
looking for Anti-Life.

1414
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,477
Looking for those

1415
02:11:11,501 --> 02:11:12,976
who robbed me of my glory.

1416
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,977
I will stride

1417
02:11:15,001 --> 02:11:16,976
across their bones

1418
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:17,977
and bask in the glow

1419
02:11:18,001 --> 02:11:18,977
of Anti-Life.

1420
02:11:19,001 --> 02:11:21,976
And all of existence

1421
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:26,000
shall be mine.

1422
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:33,000
It shall be so, my master.

1423
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:38,976
So cool.

1424
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,477
From the outside,

1425
02:11:40,501 --> 04:23:19,477
it looks like this building

1426
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
was abandoned.

1427
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
It wants to fly.

1428
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,976
You talk to machines?

1429
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,477
I speak

1430
02:11:51,501 --> 02:11:52,976
to intelligence.

1431
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:53,977
- This one's saying.
- She can't fly.

1432
02:11:54,003 --> 02:11:55,976
Because of a software issue,

1433
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:56,977
but I could fix it

1434
02:11:57,001 --> 02:11:58,001
with a little time.

1435
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,477
There's a dark spot

1436
02:12:08,501 --> 02:12:09,976
in my data stream.

1437
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:10,977
I could feel

1438
02:12:11,001 --> 02:12:11,977
the other two boxes.

1439
02:12:12,001 --> 02:12:13,976
I know they're awake,

1440
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:14,977
but I can't see

1441
02:12:15,001 --> 02:12:15,977
where they are.

1442
02:12:16,001 --> 02:12:17,979
- Well, we can't attack unless.
- We know where the base is.

1443
02:12:18,003 --> 02:12:20,000
Even if we knew,

1444
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,477
I've never seen a being

1445
02:12:22,501 --> 02:12:24,000
as strong as Steppenwolf.

1446
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:26,977
Maybe one.

1447
02:12:27,001 --> 02:12:29,976
Hmm, Superman.

1448
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:30,977
- As long as.
- The third box is asleep,

1449
02:12:31,003 --> 02:12:32,477
They can't see it,

1450
02:12:32,501 --> 02:12:33,976
only sense it.

1451
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:35,979
- We need to keep moving.
- So they can't catch up.

1452
02:12:36,003 --> 02:12:37,976
No. That's just a strategy

1453
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:38,977
to lose more slowly,

1454
02:12:39,001 --> 02:12:39,977
not to win.

1455
02:12:40,001 --> 02:12:41,477
Remind me, are flamethrowers

1456
02:12:41,501 --> 02:12:42,976
not a thing?

1457
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:43,977
Why don't we just destroy it?

1458
02:12:44,001 --> 02:12:45,977
- Fire doesn't.
- Destroy the boxes.

1459
02:12:46,003 --> 02:12:47,977
- They're an unknown form.
- Of matter.

1460
02:12:48,001 --> 02:12:49,001
Oh, they love heat.

1461
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,977
- They absorb it,
- hold it in their cores.

1462
02:12:52,003 --> 02:12:53,477
Well, you know

1463
02:12:53,501 --> 02:12:54,976
a lot about these boxes.

1464
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:55,977
Makes you think.

1465
02:12:56,001 --> 02:12:57,477
Where'd you find the box,

1466
02:12:57,501 --> 02:12:58,976
Victor?

1467
02:12:59,000 --> 02:12:59,977
- Are you trying.
- To say something?

1468
02:13:00,003 --> 02:13:01,976
Oh, I'm saying it.

1469
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,477
How do we know you're not

1470
02:13:03,501 --> 02:13:05,000
working for them?

1471
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,976
It's a long story.

1472
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
You got somewhere else to be?

1473
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:18,977
The Nazis found the box

1474
02:13:19,001 --> 02:13:20,477
at the end

1475
02:13:20,501 --> 02:13:21,976
of the Second World War,

1476
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,477
buried under

1477
02:13:23,501 --> 02:13:24,976
an Italian monastery.

1478
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,979
- The Allies intercepted it.
- On its way to Hitler.

1479
02:13:27,003 --> 02:13:28,477
They brought it back

1480
02:13:28,501 --> 02:13:29,976
to the States in '44.

1481
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:34,976
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

1482
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,977
- It collected dust.
- In the Pentagon archives.

1483
02:13:37,001 --> 02:13:38,001
For 70 years

1484
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,477
till DoD began to study

1485
02:13:40,501 --> 02:13:42,000
the Superman ship.

1486
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,477
A researcher at STARLABS

1487
02:13:44,501 --> 02:13:45,976
made a connection

1488
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
between the ship...

1489
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
and 6-1-9-8-2.

1490
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:52,477
He understood they were

1491
02:13:52,501 --> 02:13:53,976
both alien technologies.

1492
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,976
Different civilizations,

1493
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:59,976
similar properties.

1494
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,477
And though the box had slept

1495
02:14:01,501 --> 02:14:02,976
for thousands of years,

1496
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:04,977
the researcher formulated

1497
02:14:05,001 --> 02:14:06,976
a theory on how to awaken it.

1498
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
And so did.

1499
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Then...

1500
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,477
I had an accident

1501
02:14:15,501 --> 02:14:16,976
that should've killed me.

1502
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,477
But in an act of desperation

1503
02:14:18,501 --> 02:14:19,976
or madness,

1504
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,477
the researcher harnessed

1505
02:14:21,501 --> 02:14:23,000
the power of the Mother Box.

1506
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:39,977
He unleashed

1507
02:14:40,001 --> 02:14:40,977
an alien technology

1508
02:14:41,001 --> 02:14:43,976
he didn't fully understand.

1509
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,477
He used that power

1510
02:14:45,501 --> 02:14:47,000
to keep me alive.

1511
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,976
Alive...

1512
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
but turned into this.

1513
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
The box went back to sleep

1514
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
and he never returned it.

1515
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,477
That researcher

1516
02:15:05,501 --> 02:15:07,000
was Silas Stone.

1517
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
My father.

1518
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,976
Wait,

1519
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,477
your father saved your life

1520
02:15:16,501 --> 02:15:17,976
with one of these things?

1521
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:19,477
Aren't they

1522
02:15:19,501 --> 02:15:20,976
psycho murder machines?

1523
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,976
They're change machines.

1524
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:24,477
The boxes don't think in terms

1525
02:15:24,501 --> 02:15:26,000
of healing or killing,

1526
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,976
alive or dead.

1527
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,979
- They rearrange matter.
- At the will of their masters,

1528
02:15:31,003 --> 02:15:32,976
Regenerate, reinstate.

1529
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:33,977
Reinstate?

1530
02:15:34,001 --> 02:15:35,976
A box has the power

1531
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,977
- to reinstate anterior.
- Particle relationships.

1532
02:15:38,003 --> 02:15:39,977
- So, you mean in the way.
- That particles of matter.

1533
02:15:40,001 --> 02:15:40,977
Can't be created or destroyed,

1534
02:15:41,001 --> 02:15:42,977
- their relations.
- Just transform.

1535
02:15:43,003 --> 02:15:44,477
Burn down a house,

1536
02:15:44,501 --> 02:15:45,976
the particles still exist.

1537
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,477
Particles of house

1538
02:15:47,501 --> 02:15:48,976
become particles of smoke.

1539
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:50,977
Anybody with a match

1540
02:15:51,001 --> 02:15:53,000
can turn a house to smoke.

1541
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,976
But a Mother Box...

1542
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:57,977
turns smoke

1543
02:15:58,001 --> 02:15:59,001
back into a house.

1544
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,477
I know we're all thinking

1545
02:16:06,501 --> 02:16:08,000
the same thing right now.

1546
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,477
Who's gonna say it?

1547
02:16:10,501 --> 02:16:12,000
I'm not gonna say it.

1548
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Who is it?

1549
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Martha.

1550
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Hi.

1551
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Hi.

1552
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,976
I went to the Daily Planet

1553
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:03,977
to finally pick up.

1554
02:17:04,001 --> 02:17:06,000
Clark's things.

1555
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,477
I don't know why,

1556
02:17:08,501 --> 02:17:10,000
nowhere to put them now.

1557
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
I lost the farm.

1558
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,477
I'd been behind on

1559
02:17:17,501 --> 02:17:19,000
the payments for a while.

1560
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:20,977
Truth is, the house is too big

1561
02:17:21,001 --> 02:17:22,477
for me to live in

1562
02:17:22,501 --> 02:17:23,976
by myself anyway.

1563
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,477
Well, you know you're welcome

1564
02:17:25,501 --> 02:17:26,976
to stay here any time

1565
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
for as long as you need.

1566
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,477
Thank you, Lois.

1567
02:17:31,501 --> 02:17:33,000
That's very kind.

1568
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,477
But I've found a little place

1569
02:17:35,501 --> 02:17:36,976
that suits me just fine,

1570
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,976
right by the diner.

1571
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
I'm not here for help.

1572
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:43,976
I'm here because

1573
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,477
when I saw Mr. Perry,

1574
02:17:45,501 --> 02:17:47,000
he told me that

1575
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,477
you haven't been to work

1576
02:17:49,501 --> 02:17:51,000
since Clark died.

1577
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
I can't.

1578
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,000
The whole world is mourning.

1579
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,976
Grieving over a symbol.

1580
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,977
Everywhere I go, everywhere

1581
02:18:13,001 --> 02:18:15,000
I look, I see that "S."

1582
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,976
I hear what people say.

1583
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
They talk like they knew him.

1584
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
But they didn't know Clark.

1585
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:26,976
And I can't stop them

1586
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,477
and look at them and tell them

1587
02:18:29,501 --> 02:18:32,000
how proud I am of my son.

1588
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,976
You're the only one who knows.

1589
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Who feels what I do.

1590
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,477
Burdened by a secret

1591
02:18:41,501 --> 02:18:43,000
on top of grief.

1592
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,977
I came all this way

1593
02:18:48,001 --> 02:18:49,976
because I wanted...

1594
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
because I wanted to see you.

1595
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:54,976
Tell you...

1596
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
I understand.

1597
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,976
I...

1598
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,977
will never love anybody

1599
02:19:03,001 --> 02:19:05,000
the way that I love your son.

1600
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,000
And I just miss him.

1601
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I miss him so much.

1602
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,000
So do I, sweetheart.

1603
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,477
Martha, you know if there's

1604
02:19:29,501 --> 02:19:32,000
anything you need, I'm here.

1605
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,477
There is something

1606
02:19:36,501 --> 02:19:38,000
you can do for me, honey.

1607
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Come back to the living.

1608
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,977
The world

1609
02:20:24,001 --> 02:20:26,000
needs you, too, Lois.

1610
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,976
The dead are dead.

1611
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,976
The box brought Victor back.

1612
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:33,977
Victor wasn't dead.

1613
02:20:34,001 --> 02:20:35,976
Life is either one or zero.

1614
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,477
It's to be or not to be.

1615
02:20:37,501 --> 02:20:38,976
Not both.

1616
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:40,977
- Can you operate this box,
- Victor?

1617
02:20:41,001 --> 02:20:41,977
Of course.

1618
02:20:42,001 --> 02:20:43,477
But we don't know enough

1619
02:20:43,501 --> 02:20:44,976
about Kryptonian biology.

1620
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:45,977
There's no telling

1621
02:20:46,001 --> 02:20:47,001
what's gonna happen.

1622
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:49,977
Okay, but...

1623
02:20:50,001 --> 02:20:52,477
I mean, we have to try.

1624
02:20:52,501 --> 02:20:54,976
Don't we? We have to try.

1625
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:55,977
What do we have to lose?

1626
02:20:56,001 --> 02:20:57,477
We cannot try

1627
02:20:57,501 --> 02:20:58,976
unless we activate the box.

1628
02:20:59,000 --> 02:20:59,977
As soon as it wakes up...

1629
02:21:00,001 --> 02:21:02,976
the enemy sees it, comes,

1630
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:03,977
activates The Unity.

1631
02:21:04,001 --> 02:21:04,977
The end.

1632
02:21:05,001 --> 02:21:06,477
So, what we have to lose

1633
02:21:06,501 --> 02:21:07,976
is the entire planet

1634
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:08,977
to a bunch

1635
02:21:09,001 --> 04:42:17,076
of genocidal aliens.

1636
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,976
That's good to know.

1637
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,976
Even if Superman could return,

1638
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:14,977
- who's to say.
- That he could defeat them?

1639
02:21:15,003 --> 02:21:16,976
The Mother Box did.

1640
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:18,977
- Victor's father.
- Activated a Mother Box.

1641
02:21:19,003 --> 02:21:20,477
More than a year ago

1642
02:21:20,501 --> 02:21:21,976
when Superman was still alive.

1643
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:22,977
Didn't call out

1644
02:21:23,001 --> 02:21:23,977
to Steppenwolf.

1645
02:21:24,001 --> 02:21:25,977
- None of the boxes did.
- Not until...

1646
02:21:26,003 --> 02:21:27,976
Not until Superman died.

1647
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,976
Not until Superman died.

1648
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:31,977
It's like they were

1649
02:21:32,001 --> 02:21:32,977
afraid of him?

1650
02:21:33,001 --> 02:21:34,477
Yes,

1651
02:21:34,501 --> 02:21:36,000
they were afraid of him.

1652
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
This is the only way.

1653
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,977
There are six, not five.

1654
02:21:44,001 --> 02:21:46,000
There is no us without him.

1655
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:02,977
Cross this one off

1656
02:22:03,001 --> 02:22:03,977
the bucket list.

1657
02:22:04,001 --> 02:22:05,977
Exhume Superman

1658
02:22:06,001 --> 02:22:08,000
from the grave. Check.

1659
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,477
You know we could do this

1660
02:22:11,501 --> 02:22:12,976
in a nanosecond, right?

1661
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
We could.

1662
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
He was my hero.

1663
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:28,000
All right.

1664
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,977
An Amazon

1665
02:22:33,001 --> 02:22:34,976
working with an Atlantean.

1666
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Half-Atlantean.

1667
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,477
How many thousands of years

1668
02:22:39,501 --> 02:22:40,976
since our people spoke?

1669
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:42,977
I don't know.

1670
02:22:43,001 --> 02:22:44,976
I'm not exactly close to mine.

1671
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,477
I hate Atlanteans as much

1672
02:22:46,501 --> 02:22:47,976
as you Amazons do.

1673
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Hate is useless.

1674
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Yep.

1675
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
No, thank you.

1676
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:02,977
You know, my father told me

1677
02:23:03,001 --> 02:23:04,977
- there's a saying.
- In Atlantis...

1678
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:07,977
"None are taken back

1679
02:23:08,001 --> 02:23:08,976
from the darkness.

1680
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:09,977
"Not without..."

1681
02:23:10,001 --> 02:23:11,977
- "Not without.
- Giving one up in return."

1682
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
We say the same thing.

1683
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,976
How about that?

1684
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Wonder Woman.

1685
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:24,976
What do you think, man?

1686
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,477
You think she'd ever

1687
02:23:26,501 --> 02:23:27,976
go for a younger guy?

1688
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:31,000
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

1689
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Every guy's a younger guy.

1690
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Jesus.

1691
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Oh, Christ.

1692
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
-Oh, bloody...

1693
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:47,976
Any luck?

1694
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:48,977
If by "luck" you mean

1695
02:23:49,001 --> 02:23:50,477
"chance in hell

1696
02:23:50,501 --> 02:23:51,976
we'll get it flying today,"

1697
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,976
then, no. No luck.

1698
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:56,976
It's okay.

1699
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:58,977
- It doesn't matter.
- We're just gonna take the body.

1700
02:23:59,001 --> 02:23:59,976
To the Kryptonian ship.

1701
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,560
- It's basically.
- An organic computer.

1702
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:02,977
- It can talk directly.
- To the Mother Box.

1703
02:24:03,003 --> 02:24:04,477
What? The way it talked

1704
02:24:04,501 --> 02:24:05,976
to Lex Luthor?

1705
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:06,977
Something like that.

1706
02:24:07,001 --> 02:24:08,977
Huh.

1707
02:24:09,001 --> 02:24:11,000
What could possibly go wrong?

1708
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Master Wayne...

1709
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,976
you did it!

1710
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:24,477
You put the team together

1711
02:24:24,501 --> 02:24:25,976
to fight this war.

1712
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,976
You've fulfilled your promise.

1713
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,977
But to try to do that...

1714
02:24:32,001 --> 02:24:33,976
I mean...

1715
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,477
your guilt's

1716
02:24:35,501 --> 02:24:36,976
overcome your reason.

1717
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:38,979
- Not all the king's horses.
- Nor all the king's men...

1718
02:24:39,003 --> 02:24:40,477
Alfred, for once,

1719
02:24:40,501 --> 04:49:19,477
I'm operating strictly

1720
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,976
on faith,

1721
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,976
not on reason.

1722
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:46,977
But if you start playing with

1723
02:24:47,001 --> 02:24:48,976
this little box of tricks,

1724
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,977
- I mean, it could be.
- The end of everything.

1725
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:53,477
How do you know

1726
02:24:53,501 --> 02:24:54,976
your team's strong enough?

1727
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:56,977
- If you can't bring down.
- The charging bull,

1728
02:24:57,003 --> 02:24:58,977
- Then don't wave.
- The red cape at it.

1729
02:24:59,003 --> 02:25:00,977
- You do.
- When it's this red cape.

1730
02:25:01,003 --> 02:25:03,000
This red cape charges back.

1731
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Okay.

1732
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:27,979
- You were right, Dr. Stone.
- The tests came back negative.

1733
02:25:28,003 --> 02:25:29,977
- Everyone's clear,
- including you.

1734
02:25:30,003 --> 02:25:31,477
Just to be on the safe side,

1735
02:25:31,501 --> 02:25:32,976
we swept the entire facility.

1736
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:34,977
- Well, thank you, Thomas.
- That means I'm free to go?

1737
02:25:35,001 --> 02:25:36,001
Absolutely.

1738
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:40,977
- Thanks.
- Listen up, everyone.

1739
02:25:41,003 --> 02:25:42,477
You're all clear.

1740
02:25:42,501 --> 02:25:43,976
So, gather your things.

1741
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:45,640
- If you need.
- More medical attention...

1742
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:47,477
Arthur, yes, your opinion.

1743
02:25:47,501 --> 02:25:48,976
Less preposterous. Option "A"?

1744
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:49,977
-Definitely not "A."

1745
02:25:50,001 --> 02:25:50,977
-Okay.

1746
02:25:51,001 --> 02:25:54,000
Or... "B"?

1747
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Let me see "A" again?

1748
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Right. We should get dressed.

1749
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
I'm always dressed.

1750
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:37,976
ID?

1751
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,000
ID.

1752
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Aye, aye.

1753
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,000
"Aye, aye"?

1754
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,976
Okay.

1755
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!

1756
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:21,976
Doc!

1757
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:23,400
- They let you out.
- Of quarantine.

1758
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:24,977
- Yeah, I finally got them.
- To listen to reason.

1759
02:27:25,003 --> 02:27:26,979
- Now, let's take a look and see.
- What progress we've made.

1760
02:27:27,003 --> 02:27:28,976
With the electron-laser.

1761
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
- We've made some real progress.
- Let me show you.

1762
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,976
Victor, clear this place out.

1763
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Done.

1764
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,477
Code Red.

1765
02:27:55,501 --> 02:27:56,976
Contamination breach.

1766
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:58,477
All personnel

1767
02:27:58,501 --> 02:27:59,976
evacuate immediately.

1768
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,976
Bio red five.

1769
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:04,979
- The sensor's picking up.
- A microbe of alien origin.

1770
02:28:05,003 --> 02:28:06,477
A microbe of alien origin?

1771
02:28:06,501 --> 02:28:07,976
That doesn't make any sense.

1772
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,120
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1773
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,977
- All right, people,
- shut it down. Let's go.

1774
02:28:12,001 --> 02:28:12,977
- Ryan, we just had it swept.
- We have to go, Doc.

1775
02:28:13,003 --> 02:28:14,977
- Think about it.
- It's gotta be a false alarm.

1776
02:28:15,001 --> 02:28:15,977
- Let's go, Doc.
- Think about it.

1777
02:28:16,001 --> 02:28:16,977
- Full base evacuation!
- Everyone out!

1778
02:28:17,003 --> 02:28:18,976
Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

1779
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:20,477
Remain calm and

1780
02:28:20,501 --> 02:28:22,000
proceed to the nearest exit.

1781
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Attention, all personnel.

1782
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,477
Go! Go! Everybody out!

1783
02:28:32,501 --> 02:28:33,976
Come on! Move!

1784
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:34,977
Move! Come on! Go, go!

1785
02:28:35,001 --> 02:28:37,000
Everybody out! Go!

1786
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,976
-Yes! Gotcha!

1787
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,477
Post Commander, this is

1788
02:29:01,501 --> 02:29:02,976
Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?

1789
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,477
Go ahead, Dr. Stone.

1790
02:29:04,501 --> 02:29:05,976
-This is a false alarm.

1791
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,240
- Someone has hacked into.
- The system. We must alert...

1792
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Victor.

1793
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,477
Dr. Stone, you there?

1794
02:29:22,501 --> 02:29:24,000
I don't copy.

1795
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:25,976
I was mistaken.

1796
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:26,977
The alarm's legit.

1797
02:29:27,001 --> 02:29:28,977
- Everybody out.
- And nobody, I repeat,

1798
02:29:29,003 --> 02:29:30,477
Nobody comes back inside

1799
02:29:30,501 --> 02:29:31,976
without my say-so.

1800
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,000
Roger that, sir.

1801
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:44,976
Get the civilians out!

1802
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Let's go! Let's go!

1803
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:51,977
- Everybody got out okay?
- I think so.

1804
02:29:52,001 --> 02:29:53,001
- Everybody?
- Yes.

1805
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
This way.

1806
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,976
It knows he's here.

1807
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
Ooh, that's intense.

1808
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,976
This is amazing.

1809
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:51,976
This is crazy.

1810
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,976
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

1811
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,040
- You two lunatics.
- Better know what you're doing.

1812
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Systems coming online.

1813
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:28,976
Welcome, Victor.

1814
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:29,977
Would you like

1815
02:33:30,001 --> 02:33:30,976
to assume command?

1816
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,000
I'm in.

1817
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,977
- The ship says.
- The Mother Box is hostile.

1818
02:33:44,003 --> 02:33:45,977
- I can override.
- The security protocols,

1819
02:33:46,001 --> 02:33:47,976
- But there's no time to repair.
- All the electrical damage.

1820
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:48,977
- That Luthor's.
- Power surges caused.

1821
02:33:49,001 --> 02:33:49,976
To the primary capacitors.

1822
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:50,977
English.

1823
02:33:51,001 --> 02:33:52,477
There's not enough charge

1824
02:33:52,501 --> 02:33:53,976
to wake the box.

1825
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
I might be able to do it.

1826
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,977
- I mean, I might be able.
- To jump-start it.

1827
02:34:00,003 --> 02:34:01,977
- I don't like.
- To break this rule,

1828
02:34:02,001 --> 02:34:02,977
- But when I approach.
- The speed of light, I...

1829
02:34:03,003 --> 02:34:04,977
- Look, crazy things.
- Happen to time,

1830
02:34:05,003 --> 02:34:06,477
But if I do it, I create

1831
02:34:06,501 --> 02:34:07,976
massive electrical power.

1832
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,979
- I could backtrack,
- if I can get enough distance,

1833
02:34:10,003 --> 02:34:11,979
- I can conduct a significant.
- Electrical current.

1834
02:34:12,003 --> 02:34:13,477
I might be able to wake

1835
02:34:13,501 --> 02:34:14,976
the box, if that's...

1836
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:16,976
still what we want?

1837
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:18,000
It is. Do it.

1838
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:23,976
Hey, Miss Lane.

1839
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:24,977
Morning.

1840
02:34:25,001 --> 02:34:26,977
- I didn't think.
- You were coming.

1841
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:29,000
One last time.

1842
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:47,977
I see engines, so this must be

1843
02:34:48,001 --> 02:34:49,976
the end of the line. So I'm...

1844
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,000
I'm in position.

1845
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:55,477
Ready to initiate

1846
02:34:55,501 --> 02:34:56,976
drop sequence.

1847
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
The Mother Box is ready.

1848
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:19,977
- The ship's begging me.
- Not to wake the box.

1849
02:35:20,003 --> 02:35:21,977
- This action - is irreversible.

1850
02:35:22,001 --> 02:35:22,954
- It's afraid. - It knows Steppenwolf.
- Will come for it.

1851
02:35:23,001 --> 02:35:24,977
- We know that already.
- Continue.

1852
02:35:25,003 --> 02:35:26,477
I strongly advise

1853
02:35:26,501 --> 02:35:27,976
against activation.

1854
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:28,977
- Barry, I'm initiating.
- The countdown.

1855
02:35:29,003 --> 02:35:30,977
- This action - is irreversible.

1856
02:35:31,001 --> 02:35:32,001
- Five...
- Five...

1857
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:33,977
- Five...
- Apokoliptian technology.

1858
02:35:34,001 --> 02:35:34,977
- Is hostile.
- This is a bad idea.

1859
02:35:35,001 --> 02:35:35,977
- No, it isn't.
- Keep going.

1860
02:35:36,001 --> 02:35:36,977
Four...

1861
02:35:37,001 --> 02:35:38,977
- Four...
- Four...

1862
02:35:39,001 --> 02:35:39,977
- I strongly advise.
- Against activation.

1863
02:35:40,003 --> 02:35:41,977
- We need to abort, now.
- Just do it.

1864
02:35:42,001 --> 02:35:42,977
- Three...
- Three...

1865
02:35:43,001 --> 02:35:43,977
Three...

1866
02:35:44,001 --> 02:35:45,977
- Two...
- Two...

1867
02:35:46,003 --> 02:35:47,977
- Two...
- This course is irreversible.

1868
02:35:48,001 --> 02:35:49,001
- One.
- One.

1869
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:50,977
One.

1870
02:35:51,001 --> 02:35:52,977
- This action - is irreversible.

1871
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:23,000
- Victor?
- No.

1872
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Go?

1873
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,477
The future

1874
02:38:57,501 --> 02:38:58,976
has taken root in the present.

1875
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
-Get down!

1876
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:46,000
He's back.

1877
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:14,477
Something's wrong.

1878
02:41:14,501 --> 02:41:16,000
He's scanning us.

1879
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
What?

1880
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Victor?

1881
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Victor?

1882
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:40,977
-Shit.

1883
02:41:41,001 --> 02:41:41,977
-What are you doing?

1884
02:41:42,001 --> 02:41:43,976
It's my auto-defense system.

1885
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:44,976
It senses danger.

1886
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:45,977
Victor, no! Victor!

1887
02:41:46,001 --> 02:41:47,977
- I can't control it.
- Don't!

1888
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Kal-El, no!

1889
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:11,977
- He's confused.
- He doesn't know who he is.

1890
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:20,477
Arthur,

1891
02:42:20,501 --> 02:42:22,000
we need to restrain him.

1892
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:53,977
Kal-El,

1893
02:42:54,001 --> 02:42:56,000
the last Son of Krypton...

1894
02:42:57,000 --> 02:43:00,000
remember who you are.

1895
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Tell me who you...

1896
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Let's go!

1897
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:49,000
You should probably move.

1898
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:52,977
-You all right?

1899
02:44:53,001 --> 02:44:53,977
-Yeah.

1900
02:44:54,001 --> 02:44:55,477
Get up.

1901
02:44:55,501 --> 02:44:57,000
Take cover back there. Go.

1902
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:51,000
Please don't make me do this.

1903
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:24,976
Clark.

1904
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
Clark, no.

1905
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:39,976
Clark.

1906
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:41,000
No.

1907
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:43,000
This world needs you.

1908
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:49,976
Clark.

1909
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:50,977
Clark.

1910
02:46:51,001 --> 02:46:52,977
- Whoa! Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

1911
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Clark.

1912
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Please.

1913
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Please.

1914
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:48,976
Please.

1915
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,976
Just go.

1916
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:52,977
Yeah.

1917
02:47:53,001 --> 02:47:55,000
Let's go.

1918
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:30,000
I'm so sorry.

1919
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:39,977
Take cover!

1920
02:48:40,001 --> 02:48:41,477
-He's coming.

1921
02:48:41,501 --> 02:48:42,976
-The Mother Box.

1922
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Where is it?

1923
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
Come on.

1924
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Come on.

1925
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:24,977
Attention,

1926
02:49:25,001 --> 02:49:26,976
security breach detected.

1927
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:28,976
Sector Four, Level Three.

1928
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:30,477
Implement lockdown

1929
02:49:30,501 --> 02:49:32,000
procedures immediately.

1930
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Give me the Mother Box.

1931
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
No, no, no.

1932
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Dad, wait! Don't!

1933
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:04,000
So begins the end.

1934
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Victor?

1935
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:15,477
Vic... Whoa, Victor.

1936
02:51:15,501 --> 02:51:17,000
Are you okay, man? Come on.

1937
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Victor?

1938
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:26,976
He's dead.

1939
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:28,000
What?

1940
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:30,000
My father.

1941
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,976
I didn't save him. I couldn't.

1942
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Oh, my God.

1943
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:44,977
His father's dead

1944
02:51:45,001 --> 02:51:45,976
'cause of us.

1945
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:47,840
- I told you waking that box.
- Was a bad idea.

1946
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:48,977
It wasn't a bad idea.

1947
02:51:49,001 --> 02:51:50,477
We needed Superman.

1948
02:51:50,501 --> 02:51:51,976
We still do.

1949
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:53,977
- Well, whatever returned,
- it isn't Superman.

1950
02:51:54,003 --> 02:51:55,477
His body and powers, maybe.

1951
02:51:55,501 --> 02:51:56,976
But it ain't him.

1952
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:58,976
It is him.

1953
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,976
He recognized Lois Lane.

1954
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:02,977
-Who?

1955
02:52:03,001 --> 02:52:03,977
-The woman he loves.

1956
02:52:04,001 --> 02:52:05,977
- He remembers her.
- Nah.

1957
02:52:06,003 --> 02:52:07,979
- He went to her 'cause.
- She wasn't afraid of him.

1958
02:52:08,003 --> 02:52:10,000
It's called instinct, Diana.

1959
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:18,977
- Wait,
- where did Steppenwolf go?

1960
02:52:19,003 --> 02:52:20,976
He's gone back to his base

1961
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:22,976
to assemble the three boxes.

1962
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:23,977
- And we don't know.
- Where his base is.

1963
02:52:24,003 --> 02:52:25,977
- Or how long until...
- Hours.

1964
02:52:26,003 --> 02:52:27,977
- The boxes synchronize,
- Unity forms,

1965
02:52:28,003 --> 02:52:29,477
We don't get there in time

1966
02:52:29,501 --> 02:52:30,976
to stop it, the planet dies.

1967
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
This is not your...

1968
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:36,976
He knew.

1969
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:38,976
He knew, he knew, he knew.

1970
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:40,977
- He wasn't trying.
- To destroy the box...

1971
02:52:41,003 --> 02:52:42,976
He was trying to superheat it.

1972
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:43,977
- He made the core.
- The hottest thing.

1973
02:52:44,001 --> 02:52:44,977
- On Earth outside.
- Of a nuclear reactor.

1974
02:52:45,003 --> 02:52:46,977
- Now, anything that hot.
- Would have to...

1975
02:52:47,001 --> 02:52:47,977
Blink off the charts

1976
02:52:48,001 --> 02:52:49,976
on a thermal imaging system.

1977
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:51,477
Your father sacrificed himself

1978
02:52:51,501 --> 02:52:53,000
to mark that box.

1979
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:55,979
- We have to get back to my lab.
- And use the satellite.

1980
02:52:56,003 --> 02:52:57,977
- To scan the Earth.
- For thermal anomalies.

1981
02:52:58,001 --> 02:52:58,977
I'm already on it.

1982
02:52:59,001 --> 02:53:00,977
- I'm sorry.
- You have a satellite?

1983
02:53:01,003 --> 02:53:02,976
I have six.

1984
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Right.

1985
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:06,977
Let's go find

1986
02:53:07,001 --> 02:53:08,001
the son of a bitch.

1987
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
You brought us here.

1988
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:36,000
You remembered.

1989
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:38,000
This is home.

1990
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
You spoke.

1991
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Did I not before?

1992
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:22,477
Your mother got behind

1993
02:54:22,501 --> 02:54:24,000
on the payments.

1994
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
She never told anyone.

1995
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
I don't understand.

1996
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
She's a proud woman, Clark.

1997
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Here.

1998
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
She loved it here.

1999
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
So did I.

2000
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:13,000
So did I.

2001
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:39,977
Wow!

2002
02:55:40,001 --> 02:55:41,976
This is awesome.

2003
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Brought some friends.

2004
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,976
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

2005
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:54,477
Everyone, this is Alfred.

2006
02:55:54,501 --> 02:55:55,976
I work for him.

2007
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:56,977
-Alfred.

2008
02:55:57,001 --> 02:55:58,001
-Good day, ma'am.

2009
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
Oh...

2010
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
It's badass, Alfred.

2011
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
Well, I'll put on the tea.

2012
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:12,977
Great.

2013
02:56:13,001 --> 02:56:14,977
- I don't know where.
- We're gonna find the cups.

2014
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:18,477
There's the.

2015
02:56:18,501 --> 02:56:19,976
Mother Box, right there.

2016
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
Go to visible spectrum.

2017
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:25,976
Pozharnov.

2018
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:27,477
Ghost city

2019
02:56:27,501 --> 02:56:29,000
not far from Moscow.

2020
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:30,976
It's been abandoned since

2021
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:31,977
- the nuclear accident there.
- 30 years ago.

2022
02:56:32,003 --> 02:56:33,976
Not even the army goes in.

2023
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:34,977
- Right, it's probably.
- So radioactive.

2024
02:56:35,003 --> 02:56:36,977
- That you grow an extra foot.
- Outta your neck.

2025
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:38,977
Not anymore.

2026
02:56:39,001 --> 02:56:40,977
- He's harvested the radiation.
- To build his base.

2027
02:56:41,001 --> 02:56:42,001
Zoom.

2028
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:46,977
What the hell is he building?

2029
02:56:47,001 --> 02:56:48,976
The Unity's in there.

2030
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:49,977
We'll attack from above.

2031
02:56:50,001 --> 02:56:51,477
Explosives won't

2032
02:56:51,501 --> 02:56:52,976
separate the boxes,

2033
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:54,976
only strengthen their bond.

2034
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:55,977
- What?
- So we can't blow it up?

2035
02:56:56,003 --> 02:56:58,000
Not from the outside.

2036
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:00,477
I want to plug into.

2037
02:57:00,501 --> 02:57:01,976
The Unity, one-on-one.

2038
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:03,976
Fuse with it.

2039
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:04,977
- Weaken its bond.
- From the inside.

2040
02:57:05,003 --> 02:57:06,977
- So we can break it back.
- Into three.

2041
02:57:07,003 --> 02:57:08,977
- No, you don't know.
- What you'd be up against.

2042
02:57:09,003 --> 02:57:10,977
You'd have to stream

2043
02:57:11,001 --> 02:57:12,976
into The Unity by yourself.

2044
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:14,977
- These boxes together.
- Are world destroyers.

2045
02:57:15,003 --> 02:57:16,976
A billion years old.

2046
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:18,979
- They'll get inside you.
- And find your weaknesses.

2047
02:57:19,003 --> 02:57:20,977
- And your fears,
- and use them to destroy you.

2048
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:22,977
Just get me in

2049
02:57:23,001 --> 02:57:23,976
and get me time.

2050
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:24,977
You could die, Victor.

2051
02:57:25,001 --> 02:57:26,477
If I don't, we all die.

2052
02:57:26,501 --> 02:57:28,000
Period.

2053
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
I got nothing left.

2054
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:40,977
- You wanted me.
- To use these gifts, right?

2055
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:45,976
That's what I'm gonna do.

2056
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
Okay. So...

2057
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:49,977
- if Victor wants.
- To try to save the world.

2058
02:57:50,003 --> 02:57:51,977
- By fusing.
- With the doom boxes,

2059
02:57:52,003 --> 02:57:53,977
- I say we put him.
- In the doom boxes.

2060
02:57:54,003 --> 02:57:55,477
But getting him in

2061
02:57:55,501 --> 02:57:57,000
means attacking that base.

2062
02:57:58,000 --> 02:57:58,977
Fighting the devil

2063
02:57:59,001 --> 02:57:59,976
and his army

2064
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:00,977
in hell.

2065
02:58:01,001 --> 02:58:02,977
- I mean,
- this guy's probably fought.

2066
02:58:03,003 --> 02:58:04,477
Hundreds of thousands

2067
02:58:04,501 --> 02:58:05,976
of other superbeings

2068
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:07,977
- on the other planets.
- He's destroyed, right?

2069
02:58:08,001 --> 02:58:08,977
- And we have to assume.
- He's won.

2070
02:58:09,003 --> 02:58:10,977
- I don't care.
- How many demons he's fought.

2071
02:58:11,001 --> 02:58:12,001
In how many hells...

2072
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:14,477
he's never fought us.

2073
02:58:14,501 --> 02:58:16,000
Not us united.

2074
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:07,977
Take that as a "yes."

2075
02:59:08,001 --> 02:59:10,000
What?

2076
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
The ring.

2077
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
You're really back.

2078
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:56,000
I have a second chance, Lo.

2079
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
And I am not gonna waste it.

2080
03:00:58,000 --> 03:00:59,976
Are you really you?

2081
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
I'm really me, Ma.

2082
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:22,000
Listen, Ma.

2083
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:23,977
They wanted me back

2084
03:01:24,001 --> 03:01:25,001
for a reason.

2085
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
I need to find out why.

2086
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:50,000
How's Victor doing?

2087
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:55,477
You know,

2088
03:01:55,501 --> 03:01:57,000
wanted to be by himself.

2089
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:00,477
We're asking a kid

2090
03:02:00,501 --> 03:02:01,976
who just lost his father

2091
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:03,977
- to go up against.
- The most powerful machines.

2092
03:02:04,001 --> 03:02:05,001
In the universe.

2093
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:08,000
It's not fair.

2094
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
I thought you didn't care?

2095
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
I never said that.

2096
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
What is it?

2097
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:32,976
Uh...

2098
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:34,477
I had a dream,

2099
03:02:34,501 --> 03:02:35,976
like, I don't know,

2100
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:38,976
almost like a premonition.

2101
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,976
It was the end of the world

2102
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:42,977
and Barry Allen

2103
03:02:43,001 --> 03:02:44,001
was right here

2104
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:46,977
and he said to me,

2105
03:02:47,001 --> 03:02:49,000
"Lois Lane is the key."

2106
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:54,976
She is... to Superman.

2107
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,976
Every heart has one.

2108
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
I think it's something more.

2109
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:03,000
Something darker.

2110
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:07,977
Master Wayne.

2111
03:03:08,001 --> 03:03:09,976
Master Wayne!

2112
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
You need to see this.

2113
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:36,976
You fixed it.

2114
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
It wanted to fly.

2115
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:40,977
Flight is its nature.

2116
03:03:41,001 --> 03:03:43,000
Yours, too.

2117
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:50,977
- He'll be here, Alfred,
- I know it.

2118
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:53,976
What makes you so sure?

2119
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:57,000
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

2120
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:20,000
At last.

2121
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:25,000
Prepare for his arrival.

2122
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:31,000
My redemption is nigh.

2123
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:40,000
Unite.

2124
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:48,000
Synchronize.

2125
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:32,977
The satellites revealed

2126
03:05:33,001 --> 03:05:34,976
he's created a defensive dome.

2127
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:35,977
It's a design flaw.

2128
03:05:36,001 --> 03:05:37,477
Take out the tower,

2129
03:05:37,501 --> 03:05:38,976
the dome will fall.

2130
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:40,979
- The enemy never anticipated.
- A frontal assault.

2131
03:05:41,003 --> 03:05:42,977
- Right, probably.
- 'cause he didn't think.

2132
03:05:43,003 --> 03:05:45,000
Anyone would be that nuts.

2133
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:46,977
Bruce is right.

2134
03:05:47,001 --> 03:05:48,977
- We've got to destroy.
- The defensive dome.

2135
03:05:49,003 --> 03:05:50,979
- So we can reach The Unity.
- Before it synchronizes.

2136
03:05:51,003 --> 03:05:52,977
- What if the dome's.
- Not destroyed?

2137
03:05:53,001 --> 03:05:54,001
It'll be destroyed.

2138
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:55,977
- Once Victor.
- Is linked with The Unity.

2139
03:05:56,003 --> 03:05:57,976
With Barry's help,

2140
03:05:58,000 --> 03:05:59,977
- he'll break through.
- The Unity's defenses.

2141
03:06:00,001 --> 03:06:00,977
- Remind me, - how's that again?

2142
03:06:01,003 --> 03:06:02,976
Uh, with the power of love.

2143
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:04,477
-Barry.

2144
03:06:04,501 --> 06:12:07,477
-With a catastrophic

2145
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,976
energy surge.

2146
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:07,000
Good.

2147
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:08,977
- You'll have to run faster.
- Than you've ever attempted.

2148
03:06:09,003 --> 03:06:10,477
To generate

2149
03:06:10,501 --> 03:06:11,976
a charge of that size.

2150
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:13,979
- And then you make.
- Physical contact with Victor.

2151
03:06:14,003 --> 03:06:15,477
That force should propel him

2152
03:06:15,501 --> 03:06:16,976
inside The Unity.

2153
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:17,977
And, Victor,

2154
03:06:18,001 --> 03:06:18,977
it's all up to you.

2155
03:06:19,001 --> 03:06:20,977
Take it apart from the inside

2156
03:06:21,001 --> 03:06:22,976
before it synchronizes.

2157
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:24,477
Whew. We actually

2158
03:06:24,501 --> 03:06:25,976
finally have a plan.

2159
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
We have a plan.

2160
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:44,977
- The symbol.
- Of the house of El means hope.

2161
03:06:45,003 --> 03:06:46,477
Embodied within that hope

2162
03:06:46,501 --> 03:06:47,976
is the fundamental belief

2163
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:49,977
in the potential of every

2164
03:06:50,001 --> 03:06:51,976
person to be a force for good.

2165
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:52,977
Clark...

2166
03:06:53,001 --> 03:06:54,977
- That's what.
- You can bring them.

2167
03:06:55,003 --> 03:06:56,977
- You were.
- Sent here for a reason.

2168
03:06:57,001 --> 03:06:57,977
- You will give.
- The people of Earth.

2169
03:06:58,003 --> 03:07:00,000
An ideal to strive towards.

2170
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:01,976
And even if it takes you

2171
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:03,000
the rest of your life,

2172
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:05,477
you owe it to yourself to

2173
03:07:05,501 --> 03:07:06,976
find out what that reason is.

2174
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:07,977
They will stumble,

2175
03:07:08,001 --> 03:07:09,001
they will fall.

2176
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:11,977
- You're gonna.
- Have to make a choice.

2177
03:07:12,003 --> 03:07:13,977
- They will join you.
- In the sun, Kal.

2178
03:07:14,003 --> 03:07:15,977
- A choice.
- Of whether to stand proud.

2179
03:07:16,003 --> 03:07:17,977
- In front of the human race.
- Or not.

2180
03:07:18,003 --> 03:07:19,977
You will help them

2181
03:07:20,001 --> 03:07:22,000
accomplish wonders.

2182
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:40,977
All the hopes and dreams

2183
03:07:41,001 --> 03:07:42,976
of Krypton live in you now.

2184
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:46,976
I'm so proud of you, son.

2185
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:48,477
Your mother and I

2186
03:07:48,501 --> 03:07:49,976
loved you.

2187
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:50,977
Your mother and I knew

2188
03:07:51,001 --> 03:07:54,000
you would change the world.

2189
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:57,976
Your heart was tested.

2190
03:07:58,000 --> 03:07:59,977
- I know.
- It's been hard, Clark.

2191
03:08:00,003 --> 03:08:01,477
But you gave hope

2192
03:08:01,501 --> 03:08:02,976
to their world.

2193
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:04,977
You need

2194
03:08:05,001 --> 03:08:06,976
to show them who you are.

2195
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:08,976
Love them, Kal.

2196
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:12,000
The way we loved you.

2197
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:15,000
Fly, son.

2198
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:17,000
It's time.

2199
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:22,160
I'm gonna take out that tower

2200
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:23,977
- and knock down.
- That shield dome.

2201
03:09:24,003 --> 03:09:26,000
Whatever you see,

2202
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,000
stick to the plan.

2203
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:32,977
- It's why.
- I brought you together.

2204
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:14,977
- Bruce, pull back.
- You're not gonna make it.

2205
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:18,477
Just have to knock

2206
03:10:18,501 --> 03:10:20,000
a little louder.

2207
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:46,976
Kill him!

2208
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:48,477
Get to the carriage.

2209
03:10:48,501 --> 03:10:50,000
Defend The Unity.

2210
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:56,000
Oh, shit.

2211
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:17,000
The tower's down.

2212
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:20,976
Do you read me?

2213
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:22,000
Uh, yeah, loud and clear.

2214
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:25,000
Are you okay?

2215
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:28,000
Bruce? Bruce?

2216
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:29,976
Get to the reactor.

2217
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:30,977
- I'll lure as many.
- Of these monsters.

2218
03:11:31,003 --> 03:11:32,977
- Away from you as I can.
- What does that mean?

2219
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:37,977
- Don't worry about me.
- Get to The Unity.

2220
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:41,976
They're here.

2221
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:43,000
Bruce?

2222
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:48,000
Comm went dead.

2223
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:51,000
Let's go.

2224
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:29,977
Come on, follow me,

2225
03:12:30,001 --> 03:12:31,001
you damn insects.

2226
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:52,000
Critical damage.

2227
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:32,977
You really are

2228
03:14:33,001 --> 03:14:34,001
outta your mind.

2229
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:01,976
You're welcome.

2230
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:03,000
My man.

2231
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:37,976
Yeah, we got this.

2232
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:39,000
You go do your thing.

2233
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:37,000
I'm assuming you're Alfred.

2234
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:40,000
Master Kent.

2235
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:43,000
He said you'd come.

2236
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:46,977
Now, let's hope

2237
03:17:47,001 --> 03:17:49,000
you're not too late.

2238
03:17:59,000 --> 03:18:02,000
-Hey!

2239
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:11,000
Remember me?

2240
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:15,000
Round two?

2241
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:17,000
Hell yeah.

2242
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:40,000
Shall we?

2243
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:42,976
Tell me, Amazon,

2244
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:44,977
why did you

2245
03:18:45,001 --> 03:18:46,976
abandon your own sisters

2246
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:48,477
only to cast your lot

2247
03:18:48,501 --> 03:18:49,976
with these creatures

2248
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:52,976
clinging to their puny lives?

2249
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:54,477
You weren't there

2250
03:18:54,501 --> 03:18:56,000
to protect them from me.

2251
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:59,000
And, sadly, you could have.

2252
03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:41,000
Barry, I'm in position.

2253
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:01,477
Okay.

2254
03:20:01,501 --> 03:20:02,976
I built the charge.

2255
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:05,000
You call it.

2256
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:07,000
Barry, on one.

2257
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:10,000
Three, two...

2258
03:20:13,000 --> 03:20:14,976
Get the hell off me!

2259
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:16,000
Victor!

2260
03:20:52,000 --> 03:20:54,000
Victor!

2261
03:20:57,000 --> 03:20:59,976
I watched your island burn,

2262
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:01,977
your sisters

2263
03:21:02,001 --> 03:21:03,976
begging for their lives.

2264
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:05,976
As did your mother.

2265
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:07,000
Liar.

2266
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:35,000
I can't maintain this!

2267
03:21:36,000 --> 03:21:37,000
Victor!

2268
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:01,000
Victor, I can't hold this!

2269
03:22:08,000 --> 03:22:10,000
For Darkseid.

2270
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:17,000
Not impressed.

2271
03:23:01,000 --> 03:23:01,977
All right.

2272
03:23:02,001 --> 03:23:04,000
Kal-El.

2273
03:23:42,000 --> 03:23:43,477
Barry, I'm connected

2274
03:23:43,501 --> 03:23:44,976
to The Unity.

2275
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:45,977
I need the charge

2276
03:23:46,001 --> 03:23:47,001
to get inside.

2277
03:24:09,000 --> 03:24:10,000
Barry?

2278
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:13,000
Barry, are you okay?

2279
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:14,977
Barry!

2280
03:24:15,001 --> 03:24:16,977
- I got the wind.
- Knocked out of me.

2281
03:24:17,003 --> 03:24:18,977
- Need a few seconds,
- that's all!

2282
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:37,477
Barry, where are you?

2283
03:24:37,501 --> 03:24:38,976
It's almost synchronized!

2284
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:40,976
Okay, okay.

2285
03:24:41,000 --> 03:24:43,976
Oh, my God. Gotta heal, Barry.

2286
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:46,000
Heal. Heal.

2287
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:13,000
Barry!

2288
03:25:26,000 --> 03:25:28,000
It's too late.

2289
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:30,000
Oh, no.

2290
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:36,000
He's here!

2291
03:26:06,000 --> 03:26:06,976
Okay.

2292
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:07,977
- Just gotta go faster.
- Than the speed of light.

2293
03:26:08,001 --> 03:26:08,977
Far beyond the speed of light.

2294
03:26:09,001 --> 03:26:10,977
- You gotta break the rule,
- Barry,

2295
03:26:11,003 --> 03:26:13,000
And you gotta do it now.

2296
03:26:26,000 --> 03:26:28,000
Dad...

2297
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:32,477
whatever happens,

2298
03:26:32,501 --> 03:26:34,000
I want you to know

2299
03:26:36,000 --> 03:26:38,000
your kid was one of them, Dad.

2300
03:26:42,000 --> 03:26:44,000
One of the best of the best.

2301
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:42,000
Make your own future.

2302
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:50,000
Make your own past.

2303
03:27:54,000 --> 03:27:58,000
It's all right now.

2304
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:45,977
We've been waiting

2305
03:28:46,001 --> 03:28:47,001
for you, Victor.

2306
03:28:48,000 --> 03:28:51,000
My broken boy.

2307
03:28:53,000 --> 03:28:53,977
You don't have to be

2308
03:28:54,001 --> 03:28:54,977
alone anymore.

2309
03:28:55,001 --> 03:28:57,000
We'll be together again.

2310
03:29:04,000 --> 03:29:07,000
We can put it back, Vic.

2311
03:29:11,000 --> 03:29:13,000
Make you whole again.

2312
03:29:25,000 --> 03:29:27,000
I'm not broken.

2313
03:29:36,000 --> 03:29:38,000
And I'm not alone.

2314
03:29:55,000 --> 03:29:56,000
Superman!

2315
03:31:27,000 --> 03:31:29,000
I told you.

2316
03:31:30,000 --> 03:31:33,000
Steppenwolf would fail.

2317
03:31:34,000 --> 03:31:37,976
Yes. Yes, you did.

2318
03:31:38,000 --> 03:31:39,000
My master,

2319
03:31:40,000 --> 03:31:41,477
now that the Mother Boxes

2320
03:31:41,501 --> 03:31:42,976
have been destroyed,

2321
03:31:43,000 --> 03:31:44,977
how will you retrieve

2322
03:31:45,001 --> 03:31:47,000
your great prize?

2323
03:31:48,000 --> 03:31:50,976
Anti-Life is found, DeSaad.

2324
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:53,477
And we will stop

2325
03:31:53,501 --> 03:31:56,000
at nothing to possess it.

2326
03:31:59,000 --> 03:32:00,976
Ready the armada.

2327
03:32:01,000 --> 03:32:04,000
We will use the old ways.

2328
03:34:28,000 --> 03:34:30,000
Your father twice over.

2329
03:34:38,000 --> 03:34:39,977
- Now, let me speak to you.
- From my heart,

2330
03:34:40,003 --> 03:34:41,976
Not as a scientist,

2331
03:34:42,000 --> 03:34:43,976
as a father.

2332
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:47,000
Your father twice over.

2333
03:34:49,000 --> 03:34:50,977
I brought you into the world

2334
03:34:51,001 --> 03:34:52,976
and back to it.

2335
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:54,977
You can't imagine how proud

2336
03:34:55,001 --> 03:34:56,976
I am of who you are.

2337
03:34:57,000 --> 03:34:59,000
Have always been.

2338
03:35:01,000 --> 03:35:02,440
- So many years.
- With you I wasted.

2339
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:04,477
So many wrongs

2340
03:35:04,501 --> 03:35:06,000
I've left un-righted.

2341
03:35:08,000 --> 03:35:10,976
Everything breaks, Victor.

2342
03:35:11,000 --> 03:35:13,000
Everything changes.

2343
03:35:24,000 --> 03:35:26,000
I gotta go see my father.

2344
03:36:01,000 --> 03:36:03,976
The world is hurt.

2345
03:36:04,000 --> 03:36:04,977
Broken.

2346
03:36:05,001 --> 03:36:06,976
Unexchangeable.

2347
03:36:07,000 --> 03:36:07,977
Ship's

2348
03:36:08,001 --> 03:36:08,977
all yours now, kid.

2349
03:36:09,001 --> 03:36:11,000
You're the boss.

2350
03:36:13,000 --> 03:36:14,477
"Ryan Choi,

2351
03:36:14,501 --> 03:36:15,976
Director of Nanotechnology."

2352
03:36:16,000 --> 03:36:17,976
That's your thing.

2353
03:36:18,000 --> 03:36:19,976
Uh, yep.

2354
03:36:20,000 --> 03:36:22,000
That's my thing.

2355
03:36:27,000 --> 03:36:28,977
But the world's

2356
03:36:29,001 --> 03:36:30,976
not fixed in the past,

2357
03:36:31,000 --> 03:36:32,000
only the future.

2358
03:36:34,000 --> 03:36:37,976
The not yet. The now.

2359
03:36:38,000 --> 03:36:39,977
Wow.

2360
03:36:40,001 --> 03:36:41,976
Must be 100, 150 feet.

2361
03:36:42,000 --> 03:36:43,000
Must be.

2362
03:36:44,000 --> 03:36:45,976
Big round table.

2363
03:36:46,000 --> 03:36:48,000
Six chairs, right there.

2364
03:36:49,000 --> 03:36:51,000
But room for more.

2365
03:36:53,000 --> 03:36:55,000
But room for more.

2366
03:36:56,000 --> 03:36:58,000
God help us.

2367
03:36:59,000 --> 03:37:02,000
The now is you.

2368
03:37:05,000 --> 03:37:06,976
What?

2369
03:37:07,000 --> 03:37:08,477
It's actually the worst job

2370
03:37:08,501 --> 03:37:09,976
you can get in a crime lab.

2371
03:37:10,000 --> 03:37:11,977
- But, uh,
- my foot's in the door.

2372
03:37:12,003 --> 03:37:14,000
This is like a "job" job?

2373
03:37:15,000 --> 03:37:16,000
"Job" job.

2374
03:37:19,000 --> 03:37:22,000
Your foot's in the door.

2375
03:37:24,000 --> 03:37:25,976
Isn't that a thing people say?

2376
03:37:26,000 --> 03:37:27,976
Your foot's in the door.

2377
03:37:28,000 --> 03:37:29,977
- Yeah, that's something.
- People say, man.

2378
03:37:30,003 --> 03:37:31,976
-His foot's in the door!

2379
03:37:32,000 --> 03:37:34,080
- That's my boy, right there!
- Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

2380
03:37:35,000 --> 03:37:35,976
Taught him nothing he knows.

2381
03:37:36,000 --> 03:37:36,977
- Yes!
- Dad, you're gonna.

2382
03:37:37,001 --> 03:37:38,001
Get maced again.

2383
03:37:42,000 --> 03:37:43,000
No stopping you now.

2384
03:37:46,000 --> 03:37:46,976
Thanks, Dad.

2385
03:37:47,000 --> 03:37:47,977
Now.

2386
03:37:48,001 --> 03:37:49,477
Now's your time, Victor,

2387
03:37:49,501 --> 03:37:50,976
to rise.

2388
03:37:51,000 --> 03:37:52,477
"Thank you" is not enough

2389
03:37:52,501 --> 03:37:53,976
for what you did.

2390
03:37:54,000 --> 03:37:55,977
I just undid a mistake,

2391
03:37:56,001 --> 03:37:58,000
that's all.

2392
03:38:08,000 --> 03:38:09,477
How did you get the house

2393
03:38:09,501 --> 03:38:10,976
back from the bank?

2394
03:38:11,000 --> 03:38:13,000
I bought the bank.

2395
03:38:16,000 --> 03:38:17,976
Congratulations, by the way.

2396
03:38:18,000 --> 03:38:19,976
Do this. Be this.

2397
03:38:20,000 --> 03:38:22,477
The man I never was.

2398
03:38:22,501 --> 03:38:24,976
The hero you are.

2399
03:38:25,000 --> 03:38:26,477
Take your place

2400
03:38:26,501 --> 03:38:27,976
among the brave ones.

2401
03:38:28,000 --> 03:38:30,477
The ones that were, that are,

2402
03:38:30,501 --> 03:38:33,000
that are yet to be.

2403
03:39:06,000 --> 03:39:09,000
It's time you stand,

2404
03:39:12,000 --> 03:39:14,000
fight,

2405
03:39:16,000 --> 03:39:18,000
discover,

2406
03:39:23,000 --> 03:39:25,000
heal, love,

2407
03:39:28,000 --> 03:39:29,000
win.

2408
03:39:56,000 --> 03:39:57,976
The time

2409
03:39:58,000 --> 03:39:59,000
is now.

2410
03:40:08,000 --> 03:40:09,976
Ready?

2411
03:40:10,000 --> 03:40:11,000
Come on, Stevens.

2412
03:40:15,000 --> 03:40:16,400
- All right,
- let's keep it moving.

2413
03:40:18,000 --> 03:40:19,000
Keep going.

2414
03:40:21,000 --> 03:40:23,000
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.

2415
03:40:26,000 --> 03:40:28,000
Luthor.

2416
03:40:32,000 --> 03:40:34,000
Open up two, Carl, please.

2417
03:40:43,000 --> 03:40:44,000
Luthor.

2418
03:40:49,000 --> 03:40:50,680
- All right,
- stop jerking around, Luthor,

2419
03:40:51,000 --> 03:40:52,560
- Or I'm gonna.
- Have to come in there.

2420
03:42:21,000 --> 03:42:22,976
Ah, there he is.

2421
03:42:23,000 --> 03:42:24,976
Welcome aboard.

2422
03:42:25,000 --> 03:42:25,977
Care for a glass

2423
03:42:26,001 --> 03:42:26,977
of Gout de Diamants?

2424
03:42:27,001 --> 03:42:28,977
- I was just celebrating.
- God's return.

2425
03:42:29,003 --> 03:42:30,977
- Out of the ground.
- And back up into the sky.

2426
03:42:31,003 --> 03:42:32,477
I heard

2427
03:42:32,501 --> 07:25:03,477
you were a few clowns

2428
03:42:31,000 --> 03:42:33,976
short of a circus.

2429
03:42:34,000 --> 03:42:35,976
I was, thank you,

2430
03:42:36,000 --> 03:42:37,977
- until the good doctors.
- At Arkham helped me.

2431
03:42:38,003 --> 03:42:39,976
Find some much needed clarity.

2432
03:42:40,000 --> 03:42:41,477
Now, you volunteered

2433
03:42:41,501 --> 03:42:42,976
to destroy the bat

2434
03:42:43,000 --> 03:42:43,977
free of charge.

2435
03:42:44,001 --> 03:42:45,976
Why the pro bono work?

2436
03:42:46,000 --> 03:42:47,976
It's personal.

2437
03:42:48,000 --> 03:42:49,477
Ah, let me guess,

2438
03:42:49,501 --> 03:42:51,000
an eye for an eye?

2439
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:53,977
- You said you had something.
- I'd want?

2440
03:42:54,003 --> 03:42:55,977
- You'd better not be.
- Wasting my time.

2441
03:42:56,003 --> 03:42:57,977
- Ooh. And endure.
- Your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

2442
03:42:58,003 --> 03:42:59,976
No, I wouldn't think of it.

2443
03:43:00,000 --> 03:43:01,440
- Uh, I have too much.
- To live for.

2444
03:43:02,000 --> 03:43:03,477
And more important things

2445
03:43:03,501 --> 03:43:04,976
to do.

2446
03:43:05,000 --> 03:43:07,976
But if you want the Batman,

2447
03:43:08,000 --> 03:43:09,977
here is something

2448
03:43:10,001 --> 03:43:12,000
that can help you.

2449
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:17,000
His name is Bruce Wayne.

2450
03:43:20,000 --> 03:43:23,000
Hmm. On second thought,

2451
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:25,977
we do have something

2452
03:43:26,001 --> 03:43:27,001
to celebrate.

2453
03:43:28,000 --> 03:43:29,000
Good boy.

2454
03:44:34,000 --> 03:44:35,000
Clear.

2455
03:44:40,000 --> 03:44:42,000
How much further?

2456
03:44:43,000 --> 03:44:44,000
We're almost there.

2457
03:44:47,000 --> 03:44:47,977
Well, we need to hurry.

2458
03:44:48,001 --> 03:44:49,977
- We can't be out in the open.
- Much longer.

2459
03:44:50,003 --> 03:44:52,000
He'll come for us.

2460
03:44:55,000 --> 03:44:56,976
Let him come.

2461
03:44:57,000 --> 03:44:58,000
Let the bastard come.

2462
03:45:00,000 --> 03:45:00,977
I'll stab this

2463
03:45:01,001 --> 03:45:01,977
through his heart

2464
03:45:02,001 --> 03:45:03,976
for what he did to Arthur.

2465
03:45:04,000 --> 03:45:06,000
I want to make him pay.

2466
03:45:08,000 --> 03:45:09,477
I understand

2467
03:45:09,501 --> 03:45:10,976
how you feel, Mera.

2468
03:45:11,000 --> 03:45:13,976
You have no idea how I feel.

2469
03:45:14,000 --> 03:45:14,977
But we have to

2470
03:45:15,001 --> 03:45:15,977
stick to the plan

2471
03:45:16,001 --> 03:45:17,977
- to have any chance.
- To make this right.

2472
03:45:26,000 --> 03:45:29,000
Who have you ever loved?

2473
03:45:43,000 --> 03:45:44,977
Au contraire,

2474
03:45:45,001 --> 03:45:47,000
my little fish stick.

2475
03:45:50,000 --> 03:45:50,977
He knows exactly

2476
03:45:51,001 --> 03:45:51,977
what it's like

2477
03:45:52,001 --> 03:45:54,000
to lose someone he loves.

2478
03:45:56,000 --> 03:45:58,000
You know, like, uh,

2479
03:45:59,000 --> 03:46:01,000
a father,

2480
03:46:02,000 --> 03:46:03,976
like a mother.

2481
03:46:04,000 --> 03:46:05,977
Be very careful

2482
03:46:06,001 --> 03:46:08,000
with the next thing you say.

2483
03:46:09,000 --> 03:46:11,000
Like an adopted son.

2484
03:46:15,000 --> 03:46:17,000
Isn't that right,

2485
03:46:18,000 --> 03:46:20,000
Batman?

2486
03:46:23,000 --> 03:46:23,977
Maybe, in a way,

2487
03:46:24,001 --> 03:46:25,977
- that smelly.
- Old flounder is right.

2488
03:46:28,000 --> 03:46:29,477
Because how many

2489
03:46:29,501 --> 03:46:30,976
can die in your arms

2490
03:46:31,000 --> 03:46:32,200
before you grow numb to death?

2491
03:46:34,000 --> 03:46:36,976
That's not very careful.

2492
03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:38,977
And how many dead eyes

2493
03:46:39,001 --> 03:46:40,976
can you look into

2494
03:46:41,000 --> 03:46:42,977
- before you die inside.
- Yourself?

2495
03:46:44,000 --> 03:46:45,477
I've been dead inside

2496
03:46:45,501 --> 03:46:46,976
a long time,

2497
03:46:47,000 --> 03:46:48,976
but even I have a limit.

2498
03:46:49,000 --> 03:46:50,979
- And if you cross that line,
- I swear to God, I will...

2499
03:46:51,003 --> 03:46:53,976
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

2500
03:46:54,000 --> 03:46:56,000
You won't kill me.

2501
03:46:57,000 --> 03:46:58,976
I'm your best friend.

2502
03:46:59,000 --> 03:47:01,477
Besides, who's gonna give you

2503
03:47:01,501 --> 03:47:04,000
a reach-around?

2504
03:47:06,000 --> 03:47:07,000
Anyway,

2505
03:47:08,000 --> 03:47:10,000
you need me.

2506
03:47:11,000 --> 03:47:12,976
You

2507
03:47:13,000 --> 03:47:14,477
need me to help you

2508
03:47:14,501 --> 03:47:15,976
undo this world

2509
03:47:16,000 --> 03:47:17,477
you created

2510
03:47:17,501 --> 03:47:19,000
by letting her die.

2511
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:22,976
Poor Lois.

2512
03:47:23,000 --> 03:47:26,000
How she suffered so!

2513
03:47:32,000 --> 03:47:33,976
I often wonder

2514
03:47:34,000 --> 03:47:34,977
how many

2515
03:47:35,001 --> 03:47:35,977
alternate timelines

2516
03:47:36,001 --> 03:47:37,477
do you destroy

2517
03:47:37,501 --> 03:47:39,000
the world because...

2518
03:47:40,000 --> 03:47:40,977
frankly, you don't have

2519
03:47:41,001 --> 03:47:44,000
the cojones to die yourself.

2520
03:47:45,000 --> 03:47:46,000
Hmm?

2521
03:47:48,000 --> 03:47:49,976
So, as usual,

2522
03:47:50,000 --> 03:47:52,000
I'll be the bigger man.

2523
03:47:56,000 --> 03:47:57,976
A truce,

2524
03:47:58,000 --> 03:48:00,000
Bruce.

2525
03:48:02,000 --> 03:48:04,477
As long as you

2526
03:48:04,501 --> 03:48:07,000
have this card, a truce.

2527
03:48:09,000 --> 03:48:10,000
But all you have to do

2528
03:48:11,000 --> 03:48:11,976
is tear it in half

2529
03:48:12,000 --> 03:48:12,977
- and I'm happy.
- To discuss with you.

2530
03:48:13,003 --> 03:48:14,477
In any way you like,

2531
03:48:14,501 --> 03:48:16,000
why you sent the Boy Wonder

2532
03:48:18,000 --> 03:48:20,000
to do a man's job?

2533
03:48:23,000 --> 03:48:24,976
You know, it's funny

2534
03:48:25,000 --> 03:48:25,977
- that you would talk.
- About people.

2535
03:48:26,003 --> 03:48:27,976
Who died in my arms

2536
03:48:28,000 --> 03:48:28,977
because when I held

2537
03:48:29,001 --> 03:48:29,977
Harley Quinn

2538
03:48:30,001 --> 03:48:31,977
- and she was bleeding.
- And dying,

2539
03:48:32,003 --> 03:48:33,977
She begged me

2540
03:48:34,001 --> 03:48:35,976
with her last breath

2541
03:48:36,000 --> 03:48:37,976
that when I killed you,

2542
03:48:38,000 --> 03:48:39,977
and make no mistake,

2543
03:48:40,001 --> 03:48:41,976
I will fucking kill you...

2544
03:48:42,000 --> 03:48:44,000
that I'd do it slow.

2545
03:48:45,000 --> 03:48:47,000
I'm gonna honor that promise.

2546
03:49:18,000 --> 03:49:21,000
Oh. You're good.

2547
03:49:25,000 --> 03:49:27,000
You almost had me.

2548
03:49:46,000 --> 03:49:46,977
Where are we holing up?

2549
03:49:47,001 --> 03:49:49,976
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

2550
03:49:50,000 --> 03:49:51,477
Still think it was a good idea

2551
03:49:51,501 --> 03:49:52,976
bringing him along?

2552
03:49:53,000 --> 03:49:56,000
-What do you think?

2553
03:50:02,000 --> 03:50:03,000
He's found us.

2554
03:51:32,000 --> 03:51:33,976
Can I help you?

2555
03:51:34,000 --> 03:51:35,977
I'm sure you know Darkseid

2556
03:51:36,001 --> 03:51:37,976
is not finished with Earth.

2557
03:51:38,000 --> 03:51:39,477
The Anti-Life Equation

2558
03:51:39,501 --> 03:51:40,976
is here somewhere.

2559
03:51:41,000 --> 03:51:42,477
We have to find it

2560
03:51:42,501 --> 03:51:43,976
before he does.

2561
03:51:44,000 --> 03:51:45,976
There's a war coming.

2562
03:51:46,000 --> 03:51:47,976
And I'm here to help.

2563
03:51:48,000 --> 03:51:50,976
I'm sorry, who are you again?

2564
03:51:51,000 --> 03:51:52,976
I've gone by many names

2565
03:51:53,000 --> 03:51:54,477
and taken many forms.

2566
03:51:54,501 --> 03:51:55,976
And like you,

2567
03:51:56,000 --> 03:51:57,477
I've realized I have

2568
03:51:57,501 --> 03:51:58,976
a stake in this world

2569
03:51:59,000 --> 03:52:00,477
and it's time

2570
03:52:00,501 --> 03:52:01,976
I started fighting for it.

2571
03:52:02,000 --> 03:52:04,000
Oh.

2572
03:52:05,000 --> 03:52:06,977
- Well, we could.
- Definitely use the help.

2573
03:52:07,003 --> 03:52:11,000
So, glad you're here.

2574
03:52:12,000 --> 03:52:12,976
You know, I never thought

2575
03:52:13,000 --> 03:52:13,977
- I'd see.
- The defenders of Earth.

2576
03:52:14,003 --> 03:52:16,976
United and fighting as one.

2577
03:52:17,000 --> 03:52:18,477
It wouldn't have happened

2578
03:52:18,501 --> 03:52:20,000
without you, Bruce.

2579
03:52:21,000 --> 03:52:22,477
Your mother and father

2580
03:52:22,501 --> 03:52:24,000
would be proud.

2581
03:52:25,000 --> 03:52:26,000
I hope so.

2582
03:52:32,000 --> 03:52:35,000
Well, I'll be in touch.

2583
03:52:36,000 --> 03:52:39,976
Oh, and some have called me

2584
03:52:40,000 --> 03:52:43,000
the Martian Manhunter.

2585
03:52:50,000 --> 03:52:53,000
