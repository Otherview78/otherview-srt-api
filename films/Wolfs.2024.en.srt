1
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,918
Fuck. Fuck.

2
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,629
Fuck. Oh, God.

3
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,194
Okay. Holy shit. No.

4
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,987
For Christ's sake.

5
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,085
Hey.

6
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,643
Holy shit.

7
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,961
Oh, G...

8
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:36,782
No.

9
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,930
<i>We're sorry,</i>

10
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,601
<i>you have reached a number that has been
disconnected or is no longer in service.</i>

11
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:07,104
<i>Please check the number
and try your call again.</i>

12
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,704
Hello.

13
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,624
<i>How did you get this number?</i>

14
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:37,759
I was told that if I ever needed help,
serious help, to call you.

15
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,262
<i>Let me ask you again.
How did you get this number?</i>

16
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,681
He said you'd ask that,

17
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,246
the man who gave it to me,
and he said not to say.

18
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:48,613
<i>That doesn't make very much sense,
does it?</i>

19
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:50,980
<i>How do I know that I can trust you</i>

20
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,317
<i>if you won't tell me
who gave you this number?</i>

21
00:03:56,528 --> 00:04:01,867
He said to say there's only one man
in the city who can do what you do.

22
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,041
He said, "That man is an expert.
That man is a professional."

23
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,128
And he said
you can never predict the future

24
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,507
and that maybe one day,
I may need that one man.

25
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,594
And that one man is you.

26
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,389
Where are you?

27
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:27,893
And what happened?

28
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,815
Okay. And you're sure?

29
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,193
All right.

30
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:41,198
Now, what I need you to do is gonna
be difficult, but you can do it, okay?

31
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:45,097
I need you to activate the
do-not-disturb light for your room

32
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:48,121
and then do absolutely nothing
till I get there. You understand?

33
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,835
Good. You're not to leave the room.
You're not to make any phone calls.

34
00:04:52,836 --> 00:04:55,608
You're not to touch anything.
You're not to answer the door.

35
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:58,382
You're not to pour yourself a drink
to steady your nerves.

36
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,634
You understand? Repeat that back to me.

37
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,890
Okay. That's great. You're doing great.
Yes, I'll be there as quickly as possible.

38
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,603
How will you know it's me?
This is how you'll know it's me.

39
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:19,570
Everything's gonna be fine.
I'll be there before you know it.

40
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,905
Co-Come in.

41
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,199
- Did you talk to anyone?
- No.

42
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,075
- Call anyone?
- No. No one.

43
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,744
Text? Any kind of communication at all?

44
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,163
No. Nothing.
I sat there just like you said.

45
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,417
Okay. Good.
You can pour yourself that drink now.

46
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,419
Oh. Yeah. A-Any kind?

47
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,378
Strong is probably best.

48
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,423
Okay. Do you want something?

49
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,342
Thanks, no.

50
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,846
- Does anybody know you're here?
- I don't think so, no.

51
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,975
- You don't think so?
- No. No one knows I'm here.

52
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:38,976
What about the room?

53
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,104
Did anyone recognize you
when you checked in?

54
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:43,315
No. I used an alias. I always do.

55
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,735
I mean, anytime I get a hotel room.
Not when I'm...

56
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,196
I understand. That's good.

57
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,136
I got the room right after I met...

58
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:54,368
I made him wait by the elevator
so no one would...

59
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:56,954
I don't do this.

60
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:59,539
This isn't something I do.

61
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,707
All right, listen.
I want you to look at the time.

62
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,962
Is there anyone that would be concerned
that they haven't heard from you yet?

63
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:06,421
- Oh, God. I don't kn...
- Think.

64
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:10,175
Uh, n-no.
I generally go and do as I please.

65
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,301
Good. I understand.

66
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:17,266
- And you can make all of this go away?
- That's why you called me.

67
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,206
- He was jumping on the bed.
- Mmm.

68
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:23,272
And he fell and crashed into the glass.

69
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,690
This would be the end.

70
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,109
- Everything I've worked so hard to build.
- Okay.

71
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,404
And we're on the verge
of doing something truly important.

72
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,074
All right. We don't have time for that.
We don't have much time at all.

73
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:36,618
It wasn't my fault. I didn't do anything...

74
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:39,162
None of it matters.
It doesn't matter, okay?

75
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,581
No, no. You listen to me.

76
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:45,752
You need to know this.
I didn't do anything. We were...

77
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:47,712
If you weren't here right now,
where would you be?

78
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:49,818
What? What do you mean?

79
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:51,091
If this was a normal night,

80
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,177
and you weren't
in a $10,000 penthouse suite

81
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:57,431
with a dead prostitute face down
in a pool of blood and broken glass,

82
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:58,598
where would you be?

83
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,017
He was not a prostitute.

84
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:07,691
Home. I would be home working,
watching TV with my daughter...

85
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:10,277
Okay. Good.
That's where I want you to be now.

86
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,028
- Okay.
- Okay.

87
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,449
You're home. You're sitting on the couch.
What's your daughter's name?

88
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,908
I have two daughters.

89
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:19,327
Julia. That's who I would...

90
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,747
All right. You're watching TV with Julia.

91
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:23,539
Okay.

92
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,251
I will make sure that none of this
gets traced back to you in any way.

93
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:28,962
Like it never happened. Whatever it takes.
No matter what.

94
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,506
Thank you.

95
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,174
That's the job.

96
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,597
When I was given your number,
I thought it was a joke.

97
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,725
I didn't know
people like you really existed.

98
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,645
They don't.
There's nobody who can do what I do.

99
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,791
What was that?

100
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,240
- Say, "Hello."
- What?

101
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,468
- Say, "Hello."
- Hello.

102
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,532
Louder.

103
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:19,720
Hello?

104
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,140
No service, please. Thank you.

105
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:55,674
Mmm.

106
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:58,760
Can I help you?

107
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,680
I don't think so, no.

108
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,562
Who are you?

109
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:12,983
I'm here to take care of your problem.
Who is he?

110
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:14,902
I called him.

111
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:16,235
Ah.

112
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,404
Who called you?

113
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,423
Son of a bitch.

114
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,594
Hmm.

115
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:44,973
W-What's going on?

116
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,811
Yeah.

117
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,398
Got it.

118
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:58,779
He does. I know. It's weird. Okay.

119
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,619
What?

120
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,207
Hello? Who is this?

121
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,506
Oh. Oh. Okay.

122
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,429
Okay. Yes.

123
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,506
Mm-hmm. I completely
understand. And I have no doubt

124
00:13:39,507 --> 00:13:42,531
that we can come to some
sort of agreement that satisfies us both.

125
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,703
Well, I hardly think you're
in a position to be negotiating anything.

126
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:50,789
Uh-huh.

127
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:54,959
Fair point. That is a fair point.

128
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,922
- So, tell me, what would you suggest?
<i>- ...illegal camera up there?</i>

129
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,549
Got a hidden fucking camera.
That's illegal surveillance.

130
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,760
That's a class D felony in
the state of New York. A class D felony.

131
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,848
You're more than welcome to leave, sir.
Your services are no longer required.

132
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:09,265
Come on.

133
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,933
What's the play here?

134
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,187
I don't know
what you're talking about, sir.

135
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,484
What?

136
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,864
You did check to see if...

137
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,200
Okay, you're on speaker.

138
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,203
<i>Hello? Are the men there?</i>

139
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:30,286
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

140
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,330
- Yes, they're here.
<i>- Wonderful.</i>

141
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:35,792
<i>Now then, we clearly have a situation
here, and time's of the essence.</i>

142
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,669
<i>So, I'm not going to mince words.</i>

143
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,545
<i>My name is Pamela Dowd-Herdry.</i>

144
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,881
<i>This is my hotel. It's very new.</i>

145
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,008
<i>It's very expensive, and I have a clear,</i>

146
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,199
<i>vested interest in minimizing any sort
of controversy associated with it.</i>

147
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,389
<i>I am very aware of the stigma
that can become attached to a building,</i>

148
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,645
<i>and I'm not interested in being the owner
of a hotel where a district attorney,</i>

149
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:57,460
<i>whom I greatly admire
and whose work I believe in very much,</i>

150
00:14:57,461 --> 00:15:00,274
<i>- was found with a dead prostitute.</i>
- He wasn't...

151
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,401
<i>So that being said,
I have brought in someone I know</i>

152
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,779
<i>through a trusted friend
to take care of this problem.</i>

153
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,156
<i>He is an expert.
He is the very best there is.</i>

154
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:11,453
<i>There is, quite simply, no one else
out there who can do what he does.</i>

155
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,704
Thank you, Pam.

156
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,791
<i>Now, of course, my guest
has her own interests at stake as well</i>

157
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,544
<i>and feels the need to make sure those
interests are protected,</i>

158
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:23,382
<i>which is why she has insisted on
maintaining her own person...</i>

159
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:25,884
- Mmm.
<i>- ...to ensure this problem goes away.</i>

160
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:27,426
<i>And as we have reached an impasse</i>

161
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,930
<i>as to whose man would be better suited
to accomplish the task,</i>

162
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,685
<i>we have decided that the only course
of action is for you both to work together</i>

163
00:15:34,686 --> 00:15:38,188
<i>to clean up this
absolute fucking clusterfuck of a mess.</i>

164
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:45,529
<i>Hello?</i>

165
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,155
No.

166
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,702
Pam, I'd like to have a word.

167
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,038
- Please, wait. Please.
- No. No.

168
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,080
Wait a minute.

169
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,456
You're joking, right? This a joke.

170
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,792
- You can't just leave.
- This is not how I work.

171
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,421
- How do I know I can trust him? I don't...
- Know this guy.

172
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,737
Well, sure, maybe.
Or maybe he's just some knucklehead.

173
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:09,260
You don't know me.
How do you know you can trust me?

174
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,972
I don't, but I trust the man
who gave me your number because...

175
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:13,097
Careful.

176
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,809
Because when he says something, it has
value, and he said I could trust you.

177
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,603
Well, Pam, I don't see how
that has anything to do with me, does it?

178
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:21,648
Are you appealing to my sense of honor?
Because that's not how this works.

179
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,316
This is not how I work.

180
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:26,361
He said if you take the job,
you give your word.

181
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:28,197
And that word's the measure of a man.

182
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:30,866
Not like this.

183
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,161
You're on those tapes too.

184
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,329
Forget about me.

185
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,958
If you... If you don't finish the job,
she's got you on camera.

186
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:46,715
Pa...

187
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,594
I know you can see me.

188
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:52,596
Fine.

189
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,940
The feeling's mutual.

190
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,443
Okay.

191
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:08,402
So, now what?

192
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,803
- Well, I need to know...
- Well, the first thing I need t...

193
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,790
I-I need to know
everything you did tonight.

194
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,374
Starting from when?

195
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,002
Starting from when things
went from a normal night to this.

196
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:25,878
- Sit down.
- Oh.

197
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,840
All right.

198
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:32,176
Uh, I was at an event a few blocks away.

199
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:35,514
After it was over, I wanted a drink.
I like the bar here.

200
00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:36,848
I had just walked in

201
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:41,979
and was headed for the ladies' room
when this kid started talking to me.

202
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,482
H-He was funny, and he was charming,
and he was so out of place.

203
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:49,945
And I just said, you know,
"Do you wanna get a room?"

204
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:53,866
It was a... sort of a joke, sort of not.

205
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:56,075
- Mmm.
- He said, "Sure."

206
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,786
- And you never met him before?
- No.

207
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:59,580
- No one saw you together?
- No.

208
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:00,955
And then you came upstairs.

209
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,916
I don't understand
why you need to know all this.

210
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,877
Because I need to know
what I need to make disappear.

211
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:06,420
- We.
- What?

212
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:07,796
We need to know.

213
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,968
- So, you came upstairs.
- We were drinking and fooling around...

214
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:14,886
Excuse me.
When exactly did you get the room?

215
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:17,681
- Before I came upstairs.
- Before she came upstairs.

216
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,287
Before you met the kid
or after you met the kid?

217
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:22,612
After I met the kid.
Before I came upstairs.

218
00:18:22,613 --> 00:18:24,938
O-Okay, thank you. I didn't know. Proceed.

219
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,857
So, you were drinking and fooling around.

220
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:31,320
- Was there ever a discussion of money?
- He's not a prostitute.

221
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:33,864
No. Hey! I already... God.

222
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,993
This is already fucking embarrassing
and humiliating enough as it is.

223
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:40,495
I don't understand
why I have to answer everything twice.

224
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:42,288
You don't have to answer everything twice.

225
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,082
You might have to
answer a few things twice.

226
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,208
Jesus Christ, will you...

227
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,920
Jesus Christ, do I know
what the two of you have spoken about?

228
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:49,922
No, I do not.
I am trying to get up to speed.

229
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:51,839
So you brought this 20-something...

230
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,758
...non-prostitute
up to your room.

231
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,531
You began drinking, fooling around, and...

232
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:57,304
He goes into the bathroom,
and he comes out,

233
00:18:57,305 --> 00:18:58,888
he starts jumping up on the fucking bed,

234
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,975
and he falls backwards onto the
fucking bar cart, and fucking drops dead.

235
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,109
Is there anyone who might be concerned
they haven't heard from you tonight?

236
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,781
Gonna get cleaned up.

237
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:19,076
Gonna take your things,
and you're gonna leave.

238
00:19:19,077 --> 00:19:20,618
Uh, I'm covered in blood.

239
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,996
You're gonna go home,
and you're gonna see your family,

240
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:24,665
act like nothing ever happened.

241
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,459
What?

242
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,880
Um, did you by chance...

243
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,495
So, you'll be in touch to coordinate the,
uh...

244
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:07,291
Don't worry about it.
That time will come, but not now.

245
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,960
And what exactly will happen to him?

246
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:12,004
To who?

247
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:13,839
Right.

248
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,634
Okay.

249
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,275
Hey, sweetie, did you eat?

250
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,528
I'm on my way home.
I can pick up some food.

251
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,878
- What are you doing?
- Mmm.

252
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,215
You know, I was giving you
the benefit of the doubt,

253
00:21:38,216 --> 00:21:40,384
letting you clean up unsupervised.

254
00:21:40,385 --> 00:21:42,553
Unsupervised? Wow, that's an honor.

255
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,722
I think you have
a fundamental misunderstanding

256
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:47,224
of what is happening here.

257
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:48,641
- Do I?
- Yes.

258
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,810
I wanna finish the job and go home.

259
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:54,189
Mmm. And that is where
there is a fundamental misunderstanding.

260
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,232
Mmm. Enlighten me.

261
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,234
Well, your job is to make sure that

262
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:01,529
that mess behind you
cannot be traced back to your client,

263
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,784
and to do that, you have to make sure that
that mess disappears completely.

264
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:07,702
As if it never happened. Difficult.

265
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:09,829
- For you, maybe.
- Well, that's irrelevant.

266
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,957
Because my job is
to make sure that you do your job

267
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,086
so that that mess
cannot be traced back to this hotel.

268
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:17,838
Less difficult.

269
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:21,717
So, you're just gonna sit there
and slurp your soda?

270
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:22,843
I'm going to...

271
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:26,013
supervise.

272
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,725
Fuck you.

273
00:22:29,726 --> 00:22:31,101
Mmm.

274
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:37,816
Just don't touch anything.

275
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,707
You're gonna get blood on your sweater.

276
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,251
I won't get blood on my sweater.

277
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:43,298
Thanks.

278
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:53,559
Dump the body.
Finish the job. Supervise.

279
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,111
Oh, shit.

280
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,121
I told you not to touch anything.

281
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:13,387
Oh, shit.

282
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,265
Mmm.

283
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,785
It's gonna be a long fucking night.

284
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,582
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
I don't understand.</i>

285
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,585
<i>Why can't you simply
dispose of the drugs as well?</i>

286
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,839
- Cops find a dead kid in the park...
- There's zero reason why a kid...

287
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,340
- ...overdosed...
- ...like that would be walking around...

288
00:25:48,341 --> 00:25:49,842
- ...they're asking questions.
- ...with this much product...

289
00:25:49,843 --> 00:25:51,050
which means it's probably stolen.

290
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:54,262
So, whoever it does belong to
will be looking for it. In my experience,

291
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:57,474
it's not the kind of people you want
knocking on the door of your hotel!

292
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,561
<i>I have no clue what
either one of you just said.</i>

293
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:05,607
<i>It strikes me that whoever those belong to
is going to wonder what happened to them.</i>

294
00:26:05,608 --> 00:26:08,067
<i>I don't want whoever that is
showing up here,</i>

295
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,944
<i>and I certainly don't want to
take responsibility</i>

296
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:13,282
<i>for throwing their product into the river
or turning it over to the police.</i>

297
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:14,991
<i>So this is what you'll do.</i>

298
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:17,326
<i>You'll find out who those drugs belong to,</i>

299
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,104
<i>and you'll return them.</i>

300
00:26:19,105 --> 00:26:20,882
- Uh, no...
- Look, Pam, it's not...

301
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,293
It's not that simple.

302
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:39,265
- Could've been a tracker in there.
- Tracker.

303
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:41,466
You don't think they'd already
be here if there was a...

304
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,524
How the hell are we gonna
figure out who this belongs to?

305
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,610
Body first, then the drugs.

306
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:52,196
- Listen, if I were you, I'd...
- You're not.

307
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,574
Hey, I don't want this to take all night.

308
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:56,658
It won't.

309
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:58,659
Okay then, so...

310
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,205
Oh, now you wanna get involved? Fuck you.

311
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:03,039
Hey, you wanna help?

312
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,001
Why don't you call your boss
and have her clear out the parking garage?

313
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:08,045
We can take the body down in the tarp.

314
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:10,087
You're joking.

315
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,925
You have to clean the surveillance anyway.
No one's gonna see it.

316
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:15,511
Oh, I get it.

317
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,222
- What?
- Nothing.

318
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:21,934
Just lucky for you, I'm here,
otherwise you're caught.

319
00:27:21,935 --> 00:27:23,602
- I get it.
- I'm trying to save time.

320
00:27:23,603 --> 00:27:25,374
No, it's okay. You don't have to explain.

321
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:27,147
You can't do it. I'm gonna help you out.

322
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:28,732
- I can do it.
- Really?

323
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,316
- Yeah, really.
- So do it.

324
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,402
Maybe I don't want you to see how I do it.

325
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,071
Whatever you say.

326
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:38,075
Hey... ...you know what?
Don't call your boss. Don't call.

327
00:27:38,076 --> 00:27:41,870
Fuck it. Like I need your fucking help.

328
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:43,455
Okay, I'll fucking do it.

329
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:43,056
Well, that's one way to do it.

330
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:49,563
Looks like a dead body on a luggage cart.

331
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,690
I'm not finished yet.

332
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:54,192
Huh.

333
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,324
Here's a lesson.

334
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:04,244
You don't have to help.
I don't need you to help...

335
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:07,623
- Hmm.
- ...but if you do, it'll go faster.

336
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,210
I am enjoying the show.

337
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,530
Thanks.

338
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:41,906
Happy to help.

339
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:43,283
- Dick.
- Putz.

340
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:53,252
Wait.

341
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:56,170
What?

342
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,882
The parking garage is on
a different security system.

343
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,843
You're an asshole.

344
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,512
I just wanted to see
how an old man would do it,

345
00:30:03,513 --> 00:30:05,180
but your secret's safe with me.

346
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:09,142
It's the red one.

347
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:17,109
What?

348
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:21,238
Hmm.

349
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:32,040
That should buy you an extra five.

350
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:41,592
I don't need an extra fucking five.

351
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:55,314
I have a fob.

352
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,559
I have a fob.

353
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,025
Just don't interfere.

354
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:44,808
The old cone in the gate?

355
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:46,591
Another trade secret?

356
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,010
Let's wipe the tapes and go.

357
00:32:48,011 --> 00:32:49,677
- No.
- No?

358
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:50,887
Although I am curious to see

359
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:53,724
how you would've navigated
this next situation without me,

360
00:32:53,725 --> 00:32:55,684
I'm afraid I have to do this one alone.

361
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:57,643
- Excuse me?
- I will wipe the tapes.

362
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:00,189
- I just can't let you watch.
- Yeah. This is a two-way street.

363
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,066
I was told specifically
to make sure you do not see this.

364
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:04,984
By who? Your boss?

365
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:06,569
She doesn't want you back there.

366
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,614
You got hidden cameras
in a brand-new, luxury hotel.

367
00:33:08,615 --> 00:33:10,156
What kind of a scam are you running here?

368
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:11,992
- You're not going back there.
- Really? Why?

369
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:14,411
What are you hiding? Who are you exactly?

370
00:33:14,412 --> 00:33:16,580
Who am I? Fuck you, who am I. Who are you?

371
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:18,749
- Some old bagman? Some old cleaner?
- Yeah.

372
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,208
I'm not letting you in there.

373
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:22,878
That's some big talk
coming from a hotel policeman.

374
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:24,670
Big talk coming from the A/V club.

375
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,757
I'm on those tapes
and I'm not leaving until I'm not.

376
00:33:26,758 --> 00:33:28,382
No one gives a shit
if you're on those tapes.

377
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:29,635
How do you and I know
it's not some kind of a setup?

378
00:33:29,636 --> 00:33:31,595
- Oh, please.
- How?

379
00:33:31,596 --> 00:33:32,678
Setup, how?

380
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:35,015
Maybe your boss
brought that kid here on purpose.

381
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:36,641
- Go on.
- Yeah.

382
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:38,893
Maybe she brought him
'cause she knows he's got drugs.

383
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:41,230
Or she gave him the drugs,
and she's setting both of them up.

384
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:42,480
They're having a good time,

385
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:44,482
they're drinking,
they're laughing, all of that.

386
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:47,736
But she wants him to overdose,
and she's got it on tape.

387
00:33:47,737 --> 00:33:48,861
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

388
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,279
Then she makes a deal with my boss

389
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,658
to clean the whole thing up
like it never happened.

390
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:54,576
But she keeps the tape.

391
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:57,162
For what?

392
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:00,811
- For leverage, you dumbass.
- Leverage for what, dipshit?

393
00:34:00,812 --> 00:34:03,168
- You tell me, asshole.
- That makes no fucking sense.

394
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:04,628
- You've seen too many movies.
- Fucking putz.

395
00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:06,046
Oh, I...

396
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:10,508
- Shit.
- Fuck.

397
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:15,639
- Shit.
- Fuck.

398
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:23,980
You okay?

399
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:25,607
- All good.
- Yep.

400
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,869
That doesn't make sense,
he wasn't breathing.

401
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:46,169
You didn't check his pulse?

402
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,422
Fuck you, I didn't check his pulse.
He didn't have a fucking pulse.

403
00:34:48,423 --> 00:34:49,379
And yet...

404
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,465
And yet you didn't check his pulse,
you didn't ask.

405
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:54,469
- It's the first thing you do.
- He didn't have a fucking pulse.

406
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,387
- And yet...
- And yet, you didn't ask.

407
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:59,016
- You didn't say, "Is he dead?"
- I didn't think I had to.

408
00:34:59,017 --> 00:35:00,474
You think I didn't check his pulse?

409
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:03,020
No, I do not. I think you got rattled.
I think you forgot.

410
00:35:03,021 --> 00:35:04,333
Bush-league is what you are.

411
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:05,646
You walk into a situation,

412
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:07,232
you see two people standing there,
one on the floor.

413
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:08,900
You don't ask, "Does he have a pulse?"

414
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:12,154
You don't ask, "Is he dead?"
You check for yourself.

415
00:35:12,155 --> 00:35:13,906
- Thank you, sensei.
- Yeah.

416
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:16,908
I mean, maybe it was the drugs.
I don't know.

417
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:20,204
Oh, that's just lazy bullshit.
It doesn't work that way.

418
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:21,517
Well, he's not dead.

419
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:23,091
It would appear not.

420
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:27,753
- Just admit you didn't check.
- Oh, just shut up. I'm trying to think.

421
00:35:27,754 --> 00:35:29,170
Oh, it was a magic drug

422
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:32,591
- that makes your heartbeat so slow...
- Would you shut the fuck up?

423
00:35:32,592 --> 00:35:33,884
It doesn't matter.

424
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:37,429
This is a different thing now.

425
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,187
Wait, this is great.

426
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:51,527
Think about it. He's gotta know.

427
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:55,405
We need to go. We need to hurry.

428
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:56,822
It's not a guarantee.

429
00:35:56,823 --> 00:36:01,286
I know, but we need to go now
before his brain turns into applesauce.

430
00:36:01,287 --> 00:36:02,745
Brain probably already is applesauce.

431
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,540
Listen, I don't wanna
have to go door-to-door

432
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:05,957
like some fucking Jehovah's Witness

433
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:09,169
trying to return four fucking bricks of
God-knows-what-did-that-to-him, do you?

434
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,297
- Was that your plan?
- I'm trying to make a point.

435
00:36:12,298 --> 00:36:13,632
It is worth a shot.

436
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:15,508
I agree.

437
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:17,636
Okay, then. I know someone.

438
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,763
Fuck no.

439
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,641
- What? My guy's good.
- Fuck your guy. Some bullet puller.

440
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:26,019
- The only way that'd go is sideways.
- Fuck you. We're using my guy.

441
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,397
It only works with my guy. It's exclusive.

442
00:36:28,398 --> 00:36:30,274
My car, my guy. Fuck you.

443
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,236
Fucking...

444
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:40,659
And?

445
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:46,206
Didn't pick up. Where we going?

446
00:36:46,207 --> 00:36:47,290
Chinatown.

447
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,168
Take a right out of the exit
and that'll take you...

448
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:51,295
- I know how to get to Chinatown.
- Mm-hmm.

449
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:41,010
- The Albanians.
- What?

450
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:43,514
The Albanians had this thing a while back.

451
00:37:43,515 --> 00:37:44,597
Yeah, I know.

452
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:46,933
Massive shipment of pure, uncut heroin

453
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:49,394
en route from Europe
suddenly just disappears.

454
00:37:49,395 --> 00:37:50,353
I know.

455
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:52,084
You think those bricks
came from their shipment?

456
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:53,814
- You should just take them back yourself.
- No.

457
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:56,568
I'm not interested in being murdered,
is what I'm saying.

458
00:37:56,569 --> 00:37:57,985
The Albanians will kill

459
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:01,281
and have killed anybody they even suspect
of stealing that shipment.

460
00:38:01,282 --> 00:38:04,535
So, whoever did it, sends this kid in
to be a honeypot

461
00:38:04,536 --> 00:38:07,495
to seduce my client
to get some political flex,

462
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:12,209
to crack down on the Albanians to
clear the playing field to sell the drugs.

463
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,336
So, they send in
the kid with the backpack.

464
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:17,548
They want him to take the drugs,
they want him to overdose,

465
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:18,882
and...

466
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:25,264
No, it doesn't work.

467
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:30,143
Keep at it. You'll crack it eventually.

468
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:13,103
Left on Division.

469
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:39,129
I gotta clear you first.

470
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:41,965
Okay.

471
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:45,469
- Can't just waltz up there with a guy...
- Okay.

472
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:24,800
<i>Nope, not tonight.</i>

473
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:25,883
It's not about that.

474
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:27,260
<i>I'm sure it's not.</i>

475
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:29,721
Come on, really.
This is real. I need help.

476
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:31,765
<i>What kind of help?</i>

477
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:34,101
Well...

478
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:55,414
So, um, yeah.

479
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:57,875
<i>Hold on, I'm coming down.</i>

480
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:13,974
What happens to the kid after he talks?

481
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:16,476
If he talks, my job's done.

482
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:18,395
So, this other guy kills him?

483
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:32,104
- Do you vouch for him?
- He's been all right.

484
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:35,370
I'm not gonna vouch for him.
I... You know, can't go that far.

485
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:37,246
He's like... You know...

486
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:39,436
He's like one of those guys, you know?

487
00:41:39,437 --> 00:41:41,626
No, I-I don't know. One of what guys?

488
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:44,170
One of those guys
who thinks he's, like, some genius.

489
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:47,027
- Got it all figured out, you know?
- Yeah, I'm familiar with that type.

490
00:41:47,028 --> 00:41:49,885
I don't wanna fix this kid up
just so you can put a bullet in his...

491
00:41:49,886 --> 00:41:52,596
He's had his moment, you know,
where he was the go-to guy,

492
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:55,244
the hot-shit guy,
but that wore off a long time ago,

493
00:41:55,245 --> 00:41:57,893
and no one's told him yet.

494
00:41:57,894 --> 00:42:00,019
Probably lives in
a single-bedroom apartment,

495
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,899
watching old black-and-white movies till
he falls asleep 'cause he's so lonely.

496
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:05,859
Hello, June.

497
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:14,116
Hello.

498
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:16,370
You didn't pick up.

499
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:18,372
- I know.
- Mmm.

500
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:20,748
Is there really a kid in your trunk?

501
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:22,793
- How long have you two been...
- Not what you think.

502
00:42:22,794 --> 00:42:24,586
You told him it was exclusive.

503
00:42:24,587 --> 00:42:25,586
Oh, are there more?

504
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:28,882
Is there an OD'ing kid in your trunk?
Because if there is, then this...

505
00:42:28,883 --> 00:42:29,925
- Was he before me?
- Yes.

506
00:42:29,926 --> 00:42:31,322
- Yes?
- Yes?

507
00:42:31,323 --> 00:42:32,718
- No. Yes?
- Yes.

508
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,265
Then can we take care of the OD'ing kid
first, you fucking lunatics?

509
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:40,769
Hmm.

510
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:44,856
You need to be careful.
Both of you need to be.

511
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:47,568
There are people out there.
If they saw you two together, I...

512
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:49,194
You said it was exclusive.

513
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,697
What? You did!

514
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,354
Shit.

515
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:30,110
Come on, bring him in here.

516
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:35,741
- And careful of your back.
- Yep.

517
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:39,995
All right. On three. You ready?

518
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:44,208
Wait. One, two, three, right?
Not one, two, three, go?

519
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,960
- Of course not.
- Good.

520
00:43:47,586 --> 00:43:49,755
One, two, three.

521
00:43:57,554 --> 00:43:59,013
Do you know what he took?

522
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:00,474
- No.
- I'm not sure.

523
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:04,019
Well, it must have been
some bad combination

524
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,939
or something extremely pure.

525
00:44:07,773 --> 00:44:09,858
God, it's like he doesn't even
have a heartbeat.

526
00:44:10,526 --> 00:44:12,569
I know a lot of paramedics
would have called him.

527
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,403
Oh, really?

528
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:16,635
- We just need him to talk.
- Let me get this straight.

529
00:44:16,636 --> 00:44:19,023
You're saying it's like
he took some kind of a magic drug?

530
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:21,411
- So, how many...
- Makes your heartbeat so slow that...

531
00:44:21,412 --> 00:44:23,497
How many clowns
you got running through this joint?

532
00:44:23,498 --> 00:44:25,498
Now is... It's really not the time.

533
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:28,460
- Why didn't you pick up when I called?
- Okay, both of you out. Now.

534
00:44:30,713 --> 00:44:31,879
Out.

535
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:29,855
Did you know?

536
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:34,318
I had my suspicions.

537
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:35,776
Yeah.

538
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:39,156
Never saw anyone,
never heard anything, so I didn't ask.

539
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:42,868
If it makes you feel any better,
she is the best.

540
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:45,870
Sure.

541
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:52,586
My first guy, I came in to get
a bullet pulled out of my side,

542
00:45:52,587 --> 00:45:54,046
and he wants to put me under.

543
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:55,964
I said, "Fuck no."

544
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,091
Come to find out,

545
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:01,136
he's taking people's kidneys
without asking them.

546
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:03,888
People are waking up and thinking,

547
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:07,267
"Hey, that's a big scar
for getting a bullet pulled."

548
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,271
She saved my life.

549
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:13,272
No kidding.

550
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:15,504
Yeah. Shrapnel, inch away from my spine.

551
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:17,736
Spent two weeks
in the basement recovering.

552
00:46:19,613 --> 00:46:20,656
Back in October?

553
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:24,023
Maybe. How would you know that?

554
00:46:25,244 --> 00:46:26,411
I was here.

555
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:28,372
Come on.

556
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:31,542
I was wondering why
she didn't let me near the cellar.

557
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,170
- She is the best.
- She is.

558
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:40,092
I guess I knew it wasn't exclusive.

559
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:42,719
- What are the odds?
- Right?

560
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:47,140
Both of us sleeping with
the same Chinatown doctor.

561
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,730
Oh, were you... you two not...

562
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:02,030
Stop him!

563
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:22,718
Go right at the...

564
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:55,250
- Take the...
- I know.

565
00:48:50,514 --> 00:48:51,974
- Hello.
- Mm-hmm.

566
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:25,734
Come back here!

567
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:37,329
Stop running!

568
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,520
Ow.

569
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:08,651
Shit.

570
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:19,413
Ow.

571
00:52:24,603 --> 00:52:27,397
Whoa.

572
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:39,743
Fuck!

573
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,561
Get in the car.

574
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:11,316
Fucker.

575
00:53:11,317 --> 00:53:14,278
Hey, asshole! What are you doing?

576
00:53:14,279 --> 00:53:15,383
Come on.

577
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:24,621
Who are you guys?

578
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:30,877
<i>No!</i>

579
00:53:30,878 --> 00:53:33,297
- Come on. We just need to...
<i>- No!</i>

580
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:43,765
Hey! Dum-dums!

581
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:46,977
Uh, catch.

582
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:49,896
Take two of the big ones
every couple of hours

583
00:53:49,897 --> 00:53:54,026
and one of the small ones every six.
And lots of water.

584
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:58,530
Also, I'm not sleeping with him.
He's just fucking with you.

585
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:04,077
Yeah. I was just fucking with you.

586
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:29,019
No.

587
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:31,855
- Come on. You got a place.
- Maybe I do.

588
00:54:31,856 --> 00:54:34,233
Of course you do.

589
00:54:34,234 --> 00:54:35,317
Knock it off!

590
00:54:36,068 --> 00:54:37,819
- You know what you sound like?
- What?

591
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:41,194
You sound like a guy who's got a place.

592
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:44,888
You got a place. Let's go to your place.

593
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:47,412
- We're not going to my place.
- Why not?

594
00:54:47,413 --> 00:54:49,122
That's the point of having a place.

595
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:52,125
Exactly.

596
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:18,735
Okay.

597
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:24,116
- What the fuck?
- Get dressed.

598
00:55:43,594 --> 00:55:44,595
Come on.

599
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:49,349
Come on.

600
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:07,034
<i>So that all those who
come to Christ may enter into his kingdom.</i>

601
00:56:07,035 --> 00:56:08,367
Need a room.

602
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:11,413
- Love Nest, Arabian Nights, or Safari?
- Excuse me?

603
00:56:13,624 --> 00:56:16,209
Love Nest, Arabian Nights, or Safari?

604
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,504
Love Nest, Arabian Nights
are three minimum.

605
00:56:18,505 --> 00:56:20,546
Safari I can do by the hour.

606
00:56:20,547 --> 00:56:23,884
<i>Into the family of God
and are sanctified.</i>

607
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:26,512
He's not a prostitute.

608
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:33,936
Sit down.

609
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:43,444
So, uh, how do you wanna do this?

610
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:45,780
'Cause I've never
really done it like this be...

611
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:47,990
I mean, I could start, I guess,
and then...

612
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:51,370
- Then I just jump in when it feels right.
- Yeah. Unless you wanna start and then...

613
00:56:51,371 --> 00:56:55,249
No, you go. You go. You got this.
I'll just, uh, follow your lead.

614
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,333
Mmm.

615
00:56:58,585 --> 00:57:00,420
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

616
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:09,972
- Where...
- So...

617
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:36,914
Hmm.

618
00:57:36,915 --> 00:57:38,208
Where'd you get the drugs?

619
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:42,003
I don't know what you're talking about.

620
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:44,089
Mm-hmm. Okay.

621
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:48,302
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I don't know.

622
00:57:48,927 --> 00:57:50,971
I don't know anything about any drugs.

623
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,475
- Where did you get the drugs?
- I don't...

624
00:57:56,977 --> 00:57:57,978
Talk, asshole.

625
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:01,690
Show him the rest.

626
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:05,444
Come on.

627
00:58:11,742 --> 00:58:12,743
Huh?

628
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:17,372
Now.

629
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:20,834
Those aren't mine.

630
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:24,381
Can I talk to you in the hall,
just for a minute?

631
00:58:32,638 --> 00:58:34,238
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

632
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:36,349
You asked the same thing three times.
I thought this could...

633
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:38,977
He didn't know we had the drugs.
He was panicked. We had leverage.

634
00:58:38,978 --> 00:58:40,686
He wasn't panicked.
He wasn't gonna say anything.

635
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:43,106
- You don't know that.
- How many times were you gonna ask?

636
00:58:43,107 --> 00:58:45,192
Ten times? Twenty time... Hey!

637
00:58:47,694 --> 00:58:49,904
You know, there's an art to this
you may not realize.

638
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:52,114
What, the art of saying
the same thing over and over?

639
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:55,285
- Okay. Well, let's see your technique.
- I'm not gonna show you my technique.

640
00:58:55,286 --> 00:58:56,912
- Because you don't have a technique.
- No.

641
00:58:56,913 --> 00:58:58,413
No? Then why?

642
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:00,874
Because you'll steal it.

643
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:04,711
- I'll steal it? You think I'll steal it?
- There you go, repeating again.

644
00:59:04,712 --> 00:59:06,462
You don't have a technique.

645
00:59:06,463 --> 00:59:07,964
I do, and it involves a little bit more

646
00:59:07,965 --> 00:59:09,925
than saying the same
thing over and over again.

647
00:59:12,636 --> 00:59:14,054
I showed you my luggage cart trick.

648
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:17,975
- You didn't show me. I saw it.
- Yeah, but you liked it. You'll use it.

649
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:22,521
- Maybe.
- Mmm. Come on. Admit it. It was cool.

650
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,440
- Okay, fine. It was very cool.
- Yeah, it's cool.

651
00:59:28,861 --> 00:59:30,320
So, what's the next move here?

652
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:32,990
Can't we just get to it?

653
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,282
What do you mean?

654
00:59:34,283 --> 00:59:36,076
Like, I don't wanna be here.

655
00:59:36,077 --> 00:59:38,995
Hmm. You miss your place?

656
00:59:38,996 --> 00:59:42,249
I feel like I'm getting syphilis just
standing here. Let's just get to it.

657
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:44,835
- Really?
- Why not?

658
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:47,838
Hmm. Let's get to it.

659
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,214
Great.

660
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:52,383
Where'd you get the fucking drugs?

661
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:54,261
- ...the fucking drugs, you asshole?
- Lagrange!

662
00:59:54,262 --> 00:59:55,721
They call him Lagrange!

663
00:59:55,722 --> 00:59:57,014
Lagrange?

664
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,726
- What about him?
- They're his... or they were... the drugs.

665
01:00:00,727 --> 01:00:03,352
- Bullshit. How?
- How? What do you mean? How-How what?

666
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:05,564
How does someone like you
get involved with one of the biggest

667
01:00:05,565 --> 01:00:06,939
- drug runners in the city?
- Yeah.

668
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,152
Well... So, I'm not a prostitute, okay.
That's n... That's not what's happening.

669
01:00:10,153 --> 01:00:11,235
How did you get the drugs?

670
01:00:11,236 --> 01:00:16,033
Fuck you! I'm fucking trying to explain.
Just let me explain. Let me explain, okay?

671
01:00:16,034 --> 01:00:19,119
Can I get a glass of water?

672
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:25,334
- I mean, she did say hydrate.
- Yeah, I know. I...

673
01:00:25,335 --> 01:00:27,961
Fine. Fine. Fuck it.

674
01:00:27,962 --> 01:00:29,046
Thank you.

675
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:30,713
Yeah.

676
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:33,300
Ugh.

677
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,322
Thank you.

678
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:58,116
Mmm.

679
01:00:58,117 --> 01:00:59,763
Mmm.

680
01:00:59,764 --> 01:01:01,411
Oh, boy.

681
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:04,748
Oh, my goodness.

682
01:01:04,749 --> 01:01:06,834
Mmm.

683
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:08,794
Mmm.

684
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:18,011
Okay.

685
01:01:22,432 --> 01:01:23,432
So, I wake up...

686
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:25,727
Jesus Christ, kid. You woke up...
You gotta start the story there?

687
01:01:25,728 --> 01:01:27,395
- Just let him talk.
- I... Yeah.

688
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:29,147
It's not gonna make sense unless
I tell you the whole thing.

689
01:01:29,148 --> 01:01:30,669
So, you think
you need to add in the detail

690
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:32,191
that you woke up in case it wasn't clear?

691
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:35,404
- Yes, I do. It's how I started my day.
- That's how everyone starts their day!

692
01:01:35,405 --> 01:01:38,239
What he's saying is take a minute
to think about what's

693
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,909
the most important part of the story
and leave the rest out.

694
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:42,703
- Well, uh, I...
- Hey!

695
01:01:42,704 --> 01:01:44,246
Think about it.

696
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:47,541
Right. Um...

697
01:01:49,293 --> 01:01:51,878
Well, so I'm...
I'm-I'm-I'm... I'm getting up

698
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:54,902
and I'm... I'm getting out of bed and,
um... Uh...

699
01:01:54,903 --> 01:01:57,926
...you know, my room is a mess
and I'm-I'm... I'm not exactly hungover,

700
01:01:57,927 --> 01:02:00,554
but I'm still feeling a little bit... Shit!

701
01:02:00,555 --> 01:02:03,182
Fuck! Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Okay. I-I-I... Yes.

702
01:02:03,183 --> 01:02:04,974
- Oh, I leave my house and...
- No.

703
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:07,060
All right. Just let him
do the whole thing. He can't do it.

704
01:02:07,061 --> 01:02:09,250
- I... No, I can do it.
- No, you can't do it.

705
01:02:09,251 --> 01:02:12,576
- Yeah, I can.
- Just go fast, all right?

706
01:02:12,577 --> 01:02:15,903
- Okay. Yes. I, uh...
- Now, what the fuck happened?

707
01:02:15,904 --> 01:02:17,612
Yes. Okay. So, I'm, like...

708
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:20,406
I wasn't trying to make any
money or anything, like, be a drug dealer.

709
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:23,035
Like, I-I've been taking classes at Pace.
I've been trying to learn business.

710
01:02:23,036 --> 01:02:25,536
Some... Some business classes 'cause,
you know,

711
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:28,290
people are gonna try and fuck you with,
like, law and legal shit unless, you know,

712
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:30,125
you know how it works.
So, I'm taking these classes,

713
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:31,959
and there's this dude there and he's,
like, legit.

714
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,545
He is from some real shit but he's, like,
so smart also.

715
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:38,674
I mean he's, like, basically a genius
smart, and today his fucking mom died.

716
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:42,804
Like, he got this call in class
and his fucking mom was in the hospital,

717
01:02:42,805 --> 01:02:44,889
and she fucking died because they didn't,

718
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:47,267
like, give her the right medicine
or some shit.

719
01:02:47,268 --> 01:02:48,392
Like, they fucked up.

720
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:50,582
So I'm just like,
"Dude, whatever you need, dude."

721
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:52,887
And he, like, trusts me.
Like, we hang out and shit.

722
01:02:52,888 --> 01:02:55,192
And I told you he's legit,
like, no fucking around.

723
01:02:55,193 --> 01:02:56,817
So, he's like...

724
01:02:56,818 --> 01:02:59,363
he's like, "I'm supposed to do
this drop for my boss and now I can't."

725
01:02:59,364 --> 01:03:00,989
And I was like,
"Say no more, I will do it."

726
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:02,698
Like, I don't do this kind of shit.

727
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:06,807
So he gives me the shit and I'm like,
"Fuck, are you fucking serious?"

728
01:03:06,808 --> 01:03:10,915
But his mom just fucking died,
so I say, "Okay, dude. I'll do it."

729
01:03:10,916 --> 01:03:14,169
So I'm... I'm... I'm killing some time
before I get the address for the drop.

730
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:16,588
And I'll admit it,
I'm feeling pretty fucking cool,

731
01:03:16,589 --> 01:03:18,130
but also it's scary and shit,

732
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:20,633
and my heart's, like,
fucking pounding out of my chest.

733
01:03:20,634 --> 01:03:22,740
So I duck into this bar.
It's, like, this hotel bar,

734
01:03:22,741 --> 01:03:24,846
and I'm... I'm... I'm kind of
feeling myself 'cause,

735
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:27,558
like, I'm on some real shit,
and it's, like, people are noticing.

736
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:29,475
Like, girls are fucking noticing, like,

737
01:03:29,476 --> 01:03:31,394
I've got the fucking juice
all of a sudden.

738
01:03:31,395 --> 01:03:34,606
And it's, like... I didn't even, like,
take a shower this morning, you know?

739
01:03:34,607 --> 01:03:37,108
Like... Like I was trying to say before.

740
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:40,529
And it's, like, three fucking girls, they
just start talking to me, like, hot girls.

741
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:42,488
Like, I've got the fucking juice.

742
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:44,636
They're buying me drinks
and shit 'cause I'm broke.

743
01:03:44,637 --> 01:03:46,785
And then,
I'm coming out of the bathroom,

744
01:03:46,786 --> 01:03:48,452
and this older lady,
she's fucking hot too,

745
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:51,038
is straight up like,
"Do you wanna come up to my room?"

746
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,335
And I'm like, "Yes, yes, yes. Of course."
This is my life. Why not live it?

747
01:03:55,336 --> 01:03:58,255
And it's, like,
Diego's mom just fucking died,

748
01:03:58,256 --> 01:03:59,922
so I'm thinking about my life,

749
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:03,343
and I'm thinking about how
it could just all go away at any time.

750
01:04:03,344 --> 01:04:05,866
And so, we're partying
and I fucking... I fucking...

751
01:04:05,867 --> 01:04:08,389
I just wanted to see
what it was like, you know?

752
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:10,871
It's like there was magic in there
wrapped up in plastic,

753
01:04:10,872 --> 01:04:13,353
like, it was radiating out,
and I just wanted to try it.

754
01:04:13,354 --> 01:04:15,521
Just the tiniest amount
'cause it's, like...

755
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:17,983
Today was, like,
the first day that I ever felt cool.

756
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:19,672
Not that you guys would understand.

757
01:04:19,673 --> 01:04:21,601
You're, like,
the coolest guys I've ever seen.

758
01:04:21,602 --> 01:04:23,733
But I was so careful.
Like, I was so careful.

759
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,800
You would never know that I tried it,
but I did.

760
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:27,867
I did try it,
and it didn't make me feel cool.

761
01:04:27,868 --> 01:04:31,705
It just... I just... I just... I just,
like...

762
01:04:40,506 --> 01:04:41,507
Is that it?

763
01:04:44,468 --> 01:04:45,468
I think so, yeah.

764
01:04:45,469 --> 01:04:48,096
- Okay, then.
- What's the address for the drop?

765
01:04:48,097 --> 01:04:50,724
- I don't know.
- Where's your phone?

766
01:04:52,226 --> 01:04:53,310
Uh, I hid it.

767
01:04:54,102 --> 01:04:55,228
In the hotel?

768
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:57,272
- No, before I left.
- Why?

769
01:04:58,273 --> 01:05:01,463
In case something happened. I hid
my wallet too, in case I got picked up.

770
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:04,655
How were you gonna get the address of
the drop if you don't have your phone?

771
01:05:04,656 --> 01:05:06,239
The pager.

772
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,824
- Pager?
- Where's your pager?

773
01:05:08,825 --> 01:05:11,453
I don't have a pager.
What's this, like, the '90s?

774
01:05:11,454 --> 01:05:12,703
Who has the pager?

775
01:05:12,704 --> 01:05:14,414
- No one.
- No one has the pager?

776
01:05:14,415 --> 01:05:16,165
- No.
- Where is it?

777
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:18,126
Diego left it for me at his work.

778
01:05:18,127 --> 01:05:20,086
- Where?
- It's called Club Ice.

779
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:25,050
Used to be, uh, the something,
uh, Palazzo. Uh, I don't know.

780
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:26,593
He bartends there sometimes.

781
01:05:29,471 --> 01:05:32,224
This guy, Diego, why would he trust you?

782
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:37,896
I guess 'cause we're friends.

783
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:43,360
Do you guys...
You don't think it's too late?

784
01:05:45,737 --> 01:05:48,657
Early, late.
You took the job, you gave your word.

785
01:05:48,658 --> 01:05:49,992
You're gonna finish it.

786
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:53,745
Right.

787
01:06:00,919 --> 01:06:01,962
Are you guys seeing that?

788
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,368
How long have you both
worked together for?

789
01:06:37,289 --> 01:06:39,208
- A long time.
- I stopped counting.

790
01:06:39,209 --> 01:06:41,168
Really? Mmm.

791
01:06:42,044 --> 01:06:43,795
Well, yeah, you can tell.

792
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:48,717
- Is that so?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

793
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:51,386
Yeah, you got, like,
basically the same clothes,

794
01:06:52,137 --> 01:06:53,597
kinda talk the same, you know.

795
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:56,328
You're, like, basically the same guy.

796
01:07:01,313 --> 01:07:03,753
Hey, everything's gonna be okay, right,
after I make the drop?

797
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:07,694
'Cause I just...
I have a really big exam next week.

798
01:07:07,695 --> 01:07:09,362
I really don't wanna screw that up.

799
01:07:09,363 --> 01:07:11,031
You won't have to worry about that.

800
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:35,429
I'll be two seconds.

801
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:37,723
- You're hilarious.
- What? No, no. I wo... I won't run.

802
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:40,018
- Well, in that case...
- No, seriously. I can just go in.

803
01:07:40,019 --> 01:07:41,602
I'll get the pager. It'll be fine.

804
01:07:41,603 --> 01:07:43,689
All right? I promise.
I'm not gonna... What?

805
01:07:57,244 --> 01:07:58,620
Is that...

806
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:00,539
Croatian.

807
01:08:12,634 --> 01:08:14,394
Why you both looking
at each other like that?

808
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:17,014
You did that thing down in Gowanus,
didn't you?

809
01:08:17,015 --> 01:08:18,598
No. Why would you say that?

810
01:08:18,599 --> 01:08:20,724
I wondered why he didn't call me.
And when I heard

811
01:08:20,725 --> 01:08:23,437
- what a shit show that was...
- No, that wasn't a shit show.

812
01:08:23,438 --> 01:08:24,730
So you did do Gowanus?

813
01:08:24,731 --> 01:08:26,022
What is happening?

814
01:08:26,023 --> 01:08:27,703
Not sure what happened to the body though.

815
01:08:28,942 --> 01:08:32,404
You know that explosion
at the evidence warehouse in the Bronx?

816
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:34,656
You're kidding. That was you?

817
01:08:36,073 --> 01:08:37,282
Yeah.

818
01:08:37,283 --> 01:08:38,368
That was in October.

819
01:08:39,118 --> 01:08:41,037
- You were recovering at June's.
- Yeah.

820
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,999
Shit. She tried to warn me tonight.

821
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:48,001
She said there were people out there
who, if they saw us t...

822
01:08:48,002 --> 01:08:50,380
We need to get the pager.
Why can't we just go in and get the pager?

823
01:08:50,381 --> 01:08:52,380
- Because we can't.
- Why not?

824
01:08:52,381 --> 01:08:54,049
Is it 'cause of the drugs?
In case they're searching people?

825
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:56,009
'Cause one of you guys could
just wait in here with the drugs.

826
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:57,970
- I'm not leaving him with all the drugs.
- I'm not leaving him.

827
01:08:57,971 --> 01:08:59,348
You don't trust your own partner?

828
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:01,641
Where is it?

829
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:03,519
- What?
- The pager.

830
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,603
It's at the...

831
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:11,547
No. I'm not telling.

832
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:13,027
No fucking around, kid.

833
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:15,028
- Where is the pager?
- Tell me what's going on.

834
01:09:15,029 --> 01:09:16,615
- No. Where's the pager?
- Why can't you tell me?

835
01:09:16,616 --> 01:09:18,032
- We can't.
- Why not?

836
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:19,617
- Because we can't.
- Why?

837
01:09:19,618 --> 01:09:21,203
- Because we...
- 'Cause we're not partners.

838
01:09:22,205 --> 01:09:23,205
What?

839
01:09:23,997 --> 01:09:27,542
There is an expectation
of discretion in our line of work.

840
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:29,461
A kind of monasticism.

841
01:09:30,629 --> 01:09:32,005
At least the way I learned it.

842
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,633
Same.

843
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:40,389
When you hire someone to do what we do,

844
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:42,431
you want someone who works alone.

845
01:09:42,432 --> 01:09:45,059
No connections. No conflicting loyalties.

846
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,312
It's the only way you can be trusted,
is to trust no one.

847
01:09:47,313 --> 01:09:50,313
But in that building back there
is a very scary,

848
01:09:50,314 --> 01:09:56,238
very violent man who, it turns out,
we have both worked for in the past.

849
01:09:56,822 --> 01:09:59,575
- And if he saw us together...
- If he even suspected

850
01:09:59,576 --> 01:10:00,784
I knew what he knew...

851
01:10:00,785 --> 01:10:01,993
And I knew what he knew.

852
01:10:01,994 --> 01:10:05,622
Then he would, without hesitation,
have us killed immediately.

853
01:10:05,623 --> 01:10:06,832
Or he'd kill us himself.

854
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:09,585
So you're secret partners?

855
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:13,255
- We're not secret partners.
- We're not partners. Jesus Christ.

856
01:10:14,089 --> 01:10:15,924
All right. Here's what gonna happen.

857
01:10:17,342 --> 01:10:19,052
We keep the drugs with us.

858
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:20,595
And we all go in.

859
01:10:20,596 --> 01:10:22,264
No one leaves anyone's sight.

860
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:24,266
And you get that goddamn pager.

861
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:28,562
I'm going to pray to Christ that
Dimitri doesn't see you and me together.

862
01:10:28,563 --> 01:10:30,772
Dumbest, most dangerous plan.

863
01:10:32,524 --> 01:10:34,026
Are you really not partners?

864
01:10:53,629 --> 01:10:54,880
The ladder's really cold.

865
01:10:54,881 --> 01:10:56,297
What?

866
01:10:56,298 --> 01:10:57,508
The ladder's really cold.

867
01:10:57,509 --> 01:10:58,592
Shut up.

868
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:38,442
Um, I'm friends with Diego,
and he left something for me.

869
01:12:38,443 --> 01:12:39,525
- What?
- He left a pager.

870
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:42,404
Diego, he left a pager for me.
It's a green pager.

871
01:12:42,405 --> 01:12:45,282
- Got you, man.
- Okay. Thank you.

872
01:12:57,085 --> 01:12:59,755
No, no, no. No, no, no.
It's a pager. It's right there.

873
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:07,513
Can you...

874
01:13:25,906 --> 01:13:27,782
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What are you doing behind the bar?

875
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:29,910
- What are you doing behind the bar?
- I wasn't doing anything.

876
01:13:29,911 --> 01:13:32,663
I was just talking to that guy over there.
No.

877
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:38,752
Okay, okay.

878
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:06,071
Ooh, ah.

879
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:08,615
Hey, hey, hey!

880
01:14:09,783 --> 01:14:10,909
Hey, hey, hey!

881
01:14:12,452 --> 01:14:13,453
Hey, hey, hey!

882
01:14:14,705 --> 01:14:15,706
Hey, hey, hey!

883
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,083
Hey, hey, hey!

884
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:23,088
Hey, hey, hey!

885
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:25,298
Hey, hey, hey!

886
01:14:26,717 --> 01:14:27,717
Hey, hey, hey!

887
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:30,470
Hey!

888
01:14:31,972 --> 01:14:33,223
Hey!

889
01:14:34,099 --> 01:14:35,100
Hey!

890
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:37,686
Hey, hey, hey!

891
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:39,645
Hey, hey, hey!

892
01:14:40,856 --> 01:14:42,357
Hey, hey, hey!

893
01:14:43,108 --> 01:14:44,359
Hey, hey, hey!

894
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:49,655
Hey, hey, hey!

895
01:15:49,925 --> 01:15:54,304
No, boys, no! Everyone, calm down!

896
01:15:55,806 --> 01:15:57,098
What's going on here, Dimitri?

897
01:15:57,099 --> 01:15:59,392
- Who the fuck is this asshole?
- Who the fuck are you?

898
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:01,687
Boys, boys, it's fine.

899
01:16:02,396 --> 01:16:04,857
Everyone, calm down. Give me those.

900
01:16:06,817 --> 01:16:09,653
Guns are only for the wedding party.

901
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:14,157
I'm sorry, baby. Please, I'm sorry...

902
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:15,701
<i>...I'll fix it.</i>

903
01:16:17,911 --> 01:16:20,080
Everyone, it's okay.

904
01:16:20,873 --> 01:16:22,833
They are friends.

905
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:25,001
Yeah.

906
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:26,837
Come here, both of you.

907
01:16:26,838 --> 01:16:28,129
Come here.

908
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,840
Start the music, please.

909
01:16:39,224 --> 01:16:40,225
Hey.

910
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:56,825
You crash my daughter's wedding
and then you pull out guns, huh?

911
01:16:56,826 --> 01:16:58,201
I came to pay my respects.

912
01:16:58,202 --> 01:17:00,411
Wait, Dimitri, you know this asshole?

913
01:17:00,412 --> 01:17:06,627
Believe it or not,
you two offer not dissimilar services.

914
01:17:07,544 --> 01:17:10,214
With all due respect, Dimitri,
I highly doubt that.

915
01:17:11,673 --> 01:17:13,800
And if I ever see you again, bucko...

916
01:17:16,387 --> 01:17:17,513
Oof.

917
01:17:22,893 --> 01:17:23,894
Hey!

918
01:17:25,145 --> 01:17:26,146
Let's go!

919
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:27,897
Oof.

920
01:17:27,898 --> 01:17:32,069
All right, all right, all right.

921
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:36,114
Hey, leave him. Stay. Have a drink.

922
01:17:37,783 --> 01:17:40,494
- I got a job to do.
- Oh, I see.

923
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:43,121
The professional.

924
01:17:44,498 --> 01:17:48,252
The lone wolf. Mmm.

925
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:52,548
Sorry for the disturbance.

926
01:17:54,466 --> 01:17:56,844
Congratulations
on your daughter's wedding.

927
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:01,098
Sweetie.

928
01:18:01,849 --> 01:18:03,183
Hey, sweetie.

929
01:18:04,977 --> 01:18:06,687
Come here. Hey.

930
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:15,028
Buddies...

931
01:18:26,874 --> 01:18:29,293
Hey!

932
01:18:54,776 --> 01:18:55,777
See?

933
01:18:56,862 --> 01:18:58,447
I told you I wasn't gonna run.

934
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,867
There's no address yet.

935
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:03,911
We still got some time.

936
01:19:10,209 --> 01:19:11,835
I wanna finish the job too.

937
01:19:19,384 --> 01:19:20,385
Come on.

938
01:19:33,315 --> 01:19:36,276
Would you shut your mouth when you chew?

939
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:44,576
Okay.

940
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:53,079
Hey, how do you even start
doing something like this?

941
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:56,505
Like what-what...
you know, what you guys do.

942
01:19:57,506 --> 01:19:58,715
What is it you think we do?

943
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:01,170
Well, you fix things, right?

944
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:08,350
Like, if something's messed up or,
like, if someone, like,

945
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:11,228
messes up, you, like, make it okay, right?

946
01:20:13,146 --> 01:20:14,147
More or less.

947
01:20:17,609 --> 01:20:20,529
Hmm. Well, um, thank you.

948
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:29,079
Mmm.

949
01:20:31,164 --> 01:20:32,875
Too bad you both can't work together.

950
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:39,089
Like, what you do must be really lonely.

951
01:20:46,346 --> 01:20:47,347
I'm gonna pee.

952
01:20:54,146 --> 01:20:59,484
So, Lagrange has a mole with Dimitri,
or Diego is playing both sides somehow.

953
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:05,469
- You still on this conspiracy thing?
- Diego's dead mom was a bullshit story.

954
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:09,369
They're setting the kid up. But why?
And how did Lagrange get that shipment?

955
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:10,953
What does it matter?

956
01:21:10,954 --> 01:21:13,040
- You're not curious?
- Doesn't change the job.

957
01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:15,000
So you're not curious?

958
01:21:16,293 --> 01:21:17,960
Would be a valuable piece of intel.

959
01:21:17,961 --> 01:21:21,548
We'd have to figure out how to play it.
We both can't know everything.

960
01:21:21,549 --> 01:21:23,966
Okay. Then one of us would make the drop.

961
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:25,719
Then maybe we figure out
what the fuck's going on.

962
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,345
If we get the address.

963
01:21:27,346 --> 01:21:30,265
If we get the address,
one of us makes the drop.

964
01:21:37,356 --> 01:21:38,357
No.

965
01:21:40,484 --> 01:21:41,776
He has to do it.

966
01:21:41,777 --> 01:21:43,486
What? You... No, no, no.

967
01:21:43,487 --> 01:21:46,198
He could run. He could talk.
There's too many variables with that kid.

968
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:47,616
He has to do it.

969
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,701
I'm not following.

970
01:21:51,078 --> 01:21:53,038
Sometimes the job takes care of itself.

971
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,251
Oh.

972
01:21:59,044 --> 01:22:00,879
So the kid walks in and he gets shot?

973
01:22:02,923 --> 01:22:04,590
Because you don't wanna do it?

974
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:08,178
I don't do anything I don't have to.
Especially not that.

975
01:22:08,179 --> 01:22:09,513
Or you've lost your nerve.

976
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:14,059
Mmm. I mean, this kid doesn't come home,
people are gonna look for him.

977
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,561
This way, they find him.

978
01:22:15,562 --> 01:22:16,561
No, no. I get it.

979
01:22:17,062 --> 01:22:18,605
You could just let him live.

980
01:22:19,606 --> 01:22:20,606
Hmm.

981
01:22:21,024 --> 01:22:22,609
Let's say you're wrong.

982
01:22:23,443 --> 01:22:25,779
The kid makes the drop,
and he walks out alive.

983
01:22:28,073 --> 01:22:30,367
Then...

984
01:22:37,457 --> 01:22:40,002
You know why they have
multiple shooters on a firing squad?

985
01:22:40,003 --> 01:22:41,503
I do.

986
01:22:43,463 --> 01:22:44,881
So...

987
01:22:44,882 --> 01:22:47,042
- I'm not asking. I don't need your help.
- I know y...

988
01:22:47,593 --> 01:22:49,594
I'm... I'm offering.

989
01:22:49,595 --> 01:22:51,555
Why? So you can say I lost my edge?

990
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:53,640
To who?

991
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:58,853
I'm saying that I unders...

992
01:22:58,854 --> 01:23:03,734
I know what...
what that feels... doing that.

993
01:23:05,194 --> 01:23:06,695
So maybe this way it would...

994
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:12,159
be a little less...

995
01:23:14,286 --> 01:23:15,287
yeah.

996
01:23:44,107 --> 01:23:45,192
You know it?

997
01:23:49,363 --> 01:23:50,531
Did it go off?

998
01:23:51,865 --> 01:23:54,659
Oh, thank God.

999
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:57,704
Oh, my God.
I thought we were dead.

1000
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:01,374
Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you.

1001
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:04,086
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.

1002
01:24:49,715 --> 01:24:50,716
Now what?

1003
01:24:51,758 --> 01:24:52,801
Now you go in.

1004
01:24:55,721 --> 01:24:56,763
You guys aren't coming?

1005
01:24:58,849 --> 01:25:01,018
You took the job. Now you gotta finish it.

1006
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:06,231
Right.

1007
01:25:12,112 --> 01:25:13,352
Are you guys gonna wait for me?

1008
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:17,576
All right.

1009
01:25:18,327 --> 01:25:19,328
I'll be back.

1010
01:26:22,766 --> 01:26:24,518
It could take care of itself.

1011
01:26:45,163 --> 01:26:46,289
Fuck it.

1012
01:27:03,891 --> 01:27:05,392
- Is that the...
- The Albanians.

1013
01:27:10,564 --> 01:27:11,815
Fuck!

1014
01:27:20,616 --> 01:27:21,616
Fuck!

1015
01:27:25,454 --> 01:27:26,872
Go, go, go, go, go!

1016
01:27:35,172 --> 01:27:38,008
You are not wolves! You are buddies!

1017
01:27:47,184 --> 01:27:48,644
Three, two...

1018
01:29:35,918 --> 01:29:36,919
Hmm.

1019
01:30:59,835 --> 01:31:02,588
Is everybody dead?

1020
01:31:05,299 --> 01:31:07,593
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ. What the fuck?

1021
01:31:09,052 --> 01:31:10,179
What happened?

1022
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:14,349
So, I'm walking up to the warehouse,
and I'm... I'm thinking to myself,

1023
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:15,683
like, "Oh, this is really scary."

1024
01:31:15,684 --> 01:31:17,393
But I was thinking that I could do it,
'cause you guys

1025
01:31:17,394 --> 01:31:20,000
gave me confidence,
and I thought that I could do it.

1026
01:31:20,001 --> 01:31:22,608
Oh, my God.
Stop, stop. Stop. Doesn't matter.

1027
01:31:22,609 --> 01:31:26,153
Fuck. Now what?

1028
01:31:38,457 --> 01:31:39,666
Finish the job.

1029
01:31:41,502 --> 01:31:42,503
What?

1030
01:31:44,004 --> 01:31:46,298
You came here to drop off the drugs.
Do it.

1031
01:31:47,007 --> 01:31:50,260
How am I supposed to...
What, I just put 'em anywhere?

1032
01:31:51,512 --> 01:31:53,013
What story are you trying to tell?

1033
01:31:58,143 --> 01:31:59,186
Uh...

1034
01:32:02,481 --> 01:32:07,277
Um, I'm pretty sure that this guy, uh,
over here was in charge of these guys,

1035
01:32:07,278 --> 01:32:10,760
um, so maybe he had this one.

1036
01:32:10,761 --> 01:32:14,242
Uh...

1037
01:32:14,243 --> 01:32:18,580
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I know. Yeah.

1038
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:37,558
And, uh, let's say this guy, maybe he...

1039
01:32:48,902 --> 01:32:51,342
...trying to get away, you know.
He didn't even wanna be here.

1040
01:33:35,991 --> 01:33:37,284
Looks more realistic.

1041
01:33:47,544 --> 01:33:49,963
Let's go. You don't wanna be here
when the sun comes up.

1042
01:33:55,928 --> 01:33:59,264
Um...
...could I get a ride home?

1043
01:33:59,265 --> 01:34:01,016
Take the subway.

1044
01:34:01,017 --> 01:34:02,767
Please.

1045
01:34:02,768 --> 01:34:04,686
We're all taking the subway.

1046
01:34:43,058 --> 01:34:44,685
You got blood on your sweater.

1047
01:35:20,262 --> 01:35:21,263
Fucker.

1048
01:35:26,852 --> 01:35:28,103
I didn't care.

1049
01:35:31,231 --> 01:35:33,399
Hmm.

1050
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,318
Oh. What are we gonna tell my dad?

1051
01:35:35,319 --> 01:35:37,570
That nothing unusual happened tonight,

1052
01:35:37,571 --> 01:35:40,052
and if either of you
were to say anything differently,

1053
01:35:40,053 --> 01:35:42,534
we're gonna flip a coin
to see who's gonna kill you

1054
01:35:42,535 --> 01:35:44,328
and who's gonna kill your dad.

1055
01:35:45,996 --> 01:35:46,997
Hmm.

1056
01:35:50,167 --> 01:35:51,376
Was nice to meet you guys.

1057
01:35:51,377 --> 01:35:52,461
You never met us.

1058
01:35:54,087 --> 01:35:55,088
Right.

1059
01:36:16,151 --> 01:36:18,551
Um, hey, Dad. These guys
need to talk to you about something.

1060
01:36:23,116 --> 01:36:26,245
So, Frank is doing this movie,
<i>Manchurian Candidate.</i>

1061
01:36:26,246 --> 01:36:29,455
He's notorious for just doing one take.

1062
01:36:29,456 --> 01:36:34,002
And the director, he says,
"That was perfect. Let's do one more."

1063
01:36:35,379 --> 01:36:36,797
Frank says, "I'll tell you what,

1064
01:36:37,589 --> 01:36:40,968
if it's so perfect,
why don't you print it twice?"

1065
01:36:42,511 --> 01:36:43,803
You like it black?

1066
01:36:43,804 --> 01:36:45,305
Black's fine.

1067
01:36:45,306 --> 01:36:46,222
Yeah.

1068
01:36:46,223 --> 01:36:47,724
Hey. Get back. Come on.

1069
01:36:47,725 --> 01:36:49,059
Little. Come on.

1070
01:36:59,528 --> 01:37:03,198
So... what's this all about?

1071
01:37:07,077 --> 01:37:10,247
Wanna grab some breakfast?

1072
01:37:10,956 --> 01:37:12,164
I know a place.

1073
01:37:12,165 --> 01:37:13,709
Brighton Beach,
across from where they had the...

1074
01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:15,377
Exactly. I love that place.

1075
01:37:15,961 --> 01:37:18,881
That was a very intimidating
performance in there, by the way.

1076
01:37:19,423 --> 01:37:21,508
You like that thing
with the pliers?

1077
01:37:21,509 --> 01:37:22,947
Might even steal it.

1078
01:37:22,948 --> 01:37:24,386
You like blini?

1079
01:37:24,387 --> 01:37:25,762
Love a blini.

1080
01:37:33,437 --> 01:37:34,563
Yeah.

1081
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,192
There we go. Thank you.

1082
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:41,944
- A tracker.
- In the goddamn drugs.

1083
01:37:41,945 --> 01:37:43,780
Should've caught that immediately.

1084
01:37:44,865 --> 01:37:48,243
So, did Lagrange even
steal the drugs, or were...

1085
01:37:48,244 --> 01:37:49,327
I...

1086
01:37:49,328 --> 01:37:51,662
Oh, so now you don't care
who stole the shipment?

1087
01:37:51,663 --> 01:37:53,957
I don't think it matters
as long as the kid stays quiet.

1088
01:37:57,878 --> 01:38:02,049
You do realize one of us,
most likely, eventually...

1089
01:38:04,176 --> 01:38:06,595
Yeah. Probably. Cross that bridge...

1090
01:38:06,596 --> 01:38:10,224
If he can be killed.

1091
01:38:11,266 --> 01:38:13,309
Yeah. Well...

1092
01:38:13,310 --> 01:38:14,603
Lucky fucker.

1093
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:17,481
Well, that was a night.

1094
01:38:19,149 --> 01:38:20,400
Yeah.

1095
01:38:32,871 --> 01:38:33,872
Yeah.

1096
01:38:34,915 --> 01:38:35,958
All right, then.

1097
01:38:38,919 --> 01:38:42,506
So, what did she say to you
to get you to work with me?

1098
01:38:42,507 --> 01:38:44,654
What'd she say? She had all the leverage.

1099
01:38:44,655 --> 01:38:46,802
She said that I didn't have a choice.

1100
01:38:49,805 --> 01:38:50,806
All right.

1101
01:38:53,308 --> 01:38:56,348
"You take a job, you give your word,
and that word's the measure of the man."

1102
01:39:08,198 --> 01:39:09,283
Who called you?

1103
01:39:10,075 --> 01:39:11,326
What?

1104
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:13,411
In the car to June's.

1105
01:39:13,412 --> 01:39:14,913
- Who called you?
- Who called you?

1106
01:39:15,622 --> 01:39:16,623
It was your guy.

1107
01:39:16,624 --> 01:39:17,832
My guy?

1108
01:39:17,833 --> 01:39:19,960
The guy that Pam got your number from.
Your guy.

1109
01:39:20,544 --> 01:39:23,046
- So, she must have called him.
- But then why call me?

1110
01:39:23,922 --> 01:39:24,923
Who called...

1111
01:39:26,383 --> 01:39:28,218
You're saying the DA got your number...

1112
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:29,782
No.

1113
01:39:29,783 --> 01:39:30,846
Yeah.

1114
01:39:33,515 --> 01:39:34,850
We have the same guy?

1115
01:39:39,771 --> 01:39:41,690
We both have the same guy.

1116
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,029
But why does he care?
It's just a cleanup job.

1117
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:50,324
- He doesn't. Unless...
- Unless he knew about the drugs.

1118
01:39:50,325 --> 01:39:52,825
Kid's dead, can't make the drop,
so he calls us.

1119
01:39:52,826 --> 01:39:55,412
- One at a time, but nobody answers.
- So, he sent someone else.

1120
01:39:55,413 --> 01:39:56,954
- Chinatown.
- Sees the kid's alive.

1121
01:39:56,955 --> 01:39:58,497
- Hard to miss. The plan's back on track.
- Except,

1122
01:39:58,498 --> 01:40:01,210
- we're on our way to Dimitri's...
- Who would have killed us, except...

1123
01:40:01,211 --> 01:40:02,961
We didn't fool Dimitri. He was tipped off.

1124
01:40:02,962 --> 01:40:04,253
Bodyguard didn't get the memo.

1125
01:40:04,254 --> 01:40:05,713
The Albanians don't make a move because...

1126
01:40:05,714 --> 01:40:07,444
- The tracker's not even on.
- Until the page.

1127
01:40:07,445 --> 01:40:09,176
- It was all a setup.
- It looks like Lagrange

1128
01:40:09,177 --> 01:40:10,426
is trying to move the stolen drugs.

1129
01:40:10,427 --> 01:40:12,032
And the Albanians go to war with Lagrange,

1130
01:40:12,033 --> 01:40:13,638
- no competition.
- The city shuts down.

1131
01:40:13,639 --> 01:40:15,389
- People get arrested.
- I know a DA who's tough on crime.

1132
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:17,017
- ...the real thief to clean up.
- ...who can clean drug money.

1133
01:40:17,018 --> 01:40:18,392
Great things to come.

1134
01:40:18,393 --> 01:40:19,978
No wonder they wanted
the cameras in the room.

1135
01:40:19,979 --> 01:40:21,104
He wanted to know who knew.

1136
01:40:21,855 --> 01:40:23,815
But the kid turns
the ambush into a shoot-out.

1137
01:40:24,483 --> 01:40:27,323
We were supposed to take the fall.
He didn't think we'd send the kid in.

1138
01:40:30,781 --> 01:40:32,241
We were getting cleaned.

1139
01:41:00,352 --> 01:41:02,270
- He's not gonna let us out of here alive.
- Nope.

1140
01:41:02,271 --> 01:41:05,357
They're really
not taking any chances, are they?

1141
01:41:05,358 --> 01:41:06,400
No.

1142
01:41:08,443 --> 01:41:11,113
You know, I never did catch your name.

1143
01:41:12,614 --> 01:41:14,867
I tell you what, we survive this...

1144
01:41:15,492 --> 01:41:16,535
Deal.

1145
01:41:21,123 --> 01:41:22,165
Ready?

1146
01:41:23,292 --> 01:41:24,292
Yeah.

1147
01:42:27,773 --> 01:42:29,148
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1148
01:42:29,149 --> 01:42:33,403
- Yeah. Whoo!
- Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

1149
01:42:33,404 --> 01:42:36,093
- Whoo! Whoo.
- Whoa!

1150
01:42:36,094 --> 01:42:38,784
I got you.

1151
01:42:45,374 --> 01:42:46,415
Fuck.
