1
00:00:58,446 --> 00:00:59,311
Madeleine?

2
00:01:09,623 --> 00:01:11,024
Madeleine!

3
00:01:14,923 --> 00:01:16,293
Madeleine!

4
00:01:48,222 --> 00:01:49,964
Oh. No, no.

5
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,171
Mama.
Mama. Mama. Mama!

6
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:36,175
Mama!

7
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:03,670
Mama!

8
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:39,301
- Is Mr. White home?
- No. He's gone.

9
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:43,039
My name is Lyutsifer Safin.

10
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:45,547
Your husband killed my family.

11
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:48,079
I told you, he's gone.

12
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:51,586
I know. This will hurt him more.

13
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:14,387
You okay?

14
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:17,786
Yes.

15
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:21,163
Let's go.

16
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:36,904
How's the view?

17
00:07:38,814 --> 00:07:39,511
It's growing on me.

18
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:44,351
Can you go faster?

19
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:47,288
We don't need to go faster.

20
00:07:49,124 --> 00:07:51,325
We have all the time
in the world.

21
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:36,431
You can't help
looking over your shoulder.

22
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:39,138
- What?
- No one is coming.

23
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:41,600
I wasn't looking
over my shoulder.

24
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:42,978
- Yes, you were.
- No.

25
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:44,169
Are we gonna have a row about this?

26
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:47,015
What are they burning?

27
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:50,382
Secrets. Wishes.
Letting go of the past.

28
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:52,881
Getting rid of old things,
in come the new.

29
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:27,718
Where did you go to?

30
00:09:29,518 --> 00:09:31,757
Today, by the water. Hmm?

31
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:33,262
Tell me.

32
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:37,695
I'll tell you
if you tell me about Vesper.

33
00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:43,201
Is that why we're here?

34
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:44,696
She's buried at the acropolis.

35
00:09:44,732 --> 00:09:45,802
I know where she's buried.

36
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:51,236
Can you forgive her? For us?

37
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:55,614
I left her behind
a long time ago.

38
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:04,056
As long as we're looking
over our shoulder,

39
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:05,151
the past is not dead.

40
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:14,962
You have to let her go,
even if it's hard.

41
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:17,937
You mean, um,
if we're to have a future?

42
00:10:17,973 --> 00:10:19,066
Mm-hmm.

43
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:23,472
So, I do this, and then...

44
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:25,512
I'll tell you all my secrets.

45
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:29,582
Okay.

46
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:42,621
I'm going to go and do this,

47
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:44,019
and then I'm going to come back
for breakfast.

48
00:11:46,763 --> 00:11:49,289
Thank you.

49
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:51,763
And then you're going to tell me
where we're going next.

50
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:57,169
Home.

51
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:09,676
I miss you.

52
00:14:08,497 --> 00:14:10,134
What...

53
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:24,685
Madeleine?

54
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:27,556
Madeleine?

55
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:22,099
Blofeld sends his regards.

56
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:25,936
You know...

57
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:28,842
Madeleine, she is a daughter
of Spectre.

58
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:33,143
She's a daughter of Spectre.

59
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:19,887
Your baggage is already down,
Mr. Bond.

60
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:21,521
As your wife requested.

61
00:17:28,402 --> 00:17:29,738
You were right.

62
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:34,736
Letting go is hard.

63
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:36,209
James.

64
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:37,779
What happened?

65
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,408
- What happened?
- How did they know I was here?

66
00:17:42,443 --> 00:17:43,879
- What are you talking about?
- Madeleine,

67
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:46,349
how did they know I was here?

68
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:48,523
- I have no idea what you're--
- Spectre. How did they know?

69
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:50,187
What are you talking about?
James!

70
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:54,026
I didn't do anything.

71
00:17:55,796 --> 00:17:57,524
I didn't do anything.

72
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:05,405
We're leaving.

73
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:21,449
There is something I need to tell you.

74
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:23,290
I bet there is.

75
00:18:28,594 --> 00:18:29,798
James!

76
00:18:51,783 --> 00:18:53,415
Pick it up. Pick it up!

77
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:07,801
<i>It's Blofeld, my love.</i>

78
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:09,629
<i>Your father would be so proud of you.</i>

79
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:13,298
<i>Your sacrifice will be our glory.</i>

80
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:15,269
- I don't understand.
- <i>Bravo.</i>

81
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:32,323
James, why?
Why would I betray you?

82
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:35,996
We all have our secrets, we just
didn't get to yours yet.

83
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:10,060
James. James, listen to me.

84
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:11,564
I'd rather die
than you think I'm--

85
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:13,084
James!

86
00:21:14,824 --> 00:21:16,122
James!

87
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:17,163
Do something. James!

88
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:21,732
Say something, James!

89
00:21:23,338 --> 00:21:24,599
Please.

90
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:36,248
Okay.

91
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:33,639
Come on.

92
00:22:48,656 --> 00:22:52,093
So, this is it?

93
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:55,096
This is it.

94
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,601
How will I know that you're okay?

95
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:08,208
You won't.

96
00:23:09,877 --> 00:23:11,006
You'll never see me again.

97
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:51,356
We're in.

98
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:52,619
<i>Proceed.</i>

99
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:56,427
<i>Please remember to back up</i>

100
00:27:56,462 --> 00:27:57,989
<i>all data by 10:00 p.m. this evening</i>

101
00:27:58,024 --> 00:27:59,565
<i>due to planned server maintenance.</i>

102
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:04,036
You okay?

103
00:28:04,071 --> 00:28:05,669
You know the, uh, SL5,

104
00:28:05,705 --> 00:28:07,935
the weaponized smallpox
I was using this morning?

105
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,841
Have you seen it?
I... I put it in the bloody...

106
00:28:11,876 --> 00:28:13,843
Valdo, you haven't seen a tub
of smallpox, have you?

107
00:28:16,315 --> 00:28:18,944
This was a good soup.

108
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:22,453
Now it is waste,
even if it is joke.

109
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:26,325
There is more complexity
in my tomato soup

110
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,789
than in both of your brains combined.

111
00:28:28,824 --> 00:28:31,627
Valdo, that is so unkind.
It's so...

112
00:28:31,663 --> 00:28:34,699
One day I will put Ebola in your tea.

113
00:28:34,734 --> 00:28:38,030
And then I will watch as your faces
sweat blood...

114
00:28:38,065 --> 00:28:40,074
...and I will be laughing.

115
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:42,409
- Nice. Keep your hair on.
- Wow.

116
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:44,844
He's got a terrifying
imagination, hasn't he?

117
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,574
Dr. Obruchev.

118
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,080
<i>They are coming.</i>

119
00:28:48,115 --> 00:28:49,681
- Who?
- <i>Spectre.</i>

120
00:28:55,224 --> 00:28:57,818
- Safin.
- <i>Do not try to stop them.</i>

121
00:28:57,854 --> 00:28:59,592
<i>This is what we've been waiting for.</i>

122
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:06,164
<i>They will ask you to enter
Bio Security Level Four fridge</i>

123
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:08,092
<i>and remove the weapon.</i>

124
00:29:08,128 --> 00:29:11,538
<i>No one must see what you are doing.</i>

125
00:29:11,573 --> 00:29:14,770
<i>They will not kill you.
They think they need you.</i>

126
00:29:14,806 --> 00:29:18,443
They will not kill me?

127
00:29:18,478 --> 00:29:21,678
Transferring the files
as we speak.

128
00:29:21,714 --> 00:29:25,117
Now... Now it's done.
What do I do with it?

129
00:29:25,152 --> 00:29:26,682
<i>Swallow it. Goodbye.</i>

130
00:29:26,717 --> 00:29:28,220
Swallow the...

131
00:29:28,255 --> 00:29:32,616
Yes, I like animals!

132
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:33,659
Bye-bye.

133
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,706
<i>Danger, illegal access detected.</i>

134
00:29:48,741 --> 00:29:51,138
<i>Secure all biohazardous

135
00:29:55,149 --> 00:29:57,113
Move! Follow!

136
00:29:59,288 --> 00:30:01,818
- No! No!
<i>- Caution.</i>

137
00:30:01,853 --> 00:30:04,349
<i>Unauthorized personnel
located in this sector.</i>

138
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:16,665
Please, we're scientists,
we're unarmed.

139
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,868
We're unarmed. What do you want?

140
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:22,472
Valdo Obruchev.

141
00:30:22,507 --> 00:30:24,477
Hello.

142
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,712
Open the Bio Security
Level Four fridge.

143
00:30:28,449 --> 00:30:30,515
- And, uh...
- Give me the weapon.

144
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:34,148
The weap-- What weapon?
We have, uh...

145
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:36,455
Heracles.

146
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,649
It requires double authentication.

147
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:39,692
Which one?

148
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:43,922
Him.

149
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:46,092
Hardy. Hardy! Don't let them.

150
00:30:46,127 --> 00:30:48,366
Don't let them.
Don't let them, please.

151
00:31:32,246 --> 00:31:34,708
Oh.

152
00:31:34,743 --> 00:31:36,513
<i>Warning,</i>

00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:38,848

Oh, what is, uh...
It's a safety belt? This?

158
00:31:56,872 --> 00:31:57,803
Wow.

159
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:16,046
I... I cannot!

160
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:18,024
There is no elevator!

161
00:32:23,923 --> 00:32:26,062
Magnets.

162
00:32:44,949 --> 00:32:46,811
Sir, I've just received
the most unusual--

163
00:32:46,847 --> 00:32:47,787
I've seen it.

164
00:32:54,657 --> 00:32:56,191
Oh, Jesus Christ.

165
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:04,570
Sir, what's
the Heracles project?

166
00:33:04,605 --> 00:33:07,139
This lab isn't on the books.

167
00:33:07,175 --> 00:33:07,873
No, it's not.

168
00:33:11,108 --> 00:33:12,845
- There were casualties.
- It was a gas leak.

169
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:15,339
Shall I alert the PM?

170
00:33:15,374 --> 00:33:16,841
It was a gas leak.
I'll handle it.

171
00:33:16,876 --> 00:33:17,883
Moneypenny.

172
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,348
Where's 007?

173
00:35:50,034 --> 00:35:51,566
Well, isn't this a surprise, Felix?

174
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:52,598
James.

175
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:54,842
Who's the blond?

176
00:35:56,341 --> 00:35:59,143
Logan Ash, State Department.
It's really nice to meet you.

177
00:35:59,178 --> 00:36:03,408
I've heard a lot about you.
I mean, I'm a huge fan.

178
00:36:03,443 --> 00:36:04,980
- Babylon.
- Police boy.

179
00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:06,081
I need a favor, brother.

180
00:36:06,116 --> 00:36:07,951
You didn't get the memo?
I'm retired.

181
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:09,246
I wouldn't ask if you were still

182
00:36:09,281 --> 00:36:10,984
in Her Majesty's Service.

183
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:12,288
And what does that mean?

184
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:16,490
Our elected leaders aren't
playing nice in the sandbox.

185
00:36:18,298 --> 00:36:20,758
James.

186
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:24,069
Is there somewhere quiet
where we can talk in private?

187
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:28,501
Quiet? Yeah.

188
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,875
I was hoping you could
pick up a package.

189
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:33,980
- Five.
- Four.

190
00:36:36,308 --> 00:36:37,515
Where's the package?

191
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,343
Short trip. Cuba.

192
00:36:39,378 --> 00:36:41,046
You love it there.

193
00:36:41,082 --> 00:36:42,883
Oh, I love it there?

194
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:45,287
Hey. Valdo Obruchev.

195
00:36:45,322 --> 00:36:46,956
You're gonna say
you never heard of him.

196
00:36:46,992 --> 00:36:49,693
- Never heard of him. Two.
- Three.

197
00:36:49,728 --> 00:36:52,797
Ah... It's a good life.

198
00:36:52,832 --> 00:36:55,131
You never heard of him?

199
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:57,165
Didn't he defect during your tenure
at MI6?

200
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,298
Obruchev was kidnapped
three days ago

201
00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:01,536
from a secret MI6 lab
in London.

202
00:37:01,571 --> 00:37:04,300
Two days ago, his mug pinged
on a facial-recognition sweep

203
00:37:04,336 --> 00:37:06,812
in Santiago de Cuba.

204
00:37:06,847 --> 00:37:08,346
He's leaving out the best part.

205
00:37:08,381 --> 00:37:10,147
Spectre.

206
00:37:10,183 --> 00:37:12,777
I have a contact there,
says they're gathering.

207
00:37:13,952 --> 00:37:16,022
Coincidence?

208
00:37:17,593 --> 00:37:20,092
Come on. It'll be like old times.

209
00:37:21,627 --> 00:37:22,358
- Three.
- Two.

210
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:28,565
You're really
the only guy for the job.

211
00:37:29,803 --> 00:37:32,566
- You're the guy.
- It's my round.

212
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,114
Hi.

213
00:37:46,587 --> 00:37:48,722
- Scotch.
- Yeah, man.

214
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:54,190
Where'd you find the Book of Mormon?

215
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:57,193
Political appointee.
Not my choice.

216
00:37:57,228 --> 00:37:59,329
Seems intelligence
isn't central anymore.

217
00:38:00,568 --> 00:38:01,966
He smiles too much.

218
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:03,935
Help us get this
into the right hands.

219
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,363
Oh, what, and you're
the right hands?

220
00:38:05,398 --> 00:38:07,030
I'm not just a pretty face.

221
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:09,707
I stopped trusting pretty faces
a long time ago, Felix.

222
00:38:09,742 --> 00:38:11,709
Yeah, I heard. Bad luck.

223
00:38:11,744 --> 00:38:14,241
- Bad judgment.
- Yeah.

224
00:38:14,277 --> 00:38:15,913
Harder to tell
the good from bad,

225
00:38:15,949 --> 00:38:17,446
villains from heroes
these days.

226
00:38:18,981 --> 00:38:21,051
I need you, James.

227
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:21,983
You're the only one
I trust with this.

228
00:38:22,018 --> 00:38:23,546
I'm not screwing around.

229
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:24,955
I wanna get back to my family,

230
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,752
tell them I saved the world again.

231
00:38:27,428 --> 00:38:28,424
Don't you?

232
00:38:31,996 --> 00:38:33,132
Nice to see you again, Felix.

233
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,202
- At least take my number.
- I've got your number.

234
00:39:03,664 --> 00:39:05,230
In trouble?

235
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:09,160
Constantly.

236
00:39:09,195 --> 00:39:10,400
Need a ride?

237
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,172
Sure. Why not?

238
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:18,177
Hold on.

239
00:39:22,146 --> 00:39:23,673
- What's your name?
- Nomi.

240
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,215
- Yours?
- James. Call me James.

241
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,847
- What do you do, Nomi?
- I'm a diver.

242
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:32,655
- What do you dive for?
- I have a thing for old wrecks.

243
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,590
Well, then you've come to the right place.

244
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:43,235
After you.

245
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,241
Hmm...

246
00:39:57,276 --> 00:39:58,549
Nice house.

247
00:39:58,585 --> 00:40:00,751
Thank you.

248
00:40:00,787 --> 00:40:01,715
Is that the bedroom?

249
00:40:06,351 --> 00:40:07,259
Yes, it is.

250
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,078
Well, that's not the first thing

251
00:40:27,113 --> 00:40:28,747
I thought you'd take off,
but, uh...

252
00:40:28,782 --> 00:40:30,576
Yeah.

253
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:33,616
You seem like a man
who's gagging

254
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:37,748
- for some action, Mr. Bond.
- Shall we cut to the chase?

255
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:39,751
I'm here as a professional courtesy.

256
00:40:39,786 --> 00:40:40,891
Well, you're not very
courteous, are you?

257
00:40:40,926 --> 00:40:43,028
You've broken my car...

258
00:40:43,064 --> 00:40:44,956
It's Commander Bond,
but you know that.

259
00:40:46,933 --> 00:40:48,933
- Double-0?
- Two years.

260
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:50,399
- Very young.
- High achiever.

261
00:40:50,434 --> 00:40:53,203
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- The world's moved on

262
00:40:53,238 --> 00:40:55,307
since you retired, Commander Bond.

263
00:40:55,342 --> 00:40:57,100
- Perhaps you didn't notice.
- No, can't say I had.

264
00:40:58,009 --> 00:41:00,044
And in my humble opinion,

265
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,537
the world doesn't change very much.

266
00:41:01,573 --> 00:41:03,708
You would say that.

267
00:41:03,743 --> 00:41:05,412
Look, this all seems like heaven,

268
00:41:05,448 --> 00:41:07,083
this little bubble, or whatever.

269
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,614
But it's so obvious

270
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,920
you're a man who only has
time to kill,

271
00:41:10,956 --> 00:41:12,782
nothing to live for.

272
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:16,427
So Valdo Obruchev is off-limits.

273
00:41:16,462 --> 00:41:18,759
You get in my way, I will put
a bullet in your knee.

274
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:21,696
The one that works.

275
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,305
You need to ask yourself
a few more questions.

276
00:41:29,175 --> 00:41:31,637
MI6, CIA
chasing after the same man,

277
00:41:31,673 --> 00:41:34,439
not communicating
with each other, that...

278
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:37,280
- That's not good.
- Hmm.

279
00:41:37,315 --> 00:41:40,611
You know what?
Tell M hello, but...

280
00:41:40,646 --> 00:41:41,518
I don't work for him anymore.

281
00:41:43,482 --> 00:41:44,983
Tell him yourself.

282
00:41:47,452 --> 00:41:49,422
By the way,

283
00:41:49,457 --> 00:41:51,396
I'm not just any old double-0.

284
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:53,992
I'm 007.

285
00:41:56,664 --> 00:41:58,304
You probably
thought they'd retire it.

286
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:03,707
It's just a number.

287
00:42:03,742 --> 00:42:04,838
Yeah.

288
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:07,346
See you in Cuba?

289
00:42:10,246 --> 00:42:11,975
How's it going, Q?

290
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,117
Several large files seem
to have been wiped

291
00:42:14,152 --> 00:42:15,651
from Obruchev's hard drive.

292
00:42:15,686 --> 00:42:18,288
He was working on some
pretty advanced algorithm...

293
00:42:18,323 --> 00:42:21,019
- Can you retrieve the files?
- Trying.

294
00:42:21,054 --> 00:42:23,393
Get me everything you can
and then destroy the drive.

295
00:42:23,429 --> 00:42:25,121
If I knew more about
what this was, I could...

296
00:42:25,157 --> 00:42:27,792
Thank you, Q. That's all.

297
00:42:27,827 --> 00:42:29,497
Yes. One minute.
The PM is calling again.

298
00:42:29,532 --> 00:42:31,403
007.
Tell them something. Anything.

299
00:42:34,272 --> 00:42:36,401
- 007.
<i>- M, darling.</i>

300
00:42:36,437 --> 00:42:37,376
<i>Couple of things.</i>

301
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:42,244
- Bond.
- I met your new 007.

302
00:42:42,279 --> 00:42:43,844
She's a disarming young woman.

303
00:42:44,752 --> 00:42:47,219
<i>So, Obruchev.</i>

304
00:42:47,255 --> 00:42:49,146
<i>You kept him on the payroll,
didn't you?</i>

305
00:42:49,181 --> 00:42:51,725
Stay out of it. This has nothing
to do with you.

306
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,058
It does. It's Spectre.

307
00:42:54,093 --> 00:42:57,726
Mallory, what have you done?

308
00:43:07,737 --> 00:43:09,474
- Double-0 trouble?
- The CIA have the advantage.

309
00:43:10,536 --> 00:43:12,035
Get me Blofeld.

310
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,739
Sir, he only speaks
to his psychiatrist.

311
00:43:13,774 --> 00:43:15,480
I know. The live feed's what I want.

312
00:43:21,751 --> 00:43:24,088
<i>They stay straight in the middle.</i>

313
00:43:24,123 --> 00:43:26,050
<i>And then they bring him up.</i>

314
00:43:26,085 --> 00:43:28,688
He's like this every day,
mad as a bag of bees.

315
00:43:28,723 --> 00:43:31,194
<i>- It's crowning day.</i>
- Good.

316
00:43:31,229 --> 00:43:34,897
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

317
00:43:34,932 --> 00:43:38,467
<i>It's clean as can be.
Everyone just wants a party.</i>

318
00:43:38,502 --> 00:43:39,771
<i>Yeah, I want them both to hear me.</i>

319
00:43:41,303 --> 00:43:42,408
<i>Be a surprise.</i>

320
00:44:08,363 --> 00:44:10,760
Felix, I'm in.

321
00:44:10,795 --> 00:44:12,801
<i>He's in.</i>

322
00:44:12,836 --> 00:44:14,935
<i>There's a young lady in Santiago
I want you to meet.</i>

323
00:45:04,417 --> 00:45:05,249
Paloma?

324
00:45:08,261 --> 00:45:11,560
- You're late. <i>Vamos.</i>
- I...

325
00:45:11,596 --> 00:45:14,129
Uh, something about a hat?
Paris, uh...

326
00:45:14,165 --> 00:45:15,567
Huh? What hat?

327
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:21,504
I forget things when I get nervous.

328
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,840
This is the biggest job
I've ever had.

329
00:45:36,891 --> 00:45:37,556
This your room?

330
00:45:38,927 --> 00:45:39,789
It's a wine cellar.

331
00:45:42,193 --> 00:45:43,628
Okay, come here.

332
00:45:47,567 --> 00:45:49,366
Don't you think we ought
to get to know each other

333
00:45:49,401 --> 00:45:51,401
just a little bit before we, um...

334
00:45:51,436 --> 00:45:53,898
Oh...
No, no, no, no.

335
00:45:53,934 --> 00:45:57,703
Um, no, I'm sorry.
Um...

336
00:45:57,738 --> 00:45:59,437
- All right.
- You do it.

337
00:45:59,473 --> 00:46:00,909
Thank you.

338
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:05,650
Do you mind, uh...

339
00:46:11,116 --> 00:46:14,457
- This is gonna go brilliantly.
- I know.

340
00:46:14,492 --> 00:46:15,418
I've done
three weeks' training.

341
00:46:38,782 --> 00:46:40,014
Let's get a drink.

342
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:42,881
Good idea.

343
00:46:47,593 --> 00:46:50,128
Two vodka martinis,
shaken, not stirred.

344
00:46:50,163 --> 00:46:50,926
<i>Si, señor.</i>

345
00:47:02,873 --> 00:47:04,467
So I can hear you.

346
00:47:11,382 --> 00:47:12,376
What shall we drink to?

347
00:47:14,187 --> 00:47:15,687
- Felix?
- To Felix.

348
00:47:18,225 --> 00:47:19,526
Remind me to get him a cigar.

349
00:47:30,002 --> 00:47:31,201
<i>Vamos?</i>

350
00:47:31,236 --> 00:47:32,330
- Sure.
- Okay.

351
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:43,313
Will this sample be enough for you?

352
00:47:43,348 --> 00:47:45,942
If he has used it, yes.

353
00:47:45,977 --> 00:47:47,147
It is now progressing.

354
00:47:54,357 --> 00:47:56,024
Oops. Sorry.

355
00:47:57,663 --> 00:48:00,732
Terrible, terrible gloves.
So slippery.

356
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:02,767
Forgive me.

357
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:04,571
How much longer?

358
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,775
A-ha.

359
00:48:12,875 --> 00:48:14,779
To happy new future
for Spectre.

360
00:48:17,876 --> 00:48:18,750
Now, it is ready.

361
00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:51,248
You go that way.

362
00:48:51,283 --> 00:48:52,718
I'll go this way.

363
00:49:00,389 --> 00:49:02,794
<i>What is this?
Spectre bunga-bunga?</i>

364
00:49:04,895 --> 00:49:07,063
<i>You ever been to a party like this?</i>

365
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:08,632
<i>How do you think
I got this job?</i>

366
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:10,626
<i>Don't get distracted, now.</i>

367
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:12,869
<i>Remember, we're looking
for our Russian scientist.</i>

368
00:49:12,904 --> 00:49:14,400
<i>I'm seeing a lot of Spectre agents.</i>

369
00:49:14,436 --> 00:49:16,605
Yes.

370
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,644
And it looks like all of them.

371
00:49:22,312 --> 00:49:23,408
Wow.

372
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:35,891
<i>Friend of yours?</i>

373
00:49:35,926 --> 00:49:39,123
Cyclops. We ran into each other
in Italy.

374
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:42,334
That was an eye-opening experience.

375
00:49:44,536 --> 00:49:46,268
They're wearing earpieces.

376
00:49:46,303 --> 00:49:47,935
Scanning.

377
00:49:56,314 --> 00:49:59,243
<i>It'll be clean. It's good.
It's as good as can be.</i>

378
00:49:59,279 --> 00:50:01,081
<i>- It's my party.</i>
- Ah. Found it.

379
00:50:01,116 --> 00:50:03,089
<i>Celebrate me, my birthday,</i>

380
00:50:03,124 --> 00:50:04,322
<i>my crowning day.</i>

381
00:50:06,691 --> 00:50:08,125
<i>Who's the birthday boy?</i>

382
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,858
Um...

383
00:50:09,893 --> 00:50:13,263
- Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
- Is he here?

384
00:50:13,298 --> 00:50:14,259
No, he's...

385
00:50:14,295 --> 00:50:16,158
<i>Make your way. Follow the music.</i>

386
00:50:16,193 --> 00:50:18,133
He's in London in prison.

387
00:50:18,168 --> 00:50:20,437
<i>How do you know for sure?</i>

388
00:50:20,472 --> 00:50:22,640
Because I put him there.

389
00:50:22,675 --> 00:50:24,677
<i>...feel my warm embrace.</i>

390
00:50:24,712 --> 00:50:27,714
<i>Experiencea delicious surprise.</i>

391
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:31,547
<i>Let us shepherd humanity</i>

392
00:50:31,582 --> 00:50:32,877
<i>with our new power.</i>

393
00:50:32,912 --> 00:50:34,177
I've spotted him,

394
00:50:34,213 --> 00:50:36,953
<i>our little Russian scientist.</i>

395
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:38,381
- Have you got him?
<i>- I'm here.</i>

396
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:40,957
- I got him.
<i>- Stay with him.</i>

397
00:50:40,993 --> 00:50:43,857
<i>But I see you from my little eye,</i>

398
00:50:43,892 --> 00:50:46,362
<i>and my little eye says hi.</i>

399
00:50:46,398 --> 00:50:50,034
<i>Now, see, now,</i>

400
00:50:50,069 --> 00:50:53,201
<i>we emerge from the shadows
as gods on Mount Olympus.</i>

401
00:50:55,004 --> 00:50:57,907
<i>Here's to the end of our pariah.</i>

402
00:50:57,942 --> 00:51:00,912
<i>Oh, my burden, my brother...</i>

403
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:04,212
<i>James Bond.</i>

404
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,520
<i>Goodbye, James.</i>

405
00:51:10,522 --> 00:51:12,718
<i>You're popular tonight.</i>

406
00:51:14,053 --> 00:51:15,758
<i>You can't run.</i>

407
00:51:15,793 --> 00:51:17,764
<i>It's too late.</i>

408
00:51:20,932 --> 00:51:24,736
<i>It's already crawling under your skin.</i>

409
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:27,235
<i>Don't be alarmed, it's harmless to us.</i>

410
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:30,440
<i>Just to him. So delicious.</i>

411
00:51:37,943 --> 00:51:39,018
Sir!

412
00:51:42,454 --> 00:51:43,952
It is working.

413
00:51:43,988 --> 00:51:45,748
It is working. Only Spectre are dying.

414
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:59,570
Hello.

415
00:51:59,605 --> 00:52:02,638
Are you for my, uh, esco...

416
00:52:02,673 --> 00:52:05,273
- Hmm?
- No? Oh.

417
00:52:11,448 --> 00:52:12,984
Go!

418
00:52:24,524 --> 00:52:26,488
- Thank you. I'll take this.
- No!

419
00:52:26,524 --> 00:52:27,330
- What was that?
- Get him!

420
00:52:37,038 --> 00:52:38,042
Time to go. Let's go!

421
00:52:50,457 --> 00:52:52,257
It's clear.

422
00:52:56,529 --> 00:52:57,988
May I cut in?

423
00:53:02,033 --> 00:53:04,293
Go get him.
I'll hold them off.

424
00:53:04,328 --> 00:53:06,303
Cover the exits!

425
00:53:06,338 --> 00:53:07,038
Paloma.

426
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,043
Don't let them get away!

427
00:53:17,683 --> 00:53:19,384
<i>Have you got them?</i>

428
00:53:19,419 --> 00:53:21,119
<i>Nearly.</i>

429
00:53:21,155 --> 00:53:22,152
No!

430
00:53:39,338 --> 00:53:40,368
Down!

431
00:53:43,745 --> 00:53:45,304
Get them! Don't let them get away!

432
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,902
<i>Paloma, I know you're busy,</i>

433
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:49,079
<i>but the curtain's about
to come down on this one.</i>

434
00:53:49,115 --> 00:53:50,646
<i>I can get a car.
Where do you need it?</i>

435
00:53:50,682 --> 00:53:52,446
I'll be right there.

436
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:59,684
Stay down!

437
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:03,886
Move!

438
00:54:32,985 --> 00:54:33,960
Huh?

439
00:54:43,668 --> 00:54:44,234
Come on!

440
00:54:52,572 --> 00:54:54,139
Three weeks' training, really?

441
00:54:54,174 --> 00:54:55,241
More or less.

442
00:54:55,276 --> 00:54:56,646
We're still gonna need that car.

443
00:54:56,682 --> 00:54:58,149
- <i>Salud!</i>
- <i>Salud!</i>

444
00:55:23,269 --> 00:55:25,240
Where are you taking me?

445
00:55:25,275 --> 00:55:26,435
I'm taking you back
to Mother, darling.

446
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,014
Mother? Oh, no, no, no.

447
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:33,679
Huh. There you are.

448
00:55:42,286 --> 00:55:43,194
No!

449
00:55:50,297 --> 00:55:51,801
Stay there!

450
00:55:51,837 --> 00:55:53,831
- You okay?
- I'm great.

451
00:56:01,872 --> 00:56:04,274
I'm gonna borrow your plane. Sorry.

452
00:56:26,069 --> 00:56:26,864
It's a shortcut.

453
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:43,287
This is my stop. Goodbye.

454
00:56:46,123 --> 00:56:48,056
- You were excellent.
- You too.

455
00:56:48,092 --> 00:56:50,996
- Next time, stay longer.
- I will.

456
00:56:51,031 --> 00:56:52,861
- Hey, a cigar for Felix.
- Thank you. Come on.

457
00:56:52,896 --> 00:56:54,133
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

458
00:57:01,939 --> 00:57:03,571
Come on, let's go.

459
00:57:03,606 --> 00:57:06,541
No, no, no, sir,
I am not getting on that.

460
00:57:06,576 --> 00:57:09,845
Well, that's a shame because
we don't have a choice.

461
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,614
Let's go. Come on.

462
00:57:14,086 --> 00:57:16,555
Okay, okay, what have we got here?

463
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:35,933
Sir, I just saved your life, okay?
Please remember that.

464
00:57:35,969 --> 00:57:39,535
So, could you please tell me
what the hell is going on?

465
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:40,608
Where are you taking me?

466
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,347
Somewhere safe.

467
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:11,936
At least make it look hard.

468
00:58:11,971 --> 00:58:13,377
Thanks, Felix, you walked me
into a trap. Get in.

469
00:58:16,182 --> 00:58:18,775
- What trap?
- Spectre's dead. Sit.

470
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:20,178
- Who's dead?
- All of them.

471
00:58:20,214 --> 00:58:21,220
Good.

472
00:58:23,682 --> 00:58:26,754
What is this? Explain it to me.

473
00:58:26,789 --> 00:58:29,461
I don't have the words to describe
to someone like you.

474
00:58:29,496 --> 00:58:30,361
Try one.

475
00:58:31,863 --> 00:58:34,633
It's perfect.

476
00:58:34,668 --> 00:58:35,964
A perfect what?

477
00:58:35,999 --> 00:58:37,629
What? Assassin.

478
00:58:37,664 --> 00:58:39,601
Thank you, Bond,
your mission's done.

479
00:58:39,637 --> 00:58:40,962
- Why didn't it kill me?
- You don't have to answer

480
00:58:40,998 --> 00:58:43,000
- those questions. Bond!
- Why Spectre?

481
00:58:43,036 --> 00:58:44,641
- Bond, please stop asking these questions.
- Quiet!

482
00:58:44,676 --> 00:58:46,474
Speak up.

483
00:58:46,509 --> 00:58:49,946
Because you were never
the intended target.

484
00:58:49,981 --> 00:58:51,884
He was a target? Why?

485
00:58:51,919 --> 00:58:54,181
I changed the DNA like we decided.

486
00:58:54,216 --> 00:58:55,845
Now the plan is complete

487
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,385
- and I'm confused.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

488
00:58:57,421 --> 00:58:59,385
Who is "we"?
Did M make you build this?

489
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,849
He is out of line here, Felix.

490
00:59:00,884 --> 00:59:02,786
Did M order you to kill Spectre?

491
00:59:02,822 --> 00:59:04,390
- Don't answer that!
- Is M behind this?

492
00:59:04,426 --> 00:59:05,896
- He is out of line!
- Felix!

493
00:59:05,931 --> 00:59:07,626
Ash, shut your mouth!

494
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:09,662
M. M helped me build it.

495
00:59:09,697 --> 00:59:11,698
But please, he does not have
the vision

496
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:14,205
- for how to use it.
- Well, who does? Who does?

497
00:59:14,241 --> 00:59:17,408
Blofeld? How did he know
I was going to be there?

498
00:59:25,245 --> 00:59:26,716
Oh!

499
01:00:14,992 --> 01:00:16,362
I'm with Safin. You understand?

500
01:00:16,397 --> 01:00:18,761
Yes. I am Dr. Obruchev.

501
01:00:18,796 --> 01:00:20,504
I know who you are.

502
01:00:23,272 --> 01:00:24,508
I don't know about you,

503
01:00:26,008 --> 01:00:28,270
but I got a feeling in my gut
Ash might not be on our side.

504
01:00:30,313 --> 01:00:31,741
We need to have a conversation

505
01:00:31,776 --> 01:00:33,148
about the company you keep.

506
01:00:33,183 --> 01:00:34,485
I'm with you.

507
01:00:37,616 --> 01:00:38,357
That's a lot of blood.

508
01:00:42,492 --> 01:00:44,795
So, where are we going?

509
01:00:46,361 --> 01:00:47,724
Get in the plane, Doctor.

510
01:00:47,759 --> 01:00:49,763
This might be my last mission.

511
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:51,498
- What do you think?
- I think you're just looking

512
01:00:51,533 --> 01:00:53,102
for an excuse not to help me.

513
01:00:53,138 --> 01:00:55,130
There you go.

514
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:57,107
Paloma, she gave me a cigar
for you to smoke,

515
01:00:57,142 --> 01:00:58,805
and you are gonna smoke it.

516
01:00:58,841 --> 01:01:01,576
Nice, but maybe you should
hold on to that for now.

517
01:01:01,612 --> 01:01:04,180
You just stay put.
Keep the pressure on that.

518
01:01:04,215 --> 01:01:05,549
I'm gonna find us a way out.

519
01:01:07,546 --> 01:01:09,651
I'll be over here.

520
01:01:09,687 --> 01:01:10,854
You know, Felix, we really
need to stop meeting--

521
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:20,328
- Ooh.
- Okay.

522
01:01:20,363 --> 01:01:22,368
I was such
a big fan of his.

523
01:01:28,906 --> 01:01:30,332
Felix!

524
01:01:43,385 --> 01:01:44,522
This doesn't look good.

525
01:01:46,088 --> 01:01:50,792
Come on, Felix, we've been in
worse than this. Let's go.

526
01:01:50,827 --> 01:01:53,822
It's like back when I was
a kid on that shrimp boat.

527
01:01:53,857 --> 01:01:55,826
You're from Milwaukee.

528
01:01:55,861 --> 01:01:57,601
Am I? I thought I made that up.

529
01:02:04,209 --> 01:02:06,671
He got me.

530
01:02:06,706 --> 01:02:09,011
Just let me go. Let me go.

531
01:02:16,219 --> 01:02:17,423
You got this?

532
01:02:20,453 --> 01:02:21,625
Yeah. Yeah.

533
01:02:24,095 --> 01:02:25,431
Make it worth it.

534
01:02:28,196 --> 01:02:30,233
James,

535
01:02:30,268 --> 01:02:32,570
it's a good life, isn't it?

536
01:02:34,906 --> 01:02:36,442
The best.

537
01:02:40,879 --> 01:02:41,876
Felix.

538
01:02:44,984 --> 01:02:46,650
Felix. Felix.

539
01:05:15,959 --> 01:05:17,198
- Name?
- Bond.

540
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:22,465
James Bond.

541
01:05:27,245 --> 01:05:28,541
How's retirement?

542
01:05:28,576 --> 01:05:29,648
Quiet.

543
01:05:32,284 --> 01:05:35,584
Hi. Where's Obruchev?

544
01:05:35,619 --> 01:05:37,519
I thought you two would get along.

545
01:05:37,554 --> 01:05:39,790
- Report, 007.
- Thank you.

546
01:05:41,158 --> 01:05:42,386
00... 7.

547
01:05:44,296 --> 01:05:45,587
That must bother you.

548
01:05:49,233 --> 01:05:50,433
Where is he?

549
01:05:50,468 --> 01:05:52,135
He left me for somebody else.

550
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:53,603
It's, uh...

551
01:05:53,638 --> 01:05:55,537
- So, you lost him?
- You can go in.

552
01:05:55,572 --> 01:05:57,771
- Thank you.
- Thank y...

553
01:05:57,806 --> 01:05:58,908
Alone, I'm afraid.

554
01:06:00,807 --> 01:06:01,812
Oh, does that bother you?

555
01:06:09,255 --> 01:06:10,452
I get why you shot him.

556
01:06:10,487 --> 01:06:11,421
Yeah, well,

557
01:06:11,456 --> 01:06:13,758
everyone tries at least once.

558
01:06:18,264 --> 01:06:20,765
Has this desk got bigger?

559
01:06:23,302 --> 01:06:24,296
Or have you got smaller?

560
01:06:27,168 --> 01:06:29,438
I can't pretend there
weren't some sorry faces

561
01:06:29,473 --> 01:06:30,672
when you left us, Bond,

562
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:33,642
but you fell so far off the grid

563
01:06:33,678 --> 01:06:34,680
that we thought you must be dead.

564
01:06:36,645 --> 01:06:37,881
Now, learning that you

565
01:06:39,486 --> 01:06:41,687
were, in fact, alive and well, and...

566
01:06:43,554 --> 01:06:45,856
working for the CIA, well...

567
01:06:49,692 --> 01:06:50,923
Well, that really was a blow.

568
01:06:50,959 --> 01:06:53,897
Well, they just asked so nicely.

569
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,132
It's a shame that you
haven't lost your touch.

570
01:06:59,803 --> 01:07:01,069
We wouldn't be in this mess.

571
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:03,874
This is your mess.

572
01:07:06,006 --> 01:07:07,708
Blofeld tried to kill me in Cuba,

573
01:07:07,743 --> 01:07:09,572
but someone hijacked his plan.

574
01:07:10,746 --> 01:07:12,682
And whoever stole your weapon

575
01:07:12,717 --> 01:07:15,551
used it to wipe out Spectre instead.

576
01:07:15,586 --> 01:07:18,622
Now your weapon is on the run

577
01:07:18,657 --> 01:07:21,385
and nobody seems
to know who has it.

578
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,327
So you can imagine
why I've come back to play.

579
01:07:23,362 --> 01:07:24,992
We're looking into it.

580
01:07:25,027 --> 01:07:27,125
I can identify the man
that took Obruchev.

581
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,492
And what do you want
in return, Bond?

582
01:07:29,893 --> 01:07:30,995
Blofeld.

583
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:33,404
Impossible. He's in Belmarsh.

584
01:07:33,439 --> 01:07:35,900
Yes. He ran a Spectre meeting

585
01:07:35,935 --> 01:07:38,142
in Cuba from Belmarsh.

586
01:07:38,178 --> 01:07:39,807
- How?
- No.

587
01:07:39,842 --> 01:07:42,644
How? No one has access. No one.

588
01:07:42,679 --> 01:07:46,375
Why didn't you shut it down?

589
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:48,181
Why didn't you shut Heracles down?

590
01:07:48,217 --> 01:07:51,385
I answer to the interests
of my country, not you.

591
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:54,688
- And to Felix Leiter?
- I certainly don't answer to Felix Leiter.

592
01:07:54,724 --> 01:07:56,586
Perhaps because he's dead.

593
01:08:03,433 --> 01:08:04,770
I'm sorry.

594
01:08:06,903 --> 01:08:08,235
I had a lot of respect for Leiter.

595
01:08:14,409 --> 01:08:17,206
Look, if you have information,
I'd be happy to receive it.

596
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:19,246
- Get me into Belmarsh.
- No.

597
01:08:19,281 --> 01:08:21,850
Blofeld's the only member
of Spectre still breathing,

598
01:08:21,885 --> 01:08:23,247
- I can't risk that.
- Oh, but you will

599
01:08:23,283 --> 01:08:25,788
risk developing a DNA-targeting weapon

600
01:08:25,823 --> 01:08:28,758
with a corrupt scientist for ten years?

601
01:08:28,794 --> 01:08:30,959
There was nothing to suggest
that Obruchev

602
01:08:30,994 --> 01:08:32,960
was working for anyone else.
I had him--

603
01:08:32,996 --> 01:08:34,965
My God, you're thirsty at the moment.

604
01:08:36,901 --> 01:08:39,762
You have no right to speak
to me that way.

605
01:08:39,797 --> 01:08:43,435
You have no right to make
insinuations about my judgment.

606
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:47,769
If you've nothing left to give,
you are irrelevant.

607
01:08:47,805 --> 01:08:49,313
You've done your bit and we thank you
for your service,

608
01:08:49,348 --> 01:08:51,773
again. Goodbye.

609
01:08:53,817 --> 01:08:56,287
Moneypenny, send in 007.

610
01:08:56,322 --> 01:08:57,152
You can go, Bond.

611
01:09:04,794 --> 01:09:06,194
It's definitely the same desk.

612
01:09:11,129 --> 01:09:12,200
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

613
01:09:16,873 --> 01:09:19,006
Go to Belmarsh.

614
01:09:19,042 --> 01:09:21,644
I want everything
that Blofeld listens to,

615
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,812
looks at and touches scanned.

616
01:09:23,847 --> 01:09:25,482
Scan every corner
of that cell.

617
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:27,518
Scan the whole prison.

618
01:09:27,554 --> 01:09:30,311
In fact, scan the whole damn man.

619
01:09:30,347 --> 01:09:32,858
Sir. I'll bring my gloves.

620
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:38,864
James... Uh...

621
01:09:41,325 --> 01:09:42,659
What are you doing for dinner?

622
01:10:12,724 --> 01:10:14,658
- So, you're not dead?
- Hello, Q. I've missed you.

623
01:10:16,164 --> 01:10:18,165
Mm! That smells great.

624
01:10:18,201 --> 01:10:19,900
Were you expecting somebody?

625
01:10:19,935 --> 01:10:22,435
Um... No. What...
Excuse me.

626
01:10:23,704 --> 01:10:25,703
Oh.

627
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:29,371
This is the first time I've...
He'll be here in 20 minutes,

628
01:10:29,406 --> 01:10:30,913
I can't take my focus off...

629
01:10:30,949 --> 01:10:32,682
I need you to tell me what's on that.

630
01:10:32,717 --> 01:10:34,351
No, I need to lay the table.

631
01:10:38,418 --> 01:10:40,983
You know, they come
with fur these days.

632
01:10:41,018 --> 01:10:44,390
I want to be very clear that I am
not authorized to help you.

633
01:10:44,425 --> 01:10:46,360
- And I have sworn...
- It's to do with Heracles.

634
01:10:49,529 --> 01:10:51,593
I presume M doesn't know
that this is happening.

635
01:10:51,628 --> 01:10:54,331
No, but there's something
going on, Q.

636
01:10:54,367 --> 01:10:55,303
We need to find out what it is.

637
01:11:01,638 --> 01:11:02,981
Well, it's never 9:00 to 5:00, is it?

638
01:11:04,483 --> 01:11:06,116
Thank you.

639
01:11:11,382 --> 01:11:13,416
- Um, Bond?
- Yes?

640
01:11:13,452 --> 01:11:14,724
Do you know where this has been?

641
01:11:14,759 --> 01:11:16,159
Everywhere, I should imagine.

642
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:18,590
Into the sandbox.

643
01:11:23,601 --> 01:11:24,761
Oh. Thank you.

644
01:11:27,171 --> 01:11:29,232
Um, it's a database.

645
01:11:29,267 --> 01:11:31,773
Don't touch that, please.

646
01:11:31,808 --> 01:11:33,140
What's the data?

647
01:11:33,175 --> 01:11:35,370
It's DNA. Multiple individuals.

648
01:11:35,405 --> 01:11:37,145
What was M working on?

649
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:38,914
Something he should have
shut down years ago.

650
01:11:38,949 --> 01:11:40,883
- Oh, hello.
- What?

651
01:11:40,918 --> 01:11:43,051
There's more. Hidden files.

652
01:11:43,086 --> 01:11:46,222
I was asked to recover what I could

653
01:11:46,257 --> 01:11:48,893
from Obruchev's hard drive
just after the explosion,

654
01:11:48,928 --> 01:11:50,621
and I have a pretty good
feeling that...

655
01:11:50,656 --> 01:11:54,527
this is what was missing.
Yeah. A complete disk.

656
01:11:59,498 --> 01:12:02,070
So, Obruchev is working
for someone

657
01:12:02,105 --> 01:12:03,605
who managed to kill
all of Spectre?

658
01:12:03,641 --> 01:12:04,966
Not all of them.

659
01:12:06,711 --> 01:12:07,844
Blofeld.

660
01:12:07,879 --> 01:12:09,611
Can you show me the other files?

661
01:12:09,646 --> 01:12:10,873
Mm-hmm.

662
01:12:16,449 --> 01:12:18,683
Wait, this can't just be Spectre.

663
01:12:20,057 --> 01:12:23,655
Oh, my God. There are thousands.

664
01:12:25,498 --> 01:12:26,229
Who are they?

665
01:12:27,699 --> 01:12:29,262
They're in categories.

666
01:12:29,297 --> 01:12:31,295
I'm gonna need more time
to organize...

667
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:33,335
There have been, uh, breaches

668
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:35,799
'round the world of databases
holding DNA information.

669
01:12:37,074 --> 01:12:39,306
- We've been tracking them.
- Ours?

670
01:12:39,341 --> 01:12:40,676
I can't imagine they're
leaving us out,

671
01:12:40,711 --> 01:12:42,671
whoever they are.

672
01:12:42,707 --> 01:12:44,948
Well, Blofeld will know
who they are.

673
01:12:44,983 --> 01:12:46,084
Q, you need to get me
into Belmarsh.

674
01:12:48,846 --> 01:12:51,722
Well, there's only one person
he'll speak to.

675
01:12:51,757 --> 01:12:54,624
Who? M says no one has access.

676
01:12:54,659 --> 01:12:56,493
- Really?
- Did he?

677
01:12:56,528 --> 01:12:58,187
What's that?

678
01:13:00,065 --> 01:13:01,863
Can I just have one nice evening,
please,

679
01:13:01,899 --> 01:13:02,995
before the world explodes?

680
01:13:03,031 --> 01:13:05,235
Who has access? Who?

681
01:13:12,506 --> 01:13:14,174
- Morning.
- Morning.

682
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:17,012
New patient. He's weird.

683
01:13:17,048 --> 01:13:18,611
You can't say that.

684
01:13:24,723 --> 01:13:25,684
I'm sorry I'm late.

685
01:13:28,521 --> 01:13:30,095
I wasn't expecting a new patient.

686
01:13:35,129 --> 01:13:37,729
Sorry if I surprised you.

687
01:13:38,605 --> 01:13:40,534
No. I like surprises.

688
01:13:44,573 --> 01:13:47,537
You're very attractive
for a psychotherapist.

689
01:13:47,573 --> 01:13:49,477
Must be dangerous for your clients.

690
01:13:54,385 --> 01:13:56,121
They are usually more
of a danger to themselves.

691
01:14:00,922 --> 01:14:02,083
Foxgloves.

692
01:14:02,759 --> 01:14:03,887
Beautiful.

693
01:14:05,425 --> 01:14:07,060
- Did you choose them?
- Yes.

694
01:14:07,095 --> 01:14:08,765
I found them friendly.

695
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,594
You know if you eat them

696
01:14:10,629 --> 01:14:12,731
they can cause your heart to just...

697
01:14:15,771 --> 01:14:16,739
stop.

698
01:14:18,008 --> 01:14:19,804
Then I'll make sure not to.

699
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:28,917
Do you know a lot about flowers?

700
01:14:28,952 --> 01:14:31,786
My father had a garden.

701
01:14:31,822 --> 01:14:33,124
He taught me.

702
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:38,328
He died when I was young,
but my interest remained.

703
01:14:39,426 --> 01:14:40,693
It's difficult to lose a parent.

704
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:44,301
Especially at a young age.

705
01:14:45,438 --> 01:14:47,071
Yes,

706
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:50,538
death has a particular effect
on children,

707
01:14:52,138 --> 01:14:52,936
doesn't it?

708
01:14:56,147 --> 01:14:57,611
What effect did it have on you?

709
01:14:58,451 --> 01:14:59,849
Profound.

710
01:14:59,884 --> 01:15:02,385
But I saved a life once.

711
01:15:04,221 --> 01:15:05,718
I think that had more of an effect.

712
01:15:07,659 --> 01:15:08,858
Why is that?

713
01:15:08,893 --> 01:15:11,625
Saving someone's life

714
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:15,464
connects you to them forever,
the same as taking it.

715
01:15:17,495 --> 01:15:18,566
They belong to you.

716
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:26,007
I'm not very good
at talking about myself,

717
01:15:26,043 --> 01:15:28,169
so I brought a memory box.

718
01:15:31,643 --> 01:15:34,319
I thought it might interest you.

719
01:15:34,354 --> 01:15:37,420
Sometimes objects can be more evocative
than memories.

720
01:15:49,398 --> 01:15:52,237
I never forgot your eyes
under the ice.

721
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:55,900
They needed me.

722
01:15:58,574 --> 01:16:01,378
It is a shock to see them
so many years later.

723
01:16:04,047 --> 01:16:05,008
They still need me.

724
01:16:06,248 --> 01:16:08,810
I am rather taken by them.

725
01:16:08,846 --> 01:16:10,783
- What do you want?
- Just a favor.

726
01:16:12,218 --> 01:16:13,082
You owe me.

727
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:16,225
You murdered my mother.

728
01:16:16,261 --> 01:16:19,055
And your father
killed my entire family.

729
01:16:21,798 --> 01:16:23,829
Parents.

730
01:16:23,865 --> 01:16:27,063
I need you to visit someone for me,
wearing this.

731
01:16:28,907 --> 01:16:30,440
It's harmless to you.

732
01:16:35,312 --> 01:16:37,238
You are the only one
who can do it.

733
01:16:38,551 --> 01:16:39,449
No.

734
01:16:40,712 --> 01:16:42,784
Why would I do anything for you?

735
01:16:42,819 --> 01:16:49,193
Because I am a man willing to kill
the person you love most.

736
01:16:49,228 --> 01:16:51,329
I've already lost everyone
I've ever loved.

737
01:16:53,133 --> 01:16:54,563
There is nothing
you can threaten me with.

738
01:16:57,334 --> 01:16:59,502
That is very sad to hear,
Madeleine.

739
01:17:05,339 --> 01:17:06,641
But it is not true...

740
01:17:12,277 --> 01:17:13,351
is it?

741
01:17:21,324 --> 01:17:23,955
Madeleine Swann, really?

742
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:26,593
Well, yes. We took
your information seriously,

743
01:17:26,628 --> 01:17:29,764
but that was five years ago.
Nothing came up.

744
01:17:29,799 --> 01:17:31,726
Well, she's very smart and very good
at hiding things.

745
01:17:31,761 --> 01:17:33,096
She's a useful asset.

746
01:17:33,131 --> 01:17:36,106
She's the only psychiatrist
he agreed to speak to.

747
01:17:36,141 --> 01:17:37,601
I had to exercise
my judgment...

748
01:17:37,636 --> 01:17:38,706
Your judgment is the problem.

749
01:17:40,806 --> 01:17:43,172
That weapon was designed
to save lives

750
01:17:43,207 --> 01:17:45,548
and to eradicate collateral damage
for our agents.

751
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:49,387
A clean, accurate shot every time.

752
01:17:50,716 --> 01:17:52,357
But it had to be off the books.

753
01:17:53,689 --> 01:17:55,888
There are enough holes
in our national security.

754
01:17:57,792 --> 01:17:59,623
If the world knows
what this can do...

755
01:17:59,658 --> 01:18:01,498
- They'd kill for it.
- Mm.

756
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:03,533
Look...

757
01:18:05,868 --> 01:18:10,232
If it's an error, it's on my shoulders,
fair and square.

758
01:18:12,577 --> 01:18:14,511
I've dedicated my life
to defending this country.

759
01:18:16,382 --> 01:18:18,781
I believe in defending
the principles of this...

760
01:18:18,816 --> 01:18:20,176
Of this.

761
01:18:22,478 --> 01:18:24,648
But we used to be able to get
into a room with the enemy,

762
01:18:24,683 --> 01:18:25,588
we could look him in the eye.

763
01:18:26,859 --> 01:18:27,755
And now the...

764
01:18:30,329 --> 01:18:33,626
The enemy
is just floating in the ether.

765
01:18:33,662 --> 01:18:34,597
We don't even know
what they're after.

766
01:18:35,866 --> 01:18:37,061
Blofeld.

767
01:18:38,867 --> 01:18:41,232
We managed to access
a database of their targets.

768
01:18:41,267 --> 01:18:42,407
"We"?

769
01:18:44,669 --> 01:18:45,773
Oh, for fuck's sake.

770
01:18:47,372 --> 01:18:48,446
I see.

771
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,449
And after Blofeld,
what do they want?

772
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,647
Well, it's hard to say.

773
01:18:54,683 --> 01:18:56,213
I mean,
I would imagine world leaders,

774
01:18:56,248 --> 01:18:59,420
innocent civilians, freedom,
you know, that sort of thing.

775
01:18:59,455 --> 01:19:02,156
Oh, good,
well, just the usual.

776
01:19:02,191 --> 01:19:03,892
Just the usual.

777
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:10,665
Blofeld was communicating
with his agents in Cuba

778
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:14,267
through a bionic eye
which we've now retrieved.

779
01:19:14,302 --> 01:19:16,838
You're welcome.

780
01:19:16,873 --> 01:19:20,876
Spectre's destruction's going
to have huge consequences.

781
01:19:20,912 --> 01:19:23,877
Whoever did this is going to be
very dangerous and very powerful.

782
01:19:26,552 --> 01:19:29,081
We need all the information
that we can gather.

783
01:19:29,117 --> 01:19:30,312
Sir.

784
01:19:31,616 --> 01:19:32,457
Sir.

785
01:19:34,452 --> 01:19:35,493
Bond.

786
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,290
So the rumors are true.
You look well.

787
01:19:39,325 --> 01:19:40,421
Tanner.

788
01:19:41,597 --> 01:19:43,127
Sir, there's been a development.

789
01:19:45,633 --> 01:19:47,268
They were just dropping,

790
01:19:47,304 --> 01:19:48,404
one right after the other.

791
01:19:48,439 --> 01:19:51,705
It was disturbing,
to say the least.

792
01:19:51,741 --> 01:19:54,135
Wait till you see what it looks like
up close.

793
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:57,108
- Uh, Bond's in the office.
- What?

794
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:04,420
Oh, Bond. My God, I haven't
seen you in, in, uh...

795
01:20:04,455 --> 01:20:06,255
- How is your retirement?
- Shut up, Q.

796
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:08,083
I know he's staying with you.

797
01:20:08,118 --> 01:20:09,891
And you're not
in the clear either.

798
01:20:09,926 --> 01:20:11,925
- What happened?
- He's been reinstated as a double-0.

799
01:20:14,597 --> 01:20:16,534
- Double-0 what?
- What have you got?

800
01:20:19,537 --> 01:20:21,337
Q has studied the blood sample
I gathered

801
01:20:21,372 --> 01:20:23,138
from the victims of the funeral.

802
01:20:23,173 --> 01:20:25,166
Just look at this.

803
01:20:25,201 --> 01:20:27,276
What are we looking at?

804
01:20:27,311 --> 01:20:28,610
This is the funeral

805
01:20:28,645 --> 01:20:31,174
of one of the dead Spectre agents
from Cuba.

806
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:33,075
And here are
the members of their family

807
01:20:33,111 --> 01:20:36,181
who made physical contact
with the corpse.

808
01:20:36,216 --> 01:20:38,688
We found Heracles in the blood samples
of all of them.

809
01:20:41,019 --> 01:20:42,918
Now, that's some good work, Nomi.

810
01:20:42,953 --> 01:20:44,924
Thank you, sir. Double-0 what?

811
01:20:44,959 --> 01:20:48,291
- What are they?
- They're... They're nanobots.

812
01:20:49,868 --> 01:20:51,261
Right.

813
01:20:51,296 --> 01:20:53,634
Microscopic bio-robots
that can enter your system

814
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:55,067
by the slightest contact
with your skin.

815
01:21:00,976 --> 01:21:04,813
Programmed with DNA
to target specific individuals.

816
01:21:06,084 --> 01:21:07,552
Heracles was...

817
01:21:09,383 --> 01:21:13,356
It was designed to be the most efficient
weapon in our arsenal.

818
01:21:13,392 --> 01:21:15,359
Passing through people harmlessly

819
01:21:15,394 --> 01:21:17,724
before reaching its intended target.

820
01:21:17,759 --> 01:21:20,026
But Obruchev
modified the nanobots

821
01:21:20,061 --> 01:21:22,190
so that they can kill anyone
related to the target.

822
01:21:22,225 --> 01:21:24,125
- Anyone?
- Well, since it's DNA-based,

823
01:21:24,161 --> 01:21:25,603
with further modifications, yes.

824
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:29,737
Families, certain genetic traits.

825
01:21:29,772 --> 01:21:32,466
Single-nucleotide variants
and polymorphisms

826
01:21:32,501 --> 01:21:35,210
that could target a range
from individuals to...

827
01:21:35,245 --> 01:21:36,537
whole ethnicities.

828
01:21:37,414 --> 01:21:38,975
You infect enough people...

829
01:21:39,011 --> 01:21:41,048
And the people become the weapon.

830
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:43,720
It was never intended to be
a weapon of mass destruction.

831
01:21:45,781 --> 01:21:46,624
It was...

832
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,958
I need to call the Prime Minister.

833
01:21:52,291 --> 01:21:54,758
Tanner, quarantine
the families from the funeral.

834
01:21:54,794 --> 01:21:56,398
- Yes, sir.
- And, Q,

835
01:21:56,434 --> 01:21:58,399
hack into Blofeld's bionic eye,

836
01:21:58,434 --> 01:21:59,560
see what you can find.

837
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:02,904
You've got your wish.

838
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:05,737
Go to Blofeld and see
what you can get out of him.

839
01:22:05,773 --> 01:22:07,777
And find that cockroach Obruchev.

840
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:09,746
Sir.

841
01:22:13,416 --> 01:22:15,883
We don't have a trail.

842
01:22:15,919 --> 01:22:19,290
Logan Ash. State Department.
Ex-State Department.

843
01:22:19,325 --> 01:22:21,221
Find him, you'll find Obruchev.

844
01:22:21,256 --> 01:22:22,451
Um...

845
01:22:23,622 --> 01:22:25,128
Good luck.

846
01:22:25,163 --> 01:22:27,423
Thanks.

847
01:22:53,491 --> 01:22:54,721
I'll be outside
when you're done

848
01:22:54,757 --> 01:22:56,287
with your important preparation.

849
01:22:59,264 --> 01:23:00,291
I'll be just a moment.

850
01:23:01,693 --> 01:23:02,766
It's fine.

851
01:23:22,347 --> 01:23:24,020
<i>Blofeld's eyeball unlocked.</i>

852
01:23:28,791 --> 01:23:31,553
<i>Accessing received media stream.</i>

853
01:23:32,696 --> 01:23:34,929
I know you
and she have a history,

854
01:23:34,965 --> 01:23:38,125
but we've kept a close eye
on her over the years.

855
01:23:38,161 --> 01:23:39,668
She's been very compliant.

856
01:23:39,703 --> 01:23:41,163
If Bond does anything weird
in there,

857
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:42,770
you'll be doing me a huge favor,

858
01:23:42,806 --> 01:23:44,832
so don't make it too easy
for him, okay?

859
01:23:44,867 --> 01:23:46,335
Okay.

860
01:23:46,371 --> 01:23:49,479
He's the most valuable asset
this country has.

861
01:23:49,515 --> 01:23:51,273
I know you and he
have a history,

862
01:23:51,308 --> 01:23:54,342
but don't let him get
in your head.

863
01:23:54,377 --> 01:23:55,977
If you feel yourself
losing control...

864
01:23:56,012 --> 01:23:59,113
Oh, Tanner, relax.

865
01:23:59,148 --> 01:24:00,483
I'm not gonna lose...

866
01:24:05,492 --> 01:24:06,764
control.

867
01:24:12,602 --> 01:24:14,468
Dr. Swann, good afternoon.

868
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:21,504
Mr. Bond.

869
01:24:26,018 --> 01:24:27,279
007.

870
01:24:32,255 --> 01:24:35,423
<i>Six-seven. Special cell two
now locked off.</i>

871
01:24:40,630 --> 01:24:42,995
<i>Segregation unit secure.</i>

872
01:24:43,031 --> 01:24:45,433
This is where we leave you.
Good luck.

873
01:24:45,469 --> 01:24:46,804
Just get us a name.

874
01:24:54,276 --> 01:24:57,815
Must be nice to catch up with an old friend
so regularly.

875
01:24:59,783 --> 01:25:02,045
We're closer than ever.

876
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,950
Oh, that was awkward.

877
01:25:03,985 --> 01:25:05,421
Does he have that effect
on all women?

878
01:25:05,456 --> 01:25:07,754
Fifty-fifty.

879
01:25:07,789 --> 01:25:08,755
- It's unpredictable.
- Huh.

880
01:25:12,092 --> 01:25:13,798
<i>Isolated in HSU.</i>

881
01:25:22,837 --> 01:25:23,907
You're shaking.

882
01:25:25,609 --> 01:25:27,174
It's not an ideal situation.

883
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:58,799
Open the door.

884
01:26:00,103 --> 01:26:01,043
Open the door!

885
01:26:02,546 --> 01:26:04,376
- Don't.
- What is it?

886
01:26:05,882 --> 01:26:08,886
James, you don't know what this is.

887
01:26:10,114 --> 01:26:11,451
Don't make me do this.

888
01:26:11,486 --> 01:26:13,324
Please.

889
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:14,590
Right. Open the doors.

890
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:16,325
- <i>Open the door.</i>
- Open it.

891
01:26:16,361 --> 01:26:17,492
What...

892
01:26:20,861 --> 01:26:21,899
Where are you going?

893
01:26:23,234 --> 01:26:24,297
Home.

894
01:26:28,334 --> 01:26:30,037
- I'll get her.
- Wait.

895
01:26:30,072 --> 01:26:32,074
- He won't talk without her.
- Just wait.

896
01:26:34,577 --> 01:26:35,341
Special delivery.

897
01:26:52,395 --> 01:26:52,930
James.

898
01:26:54,190 --> 01:26:54,899
Hello, Blofeld.

899
01:26:57,667 --> 01:27:00,102
Perhaps you can help me.

900
01:27:02,573 --> 01:27:04,335
Cuba was quite the party.

901
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:07,140
- Happy birthday, by the way.
- Thank you.

902
01:27:07,175 --> 01:27:09,078
I'm trying to piece together
what happened.

903
01:27:10,706 --> 01:27:12,881
I mean, there you were,
or here you were,

904
01:27:12,916 --> 01:27:15,315
with the world's
most powerful people,

905
01:27:15,351 --> 01:27:19,320
your friends, all in one room,
a noose around my neck,

906
01:27:19,355 --> 01:27:21,926
and your hands on the most
valuable weapon in existence.

907
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,719
It's like a...

908
01:27:25,754 --> 01:27:29,395
It was like a testimony
to your greatness.

909
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:33,836
A celebration of all
that is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

910
01:27:33,871 --> 01:27:35,731
Yeah, James.

911
01:27:37,374 --> 01:27:39,402
Yeah.

912
01:27:39,438 --> 01:27:41,946
But then it all went wrong,
didn't it?

913
01:27:43,947 --> 01:27:47,179
My sweet James,
what do you want?

914
01:27:47,214 --> 01:27:48,612
Your enemies
are closing in, Blofeld.

915
01:27:50,446 --> 01:27:52,118
And the biggest twist here

916
01:27:52,153 --> 01:27:54,222
is that if you tell me
who they are,

917
01:27:55,626 --> 01:27:57,219
I could save your life.

918
01:27:57,254 --> 01:28:00,387
Mm, my avenging angel.

919
01:28:00,422 --> 01:28:02,928
My chaser of lost causes.

920
01:28:02,963 --> 01:28:05,934
Now you even chase mine.

921
01:28:05,969 --> 01:28:07,737
But you're asking
the wrong question.

922
01:28:07,773 --> 01:28:10,365
Yeah, Cuba was a disappointment,

923
01:28:10,401 --> 01:28:13,140
but we all cry on our birthday.

924
01:28:13,175 --> 01:28:14,972
<i>You need to ask yourself,</i>

925
01:28:15,007 --> 01:28:17,443
<i>why are we here?</i>

926
01:28:17,478 --> 01:28:19,984
<i>Accessing media file 472.</i>

927
01:28:21,851 --> 01:28:23,950
Hmm. Looking sharp, Bond.

928
01:28:23,985 --> 01:28:25,253
<i>473.</i>

929
01:28:26,621 --> 01:28:27,992
<i>474.</i>

930
01:28:29,426 --> 01:28:31,193
<i>475.</i>

931
01:28:32,992 --> 01:28:36,198
<i>476, 477, 478.</i>

932
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:41,962
<i>479.</i>

933
01:28:50,013 --> 01:28:52,406
<i>Logan Ash. A pleasure to meet you.</i>

934
01:28:52,441 --> 01:28:53,640
Oh, my God, that's him.

935
01:28:53,675 --> 01:28:55,415
<i>I am sorry for your loss.</i>

936
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:58,182
<i>I believe you know who I represent
and work for?</i>

937
01:28:58,217 --> 01:29:00,447
<i>We have an opportunity for you.</i>

938
01:29:01,421 --> 01:29:02,683
<i>You keep coming back to me.</i>

939
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,421
<i>I thought I'd never see you again,</i>

940
01:29:04,456 --> 01:29:05,959
<i>but fate draws us back together.</i>

941
01:29:05,995 --> 01:29:08,230
Yes. Q's got eyes on Logan Ash.

942
01:29:09,325 --> 01:29:10,600
- Go.
- Yep.

943
01:29:10,635 --> 01:29:12,099
Let me know what happens.

944
01:29:12,135 --> 01:29:13,602
<i>Now your enemy is my enemy.</i>

945
01:29:13,638 --> 01:29:15,034
How did that happen?

946
01:29:15,069 --> 01:29:17,303
Well, you live long enough...

947
01:29:17,338 --> 01:29:19,972
Yeah. Look at us.

948
01:29:20,007 --> 01:29:21,440
Two old men in a hole

949
01:29:21,475 --> 01:29:23,509
trying to work out
who's playing tricks on us.

950
01:29:27,315 --> 01:29:30,052
She still loves you.
Did you know that?

951
01:29:30,088 --> 01:29:32,049
And you broke her heart.
And she betrayed you.

952
01:29:32,084 --> 01:29:33,824
She is irrelevant.

953
01:29:33,859 --> 01:29:37,326
Mm, I wouldn't be
so quick to dismiss.

954
01:29:37,361 --> 01:29:40,460
You said it yourself, she's very good
at hiding things.

955
01:29:40,496 --> 01:29:44,865
And when her secret finds its way out,
and it will,

956
01:29:44,901 --> 01:29:46,294
it'll be the death of you.

957
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:48,462
Just give me a name.

958
01:29:48,497 --> 01:29:50,301
Madeleine.

959
01:29:50,337 --> 01:29:53,209
Please, just...
Please, no games.

960
01:29:54,842 --> 01:29:55,871
Madeleine.

961
01:29:58,174 --> 01:30:00,815
Oh, do you know what? The two
of you should come see me.

962
01:30:00,850 --> 01:30:03,077
A little couples therapy.

963
01:30:03,113 --> 01:30:06,021
I simply have to see your face
when she tells you the truth.

964
01:30:06,056 --> 01:30:09,258
Just tell me who they are, Blofeld...

965
01:30:11,559 --> 01:30:13,928
and then I'll leave.
I'll leave you on your own.

966
01:30:13,963 --> 01:30:16,063
No, I don't want you to leave.

967
01:30:16,099 --> 01:30:17,299
We're just getting reacquainted.

968
01:30:23,774 --> 01:30:25,472
Hmm. All right. Come.

969
01:30:27,202 --> 01:30:30,710
You were unusually patient.
I need to give you something

970
01:30:30,745 --> 01:30:33,117
so that you didn't have to make
all this way for nothing. Come.

971
01:30:39,624 --> 01:30:40,388
Careful, Bond.

972
01:30:41,592 --> 01:30:42,159
It was me.

973
01:30:44,326 --> 01:30:46,860
- You destroyed Spectre?
- No.

974
01:30:46,895 --> 01:30:49,098
Vesper's grave.

975
01:30:49,133 --> 01:30:50,965
Madeleine didn't do a thing.
It was all me.

976
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,201
I knew you'd come visit it,

977
01:30:53,237 --> 01:30:56,035
I just needed to wait
for the <i>bon moment.</i>

978
01:30:56,071 --> 01:30:57,401
She led you straight there

979
01:30:57,436 --> 01:30:59,567
from the goodness
of her heart.

980
01:30:59,602 --> 01:31:02,572
And then you left her, for me.

981
01:31:02,607 --> 01:31:04,946
- It doesn't matter.
- Oh, but it does.

982
01:31:04,981 --> 01:31:06,749
She still does, doesn't she?

983
01:31:06,784 --> 01:31:08,944
My poor little cuckoo.

984
01:31:10,418 --> 01:31:13,322
You were always so very,
very sensitive.

985
01:31:16,794 --> 01:31:17,758
<i>This isn't working.</i>

986
01:31:17,793 --> 01:31:19,126
Keep going.

987
01:31:19,161 --> 01:31:20,962
<i>All this wasted time,</i>

988
01:31:20,997 --> 01:31:23,066
the life you could have had.

989
01:31:23,101 --> 01:31:25,801
And the reason all of this
is so beautiful,

990
01:31:25,836 --> 01:31:27,830
so exquisitely beautiful,

991
01:31:27,866 --> 01:31:30,403
is that you're coming
to me looking for answers,

992
01:31:30,439 --> 01:31:33,440
whereas the one person
who knows it all is she.

993
01:31:33,475 --> 01:31:36,980
It's Madeleine. She holds
the secrets you need.

994
01:31:37,016 --> 01:31:39,639
All of them.
I didn't need to kill you.

995
01:31:39,674 --> 01:31:41,314
I'd already broken you.

996
01:31:41,349 --> 01:31:43,451
I wanted to give you
an empty world...

997
01:31:44,987 --> 01:31:47,255
like the one you gave me.

998
01:31:47,290 --> 01:31:49,017
It's enough to almost make me
regret it.

999
01:31:50,386 --> 01:31:51,360
Eh, almost.

1000
01:31:59,968 --> 01:32:00,732
Die.

1001
01:32:02,707 --> 01:32:03,339
Hmm?

1002
01:32:06,209 --> 01:32:08,338
Die, Blofeld. Die.

1003
01:32:08,373 --> 01:32:09,741
Jesus. Open the door.

1004
01:32:11,676 --> 01:32:14,284
Bond! Bond! Bond!

1005
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:18,184
Open the door. Bond!

1006
01:32:18,219 --> 01:32:19,846
Cuckoo.

1007
01:32:19,881 --> 01:32:21,048
What the hell
are you thinking?

1008
01:32:21,083 --> 01:32:22,787
Yes, yes, yes, I know how
to interrogate an asset.

1009
01:32:22,823 --> 01:32:25,657
- This interrogation is over.
- Tanner, don't lecture me!

1010
01:32:25,693 --> 01:32:28,062
Bond, you have violated
the most important rule

1011
01:32:28,097 --> 01:32:29,631
in the whole bloody playbook.

1012
01:32:36,267 --> 01:32:37,340
Don't move.

1013
01:32:47,614 --> 01:32:49,451
I'm... I'm gonna need those,
I'm afraid.

1014
01:33:01,457 --> 01:33:02,266
He's dead.

1015
01:33:04,863 --> 01:33:07,100
It's a good thing
you're not actually related,

1016
01:33:07,135 --> 01:33:08,228
or you'd be dead too.

1017
01:33:09,870 --> 01:33:12,034
- How do I get this off?
- Oh, you don't. You can't.

1018
01:33:14,102 --> 01:33:17,173
Nanobots aren't just
for Christmas.

1019
01:33:17,208 --> 01:33:21,142
Once Heracles is in your system,
it's there forever.

1020
01:33:26,957 --> 01:33:28,421
Did they find the car?

1021
01:33:28,456 --> 01:33:30,458
We traced it,
but she abandoned it.

1022
01:33:30,493 --> 01:33:32,428
They searched her flat,
she hasn't been home.

1023
01:33:33,989 --> 01:33:36,190
- Is she one of them?
- I don't know.

1024
01:33:36,226 --> 01:33:40,062
James, do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

1025
01:33:41,907 --> 01:33:43,934
No. I don't know her at all.

1026
01:34:30,813 --> 01:34:32,213
Is that for me?

1027
01:34:34,626 --> 01:34:35,623
No.

1028
01:34:38,622 --> 01:34:39,990
Then why did you come?

1029
01:34:41,229 --> 01:34:42,564
Because you told me to.

1030
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,002
I didn't think you would remember.

1031
01:34:47,037 --> 01:34:48,934
I remember everything.

1032
01:34:48,969 --> 01:34:51,331
You need to tell me who gave you
the poison, Madeleine.

1033
01:34:53,536 --> 01:34:54,576
Is he dead?

1034
01:34:55,979 --> 01:34:57,007
Yes, he's dead.

1035
01:34:58,144 --> 01:34:59,339
Good.

1036
01:35:02,352 --> 01:35:03,552
He told me you didn't betray me.

1037
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:07,556
I understand you're not built
to trust people.

1038
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:12,858
- Neither are you.
- Then we were fools for trying.

1039
01:35:14,029 --> 01:35:15,355
I wanted to.

1040
01:35:22,572 --> 01:35:24,540
I don't know if you wanted me
to come here,

1041
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:27,969
or why you tried to kill Blofeld,

1042
01:35:28,004 --> 01:35:29,477
or who gave you the poison to do it,

1043
01:35:29,512 --> 01:35:30,637
or how long you've been
working for them,

1044
01:35:30,673 --> 01:35:32,042
but I do know...

1045
01:35:34,881 --> 01:35:39,352
that for what felt like five minutes
of my life

1046
01:35:39,387 --> 01:35:41,524
I wanted everything with you.

1047
01:35:44,262 --> 01:35:46,430
And it's not because I didn't trust.

1048
01:35:49,396 --> 01:35:51,094
It was just that feeling.

1049
01:35:55,905 --> 01:35:58,442
I know I've come here to find out
who gave you the poison.

1050
01:36:00,435 --> 01:36:02,446
But I'm not going to leave here
without you knowing

1051
01:36:03,949 --> 01:36:05,647
that I have loved you,

1052
01:36:07,249 --> 01:36:09,210
and I will love you,

1053
01:36:09,245 --> 01:36:13,087
and I do not regret
a single moment of my life

1054
01:36:13,123 --> 01:36:14,216
that led me to you.

1055
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:18,924
Except when I put you
on that train.

1056
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,425
Do you know the worst thing about you?

1057
01:36:27,773 --> 01:36:28,901
My timing?

1058
01:36:31,468 --> 01:36:32,476
Don't.

1059
01:36:41,183 --> 01:36:43,245
My sense of humor?

1060
01:36:44,756 --> 01:36:45,654
Don't.

1061
01:36:49,951 --> 01:36:52,423
- What?
- You look...

1062
01:36:52,459 --> 01:36:53,695
You look incredible.

1063
01:37:06,375 --> 01:37:08,138
This is Mathilde.

1064
01:37:09,979 --> 01:37:11,306
Um...

1065
01:37:12,181 --> 01:37:13,915
Hello. I'm James.

1066
01:37:31,569 --> 01:37:35,501
Sir, we've located Logan Ash.
007 wants a word.

1067
01:37:35,537 --> 01:37:37,504
- Well done, 007.
- Thank you, sir.

1068
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:39,442
Permission for a capture or kill.

1069
01:37:39,477 --> 01:37:40,742
Have we cleared this
with the Americans?

1070
01:37:42,412 --> 01:37:44,541
Granted. And thank you for asking.

1071
01:37:44,576 --> 01:37:46,779
By the book, sir.

1072
01:37:46,815 --> 01:37:48,508
Well, your predecessor
was less deferential.

1073
01:37:49,752 --> 01:37:53,522
To be fair, Commander Bond
gave me the lead.

1074
01:37:53,558 --> 01:37:55,983
Well, I'm glad to see you two
getting along.

1075
01:37:56,019 --> 01:37:57,523
<i>Sir.</i>

1076
01:37:57,558 --> 01:37:58,595
Have you located Dr. Swann?

1077
01:37:59,988 --> 01:38:01,721
Nothing, I'm afraid, sir.

1078
01:38:01,757 --> 01:38:02,566
Thank you.

1079
01:38:32,857 --> 01:38:33,729
She's not yours.

1080
01:38:35,759 --> 01:38:37,057
But, um, the...

1081
01:38:37,092 --> 01:38:38,393
Okay, the blue eyes, the...

1082
01:38:40,071 --> 01:38:41,363
She's not yours.

1083
01:38:43,875 --> 01:38:44,641
Okay.

1084
01:38:46,409 --> 01:38:47,369
I have something to show you.

1085
01:38:51,082 --> 01:38:52,443
Another child?

1086
01:39:04,124 --> 01:39:07,029
What is it with your dad
and secret rooms?

1087
01:39:07,064 --> 01:39:07,763
Talk to me.

1088
01:39:09,433 --> 01:39:10,634
I wanted to bring you here before.

1089
01:39:12,302 --> 01:39:13,637
To tell you everything.

1090
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:16,767
Blofeld ordered my father

1091
01:39:16,802 --> 01:39:18,602
to assassinate this family.

1092
01:39:18,637 --> 01:39:20,303
The boy survived.

1093
01:39:22,445 --> 01:39:23,647
His name is Lyutsifer Safin.

1094
01:39:28,281 --> 01:39:30,654
When I was a little girl,
he came here to kill my father.

1095
01:39:32,821 --> 01:39:34,691
But he found me
and my mother instead.

1096
01:39:37,326 --> 01:39:38,024
He spared my life.

1097
01:39:40,626 --> 01:39:42,431
And now he's back.

1098
01:39:42,467 --> 01:39:44,866
- And what does he want?
- Revenge.

1099
01:39:47,202 --> 01:39:48,199
Me.

1100
01:39:54,271 --> 01:39:57,073
- Who were they?
- Spectre's poisoners.

1101
01:39:57,108 --> 01:39:59,141
My father held
a banquet for them,

1102
01:39:59,177 --> 01:40:01,808
used their own recipe in the dessert.

1103
01:40:01,843 --> 01:40:02,785
Dioxin.

1104
01:40:04,654 --> 01:40:06,618
They would have suffered horribly.

1105
01:40:06,653 --> 01:40:07,823
Scarred him for life.

1106
01:40:09,524 --> 01:40:10,727
The family had an island.

1107
01:40:12,530 --> 01:40:14,654
They called it the Poison Garden.

1108
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,590
Oh, so...

1109
01:40:17,625 --> 01:40:19,901
Blofeld took it from them,
and kept running it,

1110
01:40:21,638 --> 01:40:23,465
and now this Safin
has taken it back.

1111
01:40:29,479 --> 01:40:32,946
Q, find one Lyutsifer Safin.

1112
01:40:32,981 --> 01:40:35,477
Whereabouts unknown
and no recent photographs,

1113
01:40:35,512 --> 01:40:38,184
but I'm gonna send you
some images of him as a boy.

1114
01:40:38,219 --> 01:40:42,186
And a picture of an island.
So, you know, do your best.

1115
01:40:42,222 --> 01:40:44,728
And I'm gonna need a plane
to get there, a big one.

1116
01:40:48,764 --> 01:40:50,195
I'll send you my location shortly.

1117
01:40:54,932 --> 01:40:56,498
You're going to find him?

1118
01:40:59,207 --> 01:41:02,108
There are a thousand reasons
why we need to find this man.

1119
01:41:04,582 --> 01:41:06,750
You just gave me a reason
to kill him.

1120
01:41:42,617 --> 01:41:43,149
How is it?

1121
01:41:57,828 --> 01:41:59,400
Excuse me.

1122
01:41:59,435 --> 01:42:00,800
- Yes?
- Bond.

1123
01:42:00,836 --> 01:42:02,438
<i>Did you find the island?</i>

1124
01:42:02,473 --> 01:42:04,697
<i>Yes, it's part of a chain</i>

1125
01:42:04,733 --> 01:42:07,033
<i>in disputed waters between Japan and Russia.</i>

1126
01:42:07,069 --> 01:42:10,976
<i>There's a chemical plant dating back
to the Second World War,</i>

1127
01:42:11,012 --> 01:42:12,579
<i>seems to have had quite a history.</i>

1128
01:42:12,615 --> 01:42:14,982
Sir, Japanese intelligence

1129
01:42:15,017 --> 01:42:17,052
have reported suspicious
activity on the island.

1130
01:42:17,087 --> 01:42:20,821
Q, bring up the satellite images
I just sent through.

1131
01:42:20,857 --> 01:42:22,485
These were taken
over the last few days.

1132
01:42:25,524 --> 01:42:28,489
- If that is Safin there...
- Then Heracles is there too.

1133
01:42:28,525 --> 01:42:30,228
<i>Where do you need this plane, Bond?</i>

1134
01:42:30,263 --> 01:42:33,232
Hang on, Q. Did 007 manage
to locate Logan Ash?

1135
01:42:33,267 --> 01:42:35,839
She's closing in on him.
I'll send you her location.

1136
01:42:44,146 --> 01:42:46,811
I thought she was following
Logan Ash, not me.

1137
01:42:46,846 --> 01:42:48,310
<i>What? She is.</i>

1138
01:42:48,345 --> 01:42:49,886
<i>James, where are you?</i>

1139
01:42:54,956 --> 01:42:56,222
Put her in the back.

1140
01:42:57,862 --> 01:42:59,654
There you are. In here.
Watch your head.

1141
01:43:13,978 --> 01:43:16,643
Q, I am gonna
need that plane, quickly.

1142
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:18,042
I'm near Orland NATO base.

1143
01:43:18,077 --> 01:43:19,507
You think
you can get it to me?

1144
01:43:19,542 --> 01:43:21,044
<i>Right. Right, yes. We'll be there.</i>

1145
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:23,986
- Thank you.
- Mama.

1146
01:44:29,286 --> 01:44:30,580
James.

1147
01:44:43,999 --> 01:44:44,968
Mathilde!

1148
01:45:54,299 --> 01:45:55,071
They're above us!

1149
01:46:23,065 --> 01:46:25,068
Get out of here! James!

1150
01:48:02,831 --> 01:48:03,793
You stay here.

1151
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:07,169
I'll be back soon.

1152
01:48:07,205 --> 01:48:09,737
Anybody comes through
that door, you shoot them.

1153
01:48:09,772 --> 01:48:10,536
Unless it's me.

1154
01:48:12,439 --> 01:48:14,342
You be quiet, okay?
Stay really quiet.

1155
01:49:30,688 --> 01:49:31,716
Hey!

1156
01:49:47,296 --> 01:49:48,370
Go! Go!

1157
01:49:55,307 --> 01:49:56,103
There! Run him over!

1158
01:50:24,238 --> 01:50:25,935
Nice moves, Bond.

1159
01:50:27,473 --> 01:50:29,477
You won't be able
to stop him...

1160
01:50:32,116 --> 01:50:34,276
...so why don't you help
me out, brother?

1161
01:50:34,312 --> 01:50:35,483
I had a brother.

1162
01:50:38,153 --> 01:50:39,355
His name was Felix Leiter.

1163
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:02,834
Need a ride?

1164
01:52:04,403 --> 01:52:06,165
Where have you been?

1165
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,202
Chasing after your lead.

1166
01:52:11,607 --> 01:52:13,614
- Ash?
- Dead.

1167
01:52:16,844 --> 01:52:17,948
They took Dr. Swann.

1168
01:52:19,087 --> 01:52:20,379
And her daughter.

1169
01:52:22,887 --> 01:52:25,993
I... I didn't know
she had a daughter.

1170
01:52:26,029 --> 01:52:27,430
Did M get my plane?

1171
01:52:28,924 --> 01:52:31,291
Our plane. I'm coming with you.

1172
01:52:34,069 --> 01:52:35,636
Thank you, 007.

1173
01:52:59,326 --> 01:53:01,629
- Hello, Q.
- Bond.

1174
01:53:03,498 --> 01:53:04,665
Sorry to get you out of bed.

1175
01:53:06,966 --> 01:53:09,700
<i>The objectives of this mission
are threefold.</i>

1176
01:53:09,735 --> 01:53:11,930
<i>Confirm the presence of Heracles.</i>

1177
01:53:11,966 --> 01:53:13,936
<i>Kill Obruchev and Safin.</i>

1178
01:53:13,972 --> 01:53:17,103
<i>Get Dr. Swann and her daughte
off the island.</i>

1179
01:53:17,138 --> 01:53:19,938
<i>And, Bond, I hope they're there.</i>

1180
01:53:19,973 --> 01:53:22,309
- Thank you, sir.
- Sir.

1181
01:53:24,820 --> 01:53:27,655
Permission for Commander Bond
to be redesignated as 007.

1182
01:53:31,094 --> 01:53:32,059
It's just a number.

1183
01:53:32,095 --> 01:53:33,628
<i>Very well. Agreed.</i>

1184
01:53:35,294 --> 01:53:36,756
<i>Good luck.</i>

1185
01:53:36,791 --> 01:53:38,358
Bond, your watch.

1186
01:53:41,539 --> 01:53:45,738
It contains a limited-radius
electromagnetic pulse.

1187
01:53:45,773 --> 01:53:47,904
It'll short any circuit
in a hardwired network

1188
01:53:47,939 --> 01:53:49,512
- if you get close enough.
- Mm-hmm.

1189
01:53:51,312 --> 01:53:52,548
And how strong is it?

1190
01:53:53,512 --> 01:53:56,075
It's fairly strong.

1191
01:53:56,110 --> 01:53:57,676
"Fairly strong,"
what's that mean?

1192
01:53:57,711 --> 01:53:59,720
We haven't had the chance to
test it properly, just be careful.

1193
01:54:00,948 --> 01:54:03,151
Right, this is Q-DAR.

1194
01:54:03,186 --> 01:54:04,725
It will map the space
as you move through it.

1195
01:54:07,558 --> 01:54:08,487
Don't touch that.

1196
01:54:10,191 --> 01:54:13,200
And smart blood
will track you...

1197
01:54:13,235 --> 01:54:14,966
Whoops. And your vitals.

1198
01:54:21,976 --> 01:54:24,676
Bond, you don't mind a shot or two
whilst at work?

1199
01:54:24,712 --> 01:54:26,180
- Shall we?
- Well, I haven't had a drink

1200
01:54:26,215 --> 01:54:27,807
for three or four hou...

1201
01:54:27,842 --> 01:54:29,715
- Hours.
- Wow.

1202
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:32,346
Doesn't sound like you.

1203
01:54:35,058 --> 01:54:37,316
- Ow!
- Good.

1204
01:54:37,352 --> 01:54:38,950
I assume you know
how the stealthy bird works.

1205
01:54:38,986 --> 01:54:40,420
No, no idea.

1206
01:54:41,196 --> 01:54:42,191
Gravity.

1207
01:55:02,749 --> 01:55:04,444
Welcome back, Mr. Safin.

1208
01:55:05,386 --> 01:55:07,553
Welcome to your family.

1209
01:55:07,588 --> 01:55:09,358
How are you progressing?

1210
01:55:09,393 --> 01:55:11,423
So, so good, Mr. Safin.
So, so good.

1211
01:55:11,459 --> 01:55:14,762
- My request?
- Svetlana?

1212
01:55:23,205 --> 01:55:25,570
Continue.

1213
01:55:25,605 --> 01:55:27,541
- What is that?
- Insurance.

1214
01:55:27,576 --> 01:55:29,873
A simple hair falls from your head

1215
01:55:29,908 --> 01:55:31,405
and now I have your life
in my hands.

1216
01:55:33,874 --> 01:55:34,782
And yours.

1217
01:55:37,083 --> 01:55:39,655
How damaged you must be
to threaten a little girl.

1218
01:55:41,455 --> 01:55:43,087
You're any less damaged?

1219
01:55:44,622 --> 01:55:45,760
You love a killer.

1220
01:55:47,828 --> 01:55:51,631
You bore his child
despite his rejection.

1221
01:55:51,667 --> 01:55:53,630
You've hidden
and lied your whole life.

1222
01:55:53,665 --> 01:55:56,235
You will do anything...

1223
01:55:56,270 --> 01:55:57,002
To survive.

1224
01:56:01,568 --> 01:56:03,646
You understand me the same way
I understand you.

1225
01:56:07,116 --> 01:56:07,914
Move.

1226
01:56:18,129 --> 01:56:19,656
My father's garden.

1227
01:56:19,692 --> 01:56:22,393
It was his toxic treasure.

1228
01:56:22,429 --> 01:56:24,496
Let me show her.

1229
01:56:24,531 --> 01:56:26,801
- Give her to me.
- No.

1230
01:56:29,304 --> 01:56:30,530
I can protect her.

1231
01:56:34,637 --> 01:56:36,078
Mathilde.

1232
01:56:45,351 --> 01:56:47,014
Mathilde.

1233
01:56:47,050 --> 01:56:48,856
It's a poison garden...

1234
01:56:50,392 --> 01:56:52,092
but it's perfectly safe.

1235
01:56:54,496 --> 01:56:56,930
My father made this.

1236
01:56:56,965 --> 01:57:00,329
He loved his plants so much,
he would sing to them.

1237
01:57:03,970 --> 01:57:05,466
I want to show you
one of my favorites.

1238
01:57:09,910 --> 01:57:12,680
Some of these plants
are very dangerous,

1239
01:57:12,716 --> 01:57:14,946
but not all of them
are for hurting people.

1240
01:57:14,982 --> 01:57:17,819
I have plants that can do
all sorts of things.

1241
01:57:24,588 --> 01:57:25,827
Mathilde!

1242
01:57:26,997 --> 01:57:27,763
No.

1243
01:57:29,666 --> 01:57:31,261
This one makes you do as you're told,

1244
01:57:32,764 --> 01:57:34,401
so you never misbehave,

1245
01:57:34,436 --> 01:57:35,998
and you're always good.

1246
01:57:36,033 --> 01:57:37,740
You mustn't misbehave, Mathilde.

1247
01:57:39,673 --> 01:57:40,875
And neither must your mother.

1248
01:57:43,706 --> 01:57:44,703
Ever.

1249
01:57:48,344 --> 01:57:50,280
- Do you like it here?
- No.

1250
01:57:51,750 --> 01:57:52,920
Well, you will learn to.

1251
01:57:54,191 --> 01:57:55,190
I grew up here,

1252
01:57:55,225 --> 01:57:56,422
and you will too.

1253
01:58:00,627 --> 01:58:01,962
Such a beautiful child.

1254
01:58:05,194 --> 01:58:06,533
Perhaps we should
have some tea.

1255
01:58:06,568 --> 01:58:08,361
- No.
- Make her see the light.

1256
01:58:08,397 --> 01:58:10,205
No, you can't separate us!

1257
01:58:10,241 --> 01:58:11,404
- Mathilde!
- Mama!

1258
01:58:17,070 --> 01:58:17,978
Don't worry.

1259
01:58:20,447 --> 01:58:21,443
You have me.

1260
01:58:31,390 --> 01:58:33,419
<i>As soon as you have
a line of sight on the island,</i>

1261
01:58:33,454 --> 01:58:35,226
<i>drop altitude, stay below radar.</i>

1262
01:58:40,462 --> 01:58:41,760
You ever flown one of these things before?

1263
01:58:43,304 --> 01:58:44,169
Nope.

1264
01:58:51,242 --> 01:58:53,073
<i>Don't forget to release the chute,</i>

1265
01:58:53,108 --> 01:58:54,880
<i>and open the wings.</i>

1266
01:58:54,915 --> 01:58:55,851
<i>Gravity isn't always your friend.</i>

1267
01:59:12,829 --> 01:59:14,870
<i>Look for a concrete structure
on the west side of the island.</i>

1268
01:59:16,201 --> 01:59:17,499
<i>That's your best bet for getting in.</i>

1269
02:00:04,147 --> 02:00:06,386
Coming up for air, Q.

1270
02:00:06,422 --> 02:00:08,154
Right, good.

1271
02:00:08,189 --> 02:00:11,058
You should be entering
a World War II-era sub pen.

1272
02:00:12,730 --> 02:00:14,025
<i>Doesn't seem to get much activity,</i>

1273
02:00:14,060 --> 02:00:15,425
<i>but look out for cameras anyway.</i>

1274
02:00:16,697 --> 02:00:18,065
<i>Use your watch, Bond.</i>

1275
02:00:53,635 --> 02:00:55,069
Okay. Ah, there you go.

1276
02:00:56,740 --> 02:00:59,769
- <i>Sir, they're in.</i>
- Yes, we have it.

1277
02:00:59,805 --> 02:01:02,408
<i>You should be able to see
the chemical plant's architecture.</i>

1278
02:01:02,443 --> 02:01:05,443
- Which one's Bond?
<i>- He's the... He's the psi.</i>

1279
02:01:05,478 --> 02:01:08,582
- <i>He's the trident thingy.</i>
<i>- Give us the layout.</i>

1280
02:01:08,617 --> 02:01:11,215
Right.

1281
02:01:11,251 --> 02:01:14,848
You're at the edge
of a toxic merry-go-round.

1282
02:01:14,883 --> 02:01:17,757
<i>The main activity should be
towards the central hub,</i>

1283
02:01:17,792 --> 02:01:18,917
<i>which is directly above you.</i>

1284
02:01:52,526 --> 02:01:54,155
Bond.

1285
02:01:54,191 --> 02:01:55,829
Bond, there's something...

1286
02:01:55,864 --> 02:01:57,623
There's something
big up ahead,

1287
02:01:57,659 --> 02:01:58,992
<i>I can't work out what it is.
It's...</i>

1288
02:02:00,595 --> 02:02:01,465
These walls must be thick.

1289
02:02:08,201 --> 02:02:09,110
Bond.

1290
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:12,646
<i>Bond? 007, do you read me?</i>

1291
02:02:12,681 --> 02:02:15,014
We've lost them.

1292
02:02:15,049 --> 02:02:16,810
They've entered
a blind spot, sir.

1293
02:02:16,845 --> 02:02:18,652
<i>I can't work out what it is
they've walked into.</i>

1294
02:02:18,687 --> 02:02:20,149
Well, just get them back.

1295
02:02:53,319 --> 02:02:55,222
Well, will you look at those doors.

1296
02:02:56,219 --> 02:02:57,787
This was a missile silo.

1297
02:02:57,822 --> 02:02:58,819
Right.

1298
02:03:00,858 --> 02:03:02,020
Let's go.

1299
02:03:09,568 --> 02:03:11,838
Everybody, over there!
In the corner! Now!

1300
02:03:11,873 --> 02:03:14,509
- What? How?
- Move!

1301
02:03:14,545 --> 02:03:16,111
Move! On the ground!

1302
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:19,812
Alarm.

1303
02:03:21,517 --> 02:03:22,546
Down, boy.

1304
02:03:39,967 --> 02:03:42,365
What... What are you doing?

1305
02:03:42,401 --> 02:03:45,839
You cannot explode
laboratory, please.

1306
02:03:49,945 --> 02:03:54,113
This is suicide mission. Come on.

1307
02:03:54,149 --> 02:03:56,283
You will never leave
this island alive.

1308
02:04:02,890 --> 02:04:03,785
That was the farm.

1309
02:04:05,387 --> 02:04:06,986
And this is the factory.

1310
02:04:20,174 --> 02:04:21,776
They're mass-producing it.

1311
02:04:21,811 --> 02:04:23,308
Nomi, come and look at this.

1312
02:04:23,343 --> 02:04:25,780
Well, look, you cannot stop it,
mister.

1313
02:04:25,815 --> 02:04:28,147
We have big plan, you know.

1314
02:04:28,182 --> 02:04:29,717
- We have big numbers.
- What is it?

1315
02:04:29,752 --> 02:04:31,217
It's a simulation.

1316
02:04:31,252 --> 02:04:32,952
They're not
just attacking individuals.

1317
02:04:32,988 --> 02:04:35,156
They're going to kill millions.

1318
02:04:35,191 --> 02:04:37,618
It will not fit
in a suitcase this time, lady.

1319
02:04:37,653 --> 02:04:39,660
He's really getting
on my nerves.

1320
02:04:39,695 --> 02:04:40,525
Well, shut him up.

1321
02:04:42,455 --> 02:04:44,993
Ow!

1322
02:04:45,028 --> 02:04:46,597
My nose.

1323
02:04:50,272 --> 02:04:53,339
We have to destroy this whole facility.

1324
02:04:53,375 --> 02:04:54,733
<i>There is no need for violence.</i>

1325
02:04:54,768 --> 02:04:57,143
Mr. Safin, they use explosives.

1326
02:04:57,178 --> 02:04:59,137
- Shut up.
<i>- Mr. Bond,</i>

1327
02:05:00,779 --> 02:05:04,384
<i>you have something of mine
and I have something of yours.</i>

1328
02:05:05,981 --> 02:05:08,820
<i>Why don't you come up
and we can talk about it?</i>

1329
02:05:08,856 --> 02:05:09,719
<i>Like adults.</i>

1330
02:05:12,619 --> 02:05:14,152
Safin, where is he?

1331
02:05:19,901 --> 02:05:21,302
If I don't come back,

1332
02:05:22,871 --> 02:05:23,997
blow it all to shit.

1333
02:05:25,240 --> 02:05:26,434
We don't have enough
explosives for that.

1334
02:05:26,470 --> 02:05:28,375
Yeah, but they don't know that.

1335
02:05:31,481 --> 02:05:32,247
Huh.

1336
02:05:47,061 --> 02:05:49,197
He said you must drink.

1337
02:05:49,232 --> 02:05:51,328
- For your health.
- Do you trust him?

1338
02:05:51,364 --> 02:05:54,299
He made me kill your last master.

1339
02:05:54,334 --> 02:05:56,167
Why do you think he let you join him?

1340
02:05:56,202 --> 02:05:59,406
I think he wants you to drink.

1341
02:06:02,244 --> 02:06:04,904
I want him to give me
my daughter back.

1342
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:08,041
He said if you behave,
you'll see her. Drink.

1343
02:06:18,688 --> 02:06:20,053
Do you know what this flower does?

1344
02:06:26,066 --> 02:06:27,434
It makes you blind.

1345
02:06:29,105 --> 02:06:31,004
Just a drop of this
in your eye,

1346
02:06:31,039 --> 02:06:32,439
and you'll never see again.

1347
02:06:35,076 --> 02:06:36,875
Losing one eye is a tragedy.

1348
02:06:36,911 --> 02:06:38,441
Losing two...

1349
02:06:38,476 --> 02:06:40,680
- No games.
- This is not a game.

1350
02:07:19,789 --> 02:07:20,322
Welcome.

1351
02:07:22,583 --> 02:07:23,358
On the floor.

1352
02:07:32,626 --> 02:07:33,500
Your sidearm.

1353
02:07:35,495 --> 02:07:36,294
Careful.

1354
02:07:41,839 --> 02:07:44,302
- She is light as a feather.
- All right!

1355
02:07:55,824 --> 02:07:56,523
Please, sit.

1356
02:08:03,629 --> 02:08:05,431
It's going to be all right.

1357
02:08:05,466 --> 02:08:07,226
Promise you,
it's going to be all right.

1358
02:08:08,234 --> 02:08:10,497
James Bond.

1359
02:08:10,533 --> 02:08:12,971
History of violence.

1360
02:08:13,007 --> 02:08:14,541
License to kill.

1361
02:08:15,638 --> 02:08:18,276
Vendetta with Ernst Blofeld.

1362
02:08:18,311 --> 02:08:20,008
In love with Madeleine Swann.

1363
02:08:22,384 --> 02:08:24,548
I could be speaking
to my own reflection.

1364
02:08:24,584 --> 02:08:26,785
We've made slightly different choices.

1365
02:08:26,821 --> 02:08:30,557
No. We've just developed different methods
for the same goal.

1366
02:08:32,228 --> 02:08:35,163
Only your skills die
with your body.

1367
02:08:35,198 --> 02:08:37,564
Mine will survive
long after I'm gone.

1368
02:08:38,665 --> 02:08:41,667
And life is all about
leaving something behind.

1369
02:08:44,201 --> 02:08:45,033
Isn't it?

1370
02:08:46,701 --> 02:08:48,366
Doesn't have to be ugly.

1371
02:08:49,905 --> 02:08:52,407
You leave my baby alone,
I leave yours.

1372
02:08:52,442 --> 02:08:53,613
What do you think?

1373
02:08:57,019 --> 02:08:58,882
I think you're right.

1374
02:09:00,889 --> 02:09:02,056
Thank you.

1375
02:09:02,092 --> 02:09:03,381
I think we are the same.

1376
02:09:04,688 --> 02:09:06,391
We both know what it feels like

1377
02:09:06,427 --> 02:09:08,690
to have everything taken from us

1378
02:09:08,725 --> 02:09:11,695
before we're even in the fight.

1379
02:09:11,730 --> 02:09:16,399
It would have been nice
to have a chance,

1380
02:09:16,435 --> 02:09:18,536
you know, don't you think?

1381
02:09:18,571 --> 02:09:21,572
Just... we all should get a chance.

1382
02:09:21,607 --> 02:09:24,175
But this thing that you're building,

1383
02:09:24,210 --> 02:09:26,411
it puts everyone,

1384
02:09:26,447 --> 02:09:29,115
the whole world on a battlefield.

1385
02:09:29,150 --> 02:09:31,017
Nobody gets a chance.

1386
02:09:34,422 --> 02:09:37,756
The thing that no one wants to admit

1387
02:09:37,791 --> 02:09:41,793
is that most people want things
to happen to them.

1388
02:09:41,829 --> 02:09:45,097
We tell each other lies
about the fight for free will

1389
02:09:45,132 --> 02:09:46,694
and independence,

1390
02:09:46,729 --> 02:09:50,302
but we don't really want that.

1391
02:09:50,338 --> 02:09:51,671
We want to be told how to live,

1392
02:09:53,606 --> 02:09:55,334
and then die when we are not looking.

1393
02:09:57,145 --> 02:09:59,745
People want oblivion,

1394
02:10:01,308 --> 02:10:04,519
and a few of us are born
to build it for them.

1395
02:10:06,685 --> 02:10:10,591
So, here I am,
their invisible god...

1396
02:10:12,592 --> 02:10:16,455
sneaking under their skin.

1397
02:10:16,490 --> 02:10:18,998
You know that history isn't kind
to those who play God.

1398
02:10:19,034 --> 02:10:19,963
And you don't?

1399
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:27,165
We both eradicate people to
make the world a better place.

1400
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:32,144
I just want to be
a little... tidier.

1401
02:10:32,180 --> 02:10:35,281
Without collateral.

1402
02:10:35,316 --> 02:10:37,746
I want the world to evolve,

1403
02:10:37,782 --> 02:10:39,554
yet you want it
to stay the same.

1404
02:10:40,990 --> 02:10:41,787
Let's face it...

1405
02:10:45,625 --> 02:10:49,158
- I've made you redundant.
- No.

1406
02:10:49,193 --> 02:10:51,060
Not as long as there are people
like you in the world.

1407
02:10:53,196 --> 02:10:56,637
And with all due respect
to the enormity of your...

1408
02:10:57,699 --> 02:10:58,903
tidy achievements,

1409
02:11:00,534 --> 02:11:03,142
all you're really doing is
standing in a very long line

1410
02:11:03,178 --> 02:11:05,377
of angry little men.

1411
02:11:05,413 --> 02:11:09,177
I'm not angry,
just passionate.

1412
02:11:11,014 --> 02:11:13,951
Disable your explosives,
get off my island,

1413
02:11:13,986 --> 02:11:17,317
and you can take this precious
little angel with you.

1414
02:11:19,226 --> 02:11:19,825
And Madeleine?

1415
02:11:22,157 --> 02:11:24,599
- She stays.
- You know I can't do that.

1416
02:11:25,761 --> 02:11:27,426
That is a shame.

1417
02:11:29,172 --> 02:11:30,737
She really hoped you would.

1418
02:11:31,837 --> 02:11:33,999
She knows it's her only path
to survive.

1419
02:11:34,034 --> 02:11:37,041
No, you have her tell me that.

1420
02:11:37,076 --> 02:11:40,846
What mother wouldn't sacrifice
herself for her own child?

1421
02:11:43,616 --> 02:11:44,751
Is that what happened to yours?

1422
02:11:51,088 --> 02:11:53,628
My mother lay at my feet
as I watched her die.

1423
02:11:57,627 --> 02:11:58,798
Wait! Wait. Wait.

1424
02:12:03,470 --> 02:12:04,598
I'll do whatever you want.

1425
02:12:04,634 --> 02:12:05,706
Yes, you will.

1426
02:12:09,243 --> 02:12:10,777
I... I apologize.

1427
02:12:14,082 --> 02:12:15,408
I'm sorry.

1428
02:12:16,383 --> 02:12:18,147
Simple choices, Mr. Bond.

1429
02:12:19,887 --> 02:12:21,755
Like do you want to die
in front of your daughter?

1430
02:12:24,155 --> 02:12:25,851
Or do you want your daughter
to die in front of you?

1431
02:12:25,887 --> 02:12:27,728
No. No. No. No. No.

1432
02:12:30,263 --> 02:12:31,589
I am sorry.

1433
02:12:33,497 --> 02:12:34,801
I'm sorry.

1434
02:12:36,770 --> 02:12:38,068
Look at your father, Mathilde.

1435
02:12:42,144 --> 02:12:43,242
This is power.

1436
02:12:43,277 --> 02:12:44,305
I'm sorry.

1437
02:12:45,346 --> 02:12:47,913
I'm truly, truly sorry.

1438
02:12:57,927 --> 02:12:58,858
James!

1439
02:13:00,462 --> 02:13:02,191
Where is she?

1440
02:13:05,865 --> 02:13:07,096
The first shipment
is on the dock,

1441
02:13:07,131 --> 02:13:08,835
- ready for pickup, Doctor.
- Very good.

1442
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:29,647
Hmm...

1443
02:13:31,891 --> 02:13:33,860
If you don't want
my protection, then...

1444
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:36,698
off you go.

1445
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:49,711
Move. Our first buyers are arriving.

1446
02:14:03,188 --> 02:14:06,487
Sir, I've just detected
some suspicious activity.

1447
02:14:06,523 --> 02:14:09,130
<i>Several high-speed transports
are headed towards the island.</i>

1448
02:14:09,165 --> 02:14:10,495
<i>Origin unknown.</i>

1449
02:14:10,530 --> 02:14:11,359
<i>Still no sign of 007.</i>

1450
02:14:13,933 --> 02:14:17,000
Come on, Bond.
Where the hell are you?

1451
02:14:17,035 --> 02:14:20,407
This is hopeless situation,
lady. Please.

1452
02:14:22,936 --> 02:14:24,509
Bond.

1453
02:14:24,544 --> 02:14:27,505
Bond.

1454
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:29,914
The party is larger
than the reservation.

1455
02:14:29,949 --> 02:14:33,016
Look, lady, please,
please just let me go.

1456
02:14:33,051 --> 02:14:35,790
I... There was never
gonna be a way out.

1457
02:14:37,227 --> 02:14:38,315
Stop this nonsense.

1458
02:14:38,351 --> 02:14:40,489
You don't have a chance, anyways.

1459
02:14:42,258 --> 02:14:45,724
Hey. Hey, I have a good vial
for your people,

1460
02:14:45,759 --> 02:14:47,626
good for West African diaspora.
It can be a good thing.

1461
02:15:04,652 --> 02:15:07,350
You know,
I do not need laboratory

1462
02:15:07,386 --> 02:15:09,824
to exterminate your entire race
from the face of the Earth.

1463
02:15:11,990 --> 02:15:14,051
- Do you know what time it is?
- What?

1464
02:15:14,086 --> 02:15:15,789
Time to die.

1465
02:15:15,825 --> 02:15:18,231
No!

1466
02:15:28,001 --> 02:15:29,441
Move! Move!

1467
02:15:34,276 --> 02:15:35,747
They dropped down to a lower level.

1468
02:15:35,783 --> 02:15:37,448
There has to be a stairwell down.

1469
02:15:37,484 --> 02:15:38,182
Mama?

1470
02:15:47,495 --> 02:15:48,995
Mathilde. Mathilde.

1471
02:16:04,007 --> 02:16:05,275
We should go.

1472
02:16:07,141 --> 02:16:08,850
It's Q. Do you read me?

1473
02:16:10,452 --> 02:16:11,644
Come in, 007, it's Q.

1474
02:16:17,155 --> 02:16:19,290
<i>Traffic. We have traffic.</i>

1475
02:16:19,325 --> 02:16:21,959
- I think we just got buzzed.
- <i>Those are two Russian MiGs.</i>

1476
02:16:21,994 --> 02:16:23,655
<i>Traffic. TCAS, you have control.</i>

1477
02:16:23,691 --> 02:16:25,266
I understand, and I'm doing
the best that I can.

1478
02:16:25,301 --> 02:16:27,424
Just please wait.

1479
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:29,630
Sir, I've got the Navy,

1480
02:16:29,665 --> 02:16:31,496
the Japanese, the Russians,
all breathing down my neck,

1481
02:16:31,531 --> 02:16:33,804
demanding to know why
we've got a C-17

1482
02:16:33,839 --> 02:16:35,008
circling a disputed island.

1483
02:16:39,011 --> 02:16:40,079
Don't tell them
anything just yet.

1484
02:16:59,397 --> 02:17:02,002
- Ah, just in time.
- Nomi, you know...

1485
02:17:03,101 --> 02:17:05,668
Madeleine, Mathilde, they're my, uh...

1486
02:17:05,704 --> 02:17:06,901
- Hey.
- Hi.

1487
02:17:06,936 --> 02:17:07,942
Family?

1488
02:17:10,406 --> 02:17:12,344
<i>Q. Q, are you there?</i>

1489
02:17:12,380 --> 02:17:13,846
Yes. Bond.

1490
02:17:13,881 --> 02:17:17,180
Do we have
any Royal Naval vessels

1491
02:17:17,215 --> 02:17:20,583
- in the immediate vicinity?
- Uh, yes. Why?

1492
02:17:20,619 --> 02:17:22,521
<i>We are gonna need an immediate strike
on this location.</i>

1493
02:17:22,557 --> 02:17:24,550
<i>This whole island,</i>

1494
02:17:24,586 --> 02:17:27,324
<i>it's a manufacturing plant for Heracles.</i>

1495
02:17:27,359 --> 02:17:29,394
We don't have clearance
for missile strikes, do we?

1496
02:17:29,429 --> 02:17:31,328
Mm-mm.

1497
02:17:31,363 --> 02:17:33,495
Bond, there's something
else you should know.

1498
02:17:33,530 --> 02:17:36,727
<i>Several unidentified ships
are headed your way.</i>

1499
02:17:36,762 --> 02:17:39,066
They're coming after Heracles.
How far out?

1500
02:17:39,101 --> 02:17:40,205
<i>Uh, 20 minutes.</i>

1501
02:17:41,741 --> 02:17:42,944
Q, patch me through.

1502
02:17:44,413 --> 02:17:46,578
<i>- 007.</i>
- M.

1503
02:17:46,613 --> 02:17:50,177
<i>Our operation is attracting a lot
of international attention.</i>

1504
02:17:50,212 --> 02:17:51,550
<i>We're seeing what we can do.</i>

1505
02:17:51,585 --> 02:17:52,217
Come on.

1506
02:17:53,917 --> 02:17:55,088
Let's go. Come on.

1507
02:18:02,557 --> 02:18:05,428
It's going to get
very cold out there, so...

1508
02:18:06,733 --> 02:18:08,431
I want you to have this.

1509
02:18:10,737 --> 02:18:11,731
That'll keep you warm.

1510
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:19,607
I have to finish this. For us.

1511
02:18:20,777 --> 02:18:22,016
I know.

1512
02:18:32,187 --> 02:18:33,159
I'll just be a minute.

1513
02:18:40,667 --> 02:18:41,365
I've got them.

1514
02:18:43,165 --> 02:18:44,170
This might come in handy.

1515
02:18:45,506 --> 02:18:47,173
Thank you.

1516
02:19:09,696 --> 02:19:11,659
Q, talk to me.

1517
02:19:11,694 --> 02:19:15,192
<i>Um, our uninvited guests
are 15 minutes away.</i>

1518
02:19:15,227 --> 02:19:19,598
<i>Bond, M here. The situation
is diplomatically complex.</i>

1519
02:19:19,634 --> 02:19:22,702
We don't have a choice.
Fire on my mark.

1520
02:19:22,737 --> 02:19:25,209
<i>If we launch,
the Russians, the Japanese</i>

1521
02:19:25,244 --> 02:19:27,174
<i>and even the Americans
will want answers.</i>

1522
02:19:27,210 --> 02:19:28,313
Well, don't give them any.

1523
02:19:31,544 --> 02:19:33,814
<i>Rational minds, Bond.</i>

1524
02:19:33,849 --> 02:19:35,584
<i>I'm trying to save this from
escalating to all-out war.</i>

1525
02:19:37,418 --> 02:19:40,289
Mallory, if we don't do this,

1526
02:19:40,324 --> 02:19:41,491
there will be nothing
left to save.

1527
02:19:43,532 --> 02:19:46,064
Fire on my mark.

1528
02:19:46,099 --> 02:19:47,563
<i>007, there's another problem.</i>

1529
02:19:47,598 --> 02:19:49,527
- <i>That room you were just in.</i>
- Yes, I know, I know.

1530
02:19:49,563 --> 02:19:51,235
I've got
to open the blast doors.

1531
02:19:51,270 --> 02:19:52,838
Otherwise our missiles
will bounce off it

1532
02:19:52,873 --> 02:19:54,838
like they've hit a trampoline.

1533
02:19:54,874 --> 02:19:56,110
Yes, I know, I know.

1534
02:19:57,905 --> 02:20:00,043
Find the control room.
It should be in a tower

1535
02:20:00,078 --> 02:20:02,039
just above the blast doors.

1536
02:20:02,074 --> 02:20:04,745
The missiles will take about
nine minutes from launch.

1537
02:20:04,781 --> 02:20:06,415
<i>Do you think you can do it
before the ships arrive?</i>

1538
02:20:06,450 --> 02:20:08,287
<i>Plenty of time, plenty of time.</i>

1539
02:23:25,087 --> 02:23:27,453
<i>Bond. Bond, do you read me?</i>

1540
02:23:28,823 --> 02:23:31,448
Yeah.

1541
02:23:31,483 --> 02:23:32,758
Yeah, Q.

1542
02:23:32,794 --> 02:23:33,918
<i>I read you.</i>

1543
02:23:33,953 --> 02:23:35,722
Sounds like you're in a rugby scrum.

1544
02:23:35,757 --> 02:23:37,254
I just showed someone your watch.

1545
02:23:38,966 --> 02:23:40,466
Really blew their mind.

1546
02:23:42,602 --> 02:23:45,570
Right, good. Now, did you find
the control room?

1547
02:23:47,905 --> 02:23:50,476
Well, my Russian is a little rusty,
but I think so, yeah.

1548
02:24:04,186 --> 02:24:05,950
Okay, Q.

1549
02:24:05,985 --> 02:24:07,889
<i>Uh, I've done some research.</i>

1550
02:24:07,924 --> 02:24:10,322
<i>- Old schematics...</i>
- Q, I am gonna need some...

1551
02:24:10,357 --> 02:24:11,288
<i>Yes?</i>

1552
02:24:12,634 --> 02:24:13,862
<i>Bond?</i>

1553
02:24:17,037 --> 02:24:19,103
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Power.

1554
02:24:19,139 --> 02:24:20,969
<i>Power?</i>

1555
02:24:21,004 --> 02:24:22,803
<i>Right, the infrastructure
must go back to the 1950s,</i>

1556
02:24:22,838 --> 02:24:24,275
so it's going to be
an overly complicated

1557
02:24:24,310 --> 02:24:26,311
and intricate
switching system.

1558
02:24:26,346 --> 02:24:29,347
<i>Now, the order in which you engage it</i>

1559
02:24:29,382 --> 02:24:30,777
will need to be extremely precise.

1560
02:24:30,812 --> 02:24:33,814
<i>You're looking for a control panel.</i>

1561
02:24:33,849 --> 02:24:37,122
<i>There should be a counterweight clutch.</i>

1562
02:24:37,157 --> 02:24:38,785
<i>So, listen very carefully, 007.</i>

1563
02:24:38,820 --> 02:24:40,088
<i>The first thing you need to do...</i>

1564
02:24:40,123 --> 02:24:41,527
Got it.

1565
02:24:42,829 --> 02:24:43,496
I think.

1566
02:24:58,070 --> 02:24:59,638
Yep, that's it. Launch the missiles.

1567
02:24:59,673 --> 02:25:01,379
<i>Not until you're clear.</i>

1568
02:25:01,414 --> 02:25:03,010
Q, tell M to launch the missiles now.

1569
02:25:04,383 --> 02:25:07,821
Okay. Okay, okay. Understood.

1570
02:25:07,856 --> 02:25:09,588
M, Bond says fire.

1571
02:25:11,390 --> 02:25:13,024
<i>HMS Dragon here.</i>

1572
02:25:13,060 --> 02:25:14,560
- Admiral.
- <i>Sir.</i>

1573
02:25:16,330 --> 02:25:19,362
- M here.
- <i>What are my instructions?</i>

1574
02:25:19,397 --> 02:25:21,397
You have permission to launch.

1575
02:25:21,432 --> 02:25:23,030
<i>Roger. Launching the strike.</i>

1576
02:25:37,353 --> 02:25:39,948
<i>Missiles airborne. Nine minutes out.</i>

1577
02:26:08,717 --> 02:26:10,451
No.

1578
02:26:12,051 --> 02:26:13,454
No. No, no!

1579
02:26:46,311 --> 02:26:50,056
Quite a mess you've made.
Like an animal.

1580
02:27:18,815 --> 02:27:24,316
Now we are both poisoned
with heartbreak.

1581
02:27:26,824 --> 02:27:29,530
Two heroes in a tragedy
of our own making.

1582
02:27:37,163 --> 02:27:40,706
Anyone we touch,
we are their curse.

1583
02:27:41,802 --> 02:27:43,810
A stroke to their cheek,

1584
02:27:43,845 --> 02:27:45,502
a kiss...

1585
02:27:47,413 --> 02:27:49,649
would kill them instantly.

1586
02:27:54,218 --> 02:27:55,314
Yes...

1587
02:27:56,749 --> 02:27:57,690
Madeleine.

1588
02:28:00,589 --> 02:28:04,323
Yes, Mathilde.

1589
02:28:20,545 --> 02:28:23,111
You made me do this, you see?

1590
02:28:28,585 --> 02:28:30,349
This was your choice.

1591
02:29:18,305 --> 02:29:20,371
Q. Q, are you there?

1592
02:29:20,406 --> 02:29:21,404
<i>Bond, there you are.</i>

1593
02:29:21,439 --> 02:29:22,636
Are they safe, Q?

1594
02:29:22,672 --> 02:29:25,412
<i>Yes, they're safe.</i>

1595
02:29:25,447 --> 02:29:27,910
<i>Bond, have you left the island?</i>

1596
02:29:27,946 --> 02:29:29,782
There's a slight problem
with the blast doors.

1597
02:29:31,251 --> 02:29:32,081
Won't take a sec.

1598
02:29:34,151 --> 02:29:37,421
No, no, no. Bond, the missiles
have already launched.

1599
02:29:37,456 --> 02:29:38,923
Just get out of there.

1600
02:29:49,929 --> 02:29:51,870
Q, how do I, uh...

1601
02:29:52,702 --> 02:29:54,840
How do I destroy this?

1602
02:29:55,937 --> 02:29:57,642
<i>If the silo doors are open,</i>

1603
02:29:57,677 --> 02:29:58,943
<i>the missiles will deal with it.</i>

1604
02:29:58,978 --> 02:30:01,539
No. No, no, no. If you get it
on you, how do...

1605
02:30:02,877 --> 02:30:04,749
How do you get it off?

1606
02:30:04,784 --> 02:30:06,142
<i>You know as well as I do
that you can't.</i>

1607
02:30:06,177 --> 02:30:07,787
<i>It's... It's permanent.</i>

1608
02:30:07,822 --> 02:30:11,087
<i>It's eternal. Which is wh
we have to destroy it.</i>

1609
02:30:11,123 --> 02:30:14,695
<i>For Christ's sake, James,
just get off the island.</i>

1610
02:30:14,730 --> 02:30:16,697
<i>It's harmless unless
you're near to the target.</i>

1611
02:30:18,732 --> 02:30:21,834
Yeah. Well, that's not
gonna work.

1612
02:30:28,374 --> 02:30:29,710
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1613
02:30:32,412 --> 02:30:32,977
It's for Madeleine.

1614
02:30:37,350 --> 02:30:38,818
It's all right, Q.

1615
02:30:40,222 --> 02:30:42,186
It's all all right.

1616
02:30:43,723 --> 02:30:45,525
Would you put Madeleine on, please?

1617
02:30:45,560 --> 02:30:46,826
<i>Yes, of course. How stupid of me.</i>

1618
02:30:52,658 --> 02:30:54,592
<i>Nomi, come in.
Can you put Madeleine on?</i>

1619
02:30:56,435 --> 02:30:57,397
Madeleine.

1620
02:31:05,038 --> 02:31:07,146
- James.
- Madeleine.

1621
02:31:07,181 --> 02:31:08,408
<i>I'm here.</i>

1622
02:31:09,415 --> 02:31:10,278
<i>Where are you?</i>

1623
02:31:12,186 --> 02:31:13,182
Is it done?

1624
02:31:14,288 --> 02:31:15,420
- <i>James?</i>
- Yes.

1625
02:31:15,455 --> 02:31:17,016
Yes, he's... He's dead.

1626
02:31:17,052 --> 02:31:19,023
- Are you both there?
- <i>Yes.</i>

1627
02:31:21,023 --> 02:31:23,522
Good. You're safe.
That's good.

1628
02:31:24,529 --> 02:31:26,065
<i>Have you left?</i>

1629
02:31:29,433 --> 02:31:30,870
No. Um...

1630
02:31:32,439 --> 02:31:33,202
I'm not gonna make it.

1631
02:31:36,077 --> 02:31:36,909
What?

1632
02:31:40,076 --> 02:31:42,310
- Madeleine. Madeleine.
- <i>You promised.</i>

1633
02:31:43,748 --> 02:31:44,950
<i>Just get off that island.</i>

1634
02:31:47,619 --> 02:31:48,646
<i>I know you can do this.</i>

1635
02:31:51,788 --> 02:31:53,422
Everything's good now.

1636
02:31:56,631 --> 02:31:58,560
There's no one left
to hurt us.

1637
02:31:58,596 --> 02:31:59,657
<i>Madeleine...</i>

1638
02:32:03,238 --> 02:32:05,003
you have made...

1639
02:32:06,433 --> 02:32:10,602
the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

1640
02:32:12,808 --> 02:32:14,177
<i>She's perfect.</i>

1641
02:32:18,486 --> 02:32:19,776
<i>Because she came from you.</i>

1642
02:32:31,863 --> 02:32:33,834
<i>Oh, God. The vial.</i>

1643
02:32:38,802 --> 02:32:39,840
You've been poisoned.

1644
02:32:41,835 --> 02:32:42,843
Yes.

1645
02:32:44,038 --> 02:32:45,010
<i>There must be a way.</i>

1646
02:32:50,011 --> 02:32:50,807
There must be a way.

1647
02:33:03,530 --> 02:33:04,898
We just need more time.

1648
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:07,527
If we only had more time.

1649
02:33:13,807 --> 02:33:15,634
You have all the time in the world.

1650
02:33:19,544 --> 02:33:20,881
I love you.

1651
02:33:24,583 --> 02:33:25,347
I love you too.

1652
02:33:46,540 --> 02:33:48,106
She does have your eyes.

1653
02:33:52,246 --> 02:33:53,914
I know.

1654
02:34:07,426 --> 02:34:08,885
I know.

1655
02:35:13,454 --> 02:35:16,225
Very hard to know what to say,

1656
02:35:16,261 --> 02:35:19,527
but I thought we should gather
and remember.

1657
02:35:20,862 --> 02:35:22,669
And I...

1658
02:35:22,704 --> 02:35:27,040
I thought this was appropriate.

1659
02:35:31,507 --> 02:35:35,675
"The function of man
is to live, not to exist.

1660
02:35:39,054 --> 02:35:41,648
I shall not waste my days
trying to prolong them.

1661
02:35:43,283 --> 02:35:45,190
I shall use my time."

1662
02:35:58,064 --> 02:35:59,237
To James.

1663
02:36:00,509 --> 02:36:01,769
- James.
- James.

1664
02:36:01,804 --> 02:36:03,241
James.

1665
02:36:05,038 --> 02:36:06,673
James.

1666
02:36:14,919 --> 02:36:17,255
Right, back to work.

1667
02:36:34,441 --> 02:36:36,542
Mathilde.

1668
02:36:37,736 --> 02:36:39,244
I'm going to tell you a story...

1669
02:36:41,548 --> 02:36:43,714
about a man.

1670
02:36:43,749 --> 02:36:45,283
His name was Bond.

1671
02:36:47,114 --> 02:36:48,187
James Bond.
