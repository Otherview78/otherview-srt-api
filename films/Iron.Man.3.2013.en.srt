1
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,260
<i>A famous man once said,</i>

2
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:12,096
<i>"We create our own demons."</i>

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,641
<i>Who said that?
What does that even mean?</i>

4
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:17,602
<i>It doesn't matter.
I said it because he said it.</i>

5
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,312
<i>So, now, he was famous</i>

6
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,898
<i>and it's basically getting said
by two well-known guys.</i>

7
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,608
<i>I don't...</i>

8
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,818
<i>I'm going to start again.</i>

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,488
<i>Let's track this from the beginning.</i>

10
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:07,860
Half hour till the ball drops.

11
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,196
- Hey, do you wanna...
- Tony Stark?

12
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,530
- Great speech, man!
- I got you, pal.

13
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:13,407
I gave a speech? How was it?

14
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,076
- Edifying.
- Unintelligible.

15
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,911
Really? It's my favourite kind.
A winning combo.

16
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,788
- Where are we going?
- To town, on each other.

17
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:19,914
Probably back in your room

18
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,123
because I also want
to see your research.

19
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:22,208
Okay, you can see my research,

20
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,252
but that's...
I'm not gonna show you my "town."

21
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:25,544
Mr Stark.

22
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:26,587
Ho Yinsen.

23
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,673
I finally met a man called "Ho."

24
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:32,093
I would like to introduce you
to our guest, Dr Wu.

25
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:33,636
- Oh, this guy.
- Mr Stark.

26
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:38,057
You're a heart doctor. She's going to
need a cardiologist after I...

27
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:42,770
Perhaps another time?

28
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:47,191
<i>It started in Bern, Switzerland.
1999.</i>

29
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,361
- <i>The old days.</i>
- Mr Stark!

30
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,822
<i>I never thought they would
come back to bite me.</i>

31
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:53,906
<i>Why would they?</i>

32
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,700
Wow! Hey, Tony!

33
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:59,370
Aldrich Killian.
I'm a big fan of your work.

34
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,621
- My work?
- Who isn't? He means me.

35
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,249
Of course, but Ms Hansen,

36
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,752
my organisation's been tracking
your research since year two of MIT.

37
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:07,920
Yeah, we're full.

38
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,381
Wow, he made it. He made the cut.

39
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:11,632
What floor you going to, pal?

40
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,217
Well, now, that is
an appropriate question.

41
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:14,385
The ground floor, actually,

42
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:16,470
of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.

43
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:20,391
It's a privately funded think tank
called Advanced Idea Mechanics.

44
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,395
She'll take both.
One to throw away and one to not call.

45
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:28,149
"Advanced Idea Mechanics,"
or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?

46
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,650
I see that,
because it's on your T-shirt.

47
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,404
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.

48
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,197
Thank you, I'll call you.

49
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,119
I'm titillated by the notion
of working with you.

50
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,454
- Yeah?
- I'll ditch these clowns.

51
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,247
I'll see you up
on the roof in five minutes.

52
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:44,874
Just gonna try
and get my beak wet real quick.

53
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,042
You know what I'm talking about?

54
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,126
I'll see you up there.

55
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,586
Damn betcha.

56
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,339
Come on!
I thought that was just a theory.

57
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,715
Well, it was.

58
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,508
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain

59
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,593
- that governs repair...
- Wow.

60
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,011
...and chemically recode it.

61
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,513
That's incredible. Essentially,
you're hacking into the genetic...

62
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:00,681
...operating system...

63
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:02,141
- ...of a living organism.
- Exactly.

64
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:03,517
- Yes.
- Wow.

65
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:04,643
Is that...
Can you...

66
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,228
- What?
- Can you not touch my plant?

67
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,022
It's not...
She doesn't like it. She prefers...

68
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,107
She's not like the others.
Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.

69
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,234
- Happy...
- That's cute...

70
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,778
Leave her ficus alone.

71
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:14,904
Because...
And, no, seriously, don't.

72
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,114
- And you're starting with plants.
- For now, yeah.

73
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,450
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.

74
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,161
- Well, it's...
- Human application.

75
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,454
Exactly, exactly.

76
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,581
- Dendritic revitalisation.
- It's revolutionary.

77
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,041
- Disease prevention...
- Change the world.

78
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,584
...even limb regrowth.

79
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,462
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.

80
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:32,797
Wow.

81
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,424
- In Switzerland.
- That's better.

82
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,551
- You're seeing things.
- This week.

83
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,678
You almost bought it, didn't you?

84
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,316
This is what I'm talking about,
the glitch.

85
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,692
Have you checked
the telomerase algorithm?

86
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:54,860
- The what?
- Down!

87
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,321
Stay down! Stay down, boss.

88
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,948
- We're good.
- Stay down.

89
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:01,158
You're right on me. I made it.

90
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,828
What the hell was that?

91
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,789
- What was that?
- It's a glitch in my work. It's...

92
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:08,457
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.

93
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:09,667
It's not Y2K.

94
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,502
Hey! Happy New Year!

95
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:12,837
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

96
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,296
All right.
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.

97
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,423
- You good?
- Yeah.

98
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,466
- I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.

99
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,904
<i>So, why am I telling you this?</i>

100
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,783
<i>Because I had just created demons</i>

101
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,369
<i>and I didn't even know it.</i>

102
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,748
<i>Yeah, those were good times.</i>

103
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,460
<i>Then I moved on.</i>

104
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,212
<i>After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said goodbye to the party scene.</i>

105
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,215
<i>I forgot that night in Switzerland.</i>

106
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:01,302
<i>-These days, I'm a changed man.
- Forty-six.</i>

107
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,762
<i>I'm different now.</i>

108
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,014
<i>I'm... Well...</i>

109
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,600
<i>-Forty-seven.
- You know who I am.</i>

110
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,603
<i>Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate...</i>

111
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,104
No. Forty-eight.

112
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,151
Micro-repeater
implanting sequence complete.

113
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,235
<i>As you wish, sir.</i>

114
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,363
<i>I've also prepared a safety briefing
for you to entirely ignore.</i>

115
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,073
Which I will.

116
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,658
All right, let's do this.

117
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,702
DUM-E.

118
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,786
Hi, DUM-E.

119
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,206
How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.

120
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,208
Hey. Hey!

121
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,711
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.

122
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,088
Blood on my mat. Handle it.

123
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,176
<i>Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours?</i>

124
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,011
Focus up, ladies.

125
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,931
Good evening,
and welcome to the birthing suite.

126
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,391
<i>I am pleased to announce
the imminent arrival</i>

127
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,436
<i>of your bouncing,
bad-ass baby brother.</i>

128
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,480
Start tight and then go wide.

129
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:56,023
<i>Stamp date and time.</i>

130
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,193
<i>Mark 42. Autonomous prehensile
propulsion suit test.</i>

131
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,111
Initialise sequence.

132
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,491
Jarvis, drop my needle.

133
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:30,975
Crap.

134
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,786
All right, I think we got this.
Send them all.

135
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:00,671
Probably a little fast.
Slow it down.

136
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:01,797
Slow it down just a...

137
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,173
...little bit.

138
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,516
Cool it, will you, Jarvis?

139
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,613
Come on. I ain't scared of you.

140
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,246
I'm the best.

141
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,839
<i>As always, sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.</i>

142
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,801
<i>I guess 72 hours is a long time
between siestas.</i>

143
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,888
<i>I didn't think it could get any worse.</i>

144
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,267
<i>Then I had to go and turn on the TV.</i>

145
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,606
<i>That's when he happened.</i>

146
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,533
<i>Some people call me a terrorist.</i>

147
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,914
<i>I consider myself a teacher.</i>

148
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,751
<i>America.</i>

149
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,047
<i>Ready for another lesson?</i>

150
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:30,344
<i>In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado,
the US military waited</i>

151
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,681
<i>until the friendly Cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting.</i>

152
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:38,060
<i>Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind</i>

153
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,438
<i>and claim their land.</i>

154
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:43,399
<i>39 hours ago,</i>

155
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:48,362
<i>the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait
was attacked.</i>

156
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,698
<i>I... I... I did that.</i>

157
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,116
<i>A quaint military church</i>

158
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,661
<i>filled with wives and children,
of course.</i>

159
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,708
<i>The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.</i>

160
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,044
<i>The braves were away.</i>

161
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,588
<i>President Ellis.</i>

162
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,050
<i>You continue to resist my attempts
to educate you, sir.</i>

163
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,845
<i>And now you've missed me again.</i>

164
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,808
<i>You know who I am.</i>

165
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:19,977
<i>You don't know where I am.</i>

166
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,981
<i>And you'll never see me coming.</i>

167
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,610
<i>Now that we seem to be back,</i>

168
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,195
<i>let's recap some
of the frightening developments...</i>

169
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,156
<i>American airwaves were hijacked...</i>

170
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:33,824
<i>The nation remains on high alert.</i>

171
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,535
<i>All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.</i>

172
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,997
<i>Central to my administration's
response to this terrorist event</i>

173
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,207
<i>is a newly minted resource.</i>

174
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,544
<i>I know him as Colonel James Rhodes.</i>

175
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,796
<i>The American people
will soon know him</i>

176
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,506
<i>as the Iron Patriot.</i>

177
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,468
<i>And how is President Ellis responding?</i>

178
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,720
<i>By taking the guy
they call War Machine</i>

179
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,430
<i>and giving him a paint job.</i>

180
00:09:56,597 --> 00:10:00,184
<i>The same suit,
but painted red, white and blue.</i>

181
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:04,146
<i>Look at that. And they also
renamed him, "Iron Patriot."</i>

182
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,149
<i>You know,
just in case the paint was too subtle.</i>

183
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,318
It tested well with focus groups,
all right?

184
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,111
"I am Iron Patriot!" It sucks.

185
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,613
"War Machine" was
a little too aggressive.

186
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,114
All right?
This sends a better message.

187
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,536
So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.

188
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,040
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?

189
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,670
It's classified information, Tony.

190
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,256
Okay, there have been nine bombings.

191
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,550
- Nine.
- The public only knows about three.

192
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,720
But here's the thing,
nobody can ID a device.

193
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:37,930
There's no bomb casings.

194
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,307
You know I can help. Just ask.

195
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,100
I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.

196
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,562
I got bomb disposal.
It catches explosions in mid-air.

197
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,147
When's the last time
you got a good night's sleep?

198
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,900
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.

199
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,402
People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.

200
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:53,737
You're going to come at me like that?

201
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,447
I'm not trying to be a dick...

202
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,157
...tator.

203
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,742
Do you mind signing my drawing?

204
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,203
If Richard doesn't mind.
Are you all right with this, Dick?

205
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,871
Yeah. Fine with me.

206
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,333
- What's your name?
- Erin.

207
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,420
I loved you in <i>A Christmas Story,</i>
by the way.

208
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,090
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.

209
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:16,009
After New York, aliens... Come on.

210
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,761
They need to look strong.

211
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,014
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority,
but it's not...

212
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,891
- It's not superhero business.
- No, it's not, quite frankly.

213
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,518
- I get it.
- It's American business.

214
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,436
That's why I said I got it.

215
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,605
Are you okay?

216
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,315
I broke the crayon.

217
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,109
Are you okay, Mr Stark?

218
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,027
Take it easy. Tony.

219
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,197
How did you get out of the wormhole?

220
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:38,949
Wait a minute. Tony!

221
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,075
- What did you say?
- Tony.

222
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,744
Sorry.

223
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,371
I'm just checking on the suit.

224
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,456
Okay.

225
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,128
Check the heart.

226
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,629
Is it the brain?

227
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,632
<i>No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.</i>

228
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,551
Okay, so I was poisoned?

229
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:02,973
<i>My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.</i>

230
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,602
Me?

231
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,770
Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.

232
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,939
Sorry, I gotta split.

233
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,276
Badge.

234
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:15,736
Badge.

235
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,196
Come on, badge.

236
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,117
Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.

237
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,494
Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.

238
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,663
This is an asset that we can put to use.

239
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,792
So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots.

240
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,461
- Thank you.
- What I'm saying is that

241
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,631
the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability.

242
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,050
We should start
phasing it out immediately.

243
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,593
- What?
- Excuse me, Bambi,

244
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:40,969
- you should be wearing...
- Did you just say that?

245
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,638
- Security? Yes?
- Happy? Okay.

246
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,432
I am thrilled that you are now
the Head Of Security. Okay?

247
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,225
- It is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.

248
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,852
- However...
- I do appreciate it.

249
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,854
- ...since you've taken the post...
- You don't have to thank me.

250
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,441
...we've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300%.

251
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,609
Thank you.

252
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,235
It's not a compliment.

253
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,570
It's not...
It is a compliment.

254
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,197
Clearly, somebody's
trying to hide something.

255
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,490
- I... Yes.
- Excuse me.

256
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,533
Ms Potts, your 4:00 is here.

257
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,035
- Thank you.
- Did you clear this 4:00 with me?

258
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,912
Happy, we'll talk about this later,

259
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,373
but right now, I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.

260
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,832
How so?

261
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,335
I used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time,

262
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:14,544
so it's a little awkward.

263
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,463
I don't like the sound of that.

264
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,469
Pepper.

265
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,429
Killian?

266
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,264
You look great.

267
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,975
You look really great.

268
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,310
God, you look great.

269
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,603
I... I... I...

270
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,438
What on earth have you been doing?

271
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:34,898
Nothing fancy.

272
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,275
Just five years in the hands
of physical therapists.

273
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,319
And please, call me Aldrich.

274
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,571
You were supposed to be
issued a security badge.

275
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,116
- Happy, it's okay. We're good.
- Yes.

276
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,743
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes. Stand down.

277
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,537
- I'm going to linger right here. Okay.
- Thank you.

278
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,832
It's very nice to see you, Killian.

279
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,548
Hey, guy.

280
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,223
Merry Christmas.

281
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:13,562
After years dodging the President's ban
on "immoral" bio tech research,

282
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:14,980
my think tank

283
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,109
now has a little something
in the pipeline.

284
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:24,072
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.

285
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,324
I'm gonna turn your lights down.

286
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,121
Regard the human brain.

287
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,503
Wait, hold on, hold on.

288
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,547
That's...
That's the universe. My bad.

289
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,507
But if I do that...

290
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,139
That's the brain.

291
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,641
Strangely mimetic, though,
wouldn't you say?

292
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,060
Wow, that's amazing.

293
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,811
Thanks, it's mine.

294
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,146
What?

295
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,106
This. You're inside my head.

296
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,275
It's a...
It's a live feed.

297
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,194
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.

298
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,988
Come on.

299
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:08,992
Now, pinch my arm.

300
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,162
I can take it. Pinch me.

301
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,581
What is that?

302
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,001
It's the primary somatosensory cortex.
It's the brain's pain centre.

303
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,588
But this is what I wanted to show you.

304
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:28,345
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses
our bio electrical potential

305
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:31,348
and it goes here.

306
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:34,643
This is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us

307
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,520
is that our mind,

308
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,105
our entire DNA, in fact,

309
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,107
is destined to be upgraded.

310
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,358
Wow.

311
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,152
Wait...

312
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,409
Hello?

313
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,370
- Is this Forehead Of Security?
- What?

314
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,205
You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?

315
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:56,581
I'm working.
I've got something going on, here.

316
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:57,791
What, harassing interns?

317
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,167
<i>Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened</i>

318
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,252
<i>when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?</i>

319
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,295
<i>They would laugh in my face.</i>

320
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,756
<i>I had to leave
while I still had a shred of dignity.</i>

321
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,675
<i>Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.</i>

322
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,552
What's going on? Fill me in.

323
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:09,845
- <i>For real?</i>
- Yeah.

324
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,513
<i>All right.
She's meeting up with this scientist.</i>

325
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,223
- <i>Rich guy. Handsome.</i>
- Right.

326
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,725
<i>I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.</i>

327
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:16,810
- Yeah, you're the best.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

328
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,228
<i>Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.</i>

329
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,856
<i>Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...</i>

330
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,567
<i>Where were we in '99?
The science conference?</i>

331
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,194
- Switzerland.
- Right, right, exactly.

332
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,779
Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.

333
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,364
Of course you don't remember him.
He's not a blond with a big rack.

334
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,074
<i>At first, it was fine.
They were talking business.</i>

335
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,327
But now it's getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.

336
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,163
- His what?
- <i>Big brain.</i>

337
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,664
<i>And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.</i>

338
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,875
Hold on. See?

339
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,459
<i>Look at what? You, watching them?</i>

340
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,545
<i>Flip the screen,
and then we can get started.</i>

341
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,464
I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.

342
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,300
Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.

343
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,593
I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!

344
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,429
<i>Don't talk to me like that any more.
You're not my boss.</i>

345
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:53,930
<i>All right?
I don't work for you.</i>

346
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,641
<i>And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.</i>

347
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:57,767
<i>He's shifty.</i>

348
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:58,852
- Relax.
- <i>Seriously?</i>

349
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,437
I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.

350
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:01,855
Tell them to go out
for a drink or something.

351
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,607
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.

352
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,442
This woman's the best thing
that ever happened to you

353
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,943
and you're just ignoring her.

354
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,111
- A giant brain?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

355
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,529
There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.

356
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,157
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna
run his plates and I'm gonna...

357
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,783
You know,
if it gets rough, so be it.

358
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,619
I miss you, Happy.

359
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,787
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.

360
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,122
<i>Now you're off with the super-friends.</i>

361
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,415
<i>I don't know what's going on
with you any more.</i>

362
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,541
- <i>The world's getting weird.</i>
- Hey!

363
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,626
I hate to cut you off.

364
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,710
- Do you have your Taser on you?
- <i>Why?</i>

365
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,004
I think there's a gal in H.R.
who's trying to steal some printer ink.

366
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,173
You should probably go over there
and zap her.

367
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,549
<i>Yeah, nice.</i>

368
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,471
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism

369
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,598
and recode its DNA.

370
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,683
That would be incredible.

371
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,479
Unfortunately, to my ears,
it also sounds highly weapon is able.

372
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:46,233
As in, enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is...

373
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,984
Tony, Tony.

374
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:53,782
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM
13 years ago.

375
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:54,908
He turned me down.

376
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:59,454
But something tells me,
now there's a new genius on the throne

377
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,791
who doesn't have to
answer to Tony any more

378
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,834
and who has slightly less of an ego.

379
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,922
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.

380
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,384
As much as I'd like to help you.

381
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:17,013
Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.

382
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,807
But then, as my father used to say,

383
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,643
"Failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph."

384
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,186
That's very deep.

385
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,688
And I have no idea what it means.

386
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:28,650
No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.

387
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,695
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.

388
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,455
Happy.

389
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,625
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.

390
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,462
Yes, I just...

391
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,966
God, I forgot my other things, so...

392
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,176
I'm just gonna...

393
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:23,913
I'm sorry I'm late. I was...

394
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,373
What the...
What is that?

395
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,960
You're wearing this in the house now?

396
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,628
What is that, like, Mark 15?

397
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,507
Yeah. Something like that.
You know, everybody needs a hobby.

398
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,801
And you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?

399
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,595
Just breaking it in.

400
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,806
You know, it's always a little pinchy
in the gooey bag at first, so...

401
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,059
Well, hey, did you see
your Christmas present?

402
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,477
Yes, I did. I...

403
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,063
I don't know how I could've
missed that Christmas present.

404
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,190
Is it gonna fit through the door?

405
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,608
Well, actually, it's a good question.

406
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,235
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow.
They're gonna blow out that wall.

407
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,779
- Okay.
- So...

408
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,530
Tense? Good day? Huh?

409
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,283
Shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.

410
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,953
I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?

411
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,163
Did I like it?

412
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,998
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.

413
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,876
I appreciate the thought very much.

414
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:14,547
So, why don't you lift up that face mask
and give me a kiss?

415
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,344
Yep. Damn it, no can do.

416
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:23,306
You want to just kiss it
on the... The facial slit?

417
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,392
Well, why don't I
run down to the garage

418
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:28,061
and see if I can't find a crowbar
to jimmy that thing open?

419
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,813
Crowbar, yeah.

420
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,232
Except there's been a radiation leak.

421
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,234
- I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.

422
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,445
At least, let me get you, like,
a Hazmat suit.

423
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,907
A Geiger counter or something like that.

424
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,118
Busted.

425
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,788
- This is a new level of lame.
- Sorry.

426
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,332
You ate without me already?
On date night?

427
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,418
- He was just...
- You mean you.

428
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:54,170
Well, yeah, I just mean
we were hosting you...

429
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,173
...while I finished up a little work.

430
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,550
And yes, I had a quick bite.

431
00:20:58,633 --> 00:20:59,592
I didn't know if you were coming home

432
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,428
or you were having drinks
with Aldrich Killian.

433
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,558
- What?
- What?

434
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,227
Aldrich Killian?
What, are you checking up on me?

435
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,311
Happy was concerned.

436
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,521
- You're spying on me.
- I wasn't.

437
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,730
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on.

438
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,275
Come on. Pep?

439
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,359
Hey, I admit it.

440
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:19,487
My fault. Sorry.

441
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,699
I'm a piping hot mess.

442
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:27,871
It's been going on for a while.
I haven't said anything.

443
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,457
Nothing's been the same
since New York.

444
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:35,003
Really? I didn't notice that at all.

445
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,672
You experience things

446
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,382
and then they're over,
and you still can't explain them.

447
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,637
Gods, aliens, other dimensions.
I'm just a man in a can.

448
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,097
The only reason I haven't cracked up

449
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,141
is probably because you moved in.

450
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,642
Which is great.

451
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,269
I love you. I'm lucky.

452
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:54,314
But honey, I can't sleep.

453
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:58,735
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know.

454
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,570
I tinker. I...

455
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,490
Threat is imminent.

456
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:07,202
And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.

457
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,995
That's you.

458
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,331
And my suits, they're...

459
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:12,415
Machines.

460
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,250
They're part of me.

461
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,503
A distraction.

462
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,671
Maybe.

463
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,358
I'm gonna take a shower.

464
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,151
Okay.

465
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:43,613
And you're gonna join me.

466
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,741
Better.

467
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,511
Tony.

468
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,639
Tony. Tony.

469
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,100
To...

470
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,521
Power down!

471
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,322
I must have called it in my sleep.

472
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,700
That's not supposed to happen.

473
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,204
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

474
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:38,084
Can we just... Just let me...

475
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,587
Just let me catch my breath. Hey,
don't... Don't go. All right? Pepper...

476
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,797
I'm going to sleep downstairs.

477
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,133
Tinker with that.

478
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:12,827
Can you regulate?

479
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:13,953
Yes, I can regulate.

480
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,163
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

481
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,133
It's a decent batch.

482
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:30,553
- Don't say I never did nothing for you.
- Thank you.

483
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,141
I mean, for understanding.

484
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:44,734
I'm sorry, buddy.

485
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,126
What are you doing, buddy?

486
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,544
You out by yourself?
A little date night?

487
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:04,712
Seeing your favourite
chick flick, maybe?

488
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,006
Yeah, a little movie
called <i>The Party's Over,</i>

489
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,966
starring you and your junkie girlfriend.

490
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,051
Here's the ticket.

491
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,428
No kidding. That doesn't belong to you.

492
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:39,956
Savin!

493
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:42,125
Help!

494
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,001
Help me!

515
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:32,837
He's a stickler for that sort of thing.

516
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,048
Plus, my guys
won't let anyone in without them.

517
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,175
We're awaiting the arrival
of Tony Stark.

518
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,802
We're hoping he'll give us
the reaction...

519
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,512
His reaction
to the latest attack.

520
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:44,181
Mr Stark, hi there.

521
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:47,518
Our sources are telling us that all signs
are pointing to another Mandarin attack.

522
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,729
Anything else you can tell us?

523
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:52,815
Hey, Mr Stark.
When is somebody gonna kill this guy?

524
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:54,650
I'm just saying.

525
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,780
Is that what you want?

526
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,659
Here's a little holiday greeting

527
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:06,162
I've been wanting to send
to the Mandarin.

528
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,623
I just didn't know
how to phrase it until now.

529
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:12,376
My name is Tony Stark
and I'm not afraid of you.

530
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,504
I know you're a coward.
So I've decided

531
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:17,840
that you just died, pal.

532
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,051
I'm gonna come get the body.

533
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:22,887
There's no politics here.
It's just good old-fashioned revenge.

534
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,182
There's no Pentagon,
it's just you and me.

535
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:30,102
And on the off chance you're a man,
here's my home address.

536
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:33,689
10880 Malibu Point.

537
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:35,942
90265.

538
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,860
I'll leave the door unlocked.

539
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:38,945
That's what you wanted, right?

540
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,033
Bill me.

541
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:51,457
<i>I've compiled
a Mandarin database for you, sir,</i>

542
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,753
<i>drawn from
S.H.I.E.L.D., FBI and CIA intercepts.</i>

543
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,381
<i>Initiating virtual crime scene
reconstruction.</i>

544
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:04,345
Okay. What have we got here?

545
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:08,766
The name is an ancient Chinese war
mantle meaning "advisor to the king."

546
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:12,144
South American insurgency tactics.

547
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,689
Talks like a Baptist preacher.

548
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:19,110
There's lots of pageantry going on here.
Lots of theatre. Close.

549
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:22,780
<i>The heat from the blast was in excess
of 3,000 degrees Celsius.</i>

550
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:26,492
<i>Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporised instantly.</i>

551
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,245
No bomb parts found in a three-mile
radius of the Chinese Theatre?

552
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,329
<i>No, sir.</i>

553
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:33,374
Talk to me, Happy.

554
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:54,020
When is a bomb not a bomb?

555
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:06,449
Any military victims?

556
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,076
<i>Not according to public record, sir.</i>

557
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,287
Bring up
the thermogenic signatures again.

558
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,080
Factor in 3,000 degrees.

559
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:15,875
<i>The Oracle cloud
has completed analysis.</i>

560
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,043
<i>Accessing satellites</i>

561
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:21,005
<i>and plotting the last 12 months
of thermogenic occurrences now.</i>

562
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:24,133
Take away everywhere
that there's been a Mandarin attack.

563
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,598
Nope.

564
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,731
That.
Are you sure that's not one of his?

565
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,275
<i>It predates any known Mandarin attack.</i>

566
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:44,195
<i>The incident was the use of a bomb
to assist a suicide.</i>

567
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:46,113
Bring her around.

568
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,200
<i>The heat signature
is remarkably similar.</i>

569
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,327
<i>3,000 degree Celsius.</i>

570
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,206
That's two military guys.

571
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:57,166
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

572
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,169
<i>Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.</i>

573
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,259
Are we still at ding-dong?

574
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:09,762
We're supposed to be on total...

575
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:10,971
...security lockdown.

576
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:12,807
Come on, I threatened a terrorist.
Who is that?

577
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,601
<i>There's only so much I can do, sir,</i>

578
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:19,605
<i>when you give the world's press
your home address.</i>

579
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,866
Right there is fine.

580
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,580
You're not the Mandarin.

581
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:38,749
Are you? Are you?

582
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,919
You don't remember.

583
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,129
Why am I not surprised?

584
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:45,464
Don't take it personally. I don't
remember what I had for breakfast.

585
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,007
<i>Gluten-free waffles, sir.</i>

586
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:48,384
That's right.

587
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,387
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here.

588
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,471
It's urgent.

589
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:58,769
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship.

590
00:32:58,853 --> 00:32:59,895
It's...

591
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,731
- With her.
- Tony?

592
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:07,278
- Is somebody there?
- Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.

593
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,405
Old botanist pal

594
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,866
that I used to know, barely.

595
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,659
Please don't tell me
there's a 12-year-old kid

596
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:14,827
waiting in the car that I've never met.

597
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,911
He's 13.

598
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,788
No, I need your help.

599
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,456
But, what for? Why now?

600
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,793
Because I read the papers, and frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.

601
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:23,919
I'll be fine.

602
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,464
I'm sorry, with Happy in the hospital,
I didn't know we were expecting guests.

603
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:29,425
- We weren't.
- And old girlfriends.

604
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,260
- She's not, really.
- No, not really.

605
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,513
- It was just one night.
- Yep.

606
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,307
That's how you did it, isn't it?

607
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,726
- It was a great night.
- Yep. Well, you know.

608
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,728
- You saved yourself a world of pain.
- What?

609
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,396
- I'm sure.
- Trust me. We're going out of town.

610
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,480
Okay. We've been through this.

611
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:44,607
- Nope.
- Yep!

612
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,609
- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.

613
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,235
- Honey...
- Great idea. Let's go.

614
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:50,946
I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea.
Please don't touch her bags.

615
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,531
This is how normal people behave.

616
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,783
I can't protect you out there.

617
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,702
Is... Is that normal?

618
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:58,954
- Sadly, that is very normal.
- Yes, this is normal!

619
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:00,706
It's a big bunny. Relax about it!

620
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,041
Calm down.

621
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:04,043
- I got this for you.
- I'm aware of that.

622
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,461
You still haven't even
told me you liked it.

623
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,837
I don't like it.

624
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:07,922
I asked you three...
You don't like it.

625
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,215
- We are leaving the house.
- Guys?

626
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:10,382
That's not even up for discussion.

627
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,676
- Can we...
- I said no. What?

628
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,969
Do we need to worry about that?

629
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:04,478
I got you.

630
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,730
I got you first.

631
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,148
Like I said, we can't stay here.

632
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,535
Move! I'm right behind you.

633
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:24,748
Get her. I'm gonna find a way around.

634
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,543
Stop stopping. Get her. Get outside.

635
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:29,670
Go!

636
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,777
Oh, my God. Tony!

637
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:10,919
<i>Sir, Ms Potts
is clear of the structure.</i>

638
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,370
Jarvis, where's my flight power?

639
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,497
<i>Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.</i>

640
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,596
That's one.

641
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,101
<i>Sir, the suit is not combat ready.</i>

642
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,201
That's two.

643
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,067
Tony!

644
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:14,603
<i>Sir, take a deep breath.</i>

645
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,162
<i>Flight power restored.</i>

646
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:48,637
<i>Sir?</i>

647
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,430
<i>Sir!</i>

648
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,559
All right, kill the alarm. I got it.

649
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:57,688
<i>That's the emergency alert triggered by
the power dropping below 5%.</i>

650
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:37,644
It's snowing, right?
Where are we, upstate?

651
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:41,440
<i>We are five miles outside of
Rose Hill, Tennessee.</i>

652
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:42,941
Why?

653
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:45,694
Jarvis. Not my idea.

654
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,488
What are we doing here?
This is thousands of miles away!

655
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:49,990
I gotta get Pepper.

656
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,826
<i>I prepared a flight plan.
This was the location.</i>

657
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:53,910
Who asked you?

658
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:55,954
Open the suit.

659
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,247
<i>I... I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.</i>

660
00:40:57,331 --> 00:40:58,332
Open it, J.

661
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:06,506
That's brisk.

662
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:16,308
Maybe I'll just cosy back up for a...

663
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:19,311
<i>I actually think
I need to sleep now, sir.</i>

664
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:20,979
Jarvis.

665
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,566
Jarvis?

666
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,237
Don't leave me, buddy.

667
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:54,596
<i>Stark secure server now transferring
to all known receivers.</i>

668
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,014
<i>Pepper, it's me.</i>

669
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,393
I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time.

670
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,354
So... First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.

671
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:06,191
That was selfish and stupid,
and it won't happen again.

672
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:09,361
Also, it's Christmastime
and the rabbit's too big.

673
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,446
Done. Sorry.

674
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,533
And I'm sorry in advance

675
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:16,576
because I can't come home yet.

676
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,788
<i>I need to find this guy.</i>

677
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,708
<i>You gotta stay safe, that's all I know.</i>

678
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,128
<i>I just stole a poncho
from a wooden Indian.</i>

679
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,653
Let's get you comfy.

680
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,366
You happy now?

681
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,753
Freeze!

682
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,339
Don't move.

683
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,341
You got me.

684
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,595
Nice potato gun.

685
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:18,263
Barrel's a little long.

686
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:22,267
Between that and the wide gauge,
it's gonna diminish your FPS.

687
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:27,689
And now you're out of ammo.

688
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,233
What's that thing on your chest?

689
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:33,445
It's an electromagnet.

690
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,113
You should know,
you got a box of them right here.

691
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,032
What does it power?

692
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,959
Oh, my God.

693
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,253
That...

694
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,674
That's...
Is that Iron Man?

695
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:56,301
Technically, I am.

696
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:59,054
Technically, you're dead.

697
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:02,098
Valid point.

698
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,558
What happened to him?

699
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:05,060
Life.

700
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:07,729
I built him. I take care of him.

701
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:10,732
I'll fix him.

702
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:11,858
Like a mechanic?

703
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:13,401
Yeah.

704
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:17,823
If I was building
Iron Man and War Machine...

705
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:18,990
It's "Iron Patriot" now.

706
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:20,242
That's way cooler.

707
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,660
No, it's not.

708
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:25,789
Anyways, I would have added in
the retro...

709
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,458
- Retro-reflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.

710
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,460
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?

711
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:31,837
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.

712
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:34,005
- Not a good idea.
- Oops.

713
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,424
What are you doing?
You're gonna break his finger?

714
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:38,051
He's in pain. He's been injured.
Leave him alone.

715
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,177
Sorry.

716
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,762
Are you?

717
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:44,558
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.

718
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,351
So, who's home?

719
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:50,814
My mom already left for the diner,
and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.

720
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:54,943
I guess he won,
because that was six years ago.

721
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:58,905
Which happens. Dads leave.
No need to be a pussy about it.

722
00:44:58,989 --> 00:44:59,990
Here's what I need.

723
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,535
A laptop, a digital watch,
a cell phone,

724
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:06,037
the pneumatic actuator
from your bazooka over there,

725
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:09,499
a map of town, a big spring
and a tuna fish sandwich.

726
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:11,710
What's in it for me?

727
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,546
- Salvation. What's his name?
- Who?

728
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:18,049
The kid that bullies you at school.
What's his name?

729
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:19,634
How'd you know that?

730
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:21,970
I got just the thing.

731
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:27,267
This is a <i>piñata</i> for a cricket.

732
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,643
I'm kidding.
This is a very powerful weapon.

733
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:32,397
Point it away from your face,
press the button on top,

734
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,565
it discourages bullying.

735
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:37,986
Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass.
Deal?

736
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,487
Deal? What do you say?

737
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,406
- Deal.
- Deal?

738
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:43,867
What's your name?

739
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:46,494
Harley. And you're...

740
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:47,954
The mechanic.

741
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:50,248
Tony.

742
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,210
You know what keeps
going through my head?

743
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:55,879
"Where's my sandwich?"

744
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:06,181
Where is Tony Stark?

745
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,254
<i>Stark secure server.
Retinal scan verified.</i>

746
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:39,464
<i>Pepper, it's me.</i>

747
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,467
<i>I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time.</i>

748
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:45,595
<i>So... First off I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.</i>

749
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:48,056
<i>That was selfish and stupid
and it won't happen again.</i>

750
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:51,810
Why were you at the house tonight?

751
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:55,397
What was so important
that you had to speak to Tony?

752
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:02,195
I think that my boss
is working for the Mandarin.

753
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:04,948
So, if you still want to talk about it

754
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:08,118
I suggest that we get
ourselves someplace safe.

755
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:12,288
Your boss works for the Mandarin,
you think?

756
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,582
But Tony says you're a botanist. So...

757
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:17,419
That figures. What I actually am
is a biological DNA coder

758
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:19,838
running a team of 40
out of a privately funded think tank.

759
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,631
But sure, you can call me a botanist.

760
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:26,052
This boss of yours,
does he have a name?

761
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:28,888
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

762
00:47:32,142 --> 00:47:34,477
<i>We took the house down, sir.
But there's no sign of a body.</i>

763
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:35,603
- I see.
- <i>No Stark.</i>

764
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:38,314
I have to go.

765
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:40,650
The master is about to record
and he's a little...

766
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:43,319
Well, you know how he gets.

767
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:46,948
Keep your appointment tonight
and call me when it's done.

768
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:54,539
All right, everybody.
No talking and no eye contact.

769
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:56,916
Unless you want to get shot in the face.

770
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:09,637
Report in.

771
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:12,682
Path is clear.

772
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:19,147
The master is travelling.

773
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:37,040
Well, then, what are we waiting for?

774
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:41,336
The sandwich was fair,
the spring was a little rusty,

775
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,838
the rest of the materials, I'll make do.

776
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,632
By the way,
when you said your sister had a watch...

777
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:46,800
- Yeah?
- ...I was kind of hoping

778
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:49,219
for something a little more
adult than that.

779
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:52,931
She's six.
Anyway, it's a limited edition.

780
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,432
When can we talk about New York?

781
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:56,392
Maybe never. Relax about it.

782
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:57,936
What about the Avengers?
Can we talk about them?

783
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:00,230
I dunno. Later.
Hey, kid, give me a little space.

784
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:07,862
What's the official story here?
What happened?

785
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:12,492
I guess this guy named Chad Davis
used to live roundabouts.

786
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:15,995
He won a bunch of medals in the army.

787
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,333
And one day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.

788
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:23,086
Then he blew himself up, right here.

789
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:31,177
- Six people died, right?
- Yeah.

790
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:33,012
- Including Chad Davis.
- Yeah, yeah.

791
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:42,564
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.

792
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:44,899
Think about it.

793
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,569
Six dead. Only five shadows.

794
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:49,154
Yeah.

795
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:52,073
People said these shadows are
like the marks of souls going to heaven.

796
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:55,535
Except the bomb guy.

797
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:59,497
He went to hell,
on account of he didn't get a shadow.

798
00:49:59,581 --> 00:50:00,999
That's why there's only five.

799
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:04,043
- Do you buy that?
- It's what everyone says.

800
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:09,799
You know what
this crater reminds me of?

801
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:12,343
No idea. I'm not...
I don't care.

802
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:18,057
That giant wormhole in New York.

803
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,560
Does it remind you?

804
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:22,687
That's manipulative.
I don't want to talk about it.

805
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,731
Are they coming back? The aliens?

806
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:26,107
Maybe. Can you stop?

807
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:29,986
Remember what I told you,
that I have an anxiety issue?

808
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,863
Does this subject make you edgy?

809
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,199
Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch
my breath for a second?

810
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:36,117
Are there bad guys in Rose Hill?

811
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:38,620
Do you need a plastic bag
to breathe into?

812
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,496
- Do you have medication?
- No.

813
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:41,998
- Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.

814
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:43,541
- Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.

815
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,126
Are you going completely mental?

816
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:47,462
I can stop. Do you want me to stop?

817
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,464
Remember when I said
to stop doing that?

818
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,091
I swear that you're gonna freak me out.

819
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:56,512
Man, you did it, didn't you?
You happy now?

820
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:57,639
What did I say?

821
00:50:58,181 --> 00:50:59,390
Hey! Wait up!

822
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:02,268
Wait, wait.

823
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:08,983
What the hell was that?

824
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:15,156
Your fault. You spazzed me out.

825
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:19,202
Okay, back to business.
Where were we?

826
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:20,495
The guy who died.

827
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:23,706
Relatives? Mom?
Mrs Davis, where is she?

828
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:24,832
Where she always is.

829
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:27,543
See? Now, you're being helpful.

830
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:34,050
Sorry.

831
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:35,593
Lady?

832
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,513
Is this...

833
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:40,556
Thank you.

834
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:45,687
Nice haircut. It suits you.

835
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:47,230
Nice watch.

836
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,940
Yeah. A limited edition.

837
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:51,526
I don't doubt it.

838
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:53,820
Well, have a good evening.

839
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:07,542
Excuse me.

840
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:18,886
Mrs Davis?

841
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:20,638
Mind if I join you?

842
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:22,515
Free country.

843
00:52:23,016 --> 00:52:24,475
Sure is.

844
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,606
All right.

845
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:33,568
Where would you like to start?

846
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:37,113
I just want to say,
I'm sorry about your loss.

847
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:38,656
I want to know
what you think happened.

848
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:45,747
Look, I brought your damn file.
You take it, go.

849
00:52:46,748 --> 00:52:50,501
Whatever was in here,
he wanted no part of it.

850
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:54,464
Clearly, you're waiting
for someone else. Huh?

851
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:55,757
Supposed to meet someone here?

852
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:56,883
Yeah.

853
00:53:10,772 --> 00:53:13,149
Mrs Davis,
your son didn't kill himself.

854
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:15,109
I guarantee you, he didn't kill anyone.

855
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:17,945
Someone used him.

856
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,281
What?

857
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,867
As a weapon.

858
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:30,375
You're not the person
that called me after all, are you?

859
00:53:31,084 --> 00:53:32,293
Actually, I am.

860
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:39,634
Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about?
What the hell is going on here?

861
00:53:40,093 --> 00:53:41,719
It's called an arrest.

862
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:45,807
- Sheriff, is it?
- Yes, ma'am, it is. And you are?

863
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,934
Homeland Security. We good here?

864
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:49,852
No, we're not "good."

865
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:51,437
I need a little more information
than that.

866
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,898
I think it's a little above
your pay grade, Sheriff.

867
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:57,443
Yeah? Why don't you get on the horn
to Nashville, and upgrade me?

868
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:01,322
All right. You know what?
I was hoping to do this the smart way

869
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:03,157
but the fun way is always good.

870
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,035
Deputy, get this woman out of...

871
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,093
Hey, hot wings, you want to party?
Come on, you and me, let's go.

872
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,859
- Crazy, huh?
- Yep.

873
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,403
Watch this.

874
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:50,389
You walked right into this one.
I've dated hotter chicks than you.

875
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:52,767
That's all you got?

876
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,686
A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?

877
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:59,148
Sweetheart, that could be
the name of my autobiography.

878
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,961
- Let me go!
- Help me!

879
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:07,341
Anyway.

880
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,595
Hey, kid,
what would you like for Christmas?

881
00:57:10,678 --> 00:57:12,638
Mr Stark, I am so sorry.

882
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:13,931
No, no, no.
I think he was trying to say,

883
00:57:14,015 --> 00:57:15,933
"I want my goddamn file."

884
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:17,393
It's not your fault, kid.

885
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,897
Remember what I told you
about bullies?

886
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:29,572
You like that, Westworld?

887
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:31,407
That's the thing about smart guys,

888
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,993
we always cover our ass.

889
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,102
You're welcome.

890
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:02,772
For what? Did I miss something?

891
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:04,815
Me, saving your life.

892
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:08,027
Yeah. A, I saved you first.
B, thanks. Sort of.

893
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,863
And C, if you do someone a solid,
don't be a yutz.

894
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:14,241
All right? Just play it cool.
Otherwise you come off grandiose.

895
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:16,118
Unlike you?

896
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:19,580
Admit it, you need me.

897
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,207
We're connected.

898
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,334
What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,

899
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,836
keep your trap shut, guard the suit,

900
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,171
and stay connected to the telephone,

901
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,964
because if I call,
you better pick up. Okay?

902
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:32,176
Can you feel that? We're done here.

903
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,511
Move out of the way,
or I'm gonna run you over.

904
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:35,304
Bye, kid.

905
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:43,396
I'm sorry, kid.

906
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:45,106
You did good.

907
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:48,067
So, now you're just gonna
leave me here, like my dad?

908
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:51,195
Yeah.

909
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:54,031
Wait, you're guilt-tripping me,
aren't you?

910
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:55,741
I'm cold.

911
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,285
I can tell. You know how I can tell?

912
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,288
Because we're connected.

913
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,211
It was worth a shot.

914
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,976
<i>You get this.
It's affordable. It's gorgeous.</i>

915
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,436
<i>It goes with any décor...</i>

916
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,648
- What happened to picture?
- Go to override.

917
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,736
- How is this happening again?
- Fine. Override to Los Angeles.

918
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:32,820
<i>I'm trying. There's nothing I can...</i>

919
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:33,904
<i>Well, where is the feed coming from?</i>

920
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:36,073
<i>I don't know,
it's in all of our receivers and I...</i>

921
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:38,284
The entire East Coast,
the satellites are down.

922
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,702
It's not just our station.

923
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:40,870
What about a backup manual?

924
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:42,997
<i>We have an unauthorised
broadcast cutting through...</i>

925
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:47,042
Mr Vice President,
I think you should see this.

926
00:59:48,878 --> 00:59:50,504
Oh, God, not again.

927
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,339
Is the President getting this?

928
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:05,186
<i>Mr President.</i>

929
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:07,438
<i>Only two lessons remain.</i>

930
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:11,567
<i>And I intend to finish this
before Christmas morning.</i>

931
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:14,403
<i>Meet Thomas Richards.</i>

932
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:17,656
<i>Good strong name. Good strong job.</i>

933
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:23,537
<i>Thomas, here, is an accountant
for the Roxxon Oil Corporation.</i>

934
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,542
But I'm sure he's a really good guy.

935
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,046
I'm going to shoot him in the head,

936
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:35,633
live on your television, in 30 seconds.

937
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:36,842
No!

938
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:40,304
The number for this telephone
is in your cell phone.

939
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:43,516
Exciting, isn't it,
imagining how it got there?

940
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:45,351
<i>America,</i>

941
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:48,562
<i>if your president calls me
in the next half-minute,</i>

942
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:50,356
<i>Tom lives.</i>

943
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,440
<i>Go!</i>

944
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:55,027
How did he hack my phone?

945
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,071
We can't allow terrorists to dictate...

946
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,405
I have to make this call.

947
01:00:58,572 --> 01:00:59,865
I'd strongly advise against that.

948
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:02,576
This is the right thing to do.

949
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:31,564
<i>There's just one lesson left,
President Ellis.</i>

950
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:33,524
So run away, hide,
kiss your children goodbye.

951
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:34,608
Because nothing,

952
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:37,111
not your army, not your red, white
and blue attack dog,

953
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,196
can save you.

954
01:01:41,574 --> 01:01:43,659
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

955
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:49,123
Tell Rhodes,
find this lunatic right now.

956
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:50,916
Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.

957
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,835
We have a possible point of origin
in Pakistan

958
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:54,044
and the Patriot is ready to strike.

959
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:56,297
- Right now.
- Yes, sir.

960
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,146
Man. Happy, Happy, Happy.

961
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:28,203
Don't move!

962
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:35,502
Hang on a second.

963
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:37,379
Hello?

964
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:39,214
You ever have a chick straddling you,
and you look up

965
01:02:39,298 --> 01:02:43,135
and suddenly she's glowing from
the inside out, kind of a bright orange?

966
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:44,720
Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?

967
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:45,763
<i>It's me, pal.</i>

968
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:47,932
Now, last time I went missing,
if I remember correctly,

969
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:50,017
you came looking for me.
What are you doing?

970
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,477
A little knock-and-talk,
making friends in Pakistan.

971
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,561
What are you doing?

972
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:55,773
Your redesign, your big rebrand,
that was AIM, right?

973
01:02:55,856 --> 01:02:56,857
Yeah.

974
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:00,819
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty
comm sat now, I need your login.

975
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,155
It's the same as it's always been,
"WarMachine68."

976
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:04,281
And password, please.

977
01:03:04,365 --> 01:03:06,408
Look, I gotta change it
every time you hack in, Tony.

978
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:08,827
It's not the 80s,
nobody says "hack" any more.

979
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:09,912
Give me your login.

980
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,958
"WAR MACHINE ROX"
with an "X," all caps.

981
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,671
Yeah, okay.

982
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:22,007
That is so much better
than "Iron Patriot."

983
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:31,684
<i>Very nice. Very nice.</i>

984
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:34,478
<i>I have one question for you.</i>

985
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:37,106
<i>What would you like
for Christmas this year?</i>

986
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,234
<i>Well, David...</i>

987
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:47,116
Do not erase a programme from
my DVR unless you are 100% sure...

988
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,498
<i>One more time!
Ms Elk Ridge, everybody! All right.</i>

989
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:59,211
Because you erase my shows!

990
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:05,009
That ain't gonna cut it.

991
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:07,219
We talked about this.

992
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:10,806
Excuse me, sir. I don't know who...

993
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:15,936
Mom, I need to call you back.
Something magical is happening.

994
01:04:17,146 --> 01:04:19,064
- Tony Stark is in my van.
- Keep it down.

995
01:04:19,148 --> 01:04:20,691
- Tony Stark is in my van!
- No, he's not.

996
01:04:20,816 --> 01:04:21,817
I knew you were still alive!

997
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:23,569
Come on in. Close the door.

998
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:29,742
Wow. Can I just say, sir...

999
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:30,951
Yep.

1000
01:04:31,744 --> 01:04:32,911
I am your biggest fan.

1001
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:34,955
First, is this your van?
Is anyone else gonna come in?

1002
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:36,290
No, no, no. Just us.

1003
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:37,458
Great. What's your name?

1004
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,126
- Gary.
- Gary.

1005
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:42,254
- Wow.
- Right there is fine.

1006
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:43,547
- Okay.
- Okay?

1007
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,757
I get a lot of this, it's okay.

1008
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:47,176
- Good. Can I just say?
- What do you want? Yeah.

1009
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:50,679
I don't know if you can tell,

1010
01:04:50,763 --> 01:04:52,890
but I have patterned
my whole look after you.

1011
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:54,349
- My hair's a little...
- It's fine.

1012
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:55,976
It's not right,
'cause there's no product in it.

1013
01:04:56,143 --> 01:04:57,853
Right.

1014
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:01,982
I don't want to make things awkward
for you, but I do have to show you...

1015
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,442
Boom!

1016
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:06,653
A Hispanic Scott Baio.

1017
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:09,448
- I'm sorry. Is that me?
- Yeah. It's... I mean...

1018
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:14,286
I had them do it off a doll that I made,
so it's not like it's off a picture.

1019
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:17,831
- So it's a little bit...
- Gary. Listen to me, okay?

1020
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:21,835
I don't want to clip your wings, here.
We're both a little over-excited.

1021
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,837
I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys.

1022
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:26,632
I'm trying to grab a little something
from some hard-crypt data files.

1023
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:27,841
I don't have enough juice.

1024
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,260
I need you to jump on the roof...
Right?

1025
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:32,554
Recalibrate the ISDNs.

1026
01:05:32,638 --> 01:05:34,681
Pump it up by about 40%.

1027
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,266
- Got it.
- All right? It's a mission.

1028
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:37,351
Yeah.

1029
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,436
Tony needs Gary.

1030
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,687
And Gary needs Tony.

1031
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:42,106
- Be quiet about it. Go.
- Yeah.

1032
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:09,174
<i>What would you regard
as the defining moment of your life?</i>

1033
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:12,136
<i>I think that would be the day
I decided not to let my injury beat me.</i>

1034
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:16,473
<i>Will you please state your name
for the camera?</i>

1035
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:17,808
<i>Ellen Brandt.</i>

1036
01:06:18,225 --> 01:06:22,229
<i>Okay. So, the injections
are administered periodically.</i>

1037
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:23,730
<i>Addiction will not be tolerated.</i>

1038
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:26,775
<i>Those who cannot regulate
will be cut from the programme.</i>

1039
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:30,988
<i>Once misfits, cripples...</i>

1040
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:34,741
<i>You are the next iteration
of human evolution.</i>

1041
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:40,914
<i>Everybody, before we start...</i>

1042
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:44,209
<i>I promise you, looking back at your life,
there will be nothing as bitter</i>

1043
01:06:44,293 --> 01:06:48,422
<i>as the memory of that glorious risk
you prudently elected to for ego.</i>

1044
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,174
<i>Today is your glory.</i>

1045
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:51,341
<i>Let's begin.</i>

1046
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:03,937
<i>We gotta get out of here!
We gotta get out of here!</i>

1047
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:05,189
<i>Get her out!
Get them out of here!</i>

1048
01:07:12,446 --> 01:07:15,282
A bomb is not a bomb
when it's a misfire.

1049
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:19,995
The stuff doesn't always work.
Right, pal?

1050
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:22,289
It's faulty,
but you found a buyer, didn't you?

1051
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:24,708
Sold it to the Mandarin.

1052
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:27,544
Got you, pal.

1053
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:31,632
<i>What happened?</i>

1054
01:07:32,341 --> 01:07:34,301
Fun fact.

1055
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,512
Before he built rockets for the Nazis,

1056
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:42,017
the idealistic Wernher von Braun

1057
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:44,311
dreamed of space travel.

1058
01:07:45,604 --> 01:07:47,439
He stargazed.

1059
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:51,276
Do you know what he said
when the first V-2 hit London?

1060
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:55,739
"The rocket performed perfectly.

1061
01:07:57,658 --> 01:08:00,327
"It just landed on the wrong planet."

1062
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:05,999
See, we all begin wide-eyed.
Pure science.

1063
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:11,630
And then the ego steps in,
the obsession.

1064
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:14,967
And you look up,

1065
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:19,304
you're a long way from shore.

1066
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:22,391
You can't be too hard on yourself,
Maya.

1067
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:25,560
I mean, you gave your research
to a think tank.

1068
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:29,189
Yeah, but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.

1069
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:31,817
That's exactly what we used to do.

1070
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:34,111
So, don't judge yourself.

1071
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,614
Thank you, Pepper.

1072
01:08:38,824 --> 01:08:40,617
I really appreciate that.

1073
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:50,585
- Hi, good evening. Come on in.
- Good evening.

1074
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:53,755
Maya, run!

1075
01:08:56,258 --> 01:08:57,592
Hi, Pepper.

1076
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:01,388
So, you want to tell me why you
were at Stark's mansion last night?

1077
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:02,806
I'm trying to fix this thing.

1078
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:05,183
I didn't know you and the master
were gonna blow the place up.

1079
01:09:05,267 --> 01:09:08,645
I see. So, you were trying
to save Stark, when he threatened us?

1080
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:10,605
I've told you, Killian, we can use him.

1081
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:14,693
Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.

1082
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:17,738
Look, if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.

1083
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:21,366
He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now, he has one.

1084
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:27,914
<i>This is support team Blue-Zero.</i>

1085
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:30,667
<i>Sending coordinates for a suspected
Mandarin broadcast point of origin.</i>

1086
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,793
Copy.

1087
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,094
Nobody move.

1088
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:47,267
Support Blue-Zero,

1089
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:49,269
unless the Mandarin's next attack
on the U.S.

1090
01:09:49,353 --> 01:09:50,937
involves cheaply-made sportswear,

1091
01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:53,440
I think you messed up again.

1092
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:56,360
Yes, you're free, if you weren't before.

1093
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:57,694
It's... Of course.

1094
01:09:57,778 --> 01:09:58,779
Yes, ma'am.

1095
01:09:58,945 --> 01:09:59,988
Iron Patriot on the job.

1096
01:10:00,155 --> 01:10:01,156
Happy to help.

1097
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:02,449
No need to thank me, ma'am.

1098
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:03,825
It's my pleasure.

1099
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,211
Savin?
I've acquired the Patriot arm our.

1100
01:10:14,294 --> 01:10:15,545
If you want this suit,

1101
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,964
you're going to have to
pry my cold dead body out of it.

1102
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:19,758
That's the plan, Colonel.

1103
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:23,929
Harley, tell me what's happening.
Give me a full report.

1104
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:27,307
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy.
Do you want me to keep eating it?

1105
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:29,226
- How much have you had?
- Two or three bowls.

1106
01:10:29,518 --> 01:10:32,312
- <i>Can you still see straight?</i>
- Sort of.

1107
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:33,480
That means you're fine.
Give me Jarvis.

1108
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:35,399
<i>Jarvis, how are we?</i>

1109
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:37,734
<i>It's totally fine, sir.
I seem to do quite well for a stretch,</i>

1110
01:10:37,818 --> 01:10:40,862
<i>and then at the end of the sentence,
I say the wrong cranberry.</i>

1111
01:10:40,946 --> 01:10:42,239
<i>And, sir, you were right.</i>

1112
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,991
<i>Once I factored in
available AIM down link facilities</i>

1113
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:47,494
<i>I was able to pinpoint
the Mandarin's broadcast signal.</i>

1114
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:49,913
What are we talking?
Far East, Europe, North Africa...

1115
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:51,957
Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?

1116
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:53,458
<i>Actually, sir, it's in Miami.</i>

1117
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:56,420
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have
to walk you through

1118
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:57,879
rebooting Jarvis's speech drive,

1119
01:10:57,963 --> 01:10:59,381
but not right now.

1120
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:00,465
Harley, where is he really?

1121
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:02,050
<i>Just look on the screen
and tell me where it is.</i>

1122
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:06,221
It does say Miami, Florida.

1123
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:09,266
Okay, first things first, I need
the arm our. Where are we at with it?

1124
01:11:09,558 --> 01:11:10,767
It's not charging.

1125
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:21,319
<i>Actually, sir, it is charging,
but the power source is questionable.</i>

1126
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:23,822
<i>It may not succeed
in revitalising the Mark 42.</i>

1127
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,824
What's questionable about electricity?
All right?

1128
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:29,786
It's my suit, and I can't...
I'm not gonna... I don't wanna...

1129
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:31,830
Oh, God, not again.

1130
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,623
<i>Tony?</i>

1131
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,586
<i>Are you having another attack?</i>

1132
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:38,962
I didn't even mention New York.

1133
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:42,507
Right, and then you just said it by name
while denying having said it.

1134
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,384
Okay...

1135
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:47,679
God, what am I gonna do?

1136
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:51,308
Just breathe. Really, just breathe.

1137
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:54,227
You're a mechanic, right?

1138
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:55,770
Right.

1139
01:11:56,563 --> 01:11:57,939
<i>You said so.</i>

1140
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:00,400
Yes, I did.

1141
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:03,403
Why don't you just build something?

1142
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:16,458
Okay.

1143
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:18,502
<i>Thanks, kid.</i>

1144
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:07,277
Why is it so hot in here?
I told you to put it at 68.

1145
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,695
My fault again.

1146
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,531
Let me tell you something, sweetheart.
I am not your personal air con...

1147
01:15:11,883 --> 01:15:12,967
Well.

1148
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:16,805
I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.

1149
01:15:18,056 --> 01:15:20,392
Now, which one of you is Vanessa?

1150
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:21,768
That's me.

1151
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:23,395
Nessie.

1152
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:28,566
Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?

1153
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,151
There's some guy over here.

1154
01:15:30,235 --> 01:15:33,446
They're made by Americans,
based on a Japanese recipe.

1155
01:15:33,697 --> 01:15:34,739
Hey!

1156
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:37,867
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

1157
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:39,494
Don't move.

1158
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:41,705
I'm not moving.
You want something? Take it.

1159
01:15:41,788 --> 01:15:42,789
Although the guns are all fake

1160
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,708
because those wankers
wouldn't trust me with the real ones.

1161
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:47,043
- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

1162
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,296
Heard enough.

1163
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,465
You're not him.
The Mandarin, the real guy.

1164
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:53,675
Where?

1165
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,927
Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?

1166
01:15:56,428 --> 01:15:58,972
He's here.
He's here, but he's not here.

1167
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:00,640
- He's here, but he's not here.
- What do you mean?

1168
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,809
It's complicated.
Hey, it's complicated.

1169
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:04,644
- It is.
- It's complicated.

1170
01:16:04,853 --> 01:16:06,062
Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out.

1171
01:16:06,146 --> 01:16:07,188
Get out of the bed.
Get into the bathroom.

1172
01:16:10,442 --> 01:16:11,651
Sit.

1173
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:13,778
Oh, Jesus.

1174
01:16:20,869 --> 01:16:23,955
My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1175
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:25,081
What are you?

1176
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:27,792
A decoy? You're a double, right?

1177
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:30,962
You mean like an understudy?
No, absolutely not.

1178
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:33,840
Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.

1179
01:16:34,549 --> 01:16:36,718
You got a minute to live.
Fill it with words.

1180
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:40,764
It's just a role.
"The Mandarin," it's not real.

1181
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:43,224
Then how did you get here, Trevor?

1182
01:16:45,185 --> 01:16:51,357
Well, I had a little problem
with substances.

1183
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:55,695
And I ended up doing things,
no two ways about it,

1184
01:16:55,779 --> 01:16:58,072
in the street,
that a man shouldn't do.

1185
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,699
- Next?
- Then,

1186
01:16:59,783 --> 01:17:02,660
they approached me
about the role,

1187
01:17:02,744 --> 01:17:04,162
and they knew about the drugs.

1188
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:05,413
What did they say?
They'd get you off them?

1189
01:17:05,747 --> 01:17:07,207
They said they'd give me more.

1190
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,333
They gave me things.

1191
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:11,920
They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery.

1192
01:17:12,003 --> 01:17:14,255
They gave me things.

1193
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:16,549
Did you just nod off?

1194
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:17,717
Hey.

1195
01:17:17,801 --> 01:17:19,636
No, and a lovely speedboat.

1196
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:22,138
And the thing was, he needed someone

1197
01:17:22,222 --> 01:17:26,142
to take credit
for some accidental explosions.

1198
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:30,563
"He"?

1199
01:17:33,191 --> 01:17:35,151
- Killian?
- Killian.

1200
01:17:35,235 --> 01:17:38,071
- He created you?
- He created me.

1201
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:39,781
Custom-made terror threat.

1202
01:17:40,323 --> 01:17:42,075
Yes. Yes.

1203
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:44,035
His think tank thinked it up.

1204
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:46,746
The pathology of a serial killer.

1205
01:17:46,955 --> 01:17:49,833
The manipulation
of Western iconography.

1206
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:53,419
Ready for another lesson?

1207
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:54,963
Blah, blah, blah.

1208
01:17:55,255 --> 01:17:56,506
No.

1209
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,551
Of course, it was my performance
that brought the Mandarin to life.

1210
01:17:59,759 --> 01:18:01,177
Your performance?

1211
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,179
Where people died?

1212
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,973
No, they didn't.

1213
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:08,977
Look around you.
The costumes, green screen.

1214
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,187
Honestly,
I wasn't on location for half this stuff.

1215
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:13,064
And when I was,
it was movie magic, love.

1216
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:15,316
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend
who's in a coma

1217
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,568
and he might not wake up.

1218
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:17,986
So you're gonna have
to answer for that.

1219
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:19,571
You're still going down, pal.

1220
01:18:19,654 --> 01:18:20,655
You under...

1221
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:30,248
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?

1222
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:32,834
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?

1223
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:34,836
No.

1224
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:36,421
You should have pressed
the panic button.

1225
01:18:37,297 --> 01:18:39,632
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.

1226
01:18:52,312 --> 01:18:53,396
Okay.

1227
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:03,990
It's just like old times, huh?

1228
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:07,076
Yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.

1229
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,786
It wasn't my idea.

1230
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,872
Okay. So you took Killian's card.

1231
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:12,040
I took his money.

1232
01:19:12,332 --> 01:19:14,500
And here you are 13 years later,
in a dungeon.

1233
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:16,419
- No.
- Yeah.

1234
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,171
No, you're in a dungeon.
I'm free to go.

1235
01:19:18,796 --> 01:19:20,089
Yeah?

1236
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:25,470
A lot has happened, Tony.

1237
01:19:26,429 --> 01:19:27,889
But I'm close.

1238
01:19:28,556 --> 01:19:30,683
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.

1239
01:19:30,767 --> 01:19:32,936
I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.

1240
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:34,437
People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.

1241
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,855
Maya, you're kidding yourself.

1242
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:37,190
Then help me fix it.

1243
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:43,863
Did I do that?

1244
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:46,199
Yes.

1245
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:47,909
I remember the night, not the morning.

1246
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:50,203
Is this what
you've been chasing around?

1247
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:52,372
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.

1248
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:56,960
You used to have a moral psychology.

1249
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:59,212
You used to have ideals.

1250
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:01,965
You wanted to help people.

1251
01:20:02,048 --> 01:20:03,925
Now look at you.

1252
01:20:04,968 --> 01:20:06,928
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who

1253
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:11,766
still has their soul.

1254
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:18,439
Get me out of here.

1255
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:22,902
Come on.

1256
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:25,488
You know what my old man
used to say to me?

1257
01:20:26,781 --> 01:20:29,867
One of his favourite of many sayings...

1258
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:34,330
"The early bird gets the worm,
but the second mouse gets the cheese."

1259
01:20:34,539 --> 01:20:36,666
You're not still pissed off
about the Switzerland thing, are you?

1260
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:39,168
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?

1261
01:20:39,252 --> 01:20:41,254
I'm here to thank you.

1262
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:43,631
You gave me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.

1263
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:45,883
Desperation.

1264
01:20:46,426 --> 01:20:48,094
If you think back to Switzerland,

1265
01:20:48,219 --> 01:20:51,180
you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?

1266
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:54,142
For the first 20 minutes,

1267
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,561
I actually thought you'd show up.

1268
01:20:56,644 --> 01:20:58,438
And the next hour...

1269
01:21:00,023 --> 01:21:04,444
I considered taking
that one-step shortcut to the lobby.

1270
01:21:04,736 --> 01:21:05,737
If you know what I mean.

1271
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:09,115
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.

1272
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:11,868
But as I looked out over that city,

1273
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:14,787
<i>nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,</i>

1274
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:17,123
<i>no one was even looking.</i>

1275
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:21,210
<i>I had a thought that would guide me
for years to come.</i>

1276
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:23,004
Anonymity, Tony.

1277
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:26,299
Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.

1278
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:27,633
Right?

1279
01:21:27,717 --> 01:21:30,136
You simply rule
from behind the scenes.

1280
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:32,680
<i>Because the second
you give evil a face,</i>

1281
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:35,725
<i>a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,</i>

1282
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:37,393
you hand the people a target.

1283
01:21:37,685 --> 01:21:39,145
You're something else.

1284
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:42,482
You have met him, I assume?

1285
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:44,150
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.

1286
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,569
I know he's a little
over the top sometimes.

1287
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:48,362
It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...

1288
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:49,489
He's a stage actor.

1289
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:53,576
They say his Lear was
the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.

1290
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,703
Anyway, the point is,

1291
01:21:55,787 --> 01:21:59,123
ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky,

1292
01:21:59,207 --> 01:22:00,500
subtlety has kind of had its day.

1293
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:02,752
What's next for you in your world?

1294
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:07,965
I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift
that you so graciously imparted to me.

1295
01:22:14,764 --> 01:22:15,765
Desperation.

1296
01:22:16,724 --> 01:22:17,767
Now, this is live.

1297
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:21,062
I'm not sure if you can tell,
but at this moment

1298
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:25,608
the body is trying to decide whether to
accept EXTREMIS, or just give up.

1299
01:22:25,817 --> 01:22:27,527
And if it gives up,

1300
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:32,532
I have to say,
the detonation is quite spectacular.

1301
01:22:33,491 --> 01:22:36,911
But until that point,
it's really just a lot of pain.

1302
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:41,624
We haven't even talked salary yet.

1303
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:44,210
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?

1304
01:22:45,086 --> 01:22:46,087
Let him go.

1305
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:48,381
Hold on, hold on.

1306
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:50,383
Maya...

1307
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:52,426
I said, let him go.

1308
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:54,595
What are you doing?

1309
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:57,390
1200 CCs.
A dose half of this size, I'm dead.

1310
01:22:58,266 --> 01:23:02,478
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.

1311
01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:03,896
Maya, give me the injector.

1312
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,440
If I die, Killian,

1313
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:09,610
what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?

1314
01:23:09,694 --> 01:23:10,903
We're not doing this, okay?

1315
01:23:11,112 --> 01:23:14,323
What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?

1316
01:23:26,252 --> 01:23:27,295
The good news is,

1317
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:30,882
a high-level position
has just been vacated.

1318
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:41,559
You are a maniac.

1319
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:43,811
No, I'm a visionary.

1320
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:46,355
But I do own a maniac.

1321
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:49,400
And he takes the stage tonight.

1322
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:54,197
Once we get the Patriot installed,

1323
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,241
it will take me
nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.

1324
01:23:57,325 --> 01:23:59,952
That's great, but the last time I looked,
there was somebody inside of it.

1325
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:07,418
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1326
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:12,590
Hello, Colonel.

1327
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:14,926
Step aside.

1328
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:25,102
We'll get you out of there.

1329
01:24:25,186 --> 01:24:26,312
Don't worry.

1330
01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:28,773
You'll damage the arm our.

1331
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:30,399
Yes, I will.

1332
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:32,151
But you can fix it, right?

1333
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:35,738
I'm gonna take the Chinook
to base camp.

1334
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:37,323
And I want Potts with me.

1335
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:38,407
She's still in Phase Two.

1336
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:41,494
You're not going deaf, are you?

1337
01:24:58,177 --> 01:25:00,680
Careful, there. It's a limited edition.

1338
01:25:01,097 --> 01:25:02,139
Hey, Ponytail Express.

1339
01:25:03,474 --> 01:25:05,309
What's the mileage count
between Tennessee and Miami?

1340
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:06,519
832 miles.

1341
01:25:06,811 --> 01:25:08,104
Very nice.

1342
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:09,522
I'm good like that.

1343
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:11,607
Can you stop that?

1344
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:13,234
Break it, you bought it.

1345
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:16,612
I think I bought it.

1346
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:19,156
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.
That belongs to my friend's sister.

1347
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,659
And that's why
I'm gonna kill you first.

1348
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:23,828
- What are you gonna do to me?
- You'll see.

1349
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:25,538
You're zip-tied to a bed.

1350
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:27,873
This.

1351
01:25:30,918 --> 01:25:31,961
That.

1352
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:38,342
Are you coming out?

1353
01:25:41,095 --> 01:25:43,389
Do not open. Do not open.
Don't open. Don't open.

1354
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:44,473
All right. Let's go.

1355
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:54,859
You... You breathe fire? Okay.

1356
01:25:59,405 --> 01:26:02,116
It's a glorious day, Savin.

1357
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:04,160
This time tomorrow,

1358
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:07,830
I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand,

1359
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:11,667
and the world's most feared terrorist
in the other.

1360
01:26:11,959 --> 01:26:14,920
I'll own the war on terror.

1361
01:26:15,546 --> 01:26:16,964
Create supply and demand.

1362
01:26:17,548 --> 01:26:21,385
For you, for your brothers and sisters.

1363
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:25,681
Trust me,
you're gonna be in a puddle of blood

1364
01:26:25,765 --> 01:26:28,184
on the ground in five, four, three...

1365
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:29,560
Come on! Two...

1366
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:32,605
How did we get this shift?

1367
01:26:32,772 --> 01:26:34,148
All right,
I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.

1368
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:36,025
Put down your weapons.

1369
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:38,486
Tie yourselves to those chairs.
I'll let you live.

1370
01:26:38,569 --> 01:26:40,946
In five, four, bang!

1371
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:42,114
Wow.

1372
01:26:42,323 --> 01:26:44,033
You should be gone by now.
You should've already been gone.

1373
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:45,659
I am just beyond terrified.

1374
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:47,244
Here it comes.

1375
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:49,663
- Three, four...
- Shut up.

1376
01:26:49,997 --> 01:26:51,499
Five, four, three, two, one!

1377
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,001
Told you.

1378
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:06,722
Where's the rest?

1379
01:28:05,865 --> 01:28:08,576
Honestly,
I hate working here. They are so weird.

1380
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,333
Better late than never.

1381
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:24,258
Not this time. Not the face.

1382
01:28:25,718 --> 01:28:27,636
It's good to be back.
Hello, by the way.

1383
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,054
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

1384
01:28:34,268 --> 01:28:36,645
<i>All personnel, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.</i>

1385
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:39,607
<i>Repeat, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.</i>

1386
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:40,900
Let's go!

1387
01:28:41,317 --> 01:28:42,568
Crap.

1388
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:56,373
Tony?

1389
01:28:56,582 --> 01:28:57,750
Rhodey, tell me
that was you in the suit.

1390
01:28:57,917 --> 01:28:59,919
No. You got yours?

1391
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,129
Kind of.
Main house, as fast as you can.

1392
01:29:02,505 --> 01:29:04,006
<i>There's somebody I'd like you to meet.</i>

1393
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:11,555
You, you, you! Move! Get out!

1394
01:29:11,764 --> 01:29:14,141
The room is secure.
I have eyes on the Mandarin.

1395
01:29:14,225 --> 01:29:15,434
What's this? I had winners.

1396
01:29:23,651 --> 01:29:24,777
What have you come as?

1397
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:27,279
You make a move,
and I break your face.

1398
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:32,243
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.

1399
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:33,702
This is the Mandarin?

1400
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:35,788
Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.

1401
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,665
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1402
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:40,876
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

1403
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,713
But, hey, if you're here to arrest me,
there's some people I'd like to roll on.

1404
01:29:44,797 --> 01:29:46,257
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.

1405
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:48,467
You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.

1406
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:50,094
Doing what?

1407
01:29:50,177 --> 01:29:52,346
I get it! That hurt. I get it! I get it!

1408
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:56,141
I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.

1409
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:58,394
- Spill.
- Do you know what they did to my suit?

1410
01:29:58,477 --> 01:29:59,520
What? No.

1411
01:29:59,979 --> 01:30:02,064
But I do know it's happening
off the coast.

1412
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:05,568
Something to do with a big boat.

1413
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:06,986
I can take you there.

1414
01:30:07,653 --> 01:30:09,530
<i>Olé, olé, olé, olé...</i>

1415
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:12,616
Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.

1416
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:16,662
And this next bit may include
the vice president as well.

1417
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:18,414
Is that...
Is that important?

1418
01:30:18,664 --> 01:30:20,291
- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.

1419
01:30:23,127 --> 01:30:24,128
So?

1420
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:26,046
What are we gonna do?

1421
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,214
We don't have any transport.

1422
01:30:27,298 --> 01:30:28,299
Right.

1423
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:31,302
Hey, Ringo.

1424
01:30:31,385 --> 01:30:34,013
Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1425
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:38,726
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1426
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:39,935
But we also have to figure out

1427
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:41,770
- this vice president thing, right?
- Right.

1428
01:30:41,854 --> 01:30:43,063
I wonder who I'm calling right now.

1429
01:30:43,147 --> 01:30:44,148
That's the vice president.

1430
01:30:44,398 --> 01:30:45,691
Thanks.

1431
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:47,443
Hello?

1432
01:30:47,526 --> 01:30:49,194
<i>Sir, this is Tony Stark.</i>

1433
01:30:49,528 --> 01:30:51,155
Welcome back to the land of the living.

1434
01:30:51,322 --> 01:30:53,490
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.

1435
01:30:53,574 --> 01:30:55,159
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1436
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:57,911
Mr Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,

1437
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:00,247
surrounded by the Agency's finest.

1438
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:03,626
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1439
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:04,752
I think we're good, here.

1440
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:06,837
<i>Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.</i>

1441
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:08,922
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

1442
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:10,549
<i>They're gonna take out
the president somehow.</i>

1443
01:31:10,841 --> 01:31:12,259
We have to immediately
alert that plane.

1444
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:14,595
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

1445
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:17,598
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

1446
01:31:17,765 --> 01:31:19,183
- <i>Thank you, Colonel.</i>
- Rhodes and Stark out.

1447
01:31:21,101 --> 01:31:22,811
Everything okay, sir?

1448
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:24,897
Couldn't be better.

1449
01:31:31,779 --> 01:31:33,238
I love you, babe.

1450
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:55,344
Colonel Rhodes.

1451
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:58,764
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.

1452
01:32:03,602 --> 01:32:04,728
We gotta make a decision.

1453
01:32:04,812 --> 01:32:07,606
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.

1454
01:32:07,773 --> 01:32:09,400
<i>Sir, I have an update from Malibu.</i>

1455
01:32:09,483 --> 01:32:11,610
<i>The cranes have finally arrived,</i>

1456
01:32:11,777 --> 01:32:13,737
<i>and the cellar doors
are being cleared as we speak.</i>

1457
01:32:13,821 --> 01:32:15,531
And what about the suit I'm wearing?

1458
01:32:15,698 --> 01:32:17,950
<i>The arm our is now at 92%.</i>

1459
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:20,119
That's going to have to do.

1460
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:30,254
Here he comes. Here he comes.
Get a quick picture.

1461
01:32:30,337 --> 01:32:31,380
Sure.

1462
01:32:48,689 --> 01:32:49,690
Everything all right, Colonel?

1463
01:33:22,681 --> 01:33:24,725
It is an honour, Mr President.

1464
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,102
If you're gonna do it, do it!

1465
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:29,438
Cool your boots, sir.

1466
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:31,023
That's not how the Mandarin works.

1467
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:33,609
Sir, Air Force One
has been compromised.

1468
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:35,611
Internal shots, temperature spikes.

1469
01:33:35,694 --> 01:33:36,862
Get me eyes on it now.

1470
01:33:37,237 --> 01:33:39,156
Image coming through now, sir.

1471
01:33:41,575 --> 01:33:43,368
Was that Rhodes?

1472
01:33:52,503 --> 01:33:53,879
Is anyone there?

1473
01:33:54,213 --> 01:33:55,881
Let us out!

1474
01:34:12,356 --> 01:34:13,857
The President.

1475
01:34:14,358 --> 01:34:15,567
Now.

1476
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:16,652
He's not here.

1477
01:34:20,781 --> 01:34:22,533
Try the jet stream?

1478
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:25,577
Speaking of which, go fish.

1479
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:50,269
Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.

1480
01:35:03,282 --> 01:35:04,283
How many in the air?

1481
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:05,993
<i>Thirteen, sir.</i>

1482
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:09,913
- How many can I carry?
- <i>Four, sir.</i>

1483
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:22,926
Slow down. Slow down, relax.
What's your name? Heather?

1484
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:30,601
Oh, God! No! No!

1485
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:33,437
Listen to me. See that guy?

1486
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:35,314
I'm gonna swing by,
you're just gonna grab him.

1487
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:37,024
- You got it?
- What?

1488
01:35:39,568 --> 01:35:42,863
I'll electrify your arm,
you won't be able to open your hand.

1489
01:35:44,114 --> 01:35:45,324
We can do this, Heather.

1490
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:56,460
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.

1491
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,924
Remember that game
called Barrel of Monkeys?

1492
01:36:02,007 --> 01:36:03,091
That's what we're going to do.

1493
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:04,426
<i>18,000 feet.</i>

1494
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:05,886
Come on, people.
Everybody, grab your monkey.

1495
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:12,225
Nice.

1496
01:36:12,601 --> 01:36:14,227
<i>10,000 feet.</i>

1497
01:36:17,606 --> 01:36:18,857
<i>6,000 feet.</i>

1498
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:20,567
Come on, people.

1499
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:22,736
Come on, come on, come on!

1500
01:36:26,031 --> 01:36:27,157
Yeah!

1501
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:29,076
<i>1,000 feet.</i>

1502
01:36:30,243 --> 01:36:31,828
<i>400 feet.</i>

1503
01:36:32,412 --> 01:36:33,622
<i>200 feet, sir.</i>

1504
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:34,831
He's a chunky monkey, let's get him.

1505
01:36:35,874 --> 01:36:37,042
Hello.

1506
01:36:58,397 --> 01:36:59,481
We made it!

1507
01:37:00,232 --> 01:37:01,692
Nice work, guys!

1508
01:37:01,775 --> 01:37:04,403
Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.

1509
01:37:04,695 --> 01:37:05,779
All right, Jarvis.

1510
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:07,406
But it's only half-done.
We've still got to get Pepper...

1511
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:16,873
That came out of nowhere.

1512
01:37:16,957 --> 01:37:18,166
Wow.

1513
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:19,710
Give me some good news, man.

1514
01:37:19,793 --> 01:37:20,794
I think they all made it.

1515
01:37:20,877 --> 01:37:21,837
Thank God.

1516
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,921
Yeah, but I missed the president.

1517
01:37:23,422 --> 01:37:25,298
You couldn't save the president
with the suit,

1518
01:37:25,382 --> 01:37:27,509
how are we gonna save Pepper
with nothing?

1519
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:29,636
Say, Jarvis, is it that time?

1520
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,638
<i>The House Party Protocol, sir?</i>

1521
01:37:31,722 --> 01:37:32,764
Correct.

1522
01:38:03,128 --> 01:38:04,463
Hi.

1523
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:14,306
You think he's gonna help you?

1524
01:38:14,973 --> 01:38:16,391
He won't.

1525
01:38:20,854 --> 01:38:24,775
Having you here is not
just to motivate Tony Stark. It's...

1526
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:27,944
Well, it's actually
more embarrassing than that.

1527
01:38:28,028 --> 01:38:30,238
You're here as my...

1528
01:38:31,156 --> 01:38:32,991
Trophy.

1529
01:38:45,295 --> 01:38:46,546
Good evening, sir.

1530
01:38:51,176 --> 01:38:53,929
Welcome aboard, Mr President.

1531
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:04,022
Ever hear of an elephant graveyard?

1532
01:39:04,189 --> 01:39:08,902
Well, two years ago,
the elephant in the room was this scow.

1533
01:39:11,238 --> 01:39:12,364
This is the <i>Roxxon Norco.</i>

1534
01:39:12,614 --> 01:39:13,615
And, of course, you'll remember

1535
01:39:13,698 --> 01:39:16,368
that when she spilled a million gallons
of crude off Pensacola,

1536
01:39:16,618 --> 01:39:19,371
thanks to you,
not one fat cat saw a day in court.

1537
01:39:19,788 --> 01:39:21,540
What do you want from me?

1538
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:23,750
Nothing, sir.

1539
01:39:24,126 --> 01:39:27,587
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.

1540
01:39:27,671 --> 01:39:29,714
You see, I've moved on.

1541
01:39:29,798 --> 01:39:32,175
I found myself a new political patron,

1542
01:39:32,592 --> 01:39:35,387
and this time tomorrow,
he'll have your job.

1543
01:39:36,388 --> 01:39:38,223
String him up.

1544
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:40,892
Hey!

1545
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:58,618
Come on.

1546
01:40:02,122 --> 01:40:04,040
You're not gonna freak out on me,
right?

1547
01:40:04,124 --> 01:40:05,834
I hope not.

1548
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:32,319
Oh, my God.

1549
01:40:33,945 --> 01:40:36,072
He's strung up over the oil tanker.
They're gonna light him up, man.

1550
01:40:36,156 --> 01:40:38,742
Viking funeral.
Public execution.

1551
01:40:38,825 --> 01:40:40,619
Yeah, death by oil.

1552
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:49,836
<i>Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.</i>

1553
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:52,422
Okay. That's good.

1554
01:40:52,505 --> 01:40:56,343
Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.

1555
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:58,762
Is your gun up?

1556
01:40:58,845 --> 01:41:00,430
Yep. What do I do?

1557
01:41:00,513 --> 01:41:02,974
Stay on my six, cover high
and don't shoot me in the back.

1558
01:41:03,141 --> 01:41:05,310
Six, high, back. All right.

1559
01:41:14,236 --> 01:41:15,528
You see that? Nailed it.

1560
01:41:16,154 --> 01:41:17,364
Yeah, you really killed the glass.

1561
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:18,657
You think I was aiming for the bulb?

1562
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:19,741
You can't hit a bulb at this distance.

1563
01:41:21,451 --> 01:41:22,911
<i>All personnel, we have hostiles</i>

1564
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:24,037
- <i>on east unit 12.</i>
- Over there!

1565
01:41:24,246 --> 01:41:25,830
- I <i>repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.</i>
- I'm out. Give me...

1566
01:41:25,914 --> 01:41:28,208
- You got extra magazines?
- They're not universal, Tony.

1567
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:30,418
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Give me another one.

1568
01:41:30,502 --> 01:41:31,795
- One of yours.
- I don't have one that fits that gun.

1569
01:41:31,878 --> 01:41:32,963
You've got, like, five of them.

1570
01:41:33,046 --> 01:41:34,256
Here's what I'm going to do.

1571
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:36,299
Save my spot, ready?

1572
01:41:36,383 --> 01:41:39,177
- What'd you see?
- Too fast. Nothing.

1573
01:41:39,261 --> 01:41:40,553
Here we go.

1574
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:46,351
Three guys, one girl, all armed.

1575
01:41:56,444 --> 01:41:57,988
God, I would kill
for some arm our right now.

1576
01:41:58,071 --> 01:42:00,031
- You're right. We need backup.
- Yeah, a bunch.

1577
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:02,826
You know what?

1578
01:42:06,788 --> 01:42:07,872
Is that...

1579
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:09,833
Yep.

1580
01:42:09,916 --> 01:42:11,543
- Are those...
- Yeah.

1581
01:42:28,226 --> 01:42:29,477
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1582
01:42:34,816 --> 01:42:37,485
Jarvis, target
EXTREMIS heat signatures.

1583
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:39,404
Disable with extreme prejudice.

1584
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:40,905
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1585
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:47,787
What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.

1586
01:42:49,289 --> 01:42:50,332
Take them to church.

1587
01:42:57,422 --> 01:42:59,090
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

1588
01:43:06,348 --> 01:43:07,349
Incoming!

1589
01:43:11,978 --> 01:43:13,605
Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.

1590
01:43:26,618 --> 01:43:28,620
This is how you've been managing
your down time, huh?

1591
01:43:28,703 --> 01:43:29,788
Everybody needs a hobby.

1592
01:43:36,294 --> 01:43:37,670
Heart breaker, help Red Snapper out,
will you?

1593
01:44:06,241 --> 01:44:07,826
Nice timing.

1594
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:10,120
Yeah. That's awesome.
Give me a suit, okay?

1595
01:44:11,496 --> 01:44:13,248
I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.

1596
01:44:13,665 --> 01:44:15,583
- What does that mean?
- I got you covered.

1597
01:44:18,878 --> 01:44:21,256
<i>Good evening, Colonel.
Can I give you a lift?</i>

1598
01:44:21,339 --> 01:44:22,799
Very funny.

1599
01:44:39,858 --> 01:44:41,151
<i>Sir, I've located Ms Potts.</i>

1600
01:44:41,234 --> 01:44:42,235
About time.

1601
01:44:55,248 --> 01:44:59,711
Stop!
Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.

1602
01:45:00,753 --> 01:45:04,382
See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?

1603
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:06,801
You're such a jerk.

1604
01:45:06,968 --> 01:45:08,219
Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.

1605
01:45:10,805 --> 01:45:12,056
Come on. A little more, baby.

1606
01:45:28,573 --> 01:45:29,616
Is this guy bothering you?

1607
01:45:31,409 --> 01:45:32,785
Don't get up.

1608
01:45:37,415 --> 01:45:38,541
Is it hot in there?

1609
01:45:40,835 --> 01:45:42,045
Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck?

1610
01:45:43,296 --> 01:45:46,591
Like a little turtle,
cooking in his little turtle suit.

1611
01:45:46,925 --> 01:45:47,926
Tony.

1612
01:45:48,885 --> 01:45:50,011
She's watching.

1613
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:52,931
I think you should close your eyes.

1614
01:45:53,431 --> 01:45:54,933
Close your eyes.

1615
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,769
Close your eyes.
You don't want to see this.

1616
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:06,903
Yeah, you take a minute.

1617
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:41,563
Jarvis, give me a suit right now!

1618
01:46:52,574 --> 01:46:53,575
Come on!

1619
01:46:55,493 --> 01:46:58,705
Mr President!
Just hold on, all right? I'm coming.

1620
01:46:59,622 --> 01:47:02,000
Just hold on. Hold on.

1621
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:16,222
Okay.

1622
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:25,023
Bye-bye.

1623
01:47:36,743 --> 01:47:37,910
Brace yourself.

1624
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,757
You look damn good, Mr President,

1625
01:47:50,923 --> 01:47:52,383
but I'm gonna need that suit back.

1626
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:07,106
<i>The President is secure, Tony.</i>

1627
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:08,524
- <i>I'm clearing the area.</i>
- Nice work.

1628
01:48:09,651 --> 01:48:11,861
- Ready, sir?
- What do you mean "ready"?

1629
01:48:20,078 --> 01:48:22,830
Pep, I got you.
Relax, I got you.

1630
01:48:22,914 --> 01:48:23,915
Just look at me!

1631
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:28,419
Honey, I can't reach any further
and you can't stay there.

1632
01:48:28,753 --> 01:48:30,213
All right?
You've got to let go.

1633
01:48:30,672 --> 01:48:33,758
You've got to let go!
I'll catch you, I promise.

1634
01:48:36,177 --> 01:48:37,178
No!

1635
01:49:03,955 --> 01:49:07,083
A shame. I would've caught her.

1636
01:49:38,156 --> 01:49:39,240
Eject.

1637
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:26,245
Well, here we are on the roof.

1638
01:50:36,964 --> 01:50:38,049
<i>Mark 42, inbound.</i>

1639
01:50:38,216 --> 01:50:41,552
I'll be damned.
The prodigal son returns.

1640
01:50:57,527 --> 01:50:58,528
Whatever.

1641
01:50:59,737 --> 01:51:01,239
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.

1642
01:51:02,865 --> 01:51:06,619
It's a pity.
I was so close to having her perfect.

1643
01:51:09,413 --> 01:51:11,749
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait!
Slow down! Slow down!

1644
01:51:11,916 --> 01:51:14,210
You're right. I don't deserve her.

1645
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:17,505
Here's where you're wrong.

1646
01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:18,798
She was already perfect.

1647
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:28,182
Jarvis,

1648
01:51:29,267 --> 01:51:30,768
do me a favour and blow Mark 42.

1649
01:51:31,185 --> 01:51:32,270
No...

1650
01:52:46,218 --> 01:52:48,304
No more false faces.

1651
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:50,973
You said you wanted the Mandarin.

1652
01:52:52,141 --> 01:52:54,852
You're looking right at him.

1653
01:52:55,186 --> 01:52:58,189
It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.

1654
01:52:58,689 --> 01:53:00,358
I am the Mandarin!

1655
01:53:11,786 --> 01:53:13,037
I got nothing.

1656
01:53:19,877 --> 01:53:22,630
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!

1657
01:53:30,888 --> 01:53:32,807
What?
What, are you mad at me?

1658
01:53:58,916 --> 01:54:00,126
Honey?

1659
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:06,048
Oh, my God.

1660
01:54:07,591 --> 01:54:09,802
That was really violent.

1661
01:54:10,803 --> 01:54:12,805
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...

1662
01:54:12,972 --> 01:54:15,016
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?

1663
01:54:18,477 --> 01:54:20,146
Who's the hot mess now?

1664
01:54:20,312 --> 01:54:22,398
It's still debatable.

1665
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:26,360
Probably tipping your way a little bit.
Why don't you dress like this at home?

1666
01:54:26,444 --> 01:54:28,362
Sport bra. The whole deal.

1667
01:54:28,446 --> 01:54:31,657
You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.

1668
01:54:31,824 --> 01:54:34,368
What am I going to complain
about now?

1669
01:54:35,202 --> 01:54:36,829
Well, it's me.

1670
01:54:37,621 --> 01:54:38,664
You'll think of something.

1671
01:54:40,249 --> 01:54:41,625
- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.

1672
01:54:41,709 --> 01:54:43,627
- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.

1673
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:45,671
Not hot.

1674
01:54:47,089 --> 01:54:48,758
Am I gonna be okay?

1675
01:54:48,841 --> 01:54:49,842
No.

1676
01:54:49,967 --> 01:54:52,636
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.

1677
01:54:52,928 --> 01:54:54,764
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.

1678
01:54:55,014 --> 01:54:56,724
I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.

1679
01:54:56,807 --> 01:54:59,935
I think I can get you better.

1680
01:55:00,561 --> 01:55:03,064
That's what I do. I fix stuff.

1681
01:55:03,147 --> 01:55:05,441
And all your distractions?

1682
01:55:06,358 --> 01:55:08,069
I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.

1683
01:55:08,319 --> 01:55:10,696
Jarvis. Hey.

1684
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:14,075
<i>All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?</i>

1685
01:55:14,325 --> 01:55:16,285
You know what to do.

1686
01:55:16,368 --> 01:55:19,121
<i>The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?</i>

1687
01:55:19,205 --> 01:55:22,374
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.

1688
01:55:58,661 --> 01:55:59,954
Okay, so far?
Do you like it?

1689
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:03,541
It will do.

1690
01:56:12,675 --> 01:56:18,139
<i>And so, as Christmas morning began,
my journey had reached its end.</i>

1691
01:56:21,517 --> 01:56:23,519
<i>You start with something pure,</i>

1692
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:28,774
<i>something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.</i>

1693
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:31,569
<i>The compromises.</i>

1694
01:56:38,117 --> 01:56:40,828
<i>We create our own demons.</i>

1695
01:56:46,083 --> 01:56:48,252
Great to see you! Bloody hell!

1696
01:56:49,795 --> 01:56:53,507
<i>As promised, I got Pepper sorted out.
It took some tinkering.</i>

1697
01:56:53,591 --> 01:56:57,386
<i>But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"</i>

1698
01:57:01,223 --> 01:57:04,560
<i>Of course, there are people who say
progress is dangerous,</i>

1699
01:57:04,643 --> 01:57:08,147
<i>but I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.</i>

1700
01:57:08,564 --> 01:57:11,609
<i>And now, neither will I.</i>

1701
01:57:12,401 --> 01:57:14,320
<i>Let me tell you,</i>

1702
01:57:14,403 --> 01:57:16,530
<i>that was the best sleep
I'd had in years.</i>

1703
01:57:37,426 --> 01:57:39,386
It's okay. It's okay.

1704
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:40,512
It's okay.

1705
01:57:40,596 --> 01:57:41,597
No, look.

1706
01:58:58,882 --> 01:59:02,928
<i>So, if I were to wrap this up,
tie it with a bow, or whatever...</i>

1707
01:59:03,012 --> 01:59:07,308
<i>I guess I'd say my arm our,
it was never a distraction,</i>

1708
01:59:07,391 --> 01:59:09,476
<i>or a hobby.</i>

1709
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:11,562
<i>It was a cocoon.</i>

1710
01:59:12,771 --> 01:59:14,565
<i>And now,</i>

1711
01:59:15,524 --> 01:59:17,818
<i>I'm a changed man.</i>

1712
01:59:26,744 --> 01:59:30,414
<i>You can take away my house,
and all my tricks and toys.</i>

1713
01:59:31,415 --> 01:59:34,251
<i>One thing you can't take away...</i>

1714
01:59:36,795 --> 01:59:38,589
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

1715
02:09:04,404 --> 02:09:06,740
<i>You know, and thank you by the way.
For listening.</i>

1716
02:09:06,823 --> 02:09:09,284
<i>Plus, something about getting it off
my chest,</i>

1717
02:09:09,367 --> 02:09:12,913
<i>and putting it out there in the
atmosphere instead of holding this in...</i>

1718
02:09:12,996 --> 02:09:15,707
<i>I mean, this is what gets people sick,
you know.</i>

1719
02:09:15,790 --> 02:09:18,835
<i>Wow, I had no idea
you were such a good listener.</i>

1720
02:09:18,919 --> 02:09:21,421
To be able to share
all my intimate thoughts

1721
02:09:21,504 --> 02:09:22,631
and my experiences with someone,

1722
02:09:22,714 --> 02:09:25,258
it just cuts the weight of it in half.

1723
02:09:25,342 --> 02:09:26,718
You know, it's like a snake
swallowing its own tail.

1724
02:09:26,801 --> 02:09:28,553
Everything comes full circle.

1725
02:09:28,637 --> 02:09:32,057
And the fact that you've been able to
help me process...

1726
02:09:34,601 --> 02:09:36,061
- Are you with me?
- Sorry... I was, yeah.

1727
02:09:36,144 --> 02:09:37,228
We were at...

1728
02:09:37,437 --> 02:09:38,647
Are you actively napping?

1729
02:09:38,772 --> 02:09:41,024
I was... I... I drifted.

1730
02:09:41,524 --> 02:09:42,692
Where did I lose you?

1731
02:09:44,694 --> 02:09:46,363
Elevator in Switzerland.

1732
02:09:47,989 --> 02:09:49,407
So, you heard none of it.

1733
02:09:49,741 --> 02:09:52,702
I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.

1734
02:09:53,328 --> 02:09:54,621
I'm not a therapist.

1735
02:09:54,788 --> 02:09:56,665
- It's not my training.
- So?

1736
02:09:56,790 --> 02:09:58,416
- I don't have the...
- What? The time?

1737
02:09:58,500 --> 02:09:59,751
Temperament.

1738
02:10:00,001 --> 02:10:01,544
You know what?
Now that I think about it...

1739
02:10:01,628 --> 02:10:03,004
God, my original wound.

1740
02:10:03,254 --> 02:10:05,423
- 1983, all right?
- Yes.

1741
02:10:05,507 --> 02:10:08,218
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny.
That was weird.
