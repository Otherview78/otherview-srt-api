1
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,368
This is J.T.L. Morning News.

2
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,450
This is Holly Chadwick.

3
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,649
Thanks for joining us.

4
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:51,406
We have a great show in store for you this morning.

5
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:54,130
Well, it's a great morning to be in the studio.

6
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,404
Authorities have confirmed an avian flu outbreak.

7
00:01:56,477 --> 00:01:57,841
Forecast, cloudy skies...

8
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,917
Good morning. Reporting from Brighton.

9
00:02:01,314 --> 00:02:03,042
This will be a different scenario

10
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:06,478
if the virus changes in a way that allows transmission between humans.

11
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,630
So, let's get started.

12
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:10,913
Yet again today,

13
00:02:10,987 --> 00:02:14,034
another group of dolphins became stranded.

14
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:17,033
CO2 emissions have dramatically increased in...

15
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:19,111
Are there any real threats that you know of?

16
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,423
Not at all.

17
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,153
Environmentalists are trying

18
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,658
to determine the cause of death.

19
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,471
At alert level six,

20
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:27,652
W.H.O. guidelines for governments...

21
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,039
Your socks are so cute! I like them.

22
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:31,554
Police say they've seen similar cases recently

23
00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:33,667
of people behaving strangely.

24
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,140
The U.N. health agency is not likely

25
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:38,623
to recommend official travel restrictions.

26
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,319
It's a little bit unsettling.

27
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,713
They're not physicists. They're not engineers.

28
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,992
They think it's just gonna go away.

29
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:45,456
They live in a fantasy parallel universe.

30
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:48,894
Right on top of the man, beating him.

31
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,055
The man is bleeding.

32
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,376
Twenty-one confirmed cases.

33
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,551
All the talk about a doomsday is a big hoax.

34
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:55,946
The subject growled at him

35
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,928
and continued to maul the victim.

36
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:01,106
The best estimate is about 15,000 in the U.K.

37
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:02,378
We don't know if this is spreading.

38
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,737
Rhythms of change...

39
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:05,676
So far there's no manifestation.

40
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:11,340
Monitors have arrived, even carrying them...

41
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,568
With that much public at risk, we cannot...

42
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:15,455
They're trying to move us on, trying to tell the journalists to get out.

43
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:31,671
Wake up!

44
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:35,088
Oh, creatures in our bed...

45
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:37,669
No sleeping!

46
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,370
Oh, you're getting very big.

47
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:43,174
- What do you want to eat? - Pancakes!

48
00:03:44,144 --> 00:03:45,465
We got a lot more sunshine today.

49
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,778
You have to only say one word.

50
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:50,289
Hey, by the way, what do you want for your birthday?

51
00:03:50,474 --> 00:03:51,455
Say a PUPPY-

52
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:52,541
A PUPPY-

53
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,261
You mean a stuffed animal puppy?

54
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,761
Because that we can do.

55
00:03:58,565 --> 00:04:00,590
Good morning. That looks yummy.

56
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:02,989
She gets the bigger one?

57
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:04,568
- Yeah, sorry. - She's tiny.

58
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:06,397
Did you pack your inhaler?

59
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:08,572
Bathroom sink.

60
00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:10,815
- In a minute? - Scootch! Go.

61
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:13,331
The government has declared martial law.

62
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:15,051
Daddy, what's martial law?

63
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:20,293
Martial law is like house rules, but for everybody.

64
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,375
Were you ever in places like that with your old job?

65
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:28,196
But I quit my old job so I could be with you.

66
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:29,437
Do you miss it?

67
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:34,531
No, I like my new job.

68
00:04:34,637 --> 00:04:37,152
All you do is make pancakes in the morning!

69
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,389
Yeah, but I'm really good at it.

70
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,148
Look who I found!

71
00:04:40,706 --> 00:04:41,952
Here comes the number 12 train!

72
00:04:42,017 --> 00:04:43,295
It's not Subway Sam, is it?

73
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:45,913
You want more pancakes?

74
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:47,752
Good.

75
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:50,039
Go, go, go. Come on, scootch!

76
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:51,760
- At least. .. - Move it on out.

77
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:53,600
Hey! Plates in the sink!

78
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,753
- Later! - Do that when we get back!

79
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:03,525
Does it live in the jungle?

80
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:07,339
No.

81
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:08,618
Do you eat it on Sundays?

82
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:09,705
No.

83
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:12,474
Does it live on the Great Plains of Africa?

84
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,912
- Yeah. - Oh, well, I guess, yeah.

85
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,091
Do people keep it in pens all its life and harvest it for meat?

86
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:19,666
- That's really gross! - Gross!

87
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:20,718
Dad!

88
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:22,810
Is it an animal you'd have for a pet?

89
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:24,349
- Yes. - Is it a cat?

90
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,618
Yes.

91
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,425
- Okay, now we have another one. - Do another one.

92
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:29,479
You totally got one!

93
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:30,676
Why are there so many?

94
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,295
It's like, three in the last five minutes.

95
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:34,870
What is going on?

96
00:05:39,477 --> 00:05:40,906
The World Health Organization has been

97
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:42,670
tracking the recent outbreak of rabies

98
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:46,263
that began in Taiwan and has now been reported in over 12 countries.

99
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:49,188
Responding to allegations he hasn't done enough to prevent the spread...

100
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:50,575
Can we try BBC?

101
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:53,115
You're not British anymore, baby.

102
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,657
You lost your accent a long time ago.

103
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:56,940
Except after two bottles of wine.

104
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:58,175
Am I British?

105
00:05:58,244 --> 00:05:59,373
Yeah, your grandma is.

106
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:02,141
Hey!

107
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:05,408
He's just gonna keep going, Daddy?

108
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:06,411
Hold on, guys.

109
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:07,503
Daddy, be careful on the road.

110
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:09,154
It's okay, baby.

111
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:14,772
Can be transmitted between species

112
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:17,011
commonly from a bite from an infected animal.

113
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,811
Our best recommendation is to stay away from densely populated areas.

114
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:26,534
Hey, yo! You all right?

115
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,729
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.

116
00:06:27,798 --> 00:06:29,897
- You need anything? - No. You know what's going on?

117
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:31,366
No, man, I don't know anything.

118
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:32,748
It's crazy.

119
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,726
Gerry?

120
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:45,405
Get back in your car right now!

121
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:48,223
Remain with your ve...

122
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:55,706
What are we doing?

123
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,867
That's our way out of here.

124
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:18,708
I want my blanket!

125
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:19,791
Baby, it's packed right now.

126
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:21,144
Snuggle with Subway Sam, okay?

127
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:26,875
My blanket!

128
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:34,812
Rach?

129
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:36,836
Rachel, baby, you've got to get back in your seat.

130
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:39,197
- Baby, we need you in your seat. - Put your belt on!

131
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:40,430
Rachel, right now!

132
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,199
- Gerry? - Rach, get your belt back on!

133
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,637
- You Okay? - You Okay?

134
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:56,433
- Rachel, sweetheart? - Rachel, you hurt?

135
00:07:57,248 --> 00:07:59,241
- Connie? - Are you okay? It's okay.

136
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:04,441
We should get out.

137
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:05,762
Everybody out of the car.

138
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,391
We've got to get out of the city.

139
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:18,495
Her door won't open! Rachel, go out that side.

140
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,711
Okay, you have to climb over, honey.

141
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,133
Out of the way!

142
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:29,013
Move it!

143
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,936
Come on, honey. Come on.

144
00:08:37,104 --> 00:08:38,830
Sweetheart, are you okay?

145
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:10,181
Let's go. Let's get off the street.

146
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:20,935
What is that, Gerry? What is that?

147
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:22,134
I don't know!

148
00:09:22,653 --> 00:09:23,931
Get to the RV.

149
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:24,982
Subway Sam!

150
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,714
Here comes the number 12 train! One.

151
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,451
Two.

152
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:32,918
- What's happening? - Three.

153
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:34,684
Four.

154
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:37,187
Five.

155
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:39,401
Six.

156
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:40,751
Seven.

157
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:42,694
Eight.

158
00:09:43,742 --> 00:09:44,946
Nine.

159
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:46,936
Ten.

160
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,995
Eleven.

161
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:50,902
Twelve.

162
00:09:53,032 --> 00:09:54,609
Train's in the station!

163
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:17,005
Gerry!

164
00:10:18,353 --> 00:10:19,898
Watch out!

165
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:59,455
We're pulling back on Fifth Street!

166
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,065
Containment is a fail.

167
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:14,886
Try to relax.

168
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:16,643
Give yourself air.

169
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,371
In and out.

170
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,326
Come on, baby, try to relax.

171
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:24,210
Gerry? We left my purse in the car.

172
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,409
Where's her spare?

173
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:28,821
I'm gonna go check your backpack, all right?

174
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:31,067
Do you want to be with her?

175
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:40,836
Rach, you'll be all right. You're gonna be all right.

176
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:43,122
Hey, hey, you breathe through your nose.

177
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:45,712
Rach, Rach, look at me. Look at me.

178
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:47,888
You're gonna be all right.

179
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:50,540
You've done this a hundred times. Look at me. Look at me.

180
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,464
Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth.

181
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:56,420
Okay, we're gonna go to a pharmacy.

182
00:11:56,494 --> 00:11:58,039
We gotta move.

183
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:00,957
Okay.

184
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:03,203
Good. Good. Look.

185
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:05,970
Look at me, look at me. Rach, breathe through your nose.

186
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:07,324
No, no, no, no...

187
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,864
You're gonna be all right.

188
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,134
- Look at me. - Daddy, what are those things?

189
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:12,602
Honey, find us some water. Okay? Something to drink.

190
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:18,788
It's Thierry.

191
00:12:18,968 --> 00:12:19,949
Where are you?

192
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,721
Airborne. Lower East Side to Turtle Bay.

193
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:26,275
It's all gone. We barely made it out.

194
00:12:26,348 --> 00:12:28,489
- Tell him to go south. - No, no, we need visual confirmation.

195
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,029
No,no,no,no,no,no,no.

196
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:32,155
What is this?

197
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:33,661
We don't know. How close were you?

198
00:12:34,102 --> 00:12:35,082
Face to face.

199
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,466
Good, honey, good.

200
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,347
Daddy.

201
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,564
Connie, give me that.

202
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:43,026
Give me that. Oh, thank you, honey.

203
00:12:43,316 --> 00:12:44,329
Where are you?

204
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:45,607
95, heading north.

205
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,494
Okay. Okay.

206
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,597
All right. We'll try to get a helicopter to you.

207
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:53,544
I'll call you back with an extraction point.

208
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,610
Can you hold out for another hour?

209
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:57,105
Do we have a choice?

210
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,753
This is not for old time's sake, my friend.

211
00:12:58,974 --> 00:13:00,103
I'll need you.

212
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:01,937
I need you back.

213
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,063
Don't forget about us.

214
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:04,527
What do you mean, we've lost Boston?

215
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:05,988
All right. Good luck, Gerry.

216
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:08,008
Okay.

217
00:13:08,076 --> 00:13:10,889
Good, honey. Keep it going. It's gonna be all right.

218
00:13:23,022 --> 00:13:25,089
- Come here. Stay close. - Super close.

219
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:26,627
Take my hand.

220
00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:31,270
Get her medicine, I'll get us something to eat.

221
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:33,138
I'll meet you back here.

222
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:50,445
Stay close, honey.

223
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:05,733
What do you need?

224
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,203
Albuterol.

225
00:14:19,546 --> 00:14:21,795
They outgrow the asthma supposedly.

226
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:28,126
And this shit, too. It's magic for my kid.

227
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:31,162
Thank you.

228
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:37,384
- Daddy! - Connie?

229
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:39,517
Daddy!

230
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:41,429
- Connie? - Daddy!

231
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:42,813
- Where's Mommy? - Gerry!

232
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,616
Gerry!

233
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,918
Kaﬂn?

234
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:48,359
- Karin? - Gerry! Gerry!

235
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:50,867
Get off of me! Get off of me! That's all I have.

236
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,402
- Gerry! - Hey!

237
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:55,509
- Hey! - Gerry.

238
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:14,498
Multiple 11-99s at Washington Park.

239
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:17,161
Please, send units. We're falling back on Reed Street.

240
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:19,032
Two Robert 12, units need backup.

241
00:15:19,105 --> 00:15:20,905
Mobile ops is down. Please respond.

242
00:15:20,977 --> 00:15:22,448
Two Robert 12, are you there? Copy.

243
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:23,904
- Girls! - Responders, Code 3, Code 3.

244
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:25,999
Rachel, quick, come on.

245
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:33,307
No.

246
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,180
No!

247
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:38,027
We got to get out of here. We got to get off the street.

248
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:39,108
Gerry.

249
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:40,872
Apartments?

250
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:43,950
Hey. Yeah.

251
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:52,858
- Gerry? - We're in Newark.

252
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:54,176
We're stranded.

253
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,742
Apartment buildings, 23rd.

254
00:15:55,814 --> 00:15:57,912
If we can get to the roof, can you get someone to us?

255
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,270
- Not tonight. - When?

256
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,390
The earliest would be sunrise.

257
00:16:00,496 --> 00:16:01,401
Sunrise.

258
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,823
Tell him I got flares.

259
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:04,886
We'll be on the roof with flares.

260
00:16:04,953 --> 00:16:07,244
Listen, Gerry, I will move mountains to get you out here.

261
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,988
Come here, baby.

262
00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:24,922
Go! Go! Go!

263
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:28,631
- Baby, in here! - Come on. Quick!

264
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:30,238
Gerry!

265
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,244
Inside, girls!

266
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:42,083
By the stairs. Inside, inside!

267
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,336
Wait!

268
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:48,106
Wait.

269
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,786
Up, up. It's okay, baby.

270
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,729
Run! Run! Go, Rachel!

271
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:59,118
Go!

272
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:01,782
Keep running, baby.

273
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:04,070
-It's all right. - To the top.

274
00:17:09,756 --> 00:17:10,960
Go! Go!

275
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:15,076
Go!

276
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:29,572
Run!

277
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:38,158
Go! Go! Go! Go!

278
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:40,097
I need a new flare!

279
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:42,652
This asshole's about to get through!

280
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:53,771
Where's Connie? Connie?

281
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:55,497
- Connie? - Connie!

282
00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:57,597
- Let me in! - Connie!

283
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:10,932
- Baby? -It's not her. It's not her.

284
00:18:11,562 --> 00:18:13,181
- Let me in! - Connie!

285
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:14,494
Let me in!

286
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:20,935
In, in, in! In!

287
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:29,959
Thank you so much.

288
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:33,702
- I'm Tomas. - Hey, Tomas.

289
00:18:33,774 --> 00:18:35,767
My mom's cooking everything before it starts to stink.

290
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:38,083
That's smart.

291
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:39,212
You guys all right?

292
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:40,335
It's all right.

293
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:42,138
It's okay.

294
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:44,605
Are you guys hungry?

295
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:45,953
Yes, thank you.

296
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,965
- Here you go. - Thank you.

297
00:19:11,495 --> 00:19:12,549
Thank you.

298
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:14,646
You want some juice?

299
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:15,654
The following message

300
00:19:15,728 --> 00:19:19,062
is transmitted at the request of the New Jersey State Police Department.

301
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:22,139
Authorities recommend that the following actions

302
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,934
should be taken by all the members of the public.

303
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,518
Stay indoors if at all possible.

304
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:30,344
Have enough food and water supplies for sheltering

305
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:32,105
for one to two weeks.

306
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:34,650
The following message is transmitted at the request

307
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,749
of the New Jersey State Police Department.

308
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:39,520
An unidentified virus strain is rapidly

309
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:41,506
spreading across the state of New Jersey.

310
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:24,052
She was crying.

311
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:31,660
Thanks, Tommy.

312
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,593
I used to work in dangerous places

313
00:20:35,663 --> 00:20:38,550
and people who moved survived, and those who didn't...

314
00:20:41,244 --> 00:20:43,685
Movement is life.

315
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:48,591
You have a better chance if you come with us.

316
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,563
You need anything else before you leave?

317
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:42,677
Okay. Come on. Come on.

318
00:22:06,012 --> 00:22:07,408
We should have left with them.

319
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:08,715
There is nowhere to go.

320
00:22:08,784 --> 00:22:10,627
What's going to happen when the food is gone?

321
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:19,763
Okay, come on.

322
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,371
I'm scared.

323
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,522
Connie, there's a helicopter waiting for us on the roof.

324
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:30,066
Keep your eyes on Mommy and Daddy, okay?

325
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,409
Be ninja quiet.

326
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,734
Just a walk in the park.

327
00:22:34,518 --> 00:22:36,244
How do we know they're coming?

328
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:38,048
They're coming.

329
00:22:38,114 --> 00:22:39,051
Ready?

330
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:55,766
Okay, come on, guys.

331
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:01,642
Come on! Come on!

332
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,523
Up, up, Up.

333
00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:06,026
Come on, baby.

334
00:23:06,207 --> 00:23:07,603
Go, go, go!

335
00:23:08,642 --> 00:23:10,667
- Come on, baby! - Go, go!

336
00:23:10,852 --> 00:23:12,802
Go, girls! Gerry!

337
00:23:14,036 --> 00:23:15,197
Come on. Gerry!

338
00:23:15,272 --> 00:23:16,594
Girls, get back!

339
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:19,584
Watch out!

340
00:23:29,544 --> 00:23:31,313
- Go! - GO! Go!

341
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:33,037
Come on, faster, girls!

342
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:37,824
Lieutenant, I've got no contact.

343
00:23:37,897 --> 00:23:39,549
I say again, no contact.

344
00:23:40,257 --> 00:23:41,535
Let's go, let's go!

345
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:44,678
Karin!

346
00:23:44,752 --> 00:23:46,030
- Karin! - Yeah.

347
00:23:47,224 --> 00:23:48,428
Go through the door!

348
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:52,169
Gerry?

349
00:24:27,304 --> 00:24:29,105
There they are! Ace, we have positive contact.

350
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:30,760
That's our target! Get us down!

351
00:24:30,825 --> 00:24:31,838
Daddy!

352
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:33,681
- Daddy! - Baby, get back.

353
00:24:33,897 --> 00:24:35,143
Daddy!

354
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,145
Gerry?

355
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:37,721
- Gerry, what? - Stay back!

356
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:39,114
Baby! No!

357
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,457
One thousand seven.

358
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:41,922
One thousand eight.

359
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:43,570
Daddy, get off the edge!

360
00:24:43,636 --> 00:24:45,927
- Gerry, please? - One thousand ten.

361
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,371
One thousand eleven.

362
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,338
I got it in my mouth.

363
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:58,695
You're okay. You're okay.

364
00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:02,183
Go! Go!

365
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,271
Come on. Come on.

366
00:25:14,202 --> 00:25:15,289
Let's go! Let's go!

367
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,276
Come on, let's go! We got to go!

368
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:22,518
You got her?

369
00:25:34,504 --> 00:25:36,198
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

370
00:25:57,541 --> 00:26:00,204
Traffic en route, altitude 5-7 thousand.

371
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:03,653
Heading 250. Turn right, heading 075, once clear.

372
00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:06,160
Remain below 4, 000.

373
00:26:19,716 --> 00:26:23,765
Clear to land, heading 040, wind 060 at five.

374
00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:28,637
Follow L.S.O. directions. Prep for immediate dust off.

375
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,849
Gerry.

376
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,309
Thank you.

377
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,254
Good to see you, my friend.

378
00:26:54,327 --> 00:26:55,979
Tango five, this is Argus command.

379
00:26:56,051 --> 00:26:57,138
Cleared for take-off.

380
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,200
Tango five. Wilco.

381
00:27:16,952 --> 00:27:18,113
Karin, to the right.

382
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:19,808
This is good, right?

383
00:27:19,874 --> 00:27:21,451
Bunk beds!

384
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:24,303
Your bunk beds are number two, three and six.

385
00:27:24,594 --> 00:27:25,755
Please make yourself at home.

386
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,151
You want to get up here?

387
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:30,516
- There you go, sweetheart. - That's good.

388
00:27:30,587 --> 00:27:32,281
We're not dropping anchor again.

389
00:27:32,722 --> 00:27:33,776
You're safe.

390
00:27:33,846 --> 00:27:34,900
It's not me I'm worried about.

391
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,323
They're safe.

392
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,233
Baby-

393
00:27:39,502 --> 00:27:41,867
It's bigger than our old apartment on 72nd.

394
00:27:43,023 --> 00:27:44,152
Need anything, Karin?

395
00:27:44,634 --> 00:27:45,614
Water.

396
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:47,225
I'll organize.

397
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:51,115
Is this worldwide? Is anyone doing better than we are?

398
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,186
Baby. Go talk somewhere else.

399
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:55,839
Okay.

400
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,578
The President is dead.

401
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:09,323
Four of six Joint Chiefs. V.P. missing.

402
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,544
Reports of gun battles in the streets of the capital.

403
00:28:12,615 --> 00:28:13,702
Your parties are panicking.

404
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,028
The bigger cities are the worst off.

405
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:18,880
The airlines were the perfect delivery system.

406
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,111
Carnival cruise vessel Dream has been given permission to join.

407
00:28:23,365 --> 00:28:25,731
Twenty seven knots south and closing.

408
00:28:26,025 --> 00:28:27,943
How soon are they showing symptoms after contact?

409
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:29,737
The provisional government currently considers

410
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,161
northern Minnesota to be a potential safe zone.

411
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:34,460
Have you recorded any instance where a person was bitten but not infected?

412
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,386
How the hell do I know if Russia's fallen?

413
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:47,571
Sir, I cannot action that order.

414
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:49,257
Colonel, I'm sorry, but we cannot facilitate

415
00:28:49,324 --> 00:28:51,050
an evacuation for you or your men.

416
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:54,122
Sir, there is nowhere to evacuate you to.

417
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,780
Malnutrition. Dirty water.

418
00:28:57,377 --> 00:28:59,178
No gas for the winter or transportation.

419
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:01,277
No bullets to fight.

420
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:02,925
And it has spread to all corners of the globe.

421
00:29:03,071 --> 00:29:04,349
The question that we have got to address

422
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:05,656
is what the hell is it?

423
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:07,829
About 5% of the population aren't affected immediately.

424
00:29:07,903 --> 00:29:11,505
It is viral. it has to be viral. There is no plausible alternative.

425
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:15,512
And like any virus, once we find its origin, we can develop a vaccine.

426
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:18,065
- We find it, contain it... - That's Dr. Fassbach.

427
00:29:18,654 --> 00:29:19,858
Virologist from Harvard.

428
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:22,250
The analogy I keep coming back to

429
00:29:22,474 --> 00:29:23,721
is Spanish Flu.

430
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,841
Spanish Flu?

431
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:26,864
It didn't exist in 1918, but by 1920,

432
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,775
it killed 3% Of the world.

433
00:29:28,955 --> 00:29:32,034
He's our best bet at figuring out what this thing is.

434
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,866
You all read the same email I did,

435
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:35,589
and it said "zombies."

436
00:29:36,783 --> 00:29:38,925
Are you completely out of your mind?

437
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:41,401
So, the earliest mention of the word "zombie"

438
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:44,097
was in a memo from Camp Humphreys in South Korea.

439
00:29:44,312 --> 00:29:45,814
We haven't had contact with them since.

440
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:47,164
But this could lead us to the origin.

441
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:48,886
If we knew where this thing started,

442
00:29:48,957 --> 00:29:51,844
then we'd have a chance of developing a vaccine to stop it.

443
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:54,580
So we send in Dr. Fassbach there to look for the source.

444
00:29:54,651 --> 00:29:56,079
He's just a kid.

445
00:29:56,973 --> 00:29:57,986
You're right.

446
00:29:58,846 --> 00:30:00,274
Attention on deck!

447
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:05,557
At ease!

448
00:30:08,361 --> 00:30:10,086
Mr. Under-Secretary.

449
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:13,385
The Under-Secretary here says you were

450
00:30:13,455 --> 00:30:15,969
his best investigator when you were at the U.N.

451
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:18,288
I want to send you in. With a team.

452
00:30:18,362 --> 00:30:21,175
Help Dr. Fassbach find whatever it is he needs.

453
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:22,820
You brought...

454
00:30:22,894 --> 00:30:24,769
I wanted for the circumstances to speak for themselves.

455
00:30:24,842 --> 00:30:25,897
No.

456
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:29,302
Captain, I'm not your guy.

457
00:30:30,274 --> 00:30:33,204
You were on the ground during the Liberian Civil War.

458
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:36,717
Investigated Chechen war crimes. Sri Lanka in '07.

459
00:30:36,979 --> 00:30:39,610
Places you and I both know Dr. Fassbach wouldn't last a night in.

460
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:41,966
Gerry, a handful of SEALs will go with you as security force.

461
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:43,016
No.

462
00:30:43,084 --> 00:30:45,034
My guys will get you in, you assist the doctor,

463
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:47,062
pursue any leads, my guys will get you out.

464
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:48,862
We do the heavy lifting.

465
00:30:49,677 --> 00:30:52,756
I can't help you. I can't leave my family.

466
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:56,652
Take a look around here, Mr. Lane.

467
00:30:57,131 --> 00:31:01,254
Each and every one of these people are here because they serve a purpose.

468
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,562
There's no room here for non-essential personnel.

469
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:07,174
There's a long line of people

470
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,934
waiting for one of those bunks.

471
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,097
You want to help your family,

472
00:31:13,201 --> 00:31:15,683
let's figure out how we stop this.

473
00:31:16,347 --> 00:31:18,222
It's your choice, Mr. Lane.

474
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,607
Simple.

475
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:23,325
You don't work for them anymore.

476
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:24,742
- Karin... - You might not remember

477
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:26,762
What this job did to you, but I do.

478
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:28,678
So do not ask me to say yes to this.

479
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:29,726
I have to go.

480
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:32,383
They're going to kick us off the ship.

481
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:35,083
What?

482
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:38,525
If I go, you, the girls, Tommy, have a place to stay.

483
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:41,260
If I don't, we're back in Philly tonight.

484
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,559
What about Thierry? Can't he do anything?

485
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,890
Men like Thierry aren't in charge of anything anymore.

486
00:31:48,598 --> 00:31:50,324
You keep this with you.

487
00:31:50,396 --> 00:31:51,334
I'll call in once a day.

488
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:53,624
As long as I make that call, everything's gonna be okay.

489
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:56,774
I'm coming back.

490
00:31:57,101 --> 00:31:59,094
Okay? We're going to make the best of it.

491
00:32:00,548 --> 00:32:01,794
As we do.

492
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,367
Like we do.

493
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:16,171
Okay, baby doll, Daddy's got to go to work.

494
00:32:16,692 --> 00:32:18,237
I'm not a baby.

495
00:32:19,127 --> 00:32:20,256
Okay.

496
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,575
Tall, beautiful, tiny adult.

497
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:25,796
I'll be back soon.

498
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:26,999
Yeah?

499
00:32:28,342 --> 00:32:30,111
All right, tough guy..-

500
00:32:30,664 --> 00:32:31,676
Take care of the ladies for me?

501
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,731
Yeah.

502
00:32:32,837 --> 00:32:33,924
Deal.

503
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:36,966
You're awesome.

504
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,393
Daddy's coming back.

505
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,584
This way, sir.

506
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:54,047
Look.

507
00:33:54,121 --> 00:33:55,250
We don't know what we're walking into.

508
00:33:55,394 --> 00:33:57,237
So we do what they say. Okay.

509
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,702
If they move, we move. If they stop, we stop.

510
00:33:59,777 --> 00:34:01,354
If things were to get crazy,

511
00:34:01,612 --> 00:34:02,859
just focus on their boots,

512
00:34:02,923 --> 00:34:04,351
focus on their voices, and we'll be all right.

513
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,710
These guys are hammers.

514
00:34:06,782 --> 00:34:08,433
And to hammers, everything looks like nails.

515
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:09,517
I heard that.

516
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:11,019
You were meant to.

517
00:34:11,164 --> 00:34:13,007
So, you see something that's important,

518
00:34:13,074 --> 00:34:15,141
you call it out and we'll make it happen.

519
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:16,714
Okay.

520
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:20,343
You think we're gonna find anything?

521
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:21,990
Yeah.

522
00:34:22,514 --> 00:34:24,091
Yeah, we're gonna find something.

523
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:28,174
Mother Nature is a serial killer.

524
00:34:29,256 --> 00:34:30,652
No one's better.

525
00:34:30,979 --> 00:34:32,375
More creative.

526
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:34,693
But like all serial killers,

527
00:34:34,763 --> 00:34:37,394
she can't help the urge to want to get caught.

528
00:34:37,984 --> 00:34:39,486
What good are all those brilliant crimes

529
00:34:39,557 --> 00:34:41,507
if no one takes the credit?

530
00:34:41,618 --> 00:34:43,461
So she leaves crumbs.

531
00:34:44,427 --> 00:34:46,345
Now, the hard part, why you spend a decade in school,

532
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:49,188
is seeing the crumbs for the clues they are.

533
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:51,733
Sometimes the thing you thought

534
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,073
was the most brutal aspect of the virus,

535
00:34:55,852 --> 00:34:58,025
turns out to be the chink in its armor.

536
00:35:00,234 --> 00:35:03,644
And she loves disguising her weaknesses as strengths.

537
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,431
She's a bitch.

538
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,163
Attention! D.C. has gone dark. I repeat,

539
00:35:20,237 --> 00:35:21,515
D.C. has gone dark.

540
00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:23,466
The Capitol evacuation has been suspended.

541
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:27,775
All available resources should be directed to Naval Station Norfolk.

542
00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:30,957
All non-essential personnel

543
00:35:31,025 --> 00:35:33,582
given F-6 status and in groups A through E

544
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:36,310
need to report to the flight deck for relocation.

545
00:35:37,543 --> 00:35:40,473
Groups A and B relocating to Orlando

546
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:42,788
should be on the stern clear of the landing zone.

547
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:48,602
I say again, all non-essential personnel given F-6 status

548
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:50,580
need to report to the flight deck.

549
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:53,434
Choppers are inbound for immediate relocation.

550
00:36:01,928 --> 00:36:03,654
Mommy, is this dinner?

551
00:36:03,951 --> 00:36:05,005
Yes, sweetheart.

552
00:36:05,074 --> 00:36:06,917
Water here tastes funny.

553
00:36:07,397 --> 00:36:08,942
It's jet fuel, young lady.

554
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,591
He's joking.

555
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:15,231
I wish. Desal has trouble filtering it out.

556
00:36:15,975 --> 00:36:19,160
Probably because there's too many people on this ship.

557
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,660
Everybody wake up.

558
00:36:31,332 --> 00:36:33,623
We're on approach to Camp Humphreys.

559
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,846
Most of the base is dark, and no one is manning the tower.

560
00:36:36,914 --> 00:36:38,788
We're running on fumes, so there's really no choice,

561
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:40,183
I've got to put us down.

562
00:36:40,247 --> 00:36:41,494
So buckle up.

563
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:07,406
Hold up.

564
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:09,991
Keep your finger off the trigger.

565
00:37:16,432 --> 00:37:17,561
Okay.

566
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:43,594
Fassbach!Wait!

567
00:37:45,986 --> 00:37:47,191
Damn it.

568
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:55,502
Move back!

569
00:37:56,587 --> 00:37:59,219
Friendly! Friendly! Keep it down. Keep it down.

570
00:37:59,284 --> 00:38:00,978
What is this? What happened to him?

571
00:38:01,307 --> 00:38:02,436
He slipped. He's dead.

572
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:04,348
Come on! Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

573
00:38:21,122 --> 00:38:22,209
Okay, I'm good!

574
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,426
- Who was it? Who fell? - Skilken.

575
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,443
- Hold! Clear. - Hold.

576
00:38:28,127 --> 00:38:29,704
I want an ammo count, then you reload your mags!

577
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:30,756
Yes, sir!

578
00:38:30,824 --> 00:38:32,625
My boy who just died out there was 23.

579
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:34,617
He was 23.

580
00:38:35,169 --> 00:38:36,788
You want to tell me why?

581
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:40,381
Because the guy who just shot himself, he's a doctor, a virologist.

582
00:38:41,012 --> 00:38:42,067
What are you talking about?

583
00:38:42,136 --> 00:38:43,830
He was supposed to be our best hope.

584
00:38:43,897 --> 00:38:45,442
Well, he's not our best hope anymore.

585
00:38:45,507 --> 00:38:47,500
Hey. That guy volunteered to come here.

586
00:38:47,568 --> 00:38:48,921
He didn't have to, you know.

587
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:50,152
None of them did.

588
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,332
We're still trying to figure out what the hell this thing is.

589
00:38:52,737 --> 00:38:54,985
Well, shit happens.

590
00:38:56,445 --> 00:38:58,470
The doctor would have strongly agreed with you.

591
00:38:58,543 --> 00:38:59,938
How do we go about refueling?

592
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,966
When I say so. And very carefully.

593
00:39:03,862 --> 00:39:06,035
The noise, are they drawn to it?

594
00:39:06,372 --> 00:39:08,662
Yeah. Sound draws them.

595
00:39:08,994 --> 00:39:11,242
Body shots only seem to slow them down.

596
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:13,639
Head shots do the trick, but just to be safe

597
00:39:13,713 --> 00:39:15,663
we tend to burn them when we can.

598
00:39:15,961 --> 00:39:17,804
- You fought any Zeke yet? - Yeah.

599
00:39:17,984 --> 00:39:20,200
- Where? - Philly. Newark.

600
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:21,511
Bad?

601
00:39:24,352 --> 00:39:25,513
- What about Houston? - St. Louis?

602
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:26,643
- Baltimore? - Atlanta?

603
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:27,799
Detroit?

604
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,002
Guys, I'll be honest with you,

605
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:31,922
I don't know of any place back home that's doing very well.

606
00:39:31,993 --> 00:39:33,314
All right...

607
00:39:34,877 --> 00:39:37,615
If the other guy was a virologist, what do you do?

608
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:40,947
There was a memo sent from this installation 11 days ago.

609
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,406
It had the word "zombie" in it.

610
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:44,324
Do you know anything about it?

611
00:39:44,392 --> 00:39:45,404
Yeah.

612
00:39:45,778 --> 00:39:48,026
It was an email, not a memo.

613
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,803
Pretty obvious nobody back home bothered to read it.

614
00:39:55,442 --> 00:39:58,447
Now, there's 15, 16 guys in this room.

615
00:39:58,738 --> 00:40:01,551
Most of them guards. But all of them were bitten

616
00:40:01,622 --> 00:40:03,689
trying to get this man handcuffed to the cot.

617
00:40:04,057 --> 00:40:06,912
Now, our colonel said he was the first one.

618
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,856
This colonel, is he around?

619
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:10,056
Oh, yeah. He's right here.

620
00:40:17,055 --> 00:40:19,644
The guy who's shackled, do you know

621
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:21,441
who bit him, what bit him?

622
00:40:21,737 --> 00:40:23,431
He was the base doctor.

623
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:27,171
He'd just returned from the field.

624
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:30,207
He'd been sent out to verify the death of a soldier

625
00:40:30,278 --> 00:40:32,420
who had just gone AWOL the week before.

626
00:40:32,788 --> 00:40:34,705
Some villagers had found this guy

627
00:40:34,773 --> 00:40:37,255
foaming at the mouth, oozing some kind of black tar.

628
00:40:38,032 --> 00:40:39,981
Then he tried to bite one of them.

629
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:42,196
They shot him, tied him up, threw him in a barn.

630
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,995
That's all we know, except the doctor

631
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,948
comes back here and begins attacking his patients.

632
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,460
This soldier, do you know where he came from?

633
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:03,617
No.

634
00:41:03,691 --> 00:41:06,504
Anyone he might have come in contact with?

635
00:41:06,575 --> 00:41:07,512
No.

636
00:41:07,586 --> 00:41:09,014
There's got to be records.

637
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,539
You are welcome to take a look if you want.

638
00:41:15,715 --> 00:41:18,155
Then the origin could have come from anywhere.

639
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:19,461
It's a shame you had to fly

640
00:41:19,535 --> 00:41:21,410
all the way out here to figure that out.

641
00:41:25,154 --> 00:41:26,731
How did you all escape this?

642
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:29,169
The expenditure of ammunition.

643
00:41:30,548 --> 00:41:32,274
Is that how you tweaked your leg?

644
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:35,763
No, shit's been bugging me a while.

645
00:41:36,729 --> 00:41:39,360
This prick stands right in the mix,

646
00:41:39,426 --> 00:41:40,704
while seven or eight of them

647
00:41:40,812 --> 00:41:42,506
turn Zeke all at the same time.

648
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:44,522
But they got no time for OI' Dirty Bastard here.

649
00:41:44,595 --> 00:41:46,811
Biting everything like fat kids love Twix.

650
00:41:48,303 --> 00:41:49,773
Got no time for his lucky ass.

651
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,416
Ain't it obvious I'm charmed?

652
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:54,567
The ones I saw bitten turned in 12 seconds. Same here?

653
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:55,955
Five or 10 minutes.

654
00:41:56,094 --> 00:41:59,173
Yeah, Davidson went and he turned in 10 minutes.

655
00:41:59,466 --> 00:42:00,553
"Stevie?

656
00:42:00,627 --> 00:42:03,781
"Captain Spekes! Oh, my God! My God! My God! Are they eating me?"

657
00:42:04,373 --> 00:42:05,310
Who's that?

658
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:06,998
Waste no time on that freak.

659
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:08,382
He's C.l.A.

660
00:42:08,456 --> 00:42:10,256
Got caught selling guns to North Korea.

661
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:11,575
Davidson,

662
00:42:12,052 --> 00:42:14,076
he turned in 10 minutes.

663
00:42:14,374 --> 00:42:17,528
That doesn't sound viral to me at all, sports fans!

664
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:21,986
You're with the C.I.A.?

665
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:26,665
But they're not with me.

666
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,101
And who are you?

667
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:33,488
U.N.

668
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:35,130
Oh, my God!

669
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,516
Captain, put on the World Music!

670
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,385
The day

671
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,676
is saved!

672
00:42:44,378 --> 00:42:45,465
Why'd you sell guns to the North?

673
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:46,551
Why not?

674
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:47,899
Are they surviving this?

675
00:42:47,974 --> 00:42:49,103
Indeed they are.

676
00:42:49,173 --> 00:42:50,568
Using your guns.

677
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:53,447
Guns are half-measures.

678
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:54,685
How then?

679
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,955
All right.

680
00:43:22,885 --> 00:43:24,313
They took away

681
00:43:25,507 --> 00:43:28,992
the Zekes' exponential power.

682
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:33,825
They pulled the teeth of all 23 million

683
00:43:34,235 --> 00:43:37,272
in less than 24 hours.

684
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:44,276
The greatest feat of social engineering in history.

685
00:43:44,686 --> 00:43:46,114
It's brilliant.

686
00:43:46,446 --> 00:43:47,650
No teeth,

687
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:49,865
no bite.

688
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:51,919
No great spread.

689
00:43:55,698 --> 00:43:56,711
Bullshit.

690
00:43:56,897 --> 00:44:00,125
More books, fewer receptions, Boutros Boutros.

691
00:44:00,493 --> 00:44:02,336
Now, why do you have to burn them

692
00:44:02,403 --> 00:44:04,055
to ashes to get them to finally stop?

693
00:44:04,126 --> 00:44:05,628
Why do they move like a plague?

694
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,319
Why is Israel winning?

695
00:44:08,322 --> 00:44:09,792
How is Israel winning?

696
00:44:10,532 --> 00:44:12,673
They sealed off their entire country

697
00:44:13,304 --> 00:44:16,085
days before the undead attacked man.

698
00:44:16,525 --> 00:44:17,771
First to know,

699
00:44:18,285 --> 00:44:19,639
first to act.

700
00:44:19,934 --> 00:44:21,926
People have been building walls there for two millennia.

701
00:44:23,043 --> 00:44:24,545
Right. Yeah, but,

702
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:26,193
finish all those

703
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:28,747
thousands of years of work a week ago?

704
00:44:29,598 --> 00:44:30,993
Impeccable timing is all.

705
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:35,932
You want answers?

706
00:44:37,764 --> 00:44:39,383
Jurgen Warmbrunn.

707
00:44:40,348 --> 00:44:44,099
That's the man in Jerusalem you want to see.

708
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,460
You ever seen anything like that?

709
00:44:46,566 --> 00:44:47,654
Hell, no.

710
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:50,838
We're going to Jerusalem. I'm your co-pilot.

711
00:44:57,055 --> 00:44:58,109
Oh, hang on.

712
00:44:58,328 --> 00:44:59,830
Hang on. Hang on a minute.

713
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,005
Hello?

714
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,589
Gerry?

715
00:45:05,445 --> 00:45:07,246
- Honey? - Geny, can you hear me?

716
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:08,299
Kaﬂn?

717
00:45:09,004 --> 00:45:10,165
Hello?

718
00:45:13,124 --> 00:45:14,669
God damn it!

719
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,339
Give me your hand.

720
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:29,125
No way. No.

721
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:30,398
My mother. Dallas.

722
00:45:30,467 --> 00:45:32,875
Probably pacing a hole in the floor right now if she's still there.

723
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,347
Better chance of you seeing her before me, that's all.

724
00:45:35,412 --> 00:45:37,734
It's a big plane. We got a lot of room.

725
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:40,622
Better the devil you know than the one you don't.

726
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,545
You'll be all right. Just pedal your ass off.

727
00:45:43,727 --> 00:45:45,677
Make sure Maverick here keeps the nose of that plane

728
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,805
pointed towards the sun.

729
00:45:46,874 --> 00:45:49,911
Just remember, don't lock the bowser's fuel line to the inlet.

730
00:45:49,983 --> 00:45:51,411
Tell me 10 more times.

731
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:52,834
- You good? - Right here.

732
00:45:52,905 --> 00:45:54,823
All right. Don't rush.

733
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:58,004
We've got one chance to fuel their plane, so let's do it right.

734
00:45:58,224 --> 00:46:00,099
If you ain't a crack shot, don't aim for the head,

735
00:46:00,172 --> 00:46:01,152
just get Zeke on the ground.

736
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,182
Remember, "Spine's divine, those knees they work just fine!"

737
00:46:04,255 --> 00:46:05,906
Let's go, lights out!

738
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:27,148
Alpha in position.

739
00:46:27,216 --> 00:46:29,134
Bravo moving out.

740
00:46:29,202 --> 00:46:31,450
Remember, these things are drawn to sound.

741
00:46:31,524 --> 00:46:34,454
So I need you close to target before I bring you the truck.

742
00:46:34,521 --> 00:46:37,035
Now there's only one way we're getting you on that plane,

743
00:46:37,143 --> 00:46:39,061
and that's quietly.

744
00:47:06,772 --> 00:47:07,753
Shit!

745
00:47:07,821 --> 00:47:09,664
God damn it! Shut that thing off!

746
00:47:13,814 --> 00:47:15,136
Looks like we just woke the dead.

747
00:47:16,212 --> 00:47:17,224
Out of respect for others,

748
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:18,912
please turn off all pagers and cell phones.

749
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,301
We got to move.

750
00:47:23,965 --> 00:47:25,766
We've got to get out of here, let's move!

751
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:33,030
Go, go, go!

752
00:47:42,357 --> 00:47:43,519
I'm gonna clear a path through Zeke!

753
00:47:43,593 --> 00:47:44,989
You pedal like hell!

754
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:49,662
Come on, boys, I need head shots! Tap 'em out!

755
00:47:49,737 --> 00:47:51,389
I want to see some Zeke on the ground!

756
00:48:26,895 --> 00:48:29,378
You're kidding me. I'm a God damn Zeke.

757
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,931
I got you, Captain. Just say the word.

758
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,232
It's all right, boys. I got this one.

759
00:48:38,432 --> 00:48:39,977
- God damn it. - We got enough!

760
00:48:40,492 --> 00:48:42,293
We need to detach the fuel line!

761
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:45,776
Israel better pay off.

762
00:48:55,101 --> 00:48:56,795
All right, I have instrument, but only on single prop.

763
00:48:56,862 --> 00:48:57,949
You'll have to talk me through it.

764
00:49:00,907 --> 00:49:02,068
Okay, we're clear.

765
00:49:02,143 --> 00:49:03,538
Okay. Give me all the lights.

766
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:07,584
Switch on the anti-icing.

767
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:08,587
- Where? - The red knob.

768
00:49:08,698 --> 00:49:10,947
- Got it, got it. - Set up our heading 020 for departure.

769
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:13,569
- We got to move! - Set flaps 15 degrees.

770
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:14,964
Flaps 15.

771
00:49:15,104 --> 00:49:17,320
All right, we are all set. Let's get out of here!

772
00:49:19,674 --> 00:49:20,952
Make it steep.

773
00:49:39,789 --> 00:49:41,067
- Gerry? - Hi, baby.

774
00:49:41,137 --> 00:49:42,149
Hi. Hi.

775
00:49:43,909 --> 00:49:45,635
I tried to call you.

776
00:49:46,419 --> 00:49:48,113
I know, I was...

777
00:49:48,629 --> 00:49:50,695
It was bad timing, I was running around.

778
00:49:51,213 --> 00:49:52,609
Are you okay?

779
00:49:56,795 --> 00:49:59,117
Yeah, every/thing's okay. I'm okay.

780
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:02,118
That's the spirit.

781
00:50:02,601 --> 00:50:03,655
Yeah.

782
00:50:04,249 --> 00:50:05,453
Listen,

783
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:07,330
Korea didn't work out.

784
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,645
Now it looks like we're gonna have to go to Israel.

785
00:50:12,714 --> 00:50:14,707
Try to get some rest on the flight.

786
00:50:15,486 --> 00:50:16,988
How are the kids?

787
00:50:20,281 --> 00:50:21,527
I think...

788
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,413
They're really... They're good.

789
00:50:26,499 --> 00:50:28,225
I got Connie right here.

790
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,648
Baby?

791
00:50:55,566 --> 00:50:58,007
Attention, unidentified aircraft.

792
00:50:58,076 --> 00:51:01,113
You are in a restricted airspace and not clear for landing.

793
00:51:01,522 --> 00:51:03,547
Jerusalem tower, Reach 394.

794
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,613
Pan, pan, pan. Request immediate landing.

795
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,002
Contact Mossad, office of Jurgen Warmbrunn.

796
00:51:08,077 --> 00:51:09,697
Special Envoy, United Nations.

797
00:51:19,165 --> 00:51:22,650
Stay with the plane. Be ready to bug out. I'll be back before dark.

798
00:52:14,753 --> 00:52:15,999
The problem with most people is that

799
00:52:16,064 --> 00:52:17,641
they don't believe something can happen

800
00:52:17,899 --> 00:52:19,625
until it already has.

801
00:52:19,847 --> 00:52:21,648
It's not stupidity or weakness.

802
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,383
It's just human nature.

803
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:28,467
How did you know?

804
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,115
Gerald Lane.

805
00:52:30,635 --> 00:52:32,958
Wrote a self-defeating Jeremiad

806
00:52:33,032 --> 00:52:35,994
about his employer, the U.N. back in 2010.

807
00:52:36,816 --> 00:52:39,597
Caused a few ripples. Sidelined your career.

808
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:43,156
Thought you'd have parlayed those ripples into a self-righteous book.

809
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:44,798
No nose for profit.

810
00:52:45,169 --> 00:52:46,895
How did Israel know?

811
00:52:47,641 --> 00:52:50,571
We intercepted a communique from an Indian general

812
00:52:50,937 --> 00:52:53,303
saying they were fighting the Rakshasha.

813
00:52:53,372 --> 00:52:55,813
Translation, zombies.

814
00:52:56,182 --> 00:52:58,280
Technically undead.

815
00:53:00,864 --> 00:53:02,217
Jurgen Warmbrunn.

816
00:53:02,287 --> 00:53:04,536
High-ranking official in the Mossad.

817
00:53:04,872 --> 00:53:09,294
Described as sober, efficient, not terribly imaginative.

818
00:53:09,779 --> 00:53:12,709
And yet you build a wall because you read a communique

819
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:14,800
that mentions the word "zombie"?

820
00:53:15,922 --> 00:53:19,332
Well, when put like that, I'd be skeptical as well.

821
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:22,035
In the '30s, Jews refused to believe

822
00:53:22,103 --> 00:53:24,468
they could be sent to concentration camps.

823
00:53:24,725 --> 00:53:28,699
In '72, we refused to fathom we'd be massacred in the Olympics.

824
00:53:29,145 --> 00:53:33,012
In the month before October 1973, we saw Arab troop movements,

825
00:53:33,078 --> 00:53:35,667
and we unanimously agreed they didn't pose a threat.

826
00:53:36,412 --> 00:53:40,535
Well, a month later, the Arab attack almost drove us into the sea.

827
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:43,380
So we decided to make a change.

828
00:53:44,353 --> 00:53:45,514
A change?

829
00:53:45,963 --> 00:53:47,242
The Tenth Man.

830
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:50,354
If nine of us look at the same information

831
00:53:50,421 --> 00:53:52,829
and arrive at the exact same conclusion,

832
00:53:52,893 --> 00:53:55,408
it's the duty of the tenth man to disagree.

833
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,105
No matter how improbable it may seem,

834
00:53:58,175 --> 00:54:00,093
the tenth man has to start digging

835
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,302
on the assumption that the other nine are wrong.

836
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:05,713
And you were that tenth man.

837
00:54:06,565 --> 00:54:07,546
Precisely.

838
00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:17,624
Since everyone assumed that this talk of zombies was cover for something else,

839
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:20,578
I began my investigation on the assumption

840
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:24,624
that when they said "zombies," they meant zombies.

841
00:54:25,707 --> 00:54:27,177
Was patient zero from India?

842
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,634
That's the problem.

843
00:54:28,703 --> 00:54:30,173
There's so many potential sources in play

844
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:31,933
that no one knows where it began.

845
00:54:32,824 --> 00:54:34,624
The organ trade in Germany.

846
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:38,556
Strange examples of violent behavior across the Asian peninsulas.

847
00:54:39,454 --> 00:54:42,905
Meanwhile, the zombie plague keeps spreading, and we do what we can.

848
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,796
These are the Jerusalem Salvation Gates.

849
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,235
Two of 10 portals

850
00:54:49,305 --> 00:54:51,937
through the security perimeter into fortified Israel.

851
00:54:56,197 --> 00:54:57,891
You're letting people in.

852
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,182
Every human being we save is one less zombie to fight.

853
00:55:40,698 --> 00:55:41,944
It's okay.

854
00:56:07,106 --> 00:56:10,557
If I could get into India, where would I start? Who would I speak with?

855
00:56:10,627 --> 00:56:12,428
India's a black hole.

856
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,374
Forget about patient zero.

857
00:56:14,447 --> 00:56:16,813
I can't do that. It's too late for me to build a wall.

858
00:56:21,115 --> 00:56:23,108
I'm running out of time. I need specifics.

859
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:25,200
- I need answers... - I don't have answers.

860
00:56:25,273 --> 00:56:27,266
All you can do is find a way to hide.

861
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,609
Get troops down there.

862
00:56:46,811 --> 00:56:48,239
It's too loud! It's too loud!

863
00:56:52,393 --> 00:56:53,788
They're coming over the top!

864
00:57:04,229 --> 00:57:05,242
Shit!

865
00:57:06,402 --> 00:57:08,128
Command, we have a breach at Salvation Gate.

866
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,670
They're coming over the wall!

867
00:57:48,879 --> 00:57:51,469
Get him to Jaffa Gate.

868
00:58:08,657 --> 00:58:10,831
She'll get you out of here, she'll get you to your plane!

869
00:58:34,241 --> 00:58:35,786
Stay low!

870
00:58:35,852 --> 00:58:37,322
Wrong way! Wrong way!

871
00:58:38,511 --> 00:58:41,473
Go to landing point B.

872
00:58:42,107 --> 00:58:44,473
Roger, we are inbound to landing point B.

873
00:59:45,974 --> 00:59:47,998
Hawk 5, almost there. E.T.A. one minute.

874
00:59:49,232 --> 00:59:51,673
Hawk 5. Hawk 5, you're patched in. Over.

875
00:59:51,742 --> 00:59:53,692
This is Hawk 5. Listen carefully.

876
00:59:54,177 --> 00:59:57,256
The city is breached, and they're heading towards the airport.

877
01:02:02,096 --> 01:02:03,258
One thousand one.

878
01:02:03,332 --> 01:02:04,579
One thousand two.

879
01:02:04,643 --> 01:02:06,785
One thousand three. One thousand four.

880
01:02:08,352 --> 01:02:09,673
One thousand five.

881
01:02:10,487 --> 01:02:11,691
One thousand six.

882
01:02:12,285 --> 01:02:13,638
One thousand seven.

883
01:02:14,907 --> 01:02:16,153
One thousand eight.

884
01:02:20,001 --> 01:02:21,056
We got to move.

885
01:02:31,426 --> 01:02:32,555
You'll be all right.

886
01:02:33,187 --> 01:02:35,328
You're not gonna turn. You're not gonna turn!

887
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:38,965
We got to move.

888
01:02:39,817 --> 01:02:40,797
We got to move!

889
01:03:04,689 --> 01:03:06,117
5 going down.

890
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,017
Chopper 5 is down.

891
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:15,561
I say again, chopper 5 is down.

892
01:03:15,627 --> 01:03:17,321
L.Z. is overrun.

893
01:03:17,987 --> 01:03:21,630
Tower, Reach 394. Requesting immediate departure.

894
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:23,832
Tower to 394. Proceed to runway four.

895
01:03:23,905 --> 01:03:25,109
Good luck out there.

896
01:03:41,173 --> 01:03:42,302
No!

897
01:03:45,443 --> 01:03:47,212
There! That one!

898
01:03:53,909 --> 01:03:55,262
Stop. Stop.

899
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:14,737
Go! Go!

900
01:04:27,022 --> 01:04:28,300
Get them out of here!

901
01:04:32,865 --> 01:04:35,529
Stay calm, please. Stay calm.

902
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,807
Come on. Go, go, go.

903
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,292
What's your destination?

904
01:04:54,366 --> 01:04:56,284
I don't know. We were headed here, but I don't know.

905
01:06:55,731 --> 01:06:57,350
I'm Gerry, by the way.

906
01:06:58,540 --> 01:06:59,552
Segen.

907
01:07:00,488 --> 01:07:01,542
Segen.

908
01:07:02,473 --> 01:07:03,634
First or last?

909
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:05,967
Just Segen.

910
01:07:06,331 --> 01:07:07,269
So, what we're doing,

911
01:07:07,343 --> 01:07:08,995
we've got to change this bandage and we're gonna clean it.

912
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,120
Okay?

913
01:07:14,048 --> 01:07:15,848
You okay? Okay?

914
01:07:19,816 --> 01:07:20,903
Okay.

915
01:07:23,862 --> 01:07:25,556
Come on, gut up. Gut up.

916
01:07:26,933 --> 01:07:28,180
Here we go.

917
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:31,092
We're almost there.

918
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:34,052
Okay. Big breaths.

919
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,940
Let's get this over fast. Big breaths.

920
01:07:37,796 --> 01:07:38,883
Here we go.

921
01:07:43,003 --> 01:07:44,996
Come on. Good.

922
01:07:45,999 --> 01:07:47,800
Last step. Last step.

923
01:07:48,434 --> 01:07:49,415
Big breath.

924
01:07:51,169 --> 01:07:53,726
Good job. There it is. Okay.

925
01:07:57,087 --> 01:07:59,644
Okay. Okay, I think you've earned this.

926
01:08:03,043 --> 01:08:04,438
Very good. Okay.

927
01:08:05,515 --> 01:08:06,793
You a doctor?

928
01:08:07,238 --> 01:08:08,250
No.

929
01:08:08,662 --> 01:08:10,164
I've had some training in the field.

930
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:13,046
How did you know?

931
01:08:13,981 --> 01:08:16,079
Cutting it off... How did you know it would work?

932
01:08:16,415 --> 01:08:17,694
I didn't.

933
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,725
Now I'm just a liability.

934
01:08:26,304 --> 01:08:27,658
This prick

935
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:29,944
stands right in the mix,

936
01:08:30,013 --> 01:08:31,142
while seven or eight of them

937
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:33,278
turn Zeke all at the same time.

938
01:08:33,347 --> 01:08:35,115
Is that how you tweaked your leg?

939
01:08:36,118 --> 01:08:37,993
No, shit's been bugging me a while.

940
01:08:38,778 --> 01:08:40,803
Got no time for his lucky ass.

941
01:08:41,924 --> 01:08:44,407
Now, the hard part is seeing the crumbs

942
01:08:44,472 --> 01:08:46,017
for the clues they are.

943
01:08:48,068 --> 01:08:49,868
And sometimes the thing you thought

944
01:08:50,053 --> 01:08:53,132
was the most brutal aspect of the virus

945
01:08:54,323 --> 01:08:56,645
turns out to be the chink in its armor.

946
01:08:56,945 --> 01:08:58,149
I don't have answers.

947
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:03,579
All you can do is find a way to hide.

948
01:09:19,907 --> 01:09:20,919
Gerry?

949
01:09:20,993 --> 01:09:22,271
Are you okay? Where are you, baby? What's happening?

950
01:09:22,342 --> 01:09:23,354
I love you. I'm sorry.

951
01:09:23,465 --> 01:09:24,553
But you've got to get Thierry now.

952
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:25,607
I'll find him.

953
01:09:28,522 --> 01:09:30,365
- Thierry! Thierry. - Excuse me. Karin.

954
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:31,711
Gerry needs you. I love you.

955
01:09:32,942 --> 01:09:34,189
Gerry? Where are you?

956
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,678
On the last flight out.

957
01:09:35,752 --> 01:09:37,670
Listen, my phone is dying and I need some quick intel.

958
01:09:37,737 --> 01:09:39,687
You gotta locate the closest medical research facility.

959
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,391
A C.D.C., a W.H.O., something that makes vaccines.

960
01:09:42,457 --> 01:09:44,375
- And the closest airport to it. - I don't understand.

961
01:09:44,929 --> 01:09:46,133
No time to explain.

962
01:09:46,203 --> 01:09:47,215
Just make it happen, man.

963
01:09:47,289 --> 01:09:48,376
Okay, Okay-

964
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,231
But, Gerry, I still don't know where you are.

965
01:09:56,991 --> 01:09:58,152
Well, go and find out what he needs.

966
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:01,303
You're gonna want to take this.

967
01:10:02,984 --> 01:10:04,038
Take it.

968
01:10:15,233 --> 01:10:16,554
Your battery is dead.

969
01:10:17,967 --> 01:10:20,481
We made contact with Cardiff Airport, Wales.

970
01:10:20,552 --> 01:10:22,576
Your people directed us.

971
01:10:22,649 --> 01:10:25,207
There is W.H.O. research facility nearby,

972
01:10:25,271 --> 01:10:27,712
but they are not sure it's still operational.

973
01:10:27,781 --> 01:10:28,910
This is location.

974
01:10:29,354 --> 01:10:30,601
Can we make it?

975
01:10:39,056 --> 01:10:41,049
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain.

976
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,402
I'm glad to report that we are on our final approach

977
01:10:43,476 --> 01:10:45,021
to Cardiff Airport in Wales.

978
01:10:45,087 --> 01:10:47,644
All European airports are under lockdown.

979
01:10:47,709 --> 01:10:51,534
But we have been given priority status and cleared for landing.

980
01:10:51,604 --> 01:10:54,119
We will be allowed to disembark.

981
01:10:54,976 --> 01:10:57,192
We are very, very lucky.

982
01:11:20,522 --> 01:11:22,397
Hey. Who do you belong to?

983
01:12:22,403 --> 01:12:23,415
What's there?

984
01:12:23,489 --> 01:12:24,502
What is it?

985
01:12:28,284 --> 01:12:30,351
You... Bags.

986
01:12:31,618 --> 01:12:33,237
We need trolley and bags.

987
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:32,384
Mayday, mayday, mayday! Bravo 160 heavy.

988
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:33,886
Emergency descent!

989
01:15:22,389 --> 01:15:23,519
Prepare for impact.

990
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,267
Got to move.

991
01:18:35,074 --> 01:18:36,320
Come on, come on.

992
01:18:56,275 --> 01:18:57,522
Give me something good.

993
01:18:57,586 --> 01:18:59,835
Sir, Cardiff Airport lost contact with the plane.

994
01:18:59,909 --> 01:19:02,050
Lane is M.I.A. I'm sorry, sir.

995
01:19:16,128 --> 01:19:18,450
Chopper inbound for immediate relocation.

996
01:19:18,525 --> 01:19:19,687
I say again.

997
01:19:19,761 --> 01:19:22,169
All non-essential personnel given F-6 status

998
01:19:22,234 --> 01:19:24,641
need to report for immediate relocation.

999
01:19:26,616 --> 01:19:27,777
Ma'am?

1000
01:19:28,152 --> 01:19:29,921
Thierry would like a word with you.

1001
01:19:35,981 --> 01:19:37,782
Captain, it's only been 48 hours.

1002
01:19:37,854 --> 01:19:41,157
He's a resourceful man. There's every chance he could have survived.

1003
01:19:41,225 --> 01:19:44,112
Sir, I gave him my word we would look after his family.

1004
01:19:44,634 --> 01:19:46,029
Yes, sir. I understand.

1005
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:53,069
Okay. Let's go. We're good.

1006
01:20:36,738 --> 01:20:37,899
Daddy!

1007
01:20:48,425 --> 01:20:49,895
Daddy!

1008
01:20:50,298 --> 01:20:51,235
Daddy!

1009
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,289
You're a tough bastard.

1010
01:21:55,362 --> 01:21:56,609
And a lucky one.

1011
01:21:57,235 --> 01:21:58,631
Who are you?

1012
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:03,269
I came here with a... With a woman.

1013
01:22:03,379 --> 01:22:05,520
Is she still...

1014
01:22:06,263 --> 01:22:09,417
Who are you? Why have you come here?

1015
01:22:13,867 --> 01:22:15,145
Why do you keep looking at him?

1016
01:22:16,451 --> 01:22:18,401
'Cause he's the one in charge.

1017
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:23,723
You know what this place is?

1018
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:25,899
Of course I do. That's why I'm here.

1019
01:22:25,966 --> 01:22:28,331
Then you understand how this must look to us.

1020
01:22:29,787 --> 01:22:30,841
This

1021
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,086
is important to you?

1022
01:22:34,057 --> 01:22:36,155
- How long have I been out? - Three days.

1023
01:22:36,417 --> 01:22:37,546
Give me the phone.

1024
01:22:37,728 --> 01:22:38,974
Just give me the phone.

1025
01:22:39,226 --> 01:22:41,219
Give me the God damn phone! Give me the phone!

1026
01:22:41,286 --> 01:22:43,012
As soon as you answer my question.

1027
01:22:44,732 --> 01:22:45,820
Call it.

1028
01:22:46,755 --> 01:22:48,929
Call the number, they'll tell you who I am. Call it.

1029
01:22:59,416 --> 01:23:00,396
Gerry?

1030
01:23:00,802 --> 01:23:02,869
- Yeah, I'm here. I'm here. - My God.

1031
01:23:03,424 --> 01:23:04,852
We thought you were dead.

1032
01:23:04,997 --> 01:23:06,244
Gerry, where are you?

1033
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:08,488
Thierry, I'm with a couple of nervous gentlemen.

1034
01:23:08,556 --> 01:23:10,026
They need some bona fides before I can speak with you.

1035
01:23:10,129 --> 01:23:11,109
Of course.

1036
01:23:11,665 --> 01:23:13,210
This is Thieny Umutoni.

1037
01:23:13,912 --> 01:23:15,937
Deputy Secretary-General. United Nations.

1038
01:23:16,272 --> 01:23:17,849
To whom am I speaking?

1039
01:23:18,145 --> 01:23:19,157
Where's Karin?

1040
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,155
Thierry, why didn't Karin answer?

1041
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:28,147
I'm sorry, Gerry.

1042
01:23:28,558 --> 01:23:29,805
I did what I could.

1043
01:23:32,117 --> 01:23:33,321
What does that mean?

1044
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:35,010
You've got to calm down. No, stop! Stop.

1045
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:36,621
You're going to hurt yourself.

1046
01:23:54,255 --> 01:23:55,192
You're okay.

1047
01:23:57,476 --> 01:24:00,289
His family has been sent to a refugee camp in Nova Scotia.

1048
01:24:01,184 --> 01:24:02,836
I'm sure they'll be safe.

1049
01:24:03,095 --> 01:24:06,770
Are you? Thierry told you who I am and what I used to do, right?

1050
01:24:06,915 --> 01:24:07,853
Yeah.

1051
01:24:07,927 --> 01:24:10,025
Then trust me when I tell you they're not safe.

1052
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:13,893
I understand how you feel.

1053
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:15,573
- Do you? Yes? - Yes.

1054
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:17,376
Do you have a family?

1055
01:24:18,378 --> 01:24:19,656
- No. - No.

1056
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:22,546
Then you couldn't possibly understand, could you?

1057
01:24:23,247 --> 01:24:25,464
I lost my son and wife in Rome.

1058
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:29,653
Rather, I lost my son to

1059
01:24:31,263 --> 01:24:33,927
something that had once been my wife.

1060
01:24:37,069 --> 01:24:39,243
We have all lost someone, Mr. Lane.

1061
01:24:40,291 --> 01:24:42,283
In your case, there is hope at least.

1062
01:24:42,351 --> 01:24:43,597
I'm sorry.

1063
01:24:45,347 --> 01:24:46,402
I'm sorry.

1064
01:24:46,471 --> 01:24:47,718
Now,

1065
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,338
why did you come here?

1066
01:24:51,266 --> 01:24:53,216
What do you need from us?

1067
01:24:53,963 --> 01:24:55,465
Your worst disease.

1068
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:00,716
He wants a what?

1069
01:25:00,818 --> 01:25:02,213
Deadly pathogen.

1070
01:25:02,691 --> 01:25:04,343
With a high mortality rate.

1071
01:25:05,013 --> 01:25:07,304
- But curable. - Okay, well...

1072
01:25:07,373 --> 01:25:09,589
You'd want a bacteria rather than a virus,

1073
01:25:09,658 --> 01:25:10,862
I would think. Typhus?

1074
01:25:11,568 --> 01:25:12,996
Meningitis. Scarlet Fever.

1075
01:25:13,067 --> 01:25:14,154
Rocky Mountain Fever.

1076
01:25:14,715 --> 01:25:16,888
Anyway, excuse me, what's this for?

1077
01:25:17,149 --> 01:25:20,751
Mr. Lane believes we can use such a disease against the undead.

1078
01:25:22,131 --> 01:25:24,230
I would give you points for originality, Mr. Lane,

1079
01:25:24,304 --> 01:25:26,105
if we hadn't already tried that, first thing.

1080
01:25:26,214 --> 01:25:31,574
One of the many things a virus or bacteria needs to thrive is a live host.

1081
01:25:31,683 --> 01:25:33,036
A functioning circulatory system.

1082
01:25:33,144 --> 01:25:35,137
I'm afraid it boils down to one simple fact...

1083
01:25:35,204 --> 01:25:36,781
You can't make a dead person sick.

1084
01:25:38,163 --> 01:25:39,592
It's not for them.

1085
01:25:40,299 --> 01:25:41,694
It's for us.

1086
01:25:43,295 --> 01:25:45,544
I believe these things have a weakness.

1087
01:25:46,217 --> 01:25:48,018
And that weakness is weakness.

1088
01:25:48,502 --> 01:25:49,748
Our weakness.

1089
01:25:50,113 --> 01:25:52,361
I have witnessed them literally bypass people.

1090
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:55,024
Walk right around them like a river around a rock. Why?

1091
01:25:55,806 --> 01:25:57,948
I think, because those people were sick.

1092
01:25:58,466 --> 01:25:59,712
I think they were terminal.

1093
01:25:59,777 --> 01:26:01,098
And these things could sense it.

1094
01:26:01,425 --> 01:26:03,375
I think they're spreading a pathogen,

1095
01:26:03,448 --> 01:26:05,067
and they need a healthy host.

1096
01:26:05,283 --> 01:26:07,276
But even if you're right, I mean, infecting the populace

1097
01:26:07,343 --> 01:26:09,410
with a lethal illness is not exactly a cure.

1098
01:26:09,853 --> 01:26:12,175
It's not a cure. It's camouflage.

1099
01:26:15,547 --> 01:26:16,825
It's camouflage.

1100
01:26:21,053 --> 01:26:22,822
There's a natural precedent.

1101
01:26:23,001 --> 01:26:26,304
Hungry predators will avoid diseased bodies.

1102
01:26:26,709 --> 01:26:29,150
Equipped with the right pathogen, our troops

1103
01:26:29,219 --> 01:26:31,361
would be essentially invisible to the enemy.

1104
01:26:32,365 --> 01:26:35,178
You understand the only way to prove this theory of yours is

1105
01:26:35,662 --> 01:26:36,983
for some idiot to infect themselves

1106
01:26:37,048 --> 01:26:38,891
with a lethal pathogen and then...

1107
01:26:39,969 --> 01:26:42,676
...meet with her, face to face.

1108
01:26:45,775 --> 01:26:46,830
Yes.

1109
01:26:47,461 --> 01:26:49,411
Do we have what we need to try it?

1110
01:26:49,484 --> 01:26:50,645
We have all he could want.

1111
01:26:51,319 --> 01:26:53,760
Typhus, I-II N1, SARS.

1112
01:26:54,353 --> 01:26:55,898
The problem is,

1113
01:26:55,964 --> 01:26:57,882
they're all stored in B-Wing.

1114
01:26:58,773 --> 01:27:00,392
What's the matter with B-Wing?

1115
01:27:01,807 --> 01:27:04,695
Dr. Spellman. Our chief vaccinologist.

1116
01:27:05,965 --> 01:27:08,555
Within hours of the outbreak, he'd been sent blood samples

1117
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:10,692
to try and isolate the pathogenic cause.

1118
01:27:14,318 --> 01:27:15,714
Unfortunately...

1119
01:27:19,975 --> 01:27:21,221
This is B-Wing now.

1120
01:27:27,728 --> 01:27:29,423
God damn it.

1121
01:27:33,385 --> 01:27:34,589
How many?

1122
01:27:35,407 --> 01:27:36,495
How many are there?

1123
01:27:36,569 --> 01:27:38,294
There were 80 people working there.

1124
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:44,368
I've never seen them move like that.

1125
01:27:44,435 --> 01:27:45,639
They're dormant.

1126
01:27:46,083 --> 01:27:47,958
They're awaiting stimulus.

1127
01:27:49,005 --> 01:27:50,017
NOW, this

1128
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:52,343
is vault 139.

1129
01:27:52,863 --> 01:27:54,557
That's where your samples would be.

1130
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:57,926
This is the skybridge.

1131
01:27:59,081 --> 01:28:01,298
That connects B-Wing to the main building here.

1132
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:06,206
And this, is the only thing standing between us and the skybridge.

1133
01:28:06,348 --> 01:28:07,360
So,

1134
01:28:09,045 --> 01:28:10,771
what do you propose, Mr. Lane?

1135
01:28:24,777 --> 01:28:26,322
You are not serious.

1136
01:28:26,388 --> 01:28:29,542
B-Wing's a maze. They'll never make it back alone.

1137
01:28:30,021 --> 01:28:31,747
We don't even know if his theory is correct.

1138
01:28:31,819 --> 01:28:34,558
Well, I know I'm not asking one of you to take him there.

1139
01:28:36,876 --> 01:28:38,453
Each has its merits.

1140
01:28:42,907 --> 01:28:45,272
- Last resort. - It's too loud.

1141
01:28:47,327 --> 01:28:48,413
Let's go.

1142
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:51,897
Try not to kill one.

1143
01:28:53,576 --> 01:28:56,684
It only makes the rest of them more aggressive.

1144
01:28:57,693 --> 01:28:58,779
Yeah.

1145
01:29:14,795 --> 01:29:16,147
You sure you want to do this?

1146
01:29:16,853 --> 01:29:18,844
Of course I'm not. Let's go.

1147
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:20,596
Good luck.

1148
01:29:21,867 --> 01:29:23,411
See you all shortly.

1149
01:29:28,117 --> 01:29:29,320
Good luck.

1150
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:36,211
If anything comes down this hall before we do, you seal these doors for good.

1151
01:29:36,425 --> 01:29:38,266
- Understood? - Okay.

1152
01:31:55,484 --> 01:31:56,761
There they are.

1153
01:32:34,104 --> 01:32:35,040
Go, go.

1154
01:32:49,746 --> 01:32:50,874
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

1155
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,366
Come on!

1156
01:33:13,846 --> 01:33:15,645
They're fine. They're fine.

1157
01:33:47,713 --> 01:33:48,958
Shit.

1158
01:34:10,839 --> 01:34:12,904
The vault we need is in 139.

1159
01:34:47,214 --> 01:34:48,300
Go!

1160
01:34:52,527 --> 01:34:53,772
Oh, my God.

1161
01:34:59,712 --> 01:35:01,106
Left, left, left!

1162
01:35:02,706 --> 01:35:03,951
What are you doing?

1163
01:35:04,278 --> 01:35:05,672
She'll get you to the vault.

1164
01:36:17,812 --> 01:36:19,015
That's the vault.

1165
01:36:19,084 --> 01:36:20,329
- We can make it. - No, we can't.

1166
01:36:22,452 --> 01:36:23,996
We can't make it. Let's go!

1167
01:36:47,937 --> 01:36:48,917
They're not gonna make it.

1168
01:36:48,985 --> 01:36:50,485
You heard what Javi said, we cannot open it.

1169
01:36:50,556 --> 01:36:51,833
They're not alone, we can't open it!

1170
01:36:51,903 --> 01:36:53,180
They are coming back!

1171
01:36:55,084 --> 01:36:56,808
We can't leave them there.

1172
01:36:57,217 --> 01:36:58,270
Come on!

1173
01:37:00,847 --> 01:37:02,241
Open the door!

1174
01:37:04,552 --> 01:37:05,872
- Run! - Run!

1175
01:37:06,011 --> 01:37:08,374
Run! Faster, come on!

1176
01:37:08,556 --> 01:37:09,568
Run!

1177
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:12,084
In, in, in!

1178
01:37:18,024 --> 01:37:19,301
Come on!

1179
01:37:20,045 --> 01:37:21,769
Now where is Gerry?

1180
01:37:23,749 --> 01:37:25,964
Where is he, where is he, where is he?

1181
01:37:27,305 --> 01:37:29,370
Come on, come on, where are you?

1182
01:38:38,257 --> 01:38:39,907
5-6-9-6-4.

1183
01:38:41,175 --> 01:38:43,315
5-6-9-6-4.

1184
01:39:10,402 --> 01:39:11,829
What happened to Gerry?

1185
01:39:24,922 --> 01:39:27,242
Not that one. Not that one.

1186
01:39:54,710 --> 01:39:55,763
Oh, shit!

1187
01:39:55,832 --> 01:39:56,843
Shit!

1188
01:40:17,874 --> 01:40:18,960
Jesus.

1189
01:40:19,670 --> 01:40:21,246
He's going to inject himself.

1190
01:40:27,079 --> 01:40:28,952
We have no idea which one's going to work.

1191
01:40:29,025 --> 01:40:31,240
We don't know if any of them will work.

1192
01:40:31,795 --> 01:40:34,083
If he uses anything he took from that left case,

1193
01:40:34,863 --> 01:40:36,257
he's dead anyway.

1194
01:41:00,273 --> 01:41:01,700
What's he doing?

1195
01:41:49,408 --> 01:41:51,132
How long does he have to wait?

1196
01:41:51,578 --> 01:41:53,942
Before he's infected? Not long, but,

1197
01:41:54,011 --> 01:41:56,491
that's not the question we're really asking, is it?

1198
01:43:40,326 --> 01:43:41,571
Look at them.

1199
01:44:01,357 --> 01:44:02,858
He just walked right past him!

1200
01:44:08,393 --> 01:44:09,638
He walked right past him!

1201
01:44:10,376 --> 01:44:11,653
Like it was nobody!

1202
01:45:17,661 --> 01:45:18,747
Okay.

1203
01:46:03,765 --> 01:46:05,309
This isn't the end.

1204
01:46:14,467 --> 01:46:15,671
Not even close.

1205
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:17,805
Hi, there. This is...

1206
01:46:17,873 --> 01:46:19,373
This is Amy. Is anyone out there?

1207
01:46:19,444 --> 01:46:21,168
Hello. I'm trying to get in contact with anyone.

1208
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:23,188
We've had some luck finding people with this transmission.

1209
01:46:23,261 --> 01:46:24,762
We've lost entire cities.

1210
01:46:24,833 --> 01:46:27,004
When there's no more people left to infect,

1211
01:46:27,078 --> 01:46:29,101
they go dormant. Whole cities are lost.

1212
01:46:29,174 --> 01:46:30,649
The World Health Organization

1213
01:46:30,718 --> 01:46:32,602
reports today that help may soon...

1214
01:46:32,673 --> 01:46:34,669
...a hybridized meningitis strain

1215
01:46:34,747 --> 01:46:37,062
with components of smallpox and H 1N 1.

1216
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:38,827
We still don't know how it started.

1217
01:46:39,063 --> 01:46:40,554
The World Health Organization has created

1218
01:46:40,624 --> 01:46:43,517
a vaccine that works as a kind of camouflage,

1219
01:46:43,587 --> 01:46:47,072
making people who receive it invisible to the infected.

1220
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:48,599
We bought ourselves some time.

1221
01:46:48,673 --> 01:46:51,126
Volunteer forces are delivering the vaccine

1222
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:53,208
to areas that have been cordoned off.

1223
01:46:53,286 --> 01:46:56,058
Distribution efforts began in earnest on April 10th...

1224
01:46:56,134 --> 01:46:57,502
The importance of getting the information

1225
01:46:57,618 --> 01:46:59,751
out to those still alive within the quarantine...

1226
01:47:00,706 --> 01:47:02,389
But it's given us a chance.

1227
01:47:18,815 --> 01:47:20,657
If you can get to a colder area,

1228
01:47:20,734 --> 01:47:22,701
to higher ground, they move slower on the ground.

1229
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:25,741
The Battle of Moscow is still raging.

1230
01:47:26,051 --> 01:47:30,689
Initial tests on the so-called camouflage have been largely successful.

1231
01:47:35,563 --> 01:47:37,883
Others have found a way to push back.

1232
01:47:38,721 --> 01:47:42,165
Move, move! All right, juice 'em up!

1233
01:47:50,831 --> 01:47:53,150
Approaching target. Permission to engage.

1234
01:47:53,509 --> 01:47:54,857
Permission granted.

1235
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:57,436
All clear. Light'em up. Light'em up.

1236
01:47:59,098 --> 01:48:00,399
It's permanent!

1237
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:03,698
It's settled, it's settled! It's over with!

1238
01:48:03,769 --> 01:48:05,766
There's no forgiveness in hell!

1239
01:48:05,924 --> 01:48:09,477
Whatever goes to hell, stays in hell!

1240
01:48:09,835 --> 01:48:12,957
This is Station 7 in Nebraska, broadcasting on the shortwave band.

1241
01:48:13,028 --> 01:48:15,670
If you can fight, fight.

1242
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:16,911
Head north if you can.

1243
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:19,965
Hello? Is there anyone out there hearing this?

1244
01:48:20,035 --> 01:48:21,337
Help each other.

1245
01:48:21,412 --> 01:48:24,306
Mexico City has been declared a complete loss.

1246
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:35,216
Be prepared for anything.

1247
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:42,840
Our war has just begun.

1248
01:48:45,841 --> 01:48:50,841
