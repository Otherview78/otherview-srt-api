1
00:01:01,453 --> 00:01:04,373
Five, four, three...

2
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,167
...two, one.

3
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,794
Ready or not, here I come.

4
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,496
Hey, Dad?

5
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:28,707
Dad!

6
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:33,063
<i>You'll stay with Aunt May...</i>

7
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,024
...and Uncle Ben for a little while.

8
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,359
- I wanna go with you.
- No.

9
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:43,866
Doesn't like crust
on his sandwiches...

10
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,285
...and he likes to sleep
with a little light on.

11
00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:48,579
- Mary. Come on, come on.
- Oh, God.

12
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,293
Dad.

13
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:56,837
Be good.

14
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:15,439
Sorry.

15
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,441
Morning, Flash.

16
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:22,488
Good morning, Parker.

17
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,829
Hey. It's Peter, right?

18
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:34,083
I really like your photos.

19
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:35,876
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

20
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:37,002
Listen...

21
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:38,504
...are you busy Friday night?

22
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:47,012
Cool. Can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

23
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:49,181
You know, I really wanna frame
a good one...

24
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:50,432
...for his birthday.

25
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:53,686
That's really nice of you.
Wow, that's such a nice thought.

26
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:56,188
Yeah, I'll have a look at the old...

27
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:58,107
- The old schedule.
- Okay.

28
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:00,401
Parker.

29
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:02,611
- Yes, sir?
- You want to keep that skateboard?

30
00:05:02,778 --> 00:05:04,279
- Yeah.
- Keep it off the ground.

31
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:05,781
- Sure. Yeah.
- Wheels up.

32
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:07,074
Like that?

33
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,951
- That's it.
- Okay.

34
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:36,478
<i>Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!</i>

35
00:05:36,645 --> 00:05:38,022
<i>Eat it! Eat it!</i>

36
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:40,733
<i>Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!</i>

37
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:43,318
Eat your vegetables, Gordon.
Come on!

38
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:44,945
Come on!

39
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,280
Hey, Parker, come on.

40
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,823
Get a picture of this.

41
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,160
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.

42
00:05:51,326 --> 00:05:53,287
- Come on.
- Gordon, don't eat it.

43
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,496
Take the picture.

44
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:56,123
Put him down, Flash.

45
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,875
Take the picture.

46
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:00,627
Put him down, Eugene!

47
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:05,007
Hey, man.

48
00:06:06,842 --> 00:06:07,509
Come on!

49
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:08,343
Get up, Parker!

50
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:11,764
Get up!

51
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,557
Come on! Come on!

52
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:14,391
Get up!

53
00:06:17,353 --> 00:06:18,687
Still not taking the picture.

54
00:06:19,188 --> 00:06:20,522
Stay down, Parker!

55
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:22,524
Who wants one more?

56
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:24,276
- One more!
- Flash!

57
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:26,153
Flash...

58
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,197
...we still on for after school today?

59
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:29,490
My house, 3:30?

60
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,866
I hope you did homework.

61
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:32,534
Last time, I was...

62
00:06:33,118 --> 00:06:34,328
...disappointed in you.

63
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,580
- Okay, move.
- No, how about we go to class?

64
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:37,956
How about it?

65
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:42,336
Whatever.

66
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:09,321
I thought that was great
what you did.

67
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:11,323
It was stupid...

68
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:13,075
...but it was great.

69
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:14,952
You should go to...

70
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,870
...the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

71
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:19,915
What's your name?

72
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:21,583
You don't know my name?

73
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:23,752
No, I know your name.

74
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:25,629
I want to know
if you know your name.

75
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,924
Peter.

76
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:32,177
- Parker. Peter Parker.
- Okay. Okay, good.

77
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:41,437
I'd still go to the nurse though.

78
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:42,855
You're Gwen, right?

79
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:44,231
Gwen Stacy.

80
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:46,233
All right.

81
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:49,153
Hey.

82
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,237
I'm making...

83
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:52,114
...spaghetti and meatballs tonight.

84
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:54,950
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.

85
00:07:55,117 --> 00:07:58,829
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

86
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:01,040
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

87
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:02,750
What happened to your face?

88
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,294
I'm all right. Just-- I fell, skating.

89
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:07,046
It's all right.

90
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:09,757
Ben Parker, don't you even...

91
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,885
...think about leaving
that filthy box in my kitchen.

92
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:14,094
My bowling trophies.

93
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:15,804
Oh, well, then, by all means...

94
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:17,473
...leave that box in my kitchen.

95
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,099
- What happened to you?
- He fell.

96
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:22,061
Why you kids ride those things,
I'll never know.

97
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:23,812
Because it's stupid and dangerous.

98
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:25,606
Remember when we were stupid?

99
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:26,774
No.

100
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,068
- Trust me, we were.
- All right. Good to know.

101
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:30,152
Where's the flood?

102
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,820
Follow me. I'll show you.

103
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:33,197
- You serious?
- Yes.

104
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:34,990
All right.

105
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,826
<i>It's the condenser tray.</i>

106
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:41,580
Too much water for the condenser tray
or the heat exchange tubing.

107
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:43,665
This has got to be the fill line.

108
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:46,210
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

109
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:47,711
Can you fix it?

110
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:51,131
No, not tonight.
I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.

111
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,717
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

112
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:57,429
How's the other guy look?

113
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:02,142
Come on.
I know a right cross when I see one.

114
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:06,105
Yes or no?
Do I have to call somebody's father?

115
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:07,564
No, no.

116
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:08,816
All right.

117
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,068
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

118
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,530
I pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.

119
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,783
Before you come up, see if...

120
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,369
...there's anything else worth saving.
- Okay.

121
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:39,513
- Plumbers don't fix appliances.
- Yes, they do.

122
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,265
They fix pipes and pump things.

123
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:43,267
If you ask them to--

124
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:50,232
I forgot all about that thing.

125
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,275
It was your dad's.

126
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:53,277
- Yeah.
- He asked us to keep it safe.

127
00:09:57,322 --> 00:10:00,701
He saw it in the window of that
leather shop over on 9th Avenue.

128
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:04,538
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old kid
need with a briefcase?

129
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:06,498
And guess who sold it to him.

130
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:08,333
- I don't know.
- Your mother.

131
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,585
That's how they met.

132
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:11,545
He asked you to...

133
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,672
...keep this safe?
There's nothing in here.

134
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,591
Have you looked?
There's nothing here.

135
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,885
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.

136
00:10:19,094 --> 00:10:20,554
Yeah, I know.

137
00:10:26,602 --> 00:10:27,561
Who's that?

138
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,271
Do you know who that is?

139
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,773
Some guy who worked with...

140
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:32,066
...your dad, I guess.

141
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:38,864
Just take this off the table, all right?

142
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:42,076
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.

143
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,119
- Now.
- All right.

144
00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:45,287
Go on.

145
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,533
<i>I need you to be a good boy.</i>

146
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,826
Where are you going?

147
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:25,160
There's something...

148
00:11:25,327 --> 00:11:27,329
...your mom and I have to do.

149
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:25,721
What is this?

150
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,851
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."

151
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,272
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

152
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,074
Come in.

153
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:46,575
You okay?

154
00:12:46,742 --> 00:12:49,078
- Yeah. What's up?
- Oh, my God.

155
00:12:49,244 --> 00:12:50,537
You look just like him.

156
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:53,499
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

157
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,838
Listen...

158
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:01,465
...I don't have much education.

159
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:03,092
You know that, Peter.

160
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,929
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

161
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,681
What I'm trying to say is...

162
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,601
...I know it's been rough
for you without your dad.

163
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,937
And I know we don't talk
much about them.

164
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:17,022
- Yeah, it's all right.
- No, it is not...

165
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:18,565
...all right.

166
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:22,236
I wish I could change it, but I can't.

167
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:25,489
Curt Connors.

168
00:13:26,115 --> 00:13:28,909
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

169
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,412
They worked together for years
and they were close.

170
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,956
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

171
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,083
He never even called.

172
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,459
Not once.

173
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:41,588
Go figure.

174
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:46,176
She's pretty.

175
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:52,641
Uncle Ben.

176
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:54,059
What?

177
00:13:54,643 --> 00:13:56,145
You're a pretty great dad.

178
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:53,494
Excuse me.

179
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,453
What?

180
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,205
Can I help you?

181
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:58,040
I don't know. I'm here to see...

182
00:14:58,207 --> 00:14:59,666
...Dr. Connors.
- Right.

183
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,710
You'll find yourself to the left.

184
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:05,297
You are here for the internship?

185
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:07,549
Yeah. Yeah.

186
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:08,801
Okay.

187
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:10,844
You'll find your badge to the left.

188
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:17,726
Having trouble finding yourself?

189
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:19,395
No. Yeah, I got it.

190
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,731
Okay...

191
00:15:22,898 --> 00:15:24,775
...Mr. Guevara.

192
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:30,030
<i>Welcome to Oscorp.</i>

193
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:33,033
<i>Born from the mind of our founder,
Norman Osborn...</i>

194
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,870
<i>...the Oscorp Tower houses
108 floors of innovation.</i>

195
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:42,042
<i>Our scientific minds are pushing the
boundaries of defence, biomedical...</i>

196
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:45,003
<i>...and chemical technologies.
The future lies within.</i>

197
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,463
Welcome to Oscorp.

198
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,923
I'm Gwen Stacy, a senior...

199
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:48,966
...at Midtown Science...

200
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:50,551
...and head intern to Dr. Connors.

201
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:52,886
I'll be with you
for the duration of your visit.

202
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:54,722
Where I go, you go.

203
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,598
That's the rule. Remember that...

204
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:58,225
...all will be fine.
- Come on!

205
00:15:58,392 --> 00:15:59,768
- If you forget that--
- Listen!

206
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:00,853
Look, listen.

207
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,604
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here.

208
00:16:02,771 --> 00:16:03,856
Just tell them...

209
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:05,065
...Rodrigo Guevara is here!

210
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:06,400
My name's Rodrigo!

211
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:09,403
I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget.

212
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:10,946
Shall we?

213
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:20,581
Come around this way.

214
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:25,961
Good afternoon, Gwen.

215
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:27,087
Dr. Connors.

216
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,006
Welcome.

217
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:31,967
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

218
00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:34,386
Yes, in case you're wondering,
I'm a southpaw.

219
00:16:34,553 --> 00:16:35,804
I'm not a cripple...

220
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:39,308
...I'm a scientist, and the world's
foremost authority on herpetology.

221
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:42,227
That's reptiles,
for those of you who don't know.

222
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:43,854
Like the Parkinson's patient...

223
00:16:44,021 --> 00:16:46,732
...who watches on in horror
as her body...

224
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:50,319
...slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration...

225
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:54,323
...whose eyes grow dimmer each day,
I long to fix myself.

226
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,327
I want to create a world
without weakness.

227
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:01,455
Anyone care to venture a guess
just how?

228
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:02,831
Yes.

229
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:03,957
Stem cells?

230
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,709
Promising. But the solution...

231
00:17:05,876 --> 00:17:08,670
...I'm thinking of is more radical.

232
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:12,508
- No one?
- Cross-species genetics.

233
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:21,975
Person gets Parkinson's...

234
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,520
...when the brain cells
that produce dopamine...

235
00:17:24,687 --> 00:17:26,689
...start to disappear.

236
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:28,524
But a zebra fish has the ability...

237
00:17:28,691 --> 00:17:30,901
...to regenerate cells on command.

238
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,986
If you could give this ability...

239
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:36,031
...to the woman you're talking about,
that's that. She's...

240
00:17:37,074 --> 00:17:38,409
She's curing herself.

241
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:41,453
Yeah, you just have to look past
the gills on her neck.

242
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,208
And you are...?

243
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:50,254
He's one of Midtown Science's...

244
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:51,922
...best and brightest.
- Really?

245
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:53,090
Second in his class.

246
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,051
- Second?
- Yeah.

247
00:17:56,218 --> 00:17:57,052
Sure about that?

248
00:17:57,219 --> 00:17:58,679
I'm pretty sure.

249
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:06,061
I'm afraid duty calls. I'll leave you in the
more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

250
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:08,105
Nice meeting you all.

251
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:12,735
If you'd like to gather round.

252
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:14,903
<i>Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.</i>

253
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:18,490
<i>Our planet's tree of life is immense.</i>

254
00:18:19,116 --> 00:18:20,200
<i>At Oscorp's...</i>

255
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,077
<i>-...Cross-Species Division...
- Hi.</i>

256
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:25,247
<i>...we endeavour to explore
exciting new methods...</i>

257
00:18:26,665 --> 00:18:27,875
What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?

258
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:32,171
Oh, yeah.

259
00:18:32,337 --> 00:18:33,589
What are you doing here?

260
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:34,923
I work here. I don't.

261
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,675
I was gonna say I work here...

262
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:40,054
...but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that I don't.

263
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,096
You following me?

264
00:18:41,263 --> 00:18:44,391
No, I'm not following you, no.
I had no idea you worked here.

265
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:45,768
Why would you be here?

266
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:47,770
I just snuck in because...

267
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:49,355
I love science.

268
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:51,315
- You love it.
- I'm passionate about it.

269
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:53,108
So you snuck in--?

270
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:55,444
- I have to lead this tour group.
- I know.

271
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:58,530
I'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.

272
00:18:58,697 --> 00:19:00,949
- I promise you I won't.
- Stay with the group.

273
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:05,079
All right, guys? I'm gonna take you
to the bioreactor room now.

274
00:19:08,874 --> 00:19:10,376
Sorry. Yo.

275
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:12,878
Sorry.

276
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:39,900
We received the results from
the mRNA sequences this morning.

277
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:42,861
They were disappointing.

278
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:49,785
Define "disappointing."

279
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,286
Another dead end.

280
00:21:51,453 --> 00:21:53,122
It's the decay rate algorithm.

281
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,791
- And this is to be expected.
- Expected?

282
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,292
You said you were close.

283
00:21:57,459 --> 00:21:59,628
We are close,
but it's gonna take time.

284
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:01,004
He doesn't have time.

285
00:22:01,171 --> 00:22:03,465
Norman Osborn is dying,
Dr. Connors.

286
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:05,259
Save him.

287
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:09,430
Or we'll both lose our heads.

288
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:29,283
All right, give me the badge.

289
00:22:31,493 --> 00:22:32,828
Give it to me.

290
00:22:36,498 --> 00:22:37,875
Sorry.

291
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:41,146
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.

292
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:43,899
I didn't mean to do that.

293
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:45,484
I didn't mean to...

294
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:47,403
ldidn't-- I didn't--

295
00:23:48,737 --> 00:23:49,905
Get your hand off her!

296
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:51,740
I'm trying to get my...

297
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:56,328
Are you kidding?

298
00:23:56,495 --> 00:23:57,287
I'm sorry.

299
00:23:57,454 --> 00:23:58,664
Are you kidding me?

300
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:00,958
- Hey, get him, Rudy!
- Hey!

301
00:24:04,253 --> 00:24:05,421
Ma". I'm sorry!

302
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:06,672
Man, are you all right?

303
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:11,135
- Take him down!
- Come on.

304
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:15,347
Get him, man! Get him!

305
00:24:18,142 --> 00:24:19,393
No, man, no. Not my board.

306
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,853
Please, dude, don't--

307
00:24:22,771 --> 00:24:23,856
Sorry!

308
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,819
Sorry. Sorry.

309
00:24:28,986 --> 00:24:30,279
I'm so sorry.

310
00:24:34,283 --> 00:24:36,785
<i>Coney Island, next stop.</i>

311
00:24:36,952 --> 00:24:38,912
<i>Next and final stop, Coney Island.</i>

312
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:51,592
Hey.

313
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,094
Hey. HEY-

314
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:55,471
Sorry. I'm late.

315
00:24:55,637 --> 00:24:57,306
- I got--
- We've been so worried.

316
00:24:57,473 --> 00:24:58,599
I know. I'm sorry.

317
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:00,100
Watch out!

318
00:25:07,149 --> 00:25:08,359
That's a fly, Peter.

319
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:14,073
Yeah.

320
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,537
I'm so sorry...

321
00:25:20,704 --> 00:25:21,872
...I kept you guys UP-

322
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:25,376
I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible...

323
00:25:25,918 --> 00:25:27,336
...and I'm hungry.

324
00:25:31,757 --> 00:25:33,425
Meatloaf.

325
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:37,179
Drinking?

326
00:25:37,346 --> 00:25:38,389
What's this?

327
00:25:38,555 --> 00:25:39,932
I don't think so.

328
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:41,767
This is your meatloaf.

329
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:46,021
This beats all other meat loafs.

330
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:49,316
Something is very wrong.

331
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:50,984
Yeah.

332
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:53,195
Nobody likes your meatloaf.

333
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:00,869
I got it.

334
00:26:04,373 --> 00:26:06,709
He took the frozen
macaroni and cheese.

335
00:26:07,418 --> 00:26:08,711
I noticed that.

336
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:12,506
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like my meatloaf?

337
00:26:12,756 --> 00:26:14,967
You could have said that to me
37 years ago.

338
00:26:15,134 --> 00:26:17,803
How many meat loafs
have I made for you?

339
00:29:08,974 --> 00:29:09,725
Peter.

340
00:29:11,101 --> 00:29:12,227
What are you doing?

341
00:29:12,394 --> 00:29:13,896
'M...

342
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:15,981
Homework.

343
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:17,691
Be careful.

344
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:19,443
Sure.

345
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:30,079
Dr. Connors.

346
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:33,582
You don't remember me. I--

347
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:35,000
The intern from the other day.

348
00:29:35,584 --> 00:29:37,252
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

349
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:39,713
I'm sure you're very nice,
but this is a home.

350
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,216
I ask you to make an appointment
with my office.

351
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:43,759
I'm Richard Parker's son.

352
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,226
Peter?

353
00:29:54,853 --> 00:29:55,521
I'm afraid...

354
00:29:55,688 --> 00:29:58,982
...I can't help you much. I don't know
why they left or where they...

355
00:29:59,149 --> 00:29:59,900
...were going.

356
00:30:02,695 --> 00:30:04,154
Good reflexes.

357
00:30:04,321 --> 00:30:05,698
Thank you.

358
00:30:10,703 --> 00:30:12,788
- Thank you.
- I read your book.

359
00:30:12,955 --> 00:30:14,415
Yeah.

360
00:30:14,581 --> 00:30:15,749
It's something, you know.

361
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:17,710
So you really think...

362
00:30:17,876 --> 00:30:20,587
...it's possible, cross-species genetics?
- Yes, of course.

363
00:30:20,754 --> 00:30:23,215
Your father and I
were mocked for our theories.

364
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:26,135
Not just in the community at large,
but at Oscorp, as well.

365
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:28,429
They called us mad scientists.

366
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:31,932
And then your father
bred the spiders...

367
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:33,475
...and everything changed.

368
00:30:33,642 --> 00:30:35,310
The results were
beyond encouraging.

369
00:30:35,477 --> 00:30:37,438
They were spectacular.

370
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:42,568
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.

371
00:30:42,735 --> 00:30:44,695
Including my own.

372
00:30:45,195 --> 00:30:46,780
Then it was over.

373
00:30:47,656 --> 00:30:50,576
He was gone.

374
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:53,245
Took his research with him.

375
00:30:54,329 --> 00:30:56,915
And I knew without him, I...

376
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:06,091
I----

377
00:31:07,676 --> 00:31:09,845
I was angry.

378
00:31:12,598 --> 00:31:14,099
So I stayed away from you...

379
00:31:14,266 --> 00:31:16,185
...and your family.

380
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:18,270
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

381
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:28,280
Say...

382
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:30,032
Say it worked.

383
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:32,368
Say you got it to work.

384
00:31:32,868 --> 00:31:36,830
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

385
00:31:37,706 --> 00:31:39,875
What could the side effects be?

386
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:46,673
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

387
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:48,467
The problem was always--

388
00:31:48,634 --> 00:31:50,052
The decay rate algorithm?

389
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:54,515
- Right.
- Right.

390
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:57,059
Can I...?

391
00:31:57,226 --> 00:31:58,894
Of course.

392
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:22,751
Extraordinary.

393
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:25,212
How did you come up with this?

394
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:34,513
Peter, how about coming
to see me at the Tower...

395
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,598
...one day after school?
- Yeah.

396
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:40,561
Thank you.

397
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:02,207
Number one, Reggie.

398
00:33:02,374 --> 00:33:03,292
Run it, buddy.

399
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:05,002
Let's go. Reggie-

400
00:33:08,422 --> 00:33:09,173
Rejected!

401
00:33:11,842 --> 00:33:13,552
You did that on purpose, Flash!

402
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:15,804
I should've.
You better watch your back.

403
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:21,435
Hey.

404
00:33:23,312 --> 00:33:24,271
All right?

405
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:31,820
Give it up.

406
00:33:37,326 --> 00:33:38,410
Come on, man.

407
00:33:40,329 --> 00:33:41,330
One sec.

408
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:47,127
- Come on, man.
- Why don't you take it from me?

409
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,549
That's right. Take it.

410
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:54,343
Go ahead. Take it.

411
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:16,156
Just take it.

412
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:20,703
All right, how about this?

413
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:22,538
All right?

414
00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:23,622
How about that?

415
00:34:27,876 --> 00:34:30,003
- Come on, Flash.
- Flash, stop playing, man.

416
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,297
- Take it from him!
- Come on, Flash. Take it.

417
00:34:32,464 --> 00:34:33,799
Yo, Flash, let's go.

418
00:34:33,966 --> 00:34:35,467
- Let's go!
- Do it, Flash.

419
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:37,386
- Stop playing, man.
- Let's go, Flash.

420
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:39,221
- What are you doing?
- What's up?

421
00:34:40,973 --> 00:34:41,765
What you doing?

422
00:34:44,768 --> 00:34:46,895
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!

423
00:35:00,409 --> 00:35:02,077
Peter's behaviour is just...

424
00:35:02,244 --> 00:35:03,037
...unacceptable.

425
00:35:03,203 --> 00:35:04,079
<i>They won't make us pay...</i>

426
00:35:04,246 --> 00:35:07,082
-...for the backboard.
- I don't care about the backboard.

427
00:35:07,249 --> 00:35:08,959
- Was that true?
- What?

428
00:35:09,126 --> 00:35:10,919
What I heard in there just now.

429
00:35:11,086 --> 00:35:14,048
Did you humiliate that boy?

430
00:35:14,923 --> 00:35:16,091
Yeah, I did.

431
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:18,260
- But--
- But what?

432
00:35:18,427 --> 00:35:19,887
- This guy deserved it.
- Did he?

433
00:35:20,054 --> 00:35:21,764
- Yeah.
- Is he the kid that hit you?

434
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:25,351
Is he?

435
00:35:25,517 --> 00:35:27,353
Yeah, yeah, but...

436
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:29,605
So all this is about getting even.

437
00:35:30,105 --> 00:35:33,609
If so, I guess you must feel pretty good
about yourself now, right?

438
00:35:33,776 --> 00:35:34,777
Am I right or wrong?

439
00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:38,364
Yeah, I thought so.

440
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:41,325
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours...

441
00:35:41,492 --> 00:35:43,452
...I had to change shifts at work...

442
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:47,289
...so you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:00. Understood?

443
00:35:47,831 --> 00:35:49,249
- Is that understood?
- Yeah.

444
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:51,126
Okay, good.

445
00:35:53,462 --> 00:35:54,588
She looks familiar.

446
00:35:57,132 --> 00:35:58,592
The girl on your computer.

447
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:00,427
Yeah.

448
00:36:00,552 --> 00:36:03,555
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.

449
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:05,974
Don't forget Aunt May.

450
00:36:09,728 --> 00:36:11,480
Okay.

451
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:17,069
He's a character.

452
00:36:17,194 --> 00:36:18,237
That's my uncle.

453
00:36:18,404 --> 00:36:20,447
He's a pathological liar.

454
00:36:20,614 --> 00:36:21,990
He thought you were someone else.

455
00:36:22,157 --> 00:36:24,660
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?

456
00:36:24,827 --> 00:36:27,955
I took a photo of the debate team,
and you're in the debate team.

457
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:29,832
- Right.
- So...

458
00:36:29,998 --> 00:36:32,334
...he must have seen--
I was touching up stuff.

459
00:36:33,168 --> 00:36:34,670
- Touching up stuff?
- Come on.

460
00:36:35,337 --> 00:36:37,506
I was... I'm not gonna answer that.

461
00:36:39,591 --> 00:36:42,094
- Did you get expelled?
- No, no.

462
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:44,471
I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.

463
00:36:47,725 --> 00:36:50,728
So you want to-- I don't know...?

464
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:53,022
Want to what?

465
00:36:53,689 --> 00:36:54,898
I don't know.

466
00:36:55,065 --> 00:36:56,775
Just...

467
00:37:02,031 --> 00:37:04,491
I don't know-- We could...

468
00:37:05,534 --> 00:37:07,453
We could do something else,
or we could--

469
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:10,080
- If you don't feel like, we could--
- Yeah.

470
00:37:10,247 --> 00:37:11,790
- Yeah?
- Yeah, either one.

471
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,335
- Really?
- Sure.

472
00:37:16,211 --> 00:37:17,046
Okay.

473
00:37:17,171 --> 00:37:18,547
All right, good. Sounds good.

474
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:19,673
Cool.

475
00:37:20,215 --> 00:37:21,717
Okay.

476
00:37:21,884 --> 00:37:24,219
- I can't right now, I can't right now.
- Yeah, no.

477
00:37:24,386 --> 00:37:26,555
- I'm so busy right now.
- I know, me too.

478
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:31,727
But maybe...

479
00:37:31,894 --> 00:37:34,063
- Yeah, just, you know...
- Some other...

480
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:35,898
- Time, all right.
- Okay.

481
00:37:36,065 --> 00:37:37,733
- Bye.
- All right.

482
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:08,365
We have protein structure, rDNA...

483
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:10,617
...chromatography,
transgenics testing...

484
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:14,038
...that's X-ray video. That's the only
one on the planet. We have...

485
00:39:14,455 --> 00:39:16,999
- Human line testing over--
- I remember that.

486
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:18,834
I've seen that before.

487
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:20,294
The Ganali device.

488
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:23,172
Yeah, I remember a picture of that
in my dad's office.

489
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:25,841
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

490
00:39:25,966 --> 00:39:29,470
It creates a cloud which can be dispersed
over a neighbourhood, even a city.

491
00:39:29,595 --> 00:39:33,015
Theoretically, you could
cure polio in an afternoon.

492
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,184
That's incredible.

493
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:38,604
Well, others disagreed. What if
the device were loaded with a toxin?

494
00:39:38,771 --> 00:39:40,773
What if you wanted to opt out?
You can't...

495
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:44,360
...run away from a cloud after all,
so here it lies, gathering dust.

496
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:47,821
What you see here
is a computer model of a lizard.

497
00:39:47,988 --> 00:39:51,200
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted...

498
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:53,869
...that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

499
00:39:54,036 --> 00:39:55,871
You can imagine my envy.

500
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:57,956
We're trying to harness
this capability...

501
00:39:58,123 --> 00:40:00,376
...and transfer it
into our host subject:

502
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:02,795
Freddy the three-legged mouse.

503
00:40:03,837 --> 00:40:06,006
Enter the algorithm now.

504
00:40:09,218 --> 00:40:10,177
Need to take that?

505
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:16,975
<i>System ready...</i>

506
00:40:17,142 --> 00:40:18,727
<i>...for gene insertion.</i>

507
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:20,521
Okay.

508
00:40:21,063 --> 00:40:22,439
Check.

509
00:40:24,316 --> 00:40:25,526
See what I'm trying to do?

510
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:27,569
- Preempt the proteins.
- The immune response.

511
00:40:27,736 --> 00:40:28,904
<i>Beginning trials.</i>

525
00:40:58,726 --> 00:41:00,602
And thank you.

526
00:41:01,478 --> 00:41:02,479
Meet Fred and Wilma...

527
00:41:02,688 --> 00:41:03,939
...our three-legged...

528
00:41:04,106 --> 00:41:05,232
...mice.

529
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:09,361
Here you go.

530
00:41:11,196 --> 00:41:12,865
HEY. buddy. I got you.

531
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:15,492
Okay.

532
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:17,745
Careful, don't want to stick you
by mistake.

533
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:19,788
Human trials aren't until next week.

534
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:23,584
There.

535
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:32,718
Hey.

536
00:41:32,885 --> 00:41:35,262
Hey, I thought you...

537
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:37,347
Didn't you forget something?

538
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,266
What?

539
00:41:39,391 --> 00:41:43,270
Now, don't answer that,
but I'm glad to know it's working.

540
00:41:44,313 --> 00:41:48,233
You owe your aunt
an apology bigtime.

541
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,236
Be a man.

542
00:41:51,362 --> 00:41:53,113
Get in there and apologise.

543
00:41:56,575 --> 00:41:58,077
I'm sorry, Aunt May, I...

544
00:41:58,202 --> 00:41:59,536
Honestly, you don't have...

545
00:41:59,703 --> 00:42:01,288
...to apologise to me. It's your--

546
00:42:01,455 --> 00:42:03,248
- The hell he doesn't.
- Ben.

547
00:42:04,124 --> 00:42:06,001
Look, I'm sorry, I got distracted.

548
00:42:06,168 --> 00:42:08,087
- Oh, he got distracted.
- Yeah.

549
00:42:08,253 --> 00:42:11,382
Your aunt, my wife,
had to walk 12 blocks alone...

550
00:42:11,548 --> 00:42:15,010
...in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station...

551
00:42:15,177 --> 00:42:16,428
...because you got distracted.

552
00:42:16,595 --> 00:42:18,263
Ben, sweetheart, honestly...

553
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,474
...I am completely capable
of walking home--

554
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:22,685
You will not defend this boy!

555
00:42:22,851 --> 00:42:24,144
- I'm not defending--
- You are!

556
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:26,814
- Listen to me, son.
- Yeah, go ahead.

557
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,524
You're a lot like your father.

558
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:31,193
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing...

559
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,488
...but your father lived by a philosophy,
a principle, really.

560
00:42:34,655 --> 00:42:37,991
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people...

561
00:42:38,158 --> 00:42:40,619
...you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

562
00:42:40,786 --> 00:42:42,371
That's what's at stake here.

563
00:42:42,496 --> 00:42:43,539
Not choice.

564
00:42:43,706 --> 00:42:45,708
Responsibility.

565
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:50,379
That is nice. That's great.

566
00:42:51,296 --> 00:42:53,507
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

567
00:42:54,383 --> 00:42:56,593
- What?
- Where is he?

568
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:58,721
Where's my dad?

569
00:42:58,887 --> 00:43:02,391
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me himself?

570
00:43:02,558 --> 00:43:03,892
Oh, come on, how dare you?

571
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:05,769
How dare I? How dare you?

572
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:11,400
Where you going?

573
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:13,360
Peter, come back here, please.

574
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:26,040
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He'll be all right.

575
00:43:39,053 --> 00:43:40,054
Peter!

576
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:44,266
Peter?

577
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,273
Peter!

578
00:43:56,362 --> 00:43:57,321
It's $2.07.

579
00:44:00,783 --> 00:44:01,825
It's $2.07.

580
00:44:01,992 --> 00:44:03,327
Yeah. No, I know.

581
00:44:03,494 --> 00:44:06,330
Yeah, you're holding up the line. No.

582
00:44:06,455 --> 00:44:08,791
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

583
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:11,126
- What?
- You can leave...

584
00:44:11,335 --> 00:44:13,962
...a penny anytime,
you have to spend 10 dollars...

585
00:44:14,129 --> 00:44:16,048
...to take a penny.
It's store policy.

586
00:44:16,215 --> 00:44:18,634
- You're holding up my line.
- I don't have 2 cents.

587
00:44:18,801 --> 00:44:20,469
You can't afford milk, step aside.

588
00:44:20,636 --> 00:44:22,888
Daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?

589
00:44:23,055 --> 00:44:24,390
We're talking about 2 cents.

590
00:44:24,556 --> 00:44:25,599
Just step aside, kid.

591
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:33,524
Really?

592
00:44:46,662 --> 00:44:48,288
Yo, not cool, bro.

593
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:52,167
Hey, man, stop!

594
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:53,794
Somebody stop that guy!

595
00:44:53,961 --> 00:44:55,337
Hey, kid, little help?

596
00:44:55,462 --> 00:44:56,880
Not my policy.

597
00:44:57,297 --> 00:44:58,507
Somebody stop that dude!

598
00:44:59,508 --> 00:45:00,175
Hey!

599
00:45:00,342 --> 00:45:01,635
Hey, stop!

600
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:04,430
Somebody stop that dude!

601
00:45:13,105 --> 00:45:13,981
Hey!

602
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:46,388
Oh, God, oh, God.

603
00:45:46,555 --> 00:45:48,098
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

604
00:45:48,724 --> 00:45:50,351
Call an ambulance!

605
00:45:50,517 --> 00:45:52,936
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

606
00:45:53,562 --> 00:45:55,230
Oh, God, oh, my God.

607
00:45:58,901 --> 00:46:00,611
On, God.

608
00:46:03,989 --> 00:46:05,366
No.

609
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:09,495
Oh, Jesus.

610
00:46:13,415 --> 00:46:17,378
Witnesses gave a description to the
sketch artist. I need you to take a look.

611
00:46:21,757 --> 00:46:23,592
No, I don't know him.

612
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:27,304
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives...

613
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:29,431
...are on it.
We'll see what they turn up.

614
00:46:29,598 --> 00:46:31,266
Okay.

615
00:46:36,814 --> 00:46:38,232
Can I have that?

616
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:39,775
Sure.

617
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:44,071
There's one other thing.
He has a star...

618
00:46:44,238 --> 00:46:44,988
<i>tattooed...</i>

619
00:46:45,155 --> 00:46:46,407
<i>...on his left hand.</i>

620
00:47:13,892 --> 00:47:18,397
<i>Peter, I know things
have been difficult lately...</i>

621
00:47:18,856 --> 00:47:20,691
<i>...and I'm sorry about that.</i>

622
00:47:21,275 --> 00:47:23,485
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

623
00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:41,295
Hey, Parker.

624
00:47:42,296 --> 00:47:44,423
- Not today.
- Come on, I just want to talk.

625
00:47:49,678 --> 00:47:51,513
It feels better, right?

626
00:47:52,514 --> 00:47:54,016
Look, your uncle died.

627
00:47:54,683 --> 00:47:56,143
I'm sorry.

628
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,770
I get it.

629
00:47:58,187 --> 00:47:59,730
I'm sorry.

630
00:48:00,105 --> 00:48:01,690
Okay?

631
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:09,239
Peter.

632
00:48:52,783 --> 00:48:53,909
Stay away from him.

633
00:48:54,076 --> 00:48:55,077
- You understand?
- Hey!

634
00:48:55,244 --> 00:48:56,662
- Stay away from Joey.
- Hey!

635
00:48:58,914 --> 00:49:00,207
You like beating on girls?

636
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:01,917
You like beating on old men?

637
00:49:02,084 --> 00:49:02,751
Hey, pal...

638
00:49:02,918 --> 00:49:03,711
...keep walking.

639
00:49:03,877 --> 00:49:06,296
- You're in the wrong place.
- When were you in Queens?

640
00:49:06,922 --> 00:49:08,132
I asked you a question.

641
00:49:08,298 --> 00:49:09,216
Nicky, no!

642
00:49:09,383 --> 00:49:10,092
That the gun?

643
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:11,343
You gonna kill me too?

644
00:49:13,345 --> 00:49:14,471
Hey! Stop it!

645
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:16,306
Hey. get off!

646
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:18,726
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!

647
00:49:18,892 --> 00:49:20,102
Back up!

648
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:22,896
This guy is crazy!

649
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:24,773
Get him!

650
00:49:29,278 --> 00:49:31,530
Get back here, man! Get him!

651
00:49:38,287 --> 00:49:39,121
Follow him!

652
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:44,501
- Go around, man!
- I'll follow you!

653
00:49:53,886 --> 00:49:54,636
Go, go, go!

654
00:49:55,971 --> 00:49:57,181
There he is!

655
00:49:57,347 --> 00:49:58,182
Can't get away!

656
00:50:14,823 --> 00:50:16,658
<i>He has a star tattooed
on his left hand.</i>

657
00:50:28,545 --> 00:50:29,421
Oh, yeah?

658
00:50:29,588 --> 00:50:30,589
Come on!

659
00:50:38,013 --> 00:50:39,556
I know what you look like!

660
00:50:39,723 --> 00:50:41,517
You hear me?

661
00:50:41,934 --> 00:50:44,311
I've seen your face!

662
00:51:22,057 --> 00:51:23,726
Is that all you got?

663
00:51:25,394 --> 00:51:26,895
Just take it, take it.

664
00:51:32,234 --> 00:51:35,070
<i>Engineered from

<i>Last seen on foot

676
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:33,897
Hey.

677
00:53:42,656 --> 00:53:43,699
You got a description?

678
00:53:43,866 --> 00:53:45,075
Well, no, he wears a mask.

679
00:53:45,701 --> 00:53:46,869
A mask?

680
00:53:47,036 --> 00:53:48,203
Most of his victims...

681
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:51,749
...are suspects with serious rap sheets.
They're calling him a vigilante.

682
00:53:51,915 --> 00:53:54,293
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

683
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:57,087
Help me, somebody! Arrest me!

684
00:53:57,254 --> 00:53:58,380
Get me out of here.

685
00:53:59,798 --> 00:54:01,133
Hey, look!

686
00:54:12,269 --> 00:54:14,229
Spandex. Spandex.

687
00:54:15,022 --> 00:54:16,023
Everything...

688
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,066
...spandex.

689
00:54:17,399 --> 00:54:19,568
Extraordinary velocity vector
is a function...

690
00:54:19,735 --> 00:54:21,570
...of both mass and acceleration.

691
00:54:21,737 --> 00:54:23,530
Come on,
you know better than anyone...

692
00:54:23,697 --> 00:54:26,158
...the weight on any pendulum
has no effect on speed.

693
00:54:26,325 --> 00:54:30,079
It doesn't affect frequency,
but it's totally a factor in momentum.

694
00:55:06,448 --> 00:55:07,908
Hey, Aunt May.

695
00:55:08,617 --> 00:55:10,411
Yeah.Eggs?

696
00:55:10,577 --> 00:55:11,829
Organic, got it.

697
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:46,572
In the future,
if you're gonna steal cars...

698
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:48,699
...don't dress like a car thief, man.

699
00:55:48,866 --> 00:55:50,409
What are you? You a cop?

700
00:55:51,243 --> 00:55:55,497
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

701
00:55:55,664 --> 00:55:57,166
You know, you're...

702
00:55:57,916 --> 00:55:59,334
You've got a mind...

703
00:55:59,501 --> 00:56:00,961
...of the true scholar, sir.

704
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:03,505
I was going more for the guys
who do the luge.

705
00:56:04,048 --> 00:56:05,174
Good thinking.

706
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,884
Get out the window.

707
00:56:07,051 --> 00:56:08,343
There you go. You got it.

708
00:56:16,769 --> 00:56:18,187
Crotch!

709
00:56:21,023 --> 00:56:23,359
- Just let me go.
- Is that a real knife?

710
00:56:23,525 --> 00:56:24,693
Yes, it's a real knife.

711
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,362
My weakness, it's small knives.

712
00:56:26,528 --> 00:56:28,113
- Just let me go.
- Anything but...

713
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,199
...knives! Oh, it's so simple.

714
00:56:30,366 --> 00:56:31,825
- That was cool.
- What is this?

715
00:56:31,992 --> 00:56:34,578
Webbing I developed.
I don't think you want to know.

716
00:56:34,745 --> 00:56:35,412
Let me go!

717
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:39,041
Okay, one second.
Hold on, one second.

718
00:56:39,208 --> 00:56:40,334
Knock it off, man. No!

719
00:56:41,585 --> 00:56:43,879
Come on, let me go. Stop it!

720
00:56:44,713 --> 00:56:45,756
That isn't funny.

721
00:56:45,923 --> 00:56:47,383
- It is kind of funny.
- Help!

722
00:56:58,268 --> 00:56:59,728
This could've gone a lot worse.

723
00:56:59,895 --> 00:57:01,855
Now hold still.

724
00:57:07,403 --> 00:57:08,737
Boys in blue here.

725
00:57:08,904 --> 00:57:11,407
- Yo, I got him.
- Freeze!

726
00:57:11,573 --> 00:57:13,409
- He's not going anywhere.
- Don't move.

727
00:57:13,575 --> 00:57:14,576
You serious?

728
00:57:14,743 --> 00:57:15,911
Who are you?

729
00:57:16,328 --> 00:57:18,038
No one grasps
the concept of the mask.

730
00:57:18,205 --> 00:57:18,997
Freeze!

731
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,585
I just did 80 percent of your job.

732
00:57:24,128 --> 00:57:24,878
And that?

733
00:57:25,045 --> 00:57:25,963
That's how you repay me?

734
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:30,759
Hold it right there!

735
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:52,823
Well, that was fun.

736
00:57:54,283 --> 00:57:55,909
Bus! Hey there, everybody.

737
00:57:59,872 --> 00:58:00,998
What are you doing?

738
00:58:05,586 --> 00:58:06,670
Hey, watch out.

739
00:58:06,837 --> 00:58:07,963
I'm swinging here.

740
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:09,631
I'm swinging here.

741
00:58:24,772 --> 00:58:27,524
So 38 of New York's finest...

742
00:58:27,691 --> 00:58:30,861
...versus one guy in a unitard.

743
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:32,988
Am I correct?

744
00:58:47,002 --> 00:58:48,545
You don't have to wait up for me.

745
00:58:48,712 --> 00:58:50,005
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

746
00:58:50,172 --> 00:58:51,173
Yes, I do.

747
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:52,674
- Okay.
- Where were you?

748
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:53,884
I was out.

749
00:58:54,051 --> 00:58:56,011
Did you get the eggs?

750
00:58:57,554 --> 00:58:59,056
Nope. Forgot the eggs.

751
00:58:59,223 --> 00:59:00,432
I'm gonna get them now.

752
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:02,184
No, you most certainly will not.

753
00:59:02,351 --> 00:59:04,353
Not at this hour.

754
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:08,065
Look at me, Peter.

755
00:59:09,817 --> 00:59:12,403
Take off the damn hood
and look at me.

756
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:23,205
Peter. Where do you go?

757
00:59:23,372 --> 00:59:24,832
Who does this to you?

758
00:59:24,998 --> 00:59:26,792
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

759
00:59:26,959 --> 00:59:28,961
- Please tell me.
- Aunt May, please...

760
00:59:29,128 --> 00:59:31,171
...please, please go to sleep.

761
00:59:31,338 --> 00:59:34,383
I can't sleep.
Don't you understand? I can't sleep.

762
00:59:45,894 --> 00:59:48,397
Peter, listen to me.

763
00:59:49,106 --> 00:59:50,315
Secrets have a cost.

764
00:59:50,482 --> 00:59:52,026
They're not for free.

765
00:59:52,192 --> 00:59:54,403
Not now, not ever.

766
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:04,079
Cross-species genetics
is finally working.

767
01:00:04,413 --> 01:00:07,583
I've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.

768
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,334
It's a miracle.

769
01:00:09,501 --> 01:00:11,086
No, it's hard work and promise.

770
01:00:11,253 --> 01:00:15,174
- It's a step closer to the primate lab.
- He doesn't have time for every little step.

771
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,258
Little?

772
01:00:16,425 --> 01:00:17,968
I just mean he can't wait.

773
01:00:18,135 --> 01:00:19,803
Well, he'll have to.

774
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,889
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

775
01:00:22,056 --> 01:00:22,931
That's not what...

776
01:00:23,098 --> 01:00:23,932
...I'm saying-

777
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:25,267
So, what are you saying?

778
01:00:25,934 --> 01:00:28,228
You have to start human trials.

779
01:00:28,937 --> 01:00:29,688
Now.

780
01:00:29,855 --> 01:00:32,024
No, I don't, and no, I won't.

781
01:00:32,191 --> 01:00:34,151
- Well, then he's going to die.
- People die.

782
01:00:35,444 --> 01:00:37,363
Even Norman Osborn.

783
01:00:37,529 --> 01:00:38,530
We are not finished.

784
01:00:38,697 --> 01:00:40,282
Human trials?

785
01:00:40,449 --> 01:00:43,035
Where are you going
to find the people to volunteer?

786
01:00:43,202 --> 01:00:45,788
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a flu shot.

787
01:00:45,954 --> 01:00:48,832
I might think the Veterans Hospital
is a place to start.

788
01:00:48,999 --> 01:00:50,334
You've gotta be kidding me.

789
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,544
I don't think I am.

790
01:00:59,009 --> 01:01:01,303
It's a little late for
shock and indignation.

791
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:02,596
About 15 years late.

792
01:01:02,805 --> 01:01:04,640
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

793
01:01:04,807 --> 01:01:06,308
Richard Parker wore it well.

794
01:01:06,475 --> 01:01:09,311
On you, it's a cheap suit,
as it was then.

795
01:01:09,478 --> 01:01:10,938
I had nothing to do with that.

796
01:01:11,105 --> 01:01:12,648
Is that what you told his son?

797
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,613
I don't know what you're saying.

798
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,324
You don't know,
or you don't wanna know?

799
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,161
I'll remind you what happened.

800
01:01:26,328 --> 01:01:29,790
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

801
01:01:32,167 --> 01:01:35,337
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

802
01:01:36,338 --> 01:01:38,090
I----

803
01:01:45,723 --> 01:01:47,349
I won't.

804
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,186
Fine.

805
01:01:55,774 --> 01:01:58,485
The formula is ours now anyway.

806
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:02,448
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

807
01:02:02,614 --> 01:02:04,158
I'm shutting you down.

808
01:02:04,324 --> 01:02:07,244
Have your office cleared out
by the morning.

809
01:02:07,411 --> 01:02:10,914
Your toys can be taken away too,
you know.

810
01:02:13,042 --> 01:02:14,126
Right, Freddy?

811
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:30,392
- Hey.
- Hi.

812
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:31,352
How's it going?

813
01:02:31,518 --> 01:02:32,728
Where you headed?

814
01:02:33,729 --> 01:02:36,273
- Monday, B track.
- Oh, it's Thursday.

815
01:02:36,774 --> 01:02:38,400
- It's Thursday?
- What happened?

816
01:02:38,567 --> 01:02:40,235
- What?
- Your eye, it looks bruised.

817
01:02:40,402 --> 01:02:41,653
Oh, yeah, no, I don't...

818
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:43,447
Maybe I got a rash or...

819
01:02:43,614 --> 01:02:45,407
It's bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?

820
01:02:47,659 --> 01:02:49,370
Do you like branzino?

821
01:02:50,412 --> 01:02:51,747
Like, a fish

822
01:02:51,914 --> 01:02:53,749
No, no. I know. I know.

823
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:56,126
Well, if you want...

824
01:02:56,293 --> 01:03:00,798
...you can come to this address
at 8:00 tonight.

825
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:03,258
My mom's making branzino.

826
01:03:03,759 --> 01:03:05,177
So...

827
01:03:05,386 --> 01:03:06,220
It's apartment...

828
01:03:06,387 --> 01:03:08,722
...2016. I didn't write that part down.

829
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:10,224
I don't know why I...

830
01:03:10,391 --> 01:03:12,226
- I'll remember it.
- Oh, okay.

831
01:03:12,393 --> 01:03:13,769
2016.

832
01:04:21,837 --> 01:04:23,172
Hi.

833
01:04:24,506 --> 01:04:25,758
How did you get out there?

834
01:04:26,633 --> 01:04:28,177
The fire escape.

835
01:04:29,344 --> 01:04:30,846
Your doorman's intimidating.

836
01:04:31,764 --> 01:04:33,390
It's 20 storeys.

837
01:04:33,766 --> 01:04:35,184
Yeah. It's all right.

838
01:04:39,355 --> 01:04:41,357
- This is your room.
- Yes, this is my room.

839
01:04:41,523 --> 01:04:43,192
Books.

840
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,860
Shoes.

841
01:04:45,486 --> 01:04:46,987
Oh, hey...

842
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:49,406
I got your mom...

843
01:04:49,573 --> 01:04:50,949
...these.

844
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,201
Oh, lovely.

845
01:04:52,368 --> 01:04:54,036
- Beautiful, right?
- Beautiful.

846
01:04:54,203 --> 01:04:55,579
They were nice.

847
01:04:55,746 --> 01:04:57,539
- No, they're beautiful.
- I'm sorry.

848
01:04:57,706 --> 01:05:00,459
No, it's impressive.
They actually held together very well.

849
01:05:00,626 --> 01:05:02,169
I'm gonna keep these.

850
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,380
You have your suit in there?

851
01:05:07,424 --> 01:05:09,093
My Suit?

852
01:05:09,259 --> 01:05:11,637
It's for dinner. Are you gonna--?

853
01:05:11,804 --> 01:05:12,930
Are you gonna wear that?

854
01:05:13,097 --> 01:05:14,098
- That's--
- Hey, hon.

855
01:05:19,728 --> 01:05:20,646
You must be Peter.

856
01:05:20,813 --> 01:05:22,648
Dad, this is Peter.

857
01:05:25,317 --> 01:05:26,527
Nice to meet you, sir.

858
01:05:27,736 --> 01:05:28,862
Nice to meet you.

859
01:05:29,029 --> 01:05:30,614
Dinner's ready.

860
01:05:31,407 --> 01:05:32,741
Hope you like branzino.

861
01:05:32,908 --> 01:05:34,451
Who doesn't?

862
01:06:33,969 --> 01:06:35,304
<i>Emma, it's Curt.</i>

863
01:06:36,055 --> 01:06:38,265
<i>- Is he there?
- I'm afraid not, doctor.</i>

864
01:06:38,432 --> 01:06:41,268
<i>The car is taking him
to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.</i>

865
01:06:41,435 --> 01:06:42,644
No. He can't, Emma.

866
01:06:42,811 --> 01:06:45,105
You have to stop him. He--

867
01:06:45,272 --> 01:06:47,691
<i>I would, but I always lose him
on the bridge.</i>

868
01:06:47,858 --> 01:06:50,819
<i>I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns
your call as soon as possible.</i>

869
01:07:00,829 --> 01:07:04,166
I'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. I'm in a hurry.

870
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:06,377
You want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?

871
01:07:06,543 --> 01:07:07,795
Bridge! Take the bridge.

872
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:09,296
All right, we'll do that.

873
01:07:09,463 --> 01:07:10,547
Hey, you all right...

874
01:07:10,714 --> 01:07:11,465
...back there?

875
01:07:12,383 --> 01:07:13,050
You tweaking...

876
01:07:13,217 --> 01:07:14,426
...man?

877
01:07:15,552 --> 01:07:17,179
Just drive.

878
01:07:17,763 --> 01:07:18,972
Okay.

879
01:07:25,229 --> 01:07:26,730
You're having trouble there?

880
01:07:26,897 --> 01:07:28,565
The head goes on the other--

881
01:07:28,732 --> 01:07:30,275
Help Gwen's friend with his fish.

882
01:07:30,442 --> 01:07:31,652
On, I...

883
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:32,903
I got no idea.

884
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:34,613
First time.

885
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,365
- Branzino.
- George.

886
01:07:36,532 --> 01:07:39,284
- Tell us about your day.
- Did you catch that spider guy yet?

887
01:07:39,451 --> 01:07:41,036
No, we didn't catch him yet.

888
01:07:41,203 --> 01:07:43,080
But we will. He's an amateur...

889
01:07:43,247 --> 01:07:45,958
...who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

890
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:48,001
He's clumsy, he leaves clues...

891
01:07:48,168 --> 01:07:49,545
...but he's still dangerous.

892
01:07:50,421 --> 01:07:51,880
He's assaulting people?

893
01:07:53,716 --> 01:07:54,717
I'm not sure.

894
01:07:54,883 --> 01:07:56,343
I mean, I saw that video...

895
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:58,470
...with him and the car thief, and...

896
01:07:58,637 --> 01:08:01,765
I think most people
would say that he was...

897
01:08:02,516 --> 01:08:03,892
...providing a public service.

898
01:08:04,601 --> 01:08:06,562
Most people would be wrong.

899
01:08:07,855 --> 01:08:11,316
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

900
01:08:11,483 --> 01:08:12,735
So why wasn't he then?

901
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:17,781
Let me illuminate you.

902
01:08:17,948 --> 01:08:20,576
The car thief was leading us
to the people who run...

903
01:08:20,743 --> 01:08:22,953
...the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.

904
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,123
It's called strategy.
I'm sure you're aware of the term?

905
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:28,792
- You've heard about that in school?
- Yeah.

906
01:08:28,959 --> 01:08:29,835
Good.

907
01:08:30,002 --> 01:08:31,253
<i>I know.</i>

908
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:34,089
- He didn't know you had a plan.
- You seem to know...

909
01:08:34,256 --> 01:08:36,008
...a lot about this.
Know something we don't?

910
01:08:36,175 --> 01:08:38,469
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm not on anyone's side.

911
01:08:38,635 --> 01:08:40,012
I saw a video on the lnternet--

912
01:08:40,179 --> 01:08:41,722
You saw the video on the Internet.

913
01:08:41,889 --> 01:08:44,099
- Well, then the case is closed.
- Well, no.

914
01:08:44,266 --> 01:08:45,225
If you watch the video--

915
01:08:45,392 --> 01:08:46,852
Maybe send you a link?

916
01:08:47,019 --> 01:08:48,687
It looks like he's trying to help.

917
01:08:48,854 --> 01:08:51,732
On the Internet he's being made out
to look like a hero.

918
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:52,566
No, no.

919
01:08:52,733 --> 01:08:54,443
I'm not saying he's a hero.

920
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:56,945
- What are you trying to say?
- He's trying to help.

921
01:08:57,112 --> 01:08:58,447
He's trying to do something
the police can't.

922
01:08:58,614 --> 01:08:59,990
Something the police can't?

923
01:09:00,157 --> 01:09:01,700
- I don't know.
- What do you think we do?

924
01:09:01,867 --> 01:09:03,410
Sit around eating doughnuts...

925
01:09:03,577 --> 01:09:05,371
...with our thumbs
planted up our asses?

926
01:09:05,537 --> 01:09:07,581
- George. George.
- Daddy.

927
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:08,499
- Up your what?
- Howard.

928
01:09:08,665 --> 01:09:10,501
He stands for what you stand for.

929
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:12,211
Protecting innocent people
from bad guys.

930
01:09:12,378 --> 01:09:14,463
I stand for law and order.
That's what I stand for.

931
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:16,215
Okay? I wear a badge.

932
01:09:16,382 --> 01:09:19,426
This guy wears a mask
like an outlaw.

933
01:09:19,593 --> 01:09:22,137
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same...

934
01:09:22,304 --> 01:09:24,473
...like he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

935
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,643
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

936
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:29,645
Let's get some air, Peter.

937
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:32,439
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Yes, we do.

938
01:09:34,817 --> 01:09:36,652
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry...

939
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:39,071
...if I insulted you.
It was not my intention.

940
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,574
- You're welcome.
- Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.

941
01:09:42,741 --> 01:09:44,827
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

942
01:09:46,537 --> 01:09:49,081
- Dad.
- Yeah?

943
01:09:55,838 --> 01:09:57,756
Well, that was something.

944
01:09:59,216 --> 01:10:02,302
I'm sorry. I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.

945
01:10:02,469 --> 01:10:05,097
No, I wouldn't
have let him arrest you

946
01:10:09,852 --> 01:10:12,563
- What happened to your face?
- I wanna tell you something.

947
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,691
Okay.

948
01:10:20,821 --> 01:10:22,114
I've been bitten...

949
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:27,327
So have I.

950
01:10:32,791 --> 01:10:34,209
Okay.

951
01:10:35,711 --> 01:10:38,213
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

952
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:40,132
I gotta tell you this thing about...

953
01:10:40,299 --> 01:10:43,135
...the vigilante and the car thief.
- Oh, okay.

954
01:10:43,302 --> 01:10:44,970
What?

955
01:10:45,137 --> 01:10:47,389
- No, no, no.
- I don't want to talk about that.

956
01:10:47,556 --> 01:10:49,224
Forget that.
I won't talk about that.

957
01:10:49,391 --> 01:10:51,643
- I'm gonna talk about me, okay?
- What about you?

958
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:55,647
It's impo-- I wish I could just--

959
01:10:55,814 --> 01:10:57,066
I can't. It's hard to say.

960
01:10:57,232 --> 01:10:58,233
Just say it.

961
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,527
- I don't know.
- Say it.

962
01:11:03,364 --> 01:11:04,656
What? What?

963
01:11:08,118 --> 01:11:09,828
What?

964
01:11:13,874 --> 01:11:15,751
Okay, then forget it.

965
01:11:23,884 --> 01:11:25,344
You...?

966
01:11:33,977 --> 01:11:36,105
- You're Spider-Man.
- Shut up.

967
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:42,611
Gwen?

968
01:11:43,862 --> 01:11:45,197
Gwen...

969
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,158
Your father wants you to come inside.

970
01:11:48,575 --> 01:11:49,785
Okay.

971
01:11:49,952 --> 01:11:50,953
- Okay?
- Yeah.

972
01:11:53,747 --> 01:11:54,790
Gwen.

973
01:11:54,915 --> 01:11:56,625
I'm coming.

974
01:12:28,115 --> 01:12:29,908
Oh, I'm in trouble.

975
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:54,308
Will you please...

976
01:12:54,433 --> 01:12:56,352
...find out what is going on, Alfred?

977
01:13:03,776 --> 01:13:04,651
Excellent.

978
01:13:07,946 --> 01:13:08,947
Hey!

979
01:13:11,742 --> 01:13:13,077
Hey! What is that?

980
01:13:13,202 --> 01:13:15,120
- Oh, my God!
- I don't know!

981
01:13:15,245 --> 01:13:16,705
Get back in the car!

982
01:13:21,794 --> 01:13:23,170
Help!

983
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,756
Help!

984
01:14:05,879 --> 01:14:08,090
Incoming!

985
01:14:29,069 --> 01:14:29,778
Somebody help!

986
01:14:30,612 --> 01:14:32,281
Help me! My kid is trapped!

987
01:14:42,041 --> 01:14:43,208
I want my dad!

988
01:14:43,542 --> 01:14:44,585
Dad!

989
01:14:44,752 --> 01:14:46,128
'HeY,hey,hey
- Help!

990
01:14:46,295 --> 01:14:46,962
L-ley, buddy.

991
01:14:47,087 --> 01:14:48,297
- It's okay.
- Get away.

992
01:14:49,256 --> 01:14:50,382
- Help!
- Hey, look.

993
01:14:51,925 --> 01:14:53,802
Just a normal guy, all right?

994
01:14:55,512 --> 01:14:56,388
Wanna hold this?

995
01:14:58,098 --> 01:14:58,891
Hold my mask.

996
01:14:59,475 --> 01:15:00,434
All right.

997
01:15:01,977 --> 01:15:03,437
What's your name?

998
01:15:03,604 --> 01:15:04,396
Jack?

999
01:15:05,314 --> 01:15:06,982
- Yes.
- Let's get you out of here.

1000
01:15:08,359 --> 01:15:10,110
Okay, stay very still.

1001
01:15:10,277 --> 01:15:11,111
All right.

1002
01:15:11,278 --> 01:15:12,529
Okay, I got you.

1003
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:17,618
Okay, look.

1004
01:15:17,785 --> 01:15:19,411
I'll undo the belt. You hold on...

1005
01:15:19,578 --> 01:15:21,622
...to that seat in front of you.
On three?

1006
01:15:21,872 --> 01:15:24,541
- All right.
- Okay, one, two, three.

1007
01:15:26,668 --> 01:15:28,837
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

1008
01:15:29,004 --> 01:15:30,714
All right, okay.

1009
01:15:44,311 --> 01:15:45,688
Jack, climb now.

1010
01:15:45,854 --> 01:15:47,481
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1011
01:15:52,861 --> 01:15:54,863
Put it on, the mask.

1012
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:56,448
It's gonna make you strong.

1013
01:15:57,032 --> 01:15:58,367
Jack, trust me.

1014
01:15:58,534 --> 01:15:59,493
Put it on.

1015
01:16:00,285 --> 01:16:02,913
There you go. That's it.
That's it, buddy.

1016
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,206
Okay, now, climb.

1017
01:16:04,373 --> 01:16:05,374
Come on, Jack.

1018
01:16:09,128 --> 01:16:09,795
Do me a favour.

1019
01:16:09,962 --> 01:16:11,463
A little faster, okay, bud?

1020
01:16:11,714 --> 01:16:14,049
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

1021
01:16:14,216 --> 01:16:15,300
That's it. Keep coming.

1022
01:16:15,467 --> 01:16:16,885
Keep it coming.

1023
01:16:17,052 --> 01:16:18,095
Keep coming.

1024
01:16:19,012 --> 01:16:20,347
No!

1025
01:16:34,987 --> 01:16:36,697
Jack. Oh, God.

1026
01:16:36,864 --> 01:16:38,365
Thank God.

1027
01:16:40,075 --> 01:16:41,410
You okay?

1028
01:16:44,455 --> 01:16:45,914
My son. My son.

1029
01:16:46,749 --> 01:16:47,875
Oh, my son.

1030
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,793
My son.

1031
01:16:54,256 --> 01:16:55,340
Who are you?

1032
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,261
Spider-Man.

1033
01:17:46,308 --> 01:17:48,310
Beautiful.

1034
01:17:56,485 --> 01:17:57,528
Settle down, guys.

1035
01:17:58,529 --> 01:18:00,155
Settle down, boys. Settle down.

1036
01:18:00,322 --> 01:18:02,491
- Come on.
- Listen. At approximately...

1037
01:18:02,658 --> 01:18:06,120
...9 p.m. last night, an incident
took place on the Williamsburg Bridge.

1038
01:18:06,662 --> 01:18:08,497
<i>Much of what occurred
is speculation...</i>

1039
01:18:08,664 --> 01:18:11,458
<i>...at this point.
However, several eyewitnesses...</i>

1040
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:15,045
<i>...to the crime, as well as
our own preliminary findings, have...</i>

1041
01:18:15,212 --> 01:18:16,338
<i>...positively placed...</i>

1042
01:18:16,505 --> 01:18:18,173
<i>...one individual at the scene.</i>

1043
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:19,800
<i>Which is why, this morning...</i>

1044
01:18:19,967 --> 01:18:21,385
<i>...I am issuing a warrant...</i>

1045
01:18:21,552 --> 01:18:24,888
<i>...for the masked vigilante
known as Spider-Man.</i>

1046
01:18:30,811 --> 01:18:34,523
<i>And lastly, city council members met
with homeowners and airport officials...</i>

1047
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:36,358
<i>...in the first of four meetings...</i>

1048
01:18:43,657 --> 01:18:45,034
It's so beautiful.

1049
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,036
Knows how to bite though.

1050
01:18:47,202 --> 01:18:48,954
Who else knows about this?

1051
01:18:49,121 --> 01:18:49,997
Just you.

1052
01:18:50,164 --> 01:18:51,415
Really?

1053
01:18:53,876 --> 01:18:55,794
Hey, you don't...

1054
01:18:56,545 --> 01:18:59,131
You don't believe what the police
are saying, do you?

1055
01:19:00,007 --> 01:19:01,508
Of course not.

1056
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:04,887
Does it scare you?

1057
01:19:05,054 --> 01:19:06,889
What you can do?

1058
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:10,726
No.

1059
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:12,936
No.

1060
01:19:13,896 --> 01:19:16,023
What did that thing
on the bridge look like?

1061
01:19:16,565 --> 01:19:19,026
It was real big.
Too big to be human.

1062
01:19:19,401 --> 01:19:20,944
You gotta lay low.

1063
01:19:21,737 --> 01:19:23,113
No, can't do that.

1064
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,865
You've got to.

1065
01:19:25,699 --> 01:19:27,201
I mean, why...?

1066
01:19:27,493 --> 01:19:29,995
Because of last night.

1067
01:19:30,162 --> 01:19:32,164
Those people on the bridge.

1068
01:19:32,331 --> 01:19:36,335
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

1069
01:19:37,961 --> 01:19:38,670
So...

1070
01:19:38,837 --> 01:19:40,506
...I gotta go after it.

1071
01:19:42,007 --> 01:19:43,050
That's not your job.

1072
01:19:44,468 --> 01:19:46,053
Maybe it is.

1073
01:19:50,974 --> 01:19:52,518
I really liked kissing you.

1074
01:19:55,145 --> 01:19:56,647
You're an amazing kisser.

1075
01:19:59,441 --> 01:20:00,609
Well, you know, it was--

1076
01:20:00,776 --> 01:20:02,778
It was good for me too.

1077
01:20:05,447 --> 01:20:07,074
Yeah?

1078
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:17,626
Who did that?

1079
01:20:39,356 --> 01:20:40,357
Hello!

1080
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:52,202
It's not nice to snoop.

1081
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:56,999
I gave everyone the week off.

1082
01:20:59,209 --> 01:20:59,918
Yeah.

1083
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:02,504
Shouldn't you be at school?

1084
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,300
No, I got a free track.

1085
01:21:06,467 --> 01:21:08,469
I wanted to ask you a question.

1086
01:21:09,178 --> 01:21:10,220
How would a predator...

1087
01:21:10,387 --> 01:21:11,680
...track a reptile?

1088
01:21:11,805 --> 01:21:14,683
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top...

1089
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:16,101
...of their food chain.

1090
01:21:16,268 --> 01:21:17,770
Kings of their domain.

1091
01:21:17,936 --> 01:21:19,438
They gotta have vulnerabilities.

1092
01:21:19,605 --> 01:21:22,149
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

1093
01:21:25,694 --> 01:21:26,987
Just asking a question.

1094
01:21:27,154 --> 01:21:29,990
I got school stuff.

1095
01:21:30,157 --> 01:21:32,159
Biology profiles to do.

1096
01:21:32,576 --> 01:21:34,828
So because of the cold blood...

1097
01:21:34,995 --> 01:21:36,914
...would they react to changes
in temperatures?

1098
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:38,457
You'd have to catch one first.

1099
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:42,669
Did you know there's a rumour
of a new species in New York?

1100
01:21:42,836 --> 01:21:44,338
Beautiful and quite large.

1101
01:21:45,506 --> 01:21:47,466
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

1102
01:21:47,633 --> 01:21:49,635
No, it's not yet classified.

1103
01:21:52,596 --> 01:21:54,598
But it can be aggressive...

1104
01:21:55,516 --> 01:21:56,433
...if threatened.

1105
01:22:04,191 --> 01:22:05,442
Doc, you all right?

1106
01:22:05,609 --> 01:22:08,237
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

1107
01:22:08,404 --> 01:22:09,947
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1108
01:22:10,114 --> 01:22:12,866
Afraid I have to ask you to leave.
I have a new project...

1109
01:22:13,033 --> 01:22:15,452
...I'm working on.
I need to be alone.

1110
01:22:16,078 --> 01:22:18,372
Good. Good, good.

1111
01:22:18,914 --> 01:22:20,749
Good.

1112
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:24,253
Don't worry, Mr. Parker.
I'll be back.

1113
01:22:25,254 --> 01:22:27,381
Wonderful things are coming.

1114
01:22:28,632 --> 01:22:30,426
Wonderful things.

1115
01:22:44,982 --> 01:22:46,275
Fred?

1116
01:22:51,071 --> 01:22:53,282
Mr. Mayor,
if there was a giant dinosaur...

1117
01:22:53,449 --> 01:22:55,951
...running around
you would be the first to know.

1118
01:22:56,076 --> 01:22:58,662
So tell your son
he can rest easy, all right?

1119
01:22:58,829 --> 01:23:00,873
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

1120
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:03,250
Okay. Bye-bye-

1121
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:05,294
Mr. Parker, why are you...

1122
01:23:05,419 --> 01:23:07,296
...not in school?
- Got a free track.

1123
01:23:07,463 --> 01:23:08,714
Okay, well, I do not.

1124
01:23:08,881 --> 01:23:10,132
So make your point quickly.

1125
01:23:10,299 --> 01:23:12,676
Fine, there may not be a dinosaur
running around.

1126
01:23:12,801 --> 01:23:15,137
There is something more dangerous,
and I know who.

1127
01:23:15,304 --> 01:23:16,889
- You know who?
- Dr. Curtis Connors.

1128
01:23:17,056 --> 01:23:18,432
- He's a biochemist.
- Of Oscorp?

1129
01:23:18,599 --> 01:23:20,100
- That's right.
- Dr. Connors...

1130
01:23:20,267 --> 01:23:22,269
...who's my daughter's mentor.
Is that who?

1131
01:23:22,436 --> 01:23:23,645
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1132
01:23:23,812 --> 01:23:27,107
Recently, Dr. Connors gave Gwen
a college recommendation.

1133
01:23:27,274 --> 01:23:29,318
It was beautiful.
When I read it, I cried.

1134
01:23:29,443 --> 01:23:31,653
You would have me believe
that he...

1135
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:34,031
...is running around dressed up
like a dinosaur?

1136
01:23:34,198 --> 01:23:37,868
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur.
He has transformed himself into a lizard.

1137
01:23:41,121 --> 01:23:42,664
Let me ask you a question.

1138
01:23:42,831 --> 01:23:45,959
Do I look like the mayor
of Tokyo to you?

1139
01:23:46,085 --> 01:23:48,587
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

1140
01:23:48,754 --> 01:23:51,799
This man has worked for his whole life
on cross-species genetics.

1141
01:23:51,965 --> 01:23:55,511
He lost an arm, he tried to grow it back,
but the equation was imbalanced.

1142
01:23:55,677 --> 01:23:58,138
He has turned into a lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

1143
01:23:58,305 --> 01:24:02,017
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

1144
01:24:02,184 --> 01:24:04,645
Okay. All right, I get it.

1145
01:24:05,521 --> 01:24:06,563
Here's what we'll do.

1146
01:24:07,022 --> 01:24:09,817
You'll go back to hanging out
with the citizens of Tokyo.

1147
01:24:09,983 --> 01:24:12,194
I'm gonna go back
to protecting the citizens...

1148
01:24:12,361 --> 01:24:14,405
...of this fine, fair city of ours.

1149
01:24:14,571 --> 01:24:16,824
Sergeant Butler,
please escort Mr. Parker...

1150
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:19,952
...back to school.
- Captain Stacy, I'm not messing around.

1151
01:24:20,119 --> 01:24:23,163
Just bring him in. Just call him in.
You have to call him in.

1152
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:24,957
He is a danger to everybody.

1153
01:24:25,124 --> 01:24:27,376
- Just, please, listen to me.
- Let's go.

1154
01:24:31,714 --> 01:24:33,048
Jimmy.

1155
01:24:34,258 --> 01:24:37,136
Get me everything we have
on Dr. Curtis Connors.

1156
01:24:37,261 --> 01:24:39,847
- Okay? Right away.
- Yeah.

1157
01:25:05,247 --> 01:25:07,207
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors.

1158
01:25:07,374 --> 01:25:08,917
Current temperature: 89.7.

1159
01:25:09,084 --> 01:25:10,544
Steady for 48 hours.

1160
01:25:10,711 --> 01:25:13,213
Blood panels reveal
lymphocyte and monocyte readings...

1161
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,049
...consistent with subject's past.

1162
01:25:20,804 --> 01:25:22,473
Clotting rate vastly improved.

1163
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,141
Marked enhancement...

1164
01:25:24,308 --> 01:25:25,642
...in muscle response...

1165
01:25:25,809 --> 01:25:27,186
...strength and elasticity.

1166
01:25:35,027 --> 01:25:37,112
Eyesight similarly improved.

1167
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:39,782
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

1168
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,039
This is no longer about curing ills.

1169
01:25:47,581 --> 01:25:48,957
This is about...

1170
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:50,209
...finding perfection.

1171
01:25:59,468 --> 01:26:01,553
In attempt to redress
regenerative relapse...

1172
01:26:01,678 --> 01:26:05,474
...dosage has been increased
to 200 milligrams.

1173
01:27:40,277 --> 01:27:42,029
You stopped me once.

1174
01:27:42,863 --> 01:27:45,240
You won't stop me again.

1175
01:27:47,242 --> 01:27:50,245
I'm getting stronger every day!

1176
01:28:28,992 --> 01:28:30,536
Oh, that sucked.

1177
01:28:41,964 --> 01:28:43,632
Peter Parker.

1178
01:29:01,316 --> 01:29:02,860
Come in.

1179
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:06,655
You should maybe...

1180
01:29:06,822 --> 01:29:08,657
...consider coming in
through the lobby.

1181
01:29:10,284 --> 01:29:13,328
Also, my father is under
the impression...

1182
01:29:13,454 --> 01:29:16,331
...that you require psychiatric attention.
- Oh, really?

1183
01:29:16,582 --> 01:29:18,167
Peter.

1184
01:29:18,667 --> 01:29:19,710
What happened?

1185
01:29:19,835 --> 01:29:21,211
You should see the other guy.

1186
01:29:23,047 --> 01:29:27,468
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

1187
01:29:27,634 --> 01:29:28,635
Hey, Gwen, honey.

1188
01:29:28,802 --> 01:29:29,720
Do you want cocoa?

1189
01:29:29,887 --> 01:29:31,013
Howard's making some.

1190
01:29:35,601 --> 01:29:37,019
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.

1191
01:29:37,186 --> 01:29:38,854
Honestly, I'm 17 years old.

1192
01:29:39,021 --> 01:29:39,855
Okay.

1193
01:29:40,022 --> 01:29:44,068
I remembered somebody saying her
fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.

1194
01:29:44,234 --> 01:29:45,694
Well, that's impractical.

1195
01:29:45,819 --> 01:29:47,279
And fattening.

1196
01:29:50,532 --> 01:29:51,617
Chocolate house.

1197
01:29:54,495 --> 01:29:56,288
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's good.

1198
01:29:56,455 --> 01:29:59,249
I can't have cocoa right now
because I'm work--

1199
01:29:59,375 --> 01:30:02,503
I'm doing this...

1200
01:30:02,669 --> 01:30:04,296
I have cramps.

1201
01:30:05,172 --> 01:30:07,216
I feel kind of pukey and just sort of...

1202
01:30:07,383 --> 01:30:09,676
- Like, emotional. I keep crying.
- It's okay. Good.

1203
01:30:09,802 --> 01:30:11,553
- Good.
- It's brutal.

1204
01:30:12,429 --> 01:30:13,764
You don't want to know.

1205
01:30:13,931 --> 01:30:15,099
- It's, like, bad.
- Got it.

1206
01:30:15,265 --> 01:30:17,226
- Thanks, Daddy.
- All right.

1207
01:30:42,334 --> 01:30:44,753
Easy, Bug BOY

1208
01:30:45,504 --> 01:30:46,922
What'd you call me?

1209
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:53,846
I'm going to be all right.

1210
01:30:54,012 --> 01:30:56,724
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

1211
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:00,602
I know what this is.

1212
01:31:00,769 --> 01:31:02,104
What is it?

1213
01:31:03,022 --> 01:31:06,191
Every day, for as long
as I can remember, my father...

1214
01:31:06,358 --> 01:31:07,818
...has left every morning...

1215
01:31:07,985 --> 01:31:10,654
...and he's put a badge on his chest...

1216
01:31:10,821 --> 01:31:13,115
...and strapped a gun to his hip.

1217
01:31:15,784 --> 01:31:18,162
And every day,
for as long as I can remember...

1218
01:31:18,328 --> 01:31:20,789
...I haven't known if he was
gonna make it home.

1219
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:32,176
<i>L</i> 901 you

1220
01:31:33,427 --> 01:31:34,595
Okay?

1221
01:31:37,306 --> 01:31:38,307
Okay?

1222
01:31:39,892 --> 01:31:41,977
I gotta stop him, though.

1223
01:31:42,644 --> 01:31:45,564
I have to, because I created him.

1224
01:31:48,859 --> 01:31:50,319
What do you mean?

1225
01:31:51,737 --> 01:31:53,822
I gave him an equation...

1226
01:31:56,367 --> 01:31:58,494
...that made all of this possible.

1227
01:32:06,126 --> 01:32:09,004
Something my father
had been working on, you know.

1228
01:32:09,171 --> 01:32:12,174
Secretly. Now I realise
why he kept it a secret.

1229
01:32:14,968 --> 01:32:17,429
Point is, this is my responsibility.

1230
01:32:20,766 --> 01:32:22,935
I have to fix it.

1231
01:32:26,021 --> 01:32:27,690
Peter.

1232
01:32:28,732 --> 01:32:30,442
Hey.

1233
01:32:33,737 --> 01:32:35,864
Let's get out of here.

1234
01:32:36,031 --> 01:32:37,825
Let's just get out of here.

1235
01:32:37,991 --> 01:32:39,702
Just for a minute. Can we?

1236
01:32:40,411 --> 01:32:42,371
- No. No.
- Yeah. Yes.

1237
01:32:42,538 --> 01:32:43,706
- Yes.
- No.

1238
01:32:43,872 --> 01:32:45,040
Yes.

1239
01:32:45,207 --> 01:32:47,710
If my parents see me leaving,
I'm dead.

1240
01:32:52,297 --> 01:32:54,383
Your parents aren't
gonna see you leaving.

01:33:30,878 --> 01:33:33,630
"That, changing like the snake,
I might be free...

1251
01:33:33,797 --> 01:33:37,426
...to cast off flesh
wherein I dwell confined."

1252
01:33:37,593 --> 01:33:40,763
<i>Would you give it all up
after all you know...</i>

1253
01:33:40,929 --> 01:33:41,889
<i>...you can do?</i>

1254
01:33:42,056 --> 01:33:44,683
<i>All the power you feel.</i>

1255
01:33:48,187 --> 01:33:49,438
<i>I can save...</i>

1256
01:33:49,605 --> 01:33:50,522
<i>them!</i>

1257
01:33:57,237 --> 01:33:58,238
<i>You won't get in...</i>

1258
01:33:58,405 --> 01:33:59,573
<i>...the way of my plan...</i>

1259
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:01,367
<i>...Peter Parker!</i>

1260
01:34:27,768 --> 01:34:29,019
Go. Go!

1261
01:35:05,389 --> 01:35:07,391
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

1262
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:25,951
All these souls...

1263
01:35:26,118 --> 01:35:27,369
...lost and alone.

1264
01:35:27,536 --> 01:35:28,412
I can save them.

1265
01:35:28,579 --> 01:35:30,205
I can cure them.

1266
01:35:30,372 --> 01:35:31,957
There's no need to stop me...

1267
01:35:32,124 --> 01:35:33,042
...Peter.

1268
01:35:42,593 --> 01:35:44,678
You're not thinking straight, doc.

1269
01:35:48,390 --> 01:35:50,017
Stop this. This isn't you.

1270
01:35:55,189 --> 01:35:56,148
Let's talk this out.

1271
01:35:57,274 --> 01:35:58,025
Doc!

1272
01:36:04,114 --> 01:36:05,157
Oh, boy.

1273
01:36:10,746 --> 01:36:11,789
You don't want to talk?

1274
01:36:12,623 --> 01:36:14,166
There you go.

1275
01:36:17,795 --> 01:36:19,004
Don't...

1276
01:36:19,797 --> 01:36:21,382
...make me...

1277
01:36:21,548 --> 01:36:22,549
...have to...

1278
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:24,009
...hurt you!

1279
01:36:31,892 --> 01:36:33,227
That is disgusting.

1280
01:36:43,278 --> 01:36:44,655
Gwen.

1281
01:37:08,595 --> 01:37:10,806
- I'm gonna throw you out the window.
- What?

1282
01:37:24,028 --> 01:37:25,070
Somebody's been...

1283
01:37:25,237 --> 01:37:26,905
...a bad lizard.

1284
01:38:13,786 --> 01:38:15,871
This is Lieutenant Williams
from the New York City...

1285
01:38:16,038 --> 01:38:19,500
...Police Department.
We've got this building surrounded.

1286
01:38:28,675 --> 01:38:30,677
Alpha, let's move ahead. Go!

1287
01:38:42,314 --> 01:38:43,607
- Hey.
- Where are you?

1288
01:38:43,774 --> 01:38:44,692
I'm fine. I'm okay.

1289
01:38:44,858 --> 01:38:48,237
I'm in the sewer, tracking him. I gotta
stop him before anyone gets hurt.

1290
01:38:48,404 --> 01:38:49,530
But we need an antidote.

1291
01:38:49,697 --> 01:38:52,282
<i>- Do you know how to run a serum?
- I do it all the time.</i>

1292
01:38:52,449 --> 01:38:54,868
Okay, great.
Okay, I need you to go to Oscorp.

1293
01:38:55,035 --> 01:38:58,038
<i>I</i> need you to access the
cross-species file. It's a blue serum

1294
01:38:58,205 --> 01:39:00,332
File 12389.

1295
01:39:00,499 --> 01:39:01,583
<i>Okay, got it.</i>

1296
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:03,502
On my WHY

1297
01:39:34,992 --> 01:39:38,620
<i>I spent my life as a scientist trying
to create a world without weakness...</i>

1298
01:39:38,787 --> 01:39:40,956
<i>...without outcasts.</i>

1299
01:39:41,123 --> 01:39:43,667
<i>I sought to create
a stronger human being...</i>

1300
01:39:43,834 --> 01:39:45,753
<i>...but there's no such thing.</i>

1301
01:39:45,919 --> 01:39:49,173
<i>Human beings are weak,
pathetic, feeble-minded...</i>

1302
01:39:49,339 --> 01:39:51,008
<i>...creatures.</i>

1303
01:39:51,175 --> 01:39:52,634
<i>Why be human at all...</i>

1304
01:39:52,801 --> 01:39:54,053
<i>...when we can be so...</i>

1305
01:39:54,219 --> 01:39:55,054
<i>...much more?</i>

1306
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:57,514
<i>Faster. Stronger.</i>

1307
01:39:57,681 --> 01:39:59,099
<i>Smarter.</i>

1308
01:39:59,266 --> 01:40:02,102
<i>This is my gift to you.</i>

1309
01:40:10,611 --> 01:40:12,279
Oscorp.

1310
01:40:14,531 --> 01:40:15,657
- Captain Stacy!
- What?

1311
01:40:15,824 --> 01:40:18,285
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed...

1312
01:40:18,452 --> 01:40:20,662
...toward Canal Street.
- What about Spider-Man?

1313
01:40:20,829 --> 01:40:22,039
Inside the high school.

1314
01:40:22,206 --> 01:40:24,124
I want that Spider-Man off the street.

1315
01:42:10,731 --> 01:42:13,609
<i>The lizard creature
has released a biological agent.</i>

1316
01:42:13,776 --> 01:42:15,569
<i>All efforts to stop him have failed...</i>

1317
01:42:15,736 --> 01:42:18,947
<i>...and he is now proceeding
north on 7th Avenue. Over.</i>

1318
01:42:22,951 --> 01:42:23,827
- Hi.
- Where are you?

1319
01:42:23,994 --> 01:42:25,287
<i>Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp.</i>

1320
01:42:25,454 --> 01:42:27,206
You have to get out of there now.

1321
01:42:27,373 --> 01:42:29,750
- The antidote is cooking.
- No, no, no.

1322
01:42:29,917 --> 01:42:32,378
<i>Connors is on the way.
He's coming to you right now.</i>

1323
01:42:32,544 --> 01:42:35,089
He needs the device.
He's gonna infect the whole city!

1324
01:42:35,255 --> 01:42:36,423
Eight minutes left.

1325
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:39,134
<i>You're gonna wait eight minutes
after what I told you?</i>

1326
01:42:39,301 --> 01:42:40,636
You leave right now.

1327
01:42:40,803 --> 01:42:41,845
<i>That is an order, okay?</i>

1328
01:42:42,012 --> 01:42:43,097
I'll get everybody out.

1329
01:42:43,263 --> 01:42:44,765
<i>Did you hear wh--?</i>

1330
01:42:44,932 --> 01:42:47,976
Gwen! Gwen! You Mother Hubbard.
Are you serious?

1331
01:43:04,493 --> 01:43:05,661
He's heading south.

1332
01:43:16,422 --> 01:43:18,424
Stand down now, or we will open fire.

1333
01:43:18,590 --> 01:43:20,342
You are surrounded. There is...

1334
01:43:20,509 --> 01:43:21,844
...l"IO BSCBPB

1335
01:43:22,302 --> 01:43:23,721
Go, go!

1336
01:44:25,657 --> 01:44:27,034
Clear!

1337
01:44:27,201 --> 01:44:28,327
Clear up top!

1338
01:44:30,162 --> 01:44:31,413
Clear, sir!

1339
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:32,748
All clear here, sir!

1340
01:44:58,232 --> 01:44:59,775
Freeze!

1341
01:45:00,442 --> 01:45:01,610
Down on the ground.

1342
01:45:01,777 --> 01:45:03,237
Your hands behind your head.

1343
01:45:03,404 --> 01:45:05,030
Now!

1344
01:45:08,409 --> 01:45:09,868
Parker.

1345
01:45:11,745 --> 01:45:12,746
It's headed to Oscorp!

1346
01:45:12,913 --> 01:45:15,290
And your daughter's there right now.

1347
01:45:28,053 --> 01:45:29,346
You gotta let me go.

1348
01:45:43,944 --> 01:45:44,695
Hold your fire!

1349
01:45:51,785 --> 01:45:54,288
Well, Paul, if I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

1350
01:45:54,455 --> 01:45:56,874
I won't venture to say
what it is crawling up...

1351
01:45:57,041 --> 01:45:58,959
...the north side
of the Oscorp Tower...

1352
01:45:59,126 --> 01:46:02,379
...but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

1353
01:46:18,687 --> 01:46:20,689
<i>Time remaining: one minute.</i>

1354
01:47:33,637 --> 01:47:35,723
<i>Antidote complete.</i>

1355
01:47:48,569 --> 01:47:50,279
Oh, man.

1356
01:47:50,446 --> 01:47:53,115
<i>We're getting the latest details.
This is just coming in.</i>

1357
01:47:53,282 --> 01:47:54,950
<i>The New York Police Department...</i>

1358
01:47:55,117 --> 01:47:57,119
<i>...has called for
a city-wide evacuation...</i>

1359
01:47:57,286 --> 01:47:59,246
<i>...everything south of 54th Street.</i>

1360
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:01,874
<i>If you are south of 54th Street...</i>

1361
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:04,501
<i>...you have to move out
of the area immediately.</i>

1362
01:48:13,969 --> 01:48:16,555
<i>Spider-Man appears
to be heading towards Oscorp.</i>

1363
01:48:16,722 --> 01:48:17,765
<i>He looks injured...</i>

1364
01:48:17,931 --> 01:48:20,601
<i>...and it's really not clear
if he's gonna make it.</i>

1365
01:48:20,768 --> 01:48:21,852
<i>That's the guy who...</i>

1366
01:48:22,019 --> 01:48:23,395
...saved my boy on the bridge.

1367
01:48:23,562 --> 01:48:24,938
Troy, they're clearing us out.

1368
01:48:25,105 --> 01:48:27,524
Something bad's
going down in Midtown.

1369
01:48:27,691 --> 01:48:30,277
Still friends with Matthews,
that crane operator on 6th?

1370
01:48:30,444 --> 01:48:32,363
- Yeah.
- Get him on the phone for me.

1371
01:48:32,529 --> 01:48:34,615
The cops are evacuating everybody.

1372
01:48:34,782 --> 01:48:36,992
Get him on the phone for me.

1373
01:48:54,593 --> 01:48:57,221
Hey, Charlie, get me Enrique:
on 54th Street!

1374
01:48:57,388 --> 01:48:59,473
- You got it.
- Angelo, get your mug over here.

1375
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:01,975
Wolski! You're getting some overtime!

<i>Let's give him a clear approach. Over.</i>

1380
01:49:47,646 --> 01:49:49,314
Come on, Parker.

1381
01:51:45,055 --> 01:51:45,764
Hey.

01:51:46,056 --> 01:51:47,141
Dad!

1383
01:51:47,307 --> 01:51:49,476
- I have to get this to Spider-Man.
- Get in.

1384
01:51:49,643 --> 01:51:51,478
- It can stop the Lizard.
- Get in the car.

1385
01:51:51,645 --> 01:51:54,523
- You don't understand!
- Yes, I do.

1386
01:51:54,690 --> 01:51:56,942
Your boyfriend
is a man of many masks.

1387
01:51:57,109 --> 01:51:58,277
I get it.

1388
01:51:58,444 --> 01:51:59,528
Give me this

1389
01:51:59,695 --> 01:52:01,530
Get in the car.

1390
01:52:05,117 --> 01:52:07,202

1426
01:57:28,857 --> 01:57:30,943
- Help's on the way, okay?
- You need to...

1427
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:34,613
You need to be gone
when they get here.

1428
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:36,115
Okay?

1429
01:57:36,281 --> 01:57:37,574
I'm not going anywhere.

1430
01:57:38,158 --> 01:57:40,577
I was wrong about you, Peter.

1431
01:57:41,286 --> 01:57:42,830
This city needs you.

1432
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:46,417
Here.

1433
01:57:46,583 --> 01:57:47,751
You're gonna need this.

1434
01:57:52,172 --> 01:57:54,133
You're gonna make enemies.

1435
01:57:56,552 --> 01:57:58,387
People will get hurt.

1436
01:57:59,972 --> 01:58:01,890
Sometimes the people closest to you.

1437
01:58:05,811 --> 01:58:07,813
So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

1438
01:58:09,732 --> 01:58:13,527
Leave Gwen out of it.

1439
01:58:16,071 --> 01:58:17,698
Promise me that.

1440
01:58:23,328 --> 01:58:24,997
You promise me.

1441
01:59:38,696 --> 01:59:39,947
<i>An eerie calm...</i>

1442
01:59:40,114 --> 01:59:42,157
<i>...has set in over New York City.</i>

1443
01:59:42,324 --> 01:59:43,617
<i>Apparently, some sort of...</i>

1444
01:59:43,784 --> 01:59:46,787
<i>...aerosolised antidote
was launched from...</i>

1445
01:59:46,954 --> 01:59:50,165
<i>...Oscorp Tower, which seems to have
counteracted the biotoxins.</i>

1446
01:59:50,332 --> 01:59:53,293
<i>Residents of Lower Manhattan
can rest peacefully...</i>

1447
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:55,462
<i>...knowing that
the alleged mastermind...</i>

1448
01:59:55,629 --> 01:59:59,258
<i>...of this terror plot,
Dr. Curtis Connors, is behind bars.</i>

1449
01:59:59,425 --> 02:00:00,801
<i>We've got John Niles...</i>

1450
02:00:00,968 --> 02:00:03,387
<i>...on the street for a report
in Lower Manhattan.</i>

1451
02:00:03,554 --> 02:00:05,597
<i>John, what do you see?</i>

1452
02:00:38,464 --> 02:00:40,507
Sweetheart, it's all right.

1453
02:00:42,676 --> 02:00:44,553
It's all right.

1454
02:00:45,637 --> 02:00:47,056
It's all right.

1455
02:00:47,556 --> 02:00:48,515
Rough night.

1456
02:00:50,601 --> 02:00:52,269
It's gonna be all right.

1457
02:01:46,031 --> 02:01:47,741
Where have you been?

1458
02:01:50,744 --> 02:01:52,329
Hi.

1459
02:01:57,167 --> 02:01:58,794
My father died.

1460
02:02:02,756 --> 02:02:04,508
There was a funeral.

1461
02:02:05,968 --> 02:02:07,302
They shot off...

1462
02:02:09,304 --> 02:02:12,057
...rifles and they made speeches.

1463
02:02:15,602 --> 02:02:17,563
Two of my teachers showed up.

1464
02:02:18,981 --> 02:02:20,357
And Flash showed up.

1465
02:02:25,279 --> 02:02:27,906
Everyone was there but you.

1466
02:02:42,504 --> 02:02:44,631
Can't do this. Can't do this.

1467
02:02:46,884 --> 02:02:48,927
I'm sorry. I can't...

1468
02:02:49,094 --> 02:02:50,512
What are you saying?

1469
02:02:50,679 --> 02:02:52,514
I can't see you any more.

1470
02:02:54,475 --> 02:02:55,934
I can't.

1471
02:03:21,543 --> 02:03:23,545
He made you promise, didn't he?

1472
02:03:27,549 --> 02:03:31,428
To stay away from me, so I'd be safe.

1473
02:03:57,913 --> 02:03:58,747
What a pretty...

1474
02:03:58,914 --> 02:03:59,790
...girl.

1475
02:03:59,957 --> 02:04:01,125
Yeah.

1476
02:04:01,291 --> 02:04:03,085
That's what Uncle Ben said.

1477
02:04:04,128 --> 02:04:05,796
Did you ask her out?

1478
02:04:09,550 --> 02:04:10,884
Why?

1479
02:04:11,969 --> 02:04:13,429
Can't.

1480
02:04:14,722 --> 02:04:16,098
Why?

1481
02:04:18,684 --> 02:04:20,394
I'm just no good for her.

1482
02:04:23,564 --> 02:04:27,026
Peter Parker, if there's
one thing you are, it's good.

1483
02:04:28,068 --> 02:04:29,236
Anyone has a problem...

1484
02:04:29,403 --> 02:04:31,113
...with that can talk to me.

1485
02:04:48,839 --> 02:04:51,884
<i>Peter, I know things have been...</i>

1486
02:04:52,051 --> 02:04:53,260
<i>...difficult lately...</i>

1487
02:04:53,427 --> 02:04:55,512
<i>...and I'm sorry about that.</i>

1488
02:04:55,929 --> 02:04:58,891
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

1489
02:04:59,058 --> 02:05:01,643
<i>Ever since you were a little boy...</i>

1490
02:05:01,810 --> 02:05:06,231
<i>...you've been living with
so many unresolved things.</i>

1491
02:05:07,441 --> 02:05:09,735
<i>Well, take it from an old man:</i>

1492
02:05:10,319 --> 02:05:13,405
<i>Those things send us
down a road.</i>

1493
02:05:13,572 --> 02:05:14,656
<i>They make us...</i>

1494
02:05:14,823 --> 02:05:15,908
<i>...who we are.</i>

1495
02:05:16,158 --> 02:05:21,413
<i>And if anyone's destined for greatness,
it's you, son.</i>

1496
02:05:21,997 --> 02:05:24,416
<i>You owe the world your gifts.</i>

1497
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,878
<i>You just have to figure out
how to use them.</i>

1498
02:05:28,420 --> 02:05:31,757
<i>And know that wherever
they take you...</i>

1499
02:05:31,924 --> 02:05:34,218
<i>...we'll always be here.</i>

1500
02:05:35,052 --> 02:05:37,638
<i>So come on home, Peter.</i>

1501
02:05:38,514 --> 02:05:40,349
<i>You're my hero.</i>

1502
02:05:40,516 --> 02:05:42,017
<i>And I love you.</i>

1503
02:05:50,442 --> 02:05:52,152
- What's up, Parker?
- What's up?

1504
02:05:52,319 --> 02:05:53,779
Hey. How's it going?

1505
02:05:54,738 --> 02:05:56,115
You coming along, man?

1506
02:05:57,700 --> 02:05:58,534
Cool shirt.

1507
02:06:00,411 --> 02:06:01,537
Yeah.

1508
02:06:01,704 --> 02:06:03,205
Dude's crazy.

1509
02:06:03,372 --> 02:06:04,748
But chicks dig him.

1510
02:06:07,543 --> 02:06:10,254
Come on, guys, you heard the bell.
Get to class.

1511
02:06:19,722 --> 02:06:22,599
<i>I had a professor once
who liked to tell his students...</i>

1512
02:06:22,766 --> 02:06:26,020
...that there were only 10 different plots
in all of fiction.

1513
02:06:26,979 --> 02:06:29,064
Well, I'm here to tell you
he was wrong.

1514
02:06:29,231 --> 02:06:30,649
There is only one:

1515
02:06:31,567 --> 02:06:33,068
"Who am I"?

1516
02:06:33,777 --> 02:06:35,696
Mr. Parker.

1517
02:06:35,863 --> 02:06:36,864
Tardy again.

1518
02:06:38,824 --> 02:06:40,659
At least we can always count on you.

1519
02:06:40,826 --> 02:06:43,579
Sorry, Miss Ritter,
won't happen again, I promise.

1520
02:06:43,746 --> 02:06:45,831
Don't make promises you can't keep.

1521
02:06:48,083 --> 02:06:50,252
Yeah, but those are the best kind.

1522
02:06:50,419 --> 02:06:52,254
Okay, class, open your books.

1523
02:06:52,421 --> 02:06:54,423
Let's begin on page one.

1524
02:09:49,681 --> 02:09:52,267
Hello, doctor.

1525
02:09:52,434 --> 02:09:53,769
Did you tell the boy?

1526
02:09:53,936 --> 02:09:54,978
Tell him what?

1527
02:09:55,145 --> 02:09:58,899
Did you tell the boy
the truth about his father?

1528
02:10:00,567 --> 02:10:01,443
No.

1529
02:10:01,610 --> 02:10:03,195
Well, that's very good.

1530
02:10:03,529 --> 02:10:04,613
So we'll let him be...

1531
02:10:04,780 --> 02:10:05,739
...for now.

1532
02:10:06,782 --> 02:10:08,867
You should leave him alone!

1533
