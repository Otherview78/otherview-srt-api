1
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:09,714
Okay.

2
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:13,050
Let's talk business.

3
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,346
This fat bastard is trying to
move in on Maurizio's business.

4
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,099
Now, you know Maurizio is a reasonable guy.

5
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,394
He just wants a little conversation.

6
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,981
But this guy, he don't want to hear about it.

7
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,649
Maybe he'll listen to you.

8
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:32,111
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?

9
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,782
Yeah, I'm free Tuesday.

10
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,634
Nice to see you again, Mr. Jones.

11
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:13,027
Remember, neatness counts.
You got one half hour.

12
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,287
One hour.

13
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,926
Yeah, what?

14
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:41,931
It's Tonto, downstairs.
There's a guy who wants to talk to you.

15
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,185
What's he look like?

16
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:49,355
Serious.

17
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:52,691
- Tell him I'm coming up.
- He's coming up.

18
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,989
Somebody's coming up. Somebody serious.

19
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:06,497
Mickey, open your eyes. We got company.

20
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,918
We got company.

21
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,849
Come on.

22
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,526
Stop, stop, man!

23
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,701
Tonto.

24
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:49,456
Tell the driver to wait for us out back,
and hurry up.

25
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,881
- Hey, sweetie, what's going on?
- Don't worry, baby.

26
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,925
It's cool. Take a nap.

27
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:00,694
Oh, my God.

28
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:03,822
Those fuckers blocked both the exits.

29
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,663
Check the terrace!

30
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,971
Hey! Yo!

31
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:56,971
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

32
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,696
- <i>911, Emergency.</i>
- I need help.

33
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,615
- Somebody's trying to kill me.
- <i>All right. Just stay on the line.</i>

34
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,701
<i>I'll just be off a moment.</i>

35
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,079
- <i>Sir, I'm gonna connect you with an officer.</i>
- Okay.

36
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,641
<i>Detective Jefferson. May I help you?</i>

37
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,810
I'll call you back.

38
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:05,277
Hey, relax, man. I got half of Bolivia
sitting in them suitcases over here.

39
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,655
Ain't even cut yet.
Go ahead, take it. It's yours.

40
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,412
Dial this number.

41
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:31,470
I'll talk to you later, sweetie, okay?

42
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,014
Bye.

43
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,146
- Hello?
- <i>It's Maurizio. Remember me?</i>

44
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:45,484
- <i>I see you're back in town.</i>
- Yeah. I mean, no.

45
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,028
Just for today.

46
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,240
<i>So it's safe to say
today's your last day in town</i>

47
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:54,076
<i>and we'll never see
your fat fucking face again.</i>

48
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,994
Yeah. Right.

49
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:59,289
<i>Let me speak to our mutual friend.</i>

50
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,460
He wants to talk to you.

51
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,759
- Yes?
- <i>Make sure he understands,</i>

52
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,761
<i>then let him go.</i>

53
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,188
Do you understand?

54
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,651
- So say it.
- I understand.

55
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,321
Good.

56
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:58,891
Jesus.

57
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,361
Two milk as usual?

58
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,262
Hi.

59
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,476
Why did you hide the cigarette?

60
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,187
This building's full of rats.

61
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:30,941
I didn't want my old man to find out.
Got enough problems.

62
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,953
What happened?

63
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,455
I fell off my bike.

64
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,217
Hey.

65
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,930
Don't tell my dad about the cigarette, okay?

66
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:17,070
- ...why you're doing this to us.
- I don't know...

67
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,740
Funny how people got memory problems
these days. I mean, it must be the sun.

68
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,908
You know, a man should know
when to come out of the sun.

69
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,994
I don't know how it happened.
I mean, what's my job?

70
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,121
I'm just a holder.
I hold the stuff just like you give it to me.

71
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,874
I don't look at it, I don't touch it.
I don't even know how to cut it.

72
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,335
Try and follow me, all right?
In June, we gave you the dope.

73
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,963
It tests 100% pure.
Now it's July, we pick up the dope,

74
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,506
and it tests 90% pure.

75
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,885
Now, somewhere between June and July,
10% turned to cut!

76
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,762
I don't know. It's none of my business.
I'm just a holder.

77
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,306
You give me the stuff, I hold the stuff.
That's all I know.

78
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,933
Hey, look, you know,
I'm trying to help you out here,

79
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,770
but, you know, if you're gonna
be a hard-ass about it...

80
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,647
I gotta disturb him.

81
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:56,610
Now, let me tell you, when he's into
his music, he hates being disturbed.

82
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,529
I'm telling you the truth.

83
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:03,533
I hope so, because he's got a talent
for sniffing out a lie.

84
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,494
It's scary.

85
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,455
It's almost like a sixth sense.

86
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:12,876
Are you gonna change your tune
or I got to bust into his?

87
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,839
I'm telling you the truth.

88
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:26,723
All right.

89
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,519
Stan. Stan.

90
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,651
I'm sorry.
See, he said he didn't cut the dope.

91
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,236
Of course he didn't.

92
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:35,125
Just do me a favor.
Find out who did by tomorrow.

93
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,252
Noon.

94
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,599
Malky, hey, wait.

95
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,810
Hey, I didn't cut your shit.

96
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,271
Find out yourself!

97
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,570
What the hell are you doing out here?
Get inside and do your homework.

98
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,489
- I did it already.
- Oh, yeah? Well, you can get inside

99
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,741
and help your sister
clean up the goddamn house!

100
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,951
And stop smoking cigarettes!

101
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:00,937
<i>One!</i>

102
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:01,563
<i>One!</i>

103
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,316
<i>Two. Take a deep breath in.</i>

104
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,902
<i>Take a deep breath out.</i>

105
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,822
- <i>Take a deep breath. Inhale.</i>
- Time's up. My turn.

106
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,158
Change the channel,
and I'll smash your face.

107
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,744
<i>So ready for the legs. And down.</i>

108
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,621
<i>Down! Down!</i>

109
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,757
Sorry, sweetheart.

110
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,468
<i>Squeeze. Release.</i>

111
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,970
Good morning, sweetie.

112
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,598
Hi, honey.

113
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:41,353
Sweetheart, turn that down.
Mama's got a headache.

114
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,063
She took my turn.

115
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,315
She just wants to watch
these goddamn cartoons!

116
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,942
It wouldn't hurt her to move her ass a bit.

117
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,402
I'm not the one with a fat ass around here.

118
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,987
<i>Two and up.</i>

119
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,990
Can someone who's doing nothing
all day but watching cartoons

120
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,534
move a little ass and go get some food?

121
00:17:56,618 --> 00:18:00,789
- <i>Legs. Legs. Beautiful.</i>
- I dare you to say that again.

122
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,714
- Margie, I think I screwed up.
- It wouldn't be the first time.

123
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,591
I mean, you always come up
with something, right?

124
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:15,345
Yeah. I think I went a little too far this time.

125
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,932
I think you're going a little too far right now.
I'm gonna be late for work.

126
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,434
What about working at home today?

127
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:26,272
<i>Really feel it. That's it, stomach in.</i>

128
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,777
<i>-One...
- Now it's my turn!</i>

129
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,405
Shit! She's gonna hit me!

130
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,616
- Daddy, she's...
- Shit! Shut the goddamn door!

131
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,452
<i>Please don't shoot!</i>

132
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,789
Fucking bitch.

133
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,377
<i>-Megatron! Megatron!
- Firm up the whole body.</i>

134
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:52,799
<i>When you use your quadriceps, your thigh
muscles have warmed up your body...</i>

135
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,927
- Hey, can somebody answer the phone?
- I'm busy!

136
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,978
- Hello?
- <i>This is Marguerite McCallister,</i>

137
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,732
<i>headmistress at the Spencer School
in Wildwood, New Jersey.</i>

138
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,568
<i>Is Mr. or Mrs. Lando home?</i>

139
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,740
Yes, this is she.

140
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,618
<i>Mrs. Lando, when your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer,</i>

141
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,954
<i>he told us she had "problems."</i>

142
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,623
<i>Well, as you know, we pride ourselves
in turning troubled girls</i>

143
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,834
<i>into healthy, productive young women.</i>

144
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,837
<i>But if they are not here,
there is very little we can do.</i>

145
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,174
<i>Now, Mathilda left school
without permission nearly two weeks ago.</i>

146
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:37,135
<i>I know your husband paid tuition
in advance for a year,</i>

147
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:41,347
<i>but if you will refer to Page 20 in the rules
and regulations manual we sent you,</i>

148
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:45,351
<i>you will see that unless there is
a valid excuse for prolonged absence,</i>

149
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,645
<i>your tuition will be forfeit.</i>

150
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,773
She's dead.

151
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,881
Tell that fucking kid to do
a little work around here!

152
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,551
Clean up! I'm tired of this fucking mess.

153
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,345
Hurry up!

154
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,810
Taxi!

155
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:30,248
Is life always this hard,
or is it just when you're a kid?

156
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,129
Always like this.

157
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,012
Keep it.

158
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:55,148
Hey, I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?

159
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,902
One quart or two? It's two, right?

160
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,425
I like these calm little moments
before the storm.

161
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,804
It reminds me of Beethoven.

162
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,395
Can you hear it?

163
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:01,858
It's like when you put your head
to the grass,

164
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,278
you can hear it growing.

165
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,363
You can hear the insects.

166
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,414
- Do you like Beethoven?
- Couldn't really say.

167
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,458
I'm gonna play you some.

168
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,213
Daddy!

169
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,060
Benny, stay here.

170
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,902
Daddy! Daddy!

171
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,269
We said noon.

172
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:26,609
I've got one minute past.

173
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,323
You don't like Beethoven.

174
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,910
You don't know what you're missing.

175
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:39,330
Overtures like that get my juices flowing.

176
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,874
So powerful.

177
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,920
But after his openings, to be honest,

178
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:50,299
he does tend to get a little fucking boring.

179
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,513
That's why I stopped!

180
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,811
Toss the apartment.

181
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:26,085
You're a Mozart fan. I love him, too.

182
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,422
I love Mozart!

183
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:37,054
He was Austrian, you know.

184
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:40,766
But for this kind of work,
he's a little bit light.

185
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,312
So I tend to go for the heavier guys.

186
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:48,316
- Cool.
- Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

187
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,902
Man, keep your bumbaclot mouth shut.

188
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,197
Check out Brahms. He's good, too.

189
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:58,451
- What the fuck do you know about music?
- Man, knock it off!

190
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,634
- You check the mattress?
- Nope.

191
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,844
Wow.

192
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:21,742
Fuck!

193
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:23,160
Stan.

194
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,915
Jesus. Look what you did.

195
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:31,252
- Stan, you all right? Stan.
- Look what you did!

196
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:35,464
Stan!

197
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,230
Hey, Stan, what are you doing?

198
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,733
What are you doing? He's dead!

199
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,651
But he ruined my suit.

200
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,904
Yeah, I know, but he's dead.

201
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:02,199
He's a piece of meat.
Forget about it. Calm down.

202
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,076
I'm calm.

203
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,413
- Stay there, all right?
- Okay.

204
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:13,210
Benny! Benny!

205
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:19,342
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!
It's Malky and Stan!

206
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,721
Take it easy, all right?

207
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,099
Benny!

208
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:31,312
Come on, let's get a cigarette, all right?

209
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,939
Benny, we're coming out!

210
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,693
Benny, don't fire! Get in there!

211
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:42,239
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!

212
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:45,409
- You wear something new and...
- You got a light?

213
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,996
Take it easy. Stay out there.

214
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,290
What's happening out there?

215
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:53,501
It's all right, ma'am. Go in. DEA. Police.

216
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,795
Why don't you leave that poor family alone?

217
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:59,799
- Everything's all right. Just calm down.
- I am calm. I'm calm.

218
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:02,426
Why don't you leave them alone?

219
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,722
He said go back inside.

220
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,230
Stan, I think it's better if we go inside,
all right?

221
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:36,085
Benny, turn that kitchen upside down!
Find that shit!

222
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:40,923
Willy Blood, look what you did!
You killed a four-year-old kid!

223
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,926
Did you really have to do that?

224
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,735
Please open the door.

225
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,117
Please.

226
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,542
Please.

227
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,294
Benny, there are three kids here.

228
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,422
I think Stan killed this girl.

229
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:06,217
And Willy, that asshole, shot the little boy.

230
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:08,761
The third one's missing. Find her.

231
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,856
Shit. Hey, we missed a little girl, man.

232
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,944
I'm gonna try to find the fucking super
in this goddamn building.

233
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:55,057
<i>-Don't you recognize me?
- Me, Grimlock. Know you!</i>

234
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,402
Shit.

235
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,740
- Yo! I found it!
- Bingo!

236
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:14,493
- Stan, they found it.
- I know.

237
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,912
There it is.

238
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,291
There's cops outside. We better go.

239
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,627
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.

240
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:29,091
What do you want me to tell them?

241
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:42,229
Tell them we were doing

242
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:45,566
our job.

243
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:58,162
- What's your name?
- Mathilda.

244
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,463
- Sorry about your father.
- If somebody didn't do it

245
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:11,175
one day or another,
I would have probably done it myself.

246
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:15,554
- Your mother, she...
- She's not my mother.

247
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:21,143
My sister, she wanted to lose some weight
anyway. Bet she never looked better.

248
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:24,647
She's not even my real sister.
Just a half sister.

249
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,690
Not a good half at that.

250
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,036
If you couldn't stand them,
why are you crying?

251
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,413
Because they killed my brother.

252
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:45,709
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.

253
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:48,587
He never used to cry.

254
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:51,548
He just used to sit next to me and cuddle.

255
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:57,763
I was more of a mother to him
than that goddamned pig ever was.

256
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:02,351
Hey, don't talk like that about pigs.
They're usually much nicer than people.

257
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,478
But they smell like shit.

258
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,856
Not true.

259
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,778
As a matter of fact,
right now I have one in my kitchen,

260
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,780
that's very clean,

261
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:18,659
- and smells very nice.
- You don't have a pig in your kitchen.

262
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:22,287
Yes, I do.

263
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:25,541
I was just in there,
and I didn't see any goddamn pig.

264
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,252
Don't move. I'll get him.

265
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,215
Piggy, Piggy, where are you?

266
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,010
There you are.

267
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:45,561
Hi, Mathilda.

268
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:48,063
Hi, Piggy.

269
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:59,074
How are you today?

270
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,119
I've seen better days.

271
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:13,797
- What's your name?
- Leon.

272
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,927
Cute name.

273
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:28,896
You have anyone to go to,
any family anyplace else?

274
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,577
I'm gonna get some more milk.

275
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,472
Holy shit.

276
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:11,814
Don't touch that, please.

277
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:15,400
Leon, what exactly do you do for a living?

278
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,320
Cleaner.

279
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,325
- You mean you're a hit man?
- Yeah.

280
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:26,829
Cool.

281
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:43,512
- Do you clean anyone?
- No women, no kids. That's the rules.

282
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:47,141
How much would it cost to hire someone
to get those dirt bags

283
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,101
who killed my brother?

284
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:52,521
- Five grand a head.
- Wow.

285
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:57,651
How about this? I work for you,

286
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:01,363
and in exchange,
you teach me how to clean?

287
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,741
What do you think?

288
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:06,994
I'll clean your place. I'll do the shopping.

289
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,204
I'll even wash your clothes.

290
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:14,459
- Is it a deal?
- No, it's not a deal.

291
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:26,847
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.

292
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,893
You've had a rough day today.

293
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:37,149
Go to sleep, and we'll see tomorrow. Okay?

294
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:54,166
You've been really great with me, Leon,

295
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,501
and it's not always like that.

296
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,712
You know?

297
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,639
Good night.

298
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:28,844
Sleep well? Good.

299
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,846
Because after breakfast you got to take off.

300
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,931
- Where to?
- Not my problem.

301
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,033
Read it.

302
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,583
You don't know how to read.

303
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,586
I'm learning, but I've had a lot of work lately,

304
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:05,422
so I'm a little behind.

305
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,257
What's it say?

306
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:11,136
I've decided what to do with my life.
I want to be a cleaner.

307
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:16,433
You want to be a cleaner. Here. Take it.

308
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:20,771
It's a goodbye gift.
Go clean, but not with me.

309
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:24,316
- I work alone. Understand? Alone.
- Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

310
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:28,153
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
And they were the best.

311
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:32,866
Mathilda, why are you doing this to me?

312
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,827
I've been nothing but nice to you.

313
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:39,331
I even saved your life yesterday,
right outside the door.

314
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,167
Right. So now you're responsible for it.

315
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:46,171
If you saved my life,
you must've saved it for a good reason.

316
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:49,007
If you throw me out now,
it's like you never opened your door,

317
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:52,177
like you let me die right there in front of it.

318
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,931
But you did open it. So...

319
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,851
Mathilda...

320
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:04,106
If you don't help me, I'll die tonight.
I can feel it.

321
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,484
Now, I don't want to die tonight.

322
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,530
Mathilda, you're just a little girl.

323
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:15,242
So don't take it badly,
but I don't think you could do it.

324
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,660
I'm sorry.

325
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,097
How's that?

326
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,588
Mathilda.

327
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:14,468
Don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.

328
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:17,137
- You got that?
- Okay.

329
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,307
I don't work like that. It's not professional.

330
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:23,393
- There is rules.
- Okay.

331
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,563
And stop saying "okay" all the time, okay?

332
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:28,982
Okay.

333
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:30,775
Good.

334
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:44,956
Hi.

335
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,377
You expect to use that in this hotel?

336
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:53,590
Mister, I have to use it,

337
00:43:53,924 --> 00:43:57,719
because I have an audition
at Juilliard next month

338
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,180
and I have to practice.

339
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:03,808
Okay, okay, okay, but not after 10:00.

340
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,728
- Okay, I promise.
- All right.

341
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,774
I'll put you at the end of the hall,

342
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,985
so that you don't disturb anyone.

343
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,322
And would you fill those out, please?

344
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:26,122
Daddy, can I please fill them out?
You know how I like to check in to hotels.

345
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:32,462
Thanks, Pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.

346
00:44:32,546 --> 00:44:35,423
- Fourth floor!
- Thanks, mister!

347
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:40,220
You're lucky to have a little girl
that's interested in things.

348
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,766
I have a kid, 17, does nothing all day long.

349
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:54,276
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?

350
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,777
Of course.

351
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:03,159
Hi.

352
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:19,968
I'm putting in a name of a girl
in my class who makes me sick.

353
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:25,265
If things get hot, she'll take the heat.

354
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:46,995
- There. Finished.
- How old are you?

355
00:45:47,621 --> 00:45:50,624
- 18.
- 18?

356
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:54,377
- Want to see my license?
- No.

357
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:59,507
- Just look a little younger.
- Thanks.

358
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,019
Leon, I want you to teach me
how to be like you.

359
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:15,190
- I want to be strong like you, smart like you.
- Mathilda.

360
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,692
I know I'm not strong enough yet,

361
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,696
but I could learn the basics, the theory.

362
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:25,450
What do you think? Just the theory.

363
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,079
I need this, Leon.

364
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,791
I need time to get my head together.

365
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,459
Yeah, and I need

366
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,134
a drink.

367
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,262
Don't move. I'll go get one.

368
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:14,666
You know, when you told me
to get this baby out for you,

369
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,918
I thought my hearing's going.

370
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:21,506
I says to myself, "Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that except beginners."

371
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:23,842
I like to stay in shape.

372
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:27,387
Sure. Always stay on top.

373
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:31,474
It's like me. I got to know
where everything is all the time.

374
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:35,812
That's why I never leave this place,
except to go from here to there.

375
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,984
Change ain't good, Leon. You know?

376
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:46,239
Yeah.

377
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:53,329
Check it.

378
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,625
- Make sure it's the right thing.
- I trust you.

379
00:47:57,709 --> 00:48:01,796
One thing's got nothing to do with the other.
Remember that, Leon.

380
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:03,673
I will.

381
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:22,150
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use,

382
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:25,695
because it lets you
keep your distance from the client.

383
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:28,198
The closer you get to being a pro,

384
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:30,867
the closer you can get to the client.

385
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,996
The knife, for example,
is the last thing you learn.

386
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:39,125
- Okay?
- Okay.

387
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,212
Position.

388
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,193
No.

389
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:10,114
Never take it off until the last minute.
It reflects light.

390
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:13,368
They can see you coming from a mile away.

391
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:16,496
And always dress down.

392
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:21,084
- Never brighter than the floor, okay?
- Okay.

393
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,756
Let's practice now. It's the best way to learn.

394
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,969
- Who should I hit?
- Whoever.

395
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,061
I'll be with you in a second.
Give me a few minutes.

396
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:41,688
Thank you. Thanks a lot.
You guys in the suits get lost.

397
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:43,523
I don't want to see you, all right?

398
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:46,901
- <i>Is everyone in position?</i>
- This has to look natural.

399
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:59,205
- No women, no kids, right?
- Right.

400
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:10,258
- Jogger in the yellow and orange?
- Okay.

401
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:15,722
Keep calm.

402
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:22,270
Don't take your eyes off him.

403
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,440
Breathe easy.

404
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:29,152
Watch his movement.

405
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,781
Pretend you're running with him.

406
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,954
Try to feel his next movement.

407
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,833
Take a deep breath. Hold it.

408
00:50:53,635 --> 00:50:56,512
- Now.
- Oh, my God!

409
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,598
- Get down!
- I'm all right. I'm fine. I'm fine.

410
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,892
Get down! Get down!
Where'd that come from?

411
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,852
One shot. Not bad, huh?

412
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,564
What the hell? I'm fine.
I just can't breathe! Get off of me.

413
00:51:06,648 --> 00:51:09,651
- Stay down!
- Can we try with real bullets now?

414
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,820
Not today. Let's pack up.

415
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:22,997
They go like that.

416
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,292
Here. After...

417
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:08,876
- No, thanks.
- No discussion.

418
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,295
"It seemed

419
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:55,882
"to Socrates..."

420
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:01,429
"To Socrates..."

421
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:05,391
I'll do it.

422
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,949
Leon, all we do is work.

423
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:25,453
We need a break. Let's play a game.

424
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,373
- What kind of game?
- I have this great game.

425
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:33,711
It makes you think and it helps your memory.
It's exactly what you need.

426
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:37,298
Okay.

427
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,893
<i>Like a virgin</i>

428
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:52,980
<i>Touched for the very first time</i>

429
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:56,818
<i>Like a virgin</i>

430
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,738
- Okay, who is it?
- I don't know.

431
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:03,491
Okay.

432
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:15,753
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

433
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:21,175
<i>Happy birthday, Mr. President</i>

434
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:22,969
I don't know.

435
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:34,021
Moustache.

436
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:38,276
No.

437
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:41,863
<i>I'm singing in the rain</i>

438
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:44,824
<i>Just singing in the rain</i>

439
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:46,450
<i>What a...</i>

440
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:47,535
Gene Kelly?

441
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,039
Good. Your turn now.

442
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,631
Okay, pilgrim.

443
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:06,053
Clint Eastwood?

444
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:16,564
- I don't know. I give up.
- John Wayne.

445
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:21,652
I was just about to say that.
I swear. It's amazing.

446
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:23,696
Leon, really brilliant.

447
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:27,742
Amazing.

448
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:46,761
- You love your plant, don't you?
- It's my best friend.

449
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,514
Always happy. No questions.

450
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:54,894
It's like me, you see.

451
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:57,730
No roots.

452
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:01,025
If you really love it, you should
plant it in the middle of a park,

453
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:03,152
so that it can have roots.

454
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,238
Yeah.

455
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:10,034
I'm the one you should be watering
if you want me to grow.

456
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:12,912
You're right.

457
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:22,505
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

458
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:25,174
Wait! Stop!

459
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:37,186
Stop. Stop!

460
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:44,026
They gotta be jumping out of the plate.
They gotta be alive.

461
00:56:52,994 --> 00:56:55,162
It's been a long time, Leon.

462
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:02,920
I missed you.

463
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:07,383
- And you missed some nice jobs, too.
- Been training.

464
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,846
Training's good, but don't overdo it.

465
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:15,016
You know, training don't pay
as good as working, Leon.

466
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:16,225
Tony.

467
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:23,566
All the money I make, that you keep for me...

468
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:26,944
- You need some money?
- No. Just curious.

469
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:32,324
Because I've been working a long time
and I haven't done anything with my money.

470
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:40,291
I thought maybe someday I could use it.

471
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:43,919
You met a woman.

472
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:50,509
Leon.

473
00:57:53,054 --> 00:57:55,723
Leon, you got to be careful with women.

474
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,142
Remember when you arrived
in this country, Leon?

475
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:02,271
When I took you in, you were still
wet behind the fucking ears,

476
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:05,691
and already you were in deep shit
because of a woman.

477
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:09,111
- Don't forget that, Leon.
- I wish I could sometimes.

478
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:15,242
You know, about my money,

479
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:18,996
maybe I could give

480
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:21,457
a little

481
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,044
to someone.

482
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:28,672
You know, to help out.

483
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:35,513
Hey, it's your money. I mean, I'm just
holding it for you, you know, like a bank.

484
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:37,765
Except, you know, better than a bank,

485
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,059
because, you know,
banks always get knocked off.

486
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:42,478
You know, no one knocks off old Tony.

487
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:44,605
And besides, with a bank,

488
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:48,609
there's always tons of forms to be filled
and all that shit.

489
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:53,781
But old Tony, nothing to read,
nothing to write. It's all in his head.

490
00:58:54,782 --> 00:58:56,742
I know how to read now.

491
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:02,623
That's good, Leon. Good.

492
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:09,547
Your money's here. Whenever you want it,
you just ask me. Okay?

493
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,091
- Here's a grand. No, no. Come on.
- It's okay. I don't need it.

494
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:13,968
- Come on. Take it. Have some fun.
- No.

495
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:16,387
- Go ahead. Take it.
- Thank you.

496
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:21,225
All right. Now let's talk business.

497
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,769
Don't move. I'll go get the file.

498
00:59:25,104 --> 00:59:28,190
Manolo, a glass of milk
for my friend Leon here.

499
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:54,842
Listen, Mathilda, you better be careful.

500
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:58,012
You can't just speak
to any guy off the street.

501
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:01,724
Leon, get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?

502
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:04,810
I was just smoking a butt
while I was waiting.

503
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:08,355
I want you to stop cursing.

504
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:10,858
You can't talk to people
like that all the time.

505
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,777
I want you to make an effort to talk nice.

506
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:16,739
Okay.

507
01:00:18,616 --> 01:00:21,869
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.

508
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:25,206
Okay.

509
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:31,378
Stay away from him. He looks like a weirdo.

510
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:34,882
Okay.

511
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,845
I'll be out in five minutes.
Stand where I can see you.

512
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,640
Okay.

513
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:57,571
Leon, I think I'm kind of
falling in love with you.

514
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:03,285
It's the first time for me, you know.

515
01:01:04,245 --> 01:01:06,914
How do you know it's love
if you've never been in love before?

516
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,458
'Cause I feel it.

517
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:12,253
Where?

518
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:17,007
In my stomach.

519
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:21,220
It's all warm.

520
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:28,602
I always had a knot there,
and now it's gone.

521
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:35,734
Mathilda, I'm glad you don't
have a stomach ache anymore.

522
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,321
I don't think it means anything.

523
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:43,033
I'm late for work. I hate being late for work.

524
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:29,997
Hey. How's the practicing going?

525
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:04,823
- And how are we today, miss?
- A little sick of practicing.

526
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:06,367
Yeah, I understand.

527
01:03:07,368 --> 01:03:08,952
But you're doing all right.

528
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:11,246
I haven't received any complaints at all.

529
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:15,459
Well, I put a cloth over the strings
to lessen the noise.

530
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:18,462
That's very smart.

531
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:21,048
- Not everyone loves music.
- I know.

532
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:24,760
What exactly does your father do?

533
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,890
- He's a composer.
- That's wonderful.

534
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:33,143
Except he's not really my father.

535
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:40,859
He's my lover.

536
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:46,657
Think I'll go for a walk.

537
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:06,176
- What are you doing Saturday night?
- What about dinner?

538
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:09,680
- Hey, where are you going?
- Visiting friends at 6J.

539
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,057
Okay. Go ahead. So, what about Saturday?

540
01:04:12,141 --> 01:04:14,893
- About 8:00?
- I don't know.

541
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:16,770
You got plans?

542
01:04:25,446 --> 01:04:26,947
I'll meet you here?

543
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:45,567
We know you're a busy man, and
we'll try to make this as short as possible.

544
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:49,404
Now, if you'll just take us step-by-step
through exactly what happened.

545
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:52,407
The guy was here. He went for his gun.

546
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,368
Bang, we shot him.

547
01:05:58,247 --> 01:06:00,958
- Where exactly were the kids?
- I don't know!

548
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:03,627
They should have been at school,
don't you think?

549
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,046
But in your statement
you said you were the first man in.

550
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:07,965
- Didn't you see any kids?
- The door was broken.

551
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:10,968
What happened?
Did you follow the procedure?

552
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:15,722
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?

553
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:17,266
Cooperation.

554
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:25,232
I haven't got time
for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!

555
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:29,653
You want cooperation?
Come up in my office, Room 4602.

556
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:43,792
- Kids should be at school.
- Hey.

557
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:46,628
- Hey.
- Hey. Come on, that's my ball!

558
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:51,133
Hey, give that back.
Come on, where you going?

559
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:54,678
Damn! Where you going, man?
That's my ball!

560
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:03,812
Follow the blue car.

561
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:06,857
And I suppose you want me to blast
the music and go through the lights?

562
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,859
No, you're gonna drive slowly.

563
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:11,403
Take the hundred bucks,
and shut the fuck up, okay?

564
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:47,564
<i>I do not want to fight you,
but you leave me no choice.</i>

565
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:53,487
<i>Boss, you just gave me a great idea!</i>

566
01:07:58,283 --> 01:07:59,826
<i>But I mean a big one!</i>

567
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,787
<i>Welcome back to E! News Daily,</i>

568
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,831
<i>our 30-minute look at the latest
in entertainment news.</i>

569
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:06,083
<i>I'm Bianca Ferrar.</i>

570
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:14,549
It's for you. A present.

571
01:08:17,094 --> 01:08:20,055
Do you want me to open it? I'll open it.

572
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:27,562
How do you like it? Nice, eh?

573
01:08:29,523 --> 01:08:31,024
Mr. McGuffin?

574
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:36,196
Can I have a word with you?

575
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:59,404
Here. It's for a contract. Twenty grand, right?

576
01:09:59,488 --> 01:10:02,282
His name is Norman Stansfield,
and he's in Room 4602

577
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:05,035
in the DEA building, 26 Federal Plaza.

578
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:08,622
- I'm not taking it.
- Why not?

579
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,708
- Too heavy.
- Well...

580
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:14,169
Would you rent me your gear for the day?

581
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:16,254
I never lend out my gear.

582
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,550
But you still have your gun. Use it.

583
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:24,012
Just do me a favor.
Don't shoot out the window. Okay?

584
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:26,223
Why are you so mean to me?

585
01:10:28,183 --> 01:10:30,769
Wildly killing people
you don't give a shit about.

586
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:34,105
But you won't get the bastards
that killed my whole family?

587
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:37,818
Revenge is not good
once you're done. Believe.

588
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:41,112
- It's better to forget.
- To forget?

589
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,157
After I've seen the outline
of my brother's body on the floor,

590
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:46,243
you expect me to forget?

591
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:48,912
I want to kill those sons of bitches.

592
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:50,664
I'm gonna blow their fucking heads off.

593
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,708
Nothing's the same
after you've killed someone.

594
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:57,838
Your life is changed forever.

595
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:04,052
You have to sleep with one eye open
for the rest of your life.

596
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:06,805
I don't give a shit about sleeping, Leon.

597
01:11:07,848 --> 01:11:10,684
I want love or death.

598
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:14,479
That's it.

599
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:17,899
Love or death.

600
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:22,487
Get off my case, Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.

601
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,493
There's a really great game, Leon.

602
01:11:28,577 --> 01:11:31,371
Makes people nicer. Starts them thinking.

603
01:11:36,293 --> 01:11:38,336
The kind of game you love.

604
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:56,146
If I win, you keep me with you for life.

605
01:11:59,274 --> 01:12:00,692
And if you lose?

606
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:03,194
Go shopping alone, like before.

607
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:08,408
You're gonna lose, Mathilda.

608
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:13,163
There's a round in the chamber. I heard it.

609
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:14,497
So what?

610
01:12:14,706 --> 01:12:17,751
What's it to you if I end up
with a bullet in the head?

611
01:12:20,462 --> 01:12:21,713
Nothing.

612
01:12:25,634 --> 01:12:27,636
I hope you're not lying, Leon.

613
01:12:29,471 --> 01:12:33,141
I really hope that deep down inside
there's no love in you.

614
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:40,440
Because if there is
just a little bit of love in you for me,

615
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:47,322
I think that in a few minutes
you'll regret you never said anything.

616
01:12:56,623 --> 01:12:58,249
I love you, Leon.

617
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,768
I win.

618
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:36,621
I took a hit.

619
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,582
I need a hand now.

620
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:43,253
I know she's young, but she learns fast.

621
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:46,798
Kids need to be shaped
into something, right?

622
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:50,260
Yeah, I know. I taught you that.
But ain't there an age limit?

623
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:52,971
- She's 18.
- Really?

624
01:13:57,434 --> 01:13:59,853
How about something to drink, Tony?

625
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:03,148
Yeah, sure. Manolo, glass of milk for Leon.

626
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:07,068
Nice tattoo.

627
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:14,826
Manolo, make that two.

628
01:14:35,055 --> 01:14:37,849
- What's that for?
- Can't afford to catch cold.

629
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:40,977
First you find out where the chain is.

630
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:44,064
You can't see it, but you can feel it. Here.

631
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:47,400
- I'll ring, you start talking.
- What do I say?

632
01:14:48,276 --> 01:14:49,986
Whatever you want.

633
01:14:52,781 --> 01:14:54,240
- Yes?
- Hi.

634
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:55,950
It's Susan.

635
01:14:57,077 --> 01:14:58,995
I'm sorry.
You must have the wrong door, little girl.

636
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:00,830
I don't know any Susan.

637
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:04,918
Move back a little. I can't see anything.

638
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,587
The light's out.

639
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:11,174
It's all dark out here.

640
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:16,179
Mister, I'm scared.

641
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,390
Okay. Okay.

642
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:25,105
What the fuck are you doing?

643
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:32,487
Open up.

644
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:37,200
If it leaves your mouth, I'll pull the trigger.

645
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:18,408
Here's okay. Let it go. I said let it go.

646
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,494
Move. Move over.

647
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:24,747
Easy. Easy.

648
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:27,667
Easy. Careful. You want me...

649
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:32,088
Go ahead. Your turn.

650
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:41,389
Help me. Please don't beat me.

651
01:16:42,307 --> 01:16:44,517
Sir? Sir?

652
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:49,355
Sir? Sir, it's not my dope.

653
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:51,774
Sir, look I...

654
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:53,735
A little left, please.

655
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:58,781
Before... Please...

656
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:03,203
Okay. Now, the security shot.

657
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,003
No, the second goes higher on the chest.

658
01:17:12,212 --> 01:17:14,339
Aim for the heart and lungs.

659
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,716
There. Right there. You see?

660
01:17:16,883 --> 01:17:18,801
The first shot takes him out of order.

661
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:20,845
- The second finishes him off.
- What the fuck...

662
01:17:20,929 --> 01:17:23,014
- What are you fucking doing?
- Never in the face.

663
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:26,309
If they can't recognize the client,
you don't get paid.

664
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:30,104
Because you could take out anybody
and said you did the job.

665
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:32,732
- Got it?
- Got it. Never in the face.

666
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:35,985
- Okay. Now you can put the tools away.
- What are you fucking doing?

667
01:17:36,069 --> 01:17:38,821
What the fuck is going on? Hey, mister!

668
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:42,075
What are you fucking...

669
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:49,249
You see, when you use the silencer a lot
you have to put a piece of cloth here,

670
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:52,335
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.

671
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:54,796
A damp, black cloth is the best.

672
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,134
What you doing?

673
01:18:01,636 --> 01:18:03,680
We said no women, no kids.

674
01:18:03,972 --> 01:18:07,558
Who do you think this is gonna kill,
junkies and monkeys?

675
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,159
Now it's clean.

676
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:29,372
Let's get out of here.

677
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:45,930
I thought we don't have the right to drink.

678
01:18:46,014 --> 01:18:49,642
I know, but we're making
an exception for your first time.

679
01:18:51,102 --> 01:18:54,939
Well, if we're making exceptions
for a job well done,

680
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:59,277
how about a kiss, like in the movies?

681
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:02,655
No.

682
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:05,158
Yes.

683
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,413
- What you doing?
- I'm going to kiss you.

684
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:11,956
Mathilda, stop, please.

685
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,833
Come on. Just a kiss.

686
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,502
Stop. Everyone is watching us.

687
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:21,090
Go sit down.

688
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:30,975
Enjoy.

689
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:40,360
- You don't believe me, do you?
- How's that?

690
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:42,653
When I say I'm in love with you.

691
01:19:42,737 --> 01:19:46,866
Mathilda, please drop it.
Just change the subject, okay?

692
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,743
Okay, okay. Sorry.

693
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:53,206
So how old were you
when you made your first hit?

694
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,833
Nineteen.

695
01:19:57,877 --> 01:19:59,212
Beat you.

696
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:06,571
- What you doing?
- Can't afford to catch a cold.

697
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:57,330
- There's no doorbell.
- So knock on the door.

698
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:04,295
- Yes?
- Hi.

699
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:07,924
I'm looking for Mr. Reuben's apartment,

700
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:10,927
but it's all dark out here in the hall,
and I'm lost.

701
01:22:13,763 --> 01:22:15,306
Just a second.

702
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:28,736
You want more? Come on.
Show your fucking face.

703
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:30,947
You think you're going to get me
that easily?

704
01:22:34,492 --> 01:22:36,577
Fuck you. Motherfucker.

705
01:22:36,911 --> 01:22:39,539
When it's tough like this,
you know it's gonna be ugly.

706
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:43,709
Better make it quick or else
we'll be all day listening to his crap.

707
01:22:43,793 --> 01:22:46,879
Asshole! Come on,
show me your fucking face, faggot!

708
01:22:46,963 --> 01:22:48,965
- Come on, gum trick.
- Hey.

709
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,426
What about the ring trick?
You know that one?

710
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:56,430
Ring trick? Come on, asshole. I'm waiting.
Show it to me, motherfucker.

711
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:08,150
That's the ring trick.

712
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:27,086
Mario, go back to the barbershop.
We'll finish later.

713
01:23:38,598 --> 01:23:41,726
Hey, Leon, what's up? All done already?

714
01:23:42,435 --> 01:23:43,603
No, no.

715
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:46,772
Nicer than people, eh?

716
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,525
I told you that.

717
01:23:52,028 --> 01:23:53,946
- You got a problem?
- No.

718
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:59,452
Get the chair. Sit down. Sit.

719
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:07,501
I was thinking.

720
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:14,425
If something happens to me someday...

721
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:18,054
Hey, Leon, nothing's gonna happen to you.

722
01:24:18,471 --> 01:24:21,474
You're indestructible. Bullets slide off you.
You play with them.

723
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:25,144
Tony, I thought about my money.

724
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:34,654
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?

725
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:36,822
Yeah.

726
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:42,828
Her name is Mathilda.

727
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,332
If anything happens to me,

728
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:50,961
I'd like you

729
01:24:52,922 --> 01:24:54,298
to give her

730
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:58,260
my money.

731
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:04,016
You can count on me, Leon.

732
01:25:04,684 --> 01:25:06,602
- Thank you, Tony.
- Yeah.

733
01:25:10,398 --> 01:25:12,024
I won't be long.

734
01:25:13,776 --> 01:25:16,028
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

735
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:20,116
This one is too big.

736
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:24,704
Yeah, and I only get the leftovers, is that it?

737
01:25:26,706 --> 01:25:30,501
Mathilda, since I met you,
everything's been different.

738
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:34,964
So I just need some time alone.

739
01:25:38,718 --> 01:25:41,137
You need some time to grow up a little.

740
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,389
I finished growing up, Leon.

741
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:45,474
I just get older.

742
01:25:45,558 --> 01:25:48,352
For me it's the opposite. I'm old enough.

743
01:25:50,563 --> 01:25:52,481
I need time to grow up.

744
01:26:07,705 --> 01:26:08,789
Shit.

745
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:27,576
Come on! Come on! Come on! Hustle!

746
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:30,621
- Good shot.
- Come on.

747
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:37,378
You're new, aren't you? Fifth floor, right?

748
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:40,047
- You know, you can't sit here like that.
- Really, why not?

749
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:42,842
Nothing's free. Like a parking meter.

750
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:45,511
When you stop, you pay. It's the law.

751
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:48,013
- Only on TV.
- What'd you say?

752
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:51,308
- Forget it. How much is your meter?
- Ten dollars,

753
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:53,143
a month.

754
01:27:55,813 --> 01:27:57,189
Got change?

755
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:01,026
Don't worry about it. We'll do 10 for 12.

756
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:04,029
I'll pay now for the rest of the year, okay?

757
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:05,698
Okay, a year.

758
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:09,243
Does paying rent here mean
I have to put up with you guys?

759
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:11,537
No.

760
01:28:12,538 --> 01:28:14,540
So go play somewhere else.

761
01:28:18,294 --> 01:28:19,962
I need to think.

762
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,731
Stand up. What, you don't like your job?

763
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:31,951
Food.

764
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:40,250
- Where you going?
- Special delivery, Room 4602.

765
01:29:40,626 --> 01:29:41,961
Sign here.

766
01:29:42,336 --> 01:29:43,671
Come here.

767
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:50,135
- Have a nice weekend, girls.
- Thanks.

768
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:52,930
I'm gonna go to the restroom.

769
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:15,721
Special delivery? Let me guess.

770
01:31:18,849 --> 01:31:20,059
Chinese?

771
01:31:23,562 --> 01:31:25,022
Thai, maybe?

772
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,860
I've got it.

773
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:32,654
Italian food.

774
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:53,592
- What's your name, angel?
- Mathilda.

775
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:55,844
Mathilda.

776
01:32:18,784 --> 01:32:20,119
Mathilda.

777
01:32:22,204 --> 01:32:24,957
I want you to put the sack on the floor.

778
01:32:30,796 --> 01:32:32,005
Good.

779
01:32:35,008 --> 01:32:39,263
And now I want you to tell me everything
you know about Italian food.

780
01:32:39,972 --> 01:32:43,559
And don't forget the name of the chef
who fixed it for me.

781
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:47,229
Nobody sent me. I do business for myself.

782
01:32:49,857 --> 01:32:51,984
So this is something

783
01:32:53,861 --> 01:32:55,779
personal, is it?

784
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:03,745
What filthy piece of shit

785
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:06,123
did I do now?

786
01:33:07,291 --> 01:33:09,168
You killed my brother.

787
01:33:13,589 --> 01:33:14,923
I'm sorry.

788
01:33:24,016 --> 01:33:26,018
And you want to join him?

789
01:33:29,188 --> 01:33:30,230
No.

790
01:33:30,689 --> 01:33:32,816
It's always the same thing.

791
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:42,075
It's when you start to become
really afraid of death

792
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:46,163
that you learn to appreciate life.

793
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:51,001
Do you like life, sweetheart?

794
01:33:53,962 --> 01:33:55,047
Yes.

795
01:33:59,176 --> 01:34:00,594
That's good.

796
01:34:05,224 --> 01:34:08,143
Because I take no pleasure

797
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:11,897
in taking a life

798
01:34:13,649 --> 01:34:16,777
if it's from a person
who doesn't care about it.

799
01:34:27,246 --> 01:34:31,667
Stan. Stan. Shit, Stan,
I've been looking all over for you, man,

800
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:34,920
- and I checked upstairs...
- What? I'm busy.

801
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:37,756
It's Malky, man. He's dead.

802
01:34:40,092 --> 01:34:43,345
Malky was making a buy for us
from the Chinaman.

803
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:46,265
<i>Yo, but they got nothing to do with it, man.</i>

804
01:34:46,348 --> 01:34:51,186
<i>They told me this guy came from the outside.
He was a pro.</i>

805
01:34:52,062 --> 01:34:55,023
<i>He was fast.
He fucking came out of nowhere.</i>

806
01:34:55,107 --> 01:34:58,110
<i>Boom, shoots the Chinaman dead
in two seconds.</i>

807
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:01,738
Easy, man. I'm a cop.

808
01:35:02,114 --> 01:35:04,825
Then turns around,
says something to Malky like...

809
01:35:05,117 --> 01:35:06,785
No women, no kids.

810
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:18,046
I think it was something personal.

811
01:35:19,965 --> 01:35:23,969
Death is whimsical today.

812
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:55,167
Blood, do you hear me?

813
01:35:55,542 --> 01:35:58,712
Yeah, man, I hear you, Stan.
Just chill out, man.

814
01:36:00,172 --> 01:36:02,674
Would you take her up to my office?

815
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:05,844
All right. Yeah.

816
01:36:14,186 --> 01:36:16,021
Jesus fucking Christ.

817
01:36:28,533 --> 01:36:30,077
<i>"Leon, my love.</i>

818
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,496
<i>"I know where to find the guys
who killed my brother.</i>

819
01:36:32,579 --> 01:36:37,042
<i>"Their boss is Norman Stansfield
and he's in the DEA building, Room 4602.</i>

820
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:39,294
<i>"I'm gonna do them myself</i>

821
01:36:39,378 --> 01:36:43,131
<i>"if something goes wrong,
I left you 20 grand on the table.</i>

822
01:36:43,215 --> 01:36:46,343
<i>"It's for a contract. Five grand a head, right?</i>

823
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:50,097
<i>"I know I'll feel better after I do this.</i>

824
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:53,767
<i>"I love you. Mathilda."</i>

825
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:00,148
Wait for me. I won't be long.

826
01:37:00,232 --> 01:37:03,527
Whoa, I can't park in front like this.
It's a federal building!

827
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:10,867
He's gonna do the same exact thing
that I said.

828
01:37:11,243 --> 01:37:12,744
A nine milli.

829
01:37:14,413 --> 01:37:15,664
Bullets.

830
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:18,166
And another nine milli.

831
01:37:21,253 --> 01:37:23,213
What'd you plan to do with all these guns?

832
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:26,258
Maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building.

833
01:37:30,429 --> 01:37:34,099
Holy shit! What we got here? Lunch.

834
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:38,645
Careful, Blood, it might be poisoned.

835
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:40,730
No, man. There's no anchovies on this.

836
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:00,041
Is that what you call "I won't be long"?

837
01:38:00,125 --> 01:38:02,836
I've been hanging around here
for at least 10 minutes.

838
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:04,421
I did my best.

839
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:54,137
Do you like it?

840
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,848
Yes.

841
01:38:57,641 --> 01:38:59,017
So say it.

842
01:39:02,312 --> 01:39:03,647
I like it.

843
01:39:18,828 --> 01:39:20,205
Not thirsty?

844
01:39:29,381 --> 01:39:32,467
You know, a girl's first time
is very important.

845
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:35,470
It determines the rest of her life sexually.

846
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,890
I read that once
in one of my sister's magazines.

847
01:39:39,099 --> 01:39:42,560
My girlfriends told me that
they hated their first experience.

848
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:46,564
That's because they didn't love the guys.

849
01:39:48,358 --> 01:39:50,402
They just did it to show off.

850
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:53,780
Afterwards, they started liking it,
like cigarettes.

851
01:39:58,410 --> 01:40:00,662
Will I like it the first time?

852
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:06,626
Mathilda, no.

853
01:40:09,337 --> 01:40:10,588
Why not?

854
01:40:11,506 --> 01:40:12,966
I just can't.

855
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:16,761
- You love someone else?
- No.

856
01:40:17,929 --> 01:40:19,264
I mean...

857
01:40:23,518 --> 01:40:25,937
There was someone a long time ago.

858
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:29,607
Before I came to the States.

859
01:40:30,108 --> 01:40:32,777
Her father didn't want her to see me.

860
01:40:34,237 --> 01:40:37,032
She was from a very respectable family.

861
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:40,201
Mine was,

862
01:40:41,286 --> 01:40:42,537
you know,

863
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:46,499
not so respectable.

864
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:50,253
Her dad went nuts every time
she'd take off to see me.

865
01:40:50,962 --> 01:40:53,631
She still snuck off to see you, right?

866
01:40:54,632 --> 01:40:57,969
- Right.
- See, nothing can stop love, Leon.

867
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:02,557
He killed her.

868
01:41:03,516 --> 01:41:05,560
One shot through the head.

869
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:12,984
They kept him in jail for two days,
and they let him go free.

870
01:41:15,153 --> 01:41:17,364
They said it was an accident.

871
01:41:19,783 --> 01:41:20,825
So

872
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:26,247
one night I waited for him.

873
01:41:28,792 --> 01:41:31,002
Five hundred feet with a lens.

874
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:35,965
He also had an accident.

875
01:41:37,175 --> 01:41:40,637
The same night I took a boat and came here

876
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:44,015
to meet up with my father
who was working for Tony.

877
01:41:45,517 --> 01:41:46,935
I was 19.

878
01:41:51,189 --> 01:41:54,401
Since then I've never left the city,

879
01:41:58,571 --> 01:42:00,949
and I've never had another girlfriend.

880
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:05,745
You see, Mathilda,

881
01:42:06,996 --> 01:42:09,040
I wouldn't be a good lover.

882
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:12,252
Okay.

883
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:18,049
Would you do me one favor?

884
01:42:18,466 --> 01:42:19,551
What?

885
01:42:20,009 --> 01:42:22,345
I'm sick of watching you
sleeping on your chair.

886
01:42:22,429 --> 01:42:24,472
We're gonna share the bed.

887
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:27,725
I don't think it's a good idea.

888
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:30,520
It's okay.

889
01:42:31,229 --> 01:42:34,399
Put your legs up on the bed.
Yeah. That's nice.

890
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:42,699
Put your head down. It's okay. Relax.

891
01:43:04,262 --> 01:43:05,930
Good night, Leon.

892
01:43:09,017 --> 01:43:10,435
Good night.

893
01:43:35,293 --> 01:43:37,504
I want a piece of cake first!

894
01:43:39,631 --> 01:43:41,132
Hey, come on.

895
01:43:43,468 --> 01:43:46,095
Manolo, take the kids in the kitchen.

896
01:44:06,491 --> 01:44:08,910
I have a lot of respect
for your business, Tony.

897
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:14,040
When you've killed for us in the past,
we've always been satisfied.

898
01:44:14,791 --> 01:44:19,712
And that's exactly why today
is going to be very, very hard for me.

899
01:44:20,797 --> 01:44:22,715
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

900
01:44:26,886 --> 01:44:30,223
My man was killed right here on your turf.

901
01:44:31,182 --> 01:44:33,851
And the Chinks tell me that the hit man

902
01:44:33,935 --> 01:44:37,438
was kind of the Italian type.

903
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:41,776
So we figured that Tony
might know something.

904
01:44:41,859 --> 01:44:43,945
Wait. There's more.

905
01:44:45,405 --> 01:44:47,365
You're gonna love this.

906
01:44:48,825 --> 01:44:54,247
A few hours later,
a little 12-year-old girl comes into my office,

907
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:58,876
armed to the teeth, with the firm intention
of sending me straight to the morgue.

908
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,212
And do you know who came and got her
in the middle of the afternoon

909
01:45:01,296 --> 01:45:03,423
right there in my building?

910
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:07,802
The very same Italian hit man.

911
01:45:13,224 --> 01:45:15,101
I'm dying to meet him.

912
01:45:20,106 --> 01:45:24,485
Relax. Everything's fine. Sleep well?

913
01:45:24,777 --> 01:45:28,489
I never really sleep.
Got one eye open always.

914
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:30,408
Yeah, I forgot.

915
01:45:30,992 --> 01:45:34,829
You know, I never saw someone
with one eye open snore so much.

916
01:45:35,622 --> 01:45:37,498
- I snore?
- Like a baby.

917
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:43,004
I'm gonna go get some milk for breakfast.
I won't be long.

918
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:45,006
Don't forget the code when you come back.

919
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:47,759
Two knocks, then one,
and two knocks again. Right?

920
01:45:47,842 --> 01:45:49,010
Right.

921
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:12,367
Ring these up. I'm gonna go get some milk.

922
01:46:32,929 --> 01:46:34,889
From here on out, you don't make a sound.

923
01:46:34,972 --> 01:46:39,102
You answer my questions by nodding yes
or shaking your head no. You got it?

924
01:46:39,185 --> 01:46:40,603
Is he alone?

925
01:46:41,396 --> 01:46:43,147
Does he expect you?

926
01:46:43,815 --> 01:46:46,234
Do you have keys to the apartment?

927
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:50,238
Is there a code, a way of knocking,
so he knows it's you?

928
01:47:38,578 --> 01:47:39,662
Alpha team.

929
01:47:39,746 --> 01:47:43,040
- <i>Final position. We're ready to go.</i>
- Be careful.

930
01:48:27,543 --> 01:48:30,338
Leon! Leon!

931
01:48:30,463 --> 01:48:33,132
What up? What up? Move! Move! Fuck.

932
01:48:39,096 --> 01:48:40,181
Shit.

933
01:48:42,308 --> 01:48:44,310
Alpha team. Man down. Man down.

934
01:48:45,436 --> 01:48:46,813
I told you.

935
01:48:47,772 --> 01:48:48,981
Benny.

936
01:48:51,609 --> 01:48:54,362
- Bring me everyone.
- What do you mean, "Everyone"?

937
01:48:54,445 --> 01:48:56,531
Everyone!

938
01:49:50,626 --> 01:49:51,961
Take this.

939
01:49:58,509 --> 01:50:00,052
Go take a look.

940
01:50:15,735 --> 01:50:17,111
Don't move.

941
01:50:17,987 --> 01:50:19,739
Do you see anything?

942
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:24,035
It's the guy. He's here.
He's got a gun to my head.

943
01:50:28,205 --> 01:50:29,624
Okay, nobody moves.

944
01:50:29,707 --> 01:50:31,375
Let the girl go.

945
01:50:31,459 --> 01:50:33,294
Now, take it easy, man!

946
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:34,837
Let the girl go.

947
01:50:34,921 --> 01:50:37,089
Okay, the girl's coming out.

948
01:50:37,381 --> 01:50:39,008
Let the girl go.

949
01:50:48,267 --> 01:50:51,062
Grab the ax off the wall. Over there. Go!

950
01:50:54,941 --> 01:50:56,817
You're coming with us.

951
01:51:09,622 --> 01:51:11,415
Christ, he shot him!

952
01:51:12,667 --> 01:51:13,918
Bastard!

953
01:51:24,804 --> 01:51:26,722
Move, move, move, move!

954
01:51:29,475 --> 01:51:31,811
- Shut the fucking water off!
- Got it.

955
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:33,729
Come!

956
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:38,609
We're in a bad way here. Send the Cats.
I repeat. Send the Cats.

957
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:52,873
I don't know what happened.
I didn't see them coming, I swear!

958
01:51:53,541 --> 01:51:57,712
I just went shopping and I came back,
and they were everywhere.

959
01:52:00,381 --> 01:52:02,425
Stay away from the window.

960
01:52:29,869 --> 01:52:30,870
Leon.

961
01:52:32,163 --> 01:52:33,164
Leon.

962
01:52:48,179 --> 01:52:49,513
Come here.

963
01:52:52,475 --> 01:52:53,684
Snipers.

964
01:52:56,604 --> 01:52:59,565
Okay, now,
get this fucking asshole out of there.

965
01:53:16,957 --> 01:53:19,543
How are we gonna get out of here now?

966
01:53:19,877 --> 01:53:22,379
Leave it to me. We're checking out.

967
01:54:21,522 --> 01:54:24,108
But, Leon, it's not big enough for you.

968
01:54:24,441 --> 01:54:26,944
- It's barely big enough for me.
- We said no discussion.

969
01:54:27,027 --> 01:54:29,280
- No, I'm not letting...
- Listen...

970
01:54:29,363 --> 01:54:32,283
- I'm not going! I won't go!
- Listen...

971
01:54:32,491 --> 01:54:35,536
- Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me.
- I won't go!

972
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:36,996
We have no chance together.

973
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:38,998
But if I'm alone, I can do it. Trust me.

974
01:54:39,081 --> 01:54:42,710
I'm in good shape, Mathilda.
I know I've got a lot of money with Tony.

975
01:54:42,793 --> 01:54:45,713
A lot. We'll take it and leave together,
just the two of us.

976
01:54:45,796 --> 01:54:46,881
Okay? Go.

977
01:54:46,964 --> 01:54:50,759
No. You're just saying that so I won't worry.

978
01:54:55,014 --> 01:54:58,475
- I don't wanna lose you, Leon.
- You're not gonna lose me, Mathilda.

979
01:54:58,559 --> 01:55:00,561
You've given me a taste for life.

980
01:55:00,644 --> 01:55:03,564
I wanna be happy,
sleep in a bed, have roots.

981
01:55:03,981 --> 01:55:06,609
You'll never be alone again, Mathilda.

982
01:55:09,445 --> 01:55:12,072
Please, go now, baby. Go.

983
01:55:14,533 --> 01:55:17,119
Calm down. Go now. Go.

984
01:55:18,287 --> 01:55:19,288
Go.

985
01:55:19,663 --> 01:55:23,542
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna clean them all.
Tony's in an hour.

986
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:33,219
- I love you, Mathilda.
- I love you, too, Leon.

987
01:56:08,545 --> 01:56:11,423
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
what the fuck is going on up there?

988
01:56:11,507 --> 01:56:14,343
I just said take the guy out,
not the whole fucking building.

989
01:56:34,738 --> 01:56:37,199
Hey, we've got one breathing here!

990
01:56:38,742 --> 01:56:40,703
Get a medic on the horn!

991
01:56:44,415 --> 01:56:46,750
Clear the hall! Let him through!

992
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:53,173
- We've got a wounded man here. Make way!
- Down those stairs.

993
01:56:55,843 --> 01:56:57,386
Let's go! Move!

994
01:56:58,220 --> 01:57:00,389
Get that guy off the stairs!
Leave him on the landing.

995
01:57:00,472 --> 01:57:02,850
- Get your team back up there!
- I got him!

996
01:57:03,559 --> 01:57:06,979
We've got two men coming down the stairs.
Let's hurry!

997
01:57:28,417 --> 01:57:29,668
You okay?

998
01:57:29,835 --> 01:57:33,964
Hey, I need a medic over here!
Move your fucking asses.

999
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:36,717
Squad Number One,
what's the status on the apartment?

1000
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:39,511
<i>Can't see shit. Too much smoke in here.
Give us five minutes to clear it out.</i>

1001
01:57:39,595 --> 01:57:40,554
Okay. You got it.

1002
01:57:40,637 --> 01:57:44,433
What, what, what? You're 200 men
and you can't find one man and a girl?

1003
01:57:44,516 --> 01:57:45,851
Did you find the girl?

1004
01:57:55,611 --> 01:57:58,781
Hi, how are you doing?
Take your mask off, quick.

1005
01:58:00,908 --> 01:58:04,661
Let me see you. That's deep. Right.
And this one here...

1006
01:58:05,037 --> 01:58:07,915
- You're from the 3rd Precinct?
- Yeah.

1007
01:58:10,709 --> 01:58:13,921
All right, let's open up his sleeve a little bit.

1008
01:58:16,924 --> 01:58:19,968
All right, fine. Put it down. Put it down.
This one.

1009
01:58:37,027 --> 01:58:39,071
You stay there for two minutes.
I'll be right back.

1010
01:58:39,154 --> 01:58:42,574
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.

1011
01:58:43,242 --> 01:58:45,702
Okay. You're all right. Sit tight.

1012
01:58:52,584 --> 01:58:54,586
Okay, come on, everybody out!

1013
01:58:54,795 --> 01:58:58,090
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on. Out!

1014
01:59:22,322 --> 01:59:24,741
Clear the way. Clear the way, men.

1015
01:59:34,376 --> 01:59:36,879
Come on. What are you doing here?
Get out. Get out. Come on.

1016
02:01:28,699 --> 02:01:30,033
Stansfield.

1017
02:01:30,993 --> 02:01:32,578
At your service.

1018
02:01:41,545 --> 02:01:44,673
This is from

1019
02:01:51,263 --> 02:01:52,556
Mathilda.

1020
02:02:09,573 --> 02:02:10,574
Shit.

1021
02:02:32,262 --> 02:02:33,305
Get out of here!

1022
02:02:37,267 --> 02:02:40,937
Leon asked me to help you out
if something happened,

1023
02:02:42,314 --> 02:02:44,816
and I think something happened, right?

1024
02:02:44,900 --> 02:02:47,402
He put aside a little cash for you.

1025
02:02:47,569 --> 02:02:52,449
So what I'm suggesting is that
seeing as how you're still so young,

1026
02:02:53,325 --> 02:02:56,328
I should hold the money for you
until you're older.

1027
02:02:56,453 --> 02:02:57,412
Like a bank, you know,

1028
02:02:57,496 --> 02:03:02,292
except it's better than a bank, 'cause,
you know, banks always get knocked off.

1029
02:03:02,793 --> 02:03:06,046
No one knocks off old Tony.
But it's your money.

1030
02:03:06,672 --> 02:03:11,176
In the meantime,
all you gotta do is come here

1031
02:03:11,259 --> 02:03:15,889
every once in a while and I'll dish it out
so you can have a little fun, okay?

1032
02:03:18,308 --> 02:03:19,393
Here.

1033
02:03:19,893 --> 02:03:24,022
- Here's a hundred bucks to start with.
- Can't I get a job instead?

1034
02:03:24,481 --> 02:03:25,649
A job?

1035
02:03:28,026 --> 02:03:30,779
- What the hell can you do?
- I can clean.

1036
02:03:32,322 --> 02:03:37,244
I ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid,
so get it out of your goddamn head!

1037
02:03:37,327 --> 02:03:40,872
It's over! The game's over! Leon's dead!

1038
02:03:42,290 --> 02:03:43,667
You hear me?

1039
02:03:54,010 --> 02:03:56,722
Come on. You think I ain't hurting, too?

1040
02:04:02,102 --> 02:04:03,603
But he's dead.

1041
02:04:04,688 --> 02:04:09,401
You're gonna forget all this craziness
and get your little ass back to school.

1042
02:04:09,943 --> 02:04:12,904
Now take this money
and get the hell out of here.

1043
02:04:12,988 --> 02:04:15,073
And don't let me see your face
till next month,

1044
02:04:15,157 --> 02:04:19,202
'cause something tells me
I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

1045
02:05:10,921 --> 02:05:12,255
My parents

1046
02:05:14,758 --> 02:05:18,512
died in a car accident four weeks ago.

1047
02:05:21,348 --> 02:05:22,933
It was terrible.

1048
02:05:25,602 --> 02:05:28,522
You know, we didn't have the time
to get to know one another

1049
02:05:28,605 --> 02:05:30,649
when you first came here,

1050
02:05:30,732 --> 02:05:34,277
but I want you to know that I'm not
the kind of woman who'd let down a child,

1051
02:05:34,361 --> 02:05:37,364
whatever her situation,
whatever her mistake.

1052
02:05:37,447 --> 02:05:42,202
So I'm going to help you and do my best
to welcome you here again.

1053
02:05:44,579 --> 02:05:46,331
But on one condition.

1054
02:05:46,957 --> 02:05:49,626
You have to stop lying to me, Mathilda.

1055
02:05:50,669 --> 02:05:54,047
I want you to take a chance and trust me.

1056
02:05:55,382 --> 02:05:57,801
Now, tell me what happened to you.

1057
02:05:59,052 --> 02:06:00,053
Okay.

1058
02:06:01,888 --> 02:06:06,309
My family got shot down by DEA officers
because of a drug problem.

1059
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:10,897
I lived with the greatest guy on Earth.

1060
02:06:10,981 --> 02:06:15,652
He was a hit man, the best in town,
but he died this morning.

1061
02:06:15,986 --> 02:06:19,155
And if you don't help me,
I'll be dead by tonight.

1062
02:06:39,509 --> 02:06:42,762
- You know her?
- No. I've never seen her.

1063
02:07:09,497 --> 02:07:11,875
I think we'll be okay here, Leon.
