1
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,477
Starling!

2
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:07,980
Starling!

3
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:13,736
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

4
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:15,530
Thank you, sir.

5
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:04,996
- Clarice.
- Hey.

6
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,796
...so there shouldn't be any problem
if you could...

7
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,340
- You looking for Crawford?
- Yes, sir.

8
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,884
He should be back in a couple minutes.
Why don't you wait in his office?

9
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:04,263
- Okay.
- And I think they were over in Flushing...

10
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:34,263

11
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,026
Starling,

12
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,988
Clarice M. Good morning.

13
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,489
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

14
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:06,909
Sorry to pull you off of the course
at such short notice.

15
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:08,911
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.

16
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:10,955
- Top quarter of your class.
- I hope so.

17
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,541
They haven't posted any grades yet.

18
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,377
A job's come up, and I thought about you.

19
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,338
Not a job, really.
More of an interesting errand.

20
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:20,673
Sit down.

21
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,341
Yes, sir.

22
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:26,345
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.

23
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,348
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,

24
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:31,934
on the Bureau's civil rights record
in the Hoover years.

25
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:33,311
I gave you an "A."

26
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:34,854
A-minus, sir.

27
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:40,776
Let's see. Double major,
psych and criminology. Graduated magna.

28
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,529
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.

29
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:45,489
It says here when you graduate,

30
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:48,618
you want to come to work for me
in Behavioral Science.

31
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,870
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

32
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,957
We're interviewing all the serial killers
now in custody

33
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,126
for a psycho-behavioral profile.

34
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,920
It could be a real help in unsolved cases.

35
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,882
Most of them have been
happy to talk to us.

36
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,134
Do you spook easily, Starling?

37
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,844
Not yet, sir.

38
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,972
See, the one we want most,
refuses to cooperate.

39
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:12,808
I want you to go after him again today
in the asylum.

40
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,518
And who's the subject?

41
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,896
The psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter.

42
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:19,023
Hannibal the Cannibal.

43
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,026
I don't expect him to talk to you,

44
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,197
but I have to be able to say we tried.

45
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:29,283
So if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting.

46
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:31,369
How's he look? How's his cell look?

47
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,079
Is he sketching, drawing?

48
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,414
If he is, what's he sketching?

49
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,128
Here's a dossier on Lecter.

50
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:47,093
A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.

51
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:50,054
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800 Wednesday.

52
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,305
Okay.

53
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,894
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

54
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,938
Lecter's been in prison
for so many years now.

55
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:02,191
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?

56
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,943
I wish there were.

57
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:08,030
- I want your full attention, Starling.
- Yes, sir.

58
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,825
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

59
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,702
Dr. Chilton at the asylum

60
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:15,913
will go over all the physical procedures
used with him.

61
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,291
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever,

62
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,294
and you're to tell him
nothing personal, Starling.

63
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:25,965
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

64
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,884
Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.

65
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,094
And what is that?

66
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:32,555
Oh, he's a monster.

67
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,557
A pure psychopath.

68
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,393
So rare to capture one alive.

69
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:41,397
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

70
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,024
Well.

71
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,279
You know, we get a lot of detectives here,
but I must say,

72
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,990
I can't ever remember one as attractive.

73
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,661
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

74
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,082
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

75
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,836
Well, I'm sure
this is a great town, Dr. Chilton,

76
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,799
but my instructions are to talk to
Dr. Lecter and report back this afternoon.

77
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:10,342
I see.

78
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,553
Let's make this quick, then.

79
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,472
We've tried to study him, of course,

80
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,433
but he's much too sophisticated
for the standard tests.

81
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,894
Oh, my, does he hate us!

82
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,021
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

83
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,442
Crawford's very clever, isn't he?
Using you.

84
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,902
What do you mean, sir?

85
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,696
A pretty young woman to turn him on.

86
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:34,033
I don't believe Lecter's even seen a woman
in eight years.

87
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,368
And, oh, are you ever his taste.

88
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,037
So to speak.

89
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:41,248
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It is not a charm school.

90
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:44,543
Good. Then you should be able
to remember the rules.

91
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,799
Do not touch the glass.
Do not approach the glass.

92
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:53,260
You pass him nothing but soft paper.
No pencils or pens.

93
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:55,471
No staples or paper clips on his paper.

94
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,890
Use the sliding food carrier.
No exceptions.

95
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,351
If he attempts to pass you anything,
do not accept it.

96
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,354
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand, sir.

97
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:07,608
I'm going to show you
why we insist on such precautions.

98
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,319
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981,

99
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:13,322
he complained of chest pains
and was taken to the dispensary.

100
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,116
His mouthpiece and restraints
were removed for an EKG.

101
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,078
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

102
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:25,042
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less,

103
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,627
save one of her eyes.

104
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,921
His pulse never got above 85,

105
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,382
even when he ate her tongue.

106
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,093
I keep him in here.

107
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,678
Dr. Chilton.

108
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,516
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy,

109
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:44,353
then, well, maybe we'll have more luck
if I go in by myself.

110
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,105
What do you think?

111
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,820
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

112
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:58,409
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

113
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:03,706
When she's finished, bring her out.

114
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:33,527
Hi. I'm Barney.

115
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,614
He told you, don't get near the glass?

116
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,158
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

117
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:41,160
Nice to meet you, Clarice.

118
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,746
You can hang your coat up here if you like.

119
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,456
Thank you. I will.

120
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,877
He's past the others. The last cell.

121
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,795
You keep to the right.

122
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,966
I put out a chair for you.

123
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,594
Oh, yes. That's very good. Thank you.

124
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,640
I'll be watching. You'll do fine.

125
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,568
Hi.

126
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,547
I can smell your cunt.

127
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,562
Good morning.

128
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:54,608
Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.
May I speak with you?

129
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,695
You're one of Jack Crawford's, aren't you?

130
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,113
I am, yes, sir.

131
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,241
May I see your credentials?

132
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,951
Certainly.

133
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,584
Closer, please.

134
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,088
Closer.

135
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,939
That expires in one week.

136
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:36,692
You're not real FBI, are you?

137
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,486
I'm still in training at the Academy.

138
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:43,198
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

139
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,617
Yes. I'm a student.

140
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,911
I'm here to learn from you.

141
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,329
Maybe you can decide for yourself

142
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:52,499
whether or not I'm qualified enough
to do that.

143
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,755
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

144
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,968
Sit, please.

145
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,144
Now, then. Tell me,

146
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,480
what did Miggs say to you?

147
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:17,024
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

148
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,984
He hissed at you.

149
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:20,652
What did he say?

150
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,782
He said, "I can smell your cunt."

151
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:26,325
I see.

152
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,620
I myself cannot.

153
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,298
You use Evyan skin cream.

154
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,845
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps,

155
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,723
but not today.

156
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,436
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

157
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:00,192
That is the Duomo,
seen from the Belvedere.

158
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,320
You know Florence?

159
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,615
All that detail just from memory, sir?

160
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:10,619
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

161
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:11,829
Well,

162
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:16,750
perhaps you'd care to lend us your view
on this questionnaire, sir.

163
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,211
Oh, no, no, no.

164
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,296
You were doing fine.

165
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,508
You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy.

166
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:29,179
You had established trust
with the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

167
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:33,433
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

168
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,562
It won't do.

169
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,814
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor.

170
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,983
Either you will or you won't.

171
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,109
Yeah.

172
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,862
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed,

173
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,781
if he is recruiting help
from the student body.

174
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:50,659
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill.

175
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,870
What a naughty boy he is.

176
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:56,790
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?

177
00:15:56,874 --> 00:16:00,043
Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.

178
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,964
Well, it started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

179
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:07,801
They said,
"This one likes to skin his humps."

180
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:13,307
Why do you think he removes their skins,

181
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,850
Agent Starling?

182
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,144
Enthrall me with your acumen.

183
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,438
It excites him.

184
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:23,525
Most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies from their victims.

185
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:24,902
I didn't.

186
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,111
No.

187
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,863
No, you ate yours.

188
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,451
You send that through now.

189
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:00,520
Oh, Agent Starling,

190
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:04,107
you think you can dissect me
with this blunt, little tool?

191
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,692
No.

192
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,653
I thought that your knowledge...

193
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,988
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

194
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,615
You know what you look like to me

195
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,117
with your good bag and your cheap shoes?

196
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,994
You look like a rube.

197
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:20,415
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.

198
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,627
Good nutrition has given you
some length of bone,

199
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,047
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash,

200
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,049
are you, Agent Starling?

201
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,927
And that accent you've tried
so desperately to shed,

202
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,720
pure West Virginia.

203
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,598
What does your father do?
Is he a coal miner?

204
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,684
Does he stink of the lamp?

205
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,395
And, oh, how quickly the boys found you.

206
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:45,023
All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,

207
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:48,860
while you could only dream
of getting out, getting anywhere,

208
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:52,656
getting all the way to the FBI.

209
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:57,828
You see a lot, Doctor.

210
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:03,709
But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself?

211
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,253
What about it? Why don't you...

212
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:09,923
Why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see?

213
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,592
Maybe you're afraid to.

214
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,980
A census-taker once tried to test me.

215
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:28,734
I ate his liver with some fava beans,

216
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,861
and a nice Chianti.

217
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,581
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

218
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,750
Fly, fly, fly.

219
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,560
I bit my wrist so I could die.

220
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,897
Look at the blood!

221
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,607
Gotcha!

222
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,735
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

223
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,697
Hannibal the Cannibal!

224
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,366
Agent Starling! Come back!

225
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,659
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!

226
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,328
I would not have had that happen to you.

227
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,205
Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to me.

228
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,874
- Then do this test for me.
- No, but I will make you happy.

229
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,793
I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.

230
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,836
- And what is that, Doctor?
- Advancement, of course.

231
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,548
Now listen carefully. Look deep
within yourself, Clarice Starling.

232
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:37,469
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine. M-o-f-e-t. Go now.

233
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:38,553
Doctor.

234
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,055
I don't think Miggs could manage again
quite so soon,

235
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,348
even though he is crazy.

236
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,766
Go now!

237
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:25,851
Hey, Bill.

238
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,480
Hey.

239
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,691
- Daddy!
- Hey, Clarice.

240
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,569
How are you?

241
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,530
Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?

242
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,616
- No, angel, they all got away.
- Aw, shoot.

243
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,473
FBI! Hands up! Don't move!

244
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,682
Turn around!

245
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,101
Hands behind your back! Thumbs up.

246
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,732
You're dead, Starling.

247
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:17,235
Johnson, good job.
Good entry. Good commands.

248
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,362
- Starling, where's your danger area?
- In the corner, sir.

249
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:20,822
- Did you check the corner?
- No, sir.

250
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,073
That's the reason you're dead.

251
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,909
3109.

252
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,410
3109.

253
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:29,706
Breaking doors or windows
to enter or exit.

254
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,209
Rule 404...

255
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,980
- Clarice, phone. It's the guru.
- Crawford?

256
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,148
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Ardelia.

257
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,317
- Starling?
- <i>Sir?</i>

258
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,778
Miggs is dead.

259
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:03,532
Dead? How?

260
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,994
The orderly heard Lecter whispering
to him all afternoon, and Miggs crying.

261
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:11,748
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

262
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,918
Starling?

263
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,254
Yeah, I'm still here, sir.

264
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:20,298
I just... I don't know
how to feel about this.

265
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,095
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

266
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:27,847
<i>Look, I know it got ugly today,</i>

267
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:31,309
but you mentioned a name
at the end. Mofet.

268
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:33,228
Any follow-up on her?

269
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:36,773
Well, Lecter altered or destroyed
most of his patients' histories

270
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,401
prior to capture, so there's no record
of anyone named Mofet.

271
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:43,738
But I thought the "yourself' reference

272
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,407
was too hokey for Lecter,

273
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,744
so I figured, he's from Baltimore,
and I looked in the phone book,

274
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:53,331
and there's a "Your Self Storage" facility,

275
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,667
<i>right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.</i>

276
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:01,756
Unit 31 was leased for 10 years,

277
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:03,550
prepaid in full.

278
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,051
The contract

279
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:09,180
is in the name of a Miss Hester Mofet.

280
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,517
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

281
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,561
Not to my knowledge.

282
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:19,107
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

283
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,901
Yes, I won't disturb anything. I promise.

284
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:24,446
I'll be out of here before you know it.

285
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:28,116
- Can I help you?
- Yes, actually, you can.

286
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,456
It's stuck.

287
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:37,292
We could return tomorrow with my son.

288
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:39,044
What about him?

289
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:45,133
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labor.

290
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,218
Great.

291
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:50,805
You just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

292
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,339
It's stuck.

293
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,508
Hand me that flashlight, sir.

294
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,269
Oh.

295
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:44,442
If this door should fall down
or anything else,

296
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,863
this is the number
for our Baltimore field office.

297
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,740
Now, they know that you're with me.

298
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,867
You call them if anything should happen.

299
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,619
Yes, Miss Starling.

300
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:26,729
Clarice...

301
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:30,275
- They're waiting for you. Watch yourself.
- Thank you.

302
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:34,487
Hester Mofet.
It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?

303
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:38,700
Hester Mofet, "The rest of me."

304
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:42,453
"Miss The Rest Of Me,"
meaning that you rented that garage?

305
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:19,908
Thank you.

306
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,493
Your bleeding has stopped.

307
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,122
How did you...

308
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,250
It's nothing.

309
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,336
It's just a scratch.

310
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,048
Dr. Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

311
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:38,301
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

312
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:40,386
Why, do you know something about him?

313
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,597
I might, if I saw the case file.

314
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,599
You could get that for me.

315
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,309
Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?

316
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,353
You wanted me to find him.

317
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,981
His real name is Benjamin Raspail.

318
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,275
A former patient of mine,

319
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,821
whose romantic attachments ran to,
shall we say, the exotic.

320
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:00,990
I did not kill him, I assure you.

321
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,785
Merely tucked him away
very much as I found him,

322
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:06,371
after he'd missed three appointments.

323
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,874
If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?

324
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,250
Who can say?

325
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:13,002
Best thing for him, really.

326
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:15,296
His therapy was going nowhere.

327
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,841
His dress, makeup...

328
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,302
Raspail was a transvestite?

329
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,763
In life? Oh, no.

330
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,140
Garden variety manic-depressive.

331
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:28,309
Tedious. Very tedious.

332
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,437
And I just think of him
as a kind of experiment,

333
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:34,899
a fledgling killer's first effort
at transformation.

334
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:37,860
How did you feel
when you saw him, Clarice?

335
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,363
Scared at first, then,

336
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:42,740
exhilarated.

337
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:45,660
Jack Crawford is helping your career,
isn't he?

338
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:48,788
Apparently, he likes you,
and you like him, too.

339
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:51,082
I never thought about it.

340
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:54,335
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you sexually?

341
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,962
True, he is much older,

342
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:59,674
but do you think he visualizes
scenarios, exchanges,

343
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:01,092
fucking you?

344
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:05,346
That doesn't interest me, Doctor.

345
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:09,017
Frankly, it's the sort of thing
that Miggs would say.

346
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,395
Not anymore.

347
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,738
Thank you, Barney.

348
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,994
What happened to your drawings?

349
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,622
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.

350
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,958
Just like that gospel program.

351
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:37,086
When you leave,
they'll turn the volume way up.

352
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,214
Dr. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

353
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:43,885
What did you mean
by transformation, Doctor?

354
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:55,772
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

355
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,650
I know they will never,
ever let me out while I'm alive.

356
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:02,278
What I want is a view.

357
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,657
I want a window where I can see a tree,
or even water.

358
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:10,286
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr. Chilton.

359
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,914
What did you mean by fledgling killer?

360
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,249
Are you saying that he's killed again?

361
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:18,628
I'm offering you a psychological profile
on Buffalo Bill,

362
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,755
based on the case evidence.

363
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:28,596
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

364
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:37,480
You know who he is, don't you?

365
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:41,150
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, Doctor.

366
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:43,945
All good things to those who wait.

367
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:45,780
I've waited, Clarice,

368
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:48,699
but how long can you
and old Jackie boy wait?

369
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:51,119
Our little Billy must already be searching

370
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:54,163
for that next special lady.

371
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,312
Hey, little cheeper.

372
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:09,739
I'll be right there.

373
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:11,699
Oh, shoot.

374
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:19,999
Goddamn it.

375
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:30,635
Perfect! Jesus.

376
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:38,226
Can I help you with that?

377
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,354
- Would you?
- Sure.

378
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,106
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

379
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,567
- You look kind of handicapped.
- Yeah.

380
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:49,904
I got it this far.
I just can't get it up in the truck.

381
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,489
Here. Just grab this.

382
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,074
Okay.

383
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,326
Good. Just set it down. That's good.

384
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:59,330
Get in the truck.
I want to push it all the way up.

385
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,041
- I really appreciate this. Thank you.
- All right.

386
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:03,709
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

387
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:06,295
Just go all the way back.

388
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,965
Okay. Is this good?

389
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:10,549
Yeah, that's good.

390
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,595
- That's great.
- Okay.

391
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:17,431
Say, are you about a size 14?

392
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:18,766
Sorry?

393
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:41,205
Good.

394
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:03,311
Oh, good. Good.

395
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:20,411
Hold!

396
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,216
Starling!

397
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,637
Outside. Let's go.

398
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:42,725
Cindy, in the ring for Starling. Let's go!

399
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,985
FBI! Hold it! Hold it right there!

400
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,779
Saddle up. Pack your field gear.
You're moving out.

401
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,280
- You're going with Crawford.
- Where?

402
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:58,074
Found a girl's body down in West Virginia.

403
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:00,785
Been in the water about a week.
Looks like a Buffalo Bill-type situation.

404
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:16,133
He keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.

405
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:19,387
There's no evidence
of rape or physical abuse prior to death.

406
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,473
All the mutilation you see there
is postmortem.

407
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,517
Okay, three days.

408
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,270
Then he shoots them, skins them,
and dumps them.

409
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,356
Each body in a different river.

410
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:33,609
The water leaves us no trace evidence
of any kind.

411
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,320
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

412
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:39,407
Her body was the only one
he took the trouble to weight down,

413
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,201
so actually, she was the third girl found.

414
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:44,328
After her, he got lazy.

415
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:49,125
Okay. Let's see.

416
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,752
Circles where the girls were abducted,

417
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:54,130
arrows where their bodies were found.

418
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:57,383
This new one today washed up here.

419
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:58,926
Elk River, West Virginia.

420
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:21,490
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

421
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,993
Well, he's a white male.

422
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:27,746
Serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups.

423
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,873
He's not a drifter.

424
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:32,501
He's got his own house somewhere,
not an apartment.

425
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:35,838
- Why?
- What he does with them takes privacy.

426
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,382
He's in his 30s or 40s.

427
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:40,759
He's got real physical strength,

428
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,846
combined with an older man's self-control.

429
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,182
He's cautious, precise.

430
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:49,852
And he's never impulsive. He'll never stop.

431
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:51,479
Why not?

432
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:56,692
He's got a real taste for it now.
He's getting better at his work.

433
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:00,029
Not bad, Starling.

434
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,406
- Questions?
- Yes, sir.

435
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:06,827
You haven't mentioned anything about
the information contained in my report

436
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:09,038
or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

437
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,915
I'm considering it.

438
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,918
That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

439
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:16,170
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

440
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:22,092
Well, if that was the case, then I just...

441
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:24,845
I just wish I was in on it. That's all.

442
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:27,389
If I had sent you in there
with an actual agenda,

443
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:29,350
Lecter would have known it instantly.

444
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:32,728
He would have toyed with you,
then turned to stone.

445
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:09,807
Excuse me.
Sheriff Perkins, these are the FBI people.

446
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:12,518
Sheriff Perkins. Jack Crawford, FBI.

447
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,437
Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.

448
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:18,107
We appreciate being invited
to your jurisdiction.

449
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,485
I didn't call you. That was somebody
from the State Attorney's office.

450
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:23,737
We'll extend you every courtesy,
but right now...

451
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:28,242
Sheriff, this type of sex crime
has certain aspects.

452
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:30,619
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

453
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:32,496
You know what I mean?

454
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,776
- Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel.
- Yes, sir.

455
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,069
Starling, we're back here.

456
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,822
Tell Lamar to come on
when he's finished playing his music.

457
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:32,991
Yeah. We'll be sending in a minute.

458
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:34,952
Is this working?

459
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:37,705
I need a six-way linkup.

460
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:39,498
Chicago, Detroit...

461
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:40,958
What? What?

462
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,882
Excuse me! Excuse me, gentlemen.

463
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:51,218
You officers and gentlemen,
listen here now.

464
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:52,886
There's things we need to do for her.

465
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,805
I know that you all brought her this far

466
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:57,558
and that her folks would
thank you if they could

467
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:59,893
for your kindness and your sensitivity.

468
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:03,480
And now, please,
go on now and let us take care of her.

469
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:05,566
Go on, now.

470
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:09,987
Thank you.

471
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,075
Thank you.

472
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:18,245
Okay, good.

473
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:29,214
Yeah, that's right. West Virginia. Elk River.

474
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:31,341
Stand by for transmission.

475
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:36,305
Ray.

476
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:51,487
Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.

477
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,338
Oh, Jesus.

478
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,680
Okay, Starling.

479
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:24,853
Bill.

480
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:45,374
Star-shaped contact entrance wound
over the sternum.

481
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:49,670
Muzzle stamp at the top.

482
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:52,214
- Wrongful death.
- "Wrongful death."

483
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,426
She'll have to go
to the state pathologist at Claxton.

484
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,804
Well, I better get back to that service.

485
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:00,639
Lamar will help you.

486
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:02,474
Lord Almighty.

487
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:09,273
What else do you see, Starling?

488
00:44:10,232 --> 00:44:12,526
Well, she's not local.

489
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:16,947
Her ears are pierced three times,
and there's...

490
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:21,285
Glitter nail polish. It looks like town to me.

491
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:28,667
Two of her fingernails are broken off,

492
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,296
and there's dirt or grit under them.

493
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:36,550
It looks like she's tried to claw her way
through something.

494
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:39,428
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax them through Missing Persons.

495
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:40,679
Right.

496
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,149
Let's do another.

497
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:03,368
She's got something in her throat.

498
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:05,787
When a body comes out of the water,

499
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:08,999
lots of times there's, like,
leaves and things in the mouth.

500
00:45:40,197 --> 00:45:43,033
What is that, some kind of seedpod?

501
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:46,244
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

502
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:49,748
There's no way that could get
way down in there like that.

503
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:52,542
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

504
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:57,381
She'll be easier to print
when we turn her over.

505
00:45:57,464 --> 00:46:00,759
- Lamar, will you give me a hand with this?
- Yes, sir, I will.

506
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:08,100
Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?

507
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,644
Different configuration
than the other victims.

508
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:11,979
Get close-ups.

509
00:46:12,062 --> 00:46:15,691
Victim's skin removed this time
in two large diamond-shaped sections

510
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:16,984
above the buttocks.

511
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:20,487
Stellate exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae

512
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:23,281
<i>approximately six inches
from the right shoulder blade.</i>

513
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:24,658
Starling?

514
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:29,663
When I told that sheriff
we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,

515
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:31,581
that really burned you, didn't it?

516
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:35,085
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

517
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,045
It matters, Mr. Crawford.

518
00:46:37,129 --> 00:46:39,631
Cops look at you to see how to act.

519
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:41,925
- It matters.
- Point taken.

520
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:50,934
Ligature marks found around the wrists,

521
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:52,686
<i>not around the ankles.</i>

522
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:56,148
<i>This would indicate
that the skinning was postmortem.</i>

523
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:22,549
- Time, Pitch. My move.
- No fair. You lured him with produce.

524
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,885
Tough noogies. Still my turn.

525
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:27,971
Nice and slow, baby.

526
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,434
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

527
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,437
Of course it counts. How do you play?

528
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:38,315
Agent Starling?

529
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:43,612
Where the heck did this come from?
It's practically mush.

530
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:45,947
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim.

531
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:48,283
The body was in the Elk River,
West Virginia.

532
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:49,743
It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

533
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:51,578
I'm afraid I can't tell you
any more about that.

534
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:52,913
We heard about it on the radio.

535
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:56,291
You mean this is like a clue
from a real murder case? Cool!

536
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,835
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

537
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:02,255
A <i>Sphingid. Ceratomia,</i> maybe.

538
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:04,257
Boy, he's a big sucker.

539
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:07,010
Okay.

540
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:09,012
Let's check morphology.

541
00:48:17,604 --> 00:48:20,524
What do you do when
you're not detecting, Agent Starling?

542
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:24,611
I try to be a student, Dr. Pitcher.

543
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,531
You ever go out
for cheeseburgers and beer?

544
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:30,534
The amusing house wine?

545
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:34,204
- Are you hitting on me, Doctor?
- Yes.

546
00:48:34,788 --> 00:48:36,665
- Got you.
- What do you got, Rodeo?

547
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:41,002
Agent Starling, meet Mr. <i>Acherontia styx.</i>

548
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:43,088
Weird.

549
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:46,466
Better known to his friends
as the Death's Head Moth.

550
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,302
- And where does it come from?
- That's what's strange.

551
00:48:49,386 --> 00:48:51,054
- They only live in Asia.
- Asia?

552
00:48:51,138 --> 00:48:54,015
In this country, they'd have to be
specially raised from imported eggs.

553
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:57,644
Somebody grew this guy,
fed him honey and nightshade,

554
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,229
kept him warm.

555
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:01,731
Somebody loved him.

556
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,517
Where are you?

557
00:49:38,894 --> 00:49:40,812
Let me out of here!

558
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,948
Please don't leave!

559
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:56,620
Talk to me, please!

560
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:59,748
Why won't you answer me? Please!

561
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:04,669
<i>Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucchi.</i>

562
00:50:04,753 --> 00:50:06,254
<i>I'm Gene Cassel with sports.</i>

563
00:50:06,338 --> 00:50:09,633
<i>And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.</i>

564
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,051
<i>Catherine Martin,</i>

565
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:13,803
<i>the 25-year-old daughter
of Senator Ruth Martin,</i>

566
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,349
<i>listed first as a missing person,
is now believed to have been kidnapped</i>

567
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:20,185
<i>by the serial killer
known only as Buffalo Bill.</i>

568
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:22,854
<i>Memphis police sources indicate
that the missing girl's blouse</i>

569
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:24,898
<i>has been identified, sliced up the back</i>

570
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:28,610
<i>in what has become a kind of grim,
all-too-familiar calling card.</i>

571
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:30,320
<i>Young Catherine Martin, as we've said,</i>

572
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:32,656
<i>is the only daughter of
U.S. Senator Ruth Martin,</i>

573
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:34,991
<i>the Republican junior senator
from Tennessee.</i>

574
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:36,910
<i>And while her kidnapping is not,
at this point,</i>

575
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:38,662
<i>considered to be politically motivated,</i>

576
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:41,831
<i>nevertheless, it has stirred
the government to its highest levels.</i>

577
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:44,834
<i>Reached for a comment
on the ski slopes of St owe, Vermont,</i>

578
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:48,880
<i>the president himself said to be,
and I quote, "intensely concerned."</i>

579
00:50:48,964 --> 00:50:50,423
<i>Just moments ago, Senator Martin</i>

580
00:50:50,507 --> 00:50:53,468
- <i>taped this dramatic personal plea.</i>
- Excuse me.

581
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:57,222
<i>I'm speaking now
to the person who is holding my daughter.</i>

582
00:50:58,515 --> 00:51:01,309
<i>Catherine is very gentle and kind.</i>

583
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:04,688
<i>Talk to her, and you'll see.</i>

584
00:51:06,064 --> 00:51:09,317
<i>You have the power. You are in charge.</i>

585
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,699
<i>I know you can feel love and compassion.</i>

586
00:51:17,284 --> 00:51:20,704
<i>You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world</i>

587
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:24,249
<i>that you can be merciful as well as strong,</i>

588
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:29,754
<i>that you're big enough to treat Catherine
better than the world has treated you.</i>

589
00:51:30,297 --> 00:51:32,048
<i>You have that power.</i>

590
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:33,800
<i>Please.</i>

591
00:51:34,718 --> 00:51:36,803
<i>My daughter is Catherine.</i>

592
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:38,972
- Boy, that's smart.
- <i>Release her unharmed.</i>

593
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:40,473
Jesus, that's really smart.

594
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:42,809
She keeps repeating the name.

595
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:46,313
If he sees Catherine as a person
and not just an object,

596
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:50,775
- it's harder to tear her up.
- <i>Please. Release my little girl.</i>

597
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:53,320
What you're doing, Miss Starling,

598
00:51:53,403 --> 00:51:55,613
is coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview

599
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:59,534
and refusing to share information with me
for the third time.

600
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,870
Sir, I told you,

601
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:04,122
this is just a routine follow-up
on the Raspail case.

602
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:07,500
- He is my patient. I have rights.
- I understand that, sir.

603
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:11,755
Look, I am not just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.

604
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:15,508
This is the number for
the U.S. Attorney's office.

605
00:52:15,592 --> 00:52:17,844
Please, either you discuss this with him,

606
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:20,680
or you let me do my job.
Do you understand?

607
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,229
<i>If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill</i>

608
00:52:28,772 --> 00:52:31,191
in time to save Catherine Martin,

609
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:34,527
the senator promises you a transfer

610
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:37,530
to the V.A. Hospital
at Oneida Park, New York,

611
00:52:37,614 --> 00:52:38,948
with a view of the woods nearby.

612
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:41,785
Maximum security still applies, of course.

613
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:44,621
You'd have reasonable access to books.

614
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:47,248
Best of all, though.

615
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:49,376
One week of the year,

616
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:53,505
you get to leave the hospital and go here.

617
00:52:56,925 --> 00:52:58,468
Plum Island.

618
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:03,056
Every day of that week
you may walk on the beach,

619
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:05,725
you may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour,

620
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:09,062
under SWAT team surveillance, of course.

621
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:11,689
And there you have it.

622
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:17,987
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

623
00:53:19,531 --> 00:53:21,825
A copy of the senator's offer.

624
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:25,412
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

625
00:53:26,121 --> 00:53:28,998
If Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

626
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:42,178
"Plum Island
Animal Disease Research Center."

627
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:46,975
Sounds charming.

628
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:51,479
That's only part of the island.
There's a very, very nice beach.

629
00:53:51,563 --> 00:53:54,774
- Terns nest there. There's beautiful...
- Terns?

630
00:53:57,193 --> 00:54:00,280
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be "turns" with us, too.

631
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:03,491
Quid pro quo.
I tell you things, you tell me things.

632
00:54:03,575 --> 00:54:06,494
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.

633
00:54:06,578 --> 00:54:09,247
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

634
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:15,378
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.

635
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,214
Go, Doctor.

636
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:22,010
What is your worst memory of childhood?

637
00:54:23,887 --> 00:54:25,805
The death of my father.

638
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:29,559
Tell me about it. And don't lie, or I'll know.

639
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,562
He was a town marshal,

640
00:54:33,897 --> 00:54:37,317
and one night he surprised two burglars

641
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,069
coming out of the back of a drugstore.

642
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,572
They shot him.

643
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:45,033
Was he killed outright?

644
00:54:45,492 --> 00:54:49,412
No. He was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

645
00:54:50,747 --> 00:54:53,374
My mother died when I was very young,

646
00:54:55,168 --> 00:54:57,420
so my father had become
the whole world to me,

647
00:54:57,504 --> 00:55:01,090
and when he left me, I had nothing.
I was ten years old.

648
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:04,928
You're very frank, Clarice.

649
00:55:05,762 --> 00:55:09,766
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

650
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:14,270
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

651
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:17,524
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.

652
00:55:17,607 --> 00:55:19,609
Was she a large girl?

653
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:23,530
Yes.

654
00:55:23,613 --> 00:55:27,325
- Big through the hips? Roomy?
- They all were.

655
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:29,494
What else?

656
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:33,373
She had an object
deliberately inserted into her throat.

657
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:36,292
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.

658
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:38,294
We don't know what it means.

659
00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:40,129
Was it a butterfly?

660
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:43,466
Yes. A moth.

661
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:48,763
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

662
00:55:50,265 --> 00:55:52,892
Why does he place them there, Doctor?

663
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:56,521
The significance of the moth is change.

664
00:55:57,355 --> 00:56:00,191
Caterpillar into chrysalis or pupa,

665
00:56:00,984 --> 00:56:03,152
and from thence into beauty.

666
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:06,364
Our Billy wants to change, too.

667
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:11,035
There's no correlation in literature
between transsexualism and violence.

668
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,205
- Transsexuals are very passive...
- Clever girl.

669
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:16,332
You're so close
to the way you're gonna catch him.

670
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:19,294
- Do you realize that?
- No. Tell me why.

671
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:22,922
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

672
00:56:23,006 --> 00:56:24,799
What happened next?

673
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:32,390
I don't imagine the answer
is on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

674
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:36,853
I went to live with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana.

675
00:56:36,936 --> 00:56:38,605
They had a ranch.

676
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:41,733
- Was it a cattle ranch?
- Sheep and horses.

677
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:46,154
- How long did you live there?
- Two months.

678
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:49,407
- Why so briefly?
- I ran away.

679
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:51,534
Why, Clarice?

680
00:56:51,743 --> 00:56:54,120
Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?

681
00:56:54,203 --> 00:56:56,205
Did he sodomize you?

682
00:56:56,706 --> 00:56:59,626
No. He was a very decent man.

683
00:57:01,628 --> 00:57:03,463
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

684
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:07,842
Billy is not a real transsexual.

685
00:57:08,051 --> 00:57:10,178
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

686
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:13,181
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

687
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:15,975
And you said that I was very close
to the way we would catch him.

688
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:17,477
What did you mean, Doctor?

689
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,104
There are three major centers
for transsexual surgery.

690
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:24,400
Johns Hopkins, the University of
Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.

691
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:27,945
I wouldn't be surprised
if Billy had applied for sex reassignment

692
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:30,948
at one or all of them and been rejected.

693
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:33,993
On what basis would they reject him?

694
00:57:34,911 --> 00:57:39,165
<i>Look for severe childhood disturbances
associated with violence.</i>

695
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:42,460
<i>Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.</i>

696
00:57:42,752 --> 00:57:46,297
<i>He was made one
through years of systematic abuse.</i>

697
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:50,551
<i>Billy hates his own identity, you see,</i>

698
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:53,429
<i>and he thinks that makes him
a transsexual.</i>

699
00:57:53,513 --> 00:57:57,517
<i>But his pathology
is a thousand times more savage</i>

700
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,394
<i>and more terrifying.</i>

701
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:07,068
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

702
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:09,696
Mister, my family will pay cash.

703
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:13,032
Whatever ransom you're asking for,
they'll pay it.

704
00:58:13,616 --> 00:58:18,079
It rubs the lotion on its skin,
or else it gets the hose again.

705
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:23,084
Yes, she will, Precious.
She will get the hose.

706
00:58:23,835 --> 00:58:25,962
Okay, okay, okay.

707
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:29,382
Okay. I'm there.

708
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:30,967
Okay.

709
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:36,097
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges.

710
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,557
I promise.

711
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:43,146
See, my mom is a real important woman.
I guess you already know that.

712
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:46,190
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

713
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:50,778
Please! Please! I want to go home.

714
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:55,074
I want to go home, please!
Please, I want to...

715
00:58:55,158 --> 00:58:57,660
It places the lotion in the basket.

716
00:58:58,327 --> 00:59:02,331
I want to see my mommy! Please.

717
00:59:02,999 --> 00:59:06,002
I want to see my mother again.

718
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:09,297
I want to see my mommy.

719
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:13,009
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

720
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:52,089
You still think you're gonna
walk on some beach and see the birdies?

721
00:59:52,173 --> 00:59:54,050
No, I don't think so.

722
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:58,304
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

723
00:59:58,387 --> 01:00:01,057
She never heard of any deal with you.

724
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:03,851
They scammed you, Hannibal.

725
01:00:05,895 --> 01:00:07,396
Stand outside

726
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:10,399
and shut the door.

727
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:11,901
Barney.

728
01:00:18,074 --> 01:00:22,161
There never was a deal
with Senator Martin, but there is now.

729
01:00:22,578 --> 01:00:23,955
I designed it.

730
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:27,625
Of course, I worked in a few conditions
for my own benefit as well.

731
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:31,003
Identify Buffalo Bill by name

732
01:00:31,254 --> 01:00:33,339
and if the girl is found in time,

733
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:35,132
Senator Martin will have you
transferred to

734
01:00:35,216 --> 01:00:37,343
Brushy Mountain State Prison
in Tennessee.

735
01:00:38,803 --> 01:00:40,596
Answer me, Hannibal.

736
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,769
You answer me now,
or by God, you'll never leave this cell.

737
01:00:49,272 --> 01:00:51,065
Who is Buffalo Bill?

738
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,402
His first name is Louis.

739
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:58,531
I'll tell the rest to the Senator herself,
but only in Tennessee,

740
01:00:58,614 --> 01:01:01,284
and I have a few conditions of my own.

741
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:06,163
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

742
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:10,167
<i>Jack, Hannibal Lecter
is being transferred to Memphis.</i>

743
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:11,836
Transferred?

744
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:15,006
Did you have a trainee
make some sort of phony offer to Lecter

745
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:16,382
in the Senator's name?

746
01:01:16,632 --> 01:01:18,467
Yeah. I rolled the dice. I had to.

747
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:20,887
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.

748
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:22,972
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.

749
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:25,558
She's asking him to take over in Memphis.

750
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:52,293
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

751
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:55,171
I'm Lieutenant Boyle.
This is Sergeant Patrick.

752
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:57,423
Now, we're gonna treat you
as good as you treat us.

753
01:01:57,506 --> 01:02:01,010
You be a gentleman,
you gonna get three hots and a cot.

754
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:05,222
Sir. If you sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

755
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:09,727
Where is it?

756
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:12,772
Here, sir. Use mine.

757
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:03,739
Senator Martin, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

758
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:10,413
Dr. Lecter,

759
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:14,417
I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

760
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:17,420
You'll want to read it before I sign.

761
01:03:20,923 --> 01:03:25,344
I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time bargaining for petty privileges.

762
01:03:25,428 --> 01:03:27,513
Clarice Starling
and that awful Jack Crawford

763
01:03:27,596 --> 01:03:29,682
have wasted far too much time already.

764
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:32,810
I only pray they haven't doomed
the poor girl.

765
01:03:33,936 --> 01:03:37,523
Let me help you now
and I will trust you when it is all over.

766
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:39,567
You have my word. Paul?

767
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:44,905
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

768
01:03:46,157 --> 01:03:47,199
I met him just once.

769
01:03:47,283 --> 01:03:50,369
He was referred to me in April
or May, 1980,

770
01:03:50,453 --> 01:03:52,788
by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

771
01:03:53,289 --> 01:03:55,374
They were lovers, you see.

772
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:58,961
But Raspail had become very frightened.

773
01:03:59,795 --> 01:04:02,965
Apparently, Louis had murdered
a transient

774
01:04:03,424 --> 01:04:06,510
and done things with her skin.

775
01:04:07,553 --> 01:04:10,639
We need his address
and a physical description.

776
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,309
Tell me, Senator.

777
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:16,395
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?

778
01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:19,148
- What?
- Did you breast-feed her?

779
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:21,859
- Now, wait a minute!
- Yes, I did.

780
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:25,946
- Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
- You son of a bitch!

781
01:04:26,155 --> 01:04:29,742
Amputate a man's leg,
and he can still feel it tickling.

782
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:33,621
Tell me, Mom,
when your little girl is on the slab,

783
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:35,706
where will it tickle you?

784
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:38,751
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

785
01:04:40,294 --> 01:04:43,380
Five-foot-ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.

786
01:04:43,506 --> 01:04:45,758
Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.

787
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:47,551
He'd be about 35 now.

788
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:50,679
He said he lived in Philadelphia,
but may have lied.

789
01:04:50,763 --> 01:04:52,765
That's all I can remember, Mom.

790
01:04:52,848 --> 01:04:55,976
But if I think of any more,
I will let you know.

791
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:00,439
Oh, and, Senator, just one more thing.

792
01:05:02,775 --> 01:05:04,360
Love your suit.

793
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,781
I tell you now
that in a meeting earlier this evening

794
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:10,116
with Senator Ruth Martin,

795
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:13,202
Dr. Lecter agreed
to assist in the investigation

796
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:16,122
of trying to find the abductor
of Catherine Martin, Buffalo Bill.

797
01:05:16,205 --> 01:05:17,206
How do you fit in, sir?

798
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:18,791
Well, it's only through
my own unique insight

799
01:05:18,874 --> 01:05:20,918
into Lecter's mind
that this breakthrough was possible.

800
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:22,086
And Buffalo Bill's real name...

801
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:26,048
Buffalo Bill's real name is now a matter
of record with the proper authorities.

802
01:05:26,132 --> 01:05:28,717
- Can you give us any more information?
- My name is Dr. Frederick Chilton.

803
01:05:28,801 --> 01:05:30,302
- How do you spell that?
- C-H...

804
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:36,475
- Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?
- Oh, well, I just saw him outside, sir.

805
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:40,271
Access to Lecter is strictly limited.
We've been getting death threats.

806
01:05:40,354 --> 01:05:42,064
I understand, sir.

807
01:05:48,112 --> 01:05:50,197
Log in. Check your weapon.

808
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:53,409
Well, I can't take all the credit for myself.

809
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:56,036
Senator Martin, the Justice Department,
the people at the FBI,

810
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,330
the folks at the Baltimore State Hospital.

811
01:05:58,414 --> 01:06:01,750
And now for the hard part,
apprehending the suspect.

812
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:04,420
Excuse me, folks,
I'm gonna have to catch a flight.

813
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,593
Command desk. Officer Jacobs.

814
01:06:19,185 --> 01:06:21,312
Is it true what they're saying?

815
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:25,441
He's some kind of vampire?

816
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:30,446
They don't have a name for what he is.

817
01:06:31,113 --> 01:06:32,990
You do know the rules, ma'am?

818
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,118
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.

819
01:06:39,455 --> 01:06:40,748
Go ahead.

820
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,536
Good evening, Clarice.

821
01:07:21,205 --> 01:07:24,541
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

822
01:07:26,669 --> 01:07:28,879
Just until you get your view.

823
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,173
How very thoughtful.

824
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:35,678
Or did Jack Crawford send you
for one last wheedle

825
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:38,013
before you're both booted off the case?

826
01:07:38,389 --> 01:07:40,724
No. I came because I wanted to.

827
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:47,564
People will say we're in love.

828
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,904
Anthrax Island.

829
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:57,533
That was an especially nice touch, Clarice.

830
01:07:57,741 --> 01:08:00,035
- Yours?
- Yes.

831
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:04,039
Yeah! That was good.

832
01:08:04,957 --> 01:08:07,001
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

833
01:08:09,545 --> 01:08:12,006
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

834
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:14,383
Louis Friend?

835
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:18,095
Iron sulfide, also known as Fool's Gold.

836
01:08:18,721 --> 01:08:22,850
Oh, Clarice. Your problem is
you need to get more fun out of life.

837
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,061
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.

838
01:08:26,145 --> 01:08:27,938
Please continue now.

839
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:31,150
Well, I have read the case files, have you?

840
01:08:31,233 --> 01:08:34,361
Everything you need to find him
is right there in those pages.

841
01:08:34,445 --> 01:08:38,907
- Then tell me how.
- First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.

842
01:08:39,408 --> 01:08:40,909
Read Marcus Aurelius.

843
01:08:40,993 --> 01:08:44,288
Of each particular thing,
ask what is it in itself?

844
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:46,290
What is its nature?

845
01:08:46,749 --> 01:08:50,002
What does he do, this man you seek?

846
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:53,714
He kills women.

847
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:56,342
No! That is incidental.

848
01:08:57,509 --> 01:08:59,345
What is the first
and principal thing he does?

849
01:08:59,428 --> 01:09:02,681
What needs does he serve by killing?

850
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:04,433
Anger.

851
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:10,481
Social acceptance
and sexual frustrations...

852
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:13,484
No! He covets.

853
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:16,570
That is his nature.

854
01:09:16,904 --> 01:09:19,531
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

855
01:09:20,032 --> 01:09:22,368
Do we seek out things to covet?

856
01:09:23,202 --> 01:09:25,245
Make an effort to answer now.

857
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:27,623
No. We just...

858
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:31,126
No. We begin by coveting
what we see every day.

859
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:34,797
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

860
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:38,842
And don't your eyes
seek out the things you want?

861
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:42,012
All right. Yes. Now please tell me how.

862
01:09:42,388 --> 01:09:46,266
No. It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

863
01:09:46,475 --> 01:09:49,353
You don't have any more vacations to sell.

864
01:09:49,728 --> 01:09:51,980
Why did you leave that ranch?

865
01:09:52,481 --> 01:09:56,193
Doctor, we don't have anymore time
for any of this now.

866
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:59,363
But we don't reckon time the same way,
do we, Clarice?

867
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:01,407
This is all the time you'll ever have.

868
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,909
Later. Now, please, listen to me.
We've only got five...

869
01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:06,578
No! I will listen now.

870
01:10:09,581 --> 01:10:11,417
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

871
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,751
You were ten years old.

872
01:10:12,835 --> 01:10:16,588
You went to live with cousins
on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

873
01:10:16,672 --> 01:10:17,798
And?

874
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:22,094
And one morning, I just ran away.

875
01:10:22,803 --> 01:10:25,848
Not "just", Clarice. What set you off?

876
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,060
- You started at what time?
- Early. Still dark.

877
01:10:30,436 --> 01:10:34,440
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream? What was it?

878
01:10:35,816 --> 01:10:37,818
I heard a strange noise.

879
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,195
What was it?

880
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:44,241
It was screaming.

881
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:49,163
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.

882
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:51,165
What did you do?

883
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:55,085
I went downstairs, outside.

884
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:59,965
I crept up into the barn.

885
01:11:00,716 --> 01:11:03,719
I was so scared to look inside, but I had to.

886
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:08,056
And what did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?

887
01:11:09,808 --> 01:11:13,395
Lambs. They were screaming.

888
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:17,274
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

889
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:19,693
And they were screaming.

890
01:11:20,903 --> 01:11:23,405
- And you ran away?
- No.

891
01:11:24,615 --> 01:11:26,742
First I tried to free them.

892
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:29,745
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

893
01:11:29,828 --> 01:11:33,123
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

894
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:36,210
But you could and you did, didn't you?

895
01:11:36,919 --> 01:11:40,380
Yes. I took one lamb,
and I ran away as fast as I could.

896
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:43,050
- Where were you going, Clarice?
- I don't know.

897
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:47,846
I didn't have any food, any water,
and it was very cold, very cold.

898
01:11:50,516 --> 01:11:54,603
I thought if I could save just one, but,

899
01:11:57,147 --> 01:11:58,774
he was so heavy.

900
01:11:59,775 --> 01:12:01,443
He was so heavy.

901
01:12:06,657 --> 01:12:11,036
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

902
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:15,040
The rancher was so angry,

903
01:12:15,123 --> 01:12:18,627
he sent me to live
at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

904
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:20,921
I never saw the ranch again.

905
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:23,966
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

906
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:27,803
They killed him.

907
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:30,264
You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

908
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:34,935
Wake up in the dark
and hear the screaming of the lambs.

909
01:12:35,978 --> 01:12:37,104
Yes.

910
01:12:38,814 --> 01:12:43,110
And you think if you save poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?

911
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:45,571
You think if Catherine lives,

912
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:48,407
you won't wake up in the dark ever again

913
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:51,535
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

914
01:12:52,911 --> 01:12:55,872
I don't know. I don't know.

915
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:01,712
Thank you, Clarice. Thank you.

916
01:13:02,588 --> 01:13:04,631
Tell me his name, Doctor.

917
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:13,515
Dr. Chilton, I presume.

918
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:16,518
I think you know each other.

919
01:13:18,186 --> 01:13:19,479
Okay.

920
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,482
- We found her.
- Let's go!

921
01:13:22,733 --> 01:13:24,693
It's your turn, Doctor.

922
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,903
- Out.
- Tell me his name.

923
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:29,656
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders.
I have to put you on a plane.

924
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:31,116
Come on now.

925
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:32,743
Brave Clarice.

926
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:37,205
You will let me know when
those lambs stop screaming, won't you?

927
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:39,291
Tell me his name, Doctor!

928
01:13:39,374 --> 01:13:40,626
Clarice!

929
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,545
Your case file.

930
01:13:48,717 --> 01:13:50,427
Goodbye, Clarice.

931
01:14:56,243 --> 01:14:58,245
Ready when you are, Doc.

932
01:14:58,453 --> 01:15:00,622
Just another minute, please.

933
01:15:09,548 --> 01:15:11,967
The son of a bitch
demanded a second dinner.

934
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:14,052
Lamb chops, extra rare.

935
01:15:14,136 --> 01:15:16,054
Wonder what he wants for breakfast.

936
01:15:16,138 --> 01:15:18,390
Some damn thing from the zoo?

937
01:15:40,245 --> 01:15:42,038
Good evening, gentlemen.

938
01:15:42,122 --> 01:15:45,625
- Okay, Doc. Grab some floor.
- Same drill as before, please.

939
01:15:53,216 --> 01:15:55,761
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

940
01:16:11,985 --> 01:16:13,111
Okay.

941
01:16:19,993 --> 01:16:21,995
Hand me that, would you?

942
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:28,376
Thanks.

943
01:16:32,214 --> 01:16:34,299
Mind the drawings, please.

944
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:38,720
Thank you.

945
01:17:03,078 --> 01:17:05,413
- Jimmy, watch it! He's got me!
- Jesus, Bill!

946
01:17:12,379 --> 01:17:13,880
Jesus Christ!

947
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,086
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

948
01:18:44,346 --> 01:18:46,014
What is this shit?

949
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:52,520
- Did somebody go up on five?
- No. Nobody went up.

950
01:18:52,854 --> 01:18:54,773
Call Pembry. Ask him...

951
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,153
CP, shots fired on five. Repeat.

952
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:03,073
- Shots fired on five.
- Sergeant Tate.

953
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:07,118
Holy shit.

954
01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:09,037
What the hell? Bitch!

955
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:10,830
Shut up.

956
01:19:11,122 --> 01:19:13,667
- Bobby, get the vest.
- Right, Sarge.

957
01:19:14,334 --> 01:19:16,211
- Brady, Howard...
- Look!

958
01:19:19,339 --> 01:19:20,715
It stopped.

959
01:19:22,217 --> 01:19:23,927
Seal off a 10 block radius.

960
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:26,805
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance double-quick.

961
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:28,098
We're going up.

962
01:19:57,252 --> 01:19:58,837
Pembry!

963
01:20:00,338 --> 01:20:02,090
Boyle!

964
01:20:14,728 --> 01:20:15,937
Oh, God!

965
01:20:23,236 --> 01:20:24,279
Go.

966
01:20:32,078 --> 01:20:33,538
- Clear!
- Clear!

967
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:36,583
Command post, two officers down.

968
01:20:36,958 --> 01:20:38,293
- Clear!
- Clear!

969
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,545
Lecter's gone, Sarge.

970
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:42,464
The prisoner is missing.

971
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:44,466
Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.

972
01:20:44,549 --> 01:20:47,135
Repeat. Lecter is missing and armed.

973
01:20:47,218 --> 01:20:50,263
He stripped the bed.
Might be making a rope.

974
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:52,015
Check all windows.

975
01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:54,476
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

976
01:20:55,143 --> 01:20:56,519
He's alive.

977
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:59,314
Sergeant Tate, he's alive!

978
01:20:59,814 --> 01:21:02,942
Get a hold of him where you can
feel his hands, son. Talk to him.

979
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:04,694
What do I say?

980
01:21:04,778 --> 01:21:07,572
It's Jim Pembry! Now talk to him, damn it!

981
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:10,700
Lecter is missing and armed.

982
01:21:10,867 --> 01:21:13,119
Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me?

983
01:21:13,203 --> 01:21:16,206
He took Boyle's gun.
Pembry got off one round.

984
01:21:16,289 --> 01:21:18,249
There's a chance Lecter was hit.

985
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:20,460
Keep breathing in and out. That's it.

986
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:23,797
You're doing a good job.
You look real good there.

987
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:27,342
Yeah, you look... You look real good.

988
01:21:44,651 --> 01:21:45,777
- You ready?
- Let's go.

989
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:47,737
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

990
01:21:58,832 --> 01:22:01,000
Looking good, Pembry.
You're gonna make it.

991
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:03,169
You're just fine. You're doing all right.
That's right.

992
01:22:03,253 --> 01:22:05,672
- Okay, I need that IV now.
- Lactated ringers.

993
01:22:05,755 --> 01:22:07,006
Can we get the strap?

994
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:08,133
Where's the fucking oxygen?

995
01:22:08,216 --> 01:22:09,926
- Looking good, buddy. That's right.
- Bob!

996
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:11,845
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

997
01:22:13,513 --> 01:22:15,723
We're losing him. Downstairs. Take him!

998
01:22:16,558 --> 01:22:17,725
And up!

999
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:20,436
- Elevator!
- Out of the way!

1000
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,063
Out of the way!

1001
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:28,236
<i>CP to Tate.</i>

1002
01:22:28,903 --> 01:22:31,114
Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

1003
01:22:31,823 --> 01:22:34,659
I'm on the elevator bringing Pembry down.

1004
01:22:34,909 --> 01:22:36,953
He seems to be hanging on.

1005
01:22:37,579 --> 01:22:39,581
Top three floors secured.

1006
01:22:40,248 --> 01:22:42,125
Main stairwell secured.

1007
01:22:43,209 --> 01:22:45,003
We think he's on two.

1008
01:22:58,308 --> 01:23:00,435
<i>Tate, are you still with me?</i>

1009
01:23:02,437 --> 01:23:04,814
We're pretty sure
he's somewhere on two, sir.

1010
01:23:04,898 --> 01:23:06,900
That's all for now. Over.

1011
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:28,796
He's on the roof of the elevator.

1012
01:23:31,549 --> 01:23:32,967
Okay, guys.

1013
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:50,860
I see him.

1014
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:53,905
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

1015
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:56,074
One warning. We need him alive.

1016
01:23:56,157 --> 01:23:57,492
<i>Got him.</i>

1017
01:23:58,076 --> 01:23:59,327
Lecter.

1018
01:23:59,702 --> 01:24:01,871
Put your hands on your head.

1019
01:24:03,998 --> 01:24:05,500
One in the leg.

1020
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:17,929
No movement.

1021
01:24:19,264 --> 01:24:22,350
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're coming into the car.

1022
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:25,687
- We're opening the hatch.
- Watch his hands.

1023
01:24:25,812 --> 01:24:29,023
If there's any fire,
it'll come from us. Affirm.

1024
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:30,400
<i>Got it.</i>

1025
01:24:56,384 --> 01:24:58,469
Memphis General, this is Medical Unit 26.

1026
01:24:58,553 --> 01:25:01,139
We're inbound with a 50-year-old
male police officer

1027
01:25:01,222 --> 01:25:03,641
with severe facial lacerations.
Weapon unknown.

1028
01:25:03,725 --> 01:25:06,686
We've got grand mal seizure activity,
but he's postictal now.

1029
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:07,812
<i>Copy that.</i>

1030
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:10,815
Vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.

1031
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:12,358
- <i>Ninety?</i>
- Yeah, that's right. 90.

1032
01:25:12,442 --> 01:25:13,735
Pulse, 84.

1033
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:15,486
We've got him on lactated ringers running.

1034
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:18,114
And the patient is on 10 liters...

1035
01:25:25,288 --> 01:25:28,583
They found the ambulance
in a parking garage at Memphis Airport.

1036
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:30,168
The crew was dead.

1037
01:25:31,252 --> 01:25:34,756
He killed a tourist, too.
Got his clothes, cash.

1038
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:37,342
By now he could be anywhere.

1039
01:25:37,425 --> 01:25:39,385
- He won't come after me.
- Oh, really?

1040
01:25:39,469 --> 01:25:41,929
No, he won't. I can't explain it.

1041
01:25:42,013 --> 01:25:44,640
He would consider that rude.

1042
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:47,727
It's over. She's dead.

1043
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:49,854
It's not your fault it worked out like this.

1044
01:25:49,937 --> 01:25:51,689
The thing is that,
Lecter said everything we need

1045
01:25:51,773 --> 01:25:54,359
to catch him with is right here
in these pages, only I can't...

1046
01:25:54,442 --> 01:25:58,112
- Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.
- He's here, Ardelia.

1047
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:29,560
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

1048
01:26:31,771 --> 01:26:34,440
"Clarice, doesn't this random scattering
of sites

1049
01:26:34,524 --> 01:26:38,528
"seem desperately random?
Like the elaboration of a bad liar.

1050
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:40,405
"Ta, Hannibal Lecter."

1051
01:26:40,488 --> 01:26:43,157
Desperately random? What does he mean?

1052
01:26:43,324 --> 01:26:46,452
Not random at all maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.

1053
01:26:47,829 --> 01:26:51,082
Yeah, but there is no pattern,
or the computers would have nailed it.

1054
01:26:51,165 --> 01:26:53,000
They're even found in random order.

1055
01:26:53,626 --> 01:26:57,213
Random because of the one girl.
The one he weighted down.

1056
01:26:58,089 --> 01:26:59,841
- Fredrica Bimmel...
- Right.

1057
01:26:59,924 --> 01:27:03,219
From Belvedere, Ohio.

1058
01:27:03,678 --> 01:27:07,348
First girl taken, third body found. Why?

1059
01:27:07,473 --> 01:27:09,767
Well, she didn't drift.
He weighted her down.

1060
01:27:09,851 --> 01:27:12,937
What did Lecter say
about the first principles?

1061
01:27:13,354 --> 01:27:14,689
Simplicity.

1062
01:27:15,106 --> 01:27:17,650
What does this guy do? He covets.

1063
01:27:18,568 --> 01:27:20,862
How do we first start to covet?

1064
01:27:21,529 --> 01:27:24,157
- We covet what we see...
- Every day.

1065
01:27:26,784 --> 01:27:29,287
- Hot damn, Clarice.
- He knew her.

1066
01:28:45,196 --> 01:28:47,365
- Mr. Bimmel?
- That's me.

1067
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:51,244
Hello. I'm Clarice Starling.
I'm with the FBI.

1068
01:28:54,789 --> 01:28:57,959
I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.

1069
01:28:58,668 --> 01:29:00,920
I don't know nothing new to tell you.

1070
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:04,215
Police been back here
so many times already.

1071
01:29:04,632 --> 01:29:08,177
Fredrica went into Chicago on the bus
to see about a job.

1072
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:12,098
She left the interview okay.
She never come home.

1073
01:29:15,268 --> 01:29:17,478
Her bedroom's how she left it.

1074
01:29:17,812 --> 01:29:20,439
Upstairs. Door to the left.

1075
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:09,400
<i>He's making himself a woman suit,
Mr. Crawford, out of real women.</i>

1076
01:32:09,483 --> 01:32:12,403
And he can sew, this guy.
He's very skilled.

1077
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:14,947
- He's a tailor or a dressmaker or...
- <i>Starling...</i>

1078
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:17,450
That's why they're all so big.
He has to keep them alive

1079
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:18,617
so he can starve them a while,

1080
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:20,578
- so he can loosen their skin and take...
- <i>Starling.</i>

1081
01:32:20,661 --> 01:32:23,247
<i>Starling. Starling,
we know who he is and where he is.</i>

1082
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:25,583
<i>-We're on our way right now.
- Where?</i>

1083
01:32:25,833 --> 01:32:30,546
Calumet City, edge of Chicago.
Be on the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.

1084
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:33,007
Oh, that's great news, sir, but how...

1085
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:35,009
<i>Johns Hopkins came up with some names.</i>

1086
01:32:35,176 --> 01:32:36,635
<i>We fed him into "Known Offenders."</i>

1087
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:40,848
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb,
AKA John Grant.

1088
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:43,434
<i>Lecter's description is accurate.
He just lied about the name.</i>

1089
01:32:43,517 --> 01:32:44,643
<i>Listen to this.</i>

1090
01:32:44,852 --> 01:32:47,062
Customs had some paper on him.

1091
01:32:47,313 --> 01:32:50,232
They stopped a carton two years ago
at LAX.

1092
01:32:50,483 --> 01:32:52,777
Live caterpillars from Surinam.

1093
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:55,404
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1094
01:32:56,363 --> 01:32:58,324
Well, Chicago's only 400 miles from here.

1095
01:32:58,407 --> 01:33:00,201
- I'll be there in...
- No, <i>no, no, Starling.</i>

1096
01:33:00,284 --> 01:33:03,579
There's not enough time.
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

1097
01:33:03,746 --> 01:33:06,165
I need you to link him to the Bimmel girl
before he's indicted.

1098
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:10,336
- See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.
- Yes, sir. You bet. I'll do my best.

1099
01:33:10,419 --> 01:33:13,714
Starling, we wouldn't have found him
without you.

1100
01:33:14,256 --> 01:33:17,551
Nobody's gonna forget that.
Least of all me.

1101
01:33:19,136 --> 01:33:22,348
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.

1102
01:33:24,058 --> 01:33:25,518
Mr. Crawford?

1103
01:33:38,072 --> 01:33:42,034
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.
I got a better idea.

1104
01:34:03,973 --> 01:34:06,392
Okay, Precious. Time for a little treat.

1105
01:34:19,488 --> 01:34:20,781
Precious!

1106
01:34:23,367 --> 01:34:24,869
Come on, girl!

1107
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:28,706
Come on, Precious. Come on, Precious!

1108
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,550
Come on, Precious!

1109
01:34:39,842 --> 01:34:42,386
I got a yummy, yummy snack for you.

1110
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,138
Come on. Come and get it.

1111
01:34:51,103 --> 01:34:52,396
Precious!

1112
01:34:53,314 --> 01:34:55,774
Are you up there, you little shit?

1113
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:58,861
Come and get it, pretty girl.

1114
01:35:05,993 --> 01:35:09,538
Precious. Please come. Come on.

1115
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,964
Come on...

1116
01:35:31,352 --> 01:35:33,020
Would you fuck me?

1117
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:35,689
Come on. Take that bone. Come on.

1118
01:35:36,941 --> 01:35:39,693
Come on. Come. Come on.

1119
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:41,528
I'd fuck me.

1120
01:35:42,154 --> 01:35:43,405
Come on.

1121
01:35:47,451 --> 01:35:49,161
I'd fuck me hard.

1122
01:35:49,578 --> 01:35:51,413
I'd fuck me so hard.

1123
01:35:56,335 --> 01:35:57,378
No.

1124
01:36:58,522 --> 01:37:00,691
Is that a good job, FBI agent?

1125
01:37:00,774 --> 01:37:04,945
You get to travel around and stuff?
I mean, better places than this?

1126
01:37:06,613 --> 01:37:08,240
Sometimes you do.

1127
01:37:09,074 --> 01:37:12,786
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.

1128
01:37:13,579 --> 01:37:17,332
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

1129
01:37:17,624 --> 01:37:20,044
She thought it was such hot shit.

1130
01:37:20,627 --> 01:37:22,880
What did she know? Big dummy.

1131
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:25,382
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man

1132
01:37:25,466 --> 01:37:29,136
named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?

1133
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:32,014
- How about John Grant?
- No.

1134
01:37:32,473 --> 01:37:33,432
Oh, would she have had a friend

1135
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:34,725
that you didn't know about, or...

1136
01:37:34,808 --> 01:37:37,644
No way. If she had a guy, I'd have known,
believe me.

1137
01:37:37,728 --> 01:37:39,480
Sewing was her life.

1138
01:37:40,064 --> 01:37:41,899
Did you two ever work together?

1139
01:37:41,982 --> 01:37:43,984
Oh, sure. Me and Pam Malavesi
used to help her

1140
01:37:44,068 --> 01:37:46,612
do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman.

1141
01:37:47,071 --> 01:37:50,032
Can you give me Mrs. Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.

1142
01:38:18,811 --> 01:38:21,814
So powerful. So beautiful.

1143
01:38:27,361 --> 01:38:28,695
Precious?

1144
01:38:34,618 --> 01:38:35,661
Precious?

1145
01:38:35,744 --> 01:38:37,996
Down here, you sack of shit!

1146
01:38:46,797 --> 01:38:47,881
Put her in that bucket.

1147
01:38:47,965 --> 01:38:51,510
No! You get me a telephone
and lower it down here. Now!

1148
01:38:54,221 --> 01:38:56,598
Poolie-poo. Precious.

1149
01:38:56,890 --> 01:38:58,559
Darling heart, are you all right?

1150
01:38:58,642 --> 01:39:01,770
She's in a lot of pain, mister.
She needs a vet.

1151
01:39:05,858 --> 01:39:08,777
She broke her leg on the way down.
I know it. She's been licking...

1152
01:39:08,861 --> 01:39:10,904
Hey, don't you hurt my dog!

1153
01:39:10,988 --> 01:39:15,367
- Don't you make me hurt your dog!
- Oh, you don't know what pain is!

1154
01:39:20,664 --> 01:39:24,459
Get me a live telephone line down here
or the dog's dead!

1155
01:39:28,839 --> 01:39:29,840
Damn fuck.

1156
01:39:29,923 --> 01:39:31,842
Get me that telephone!

1157
01:39:33,385 --> 01:39:35,345
I'm gonna do it, mister!

1158
01:39:35,596 --> 01:39:38,932
I'll snap her neck off. I swear to God!

1159
01:39:40,058 --> 01:39:41,643
You little fuck.

1160
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:51,195
Down here! Down here!

1161
01:39:51,278 --> 01:39:52,613
Help!

1162
01:40:05,292 --> 01:40:07,169
Okay, I'm coming.

1163
01:40:09,296 --> 01:40:10,797
We're going in.

1164
01:40:15,469 --> 01:40:18,055
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.

1165
01:40:18,472 --> 01:40:20,224
I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family.

1166
01:40:20,891 --> 01:40:23,644
- FBI! Everybody down!
- Everybody down, now!

1167
01:40:23,977 --> 01:40:25,562
No. The Lippmans don't live here anymore.

1168
01:40:25,646 --> 01:40:28,774
No. Excuse me, sir.
I really need to speak with you.

1169
01:40:29,733 --> 01:40:31,485
- Clear!
- Clear!

1170
01:40:32,277 --> 01:40:34,488
What's the problem, Officer?

1171
01:40:34,613 --> 01:40:38,075
Well, I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.

1172
01:40:40,827 --> 01:40:42,329
There's no one here, Jack.

1173
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:46,041
Clarice.

1174
01:40:46,333 --> 01:40:47,501
Your name is?

1175
01:40:47,584 --> 01:40:50,170
- Oh, Jack Gordon.
- Mr. Gordon. Good.

1176
01:40:51,129 --> 01:40:54,549
Well, Fredrica used to work
for Mrs. Lippman. Did you know her?

1177
01:40:55,259 --> 01:40:56,593
No.

1178
01:40:57,552 --> 01:40:58,845
Oh, wait.

1179
01:40:59,221 --> 01:41:01,515
Was she a great, big fat person?

1180
01:41:02,349 --> 01:41:05,060
- Yes. She was a big girl, sir.
- Yeah, I...

1181
01:41:05,394 --> 01:41:08,230
I may have...
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

1182
01:41:10,232 --> 01:41:12,693
Mrs. Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.

1183
01:41:12,776 --> 01:41:16,113
I got his card in here someplace.
Do you want to come in while I look for it?

1184
01:41:16,196 --> 01:41:17,406
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

1185
01:41:17,489 --> 01:41:18,824
Thank you.

1186
01:41:37,551 --> 01:41:40,053
Are you close to catching somebody,
you think?

1187
01:41:41,179 --> 01:41:43,140
Yes. We may be.

1188
01:41:45,559 --> 01:41:46,810
Did you

1189
01:41:47,728 --> 01:41:50,897
take over this place
after Mrs. Lippman died? Is that right?

1190
01:41:52,649 --> 01:41:56,695
Yeah. I bought this house two years ago.

1191
01:41:58,238 --> 01:42:01,366
Did she leave any records,
any business records,

1192
01:42:01,783 --> 01:42:04,911
tax forms, list of employees?

1193
01:42:06,121 --> 01:42:08,332
No. Nothing like that at all.

1194
01:42:10,584 --> 01:42:13,086
Say, has the FBI learned something?

1195
01:42:13,503 --> 01:42:16,381
The police around here
don't seem to have the first clue.

1196
01:42:26,391 --> 01:42:31,021
I mean, have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

1197
01:42:32,439 --> 01:42:33,482
No.

1198
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:37,861
No, we don't.

1199
01:42:47,287 --> 01:42:49,915
Yeah. Here's that number.

1200
01:42:51,958 --> 01:42:55,295
Very good, Mr. Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?

1201
01:43:03,887 --> 01:43:05,931
Sure you can use my phone.

1202
01:43:07,307 --> 01:43:08,517
Freeze!

1203
01:43:09,309 --> 01:43:12,854
Put your hands over your head!
And turn around! Spread your legs!

1204
01:43:14,481 --> 01:43:17,943
Spread your legs!
Put your hands in the back! Thumbs up!

1205
01:43:18,026 --> 01:43:19,069
Freeze!

1206
01:44:32,017 --> 01:44:33,518
Hey!

1207
01:44:53,747 --> 01:44:55,707
Hello! Are you there?

1208
01:44:57,626 --> 01:44:59,961
I'm down here! I'm down here!

1209
01:45:20,065 --> 01:45:22,776
- Catherine Martin?
- Yes!

1210
01:45:24,945 --> 01:45:27,364
FBI! You're safe!

1211
01:45:27,948 --> 01:45:30,325
Safe, shit! Get me out of here!

1212
01:45:45,966 --> 01:45:48,051
You're all right, Catherine. Where is he?

1213
01:45:48,134 --> 01:45:51,137
How the fuck should I know?
Just get me out of here!

1214
01:45:51,221 --> 01:45:54,307
Catherine, you've got to be quiet.
Now shut that dog up!

1215
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:56,518
Just get me out of here!

1216
01:45:57,644 --> 01:45:59,020
Oh, my God.

1217
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:03,733
Catherine, I'm going to get you
out of there,

1218
01:46:03,817 --> 01:46:05,527
but right now, you listen to me.

1219
01:46:05,652 --> 01:46:08,113
I've got to leave this room.
I'll be right back.

1220
01:46:08,196 --> 01:46:10,949
No! Don't you leave me here,
you fucking bitch!

1221
01:46:11,032 --> 01:46:13,493
No! Don't you leave me here!

1222
01:46:13,702 --> 01:46:15,996
This guy's fucking crazy!

1223
01:46:18,873 --> 01:46:20,500
Please!

1224
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:23,920
I've got to get out of here!

1225
01:46:26,381 --> 01:46:30,343
Catherine, the other officers will be here
any minute now!

1226
01:46:31,344 --> 01:46:32,596
Wait!

1227
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:35,056
Don't go! Please!

1228
01:46:35,181 --> 01:46:36,349
Quiet!

1229
01:46:38,852 --> 01:46:40,312
Oh, God!

1230
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:28,122
No...

1231
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:39,676
- You okay?
- Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm okay.

1232
01:50:39,759 --> 01:50:42,637
Agent Starling, how did you track
Buffalo Bill to this address?

1233
01:50:49,143 --> 01:50:51,604
Clarice M. Starling.

1234
01:50:54,107 --> 01:50:55,775
Congratulations.

1235
01:51:08,997 --> 01:51:11,165
Ernest W. Stevens.

1236
01:51:29,934 --> 01:51:33,146
- Special Agent Starling.
- Oh, Special Agent Mapp.

1237
01:51:33,354 --> 01:51:34,731
- Phone call.
- Thank you.

1238
01:51:34,814 --> 01:51:37,150
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Starling.

1239
01:51:39,903 --> 01:51:42,363
Pitch, could you take our picture?

1240
01:51:42,906 --> 01:51:43,990
Sure.

1241
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:48,328
Look, I just wanted to say congratulations.

1242
01:51:48,703 --> 01:51:50,580
And I'm not much good
at this kind of thing,

1243
01:51:50,663 --> 01:51:52,457
so I'm gonna duck out of here.

1244
01:51:52,540 --> 01:51:53,833
Okay, sure.

1245
01:51:55,543 --> 01:51:57,462
Thank you, Mr. Crawford.

1246
01:52:05,094 --> 01:52:07,847
Your father would have been proud today.

1247
01:52:10,767 --> 01:52:12,977
Don't forget your phone call.

1248
01:52:17,190 --> 01:52:18,483
Starling.

1249
01:52:18,691 --> 01:52:23,029
Well, Clarice,
have the lambs stopped screaming?

1250
01:52:23,696 --> 01:52:24,864
Dr. Lecter.

1251
01:52:25,114 --> 01:52:28,034
Don't bother with a trace.
I won't be on long enough.

1252
01:52:31,704 --> 01:52:35,917
- Where are you, Dr. Lecter?
- I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.

1253
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,503
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

1254
01:52:39,045 --> 01:52:42,173
<i>So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy.</i>

1255
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:44,717
You know I can't make that promise.

1256
01:52:45,259 --> 01:52:47,929
I do wish we could chat longer, but...

1257
01:52:48,972 --> 01:52:51,557
I'm having an old friend for dinner.

1258
01:52:53,101 --> 01:52:54,185
Bye.

1259
01:52:54,811 --> 01:52:56,229
<i>Dr. Lecter...</i>

1260
01:52:58,690 --> 01:53:00,066
Dr. Lecter.

1261
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:03,736
Dr. Lecter.

1262
01:53:05,738 --> 01:53:07,073
Dr. Lecter.

1263
01:53:07,615 --> 01:53:09,742
Hey, what? Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

1264
01:53:10,076 --> 01:53:12,996
- Is the security system all set up?
- We have the big-shot security.

1265
01:53:13,079 --> 01:53:14,580
Thank you. I appreciate that.
