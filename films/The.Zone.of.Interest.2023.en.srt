1
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,270
Go past me children.

2
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,398
There are some to my left

3
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,601
and some ahead here.

4
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,187
No.
-Yes.

5
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,359
No.
-Yes.

6
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,950
Sleep child sleep.

7
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,194
Don't sit on me.

8
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,492
I didn't sit on you.

9
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,914
That's what happens
when you stamp on my foot.

10
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,149
You'd better not throw a
bucket of water over me.

11
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,938
No, we'd never do that.

12
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,815
It better not make me late.

13
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,275
This way... and out.

14
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,367
Watch out for the steps.

15
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,745
Feel for it... and down. Perfect.

16
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,044
Last step, and now turn around.

17
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,879
There you go. Wait. Stand here.

18
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,926
Surprise.

19
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,720
Is this for me?
-Yes.

20
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,558
Thank you.
-Happy birthday.

21
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,980
Where did you get it?

22
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,395
I have my sources.

23
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,401
One, two, three passengers.

24
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,362
Who wants the first ride?
-Me.

25
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,242
You.
You can have the first ride.

26
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,368
The paint is still fresh.

27
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,242
Annagret will have a green bottom.

28
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,765
Coats, bags, off to school.

29
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,108
Thank you children.

30
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,274
Goodbye.

31
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,617
Inge, pull your socks up.

32
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,380
Bye-bye Daddy.

33
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,315
Phlox.

34
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,496
Would you like to smell a rose?

35
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,625
Smell a rose. Yes. This one.

36
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,713
This one is beautiful.

37
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,724
Look, what a big dahlia.

38
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,694
And a ladybird. Yes.

39
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,742
Bronek.

40
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,347
Marta.

41
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,478
Upstairs please.

42
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,727
Then come and see me.

43
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,231
Sophie.

44
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,785
Aniela, come.

45
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,416
Choose something you like. Only one each.

46
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,088
Take something.
-Thank you.

47
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,410
This one needs to be cleaned

48
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,495
and the lining has to be mended.

49
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,581
Be careful with it.
-Of course.

50
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,412
Go back downstairs.

51
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,606
The bees are flying.

52
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,527
It is hot, isn't it?

53
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,073
How was your journey?

54
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,622
Long. But we're here now.

55
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,787
Yes indeed. So, not too bad?

56
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,247
No, not too bad.

57
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,871
Easier than last time actually.

58
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,212
Excellent. Well then, welcome back.

59
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,756
Absolutely. We're glad to be here.

60
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,638
Should we take our shoes off as well?
-No.

61
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,679
Did you travel via Prague or Vienna?

62
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,438
Prague. It is 56 minutes faster.

63
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,211
She asked me where I got

64
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,630
one of my jackets from.

65
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,968
I said, "Canada."

66
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,428
And she asked, "How did you get to Canada?"

67
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,599
She thought you meant the country?
-Of course.

68
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,217
An understandable mistake.

69
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,722
The same thing happened
when Helga Pattisch came for the first time.

70
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,145
Out of all of the clothes, she chose a dress

71
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:12,236
that belonged to some little
Jewess half her size.

72
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,528
I could only pull the zipper up to here,

73
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,991
and the dress came apart.

74
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,235
And I pulled and pulled at it.

75
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,910
She just looked down at herself and said,

76
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,749
"I love this dress."

77
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,663
In the end she took it.

78
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,754
And she said, "I'll go on a diet."

79
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,507
Would you like more coffee?
-Yes please. Thank you.

80
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,137
You take it black?
-Black is good, thank you.

81
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,813
Helga's husband only adopted

82
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:51,355
that little Polish boy to keep her at home.

83
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,487
That's what she told me.

84
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,947
And he hits her as well.

85
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,571
I didn't know that.
-How do you know that?

86
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:06,495
Haven't you noticed the bruises on her arms?

87
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,786
I forgot to tell you something.

88
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,798
Guess where I found this diamond?

89
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,042
In the toothpaste.

90
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,634
No. Really?

91
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,512
How clever you must have to be.

92
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,051
Yes, they are very clever.

93
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,141
I've ordered more toothpaste
because you never know.

94
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,910
I think I told you about
the Schilling concert.

95
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,659
About Brigitte Frank's ermine fur coat.

96
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,003
Did I tell you about it?
-I don't think so.

97
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,166
Look.

98
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,879
She looks like an empress.

99
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,132
The other side of it is the next chamber

100
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:04,132
with the next load ready to burn

101
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,225
once the pieces here

102
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,346
have been completely incinerated.

103
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,646
How long does it take?

104
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:14,018
7 hours, 400 to 500 at a time.

105
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,643
Closer to 500.

106
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,979
So, once that has happened,

107
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,358
you close this chimney,

108
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,781
then simultaneously open the next.

109
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,655
The fire will follow the air,

110
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,624
through this baffle of course,

111
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,370
into this chamber and then burn this load.

112
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:38,967
The chamber directly opposite
the combustion zone,

113
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,258
which burns at roughly 1,000 degrees,

114
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:49,728
has by now cooled to around 40 degrees.

115
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,437
Cool enough to unload the ash

116
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,064
and then reload the chamber.

117
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,192
So, this chamber is cooling

118
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,810
while this one is heating up?

119
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:02,908
Correct. The process moves one chamber over,

120
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,651
counterclockwise.

121
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:09,990
So, burn, cool, unload, reload.

122
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,408
And...

123
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,667
Continuously.

124
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,931
Cheers.

125
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,052
Dilla.

126
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,770
Happy birthday, Commandant.

127
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,437
Happy birthday, Commandant.

128
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,860
It is an honour to serve under you.

129
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,073
Thank you.

130
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,317
Happy birthday, Commandant.

131
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,489
Thank you.

132
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,454
Happy birthday, Commandant.

133
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,075
Thank you.

134
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,784
That is a rifle.

135
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,250
And this is also a rifle.

136
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,882
And here is one with a pistol,

137
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,172
and another rifle here.

138
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,233
Do you hear that?

139
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:32,831
It's a bittern. A heron.
A Eurasian grey heron.

140
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,911
You cried like this too.

141
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,280
You were even louder.

142
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,042
What's going on with her?

143
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,626
She's strong, isn't she?

144
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,124
I'd like to try mine now.

145
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,992
What are you doing?

146
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,410
What are you doing?

147
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,578
I'm looking.

148
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,251
At what?

149
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:43,748
Teeth.

150
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,050
What are you doing?

151
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,555
Nothing.

152
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:17,948
What are you doing here?

153
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,402
I'm handing out sugar.

154
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,406
Who to?

155
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,496
I'm looking.

156
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:29,452
Come.

157
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:48,103
Then, a little white bird flew past

158
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,603
to guide them out of the forest.

159
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,606
Soon they arrived at a huge lake.

160
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,197
They were puzzled as they
did not know how to cross it.

161
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:03,954
Suddenly, a big beautiful swan
came swimming towards them

162
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,952
"Oh beautiful swan, please be our boat."

163
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:12,746
The swan bent its neck and came to the shore.

164
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,651
Bracht phoned the house.

165
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,701
Yes, while you were outside for your toast.

166
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:47,205
I forgot to tell you.
He said he'd call back tomorrow, midday.

167
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,583
Rudolf.

168
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,380
Will you take me to that spa in Italy again?

169
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,473
All that pampering.

170
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:12,101
And the walks. And that nice couple we met.

171
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,192
Is she wandering around again?
-No.

172
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,616
And that man

173
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,738
who played the accordion to the cows?

174
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,990
They loved it.

175
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,122
It was so funny.

176
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,080
All looking at him like this.

177
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,555
Will you?

178
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,676
What?
-Well, take me back there.

179
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,431
Yes.
-When?

180
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,638
I don't know when.

181
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,776
You smell nice.

182
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,779
It's French.

183
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,456
Oink, oink.

184
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:39,225
Chocolate. If you see it. Any goodies.

185
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:23,735
To the head of the Party Chancellery
Reichsleiter Bormann.

186
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:24,899
Personal.

187
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,780
Dear Reichsleiter

188
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,944
I have learned that the commandant
of the gigantic K.L. Auschwitz

189
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,616
Obersturmbannführer Höss

190
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,160
also well known to you,

191
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,657
is to be transferred.

192
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,994
Comrade Höss has made
unprecedented achievements

193
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,121
over four years of painstaking work.

194
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,716
I witnessed the construction
of this great camp close up

195
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,505
so can attest.

196
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:52,928
Reichsführer Himmler himself acknowledges
the uniqueness of what he built.

197
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,393
Now it is said that the
task is too big for him

198
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,263
and that someone must take his place.

199
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,566
Höss knows prisoner use inside out

200
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,354
has close contacts with the
Silesian armaments industry

201
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,154
and has brought groundbreaking ideas
to the whole field of KL practice.

202
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:14,153
He is a model settler farmer
and an exemplary German pioneer of the East.

203
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,497
His particular strength
is turning theory into practice.

204
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,958
I will refrain from listing more qualities

205
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:23,330
which prove a change in his
command is not possible.

206
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,839
Therefore, could you please speak

207
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:30,427
to the Reichsführer as soon as possible
to prevent the transfer of Comrade Höss.

208
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:34,887
I would be very grateful for a brief reply.
Heil Hitler.

209
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,725
Gauleiter Fritz Bracht.

210
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,682
Can I do it now?
-In a moment.

211
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,944
Did you know that storks

212
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,438
fly as far as Africa?

213
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,408
How far do you think they fly?

214
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:55,073
How many kilometres?
-300?

215
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,616
More.

216
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,596
All these weeds here.

217
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,889
You are what you say.

218
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,387
You are what you say.

219
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:25,437
Cows find this funny. The whole farm
is roaring, because you are so boring.

220
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,684
Cows find this funny.

221
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,278
The whole farm is roaring,
because you are so boring.

222
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,988
No, you're boring.

223
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:23,665
Come out.

224
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:48,936
All is well.

225
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,602
I hate you.

226
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:55,072
Keep your eyes closed, or it'll hurt.
-I know.

227
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,568
Once more. All good. Come here.

228
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,019
We have to rinse your eyes.

229
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,937
Everything's fine. You'll live.

230
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,697
...with which 60,000 Italian spectators

231
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,541
showered their victorious national team.

232
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:51,120
We will be able to share in their delight.

233
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,922
How long it's been since Milan saw

234
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,132
their beloved Squadra Azzurra?

235
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:59,344
And now they have returned with a 4-0 victory

236
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,222
to the arena of their many triumphs.

237
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,764
Can you imagine the celebration?

238
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,683
4-0 against their old rivals Spain,

239
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,807
who are again aspiring to a position of power

240
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,559
in European football,

241
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,813
as we Germans saw with our own eyes

242
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,484
in Berlin last Sunday.

243
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,575
But don't let the result fool you.

244
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,198
4-0 was the final score.

245
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,787
But at half time

246
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:29,783
this thrilling Italian-Spanish encounter

247
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,159
stood at O-0.

248
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,786
Hang up.

249
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:38,751
Fritz.

250
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,795
Go on.

251
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,095
What does it say?

252
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:57,645
Well.

253
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,899
No, you wrote a very powerful
letter on my behalf.

254
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,026
Their minds were obviously made up.

255
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,320
I'd better tell my wife.

256
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:12,868
She might.

257
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,829
The train stopped for ages at Krakow.

258
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,955
How frustrating.

259
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,501
And it was so hot.

260
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:24,384
A lady fainted next to me, it was that hot.

261
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:29,305
She's moving here with her husband,
who's an engineer. He's a lot older.

262
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,388
Yes.
-They've both got jobs at a new factory.

263
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:35,141
Siemens.
-Ah, yes. That's possible.

264
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:40,817
All the big companies are here, he said.

265
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,235
Yes, yes.

266
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,535
Don't you need to get on?

267
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,028
Yes. I'd better.

268
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,996
I'll show Mum to the girls' room.

269
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,827
Are you ready?

270
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,875
You'll have Heidetraud's bed

271
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,793
and she'll get in with Inge-Brigitte.

272
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,213
You don't mind, do you?
-Of course not.

273
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,053
The house looks big, but it actually isn't.

274
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,763
The first thing we did

275
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,303
was install central heating.

276
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:13,395
It gets so cold in winter.

277
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:14,979
You wouldn't believe it.

278
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:30,988
Hand-painted.

279
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,580
Really?
-Yes.

280
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,131
This is Heidetraud's bed here.

281
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,092
This is lovely.

282
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,802
Truly.

283
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,889
Such a lovely room.

284
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:58,057
The top two drawers are for you.

285
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,309
Yes, that's more than enough.

286
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:02,899
Such beautiful flowers.

287
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,451
Yes, try it.

288
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,618
But I'm sleeping here?
-Yes, but they're both...

289
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,416
...the same.

290
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:28,504
My girl.

291
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:32,095
That's spinach strudel, apple strudel,
potato salad.

292
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,388
And your cinnamon rolls.

293
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,019
My recipe?

294
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,977
Very nice.

295
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,479
My god.

296
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,197
Subject:

297
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,409
Lilac bushes by the commandant's
guard barracks.

298
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:58,367
From now on, SS members who pick lilacs

299
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:06,004
in a thoughtless and blatant manner

300
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,419
so that the bushes bleed

301
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,430
will be punished.

302
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,509
I expect the SS members,

303
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:19,388
if they wish to take some,

304
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,599
to do it in a way

305
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,476
that does not damage the bushes.

306
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,903
In the interest of our whole community,

307
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,616
I hope you understand

308
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,569
that the lilac bushes

309
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,538
are intended to decorate our entire camp

310
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,785
both now and in the future.

311
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,622
Jews in the house?

312
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,009
The Jews are over the other side of the wall.

313
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,377
They're local girls.

314
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,511
Say hello to grandma.

315
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,471
Hello.

316
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,350
My God.

317
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:06,857
He's got so big, and you have such nice hair.

318
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,110
I think it's your turn to push,
isn't it Hans?

319
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,030
Inge pushed you before
and now it's your turn. Go on.

320
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,444
Let's go.

321
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,418
This is all us.

322
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:25,962
There's a grape vine.

323
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,374
Obviously, it'll grow.

324
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,677
It's huge.

325
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,222
I'm speechless.

326
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,816
It's all my design.

327
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:52,236
All the planting and everything.
The greenhouse, the gazebo at the end.

328
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,358
Is that a pool?
-Yes.

329
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,198
I have gardeners. I couldn't do it alone.

330
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,661
With a slide?
-Yes.

331
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,825
Oh Heddy.

332
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,033
Do you like it?

333
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,586
Of course I like it. How could I not?

334
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,925
This was a field three years ago.

335
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,377
No.

336
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:21,018
We just had the lower garden by the street.
And the house had a flat roof.

337
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,352
It's hard to believe.

338
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,979
And that's the camp wall?

339
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,647
Yes, that's the camp wall.

340
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,237
We planted more vines at the back

341
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,276
to grow and cover it.

342
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,988
Maybe Esther Silberman is over there.

343
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,578
Which one was she?
-The one I used to clean for.

344
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,580
She was the one who had the book readings.

345
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,409
God knows what they were up to.

346
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:46,873
Bolshevik stuff.

347
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,457
Jewish stuff.

348
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,750
And I got outbid on her curtains

349
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,047
at the street auction.

350
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:56,924
Her opposite, she got them.

351
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,264
I loved those curtains.

352
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,894
These flowers are so beautiful.

353
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,850
The azaleas there.

354
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,972
There are also vegetables.

355
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:13,862
A few herbs. Rosemary.
Beetroot. This is fennel.

356
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,156
Sunflowers.

357
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:24,953
And here is kohlrabi. The
children love to eat it.

358
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:29,787
Cabbage. Kale. Runner beans.

359
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,000
Pumpkins.

360
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,249
Potatoes and more.

361
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,726
We have bees over here to provide our honey.

362
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:46,803
It's a paradise garden.

363
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,098
And Rudolf is okay?

364
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,941
Yes, he's fine.

365
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,270
Working non-stop, even when he's home.

366
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,897
Which he loves.

367
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,613
He's a busy bee.

368
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,611
He is. Non-stop.

369
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:05,705
And under pressure like you wouldn't believe.

370
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,034
And you're okay?

371
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,538
Do I look okay?

372
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,303
Rudi calls me the Queen of Auschwitz.

373
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,480
Honestly.

374
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,275
To have all this.

375
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,328
You really have landed on your feet, my child.

376
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,375
The linden trees are turning yellow.

377
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:55,038
It smelled so nice when they were flowering.

378
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:01,629
This will grow and cover everything.

379
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,923
You'll see next time you visit.

380
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:10,770
No.

381
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,142
Stop it.

382
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:30,597
The heartfelt time we spent in the Höss house

383
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,684
will always be

384
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:39,434
among our most beautiful holiday memories.

385
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,937
In the East lies our tomorrow.

386
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:47,909
Thanks for your National Socialist hospitality.

387
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:53,740
And this was from... Willy... Billy...

388
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,614
Hans says you have his sandals.

389
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,411
We have to leave, Mutzi.

390
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,455
Leave where?

391
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,123
Here. We have to go. We're being transferred.

392
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,592
Sorry, what?
-We're being transferred.

393
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,672
To where?
-Oranienburg.

394
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,216
What?

395
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:38,766
They're swapping me for Arthur Liebehenschel.
He comes here.

396
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,898
I take over as Deputy Inspector.

397
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,779
If you've known this for a
while, why tell me now?

398
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,866
There was no good moment to say it.
-You've said it now.

399
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,872
Where are you going?
-To get the sandals.

400
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,247
When did you find out?
-Pohl told me last week.

401
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,965
I tried to make it go away.

402
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:15,181
Then call Bormann.

403
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,429
I've tried Bormann.

404
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,973
Should I go to Hitler now?
-Well, yes.

405
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:23,765
Rudolf.

406
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,734
Rudolf.

407
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,993
Don't turn your back on me.

408
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,121
Stop.

409
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,241
Calm down. Go back to the party.

410
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,291
You can't do this to me.

411
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:53,803
What is this? Marta.

412
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,595
Mrs Höss?
-What's this, "Mrs Höss? Mrs Höss?"

413
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,843
I'll show you Mrs Höss.
Mop it up.

414
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,472
Don't forget you live well in our house.
Bloody hell.

415
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,187
Now.

416
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,776
Bloody hell.

417
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,837
Why are they transferring you?

418
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,799
Structural changes.

419
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,221
What does that mean?

420
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,937
They weren't specific.
But I'm not the only one being moved.

421
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,476
There are lots of us.

422
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,027
When?
-Soon.

423
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,190
How soon?

424
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:36,189
I'm waiting to be told.

425
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:47,041
If it's about the investigation
they should call Himmler.

426
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,376
He encouraged us.
-No.

427
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,748
So it's not that?
-It's a political matter.

428
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,423
Then go to Hitler.
-Don't be ridiculous.

429
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:01,014
It's not ridiculous.
You're the one who carries out his orders

430
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,723
once you peel away the layers.

431
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:06,136
We have to face facts. We have to leave.

432
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,723
No.
-You have to leave.

433
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:14,686
Yes.

434
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,235
Your work is in Oranienburg now.

435
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:21,280
Mine is raising our children,

436
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,902
and I'll do that from here.

437
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:31,002
I never thought that you wouldn't be with me.

438
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,171
Never crossed my mind.

439
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,876
They'd have to drag me out of here.

440
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,511
You know that.

441
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,551
This is our home.

442
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,232
We're living how we dreamed we would.

443
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,398
Since we were 17. Beyond how we dreamed.

444
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,072
Out of the city finally.

445
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,817
Everything we want. On our doorstep.

446
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,158
And our children are strong,
healthy and happy.

447
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:12,703
Everything the Führer said
about how to live is how we do.

448
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,420
Go East. Living space.

449
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,959
This is our living space.

450
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,547
This is our living space.

451
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,562
I know you agree with me.

452
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:39,236
Arthur can find somewhere else to live.
He doesn't need to take our home.

453
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:42,483
You should make it a condition.
It's the least they can do.

454
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:48,280
He'll want a townhouse, anyway.

455
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:53,909
Rudolf?

456
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,005
I heard you.

457
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:00,833
So?

458
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,506
I'll ask.

459
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,016
You'll be working all the time.

460
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,142
Yes.

461
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:20,402
We'd never see you.

462
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,566
No.

463
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,996
I'll miss you, of course.

464
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,119
But you'll come home when you can.

465
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:45,586
I'll be...

466
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:49,925
with you. Just like you'll be with me.

467
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,484
Yes?

468
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:18,461
And after the war

469
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:22,631
when everything is over, we'll farm.

470
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,467
Like we said.

471
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,666
Do you all understand?

472
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:07,043
Yes.

473
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,096
So, I'll be missing your birthday.

474
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:20,018
And maybe even our anniversary.

475
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,521
Depending on how long I'll be gone.

476
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:28,106
So, those are some of the things
that definitely add to the struggle.

477
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,734
But the life we enjoy

478
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,033
is very much worth the sacrifice.

479
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:40,122
It's time for bed.

480
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:45,961
Hans, your plate.

481
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,341
Be calm.

482
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,162
It'll be hard for you too.

483
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,002
I know that.

484
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:54,047
Don't you think I know that?

485
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:55,381
I know that.

486
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,466
I love you.

487
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,226
I love you, my beauty.

488
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:23,322
Call Walter Dürrfeld first thing and
see if he can join us at selection.

489
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,582
Tell him they're Dutch

490
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,497
and he can have his pick.

491
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,837
Otherwise, I'll see him at the IG lunch.

492
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,092
Letter to Messrs. Prüfer and Sander,

493
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,255
Topf and Sons.

494
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:39,346
Subject: New Crematorium.

495
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:43,851
I'm glad you were able to
make the journey last week.

496
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:49,231
SS-Obersturmbannführer
Bischoff and I both agree

497
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,852
the ring crematorium is
definitely the answer.

498
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,150
What a difference it will make.

499
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,481
Bravo.

500
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,656
I welcome your...

501
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,204
I welcome your suggestion

502
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,620
that the design should be patented

503
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:09,084
in order to secure priority.

504
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,419
I will follow up with a letter of intent.

505
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,796
You should be aware,
I've been promoted to Deputy Inspector

506
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,761
of concentration camps at the IKL.

507
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:21,297
Come.

508
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:27,478
And therefore, future communications

509
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:29,688
will be from Oranienburg-Berlin.

510
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,693
The focus there is now on lab our.

511
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:42,322
Of course, this direction will affect our plans

512
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,123
and though it pains me to leave Auschwitz

513
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:53,170
I believe I'll be in a better position

514
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,506
to push for funds and materials

515
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:58,459
from there.

516
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,927
Heil Hitler. Et cetera.

517
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,914
Letter to Gruppenführer Glücks, IKL.

518
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:35,959
Subject: Transfer.

519
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:39,879
Dear Gruppenführer Glücks,

520
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:44,842
I would like my family to remain

521
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:48,388
at 88 Bielitzstrasse, KL Auschwitz

522
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,477
for the duration of my transfer.

523
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,514
It would be a great favour to me

524
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,391
for this to be permitted.

525
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,311
I must stress what a wonderful environment

526
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,782
Hedwig is making for the
children since settling here.

527
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:07,737
An inspiration in many ways

528
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:10,911
for our new German community in the East.

529
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,205
If this is acceptable,

530
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:18,672
provision of a simple lodging for myself
in Oranienburg will suffice.

531
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:22,760
I would be very grateful for a speedy answer.

532
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:24,128
Heil Hitler, et cetera.

533
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,141
Sweaty.

534
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,204
The little snow white bird flew down
and sang,

535
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,959
"Be warned, be warned."

536
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:33,592
Gretel understood what the witch had in mind

537
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,473
and said, "Please show me first,

538
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,642
I don't know how to do that."

539
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,651
The witch sat on the shovel

540
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,816
and Gretel pushed her into the oven,

541
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:50,157
as deep as she could.

542
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:57,573
Then she closed the iron door of the oven.

543
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,540
And secured it with a bar.

544
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:03,170
The witch got cooked alive

545
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:07,917
as a punishment for her horrible deeds.

546
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:11,382
Gretel ran straight to Hansel,

547
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:16,637
unlocked the goose cage and let him out.

548
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,265
He jumped out

549
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,604
and threw his arms around his sister's neck.

550
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:26,310
They kissed one another,
cried with joy, and thanked God.

551
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,154
The little white bird sang,

552
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:33,951
"Pearls and gems for bread crumbs."

553
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,001
[Polish] Here you are at last.

554
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:27,713
Don't forget to stand straight.

555
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,555
I've packed buttered bread for you all.

556
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:40,941
Come on children. Hurry.

557
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:58,034
Sophie.

558
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:11,841
Tell her it's getting cold.

559
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,011
She's not here.

560
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,426
What?

561
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:15,927
She's gone.

562
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:17,846
What, not upstairs?

563
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:19,139
No, she's gone.

564
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:20,731
And her case has gone.

565
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:23,101
That cannot be.

566
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:26,855
Mum?

567
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,742
Go and look for her.

568
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:39,890
Aniela.

569
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:41,646
Take it away.

570
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,600
Was that here to spite me?

571
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:49,729
No, Mrs. Höss.

572
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,911
I could have my husband spread your ashes

573
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,254
across the fields of Babice.

574
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:35,283
Relax, let her find it.

575
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,949
Are you not going to be a commandant anymore?

576
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:46,002
I'll be head of all commandants.

577
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:51,132
Inspecting their camps, seeing
where improvements can be made.

578
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:55,212
Their yield, that kind of thing.

579
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:01,180
It has a great name.

580
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:04,395
It's girl's eye, or tickseed.

581
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:07,811
Girl's eye?
-Girl's eye, yes.

582
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,480
I can only guess

583
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:13,150
that's because of its serrated petals,

584
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:17,116
because they resemble the long eyelashes

585
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:21,613
of women and girls.

586
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,014
You there.

587
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:12,398
Guard.

588
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:18,529
Bring him here.

589
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:26,613
What's he done?

590
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:29,582
Fighting over an apple, Commandant.

591
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:31,538
Drown him in the river.

592
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:33,787
Come.

593
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:48,301
Don't do that again.

594
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:54,273
Move it.

595
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,727
I don't care. Move it.

596
01:16:57,863 --> 01:16:59,024
Get it out.

597
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:10,664
Are you going to stand there trembling?

598
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:13,831
Something to say?

599
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:19,582
Come.

600
01:17:58,132 --> 01:18:00,464
Aren't you lovely?

601
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:02,800
Yes, you are lovely.

602
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:04,840
Male or female?
-Male.

603
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:06,838
How old?
-4 years old.

604
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:08,593
What's his name?
-Torin.

605
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,469
You don't see many with his colouring.

606
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,688
No, mostly black or salt and pepper.

607
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:20,185
I had a black one when I was little. EIsa.

608
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:21,652
Born on the same day I was.

609
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:23,692
He's lovely.
-Thank you.

610
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:25,481
Come on.

611
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:29,198
On Sunday at 19h there
will be a benefit concert

612
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:32,368
at the Marksmen's Club to raise
money for War Winter Relief.

613
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:36,705
Junior Squad Leader Johann Thißen will
conduct the orchestra in a two part program me

614
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,794

Förschner, Mittelbau-Dora.

630
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:14,822
Sauer, Riga-Kaiserwald.

631
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:21,420
The Führer has approved the deportation
of Hungary's 700,000 Jews for extermination

632
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:23,880
and war production where able-bodied.

633
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:28,465
An agreement was reached
with the new Hungarian government

634
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,929
to begin the operation immediately.

635
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:34,851
They are being amassed
for transportation to Auschwitz.

636
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:37,186
4 trains a day, 3,000 on each.

637
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:38,975
12,000 daily.

638
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:41,482
Firstly via the Eastern zones, 1 to 3.

639
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:44,234
Then via 4 and 5
in the middle of the country,

640
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:46,229
and finally, Budapest.

641
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:51,318
Pressburg and Vienna are heavily loaded
with military transports.

642
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,410
Jewish transports will pass through

643
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,530
Kassa and Muszyna instead.

644
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,208
Based on estimates provided
by Obersturmbannführer Höss,

645
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:02,419
25% will be retained for
lab our after selection.

646
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:04,334
20% of those will be utilized

647
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,457
in Auschwitz sub-camps,

648
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:08,300
and the other 80%

649
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:10,761
will come to your camps in due course.

650
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:14,633
The scale is many times larger than before.

651
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:16,429
So prepare yourselves.

652
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:19,387
Before I hand over to
Obersturmbannführer Höss,

653
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:22,811
I'd like to announce
the promotion of Colonel Maurer

654
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:24,900
to the rank of SS-Standartenführer

655
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:27,646
for consistently hitting his lab our targets.

656
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:28,771
Bravo.

657
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:34,118
I get fan mail from CEOs for this man.

658
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:36,370
More famous than me.
-Thank you, sir.

659
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:37,947
Well deserved.

660
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,996
As I've said before,
I'm grateful for your leadership.

661
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:43,745
Thank you. You have said that.
I appreciate that.

662
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,955
Thank you, Obergruppenführer Pohl.

663
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,957
Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning.

664
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:49,675
Two apologies for absence.

665
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:54,843
Sturmbannführer Förschner, Mittelbau-Dora.
Sturmbannführer Sauer, Riga-Kaiserwald.

666
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:56,803
You will appreciate

667
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:58,926
we have a very busy agenda today.

668
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,853
The Hungarian operation is urgent,

669
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,222
and complex,

670
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,521
and will involve converging challenges

671
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:07,984
at every operational level.

672
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:11,818
Please turn to the first page in your files.

673
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,738
You will see five headings.

674
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:17,445
Item one. Timings.

675
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:20,619
Item two.

For item four, prisoner workers.

678
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:27,956
<i>Dr.</i> Meindl from Ste yr-Daimler-Puch,

679
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,254
some of you know him, some of you don't,

680
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:32,255
is joining us today

681
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:35,221
to discuss pay rates and incentives.

682
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:36,881
Item five.

683
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:38,974
Fire and air defence measures.

684
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:44,198
The girls didn't want to go out.

685
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:45,324
Yes.

686
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:48,501
Because it is so cold.

687
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:51,793
Well, I love the snow.

688
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:06,603
Stop.

689
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:09,102
Leave me alone, Klaus.

690
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:21,615
Stop it, Klaus.

691
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,828
No.

692
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,212
Leave me alone, you traitor.

693
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:45,093
Saturday's funeral ceremony for the pupils

694
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:46,685
of the Air Force School

695
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,311
who died in the bombing raid

696
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,226
of March 6th will start at 11 :30.

697
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:53,017
SS pall bearers should congregate

698
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:56,646
in the forecourt of the T Building by 10:45.

699
01:23:57,366 --> 01:24:00,700
Transport will leave for Hans Schemm School
promptly at 11 am.

700
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:03,448
Commander of the Guard

701
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:06,530
Obersturmbannführer Gustav Wegner

702
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:09,367
will lead the cortège to the cemetery

703
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,832
with a delegation from the
League of German Girls

704
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:15,209
and Air Force Students.

705
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:22,922
Obersturmbannführer Höss.

706
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:27,017
Rudolf. Come on in.

707
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:28,761
How are you?

708
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:29,971
Good.

709
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:32,811
I've just received this.

710
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:36,527
Obergruppenführer Pohl met with
Reichsführer Himmler

711
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,896
to assess the numbers involved

712
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,741
and your name came up.

713
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,996
We're moving Liebehenschel to Majdanek.

714
01:24:56,675 --> 01:24:59,508
He's not energetic enough for this.
-Okay.

715
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:02,378
You'll receive operational orders
from Eichmann.

716
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:03,504
Perfect.

717
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,302
Tell me what resources you
need when you get there.

718
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:07,425
I will.

719
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:11,896
Any problems, come to me or Gerhard directly.

720
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:16,309
Thank you.

721
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,985
How's Hedwig?
-Good.

722
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:23,199
Pohl told me she sends the boss
flowers from your garden every week.

723
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:24,317
Yes.

724
01:25:25,579 --> 01:25:26,569
Get the job done.

725
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:28,112
I will. Thank you.

726
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:31,412
I appreciate the trust and confidence
you have in me.

727
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:43,336
And?

728
01:25:45,766 --> 01:25:46,927
I'm not sure yet.

729
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:49,341
Relax.

730
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:52,394
He won't put them all up the chimney.

731
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:56,148
You'll get your workers.

732
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:58,108
You'll see.

733
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:12,247
Are you sleeping okay?

734
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:13,366
Yes.

735
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:18,166
How many bowel movements
do you have per day?

736
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:19,583
Twice per day.

737
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:21,666
Urinating?

738
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:23,550
Without issues.

739
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:28,468
I'll feel around now. On the surface, first.

740
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:32,184
If there is any pain,
then please let me know.

741
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,024
This is Höss.

742
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:50,949
Long-distance priority call,
KL Auschwitz, Höss private residence.

743
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,154
I'll stay on the line.

744
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:08,587
Are you there?

745
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,427
Hello?
-Can you talk?

746
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:15,018
Is everything okay?
-Yes.

747
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:16,137
I have news.

748
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:17,809
I told you I'd heard rumblings

749
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:19,147
but nothing concrete.

750
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,475
What news?

751
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:22,692
The Hungary thing.

752
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:25,271
The old man gave me orders from Heinrich.

753
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:28,198
It's happening at last.
I'm coming back to run it.

754
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,533
Well, I'm very relieved about that.

755
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:37,074
I have to admit, I'm pleased as Punch.

756
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:40,870
Yes.

757
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:45,128
I don't know, I go to Budapest first.

758
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,594
Things will be clearer after that.
Anyway, my cogs are turning.

759
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:51,384
I must get on.
I'll call you later, after the party.

760
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:52,847
No. Wait, please.

761
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:54,466
Tell Eleanor Pohl,

762
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,593
when she receives her parcel,

763
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:58,061
to look in the compact.

764
01:27:58,190 --> 01:27:59,225
They're inside.

765
01:31:19,683 --> 01:31:22,220
I heard Himmler's calling it Operation Höss.

766
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,639
That's fantastic. I'm so happy for you.

767
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:25,970
Thank you, Mutzi.

768
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:27,187
It's your name too.

769
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:29,139
Who was there?

770
01:31:29,943 --> 01:31:31,183
To tell you the truth

771
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:33,526
I wasn't really paying attention.

772
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:37,523
I was too busy thinking
how I'd gas everyone in the room.

773
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:41,777
Very difficult, logistically,
because of its high ceiling.

774
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:46,331
It's the middle of the night

775
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:48,871
and I need to be in bed.

776
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:51,832
I shouldn't have called so late.

777
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:54,335
I was just excited to tell you the name.

778
01:31:55,135 --> 01:31:57,968
You can tell me about it when you get back.

779
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,977
You have told them Daddy's coming home?

780
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:10,605
Yes.

781
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:11,769
Goodnight.
