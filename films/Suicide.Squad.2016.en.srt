1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,629
- Chow time!
- It's time!

2
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,590
Floyd, step up to the door. Dinner time.

3
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,638
Only my friends call me Floyd.

4
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:54,931
You ain't got no friends, Floyd.

5
00:00:57,642 --> 00:00:58,643
What's that?

6
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,853
- That is called loaf.
- Loaf.

7
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,189
It's got a little bit of pasghetti
in there.

8
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:04,774
Toenails.

9
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,442
Rat shit.

10
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:08,653
Everything a growing fella needs,
like you.

11
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,365
Come here. Can I tell you something?
Can I tell you a secret?

12
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:13,574
Yeah.

13
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:15,076
One day,

14
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:17,912
somehow, some way,
I'm gonna get outta here.

15
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,416
And I'm gonna rain down on you
like the Holy Ghost.

16
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,045
Man, you just threatened a staff member.

17
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,839
- Yeah?
- <i>Yeah, you have.</i>

18
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,049
Do something.

19
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,051
Let's have some fun.

20
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,665
Open the goddamn gate!

21
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:04,875
Come on, guys.
Don't waste my time.

22
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:08,879
Sector C! Pull your heads outta your ass!
Boss is on deck!

23
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:12,550
<i>Open!</i>

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,884
<i>Bravo 14, open perimeter fence.</i>

25
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,219
<i>Stay back!</i>

26
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,888
If she moves, fire her up, all right?

27
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,559
You gonna come down from there or what?

28
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,771
<i>Look at you.</i>

29
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,109
You know the rules, hotness.

30
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,652
You gotta keep off these bars.

31
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,696
- What, these bars?
- Yeah. Those bars.

32
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:36,407
Oh, my God.

33
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,953
You are really
in bad shape upstairs, lady!

34
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:42,955
Gonna come in here and tell me that?

35
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:45,374
Or are you too scared?

36
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,418
Come on, I'm bored.

37
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,253
I'm bored. Play with me.

38
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,589
<i>You put five of my guards
in the hospital, honey.</i>

39
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:53,507
<i>No one's gonna play with you.</i>

40
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,092
You sleep on the ground.

41
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:59,555
I sleep where I want,
when I want, with who I want.

42
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,600
Oh, man. I love you.

43
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,769
Alpha One, hit her.

44
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,274
Come on, man. You're
six foot four. She's a tiny little girl.

45
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:13,027
You got a choice tonight.
What we got here?

46
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,821
We got chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla.

47
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:19,325
My job is to keep you alive until you die.
Do you understand that?

48
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:20,493
Ahh!

49
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:21,786
Spring break!

50
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:26,957
<i>Whoo.</i>

51
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,087
That is just a whole lot of pretty
in a whole lot of crazy.

52
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,777
<i>The world changed
when Superman flew across the sky.</i>

53
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,531
<i>And then it changed again when he didn't.</i>

54
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,335
<i>And that is why I'm here.</i>

55
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,567
We lose a national hero,

56
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,652
but you sit there looking like
the cat that ate the canary.

57
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:38,863
I've eaten a lot of canaries.

58
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:40,739
<i>It's taken some work.</i>

59
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,910
But I finally have them.
The worst of the worst.

60
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,875
There's rumors, Amanda,
that some of them have abilities.

61
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,419
Well, the rumors are right.

62
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:56,046
You know what the problem
with a met a human is?

63
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,298
The human part.

64
00:04:57,465 --> 00:05:00,676
We got lucky with Superman.
He shared our values.

65
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,052
The next Superman might not.

66
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,846
You're playing with fire, Amanda.

67
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:06,056
I'm fighting fire with fire.

68
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,266
<i>You're not going to pitch us that</i>

69
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:10,394
Task Force X project
of yours again, are you?

70
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,562
Yes.

71
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,230
But this time, you're gonna listen.

72
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,277
<i>Floyd Lawton, aka Deadshot.</i>

73
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,962
<i>He's the most wanted hitman in the world.</i>

74
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,136
<i>Let's say he has an elite clientele.</i>

75
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,598
- <i>What?</i>
- Hey, Angelo.

76
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:50,893
This is the exterminator
you called for your rat problem.

77
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,728
My account's looking a little thin.

78
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,607
<i>No one gets paid until
what needs to get done gets done.</i>

79
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,776
Nope. That's not the rules.
No money, no honey.

80
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,154
<i>Whoa. Here's your boy right now.</i>

81
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,908
<i>With about 20 of his new best friends.</i>

82
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,540
I'm still seeing zeroes over here, Angie.

83
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,042
<i>Listen, stop being cute and do your job!</i>

84
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,753
<i>They're taking him
outta the car now.</i>

85
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,965
In about 30 seconds,
your window is gonna close forever.

86
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,051
<i>Okay. Okay, okay. Relax.
There was an accounting error.</i>

87
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,804
<i>We sent it.</i>

88
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:29,557
Now double it for being a dickhead.
You got 10 seconds.

89
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,559
<i>We're not the kind of people
you play with.</i>

90
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,519
Did you just... Did you threaten me?

91
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:36,480
This dude's gonna get a sore throat
from all the singing he's about to do.

92
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:37,815
<i>You son of a bitch.</i>

93
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,111
Pleasure doing business with you, Angie.

94
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:03,924
But everyone has a weakness.
And a weakness can be leveraged.

95
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,094
His is an 11 -year-old honor student
in Gotham City.

96
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,262
His daughter.

97
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,140
<i>So we watched her and waited.</i>

98
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:12,933
You should talk to Mama more.

99
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,852
Yeah, yeah, I know.

100
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,812
Mama stays in bed a lot.

101
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,106
Yeah. She's still going out at night?

102
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:22,526
Dad, it's okay. I can take care of her.

103
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,487
I know how to make pancakes now.

104
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,531
Hey, babe, that's beautiful.

105
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,533
Um, she's supposed to be
taking care of you.

106
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:31,243
You know, that's how
that's supposed to work.

107
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,539
I want you to come live with me.

108
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:40,127
All right? I came into some resources.
I'mma get us a spot.

109
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,046
It's gonna be nice, all right?

110
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,466
Mama says I can't live with you
because you kill people.

111
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,053
That's not true.
That's a lie. She's lying to you.

112
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,264
Daddy... I know you do bad things.

113
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:55,267
Don't worry, I still love you.

114
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,563
Come on.

115
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,775
- And you caught him?
- Not me.

116
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:06,070
<i>I just gave an anonymous tip
to the right guy in Gotham City.</i>

117
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,365
I'mma figure this out. All right?

118
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,329
<i>It's over, Deadshot.</i>

119
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,248
<i>I don't want to do this
in front of your daughter.</i>

120
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,968
- Daddy, please.
- Zoe, move!

121
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,763
Please, Daddy. Don't do it.

122
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,100
<i>Please.</i>

123
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,435
Don't do it.

124
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:50,948
All right.

125
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:00,499
Love you, Daddy.

126
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,794
So now we have the man who never misses.

127
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:04,962
Where'd you put him?

128
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:07,464
Let's just say, I put him in a hole
and threw away the hole.

129
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,051
<i>Harley Quinn.</i>

130
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:21,562
<i>Before she ran off
and joined the circus,</i>

131
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:24,148
<i>she was known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel.</i>

132
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,608
<i>A psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum.</i>

133
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,654
<i>She was assigned to The Clown himself.</i>

134
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,740
<i>Dr. Quinzel.</i>

135
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,117
<i>You know,
I live for these moments with you.</i>

136
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,662
- What do you got?
- I got you a kitty.

137
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,165
<i>So thoughtful.</i>

138
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,585
<i>She thought she was curing him,
but she was falling in love.</i>

139
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,298
There is something
you could do for me, doctor.

140
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:50,466
Anything. I mean, yeah.

141
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,886
I need a machine gun.

142
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,181
A machine gun?

143
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:02,060
Talk about a workplace romance gone wrong.

144
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,615
Get off me.

145
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,533
Shh!

146
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,913
What do we have here?

147
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,833
I did everything you said. I helped you.

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,001
Ah.

149
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,378
You helped me.

150
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,006
By erasing my mind?

151
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,760
What few faded memories I had.

152
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:36,887
No.

153
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:41,558
You left me in a black hole
of rage and confusion.

154
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:45,103
Is that the medicine
you practice, Dr. Quinzel?

155
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,231
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me, Mr. J?

156
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,732
What?

157
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,903
Oh, I'm not gonna kill ya.

158
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,656
I'm just gonna hurt ya

159
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:59,993
really, really bad.

160
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,161
<i>You think so?</i>

161
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,747
Well, I can take it.

162
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:08,627
I wouldn't want you to break
those perfect porcelain-capped teeth

163
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,630
when the juice hits your brain.

164
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,723
<i>They became the king
and queen of Gotham City.</i>

165
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,893
And God help anyone
who disrespected the queen.

166
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,020
We finally meet.

167
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,313
<i>Nah, he don't shake hands.</i>

168
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,941
But sit down and have a drink.

169
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:35,863
Hey, J.

170
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,408
<i>On behalf of everybody, welcome back.</i>

171
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:42,119
<i>I wanted to come by
and personally say thank you.</i>

172
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:44,872
You making me good money.
I'm making you good money.

173
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,624
Are you sweet talking me?

174
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,546
<i>I love this guy.</i>

175
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:55,465
He's so intense!

176
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,638
<i>Mmm. You're a lucky man.</i>

177
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,850
You got a bad bitch.

178
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,979
Oh, that she is.

179
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,524
The fire in my loins.

180
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,153
The itch in my crotch.

181
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,199
The one, the only,
the infamous Harley Quinn!

182
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,128
<i>Oh, come to Daddy.</i>

183
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,465
Puddin'!

184
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,300
<i>Listen,</i>

185
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:42,638
you are my gift
to this handsome hunka hunka!

186
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,349
You belong to him now.

187
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,850
Well...

188
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,313
You're cute.

189
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,065
You want me?

190
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,859
I'm all yours.

191
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,447
I don't want no beef.

192
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,033
You don't want no beef?
You don't want no beef?

193
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,285
<i>Why, what's wrong?
You don't like me?</i>

194
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,120
Fine. Don't waste my time then.

195
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,538
This is your lady.

196
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,875
Look, are you enjoying yourself?

197
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:14,544
No.

198
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,421
That's your lady, Joker.

199
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,589
That's right.

200
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:18,882
Yo, <i>J.</i>

201
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,054
<i>And that was just the beginning.</i>

202
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,731
Come on, Puddin'. Do it!

203
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:36,858
Oh.

204
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,361
We have got company.

205
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,697
Batsy, Batsy, Batsy.

206
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,951
<i>She's crazier than him.</i>

207
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:47,911
<i>And more fearless.</i>

208
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,415
Stupid Bat, you're ruining date night!

209
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,210
Puddin'.

210
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,589
Puddin', I can't swim!

211
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:29,589
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

212
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,089
<i>But the Bat got her, too.
She's in the same hole as Deadshot.</i>

213
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,980
And then there's the Aussie.

214
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,149
Digger Harkness.

215
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,152
Or as the tabloids call him,
Captain Boomerang.

216
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,330
We're gonna be rich.

217
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,790
Yeah, you and me, mate.

218
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,374
Go and get the car.

219
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,794
<i>He robbed every bank
in Australia at least once.</i>

220
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,089
<i>Then he came to America
for a fresh target set.</i>

221
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,051
<i>Doesn't work well with others.</i>

222
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,808
No honor among thieves, eh?

223
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,854
But he tangled with a met a human
and lived to tell about it.

224
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:41,733
<i>And have you heard of
the pyrokinetic homeboy?</i>

225
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,947
<i>How'd you catch him?</i>

226
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,698
<i>We didn't. He surrendered.</i>

227
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:54,246
Chato Santana.
On the streets they call him El Diablo.

228
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,915
<i>This LA gangbanger thought
he was king of the world...</i>

229
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,543
<i>...until he lost his queen.</i>

230
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:05,799
Gets jumped in a prison riot
and incinerates half the yard.

231
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,093
The security video is incredible.

232
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,724
Oh, Jesus. The hell is that?

233
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,518
His name is Waylon Jones.

234
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,813
<i>Evolution took a step
backwards with this one.</i>

235
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,152
Yo, K.C., it's supper.

236
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,987
Go ahead, open that up, B.

237
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,159
Got something
real nice for you today, boy.

238
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,036
Hey, boss,
it true he chewed a dude's hand off?

239
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,624
Look at that, right there.
Vulcanized rubber.

240
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,256
Give me that, Smitty.

241
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,550
Where you at?

242
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,093
Don't make me get you.

243
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,429
<i>They call him Killer Croc.</i>

244
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,018
<i>Here you are! You hungry?</i>

245
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:01,271
You want some food?
Go ahead, feed the man.

246
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,565
<i>What are you in the mood for tonight?</i>

247
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:08,403
<i>I got a double cheeseburger,
onion rings, a little coleslaw.</i>

248
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,198
<i>Or a giant skinless goat.</i>

249
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,209
<i>He looked like a monster.</i>

250
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,253
<i>So they treated him like a monster.</i>

251
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,341
<i>Then he became a monster.</i>

252
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,555
He was chased out of Gotham by the Bat.

253
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,308
Went searching for sanctuary elsewhere.

254
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,893
He never found it.

255
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,320
I saved the best for last.

256
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,614
- The witch.
- A witch?

257
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:56,034
I'm talking a flying, spell-casting,
making-shit-disappear witch.

258
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:59,037
A sorceress from another dimension.
Another world.

259
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,833
<i>Archeologist Dr. June Moone,</i>

260
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,087
<i>wandered into the wrong cave.</i>

261
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,639
<i>June...</i>

262
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,519
<i>She opened something she shouldn't have...</i>

263
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:37,659
<i>...releasing a met a human more powerful
than any we've encountered.</i>

264
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,078
<i>The Enchantress.</i>

265
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,086
<i>She inhabits Dr. Moone's body now.</i>

266
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,879
And where is this witch?

267
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,923
In my pocket.

268
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,259
Now tell him
why she won't turn you into a frog.

269
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:57,262
Some say the witch
has a secret buried heart,

270
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,931
<i>and whoever finds it
can control the witch.</i>

271
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,725
<i>So we searched the cave
where she turned up</i>

272
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,518
<i>and we found her heart.</i>

273
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,481
That thing's her heart?

274
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,734
Mmm-hmm. She's vulnerable without it.

275
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,486
You want to put our national security
in the hands of

276
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,823
<i>witches, gangbangers, and crocodiles?</i>

277
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,283
Don't forget about The Joker's girlfriend.

278
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,576
<i>These are villains, Amanda.</i>

279
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,661
What makes you think you can control them?

280
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,789
Because getting people to act
against their own self-interest

281
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,083
for the national security
of the United States

282
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,918
is what I do for a living.

283
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,922
You take the finest special forces officer
this nation has ever produced,

284
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,215
<i>Colonel Rick Flag.</i>

285
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,449
Help me.

286
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,284
<i>I assigned him to watch Dr. Moone,</i>

287
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,245
<i>and just as I hoped, it got personal.</i>

288
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,539
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

289
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,291
<i>I have the witch's heart.</i>

290
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,293
<i>And Dr. Moone has his.</i>

291
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,714
Now he'll follow my orders as Holy Writ.

292
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,594
In a world of flying men and monsters,

293
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,806
this is the only way
to protect our country.

294
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:30,021
What if Superman had decided to fly down,

295
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,981
rip off the roof of the White House

296
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,817
and grab the President
of the United States

297
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,151
right out of the Oval Office?

298
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,445
Who would've stopped him?

299
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,616
We got contingency plans
for nukes in North Korea,

300
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,035
<i>anthrax in our mail.
We got fluoride in our water.</i>

301
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:48,873
But what happens if the next Superman
becomes a terrorist?

302
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,127
Amanda Waller has a plan. Amanda?

303
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,587
I wanna build a team
of some very bad people

304
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,381
who I think can do some good.

305
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,050
Like fight the next war,
defeat the next Superman.

306
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:00,677
Not on my watch.

307
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:04,264
You're not putting those monsters
back out on the street in our name.

308
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,724
General, we run them
covertly, non-attributed.

309
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,351
Strictly need to know.

310
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,687
And if they get caught,
we throw them under the bus.

311
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,440
The next war will be fought
with these met a humans.

312
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,608
Ours, or theirs.

313
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,153
We're not the only ones
kicking up rocks looking for them.

314
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,405
You know we can't control these people.

315
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,662
June, be strong.

316
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,039
Dr. Moone.

317
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,649
Enchantress.

318
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,124
<i>Meet the Enchantress.</i>

319
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,419
<i>Everything we know about her
is in your briefing packs.</i>

320
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,339
She's walked this earth
for a very long time

321
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,758
<i>and will likely be here
when we're long gone.</i>

322
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:24,469
This meeting is now a magic show?

323
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:27,639
Magic or not, this girl can do
some pretty incredible things.

324
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,809
Go get it, girl.

325
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:51,454
How about a little something
from the weapons ministry vault in Tehran?

326
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:03,591
We've been chasing these plans for years.

327
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,012
Uh, please don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

328
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,139
Thank you. We'd like Dr. Moone back.

329
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,858
Enchantress.

330
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,487
<i>Please. Please.</i>

331
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,864
I'm sorry, I can't do that again.

332
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,616
Flag, get her out of here.

333
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:36,332
I move to, uh, authorize Amanda Waller
to establish Task Force X

334
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,042
under the ARGUS program.

335
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,671
<i>All right.</i>

336
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,881
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

337
00:23:58,396 --> 00:23:59,856
<i>I know you do bad things.</i>

338
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,526
<i>Don't worry, I still love you.</i>

339
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,374
Welcome to Belle Reve,
special security barracks.

340
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,876
How you doing, man?

341
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,753
Why don't you kiss her ass?
She's in charge.

342
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,588
<i>Welcome, ma'am. How are you?</i>

343
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,715
<i>I'm here to assist you in any way.</i>

344
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,717
Where are they?

345
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,153
Are you the Devil?

346
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:50,907
Maybe.

347
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,814
Ain't you scared?

348
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:30,071
Why'd they put you down here?

349
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,533
I asked.

350
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:39,122
<i>Open that gate.</i>

351
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,004
Yo, <i>ese.</i>

352
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,756
<i>Hola, amigo.</i>

353
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:52,135
Put that burrito down.
You got visitors, man.

354
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,232
<i>What's up? Hey, you want some of this?</i>

355
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:07,400
<i>Then come down here.</i>

356
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,111
That ain't me.

357
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,279
That wasn't you?

358
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:14,657
Nah, they say it's me, but that ain't me.
That guy's gone.

359
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:15,992
He's dead.

360
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,119
- And yet, here you are.
- Ma'am.

361
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:19,662
<i>Let me try to talk to him.</i>

362
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,669
<i>You wanna die in here, buddy?</i>

363
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,213
You got a real shot
at walking the block again.

364
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,175
<i>Have a nice cold beer, a nice meal.</i>

365
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:33,843
A woman.

366
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,722
Look, man, you ain't the first to ask,
and you ain't gonna be the last.

367
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:39,348
Ask what?

368
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,518
I'm a man, okay? I ain't no weapon.

369
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:46,189
I'mma die in peace
before I raise my fists again.

370
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,484
<i>I've caused enough harm.</i>

371
00:26:58,951 --> 00:26:59,952
<i>All right, unlock him.</i>

372
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,330
- What?
- You heard me.

373
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:03,706
You know what this man can do?

374
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:07,043
I'm here to find out. Lose the restraints.

375
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:13,382
Okay.

376
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:17,345
What is this? Uh, cheerleading tryouts?

377
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,889
Let's go. Let's see what you can do.

378
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,725
They say you never missed a shot.
Prove it.

379
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,571
Mmm-hmm.

380
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:39,742
Now you got one in the chamber.
What you gonna do with it?

381
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,536
Shit!

382
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,080
Give me the word, boss. I'll drop him.

383
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:45,456
Everybody calm down.

384
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,083
Griggs, tell your men to stand down.

385
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,417
Tell them, "Put it down."

386
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,585
Stand down.

387
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:52,547
Colonel, for the record, this is exactly
what I was concerned about.

388
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:53,756
What's for dinner?

389
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,258
<i>Ames, if this man shoots me,</i>

390
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,260
I want you to kill him

391
00:27:57,969 --> 00:27:59,846
and I want you to go clear
my browser history.

392
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,934
See, uh,
the firing pin is filed down, right?

393
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,563
Mag full of dummy rounds.
If I pull the trigger, nothing happens.

394
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,356
You're absolutely right.

395
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,234
Why would we give a loaded weapon
to an infamous hitman?

396
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,903
Go ahead, pull the trigger. Empty it.

397
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,447
Don't empty nothing.
You don't even know this lady.

398
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,366
<i>I've known you, like, nine months.</i>

399
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,702
Remember when I brought you that cookie?
That was a real cookie.

400
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,373
What?

401
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,166
Oops.

402
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,379
Y'all jokers must be crazy.

403
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:25,264
All right. Now you know
what you're buying.

404
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:28,684
Let me tell you the price.
First, I want out of here.

405
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,938
Second, I want full custody
of my daughter.

406
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,024
All right? And her mom can have, like,
supervised visits.

407
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:38,444
But her stank-ass boyfriend can't come.
Darnell can't come.

408
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,196
- Darnell's out.
- He's out.

409
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:43,199
Third, y'all gonna pay
for my daughter's whole education.

410
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:46,035
Best schools.
And then I want her to go to college.

411
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,703
Like Harvard. Or Yale.

412
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,664
- So Ivy League.
- Ivy League, yeah.

413
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,290
- One of them big joints, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

414
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:54,377
And, uh, if she can't cut it
and her grades start slipping,

415
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,003
I need you to white-people that thing.

416
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,171
- Mmm-hmm.
- You know how y'all do.

417
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,714
- Oh, yeah.
- You know, right? Okay.

418
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,174
Now that's my price.

419
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:03,511
But I'm concerned 'cause I don't see
nobody writing shit down.

420
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:06,055
You're in no position to make any demands.

421
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,058
Oh. I'm sorry.
You thought I was talking to you.

422
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,812
No, errand boy. I'm talking to your boss.

423
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:18,192
That's my price, sweetie.
You know what it is.

424
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,573
You notice these are criminals, hmm?

425
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,077
They're psychotic, antisocial freaks.
It makes no sense.

426
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:30,121
<i>Let me hit the Tier One units
and I'll build you</i>

427
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,039
a team of pipe hitters who'll
do anything you can dream up.

428
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:34,375
I mean, you need real soldiers.
Not these scumbags.

429
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:37,086
In World War Two,
the US Navy made a deal with the mafia

430
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,879
to protect its ships on the waterfront.

431
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,464
This ain't World War Two.

432
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:41,966
It's World War Three.

433
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,051
What are you really up to?

434
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:46,887
It's a "need to know", and all you need
to know is you work for me.

435
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:50,349
That can change with a phone call.
I have friends, too, you know.

436
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:54,311
There you go. Call.

437
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:55,980
But without you minding her,

438
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:59,984
your lady friend stays here strapped
to a board in a drug-induced coma.

439
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:03,112
They warned me about you.

440
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,074
My dumb ass didn't believe the stories.

441
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,165
Nobody does.

442
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,426
Where is she?

443
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:28,637
It's complex. This is not just her.

444
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,639
Everybody's disappearing.

445
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:31,807
<i>There's this new law,</i>

446
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:34,935
<i>where if you're a bad enough bad guy,
they stamp "terrorist" on your jacket.</i>

447
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,981
<i>They send you to this swamp in Louisiana.
A black site.</i>

448
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,150
That's where she is.

449
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,236
<i>So what are we doing?</i>

450
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:46,947
Bring the car around.

451
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,784
We're going for a drive.

452
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,431
Lester, Lester!
Hit me one more time!

453
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,350
Come on, man!

454
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:17,061
You gotta call upstairs and tell them
to float me another 10K.

455
00:32:17,812 --> 00:32:18,813
- Hey!
- Ow!

456
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,357
- Boss wants to see you.
- You know who I am?

457
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,697
Good job, man. He's killing it.

458
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,116
Come on, man. Why am I here?

459
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,243
All right, yeah, I'm down.
I get it, all right?

460
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:36,539
I've had a run of bad decks.
Not my fault. All right?

461
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,249
Dude, this is real.

462
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,418
I had to stop these guys from burning
down your house with your kids in it.

463
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,134
But you're lucky.

464
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,261
<i>Maybe. Why do you think so?</i>

465
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,016
<i>Yo, slick. What's up?</i>

466
00:32:57,393 --> 00:32:59,228
Griggs. You are?

467
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:00,896
You might wanna keep your mouth shut.

468
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,774
Can I go, man?
What the hell is going on, man?

469
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,276
This is crazy.

470
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,027
Blah, blah-blah, blah-blah.

471
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,321
Blah-blah, blah, blah.

472
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:13,492
All of that chitchat's gonna get ya hurt.

473
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:14,910
Oh! My God!

474
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:22,918
Mmm.

475
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:37,099
I could tell you meant that.

476
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:40,144
Yeah.

477
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,439
You're gonna be my friend.

478
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:02,458
Enchantress.

479
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,305
- Log time of death. 1620.
- June?

480
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,059
Let's get her down to the morgue.

481
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:22,019
June? June?

482
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:24,313
June.

483
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:26,732
June.

484
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,070
What did you do?

485
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:32,905
Shh.

486
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,074
Okay.

487
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:14,321
Plus, it could be the routing number.

488
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,366
Wanna go for drinks?

489
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,924
<i>Enchantress.</i>

490
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,970
God damn it!

491
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:23,307
June! June!

492
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:27,436
June, I'm sorry.

493
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:33,525
Shh.

494
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,907
She went somewhere.

495
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:45,788
If you have to choose between her or me,
stop her.

496
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,998
Promise me you'll stop her.

497
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:53,462
Even if it kills me.

498
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:22,699
Sir. Sir. You okay?

499
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:25,661
<i>Can you breathe? Did you take anything?</i>

500
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:29,373
This is 21.
Send medical to my location.

501
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,542
I'm a physician.

502
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,460
<i>Roger. Bringing medical to your location.</i>

503
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,921
No pulse. Starting compressions.

504
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,700
Sir.

505
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:07,536
Midway City is under attack.
It's a non-human entity.

506
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:09,037
I think you know what to do, sir.

507
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,081
Activate Task Force X

508
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:13,792
and get Amanda Waller
and her whole circus on scene ASAP.

509
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,002
Sir.

510
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,922
We're going live
with Task Force X. Pull 'em.

511
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,597
Prisoner,
get down on your knees, now!

512
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,015
Down on your knees!
Hands in the air! Turn around.

513
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:29,224
Hands up high!

514
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:30,893
Hey, I'm cooperating. All right?

515
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,936
- This is me being cool.
- Take her.

516
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,065
Do not fire
that goddamn weapon!

517
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:39,818
Damn it!

518
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:43,363
Open the gate!

519
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,115
Everybody, line up for extraction.

520
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:46,909
Let's go! Let's move, move.

521
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:49,786
Yeah. Open the door! Let's go!

522
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:57,544
Hit him!

523
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,087
<i>Hurry up, before he smokes us!</i>

524
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:01,840
Where you at?

525
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:03,425
Whoa!

526
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:09,765
Is that the new guy?

527
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:17,689
What is that? What is that? Who are you?

528
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,358
- Stand by. Arming device.
<i>- Who are you?</i>

529
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:20,901
- <i>I don't know who you are.</i>
- Device armed.

530
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,820
Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey, I'm talking to you.

531
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:26,031
injection successful.

532
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,158
<i>Location verified.</i>

533
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:32,621
- Anybody who touches me is dead.
- Anybody who--

534
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:35,624
- Lady. Hey.
- Injection successful.

535
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:38,210
- Hey! Miss? What was that?
- Location verified.

536
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:39,378
Next!

537
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:41,922
Oh, you deaf. You one of them deaf hoes.

538
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:44,633
Come on.

539
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,177
<i>Shut up, and get it done.</i>

540
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:50,556
Whee!

541
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:53,350
Listen, you're being transferred.
I don't know where you're going.

542
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,560
It's from Mr. J.

543
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,894
You gonna tell him I took care of you?

544
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,272
You're so screwed.

545
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,649
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?

546
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:03,151
Get off me! Get off me!
Harley, what do you mean by that?

547
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:05,612
<i>Harley!</i>

548
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,621
Hey, I got a delivery.
I have a gift basket for Dr. Van Cries.

549
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:17,499
You're not on the access list.
I can't let you in. Sorry.

550
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:20,586
Hey, cool if I leave it with you?
I'm way behind today.

551
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,338
Thank you. You're a good man.

552
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,352
Open up!

553
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:48,030
<i>Just please, do whatever they say.</i>

554
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:49,990
<i>Do whatever they say. Just do it.</i>

555
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:00,834
Hmm.

556
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:02,919
This looks neat.

557
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,762
Light it up!
Light it up! Light it up!

558
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:22,856
He's right above us.

559
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:24,816
This is a mistake. Rick, I can't do this.

560
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,401
- I can't--
- Listen, listen.

561
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,028
There's no other way.

562
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:30,280
Just get it done.

563
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,909
Just get it done.

564
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,455
Enchantress.

565
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:41,041
Flag, talk to me.
What's going on down there?

566
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,960
<i>Amanda, she bolted.</i>

567
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,462
Say it again?

568
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:47,172
<i>She bolted!</i>

569
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:48,924
Shit!

570
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:51,486
Go!

571
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,750
Worldwide military is on alert.
Our weapons are ineffective.

572
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,835
I thought this was contained!

573
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,019
This is the worst day of my life!

574
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,815
<i>All evacuees
must report to a FEMA representative.</i>

575
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,527
<i>What's going on in that city?</i>

576
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:34,738
Those assholes here yet?

577
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,281
Yeah, they're here.

578
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,535
Alpha, Bravo team, on me.

579
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,499
What the hell, Flag?

580
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:49,211
Unlock 'em.

581
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:56,676
Mmm!

582
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,554
Hi, boys! Harley Quinn.

583
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,181
<i>How do you do?</i>

584
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:08,355
Huh?

585
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:12,025
What was that?
I should kill everyone and escape?

586
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,446
Sorry. It's the voices.

587
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:20,075
I'm kidding! Jeez!

588
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:22,869
That's not what they really said.

589
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:24,579
What do we got here?

590
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:27,123
Twelve pounds of shit in a 10-pound sack.

591
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,257
Welcome to the party,
Captain Boomerang.

592
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:41,471
Hey, what's going on, man?

593
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:42,639
Calm down.

594
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:44,933
Hey, one minute
I'm playing Mahjong with me Nanna,

595
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,352
then this red streak hits me
outta nowhere.

596
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,063
Shut up! You were caught
robbing a diamond exchange.

597
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,439
I was not!

598
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,279
<i>Here comes Slipknot,
the man who can climb anything. Wonderful.</i>

599
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,114
Have a good time, scumbag.

600
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:00,782
Ooh.

601
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:02,701
Straighten up.

602
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,288
She had a mouth.

603
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,623
Listen up!

604
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,792
In your necks,

605
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:15,005
injection you got,
it's a nanite explosive.

606
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:19,134
It's the size of a rice grain,
but it's powerful as a hand grenade.

607
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:21,761
You disobey me, you die.

608
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,974
You try to escape, you die.

609
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:30,645
You otherwise irritate or vex me,
and guess what?

610
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,564
You die.

611
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:35,609
I'm known to be quite vexing.
I'm just forewarning you.

612
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:36,818
Lady, shut up!

613
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,195
This is the deal.

614
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:44,659
You're going somewhere very bad,
to do something that'll get you killed.

615
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,328
But until that happens,

616
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:48,747
you're my problem.

617
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:49,956
Mmm.

618
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,918
So was that like a, uh, pep talk?

619
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,336
Yeah. That was a pep talk.

620
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:55,712
There's your shit.

621
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:58,882
Grab what you need for a fight.
We're wheels up in 10.

622
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:01,134
You might wanna work on
your team motivation thing.

623
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:02,928
- You heard of Phil Jackson?
- Yeah.

624
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,180
He's like the gold standard, okay?

625
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:08,016
Triangle, bitch. Study.

626
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:11,871
What?

627
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:19,629
Won't fit anymore?

628
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:23,091
<i>Too much junk in the trunk?</i>

629
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:27,095
Nah. Every time I put this on,
somebody dies.

630
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:29,222
And?

631
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:31,933
I like putting it on.

632
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:33,893
Goody.

633
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,272
Somethin' tells me
a whole lotta people are about to die!

634
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:38,857
<i>Yeah. It's us.</i>

635
00:47:39,024 --> 00:47:40,108
We're being led to our deaths.

636
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:41,568
<i>Speak for yourself, mate.</i>

637
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:44,237
Hey, what's that crap on your face?
Does it wash off?

638
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:48,783
Hey, if you like a girl, can you light
her cigarette with your pinkie?

639
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,577
Because that would be real classy!

640
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:53,288
Hey, y'all might
wanna leave old boy alone.

641
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:56,708
He could torch this whole joint.
Ain't that right, <i>ese?</i>

642
00:47:56,875 --> 00:48:00,962
Ain't got nothing to worry about from me.
I'm cool, homie.

643
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:02,964
Behold the voice of God.

644
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:07,802
<i>For those of you
who don't know me officially,</i>

645
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:09,637
<i>my name is Amanda Waller.</i>

646
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:13,933
There's an active terrorist event
in Midway City.

647
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:18,438
I want you to enter the city,
rescue HVT-1, and get them to safety.

648
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:20,815
I'm sorry. Uh...

649
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:24,611
For those of us who don't
speak good guy, what is HVT-1 ?

650
00:48:24,778 --> 00:48:26,654
The only person
that matters in the city,

651
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:28,490
the one person you can't kill.

652
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:32,368
Complete the mission,
you get time off your prison sentence.

653
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:34,287
Fail the mission, you die.

654
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:37,999
<i>Anything happens to Colonel Flag,
I'll kill every single one of you.</i>

655
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,668
<i>Remember, I'm watching.</i>

656
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:43,797
I see everything.

657
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:48,176
There's your pep talk.

658
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,678
Compared to your shit, she killed it.

659
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:52,680
<i>So that's it?</i>

660
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,725
What, we some kind of Suicide Squad?

661
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:58,353
I'll notify your next of kin.

662
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,190
Alpha, Bravo team. Mount up!

663
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:09,197
You're late.

664
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:38,143
This is Katana. She's got my back.

665
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:41,229
She can cut all of you in half
with one sword stroke,

666
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:43,898
just like mowing the lawn.

667
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:45,984
I would advise not getting killed by her.

668
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:49,404
Her sword traps the souls of its victims.

669
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:52,574
Harley Quinn. Nice to meet ya.

670
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,741
<i>Love your perfume.</i>

671
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,327
What is that? The stench of death?

672
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:03,126
Whoa! Easy, cowgirl.
Ain't that kind of a mission. Have a seat.

673
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,086
She seems nice.

674
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:25,857
Shh.

675
00:50:27,317 --> 00:50:28,318
Hey.

676
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,279
Is he supposed to be green like that?

677
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:35,783
Oh!

678
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,493
Party foul!

679
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:39,704
Not cool.

680
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:54,427
Ooh. Look at the pretty lights!

681
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,680
Are you guys seeing this?

682
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:00,058
What happened?

683
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,645
Terror attack.

684
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:07,023
Dirty bombs, bad guys
shooting up the place with AKs.

685
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,150
You know, usual shit.

686
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:10,318
Right.

687
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:13,154
Yeah, you're a bad liar.

688
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:15,156
<i>I don't know if they told you,</i>

689
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:18,493
but I'm a hitman. I'm not a fireman.
I don't save people.

690
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,161
Anything for a dollar, right?

691
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:23,623
You know the dark places, too.
Don't act like you don't.

692
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,667
I'm a soldier!

693
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:28,670
And you're a serial killer
who takes credit cards.

694
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:33,174
When the shooting starts,
and it will, you'll cut and run.

695
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:49,190
<i>Six-one is going down.</i>

696
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:51,234
<i>Six-one is going down hard.</i>

697
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,250
<i>Stand by. Drop the ramp.</i>

698
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:18,177
Whoo! What a ride!

699
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:20,471
<i>We're okay. We're okay.
Assets are undamaged.</i>

700
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,075
- Mind games.
- What's that?

701
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:43,286
All this bomb in the neck crap.

702
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:45,246
That ain't real, mate.

703
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:48,041
See, they're trying to trap us
with our own minds, right?

704
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:51,794
But you look around, we're free, brah.

705
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:52,962
How do you know this?

706
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:55,298
Just trust me. I know, all right?
It's a con.

707
00:52:55,465 --> 00:52:58,426
Now I'm going,
because I got a life to live.

708
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:00,595
Question is, are you coming?

709
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:06,684
Yeah. Smart!

710
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:29,457
<i>Hold your fire.</i>

711
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,212
Sorry. It's what I do.

712
00:53:45,515 --> 00:53:46,516
Damn it.

713
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,770
Now that's a killer app!

714
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:52,480
<i>Okay. You wanna keep playing</i>

715
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:55,108
the <i>Hollywood Squares</i> version
of "I'll Blow Your Freaking Head Off"?

716
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,275
<i>Are you next?</i>

717
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:58,444
You tripping, homie.

718
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:00,905
You next, Deadshot?

719
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,034
You just threatened me?

720
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:06,619
Oh, yeah.

721
00:54:06,786 --> 00:54:08,329
He just threatened me.

722
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:13,459
Move.

723
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:15,211
You got a boyfriend?

724
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:20,508
All right, I'm gonna kill him.

725
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:21,676
Well, you better make it quick

726
00:54:21,843 --> 00:54:23,553
'cause he's gonna kill
all of us one by one.

727
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:26,889
I'm gonna drop him, the sword lady,
five or seven of these SEALs.

728
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:29,100
After that, I'm gonna need
some help. You down?

729
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:31,811
Always. What about the shit in our necks?

730
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:34,647
Your friend's gonna
help us out with that, right?

731
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,902
You're my friend, too.

732
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,532
Stay evil, doll face. Spread the word.

733
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:57,837
So...

734
00:54:58,004 --> 00:55:00,173
I'm thinking if we move together,

735
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:03,134
we can kill all these guys
and go our separate ways.

736
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:04,677
- Yeah?
- Sounds good.

737
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:14,145
Spread the word.

738
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:17,815
Psst. Oi. Oi.

739
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,111
We need your help, man.

740
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:23,946
When the time's right,

741
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,698
you hit Flag with a fireball.

742
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:29,577
He'll be too busy burning to death
to have a go at us with his phone of doom.

743
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:31,120
Then what?

744
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,331
Then we get out of here.

745
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:35,791
And do what?

746
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:38,127
What are you,
bloody Socrates, with all the questions?

747
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:39,420
Freedom, man.

748
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,881
Freedom! You remember that, don't you?

749
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,675
We're criminals. You know that, right?

750
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,344
Yeah. It's great.

751
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:47,929
Come on, do the bastard.

752
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:51,599
Hey, be careful.

753
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:53,100
<i>He eats people.</i>

754
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,602
Sorry, Mother Superior, what?

755
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:56,729
He eats people for reals, homie.

756
00:55:56,938 --> 00:55:57,939
He's a cannibal.

757
00:55:58,397 --> 00:55:59,649
Oh.

758
00:56:03,945 --> 00:56:05,071
No.

759
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,296
What did you say to him?

760
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,757
Nothing. Just having a laugh.

761
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:26,759
No worries.

762
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:36,143
<i>I'm standing by for follow on tac team.</i>

763
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:49,448
<i>C2, what is the operational load
of the PLS?</i>

764
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:51,033
Boss, we got people up here.

765
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,828
I'm on my way.

766
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:07,133
Shit.

767
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,260
<i>Amanda, we have hostiles up ahead.</i>

768
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:11,178
Flag, get out of there.

769
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,681
<i>We're not here to fight them.
We know that doesn't work.</i>

770
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:15,558
Copy that.

771
00:57:15,725 --> 00:57:17,018
We're diverting.

772
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:19,729
Bump out second squad two blocks east.

773
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:22,523
We'll pass through you, continue north.

774
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,066
Take Bravo two blocks east.

775
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:26,027
We'll leapfrog through you
once you're in position.

776
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,194
Copy that.

777
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:38,831
Hey. I like these odds, mate.
You just say the word.

778
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:39,999
Yeah.

779
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:41,917
Come on.

780
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:43,377
Yeah, uh...

781
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:44,879
Hold that thought.

782
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:56,432
Rick, why do they look like that?

783
00:57:56,599 --> 00:57:58,267
Just stay cool.

784
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,155
The hell are they?

785
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:14,075
You cut and run, I'll blow your head off.

786
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,129
<i>Hit them!</i>

787
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:38,391
Huh.

788
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,062
Hey.

789
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:36,115
Ha!

790
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:52,006
Get off me!

791
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,386
Get off me! Son of a--

792
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,100
Flag!

793
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:05,853
- Good riddance.
<i>- Harley!</i>

794
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,354
He dies, we die.

795
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,076
- Thanks.
- Shut up.

796
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,288
Backblast, clear!

797
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:14,713
Pinky.

798
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:20,928
That's how I cut and run.

799
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:30,187
<i>Hey.</i>

800
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,355
Hey, come on.

801
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,774
What? I saw it move.

802
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:37,152
See? It flinched. I think.

803
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,488
Hey, you were some help, princess.

804
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:41,907
It's better this way.

805
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:43,534
Trust me.

806
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:45,452
Oh, yeah, you're the fire bloke, eh?

807
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,788
- Yeah, I was. Yeah.
- Right. Yeah. Hey.

808
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:50,291
Well, looky here.

809
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,001
Whoo! It's fire.

810
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:53,252
Whoo!

811
01:01:55,129 --> 01:01:57,256
The brief said terrorists.

812
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,841
<i>You wanna start explaining this?</i>

813
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:00,467
<i>if I told you, would you believe me?</i>

814
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:03,721
- What are they?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

815
01:02:03,888 --> 01:02:05,347
That's bullshit.

816
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:08,350
Thing has on a $3,000 watch.

817
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,103
Is that a person?

818
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:12,771
It was.

819
01:02:13,606 --> 01:02:14,982
Now it's not.

820
01:02:16,317 --> 01:02:17,359
<i>Hey, don't!</i>

821
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:19,194
What?

822
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,654
We got a job to do.

823
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:24,825
We're moving.

824
01:02:27,995 --> 01:02:29,830
Get your boys moving.

825
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:33,667
Let's go.

826
01:02:42,343 --> 01:02:44,386
<i>Waller,
we're moving on the objective.</i>

827
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:46,013
We lost contact with Bravo.
You got a visual?

828
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:47,181
<i>Stand by.</i>

829
01:02:47,348 --> 01:02:49,683
- Anything on the other squad?
- No, ma'am.

830
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:52,186
Go-7, I need your sensors
on those coordinates.

831
01:02:52,353 --> 01:02:53,354
Flag, it's a negative.

832
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,482
<i>They were engaged when you were,
but we lost them.</i>

833
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:34,436
<i>Seriously?</i>

834
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:36,939
The hell is wrong with you people?

835
01:03:37,106 --> 01:03:40,067
We're bad guys. It's what we do.

836
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:01,255
<i>Hey, Deadshot. I've been thinking.</i>

837
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:04,591
If we don't come together,
no one's walking out of here alive.

838
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,261
Hmm.

839
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:08,679
And?

840
01:04:09,138 --> 01:04:11,223
These people respect you.
You got influence.

841
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,101
All right. What's your play right now?

842
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:15,811
You're a man of your word, right?

843
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:20,107
I want my mission.

844
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,443
You want your life and your kid back.

845
01:04:23,444 --> 01:04:28,240
You help me keep this Mardi Gras parade
in line and I'll hook you up.

846
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:32,077
Waller is the puppet master.

847
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:33,996
You ain't got shit to hook me up with.

848
01:04:34,163 --> 01:04:35,789
I got plenty of my own strings to pull.

849
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:37,708
You just get them
to the top of that target building

850
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,793
and get my rescuee
on that extraction helo.

851
01:04:40,461 --> 01:04:41,795
And you're gonna make sure I get paid?

852
01:04:41,962 --> 01:04:43,130
And you get paid.

853
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:45,924
You get paid,
and you get your fresh start.

854
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:54,183
<i>Take a knee.</i>

855
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,523
Our body's at the top of that building.

856
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:02,983
We get up there,

857
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:04,818
pull them out of the vault
they're hiding in.

858
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:06,779
<i>Helos extract us off the roof.</i>

859
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,530
- It's Miller time.
- Check.

860
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,909
Flag, who's up there?

861
01:05:12,076 --> 01:05:13,160
<i>That's none of your concern.</i>

862
01:05:13,327 --> 01:05:15,079
<i>- Do you know who's up there?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

863
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,497
<i>Is it the President?</i>

864
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:17,664
<i>It's not the President.</i>

865
01:05:29,885 --> 01:05:31,178
Argh!

866
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:53,367
Oh, you!

867
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:55,494
You're not leaving me.
You're not leaving me!

868
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:57,871
You're a pain in the ass.

869
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:03,127
I have done everything you said.

870
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:06,505
Every test, every trial, every initiation.

871
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:09,466
I have proved I love you. Just accept it.

872
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,176
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

873
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:15,389
I am not someone who is loved.

874
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:18,851
I'm an idea.

875
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:21,228
A state of mind.

876
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:24,982
I execute my will according to my plan.

877
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:28,110
And you, Doctor...

878
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:29,945
Are not part of my plan.

879
01:06:30,112 --> 01:06:33,740
Just let me in. I promise--
Let me in! I promise I won't hurt you.

880
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,242
A promise-promise?

881
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:36,827
Hey, dick face!

882
01:06:37,578 --> 01:06:39,746
Mind screaming at your bitch
somewhere else?

883
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:44,126
I was gonna say,
"I wouldn't do that if I were you."

884
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:49,756
Don't hurt me.

885
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:51,425
I'll be your friend.

886
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:58,056
Do it. Do it, do it, do it.

887
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:01,768
My heart scares you, and a gun doesn't?

888
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:03,020
Do it!

889
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:12,946
If you weren't so crazy,
I'd think you were insane.

890
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:16,825
Go away.

891
01:07:20,037 --> 01:07:21,747
<i>Harley, you coming?</i>

892
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:37,471
Why do you eat people?

893
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,810
Gives me their power.

894
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:45,771
Would you like to eat me?

895
01:07:47,648 --> 01:07:48,899
Hell, no.

896
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:50,317
Aw, why not?

897
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:52,819
I don't want your crazy.

898
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:56,657
Says the guy who lives in a sewer.

899
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,825
At least I know it's a sewer.

900
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,286
Oh, I get it.

901
01:08:01,662 --> 01:08:03,830
'Cause like, this is a sewer, too,

902
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:06,333
only with
nice shops and restaurants, right?

903
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,002
- Mmm.
- You hate mankind much?

904
01:08:10,504 --> 01:08:11,672
Let me guess.

905
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:16,343
Mommy didn't take you to Chuck E. Cheese
on your sixth birthday.

906
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,012
I can recommend a good therapist.

907
01:08:21,974 --> 01:08:22,975
Why?

908
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:24,559
Because I'm bored.

909
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:28,772
I need a victim,
a mind to pry apart and spit in.

910
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:31,191
Leave it, mate.
She's a rabbit hole. Don't fall in.

911
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,198
And here's one now.

912
01:08:39,533 --> 01:08:41,743
Japanese, female.

913
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:46,164
Mid-20s, 5'5", good health, athletic.

914
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:47,874
And...

915
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:50,961
An only child.

916
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:54,756
With deep-seated father issues.

917
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:59,886
Daddy wanted a son,
so she has to hide behind a mask.

918
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:06,601
I am not

919
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:09,187
hiding.

920
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:12,190
Now, that was gangster.

921
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,026
Harley.

922
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:15,861
Why don't you
stop acting like a drunken stripper?

923
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:17,863
You wanna tell me
what the hell is going on, then?

924
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,072
'Cause...

925
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:21,491
I smell a rat.

926
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:25,495
If they don't blow our heads off,

927
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:27,706
we'll have to
fight our way out of this city.

928
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:31,084
I need you to
play nice with the other children.

929
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:34,379
And quietly return to my cage.

930
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:36,548
Sure, okay.

931
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:40,427
Hey, that's okay, sellout.
I get it. I get it.

932
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,888
I know how the world works, okay?

933
01:09:43,472 --> 01:09:45,599
And when it comes to the heart,

934
01:09:46,767 --> 01:09:48,477
everyone for themselves, right?

935
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:09,373
Waller?

936
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:13,085
<i>We're about to enter the building.
Get that chopper ready.</i>

937
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:18,632
What do you say we get this over with?

938
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:21,176
What the hell? Deadshot. Fall back.

939
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:28,850
You mind if we tag along?

940
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,449
Whoo! Looks like we have
a spot of luck, eh?

941
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:47,661
<i>Be a walk in the park.</i>

942
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:49,454
Easy peasy.

943
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:51,331
Don't make me shoot you.

944
01:10:56,837 --> 01:10:58,380
<i>God damn it. Harley!</i>

945
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:00,173
Go, go, go, go!

946
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,347
Hey, guys!

947
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:57,230
Come on. Let's go.

948
01:12:06,615 --> 01:12:10,076
Ma'am. I got motion detectors going off
on the secure floors.

949
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:15,040
- Flag, they're all around you.
- Hold.

950
01:12:15,207 --> 01:12:17,209
<i>Use extreme caution.</i>

951
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,420
I don't like this, Flag.

952
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,798
I don't like it either.

953
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:29,262
Pussy.

954
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:31,556
I will knock your ass out.

955
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:33,099
I do not care that you're a girl.

956
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,110
They're after Flag again.

957
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:27,779
Son of a bitch. Get off me.

958
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:33,994
Circle up. Circle around him.

959
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:41,751
- Let me fight!
- You die, we die.

960
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,840
Clear! Everyone move out!

961
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,023
- Where you been, homie?
- This ain't my fight!

962
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:05,942
You know what? You don't stand for shit.
You ain't about shit!

963
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:07,193
Don't touch me, man!

964
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,528
Don't touch you? What you gonna do?

965
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:10,530
- Don't touch me!
- I'm touching you! I'm touching you!

966
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:12,532
- Do something. Do something!
- Don't touch me!

967
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:13,950
- You wanna see something?
- Oh, yeah, I wanna see--

968
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:16,036
- You wanna see something?
- Yes, I wanna see something.

969
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:42,145
I was just trying to get you there.

970
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:44,898
Phil Jackson. We good, right?

971
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:49,861
I knew you'd come through.

972
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:51,905
That shit crazy.

973
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,249
Clear.

974
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:18,598
I gotta work on my cardio.

975
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:30,276
Question.

976
01:15:32,696 --> 01:15:34,406
Would you die for me?

977
01:15:36,658 --> 01:15:37,659
Yes.

978
01:15:37,826 --> 01:15:39,411
That's too easy.

979
01:15:40,412 --> 01:15:41,871
Would you...

980
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:46,418
Would you live for me?

981
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:49,379
Mmm?

982
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:50,797
Yes.

983
01:15:51,548 --> 01:15:53,133
Careful.

984
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:57,971
Do not say this oath thoughtlessly.

985
01:15:59,973 --> 01:16:03,143
Desire becomes surrender.
Surrender becomes power.

986
01:16:07,147 --> 01:16:08,398
Do you want this?

987
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:10,734
I do.

988
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,277
Say it.

989
01:16:12,444 --> 01:16:15,155
Say it. Say it.

990
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:17,824
Pretty, pretty, pretty...

991
01:16:17,991 --> 01:16:19,117
Please.

992
01:16:20,285 --> 01:16:21,828
Aw! God, you're so...

993
01:16:22,454 --> 01:16:23,496
<i>Good.</i>

994
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,730
Whoa!

995
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:32,774
Relax. Just me.

996
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:38,530
You ever been in love?

997
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,575
Nah. Never.

998
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:44,035
Bullshit.

999
01:17:44,202 --> 01:17:46,037
You don't kill as many people
as I've killed

1000
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:49,833
and still sleep like a kitten
if you feel shit like love.

1001
01:17:52,544 --> 01:17:54,379
Another textbook sociopath.

1002
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:59,717
Clear.

1003
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:00,885
Clear.

1004
01:18:02,095 --> 01:18:03,263
All right, secure the roof.

1005
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:06,015
Sweep for shooters
so we can bring in our aviation assets.

1006
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:07,225
Going to the roof.

1007
01:18:14,065 --> 01:18:15,692
Oh. Wait here.

1008
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:17,318
<i>Please.</i>

1009
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:20,071
I don't wanna give this dude
a heart attack. Okay?

1010
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:22,949
Aw, he's embarrassed of us!

1011
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:24,367
<i>Hey, Flag.</i>

1012
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:26,828
This dude better cure cancer
after all of this shit.

1013
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:36,212
You ready? Let's go.

1014
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,132
You wouldn't have made it without them.

1015
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:42,302
We got lucky. I don't do luck.
I do planning and precision.

1016
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:44,846
Admit it, Rick. I was right.

1017
01:18:45,013 --> 01:18:47,640
Yeah, I told you to get on the damn truck.
Why'd you stay?

1018
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,559
I was studying your girlfriend.

1019
01:18:49,726 --> 01:18:53,396
She takes an average person,
a yoga mom, an elderly retiree,

1020
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:56,357
and she turns them into a soldier
who can take a headshot and still fight.

1021
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:58,818
It's an instant army.

1022
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,029
How'd she do it, Flag?

1023
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:05,241
How'd she game the system
with you watching her every move?

1024
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:09,829
I'll accept the consequences.

1025
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:12,415
I am your consequence.

1026
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:13,917
<i>You might need to be careful.</i>

1027
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:16,753
They think we're rescuing Nelson Mandela.

1028
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,421
I can take care of myself.

1029
01:19:18,588 --> 01:19:19,797
Shut it down, wipe the drives.

1030
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:21,424
- Yes, ma'am.
- Copy that.

1031
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:25,178
Uh, hey, man. I know you can't hear me
'cause you're trapped

1032
01:19:25,345 --> 01:19:27,889
in your temple of soldierly
self-righteousness,

1033
01:19:28,056 --> 01:19:31,476
but a two-faced dude like you
wouldn't survive a second on the street.

1034
01:19:31,643 --> 01:19:33,519
Oh, says the guy
who shoots people for money.

1035
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:34,854
My cards is on the table, man.

1036
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:36,439
It got done, didn't it?

1037
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:46,616
Damn. That is just a mean lady.

1038
01:19:47,659 --> 01:19:49,243
Yeah. You get used to it.

1039
01:19:51,204 --> 01:19:53,039
And I'm the bad guy?

1040
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:58,503
That's gangsta.

1041
01:19:59,671 --> 01:20:00,713
What?

1042
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,674
They weren't cleared for any of this.
Any of it.

1043
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,843
Hey, I'm not judging.
I've buried a lot of mistakes, too.

1044
01:20:16,354 --> 01:20:17,563
No way.

1045
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:29,242
Let's go home.

1046
01:20:29,409 --> 01:20:30,952
<i>Yeah, let's go home.</i>

1047
01:20:31,703 --> 01:20:34,789
That sounds good.
You guys wanna go home? Hmm?

1048
01:20:34,956 --> 01:20:36,958
<i>Or you wanna go back to prison?</i>

1049
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:38,584
I'm not going back to prison.

1050
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:41,504
What I'm saying is we kill the pair of 'em
now before they kill us.

1051
01:20:42,964 --> 01:20:44,757
I got this.

1052
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:49,554
You all made it this far.

1053
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:53,558
Don't get high-spirited on me
and ruin a good thing.

1054
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:11,784
I like her.

1055
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:17,707
<i>Savior One-Zero,
this is Ground Element.</i>

1056
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:24,130
<i>Savior One-Zero, how copy?</i>

1057
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:27,592
Savior One-Zero, the LZ's clear.

1058
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:34,640
<i>Boss, they're not talking to me.</i>

1059
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:37,935
Our bird's been jacked.

1060
01:21:39,729 --> 01:21:40,730
Light it up!

1061
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:08,883
What? I got a hickey or something?

1062
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:11,052
<i>Professor,
could you pick up the pace?</i>

1063
01:22:23,356 --> 01:22:24,398
Harley!

1064
01:22:27,777 --> 01:22:29,028
Hello, baby.

1065
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:32,490
Kill her!

1066
01:22:34,242 --> 01:22:36,244
Her nanite's disarmed!

1067
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:39,914
Come on, baby.

1068
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:56,514
<i>Deadshot,</i>

1069
01:22:57,557 --> 01:22:59,392
shoot that woman right now!

1070
01:22:59,559 --> 01:23:01,435
She ain't do shit to me.

1071
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:03,688
You're a hitman, right?

1072
01:23:03,855 --> 01:23:05,064
I got a contract.

1073
01:23:05,231 --> 01:23:09,110
Kill Harley Quinn.
Do it for your freedom and your kid.

1074
01:23:11,154 --> 01:23:12,905
Now she dead.

1075
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:53,696
I missed.

1076
01:23:58,618 --> 01:23:59,619
Good one, mate.

1077
01:24:00,411 --> 01:24:01,871
It's Waller.

1078
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:05,499
Savior One-Zero's been hijacked.
Shoot it down.

1079
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,627
<i>Roger that, ma'am. Going hot.</i>

1080
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:16,928
Puddin'!

1081
01:24:22,016 --> 01:24:23,976
You got all dressed up for me?

1082
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:26,646
Oh, you know I'd do anything for you.

1083
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:29,315
By the way,
I've got some grape soda on ice,

1084
01:24:29,482 --> 01:24:30,775
and a bear skin rug waiting.

1085
01:24:30,942 --> 01:24:31,943
Yeah?

1086
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:33,653
Boss, we got a problem!

1087
01:24:34,028 --> 01:24:35,196
Huh?

1088
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,578
- This bird is baked.
- No.

1089
01:24:44,372 --> 01:24:46,666
Okay, honey. It's me and you.

1090
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,084
Let's do it.

1091
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:16,153
<i>Target destroyed, ma'am.</i>

1092
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,364
Thank you. Now get me off this roof.

1093
01:25:19,365 --> 01:25:20,908
<i>Yes, ma'am. We are inbound.</i>

1094
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:26,414
<i>The Joker and Harley Quinn are no more.</i>

1095
01:25:31,752 --> 01:25:32,962
You couldn't save her.

1096
01:25:37,425 --> 01:25:38,926
<i>Roger. I see ya.</i>

1097
01:25:42,263 --> 01:25:43,264
Watch your step, ma'am.

1098
01:25:45,725 --> 01:25:48,519
Stand by. I'll send another helo!

1099
01:26:49,205 --> 01:26:51,248
Waller's down.

1100
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:52,416
It's over.

1101
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,504
Ops just confirmed. She's down. 1k west.

1102
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:00,758
Let's go get her.

1103
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:07,681
The mission's not over.

1104
01:27:07,848 --> 01:27:11,060
Nah. It is for me. We had a deal.

1105
01:27:11,352 --> 01:27:13,354
Without Waller, you got nothing.

1106
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:02,194
Hey, guys. I'm back!

1107
01:28:03,529 --> 01:28:05,906
I missed you all so much.

1108
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:09,493
We're glad you could make it.

1109
01:28:23,257 --> 01:28:25,259
Hey, craziness.

1110
01:29:11,305 --> 01:29:14,975
With my heart returned,
I can finish my weapon.

1111
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:19,313
Now tell me how to destroy your armies.

1112
01:29:19,522 --> 01:29:21,398
Do your worst, bitch!

1113
01:29:49,927 --> 01:29:50,928
<i>So let me guess.</i>

1114
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:55,140
We're going to
the swirling ring of trash in the sky.

1115
01:29:55,641 --> 01:29:57,309
<i>You know, 'cause why wouldn't we?</i>

1116
01:29:59,979 --> 01:30:01,855
When does this end, Flag?

1117
01:30:02,022 --> 01:30:03,566
Load up. We're in for a fight.

1118
01:30:28,674 --> 01:30:31,969
You tell everybody everything.

1119
01:30:32,553 --> 01:30:34,888
Or me and you gonna go right now.

1120
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:42,187
Three days ago,

1121
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:45,149
<i>a non-human entity appeared
in the subway station.</i>

1122
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:48,569
Waller, we're almost there.

1123
01:30:48,736 --> 01:30:52,197
<i>So Waller sent me and a woman
with incredible abilities.</i>

1124
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:54,199
<i>Enchantress.</i>

1125
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,702
<i>A witch.</i>

1126
01:30:57,745 --> 01:31:00,998
<i>See, nobody could get near this thing,
but the witch could.</i>

1127
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:04,335
Bomb's ready.

1128
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:06,086
Set for two seconds.

1129
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:07,630
You just press the button and drop it.

1130
01:31:11,717 --> 01:31:14,637
Needless to say,
the whole thing was a bad idea.

1131
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:15,971
She bolted!

1132
01:31:16,138 --> 01:31:17,598
Shit!

1133
01:31:25,481 --> 01:31:28,233
And that's how she escaped from Waller.

1134
01:31:30,611 --> 01:31:31,987
So now you know.

1135
01:31:33,489 --> 01:31:35,324
You can just kill me right now,

1136
01:31:36,742 --> 01:31:38,285
but I'm going to have a drink.

1137
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:40,287
Hey, Deadshot, I need your help.

1138
01:31:40,871 --> 01:31:43,874
No, sir. You need a miracle.

1139
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:18,033
<i>What ya having, K.C. ?</i>

1140
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:21,036
<i>Bloody Mary, right?</i>

1141
01:32:22,913 --> 01:32:24,998
Drink dulls the mind.

1142
01:32:25,666 --> 01:32:27,960
K.C., it's the end of the world.

1143
01:32:28,335 --> 01:32:29,878
Have a drink with us.

1144
01:32:30,921 --> 01:32:31,964
Beer.

1145
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:34,425
There he is. Give the man a beer.

1146
01:32:36,677 --> 01:32:38,178
How about you, hot stuff?

1147
01:32:40,931 --> 01:32:41,974
Water.

1148
01:32:42,224 --> 01:32:43,809
That's a good idea, honey.

1149
01:32:46,395 --> 01:32:47,521
Ninja?

1150
01:32:48,105 --> 01:32:49,106
<i>You want some sake?</i>

1151
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:50,983
Whiskey.

1152
01:32:51,358 --> 01:32:52,443
Whiskey.

1153
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:54,319
Okay.

1154
01:32:56,822 --> 01:32:57,823
What am I, 12?

1155
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:08,000
Here's to honor among thieves.

1156
01:33:08,584 --> 01:33:10,085
I'm not a thief.

1157
01:33:11,962 --> 01:33:13,630
Oh. She's not a thief.

1158
01:33:20,596 --> 01:33:23,682
I actually prefer to think of myself
as an asset relocation specialist.

1159
01:33:24,183 --> 01:33:25,517
Mmm.

1160
01:33:25,976 --> 01:33:28,353
Well, we almost pulled it off

1161
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:31,231
despite what everybody thought.

1162
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:34,318
We weren't picked to succeed.
You know that, right?

1163
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,820
We were all chosen to fail.

1164
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:38,447
Yeah, I know that.

1165
01:33:38,614 --> 01:33:41,784
Worst part of it is, they're going to
blame us for the whole thing.

1166
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:44,620
<i>And they can't have people
knowing the truth.</i>

1167
01:33:45,204 --> 01:33:46,789
We're the patsies.

1168
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:48,207
The cover-up.

1169
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:51,710
Don't forget, we're the bad guys.

1170
01:33:56,965 --> 01:34:00,803
So you gonna tell us now
what your "big deal" with Flag was?

1171
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:04,056
Same thing Waller offered me, to kill you.

1172
01:34:04,473 --> 01:34:06,266
The chance to be a father.

1173
01:34:07,017 --> 01:34:09,144
Chance at a life outside the shadows.

1174
01:34:11,146 --> 01:34:12,689
I trusted Flag.

1175
01:34:13,232 --> 01:34:15,359
Flag had you
chasing a carrot on a stick, homie.

1176
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:16,735
You don't... You don't know that?

1177
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:18,570
I love this guy.

1178
01:34:18,904 --> 01:34:20,155
You played yourself, dawg.

1179
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:22,199
Bitch, I'm having a drink.

1180
01:34:22,741 --> 01:34:25,244
I'm breathing fresh air.

1181
01:34:25,619 --> 01:34:26,787
And, uh,

1182
01:34:26,954 --> 01:34:29,122
for two sweet seconds...

1183
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:31,875
I had hope.

1184
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:34,127
You had hope, huh?

1185
01:34:35,838 --> 01:34:38,090
Hope don't stop
the wheel from turning, my brother.

1186
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,050
Hmm. You preaching?

1187
01:34:40,259 --> 01:34:42,094
It's coming back around for you.

1188
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:45,264
How many people you killed, man?

1189
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:48,141
You don't ask nobody
no question like that, <i>ese.</i>

1190
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:51,061
You ain't ever whacked down no women.

1191
01:34:51,228 --> 01:34:52,729
No kids.

1192
01:34:54,231 --> 01:34:55,858
I don't kill women or children.

1193
01:34:56,358 --> 01:34:57,359
I do.

1194
01:35:00,821 --> 01:35:03,448
See, I was born with the Devil's gift.

1195
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:06,952
I kept it hidden
for most of my life, but...

1196
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:10,080
The older I got, the stronger it got.

1197
01:35:10,247 --> 01:35:11,999
So I started using it.

1198
01:35:13,292 --> 01:35:14,960
For business, you know.

1199
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:18,297
The more power on the street I got,
the more fire power I got.

1200
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:19,715
Like, that shit went hand in hand.

1201
01:35:19,882 --> 01:35:22,426
<i>You know? One was feeding the other.</i>

1202
01:35:23,427 --> 01:35:25,596
Ain't nobody tell me no.

1203
01:35:26,763 --> 01:35:28,265
<i>Except my old lady.</i>

1204
01:35:30,851 --> 01:35:33,228
<i>You know, she used to, uh, pray for me.</i>

1205
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:34,396
You're welcome.

1206
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:38,025
Even when I didn't want it.

1207
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,621
God didn't give me this.

1208
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:53,832
Why should he take it away?

1209
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:55,834
<i>Hey.</i>

1210
01:35:58,128 --> 01:35:59,171
This is our home.

1211
01:35:59,338 --> 01:36:00,714
You put that back where you found it.

1212
01:36:00,881 --> 01:36:02,341
I'm taking my kids to Mom's.

1213
01:36:02,507 --> 01:36:04,509
You ain't taking my kids nowhere!

1214
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:07,930
See, when I get mad, I lose control.
You know, I just...

1215
01:36:09,181 --> 01:36:10,182
I don't know what I do...

1216
01:36:17,189 --> 01:36:18,857
...till it's done.

1217
01:36:33,455 --> 01:36:34,790
<i>And the kids?</i>

1218
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:39,544
He killed them.

1219
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:44,967
Didn't you?

1220
01:36:53,141 --> 01:36:54,768
Own that shit.

1221
01:36:55,727 --> 01:36:56,728
Own it!

1222
01:36:56,895 --> 01:36:59,398
What'd you think was gonna happen? Huh?

1223
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:01,233
Hey, Harley. Come on.

1224
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,110
What, you were just...

1225
01:37:03,276 --> 01:37:04,861
Thinking you can have a happy family

1226
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:07,781
and coach little leagues,
and make car payments?

1227
01:37:07,948 --> 01:37:09,700
Normal's a setting on the dryer.

1228
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:12,327
People like us, we don't get normal!

1229
01:37:12,494 --> 01:37:14,663
Why is it always a knife fight

1230
01:37:14,830 --> 01:37:17,541
every single time you open your mouth?

1231
01:37:19,084 --> 01:37:22,587
You know, outside you're amazing.

1232
01:37:24,172 --> 01:37:26,883
But inside, you're ugly.

1233
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:28,802
We all are.

1234
01:37:28,969 --> 01:37:32,264
We all are! Except for him.

1235
01:37:34,307 --> 01:37:35,976
He's ugly on the outside, too.

1236
01:37:36,143 --> 01:37:38,228
Not me, shorty.

1237
01:37:42,274 --> 01:37:44,109
I'm beautiful.

1238
01:37:44,693 --> 01:37:46,862
Yeah, you are.

1239
01:37:56,830 --> 01:37:58,373
We don't want you here.

1240
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:09,801
You get to the part in that binder
saying I was sleeping with her?

1241
01:38:11,136 --> 01:38:12,345
Yeah.

1242
01:38:13,722 --> 01:38:16,475
I never been with a witch before.
What's that like?

1243
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:23,023
Apparently, that's why the creatures
chase him all the time.

1244
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:26,068
<i>'Cause, uh, the witch is scared of him.</i>

1245
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:28,153
The only woman I ever cared about

1246
01:38:28,737 --> 01:38:31,281
<i>is trapped inside that monster.</i>

1247
01:38:31,448 --> 01:38:33,992
If I don't stop the witch, it's over.

1248
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:35,660
Everything is over.

1249
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:37,579
<i>Everything.</i>

1250
01:38:40,749 --> 01:38:41,750
You're free to go.

1251
01:38:56,306 --> 01:38:58,016
Your daughter writes you every day.

1252
01:39:02,229 --> 01:39:04,022
Every single day.

1253
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:21,623
You had these the whole time?

1254
01:39:23,208 --> 01:39:26,628
You had letters from my daughter
the whole time?

1255
01:39:30,882 --> 01:39:32,217
I'm gonna get you there.

1256
01:39:33,385 --> 01:39:35,053
And you're gonna end this.

1257
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:37,514
I'm gonna carry your ass if I have to.

1258
01:39:38,849 --> 01:39:42,102
'Cause this shit is gonna be
like a chapter in the Bible.

1259
01:39:42,686 --> 01:39:44,938
Everybody's gonna know what we did.

1260
01:39:45,564 --> 01:39:50,569
And my daughter is gonna know
that her daddy is not a piece of shit.

1261
01:40:00,245 --> 01:40:01,746
I'll come.

1262
01:40:05,584 --> 01:40:07,002
What?

1263
01:40:07,169 --> 01:40:08,545
You got something better to do?

1264
01:40:08,712 --> 01:40:10,255
Come on!

1265
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,425
Pussies.

1266
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,379
<i>We think that thing's a weapon.</i>

1267
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:52,631
Here. Lower.

1268
01:41:00,347 --> 01:41:02,224
We gotta take out the big one.

1269
01:41:05,018 --> 01:41:08,230
I left a big ass demo charge
down there in that subway.

1270
01:41:09,689 --> 01:41:12,776
There's a flooded tunnel,
leads right underneath that building.

1271
01:41:12,943 --> 01:41:17,364
SEALs, they can recover the charge,
swim in underneath that thing's feet.

1272
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:20,450
<i>We get in its face and distract the hell
out of that son of a bitch</i>

1273
01:41:20,617 --> 01:41:21,910
<i>so the swimmers can blow the bomb.</i>

1274
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:25,747
That's how we take it out.

1275
01:41:36,383 --> 01:41:38,176
I'm going with ya.

1276
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:41,429
We got this.

1277
01:41:41,596 --> 01:41:43,640
I'm not asking, bro.

1278
01:41:47,143 --> 01:41:49,354
I live underground.

1279
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:51,856
Y'all are just tourists.

1280
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:19,301
The man who killed her husband
used that sword.

1281
01:42:21,011 --> 01:42:23,221
<i>His soul's trapped inside of it.</i>

1282
01:42:23,972 --> 01:42:25,640
She talks to him.

1283
01:42:26,349 --> 01:42:27,726
<i>Hey, well,</i>

1284
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:30,103
you know what they say
about the crazy ones.

1285
01:42:31,688 --> 01:42:32,689
Huh?

1286
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:41,406
Let's do this.

1287
01:43:19,277 --> 01:43:20,695
You must really love this girl.

1288
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:28,286
Man, I thought love was bullshit.
Dead serious.

1289
01:43:29,871 --> 01:43:32,499
Desire, mutual benefit, whatever.

1290
01:43:33,083 --> 01:43:35,960
I mean, I get that, but actual love?

1291
01:43:36,378 --> 01:43:38,296
I rated that with UFOs.

1292
01:43:39,172 --> 01:43:41,716
Lot of believers, no proof.

1293
01:43:45,178 --> 01:43:46,888
And then I met June.

1294
01:43:48,807 --> 01:43:50,475
Do what you gotta do.

1295
01:43:52,143 --> 01:43:53,436
I got your back.

1296
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:05,824
You gonna fight with us?

1297
01:44:06,991 --> 01:44:08,952
What if I lose control?

1298
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:11,079
Then maybe we'll have a chance.

1299
01:44:23,508 --> 01:44:24,509
Duck in.

1300
01:44:37,564 --> 01:44:41,067
Hey, everyone can see
all this trippy magic stuff, right?

1301
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:43,027
Yeah. Why?

1302
01:44:43,194 --> 01:44:45,071
I'm off my meds.

1303
01:44:46,698 --> 01:44:47,949
<i>So that's your old lady, huh?</i>

1304
01:44:48,783 --> 01:44:49,993
Yeah.

1305
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,036
Well, you need to handle
this shit, all right?

1306
01:44:52,203 --> 01:44:55,874
Get up there, smack on her ass,
tell her, "Knock this shit off."

1307
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:58,209
I do not think that'd be wise.

1308
01:44:58,376 --> 01:45:00,378
I'm gonna draw out the big one.

1309
01:45:00,545 --> 01:45:03,006
My boys will detonate the bomb
underneath him.

1310
01:45:07,385 --> 01:45:09,888
You know, we should get a drink sometime.

1311
01:45:10,722 --> 01:45:13,683
<i>I've been waiting for you all night.</i>

1312
01:45:15,018 --> 01:45:18,938
Step out of the shadows. I won't bite.

1313
01:45:21,566 --> 01:45:22,692
Hmm.

1314
01:45:22,859 --> 01:45:24,694
What the hell? Grab her.

1315
01:45:26,321 --> 01:45:28,531
<i>Why are you here?</i>

1316
01:45:28,698 --> 01:45:31,826
Because the soldier led you?

1317
01:45:31,993 --> 01:45:33,578
<i>And all for Waller.</i>

1318
01:45:33,745 --> 01:45:36,706
Why do you serve those who cage you?

1319
01:45:36,915 --> 01:45:39,209
I am your ally.

1320
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:41,794
And I know what you want.

1321
01:45:41,961 --> 01:45:44,839
<i>Exactly what you want.</i>

1322
01:46:26,548 --> 01:46:28,132
Baby. Baby.

1323
01:46:29,092 --> 01:46:31,803
Baby, it's just a nightmare.

1324
01:46:33,096 --> 01:46:34,806
It's just a bad dream.

1325
01:46:35,431 --> 01:46:36,641
I'm here.

1326
01:46:47,443 --> 01:46:48,570
<i>Miss me?</i>

1327
01:46:55,994 --> 01:46:59,414
I'll put the kids to sleep
and then maybe we can kick it?

1328
01:47:01,249 --> 01:47:02,250
Yeah?

1329
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:08,256
I can't change what I did.
And neither can you!

1330
01:47:08,423 --> 01:47:10,049
He married me!

1331
01:47:11,676 --> 01:47:13,011
It's not real.

1332
01:47:13,595 --> 01:47:14,721
I killed the Bat.

1333
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:16,472
Nah, homie. You don't want that.

1334
01:47:17,098 --> 01:47:18,725
What? I want that.

1335
01:47:18,891 --> 01:47:20,435
She trying to play games with you, man.

1336
01:47:20,602 --> 01:47:22,312
- It's not real!
- He's right.

1337
01:47:23,146 --> 01:47:24,355
It's not real.

1338
01:47:27,108 --> 01:47:29,611
How long have you been able to see?

1339
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:31,738
My whole life.

1340
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:34,782
You can't have them.

1341
01:47:34,949 --> 01:47:36,242
These are my people right here.

1342
01:47:36,409 --> 01:47:38,202
<i>But it is our time.</i>

1343
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:43,207
The sun is setting, and the magic rises.
The met a humans are a sign of change.

1344
01:47:44,876 --> 01:47:47,962
Lady, you are evil!

1345
01:47:53,134 --> 01:47:54,218
Oh, wow.

1346
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:58,598
Uh-oh.

1347
01:47:59,432 --> 01:48:00,683
Who's this?

1348
01:48:01,267 --> 01:48:03,186
<i>- It's gonna be bad!</i>
- We should run.

1349
01:48:15,239 --> 01:48:16,783
GQ, come in. We're in position.

1350
01:48:26,292 --> 01:48:28,711
We gotta get him in that corner.
That's where the bomb will be.

1351
01:48:28,878 --> 01:48:30,588
I'll do it! I'll get him there.

1352
01:48:44,602 --> 01:48:46,437
I lost one family.
I ain't gonna lose another one.

1353
01:48:46,604 --> 01:48:47,939
Look, think it through.

1354
01:48:48,106 --> 01:48:51,442
I got this.
Let me show you what I really am.

1355
01:48:53,111 --> 01:48:54,112
Over here!

1356
01:49:36,821 --> 01:49:37,822
<i>Go!</i>

1357
01:49:52,295 --> 01:49:53,755
Rick, in position. Standing by.

1358
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:55,757
Diablo, drive him into the corner!

1359
01:50:10,605 --> 01:50:11,689
- Get him, mate!
- Come on.

1360
01:50:13,733 --> 01:50:15,026
Yeah, do it!

1361
01:50:25,328 --> 01:50:27,205
Diablo, get clear! Get outta there!

1362
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:28,790
Blow it!

1363
01:50:31,959 --> 01:50:33,044
Blow it.

1364
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:38,257
- Now, GQ. Now.
- No!

1365
01:50:39,884 --> 01:50:41,135
Everybody, down!

1366
01:51:19,173 --> 01:51:20,258
You next.

1367
01:51:21,926 --> 01:51:24,971
My spell is complete.

1368
01:51:25,137 --> 01:51:28,933
Once you and your armies are gone,
my darkness will spread across this world.

1369
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:32,520
And it will be mine to rule.

1370
01:51:47,869 --> 01:51:49,662
That was our main satellite uplink.

1371
01:51:54,792 --> 01:51:56,460
How did this witch even know
how to target this thing?

1372
01:51:56,627 --> 01:51:58,462
It's a secret facility.

1373
01:52:03,342 --> 01:52:05,052
You got a move here, Flag?

1374
01:52:05,219 --> 01:52:07,221
We gotta cut her heart out.

1375
01:52:38,544 --> 01:52:39,545
<i>While we're fighting,</i>

1376
01:52:39,712 --> 01:52:42,006
that thing's laying waste
to the whole damn world.

1377
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:50,514
Where is she?

1378
01:52:51,515 --> 01:52:52,808
I don't know.

1379
01:52:57,146 --> 01:52:58,147
Hey.

1380
01:53:04,528 --> 01:53:05,780
<i>Look out. Look out!</i>

1381
01:53:28,594 --> 01:53:29,595
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

1382
01:53:29,804 --> 01:53:31,055
Sorry.

1383
01:53:36,852 --> 01:53:38,229
Flag!

1384
01:54:12,555 --> 01:54:13,848
Enough!

1385
01:54:17,852 --> 01:54:23,024
Of all who have faced me,
you have earned mercy.

1386
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:25,067
For the last time,

1387
01:54:25,776 --> 01:54:28,946
join me, or die.

1388
01:54:31,282 --> 01:54:33,868
I'm not much of a joiner,

1389
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:37,079
but maybe we should.

1390
01:54:37,246 --> 01:54:38,622
Hey!

1391
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:40,458
She's trying to take over the world.

1392
01:54:40,624 --> 01:54:41,751
So?

1393
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:45,588
What's the world ever done for us, anyway?
It hates us.

1394
01:54:46,547 --> 01:54:48,049
Hey, Harley!

1395
01:54:51,469 --> 01:54:54,180
Hey, lady? Um...

1396
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:57,975
I lost my Puddin'.

1397
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:01,228
But you can get him back, right?

1398
01:55:02,146 --> 01:55:04,315
I can, my dear.

1399
01:55:04,774 --> 01:55:07,443
Anything you want.

1400
01:55:10,404 --> 01:55:11,530
You promise?

1401
01:55:11,697 --> 01:55:13,407
Yes, child.

1402
01:55:15,159 --> 01:55:16,494
You need only bow

1403
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:21,624
and serve beneath my feet.

1404
01:55:26,504 --> 01:55:28,798
I like what you're sellin', lady.

1405
01:55:29,507 --> 01:55:32,968
There's just one teeny problem.

1406
01:55:34,512 --> 01:55:35,596
You messed with my friends.

1407
01:55:41,685 --> 01:55:43,938
Her heart's out! We can end this!

1408
01:55:48,192 --> 01:55:50,152
Hey, Croc!

1409
01:55:52,947 --> 01:55:54,198
Harley!

1410
01:56:38,868 --> 01:56:41,036
<i>Please, Daddy. Don't do it.</i>

1411
01:56:42,580 --> 01:56:46,417
The only way for us to be together
is if you don't pull the trigger.

1412
01:56:47,334 --> 01:56:48,919
<i>Daddy, I love you.</i>

1413
01:56:49,837 --> 01:56:51,797
Please, don't do this.

1414
01:57:46,936 --> 01:57:48,020
That was a great shot, man.

1415
01:57:48,187 --> 01:57:50,397
Hey, I don't do hugs. I'm not a hugger.

1416
01:57:50,564 --> 01:57:53,192
I'm not a hugger. All right?

1417
01:57:59,907 --> 01:58:02,326
Let me join my brother.

1418
01:58:03,327 --> 01:58:04,536
<i>Katana, no!</i>

1419
01:58:09,541 --> 01:58:10,751
Give me that.

1420
01:58:12,836 --> 01:58:15,631
You bring June back. You bring her back.

1421
01:58:15,798 --> 01:58:17,758
She's not coming back.

1422
01:58:17,925 --> 01:58:20,552
I'll crush this. Do you hear me?

1423
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:22,596
You bring June back or I'll crush this!

1424
01:58:22,763 --> 01:58:24,014
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1425
01:58:25,015 --> 01:58:26,809
You don't have the balls.

1426
01:59:19,862 --> 01:59:20,904
Hey, Flag.

1427
01:59:30,539 --> 01:59:31,582
June!

1428
01:59:41,175 --> 01:59:42,843
She's gone.

1429
01:59:43,010 --> 01:59:44,428
I thought I killed you.

1430
01:59:44,595 --> 01:59:46,263
I thought I killed you.

1431
01:59:47,306 --> 01:59:49,808
Y'all don't mind,

1432
01:59:49,975 --> 01:59:52,603
I got me a sewer to crawl back into.

1433
01:59:52,770 --> 01:59:55,272
Yeah, and I got some business to handle
back in Gotham.

1434
01:59:55,439 --> 01:59:57,107
I'm going to hot wire a car. Need a ride?

1435
01:59:57,274 --> 01:59:58,567
Your ass is not driving.

1436
01:59:58,734 --> 01:59:59,777
<i>Why not?</i>

1437
02:00:02,529 --> 02:00:04,323
How are you not dead?

1438
02:00:04,948 --> 02:00:06,658
<i>We just saved the world.</i>

1439
02:00:07,451 --> 02:00:09,328
A "thank you" would be nice.

1440
02:00:09,953 --> 02:00:11,080
Thank you.

1441
02:00:12,039 --> 02:00:13,082
You're welcome.

1442
02:00:13,248 --> 02:00:15,000
So, we did all of this
and we don't get shit?

1443
02:00:15,167 --> 02:00:17,669
Ten years off your prison sentences.

1444
02:00:21,006 --> 02:00:23,842
Nah, that's not enough.
I'm seeing my daughter.

1445
02:00:26,303 --> 02:00:27,638
That can be arranged.

1446
02:00:28,972 --> 02:00:30,265
Any other requests?

1447
02:00:30,933 --> 02:00:32,476
Ooh. An espresso machine.

1448
02:00:33,477 --> 02:00:35,104
BET.

1449
02:00:35,813 --> 02:00:38,440
Ten years off a triple life sentence?

1450
02:00:38,607 --> 02:00:40,359
Darling, I'm walking
out of here a free man

1451
02:00:40,526 --> 02:00:42,361
or we're going
to start having some real fun.

1452
02:00:42,528 --> 02:00:44,446
Why don't we have some fun?

1453
02:00:54,331 --> 02:00:56,875
You're trying to figure out this length.

1454
02:00:57,835 --> 02:00:59,002
<i>That's the hypotenuse.</i>

1455
02:00:59,169 --> 02:01:01,004
So, you have to know this angle.

1456
02:01:01,171 --> 02:01:05,384
Okay. So, if you're up here,
like in a building,

1457
02:01:05,551 --> 02:01:08,679
and you shoot a man
down here on the street,

1458
02:01:08,846 --> 02:01:10,973
that's how far the bullet actually goes?

1459
02:01:11,849 --> 02:01:13,851
<i>Yeah. That's right.</i>

1460
02:01:14,017 --> 02:01:15,519
<i>You are so smart. Right.</i>

1461
02:01:15,686 --> 02:01:18,313
The hypotenuse. Good one. Um...

1462
02:01:19,189 --> 02:01:20,858
<i>So, that would make you
have to know the angle</i>

1463
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:23,360
<i>between the building and the sidewalk.</i>

1464
02:01:23,527 --> 02:01:25,028
<i>You got to know that angle.</i>

1465
02:01:25,195 --> 02:01:27,906
<i>No, I mean, in real life,
you have variables.</i>

1466
02:01:28,073 --> 02:01:29,366
<i>You know, you got rifling twist.</i>

1467
02:01:29,533 --> 02:01:31,869
You got chamber pressure.
You got bullet weight.

1468
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:34,830
Some shots you'll even
have to take the curvature

1469
02:01:34,997 --> 02:01:36,415
of the Earth in with the...

1470
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:38,041
It's time.

1471
02:01:39,543 --> 02:01:40,752
...wind effect.

1472
02:01:42,087 --> 02:01:44,173
You know, there's a lot of variables

1473
02:01:45,382 --> 02:01:46,884
in the street.

1474
02:01:50,721 --> 02:01:51,889
I gotta go.

1475
02:01:52,890 --> 02:01:54,183
Are you coming back?

1476
02:01:55,726 --> 02:01:56,768
Yeah.

1477
02:01:56,935 --> 02:01:59,521
I'm working it out. All right?

1478
02:01:59,688 --> 02:02:03,650
You know, I promised my friends
that I would just, you know, go,

1479
02:02:03,817 --> 02:02:06,236
without killing them all.

1480
02:02:06,403 --> 02:02:07,571
Bring it in.

1481
02:02:10,866 --> 02:02:12,075
I love you, Daddy.

1482
02:02:12,242 --> 02:02:13,243
Hmm.

1483
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:16,121
I love you.

1484
02:02:42,231 --> 02:02:44,608
<i>Hey! Let me out!</i>

1485
02:02:44,775 --> 02:02:46,652
<i>Let me out of here right now!</i>

1486
02:02:46,818 --> 02:02:49,780
Hey! You feel that? Yeah.

1487
02:02:50,656 --> 02:02:52,574
Let me out of here, darling, please.

1488
02:02:52,741 --> 02:02:53,951
Please, I'm begging you, seriously.

1489
02:02:54,117 --> 02:02:57,454
Listen to me. Have you got a car?
Because I'm a brilliant driver.

1490
02:02:57,621 --> 02:02:58,997
<i>Come on!</i>

1491
02:03:53,969 --> 02:03:55,470
Puddin'!

1492
02:03:57,806 --> 02:03:59,474
Let's go home.

1493
02:06:23,869 --> 02:06:26,288
This is crown jewels here,
Mr. Wayne.

1494
02:06:27,372 --> 02:06:29,332
And you do understand my legal exposure.

1495
02:06:29,499 --> 02:06:31,501
If anyone knew what I procured for you--

1496
02:06:31,668 --> 02:06:34,880
Listen, I can keep a secret, okay?

1497
02:06:35,046 --> 02:06:36,298
What do you want?

1498
02:06:36,465 --> 02:06:39,050
People are asking questions
about Midway City.

1499
02:06:39,217 --> 02:06:40,802
The kind of people
who can get the answers.

1500
02:06:40,969 --> 02:06:44,014
And if they can get those answers,
my head will be on a pike.

1501
02:06:44,181 --> 02:06:46,808
Consider yourself under my protection.

1502
02:06:46,975 --> 02:06:48,226
If you deliver.

1503
02:07:04,534 --> 02:07:05,994
Why, Mr. Wayne?

1504
02:07:08,371 --> 02:07:09,915
Just like to make friends.

1505
02:07:11,541 --> 02:07:12,542
That's the difference between us.

1506
02:07:12,709 --> 02:07:15,045
You believe in friendship.
I believe in leverage.

1507
02:07:16,421 --> 02:07:17,464
Good night.

1508
02:07:17,631 --> 02:07:19,633
<i>You look tired.</i>

1509
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:21,927
You should stop working nights.

1510
02:07:22,886 --> 02:07:26,890
You should shut it down,
or my friends and I'll do it for you.

1511
02:14:29,896 --> 02:14:30,897
