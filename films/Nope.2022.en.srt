1
00:00:01,953 --> 00:00:03,853
<i>And of course I set it
to Icelandic time</i>

2
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:07,280
<i>because we share a love
of the aurora borealis, Gordy.</i>

3
00:00:07,415 --> 00:00:10,833
<i>And you have no idea how to tell time.</i>

4
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:13,088
<i>Great gift, Dad.</i>

5
00:00:13,198 --> 00:00:14,996
<i>Way to think things through.</i>

6
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:18,231
<i>Somehow, you’d think that a man
who can send a rocket into space</i>

7
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:21,376
<i>would be able to manage
a halfway decent birthday present.</i>

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,150
<i>Nope.</i>

9
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,288
<i>You know, Gordy, all things considered,</i>

10
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:28,855
<i>maybe my gift isn’t so bad after all.</i>

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,079
<i>Hey, Gordy. Surprise!</i>

12
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:35,988
<i>Now, there’s a gift.</i>

13
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:38,509
<i>Here you go, Gordy.</i>

14
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:40,708
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

15
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:44,629
<i>Oh, beautiful, Haley.</i>

16
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,039
<i>Good morning,
on what is sure to be a windy one.</i>

17
00:02:03,163 --> 00:02:04,791
<i>We have a high wind warning</i>

18
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:07,400
<i>for the L.A. County
coast and valleys</i>

19
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:10,800
<i>with some clouds
sure to come in around 10:00 a.m.</i>

20
00:02:10,894 --> 00:02:13,917
<i>And even though the
high gust warning will</i>

21
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:16,774
<i>expire mid to late morning,
you’ll still want to keep...</i>

22
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,126
<i>The search for a
group of missing hikers</i>

23
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,694
<i>is set to resume this morning
just outside Agua Dulce.</i>

24
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,829
<i>The tour group went out
two days ago</i>

25
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:26,819
<i>and on the
Pacific Crest Trail</i>

26
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:29,361
<i>but didn’t come back
as expected that night.</i>

27
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:31,376
<i>Crews started searching
yesterday morning...</i>

28
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,135
<i>And traffic
is already backed up</i>

29
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:36,243
<i>due to an accident
on the southbound 101.</i>

30
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:38,997
<i>It is 7:44 with Bo and Ives.</i>

31
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:52,270
Bang.

32
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,788
Bang.

33
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:02,272
Bang.

34
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:05,469
Come on.

35
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:09,863
Down, down.
Down, down, down.

36
00:03:10,043 --> 00:03:12,384
Bang! Yes, a good boy.

37
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:14,236
Up. Up, up.

38
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,307
Okay, up. Up, up.

39
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,636
Got to keep our heads
up out the clouds on this one.

40
00:03:19,747 --> 00:03:21,151
I know.

41
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,001
Now, we land this...

42
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:32,796
Yeah. Like <i>Six Guns</i>.

43
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,239
I mean, we really put on a show, well...

44
00:03:37,152 --> 00:03:39,845
you know they’re gonna
bring us back for the sequel.

45
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:44,975
Well, we sure as hell
ain’t got to sell no more horses.

46
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:47,269
So just execute.

47
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:51,652
And we ain’t got no more problems.

48
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:56,487
You good?

49
00:03:58,832 --> 00:03:59,907
You good?

50
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:04,078
Where your sister?

51
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:06,366
What’s that about?

52
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,090
- She’s supposed to be here.
- Yeah.

53
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,022
Goddamn it.

54
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:35,901
Thought I told you to fix the damn walker.

55
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,077
You hear that?

56
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:09,559
Pops.

57
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,091
- Come on, come on. Pop.
- Firefly.

58
00:05:34,277 --> 00:05:36,404
- What else? What else?
- Ghost.

59
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,453
Beethoven.

60
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:42,242
- Commodore.
- Yeah.

61
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:43,886
Virgil.

62
00:05:44,313 --> 00:05:46,939
You good. You good.
You good. You good.

63
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:49,574
- You good, man. You good. You good.
- Ghost.

64
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:50,546
Pops?

65
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,107
- Lucky.
- Pops.

66
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:54,814
- Pops. Pops!
- Commodore.

67
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:16,787
OJ.

68
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:19,665
- Hi, horsie.
- Hey. Don’t look him in the eyes, please.

69
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,324
Okay. You ready
to do the safety meeting?

70
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:24,669
I’m gonna need like five...

71
00:08:25,252 --> 00:08:28,815
- My team’s almost here.
- Your team’s not here. Okay. Hold.

72
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,496
Sorry, I got the horse guy
talking to me, too. What’s up?

73
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:33,303
<i>- Safety meeting at the...</i>
- Copy.

74
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:36,117
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ms. Bonnie Clayton on set.

75
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:38,143
Here she is, everybody.

76
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,897
Take a look at all... of that.

77
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,151
Fynn, this is OJ,
our horse trainer.

78
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,034
You remember these guys
from <i>Flash Point</i>.

79
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:49,405
Yeah. Hi.

80
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:52,824
Your name is... OJ?

81
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:55,035
Yeah, Otis Junior.

82
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:01,959
Where’s the o-- the other guy?

83
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,307
- The senior guy?
- Dude, he died.

84
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:05,796
About six months ago.

85
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,924
A bunch of random shit
fell out of a plane.

86
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:09,883
So I guess we’re stuck
with Junior over here.

87
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,678
- No.
- Yeah.

88
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:13,812
Okay.

89
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,679
Fuck. Great.

90
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,767
Ant, how we looking?

91
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:22,521
Yeah, good, if we’re selling
a horse’s ass.

92
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,063
That’s...

93
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:27,059
legendary cinematographer
Antlers Holst over here...

94
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:28,610
Let’s go ahead
and spin the horse.

95
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,697
- But you had said “hold”, so...
- And now I’m saying “spin”. Let’s go.

96
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:35,509
Great. And while that’s spinning,
can we get makeup?

97
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:38,328
Get makeup for
Ms. Bonnie Clayton, please.

98
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:39,928
Hold on.

99
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,750
- Can you step away from the back?
- They told me to come here.

100
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,367
Good call, OJ.

101
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,201
Tell you what,
let’s do a quick safety meeting. Guys,

102
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:49,590
this is OJ, our horse trainer.

103
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:51,758
Take it away.

104
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:54,052
Kill the music, please.

105
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,649
My name is OJ.

106
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:11,361
I think my sister’s
gonna be here in a minute.

107
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,767
Little louder, please.
We cannot hear you in the back.

108
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,208
I said, we are animal wranglers

109
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:18,868
with Haywood Hollywood Horses. And...

110
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:21,776
did you know the...

111
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:24,166
- very first assem--
- Hey, yo!

112
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,292
Excuse me. Sorry.

113
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,379
I’m so sorry about that.
Let me do that. Sorry, brother.

114
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,173
- Safety meeting.
- Yeah.

115
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,580
Hello! How y’all doing?

116
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:37,020
Sorry for the tardiness.

117
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,250
My name is Emerald,
that’s OJ,

118
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:42,951
and we are your animal wranglers today
with Haywood Hollywood Horses.

119
00:10:43,138 --> 00:10:45,304
Now, did you know
that the very first

120
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:48,798
assembly of photographs in sequential order,
to create a motion picture,

121
00:10:48,878 --> 00:10:51,097
was a two-second clip
of a Black man on a horse?

122
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:53,224
Yes, it was. Yes, it was. Look it up.

123
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:55,815
Now, I know you guys know
Eadweard Muybridge,

124
00:10:55,915 --> 00:10:59,239
the grandfather of motion pictures
who took the pictures that created that clip,

125
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,538
but does anybody know the name
of the Black jockey that rode the horse?

126
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,485
No.

127
00:11:05,854 --> 00:11:07,907
Nope? I mean, the very first

128
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,255
stuntman, animal wrangler and movie star
all rolled into one,

129
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,663
and there is literally no record of him.

130
00:11:13,783 --> 00:11:16,207
That man was a Bahamian jockey

131
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,540
that went by the name
of Alistair E. Haywood.

132
00:11:18,646 --> 00:11:21,803
And he is my... great-great-grandfather.

133
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,449
- Great.
- There’s another “great” grandfather.

134
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:26,112
That’s why
back at the Haywood Ranch,

135
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:28,492
as the only Black-owned
horse trainers in Hollywood,

136
00:11:28,585 --> 00:11:31,685
we like to say, “Since the moment
pictures could move,

137
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:33,569
“we had skin in the game.”

138
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:39,973
All right, let’s get into some safety
precautions while we’re on set, shall we?

139
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:43,232
Number one, please refrain from making
any loud noises, sudden movements,

140
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,554
and keep your cell phones off.
We’d really appreciate that. Two,

141
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,400
if you see anything
that looks or feels unsafe,

142
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:49,947
contact me, OJ,
or your second in chain of command.

143
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:51,138
And three,

144
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:53,369
let’s have a great shoot!

145
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,603
And I’m Emerald Haywood.
I direct, write, produce, act.

146
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,569
I do a little
♪ Singing on the side. ♪

147
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:02,043
Motorcycles, baby. Look, I make a mean
grilled cheese if you’re looking for crafty.

148
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,597
Just holler at me.

149
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,403
Okay, that was great. That was a lot.

150
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,362
Let’s do a rehearsal.
Yeah? Rehearsal?

151
00:12:13,469 --> 00:12:16,156
Rehearsing, we should.
We should do one. Rehearsing.

152
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:18,117
I think
he might need a break.

153
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,369
Yeah, we’ll rehearse one first,
and then break, yeah?

154
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,368
- Well, I’m ready to do one.
- OJ, she’s ready to do one.

155
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,904
Tell the horse
we’re ready to do one.

156
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,706
VFX, can we get the ball in here
while we have a sec?

157
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,440
- Em.
- VFX.

158
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:32,472
And, OJ, you can step off.
Step out. Step off.

159
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:33,670
- Yeah, yeah.
- Step out.

160
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,841
Em?

161
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,256
What’s the horse’s name?

162
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,716
- Lucky.
- Lucky.

163
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:40,677
- Is he?
- VFX!

164
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,720
Yeah. Em?

165
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,347
- OJ, let’s step off.
- You calling me?

166
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,307
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I’m trying to work.

167
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,058
What’d I tell you
about that, man?

168
00:12:47,138 --> 00:12:48,477
Hey, hey!

169
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:52,876
Medic.

170
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,525
Are you okay?

171
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:12,125
<i>Look, maybe it’s just too soon?
Yeah, it’s not the gig. Not ready yet.</i>

172
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,293
Right?

173
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,625
- We need it, man.
- No, I know.

174
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,738
Your dad left an
enormous hole. I know that.

175
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:19,795
But don’t worry,
there’ll be others.

176
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:21,568
All right? I’m sorry.

177
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:22,792
- And...
- Sorry.

178
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:24,225
Just, you tell her sorry.

179
00:13:24,312 --> 00:13:26,022
Thank you for the opportunity.

180
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,285
Come on, now.

181
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,748
Oh, where’s VFX?

182
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:30,859
Oh, all right. You got it.

183
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,546
Sorry, that was...

184
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,274
So, where am I dropping you?

185
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:38,358
I’m-a go up with you.

186
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:41,359
I need to get some shit.

187
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:43,294
My little girl said, you know,

188
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:44,967
I could crash at her place, so

189
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,114
- I’ll be gone in the morning.
- So I’m gonna drive you back tomorrow?

190
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:50,919
I can find a ride.

191
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,380
But, I mean, like,

192
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,258
can I get fun OJ
out this bitch?

193
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:56,548
’Cause this wack-ass OJ
is really

194
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,607
making me feel like I’m not loved.

195
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:01,174
Is that how you want
your little sister to feel?

196
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,961
What happened to Gold Rush?

197
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:01,080
Gold Rush went bankrupt.

198
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:03,806
It’s been this for three years.

199
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,530
Damn.

200
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,233
Howdy, folks.
Welcome to Jupiter’s Claim.

201
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,847
Step on up
for the wishing well.

202
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,412
Get your Jupe Jangle.

203
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:15,016
Go on, take a picture at the well.

204
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,144
<i>Cowboys and cowgirls,</i>

205
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:19,917
<i>just a little heads-up.</i>

206
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:23,567
<i>Join us Fridays at 5:30 p.m.

- Come on over to the Sundae Saloon.

208
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,576
Get your ice-cold sarsaparilla.

209
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,460
Look at this.
I’ve never seen anything like it.

210
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:41,014
- Oh, shi--
- Come on.

211
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:42,799
I’m sorry, y’all. I’m sorry.

212
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:44,140
- Photo bomb.
- You ruined it.

213
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:47,906
- Yeah, my bad.
- Gold, I tell you. They got gold up in here.

214
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:50,253
Lucky.

215
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:51,787
Hang tight.

216
00:15:51,923 --> 00:15:53,369
I’ll be back.

217
00:15:54,424 --> 00:15:55,705
Let’s go.

218
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:14,932
How many you sold?

219
00:16:15,895 --> 00:16:17,241
How many?

220
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:18,858
Ten.

221
00:16:19,231 --> 00:16:22,273
- You sold ten of Pops’ horses?
- I’m gonna get ’em back.

222
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:24,693
- Can you stay out here?
- Why?

223
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,113
I’m developing a business relationship,
and you’re a liability right now.

224
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,740
- How am I a liability?
- “How are you a lia--”

225
00:16:32,128 --> 00:16:34,286
Don’t promote your fucking
side shit on the job.

226
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,343
- Oh, my God.
- Actor, singer,

227
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,590
dancer, seamstress, motorcycles.

228
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,749
You want to promote something,
promote this business.

229
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,340
No, OJ. No.

230
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,030
First of all, that’s not
my side shit. This is.

231
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,314
And second of all, if anybody’s a liability...

232
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:50,727
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

233
00:16:51,682 --> 00:16:54,570
Hi, there. It’s Amber again from Jupe’s Claim.

234
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:57,828
It does look like we were able
to squeeze out a couple of

235
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:00,439
extra press passes for the

236
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,147
upcoming friends and family preview.

237
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:06,634
No apology necessary.

238
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:09,048
This is in reference
to the biggest, bestest,

239
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:11,513
brand-new live show
we have coming up here at the park,

240
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:13,279
- which is sneaking up on us...
- Come in.

241
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,397
If you’d like, I can
go ahead and put you down..

242
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:16,690
OJ.

243
00:17:16,844 --> 00:17:19,869
- Thanks for coming up.
- How you doing? This is my sister Em.

244
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,545
Hi, there.

245
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,308
So...

246
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:26,922
- who’d you bring me?
- Lucky.

247
00:17:27,388 --> 00:17:29,419
He’s my second-best horse, you know...

248
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:31,218
He lost focus.

249
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:32,571
So...

250
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,099
I mean, I did, too,
but I can’t fire myself.

251
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,300
That’s good.

252
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,334
Hold up. This you?

253
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,229
You literally the Asian kid
from<i> Kid Sheriff</i>?

254
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,943
- Em, Em, Em, Em...
- No, it’s okay.

255
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:46,023
Yeah, I was Lil’ Jupe.

256
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,449
Dude, you were literally my favorite.
You mind if I get a picture real quick?

257
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,239
Hey, you mind if we talk?

258
00:17:52,044 --> 00:17:53,673
Yes. Of course.

259
00:17:53,785 --> 00:17:55,619
Please, browse away.

260
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,719
<i>Su casa es mi casa.</i>

261
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,749
Thank you. I sure will.

262
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,289
So...

263
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:04,289
Same deal, yeah?
Eleven-five?

264
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,629
- Yeah. Thank you.
- That’s 3D. Yeah.

265
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,380
Whatever happened
to that Black boy?

266
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:10,590
- He was good.
- Stop, stop.

267
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:14,469
- He was good.
- I actually wanted to

268
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,289
lay some groundwork...

269
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,517
to a pathway of-of...
buying some of them back.

270
00:18:19,604 --> 00:18:20,767
All right?

271
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,707
Yeah.

272
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,519
Yeah. Totally.

273
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:28,149
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

274
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,539
Actually,

275
00:18:29,705 --> 00:18:32,695
OJ, the offer I made your dad
is still on the table.

276
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,239
- Let me...
- Yo, wait a minute.

277
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,378
So,

278
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:39,033
that...

279
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:41,510
OJ, have I shown you this?

280
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,208
This is in reference
to the <i>Gordy’s Home</i> incident.

281
00:18:46,673 --> 00:18:48,618
<i>Gordy’s Home</i>.

282
00:18:48,738 --> 00:18:50,825
- Yeah, yeah.
- So, <i>Gordy’s Home</i>

283
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,898
is a short-lived but fabled sitcom

284
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:55,526
I starred in in ’96
after <i>Kid Sheriff</i> blew up.

285
00:18:55,606 --> 00:18:57,477
Yeah, my pops told me
about this show.

286
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,675
The monkey went crazy
or some shit.

287
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:01,082
You know,

288
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:03,392
I usually charge a fee for this.

289
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,229
Oh, damn.

290
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:09,231
Ta-da.

291
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,976
That’s the first
exploding fist bump.

292
00:19:18,082 --> 00:19:19,579
What? Really?

293
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,282
Y’all came up with that?

294
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:23,741
So, as I was saying,
<i>Gordy’s Home</i>

295
00:19:23,835 --> 00:19:26,850
began airing
in the fall of ’96...

296
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:28,959
and it was an immediate hit.

297
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:30,966
Ratings were huge.

298
00:19:31,073 --> 00:19:32,667
Pretty good reviews.

299
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:34,721
Just really took off.

300
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:35,969
Yeah.

301
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,876
Then...

302
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,019
one day...

303
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:45,055
we were shooting an episode
in season two, entitled...

304
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,615
“Gordy’s Birthday.”

305
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,020
And...

306
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:50,134
boom.

307
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:53,457
One of the chimps that plays Gordy just...

308
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:55,323
just hit his limit.

309
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:59,619
And it was six minutes and 13 seconds of havoc.

310
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:02,286
Network tried to bury hit, but...

311
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:03,505
it was a spectacle.

312
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:05,372
People are just obsessed.

313
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:06,749
You’re kidding me.

314
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:09,503
OJ, you said
you heard about that?

315
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:11,602
That’s why
they don’t let you use chimps.

316
00:20:11,696 --> 00:20:13,341
That’s part of the reason.

317
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,834
There’s a growing <i>Gordy’s Home</i>
fan base out there now.

318
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:19,969
This Dutch couple paid me 50K
to come in here and spend the night.

319
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,108
I didn’t ask.

320
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:23,438
That’s crazy.

321
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:28,853
So, what happened really, man?

322
00:20:32,656 --> 00:20:35,171
You haven’t seen
the Bad Gordy sketch on <i>SNL</i>?

323
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:37,997
I mean, they pretty much
nailed it better than I could.

324
00:20:38,758 --> 00:20:39,659
No?

325
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:42,173
<i>Saturday Night Live</i>?

326
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:44,369
Darrell Hammond as Tom.

327
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:47,023
Ana Gasteyer as Phyllis.

328
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:49,874
Cheri Oteri as Mary Jo Elliot.

329
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,646
Scott Wolf is the host.
He’s me.

330
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,875
But, of course,
the star of the sketch

331
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:57,747
is Chris goddamn Kattan
as Gordy,

332
00:20:57,829 --> 00:20:59,320
and he is...

333
00:21:00,163 --> 00:21:02,210
undeniable, okay?

334
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,763
Bit goes like this.

335
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,642
Everyone’s trying to celebrate
Gordy’s birthday,

336
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:10,478
but every time Gordy hears
something about the jungle...

337
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:14,060
Gordy – Kattan – goes...

338
00:21:14,194 --> 00:21:15,316
off.

339
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,621
And it’s...

340
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:18,036
it’s Kattan.

341
00:21:18,136 --> 00:21:20,321
He’s just crushing it.

342
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:22,406
He is a force of nature.

343
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,539
He is killing on that stage.

344
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,293
Yeah.

345
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:36,162
It’s legendary.

346
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:38,719
Legendary shit.

347
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:44,435
Yeah. Yeah, I’m gonna have to go ahead,
look that one up on YouTube.

348
00:21:44,506 --> 00:21:46,035
Details, you know?

349
00:21:46,209 --> 00:21:47,429
Totally.

350
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:53,099
I got some work I got to do.

351
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:56,578
So we ain’t gonna
chill tonight, nothing?

352
00:21:56,688 --> 00:21:58,937
- You want to work?
- Hell, no.

353
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,440
So, what was the offer?

354
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:07,326
- Jupe?
- Yeah.

355
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:10,068
He offered to buy the ranch.

356
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,645
Oh, really?

357
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,638
That’s interesting. How much?

358
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,038
Why?

359
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:16,794
’Cause...

360
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:20,005
I’m trying to see how big of a dumbass you are.

361
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:22,320
Big dumbass, probably.

362
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:41,449
So I guess you don’t want to see
what’s good with Dad liquor cabinet, then?!

363
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,829
I got that hobby weed, too,
actually.

364
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,828
That’s all you had to say, then.

365
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:56,393
The hobby weed.

366
00:22:56,499 --> 00:22:59,613
That’s all you had to say, just let me know.
You should’ve dropped that at the top.

367
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,072
“I got the hobby weed.”
You know I’m ready.

368
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:10,305
Okay, your reflexes
are still quick. Like, whoa.

369
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,849
- I ain’t mad at it.
- I’m watching.

370
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,939
To the man.

371
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,029
Drink.

372
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,031
Oh, shit.

373
00:23:28,265 --> 00:23:29,998
Remember Jean Jacket?

374
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:31,911
Yeah, good horse.

375
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,329
Supposed to be my first horse, actually.

376
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,534
I was just talking to my therapist
about this not too long ago.

377
00:23:38,612 --> 00:23:39,670
Therapist?

378
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:40,878
Yes.

379
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:43,299
I fuck one
on occasion sometimes.

380
00:23:45,127 --> 00:23:47,078
I was telling her that...

381
00:23:47,524 --> 00:23:51,162
for my ninth birthday,
I was supposed to get to train Jean Jacket.

382
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,809
But then Pops got some Western, and...

383
00:23:53,977 --> 00:23:55,479
Jean Jacket
wasn’t mine no more.

384
00:23:56,107 --> 00:23:57,947
Classic Otis Senior.

385
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,149
I distinctly remember...

386
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:06,236
standing right here at this window,
watching y’all train <i>my</i> horse.

387
00:24:06,854 --> 00:24:08,259
My horse.

388
00:24:10,142 --> 00:24:11,951
Pops never looked up at me.

389
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,126
Whoa, now.

390
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,330
Whoa, now. Whoa, now.

391
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:18,999
OJ, come on.

392
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,050
But <i>you</i> did, nigga.

393
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:29,972
Remember?

394
00:24:33,584 --> 00:24:35,924
It was <i>Scorpion King</i>, actually.

395
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,769
It wasn’t a Western.

396
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:41,733
That was the first job Pops took me on.

397
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,760
Wasn’t much fun.

398
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:47,649
Ended up using camels anyways, so...

399
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,115
The point is...

400
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,659
Yeah, fuck the point.

401
00:24:54,814 --> 00:24:56,988
Yo, that man was
hardheaded as fuck.

402
00:24:57,101 --> 00:24:58,580
And so are you.

403
00:24:59,268 --> 00:25:00,169
That’s it.

404
00:25:05,476 --> 00:25:07,236
But at the end of the day,
you got to--

405
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:09,248
you got to admit, man,
Pops...

406
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:15,944
Pops did something when he made this place.

407
00:25:17,063 --> 00:25:19,078
He changed the industry.

408
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:21,145
That’s real.

409
00:25:23,495 --> 00:25:25,465
I can’t just let that go.

410
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:29,776
Why is Ghost in the arena?

411
00:25:57,371 --> 00:25:58,891
What’s good?

412
00:26:04,682 --> 00:26:05,898
Yeah.

413
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:33,027
Hey, yo, Em. Em!

414
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,867
Turn it down!

415
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:37,136
All right!

416
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,313
Hey!

417
00:26:51,992 --> 00:26:53,690
Where he going?

418
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,765
<i>What if I...</i>

419
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:44,363
<i>What if I told you...</i>

420
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:49,352
<i>you’ll leave here... different?</i>

421
00:27:52,663 --> 00:27:55,399
<i>See, every Friday</i>

422
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,573
<i>for the last six months...</i>

423
00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:00,428
<i>my family and I</i>

424
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:02,435
<i>bore witness</i>

425
00:28:02,587 --> 00:28:04,852
<i>to an absolute</i>

426
00:28:04,928 --> 00:28:06,694
<i>spectacle.</i>

427
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:16,516
You see it? The power?

428
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:19,174
Where’s Ghost?

429
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:23,720
- I don’t know.
- Hold on.

430
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,905
Boom. Power went out.

431
00:29:33,435 --> 00:29:35,229
- See?
- Rewind.

432
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,308
Stop.

433
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:48,086
Ghost talking about, “I ain’t listening.
I’m not trained. I do whatever the fuck I want.”

434
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:50,539
What?

435
00:29:51,468 --> 00:29:52,798
What’d you see?

436
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,340
What’s a bad miracle?

437
00:30:07,102 --> 00:30:08,848
They got a word for that?

438
00:30:11,031 --> 00:30:12,384
Nope.

439
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,815
They said it was a prop plane or something
that killed Pops.

440
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:21,320
That shit ain’t never made sense to me.

441
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:24,259
Then tonight, I heard Ghost make a sound
I ain’t never heard a horse make.

442
00:30:24,352 --> 00:30:25,446
What did you see?

443
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,897
It was big.

444
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,663
- How big?
- Big.

445
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,249
- What’d it look like?
- I don’t know.

446
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,000
It was fast.

447
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,592
Too fast.

448
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,500
Too quiet to be a plane.

449
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,053
OJ.

450
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:51,933
Are you saying what I think you’re saying?

451
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,866
I’m telling you, man,
we don’t need a lot. We just need enough

452
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,174
to make our shit look different from what’s
out there. You get what I’m saying? Like...

453
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,775
You know I ain’t trying
to run it up.

454
00:31:05,851 --> 00:31:08,881
I just was looking online,
and I seen a lot of shit.

455
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:10,541
You know I’m broke, right?

456
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:12,418
We’ll use my money.

457
00:31:12,857 --> 00:31:14,359
Okay, shut up. Look.

458
00:31:14,454 --> 00:31:15,546
All right.

459
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,213
There it is.
5 to a 100K.

460
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,996
- Well, read it.
- You read it, dyslexic ass.

461
00:31:21,102 --> 00:31:24,116
The point is, a website like Cyber Dominion

462
00:31:24,243 --> 00:31:27,909
will pay 5 to a 100K for
photographic evidence of UFOs and shit.

463
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:29,429
A 100K?

464
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:32,432
And that’s just what I saw on the first go.

465
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,119
Now that I’m thinking about it,
fuck Cyber Dominion.

466
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:38,425
This shit right here is
a moment – our moment.

467
00:31:38,525 --> 00:31:40,416
We set it up,
release it the right way,

468
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:43,186
man, I’m talking
rich and famous for life.

469
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,879
How you doing? You look pretty.

470
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:46,865
- She look like she got a big house.
- How?

471
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:49,469
How what? How we put it out?
Well, that’s what I’m saying.

472
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:51,241
We don’t just go for
the quick cash-in, okay?

473
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:53,898
We go to the most credible
platform to do the story.

474
00:31:53,991 --> 00:31:55,635
- What’s that? Like <i>Oprah</i>?
- Yeah.

475
00:31:55,715 --> 00:31:58,142
Like <i>Oprah</i>, for example.
After that, everybody want in.

476
00:31:58,242 --> 00:32:00,443
Well, I’m saying there’s plenty
of videos of flying shit online.

477
00:32:00,524 --> 00:32:02,252
I saw one the other day.
That wasn’t on <i>Oprah</i>.

478
00:32:02,328 --> 00:32:05,500
Nigga, I didn’t say <i>Oprah</i>.
You said <i>Oprah</i>. You love <i>Oprah</i>.

479
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:07,995
Look, all I’m saying is
all that shit online is fake.

480
00:32:08,108 --> 00:32:10,436
Low quality. Ain’t nobody
gonna get what we gonna get.

481
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:12,164
- What we gonna get?
- The shot.

482
00:32:12,244 --> 00:32:13,251
What shot?

483
00:32:13,371 --> 00:32:15,277
The shot. The money shot.

484
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,523
Undeniable, singular, the...

485
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:19,224
the <i>Oprah</i> shot.

486
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:20,724
The <i>Oprah</i> shot?

487
00:32:20,891 --> 00:32:22,268
Excuse me.

488
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,109
Hi. I can help you over here.

489
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,847
Hi.

490
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:31,759
Thank you for shopping at Fry’s.

491
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,652
Did you guys find everything
you’re looking for today?

492
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:35,749
Yes... Angel.

493
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,369
Great.

494
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,839
- Actually, do you have a card with us?
- No, thank you.

495
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,339
- Would you like one? Because it--
- No, thank you.

496
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:47,370
Would you like one of our tech support
personnel to help you with the installation?

497
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,549
No, no, no, no, no, thank you.

498
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:51,219
Appreciate you.

499
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,722
All right,
no help with the install.

500
00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:56,307
Suit yourself.

501
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,105
Is it a hard install?

502
00:32:58,212 --> 00:32:59,519
Well, for me, no.

503
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,797
You’re not gonna be able to do it.

504
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:04,676
What happened?
Did you guys get robbed?

505
00:33:04,763 --> 00:33:05,965
Yeah, you know.

506
00:33:06,078 --> 00:33:07,348
A lot of blackouts.

507
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:09,195
Take the camera out
from time to time.

508
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:11,948
All these new cameras,
they have backup battery power, so...

509
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,449
you should be fine.

510
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,120
But the outages affect the power
in the battery shit, too, like cell phones.

511
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,881
Okay. All right. Cell phones,

512
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:24,133
they don’t just
drop in power. Right?

513
00:33:24,313 --> 00:33:27,503
I mean, maybe your Wi-Fi drops out
whenever your system dips.

514
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,867
So...

515
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,759
that’s technology.

516
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,929
Okay, or maybe
you’re in a UFO hot spot.

517
00:33:37,356 --> 00:33:39,249
No one believes in that.

518
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:49,960
What’s up?

519
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:51,358
Damn.

520
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:54,058
Did not realize you guys were this far out.

521
00:33:54,763 --> 00:33:56,183
I don’t mind, though.

522
00:33:56,443 --> 00:33:59,113
Smell of horse shit and fresh air.

523
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:00,784
Right?

524
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,579
- Look at me, man.
- Fuck.

525
00:34:07,657 --> 00:34:10,005
- Don’t do that. Don’t yell.
- Sorry, man.

526
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,389
Sorry if I was, like,
a little shut down this morning.

527
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:14,966
Just got out of
a four-year relationship.

528
00:34:15,106 --> 00:34:17,652
- You were fine.
- I know it’s gonna sound fucking cliché,

529
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:20,280
all right, but I thought
that she was the one, you know?

530
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:22,887
- Is this gonna take longer than an hour?
- This?

531
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:24,609
Oh, shit, yeah.

532
00:34:25,018 --> 00:34:27,077
- I’m-a go ahead and pop out.
- Where you going?

533
00:34:27,177 --> 00:34:30,798
I got to go to the store and get something.
Don’t worry about it. You need anything?

534
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,679
Yo.

535
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,416
Her name was Rebecca Diaz.

536
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:41,744
Yep, keep an eye out for her.

537
00:34:41,887 --> 00:34:44,424
She’s an actress, model, you know?

538
00:34:44,977 --> 00:34:47,548
She booked a pilot on The CW, so...

539
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:50,185
Yeah, fucking left me.

540
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:53,933
Yeah, fucking CW.

541
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,598
- So, thing about this camera--
- Actually, can it swivel up?

542
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,598
Yeah.

543
00:35:05,415 --> 00:35:07,299
- Boom.
- Little more?

544
00:35:07,662 --> 00:35:09,428
More. Okay.

545
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:15,530
Yeah.

546
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,951
Yeah.

547
00:35:35,985 --> 00:35:38,753
Do you know they don’t call ’em UFOs anymore?

548
00:35:41,325 --> 00:35:43,639
It’s fucking UAPs now.

549
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:47,479
Why they got to change the name?

550
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,821
Yeah.

551
00:35:49,011 --> 00:35:50,286
Exactly.

552
00:35:50,422 --> 00:35:53,748
No, fuck it. I’ll tell you why <i>they</i>
changed the name,

553
00:35:53,897 --> 00:35:56,449
all right? It’s ’cause
<i>they</i> want to keep us in the dark.

554
00:35:56,868 --> 00:36:00,918
Remember when they declassified all
that UFO footage a couple years ago?

555
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:03,199
Yeah. Well, people started
paying attention.

556
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,334
So they changed the name
to UAPs.

557
00:36:05,435 --> 00:36:07,789
And no one knows
what the fuck a UAP is,

558
00:36:08,304 --> 00:36:11,326
- so everyone lost interest.
- I saw that Navy clip.

559
00:36:12,114 --> 00:36:14,379
Couldn’t really see ’em, though.
Could’ve been better.

560
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:16,586
It’s shitty footage

561
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:20,759
of exact proof that there’s an
alien civilization out there in the universe.

562
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,472
So, who’s that?

563
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,785
Come on, man.
The little guys with the big eyes.

564
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:29,742
Yeah. There’s lots of theories.
Either they’re

565
00:36:29,905 --> 00:36:32,268
intergalactic travelers
looking for peace,

566
00:36:32,414 --> 00:36:34,589
or futuristic humans

567
00:36:34,703 --> 00:36:37,691
coming back in time
to stop us from destroying the planet,

568
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:40,870
or they’re fucking world killers.

569
00:36:41,317 --> 00:36:42,985
Planetary destroyers.

570
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:45,254
And that means that they’ve
been fucking watching us

571
00:36:45,347 --> 00:36:48,439
and studying us, waiting for
the perfect time to beam us up

572
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,306
and shove metal probes
up our fucking asses.

573
00:36:53,774 --> 00:36:55,027
Cool.

574
00:36:55,207 --> 00:36:56,219
Anyway,

575
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,727
<i>Ancient Aliens</i>, History Channel.
Watch that shit.

576
00:36:58,802 --> 00:36:59,839
Hey!

577
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,621
Hey!

578
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:03,555
Come on! Help a nigga out!

579
00:37:12,654 --> 00:37:13,479
Hey.

580
00:37:14,254 --> 00:37:17,029
Know where I could find me
a couple of big, strong fellas?

581
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:19,534
You good?

582
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:20,909
I’m good.

583
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,159
- What?
- What’s that?

584
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,093
Oh, this? You know, just

585
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,579
training horses we ordered
that I picked up.

586
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,999
- Where’d you get it from?
- Don’t worry about it.

587
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,709
Now, come on, help me out.

588
00:37:34,672 --> 00:37:36,004
Got you.

589
00:37:37,206 --> 00:37:38,631
Okay, so what is that?

590
00:37:38,725 --> 00:37:40,639
- Is it like bait?
- I told you.

591
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,139
- It is a decoy for horse training.
- Okay.

592
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,536
Shit.

593
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:49,012
- Shit.See?
- OJ.

594
00:37:49,272 --> 00:37:51,604
We good.
I mean, he don’t know shit.

595
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:53,979
Oh, no.
You guys are doing something shady.

596
00:37:57,699 --> 00:37:59,239
Hey, there!

597
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:00,810
Hey!

598
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,279
You can stay right there, though!

599
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:04,958
Sure!

600
00:38:05,424 --> 00:38:06,550
What’s up?

601
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:08,539
We’re setting up a decoy!

602
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,832
For horse training!

603
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,957
Oh, good!

604
00:38:13,927 --> 00:38:15,749
You know, we got some of those!

605
00:38:19,249 --> 00:38:21,629
- Where’d you get--
- Where’d you get yours?!

606
00:38:24,156 --> 00:38:25,110
Yeah--

607
00:38:25,323 --> 00:38:26,679
I’m not really sure!

608
00:38:27,106 --> 00:38:28,876
My wife would know!

609
00:38:30,328 --> 00:38:31,178
Okay!

610
00:38:31,294 --> 00:38:33,707
- Thanks for stopping by!
- Why the-- You don’t live here.

611
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:36,487
- Sorry. Trying to help.
- Sure thing!

612
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:41,110
Hey. I wanted to invite you to our

613
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:43,409
new family live show!

614
00:38:43,846 --> 00:38:46,046
Friday! At 5:00 p.m.!

615
00:38:46,153 --> 00:38:47,449
Okay!

616
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:52,369
Thumbs u-- thumbs up.

617
00:38:53,151 --> 00:38:55,539
- Should I do it?
- Yeah, do it.

618
00:38:56,569 --> 00:38:58,002
Thumbs up!

619
00:38:59,662 --> 00:39:01,882
And so,
the router’s in the shed.

620
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:04,638
I set it up so if the power
goes down on camera A,

621
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:08,599
camera B’s pointed at the sky to catch...
whatever might have taken it out.

622
00:39:09,004 --> 00:39:10,855
And vice versa, so...

623
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,308
Thank you.

624
00:39:14,764 --> 00:39:16,819
I mean, you’re really not gonna
tell me what the fuck is going on?

625
00:39:18,096 --> 00:39:19,979
You’ll know soon enough.

626
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:22,318
Cool, cryptic.

627
00:39:23,008 --> 00:39:23,989
Fucking dicks.

628
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,619
I can monitor the feeds remotely myself,
if you want. Free of charge.

629
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,409
- Hell no.
- No.

630
00:39:33,252 --> 00:39:35,438
Wham, bam, thank you, ma’am.

631
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,108
One more thing.

632
00:39:38,324 --> 00:39:40,181
You’ll be getting a call
from my supervisor

633
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,161
- asking how my service was.
- Five stars, Angel. Five stars.

634
00:39:43,267 --> 00:39:44,339
Thank you.

635
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:52,479
So, what now?

636
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:55,159
- I don’t know. What you want to do?
- Whatever you want to do.

637
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:58,146
Well, I got some work I got to do.
I’m gonna go out...

638
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,979
That’s a good one.

639
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,103
<i>I’m talking today
to women who say</i>

640
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:27,222
<i>they have been abducted
by aliens from another planet.</i>

641
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:30,264
<i>May I briefly say, I don’t know for a fact
that they’re from another planet.</i>

642
00:40:30,377 --> 00:40:33,465
<i>Well, you know you weren’t
in Kansas anymore, Toto.</i>

643
00:40:34,027 --> 00:40:35,293
<i>And I wasn’t
wearing red shoes</i>

644
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:37,307
<i>- that I could click together, either.
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

645
00:42:42,288 --> 00:42:44,360
Nope. Nope, I’m out.

646
00:42:44,401 --> 00:42:46,481
I’m going. Fuck this shit.

647
00:42:50,008 --> 00:42:52,236
Okay. Okay.

648
00:43:29,748 --> 00:43:32,568
- Oh, shit!
- Fuck off.

649
00:43:32,738 --> 00:43:34,088
Give us back our property.

650
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:37,154
- Don’t mess with Jupiter’s Claim!
- Come on.

651
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,049
What happened?

652
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,651
The Park kids.

653
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,229
Jupe’s sons.

654
00:43:45,346 --> 00:43:46,840
And they let
Clover out, man.

655
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:49,149
What?
They trying to prank Haywood?

656
00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:51,922
- It’s on!
- Hey. You stole their horse.

657
00:43:53,162 --> 00:43:54,299
Yeah.

658
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,180
- Hey.
- Shit.

659
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:28,546
What’s up, Nessie?

660
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:32,169
Not much. Just stocking shit.
You know, pretty much regular.

661
00:45:02,348 --> 00:45:03,826
Oh, shit!

662
00:45:16,929 --> 00:45:18,868
I need to take my ass to bed.

663
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:26,059
- Who this?
<i>- Yo, it’s Angel from Fry’s.</i>

664
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,908
Just calling to tell you that
there is a bug on camera A.

665
00:45:29,075 --> 00:45:31,290
<i>I know. Wait, I thought
I told you not to watch our shit.</i>

666
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:32,439
Yeah, I know, I know.

667
00:45:33,011 --> 00:45:34,966
<i>- Camera B is down.</i>
- What?

668
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,395
<i>Camera B is down.</i>

669
00:45:37,741 --> 00:45:40,452
<i>Like</i> Ancient-fucking-Aliens <i>down.</i>

670
00:46:53,426 --> 00:46:55,139
- Hey!
<i>- Hey. Hi.</i>

671
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:58,649
Emerald, can you please
get the bug off the thing?

672
00:46:58,998 --> 00:47:01,874
Get the bug off the fucking thing!

673
00:47:04,014 --> 00:47:05,199
Shit.

674
00:47:16,357 --> 00:47:18,443
<i>What do you see?
Do you see, like, lights</i>

675
00:47:18,523 --> 00:47:21,270
<i>or anything?
Like, a fucking saucer?</i>

676
00:47:21,857 --> 00:47:23,329
It’s in the cloud.

677
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:25,503
It’s in the cloud. OJ!

678
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:27,417
It’s in the cloud!

679
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:38,848
Yeah, nah, nah, nah.

680
00:47:38,953 --> 00:47:41,303
Run, OJ! Run!

681
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:49,800
Shit.

682
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,659
Hello?

683
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,409
What happened to OJ?

684
00:48:37,383 --> 00:48:38,833
It’s fine.

685
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:41,129
Come on.

686
00:48:44,275 --> 00:48:46,129
Okay, it’s still on.

687
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:48,469
The camera, it’s still on.

688
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:03,304
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

689
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:07,974
Okay, you fucking praying mantis.

690
00:49:08,094 --> 00:49:10,827
All right, bitch.
You like Sour Patch Kids?

691
00:50:34,237 --> 00:50:35,706
A’ight, man.

692
00:50:35,868 --> 00:50:37,785
Where your shit? Let’s go.

693
00:50:39,265 --> 00:50:41,865
- Haven’t seen one of those in a minute.
- Fucking praying mantis.

694
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,559
That motherfucker better pray I don’t
ever see him, ’cause if I do, I’m-a eat him.

695
00:50:46,742 --> 00:50:48,510
- Let’s go.
- Where?

696
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,045
Man, I don’t know.

697
00:50:50,107 --> 00:50:53,453
I got me a little situation in Atwater
texting me back right now.

698
00:50:53,529 --> 00:50:56,136
- It’s not coming again tonight.
- I don’t care.

699
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:58,430
No. No.

700
00:50:59,031 --> 00:51:00,266
No.

701
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:01,957
Bro,

702
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:05,216
I ain’t never seen no shit like this.

703
00:51:05,303 --> 00:51:06,569
It ain’t worth it.

704
00:51:06,669 --> 00:51:09,169
No, nope. It’s too much.

705
00:51:09,362 --> 00:51:11,026
You should go, then.

706
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,101
I got to get up early anyway.

707
00:51:16,266 --> 00:51:18,242
I got mouths to feed.

708
00:51:29,938 --> 00:51:31,505
Shit.

709
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,091
Shit, shit, shit!

710
00:51:54,585 --> 00:51:56,187
You hear that?

711
00:52:03,729 --> 00:52:05,749
Ghost out there.

712
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,586
Acting all territorial.

713
00:52:16,824 --> 00:52:19,719
I guess some animals
ain’t fit to be trained.

714
00:52:40,556 --> 00:52:41,896
- Hello?
<i>- Hi.</i>

715
00:52:41,989 --> 00:52:44,342
<i>Is this... Antlers Holst?</i>

716
00:52:45,981 --> 00:52:47,039
Who’s this?

717
00:52:47,428 --> 00:52:49,295
Hey, yeah. I’m Emerald Haywood.

718
00:52:49,388 --> 00:52:52,105
We met a couple days ago at the commercial.

719
00:52:52,231 --> 00:52:54,613
<i>Oh, yeah, horse girl. Sure.</i>

720
00:52:54,706 --> 00:52:56,832
<i>I remember you and your brother.</i>

721
00:52:56,979 --> 00:52:58,679
Yeah, horse boy.

722
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,347
He’s here, too.

723
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,389
<i>- The descendants of the jockey.</i>
- Yeah.

724
00:53:03,898 --> 00:53:07,065
<i>Guess I’m talking to
motion picture royalty, then.</i>

725
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:10,073
<i>How’d you get the number?</i>

726
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:12,378
I got it from the call sheet.

727
00:53:12,419 --> 00:53:14,739
So, we have a project, and

728
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,033
<i>you know, what if I told you
it was the offer of a lifetime?</i>

729
00:53:18,166 --> 00:53:20,949
Yeah, hopefully not <i>my</i> lifetime.

730
00:53:21,623 --> 00:53:23,698
That’s a good one.
I’m-a be real with you.

731
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:25,981
We don’t have a lot of money
to pay you up front.

732
00:53:26,068 --> 00:53:28,667
You know, not like
you’re used to, but...

733
00:53:28,745 --> 00:53:32,315
<i>Yeah. I tend to do one for them
so I can do one for me,</i>

734
00:53:32,422 --> 00:53:34,586
<i>so, what is it?</i>

735
00:53:35,607 --> 00:53:38,656
- Reality.
<i>- Oh, no. Reality.</i>

736
00:53:38,774 --> 00:53:40,561
Documentary.

737
00:53:40,754 --> 00:53:42,341
Doc-- Documentary.

738
00:53:42,434 --> 00:53:44,346
<i>Oh, that’s better.</i>

739
00:53:44,801 --> 00:53:47,307
<i>So, again, what’s it about?</i>

740
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:50,269
It’s about the shit
dreams is made of, baby.

741
00:53:51,196 --> 00:53:53,399
<i>Listen, horse girl.</i>

742
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,107
I got a...

743
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,970
pretty damn superb lemon tart in the oven
I’m about to serve

744
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,869
<i>to ten of my closest friends, so...</i>

745
00:54:03,826 --> 00:54:06,436
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Oh, hold on one second.

746
00:54:06,569 --> 00:54:08,449
- What?
- He’s not here for that.

747
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,272
<i>- Look, no. This is what I do.
- Don’t be cute. Stick to the plan.</i>

748
00:54:10,358 --> 00:54:11,872
<i>- I don’t go to your job and knock a horse’s...
- Say it!</i>

749
00:54:11,952 --> 00:54:13,539
<i>...dick out your damn hand.</i>

750
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,774
- Hello?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

751
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,419
Yeah, my bad.
We good, man.

752
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,629
According to <i>American Cinema</i> magazine,

753
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,491
<i>you make the cinematically impossible....</i>

754
00:54:23,604 --> 00:54:25,164
<i>possible.</i>

755
00:54:25,337 --> 00:54:26,351
<i>Well,</i>

756
00:54:26,457 --> 00:54:28,429
<i>we looking for the impossible shot.</i>

757
00:54:32,571 --> 00:54:34,301
That’s impossible.

758
00:54:34,414 --> 00:54:35,734
<i>Antlers.</i>

759
00:54:36,352 --> 00:54:38,808
There’s something out here
in Agua Dulce,

760
00:54:38,935 --> 00:54:42,613
and you’re probably the only person
in the world that can get it on film.

761
00:54:43,305 --> 00:54:44,865
That’s it.

762
00:54:46,171 --> 00:54:47,717
<i>Horse girl,</i>

763
00:54:48,044 --> 00:54:50,909
<i>this dream you’re chasing.</i>

764
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:54,613
<i>The one where you end up
at the top of the mountain,</i>

765
00:54:54,785 --> 00:54:57,326
<i>all eyes on you...</i>

766
00:55:00,299 --> 00:55:03,222
It’s the dream you never wake up from.

767
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,979
I don’t like him.

768
00:55:42,198 --> 00:55:44,239
Holy shit. It’s real.

769
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,922
I don’t know what you’re doing here, but...

770
00:55:48,642 --> 00:55:50,764
it was illegal for you to...

771
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,809
spy on us like that.

772
00:55:59,595 --> 00:56:00,835
Wait, you--

773
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,734
You don’t know?

774
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:07,168
Okay, tell me when you see it.

775
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:18,039
There.

776
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,461
- Doesn’t move.
- Exactly.

777
00:56:24,561 --> 00:56:26,529
Well, look at that.

778
00:56:28,111 --> 00:56:30,095
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay.

779
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,808
I went back
and scrubbed through the footage,

780
00:56:32,909 --> 00:56:34,688
and that cloud
has been right there

781
00:56:34,795 --> 00:56:36,546
at least since
I set the cameras up.

782
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:38,478
Yeah, now you mention it,

783
00:56:38,598 --> 00:56:42,184
I’ve probably been looking at the same
damn cloud every day for the last six months.

784
00:56:42,304 --> 00:56:43,692
Shit.

785
00:56:44,621 --> 00:56:46,562
So, I mean,
that’s them in there.

786
00:56:46,635 --> 00:56:48,602
And we’ve been recording it,
so we got it.

787
00:56:48,725 --> 00:56:50,029
Right?

788
00:56:51,393 --> 00:56:52,868
Yeah.

789
00:56:53,846 --> 00:56:56,038
Why you saying “yeah” like that?

790
00:56:56,781 --> 00:56:59,075
I mean, we have proof of aliens
on video. I...

791
00:56:59,175 --> 00:57:01,115
Yeah, I wouldn’t call it proof.

792
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:02,350
Are you serious?

793
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,474
Look, I’ve seen crazy weather phenomenons
online before. That’s all I’m saying.

794
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:06,954
He’s right.

795
00:57:07,401 --> 00:57:10,099
It’s good, but it ain’t it. Ain’t <i>Oprah</i>.

796
00:57:11,844 --> 00:57:13,347
Ain’t <i>Oprah</i>.

797
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,068
Okay.

798
00:57:17,428 --> 00:57:19,353
Are you guys telling me

799
00:57:19,775 --> 00:57:22,064
that there’s an alien spaceship...

800
00:57:23,056 --> 00:57:25,130
in that fucking cloud right there?

801
00:57:25,251 --> 00:57:27,630
It doesn’t move like a ship.

802
00:57:28,975 --> 00:57:30,812
What you mean, OJ?

803
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,699
What if it’s not a ship?

804
00:57:40,025 --> 00:57:42,287
<i>All right, Gordy, we’re almost ready, buddy.</i>

805
00:57:42,328 --> 00:57:44,236
Here we go, buddy. Come on.

806
00:57:44,916 --> 00:57:46,478
- He’s ready.
- Set.

807
00:57:46,851 --> 00:57:48,305
Here we go.

808
00:57:48,403 --> 00:57:49,644
And... action.

809
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,901
And, of course,
I set it to Icelandic time

810
00:57:51,994 --> 00:57:54,838
because we share a love
of the aurora borealis, Gordy.

811
00:57:54,931 --> 00:57:58,769
And you have no idea how to tell time.

812
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:00,985
Great gift, Dad.

813
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:02,830
Way to think things through.

814
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:06,176
Somehow, you’d think
that a man who can send a rocket into space

815
00:58:06,223 --> 00:58:08,949
would be able to manage
a halfway decent birthday present.

816
00:58:09,454 --> 00:58:10,817
Nope.

817
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,903
You know, Gordy, all things considered,

818
00:58:15,989 --> 00:58:18,787
maybe my gift isn’t so bad after all.

819
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,998
Hey, Gordy.

820
00:58:22,354 --> 00:58:23,494
Surprise!

821
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:25,836
Now, that is a gift.

822
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,412
Oh. Sorry. My--

823
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,825
That’s all right.
Pick it up from there.

824
00:58:39,252 --> 00:58:40,450
Wait a minute.

825
00:58:40,586 --> 00:58:43,519
What happened to
we both failed at finding good presents?

826
00:58:46,783 --> 00:58:50,109
Here you go, Gordy. Happy birthday.

827
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,406
Oh, beautiful, Hayley.

828
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:02,799
<i>Whoa, hey, hey, hey. No.</i>

829
00:59:02,912 --> 00:59:05,005
<i>- No, no! Down! Down! Gordy!
- Down!</i>

830
00:59:05,061 --> 00:59:07,461
<i>- No. Stop!
- Stop that!</i>

831
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,643
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

832
01:00:43,737 --> 01:00:46,283
No, no, no, no, no.
No, Gordy, no! No!

833
01:00:46,363 --> 01:00:49,649
Down! Down! You sit! Down.

834
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,149
No, no, no.

835
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,152
No, no, no!

836
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:57,032
No, Gordy!

837
01:00:58,572 --> 01:00:59,540
Stop!

838
01:00:59,598 --> 01:01:01,449
No! No!

839
01:03:01,042 --> 01:03:03,676
Seven just on scene-- Oh, my God.

840
01:03:55,528 --> 01:03:57,000
Feeling good?

841
01:03:57,134 --> 01:03:58,251
Yeah.

842
01:03:58,867 --> 01:04:00,054
Feeling good.

843
01:04:00,147 --> 01:04:01,379
Good.

844
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:08,397
There we go.

845
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,184
Run it.

846
01:04:12,257 --> 01:04:13,884
Run it one more time, babe.

847
01:04:13,973 --> 01:04:15,134
Okay.

848
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:23,859
“What if I told you...”

849
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:39,101
Yo.

850
01:04:39,455 --> 01:04:41,408
It’s-- Storm’s coming.

851
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:44,172
Just tarping up, just to be safe.

852
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,807
Hey, where you going?

853
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:07,320
I’m-a get Lucky.

854
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,619
<i>Now, we’re not gonna let a few</i>

855
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,356
clouds kill our fun today, are we, folks?

856
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:14,494
So, without further ado,

857
01:05:14,602 --> 01:05:18,578
welcome to the Jupiter’s Claim
Star Lasso Experience!

858
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,709
How’s everyone feeling today?

859
01:05:25,156 --> 01:05:26,519
All right.

860
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:29,008
It’s quite a doozy today.

861
01:05:29,762 --> 01:05:32,300
I want to thank you guys
for coming out here.

862
01:05:32,549 --> 01:05:33,582
But first,

863
01:05:33,715 --> 01:05:36,679
how about another round of applause
for my Amber?

864
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,275
I’ll tell you, that woman is a saint

865
01:05:39,415 --> 01:05:41,769
for putting up with all my craziness.

866
01:05:42,157 --> 01:05:46,234
And to the knuckleheads up there.
The staff. Shout-out.

867
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:49,068
All right, all right. That’s enough.

868
01:05:50,001 --> 01:05:52,546
I also want to give a special thanks to

869
01:05:52,726 --> 01:05:56,439
an old costar of mine – and my first crush –

870
01:05:56,684 --> 01:05:58,289
Mary Jo Elliott, everyone!

871
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,919
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

872
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,089
All right.

873
01:06:06,468 --> 01:06:07,629
You ready?

874
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,148
Oh, come on. That ain’t nothing.
Are you ready?!

875
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,099
Here we go.

876
01:06:24,717 --> 01:06:26,191
You’re chosen.

877
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:37,625
What if I told you...

878
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,580
that in about an hour...

879
01:06:41,326 --> 01:06:42,944
you’ll leave here...

880
01:06:43,081 --> 01:06:44,417
different?

881
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,859
See,

882
01:06:46,974 --> 01:06:48,428
every Friday

883
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:50,505
for the last six months,

884
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:53,973
my family and I have bore witness

885
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,938
to an absolute...

886
01:06:56,055 --> 01:06:57,809
spectacle.

887
01:06:58,755 --> 01:07:01,684
One that you’ll be seeing here today.

888
01:07:03,268 --> 01:07:05,609
So let me take you back
to that first night.

889
01:07:15,537 --> 01:07:18,117
Right here in this exact spot,

890
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:21,288
I’d come over to
wrangle a chestnut horse

891
01:07:21,368 --> 01:07:22,749
named Trigger.

892
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:24,298
Now,

893
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:27,911
I could barely see my hand
in front of my face for the fog,

894
01:07:28,464 --> 01:07:29,879
but I swear

895
01:07:30,221 --> 01:07:31,511
on my wife

896
01:07:31,698 --> 01:07:33,379
and children’s lives

897
01:07:34,005 --> 01:07:36,193
that at 6:13 p.m.,

898
01:07:37,034 --> 01:07:38,471
I see...

899
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:41,933
a flying saucer

900
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:44,295
descend through the mist.

901
01:07:45,354 --> 01:07:48,671
Old Trigger took off straight into the gulch.

902
01:07:49,004 --> 01:07:49,899
And, well...

903
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,489
it’s like he was going home.

904
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,329
Now, just to be clear,

905
01:08:01,957 --> 01:08:03,358
what we saw

906
01:08:03,665 --> 01:08:07,054
was a flying saucer. No doubt about that.

907
01:08:07,298 --> 01:08:08,839
Slightly flatter
in the front,

908
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:13,299
with a circular hole in the bottom
about two school bus lengths wide.

909
01:08:13,978 --> 01:08:16,301
Ladies and gentlemen, I kid you not.

910
01:08:18,325 --> 01:08:20,186
We are being surveilled

911
01:08:20,318 --> 01:08:21,974
by an alien species

912
01:08:22,085 --> 01:08:23,639
I call “the Viewers”.

913
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:27,519
And though they have yet
to emerge from their ship,

914
01:08:28,174 --> 01:08:30,343
I believe they trust me.

915
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:31,649
If they didn’t,

916
01:08:32,343 --> 01:08:35,130
I don’t think any of us
would be here right now.

917
01:08:36,884 --> 01:08:38,488
So, as I said,

918
01:08:38,835 --> 01:08:40,839
in just under an hour,

919
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,684
Star Lasso Experience...

920
01:08:44,235 --> 01:08:46,372
is gonna change you.

921
01:08:48,156 --> 01:08:52,209
But first, my boys are gonna come out and do a
little number for us. Would that be all right?

922
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,981
Hustle. Go, go, go.

923
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:57,448
All right.
My little satellites: Colton, Phoenix, Max.

924
01:08:57,542 --> 01:08:59,187
Remember those names, folks.

925
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:00,719
All right, here we go!

926
01:09:11,283 --> 01:09:12,838
What is that?

927
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,005
Do you guys see that?

928
01:09:29,751 --> 01:09:31,749
Stay in your seats.

929
01:09:32,517 --> 01:09:33,709
This is new.

930
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,380
They’re early.

931
01:09:36,184 --> 01:09:39,299
- They’re giving us a real show today.
- That they are.

932
01:09:39,386 --> 01:09:41,389
- They’re giving us a real show today.
- Yeah.

933
01:09:41,754 --> 01:09:43,930
They’re ready, we’re ready.

934
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,706
<i>Welcome to the Star Lasso Experience,</i>

01:09:57,853 --> 01:10:00,063
- Come on!
- Bear with us now.

01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,409

941
01:10:08,586 --> 01:10:09,999

01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:52,821
<i>That’s right. Happy trails.</i>

947
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:54,458
<i>It’s closing time.</i>

950
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,125

959
01:13:37,515 --> 01:13:38,878
Lucky.

960
01:13:47,129 --> 01:13:48,335
Lucky.

961
01:13:53,209 --> 01:13:55,389
Lucky, come on, come on. Come on!

962
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:15,076
Come on, come on. Lucky.

963
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:28,703
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

964
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:15,764
Yo.

965
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,331
It’s done.

966
01:15:17,489 --> 01:15:20,719
All right, I’ll be over in the morning to tear
that shit off. Or you can do it yourselves.

967
01:15:20,802 --> 01:15:23,594
- It’s all the same.
- No, no. I like when you do it.

968
01:15:23,714 --> 01:15:25,855
Of course you do. All right.

969
01:15:25,947 --> 01:15:27,940
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

970
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:37,783
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.

971
01:15:37,894 --> 01:15:40,183
Come on, come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up.

972
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:58,130
<i>Did you know
that the very first assembly of photographs</i>

973
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:00,176
<i>in sequential order,
to make a motion picture,</i>

974
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,705
<i>was a two-second clip
of a Black man on a horse?</i>

975
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,590
<i>That man was a Bahamian jockey
known as Alistair E. Haywood,</i>

976
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:08,584
<i>and he was
my great-great-grandfather.</i>

977
01:16:08,691 --> 01:16:09,925
- Hey.
<i>- Em.</i>

978
01:16:10,058 --> 01:16:11,496
<i>I was right.</i>

979
01:16:11,637 --> 01:16:13,360
<i>It’s not a ship.</i>

980
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:14,819
What happened?

981
01:16:23,177 --> 01:16:24,752
What the fuck?

982
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:39,900
Shit.

983
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,208
It ate them, Em.

984
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:45,849
It ate them all.

985
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:47,227
<i>It’s alive, Em.</i>

986
01:16:47,295 --> 01:16:48,507
<i>It’s an animal.</i>

987
01:16:48,614 --> 01:16:49,861
<i>It’s territorial,</i>

988
01:16:49,982 --> 01:16:52,741
<i>and it thinks that</i> this <i>is its home.</i>

989
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:56,570
Em!

990
01:17:02,459 --> 01:17:03,911
Oh, fuck.

991
01:17:04,561 --> 01:17:06,172
Oh, shit.

992
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:08,874
Ooh, yes.

993
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:11,855
Hey, hey. We’re in trouble.

994
01:17:11,988 --> 01:17:13,188
Okay?

995
01:17:13,605 --> 01:17:15,214
Oh, fuck.

996
01:17:15,575 --> 01:17:16,977
Shit.

997
01:17:24,394 --> 01:17:25,724
What?

998
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,176
What the fuck?

999
01:17:51,003 --> 01:17:52,083
What the fuck?

1000
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:56,372
Who the hell is that?

1001
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,144
Who the hell is that?

1002
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,346
Em!

1003
01:18:01,502 --> 01:18:03,242
- Who the hell is that?
- Fuck.

1004
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:09,101
It’s above us.

1005
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,732
Ah, shit!

1006
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:20,821
Shit.

1007
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:23,529
Oh, shit! What the fuck?

1008
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:45,554
Oh, God.

1009
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:48,345
Something very bad is happening.

1010
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:01,997
Fuck!

1011
01:19:18,632 --> 01:19:19,879
Yeah, we’re fucked.

1012
01:21:30,035 --> 01:21:31,290
Nope.

1013
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:42,351
- Em. OJ’s coming.
- Let’s go.

1014
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:46,772
Got to get out this house.
I got to get out this house.

1015
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:49,542
- No, stop. Can’t we just wait, right?
<i>- You</i> can.

1016
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:52,194
- No, I’m not gonna be here alone. No.
- I’ve got to get out this fucking house!

1017
01:23:52,269 --> 01:23:53,699
We’re alive still
because we stayed here.

1018
01:25:04,726 --> 01:25:05,892
Go!

1019
01:25:05,988 --> 01:25:07,553
- Come on.
- Go!

1020
01:25:07,913 --> 01:25:09,104
Come on.

1021
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:12,906
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1022
01:25:19,950 --> 01:25:21,193
Go.

1023
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,921
Yeah, she... she gonna make it.

1024
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,169
- OJ.
- She gonna make it.

1025
01:25:30,575 --> 01:25:32,850
- Oh, hey, horsie.
- Hey, don’t look him in the eyes, please.

1026
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,339
VFX!

1027
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:50,149
Focus here. Focus here.

1028
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:51,897
Come on.

1029
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:56,193
Go!

1030
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:18,590
<i>Welcome to my tavern.</i>

1031
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:21,943
<i>I don’t know if you’ve heard,
but a terrible beast is about.</i>

1032
01:26:22,075 --> 01:26:23,636
<i>It’s been harassing villagers,</i>

1033
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,416
<i>ruining crops
and eating their livestock.</i>

1034
01:26:28,953 --> 01:26:32,695
<i>Many a glory-seeking hunter</i>

1035
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:35,301
<i>has attempted to defeat it,</i>

1036
01:26:35,388 --> 01:26:38,035
<i>and just as many have perished.</i>

1037
01:26:38,135 --> 01:26:40,563
<i>While you’re here... While you’re here...</i>

1038
01:26:40,643 --> 01:26:43,403
<i>While you’re here, please look around.</i>

1039
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:48,830
I’m here in Agua Dulce, California,

1040
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:51,197
and the whereabouts of
those 40 guests and

1041
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:54,622
<i>employees of a local Western theme park
are still unknown.</i>

1042
01:26:54,743 --> 01:26:56,629
<i>The sheriff’s office
has had its hands full</i>

1043
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:58,937
<i>trying to identify
the unaccounted for.</i>

1044
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:01,454
<i>Until they do, only one thing is certain.</i>

1045
01:27:01,554 --> 01:27:04,549
<i>There is something strange
happening out here in Agua Dulce.</i>

1046
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:06,308
<i>Security cameras
were off at the time.</i>

1047
01:27:06,401 --> 01:27:10,027
<i>Other than that,
we have no reason to suspect foul play.</i>

1048
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:13,015
<i>We did have a considerable amount
of rain come through here,</i>

1049
01:27:13,182 --> 01:27:16,743
<i>we don’t want to rule out flash flooding
as possibly having played a part.</i>

1050
01:27:16,857 --> 01:27:18,029
<i>We’re obviously...</i>

1051
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:25,145
You never go wrong with a fried fish sandwich.

1052
01:27:28,023 --> 01:27:30,091
Tartar got tang.

1053
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:33,410
Stupid.

1054
01:27:33,656 --> 01:27:35,203
“Tartar got tang”?

1055
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,543
Right?

1056
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:41,154
I don’t think it eats you
if you don’t look it in the eye.

1057
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:46,091
Hey, hey!

1058
01:27:46,351 --> 01:27:48,054
RTR, bro.

1059
01:27:49,018 --> 01:27:50,432
You know?

1060
01:27:51,731 --> 01:27:53,852
Like, read the room.

1061
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:00,148
Nobody want to talk about that.

1062
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:03,338
- Let’s go!
- Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

1063
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:05,006
All right, all right.

1064
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:07,783
Hey, you lucky!

1065
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:09,369
<i>Every animal got rules.</i>

1066
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:11,336
All right? We know what it wants,

1067
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:13,069
and we know how it comes, so...

1068
01:28:13,169 --> 01:28:14,504
Fuck.

1069
01:28:14,942 --> 01:28:17,125
We don’t really know shit.

1070
01:28:18,427 --> 01:28:20,587
OJ, what’s this about, man?

1071
01:28:21,398 --> 01:28:23,905
What’s this about?
You want me to-- You want me to say,

1072
01:28:24,145 --> 01:28:25,443
“I’m sorry”?

1073
01:28:25,583 --> 01:28:27,110
“I was wrong”?
“It’s dumb”?

1074
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:28,636
It wasn’t dumb.

1075
01:28:28,876 --> 01:28:30,059
- Own the moment.
- Stop.

1076
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,063
- It was good. It was good.
- Stop this shit.

1077
01:28:32,163 --> 01:28:34,097
But the moment about to pass.

1078
01:28:34,223 --> 01:28:35,747
And we don’t own shit.

1079
01:28:40,503 --> 01:28:43,750
Okay. Well, I assume
y’all are crashing at mine.

1080
01:28:44,043 --> 01:28:45,609
Right, ’cause you can.

1081
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:47,749
’Cause I’m not going back to the fucking

1082
01:28:47,856 --> 01:28:49,449
monster umbrella.

1083
01:28:49,972 --> 01:28:51,451
Got to feed ’em.

1084
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:54,370
Let Lucky out.

1085
01:28:56,297 --> 01:28:57,579
There’s shit to do.

1086
01:28:57,916 --> 01:28:59,284
Always.

1087
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:02,478
Always some shit to do.

1088
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:52,137
There’s a wheelchair on your roof.

1089
01:29:53,004 --> 01:29:54,188
Hi.

1090
01:29:54,584 --> 01:29:58,044
That cloud ain’t moved a goddamn inch.

1091
01:29:58,241 --> 01:30:00,479
So you’re not completely full of shit.

1092
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:03,940
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Thank you.

1093
01:30:04,981 --> 01:30:08,407
The concept of extraterrestrial animals
in the sky...

1094
01:30:08,567 --> 01:30:11,970
is not a new thing. You know, people been
trying to get pictures of these things since,

1095
01:30:12,090 --> 01:30:15,290
- like, the ’50s. You know, it’s an ancient--
- How do we see it?

1096
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,659
It’s gonna get hungry again.

1097
01:30:19,518 --> 01:30:21,146
So, you know,

1098
01:30:21,511 --> 01:30:23,332
just ring the dinner bell.

1099
01:30:28,929 --> 01:30:31,259
Now, we know what it <i>doesn’t</i> like.

1100
01:30:31,688 --> 01:30:34,815
That little fake horse and flags
messed it up good.

1101
01:30:35,854 --> 01:30:38,423
Got stuck in its windpipe or something.

1102
01:30:39,364 --> 01:30:42,357
I bet it ain’t gonna fuck with
flags like that in a minute.

1103
01:30:42,483 --> 01:30:43,723
Yeah.

1104
01:30:44,829 --> 01:30:45,959
We pissed him off.

1105
01:30:46,045 --> 01:30:48,711
We’re not the reason it settled down here.

1106
01:30:48,918 --> 01:30:50,495
That was Jupe.

1107
01:30:50,737 --> 01:30:52,569
He got caught up
trying to tame a predator.

1108
01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:54,049
You can’t do that.

1109
01:30:54,128 --> 01:30:56,022
You got to enter
an agreement with one.

1110
01:30:56,116 --> 01:30:57,409
Yeah.

1111
01:30:57,450 --> 01:30:59,467
Ask Siegfried and Roy.

1112
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:03,449
Okay.

1113
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:05,712
Asking as

1114
01:31:05,832 --> 01:31:08,611
someone who was in the house
when the shit went down...

1115
01:31:09,926 --> 01:31:13,690
How exactly do you
“enter an agreement” with a fucking...

1116
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:16,264
a UFO, alien entity,

1117
01:31:16,378 --> 01:31:18,889
- or whatever the hell you want to call it?
- Jean Jacket.

1118
01:31:19,358 --> 01:31:20,780
Call him Jean Jacket.

1119
01:31:21,186 --> 01:31:23,561
So, how about this?
How about we...

1120
01:31:23,942 --> 01:31:27,075
send ol’ Jean Jacket
some fresh horses in golden hour

1121
01:31:27,175 --> 01:31:28,739
and see what happens?

1122
01:31:29,952 --> 01:31:31,491
Horse people.

1123
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:34,896
- Why not just set them free?
- We’re not doing that.

1124
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:36,157
Okay.

1125
01:31:37,884 --> 01:31:39,657
Who is gonna go

1126
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:41,171
down there...

1127
01:31:41,731 --> 01:31:44,512
and get the star out of his trailer?

1128
01:31:46,623 --> 01:31:47,794
Me.

1129
01:31:50,092 --> 01:31:51,719
I’ll get him out.

1130
01:31:53,558 --> 01:31:55,139
Where you want it?

1131
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:57,599
You draw him out there.

1132
01:31:59,241 --> 01:32:00,780
I’m here.

1133
01:32:01,195 --> 01:32:02,729
On this ridge.

1134
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:05,559
Oh, shit.

1135
01:32:07,234 --> 01:32:08,606
Made her myself.

1136
01:32:08,701 --> 01:32:10,275
No electricity.

1137
01:32:10,462 --> 01:32:14,642
Didn’t I tell you this motherfucker was gonna
come up here with a non-electrical camera?

1138
01:32:14,742 --> 01:32:16,492
Let’s go, boy!

1139
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:17,949
Yeah!

1140
01:32:19,329 --> 01:32:21,369
I’ve been up under it
a couple times now.

1141
01:32:22,302 --> 01:32:23,329
I get him.

1142
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:26,041
<i>It’s an animal.</i>

1143
01:32:26,257 --> 01:32:27,999
<i>You don’t turn your back
on a bear.</i>

1144
01:32:28,523 --> 01:32:31,299
<i>You don’t wear red around a bull.
It’s like that.</i>

1145
01:32:32,015 --> 01:32:35,303
<i>You don’t look at it...
unless you want its attention.</i>

1146
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:38,969
Good night, Mr. Storeman.

1147
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:41,415
Fuck it. I call top hat.

1148
01:32:42,472 --> 01:32:43,811
<i>And we ain’t got
a lot of time.</i>

1149
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,599
<i>One day.</i>

1150
01:32:46,789 --> 01:32:48,813
<i>Two days, tops.</i>

1151
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:52,707
<i>’Cause the word is getting out,</i>

1152
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:53,989
<i>and when it does...</i>

1153
01:32:54,030 --> 01:32:55,773
Sorry, dead people.

1154
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:57,246
Park’s closed.

1155
01:32:57,340 --> 01:33:01,119
<i>...you know people gonna come
and do what they always do:</i>

1156
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:03,244
<i>try and take it all
for themselves.</i>

1157
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:05,121
Fine.

1158
01:33:05,684 --> 01:33:07,039
Thimble.

1159
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:09,499
That’s the one I wanted anyway.

1160
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:13,588
<i>Well, let ’em come.</i>

1161
01:33:14,491 --> 01:33:15,969
<i>It ain’t gonna matter.</i>

1162
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:20,929
<i>’Cause what we about to do...</i>

1163
01:33:23,573 --> 01:33:25,309
<i>they can’t erase that.</i>

1164
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:33,468
He’s big,

1165
01:33:33,841 --> 01:33:35,189
he’s bad,

1166
01:33:35,858 --> 01:33:37,794
and he’s got a lot of spirit.

1167
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,837
But anything with a spirit can get broke.

1168
01:33:46,365 --> 01:33:48,081
So you break it.

1169
01:33:49,371 --> 01:33:51,334
I’ll get the shot.

1170
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:57,679
<i>Hey...</i>

1171
01:34:00,538 --> 01:34:03,519
What we’re doing’s important. Right? Like...

1172
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:06,101
what we document,

1173
01:34:06,245 --> 01:34:07,450
it’s...

1174
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:11,022
it’s gonna do some good?

1175
01:34:12,363 --> 01:34:13,410
I mean,

1176
01:34:13,525 --> 01:34:15,085
besides the money...

1177
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:16,855
and fucking fame,

1178
01:34:16,969 --> 01:34:18,975
like, we can save some lives.

1179
01:34:19,082 --> 01:34:21,307
Fuck, we can even save Earth.

1180
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,409
Right?

1181
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:24,784
Yeah.

1182
01:34:32,157 --> 01:34:34,903
<i>Well, it came down to Earth</i>

1183
01:34:35,225 --> 01:34:37,558
<i>And it hid in a tree</i>

1184
01:34:39,388 --> 01:34:42,343
<i>I said,
“Mr. Purple People Eater</i>

1185
01:34:42,483 --> 01:34:44,219
<i>“Don’t eat me”</i>

1186
01:34:45,577 --> 01:34:48,639
<i>Well, he looked at me
and in a voice so gruff</i>

1187
01:34:50,529 --> 01:34:53,189
<i>He said,
“I wouldn’t eat you</i>

1188
01:34:54,224 --> 01:34:56,649
<i>“ ’Cause you’re too tough”</i>

1189
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:06,793
<i>He was a one-eyed, one-horned</i>

1190
01:35:06,893 --> 01:35:09,999
<i>Flyin’ purple people eater</i>

1191
01:35:10,834 --> 01:35:12,997
<i>One-eyed, one-horned</i>

1192
01:35:13,090 --> 01:35:15,565
<i>Flyin’ purple people eater</i>

1193
01:35:15,672 --> 01:35:18,757
<i>One-eyed, one-horned</i>

1194
01:35:18,964 --> 01:35:22,089
<i>Flyin’ purple people eater</i>

1195
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:28,348
<i>Sure looks strange to me.</i>

1196
01:35:44,132 --> 01:35:46,165
He ain’t gonna fuck with you.

1197
01:36:26,846 --> 01:36:29,094
Time to wake up the family.

1198
01:36:45,425 --> 01:36:46,975
Here we go.

1199
01:36:47,197 --> 01:36:50,059
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

1200
01:37:17,744 --> 01:37:20,960
How exquisitely stupid is that?

1201
01:38:04,647 --> 01:38:07,180
We gonna get you today, motherfucker.

1202
01:38:21,582 --> 01:38:23,399
Where is the feed
for Holst’s camera?

1203
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:24,812
<i>Over.</i>

1204
01:38:25,029 --> 01:38:26,530
Couldn’t figure it out. Over.

1205
01:38:27,053 --> 01:38:30,134
<i>What you mean,
you couldn’t figure it out? Over.</i>

1206
01:38:30,841 --> 01:38:33,178
<i>Holst is shooting
on a film camera,</i>

1207
01:38:33,244 --> 01:38:36,553
<i>and all of our cameras
are digital, so it’s a whole thing.</i>

1208
01:38:36,653 --> 01:38:37,930
<i>Over.</i>

1209
01:38:38,045 --> 01:38:40,976
<i>Basically, you forgot about it. Over.</i>

1210
01:38:41,451 --> 01:38:42,753
<i>Yeah, well,
I had my hands full</i>

1211
01:38:42,803 --> 01:38:45,103
<i>rigging 50 fucking sky dancers
to dead people’s car batteries</i>

1212
01:38:45,196 --> 01:38:47,763
<i>all connected to one control panel.
So, yeah, fucking over.</i>

1213
01:38:47,863 --> 01:38:49,430
<i>Sorry. I’m scared.</i>

1214
01:38:49,784 --> 01:38:51,389
Man down.

1215
01:38:51,430 --> 01:38:53,543
Man down? What? Where?

1216
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:56,166
<i>Last dancer, deep in the gulch.</i>

1217
01:38:56,301 --> 01:38:58,940
Stay on it, Em. I’m staying up.

1218
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:02,940
Motherfucker.

1219
01:39:12,193 --> 01:39:13,620
<i>Oh, wait, wait.</i>

1220
01:39:13,954 --> 01:39:15,410
<i>Oh, it’s back up.</i>

1221
01:39:15,787 --> 01:39:17,410
Could be a faulty battery.

1222
01:39:18,926 --> 01:39:21,080
<i>All right. Shot’s up, then.</i>

1223
01:39:24,003 --> 01:39:25,865
Nah, he’s poking.

1224
01:39:35,525 --> 01:39:37,585
Who’s this asshole?

1225
01:39:39,152 --> 01:39:41,060
Man in black
on a white motorcycle.

1226
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:43,810
No, no, no, no.
Shit.

1227
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:49,473
Can I help you?

1228
01:39:58,367 --> 01:40:00,244
You see that cloud?

1229
01:40:01,771 --> 01:40:03,620
Hey, man, who you with?

1230

Oh, I’m sorry.

Who are you?

1232
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:09,620
Nobody.

1233
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:13,010
You don’t look like
a nobody to me.

1234
01:40:13,452 --> 01:40:15,574
Yeah, look,

I’m-a need you to clear the road.

1236
01:40:18,733 --> 01:40:21,952
This whole valley
comes up as blurry on Google Maps.

1237
01:40:22,238 --> 01:40:24,229
You’re really tucked away
back here.

01:40:28,425 --> 01:40:31,379
- Quicker if you go the other way around.
- Yeah.

1240
01:40:32,193 --> 01:40:33,778
Actually,

1241
01:40:34,966 --> 01:40:37,817
what did happen with Jupe Park
and all those people?

1242
01:40:37,916 --> 01:40:39,573
He was basically
your neighbor, right?

1243
01:40:39,673 --> 01:40:41,253
So, what, they vanished?

1244
01:40:41,327 --> 01:40:43,402
You don’t believe
the flood narrative, do you?

1245
01:40:43,481 --> 01:40:44,703
Fuck, guys.

Don’t you want to be on TV?

1252
01:40:59,625 --> 01:41:01,019
Man, I’m trying to tell you.

1253

<i>Shit. We’re all

02:01:40,991 --> 02:01:42,549
You hear me?!

1409
02:01:54,177 --> 02:01:57,108
<i>Cowboys and cowgirls,</i>

1410
02:01:57,244 --> 02:01:59,344
<i>it’s time to ride off into the sunset.</i>

1411
02:01:59,479 --> 02:02:02,286
<i>That’s right. Happy trails.</i>

1412
02:02:02,366 --> 02:02:03,828
<i>It’s closing time.</i>

1413
02:02:03,942 --> 02:02:06,861
<i>You don’t have to go home,
but you can’t stay here.</i>

1414
02:02:06,994 --> 02:02:08,500
<i>Come back again.</i>

1415
02:02:08,620 --> 02:02:11,666
<i>Until then, we wish you well.</i>

1416
02:02:11,927 --> 02:02:14,830
<i>Hasta la vista. Adios.</i>

1417
02:02:15,699 --> 02:02:18,038
Yeah, get a shot of her. Zoom in.

1418
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:30,629
We’re ready.

1419
02:02:30,749 --> 02:02:32,620
We’re set up, ready to go.

1420
02:02:36,590 --> 02:02:38,501
Folks, this is Wally Pachenko

1421
02:02:38,621 --> 02:02:40,389
reporting live from Agua Dulce

1422
02:02:40,516 --> 02:02:42,709
just outside of Jupiter’s Claim,

1423
02:02:42,836 --> 02:02:45,004
where just seconds ago

1424
02:02:45,117 --> 02:02:47,963
an inexplicable occurrence,
just in the distance...

1425
02:02:48,098 --> 02:02:50,636
You can probably hear
the shock in my voice.

1426
02:02:50,771 --> 02:02:53,537
There are still some fragments,
floating in the air

1427
02:02:53,673 --> 02:02:57,774
where some unidentified object

1428
02:02:57,909 --> 02:03:00,109
just drifted off into space and exploded.

1429
02:03:00,244 --> 02:03:02,714
You can see some fragments
still falling from the sky.

1430
02:03:02,849 --> 02:03:04,841
we will have some amazing...
