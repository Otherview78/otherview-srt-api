1
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,966
For most
of human civilization,

2
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:04,053
we believed that we were
Earth's most dominant species.

3
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,888
We believed that life...

4
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,684
...could only exist
on the surface of the planet.

5
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,978
Well, after a certain point,
you have to wonder

6
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,940
what else were we wrong about?

7
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,404
We have mapped

8
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,991
less than five percent
of Hollow Earth.

9
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,869
But our ecosystems
are linked in ways

10
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,621
we never could have imagined.

11
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,999
We are not
two separate worlds.

12
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,083
We're one.

13
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,964
Kong is settling in
to Hollow Earth.

14
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,216
So, the big guy likes
his new home.

15
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,718
We think so.

16
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,262
His species
was a very social one.

17
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,432
It's not natural
for Kong to be so alone.

18
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,978
He's the last of his kind.

19
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,396
Every day he searches

20
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,523
for a family
that he'll never find.

21
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,152
What about Godzilla?

22
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:04,364
Godzilla's
on the surface, Kong is below.

23
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,574
As long as they don't venture
into each other's territories,

24
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,659
we've got nothing
to worry about.

25
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,328
Humanity is lucky...

26
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,871
Godzilla's fighting
the battles we can't.

27
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,908
With some critics

28
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,410
calling out Monarch

29
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,454
for the billions
in taxpayer dollars...

30
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,665
going to Hollow Earth
and classified technologies

31
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,126
like the mysterious
Project Powerhouse.

32
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,586
Well, here to discuss,

33
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,046
Monarch's own,
Doctor Ilene Andrews.

34
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,799
Let's start with Godzilla.
He stopped the attack in Rome,

35
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,635
but he's still in the city.
Should we be worried?

36
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,179
It's clear to us now

37
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,347
that Godzilla is a Titan
who protects us

38
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,224
from other malicious
Titan threats.

39
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,477
Kong's heading in
for the night.

40
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,187
Looks like
it was another rough one.

41
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,022
That's the farthest
he's gone yet.

42
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,982
Maybe he was looking
for a date.

43
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,525
Good luck with that.

44
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,153
I hope he's up
for some interspecies romance.

45
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,530
whoa.

46
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,781
Sinkhole detected

47
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,034
in Sector Five.

48
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,619
That's Kong's
hunting ground.

49
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,217
Whoa. It keeps doing that.

50
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,304
More electrical anomalies?

51
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,722
Nah,
I don't think so, man.

52
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,432
I haven't seen anything
like this before.

53
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,309
Well, we should
tell Director Hampton.

54
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,353
I'll type it up.

55
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,313
This whole place
is an anomaly.

56
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,067
It's so weird.

57
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,708
Tell the Italian military
Rome would be flattened

58
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,085
if it weren't for Godzilla.

59
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,836
They can threaten him
all they want.

60
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,047
Just tell them
to find another scapegoat.

61
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,840
Director Hampton, what's up?

62
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,093
Well, Outpost One
is still a nightmare,

63
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,761
and they sent this over.

64
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,555
I thought you might want
to take a look.

65
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,098
Is this from the sensor array?

66
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,475
Yeah, we've been getting
some pretty weird spikes.

67
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,143
I mean, it could just
be regular interference.

68
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,020
-Yeah, but it keeps happening.
-Mm-hmm.

69
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,564
We should prep a survey team
just in case.

70
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,065
Okay.

71
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,775
And what about Godzilla?

72
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:32,363
Oh, he's still sleeping.
Like a big angry baby.

73
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,241
Let's hope
it stays that way.

74
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,006
Everyone,

75
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,592
eyes on your own paper,
all right?

76
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,635
Let's make sure
we circle the answers

77
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,929
really, really clearly.

78
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,835
Jia!

79
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,309
Your daughter is intelligent,

80
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,019
but she's not engaged.

81
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,520
Her grades are slipping,

82
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,065
she's not interacting
with any of her friends.

83
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,776
And these problems aren't
going away, Doctor Andrews.

84
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,362
They've been getting worse.

85
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,114
Okay, I'm sorry.

86
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,158
She's just still adjusting
to our world.

87
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,451
I understand that,

88
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,786
but we have
a number of students

89
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,204
who are
culturally displaced and--

90
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,372
Sure, but her culture's
not displaced,

91
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,873
she is her culture.

92
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,793
She's the last living member
of the Iwi tribe.

93
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,294
We're just trying
to reach her.

94
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,549
I know. Join the club.

95
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,140
Come on.

96
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,440
For centuries,

97
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,900
the Iwi tribe were
the guardians of Skull Island,

98
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,361
the ancestral home
of the great Kong.

99
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,405
But when
shifting storm patterns

100
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,907
destroyed the island,
the Iwi were annihilated...

101
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,242
...with only a single member

102
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,703
of the tribe having survived.

103
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,455
A young girl...

104
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,207
...found and rescued
amid the punishing storm.

105
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,501
Her fellow villagers
were lost to the tides.

106
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,796
Gone to history, just like
the great Kongs themselves.

107
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,339
Holy shit.

108
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,091
The Iwi were unique...

109
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,385
...in the sense that they
had no spoken language.

110
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,262
Many believe
that tribe members developed

111
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,722
the ability to communicate...

112
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,824
We're gonna figure this out.

113
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,460
Where will you be

114
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,546
when the next Titan attacks?

115
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,341
How will you protect
the things and people

116
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,968
that matter most to you?

117
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,346
Today's podcast
is brought to you

118
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,181
by Gargantua insurance,
the only insurance company

119
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,100
that provides Titan protection
for your home

120
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,893
and personal belongings.

121
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,812
'Cause Godzilla may not care
about your hopes and dreams,

122
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,647
but Gargantua does.

123
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,774
Okay, Titan truthers!

124
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,734
Oh, we have got a lot...

125
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,778
...to unpack on today's show.

126
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,363
Recording in progress,

127
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,447
go away!

128
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,701
Uh, yes. I just want
to let everyone know

129
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,119
that there is no...

130
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,871
I'm gonna kill...

131
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,789
Unbelievable! What?

132
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,541
Uh...

133
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,545
Hi, Bernie.

134
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,547
Ilene Andrews,
we met in Hong Kong.

135
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,257
Oh. Oh.

136
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,675
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

137
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,594
Hong Kong.
Yeah, that was so long ago.

138
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,388
So, no, God, uh, yeah.

139
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,514
That was when
my hair was longer.

140
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,682
You cut your hair.

141
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,309
Highlights too, it's nice.

142
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,730
I was wondering if I could get
your help with something.

143
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,357
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.

144
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,319
Uh, sure.

145
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,280
Sure, yeah. Of course, yeah.
Come on in, Doctor Andrews.

146
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,157
-Okay.
-Yeah.

147
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,366
Just straight down
that hall there.

148
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,743
To the left. Okay.

149
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,080
Have a seat.
What can I help you with?

150
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,083
You know, mi casa es su home.

151
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,294
Okay, so.
The sequence on the right,

152
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,546
this is a signal
that's been interfering

153
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,714
with our equipment
in Hollow Earth.

154
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,549
-Okay.
-And, uh...

155
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,178
And these are drawings
by my daughter, Jia.

156
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,848
And you're gonna think
that I'm completely insane.

157
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,893
No, the patterns are the same
in the middle section.

158
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,771
Yes. Exactly.

159
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,481
Thank you.

160
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,107
Look, our analysts,

161
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,484
they don't know
what to make of this.

162
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,860
They're talking in circles,

163
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,320
they're saying
"radio interference,"

164
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,821
"coincidence," but I...

165
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,865
I know that you think
outside of the box.

166
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,201
I didn't know
who else to turn to.

167
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,702
And they sent you
here because...?

168
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,912
No, no one sent me.
I came here on my...

169
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,121
You know,
that's what's ironic.

170
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,706
You know,
Monarch wouldn't confirm

171
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,875
my crucial part
in taking down Mechagodzilla,

172
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,919
which cost me thousands of...

173
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,046
hundreds of subscribers
on my blog.

174
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,048
Oh, and the trolls...

175
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,341
the trolls online,
they question

176
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,884
every single thing
that I put up.

177
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,886
Especially this one troll.

178
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,721
This one troll named
ghidorastan64.

179
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,056
You ever heard of him?

180
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,265
-No, I don't think I have.
-Great,

181
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,725
because he's a trash bag,
okay?

182
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,185
I'm more qualified
than half of those people

183
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,603
that you have working
over there.

184
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,230
I knew what Godzilla
was going to do

185
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,731
before anybody
at Monarch said...

186
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,442
Which is why I am here,
Bernie.

187
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,444
I am here. Okay?

188
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,782
Can you help me or not?

189
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,784
That depends.

190
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,828
Are you the new boss
down at the Mess?

191
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,162
The what?

192
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,539
The Monarch
Hollow Earth Station.

193
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,416
The MHES, the Mess.

194
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,959
Yeah, nobody calls it that.

195
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,752
I run the Kong
research division

196
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,463
but technically
Director Hampton is in charge

197
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,465
-of general operations.
-Hmm.

198
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,092
Well, Director Hampton
doesn't have a kid

199
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,552
who can talk to Kong.

200
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,266
You want to go
to Hollow Earth.

201
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,892
I'm so glad
I didn't have to say it.

202
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,519
I thought you were never
gonna ask

203
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,062
-but I really do need proof.
-No, I'm not asking.

204
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,772
I mean, that would help me
with my bona fides

205
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,274
for my blog. And I knew
that you would be the person

206
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,942
to help me do that.

207
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,110
Okay. Well, if this happens,
and that is a big if,

208
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,862
then Monarch would need,
you know,

209
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,405
whatever you guys call it.
Final cut on anything in...

210
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,449
Whoa. I'm sorry,
final cut? No, no, no.

211
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,576
You know, that will destroy
my journalistic integrity.

212
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,244
Shit.

213
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,662
No really true, good
documentarian gives final cut.

214
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,122
I could make you a producer.

215
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,665
Okay, okay! Fine! Final cut!
Final cut! Fine!

216
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,125
Look, something is happening
to my daughter,

217
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,045
and I have no idea
how to fix it.

218
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,671
You work out what's going on,

219
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,881
and I will get you anything
that you want, okay?

220
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,215
That is a promise.

221
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,467
Well, anything is a lot,

222
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,968
but that's very generous,
but I...

223
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,804
-And we have to go. Right now.
-What?

224
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,681
Godzilla is on the move again.

225
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,656
Okay, listen to me.

226
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,241
If Godzilla's on the move,
he senses a threat coming.

227
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,784
We don't know what it is.

228
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,035
And you're not concerned?

229
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,537
Of course we're concerned,
Senator.

230
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,413
That's why we're monitoring
the situation.

231
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,373
Monitor the fact
that if Godzilla heads...

232
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,874
What is it? You just...

233
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,542
-And I am telling you,
-We have a problem!

234
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,876
Senator...

235
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,545
that Kong doesn't
leave Hollow Earth.

236
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,549
Which is why Godzilla has
no reason to retaliate.

237
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,979
-What's he doing up here?
-No idea.

238
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,314
-Well, does Godzilla know?
-Not that we can tell.

239
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,941
Yeah, well, it's only
a matter of time.

240
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,986
And what happens if Godzilla
starts heading this way?

241
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,654
Then we all run like hell.

242
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,738
Get up, let's go!

243
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,198
Keep it up. Come on. Let's go.

244
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,268
Sedatives in place.

245
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,611
All right, the good news is

246
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,237
it's just an infected tooth.

247
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:01,200
But luckily, you've come
to the best doctor in town.

248
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,090
All right,
Kong sedation at a 100%.

249
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,383
Vitals stable.

250
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,927
Trapper, you are clear to swap

251
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,428
the damaged tooth
with replacement.

252
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,475
Way-hey!

253
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,270
Touchdown, Trapper.

254
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,243
Whoa. Fella.

255
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,452
What'd you have for breakfast?

256
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:49,998
All right?

257
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,586
Yeah, this sucker's ready
to come out.

258
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,173
Whoa.

259
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,300
All right, let's roll!

260
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,657
There she is.

261
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,951
Trapper.

262
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,953
Thanks for getting down here
so fast. Nice work.

263
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,038
You are most welcome.

264
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,415
It's not every day
you get to climb

265
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,208
inside a 300-foot ape's mouth,
is it?

266
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,377
Yeah. And you're sure it's
gonna be strong enough?

267
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,628
The tooth? Yeah.

268
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,046
That's the same
polymer composite

269
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,673
they use on the vehicle
heat shields.

270
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,342
He could chomp through

271
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,802
the Eiffel Tower
with that thing.

272
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,262
Well,
good teeth aren't gonna help

273
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,139
if Godzilla senses
that he's up here.

274
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,684
Well. You can't have a Titan
with a toothache,

275
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:51,852
can you?

276
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,353
-No.
-Don't worry.

277
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,730
Couple of hours
he might be a bit groggy,

278
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,523
but he'll be good to go
back down.

279
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,233
You know, when I first heard
that you were gonna be a vet

280
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,568
I thought no.

281
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,069
That is way too boring

282
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,779
for Trapper.

283
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,364
Then you go and become the
weirdest vet in the world.

284
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,450
Yeah, it's basically
me and Doctor Dolittle.

285
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,244
Except my animals are bigger.

286
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,122
I thought finally, someone has
made him grow up.

287
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,416
Nope. Someone tried that
back in college,

288
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,960
-but... didn't really work.
-Oh, yeah?

289
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,420
Yeah,
what was it she said to me?

290
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,839
"Trapper,
you are not a serious person."

291
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,132
Oh, she sounds very smart.

292
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,260
Yeah, ish. She got a PhD.

293
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,262
Two, actually.

294
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,766
How's the kid doing?

295
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,769
You know. Struggling.

296
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,146
Trying to find her place
in the world.

297
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,774
Yeah, I know how that goes.

298
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,109
Don't worry,
she'll be all right.

299
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,235
She got a good mum.

300
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,382
Doctor Andrews. Your guest
has been asking for you.

301
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,385
Please don't take this
the wrong way,

302
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,136
but can I just say,

303
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,971
that your research library
has many glaring omissions.

304
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,556
I had to call in
some serious favors

305
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,933
from my Discord chat.
They were not...

306
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,393
Bernie, do you have something?

307
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,769
Yes, I've got something.
I do have something.

308
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,562
Whatever signal
you guys are picking up,

309
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,898
okay, we have seen similar
patterns repeating over time.

310
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,442
And each spike corresponds
with a specific Titan event.

311
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,152
Can you hold this, please?
Thank you so much.

312
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,029
Okay, check this out.

313
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,199
See this? King Ghidorah, huh?
First encounter with Godzilla.

314
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,283
-Mm-hmm.
-Here, uh,

315
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,952
discovery of Skull Island.

316
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,829
All right. So what you're
saying is that these signals

317
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,705
-aren't just random patterns.
-Yeah, it seems that way, yes.

318
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,124
And Godzilla's
picking up on it?

319
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,917
Oh, I can do you one better.
Now, look,

320
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,335
I've looked
at points of similarities

321
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,003
in each wave form
and I compared them

322
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,171
-to that pattern, and...
-Bernie, what are you saying?

323
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,714
It's a distress call!

324
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,300
It's a distress call.
A psychic energy SOS.

325
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,761
Now, if your daughter is
seeing these symbols,

326
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,556
then something down
there is calling for help.

327
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,102
Regular soundwaves,

328
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,396
they can't propagate this far
without decay. This?

329
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,398
This is something that
we have never encountered.

330
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,900
-And it's getting stronger.
-You got a working theory?

331
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,318
Yeah,
telepathic alien language.

332
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,362
It's some sort of
distress signal.

333
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,198
Signal? From what?

334
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,283
Or from who.

335
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,617
Well, whatever it is,

336
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,161
this is why Godzilla's
on the move?

337
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,079
We can't say for sure.
But it seems that way.

338
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,623
Well, we have
to figure this out fast.

339
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,085
The wolves are already
at our door.

340
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,587
The government has been
looking for an excuse

341
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,380
to take over
Hollow Earth operations.

342
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,632
And the corporations
are licking their chops.

343
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,301
Yeah,
because who wants to be rich

344
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,011
and get rid
of all the monsters?

345
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,846
I mean, that'd be terrible,
right?

346
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,098
We'd better find the source
before D.C. gets wind of this.

347
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,102
Okay.

348
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,438
I'm giving you
full operational oversight.

349
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,815
Take a small team.
Mikael, make it fast

350
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,317
and don't let anyone die.

351
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,486
We'll be in and out of there
before nightfall.

352
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,779
You, uh, you feel like
going for a ride?

353
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,199
Thought you'd never ask.

354
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,747
Attention, all hands.

355
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,540
Prepare HEAV three
for Hollow Earth launch

356
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,293
in T minus five minutes.

357
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,587
There's no response
from the Hollow Earth outpost.

358
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,880
Their radios must be down.

359
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,423
Well, then
that's our first stop.

360
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,549
Copy that.

361
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,742
All right, wakey wakey,
everyone. Kong's up.

362
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,933
Hey. Hey! Doctor Andrews. Hey.
Come on, we had a deal!

363
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,268
Bernie, this isn't sightseeing.

364
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,602
It's a reconnaissance mission.

365
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,021
So, I see how it is.

366
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,648
When you need something,
it's all

367
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,358
"you're so smart, Bernie,
you're so capable, Bernie,

368
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,402
"I'll subscribe
to your Titan blog, Bernie,"

369
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,363
and when I deliver it,
you toss me aside.

370
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,782
Okay, look.
This could be dangerous.

371
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,284
Come on.

372
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,369
I'm no stranger to danger.

373
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,623
I didn't mean to rhyme
that time.

374
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,751
Look, you owe me. Okay?
I helped crack this thing.

375
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,170
This could be like last time,
when we saved the world.

376
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,338
Remember? Hmm?

377
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,384
-Mikael?
-Yeah.

378
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,845
Prep a seat for one more.

379
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,722
Thank you, Doctor Andrews!
You will not regret it.

380
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:39,889
You're kidding, right?

381
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,892
I'm the plus one. Hello.

382
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,480
Systems online.

383
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,149
Whoa. Oh. Whoa.

384
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,109
We're online.

385
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,986
We are going to Hollow Earth.

386
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:56,948
I am going to Hollow Earth.

387
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,451
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

388
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,952
So, is there, like,
a in-flight briefing

389
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,329
that I should know about?
You know...

390
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,872
-Yeah, there is.
-He's very...

391
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,458
There's no parachutes,
no flotation devices,

392
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,959
you touch any of this stuff,

393
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,794
you lose your hand,
and if you die,

394
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,713
make sure
it's outside my vehicle.

395
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,010
Good briefing. Great briefing.

396
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,887
Don't take Mikael
too personally.

397
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,680
Aggression is
his love language.

398
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,564
All right, Mikael.
Let's punch it.

399
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,824
HEAV one,

400
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,159
you are clear for launch.

401
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,327
Let's do this.

402
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,383
Just try not
to swallow your tongue.

403
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,385
What?
Try not to swallow my tongue?

404
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,761
I don't exactly know
what that means.

405
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,265
Base to HEAV,

406
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,059
you're clear for entry.

407
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,268
On your count,

408
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,645
-Doctor Andrews.
-Three.

409
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,729
-All right, let's go.
-Two.

410
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,106
I'm not ready.

411
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,191
-And one.
-Oh, my God!

412
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:43,054
I'm turning into water.

413
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,327
Flight systems active.

414
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,163
Systems stabilized.

415
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,372
All systems good,

416
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,749
-Doc.
-How's everyone doing?

417
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:11,833
You all right?

418
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,376
-Never better.
-Yeah?

419
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,961
Bernie, you good?

420
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,885
-Nice one. Oh, wow.
-Whew.

421
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,325
Looks like
Kong is headed home.

422
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,243
-How far to the outpost?
-Hundred klicks.

423
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,703
They're still
not answering comms.

424
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,915
Proximity alert.

425
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,251
Predators,
nine o'clock.

426
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,628
Where? What?

427
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,629
Those are vertacines, Mikael.

428
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:58,922
They're called vertacines.

429
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,548
Um, are they a problem?

430
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,133
No.
They're totally harmless.

431
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,635
Unless you get 'em riled up,
and then they pack

432
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,470
about a lightning bolt
worth of bioelectricity.

433
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,100
Predators know
to stay well away.

434
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,728
Which makes them
the perfect chaperone

435
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,524
if you happen to have
a cool biomimicry camouflage.

436
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,733
Which we do.

437
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,333
-Talk to me.
-It's not good.

438
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,460
Godzilla just made landfall
in France.

439
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,170
Ground team
is five klicks out.

440
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,480
We got picture.

441
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,191
Oh, my God.
It's a nuclear facility.

442
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,259
Atmospheric radiation levels

443
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,594
are dropping.
He's absorbing it.

444
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,304
Okay, he's charging
for something.

445
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,300
Godzilla consumed

446
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,843
a huge amount of radiation.

447
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,596
He is clearly preparing
for something...

448
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,847
Out of range.

449
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,223
Damn it.

450
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,434
We're coming up
on Outpost One.

451
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,236
Oh, God.

452
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,821
Oh, well, now. That doesn't
look good now, does it?

453
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,324
You seeing this, Doc?

454
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,701
Yeah. Yeah, I'm seeing it.

455
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,566
Well, there's
no heat signatures.

456
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,443
So much for survivors.

457
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,947
God, have some respect.
These people had families.

458
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,490
What could have done this?

459
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,076
I don't understand,

460
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,869
we've had this outpost
for years without incident.

461
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,789
So, why attack now?
What changed?

462
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,797
Hey, Doc.
There's a camera here.

463
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,842
You reckon you can pull
any footage off of that?

464
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,011
Oh, shit.

465
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,810
You think Kong did that?

466
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:44,313
No, that's not Kong.
That's something else.

467
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,899
Yeah.
Let's get off the ground

468
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,860
before that something else
comes back.

469
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,695
Saddle up.
Let's hustle.

470
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,669
Are you getting
anything off that thing?

471
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,795
Yeah, I'm just...

472
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,841
Oh, my God.

473
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:04,925
What?

474
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,304
Here. Take a look.

475
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,223
It looks like an ape.
But that's impossible.

476
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,517
What the bloody hell is that?

477
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,977
I have no idea.

478
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,065
-Whoa! No!
-Whoa.

479
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,983
Mikael! Mikael!

480
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,276
I'm working on it!

481
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,569
Come on, you...

482
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,779
God!
Okay, okay, okay!

483
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,076
The hell was that, Mikael?

484
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,702
Calm down. Calm down.

485
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,079
It must've been the signal.
The same electrical

486
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,538
disturbances were
happening at the outpost.

487
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,875
Oh, come on. Come on.

488
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,131
She says it's coming
from that ridge point.

489
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,389
Well, let's take a look.

490
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,890
I'll get as close as I can.

491
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,825
The Hollow Earth.

492
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,830
A world untouched by mankind.

493
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,416
Is this
how Neil Armstrong felt

494
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,876
when he stepped on alien soil?

495
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,381
Is this one small step for me,

496
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,590
and one giant leap for...

497
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,883
Who are you talking to?

498
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,343
Are you kidding me?

499
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,262
Right down the lens?
It's a documentary.

500
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,013
You wanna be natural.
Just walk, if you just walk.

501
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,099
-All right, just keep...
-Yeah, just... Okay. Take two.

502
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:41,522
The Hollow Earth. A world...

503
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,732
All right, guys.
That ridge you pointed out

504
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,651
is about two miles
straight ahead.

505
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,657
I'm getting eaten alive
out here.

506
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:57,037
Oh, look at that.
I must be tasty too.

507
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,831
Kill it.

508
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,877
Only female mosquitos
drink blood.

509
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,462
So they can grow their eggs.

510
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,257
She needs it more than me.

511
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,774
Wait.

512
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,486
-What?
-What's the holdup?

513
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,070
Not this way.

514
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,822
What? Why?

515
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,407
Yeah, we gotta take a detour.
There's something here.

516
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,659
Where, here? Like here, here?

517
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,870
Hey.

518
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,747
Nah. I'm not picking
anything up.

519
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,123
No. Something
doesn't smell right,

520
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,750
and it's not just you, Mikael.

521
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,878
Can you smell that?
It's like rotting flesh.

522
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,005
It's probably
just a carcass upwind.

523
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,340
-We keep moving.
-Mikael, hold up.

524
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,175
Listen, pal. I'm gonna trust

525
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,177
my state of the art thermal
over your

526
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,763
Ace Ventura
hippie-dippie sixth sense

527
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,973
all day long. You got me?

528
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,308
There's no need to call
people names. We're just...

529
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,976
Hey. And as for you,
freak show,

530
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,020
if you don't shut it,
I'm gonna take that camera,

531
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,355
I'm gonna shove it
right up your arse.

532
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,814
I'm in charge, we move.

533
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,233
Why don't we just listen
to somebody calmer?

534
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,567
I said I'm in charge.

535
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,110
I'm in charge!

536
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,612
Whoa!

537
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,239
Run!

538
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,745
It was a tree.
It was a tree!

539
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,372
Wait, wait, wait.

540
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,706
We should be all right.
We should be all right.

541
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,083
Those things
don't reach that far.

542
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,668
He was just eaten by a tree.

543
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,253
What you doing, Doc?

544
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,921
I'm trying to call
the Base for extraction.

545
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,256
It's just, one minute
he was there, right?

546
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,507
He was right in my face.
And then, a tree!

547
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,424
-Outta nowhere!
-I know, man.

548
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,759
I know. That's heavy.

549
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,635
But that's
the natural world, man.

550
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,844
"Red in tooth and claw."

551
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,597
Tennyson.
You just watched a man

552
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,140
get devoured
by a topiary nightmare,

553
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,476
and you want to quote
Tennyson? Down here?

554
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,479
Yeah. Yeah, man.
He knew all about it.

555
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,606
"Let love clasp grief," man.
Come here.

556
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,983
Mm.

557
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,109
You know, humans,
we think we took

558
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,444
ourselves off the food chain,

559
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:57,032
but maybe, maybe the Titans
are here to remind us.

560
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,535
I think that
there is something

561
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,036
seriously wrong with you.

562
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,247
-Okay.
-Mm-kay.

563
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,124
-Okay.
-Mm.

564
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:07,167
It's not working.

565
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,962
We better move on.
We'll mourn later.

566
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,007
Jia. Come on.

567
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,425
-Come on, bud.
-But the...

568
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,635
He was eaten by a tree.

569
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,596
I don't...
I don't want to die like that.

570
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,805
Not by a tree.

571
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,816
Tower,

572
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,234
we can't get
any closer than this.

573
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,654
Godzilla's burning hot
with radiation.

574
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,282
Whatever he's headed for
has him really pissed off.

575
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,461
This is Base

576
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,004
calling Fifteen Alpha, over.

577
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,758
Fifteen Alpha responding.

578
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,509
Godzilla's current trajectory
is showing

579
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,345
him heading
towards the Arctic Ocean.

580
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,096
What Titans are in the area?

581
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,353
Looks like
he's hunting Tiamat.

582
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,396
Classified file three two four.

583
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,065
Titanus Tiamat.

584
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,566
Titan nineteen.

585
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,444
Extremely aggressive,
territorial.

586
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:18,447
Weaponizing her body
of razor-sharp scales...

587
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,158
Tiamat's Arctic lair
sits in the direct path

588
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,869
of electromagnetically charged
solar winds,

589
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,581
making it the largest
stockpile of energy on Earth.

590
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,001
If Godzilla takes down Tiamat,
he'll supercharge.

591
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,844
It's ruins.

592
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,389
Human civilization?

593
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,307
Down here?

594
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,187
Hey.

595
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,111
Yeah.

596
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,862
The markings are older
than the ones

597
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,614
on Skull Island.
Centuries older.

598
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,121
But the architecture is
consistent with the Iwi.

599
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,390
Whoa.

600
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,113
Oh, this is remarkable.

601
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,291
Now, that's weird.

602
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,294
There's no moss on these ones.

603
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,218
Hello.

604
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,768
Mothra.

605
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,979
Queen of the monsters.
In Hollow Earth.

606
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:16,440
Her lineage must go
back further than we thought.

607
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,783
Yeah.

608
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:45,803
No, no, no.

609
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,895
What is that? Whoa!

610
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,986
Hey!

611
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,696
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

612
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:11,870
It's like some kind of
a irrigation system.

613
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,705
Only this predates everything

614
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,123
Mesopotamians,
the Lemurians...

615
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,459
I mean, these guys
were the first, man!

616
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,880
-Jia.
-It just keeps going.

617
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,049
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Oh. Sorry.

618
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,301
Oh, whoa.
What the...?

619
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,888
Now, that is a trip.

620
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,723
Great Mulder and Scully,
look at that.

621
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,727
What could have created this?

622
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,479
Ancient alien astronauts.

623
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,647
Yeah.

624
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,360
Look at this here.

625
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,112
The water's
running underneath.

626
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,864
And this is organic.

627
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,330
Yeah.

628
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,044
Some kind of bioelectric hub.

629
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,597
It's like camouflage.

630
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,681
Wow.

631
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:20,397
Should she be doing that?

632
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,690
She shouldn't be doing that,
right? Should she...?

633
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,295
This must be
the source of the signal.

634
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,130
Oh, we've gotta
check this out.

635
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,214
Yeah.

636
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,179
Okay. Go, go, go. Go.

637
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,625
Fifteen Alpha reporting
to base.

638
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,127
We're entering
Tiamat's domain,

639
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,046
but something is off.

640
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,548
Tiamat's energy
is distorting our radar.

641
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,841
We don't have a visual
on Godzilla.

642
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:43,261
Take us forward,
silent running...

643
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,554
-Yes, sir.
-...five knots.

644
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,733
-Mayday!
-Get that out!

645
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,665
Get that out!

646
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:54,874
I need a status report!

647
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,334
That's right.

648
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,335
He's gone to Tiamat's lair.

649
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:13,810
Wait, wait, wait.

650
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:21,901
Wait, what did she say?

651
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,320
She says we're not alone.

652
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,363
See? I knew it.
I knew I felt something.

653
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,035
Come on, then.

654
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,500
Go.

655
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,669
Oh, my God.

656
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,004
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

657
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,380
It's going away.
It's going away. Okay.

658
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,742
Oh, my God.

659
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,328
Oh, my God.

660
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,420
What?

661
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,965
It's an entire
Iwi civilization,

662
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,384
protected within Hollow Earth.

663
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,387
These structures,
they look like they've been

664
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,181
carved from
some enormous quartz crystal.

665
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,141
That must be
their energy source.

666
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,643
I'm feeling the energy,

667
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,560
but let's just keep it
together, all right?

668
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:53,701
Oh, my God.
It's an undocumented vortex.

669
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,620
Looks like several of them,
actually.

670
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,247
Routes to the surface.

671
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,124
These could lead
all over the Earth.

672
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,418
Oh, wow.
That's incredible.

673
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:05,839
You should make
eye contact with them.

674
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,549
It's considered polite.

675
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,345
Yeah, this is not
working for me.

676
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:16,015
Oh.

677
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,623
How are they communicating?

678
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,000
Telepathically.

679
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,052
Okay. No, I, no,
no, no. You can't take her.

680
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,345
I think she's taking her
to the...

681
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,889
Well, let me come!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

682
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:56,723
Hold on, okay,
we're not resisting.

683
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,183
Wait, wait, wait.

684
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,851
I don't know where
she's taking her! Hey!

685
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,526
Okay.

686
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,711
-Okay, come on. Okay.
-Let's go, let's go.

687
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,720
Whoa. Oh.

688
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,272
Can I?

689
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,441
Thank you.

690
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,112
Of course.

691
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,196
What's she saying, Doc?

692
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,492
The beacon that we've been
following, it's...

693
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,496
It's the Iwi calling for help.

694
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:48,293
Oh. Whoa.

695
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:59,929
So, wait. They send out
this SOS, and then what?

696
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,347
Godzilla hears it?

697
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,725
Yeah. They woke him up.

698
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:05,351
An SOS for what?
They already live

699
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,644
in a nightmare
monster hellscape.

700
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,187
What could possibly
scare them?

701
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,023
Hey. She can understand
everything that you say.

702
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,650
-She understands me?
-Oh, good.

703
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,277
And a nightmare
monster hellscape

704
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,322
is a wonderful place
to raise a family.

705
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:17,215
Oh, wow.

706
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,884
This whole room
is covered in Iwi script.

707
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:27,642
It says that in the beginning,

708
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:31,604
Hollow Earth lived in harmony
with the surface world.

709
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,941
The Titans were
the guardians of nature

710
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:38,611
and the Great Apes became
the protectors of humanity.

711
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,951
But a great evil
threatened the peace.

712
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:48,162
A powerful and ruthless ape

713
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,581
desperate to conquer
the surface world,

714
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:54,585
led his tribe into war
against the one they call...

715
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,629
The Monster Who Ate a Star.

716
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,297
Godzilla.

717
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,717
There's more.

718
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,428
The war with the Apes
nearly destroyed Godzilla.

719
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,138
But after a great battle,

720
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,639
he imprisoned the apes

721
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,850
in a fiery realm
of Hollow Earth.

722
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:11,352
Their false king
remains obsessed

723
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,104
with reaching the surface.

724
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:16,357
The Iwi call him
the Skar King.

725
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,450
Trapped within
their subterranean realm,

726
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:07,286
the Skar King harnessed
a terrible power.

727
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,705
The ancient Titan, Shimo.

728
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,171
He controls her
with pain.

729
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:19,590
Her power covered the Earth
in the last ice age.

730
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:23,636
We brought Kong down here.

731
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,429
He's been looking
for others like himself,

732
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:27,139
going deeper
into Hollow Earth

733
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,266
and getting closer
to their prison.

734
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,602
The Iwi must have known
it was just a matter of time,

735
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:33,312
and that's why they've been

736
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:36,690
calling for help, and that's
why Godzilla's changing.

737
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,234
He's gearing up
for World War Three.

738
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,277
Okay, but he barely survived
last time.

739
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:41,946
What's Godzilla
gonna do on his own?

740
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:46,867
He won't be on his own.

741
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:49,745
The Iwi believe
that at the end of the world,

742
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:52,414
one of their own
will return...

743
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:55,751
and awaken Mothra,
defender of the Iwi...

744
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:58,504
and ancient ally of Godzilla.

745
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,714
They believe
that their savior will be

746
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,549
an Iwi from Skull Island.

747
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,763
That seems like a lot
to put on one kid.

748
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,107
This is
Monarch Air Team to Base,

749
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,192
tracking over
Godzilla's location.

750
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:28,028
We've closed the shipping lanes
within 300 miles.

751
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:32,074
Plasma readings indicate he's
absorbing everything in there.

752
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,508
You know, I made
a deal with myself

753
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,552
when I became a mother.

754
01:13:51,635 --> 01:13:55,013
I said to myself, "I don't care
what you have to sacrifice...

755
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:58,225
what you have to give up,

756
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:00,436
you will do right
by that little girl."

757
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:05,107
I just never thought that

758
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,818
the thing I'd be giving up
would be her.

759
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:09,445
Look, you don't know that.

760
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,612
Really?

761
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,114
Trapper, before we came here

762
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:15,534
she said that
she didn't belong anywhere.

763
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,537
If this is the life
that she wants,

764
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,205
then I have to give her up.

765
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,134
Am I having
a funny turn

766
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:33,469
or does everything feel
lighter down here?

767
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,722
Wait, wait, wait.

768
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,935
What are they doing?
That must weigh a ton.

769
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,479
Yeah. Yeah, see,

770
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,314
I don't know
how they can do it...

771
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:47,107
but somehow they're able to
move the pyramids' positions,

772
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:48,317
which disrupts the

773
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,194
gravitational pull
down here,

774
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,362
and that's how
they run their city.

775
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:53,947
An entire civilization

776
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:55,741
built off the manipulation
of gravity.

777
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:58,202
God, I wish
was streaming this live!

778
01:14:58,285 --> 01:14:59,745
What you gonna do
with that, Bern?

779
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:03,332
Look, I know
what you're thinking,

780
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:05,417
but you don't understand.
Okay?

781
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:06,793
To have been through
what I've been through,

782
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:08,253
seen what I seen

783
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,922
and have absolutely
nobody believe you.

784
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:14,218
This place...

785
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:17,888
This place is special, man.
It's magic.

786
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:19,431
How long do you think
it'll stay like that

787
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,892
if you start posting that
about, hmm?

788
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:25,521
Like, you look at any isolated
tribe or community,

789
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,064
how many of them

790
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:28,482
survive contact with
the outside world, hmm?

791
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:33,862
You know I think
you're brilliant, don't you?

792
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,781
You already saved
the world once.

793
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,241
Can't take that away from you.

794
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:41,036
Could you say that all again?

795
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:43,121
The last part,
so I have it on footage.

796
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,414
What?

797
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,378
Oh, well, we have to find out
what that was, right?

798
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:27,874
Oh, my God.

799
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,218
Is that a mini-Kong?

800
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,722
How did they find this place?

801
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:43,348
He must have sensed Jia.

802
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:39,988
That arm looks bad.

803
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:42,324
Yeah. That's worse than bad.

804
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,409
That's frostbite.

805
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,874
I'd better go take a look.

806
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:22,215
Warning, detecting
altered energy signature.

807
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:25,302
Oh, my God.
He's changed.

808
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:34,728
I know, I know.
Nobody likes a dentist.

809
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,440
Let's get a look
at that arm, big guy.

810
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:44,362
Trapper, he looks really hurt.

811
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:47,699
Yeah, it's not great.
I'm seeing nerve damage...

812
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,160
significant tissue loss.

813
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:51,912
So, what are we saying?

814
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:54,915
He's not gonna last a day down
here with only one arm.

815
01:19:54,998 --> 01:19:57,751
Yeah, communication
to the surface is still out.

816
01:19:57,834 --> 01:19:59,127
If I can get back
to the outpost,

817
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:00,462
I think there might be
some supplies

818
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:02,255
that we can use.

819
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:03,673
I don't think a massive cast
is gonna solve the problem.

820
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:06,676
I wasn't talkin'
plaster of Paris.

821
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,678
I'm thinking
more along the lines of, uh...

822
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:12,140
Project Powerhouse.

823
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:14,643
You can't be serious?

824
01:20:14,726 --> 01:20:16,853
Oh, I'm deadly serious.

825
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,480
That prototype
was almost finished

826
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:20,190
when they pulled the funding.

827
01:20:20,273 --> 01:20:22,150
All right, well, what are you
still doing here?

828
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:24,569
I love you, too, Doc.

829
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:27,531
Project Powerhouse, what is...
what is that, exactly?

830
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:32,118
After Mechagodzilla,

831
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:33,161
we realized that there were
some threats that

832
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:34,955
even Kong couldn't face.

833
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:39,709
So, we started working on some
minor augmentations.

834
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:42,003
Oh.

835
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:43,839
Wait, what kind of
augmentations?

836
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:48,385
Making one of
the strongest Titans

837
01:20:48,468 --> 01:20:50,428
even stronger
didn't go over so well.

838
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:51,805
So, we got shut down.

839
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,352
Lucky for us, the prototype

840
01:20:57,435 --> 01:21:00,564
had already been transported
to Hollow Earth for testing.

841
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:04,401
It's stored in the armory
at Outpost One.

842
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:25,380
Autopilot engaged.

843
01:21:41,771 --> 01:21:42,856
Woo-hoo!

844
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:46,067
What do you think of that?

845
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:48,361
That's one hell of an
augmentation there, Trapper.

846
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:50,906
Only the best for Mr. Kong.

847
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:16,306
All right, it's ready to go.

848
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:21,227
Those injections should heal
the frostbite up nicely.

849
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:32,864
All right, there he goes.

850
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,157
He's moving.

851
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:39,454
You got this.

852
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:50,465
Look, it's a bit rough
and ready, but it should hold.

853
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:51,758
It's good.
It looks good, Trapper.

854
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:52,884
Damn good.

855
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:02,811
-Here we go.
-Yeah.

856
01:23:02,894 --> 01:23:04,187
He's either gonna love it

857
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,563
or he's gonna rip it off
with his teeth.

858
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:15,323
I think
he loves it! Yeah?

859
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:38,638
Skar King.

860
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,979
Hey, hey!
What did you tell him?

861
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,692
Oh.

862
01:23:51,818 --> 01:23:53,486
Where's he going?

863
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:55,739
Godzilla won't come down here
unless Kong brings him.

864
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:57,240
Okay, the last time
those two met up

865
01:23:57,323 --> 01:23:58,908
it was almost the end of Kong.

866
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:00,535
He is taking a hell of a risk.

867
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:05,707
If Kong invades his turf,
could start a war.

868
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:08,334
Yeah, that's
a suicide mission.

869
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:10,670
But if Kong draws Godzilla
down here...

870
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:13,048
they can make their stand
in Hollow Earth

871
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:15,008
and then there's
a chance that

872
01:24:15,091 --> 01:24:17,177
Godzilla can stop
Skar King and Shimo

873
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,386
from reaching the surface.

874
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,884
We are absolutely certain

875
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:23,094
that she can pull this off,
right?

876
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,180
It's why Jia was called here.

877
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:28,766
Only an Iwi from Skull Island
can awaken Mothra.

878
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:31,019
And Mothra is the key
to Godzilla

879
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:32,353
protecting this place,

880
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:34,480
and its pathways
to the surface.

881
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:43,781
She's gonna be all right.

882
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:44,824
-Uh-huh.
-She's gonna be all right.

883
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:47,804
Hey, she's evacuating
the villagers.

884
01:27:51,307 --> 01:27:53,726
Gravity! Gravity!
The pyramids and gravity.

885
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,520
Yeah, I got it! I got it now!

886
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:57,021
-Tell me on the way.
-Come on, come on!

887
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:59,065
While we are throwing
random shit at the wall,

888
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:02,110
permission to take the HEAV?
Rally some reinforcements.

889
01:28:02,193 --> 01:28:03,736
To the surface?
No, there's no time.

890
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:06,572
No, this idea's
way weirder than that.

891
01:31:35,656 --> 01:31:37,575
All right,
we're underneath the pyramids.

892
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:38,910
Now what?

893
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:40,870
Gravity.

894
01:31:40,953 --> 01:31:42,121
Iwi technology.

895
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,345
With the chemical reaction,

896
01:31:57,428 --> 01:31:59,889
this liquid metal becomes
an engineering mechanism

897
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:02,183
forcing the two
electromagnetic pyramids

898
01:32:02,266 --> 01:32:04,477
together, causing
an anti-gravity shock wave.

899
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,063
But only for a few minutes.
Or maybe less.

900
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:09,524
Which should keep those
things from the portals.

901
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:11,609
After that,
everything that is up

902
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:12,818
will come crashing down.

903
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:33,214
They're here.

904
01:32:58,114 --> 01:32:59,365
We're not gonna make it.
There's not enough time.

905
01:32:59,448 --> 01:33:00,575
We need something
to slow them down.

906
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:02,159
Yeah, but what else can we do?

907
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,955
It's vertacine mating season.

908
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:10,459
No way.

909
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:29,770
Your carriage awaits.

910
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:30,855
I'm gonna kiss you
on the mouth!

911
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:31,981
Come on. Go, go.

912
01:33:35,067 --> 01:33:36,944
Buckle up,
you beautiful people.

913
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:38,988
Up and away. Yes!

914
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:41,926
No! The engine's out.

915
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:43,344
The gravity surge
must have taken out

916
01:34:43,427 --> 01:34:45,346
the power-battery-thing.

917
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:24,051
Yes! Yes!

918
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:25,720
She's protecting the portals.

919
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:38,667
Oh, God!

920
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:50,471
Oh.

921
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:42,966
Look.

922
01:43:44,676 --> 01:43:47,054
Jia, you're safe! Come here.

923
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:06,573
Look, I...

924
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:38,480
"What am I talking a..."

925
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:52,703
I...

926
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:12,931
-You all right? Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

927
01:45:13,015 --> 01:45:14,725
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

928
01:45:32,284 --> 01:45:33,744
Thank you, thank you.

929
01:45:33,827 --> 01:45:35,037
Yeah, saving the world
is kind of our thing.
