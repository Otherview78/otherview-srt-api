1
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,239
There's a girl in this harbor town

2
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,367
And she works la yin' whiskey down

3
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:18,871
They say, "Brandy, fetch another round"

4
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,999
And she serves them whiskey and wine

5
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,212
The sailors say "Brandy, you're a fine girl"

6
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:30,174
"What a good wife you would be"

7
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,145
- Come on! - Slow down!

8
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,231
This way, my river lily! Come on!

9
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,193
Where are you taking me?

10
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,278
Come on, come on.

11
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,738
Look. Look!

12
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,865
Oh, it's beautiful!

13
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,034
I was afraid it wouldn't take to the soil...

14
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:58,536
but it rooted quickly.

15
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:01,289
And soon, it'll be everywhere.

16
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,500
All across the universe.

17
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,878
Well, I don't know what you're talking about...

18
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,630
but I like the way you say it.

19
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:11,465
My heart is yours...

20
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,218
Meredith Quill.

21
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:18,723
I can't believe I fell in love with a spaceman.

22
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,308
(MUSIC FADING UP, "BRANDY

23
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,486
Showtime, a-holes!

24
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,447
It will be here any minute.

25
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,366
Which will be its loss.

26
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:19,950
I thought your thing was a sword?

27
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,286
We've been hired to stop an inter dimensional beast...

28
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:25,122
from feeding on those batteries, and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

29
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,333
It's just, swords were your thing and guns were mine.

30
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,127
But I guess we're both doing guns now. I just didn't know that.

31
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:33,631
Drax, why aren't you wearing one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

32
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,132
It hurts.

33
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,175
It hurts?

34
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,470
I have sensitive nipples.

35
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,307
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"

36
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,059
What about him? What's he doing?

37
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:47,770
I'm finishing this so we can listen to tunes while we work.

38
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,146
How is that a priority?

39
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,690
Blame Quill. He's the one who loves music so much.

40
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,442
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

41
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:54,985
That's hardly important right now.

42
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,446
Oh, okay. Sure, Quill.

43
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,533
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

44
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:04,161
No, I understand that. You're being very serious right now.

45
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,372
I can clearly see you winking.

46
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,749
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

47
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,173
I am Groot.

48
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:18,426
They were not looking at you funny.

49
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,807
Well, that's intense.

50
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:28,204
Groot!

51
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,930
Groot, get out of the way! You're gonna get hurt!

52
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,097
Hi.

53
00:05:47,097 --> 00:06:17,097
Subtitle www.movieddl.me

54
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,809
No! Spit it out!

55
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:33,102
Come on!

56
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,523
Disgusting!

57
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,046
The beast's hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside.

58
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,256
I must cut through it from the inside.

59
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,382
Huh?

60
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,052
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

61
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,011
Drax!

62
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,189
What is he doing?

63
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:03,067
He said the skin is too thick to be pierced from the outside, so he...

64
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,069
- That doesn't make any sense! - I tried telling him that!

65
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,738
Skin is the same level of thickness from the inside as from the outside!

66
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,490
I realize that.

67
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,412
There is a cut on its neck.

68
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,790
Rocket, get it to look up.

69
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,711
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!

70
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,097
Watch it, Quill!

71
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,854
Yes! I have single-handedly...

72
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:24,148
vanquished the beast!

73
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,360
What?

74
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,705
What are they called again?

75
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,540
Anulax batteries.

76
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,042
Harbulary batteries.

77
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,503
That's nothing like what I just said.

78
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,338
But they're worth thousands of units apiece...

79
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,507
which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them.

80
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:54,219
Careful what you say around these folks. They're easily offended.

81
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,013
The cost of transgression is death.

82
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:01,477
We thank you, Guardians, for putting your lives on the line.

83
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:05,647
We could not risk the lives of our own Sovereign citizens.

84
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:10,235
Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community.

85
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,655
Impeccable, both physically and mentally.

86
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,074
We control the DNA of our progeny...

87
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,368
germinating them in birthing pods.

88
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,164
I guess I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.

89
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,709
Perhaps someday, you could give me a history lesson...

90
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,505
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

91
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,673
For academic purposes.

92
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,759
I would be honored, yes.

93
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,928
In the name of research...

94
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,597
I think that could be pretty, uh...

95
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,057
repulsive.

96
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,226
I'm not into that kind of casual...

97
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,519
Oh, please.

98
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,980
Your people promised something in exchange for our services.

99
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,440
Bring it...

100
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,234
and we shall gladly be on our way.

101
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,583
Family reunion. Yay.

102
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,211
I understand she is your sister.

103
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:13,549
She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.

104
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:18,220
Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries.

105
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,139
Do with her as you please.

106
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,436
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

107
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,398
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

108
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,069
My mother is from Earth.

109
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,154
And your father?

110
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,784
He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.

111
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,286
I see it within you.

112
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,998
An unorthodox genealogy.

113
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,419
A hybrid that seems particularly...

114
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,963
reckless.

115
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,050
You know, they told me you people were conceited douche bags...

116
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,470
but that isn't true at all.

117
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:05,642
Oh, shit.

118
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,978
I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I?

119
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,397
I'm sorry. That was meant to be behind your back.

120
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,151
Count yourself blessed they didn't kill you.

121
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,069
You're telling me.

122
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,447
You wanna buy some batteries?

123
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,586
All right, let's get baldy to Xandar

124
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,129
and collect that bounty.

125
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,392
That stuff about my father...

126
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,686
Who does she think she is?

127
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,146
I know you're sensitive about that.

128
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,399
I'm not sensitive about it. I just don't know who he is.

129
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:40,070
Sorry if it seemed like I was flirting with the High Priestess.

130
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,905
I wasn't.

131
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,199
I don't care if you were.

132
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,159
Well, I feel like you do care.

133
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,578
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!

134
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,956
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

135
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,000
Damn shadow.

136
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,210
There are two types of beings in the universe...

137
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,045
those who dance, and those who do not.

138
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:59,089
Mmm-hmm.

139
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,425
I first met my beloved at a war rally.

140
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,592
Oh, God.

141
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,512
Everyone in the village flailed about, dancing.

142
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,222
Except one woman.

143
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,057
My Ovette.

144
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,893
I knew immediately she was the one for me.

145
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,646
The most melodic song in the world could be playing.

146
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,566
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

147
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,527
Wouldn't move a muscle.

148
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,405
One might assume she was dead.

149
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,948
That does sound pretty hot.

150
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:28,201
It would make my nether regions engorge.

151
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,245
Okay. I get it, yes.

152
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,330
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

153
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,917
You just need to find a woman who is pathetic... like you.

154
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,253
Mmm.

155
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:44,176
I'm hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.

156
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,802
No. It's not ripe yet...

157
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,012
and I hate you.

158
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,472
You hate me?

159
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,349
You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself.

160
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,602
And yet here you stand, a hero.

161
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,563
I will be free of these shackles soon enough, and I will kill you.

162
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,315
I swear.

163
00:14:58,482 --> 00:14:59,608
No.

164
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,568
You're gonna live out the rest of your days

165
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,153
in a prison on Xandar...

166
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,654
wishing you could.

167
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,662
This is weird.

168
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,539
We've got a Sovereign fleet approaching from the rear.

169
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:15,707
Why would they do that?

170
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,334
Probably because Rocket stole some of their batteries.

171
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,376
Dude!

172
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,045
Right.

173
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,296
He didn't steal some of those.

174
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,131
I don't know why they're after us. What a mystery this is.

175
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,186
What were you thinking?

176
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,604
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

177
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,189
- That's your defense? - Come on!

178
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,650
You saw how that High Priestess talked down to us.

179
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,527
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

180
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,905
Oh, I didn't realize your motivation was altruism.

181
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,533
It's really a shame the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions...

182
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,201
- and they're trying to kill us. - Exactly!

183
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,120
I was being sarcastic!

184
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,371
Oh, no!

185
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:55,622
You're supposed to use a sarcastic voice!

186
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,748
Now I look foolish!

187
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,375
Can we put the bickering on hold...

188
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,585
until after we survive this massive space battle?

189
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,504
- More incoming! - Good!

190
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,172
I wanna kill some guys!

191
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,390
You're not killing anyone.

192
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,100
All those ships are remotely piloted.

193
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,479
Damn it!

194
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,159
What is the delay, Admiral?

195
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:36,413
High Priestess, the batteries, they are exceptionally combustible...

196
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,706
and could destroy the entire fleet.

197
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,584
Our concern is their slight against our people.

198
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,421
We hired them and they steal from us.

199
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,923
It is heresy of the highest order.

200
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,927
All command modules...

201
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,680
fire with the intent to kill.

202
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,816
What's the nearest habitable planet?

203
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,152
It's called Berhert.

204
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,029
- How many jumps? - Only one.

205
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:12,199
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

206
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,202
And you have to go through that quantum asteroid field.

207
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,962
Quill, to make it through that...

208
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,672
you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.

209
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,882
Lucky for us, I...

210
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,467
I am.

211
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:43,980
What are you doing?

212
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,316
I've been flying this rig since I was 10 years old.

213
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,402
I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft.

214
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,322
You were cybernetically engineered to be a douche bag!

215
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:53,782
Stop it.

216
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,659
Later on tonight, you're gonna be laying down in your bed...

217
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,827
and there's gonna be something squishy in your pillow case.

218
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,246
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"

219
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,164
And it's gonna be because I put a turd in there!

220
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,085
You put your turd in my bed, I shave you.

221
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,795
Oh, it won't be my turd.

222
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,338
It will be Drax's.

223
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,634
I have famously huge turds.

224
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,512
We're about to die, and this is what we're discussing?

225
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,015
Son of a...

226
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,600
Dude! Seriously!

227
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,185
Hey! Let me...

228
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:37,909
Idiots!

229
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,119
Well, that's what you get

230
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,620
when Quill flies.

231
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,289
Ow!

232
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,708
We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.

233
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,462
Our weapons are down.

234
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,715
20 clicks to the jump!

235
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:55,552
Hold on.

236
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,106
It's not ripe.

237
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,199
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

238
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,413
Yes!

239
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,583
15 clicks to the jump!

240
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,209
Come on!

241
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,462
Keep going!

242
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:45,935
10 clicks!

243
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,316
Die, spaceship!

244
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,405
You suck, Zylak.

245
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:58,615
Typical.

246
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:02,243
Five clicks!

247
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,626
Son of a...

248
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,920
They went around the field!

249
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,478
Someone destroyed all our ships!

250
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:29,896
What?

251
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,567
Who?

252
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,028
One click!

253
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,989
- What is that? - Who cares?

254
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,449
That's the jump point! Go!

255
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,913
It's a guy.

256
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:54,879
Oh, my God.

257
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,464
He's still out there?

258
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,785
Groot, put your seat belt on!

259
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,872
Prepare for a really bad landing!

260
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,539
That was awesome!

261
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,917
Yes!

262
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,378
Look at this!

263
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,714
Where is the other half of our ship?

264
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:20,882
My ship.

265
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:24,761
Either one of you could have gotten us through that field...

266
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,095
had you flown with what's between your ears

267
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,639
instead of what's between your legs!

268
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:31,142
If what's between my legs had a hand on it...

269
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,436
I guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.

270
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,231
Peter, we almost died because of your arrogance.

271
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,066
More like because he stole...

272
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,317
the Anulax batteries!

273
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,778
They're called Harbulary batteries.

274
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,571
No, they're not!

275
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,406
Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch? Hmm?

276
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,617
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

277
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,702
I did it because I wanted to!

278
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:50,537
Dick.

279
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,580
What are we even talking about this for?

280
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,250
We just had a little man save us by blowing up 50 ships!

281
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,292
How little?

282
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,628
Well, I don't know, like this?

283
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,463
A little one-inch man saved us?

284
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,799
Well, if he got closer, I'm sure he would be much larger.

285
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,301
That's how eyesight works, you stupid raccoon.

286
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:06,803
Don't call me a raccoon!

287
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,639
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

288
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:11,766
I meant trash panda.

289
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,311
Is that better?

290
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,564
I don't know.

291
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,941
It's worse. It's so much worse.

292
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,359
You son of a...

293
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:22,235
Hey!

294
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,736
- I've had it with you! - No! Back up!

295
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,572
Someone followed you through the jump point.

296
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,867
Set me free, you'll need my help.

297
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,160
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

298
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,204
You are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.

299
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,539
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.

300
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:35,707
No, I won't.

301
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:39,168
You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.

302
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,296
I bet it's the one-inch man.

303
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,873
After all these years, I've found you.

304
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,375
And who the hell are you?

305
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,463
I figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious.

306
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,883
My name is Ego...

307
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,636
and I'm your dad, Peter.

308
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,654
You know what they say...

309
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,740
"You're out of luck until you've gone duck."

310
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:18,935
Yondu!

311
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,604
Come on down!

312
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,410
After going around years in circles...

313
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,453
with this woman I end up marrying.

314
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,289
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

315
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,874
"but you're losing your mind!"

316
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,001
Then again, she's always been that way.

317
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,962
I could never trust her. You know?

318
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,130
Stakar.

319
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,094
It's been some time.

320
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:01,185
It seems like this establishment is the wrong kind of disreputable.

321
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,234
- Sir! - Stakar!

322
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,820
There's a hundred Ravager factions.

323
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:13,948
You lost the business of 99 of them by serving one.

324
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,658
Please, sir. Please!

325
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,076
Get away from me.

326
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:25,334
You can go to hell then!

327
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,628
I don't give a damn what you think of me!

328
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,839
So what are you following us for?

329
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,340
Because you're gonna listen to what I gotta say!

330
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:32,967
I don't gotta listen to nothing!

331
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,343
You betrayed the code!

332
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,345
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

333
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,348
I told you before! I didn't know what was going on!

334
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:40,475
You didn't know because

335
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,059
you didn't want to know because it made you rich.

336
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,395
I demand a seat at the table!

337
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,564
I wear these flames, same as you.

338
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:48,816
You may dress like us...

339
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,360
but you'll never hear the Horns of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

340
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,446
And the Colors of Ogord...

341
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:56,991
will never flash over your grave.

342
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,660
If you think...

343
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,040
I take pleasure in exiling you...

344
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,418
you're wrong.

345
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,547
You broke all our hearts.

346
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:28,564
Ah, pathetic.

347
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,692
First, Quill betrays us...

348
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:35,112
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

349
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,449
We followed him because he was the one...

350
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:41,035
who wasn't afraid to do what needed to be done.

351
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:43,496
Seems he's goin' soft.

352
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,499
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?

353
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,918
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

354
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:53,464
You best be very careful what you say about our captain.

355
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:55,258
Who the hell is that?

356
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,966
Yondu Udonta...

357
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,802
I have a proposition for you.

358
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,388
I hired Yondu to pick you up...

359
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,682
when your mother passed away.

360
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:46,642
But instead of returning you...

361
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:48,644
Yondu kept you.

362
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,397
I have no clue as to why.

363
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,983
Well, I'll tell you why.

364
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,568
Because I was a skinny little kid

365
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,236
who could squeeze into places adults couldn't.

366
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,821
It made it easier for thievin'.

367
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:02,283
Well, I've been trying to track you down ever since.

368
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,410
I thought Yondu was your father.

369
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,621
What? We've been together this whole time...

370
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,582
and you thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?

371
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,000
You look exactly alike.

372
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,793
One's blue!

373
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,088
No, he's not my father!

374
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,716
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...

375
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,676
kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight...

376
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,845
and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.

377
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,347
- Eat you? - Yeah.

378
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,515
Oh, that son of a bitch.

379
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,059
How'd you locate us now?

380
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,854
Well, even where I reside, out past the edge of what's known...

381
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:34,440
we've heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord.

382
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,984
What say we head out there right now?

383
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:39,320
Your associates are welcome. Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

384
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:41,864
I promise you...

385
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,367
it's unlike any other place you've ever seen.

386
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:46,369
And there...

387
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:50,539
I can explain your very special heritage.

388
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,668
Finally get to be...

389
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,545
the father I've always wanted to be.

390
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,507
Excuse me.

391
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,384
I've gotta take a whiz.

392
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,266
I'm not buying it.

393
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,187
Let's go take a walk.

394
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,404
I am Mantis.

395
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:26,575
What are you doing?

396
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,244
Smiling.

397
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:31,539
I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.

398
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,750
Not if you do it like that.

399
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,293
Oh...

400
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,921
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

401
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:43,801
I do not understand the intricacies of social interaction.

402
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,849
Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.

403
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:53,728
Yes.

404
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:06,657
That is called a practical joke!

405
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,954
I liked it very much!

406
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,789
I just made it up!

407
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,626
Give me a break!

408
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:19,545
After all this time,

409
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,047
you're gonna show up, and all of a sudden...

410
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,923
- you wanna be my dad? - I hear you.

411
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:25,176
And by the way, this could be a trap.

412
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:26,886
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

413
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,721
- they all want us dead. - I know, but...

414
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:29,847
But what?

415
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,308
What was that story you told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?

416
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,434
Who?

417
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:34,852
He owned a magic boat?

418
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:38,147
David Hasselhoff?

419
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:39,148
Right.

420
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:41,400
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

421
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,485
Why did he talk again?

422
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:46,238
To help him fight crime, and to be supportive.

423
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,991
As a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket...

424
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:50,910
and you would tell all the other children...

425
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,245
that he was your father, but that he was out of town.

426
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:55,915
Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany.

427
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:58,417
I told you that when I was drunk. Why are you bringing that up now?

428
00:31:58,501 --> 00:31:59,585
I love that story.

429
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,712
I hate that story.

430
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:03,339
It's so sad!

431
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:08,511
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids off playing catch with their dad.

432
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:11,347
And I wanted that, more than anything in the world!

433
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:13,808
That's my point, Peter.

434
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:17,478
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

435
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,358
If he ends up being evil...

436
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,402
we will just kill him.

437
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,037
You're leaving me with that fox?

438
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:36,330
He's not a fox.

439
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:38,541
Shoot her if she does anything suspicious.

440
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,002
- Or if you feel like it. - Okay.

441
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:45,548
It'll be just a couple of days.

442
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,551
We'll be back before Rocket's finished fixing the ship.

443
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,639
What if the Sovereign come?

444
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,891
There's no way for them to know we're here. Let's go.

445
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,643
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

446
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,395
God, you're like an old woman.

447
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:01,230
Because I'm wise?

448
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,150
Why do you have so much luggage?

449
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,485
I don't want Groot playing with my things.

450
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:12,116
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.

451
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:17,955
What is your goal here? To get everybody to hate you?

452
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,916
Because it's working.

453
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:29,550
And if you don't love me now You will never love me again

454
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:35,764
I can still hear you saying You would never break the chain

455
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,934
And if you don't love me now

456
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:42,188
You will never love me again

457
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:46,275
I can still hear you saying

458
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,444
You would never break the chain

459
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:51,780
And if you don't love me now

460
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,617
You will never love me again

461
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,786
I can still hear you saying

462
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:01,373
You would never break the chain

463
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,341
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

464
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:11,759
Oh...

465
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,470
No one has ever asked me a personal question.

466
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,388
Your antennae, what are they for?

467
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,140
Their purpose?

468
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,142
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

469
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:22,394
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

470
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:24,480
I say...

471
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:27,024
if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low...

472
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:29,985
your antennae will feel this, and keep you from being decapitated.

473
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,321
Right. And if it's anything other than...

474
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:35,866
you specifically not being decapitated by a doorway, I win.

475
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,535
They are not for feeling doorways.

476
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,413
I think...

477
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,333
they have something to do with my empathic abilities.

478
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:45,876
What are those?

479
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:49,546
If I touch someone, I can feel their feelings.

480
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,466
- You read minds? - No.

481
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:54,927
Telepaths know thoughts.

482
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,513
Empaths feel feelings.

483
00:34:58,681 --> 00:34:59,682
Emotions.

484
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:03,477
May I?

485
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,021
All right.

486
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,740
You feel love.

487
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:21,412
Yeah. I guess I feel a general, unselfish love for just about everybody.

488
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:22,705
No!

489
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,707
Romantic, sexual love.

490
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,333
No, I don't.

491
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,085
- For her! - No!

492
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:32,673
Okay.

493
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:37,886
She just told everyone your deepest, darkest secret!

494
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,347
Dude, I think you're overreacting a little bit!

495
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:41,849
You must be so embarrassed!

496
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,563
Do me! Do me!

497
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,863
I have never felt such humor!

498
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,410
So unbelievably uncool.

499
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,204
Oh, Quill.

500
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,502
Touch me, and the only thing you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

501
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:19,511
I can also alter emotions to some extent.

502
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,679
Yeah, like what?

503
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:24,683
If I touch someone who is sad...

504
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,519
I can ease them into contentment for a short while.

505
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,565
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

506
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:34,777
But I mostly use it to help my master sleep.

507
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:38,781
He lies awake at night thinking about his progeny.

508
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,117
Do one of those on me.

509
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,290
Sleep.

510
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,678
I love this song.

511
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:13,292
Huh?

512
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:15,752
There!

513
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:28,390
Ah...

514
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,710
Ain't so tough now without all your toys...

515
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,004
are you?

516
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,049
Move!

517
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:01,942
Crap.

518
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:08,991
Hey there, rat!

519
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:11,493
How's it going, you blue idiot?

520
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:14,037
Not so bad.

521
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:16,582
We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here.

522
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,585
This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself...

523
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:23,672
has offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals over to her...

524
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:24,798
because she wants

525
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,425
to kill y'all.

526
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:27,843
Your friend...

527
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,678
There's too many of them.

528
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:33,056
He needs my help. If you care about him...

529
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,851
you need to get me out of these bonds.

530
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,353
They are going to kill him!

531
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,689
I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.

532
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:42,774
I put a tracer on your ship back there...

533
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,276
during the war over Xandar.

534
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:47,195
Give me your word you won't hurt Groot...

535
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,239
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.

536
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,492
Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.

537
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,203
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

538
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,705
Otherwise, you'd what?

539
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,416
We'll take them batteries.

540
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:03,045
They're worth what? A quarter mill on the open market?

541
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,505
That Priestess offered us a million.

542
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:08,425
A quarter is only one third of that!

543
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:09,718
A quarter ain't a third.

544
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:11,678
A quarter is 25.

545
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:12,846
No.

546
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:15,307
We can't even buy a pair of boots with 25 units.

547
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:16,475
Enough!

548
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:21,480
The point is, we ain't stupid enough to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

549
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,358
The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.

550
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,069
That ain't right!

551
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,280
I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.

552
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:32,741
No matter how many times Quill betrays you...

553
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:35,786
you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!

554
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:36,953
Yeah!

555
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,622
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

556
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:39,748
Take it easy, Kraglin.

557
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,417
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

558
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:45,629
Suppose it's time for a change in leadership.

559
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:53,011
Put your damn guns down!

560
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,429
Whoa! Whoa!

561
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:58,058
There must be some kind of peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

562
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:00,936
Or even a violent one where I'm standing over there.

563
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,748
Well, hello, boys.

564
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:29,005
It's not ripe.

565
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,262
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

566
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,848
Wow. You have your own planet?

567
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:23,727
Come on. No larger than your Earth's Moon.

568
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,437
Humility.

569
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:26,980
I like it.

570
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,733
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

571
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:16,363
You own a planet and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit.

572
00:44:16,947 --> 00:44:18,740
What are you exactly?

573
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:23,161
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.

574
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,998
A Celestial, like a god?

575
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,752
Mmm, small "g," son.

576
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:33,713
At least on the days I'm feeling humble as Drax.

577
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:46,059
Whoa!

578
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:51,481
I don't know where I came from exactly.

579
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:53,608
First thing I remember is flickering...

580
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:56,069
adrift in the cosmos utterly...

581
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,531
and entirely alone.

582
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:02,534
Over millions of years...

583
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:06,288
I learned to control the molecules around me.

584
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,708
I grew smarter and stronger.

585
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:14,713
And I continued building from there...

586
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,007
layer by layer...

587
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:19,759
the very planet you walk on now.

588
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,219
Whoa.

589
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:22,971
But I wanted more.

590
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,849
I desired...

591
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:27,475
meaning.

592
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:32,647
"There must be some life out there in the universe...

593
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:35,567
"besides just me," I thought.

594
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:39,779
And so, I set myself the task of finding it.

595
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:41,573
I created...

596
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,368
what I imagined biological life to be like...

597
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:49,289
down to the most minute detail.

598
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:51,750
Did you make a penis?

599
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:53,126
Dude!

600
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:54,502
What is wrong with you?

601
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,672
If he is a planet, how could he make a baby with your mother?

602
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:58,840
He would smush her!

603
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,261
I don't need to hear how my parents...

604
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:05,513
Why?

605
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:07,891
My father would tell the story

606
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,893
of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.

607
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,478
That's disgusting.

608
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:13,063
It was beautiful.

609
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:15,857
You Earthers have hang-ups.

610
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:18,485
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

611
00:46:18,735 --> 00:46:20,362
Ha! Thank you!

612
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:21,655
It's not half bad.

613
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:23,239
- Oh. - Ugh.

614
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:27,035
I've also got pain receptors, and a digestive system...

615
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:28,954
and all the accompanying junk.

616
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:34,084
I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human...

617
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,253
as I set out amongst the stars...

618
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:40,131
until I found...

619
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:41,967
what I sought.

620
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:44,719
Life.

621
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:48,765
I was not alone in the universe after all.

622
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,399
When did you meet my mother?

623
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,238
Not long after.

624
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:13,665
It was with Meredith that I first experienced love.

625
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,755
I called her my river lily.

626
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,512
And from that love, Peter...

627
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:32,350
you.

628
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:43,153
I have searched for you for so long.

629
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,448
And when I heard of a man from Earth...

630
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:50,368
who held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying...

631
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,081
I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved.

632
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:59,085
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

633
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:22,025
This is mutiny!

634
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,153
This is mutiny!

635
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,822
This is mutiny!

636
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,044
You're scum!

637
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:45,965
Oh!

638
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,622
Captain!

639
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:20,375
Help me! Please!

640
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:22,085
Captain!

641
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,048
You're the one what killed those men...

642
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:29,425
by leading them down the wrong path.

643
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:31,970
Because you're weak.

644
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,974
And stupid!

645
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,061
It's time for the Ravagers...

646
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:43,940
to rise once again to glory with a new captain...

647
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,442
Taserface!

648
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:57,787
I'm sorry. Your name is...

649
00:49:57,954 --> 00:49:59,581
It's Taserface?

650
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,416
That's right.

651
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:04,085
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

652
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,546
It's metaphorical!

653
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:07,547
Yeah!

654
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:12,177
For what?

655
00:50:14,596 --> 00:50:17,182
For it is a name what strikes fear...

656
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:20,101
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

657
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,022
Okay.

658
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:25,899
Okay...

659
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,233
whatever you say.

660
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,068
You shut up.

661
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,445
You're next.

662
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:34,699
Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...

663
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:35,783
What?

664
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,079
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

665
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:43,291
I just keep imagining you waking up in the morning, sir...

666
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:46,502
looking in the mirror and then in all seriousness saying to yourself...

667
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:49,130
"You know what would be a really kick-ass name?

668
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,549
"Taserface!"

669
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:55,220
That's how I hear you in my head!

670
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,264
What was your second choice?

671
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,266
Scrotum Hat?

672
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:05,188
New plan. We're killing you first.

673
00:51:06,648 --> 00:51:09,692
Well, dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life...

674
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:13,821
as a moronic shit bag who thinks Taserface is a cool name.

675
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:16,824
That's enough killing for today.

676
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,497
She's the daughter of Thanos.

677
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,876
I thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy.

678
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:29,879
That was when Daddy was paying my bills.

679
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:33,675
The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself.

680
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:36,678
And he has bounties on his head in at least 12 Kree provinces.

681
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:39,847
I assure you...

682
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,850
I am not as easy a mark as an old man without his magic stick...

683
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,852
or a talking woodland beast.

684
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:48,064
I want 10% of the take...

685
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:51,526
and a couple more things.

686
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:54,988
We got a whole box of hands...

687
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,990
- if that one don't work out. - It is fine.

688
00:51:57,156 --> 00:52:00,368
You think them Kree is gonna execute the captain?

689
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:04,747
The Kree consider themselves merciful. It will be painless.

690
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:08,376
Well, here it is. It's the best ship we got.

691
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:10,211
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

692
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:12,672
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

693
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:14,966
What are you gonna do with your share?

694
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,177
As a child, my father would have Gamora and me

695
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:20,096
battle one another in training.

696
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,182
Every time my sister prevailed...

697
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:26,686
my father would replace a piece of me with machinery...

698
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:29,522
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

699
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:32,442
But she won...

700
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:37,447
again and again, and again, never once refraining.

701
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,409
So after I murder my sister...

702
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:42,702
I will buy a warship

703
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:44,787
with every conceivable instrument of death.

704
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:48,583
I will hunt my father like a dog, and I will tear him apart slowly...

705
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,209
piece by piece...

706
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:53,755
until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain...

707
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:57,050
I know every single day.

708
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:00,261
Yeah.

709
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:02,472
I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace.

710
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:05,224
Or a nice hat.

711
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:08,102
Something to make the other girls go, "Ooh, that's nice!"

712
00:53:12,065 --> 00:53:15,276
Anyways, happy trails.

713
00:53:23,076 --> 00:53:26,537
My mother told everyone my father was from the stars.

714
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:30,792
She had brain cancer, so everyone thought she was delusional.

715
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,001
Peter...

716
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:33,920
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this, I really would.

717
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:35,463
But you left...

718
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:38,424
the most wonderful woman ever...

719
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:40,134
to die alone.

720
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:43,721
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.

721
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:46,057
If I don't return regularly to my planet...

722
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:47,600
and the light within it...

723
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:49,310
this form will wither and perish.

724
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:51,479
So why didn't you come back? Why did you send Yondu?

725
00:53:51,646 --> 00:53:53,564
A criminal, of all people, to come and fetch me?

726
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:55,942
I loved your mother, Peter!

727
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:58,486
I couldn't stand to set foot on an Earth...

728
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:01,489
where she wasn't living! You can't imagine what that's like!

729
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:04,033
I know exactly what that feels like!

730
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,952
I had to watch her die!

731
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:14,460
Over the millions and millions of years of my existence...

732
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:17,130
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

733
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:20,174
But you're not one of them.

734
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:25,721
Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be.

735
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:35,731
There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet...

736
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,567
and the light within.

737
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:41,112
They are a part of you, Peter.

738
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,656
What do you mean?

739
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,367
Give me your hands, son.

740
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:48,494
Here.

741
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,247
Hold them like that.

742
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:00,047
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.

743
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:04,177
Take your brain to the center of this planet.

744
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:09,932
Yes!

745
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:10,933
Yes!

746
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,060
Whoa!

747
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,604
Yes! It's okay.

748
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:15,855
Just relax. Concentrate.

749
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:18,107
You can do it. Bring it back.

750
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:19,775
Yes!

751
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:24,197
Yes, now shape it.

752
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:26,240
Feel that energy.

753
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:31,412
Yes.

754
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,043
You're home.

755
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:40,755
Peter...

756
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:18,167
How did you get to this weird, dumb planet?

757
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:21,671
Ego found me in my larva state.

758
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:23,297
Orphaned on my homeworld.

759
00:56:24,257 --> 00:56:26,801
He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own.

760
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:29,679
So you're a pet?

761
00:56:30,972 --> 00:56:32,265
I suppose.

762
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:36,143
People usually want cute pets.

763
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,604
Why would Ego want such a hideous one?

764
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:40,064
I am hideous?

765
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:42,400
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

766
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:46,654
But that's a good thing.

767
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:47,822
Oh?

768
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:49,865
When you're ugly, and someone loves you...

769
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:52,493
you know they love you for who you are.

770
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:56,205
Beautiful people never know who to trust.

771
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:00,001
Well, then I'm certainly grateful to be ugly.

772
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:04,672
Those pools, they remind me of a time...

773
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:08,342
when I took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

774
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:10,845
She was like you.

775
00:57:11,304 --> 00:57:12,763
Disgusting?

776
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:15,016
Innocent.

777
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:49,216
Drax?

778
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,511
There's something I must tell you.

779
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,063
What's going on?

780
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,106
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

781
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:07,693
I'm learning many things, like I'm a pet and ugly.

782
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:09,612
You're not ugly. Drax!

783
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:11,072
What are you talking about?

784
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,406
Mantis...

785
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:14,909
can you show us where we'll be staying?

786
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,286
Why are there no other beings on this planet?

787
00:58:17,453 --> 00:58:19,538
The planet is Ego.

788
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,916
A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back.

789
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:23,918
And you're not a flea?

790
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:26,420
I'm a flea with a purpose.

791
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:28,631
I help him sleep.

792
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:32,968
What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?

793
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:39,100
Nothing.

794
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:41,936
Your quarters are this way.

795
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,988
We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.

796
00:58:55,408 --> 00:58:58,452
Neither one of you will last much longer after that.

797
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:01,163
Okay, Taserface.

798
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:03,999
Hey, tell the other guys we said...

799
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,543
"Hi," Taserface!

800
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:13,259
What about this little plant? Can I smash it with a rock?

801
00:59:13,426 --> 00:59:14,969
No, Gef.

802
00:59:15,136 --> 00:59:16,804
It's too adorable to kill.

803
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:18,806
Take it to the tailor.

804
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:23,644
No offense, but your employees are a bunch of jerks.

805
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:30,860
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years when Stakar freed me.

806
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:36,157
He offered me a place with the Ravagers.

807
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:40,703
He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code.

808
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,663
But I was young...

809
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:47,084
and greedy, and stupid.

810
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,171
Like you stealing those batteries.

811
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:51,839
That was mostly Drax.

812
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:56,844
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

813
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:00,139
we weren't so different from you and your friends.

814
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,017
The only family I ever had.

815
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:06,103
When I broke the code...

816
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,024
they exiled me.

817
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:12,818
This is what I deserve.

818
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:14,695
Slow down, drama queen.

819
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:16,530
You might deserve this, but I don't.

820
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:18,449
We gotta get outta here.

821
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:21,035
Where's Quill?

822
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:22,745
He went off with his old man.

823
01:00:24,497 --> 01:00:26,207
- Ego? - Yeah.

824
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,334
It's a day for dumb-ass names.

825
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,839
You're smiling. And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

826
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:36,759
But then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth.

827
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:39,303
You like a professional asshole or what?

828
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,471
Pretty much a pro.

829
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:43,224
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised?

830
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:45,601
He was skinny.

831
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:50,105
Could fit into places we couldn't. Good for thievin'.

832
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:51,607
Uh-huh.

833
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,239
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

834
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:01,700
But we're gonna need your little friend.

835
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:05,246
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

836
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:18,676
Little fellow's all worked up! He needs a drink!

837
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:27,476
Look how cute it is when it's all riled up.

838
01:01:27,643 --> 01:01:29,520
He's goddang precious!

839
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:43,284
Psst!

840
01:01:43,576 --> 01:01:45,286
Hey, twig!

841
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:46,996
Come here.

842
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:48,706
Come on.

843
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:56,297
Aw, man...

844
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:57,923
what did they do to you?

845
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,470
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?

846
01:02:04,305 --> 01:02:07,516
There's something I need you to get, and bring back to me.

847
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:11,729
In the captain's quarters, there's a prototype fin...

848
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:13,522
the thing I wore on my head.

849
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:18,277
There's a drawer next to the bunk. It's in that. It's red.

850
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:19,778
You got it?

851
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,980
That's my underwears.

852
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:57,191
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know what you were talkin' about.

853
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:59,401
You have to explain it more careful.

854
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:04,365
It's a prototype fin.

855
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:12,581
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

856
01:03:12,748 --> 01:03:14,375
You explain it this time.

857
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:17,044
All right.

858
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:19,755
That's Vorker's eye.

859
01:03:19,922 --> 01:03:21,924
He takes it out when he sleeps.

860
01:03:22,091 --> 01:03:23,425
Go. Look again.

861
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:25,010
But leave the eye here.

862
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:26,470
Why?

863
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:28,013
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

864
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,557
and he's not gonna know...

865
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:32,977
where his eye is!

866
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,734
That's a desk.

867
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:43,612
We told you it was this big.

868
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,745
Tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere...

869
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:54,623
with a bunch of severed human toes.

870
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:58,419
Okay. Then let's just agree to never discuss this.

871
01:04:01,672 --> 01:04:05,342
The drawer you wanna open has this symbol on it.

872
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:06,885
Okay?

873
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:17,271
What? No!

874
01:04:17,438 --> 01:04:18,564
He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.

875
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:20,024
That's not what I said!

876
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,191
I am Groot.

877
01:04:21,275 --> 01:04:22,317
He's relieved you don't want him to.

878
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:23,944
- I am Groot. - He hates hats.

879
01:04:24,111 --> 01:04:24,820
I am Groot.

880
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:26,155
On anyone, not just himself.

881
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:27,156
I am Groot.

882
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,158
One minute you think someone has a weird-shaped head...

883
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:31,660
the next minute it's just because you realize part of that head is the hat.

884
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:33,495
That's why you don't like hats?

885
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:36,957
This is an important conversation right now?

886
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:14,661
That ain't it.

887
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:26,048
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

888
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:30,928
They killed all my friends.

889
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:37,476
Get the third quadrant ready for release.

890
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,025
One more thing.

891
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:49,363
You got any clones of Quill's old music on the ship?

892
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:33,574
Ah.

893
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,165
He's got it!

894
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:42,833
Yondu's got the fin!

895
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,917
Go!

896
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:26,293
Down there!

897
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:51,985
Oh!

898
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:26,538
You maniac.

899
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,751
The whole ship's gonna blow.

900
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:42,262
Not the whole ship.

901
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:00,280
Who is this?

902
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:04,701
I am sending you the coordinates for Yondu's ship.

903
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:07,079
- Release the quadrant! - Aye, Captain!

904
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:09,748
I only ask one thing.

905
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:11,875
That your High Priestess...

906
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:15,504
tell him the name of the man what sealed his fate.

907
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:19,716
Taserface!

908
01:10:42,072 --> 01:10:43,323
Where to, Captain?

909
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:44,491
Ego.

910
01:10:46,118 --> 01:10:47,160
No, boy!

911
01:10:55,043 --> 01:10:59,589
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

912
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:00,715
I know that.

913
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:03,260
We are about to do 700!

914
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:19,234
So I guess this could all be mine someday.

915
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,113
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

916
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,080
What are you doing, Peter?

917
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:35,667
Dance with me.

918
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:37,377
I'm not going to dance with you.

919
01:11:37,544 --> 01:11:39,296
This is Sam Cooke...

920
01:11:39,838 --> 01:11:43,008
one of the greatest Earth singers of all time.

921
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:14,164
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

922
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:17,834
If you ever tell anyone about this...

923
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:19,419
I will kill you.

924
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:24,049
When are we gonna do something about this unspoken thing between us?

925
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,092
What unspoken thing?

926
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:29,221
This...

927
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:32,182
Cheers, Sam and Diane...

928
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:34,935
a guy and a girl on a TV show who dig each other...

929
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,478
but never say it because if they do,

930
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:37,646
the ratings would go down...

931
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:38,897
sort of thing.

932
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:40,482
There's no unspoken thing.

933
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,444
Well, it's a catch-22, because if you said it,

934
01:12:44,528 --> 01:12:45,695
then it would be spoken...

935
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:48,615
and you would be a liar. So, by not saying it...

936
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:52,911
you are telling the truth, and admitting that there is.

937
01:12:53,078 --> 01:12:54,996
No, that's not what I...

938
01:12:57,332 --> 01:13:01,378
What we should be discussing right now is something about this place.

939
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:03,255
It doesn't feel right.

940
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:05,966
What are you talking about?

941
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:07,384
You're the one who wanted me to come here!

942
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:08,802
That girl Mantis...

943
01:13:08,969 --> 01:13:10,053
she's afraid of something.

944
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:12,514
Why are you trying to take this away from me?

945
01:13:12,764 --> 01:13:13,890
I'm not trying...

946
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:15,976
He's my father. He's blood.

947
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,852
You have blood on Earth and you never wanted to return there.

948
01:13:17,978 --> 01:13:20,063
Again, you made me come here!

949
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,148
And Earth is the place where my mother died in front of me.

950
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:24,943
No, it's because that place is real, and this is a fantasy.

951
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:27,862
This is real! I'm only half human, remember?

952
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:29,322
That's the half I'm worried about.

953
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:31,700
Oh, I get it. You're jealous...

954
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:34,202
because I'm part-god, and you like when I'm the weak one.

955
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:36,871
You were insufferable to begin with.

956
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:38,206
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

957
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:39,708
I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna try and get a signal.

958
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:42,836
You know what? This is not Cheers after all!

959
01:13:43,003 --> 01:13:45,839
This is whatever the show is where one person is willing...

960
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:47,716
to open themselves up to new possibility,

961
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:49,467
and the other person is a jerk...

962
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:51,428
who doesn't trust anybody!

963
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:53,263
It's a show that doesn't exist.

964
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,848
That's why it would get zero ratings!

965
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:57,475
I don't know what Cheers is!

966
01:13:57,684 --> 01:14:00,645
I finally found my family. Don't you understand that?

967
01:14:01,896 --> 01:14:03,523
I thought you already had.

968
01:14:33,053 --> 01:14:34,262
Damn it.

969
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:08,421
Psychopath!

970
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:20,553
Are you kidding me?

971
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:47,831
I win.

972
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:50,792
I win. I bested you in combat.

973
01:17:50,959 --> 01:17:52,877
No. I saved your life.

974
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:54,879
Well, you were stupid enough to let me live.

975
01:17:55,046 --> 01:17:55,922
You let me live!

976
01:17:56,089 --> 01:17:57,966
I don't need you always trying to beat me!

977
01:17:58,132 --> 01:17:59,467
I'm not the one that just flew across the universe

978
01:17:59,551 --> 01:18:00,760
just because I wanted to win.

979
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:02,554
Do not tell me what I want.

980
01:18:02,637 --> 01:18:04,055
I don't need to tell you what you want!

981
01:18:04,222 --> 01:18:05,223
It's obvious!

982
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:08,351
You were the one who wanted to win. And I just wanted a sister!

983
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:17,777
You were all I had.

984
01:18:19,112 --> 01:18:21,781
But you were the one who needed to win.

985
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:25,326
Thanos pulled my eye from my head...

986
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:28,121
and my brain from my skull...

987
01:18:29,289 --> 01:18:31,165
and my arm from my body...

988
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,919
because of you.

989
01:18:55,857 --> 01:18:56,941
You all right, son?

990
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,947
I saw your girl stomp off a little earlier in quite a huff.

991
01:19:03,615 --> 01:19:04,949
Yeah.

992
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:06,826
It's fortuitous...

993
01:19:06,993 --> 01:19:08,244
you listening to this song.

994
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:09,954
- You know... - Brandy?

995
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:11,497
By Looking Glass?

996
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:14,667
A favorite of your mom's.

997
01:19:15,627 --> 01:19:17,170
Yeah, it was.

998
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:19,172
One of Earth's greatest musical compositions.

999
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:21,507
Perhaps its very greatest.

1000
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:22,675
Yes!

1001
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:25,970
Peter, you and I, we're the sailor in that song.

1002
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:30,016
He came on a summer's day

1003
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:32,977
Bringing gifts from far away

1004
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:37,523
Like the child I put in your mother...

1005
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,609
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

1006
01:19:41,778 --> 01:19:44,781
Brandy, you're a fine girl

1007
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:47,617
What a good wife you would be

1008
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:51,371
My life, my love

1009
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:54,791
My lady is the sea

1010
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:56,793
The sea calls the sailor back.

1011
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,462
He loves the girl, but that's not his place.

1012
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:04,217
The sea calls upon him as history calls upon great men.

1013
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:08,930
And sometimes we are deprived the pleasures of mortals.

1014
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:11,683
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

1015
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:12,976
No, Peter...

1016
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:15,061
death will remain a stranger to both of us...

1017
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:17,647
as long as the light burns within the planet.

1018
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:19,732
I'm immortal?

1019
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:21,234
Mmm-hmm.

1020
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:23,069
Really?

1021
01:20:23,236 --> 01:20:26,072
Yes! As long as the light exists.

1022
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:30,326
And I can use the light to build cool things...

1023
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:32,787
like how you made this whole planet?

1024
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:35,331
It might take you a few million years of practice...

1025
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:37,750
before you get really good at it. But, yes!

1026
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:38,918
What!

1027
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:42,672
Get ready for an 800-foot statue of Pac-Man with Skeletor...

1028
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:43,881
and Heather Locklear.

1029
01:20:44,048 --> 01:20:45,216
You can do anything you want.

1030
01:20:45,383 --> 01:20:46,676
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

1031
01:20:46,843 --> 01:20:50,013
But you know, Peter, it is a tremendous responsibility.

1032
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:52,682
Only we can remake the universe.

1033
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:55,309
Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos...

1034
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:58,312
and lead it to where it needs to go.

1035
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,523
How?

1036
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:12,368
Come with me.

1037
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:23,963
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1038
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,965
Drax! We need to talk.

1039
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:29,969
I'm sorry.

1040
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:32,305
But I like a woman with some meat on her bones.

1041
01:21:32,472 --> 01:21:33,556
What?

1042
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:36,976
I tried to let you down easily by telling you I found you disgusting.

1043
01:21:37,143 --> 01:21:38,519
No, that's not what I...

1044
01:21:42,106 --> 01:21:43,524
What are you doing?

1045
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:46,486
I'm imagining being with you physically.

1046
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:47,945
Drax...

1047
01:21:48,488 --> 01:21:49,655
I don't like you like that.

1048
01:21:49,822 --> 01:21:52,158
I don't even like the type of thing you are.

1049
01:21:52,325 --> 01:21:54,744
Hey! There's no need to get personal.

1050
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:57,497
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.

1051
01:21:57,663 --> 01:21:59,415
I should have told you earlier.

1052
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:02,585
I'm stupid. You are in danger.

1053
01:22:08,341 --> 01:22:09,342
What is that?

1054
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:16,390
Now, you need to readjust the way you process life.

1055
01:22:16,641 --> 01:22:19,727
Everything around us, including the girl...

1056
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:23,356
Everything is temporary.

1057
01:22:23,523 --> 01:22:26,317
We are forever.

1058
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:27,944
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1059
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:30,530
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...

1060
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,657
which is why you're here.

1061
01:22:32,824 --> 01:22:34,951
I told you how all those years ago...

1062
01:22:35,118 --> 01:22:39,247
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

1063
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:43,459
But what I did not tell you was how, when I finally did find it...

1064
01:22:44,127 --> 01:22:45,419
it was all so...

1065
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,715
disappointing.

1066
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:53,553
And that is when I came...

1067
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:57,390
to a profound realization.

1068
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:02,895
My innate desire to seek out other life...

1069
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:07,650
was not so that I could walk among that life.

1070
01:23:09,861 --> 01:23:11,028
Peter...

1071
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:15,283
I have found meaning.

1072
01:23:35,178 --> 01:23:36,512
I see it.

1073
01:23:38,973 --> 01:23:40,725
Eternity!

1074
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:42,643
Oh, my God.

1075
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:55,156
We need to get off this planet.

1076
01:24:09,003 --> 01:24:10,296
Oh, man.

1077
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:12,798
Anyway, before I was so rudely interrupted...

1078
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:15,843
At that time, I was a Federal Express man.

1079
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:28,981
What the hell you doing, boy?

1080
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:31,150
I could tell by how you talked about him...

1081
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:32,652
this Ego is bad news.

1082
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,445
We're here to save Quill.

1083
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:38,658
For what? Huh? For honor? For love?

1084
01:24:38,866 --> 01:24:41,786
No. I don't care about those things.

1085
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:44,205
I wanna save Quill so I can prove I'm better than him!

1086
01:24:44,372 --> 01:24:47,124
I can lord this over him forever.

1087
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,711
What are you laughing at me for?

1088
01:24:51,379 --> 01:24:56,092
You can fool yourself and everyone else, but you can't fool me.

1089
01:24:56,259 --> 01:24:57,510
I know who you are.

1090
01:24:57,677 --> 01:24:59,845
You don't know anything about me, loser.

1091
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:02,265
I know everything about you.

1092
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,226
I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest...

1093
01:25:05,393 --> 01:25:06,769
but, actually, you're the most scared of all.

1094
01:25:06,936 --> 01:25:07,770
Shut up!

1095
01:25:07,979 --> 01:25:10,314
I know you steal batteries you don't need...

1096
01:25:10,481 --> 01:25:13,067
and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you...

1097
01:25:13,234 --> 01:25:14,527
because just a little bit of love...

1098
01:25:14,694 --> 01:25:17,947
reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.

1099
01:25:18,364 --> 01:25:19,615
I said shut up!

1100
01:25:20,074 --> 01:25:23,160
I know them scientists what made you, never gave a rat's ass about you.

1101
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:24,620
I'm serious, dude!

1102
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:27,373
Just like my own damn parents who sold me...

1103
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,417
their own little baby, into slavery.

1104
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:32,295
I know who you are, boy.

1105
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:34,463
Because you're me.

1106
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:43,097
What kind of a pair are we?

1107
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:47,435
The kind that's about to go fight a planet, I reckon.

1108
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:50,688
All right, okay! Good. Wait.

1109
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:52,481
Fight a what?

1110
01:25:56,986 --> 01:25:57,945
Who are you people?

1111
01:25:58,112 --> 01:25:59,071
What is this place?

1112
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:00,239
Gamora, let her go!

1113
01:26:00,406 --> 01:26:02,450
The bodies in the caverns... Who are they?

1114
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:04,910
You are scared.

1115
01:26:08,456 --> 01:26:11,334
I call it the Expansion.

1116
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:15,755
It is my purpose...

1117
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:19,425
and now it is yours as well.

1118
01:26:20,301 --> 01:26:21,761
It's beautiful.

1119
01:26:23,012 --> 01:26:25,264
Over thousands of years...

1120
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:28,601
I implanted thousands of extensions of myself...

1121
01:26:28,768 --> 01:26:31,479
on thousands of worlds.

1122
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:35,441
I need to fulfill life's one true purpose...

1123
01:26:35,608 --> 01:26:37,485
To grow and spread...

1124
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:40,780
covering all that exists...

1125
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:44,992
until everything is...

1126
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,411
Me!

1127
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:50,456
What did she do to me?

1128
01:26:50,623 --> 01:26:52,249
She already told me everything.

1129
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,960
I only had one problem.

1130
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:58,672
A single Celestial doesn't have enough power

1131
01:26:58,756 --> 01:27:00,716
for such an enterprise.

1132
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:03,010
But two Celestials...

1133
01:27:03,177 --> 01:27:06,472
Well, now, that just might do.

1134
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:10,601
The bodies...

1135
01:27:11,352 --> 01:27:13,646
are his children.

1136
01:27:14,188 --> 01:27:15,398
Out of all my labors...

1137
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:17,817
the most beguiling was...

1138
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:21,362
attempting to graft my DNA with that of another species.

1139
01:27:21,529 --> 01:27:24,448
I hoped the result of such a coupling would be enough...

1140
01:27:24,615 --> 01:27:26,450
to power the Expansion.

1141
01:27:27,535 --> 01:27:30,037
I had Yondu deliver some of them to me.

1142
01:27:30,204 --> 01:27:33,582
It broke the Ravager code, but I compensated him generously...

1143
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:37,503
and to ease his conscience, I said I'd never hurt them.

1144
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:40,256
I mean, that was true. They never felt a thing.

1145
01:27:40,423 --> 01:27:43,717
But one after the other, they failed me.

1146
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:47,721
Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.

1147
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:49,056
Until you, Peter.

1148
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:52,935
Out of all my spawn...

1149
01:27:53,102 --> 01:27:57,189
only you carried the connection to the light.

1150
01:27:57,356 --> 01:28:00,234
We need to find Peter now, and get off this damn planet.

1151
01:28:00,401 --> 01:28:02,987
Ego will have won him to his side by now.

1152
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:05,614
- Then we just go. - No!

1153
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:08,033
- He's our friend. - All any of you do...

1154
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,369
is yell at each other. You are not friends.

1155
01:28:10,536 --> 01:28:11,871
You're right.

1156
01:28:12,413 --> 01:28:13,456
We're family.

1157
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:16,876
We leave no one behind.

1158
01:28:20,379 --> 01:28:21,630
Except maybe you.

1159
01:28:22,256 --> 01:28:23,716
Oh, my God.

1160
01:28:24,425 --> 01:28:26,510
For the first time in my existence...

1161
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:29,597
I am truly not alone!

1162
01:28:35,144 --> 01:28:36,312
What is it, son?

1163
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:40,858
My friends.

1164
01:28:42,193 --> 01:28:46,238
You see, that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1165
01:28:46,572 --> 01:28:47,573
Yes.

1166
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:50,910
We are beyond such things.

1167
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:52,077
Yes.

1168
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:55,623
- Now... - But my mother...

1169
01:28:58,584 --> 01:29:00,920
You said you loved my mother.

1170
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:02,588
And that I did.

1171
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:08,719
My river lily who knew all the words to every song that came over the radio.

1172
01:29:10,513 --> 01:29:13,182
I returned to Earth to see her three times.

1173
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:15,893
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

1174
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:17,603
I'd never leave.

1175
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:20,272
The Expansion...

1176
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:24,026
the reason for my very existence, would be over.

1177
01:29:24,193 --> 01:29:26,237
So, I did what I had to do.

1178
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:32,451
But it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head.

1179
01:29:36,789 --> 01:29:37,873
What?

1180
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,583
Now, all right...

1181
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,418
I know that sounds bad.

1182
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:56,892
Who in the hell do you think you are?

1183
01:29:57,059 --> 01:29:58,602
You killed my mother!

1184
01:29:58,769 --> 01:29:59,812
I tried...

1185
01:29:59,979 --> 01:30:01,730
so hard...

1186
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:03,357
to find the form...

1187
01:30:03,524 --> 01:30:05,901
that best suited you...

1188
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:08,404
and this is the thanks I get?

1189
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:12,616
You really need to grow up.

1190
01:30:16,287 --> 01:30:19,081
I wanted to do this together...

1191
01:30:19,248 --> 01:30:21,208
but I suppose you'll have to learn

1192
01:30:21,292 --> 01:30:24,587
by spending the next thousand years as a battery!

1193
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:28,007
Finally! Rocket?

1194
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:31,010
Keep that transmitter nearby, so I can find you.

1195
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:34,346
We're in an old piece of construction equipment Yondu once used...

1196
01:30:34,513 --> 01:30:35,806
to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.

1197
01:30:35,973 --> 01:30:36,849
Ego's unhinged.

1198
01:30:37,016 --> 01:30:38,475
I know. Get ready.

1199
01:30:38,642 --> 01:30:39,935
Drop her, Kraglin.

1200
01:30:58,537 --> 01:30:59,663
No.

1201
01:31:10,841 --> 01:31:13,677
My life, my love

1202
01:31:13,844 --> 01:31:16,055
My lady is the sea

1203
01:31:18,182 --> 01:31:19,308
Peter...

1204
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,311
this is the sea.

1205
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:25,397
Oh...

1206
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:07,189
Hey, there, jackass!

1207
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:19,034
What is that thing?

1208
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:28,419
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

1209
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:35,926
I told you something didn't feel right.

1210
01:32:36,093 --> 01:32:38,387
"I told you so." Just what I need to hear right now.

1211
01:32:38,554 --> 01:32:40,222
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1212
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:42,182
Because there's an unspoken thing.

1213
01:32:42,349 --> 01:32:44,435
There is no unspoken thing.

1214
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:46,186
What are you doing? You could've killed us all!

1215
01:32:46,937 --> 01:32:48,480
Uh... "Thank you, Rocket"?

1216
01:32:48,647 --> 01:32:49,857
We had it under control.

1217
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:52,317
We did not. That is only an extension...

1218
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:54,528
of his true self. He will be back soon.

1219
01:32:54,695 --> 01:32:55,946
What's Smurfette doing here?

1220
01:32:56,113 --> 01:32:58,031
Whatever I need to do to get a damn ride home.

1221
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,450
She tried to murder me!

1222
01:32:59,616 --> 01:33:01,618
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1223
01:33:01,785 --> 01:33:03,036
He's not a fox.

1224
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:05,289
- I am Groot. - I'm not a raboon, either.

1225
01:33:05,456 --> 01:33:06,457
I am Groot.

1226
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:08,041
"Raccoon." Whatever.

1227
01:33:11,545 --> 01:33:12,880
How do we kill a Celestial?

1228
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,465
There's a center to him.

1229
01:33:14,631 --> 01:33:16,759
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...

1230
01:33:16,842 --> 01:33:18,051
Some sort of protective shell.

1231
01:33:18,469 --> 01:33:19,511
It's in the caverns...

1232
01:33:19,678 --> 01:33:20,679
below the surface.

1233
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:24,892
Yondu?

1234
01:33:33,567 --> 01:33:34,693
Thrusters are out.

1235
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:37,070
Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.

1236
01:33:37,237 --> 01:33:39,072
Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.

1237
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:40,449
You still reckon that's the reason

1238
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:41,658
I kept you around, you idiot?

1239
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:43,202
That's what you told me, you old doofus.

1240
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:46,038
Once I figured out what happened to them other kids...

1241
01:33:46,205 --> 01:33:47,790
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

1242
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:49,541
You said you were gonna eat me.

1243
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:51,126
That was being funny!

1244
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,170
Not to me!

1245
01:33:53,337 --> 01:33:54,546
You people have issues.

1246
01:33:54,713 --> 01:33:56,423
Of course I have issues.

1247
01:33:57,382 --> 01:34:00,219
That's my freakin' father!

1248
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:01,970
Thrusters are back up.

1249
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:17,736
- We should be going up! - We can't!

1250
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:20,405
Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it.

1251
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:21,949
We have to kill him.

1252
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:22,783
Rocket!

1253
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:23,617
Got it!

1254
01:34:30,249 --> 01:34:32,668
Whoo-hoo!

1255
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:39,716
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1256
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:40,926
I guess.

1257
01:34:41,093 --> 01:34:42,094
Awesome!

1258
01:34:44,221 --> 01:34:46,390
We're really gonna be able to jack up our prices...

1259
01:34:46,557 --> 01:34:48,183
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1260
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:50,936
I seriously can't believe that's where your mind goes.

1261
01:34:51,103 --> 01:34:53,856
It was just a random thought, man. I thought we were friends.

1262
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:56,275
Of course, I care about the planets, and the buildings...

1263
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:58,193
and all the animals on the planets.

1264
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,570
And the people.

1265
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:00,904
Meh.

1266
01:35:01,446 --> 01:35:05,492
The crabby puppy is so cute. He makes me wanna die!

1267
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:44,239
Pilots...

1268
01:35:44,406 --> 01:35:45,741
release envoy units.

1269
01:35:48,035 --> 01:35:52,080
Our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet.

1270
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:55,042
Dive!

1271
01:36:11,892 --> 01:36:13,352
Um... Captain?

1272
01:36:14,144 --> 01:36:15,562
Captain?

1273
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,194
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

1274
01:36:22,736 --> 01:36:24,363
He needs my genetic connection to the light...

1275
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,740
to help destroy the universe.

1276
01:36:26,907 --> 01:36:29,076
He tried to teach me how to control the power.

1277
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:30,369
So, could you?

1278
01:36:30,535 --> 01:36:31,703
A little.

1279
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:33,121
I made a ball.

1280
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:34,289
A ball?

1281
01:36:34,456 --> 01:36:36,166
I thought as hard as I could.

1282
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:37,793
It was all that I could come up with.

1283
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,294
You "thought"?

1284
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:41,546
You think when I make this arrow fly...

1285
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:43,548
I use my head?

1286
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:56,353
Whoa.

1287
01:37:05,112 --> 01:37:06,113
There.

1288
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:08,240
That's Ego's core.

1289
01:37:10,617 --> 01:37:12,244
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1290
01:37:12,411 --> 01:37:14,037
I got it covered.

1291
01:37:20,502 --> 01:37:21,837
We must hurry.

1292
01:37:22,004 --> 01:37:24,047
It will not take Ego long to find us.

1293
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:29,553
Keep it steady.

1294
01:37:36,059 --> 01:37:38,020
We drill into the center, we kill him!

1295
01:37:44,526 --> 01:37:45,777
Captain?

1296
01:37:46,153 --> 01:37:47,195
What is it, Kraglin?

1297
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:49,322
Hey, remember that A yes ha chick?

1298
01:37:49,865 --> 01:37:51,783
- Yeah, why? - Uh...

1299
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:53,285
Oh, hell!

1300
01:38:13,889 --> 01:38:15,474
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

1301
01:38:15,932 --> 01:38:17,642
They blew out the generator.

1302
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:20,604
I think I packed a small detonator.

1303
01:38:20,771 --> 01:38:22,314
A detonator is worthless without explosives.

1304
01:38:22,481 --> 01:38:23,940
Well, we got these.

1305
01:38:24,733 --> 01:38:26,777
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1306
01:38:26,943 --> 01:38:28,820
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction...

1307
01:38:28,987 --> 01:38:30,697
throughout his entire nervous system.

1308
01:38:30,864 --> 01:38:31,656
Meaning what?

1309
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:33,366
The entire planet will explode.

1310
01:38:33,533 --> 01:38:34,951
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1311
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:36,703
I rigged a timer.

1312
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:38,747
Go!

1313
01:38:52,969 --> 01:38:54,679
He's coming.

1314
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:57,849
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?

1315
01:38:58,350 --> 01:39:00,769
When he wants. He's too powerful.

1316
01:39:00,936 --> 01:39:02,229
I can't!

1317
01:39:02,771 --> 01:39:04,648
You don't have to believe in yourself...

1318
01:39:05,357 --> 01:39:07,400
because I believe in you.

1319
01:39:19,788 --> 01:39:20,372
Sleep!

1320
01:39:28,213 --> 01:39:29,756
I never thought she'd be able to do it...

1321
01:39:29,923 --> 01:39:32,175
with as weak and skinny as she appears to be.

1322
01:39:33,093 --> 01:39:36,012
I don't know how long I can hold him.

1323
01:39:39,307 --> 01:39:41,017
The metal's too thick.

1324
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:44,479
For the bomb to work, we'd actually need to place it on Ego's core.

1325
01:39:44,646 --> 01:39:46,940
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit through those tiny holes.

1326
01:39:47,607 --> 01:39:48,608
Well...

1327
01:39:51,403 --> 01:39:53,238
That's a terrible idea.

1328
01:39:53,405 --> 01:39:55,699
Which is the only kind of idea we have left.

1329
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:58,160
Unbelievable.

1330
01:39:58,326 --> 01:40:00,537
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."

1331
01:40:02,122 --> 01:40:03,582
What a day.

1332
01:40:11,173 --> 01:40:14,759
All right, first you flick this switch, then this switch.

1333
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:16,094
That activates it.

1334
01:40:16,261 --> 01:40:18,096
Then you push this button...

1335
01:40:18,263 --> 01:40:21,308
which will give you five minutes to get out of there.

1336
01:40:21,474 --> 01:40:22,767
Now, whatever you do...

1337
01:40:23,393 --> 01:40:25,812
don't push this button...

1338
01:40:25,979 --> 01:40:28,023
because that will set off the bomb immediately

1339
01:40:28,106 --> 01:40:29,608
and we'll all be dead.

1340
01:40:29,733 --> 01:40:32,152
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1341
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:33,987
- I am Groot. - Uh-huh.

1342
01:40:34,279 --> 01:40:36,239
- I am Groot. - That's right.

1343
01:40:36,406 --> 01:40:37,532
- I am Groot. - No!

1344
01:40:37,949 --> 01:40:40,285
No, that's the button that will kill everyone!

1345
01:40:40,452 --> 01:40:41,453
Try again.

1346
01:40:42,662 --> 01:40:43,830
Hmm...

1347
01:40:44,497 --> 01:40:46,249
- I am Groot. - Mmm-hmm.

1348
01:40:46,499 --> 01:40:48,543
- I am Groot. - Uh-huh.

1349
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:49,628
I am Groot.

1350
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:51,630
No! That's exactly what you just said!

1351
01:40:51,796 --> 01:40:53,381
How is that even possible?

1352
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:55,800
Which button is the button you're supposed to push?

1353
01:40:55,967 --> 01:40:57,052
Point to it.

1354
01:40:57,219 --> 01:40:58,136
No!

1355
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:00,263
Hey, you're making him nervous!

1356
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:02,182
Shut up and get me some tape!

1357
01:41:02,349 --> 01:41:03,725
Does anybody have any tape out there?

1358
01:41:03,892 --> 01:41:05,644
I wanna put some tape over the death button.

1359
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:08,688
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

1360
01:41:08,855 --> 01:41:11,524
Yo, Yondu... Ow!

1361
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:13,818
Do you have any tape?

1362
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:19,157
Gamora? Do you have any tape?

1363
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:20,367
Tape!

1364
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:22,953
Never mind. Ow!

1365
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:26,414
Drax, do you have any tape?

1366
01:41:26,498 --> 01:41:29,167
Yes, Scotch tape would work.

1367
01:41:29,459 --> 01:41:31,419
Then why did you ask me if Scotch tape would work,

1368
01:41:31,503 --> 01:41:33,004
if you don't have any?

1369
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:35,257
Nobody has any tape!

1370
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:36,758
Not a single person has tape?

1371
01:41:37,175 --> 01:41:38,176
Nope!

1372
01:41:38,343 --> 01:41:39,469
Did you ask Nebula?

1373
01:41:40,345 --> 01:41:41,054
Yes!

1374
01:41:41,221 --> 01:41:42,514
Are you sure?

1375
01:41:42,681 --> 01:41:44,015
I asked Yondu...

1376
01:41:44,182 --> 01:41:46,309
- and she was sitting next to him. - I knew you were lying!

1377
01:41:46,393 --> 01:41:48,436
You have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag.

1378
01:41:48,687 --> 01:41:51,064
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

1379
01:41:51,231 --> 01:41:54,776
That's exactly my point! I have to do everything!

1380
01:41:54,943 --> 01:41:57,445
You are wasting a lot of time here!

1381
01:41:59,906 --> 01:42:01,032
Whee!

1382
01:42:03,785 --> 01:42:05,704
We're all gonna die.

1383
01:42:07,455 --> 01:42:09,541
Rear thrusters are out again!

1384
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:12,460
We're done for without that generator!

1385
01:42:25,849 --> 01:42:27,100
Guardians...

1386
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:29,561
perhaps it will provide you solace...

1387
01:42:29,728 --> 01:42:32,314
that your deaths are not without purpose.

1388
01:42:32,897 --> 01:42:34,441
They will serve as a warning...

1389
01:42:34,607 --> 01:42:36,985
to all of those tempted with betraying us.

1390
01:42:37,527 --> 01:42:40,322
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1391
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:45,160
This is gonna hurt.

1392
01:42:45,327 --> 01:42:46,828
Promises, promises.

1393
01:42:57,297 --> 01:42:58,089
Hey!

1394
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:10,935
No!

1395
01:43:11,519 --> 01:43:13,646
No! No! No!

1396
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:20,028
We're gonna blow!

1397
01:43:25,408 --> 01:43:27,327
Peter! No!

1398
01:43:47,222 --> 01:43:48,056
What?

1399
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:50,558
You look like Mary Poppins.

1400
01:43:50,725 --> 01:43:52,102
Is he cool?

1401
01:43:53,937 --> 01:43:55,563
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1402
01:43:56,314 --> 01:43:58,191
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1403
01:44:25,635 --> 01:44:27,595
Mantis, look out!

1404
01:44:39,732 --> 01:44:41,317
She's just unconscious.

1405
01:44:57,375 --> 01:44:58,918
How long until the bomb goes off?

1406
01:44:59,085 --> 01:45:01,421
In the unlikely event that Groot doesn't kill us all...

1407
01:45:01,588 --> 01:45:02,755
about six minutes.

1408
01:45:07,802 --> 01:45:10,305
Kraglin, we need the quadrant for an extraction.

1409
01:45:10,472 --> 01:45:11,473
T-minus five minutes.

1410
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:12,807
Aye, Captain.

1411
01:45:16,686 --> 01:45:18,521
Somebody's gotta be up top when Kraglin arrives.

1412
01:45:19,856 --> 01:45:21,357
Drax, take Mantis.

1413
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:25,528
Ow! My nipples!

1414
01:45:34,204 --> 01:45:35,413
Gamora!

1415
01:45:38,708 --> 01:45:39,751
Peter!

1416
01:46:06,069 --> 01:46:07,403
Get over it.

1417
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:11,616
Come now, Peter. I know this isn't what you want.

1418
01:46:13,743 --> 01:46:18,122
What kind of father would I be to let you make this choice?

1419
01:46:47,694 --> 01:46:49,696
Yeah!

1420
01:46:49,779 --> 01:46:53,408
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

1421
01:46:54,075 --> 01:46:57,161
So stop pissing me off!

1422
01:47:17,390 --> 01:47:18,975
We have to get up to the extraction point!

1423
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:28,151
Go!

1424
01:49:27,562 --> 01:49:29,147
I told you...

1425
01:49:29,313 --> 01:49:33,151
I don't want to do this alone.

1426
01:49:36,362 --> 01:49:37,405
You cannot deny...

1427
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:41,826
the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you.

1428
01:49:51,085 --> 01:49:52,795
Everyone, I need you to stay back!

1429
01:49:52,962 --> 01:49:53,963
What is that?

1430
01:50:09,729 --> 01:50:11,939
It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.

1431
01:50:14,066 --> 01:50:17,069
Why are you destroying our chance?

1432
01:50:19,822 --> 01:50:22,950
Stop pretending you aren't what you are.

1433
01:50:24,786 --> 01:50:25,787
One in billions.

1434
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:29,415
Trillions. Even more.

1435
01:50:31,751 --> 01:50:36,130
What greater meaning can life possibly have to offer?

1436
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:42,887
I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!

1437
01:50:43,471 --> 01:50:45,348
I use my heart...

1438
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:24,303
You shouldn't have killed my mom, and squished my Walkman.

1439
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:28,099
And if you don't love me now

1440
01:51:28,266 --> 01:51:30,601
You will never love me again

1441
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:33,646
I can still hear you saying

1442
01:51:33,855 --> 01:51:37,775
You would never break the chain

1443
01:51:37,942 --> 01:51:39,861
And if you don't love me now

1444
01:51:40,111 --> 01:51:42,697
You will never love me again

1445
01:51:43,447 --> 01:51:47,618
I can still hear you saying

1446
01:51:47,785 --> 01:51:50,580
You would never break the chain

1447
01:51:50,746 --> 01:51:53,207
And if you don't love me now

1448
01:51:53,374 --> 01:51:56,377
You will never love me again

1449
01:51:56,544 --> 01:51:59,297
I can still hear you saying

1450
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:01,966
You would never break the chain

1451
01:52:04,635 --> 01:52:07,555
Groot? If you can hear me, hurry up!

1452
01:52:07,722 --> 01:52:10,766
I'm not sure how long Quill can keep him distracted!

1453
01:52:11,225 --> 01:52:12,810
Groot, hurry!

1454
01:53:08,574 --> 01:53:10,701
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1455
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:12,370
Get to the ship!

1456
01:53:12,536 --> 01:53:13,579
Not without Quill!

1457
01:53:13,996 --> 01:53:15,873
You need to take care of the twig!

1458
01:53:17,249 --> 01:53:18,960
Not without you!

1459
01:53:20,211 --> 01:53:23,506
I ain't done nothin' right my whole damn life, rat.

1460
01:53:26,884 --> 01:53:29,011
You need to give me this.

1461
01:53:37,228 --> 01:53:38,229
Uh...

1462
01:53:39,313 --> 01:53:41,816
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1463
01:53:41,983 --> 01:53:44,068
I only have one of each.

1464
01:53:56,414 --> 01:53:57,957
I am Groot.

1465
01:53:58,749 --> 01:53:59,834
What's that?

1466
01:54:01,544 --> 01:54:05,756
He says, "Welcome to the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy."

1467
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:08,634
Only he didn't use "frickin'."

1468
01:54:14,974 --> 01:54:16,058
Bye, twig.

1469
01:54:17,977 --> 01:54:21,439
We're gonna need to have a real discussion about your language.

1470
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,161
Where's Peter?

1471
01:55:17,995 --> 01:55:19,955
Rocket, where is he?

1472
01:55:20,664 --> 01:55:21,665
Rocket.

1473
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:23,417
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

1474
01:55:26,045 --> 01:55:27,046
Mmm...

1475
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,218
No. I'm not leaving without him.

1476
01:55:39,183 --> 01:55:40,184
I'm sorry.

1477
01:55:41,018 --> 01:55:43,813
I can only afford to lose one friend today.

1478
01:55:44,355 --> 01:55:45,356
Kraglin, go!

1479
01:55:46,232 --> 01:55:47,233
Wait...

1480
01:55:47,983 --> 01:55:49,568
Is Quill back?

1481
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:53,531
Rocket, where's Quill?

1482
01:55:54,657 --> 01:55:57,910
Rocket, where's Quill?

1483
01:55:59,078 --> 01:56:00,329
Rocket!

1484
01:56:01,372 --> 01:56:02,206
Where's Quill?

1485
01:56:04,416 --> 01:56:06,335
Where's Quill?

1486
01:56:14,718 --> 01:56:16,887
No, we need to stop it.

1487
01:56:22,059 --> 01:56:23,060
Stop.

1488
01:56:23,894 --> 01:56:25,437
Stop. Listen to me!

1489
01:56:25,646 --> 01:56:27,148
You are a god.

1490
01:56:28,732 --> 01:56:30,067
If you kill me...

1491
01:56:30,234 --> 01:56:32,736
you'll be just like everybody else.

1492
01:56:33,821 --> 01:56:35,489
What's so wrong with that?

1493
01:56:35,656 --> 01:56:36,574
No!

1494
01:57:27,249 --> 01:57:29,418
He may have been your father, boy,

1495
01:57:29,501 --> 01:57:30,961
but he wasn't your daddy.

1496
01:57:35,341 --> 01:57:37,676
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

1497
01:57:38,761 --> 01:57:41,055
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1498
01:57:44,808 --> 01:57:47,311
What?

1499
01:57:57,905 --> 01:57:59,073
Yondu, what are you doing?

1500
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:00,366
You can't.

1501
01:58:01,659 --> 01:58:02,660
Yondu!

1502
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:10,000
No!

1503
01:58:14,588 --> 01:58:15,506
No!

1504
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:18,217
Oh! Aww...

1505
01:58:18,884 --> 01:58:21,387
No! No!

1506
01:58:22,137 --> 01:58:24,056
Oh, no!

1507
01:59:18,861 --> 01:59:20,362
I told Gamora...

1508
01:59:20,487 --> 01:59:22,406
how when I was a kid I used to pretend

1509
01:59:22,489 --> 01:59:24,283
David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1510
01:59:27,202 --> 01:59:29,788
He's a singer and actor from Earth, really famous guy.

1511
01:59:31,415 --> 01:59:33,208
Earlier, it struck me...

1512
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:38,547
Yondu didn't have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow.

1513
01:59:39,173 --> 01:59:41,425
He didn't have the beautiful voice of an angel...

1514
01:59:41,592 --> 01:59:43,886
but he did have the whistle of one.

1515
01:59:43,969 --> 01:59:47,514
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff went on kick-ass adventures...

1516
01:59:47,598 --> 01:59:50,142
and hooked up with hot women...

1517
01:59:50,309 --> 01:59:52,269
and fought robots.

1518
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:58,984
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of end up being my dad after all.

1519
01:59:59,151 --> 02:00:00,235
Only it was you, Yondu.

1520
02:00:06,909 --> 02:00:08,786
I had a pretty cool dad.

1521
02:00:11,789 --> 02:00:14,458
What I'm trying to say here is...

1522
02:00:15,459 --> 02:00:20,130
sometimes that thing you're searching for your whole life...

1523
02:00:22,466 --> 02:00:24,802
it's right there by your side all along.

1524
02:00:24,968 --> 02:00:26,762
You don't even know it.

1525
02:00:38,899 --> 02:00:40,317
I am Groot.

1526
02:00:41,735 --> 02:00:43,487
He did call you twig.

1527
02:00:45,906 --> 02:00:47,241
Nebula...

1528
02:00:52,204 --> 02:00:54,164
I was a child like you.

1529
02:00:55,124 --> 02:00:59,211
I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.

1530
02:00:59,378 --> 02:01:02,339
And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.

1531
02:01:02,506 --> 02:01:04,258
I'm trying to make it right.

1532
02:01:04,425 --> 02:01:05,843
There are little girls like you...

1533
02:01:06,009 --> 02:01:08,846
across the universe who are in danger.

1534
02:01:11,515 --> 02:01:13,016
You can stay with us and help them.

1535
02:01:13,684 --> 02:01:15,978
I will help them by killing Thanos.

1536
02:01:16,145 --> 02:01:18,188
I don't know if that's possible.

1537
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:35,247
You will always be my sister.

1538
02:02:19,541 --> 02:02:20,375
Pete!

1539
02:02:24,254 --> 02:02:26,006
Captain found this for you in a junker shop.

1540
02:02:26,173 --> 02:02:29,009
Said you'd come back to the fold someday.

1541
02:02:30,802 --> 02:02:31,929
What is it?

1542
02:02:32,095 --> 02:02:33,096
It's called a Zune.

1543
02:02:33,263 --> 02:02:34,932
It's what everybody's listening to on Earth nowadays.

1544
02:02:35,098 --> 02:02:36,683
It's got 300 songs on it.

1545
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:39,102
300 songs?

1546
02:02:44,274 --> 02:02:45,359
Wait.

1547
02:02:51,490 --> 02:02:53,367
Rocket grabbed the pieces, and reassembled them.

1548
02:02:53,534 --> 02:02:55,953
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

1549
02:02:59,373 --> 02:03:00,707
Thanks...

1550
02:03:02,543 --> 02:03:03,794
Captain.

1551
02:03:42,874 --> 02:03:45,586
It's not time to make a change

1552
02:03:46,712 --> 02:03:50,424
Just relax, take it easy

1553
02:03:50,591 --> 02:03:54,303
You're still young, that's your fault

1554
02:03:54,469 --> 02:03:57,347
There's so much you have to know

1555
02:03:57,514 --> 02:04:01,727
Find a girl, settle down

1556
02:04:01,893 --> 02:04:04,980
If you want you can marry

1557
02:04:05,147 --> 02:04:10,527
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

1558
02:04:15,866 --> 02:04:17,200
They came.

1559
02:04:25,208 --> 02:04:26,710
What is it?

1560
02:04:27,377 --> 02:04:29,921
I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies,

1561
02:04:30,005 --> 02:04:31,423
and told them what he did.

1562
02:04:35,218 --> 02:04:36,928
It's a Ravager funeral.

1563
02:04:54,321 --> 02:04:55,238
Yeah!

1564
02:04:55,906 --> 02:04:57,407
Yeah!

1565
02:05:04,748 --> 02:05:06,583
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.

1566
02:05:07,584 --> 02:05:09,378
No, he did not, son.

1567
02:05:10,379 --> 02:05:11,797
He did not.

1568
02:05:18,553 --> 02:05:21,807
Fare thee well, old friend.

1569
02:05:24,226 --> 02:05:28,939
Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.

1570
02:05:32,984 --> 02:05:34,945
He didn't chase them away.

1571
02:05:35,112 --> 02:05:36,238
No.

1572
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,324
Even though he yelled at them.

1573
02:05:39,491 --> 02:05:40,992
And was always mean.

1574
02:05:43,620 --> 02:05:45,747
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

1575
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:52,963
Well, of course not.

1576
02:06:17,154 --> 02:06:18,321
What?

1577
02:06:18,989 --> 02:06:20,157
It's just...

1578
02:06:22,826 --> 02:06:25,454
some unspoken thing.

1579
02:06:34,629 --> 02:06:36,673
It's beautiful.

1580
02:06:38,175 --> 02:06:39,342
It is.

1581
02:06:40,886 --> 02:06:43,013
And so are you.

1582
02:06:45,015 --> 02:06:46,224
On the inside.

1583
02:06:53,106 --> 02:06:54,858
Now there's a way

1584
02:06:55,025 --> 02:06:58,987
And I know that I have to go away

1585
02:07:00,739 --> 02:07:03,200
I know I have to go

1586
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:43,425
You know, it's a shame...

1587
02:08:43,592 --> 02:08:47,971
that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu to bring us all together again.

1588
02:08:48,138 --> 02:08:51,308
But I think he'd be proud knowing that we are back as a team.

1589
02:08:52,017 --> 02:08:53,059
I'm in.

1590
02:08:53,226 --> 02:08:54,060
Dope.

1591
02:08:54,227 --> 02:08:56,313
I miss you guys so much!

1592
02:08:56,479 --> 02:08:57,689
Hell, yes.

1593
02:09:00,817 --> 02:09:02,736
What say we steal some shit?

1594
02:11:21,916 --> 02:11:23,793
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.

1595
02:11:25,086 --> 02:11:28,173
They are perturbed I've wasted our resources.

1596
02:11:32,844 --> 02:11:35,805
When they see what I have created here...

1597
02:11:35,972 --> 02:11:37,932
their wrath will dissipate.

1598
02:11:39,184 --> 02:11:42,187
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?

1599
02:11:43,605 --> 02:11:44,814
That, my child...

1600
02:11:44,981 --> 02:11:46,816
is the next step in our evolution.

1601
02:11:46,983 --> 02:11:50,153
More powerful, more beautiful...

1602
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:54,365
more capable of destroying the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1603
02:11:57,035 --> 02:11:59,496
I think I shall call him...

1604
02:12:01,331 --> 02:12:02,707
Adam.

1605
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,543
(THE SNEEPERS FT. DAVID HASSELHOFF'S

1606
02:12:05,627 --> 02:12:07,253
"GUARDIANS INFERNO" PLAYING)

1607
02:14:04,704 --> 02:14:06,164
Ugh, dude.

1608
02:14:07,123 --> 02:14:08,708
Seriously?

1609
02:14:08,875 --> 02:14:10,793
You gotta clean up your room. It's a complete mess.

1610
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,378
I am Groot.

1611
02:14:12,545 --> 02:14:14,464
I am not boring. You're boring.

1612
02:14:14,631 --> 02:14:15,465
You know what's boring?

1613
02:14:15,632 --> 02:14:18,801
Sitting there, playing that mind-numbing game.

1614
02:14:18,968 --> 02:14:22,555
What's boring is me tripping over your vines every day!

1615
02:14:23,097 --> 02:14:24,307
I'm not boring!

1616
02:14:24,474 --> 02:14:25,475
I am Groot.

1617
02:14:27,143 --> 02:14:29,646
And now I know how Yondu felt.

1618
02:15:05,473 --> 02:15:07,684
In these times of hardship...

1619
02:15:08,810 --> 02:15:10,853
just remember...

1620
02:15:11,479 --> 02:15:15,525
We. Are. Groot.

1621
02:15:18,820 --> 02:15:19,988
Hey, fellas.

1622
02:15:20,154 --> 02:15:21,823
Wait, where are you going?

1623
02:15:21,990 --> 02:15:24,367
You were supposed to be my lift home.

1624
02:15:24,534 --> 02:15:26,202
How will I get out of here?

1625
02:15:26,369 --> 02:15:27,662
Hey! Aw, gee...

1626
02:15:27,745 --> 02:15:30,498
I've got so many more stories to tell.

1627
02:15:30,665 --> 02:15:31,874
Aw, guys.

1628
02:15:32,041 --> 02:15:34,377
Oh, gee...
