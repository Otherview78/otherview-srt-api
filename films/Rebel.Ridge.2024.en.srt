10
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,750
- On the ground!
- Wait! You hit me!

11
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,333
- Get on your fucking face now!
- Okay, okay!

12
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,458
- Stay on your belly!
- What's going on?

13
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:16,916
Just stay on your belly!

14
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:22,458
108.10-26.
Pursuit terminated on Coleman Road.

15
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,125
South side of Fern Creek Bridge.
Possible 10-52.

16
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,541
Pursuit? I never even saw you, Officer.
I would've stopped.

17
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,625
Arms out!

18
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,625
Arms out like a fucking airplane!

19
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,166
What's the deal, Ev?

20
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:33,708
Flaggin' this?

21
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:34,791
No.

22
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,291
Picked him up crossing 13.

23
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,583
Lit him up. He tore ass.

24
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,375
If you're saying I fled,
that's bullshit. I couldn't hear.

25
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,916
I was behind you two miles!
Ran code the whole time.

26
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,166
- You tase him?
- Nope.

27
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,250
It's not too late. You want to get tased?

28
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,458
No, sir. I'd just like to know what I did.

29
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,416
- Is that your bike?
- Yes, sir.

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,875
- We got a report of a stolen bike.
- Can I see it?

31
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,083
You got a mouth on you.

32
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,791
I tried to pull you over, and you fled.

33
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,208
Now come on. Get up.

34
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,458
I'm gonna put my hands in your pockets.
I'm not gonna get stuck?

35
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,291
No.

36
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,541
Here.

37
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,083
- You have any warrants?
- No.

38
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,250
I'm gonna check your backpack
for any weapons.

39
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,666
You can't do that.

40
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:27,500
{\an8}- I can if it's in your immediate control.
- So take it off.

41
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:31,041
{\an8}I'd have to uncuff you.
That wouldn't be safe for either of us.

42
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,708
No hits.

43
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,125
That a star and crescent on your arm?

44
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,416
No, it's something else.

45
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,333
I lost some buddies, who served in Iraq.

46
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,291
Yeah, so did I.

47
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,333
- Ooh, what's this?
- It's not a weapon.

48
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,208
- It's not Chinese food.
- I didn't say it was.

49
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,791
May I look inside?

50
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,541
No, you may not.

51
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,541
Look, I can get a K-9 unit here,
or you can give me consent to search.

52
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,000
- K-9.
- I'll get Kyle on the horn.

53
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm gonna have to
ask you to take a seat.

54
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,291
Watch your head.

55
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,125
He's got Ziggy at the vet.
Hips are shot!

56
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,250
- Call Aurora. See if they can send theirs.
- Copy.

57
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,541
How long is this gonna take?

58
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,500
You got somewhere you gotta be?

59
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,458
Yes, I do.

60
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,708
Comin' from the city, probably 45.
Maybe an hour?

61
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,875
- Am I under arrest?
- You're currently being detained.

62
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:43,583
Okay, so if I let you search through it,
and there's nothing illegal, I can go?

63
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,208
Look, I'll make that determination,
but I can say

64
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,416
the more cooperative you are, the better.

65
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,291
All right, you can search it.

66
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,500
Steve, 10-22 that K-9 unit.

67
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,541
Hey, man, I haven't done anything wrong.

68
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,458
- That's a lot of cash you got on you.
- It's not illegal.

69
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,291
But drug currency is illegal.

70
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,916
It's a good thing it's not that.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,416
- You delivering it?
- Yes.

72
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,416
For somebody else?

73
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,458
No, for my cousin, but it's mine.
I'm posting his bail.

74
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,125
- You going to Town Hall?
- Courthouse.

75
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,125
Same building.

76
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,750
Okay. Listen,
I need to be there before 5:00.

77
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,833
What can I do?

78
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:57,083
That's over $30,000 dollars.
What's your cousin in for?

79
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,083
Ten is for bail, and the rest,

80
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,958
we're going to buy a truck,
and haul boats.

81
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,208
I'm not a criminal.

82
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,875
Your cousin is.
You didn't answer the question.

83
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,083
What's he in for?

84
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,375
Possession.

85
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,583
But it was just weed,
and he doesn't sell, so...

86
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,166
All right.

87
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,166
For the traffic violation,
I'm gonna let you off with a warning.

88
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,833
Thank you, Officer.

89
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,208
I assume you're aware
that when you ride a bicycle,

90
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,833
you're beholden
to the same laws as a motor vehicle.

91
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes, sir. Understood.

92
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,541
This your address?

93
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,041
Pulled up stakes,
but I'll let you know where I land.

94
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,541
Please do.

95
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,333
Now, we're going to hold on to this money.

96
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,791
We've concluded from our investigation
that this is drug currency.

97
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,583
No.

98
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:59,000
Or I have you on felony evasion
and conspiracy.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,041
Conspiracy?

100
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,833
I... I'm bailing out my cousin
and buying a truck.

101
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,708
You and your drug dealer cousin
sell it the next day for cash.

102
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:10,916
It's money laundering.

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,541
Listen, I rode down here
to slap some sense into him. Okay?

104
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,875
The cash is legit.

105
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,958
I sold my car.
I cashed out my stake in a restaurant.

106
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,166
- What restaurant?
- Kan Long Chinese. Percyville.

107
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,375
I know that spot. Decent dim sum.

108
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,708
Okay, so that's where the bag's from.
You can ask 'em.

109
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,791
All right.

110
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,416
We might touch base.

111
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,375
In the meantime, you're going to get
some paperwork in the next 30 days.

112
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,875
My cousin doesn't have 30 days.

113
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,041
- I need to get him out now.
- You need to listen.

114
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,000
You'll get a letter
saying you're being sued for this money

115
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,833
because we believe it's drug money.

116
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,708
If you answer the charges,
and you fight for this money...

117
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:48,708
This can't be legal.

118
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,625
...then I'll come after you
with a warrant and put you in jail.

119
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,875
Now if you choose not
to answer the civil paperwork,

120
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,333
we win it in default.

121
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,125
You'll never hear from us again.

122
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,708
How about y'all walk me
into Town Hall and we can sort this out?

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,166
This is sorted.

124
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,125
Come on.

125
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,958
You're pretty banged up.
You need us to call you an ambulance?

126
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,041
Uh, no.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,500
All right, you're free to go.

128
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,958
Either of you
requesting a jury trial?

129
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,392
- No.
- No, ma'am.

130
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,541
All right.
Come back Monday morning.

131
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,458
We'll put you up first thing.

132
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,583
I would not wear shorts
in front of the judge.

133
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:45,666
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,333
All right.

135
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,583
Posting bail or getting married?

136
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,541
Uh, I need somebody
to walk me through this...

137
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,166
You're injured. How'd it happen?

138
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,000
I got rammed off the road.

139
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,791
Oh. Hit-and-run?

140
00:08:58,875 --> 00:08:59,875
All right.

141
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,208
Uh, colleague has a practice
across the street.

142
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,708
Come by after the weekend,

143
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,000
but snap some pics while
you're still bleeding. Get a plate?

144
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,291
Uh, it was the cops.

145
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,458
They took my cash.
All of it. I was on my way here.

146
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,416
That's a seizure notice. I can't help you.

147
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,125
Right. They're transferring
my cousin to state prison?

148
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,708
All our inmates are going.
We're renovating the jail.

149
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,125
Okay, so he can't go. He gotta make bail.

150
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,291
Help me out here.

151
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,291
You've come to post bail

152
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,375
without any money?

153
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,708
You already got it.

154
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,583
This seal is the same as the one
on your office door, so...

155
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,875
Which is the same
as the watermark on my paycheck.

156
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,416
I am a court clerk, not a public defender.

157
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,791
- Is that who I should be talking to?
- Yeah, if we had one.

158
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,000
This is Municipal Court.
We don't try felonies.

159
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:50,333
Indigent defense is not in our budget,
nor is employee overtime.

160
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,416
Anything else we pick up
during business hours.

161
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,000
This is fucking surreal.

162
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,208
How can I get him out
if they took all my money?

163
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,750
Find some more. Is it a drug charge?

164
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,750
Why would you assume that?

165
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,750
It... It's just a guess.

166
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,250
Elliot. You got to get to a picnic.

167
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,791
- I'll walk him out.
- You sure?

168
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,458
Yup. Say hi to Kate.

169
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,708
Oh, ambrosia...

170
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,000
I had intel there were
already two potato salads.

171
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,541
Gingy and Jeff use eggs and bacon.
You don't want to mess with that. Just go.

172
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,958
- Thank you. Enjoy the weekend.
- You bet.

173
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:23,833
I'm Summer.

174
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Terry.

175
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,041
So you sure they took all your money?

176
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,333
I mean, I got what's in my wallet.

177
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,500
Thanks, Cindy.

178
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,708
- It's called civil asset forfeiture.
- And it's legal?

179
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,291
Well, it's a law.

180
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,916
Supposed to help Feds fight cartels.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,125
But they didn't find any drugs, so...

182
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,541
All they need is suspicion.

183
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,041
'Cause the seizure isn't tied
to any criminal charges.

184
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,875
And, here's where it gets real murky,

185
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,458
Chief gets to keep the proceeds,
use it for "discretionary funds."

186
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,833
Whatever that means.

187
00:10:56,333 --> 00:11:00,416
Someone in permits told me he bought a
$900 margarita machine for Cinco de Mayo.

188
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,041
Right, so never mind the, uh...
Shit. Which amendment is due process?

189
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,041
Doesn't matter. It's the fifth and 14th.

190
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,875
But, when they bring this case,
you won't even be named.

191
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,875
It's literally going to read...

192
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,291
- How much money was it again?
- 36k.

193
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,625
It'll read <i>The Township of Shelby Springs
v $36,000.</i>

194
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,875
Because your property has no civil rights.

195
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,833
But you can help me get it back?

196
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,583
No.

197
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,875
Okay. Thank you.

198
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,458
I mean, yes, you can fight for the money,

199
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,875
but that'll take you most of a year,
and cost you twice what you're owed.

200
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,958
What I can do is, um...

201
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,583
Okay...

202
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,625
Let's go.

203
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,000
Can't talk smack.

204
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,541
Chief has more allies than he used to.

205
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,416
Lost a pretty nasty civil suit
couple years back.

206
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,833
Had to clean up his act.

207
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,875
He didn't do so bad a job either.

208
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,500
Okay, his name?

209
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,875
Michael Simmons. Mike.

210
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,708
And what's he in for?

211
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,250
Misdemeanor possession.

212
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,166
- So Elliot was right back there?
- Yeah, but fuck him.

213
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,375
I will say bail's set really high
for that charge.

214
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,541
He had priors?

215
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,958
No. I mean, yeah, but they're expunged.

216
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:32,375
He's had a good run. But before,
out east, got into some deep shit.

217
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,583
Ended up a cooperating witness
on a capital murder charge.

218
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,000
Dude he helped put away
was high up in a gang, so...

219
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,125
Okay, and if Mike ends up
in a state facility...

220
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,500
Yeah, they spot him? He'll get swarmed.

221
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,250
Yikes.

222
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,083
- And the transfer's Thursday, yes?
- Yeah.

223
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,291
Okay, so you got some time.

224
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,291
- Can you get more money?
- I think so.

225
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,916
- Gotta make a call.
- Okay. Good.

226
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,041
You know a lot.

227
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:05,125
- You a lawyer or...
- Eighteen credits shy of a J.D.

228
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,500
Then the bar. So not for a while.

229
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,541
Cool. So why are you helping me?

230
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,958
Well, it's pretty clear
you need it.

231
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,083
And I know what that's like.

232
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,666
That's family. So...

233
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,625
I appreciate it.

234
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,208
I appreciate your appreciation.

235
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:26,916
Got a number?

236
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,833
In case I turn something up?

237
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,833
Yeah, but I don't really give it out.

238
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,416
I'll check back.

239
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,666
Okay.

240
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:36,833
All right.

241
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,875
<i>- Kan Long Chinese, please hold.</i>
- No, it's Terry.

242
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,708
Can you put me through to Mr. Liu?

243
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,416
<i>Oh. What up, T?</i>

244
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,125
- What's up?
<i>- Hang on a sec.</i>

245
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,875
<i>Terry, you already want back
in the restaurant business?</i>

246
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,041
Never should have left, sir.

247
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,333
<i>Everything okay?</i>

248
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,541
No, sir. Uh, hit a snag.

249
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,916
Might need a wire to tide me over.

250
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,416
<i>Yeah. How much?</i>

251
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Ten thousand.

252
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,541
<i>When?</i>

253
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,250
Early as Monday.
Wednesday would be cutting it close.

254
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,833
<i>That's going to be rough.</i>

255
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,500
<i>There's a Western Union?</i>

256
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,583
Uh, just a post office.

257
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,833
<i>So, uh, money orders,</i>

258
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,125
<i>they're capped at a grand.</i>

259
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,416
<i>So you need ten.</i>

260
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,583
Yeah, I hate asking.

261
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,583
<i>All right.</i>

262
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:40,125
<i>Text Ken the zip, any receiving details,
and we can be ready on our end.</i>

263
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,625
<i>You need it, just call.</i>

264
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay, will do.

265
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,166
Thank you, sir.

266
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,250
<i>You're welcome.</i>

267
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,666
Morning, ma'am.

268
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,333
Hey there, how can I help you?

269
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,083
I need to report a crime.

270
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,125
Oh, good goodness.

271
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,666
And this was cash?

272
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,250
Yes, ma'am. Uh, do you mind?

273
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,333
Oh, that's fine.

274
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,041
I ran out of juice. Thank you.

275
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,208
Hey, Chief.

276
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,291
Mornin', Jess.

277
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,291
Okay. Can you describe the suspect?

278
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,541
Uh, big guy.

279
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,791
White, blue eyes, about 6'4".

280
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,166
Must weigh 250, easy.

281
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,000
- You got a good memory.
- Thank you.

282
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,208
Um, I didn't get his badge number,
but his last name's Marston,

283
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,666
first initial "E."

284
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,375
Uh... And there goes suspect number two.

285
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,291
Pardon me. Just a minute.

286
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,416
Yes, ma'am.

287
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,958
I'll take care of it.

288
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,625
Sir?

289
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,333
You're gonna need to leave.

290
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,458
I'd like to finish up.

291
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,458
A false police report?

292
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,250
Put your signature on that,

293
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,000
it's a felony.

294
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:27,916
Cool.

295
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,333
What's the charge
for being rammed off the road,

296
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,125
shit stolen, threatened with a Taser?

297
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,458
- Get up.
- While I was in cuffs, by the way.

298
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,875
We can pick this up
right where we left off.

299
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,375
Now, now, now, now.

300
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,000
We don't need none of that.

301
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,041
- Mr., uh, Richmond?
- Yes, sir.

302
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,083
I was briefed on this matter yesterday

303
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,333
and whatever your concerns might be,

304
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:55,333
there is no doubt in my mind that you
were the subject of a legal interdiction.

305
00:17:55,416 --> 00:18:00,250
Fled an officer of the law,
evaded arrest, suspicion of conspiracy.

306
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,625
You've been treated
with more than due respect.

307
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,500
But right now you're facing felony charges
if you persist in harassing my officers.

308
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,875
- Your officers...
- Allow me to finish!

309
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:19,333
Now you sustained minor injuries
after colliding with a patrol vehicle,

310
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:23,416
and you were offered, but refused,
medical assistance at the scene.

311
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,833
Seems like any harm that's come to you
is of your own doing.

312
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:31,625
Now, currently, and under false pretenses,
you are in a secure area.

313
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,708
So I'm going to ask you
if you'd be so kind

314
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,666
as to cut off your recording device,

315
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,250
and exit my station.

316
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,208
You betcha.

317
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,916
- May I at least see my cousin?
- You can fuck right off.

318
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,791
I would love to, sir.
Just as soon as I get my money back.

319
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,500
Did they even include my statement?

320
00:18:56,583 --> 00:19:00,500
I can fully account for the money,
where it was from, and what it was for.

321
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,416
The dim sum spot? We made a note.

322
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,458
- You said you'd check it out. Did they?
- Listen up, son.

323
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,083
We are not litigating this here.

324
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,041
You got every right to fight
that forfeiture in court,

325
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,291
but until then,

326
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,833
like I said.

327
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,791
What if I didn't fight it?

328
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:30,083
What if all I wanted was the ten for bail?
You keep 26k, and I disappear.

329
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,458
I just need him out.

330
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,166
You mind making
a Xerox of this for me, Jess?

331
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,291
Yes, sir.

332
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:50,875
Yep.

333
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,458
We don't have one here, but there's a form

334
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,458
that you can sign
to disclaim that currency.

335
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,833
That bus Corrections or are we chartering?

336
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,916
- Chartering it from Corrections.
- Comes when?

337
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,791
Thursday. We break ground Friday.

338
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,458
All right.

339
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,875
We'll follow up on this.

340
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,666
Don't exactly have
visiting hours around here.

341
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,958
But if you come back here
at 9:00 a.m. on Monday morning,

342
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,458
you can see your cousin,

343
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,416
and we'll put this to bed.

344
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,708
Thank you.

345
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,041
Now fuck off.

346
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,083
Thank you.

347
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,166
Yes, sir.

348
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,000
Shit, you just missed 'em.

349
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:23,916
Who? What do you mean?

350
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,708
We pulled up our schedule.

351
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:28,791
Hold on.

352
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:32,041
- You said I could see him.
- At 9:00 a.m.

353
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,375
You're three minutes late.

354
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,125
Hey, yo!

355
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,333
Yo, Mike!

356
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,458
Hey, Mike!

357
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,166
Yo!

358
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,583
- Yo!
- Terry?

359
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,458
- Hey, Mike!
- Terry!

360
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,625
- Mike!
- Fuck is you doing, man?

361
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,375
I'm gettin' you out!

362
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,416
- Nigga, this a jailbreak?
- I'm posting bail!

363
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,375
You gotta request protective custody...

364
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,208
- Don't sweat it. They reduced my charge.
- As soon as you process!

365
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,166
- Told me I'd be in and out.
- I'm serious. They'll know who you are!

366
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,541
How bad I fuck up?

367
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,041
Just stay low! All right?

368
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,666
- All right.
- All right!

369
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,416
Oh, shit.

370
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,958
Next time, cuz!

371
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,708
Come on, T! Come on!

372
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:04,791
Yeah!

373
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:08,458
Oh, shit! Come on, T! Come on!

374
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,000
Come on!

375
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:18,625
Yeah!

376
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,500
- Mike!
- Come on, T!

377
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,250
Yeah!

378
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,625
Got that cardio, son!

379
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
That's my cousin! Yeah!

380
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:47,791
<i>- Hello?</i>
- You dropped the accent?

381
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:49,708
<i>Not open.</i>

382
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:53,500
What, no more 24/7? Look, I'm gonna
need those money orders ASAP.

383
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,416
Just texted you the receiving info.

384
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,583
<i>Sir, those aren't mine.</i>

385
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,750
<i>- Yeah, let me put you through.</i>
- But Mr. Liu already...

386
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,916
<i>- What the hell, Terry?</i>
- Sir, uh, things fell through.

387
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,958
I'mma need to pull the trigger
on that 10K.

388
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,458
<i>It's off the table.</i>

389
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:15,583
It's urgent.
I wouldn't ask if I didn't need it.

390
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:18,833
<i>I got half a dozen cops here
executing a search warrant.</i>

391
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:22,291
<i>Took my safe. Got dogs sniffing for drugs.</i>

392
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:24,875
Wait, how?

393
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:28,375
<i>You implicated my business
in a statement to the Shelby Springs PD.</i>

394
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:31,083
<i>They contacted Percyville,
Percyville came knocking.</i>

395
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:34,375
I didn't implicate you. I was accounting
for the money in my possession.

396
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:37,083
I couldn't have been more clear.

397
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:40,125
<i>I don't doubt that,
but you didn't draft the warrant,</i>

398
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:41,500
<i>and I'm gonna miss payroll.</i>

399
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,125
I'll make this right, sir.

400
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,125
<i>Okay. Sure.</i>

401
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,750
Fuck.

402
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:03,875
- Wouldn't drink the public water.
- Hey, were you...

403
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:07,041
Lemme know when you've filled these out,
and I'll walk you over.

404
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:09,291
You. You're still wearing shorts.

405
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:10,541
It's all I rock.

406
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,166
Godspeed.

407
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:14,791
I'm working.

408
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:16,916
I'm sorry.
These cops, they're fucking with me.

409
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,750
Yeah. They're saying the same about you.

410
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,250
They're transferring him.

411
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,000
He's on a bus right now.

412
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,208
- Sorry to hear that.
- You said you could help.

413
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,250
You found something?

414
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,375
I poked around. Got poked back.

415
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:34,625
- So, is there anything...
- Look, I need this job, Terry.

416
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,166
You gotta go.

417
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:39,375
I'd use the back door.

418
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:43,458
Okay.

419
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:53,541
Fuck!

420
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,000
Oh, hey, Terry!

421
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:11,916
Sorry, there's too many lurkers. Judge
walked in on me going over Mike's file.

422
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,500
- You all right?
- Yeah, thanks. He's fine.

423
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:18,250
But I flagged a bunch more cases
with super high bail.

424
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,833
- Every one had an adjournment.
- What does that mean?

425
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:24,041
Not sure. I got busted.
But something's up.

426
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,041
Something's off.

427
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,291
Misdemeanor defendants
don't sit in jail that long.

428
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:30,333
- Why is that?
- It's expensive. This town's broke.

429
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,291
Okay, so how do we pursue this?

430
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:35,500
Look, I sent what I could
to an old inkjet.

431
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,291
I'll grab you the print-outs after work,
but that's it.

432
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,125
I wasn't playing about my job.

433
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,958
I got a little girl.

434
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:45,958
Okay. But this could get Mike out?

435
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,791
If it's a big deal. Maybe.

436
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:53,000
- But if your timeframe's a day? No chance.
- My timeframe's an hour.

437
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:55,666
What about the money?
You said you could get more money.

438
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,250
- That's gone.
- Shoot!

439
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,333
Summer?

440
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:03,250
Hey, listen, what gets Mike out?

441
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,958
Uh, besides bail, a court order.

442
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:08,761
- But the judge won't sign one.
- Summer, what're you doing?

443
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:11,125
So my only hope
is dropping 10K on your desk?

444
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,166
His desk. Yeah.

445
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,375
Just catching a smoke!
I'll be right there!

446
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:18,083
- Uh, you don't smoke.
- I'm vaping!

447
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,833
- What time you take lunch?
- What?

448
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:21,833
I don't wanna walk in
with a pile of money,

449
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:23,541
and you be out getting a sandwich.

450
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,875
I'll have the paperwork ready. Okay?

451
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,416
What're you gonna do?

452
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,833
Let's go. We're piling up.

453
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:33,083
I'll see ya.

454
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:56,583
Chief, you've got an incoming.

455
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,750
That's your DD214.

456
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,958
- What are we looking at?
- "Richmond, Terrence James, USMC."

457
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,833
"Paygrade E-4, Camp Lejeune."

458
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:12,916
Here we go.
"Primary specialty M-C-M-A-P instructor."

459
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,541
- What's that?
- McMap...

460
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:16,291
Maybe he's a navigator?

461
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:20,208
McMap... Why don't you google that, Jess?

462
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,000
Rifle expert badge.

463
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,583
Ah, they all get that one.

464
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:26,875
What was it again? "M-C..."

465
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:28,000
"M-A-P."

466
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,083
Let me restart this Wi-Fi.

467
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:35,958
There's not much else.

468
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:39,208
"Released from active duty in '17."

469
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:42,250
Some shit about his dental work.

470
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:44,625
"Character of service, honorable."

471
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:47,666
Chief, he's here.

472
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,666
Who's that?
Robby or the concrete guy?

473
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,583
Terry Richmond. He's out front.

474
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:56,333
Steve?

475
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:06,708
"Was on active duty during Iraq,
but did not himself serve overseas."

476
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:08,416
"Never deployed."

477
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,750
So, no combat experience.

478
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:12,458
- None. It would say.
- Good.

479
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:15,583
My heart damn near skipped a beat.

480
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,750
How you want to handle this?

481
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,333
Aw, why don't you
let me run him off?

482
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:25,416
You hang back.

483
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:26,666
Got you, Chief.

484
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,083
Robby, why don't you
go ahead and call lunch.

485
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:42,208
- It's early. Maybe we...
- Yeah, Robby.

486
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,000
- Just go ahead and call lunch.
- All right.

487
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:48,291
Break! Hey, boys, that's lunch!

488
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,375
Chief.

489
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,541
I'm glad you're back.

490
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,333
You left before
you could see my shit-eatin' grin.

491
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:57,583
Oh. Lay it on me.

492
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,875
Aw, it's not the same if you ask.

493
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,333
Man, I thought we had a deal.

494
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,458
Well, that was the point.

495
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,000
Of what?

496
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,250
Misleading you.

497
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:10,750
I see.

498
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:11,833
Do you?

499
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:15,708
Because the offer you made
wasn't unreasonable.

500
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,333
It was more than fair,
as far as the trouble it would save.

501
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:20,833
Well, it still stands.

502
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,708
So you don't see.

503
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,833
It wasn't the offer you made.

504
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:28,875
It was the fact that you thought
you were entitled to make one.

505
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:33,958
- Well, my intentions weren't to offend...
- Straight to hell with your intentions.

506
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:38,708
You do not stand in my station
in front of my officers and set terms.

507
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:41,166
I wasn't aware it was a pissing contest.

508
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,916
Come on now. Hm.

509
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,875
Isn't it always?

510
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:46,666
So whatever I say, my cousin...

511
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,291
You could offer me eternal life
or a catfish sandwich,

512
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,791
and the answer would still be the same.

513
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,375
Especially since you
stopped calling me "sir,"

514
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,583
which is the only thing
you had going for you.

515
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,666
Well, see, that's a courtesy
I extend only so far.

516
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,166
One of the perks of civilian life.

517
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,250
Let's not go reminiscing
about the Corps now.

518
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:12,583
- We both know you never left the base.
- Checking up on me.

519
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:13,958
What were you, motor-pool?

520
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:17,583
No, put in for infantry, but, uh,
they found a use for me state-side.

521
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,875
Now good for them.

522
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:21,541
I've had no such luck.

523
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:24,875
So I guess it's time you headed on,

524
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,458
and be grateful
because if I still had a jail...

525
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:29,875
...you'd already be in it.

526
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:33,541
I mean, you got me
in a tight enough spot as is.

527
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:34,750
Both of us, actually.

528
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:36,458
How's that?

529
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:38,375
Well...

530
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:39,833
That's why I'm here.

531
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,791
I'm running out of letters.

532
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,708
See, it's, and I don't mean to reminisce,

533
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:50,083
but, uh, one thing
I can't shake from the Corps,

534
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:51,958
acronyms.

535
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:55,208
Man, we got tons
that seared into my brain.

536
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:57,500
- I got an acronym for ya.
- Allow me to finish.

537
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,083
That Wi-Fi up yet?

538
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:03,458
It's coming.

539
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:09,708
The acronym you need
to worry about right now is PACE.

540
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:12,916
P-A-C-E. Ever heard of it?

541
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,958
It's a planning methodology
used for comm systems,

542
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:18,541
but they found
it could be applied anywhere.

543
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:22,541
Nursing, engineering,
parachute infiltrations,

544
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,333
posting bail.

545
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:26,916
So the P is for "primary,"

546
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:30,500
that's me riding into town
with my bag of money.

547
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,750
A is for "alternate."

548
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:36,041
That's the deal we apparently never made.

549
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:39,083
C is my "contingency."

550
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:43,208
That's the restaurant owner
you put out of business this morning.

551
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,291
And there it is!

552
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:50,250
Spot-on too, like you just ate shit.

553
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,250
Anyway, you got me burning through
all these letters.

554
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:58,625
And after this conversation,
we already on E.

555
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:01,166
You know what that stands for?

556
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,291
"Marine Corps
Martial Arts Program."

557
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,625
...What?
- "MCMAP."

558
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:09,250
"Combat system combines hand-to-hand,
close quarters..."

559
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,583
Oh-oh.

560
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,916
I think he's on the Wikipedia page,

561
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,166
teaching jiu-jitsu
to the 6th Marine Regiment.

562
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,250
Okay.

563
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:19,500
"Team building..."

564
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,041
"One mind. Any weapon."

565
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:24,291
- Call in any units on patrol.
- Yup.

566
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:27,041
- Here come your peeps.
- Chief!

567
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,500
You wanna honor that deal
or do I gotta transition to E?

568
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:31,458
Put some distance between you!

569
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:39,000
Ah. Let's not do that.

570
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,375
Hey! Hey! Hey!

571
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:45,958
Let go! Move back!

572
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,750
- Okay, okay. Don't shoot.
- Move the fuck away from him!

573
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:50,541
All right. Okay! Okay. Okay.

574
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,666
Hey!

575
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:17,333
Okay. Real quick.
We're gonna stay cool and go inside.

576
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,333
- You're fuckin' nuts!
- Lead the way. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

577
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:23,541
Go! Tell them to safety their rifle.

578
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,166
Why would I?

579
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:28,333
He's quiet with good form. If anyone's
gettin' anyone killed, it's him.

580
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,083
As long as I'm not the one dying.

581
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:32,208
I'm scared of him shooting me, Chief.

582
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:35,208
I'm not waiting on him to go first,
and you're between us.

583
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:38,000
All right! Go ahead
and point that thing the other way!

584
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,125
- Go on now! It's just a dust-up!
- Safety that weapon!

585
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:43,833
- Open the door.
- We'll handle it! We got it!

586
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:50,916
Move.

587
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,916
All right, center of the room.

588
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,375
Sit down.

589
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,083
Sit down or I sit you down.

590
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,125
All right, where is she?

591
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:32,375
We're the only ones here. Skeleton shift.

592
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,458
Bullshit.

593
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:36,208
Sims is here. You got two on patrol.

594
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:42,041
All right, if this goes fast,
it'll go as well as it can.

595
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:46,041
But if you slow me down...
it's gonna suck for everybody.

596
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:50,000
Jess, come on out!

597
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,708
Come on out, Jess!

598
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:56,208
Let's just get this over with.

599
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:02,583
Sorry, Chief.

600
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:04,416
Don't you apologize.

601
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,666
All right, weapon on the deck.

602
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:10,833
Let's go.

603
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:17,333
All right, restrain them.

604
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:19,916
Their cuffs, not yours.

605
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm assuming
my money's in the property room.

606
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:37,958
You got keys?

607
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:40,666
Right hip.

608
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:43,125
Go.

609
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,375
Stop.

610
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,083
Go.

611
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:05,791
Yeah.

612
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,708
Hey, just make sure it's my...

613
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,333
Goddamn.

614
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
Count out 10K.

615
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:23,625
Deal's a deal.

616
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:27,458
Feel free to round up though.

617
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:31,791
Okay.

618
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:33,833
Go ahead.

619
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,500
Stop there.

620
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,333
Is there a back exit?

621
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:44,958
Side one to the lot,
but you still gotta exit out front.

622
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:48,291
I'm holding on to your weapon.
I'll surrender it to Sims once I'm safe.

623
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:50,166
You ain't ever gonna be safe.

624
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:56,958
Now, I'm assuming those boys out there
are forming a redneck SWAT team.

625
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:59,375
Can you and I agree
we both want to avoid gunfire?

626
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:01,375
Of course.

627
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:13,333
Their lives are in your hands.

628
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:20,833
Now your cuffs.

629
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:26,625
It's all over now.

630
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:30,291
- Chief says back to work.
- Where is he?

631
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,833
On QuickBooks setting up your payroll.

632
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:33,916
Go on.

633
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:46,958
Someone should string
that motherfucker up!

634
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,208
Don't get ignorant.

635
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,791
This man is a veteran
going through something difficult.

636
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,958
We had a misunderstanding, but it's over.

637
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,916
Now you go on about your business,
and let us go about ours.

638
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:58,416
Hey.

639
00:39:58,875 --> 00:39:59,958
Thanks for that.

640
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:02,083
It was for me. Not you.

641
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:13,166
Disable the perp locks, please.

642
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,750
Not my cruiser.

643
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:16,500
I can pull over, figure it out.

644
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,208
Just keep going.
I'll shoot the glass out if I have to.

645
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:24,541
I see they got you rolling
in an old-ass Crown Vic

646
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,833
while they get brand-new
Chargers for themselves.

647
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:29,708
Chief says we need a diversified fleet,
in case of a recall.

648
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:34,500
- And I like my Crown Vic.
- Hey, you stay cool, I'll stay cool.

649
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:43,708
What's that? What's that mean?

650
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,333
Code 4.

651
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:48,083
I'm okay. You're okay.

652
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:50,541
<i>Go ahead, 105, just passed you.</i>

653
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:53,333
- Code 13...
- No 10 codes. Speak so I can follow.

654
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,250
Be advised.
Officers need assistance at the station.

655
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:02,625
Suspect has left the scene. Now on foot,
headed northbound on 13 at Mount Ida.

656
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:03,958
Suspect is...

657
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:08,500
- I said I'd surrender it. Keep going.
- I'm not telling my officers until I know.

658
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:22,000
Unarmed... but considered dangerous.

659
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:28,875
<i>We need all units on
that search. Gets pretty thick out there.</i>

660
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:29,958
<i>Copy, 106.</i>

661
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:33,083
I'll drop them on the paint
a mile up the road.

662
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:34,625
<i>Copy.</i>

663
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:35,708
Sorry.

664
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:40,958
<i>105. Come in.</i>

665
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,666
<i>105. Do you copy?</i>

666
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:13,916
You good?

667
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:19,125
I'm good.

668
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:31,666
Good.

669
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:39,416
- Good afternoon.
- Posting bail or getting married?

670
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,666
Defendant is Simmons, Michael R.

671
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:47,166
You want to count it out, Elliot?
I'll get the judge to sign.

672
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,500
All right.

673
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,833
Need you to sign
this bail form right here.

674
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,375
Bail form.

675
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:14,708
I double-checked. Yes, sir.

676
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,958
Um, how was your weekend?

677
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:21,666
- You're over.
- Hm?

678
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,750
This is yours.

679
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:25,000
I'll get you a receipt.

680
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:28,750
Refund if he shows for his hearing.
He'll owe a levy for court costs.

681
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:30,000
Not a problem.

682
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:32,500
Oops! Wrong one.

683
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:37,250
Summer, are these yours?

684
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:40,708
Oh, yeah. I was just, uh,
going over a few cases.

685
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:42,166
Shouldn't leave these out.

686
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,000
Let me just shoot this over.

687
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:49,750
Did it go through?

688
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,958
On our end, yeah.

689
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:55,083
- Did you hurt someone?
- Barely broke the skin.

690
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:57,291
Think he'll get out?

691
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:03,083
- Think they'll send me to where he's at?
- Was that your plan?

692
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:08,375
- I ran out of plan.
- On the floor! Now! Move!

693
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:12,125
- Down on the ground!
- Slow! Hands!

694
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:13,916
- Knees!
- On the ground!

695
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,041
Get those hands up!

696
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:16,291
Here we fucking go!

697
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:17,875
- Don't! Oh my God!
- Taser!

698
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:20,416
- Tell the chief I said...
- On the floor!

699
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,000
- Oh, my Lord!
- Get back!

700
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:25,666
Get down!

701
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,125
Stop!

702
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:31,083
Gimme your hand!

703
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:32,250
Don't hurt him!

704
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:34,500
- Get his arms.
- Gimme your hand!

705
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,916
Hands! Gimme your hands!

706
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,360
- All right, take it easy!
- Stay down!

707
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:40,416
Stop moving.

708
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,340
- Stop fucking moving!
- Take it easy!

709
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,541
- Cuff him!
- A deal's a deal.

710
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:48,708
- I'll call medical.
- Yeah...

711
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:50,625
- He stays put.
- Holding's full.

712
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:52,541
Put him in the catacombs.

713
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:57,916
Open.

714
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:05,666
Reactive.

715
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:08,125
So he's good?

716
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:12,166
Probes were out when we got here.
No real tissue damage.

717
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,208
ECG was good. No cardiac history.

718
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:19,083
You ingest any drugs today?
Meth, anything like that?

719
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:20,166
Mm-mm.

720
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,708
- When was your last tetanus shot?
- I don't know.

721
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:24,458
You should get one.

722
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,500
He's good.

723
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:30,833
More worried about the mold in here.

724
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:34,416
- This was a jail?
- It's a catacombs. Storage now.

725
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:39,458
You up for a drive?

726
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:43,083
Don't I need to get in front of a judge?

727
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,083
Someone else wants to see you first.

728
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:08,833
Do yourself a favor.

729
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Hear him out.

730
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,250
- They confirm which one?
- Yup.

731
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:44,250
You know the thing
about a pissing contest?

732
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:47,708
Everybody gets piss on their boots.

733
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:50,500
Do you agree with that?

734
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,208
Sure.

735
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:56,958
Today should have never happened.

736
00:46:57,833 --> 00:47:00,833
If I'd known who you were,
maybe it wouldn't have.

737
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:02,750
May I ask where we're going?

738
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:04,666
Give me a minute here. Okay?

739
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,375
Okay.

740
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:11,291
When you came in today and
gave yourself the tour, what'd you see?

741
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:17,166
- Not sure how I'm supposed to answer that.
- You can be frank.

742
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:21,875
I saw a shit ton of cash, and enough
weaponry to support a rifle platoon.

743
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:26,791
That cash is our operating budget
for the next two quarters, if that.

744
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:31,208
All of it legally seized,
all of it going back into the community.

745
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:33,166
Like the margarita machine?

746
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:38,333
Heard about that, did you?

747
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:41,375
Well,

748
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:46,666
sometimes we... we all need
a little something for the morale.

749
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:51,375
What you saw in that cage
was our survival.

750
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:56,416
Out of six towns, we're the last
in the parish with our own force.

751
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,833
Got us doing traffic control,
responding to medical.

752
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:03,708
Evan here took, I don't know how many...
How many reports you take last year?

753
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:06,208
- Close to 600.
- Six hundred.

754
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:07,833
And they cut our budget.

755
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:10,625
Say they're going to issue bonds,
but they never do.

756
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:14,000
Crawl up our ass for police reform,
but they won't fund it.

757
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:18,125
Not only do we got to find our own money,
we got to turn a profit.

758
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:19,958
Those weapons...

759
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:22,791
Did you get a good look at 'em?

760
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,458
The multi-launcher and the flashbangs...
You ever heard of a dazzler?

761
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:29,375
Non-lethal.

762
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:33,083
Yeah, we have to call 'em
"less-lethal." Liability purposes.

763
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:38,000
But yeah, we, uh,
outsource them to the other PDs.

764
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:40,875
Protests, riots, suicide by cop.

765
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,625
Civil unrest,
it's a growth industry around here.

766
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:48,166
- I don't know about the Marines.
- Yeah. We got an acronym for it.

767
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:50,000
Well, what is it?

768
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:52,750
E-O-F, N-L-E.

769
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:56,000
Escalation of Force, Non-Lethal Effects.

770
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:57,541
That's the new thing.

771
00:48:57,625 --> 00:48:59,250
De-escalation.

772
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:03,416
Save the perps from themselves.
Everybody lives to fight another day.

773
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:07,041
Well, I'm all for it.

774
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:08,708
How about you?

775
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,125
For what?

776
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:12,250
De-escalation.

777
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,500
Sure.

778
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:24,458
Come on out.

779
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:26,666
Nice and slow.

780
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:30,333
All right, turn around.

781
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:36,625
26,000.

782
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:37,791
Still in there.

783
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:39,458
What is this?

784
00:49:40,666 --> 00:49:43,208
- What's happening?
- Well, I'm gonna tell you.

785
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:47,166
But first, we're gonna have to
take those cuffs off of you

786
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,000
because you shouldn't be wearing them
when you hear this.

787
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:54,875
And given what happened today,
you need to be very, very careful.

788
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:56,750
As will we.

789
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:58,791
Understood?

790
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:01,916
Turn around.

791
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:18,791
You can face me.

792
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:25,250
We're at Samaritan Hospital Center.

793
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:28,625
Your cousin is being Med-evaced
here as we speak.

794
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:31,541
He's coming from the infirmary,
so we're a little ahead of 'em.

795
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:33,333
- Is he alive?
- He was attacked.

796
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:35,958
Just out of processing.

797
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,958
I do not know his current condition.

798
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,416
When I talked to Corrections,
they said he was...

799
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:44,791
stabbed up pretty good.

800
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:48,625
I fucking told you!

801
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:52,625
Now, you see, that's what
we can't be hearing from you right now.

802
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:55,125
What do you want to hear from me?

803
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:57,750
Well, this is tough to take in, so

804
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:00,291
maybe just focus on that.

805
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:04,791
We could be throwing blame
around here all night, okay?

806
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:08,708
Just because you was right,
doesn't make us wrong.

807
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,166
Right now, you gotta choose

808
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,583
between a bag full of money

809
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,625
and our deepest sympathies,

810
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:18,208
or 30 years minimum.

811
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:22,375
Or worse, if you can't stay in control.

812
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:24,958
To what? Walk away?

813
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:27,291
You had a plan, right?

814
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:35,750
Paid in full. More than makes up
for the bail you're short.

815
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:37,541
I didn't ask to get paid off.

816
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:39,916
Son, I'm trying to make you whole.

817
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,208
Now go haul boats,
or sell that truck for cash.

818
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:47,750
Whatever you decide to do,
you do it damn far from here

819
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:50,083
because if you enter this township again,

820
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,583
this'll go another route.

821
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:58,500
- Aw, come on, this smells way off.
- Not for a steaming pile of shit.

822
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:02,083
That's your bird.

823
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,500
This is your deal.

824
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:06,583
All you gotta do

825
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:08,458
is nothing.

826
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:10,250
What am I gonna say?

827
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:12,541
You say "okay."

828
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:19,458
Okay.

829
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:22,125
Hey, you want to keep that nice.

830
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:24,166
Seller's expecting you.

831
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,291
You don't take possession by tonight,

832
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,750
I'm going to assume the deal's off.

833
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:31,791
Then we go that other route.

834
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,125
You're free to go.

835
00:52:59,791 --> 00:53:01,833
He's not really in the system yet.

836
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:03,375
Pops up as "in transit."

837
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:07,000
He put you down as next of kin.

838
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:10,666
So I'm seeing if you can claim the remains
here, or if they have to go back.

839
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:13,541
Coroner might put the body on hold
since it was a homicide.

840
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:17,500
So I guess just stay in touch with
our office until they figure it all out.

841
00:53:20,291 --> 00:53:21,541
Could you take those off?

842
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:23,875
Sure.

843
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:28,291
All set?

844
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:31,125
Yeah.

845
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:41,583
I salvaged your bike.

846
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:45,708
If you want to swing by my house
and grab it.

847
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:46,791
Pawn it.

848
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:49,583
- It's worth a couple grand.
- I see 'em.

849
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:54,125
- It's not what you think.
- Be smart. No way he just lets me go.

850
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,041
He's worried about November.

851
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:58,500
Makin' a run for Sheriff.

852
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:10,458
That's real, what I found.

853
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:15,250
I don't know what this is.

854
00:55:16,041 --> 00:55:18,625
Case records that don't match up
with the bail schedule.

855
00:55:18,708 --> 00:55:19,708
And I don't care.

856
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:22,750
There's dozens.

857
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,291
Look, Terry, I...

858
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,166
I know now is not the time.

859
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:33,541
It's just we don't have any...

860
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:36,291
When we cross to the next town,
we should get some food.

861
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:39,000
Can't remember my last meal.

862
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,375
Someone wanted Mike in jail.

863
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:43,250
The others too.

864
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:45,625
To what end? I don't know.
They all end up walking.

865
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:48,541
But they were in for 90 days.

866
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:49,708
No more. No less.

867
00:55:49,791 --> 00:55:52,625
Waiting to be arraigned on charges
that don't carry jail time.

868
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:54,458
I don't doubt what you're saying.

869
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:58,875
But if the revelation is that
your Bama-ass town is corrupt

870
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:02,166
and my cousin and whoever else
got fucked over,

871
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,416
I don't need convincing.

872
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,250
I didn't come here to set things right.

873
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:10,291
I just wanted Mike not dead.
Yet here we are.

874
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:11,833
They can't just run you off.

875
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:15,375
Never. It's called tactical retrograde,
and I got off easy.

876
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,250
- Well, I can keep digging...
- Respectfully, no.

877
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:23,666
All I need is transpo the fuck outta here.

878
00:56:24,208 --> 00:56:28,583
And if that's no longer cool, you can
drop me off at the next bus station.

879
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:37,291
Bus station's past where we're headed.

880
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,000
Whatever I say

881
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:21,916
is gonna fall short.

882
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:24,875
You got something to write on?

883
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:37,333
Think it over.

884
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,791
Text me something profound.

885
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:42,916
- Thought you didn't give this out.
- Yeah, well...

886
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,875
All that aside, back there,

887
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:48,708
I appreciate you giving a shit.

888
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:52,708
Well, I appreciate your appreciation.

889
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:21,666
You here for the dually?

890
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:23,791
I am.

891
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:25,541
Yes, sir.

892
00:58:25,958 --> 00:58:27,875
I'll let you take a look at her.

893
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:47,625
Move. Don't touch shit.

894
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:15,041
No.

895
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,583
Terry!

896
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:24,208
Mm... I'm in trouble.

897
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,250
Summer!

898
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:01,041
Hey!

899
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,083
Summer!

900
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,125
It's okay.

901
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,458
<i>That's the proof.
I'll tell you that right now.</i>

902
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,541
What about another city?

903
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,541
Another state?

904
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:32,750
It'll still go on my medical history.

905
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:36,333
So, you're gonna risk dying?

906
01:01:36,416 --> 01:01:39,041
- Wasn't enough to hurt me.
- How do you know?

907
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:42,666
- I can tell.
- So what'd they put in you?

908
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:46,500
- The dosage? You an "almost doctor" too?
- I fuckin' know, Terry.

909
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:50,083
I go to a hospital, it gets reported.

910
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,666
And if it's reported, the judge...

911
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:57,875
Everything gets unsealed.

912
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:01,208
I'll never get back custody.

913
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:05,291
They'll tell my little girl.

914
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:09,416
I can forget about taking the bar.

915
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:11,958
What's that?

916
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:14,000
That's your oatmeal.

917
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,458
How can they hold it against you?

918
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:20,875
I'm sure a lot of lawyers
struggle with that.

919
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:22,041
Addiction?

920
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:23,166
Yeah.

921
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:28,666
Related crimes of moral turpitude,
not so much.

922
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,083
I pawned a ride-on mower that wasn't mine.

923
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:42,958
My father-in-law's.

924
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:45,083
Mm-mm.

925
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:50,166
My husband petitioned for divorce
soon as I was charged.

926
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,375
Took our kid.

927
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:54,833
He was just waiting to pounce.
I was a wreck.

928
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:59,125
Didn't contest anything they put forward.

929
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,625
Couldn't afford a lawyer.

930
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:02,125
Um...

931
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:04,791
I just sat there in court

932
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:08,333
listening to how horrible a mother I was.

933
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:13,750
- Made a pretty solid case.
- Hey. Come on now.

934
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,875
You know what's funny?

935
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:21,083
When I took the mower...

936
01:03:21,166 --> 01:03:23,541
...it had this snowblower attachment on it.

937
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:26,833
I left it on
when I rolled it out the shed,

938
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:31,000
and that's what bumped the value
from petty theft up to grand theft.

939
01:03:34,083 --> 01:03:35,416
I'm a felon

940
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:38,291
because of a lawn mower accessory.

941
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:42,166
What?

942
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:45,416
Nothing. Go on.

943
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:47,375
Tell me.

944
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:54,500
I was just going to say that blows.

945
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,500
Go on. I want to hear this.

946
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:00,708
That's about it.

947
01:04:00,791 --> 01:04:02,583
The judge took pity on me.

948
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:05,083
I promised to stay clean.

949
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:08,791
He sealed everything up,
and I went to work for the court.

950
01:04:10,041 --> 01:04:11,541
Figured however things turned out,

951
01:04:11,625 --> 01:04:13,875
I'd never not be able
to defend myself again.

952
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:15,333
Yeah, I hear that.

953
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,500
What can I do?

954
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,250
You were right.

955
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:24,708
You should go.

956
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:27,750
You should grieve.

957
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:28,833
Mm.

958
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:30,583
I'll back off.

959
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:33,791
Show up to work like nothing happened.

960
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:35,541
Hey.

961
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:37,875
You sure you're okay?

962
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:39,916
How blue are my lips?

963
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,125
Not very.

964
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:46,083
Then, yeah.

965
01:04:52,333 --> 01:04:54,375
All this talk of defending myself.

966
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:57,708
- Here I am.
- It's the right move.

967
01:04:58,208 --> 01:05:00,125
Taking fuel away from the fire.

968
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,875
You gotta focus on your girl, you know?

969
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:08,208
I won't forget about Mike.

970
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:13,875
I'll get this truck off your lawn.

971
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,541
Morning.

972
01:05:41,791 --> 01:05:44,250
- Morning, Alex.
- Morning, Ms. McBride.

973
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,791
Oh, hey. You're supposed to
go see the judge first thing.

974
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:49,875
Okay.

975
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:58,000
Those were the terms
of your employment, were they not?

976
01:05:59,416 --> 01:06:00,416
They were.

977
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:04,666
And you understand I can only act
on the information given me.

978
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:07,791
But it's not true.

979
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:09,416
That's not me.

980
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:11,416
I believe you.

981
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:15,291
If there's nothing to it,
then there's nothing to it.

982
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:17,125
Test's not gonna lie.

983
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:20,208
If you wouldn't mind
emptying your pockets, please.

984
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:24,375
Oh, and leave your purse.
Victoria here will take you in.

985
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:36,875
You all right in there, hon?

986
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:05,541
Shit.

987
01:08:01,166 --> 01:08:03,416
<i>We're good up here.</i>

988
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:12,041
<i>106, you're clear.</i>

989
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,458
Kill that ignition!

990
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:28,875
Now toss your keys out the driver's side.

991
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:43,916
My hands good?

992
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:46,583
Sure.

993
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,083
Ten and two.

994
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:51,791
Your lights broken?

995
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:53,000
How do you mean?

996
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,916
It's just you waved me down.

997
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,750
So I'm wondering
if something's wrong with your lights.

998
01:08:58,833 --> 01:09:00,791
Something wrong with your GPS?

999
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:03,166
It was an emergency.

1000
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:05,875
You respond to emergencies
around here now?

1001
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:07,791
- It was just a friend.
- Yeah?

1002
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:11,291
She turned out to be
more trouble than you.

1003
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:13,000
It was a false alarm.

1004
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:14,500
You'll never see me again.

1005
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:16,416
That conversation was had.

1006
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:20,000
Chief handed you a winning lotto ticket.

1007
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:21,375
And you just tore it up.

1008
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:24,916
We got a dozen witnesses
saw you storm the station.

1009
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,250
Your prints are
all over the property cage,

1010
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:29,166
and there's a missing bag of money.

1011
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,583
I'm guessing,
we'll find it right here in this truck.

1012
01:09:33,916 --> 01:09:34,916
Feeling smart now?

1013
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:36,750
No, sir.

1014
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:42,916
I'll give you credit
for catching the lights though.

1015
01:09:45,291 --> 01:09:46,291
Pretty sharp.

1016
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:51,458
These new cruisers,

1017
01:09:52,708 --> 01:09:53,958
you run the lights...

1018
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,166
the dash cam starts recording.

1019
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,125
Gun!

1020
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:05,916
Fuck!

1021
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:08,083
<i>What are we doing?</i>

1022
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,708
Help!

1023
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,291
<i>Shots fired with that buckshot!</i>

1024
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,250
I got him! Clear out!

1025
01:10:38,916 --> 01:10:40,666
Get out of the truck!

1026
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:42,250
Move!

1027
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:51,500
Hit the fuckin' tires!

1028
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:24,333
You know you can't be here,

1029
01:11:24,416 --> 01:11:25,958
not without a heads-up.

1030
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:32,000
We didn't call anybody.

1031
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:37,333
Shit.

1032
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:53,791
<i>Terry? Terry?</i>

1033
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:56,166
You should stay off the phone.
I was coming to you.

1034
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:59,250
<i>Don't.
I just got a visit from the police.</i>

1035
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:01,250
Yeah, me too.

1036
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:03,333
You okay? You hurt?

1037
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:05,208
<i>They came to warn me.</i>

1038
01:13:05,291 --> 01:13:08,375
<i>Said I should leave town.
Stay away from you.</i>

1039
01:13:08,916 --> 01:13:11,166
Yeah, solid recs. Who was it?

1040
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:14,750
<i>A friend,
same one who followed us yesterday.</i>

1041
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:16,833
<i>That was for me, not you.</i>

1042
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:18,791
You mobile?

1043
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:21,833
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm packing up.</i>

1044
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:24,375
All right.

1045
01:13:24,458 --> 01:13:26,041
That Volvo, you own it?

1046
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:28,791
<i>Only thing in my life
that's paid off.</i>

1047
01:13:30,666 --> 01:13:31,666
Okay.

1048
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:33,125
Um...

1049
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:36,125
Bring your title.
I got somewhere we can go.

1050
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,375
<i>Should I pick you up?</i>

1051
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:40,916
No. I'll be good.

1052
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:45,791
All right.

1053
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,166
Don't write this down.

1054
01:13:53,875 --> 01:13:55,041
Okay.

1055
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:56,125
Summer?

1056
01:13:59,375 --> 01:14:01,083
Kan Long Chinese, go ahead.

1057
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:05,375
Uh, no brown.
White, fried, or sticky only.

1058
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:08,458
Uh-huh.

1059
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:15,500
Uh, shrimp's a dollar more.

1060
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:22,500
Two soups.

1061
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,416
No. Special soups.

1062
01:14:33,208 --> 01:14:35,833
- Another round of beers, table six.
- Uh-huh.

1063
01:14:44,583 --> 01:14:46,208
And what's your address?

1064
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:05,166
Oh my God, are you shot?

1065
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,625
Yeah. Summer, this is Mr. Liu.

1066
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,583
Hi. Sorry, I would have driven faster.

1067
01:15:13,666 --> 01:15:18,166
They had Quikclot, but I wasn't sure
if it was the gauze or the sponge, so

1068
01:15:19,541 --> 01:15:20,583
I got both.

1069
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:22,250
- Burners?
- Yeah.

1070
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:23,500
Thank you.

1071
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:27,250
And I got coconut water. If you want some.

1072
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:28,541
No, I'm good.

1073
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:31,083
Ah, traveled down pretty clean.

1074
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:32,416
Still a couple fragments,

1075
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:35,458
but I'll leave it in
if you're gonna be moving around.

1076
01:15:35,541 --> 01:15:37,250
You should be at a hospital.

1077
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:40,083
Look who's talking.

1078
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:42,250
This is different.

1079
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:45,625
Yeah, well,
Mr. Liu was a field medic in Korea.

1080
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:46,708
Oh.

1081
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,916
Thank you for your service, sir.

1082
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:54,958
He's Chinese.

1083
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:57,875
Fought for the other side.

1084
01:15:57,958 --> 01:16:01,000
Well, it's good we can all come together.

1085
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,958
Make sure he finishes his.

1086
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:12,458
Hm.

1087
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:24,208
Walk me through it.

1088
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:25,541
I want everything.

1089
01:16:25,625 --> 01:16:29,041
- It's just I didn't get that far.
- It's what's keeping me alive.

1090
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:32,375
They just tried to kill you.

1091
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:34,666
And no one's called in the cavalry.

1092
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:38,250
With what they could pin on me, should be
a federal task force dropping a tac team

1093
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:39,750
on the roof right now.

1094
01:16:42,291 --> 01:16:45,083
- They're keeping it quiet.
- Because of what you found.

1095
01:16:45,666 --> 01:16:46,708
So...

1096
01:16:47,791 --> 01:16:51,500
From what I pulled, it's clear they're
manipulating defendants' jail time.

1097
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:55,666
What's driving it? I don't know.
That's what they're protecting.

1098
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:58,541
They got your folder, right?
So it's not just what you pulled.

1099
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:00,791
No. Folder's why they're onto us.

1100
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:03,833
The case files are public record.
Anyone can look 'em up.

1101
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:06,708
Okay, so is that enough
to take to the press, start a ruckus?

1102
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:09,625
No, holding them for 90 days, hiking bail,

1103
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:12,708
the individual acts
aren't necessarily illegal.

1104
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:14,208
It's discretion of the court,

1105
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:17,333
so the judge can double your fine
for tracking mud on his floor.

1106
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:18,416
So he's in on it.

1107
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:20,833
When the cases do reach his bench,

1108
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:23,875
he lets 'em off, mostly full dismissals.

1109
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:26,791
If anything, he's pushing back.

1110
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:29,333
So we get kinetic.
Find out what he's pushing against.

1111
01:17:29,416 --> 01:17:31,083
We're over the town line.

1112
01:17:31,166 --> 01:17:33,833
- We should keep going.
- Yeah, well, maybe you.

1113
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:38,083
These officers are quiet
because they're vulnerable.

1114
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:42,250
Whatever window we have,

1115
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:45,458
I guarantee you they're closing it.

1116
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:48,458
They do,

1117
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:50,458
I'm dead.

1118
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:52,875
Won't matter where I am.

1119
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:54,458
You think me too?

1120
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:58,541
Bottom line up front?

1121
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:03,208
I don't see how they let you walk away.

1122
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:05,791
Who knows?

1123
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:09,166
Maybe they'll cut you a deal.

1124
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:10,666
Hell, they let me walk.

1125
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:13,708
- Then I pulled you back in.
- Yeah, and it's good you did.

1126
01:18:15,083 --> 01:18:17,000
When they sent me on my way...

1127
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:20,833
I was grateful.

1128
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:27,208
Like my whole life was back ahead of me.
I even heard Mike telling me it was okay.

1129
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:30,208
How I train,

1130
01:18:30,833 --> 01:18:33,541
what I teach, most of it
comes down to self-preservation.

1131
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:35,666
So I guess I just acted accordingly.

1132
01:18:36,166 --> 01:18:37,041
Anyone would.

1133
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:39,208
Yeah, but the chief didn't give me an out.

1134
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:41,083
I gave him one.

1135
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:44,666
And that wasn't Mike's voice.

1136
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:46,583
That was mine.

1137
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:48,500
This shit's far from okay,

1138
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:51,333
and these cops might end up on top.

1139
01:18:51,416 --> 01:18:55,666
I'm not pretending here, but they
sure as shit don't get any more outs.

1140
01:18:58,333 --> 01:18:59,333
And Mike,

1141
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:01,750
I hope he's in a better place.

1142
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:05,500
I don't know enough about the afterlife
to trust in it, so while I'm here,

1143
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:07,583
and he's not,

1144
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:11,208
I gotta haunt these motherfuckers myself.

1145
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:13,666
All right?

1146
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:18,125
What about taking fuel away from the fire?

1147
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:19,708
Mm. It's different now.

1148
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:21,291
How so?

1149
01:19:25,666 --> 01:19:26,750
We're the fire.

1150
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:01,083
What about your friend
on the force?

1151
01:20:03,375 --> 01:20:06,208
- Think he'd be willing to talk?
- Never said it was a he.

1152
01:20:06,291 --> 01:20:08,250
"He," "she" fine.

1153
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:09,541
Codename "Serpico."

1154
01:20:10,666 --> 01:20:13,125
Would they talk?
Take this to the state police?

1155
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:15,166
No, they were clear on that.

1156
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:19,083
Warning me was risky enough.

1157
01:20:20,291 --> 01:20:21,208
You all right?

1158
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:26,708
Just have a feeling
tonight's going to get pretty dark.

1159
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:32,250
Isn't that what nights do?

1160
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:36,041
<i>Okay, three, two, one,</i>

1161
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:37,125
go!

1162
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:41,333
First is Isaiah!

1163
01:20:41,416 --> 01:20:44,791
Ryan in second,
Jack's in third, Henry fourth!

1164
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:45,875
Nice heat, guys!

1165
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:47,666
All right, let's bring those back...

1166
01:20:48,166 --> 01:20:49,166
Hey, buddy!

1167
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:51,041
Summer!

1168
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:52,250
How'd you do?

1169
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:54,875
Bad. I got taken out
in the fourth-place runoff.

1170
01:20:57,708 --> 01:20:59,041
Super cool.

1171
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:03,375
At least you made it yourself. You're
mostly competing against other dads.

1172
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:05,541
Ben. Go cheer.

1173
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:12,458
All right, let's see if we can get
a new leader out there! Ready?

1174
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:15,208
We know they're locking
defendants up and letting them go.

1175
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:17,791
We have no idea why,
but our local PD is willing to kill

1176
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:19,333
to keep us from finding out.

1177
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:22,166
- They came into my home!
- What do you want me to say?

1178
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:24,750
- That you're on the right path?
- Are we?

1179
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:38,541
I can't answer your questions.

1180
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:40,916
- Fuck this guy.
- It'd be aiding and abetting.

1181
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,708
Whatever it is you're doing,
I can be named an accessory.

1182
01:21:44,791 --> 01:21:47,871
I don't report you the minute you leave,
it could be seen as a failure to act.

1183
01:21:47,916 --> 01:21:51,875
If I inflict pain before you answer,
does that help from a legal standpoint?

1184
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:55,208
Listen. Even if I wanted to,
I don't have the answers to give.

1185
01:21:55,291 --> 01:21:57,125
Okay? And that's by design.

1186
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:00,333
- I don't want to know.
- No, that!

1187
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:02,791
You!

1188
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:06,708
You're a fucking tumor, Elliot!

1189
01:22:18,791 --> 01:22:19,791
If I did...

1190
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:24,583
If I did want to know...

1191
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:29,875
- I would have some questions.
- Yeah, like what?

1192
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:36,041
Like how far back does it go?
What you found.

1193
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:38,416
Mostly recent, less than two years.

1194
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:42,791
- Mm-hm. Why is that?
- I searched bail records. Uh...

1195
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,333
Probably didn't dig deep enough.

1196
01:22:46,166 --> 01:22:47,166
Or?

1197
01:22:49,875 --> 01:22:51,708
That's as deep as it goes?

1198
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:55,625
And if that's true, I would also wonder...

1199
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:58,125
...was there something that coincided
in that timeframe?

1200
01:22:58,208 --> 01:23:00,541
Something pertinent?

1201
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:04,083
- The civil case?
- Dad!

1202
01:23:04,708 --> 01:23:07,458
Isaiah won again. Can we go now?

1203
01:23:07,541 --> 01:23:09,375
Yes.

1204
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,333
Hey!

1205
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:14,833
That case, the settlement,
it put pressure on the police.

1206
01:23:14,916 --> 01:23:16,208
Oversight.

1207
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:18,291
- Turned things around.
- Did it?

1208
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:20,208
It's been quiet ever since.

1209
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:24,750
So there's your big question.

1210
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:31,750
You got no answers from me.

1211
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:38,083
Lawsuit didn't
turn things around.

1212
01:23:38,708 --> 01:23:40,250
Turned them upside down.

1213
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:55,458
<i>Well, this is a surprise.</i>

1214
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:58,875
<i>A commission in the cavalry, too, huh?</i>

1215
01:23:59,791 --> 01:24:02,083
<i>I see you got
the commission you were after.</i>

1216
01:24:02,166 --> 01:24:05,375
<i>- You know these men, Rader?
- Yes, sir, very well.</i>

1217
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:08,166
<i>This one, Stuart, comes from
a rich slave owning family in Virginia.</i>

1218
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:12,333
<i>He called you a lying renegade once,
and I jumped him for it...</i>

1219
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,041
It's okay.

1220
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:19,208
I'll talk.

1221
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:33,500
Jesus.

1222
01:24:34,416 --> 01:24:36,208
There's no need to hurt me.

1223
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:42,625
Where's Summer?

1224
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:44,458
Don't know.

1225
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:48,125
- I was gonna ask you.
- Elliot called.

1226
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:51,833
- I need for her to hear this.
- Who? What? Where?

1227
01:24:51,916 --> 01:24:53,000
No time for why.

1228
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:55,166
She's owed it.

1229
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,708
Would you believe
I was protecting you this morning?

1230
01:25:00,666 --> 01:25:02,708
I'm sure you convinced yourself.

1231
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:07,458
I was afraid they'd do worse,
and I'm deeply sorry about your brother.

1232
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:08,541
Cousin.

1233
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:10,625
Your cousin.

1234
01:25:15,875 --> 01:25:17,000
So why is he dead?

1235
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:21,208
<i>- Bishop v The Town of Shelby Springs.</i>
- You're familiar with it?

1236
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:24,666
Just some of the fallout.
That the chief was named personally.

1237
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:27,208
Illegal search snowballed
into a wrongful death.

1238
01:25:27,291 --> 01:25:30,083
Settlement damn near bankrupted the town.

1239
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:32,791
His department was deemed uninsurable.

1240
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:35,916
Got a year to modernize, clean up its act.

1241
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,625
And it did, on paper.

1242
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:39,208
Uh-huh, on paper.

1243
01:25:39,291 --> 01:25:42,541
So you sell out your bench
to protect Sandy Burnne?

1244
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:44,791
Hell no, we wanted him gone.

1245
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:47,166
The reform mandate
was a ploy to shut him down,

1246
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:49,500
hand over our contract
to the state police.

1247
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,291
There was no money for him to comply.

1248
01:25:52,375 --> 01:25:54,083
So he goes out, gets his own.

1249
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:56,708
Did 100,000
in forfeitures his first month.

1250
01:25:56,791 --> 01:25:59,333
- He cut you in on it?
- Me and every other taxpayer.

1251
01:25:59,416 --> 01:26:01,625
They seized my cash.
You told me it was legal.

1252
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:03,583
It is. That's what I don't get.

1253
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:07,541
That money flows back into debt service,
payroll, public works.

1254
01:26:07,625 --> 01:26:09,458
That's Christmas lights in December,

1255
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:13,958
fireworks on the Fourth of July,
and a nice little old tax cut on top.

1256
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:15,583
Everyone holds their seat.

1257
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:19,125
But how are a handful of misdemeanor
defendants a threat to all this?

1258
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:21,791
And boil this shit down... quick.

1259
01:26:21,875 --> 01:26:23,083
Liability.

1260
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:25,708
Traffic stop goes wrong,

1261
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:26,875
an arrest gets rough,

1262
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:31,166
anything that might put the department
in legal jeopardy, they'll flag the case.

1263
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:33,208
Kick the charges down to misdemeanors.

1264
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:35,125
So it stays in town court.

1265
01:26:36,166 --> 01:26:39,291
Where there's no public defender
to contest the bail or adjournments.

1266
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:41,916
- Keep 'em in purgatory.
- For 90 days.

1267
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,625
Why is it always 90 days?

1268
01:26:43,708 --> 01:26:46,458
I guess if I was smarter,
I'd have mixed that up some.

1269
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:49,625
Didn't want to hold them
a day longer than we had to.

1270
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:52,416
The retention period?

1271
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Shit.

1272
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,416
The hard drives at the courthouse.

1273
01:26:57,375 --> 01:26:58,916
- That's it?
- That's it.

1274
01:26:59,458 --> 01:27:03,000
Their dash cam videos.
It's part of the settlement.

1275
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:06,750
We store their footage.
They can't access it on their own.

1276
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:08,041
But you can?

1277
01:27:08,125 --> 01:27:10,375
Only if it's deemed evidentiary.

1278
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:14,166
If it's not held or subpoenaed
for 90 days, it's deleted.

1279
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:19,375
All right.

1280
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:21,750
What's on Mike's video?

1281
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:25,458
- What'd they do to him?
- Enough to get us sued.

1282
01:27:25,541 --> 01:27:27,166
- Have you seen it?
- No.

1283
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:30,416
Let me guess.
You don't wanna fucking know.

1284
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:32,583
Wouldn't matter if I did.

1285
01:27:32,666 --> 01:27:35,416
Lose another lawsuit
and it's disincorporation,

1286
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,708
Shelby Springs disappears.
Swallowed up by the parish.

1287
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:43,500
- Y'all gonna leave me like this?
- What, alive? Yeah. For now.

1288
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:46,541
You knew Judy.

1289
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:48,958
What would she think about all this?

1290
01:27:49,041 --> 01:27:50,625
What you're doing to me.

1291
01:27:50,708 --> 01:27:52,625
Well, if she knew what you did...

1292
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:57,416
she'd want to watch.

1293
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:04,333
These yours?
Need to take one before we go?

1294
01:28:04,416 --> 01:28:06,416
Mm, I'm good for the night.

1295
01:28:07,083 --> 01:28:10,250
This is his wife's... and it's empty.

1296
01:28:10,333 --> 01:28:13,375
Oh, shit. I forgot to feed the cat.

1297
01:28:13,458 --> 01:28:15,083
- Shit.
- Would you mind?

1298
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:17,250
Hey, how many did you take?

1299
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,166
Where's the fucking cat food?

1300
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:39,958
Hey.

1301
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:42,041
You think he'll make it?

1302
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:45,083
Yeah.

1303
01:28:45,166 --> 01:28:48,375
Hey, it's cool if you gotta step back,
start thinking about your girl.

1304
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:51,625
She never left my mind in there.

1305
01:28:52,375 --> 01:28:55,250
Him, Elliot,

1306
01:28:55,833 --> 01:28:59,375
this whole fucking town couldn't form
a single spine between them.

1307
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:05,958
- If I do get her back...
<i>- When</i> you get her back.

1308
01:29:06,041 --> 01:29:08,000
She's gotta know I got one.

1309
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:12,416
- Where do you keep the drives?
- Basement.

1310
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,625
The catacombs?

1311
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:15,541
Yeah, but there's an alarm.

1312
01:29:16,125 --> 01:29:17,875
Yeah. And moisture.

1313
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:19,791
And a lot of rot.

1314
01:29:42,208 --> 01:29:44,750
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1315
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:06,333
I love it down here.

1316
01:30:06,416 --> 01:30:08,083
You can smell the history.

1317
01:30:08,166 --> 01:30:09,250
Where to?

1318
01:30:44,541 --> 01:30:47,166
- I can't see.
- Let your eyes adjust.

1319
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:49,250
Don't wanna go out like Watergate.

1320
01:30:50,541 --> 01:30:52,500
- Thanks.
- That ain't me.

1321
01:31:09,125 --> 01:31:10,833
A dummy check and we're out.

1322
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:21,708
Come on.

1323
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:44,416
You smell that?

1324
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:47,833
That ain't history.

1325
01:31:49,916 --> 01:31:51,833
Let's leave.

1326
01:31:51,916 --> 01:31:53,375
Oh, shit!

1327
01:31:55,916 --> 01:31:58,500
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Shit!

1328
01:32:05,541 --> 01:32:06,541
Coconut water.

1329
01:32:08,041 --> 01:32:11,666
All right, they're expecting
a blaze. We got 30 seconds tops.

1330
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:14,041
Okay, pull those. I'll get these.

1331
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:24,291
Damn it.

1332
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:27,791
Okay, we exfil.

1333
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:30,458
Weigh our options.

1334
01:32:30,541 --> 01:32:31,666
Hold on.

1335
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:33,958
SD cards.

1336
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:36,708
They write over 'em in the field
so they never get wiped.

1337
01:32:36,791 --> 01:32:38,291
Straight from their dash cams.

1338
01:32:38,375 --> 01:32:40,708
- It's just last week's but...
- Mike's in there?

1339
01:32:43,458 --> 01:32:44,500
All right.

1340
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:53,333
Wait.

1341
01:32:54,583 --> 01:32:55,958
What are you doing?

1342
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:58,083
If we don't restart it, they will.

1343
01:32:58,166 --> 01:32:59,333
It's a landmarked building.

1344
01:32:59,416 --> 01:33:02,041
That "history" down here,
for a lot of people?

1345
01:33:02,125 --> 01:33:03,833
It's got a pretty foul funk to it.

1346
01:33:06,291 --> 01:33:09,208
Yeah. Let it burn.

1347
01:33:14,625 --> 01:33:15,625
Looking now.

1348
01:33:15,666 --> 01:33:17,791
Just to be sure. Just in case. Go!

1349
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:23,916
We're good! Move!

1350
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:27,250
Sweep the courthouse, then we're out.

1351
01:33:39,208 --> 01:33:41,666
- You go.
<i>- We</i> go. We got 'em.

1352
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:43,958
No. Start the car. I can't...

1353
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,208
I gotta get something back.

1354
01:33:48,291 --> 01:33:49,958
That'll send 'em running.

1355
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,708
Go slow, go steady.

1356
01:33:52,791 --> 01:33:54,750
Meet me in the alley. Yeah?

1357
01:33:54,833 --> 01:33:55,833
Yeah.

1358
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Fuck!

1359
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:15,625
Bingo!

1360
01:35:16,458 --> 01:35:17,958
You're kiddin'.

1361
01:35:21,083 --> 01:35:23,208
How's that for a dummy check?

1362
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:48,666
Turn that shit off!

1363
01:35:50,416 --> 01:35:52,416
Come on. Come on.

1364
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:01,041
Fuck.

1365
01:37:45,833 --> 01:37:47,083
Fuck! Fuck!

1366
01:37:47,791 --> 01:37:48,791
Shit!

1367
01:37:50,208 --> 01:37:51,791
Get the fuck off me!

1368
01:38:10,083 --> 01:38:12,208
You wanna be asleep
when I cuff you or awake?

1369
01:38:12,291 --> 01:38:13,875
All right, okay!

1370
01:38:16,958 --> 01:38:18,041
Fuck!

1371
01:38:35,291 --> 01:38:37,250
Had to assume you'd shoot on sight.

1372
01:38:38,083 --> 01:38:39,208
Is she hurt?

1373
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,541
Not that I could tell, no.

1374
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:43,125
Where are they taking her?

1375
01:38:43,208 --> 01:38:46,416
I don't know.
Look, man. We're not all, like...

1376
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:50,041
I'm married. Okay? Okay. Hey, hey.

1377
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:51,916
I got a kid. So...

1378
01:38:53,666 --> 01:38:54,666
Yeah?

1379
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:56,750
So does she.

1380
01:38:58,583 --> 01:39:00,791
So let's not waste any fucking time.

1381
01:39:04,583 --> 01:39:05,583
Get up.

1382
01:39:14,583 --> 01:39:16,500
Get me someone who knows.

1383
01:39:21,166 --> 01:39:22,750
106, come in.

1384
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:24,750
This is 103.

1385
01:39:30,083 --> 01:39:32,666
<i>103, we're 10-3. Keep it quiet.</i>

1386
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,208
106, is that in regards
to the arson or the kidnapping? Over.

1387
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:46,625
You got ten seconds
before I start trying new frequencies.

1388
01:39:46,708 --> 01:39:48,541
Got some cards I wanna offload.

1389
01:39:55,625 --> 01:39:56,916
Left utility pocket.

1390
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,083
<i>What brand are they?</i>

1391
01:40:17,583 --> 01:40:19,791
Extreme Pro, 64 gigs.

1392
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:25,458
<i>Okay, then. You know Rebel Ridge?</i>

1393
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:27,416
No.

1394
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:29,916
<i>Drop you a pin. Settle up.</i>

1395
01:40:30,666 --> 01:40:31,666
A swap?

1396
01:40:32,458 --> 01:40:33,916
You think I'm stupid?

1397
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,208
<i>No. I think you're smart.</i>

1398
01:40:39,291 --> 01:40:40,750
Fuck it. First light.

1399
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:42,666
<i>How about right now?</i>

1400
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:44,958
No, I got to see what's waiting for me.

1401
01:40:46,458 --> 01:40:48,083
Works out well for you too.

1402
01:40:48,666 --> 01:40:49,666
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

1403
01:40:50,333 --> 01:40:51,333
Yeah.

1404
01:40:52,666 --> 01:40:54,458
You just might see me comin'.

1405
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:04,458
I put too much sauce on that?

1406
01:41:06,083 --> 01:41:07,916
- Pop the trunk.
- Fuck.

1407
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:34,833
What you got in that?

1408
01:41:35,666 --> 01:41:38,166
Number 4 buck, double-aught following.

1409
01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:46,166
Lose the number 4,

1410
01:41:47,208 --> 01:41:48,791
load up some slugs

1411
01:41:49,833 --> 01:41:51,583
'case he grabs hold of someone.

1412
01:42:17,791 --> 01:42:19,375
Check in with Patrol.

1413
01:42:19,916 --> 01:42:21,125
He should be here.

1414
01:42:21,625 --> 01:42:22,750
Sun's barely up.

1415
01:42:26,291 --> 01:42:28,250
If he isn't early, he's late.

1416
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Yeah?

1417
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:41,500
Hello?

1418
01:42:42,541 --> 01:42:44,166
You know what's funny, Chief?

1419
01:42:45,458 --> 01:42:48,708
You know,
nothing comes to mind right off-hand.

1420
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:51,958
Before two days ago,
I'd never really been in a street fight.

1421
01:42:52,875 --> 01:42:55,958
I mean, a few scraps in a schoolyard,

1422
01:42:56,041 --> 01:42:59,333
<i>but other than that,
nothing outside the gym.</i>

1423
01:43:00,583 --> 01:43:02,458
Well, I've been in plenty.

1424
01:43:02,541 --> 01:43:04,101
<i>Yeah, I can feel that from you.</i>

1425
01:43:04,166 --> 01:43:06,416
That combative energy.

1426
01:43:07,125 --> 01:43:09,083
<i>It builds up. You know?</i>

1427
01:43:11,083 --> 01:43:13,458
<i>108.
Got a visual on our suspect.</i>

1428
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,541
<i>It's not just you. I know.</i>

1429
01:43:17,666 --> 01:43:20,041
- They're on him.
<i>- Both sides contribute.</i>

1430
01:43:21,791 --> 01:43:25,541
Are you taking responsibility
or dodging it?

1431
01:43:25,625 --> 01:43:27,166
<i>108, can you confirm?</i>

1432
01:43:30,583 --> 01:43:31,583
Stand by.

1433
01:43:33,291 --> 01:43:34,375
<i>Copy you, 108.</i>

1434
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:36,583
<i>Standing by. 10...</i>

1435
01:43:39,791 --> 01:43:41,666
<i>Pack it up. He's ready to move.</i>

1436
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:46,541
<i>People getting hurt now
either way. The fire last night...</i>

1437
01:43:47,875 --> 01:43:50,791
- Yeah, I heard about that.
- Yeah, it's gotten out of hand.

1438
01:43:51,833 --> 01:43:53,583
Real soup sandwich.

1439
01:43:53,666 --> 01:43:55,083
We can agree on that.

1440
01:43:55,625 --> 01:43:58,875
Got me thinking about
that conversation we had in the cruiser,

1441
01:43:58,958 --> 01:44:00,125
about de-escalation.

1442
01:44:01,583 --> 01:44:04,083
<i>That also takes both sides, you know?</i>

1443
01:44:05,041 --> 01:44:06,458
So I was thinking,

1444
01:44:07,791 --> 01:44:09,541
what if we just walk away?

1445
01:44:09,625 --> 01:44:13,458
- Well, now you're starting to talk some...
- But then I was like, "Nah."

1446
01:44:22,166 --> 01:44:24,166
Don't you fucking move!

1447
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:25,541
Goddamn it!

1448
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:27,166
Negative! It's McGill.

1449
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:28,625
Got him all tied up.

1450
01:44:44,125 --> 01:44:46,875
He's goin' for the cash. Get on the radio!

1451
01:44:49,166 --> 01:44:50,833
All units, be advised...

1452
01:44:59,875 --> 01:45:01,208
<i>Copy you.</i>

1453
01:45:01,291 --> 01:45:02,500
Piece of shit!

1454
01:45:02,583 --> 01:45:04,208
<i>Repeat, 10-19.</i>

1455
01:45:04,291 --> 01:45:05,875
<i>Suspect is at the station.</i>

1456
01:45:05,958 --> 01:45:09,166
<i>- Request immediate assistance. Hurry.</i>
- Find him and leave some for me!

1457
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:10,958
<i>We got walls coming down.</i>

1458
01:45:13,166 --> 01:45:14,833
<i>Copy. 10-76, en route.</i>

1459
01:45:15,666 --> 01:45:16,750
Something wrong?

1460
01:45:19,166 --> 01:45:20,208
No, actually.

1461
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:23,333
Think it's all gonna line up pretty well.

1462
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,791
Be advised, this is a silent run.

1463
01:45:27,875 --> 01:45:30,041
10-85. Nobody runs code.

1464
01:45:40,416 --> 01:45:44,666
All right, boss? Can you hold off?
We gotta get to the station.

1465
01:45:59,958 --> 01:46:02,333
How'd I know you wouldn't
show up to your own show...

1466
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:10,083
- Hey! It's okay.
- Put that down!

1467
01:46:10,166 --> 01:46:11,708
- Put your weapon down!
- It's okay!

1468
01:46:11,791 --> 01:46:13,833
- Get on the ground! I'm gonna shoot!
- It's okay.

1469
01:46:13,916 --> 01:46:14,958
It's a beanbag round.

1470
01:46:15,041 --> 01:46:17,000
Less lethal.

1471
01:46:18,458 --> 01:46:20,708
- Listen, I know who you are.
- Shoot him!

1472
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:23,083
Summer didn't give you up.
It ain't hard to narrow down.

1473
01:46:23,166 --> 01:46:25,208
- We call you "Serpico." Hey!
- Shoot him!

1474
01:46:25,291 --> 01:46:27,791
Don't worry about him. Worry about her.

1475
01:46:27,875 --> 01:46:30,416
Even if you don't have my back,
I know you got hers.

1476
01:46:31,583 --> 01:46:33,458
- What you want me to do?
- Hear me out.

1477
01:46:33,541 --> 01:46:35,000
Shoot that motherfucker...

1478
01:46:35,083 --> 01:46:36,250
Sit down!

1479
01:46:47,666 --> 01:46:50,750
<i>102, we are at the scene. We got a...</i>

1480
01:46:55,416 --> 01:46:58,250
Whatever's on these,
he's willing to kill over.

1481
01:46:58,333 --> 01:46:59,666
You can go ahead.

1482
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:03,208
Release 'em. See what happens.

1483
01:47:03,291 --> 01:47:05,000
Yeah. I'm with you on that.

1484
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,333
Got this off your boys, though.

1485
01:47:10,083 --> 01:47:12,291
All right, here's the new deal, Chief.

1486
01:47:12,375 --> 01:47:13,958
I'm seizing your shit.

1487
01:47:15,458 --> 01:47:19,500
When Summer McBride is safe,
I hand myself in to the state police.

1488
01:47:20,375 --> 01:47:21,375
You get it back.

1489
01:47:23,666 --> 01:47:24,666
Otherwise...

1490
01:47:29,666 --> 01:47:30,916
It all burns.

1491
01:47:36,416 --> 01:47:38,125
Our guys just pulled up.

1492
01:47:39,958 --> 01:47:40,958
Okay.

1493
01:48:21,625 --> 01:48:24,345
- A lot of hardware out there.
- I've seen what you can do.

1494
01:48:24,375 --> 01:48:28,458
So believe me. I'll put two rounds
in your head if you move an inch.

1495
01:48:31,541 --> 01:48:34,166
105 exiting station with suspect.

1496
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:35,791
Hold your fire. Confirm.

1497
01:48:35,875 --> 01:48:39,458
<i>105, you have Terry Richmond? Over.</i>

1498
01:48:39,541 --> 01:48:42,166
10-4. Confirm. Hold your fire.

1499
01:48:45,791 --> 01:48:47,791
<i>10-4, holding fire.</i>

1500
01:48:52,875 --> 01:48:54,333
Nobody dies today.

1501
01:48:55,833 --> 01:48:57,750
We'll sort this out somewhere safe.

1502
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,166
Hands on your head.

1503
01:49:12,666 --> 01:49:13,916
Piece of shit.

1504
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:15,625
Feel familiar?

1505
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:17,930
Except for the weight of my gun.

1506
01:49:18,916 --> 01:49:19,916
Stop there.

1507
01:49:20,625 --> 01:49:21,958
Put down the bag.

1508
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:29,458
Chief's cuffed to the property cage.

1509
01:49:29,541 --> 01:49:31,583
Careful, he's pissed.

1510
01:49:32,166 --> 01:49:33,708
He have drives on him?

1511
01:49:33,791 --> 01:49:36,500
- He did. Says there's some...
- Stolen property.

1512
01:49:41,041 --> 01:49:42,083
Where they at?

1513
01:49:58,541 --> 01:49:59,541
Well done.

1514
01:50:02,291 --> 01:50:04,416
Got to get you out on patrol.

1515
01:50:05,666 --> 01:50:07,416
I feel dumb, man.

1516
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:10,291
I mean,

1517
01:50:11,375 --> 01:50:12,833
your girl's free to go.

1518
01:50:14,375 --> 01:50:15,625
It's just, uh...

1519
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:26,708
She's pretty zonked out.

1520
01:50:28,375 --> 01:50:30,958
Thought I gave her a solid search,

1521
01:50:31,041 --> 01:50:33,333
but I missed that rig she had on her.

1522
01:50:34,541 --> 01:50:37,500
Must've hidden it somewhere sneaky.

1523
01:50:37,583 --> 01:50:40,791
Shot up in the backseat
when I wasn't looking.

1524
01:50:42,708 --> 01:50:45,208
I'd step back.

1525
01:50:45,291 --> 01:50:48,250
- Hold on.
- Shh. Shh. Shh. Shhh.

1526
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:49,750
Listen.

1527
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:56,833
Oh, man.

1528
01:50:59,166 --> 01:51:00,416
That snoring thing.

1529
01:51:01,416 --> 01:51:02,750
Shit creeps me out.

1530
01:51:04,625 --> 01:51:06,041
At least it'll be peaceful.

1531
01:51:06,125 --> 01:51:08,166
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

1532
01:51:08,250 --> 01:51:10,583
- Step back from the bag.
- That's fucked.

1533
01:51:10,666 --> 01:51:11,833
Hold on now, Ev.

1534
01:51:11,916 --> 01:51:13,208
We're okay here.

1535
01:51:13,291 --> 01:51:15,000
- Are we?
- Yes, table it.

1536
01:51:15,083 --> 01:51:17,541
Once he's in custody
and she's on her way to the ER.

1537
01:51:17,625 --> 01:51:20,666
- We wrap this up here. Let it play out.
- We're sworn officers!

1538
01:51:20,750 --> 01:51:25,125
It's a gift. We got her on a legit B&E,
ties her directly to the fire.

1539
01:51:25,208 --> 01:51:28,000
Drives are gone.
She goes away, this all goes away.

1540
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:31,340
We'll get commendations for putting a hole
in this motherfucker's chest!

1541
01:51:31,375 --> 01:51:33,791
- Stand down.
- Do not point your weapon at me!

1542
01:51:33,875 --> 01:51:35,755
She goes to the fucking hospital!

1543
01:51:35,791 --> 01:51:37,791
You're the shit magnet
that started this!

1544
01:51:37,875 --> 01:51:40,041
- Stand down! Don't do it!
- Serpico.

1545
01:51:40,125 --> 01:51:42,005
- I won't watch her die!
- Put that weapon down!

1546
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,333
Sorry, Ev. Goddammit.

1547
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:53,833
- Fuck.
- It's just the leg.

1548
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:58,041
He'll be back on light duty in a week,
drawing full salary.

1549
01:51:59,083 --> 01:52:00,833
Sir, he's bleeding bad.

1550
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,458
Looks like you nicked
something there, Chief.

1551
01:52:06,541 --> 01:52:08,458
- Shit.
- Call Medical.

1552
01:52:08,541 --> 01:52:11,125
No! Now, hold on. Hold on.

1553
01:52:11,916 --> 01:52:13,208
Just hold on.

1554
01:52:14,208 --> 01:52:15,458
We all saw it.

1555
01:52:15,541 --> 01:52:17,708
It was either him or... or Steve.

1556
01:52:17,791 --> 01:52:19,416
It was him or all of us.

1557
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:21,000
Listen up now.

1558
01:52:21,083 --> 01:52:22,625
We can't turn on each other,

1559
01:52:22,708 --> 01:52:26,083
because that's the way this whole
goddamn thing implodes, you hear me?

1560
01:52:27,625 --> 01:52:30,083
- Hey, watch your back!
- I got him.

1561
01:52:35,083 --> 01:52:36,250
Go around there.

1562
01:52:36,333 --> 01:52:38,958
The suspect is armed! He goes down!

1563
01:52:39,041 --> 01:52:41,958
- He does not get back up!
- Chief!

1564
01:52:44,375 --> 01:52:45,625
Light him up!

1565
01:52:51,125 --> 01:52:53,083
Use those sting balls, the round ones.

1566
01:52:55,083 --> 01:52:57,041
- Fuck.
- Hold your fire!

1567
01:52:57,125 --> 01:53:00,041
Watch his cross flare!

1568
01:53:00,125 --> 01:53:01,458
- Go!
- Fuck!

1569
01:53:06,083 --> 01:53:08,333
She's in pretty bad shape.
You guys carry Narcan?

1570
01:53:08,416 --> 01:53:11,583
Above the center console.
Most of us got kids.

1571
01:53:11,666 --> 01:53:13,375
Roger that. I'll make a run.

1572
01:53:13,458 --> 01:53:16,291
Listen, you hit those disco lights,
it's gonna activate...

1573
01:53:16,375 --> 01:53:17,500
Dash cam.

1574
01:53:17,583 --> 01:53:19,208
Why? So I can record my own death?

1575
01:53:19,291 --> 01:53:21,166
No. Mine.

1576
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:23,541
They got pre-event recording.

1577
01:53:23,625 --> 01:53:25,625
You hit the lights, the camera goes live,

1578
01:53:25,708 --> 01:53:28,708
records three minutes
before you hit the switch.

1579
01:53:28,791 --> 01:53:31,583
- Figure you got about two minutes left.
- Shit, maybe you too.

1580
01:53:31,666 --> 01:53:34,750
Unless you put a finger right up in it.

1581
01:53:34,833 --> 01:53:36,291
Move to flank, he's got...

1582
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:47,500
Incoming!

1583
01:53:55,458 --> 01:53:57,000
Not sure who to shoot at.

1584
01:53:58,125 --> 01:54:00,416
- Move up! Hold your fire!
- Then maybe don't shoot.

1585
01:54:02,583 --> 01:54:04,000
Barnett, go!

1586
01:54:04,083 --> 01:54:06,541
- West, Tyler, get up here!
- Hold your fire!

1587
01:54:22,416 --> 01:54:24,833
- He's by the truck!
- Which truck?

1588
01:54:35,666 --> 01:54:37,500
Move the fuck away from him!

1589
01:54:41,083 --> 01:54:43,791
Do not fire!
Hold your fucking fire!

1590
01:54:43,875 --> 01:54:46,583
- Where is he?
- Do you see him?

1591
01:54:46,666 --> 01:54:47,791
Call it out!

1592
01:54:48,416 --> 01:54:49,875
Do not fucking fire...

1593
01:54:50,625 --> 01:54:52,250
Neckbone, motherfucker!

1594
01:55:10,750 --> 01:55:13,375
No shot!

1595
01:55:13,458 --> 01:55:17,208
- Are those guys on the road block?
- Keep those boys out of this!

1596
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,375
Get some water.

1597
01:55:20,375 --> 01:55:22,833
Can anybody fucking see him?

1598
01:55:27,791 --> 01:55:30,583
He's moving!

1599
01:55:47,083 --> 01:55:48,291
Shit!

1600
01:55:49,583 --> 01:55:51,166
Go after that car!

1601
01:55:52,708 --> 01:55:54,000
Hang on, McBride!

1602
01:55:57,583 --> 01:55:59,875
Hey! That's Evan Marston
back there!

1603
01:56:01,708 --> 01:56:04,458
Keep that pressure up!
I need you to walk me through this!

1604
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,625
Forget the instructions.
Throw 'em out. Just open it up.

1605
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:16,500
You don't know how to...
You don't gotta prime it.

1606
01:56:16,583 --> 01:56:19,791
Just pick a nostril and deploy it.
One push.

1607
01:56:19,875 --> 01:56:21,375
- That's it.
- That's it?

1608
01:56:21,458 --> 01:56:24,125
That's it, man.
Just give her a couple minutes.

1609
01:56:24,208 --> 01:56:27,291
Here we go! I'm picking you up!

1610
01:56:32,708 --> 01:56:35,416
I say we let him out.
Take him on the road.

1611
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:37,000
McBride, hear me?

1612
01:56:37,083 --> 01:56:39,083
- I need you to breathe!
- Fuck outta my...

1613
01:56:39,125 --> 01:56:41,166
Go!

1614
01:56:42,416 --> 01:56:43,625
Go! Go! Go!

1615
01:56:45,125 --> 01:56:46,583
Oh, fuck!

1616
01:56:49,541 --> 01:56:51,291
Put some fire on that vehicle!

1617
01:56:51,375 --> 01:56:53,625
We got one of ours inside,
another hangin' off!

1618
01:56:53,708 --> 01:56:57,000
<i>Got a stolen cruiser coming
your way. Take that son of a bitch out.</i>

1619
01:56:59,625 --> 01:57:01,916
<i>Negative, do not take that shot.</i>

1620
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:05,666
<i>We've got two officers onboard.</i>

1621
01:57:09,208 --> 01:57:10,958
There's glass everywhere.

1622
01:57:18,583 --> 01:57:21,666
<i>He's clear, take out the tires.
Driver's side only.</i>

1623
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:23,416
McBride, you good?

1624
01:57:31,583 --> 01:57:34,166
On the road! Move! Move!

1625
01:57:35,166 --> 01:57:36,083
Hop in!

1626
01:57:36,166 --> 01:57:39,375
I'll package up Ross for the paramedics.
Be right behind you.

1627
01:57:39,458 --> 01:57:42,625
Call it in wide. We need to be
on record before they are.

1628
01:57:58,333 --> 01:58:01,791
The file. You got the chief
shooting me on camera.

1629
01:58:01,875 --> 01:58:04,166
But the recording needs to survive.

1630
01:58:04,250 --> 01:58:07,250
If you've gotta bail,
the DVR's in the trunk.

1631
01:58:07,958 --> 01:58:09,375
He's not gonna bail.

1632
01:58:09,875 --> 01:58:12,958
<i>- They are northbound on 13.</i>
- Oh, they're on us.

1633
01:58:13,458 --> 01:58:17,458
<i>This is 103 confirming we still
have an officer on board that cruiser?</i>

1634
01:58:18,666 --> 01:58:21,291
<i>Negative.
We got three armed suspects.</i>

1635
01:58:21,375 --> 01:58:22,833
How're we on speed?

1636
01:58:23,333 --> 01:58:24,916
<i>Comin' up on your left.</i>

1637
01:58:25,583 --> 01:58:27,416
<i>Copy that, we'll box 'em in.</i>

1638
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:28,958
Maxed out.

1639
01:58:34,791 --> 01:58:39,041
<i>- All right, who's got the ARs?
- I got one. 103 has one onboard.</i>

1640
01:58:39,125 --> 01:58:41,833
<i>105, 105,
stand by for a PIT maneuver.</i>

1641
01:58:41,916 --> 01:58:43,458
<i>Are you up for it, Sims?</i>

1642
01:58:44,041 --> 01:58:45,458
I got you, Chief.

1643
01:58:46,041 --> 01:58:48,333
<i>105, let me give you some room.</i>

1644
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:53,000
- I can pull over.
<i>- 105, we got your back.</i>

1645
01:58:53,083 --> 01:58:54,416
<i>We are standing by.</i>

1646
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:55,875
You guys make the call.

1647
01:59:01,583 --> 01:59:04,625
Fuck 'em. Don't save 'em the trouble.

1648
01:59:04,708 --> 01:59:05,791
<i>Execute!</i>

1649
01:59:05,875 --> 01:59:08,791
Roger, Chief.
102, 104. Hang back.

1650
01:59:14,958 --> 01:59:16,000
<i>Take 'em out.</i>

1651
01:59:26,166 --> 01:59:29,250
<i>105, looks like you overshot!</i>

1652
01:59:29,333 --> 01:59:31,166
<i>We got a ticking clock here.</i>

1653
01:59:31,250 --> 01:59:33,166
<i>Give it another go, or I'll do it my...</i>

1654
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,125
<i>Check in, 105. What's your status?</i>

1655
01:59:43,208 --> 01:59:46,166
<i>Gonna need a wrecker.
Otherwise, code four.</i>

1656
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:47,708
<i>You got the chief?</i>

1657
01:59:47,791 --> 01:59:50,000
<i>Affirmative.
State Police are standing by.</i>

1658
01:59:51,166 --> 01:59:54,000
<i>102, we got a straight shot.
We're 10-59.</i>

1659
01:59:54,083 --> 01:59:55,500
What's a 10-59?

1660
01:59:58,375 --> 01:59:59,833
That's an escort.

1661
02:00:10,708 --> 02:00:13,166
<i>10-4. Give Samaritan
a heads-up on their inbound.</i>

1662
02:00:16,083 --> 02:00:17,541
<i>Affirmative, 102.</i>

1663
02:00:17,625 --> 02:00:20,291
<i>Officer onboard.
State police are two minutes out.</i>

1664
02:00:52,583 --> 02:00:56,083
Medical's on the way, Chief,
but I need to see your hands.

1665
02:00:58,916 --> 02:01:00,916
All right, we got two incoming.

1666
02:01:19,791 --> 02:01:20,791
