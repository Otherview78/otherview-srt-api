1
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:55,111
Show off.

2
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:21,610
Elder Luna says make your heart still.

3
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:23,982
The right egg will sing to you.

4
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:28,451
Elder Luna is elder.

5
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:52,442
Three.

6
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:56,273
Only three.

7
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,554
We take them all.

8
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:00,151
No. Never.

9
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:03,526
Leave one always.

10
00:04:05,396 --> 00:04:06,764
That is the law.

11
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,417
Bonding day is tomorrow.

12
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,840
These are yours.

13
00:04:17,802 --> 00:04:18,897
You are older.

14
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:22,317
- By length of a sunset.
- Is older.

15
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,696
Soona.

16
00:04:28,155 --> 00:04:30,390
Which one sings to you?

17
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:37,140
This one.

18
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,164
Silk.

19
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:59,718
We will raise them together.

20
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:03,047
Like we were raised.

21
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,924
It will be the same.

22
00:05:08,702 --> 00:05:10,618
Yes?

23
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:25,989
Go, go, go.

24
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:29,637
- Noa!
- Noa, wait!

25
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,868
Whoa!

26
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,969
It's too far.

27
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:48,566
Find another way.

28
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:54,358
Noa?

29
00:05:55,545 --> 00:05:57,049
No!

30
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,067
Yeah!

31
00:06:55,568 --> 00:06:57,026
Noa!

32
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,724
Anaya! Soona!

33
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:03,458
Noa!

34
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,067
- Noa!
- No!

35
00:07:35,658 --> 00:07:37,757
Do you wonder
what your bird will look like?

36
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:40,539
Long as it does not look like you,
Anaya.

37
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,232
Scared.

38
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:05,031
Blanket missing.

39
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:12,374
What is it, Noa?

40
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:15,248
Something in trees.

41
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:34,632
It's getting away.

42
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:50,140
Outsiders.

43
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,831
Noa scared.

44
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,301
Not Anaya.

45
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:25,671
Not ape.

46
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:31,645
Maybe…

47
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:34,291
Echo?

48
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:41,679
Echo do not come in from Valley.

49
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:43,139
Oh.

50
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:05,305
Were you scared?

51
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:07,631
Not as scared as Anaya!

52
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:39,514
They're back! They're back!

53
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:40,654
Soona!

54
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:41,976
Did you get your eggs?

55
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,758
- How far did you climb?
- Was it dangerous?

56
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,267
Very dangerous.

57
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,140
Anaya wailed like a newborn.

58
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,044
How many eggs did you honor?

59
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:03,687
- Show us the egg.
- Did you climb well?

60
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:05,693
- Show us the egg.
- Show us your egg.

61
00:11:05,784 --> 00:11:06,879
Egg. Egg. Egg.

62
00:11:06,971 --> 00:11:10,893
Show us, Anaya, please?

63
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:37,803
- Who want?
- Me, me, me!

64
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:40,859
Aw!

65
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:44,827
Come on. Come on. Give, give! Hey!

66
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,560
Son.

67
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:56,913
Show me.

68
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,422
All must wait for bonding.

69
00:11:59,558 --> 00:12:02,432
Even Honored Teacher.

70
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:04,576
I am your mother.

71
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:17,940
I knew you would climb well.

72
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:22,090
He waits.

73
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:33,630
Broken?

74
00:12:36,184 --> 00:12:38,602
Time for that later.

75
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:45,489
Your father will want to see.

76
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:56,435
He will be proud.

77
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,819
- Noa.
- Noa.

78
00:13:16,002 --> 00:13:19,148
Noa, didn't think you'd make it back.

79
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,731
Too firm.

80
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:59,469
Yes. Yes, Koro.

81
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,944
Father. Master of Birds.

82
00:14:30,438 --> 00:14:31,533
Noa.

83
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:35,911
Son.

84
00:14:41,384 --> 00:14:47,770
Sun Eagle does not like work
for tomorrow's ceremony.

85
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:52,012
You climb well?

86
00:14:52,695 --> 00:14:54,748
Above Top Nest.

87
00:14:54,884 --> 00:14:57,165
Huh. All of you?

88
00:14:57,302 --> 00:14:59,035
No.

89
00:14:59,172 --> 00:15:00,677
Only me.

90
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:09,251
What that smell?

91
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:24,257
You did not go to the Valley Beyond?

92
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,854
Never.

93
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,316
Is forbidden.

94
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:33,790
Yet blood of Echo on your blanket.

95
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:37,439
We did not go to Valley Beyond.

96
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:43,551
I accept.

97
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:47,245
You are true, Noa.

98
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:50,848
Much to learn.

99
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,087
Much to teach.

100
00:15:55,774 --> 00:15:58,191
After tomorrow's bonding.

101
00:15:59,651 --> 00:16:02,342
Now, Elders must know.

102
00:16:03,437 --> 00:16:06,948
Echoes only bring trouble.

103
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,520
Oda will chase the pests away.

104
00:16:23,323 --> 00:16:26,013
May I seek your counsel?

105
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:34,132
This blanket had the blood
of an Echo on it.

106
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,455
Echo.

107
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:37,142
And I apologize for that.

108
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,746
This is a bad sign for all of us.

109
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:41,977
That smell.

110
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:43,300
And my suggestion would be…

111
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:53,881
You climbed Top Nest?

112
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:00,130
Hard climb.

113
00:17:07,063 --> 00:17:08,204
Ah, yes.

114
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,620
Could be dangerous.

115
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:11,898
Danger.

116
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:18,329
Anaya!

117
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:25,899
You see your father?

118
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:37,074
I do not understand Eagle Sun.

119
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:40,176
I do. He hate Noa.

120
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:47,382
Noa.

121
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,206
Your blanket?

122
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:51,715
With Elders.

123
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:57,005
They send Oda to scare Echo away.

124
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,013
Yes, Elder.

125
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:03,254
When mother was small…

126
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,676
dry season shrank creek.

127
00:18:06,812 --> 00:18:08,409
Echo range for food.

128
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:13,198
She saw a small and a big.

129
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:17,394
We have good rain.

130
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,450
Her words.

131
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,750
Ride true, Oda.

132
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:17,600
No.

133
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:28,135
Our bonding is at sunrise.

134
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:31,282
Master of Birds will make exception.

135
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:34,749
They will not make him wait
for next season.

136
00:21:34,886 --> 00:21:36,300
Yes, he will.

137
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,588
He is your father.

138
00:21:40,724 --> 00:21:45,103
And I am his son.

139
00:21:46,425 --> 00:21:49,025
Then I will wait with you.

140
00:21:52,035 --> 00:21:53,723
Anaya wait too.

141
00:21:55,913 --> 00:21:57,189
You cannot.

142
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:07,223
I must find another.

143
00:24:06,722 --> 00:24:07,817
Noa.

144
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:09,777
Oda!

145
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,788
There are…

146
00:24:14,385 --> 00:24:15,753
more.

147
00:25:04,327 --> 00:25:06,426
What happened here?

148
00:25:06,562 --> 00:25:08,296
Our scouts.

149
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:11,214
Killed by him.

150
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:21,523
Human.

151
00:25:22,572 --> 00:25:24,169
It is her.

152
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:25,947
Lightning, back on your horse.

153
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,452
Spread out!

154
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:29,961
Find his clan.

155
00:25:30,143 --> 00:25:31,785
Search in all directions!

156
00:25:40,496 --> 00:25:42,366
The ape's horse!

157
00:25:42,503 --> 00:25:43,963
Lightning, come!

158
00:25:53,997 --> 00:25:57,008
They cannot be far.

159
00:25:57,145 --> 00:26:00,246
Follow the horse! Find his clan!

160
00:26:02,253 --> 00:26:03,803
Find human!

161
00:26:04,807 --> 00:26:06,038
Ride!

162
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:12,970
Go, go, go!

163
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:21,660
Round them up!

164
00:27:21,796 --> 00:27:23,576
No! No! Please!

165
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,322
You, prisoner!

166
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:35,434
Burn it down.

167
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,044
Soona! Anaya!

168
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:42,412
Noa, help!

169
00:27:54,043 --> 00:27:55,138
Noa!

170
00:27:56,278 --> 00:27:57,737
Noa!

171
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,151
Noa!

172
00:27:59,926 --> 00:28:01,021
Noa!

173
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:03,712
Noa!

174
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:07,270
Anaya! Mother!

175
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:10,463
Where Soona?

176
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:12,698
They took her.

177
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:14,932
They broke my egg.

178
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,396
Mother.

179
00:28:17,578 --> 00:28:18,855
Help your father!

180
00:28:19,037 --> 00:28:21,546
No! No!

181
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,054
Noa!

182
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:26,746
No!

183
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:30,988
Run, Noa! Run!

184
00:28:32,402 --> 00:28:34,226
Help your father!

185
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:36,369
Go, Noa! Run!

186
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:40,247
No!

187
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,632
He their Elder.

188
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:55,480
No!

189
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,430
For Caesar!

190
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:09,391
For Caesar!

191
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:14,500
Take them to Proximus!

192
00:29:16,095 --> 00:29:17,965
Find the human!

193
00:29:18,148 --> 00:29:21,068
Caesar! Caesar!

194
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,716
Caesar! Caesar!

195
00:29:37,168 --> 00:29:38,992
- Father.
- Son.

196
00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:40,862
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

197
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:43,142
Noa, free all birds.

198
00:29:43,553 --> 00:29:44,648
Go.

199
00:30:24,146 --> 00:30:27,567
Bend your head.

200
00:32:19,768 --> 00:32:21,182
Noa.

201
00:32:27,932 --> 00:32:29,528
For Caesar.

202
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:46,382
Father…

203
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:51,672
I will find them.

204
00:35:53,498 --> 00:35:56,872
I will bring them home.

205
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,897
Mother.

206
00:39:21,434 --> 00:39:22,529
Sun.

207
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,202
Come, Sun.

208
00:41:52,905 --> 00:41:55,277
How young you are.

209
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:59,565
Without your mask.

210
00:42:00,796 --> 00:42:02,392
Without this.

211
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:06,133
Speak up.

212
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:11,012
Speak up.

213
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,338
Not mine.

214
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:15,985
No mask.

215
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:18,675
I am not…

216
00:42:19,952 --> 00:42:21,093
them.

217
00:42:24,285 --> 00:42:25,927
Explain yourself.

218
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:29,804
They killed my father.

219
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:33,134
Stole my village.

220
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,420
I follow their tracks.

221
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:53,886
He was my village.

222
00:42:57,443 --> 00:42:59,588
They killed him.

223
00:43:01,229 --> 00:43:02,643
The Masks.

224
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:17,786
I am Raka.

225
00:43:21,389 --> 00:43:23,442
I am Noa.

226
00:43:36,212 --> 00:43:41,504
Apes falling from the sky. Hmm.

227
00:43:45,198 --> 00:43:50,398
He was outside when they arrived.

228
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,587
Did you see my clan?

229
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,004
No.

230
00:43:56,007 --> 00:43:57,512
I hid.

231
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:00,340
I survived.

232
00:44:01,937 --> 00:44:05,357
I protected our work.

233
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:21,777
They are an ancient way to store ideas.

234
00:44:27,387 --> 00:44:30,215
The symbols have meaning.

235
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:38,106
Apes understood this meaning…

236
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:40,477
in the time of Caesar.

237
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:47,045
The Masks, in my village…

238
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:50,876
said that name…

239
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,616
"Caesar."

240
00:44:55,802 --> 00:44:57,308
Shameful.

241
00:44:58,493 --> 00:45:00,911
The Masks take his name.

242
00:45:02,598 --> 00:45:04,103
Twist his words.

243
00:45:05,061 --> 00:45:06,931
Who is he?

244
00:45:07,798 --> 00:45:09,029
Not "is."

245
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:11,401
"Was."

246
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:20,888
Your clan does not know the true Caesar.

247
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,537
Too many have forgotten who he was.

248
00:45:26,908 --> 00:45:29,964
I know Elders of my village.

249
00:45:30,101 --> 00:45:32,017
They made the law.

250
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,483
That is everything.

251
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,767
That is not everything.

252
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:41,959
Long before your Elders…

253
00:45:42,096 --> 00:45:46,794
it was Caesar who taught us
what it means to be ape.

254
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:51,857
He was our leader, our lawgiver.

255
00:45:51,994 --> 00:45:55,049
Apes together strong.

256
00:45:55,187 --> 00:45:58,197
Ape shall not kill ape.

257
00:45:58,333 --> 00:46:01,390
We, the Order of Caesar…

258
00:46:01,572 --> 00:46:03,488
follow his words.

259
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:05,220
To this day…

260
00:46:06,726 --> 00:46:08,323
I follow.

261
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:11,607
I am now…

262
00:46:13,066 --> 00:46:14,571
the last.

263
00:46:16,897 --> 00:46:18,950
The work continues.

264
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:25,655
What is this place?

265
00:46:25,837 --> 00:46:28,983
We believe apes built this…

266
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:33,043
as a refuge for humans.

267
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,278
Now it is rare to see even one.

268
00:46:35,414 --> 00:46:41,207
But in Caesar's time,
there were vast herds of them.

269
00:46:42,438 --> 00:46:45,266
Can you imagine?

270
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:50,420
Perhaps here,
humans were cared for, fed…

271
00:46:50,603 --> 00:46:54,708
maybe even taught.

272
00:47:01,823 --> 00:47:03,009
What is it?

273
00:47:05,062 --> 00:47:06,339
Echo.

274
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,222
Human.

275
00:47:15,278 --> 00:47:16,966
You have seen one?

276
00:47:17,878 --> 00:47:18,973
One.

277
00:47:20,979 --> 00:47:23,396
They are scavengers.

278
00:47:23,534 --> 00:47:25,495
Like boars.

279
00:47:25,631 --> 00:47:27,411
Only lesser.

280
00:47:27,547 --> 00:47:31,561
Humans are slow-witted, but…

281
00:47:33,294 --> 00:47:35,803
there was a time…

282
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:40,227
when humans and apes lived side by side.

283
00:47:44,514 --> 00:47:50,262
Yes, it is a puzzle. I know. But…

284
00:47:51,766 --> 00:47:54,777
they were important to Caesar. Hmm.

285
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:59,475
So they are important to me.

286
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,726
I have to get to my horse.

287
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:09,827
Of course.

288
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,241
Follow me.

289
00:48:15,301 --> 00:48:18,220
You do not know Caesar.

290
00:48:19,862 --> 00:48:22,462
You do not know books.

291
00:48:26,932 --> 00:48:29,075
You should stay here.

292
00:48:29,213 --> 00:48:31,903
There is much I could teach you.

293
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:41,755
Go away!

294
00:48:41,937 --> 00:48:44,538
- No! Come back!
- Pest!

295
00:48:44,674 --> 00:48:47,000
Wait! Come back!

296
00:48:48,003 --> 00:48:51,150
There is no danger.

297
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,526
That is the one.

298
00:48:54,708 --> 00:48:57,308
Stole from my village.

299
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:02,553
She follows you from your village?

300
00:49:06,612 --> 00:49:11,858
Perhaps Caesar bids me travel.

301
00:49:16,281 --> 00:49:19,247
Wait here. The work continues.

302
00:49:19,384 --> 00:49:20,706
I have no time for…

303
00:49:20,843 --> 00:49:24,263
I will not slow you down.
I, too, keep a horse.

304
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:35,210
Can we not slow down?

305
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:36,533
No.

306
00:49:39,999 --> 00:49:42,189
I am sure she follows.

307
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:44,149
I do not know why.

308
00:49:48,893 --> 00:49:52,998
A beautiful bird!

309
00:49:55,461 --> 00:49:57,103
Eagle Sun.

310
00:49:58,289 --> 00:49:59,886
My father's bird.

311
00:50:01,162 --> 00:50:03,214
He follows to taunt me.

312
00:50:04,628 --> 00:50:08,780
This bird follows you too?

313
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:13,614
We raise eagles, my clan.

314
00:50:14,435 --> 00:50:15,575
Sing to them…

315
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:18,266
so they know us.

316
00:50:18,403 --> 00:50:19,634
A bond.

317
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,466
Sing the song.

318
00:50:24,515 --> 00:50:25,838
Please.

319
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:30,581
No.

320
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:34,959
My father was Master of Birds.

321
00:50:35,096 --> 00:50:36,738
He sang to eagles.

322
00:50:39,155 --> 00:50:41,300
But I am not him.

323
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:44,583
Shame.

324
00:50:46,134 --> 00:50:49,372
I would have enjoyed a song.

325
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,278
Strange weapons.

326
00:51:16,784 --> 00:51:17,879
Broken.

327
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,458
Raka.

328
00:51:59,566 --> 00:52:00,661
Noa.

329
00:52:07,594 --> 00:52:10,832
She follows because she is hungry.

330
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:22,052
No, no, no.

331
00:52:24,287 --> 00:52:26,066
This is…

332
00:52:28,164 --> 00:52:29,806
important.

333
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:33,865
They get cold.

334
00:52:37,332 --> 00:52:39,110
Show mercy.

335
00:53:03,192 --> 00:53:05,747
She is smarter than most.

336
00:53:12,132 --> 00:53:15,462
We will name her Nova.

337
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:21,984
We name them all Nova.

338
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:26,316
I do not know why.
It is from Caesar's time.

339
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:32,201
Why did Caesar care so much for Echoes?

340
00:53:32,383 --> 00:53:37,491
Legend says he was reared by them…

341
00:53:39,179 --> 00:53:41,870
impossible as that may seem.

342
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:45,883
Caesar legend is important.

343
00:53:48,073 --> 00:53:50,718
He was first Elder.

344
00:53:52,451 --> 00:53:55,553
He led with decency…

345
00:53:57,103 --> 00:53:58,517
morality…

346
00:54:00,479 --> 00:54:01,939
strength…

347
00:54:05,404 --> 00:54:06,864
compassion.

348
00:54:12,201 --> 00:54:15,667
Caesar never had to share camp…

349
00:54:16,351 --> 00:54:19,453
with this Nova.

350
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,915
The smell is potent.

351
00:57:45,474 --> 00:57:50,582
A tunnel that eats light?

352
00:57:51,996 --> 00:57:54,048
She saw what I saw.

353
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,013
It was in her eyes.

354
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,473
She…

355
00:57:59,658 --> 00:58:01,026
reacted.

356
00:58:02,304 --> 00:58:03,398
How?

357
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:09,191
As ape would.

358
00:58:17,721 --> 00:58:20,366
- If Echo comes, she must ride.
- Hmm.

359
00:58:20,503 --> 00:58:24,927
Is my young companion showing compassion
for our fellow traveler?

360
00:58:26,022 --> 00:58:27,344
She is slow.

361
00:58:46,728 --> 00:58:48,735
Horse.

362
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:02,418
Then, of course, there is the gibbon.

363
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:05,474
Very, very long arms.

364
00:59:05,611 --> 00:59:13,273
Is most unfortunate that the human can
only use its feet for walking.

365
00:59:13,411 --> 00:59:16,147
Imagine if you were falling from a tree.

366
00:59:16,284 --> 00:59:19,111
You only have two appendages
to save your life.

367
00:59:19,248 --> 00:59:22,897
But if you were able to use
both of your hands…

368
00:59:23,034 --> 00:59:25,223
and both of your feet…

369
00:59:25,406 --> 00:59:27,959
that's four times the safety.

370
00:59:28,142 --> 00:59:33,433
And I imagine that,
if I came across a special…

371
00:59:35,485 --> 00:59:38,176
What is that?

372
01:00:06,911 --> 01:00:09,875
Horses with stripes.

373
01:00:12,339 --> 01:00:14,573
Quite striking.

374
01:01:07,527 --> 01:01:12,133
We feared the herds ceased to exist.

375
01:01:38,085 --> 01:01:40,594
Will you not say goodbye?

376
01:01:43,149 --> 01:01:46,523
I must find my clan.

377
01:01:48,439 --> 01:01:51,358
The Nova stays with her kind.

378
01:01:52,681 --> 01:01:54,460
You raise them up.

379
01:01:56,102 --> 01:02:00,207
Follow Caesar's word.

380
01:02:11,107 --> 01:02:12,704
To remember…

381
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:16,171
who he was.

382
01:02:20,412 --> 01:02:22,602
It is important.

383
01:02:55,623 --> 01:02:57,219
They are like you.

384
01:02:59,089 --> 01:03:01,233
Would you like to join them?

385
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:23,719
He has his journey.

386
01:03:24,951 --> 01:03:26,957
We have ours.

387
01:03:27,687 --> 01:03:28,781
Come.

388
01:04:21,735 --> 01:04:22,830
Nova!

389
01:04:23,879 --> 01:04:25,339
Nova!

390
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:55,806
Take them!

391
01:05:02,557 --> 01:05:04,198
Ride them down!

392
01:05:04,335 --> 01:05:06,387
Catch that one!

393
01:05:52,226 --> 01:05:54,552
This one? Hyah!

394
01:06:02,078 --> 01:06:03,172
There!

395
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:28,714
Spread out.

396
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:29,946
Lightning.

397
01:06:43,993 --> 01:06:45,088
This way.

398
01:06:46,183 --> 01:06:47,277
Find her!

399
01:06:56,308 --> 01:06:59,272
I know she here!

400
01:07:03,514 --> 01:07:04,928
Raka!

401
01:07:07,027 --> 01:07:08,212
Nova!

402
01:07:10,219 --> 01:07:11,633
Come out!

403
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,640
I smell you!

404
01:07:16,102 --> 01:07:17,471
Raka!

405
01:07:24,632 --> 01:07:25,727
Noa!

406
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:53,914
Hyah!

407
01:08:21,234 --> 01:08:22,739
Noa!

408
01:08:31,405 --> 01:08:33,093
Raka!

409
01:08:35,009 --> 01:08:36,969
Caesar will forgive.

410
01:08:37,927 --> 01:08:39,661
Shall we continue?

411
01:09:01,873 --> 01:09:05,567
This should give us time.

412
01:09:47,027 --> 01:09:49,672
What did I miss?

413
01:09:49,809 --> 01:09:51,405
She spoke.

414
01:09:54,552 --> 01:09:57,152
She called my name.

415
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:59,935
You misheard.

416
01:10:00,072 --> 01:10:05,225
You said this Nova
was smarter than most.

417
01:10:05,362 --> 01:10:06,913
Within reason.

418
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:10,699
Some intelligence, to be sure, but…

419
01:10:10,881 --> 01:10:12,523
I have a name.

420
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:15,761
Mae.

421
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:23,059
I know where they're taking your clan.

422
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:34,964
It's a human settlement.

423
01:10:36,788 --> 01:10:39,159
It's where I'm headed to.

424
01:10:39,296 --> 01:10:41,166
Looking for more like me.

425
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:42,853
There are more…

426
01:10:43,902 --> 01:10:45,043
like you?

427
01:10:47,734 --> 01:10:49,741
There used to be more.

428
01:10:50,653 --> 01:10:54,028
You hid the truth?

429
01:10:54,165 --> 01:10:56,582
My mother taught me silence…

430
01:10:58,224 --> 01:11:00,004
for my safety.

431
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:04,610
You were safe with us.

432
01:11:04,746 --> 01:11:07,711
And still not true.

433
01:11:09,079 --> 01:11:11,816
Where is your mother now?

434
01:11:15,419 --> 01:11:17,517
I am alone.

435
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:21,029
Huh.

436
01:11:22,261 --> 01:11:24,679
As are we all.

437
01:11:26,047 --> 01:11:27,369
But now…

438
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,702
we have each other.

439
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:45,021
Ah.

440
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:49,399
Let us have a fire.

441
01:11:49,581 --> 01:11:52,181
We have much to discuss.

442
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,414
Go back.

443
01:15:41,281 --> 01:15:42,513
Go back!

444
01:15:49,719 --> 01:15:50,814
Noa!

445
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:55,831
Mae!

446
01:16:01,851 --> 01:16:02,992
Mae!

447
01:16:03,128 --> 01:16:04,269
No!

448
01:16:20,643 --> 01:16:21,828
Mae!

449
01:16:26,845 --> 01:16:27,940
Hold on!

450
01:16:28,579 --> 01:16:30,403
Mae!

451
01:16:47,005 --> 01:16:48,692
No! Raka!

452
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:49,925
Raka!

453
01:17:05,431 --> 01:17:06,801
Together…

454
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,400
strong.

455
01:19:18,249 --> 01:19:20,484
Stand back! Human!

456
01:19:45,432 --> 01:19:46,755
No! No! No!

457
01:20:02,354 --> 01:20:05,228
Welcome home, baby bird.

458
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:17,906
Go!

459
01:21:16,059 --> 01:21:17,975
Noa?

460
01:21:18,112 --> 01:21:21,032
Noa!

461
01:21:21,214 --> 01:21:24,406
I missed you. Soona. Soona.

462
01:21:28,146 --> 01:21:29,241
No.

463
01:21:32,342 --> 01:21:34,487
You were dead.

464
01:21:35,945 --> 01:21:38,500
I… I saw you fall.

465
01:21:38,683 --> 01:21:41,510
You are not hurt?

466
01:21:42,879 --> 01:21:43,973
No.

467
01:21:44,748 --> 01:21:45,843
No.

468
01:21:51,864 --> 01:21:53,688
Mother?

469
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:54,920
Anaya?

470
01:22:51,339 --> 01:22:52,616
Vonnegut.

471
01:22:53,848 --> 01:22:55,398
That's a good one.

472
01:22:56,447 --> 01:22:58,956
Not a lot of fiction there.

473
01:22:59,138 --> 01:23:02,514
He's mostly interested in history.

474
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:07,805
Roman history, especially.

475
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:14,509
The name's Trevathan.

476
01:23:18,478 --> 01:23:20,348
Where, uh…

477
01:23:20,485 --> 01:23:21,943
Where are you from?

478
01:23:25,273 --> 01:23:26,641
You first.

479
01:23:28,876 --> 01:23:32,982
Well, doesn't really matter, does it?

480
01:23:33,118 --> 01:23:34,440
I left.

481
01:23:36,174 --> 01:23:37,862
Same as you.

482
01:23:37,999 --> 01:23:40,872
Made it almost to the coast

483
01:23:41,008 --> 01:23:44,430
and then I fell and shattered my ankles.

484
01:23:44,567 --> 01:23:46,619
That's where Proximus found me.

485
01:23:48,626 --> 01:23:53,369
And now you read him Roman history.

486
01:23:56,790 --> 01:23:59,071
So, who are you?

487
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:03,859
I'm the human not helping the apes.

488
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:23,062
Noa.

489
01:24:25,569 --> 01:24:27,805
Share. Must share.

490
01:24:27,987 --> 01:24:29,082
Good.

491
01:24:33,506 --> 01:24:34,920
Noa?

492
01:24:35,103 --> 01:24:36,516
- Noa!
- You're alive!

493
01:24:55,764 --> 01:24:57,133
Father…

494
01:24:57,999 --> 01:24:59,184
he's…

495
01:24:59,367 --> 01:25:01,831
I know.

496
01:25:20,850 --> 01:25:22,810
We must go.

497
01:25:24,544 --> 01:25:25,821
Come.

498
01:25:36,767 --> 01:25:38,364
Caesar!

499
01:25:46,117 --> 01:25:52,366
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

500
01:26:41,761 --> 01:26:44,316
What a wonderful day!

501
01:26:44,453 --> 01:26:47,646
What a wonderful day!

502
01:26:47,783 --> 01:26:52,024
Are we thankful for the words of Caesar?

503
01:26:52,161 --> 01:26:54,260
We are thankful.

504
01:26:54,396 --> 01:26:56,722
Do we bend our heads?

505
01:26:56,859 --> 01:26:58,866
We bend!

506
01:26:59,504 --> 01:27:01,511
Say his words!

507
01:27:01,648 --> 01:27:03,929
Apes together strong!

508
01:27:04,066 --> 01:27:05,936
Say his words!

509
01:27:06,072 --> 01:27:08,672
Apes together strong!

510
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:11,728
What a wonderful day!

511
01:27:22,173 --> 01:27:24,316
That felt good.

512
01:27:24,453 --> 01:27:27,692
When I think on those words…

513
01:27:27,828 --> 01:27:30,976
I feel good.

514
01:27:33,712 --> 01:27:37,224
Caesar was first Elder.

515
01:27:37,361 --> 01:27:41,739
Now I am Caesar.

516
01:27:45,206 --> 01:27:47,486
He is not Caesar.

517
01:27:48,307 --> 01:27:51,455
Careful, son. We are his now.

518
01:27:56,380 --> 01:28:02,720
Now, when I think of all the treasures
left inside for us…

519
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:04,681
Oh…

520
01:28:04,818 --> 01:28:08,057
I feel very good.

521
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:13,530
It may be difficult to open.

522
01:28:14,761 --> 01:28:16,449
But not impossible…

523
01:28:16,585 --> 01:28:19,733
because we work together.

524
01:28:20,873 --> 01:28:23,519
All as one.

525
01:28:23,701 --> 01:28:25,799
As Caesar wanted.

526
01:28:25,935 --> 01:28:29,219
As Caesar required.

527
01:28:29,356 --> 01:28:32,276
Apes together strong!

528
01:28:33,234 --> 01:28:34,328
Pull!

529
01:28:46,004 --> 01:28:48,011
Pull!

530
01:28:49,196 --> 01:28:51,295
Pull! More!

531
01:28:58,182 --> 01:28:59,367
Watch this.

532
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:15,650
- Pull!
- Pull!

533
01:29:15,787 --> 01:29:18,022
Pull!

534
01:29:23,450 --> 01:29:25,000
Yes!

535
01:29:25,594 --> 01:29:26,962
Yes!

536
01:29:33,074 --> 01:29:35,081
More!

537
01:29:47,578 --> 01:29:48,992
Enough!

538
01:29:55,104 --> 01:29:59,482
Maybe stronger tomorrow.

539
01:30:20,827 --> 01:30:22,424
Don't worry.

540
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,115
Whoever's in there
is either dead or gone.

541
01:30:26,939 --> 01:30:30,132
We've been bangin'
on that door for months.

542
01:30:33,507 --> 01:30:36,016
Do you not know where we are?

543
01:30:36,152 --> 01:30:39,801
When things got bad
and the government went underground,

544
01:30:39,984 --> 01:30:42,037
this is where half of it went.

545
01:30:42,173 --> 01:30:45,640
With all their technology,
and all their weapons…

546
01:30:48,331 --> 01:30:50,611
Don't you understand?

547
01:30:50,748 --> 01:30:53,302
That ape cannot have
what is inside the…

548
01:30:53,439 --> 01:30:56,860
You gotta stop thinking
about the way things were

549
01:30:56,996 --> 01:30:59,505
and start thinking
about the way they are.

550
01:31:00,234 --> 01:31:01,877
This is a good life,

551
01:31:02,014 --> 01:31:05,069
and you have a chance
to be a part of it.

552
01:31:05,207 --> 01:31:07,897
What, and build a world for the apes?

553
01:31:08,035 --> 01:31:11,044
It is already their world.

554
01:31:19,938 --> 01:31:23,177
There's hot water and fresh clothes
in that room back there.

555
01:31:24,910 --> 01:31:27,920
You'll feel better
when you get yourself cleaned up.

556
01:31:29,653 --> 01:31:32,344
You better figure out
how to be useful around here.

557
01:31:40,007 --> 01:31:41,330
Honored Elder…

558
01:31:42,561 --> 01:31:43,656
had to bend.

559
01:31:45,753 --> 01:31:48,171
We had no choice.

560
01:31:50,224 --> 01:31:51,865
You must accept.

561
01:31:55,515 --> 01:31:56,792
It is law.

562
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:04,818
The Elders did not tell us everything

563
01:32:04,955 --> 01:32:08,012
about this world.

564
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:12,162
They did not tell us
because they did not know.

565
01:32:13,576 --> 01:32:17,042
They did not want to know.

566
01:32:24,112 --> 01:32:26,575
You are different.

567
01:32:30,087 --> 01:32:31,364
Come.

568
01:32:47,921 --> 01:32:50,474
And that's why
they call it a toga party.

569
01:32:54,123 --> 01:32:58,456
You are a funny little human, Trevathan.

570
01:33:04,431 --> 01:33:05,708
Hey, come.

571
01:33:06,438 --> 01:33:07,578
Come, sit.

572
01:33:09,631 --> 01:33:11,272
Please.

573
01:33:13,417 --> 01:33:14,512
Go.

574
01:33:15,287 --> 01:33:16,382
Go.

575
01:33:28,148 --> 01:33:30,657
Wonderful day, yes?

576
01:33:34,671 --> 01:33:37,863
You two have come a long way.

577
01:33:40,053 --> 01:33:42,607
An ape and a human

578
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:44,523
traveling together is…

579
01:33:46,301 --> 01:33:48,400
quite an adventure.

580
01:33:50,862 --> 01:33:52,459
You are Noa, yes?

581
01:33:53,234 --> 01:33:55,560
Welcome, Noa.

582
01:34:12,026 --> 01:34:13,120
Go.

583
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:22,972
Mae…

584
01:34:23,109 --> 01:34:27,122
you are familiar with the concept of…

585
01:34:27,807 --> 01:34:29,768
evolution?

586
01:34:29,904 --> 01:34:32,778
That is the human label, yeah?

587
01:34:32,915 --> 01:34:37,795
The advancement
that I crave requires time.

588
01:34:37,932 --> 01:34:42,174
Vast amounts of time that I do not have.

589
01:34:43,634 --> 01:34:47,099
Unfortunately, I am but a mortal ape.

590
01:34:49,608 --> 01:34:55,127
So this is why I need
to get the knowledge inside that vault.

591
01:34:55,264 --> 01:34:56,724
I believe it will deliver

592
01:34:56,860 --> 01:35:00,418
instant evolution.

593
01:35:01,512 --> 01:35:03,884
Hmm. Noa.

594
01:35:05,071 --> 01:35:06,484
You don't understand.

595
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:09,677
In their time,

596
01:35:09,813 --> 01:35:15,971
humans were capable
of many great things, yes?

597
01:35:16,108 --> 01:35:18,571
They could level mountains.

598
01:35:20,577 --> 01:35:23,223
They could speak across oceans.

599
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:26,233
They could fly, Noa.

600
01:35:26,781 --> 01:35:28,834
Like eagles fly.

601
01:35:29,015 --> 01:35:32,437
But now, we will learn.

602
01:35:32,574 --> 01:35:36,450
Apes will learn. I will learn, yeah,

603
01:35:36,587 --> 01:35:40,099
from what is inside that vault.

604
01:35:40,236 --> 01:35:42,516
It's impossible.

605
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:46,210
No one's getting in there.

606
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:54,511
Mae, Mae, Mae, Mae.

607
01:35:56,336 --> 01:36:02,722
My apes encountered your companions.

608
01:36:03,999 --> 01:36:07,693
I believe this map belonged to you.

609
01:36:08,422 --> 01:36:10,475
You see, Noa,

610
01:36:10,612 --> 01:36:13,303
before she was traveling with you

611
01:36:13,486 --> 01:36:17,955
and that old orangutan,

612
01:36:18,093 --> 01:36:21,604
Mae was with other humans.

613
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:26,348
But sadly,

614
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:32,231
my apes did not realize their value,

615
01:36:32,414 --> 01:36:37,158
so I was brought only bodies.

616
01:36:37,339 --> 01:36:42,129
I could not speak to them
like I can speak to you.

617
01:36:44,272 --> 01:36:46,416
I know…

618
01:36:46,553 --> 01:36:50,338
you are coming here
to get inside my vault.

619
01:36:50,475 --> 01:36:52,163
It is not yours!

620
01:36:52,345 --> 01:36:54,033
Oh.

621
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:56,815
It is now, isn't it?

622
01:36:57,956 --> 01:37:01,331
And I will get inside.

623
01:37:01,513 --> 01:37:06,165
No matter how many apes it costs me.

624
01:37:07,169 --> 01:37:08,264
Noa.

625
01:37:08,765 --> 01:37:10,544
I…

626
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:16,154
I have heard that you are
a very clever ape, yeah?

627
01:37:17,202 --> 01:37:18,526
Very clever.

628
01:37:18,662 --> 01:37:22,904
He repaired one of your broken staffs,
Trevathan.

629
01:37:26,097 --> 01:37:30,247
I have much use for clever apes.

630
01:37:30,384 --> 01:37:33,212
Now, can you tell me…

631
01:37:35,219 --> 01:37:39,597
did Mae tell you
how to get inside my vault?

632
01:37:45,436 --> 01:37:47,032
She told me nothing.

633
01:37:48,035 --> 01:37:49,905
Told you nothing!

634
01:37:50,042 --> 01:37:51,136
Nothing.

635
01:37:55,287 --> 01:37:57,340
Told you nothing.

636
01:38:01,992 --> 01:38:03,133
Noa.

637
01:38:04,227 --> 01:38:06,417
Come. Come with me.

638
01:38:06,599 --> 01:38:07,831
Come, come.

639
01:38:09,518 --> 01:38:11,205
I have something to show you.

640
01:38:12,346 --> 01:38:14,489
Come. Come.

641
01:38:16,496 --> 01:38:17,727
Come, Noa.

642
01:38:19,552 --> 01:38:21,832
Tell me, what do you see?

643
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:34,695
Stolen clans.

644
01:38:37,613 --> 01:38:39,119
Not clans.

645
01:38:41,217 --> 01:38:42,357
A kingdom.

646
01:38:44,136 --> 01:38:48,196
Noa, a kingdom for apes.

647
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:57,500
Humans can never be trusted.

648
01:38:57,682 --> 01:39:01,012
Where there are two that can speak,

649
01:39:01,149 --> 01:39:02,790
there must be more.

650
01:39:05,162 --> 01:39:11,411
Mae has come here to claim
the tools inside my vault.

651
01:39:11,593 --> 01:39:15,060
Tools that make humans strong

652
01:39:15,197 --> 01:39:17,477
and make them dangerous.

653
01:39:20,305 --> 01:39:22,722
That is why I must have them first.

654
01:39:22,859 --> 01:39:24,181
Yeah?

655
01:39:24,319 --> 01:39:30,293
They do not understand
that this is our time.

656
01:39:30,430 --> 01:39:32,757
This is my kingdom.

657
01:39:36,405 --> 01:39:39,735
I must destroy their kind.

658
01:39:40,966 --> 01:39:44,752
Unless we want to live in cages again.

659
01:39:52,415 --> 01:39:53,783
Come.

660
01:39:53,919 --> 01:39:55,607
Come, Noa.

661
01:39:55,744 --> 01:39:57,203
Let us eat.

662
01:39:59,392 --> 01:40:00,533
Trevathan!

663
01:40:01,172 --> 01:40:03,178
Tell us a story.

664
01:40:03,361 --> 01:40:05,185
Make it a funny one.

665
01:40:30,362 --> 01:40:32,414
They will not come.

666
01:40:36,564 --> 01:40:37,659
Why?

667
01:40:39,758 --> 01:40:42,403
Because Eagle Clan…

668
01:40:44,501 --> 01:40:45,687
is gone.

669
01:40:49,336 --> 01:40:54,854
Eagle Clan is here.

670
01:40:55,949 --> 01:40:58,732
We are here.

671
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:03,611
In land of Proximus.

672
01:41:05,573 --> 01:41:10,956
And Proximus has no need for eagles.

673
01:41:48,630 --> 01:41:52,825
You come to judge me?

674
01:41:58,755 --> 01:42:00,761
I judge myself.

675
01:42:02,722 --> 01:42:06,919
I promised our father

676
01:42:07,056 --> 01:42:08,789
I would bring them home.

677
01:42:13,624 --> 01:42:14,992
I failed.

678
01:42:17,454 --> 01:42:20,192
Eagle Clan belongs

679
01:42:20,374 --> 01:42:24,753
to Proximus Caesar now.

680
01:42:28,766 --> 01:42:31,594
That is the law.

681
01:42:48,470 --> 01:42:53,624
But the law is wrong.

682
01:43:45,938 --> 01:43:48,949
Time for the evening lesson.

683
01:43:49,085 --> 01:43:52,278
It would be very good for you
to be there.

684
01:44:35,014 --> 01:44:37,934
You did not come for Echoes.

685
01:44:39,758 --> 01:44:42,906
And you were not alone.

686
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:45,505
I'm sorry.

687
01:44:48,333 --> 01:44:50,978
Proximus's apes found our camp.

688
01:44:53,943 --> 01:44:55,631
They killed everyone.

689
01:44:57,136 --> 01:44:59,234
I barely escaped.

690
01:45:00,237 --> 01:45:02,928
I needed your help.

691
01:45:03,111 --> 01:45:06,212
- And I was afraid.
- The more you speak,

692
01:45:06,395 --> 01:45:08,584
the less I believe.

693
01:45:08,767 --> 01:45:10,864
I was wrong not to trust you.

694
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:12,142
And I know that now.

695
01:45:12,278 --> 01:45:15,699
I trust you only to help yourself.

696
01:45:18,299 --> 01:45:20,990
But that could help me now.

697
01:45:25,733 --> 01:45:27,330
I have questions.

698
01:45:28,835 --> 01:45:30,522
You answer true,

699
01:45:31,435 --> 01:45:32,940
maybe I help.

700
01:45:36,361 --> 01:45:39,052
What do you need inside vault?

701
01:45:41,651 --> 01:45:42,746
It's…

702
01:45:43,796 --> 01:45:45,072
like a book.

703
01:45:46,349 --> 01:45:47,855
- A special book.
- How?

704
01:45:49,405 --> 01:45:50,500
Special?

705
01:45:52,142 --> 01:45:55,152
Humans lost their ability to speak.

706
01:45:55,289 --> 01:45:57,205
And this book might bring it back.

707
01:45:59,075 --> 01:46:00,991
A book can do this?

708
01:46:01,903 --> 01:46:03,317
This one can.

709
01:46:11,389 --> 01:46:16,406
Raka said apes and humans

710
01:46:17,911 --> 01:46:19,644
lived side by side.

711
01:46:22,518 --> 01:46:23,978
True or not true?

712
01:46:27,399 --> 01:46:28,676
Apes were silent.

713
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:31,914
Like the Echo.

714
01:46:33,784 --> 01:46:35,471
Humans were dominant.

715
01:46:37,114 --> 01:46:38,619
The virus spread…

716
01:46:39,987 --> 01:46:41,629
that we created.

717
01:46:42,724 --> 01:46:44,502
It made apes smarter.

718
01:46:46,008 --> 01:46:48,197
And it almost killed all of us.

719
01:46:55,723 --> 01:46:58,687
You know a way inside, yes?

720
01:47:00,557 --> 01:47:01,652
Yes.

721
01:47:03,339 --> 01:47:05,300
One last question.

722
01:47:08,813 --> 01:47:13,419
Will water destroy what is inside?

723
01:47:35,814 --> 01:47:36,908
Noa.

724
01:47:38,505 --> 01:47:42,655
I need your help.

725
01:47:44,571 --> 01:47:46,577
What help?

726
01:47:50,956 --> 01:47:53,420
A climb.

727
01:47:53,556 --> 01:47:57,433
One I cannot do alone.

728
01:47:57,570 --> 01:47:58,664
Why?

729
01:48:00,124 --> 01:48:03,180
To free our clan.

730
01:48:27,764 --> 01:48:30,318
Anaya scared.

731
01:49:09,041 --> 01:49:11,596
Soona, this is Mae.

732
01:49:14,195 --> 01:49:15,426
Hello, Soona.

733
01:49:20,353 --> 01:49:21,811
What do we do?

734
01:49:24,137 --> 01:49:25,734
We're gonna need all of this.

735
01:49:26,875 --> 01:49:28,106
Follow me.

736
01:49:43,158 --> 01:49:44,389
Careful.

737
01:49:47,536 --> 01:49:51,869
The power runs through, yes?

738
01:49:54,468 --> 01:49:55,563
Yes.

739
01:50:13,488 --> 01:50:17,456
You cannot make hard climb…

740
01:50:20,558 --> 01:50:22,200
without Anaya.

741
01:50:37,571 --> 01:50:38,848
Hello, Echo.

742
01:50:57,775 --> 01:50:59,372
This burns hot.

743
01:50:59,508 --> 01:51:01,151
But under pressure,

744
01:51:02,701 --> 01:51:04,937
it will explode.

745
01:51:06,532 --> 01:51:08,859
How do you know this?

746
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:17,023
Oh, shit.

747
01:51:22,770 --> 01:51:23,865
"Shit"?

748
01:51:25,324 --> 01:51:27,696
- Take that over there.
- Okay.

749
01:51:27,832 --> 01:51:29,885
I go with Anaya.

750
01:51:30,570 --> 01:51:32,257
Safer that way.

751
01:51:33,762 --> 01:51:37,547
Anaya! Anaya. Stop.

752
01:51:37,730 --> 01:51:40,147
- You're doing it wrong.
- Okay.

753
01:51:40,285 --> 01:51:41,561
You like her.

754
01:51:44,298 --> 01:51:45,393
Soona.

755
01:51:47,673 --> 01:51:49,771
We were born within a sunset.

756
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:55,154
No. Anaya…

757
01:51:55,290 --> 01:51:57,160
He's just going to rebuild it.

758
01:52:10,022 --> 01:52:11,116
You…

759
01:52:14,036 --> 01:52:16,270
You had an opportunity.

760
01:52:16,408 --> 01:52:19,417
I gave you an opportunity.

761
01:52:19,554 --> 01:52:24,617
But you're fantasizing about a past
that can never come back.

762
01:52:31,778 --> 01:52:33,284
Listen to me.

763
01:52:34,879 --> 01:52:39,760
Trevathan, you don't belong here.

764
01:52:41,402 --> 01:52:43,774
You think it's over,

765
01:52:43,956 --> 01:52:45,279
but it's not.

766
01:52:46,875 --> 01:52:51,208
Nobody is going to blame you
for what happened here.

767
01:52:53,215 --> 01:52:56,545
Just come with us.

768
01:52:59,646 --> 01:53:00,740
Please?

769
01:53:09,042 --> 01:53:11,687
He's gonna skin your monkey alive.

770
01:53:16,658 --> 01:53:17,753
And you…

771
01:53:19,030 --> 01:53:20,125
Well…

772
01:53:22,451 --> 01:53:24,413
you're gonna learn.

773
01:53:33,170 --> 01:53:34,309
Oh, no.

774
01:53:34,492 --> 01:53:35,587
Please!

775
01:54:42,406 --> 01:54:43,911
We need to go.

776
01:54:44,047 --> 01:54:45,461
It'll be light soon.

777
01:55:07,719 --> 01:55:10,411
You said there would be climb!

778
01:55:26,146 --> 01:55:27,240
Mae, wait!

779
01:55:35,451 --> 01:55:36,909
Mae!

780
01:55:41,471 --> 01:55:42,565
There!

781
01:55:43,569 --> 01:55:45,576
We need to go up there.

782
01:55:47,673 --> 01:55:49,543
Now we climb?

783
01:56:12,805 --> 01:56:15,085
Easier than Top Nest.

784
01:56:15,997 --> 01:56:17,275
Keep climbing.

785
01:56:43,227 --> 01:56:44,321
Noa!

786
01:56:58,598 --> 01:56:59,692
Shit?

787
01:57:01,015 --> 01:57:02,109
Mm-hmm.

788
01:58:11,847 --> 01:58:13,078
Wait. Careful.

789
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:19,875
Oops.

790
01:58:20,741 --> 01:58:21,973
Anaya!

791
01:58:54,037 --> 01:58:58,097
Noa, what is this place?

792
01:59:00,925 --> 01:59:02,064
It smells.

793
01:59:12,372 --> 01:59:13,832
What is that? Noa!

794
01:59:14,926 --> 01:59:16,568
Noa! What happening?

795
01:59:55,246 --> 01:59:57,435
Echo build all this?

796
02:00:23,706 --> 02:00:24,801
Wait here.

797
02:01:22,908 --> 02:01:24,095
<i>Mama!</i>

798
02:02:44,916 --> 02:02:48,382
The symbols have meaning.

799
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:48,405
Time to go.

800
02:04:15,452 --> 02:04:19,146
Whoa. What are they?

801
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:21,655
Come!

802
02:05:04,301 --> 02:05:05,942
We'll have to move fast.

803
02:05:06,672 --> 02:05:08,314
You go to your clan

804
02:05:08,497 --> 02:05:10,138
and I'll trigger the explosion.

805
02:06:10,663 --> 02:06:16,228
Noa, you are a very useful ape.

806
02:06:17,641 --> 02:06:22,066
You understand so many things.

807
02:06:22,248 --> 02:06:25,122
And yet, you fail to observe

808
02:06:25,259 --> 02:06:28,679
one of the most important.

809
02:06:30,640 --> 02:06:33,833
You cannot trust a human!

810
02:06:35,612 --> 02:06:39,672
Here comes your clan to bear witness.

811
02:06:43,229 --> 02:06:45,782
You may be fool enough

812
02:06:45,965 --> 02:06:50,526
to put your faith
in such a duplicitous creature.

813
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:54,631
But I am not.

814
02:07:03,525 --> 02:07:04,849
Tell me, Noa,

815
02:07:05,761 --> 02:07:07,813
ape to ape,

816
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:14,837
what did Mae have planned
for me inside my own vault?

817
02:07:17,802 --> 02:07:19,306
Okay.

818
02:07:19,443 --> 02:07:22,819
So what do you choose?

819
02:07:22,956 --> 02:07:26,422
A human over an ape?

820
02:07:27,517 --> 02:07:31,257
Your sweet little Soona…

821
02:07:33,309 --> 02:07:35,909
…or that stinky human?

822
02:07:37,186 --> 02:07:38,508
Tell me your plan!

823
02:07:41,017 --> 02:07:42,157
No!

824
02:08:22,476 --> 02:08:23,890
I see.

825
02:08:26,262 --> 02:08:28,998
You can leave, Mae.

826
02:08:30,687 --> 02:08:32,238
You can go.

827
02:08:32,419 --> 02:08:35,795
You're free. Just tell me…

828
02:08:35,977 --> 02:08:41,085
are there more of those in there?

829
02:08:48,155 --> 02:08:49,387
Mae?

830
02:08:50,755 --> 02:08:51,895
Mae.

831
02:08:53,719 --> 02:08:54,906
No.

832
02:08:56,547 --> 02:08:58,600
We cannot.

833
02:09:00,060 --> 02:09:01,291
He can't have it.

834
02:09:01,701 --> 02:09:03,069
Mae.

835
02:09:04,940 --> 02:09:06,353
- I'm sorry.
- Mae!

836
02:09:07,767 --> 02:09:09,500
No!

837
02:09:09,683 --> 02:09:12,055
Mae, no!

838
02:09:14,473 --> 02:09:15,795
Mae!

839
02:09:42,568 --> 02:09:44,073
What have you done?

840
02:09:51,462 --> 02:09:52,967
Climb.

841
02:09:53,103 --> 02:09:54,198
Climb!

842
02:09:55,248 --> 02:09:56,616
- Climb!
- No.

843
02:10:02,774 --> 02:10:03,868
No!

844
02:10:51,622 --> 02:10:53,492
Noa! Noa!

845
02:10:53,674 --> 02:10:56,229
- Soona!
- Behind you!

846
02:10:56,365 --> 02:10:58,281
Climb!

847
02:10:59,877 --> 02:11:01,702
Son! Son!

848
02:11:01,839 --> 02:11:03,435
- Mother!
- Son!

849
02:11:03,572 --> 02:11:05,579
Mother! Mother!

850
02:11:05,715 --> 02:11:06,901
Mother!

851
02:11:08,634 --> 02:11:09,775
Dar!

852
02:11:09,957 --> 02:11:11,736
Grab her!

853
02:11:11,918 --> 02:11:14,245
Dar! Grab my hand!

854
02:11:14,382 --> 02:11:17,437
- Mother!
- Dar!

855
02:11:21,086 --> 02:11:22,181
Dar!

856
02:11:26,194 --> 02:11:27,654
Dar, got you.

857
02:11:28,885 --> 02:11:30,665
Noa, what we do?

858
02:11:32,899 --> 02:11:34,905
This way! Go!

859
02:11:43,253 --> 02:11:46,627
Eagle Clan! Climb!

860
02:11:46,765 --> 02:11:49,318
Follow Soona! Follow Anaya!

861
02:11:49,455 --> 02:11:52,100
- This way! Climb!
- Go. Go.

862
02:11:52,238 --> 02:11:53,333
Climb!

863
02:12:02,227 --> 02:12:03,366
This way!

864
02:12:05,328 --> 02:12:06,513
Hurry!

865
02:12:08,429 --> 02:12:09,934
Follow Soona!

866
02:12:10,071 --> 02:12:12,123
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Go!

867
02:12:17,323 --> 02:12:19,604
- Come.
- Go!

868
02:12:19,786 --> 02:12:20,972
Climb, Soona!

869
02:12:21,109 --> 02:12:22,796
This the way out!

870
02:12:23,344 --> 02:12:24,895
Hurry!

871
02:12:25,078 --> 02:12:26,172
- Climb!
- Noa!

872
02:12:26,354 --> 02:12:27,585
Mother, go!

873
02:12:27,723 --> 02:12:29,410
- Noa!
- Climb, Anaya!

874
02:12:29,547 --> 02:12:31,007
- Soona, go!
- Lead them!

875
02:12:31,144 --> 02:12:32,785
Go! Climb!

876
02:12:32,922 --> 02:12:35,750
Go! Go, hurry!

877
02:15:36,047 --> 02:15:39,331
You think you can destroy my kingdom?

878
02:15:50,323 --> 02:15:54,200
You think you can destroy what I am?

879
02:16:00,585 --> 02:16:01,680
- Noa!
- Leave him.

880
02:16:16,549 --> 02:16:18,054
Noa.

881
02:16:19,924 --> 02:16:24,165
You showed so much promise.

882
02:16:26,081 --> 02:16:29,730
You are going to stand,

883
02:16:29,867 --> 02:16:33,379
so that you can bend for your king…

884
02:16:34,291 --> 02:16:35,568
before you die.

885
02:16:41,223 --> 02:16:45,648
And you will all bear witness

886
02:16:45,831 --> 02:16:52,216
as Noa bends before his king.

887
02:16:55,865 --> 02:16:57,324
Now stand.

888
02:16:58,374 --> 02:17:00,152
Stand now!

889
02:17:03,528 --> 02:17:04,622
That's it.

890
02:17:05,306 --> 02:17:07,085
Clever ape.

891
02:17:33,264 --> 02:17:34,861
What is this?

892
02:17:38,556 --> 02:17:40,517
Trevathan would love this.

893
02:18:13,904 --> 02:18:14,999
Enough!

894
02:18:17,735 --> 02:18:18,829
Enough!

895
02:19:35,318 --> 02:19:39,651
Let us go home.

896
02:20:13,220 --> 02:20:14,497
He's coming!

897
02:20:18,328 --> 02:20:19,560
Soft?

898
02:20:20,335 --> 02:20:22,388
Too firm.

899
02:20:23,300 --> 02:20:24,394
Too firm.

900
02:20:26,355 --> 02:20:27,907
- Silk.
- Good.

901
02:20:35,158 --> 02:20:36,253
Noa.

902
02:20:59,971 --> 02:21:01,749
I came to say goodbye.

903
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:14,063
Proximus was right.

904
02:21:15,295 --> 02:21:19,446
Humans will never give up.

905
02:21:20,814 --> 02:21:25,147
Not until you claim all things

906
02:21:25,284 --> 02:21:26,972
for yourselves.

907
02:21:28,203 --> 02:21:29,663
It was ours.

908
02:21:30,620 --> 02:21:33,311
That silo was a human place

909
02:21:33,494 --> 02:21:35,456
with human things and human ideas.

910
02:21:35,592 --> 02:21:37,280
It was not meant for apes.

911
02:21:37,416 --> 02:21:40,290
What is for apes?

912
02:21:42,616 --> 02:21:44,896
Should we go back to silence?

913
02:21:47,085 --> 02:21:49,867
We will rebuild our home.

914
02:21:51,783 --> 02:21:53,061
Better.

915
02:21:53,607 --> 02:21:54,931
Stronger.

916
02:21:55,979 --> 02:21:58,488
From what we have learned.

917
02:22:09,754 --> 02:22:12,171
If Raka were here,

918
02:22:13,813 --> 02:22:16,458
he would tell us his Caesar

919
02:22:17,462 --> 02:22:20,198
had much to say on this.

920
02:22:24,942 --> 02:22:27,497
Was he right?

921
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:40,815
Can ape and human live together?

922
02:22:52,901 --> 02:22:54,315
I don't know.

923
02:23:09,868 --> 02:23:12,102
Important.

924
02:24:05,740 --> 02:24:07,565
See you soon.

925
02:25:32,309 --> 02:25:33,404
Come.

926
02:25:39,652 --> 02:25:41,613
Rescaling back down to 20.

927
02:25:41,750 --> 02:25:44,213
New latitude point, 2.722.

928
02:25:44,350 --> 02:25:45,947
Copy that. Spooling up.

929
02:25:46,083 --> 02:25:46,905
Let me know
what that distribution looks like.

930
02:25:46,995 --> 02:25:48,136
Let's get over here.

931
02:25:48,273 --> 02:25:49,687
Readings have been confirmed.

932
02:25:49,777 --> 02:25:51,601
- Link is ready!
- Pulling up now.

933
02:26:41,043 --> 02:26:42,549
Hello.

934
02:26:43,461 --> 02:26:44,966
Is anyone there?

935
02:26:45,102 --> 02:26:46,470
Come on.

936
02:26:46,608 --> 02:26:48,022
Do you hear me?

937
02:26:51,123 --> 02:26:52,765
<i>Yes, hello?</i>

938
02:26:52,901 --> 02:26:55,227
<i>This is Fort Wayne, Indiana.
We read you!</i>

939
02:26:56,870 --> 02:26:59,059
<i>It's good to hear
another voice out there.</i>

940
02:26:59,196 --> 02:27:01,249
<i>Tell me where you are.
What's your location?</i>
