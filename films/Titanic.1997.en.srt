1
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,300
Man: 13 METERS. YOU SHOULD SEE IT.

2
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,150
OKAY, TAKE HER UP AND OVER THE BOW RAIL.

3
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,150
Okay, Mir 2, we're going over the bow.

4
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,670
Stay with us.

5
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,190
OKAY, QUIET. WE'RE ROLLING.

6
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,700
SEEING HER COMING OUT OF THE DARKNESS LIKE A GHOST SHIP

7
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,700
STILL GETS ME EVERY TIME--

8
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,700
TO SEE THE SAD RUIN OF THE GREAT SHIP SITTING HERE

9
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:26,210
WHERE SHE LANDED AT 2:30 IN THE MORNING OF APRIL 15, 1912

10
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,710
AFTER HER LONG FALL FROM THE WORLD ABOVE.

11
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,230
YOU ARE SO FULL OF SHIT, BOSS.

12
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,000
Man: DIVE SIX-- HERE WE ARE AGAIN ON THE DECK OF TITANIC

13
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,870
2½ MILES DOWN, 3,821 METERS.

14
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,380
THE PRESSURE OUTSIDE IS 3½ TONS PER SQUARE INCH.

15
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,630
THESE WINDOWS ARE NINE INCHES THICK AND IF THEY GO

16
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,130
IT'S SAYONARA IN TWO MICROSECONDS.

17
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,140
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH OF THAT BULLSHIT.

18
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,780
JUST PUT HER DOWN ON THE ROOF

19
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,160
OF THE OFFICER'S QUARTERS LIKE YESTERDAY.

20
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,150
Man: SURE.

21
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,170
Man: Okay, Mir 2.

22
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,660
We have landed right on the grand staircase.

23
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,160
You guys set to launch?

24
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,910
YEAH, BROCK-- LAUNCHING DUNKIN NOW.

25
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,160
GO, CHARLIE.

26
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,170
ALL RIGHT, TETHER OUT.

27
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,420
Man: TETHER OUT.

28
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,920
Man: Okay, Brock

29
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,940
we're dropping down along the hull.

30
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,310
Brock: ROGER THAT.

31
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,810
OKAY, DROP DOWN AND GO

32
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,310
INTO THE FIRST CLASS GANGWAY DOOR.

33
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,330
I WANT YOU GUYS WORKING THE D DECK RECEPTION AREA

34
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,320
AND THE DINING SALOON.

35
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Man: Copy that.

36
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,830
TETHER OUT.

37
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,830
Man: TETHER OUT.

38
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,830
NOW LEFT, LEFT.

39
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,830
I'M COMING LEFT.

40
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Brock: Snoop Dog is on the move.

41
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,340
We're headed down the stairwell.

42
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,350
OKAY, LEWIS, DROP DOWN TO B DECK.

43
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,850
A DECK.

44
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,850
Lewis: GIVE ME SOME ROPE, CAPTAIN.

45
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,350
B DECK-- GET IN THERE, GET IN THERE.

46
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,430
Brock: WATCH THE DOORFRAME.

47
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,430
WATCH THE DOORFRAME-- WATCH IT, WATCH IT.

48
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,810
I SEE IT. I GOT IT.

49
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,320
WE'RE GOOD-- JUST CHILL, BOSS.

50
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,450
Brock: MAKE YOUR TURN.

51
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,450
COME AROUND.

52
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,950
Lewis: CABLE OUT, CAPTAIN.

53
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,720
MAKE YOUR TURN, WATCH THE WALL.

54
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,210
YEAH, BROCK, WE'RE AT THE PIANO, YOU COPY?

55
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,210
Brock: Okay, copy that.

56
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,470
Brock: OKAY, RIGHT THERE.

57
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,100
RIGHT THERE-- THAT'S IT!

58
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,620
THAT'S THE BEDROOM DOOR.

59
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,360
I SEE IT... I SEE IT.

60
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,370
WE'RE IN!

61
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,370
WE'RE IN, BABY, WE'RE THERE!

62
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,870
Brock: THAT'S HOCKLEY'S BED.

63
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,380
THAT'S WHERE THE SON OF A BITCH SLEPT.

64
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,750
Lewis: OOPS, SOMEBODY LEFT THE WATER RUNNING.

65
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,250
HEY, HOLD IT JUST A SECOND.

66
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,750
GO BACK TO THE RIGHT.

67
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,260
THAT WARDROBE DOOR-- GET CLOSER.

68
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,760
YOU SMELLING SOMETHING, BOSS?

69
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,780
I WANT TO SEE WHAT'S UNDER IT.

70
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,270
GIVE ME MY HANDS, MAN.

71
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,520
ALL RIGHT.

72
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,280
TAKE IT EASY, IT MIGHT COME APART.

73
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,780
OKAY.

74
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,780
GO, GO, GO, GO.

75
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,280
FLIP IT OVER, FLIP IT OVER, GO.

76
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,170
KEEP GOING, GO, GO, GO.

77
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,540
OKAY, DROP IT.

78
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,800
OH, BABY, BABY, ARE YOU SEEING THIS, BOSS?

79
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,800
IT'S PAYDAY, BOYS.

80
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,820
KA-CHING!

81
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,820
WE DID IT, BOBBY.

82
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,340
Lewis: OH, YEAH, WHO'S THE MAN?

83
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,330
WHO'S THE BEST, BABY?

84
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,830
SAY IT, SAY IT.

85
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,830
YOU ARE, LEWIS.

86
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,100
BOBBY, MY CIGAR.

87
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,720
Bobby: RIGHT HERE.

88
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,850
Brock: OKAY, CRACK HER OPEN.

89
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,130
SHIT.

90
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,630
NO DIAMOND.

91
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,630
YOU KNOW, BOSS, THIS SAME THING HAPPENED TO GERALDO

92
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,650
AND HIS CAREER NEVER RECOVERED.

93
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,140
TURN THE CAMERA OFF.

94
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,140
Bobby: BROCK, THE PARTNERS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

95
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,160
HOW IT'S GOING.

96
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,650
HEY, DAVE, BARRY, HI.

97
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,150
LOOK, IT WASN'T IN THE SAFE

98
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,150
BUT HEY, HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

99
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,650
THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF PLACES IT COULD BE.

100
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,660
HELL YES!-- THE FLOOR DEBRIS IN THE SUITE, THE MOTHER'S ROOM

101
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,160
PURSER'S SAFE ON C DECK.

102
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
JIMMY HOFFA'S BRIEFCASE.

103
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,040
Brock: A DOZEN OTHER PLACES.

104
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,560
GUYS, LOOK, YOU'VE JUST GOT TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS.

105
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,050
I KNOW WE'RE CLOSE.

106
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,050
WE JUST GOT TO GO THROUGH A LITTLE PROCESS OF ELIMINATION.

107
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,550
HANG ON A SECOND.

108
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,060
LET ME SEE THAT.

109
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,060
Bobby: WE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING HERE, GUYS.

110
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,810
WHERE'S THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE NECKLACE?

111
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,680
WE'LL CALL YOU RIGHT BACK.

112
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,950
I'LL BE GODDAMNED.

113
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,450
Reporter: Treasure hunter Brock Lovett

114
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,950
is best known for finding Spanish gold...

115
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,950
IT'S OKAY. I'LL FEED YOU IN A MINUTE.

116
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,470
Now he has chartered Russian subs to reach

117
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
the most famous shipwreck of all: the Titanic.

118
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
He is with us live via satellite

119
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,210
from the research ship Keldysh in the North Atlantic.

120
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,220
Hello, Brock.

121
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Brock: Hello, Tracy.

122
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,220
Everyone knows the familiar stories of Titanic--

123
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,720
the nobility, the band playing till the very end and all that.

124
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,220
But what I'm interested in are the untold stories

125
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,490
the secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.

126
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,480
We're out here using robot technology

127
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,480
to go further into the wreck

128
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,480
than anybody's ever done before.

129
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,130
Your expedition is at the center of a storm of controversy

130
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,620
over salvage rights and even ethics.

131
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,620
Many are calling you a grave robber.

132
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,640
Nobody called the recovery of the artifacts

133
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,380
of King Tut's tomb "grave robbing."

134
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,380
Woman: WHAT IS IT?

135
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,380
TURN THAT UP, DEAR.

136
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,380
I have museum-trained experts out here making sure

137
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,390
that these relics are preserved and catalogued properly.

138
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,890
Take a look at this drawing that we found just today:

139
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,890
a piece of paper that's been underwater for 84 years

140
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,260
and my team were able to preserve it intact.

141
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,780
Should this have remained unseen

142
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,770
at the bottom of the ocean for eternity?

143
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,020
I'LL BE GODDAMNED.

144
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,020
Man: Vnimanye, Vnimanye...

145
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,030
Bobby: BROCK!

146
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,040
THERE'S A SATELLITE CALL FOR YOU.

147
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,530
BOBBY, WE'RE LAUNCHING.

148
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,280
YOU SEE THESE SUBMERSIBLES GOING IN THE WATER?

149
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
TRUST ME, BUDDY.

150
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,030
YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS CALL.

151
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,290
THIS BETTER BE GOOD.

152
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,790
YOU GOT TO SPEAK UP.

153
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,290
SHE'S KIND OF OLD.

154
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,790
GREAT.

155
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,790
THIS IS BROCK LOVETT.

156
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
HOW CAN I HELP YOU, MRS...

157
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
CALVERT, ROSE CALVERT.

158
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
MRS. CALVERT?

159
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,300
I WAS JUST WONDERING

160
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,440
IF YOU HAD FOUND THE HEART OF THE OCEAN YET, MR. LOVETT.

161
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,560
TOLD YOU YOU WANTED TO TAKE THE CALL.

162
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,060
ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE MY ATTENTION, ROSE.

163
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,330
CAN YOU TELL US WHO THE WOMAN IN THE PICTURE IS?

164
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
OH, YES.

165
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,320
THE WOMAN IN THE PICTURE IS ME.

166
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,840
SHE'S A GODDAMNED LIAR--

167
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,340
SOME NUT CASE SEEKING MONEY OR PUBLICITY.

168
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,340
GOD ONLY KNOWS WHY, LIKE THAT RUSSIAN BABE, ANESTHESIA.

169
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,350
THEY'RE INBOUND!

170
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,850
ROSE DEWITT BUKATER DIED ON THE TITANIC

171
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,370
WHEN SHE WAS 17, RIGHT?

172
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,860
THAT'S RIGHT.

173
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,360
IF SHE HAD LIVED, SHE'D BE OVER 100 BY NOW.

174
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,860
101 NEXT MONTH.

175
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,870
OKAY, SO SHE'S A VERY OLD GODDAMNED LIAR.

176
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,870
LOOK, I'VE ALREADY DONE THE BACKGROUND ON THIS WOMAN

177
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,370
ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE '20s

178
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,370
WHEN SHE WAS WORKING AS AN ACTRESS.

179
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,620
AN ACTRESS!

180
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,140
THERE'S YOUR FIRST CLUE, SHERLOCK!

181
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,130
HER NAME WAS ROSE DAWSON BACK THEN.

182
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,130
THEN SHE MARRIES THIS GUY NAMED CALVERT.

183
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,630
THEY MOVE TO CEDAR RAPIDS

184
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,630
AND SHE PUNCHES OUT A COUPLE OF KIDS.

185
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,630
NOW, CALVERT'S DEAD

186
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,150
AND FROM WHAT I HEAR, CEDAR RAPIDS IS DEAD.

187
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,140
AND EVERYBODY WHO KNOWS ABOUT THE DIAMOND

188
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,390
IS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD OR ON THIS BOAT, BUT SHE KNOWS.

189
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,410
DOESN'T EXACTLY TRAVEL LIGHT, DOES SHE?

190
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,410
MRS. CALVERT, I'M BROCK LOVETT.

191
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,910
WELCOME TO THE KELDYSH.

192
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,420
OKAY, LET'S GET HER INSIDE THERE.

193
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,420
HI, MS. CALVERT.

194
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,420
HI.

195
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
WELCOME TO THE KELDYSH.

196
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,420
Man: HEY.

197
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,940
HEY!

198
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,570
Rose: YES?

199
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,070
ARE YOUR STATEROOMS ALL RIGHT?

200
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,570
Rose: OH, YES, VERY NICE.

201
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,570
HAVE YOU MET MY GRANDDAUGHTER LIZZIE?

202
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,080
SHE TAKES CARE OF ME.

203
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,580
WE MET JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO.

204
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,080
REMEMBER, NANA, UP ON DECK?

205
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,580
THERE, THAT'S NICE.

206
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,590
HAVE TO HAVE MY PICTURES WHEN I TRAVEL.

207
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,590
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

208
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,090
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE?

209
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,090
YES.

210
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,350
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MY DRAWING.

211
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,240
Brock: LOUIS XVI WORE A FABULOUS STONE

212
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,230
THAT WAS CALLED THE BLUE DIAMOND OF THE CROWN

213
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,230
WHICH DISAPPEARED IN 1792

214
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,740
ABOUT THE SAME TIME OLD LOUIS LOST EVERYTHING

215
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,240
FROM THE NECK UP.

216
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,490
THE THEORY GOES

217
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,120
THAT THE CROWN DIAMOND WAS CHOPPED, TOO

218
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,140
RECUT INTO A HEARTLIKE SHAPE

219
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,130
THAT BECAME KNOWN AS "THE HEART OF THE OCEAN."

220
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,630
TODAY IT WOULD BE WORTH MORE THAN THE HOPE DIAMOND.

221
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,380
IT WAS A DREADFUL, HEAVY THING.

222
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,900
I ONLY WORE IT THIS ONCE.

223
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,390
Lizzie: YOU ACTUALLY THINK

224
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,390
THIS IS YOU, NANA?

225
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,890
IT IS ME, DEAR.

226
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,390
WASN'T I A DISH?

227
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,900
I TRACKED IT DOWN THROUGH INSURANCE RECORDS--

228
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,150
AN OLD CLAIM THAT WAS SETTLED UNDER TERMS OF ABSOLUTE SECRECY.

229
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,150
CAN YOU TELL ME

230
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,170
WHO THE CLAIMANT WAS, ROSE?

231
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,660
I SHOULD IMAGINE SOMEONE NAMED HOCKLEY.

232
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,160
Brock: NATHAN HOCKLEY, THAT'S RIGHT.

233
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
PITTSBURGH STEEL TYCOON.

234
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,670
CLAIM WAS FOR A DIAMOND NECKLACE

235
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,170
HIS SON CALEDON BOUGHT HIS FIANCEE-- YOU

236
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,670
A WEEK BEFORE HE SAILED ON TITANIC.

237
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,670
IT WAS FILED RIGHT AFTER THE SINKING

238
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,190
SO THE DIAMOND HAD TO HAVE GONE DOWN WITH THE SHIP.

239
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,180
YOU SEE THE DATE?

240
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,180
"APRIL 14, 1912."

241
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,700
WHICH MEANS IF YOUR GRANDMOTHER IS WHO SHE SAYS SHE IS

242
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,690
SHE WAS WEARING THE DIAMOND THE DAY THE TITANIC SANK.

243
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,560
AND THAT MAKES YOU MY NEW BEST FRIEND.

244
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,060
THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

245
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,560
WE RECOVERED FROM YOUR STATEROOM.

246
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,570
THIS WAS MINE.

247
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,070
HOW EXTRAORDINARY!

248
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,070
AND IT LOOKS THE SAME AS IT DID

249
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,340
THE LAST TIME I SAW IT.

250
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,840
THE REFLECTION HAS CHANGED A BIT.

251
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,500
ARE YOU READY TO GO BACK TO TITANIC?

252
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,240
Lewis: OKAY, HERE WE GO.

253
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,750
SHE HITS THE BERG ON THE STARBOARD SIDE, RIGHT?

254
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,750
SHE KIND OF BUMPS ALONG

255
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,750
PUNCHING HOLES LIKE MORSE CODE-- DIT-DIT-DIT--

256
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,250
ALONG THE SIDE, BELOW THE WATERLINE.

257
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
THEN THE FORWARD COMPARTMENTS START TO FLOOD.

258
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,020
NOW, AS THE WATER LEVEL RISES

259
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,010
IT SPILLS OVER THE WATERTIGHT BULKHEADS

260
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,760
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY DON'T GO ANY HIGHER THAN E DECK.

261
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,130
SO NOW AS THE BOW GOES DOWN, THE STERN RISES UP

262
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,130
SLOW AT FIRST, THEN FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL FINALLY

263
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,640
SHE'S GOT HER WHOLE ASS IS STICKING UP IN THE AIR

264
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
AND THAT'S A BIG ASS.

265
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,640
WE'RE TALKING 20,000, 30,000 TONS, OKAY?

266
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,640
AND THE HULL'S NOT DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH THAT PRESSURE

267
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,650
SO WHAT HAPPENS?

268
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,160
SHE SPLITS, RIGHT DOWN TO THE KEEL

269
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,150
AND THE STERN FALLS BACK LEVEL.

270
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,540
THEN AS THE BOW SINKS, IT PULLS THE STERN VERTICAL

271
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,040
AND THEN FINALLY DETACHES.

272
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,540
NOW, THE STERN SECTION JUST KIND OF BOBS THERE LIKE A CORK

273
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,540
FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES, FLOODS

274
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,420
AND FINALLY GOES UNDER ABOUT 2:20 A.M.

275
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,060
TWO HOURS AND 40 MINUTES AFTER THE COLLISION.

276
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,550
THE BOW SECTION PLANES AWAY

277
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,550
LANDING ABOUT A HALF A MILE AWAY

278
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,570
GOING 20, 30 KNOTS WHEN IT HITS THE OCEAN FLOOR.

279
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,560
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

280
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:11,070
THANK YOU FOR THAT FINE FORENSIC ANALYSIS, MR. BODINE.

281
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:16,570
OF COURSE, THE EXPERIENCE OF IT WAS... SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT.

282
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,590
WILL YOU SHARE IT WITH US?

283
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,250
I'M TAKING HER TO REST.

284
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,250
NO.

285
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,250
COME ON, NANA.

286
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,750
NO!

287
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,440
TAPE RECORDER.

288
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,930
TELL US, ROSE.

289
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,930
IT'S BEEN 84 YEARS.

290
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:32,930
IT'S OKAY.

291
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,950
JUST TRY TO REMEMBER ANYTHING--

292
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,940
ANYTHING AT ALL.

293
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,820
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR THIS OR NOT, MR. LOVETT?

294
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,330
IT'S BEEN 84 YEARS...

295
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,840
AND I CAN STILL SMELL THE FRESH PAINT.

296
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,340
THE CHINA HAD NEVER BEEN USED.

297
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,840
THE SHEETS HAD NEVER BEEN SLEPT IN.

298
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:07,850
TITANIC WAS CALLED "THE SHIP OF DREAMS"

299
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,360
AND IT WAS, IT REALLY WAS.

300
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,640
Man: ALL THIRD-CLASS PASSENGERS

301
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,640
WITH A FORWARD BERTH

302
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,640
THIS WAY, PLEASE, THIS QUEUE.

303
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
RIGHT HERE.

304
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,650
BIG BOAT, HUH?

305
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,660
DADDY, IT'S A SHIP.

306
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,010
YOU'RE RIGHT.

307
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,680
I DON'T SEE WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT.

308
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
IT DOESN'T LOOK ANY BIGGER

309
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,180
THAN THE MAURITANIA.

310
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,180
YOU CAN BE BLASE ABOUT SOME THINGS, ROSE

311
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,700
BUT NOT ABOUT TITANIC.

312
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,050
IT'S OVER 100 FEET LONGER THAN MAURITANIA

313
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,570
AND FAR MORE LUXURIOUS.

314
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,060
YOUR DAUGHTER IS FAR TOO DIFFICULT

315
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,310
TO IMPRESS, RUTH.

316
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,310
SO THIS IS THE SHIP

317
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,810
THEY SAY IS UNSINKABLE.

318
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,810
IT IS UNSINKABLE.

319
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,310
GOD HIMSELF COULD NOT SINK THIS SHIP.

320
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,320
SIR, YOU HAVE TO CHECK YOUR BAGGAGE

321
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,820
THROUGH THE MAIN TERMINAL.

322
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,820
IT'S ROUND THAT WAY, SIR.

323
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,320
I PUT MY FAITH IN YOU, GOOD SIR.

324
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,820
NOW, KINDLY SEE MY MAN.

325
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,320
YES, SIR, MY PLEASURE, SIR.

326
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,330
IF I CAN DO ANYTHING AT ALL.

327
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,830
OH, YES, RIGHT.

328
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,830
ALL THE TRUNKS FROM THAT CAR THERE

329
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,330
12 FROM HERE, AND THE SAFE...

330
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,840
TO THE PARLOR SUITE, ROOMS B-52, 54, 56.

331
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
LADIES...

332
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,220
BETTER HURRY.

333
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
MY COAT?

334
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
Woman: I HAVE IT.

335
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,980
Man: ALL THIRD-CLASS PASSENGERS

336
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,980
DUE HERE FOR HEALTH INSPECTION.

337
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:24,500
ALL THIRD-CLASS PASSENGERS DUE HERE FOR HEALTH INSPECTION.

338
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,860
HEAD UP.

339
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,250
WELCOME ABOARD, MA'AM.

340
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,750
WELCOME TO TITANIC.

341
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:39,750
Rose: IT WAS THE SHIP OF DREAMS TO EVERYONE ELSE.

342
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,270
TO ME IT WAS A SLAVE SHIP

343
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,880
TAKING ME BACK TO AMERICA IN CHAINS.

344
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,380
OUTWARDLY, I WAS EVERYTHING A WELL-BROUGHT-UP GIRL SHOULD BE.

345
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,020
INSIDE, I WAS SCREAMING.

346
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,780
JACK, YOU ARE PAZZO.

347
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,300
YOU BET EVERYTHING WE HAVE.

348
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,290
WHEN YOU GOT NOTHING

349
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,790
YOU GOT NOTHING TO LOSE.

350
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,160
SVEN?

351
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,690
ALL RIGHT... MOMENT OF TRUTH.

352
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,190
SOMEBODY'S LIFE'S ABOUT TO CHANGE.

353
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,190
FABRIZIO?

354
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,210
NIENTE.

355
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,700
NIENTE.

356
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,200
OLAF?

357
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,200
NOTHING.

358
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
SVEN?

359
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,210
UH-OH...

360
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,710
TWO PAIR.

361
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,210
I'M SORRY, FABRIZIO.

362
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,710
CHE "SORRY?" MA VAFFANCULO!

363
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,210
YOU BET ALL THE MONEY.

364
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,230
I'M SORRY, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE

365
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,720
YOUR MOM AGAIN FOR A LONG TIME

366
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO AMERICA.

367
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,350
FULL HOUSE, BOYS.

368
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,870
WHOA!

369
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,470
YEAH!

370
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,490
DIO MIO, GRAZIE!

371
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,750
COME ON.

372
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,240
FIGLIO DI PUTTANA!

373
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,740
I'M GOING HOME!

374
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,240
I'M GOING HOME.

375
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,740
I GO TO AMERICA.

376
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,260
Man: NO, MATE.

377
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,250
TITANIC GO TO AMERICA IN FIVE MINUTES.

378
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,250
COME ON.

379
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,250
COME ON, HERE.

380
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,250
Fabrizio: ANDIAMO.

381
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,770
WE'RE RIDING IN HIGH STYLE NOW.

382
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,760
WE'RE A COUPLE OF REGULAR SWELLS.

383
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,260
WE'RE PRACTICALLY GODDAMN ROYALTY, RAGAZZO MIO.

384
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,760
Fabrizio: YOU SEE, IT'S MY DESTINO!

385
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,270
LIKE I TOLD YOU, I GO TO AMERICA

386
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,770
TO BE MILLIONARIO.

387
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,270
Driver: WHOA, WHOA!

388
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,270
BASTARDO!

389
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,270
YOU'RE PAZZO!

390
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,770
MAYBE, BUT I'VE GOT THE TICKETS.

391
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,160
COME ON, I THOUGHT YOU WERE FAST.

392
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
ASPETTA!

393
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
WAIT, WAIT!

394
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
HEY, WAIT.

395
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,430
WE'RE PASSENGERS.

396
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,920
PASSENGERS.

397
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,040
HAVE YOU BEEN THROUGH THE INSPECTION QUEUE?

398
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
OF COURSE!

399
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,540
ANYWAY, WE DON'T HAVE ANY LICE.

400
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,040
WE'RE AMERICANS, BOTH OF US.

401
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,430
RIGHT, COME ABOARD.

402
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,680
WE'RE THE LUCKIEST SONS OF BITCHES

403
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,180
IN THE WORLD, YOU KNOW THAT?

404
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,730
GOOD-BYE!

405
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,870
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY?

406
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,870
OF COURSE NOT-- THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

407
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,870
GOOD-BYE! I'LL MISS YOU!

408
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,870
GOOD-BYE!

409
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,370
I'M GOING TO NEVER FORGET YOU.

410
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,790
ALL THE WAY, DARLING.

411
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,310
360, 360...

412
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,800
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

413
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,300
OH, RIGHT HERE.

414
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,300
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

415
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,320
JACK.

416
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,810
NICE TO MEET YOU.

417
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,810
I'M JACK DAWSON.

418
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,810
NICE TO MEET YOU.

419
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,810
HOW YOU DOING?

420
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,810
WHO SAYS YOU GET TOP BUNK, HUH?

421
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,820
THIS IS YOUR PRIVATE PROMENADE DECK, SIR.

422
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,320
WOULD YOU BE REQUIRING ANYTHING?

423
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
HMM...

424
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,830
EXCUSE ME.

425
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,840
Woman: THIS ONE?

426
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,330
Rose: NO... IT HAD A LOT OF FACES ON IT.

427
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,830
THIS IS THE ONE.

428
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,830
WOULD YOU LIKE ALL OF THEM OUT, MISS?

429
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,850
YES... WE NEED A LITTLE COLOR IN THIS ROOM.

430
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,840
PUT IT IN THERE, IN THE WARDROBE.

431
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,360
GOD, NOT THOSE FINGER PAINTINGS AGAIN.

432
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,850
THEY CERTAINLY WERE A WASTE OF MONEY.

433
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,850
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CAL'S TASTE IN ART

434
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,850
AND MINE IS THAT I HAVE SOME.

435
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:55,850
THEY'RE FASCINATING...

436
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:59,360
LIKE BEING INSIDE A DREAM OR SOMETHING.

437
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,860
THERE'S TRUTH, BUT NO LOGIC.

438
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,360
WHAT'S THE ARTIST'S NAME?

439
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,860
SOMETHING PICASSO.

440
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,860
"SOMETHING PICASSO."

441
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,360
HE WON'T AMOUNT TO A THING.

442
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,380
HE WON'T, TRUST ME.

443
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,370
PUT THE DEGAS IN THE BEDROOM.

444
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,370
AT LEAST THEY WERE CHEAP.

445
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,370
AH, PUT IT IN THE WARDROBE.

446
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,380
AT CHERBOURG, A WOMAN CAME ABOARD NAMED MARGARET BROWN.

447
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,380
WE ALL CALLED HER MOLLY.

448
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,390
HISTORY WOULD CALL HER "THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN."

449
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,390
WELL, I WASN'T ABOUT TO WAIT

450
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,390
ALL DAY FOR YOU, SONNY.

451
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,890
HERE, YOU THINK YOU CAN MANAGE?

452
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,400
HER HUSBAND HAD STRUCK GOLD SOMEPLACE OUT WEST

453
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,400
AND SHE WAS WHAT MOTHER CALLED "NEW MONEY."

454
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,900
BY THE NEXT AFTERNOON, WE WERE STEAMING WEST

455
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,900
FROM THE COAST OF IRELAND

456
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,410
WITH NOTHING OUT AHEAD OF US BUT OCEAN.

457
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,920
TAKE HER TO SEA, MR. MURDOCH.

458
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,920
LET'S STRETCH HER LEGS.

459
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,670
YES, SIR.

460
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,170
ALL AHEAD FULL, MR. MOODY.

461
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,170
VERY GOOD, SIR.

462
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,310
ALL AHEAD FULL.

463
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,830
Man: ALL AHEAD FULL.

464
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,180
COME ON, LADS.

465
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,200
GET MOVING.

466
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,690
WHAT'S THE READING?

467
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,590
ALL RIGHT, LET'S STOKE THEM RIGHT UP!

468
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,210
WE'RE GOING FULL AHEAD!

469
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,020
21 KNOTS, SIR.

470
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,540
HEY, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK!

471
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,780
LOOK, LOOK!

472
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,660
SEE IT?

473
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

474
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,170
SEE HIM?

475
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,680
LOOK AT THAT ONE.

476
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,680
LOOK AT HIM JUMP!

477
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,550
WHOO-HOO!

478
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,320
WHOO!

479
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,840
I CAN SEE THE STATUE OF LIBERTY ALREADY!

480
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,460
VERY SMALL, OF COURSE.

481
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,470
I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD.

482
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,380
Man: SHE'S THE LARGEST MOVING OBJECT EVER MADE BY THE HAND OF MAN

483
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,900
IN ALL HISTORY.

484
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,390
AND OUR MASTER SHIPBUILDER, MR. ANDREWS HERE

485
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,520
DESIGNED HER FROM THE KEEL PLATES UP.

486
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,040
WELL, I MAY HAVE KNOCKED HER TOGETHER

487
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,530
BUT THE IDEA WAS MR. ISMAY'S.

488
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,780
HE ENVISIONED A STEAMER SO GRAND IN SCALE AND SO LUXURIOUS

489
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
IN ITS APPOINTMENTS

490
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,290
THAT ITS SUPREMACY WOULD NEVER BE CHALLENGED.

491
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,290
AND HERE SHE IS

492
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,420
WILLED INTO SOLID REALITY.

493
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,660
Man: HEAR, HEAR.

494
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,170
YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE THAT, ROSE.

495
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,300
SHE KNOWS.

496
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,810
WE'LL BOTH HAVE THE LAMB...

497
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,060
RARE, WITH VERY LITTLE MINT SAUCE.

498
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,060
HMM... YOU LIKE LAMB, RIGHT, SWEET PEA?

499
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:28,080
ARE YOU GOING TO CUT HER MEAT FOR HER, TOO, THERE, CAL?

500
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,320
HEY, UH, WHO THOUGHT OF THE NAME "TITANIC"?

501
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:34,830
WAS IT YOU, BRUCE?

502
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,330
WELL, YES, ACTUALLY.

503
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,330
I WANTED TO CONVEY SHEER SIZE

504
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,830
AND THE SIZE MEANS STABILITY

505
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,840
LUXURY, AND ABOVE ALL, STRENGTH.

506
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,340
DO YOU KNOW OF DR. FREUD, MR. ISMAY?

507
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,340
HIS IDEAS ABOUT THE MALE PREOCCUPATION WITH SIZE

508
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,340
MIGHT BE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO YOU.

509
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,970
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

510
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,460
EXCUSE ME.

511
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,470
I DO APOLOGIZE.

512
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,470
SHE'S A PISTOL, CAL.

513
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,470
HOPE YOU CAN HANDLE HER.

514
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,470
WELL, I MAY HAVE TO START MINDING

515
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,990
WHAT SHE READS FROM NOW ON, WON'T I, MRS. BROWN?

516
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
FREUD-- WHO IS HE?

517
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,480
IS HE A PASSENGER?

518
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,990
...MAKES THESE WAVES, MAKES THEM SPIN.

519
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,750
Fabrizio: THE SHIP IS NICE, HUH?

520
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,380
YEAH, IT'S AN IRISH SHIP.

521
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,000
IS ENGLISH, NO?

522
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
NO, IT WAS BUILT IN IRELAND.

523
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
15,000 IRISHMEN BUILT THIS SHIP.

524
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
SOLID AS A ROCK.

525
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
BIG IRISH HANDS.

526
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,010
THAT'S TYPICAL.

527
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,520
FIRST-CLASS DOGS COME DOWN HERE TO TAKE A SHIT.

528
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,010
UH... IT LETS US KNOW

529
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,390
WHERE WE RANK IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS.

530
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,010
LIKE WE COULD FORGET?

531
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,030
I'M TOMMY RYAN.

532
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,020
JACK DAWSON.

533
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,520
HELLO.

534
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
FABRIZIO.

535
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,150
HI. DO YOU MAKE ANY MONEY

536
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,030
WITH YOUR DRAWINGS?

537
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,430
OH, FORGET IT, BOYO.

538
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,920
YOU'D AS LIKE HAVE ANGELS FLY OUT OF YOUR ARSE

539
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,290
AS GET NEXT TO THE LIKES OF HER.

540
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
DO YOU MIND?

541
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,820
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD OF THIS.

542
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:38,820
I SAW MY WHOLE LIFE AS IF I'D ALREADY LIVED IT--

543
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,820
AN ENDLESS PARADE OF PARTIES AND COTILLIONS

544
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,820
YACHTS AND POLO MATCHES

545
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:50,330
ALWAYS THE SAME NARROW PEOPLE, THE SAME MINDLESS CHATTER.

546
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:54,830
I FELT LIKE I WAS STANDING AT A GREAT PRECIPICE

547
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,830
WITH NO ONE TO PULL ME BACK

548
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,730
NO ONE WHO CARED OR EVEN NOTICED.

549
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,580
DON'T DO IT.

550
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:57,100
STAY BACK.

551
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,590
DON'T COME ANY CLOSER.

552
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,590
COME ON.

553
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,460
JUST GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

554
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,960
I'LL PULL YOU BACK OVER.

555
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,960
NO! STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

556
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,460
I MEAN IT.

557
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,980
I'LL LET GO.

558
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,980
NO, YOU WON'T.

559
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,480
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NO, I WON'T?

560
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,480
DON'T PRESUME TO TELL ME WHAT I WILL AND WILL NOT DO.

561
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,000
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

562
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,120
WELL, YOU WOULD HAVE DONE IT ALREADY.

563
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,620
YOU'RE DISTRACTING ME.

564
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,620
GO AWAY.

565
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,120
I CAN'T.

566
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,490
I'M INVOLVED NOW.

567
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,010
YOU LET GO

568
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO JUMP IN THERE AFTER YOU.

569
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,500
DON'T BE ABSURD.

570
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,650
YOU'LL BE KILLED.

571
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,140
I'M A GOOD SWIMMER.

572
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,140
THE FALL ALONE WOULD KILL YOU.

573
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,140
IT WOULD HURT.

574
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,140
I'M NOT SAYING IT WOULDN'T.

575
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,140
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH

576
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,760
I'M A LOT MORE CONCERNED

577
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,260
ABOUT THAT WATER BEING SO COLD.

578
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,770
HOW COLD?

579
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,270
FREEZING.

580
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,290
MAYBE A COUPLE DEGREES OVER.

581
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,780
YOU EVER, UH...

582
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,280
EVER BEEN TO WISCONSIN?

583
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,290
WHAT?

584
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,790
WELL, THEY HAVE SOME OF THE COLDEST WINTERS AROUND.

585
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:26,790
I GREW UP THERE NEAR CHIPPEWA FALLS.

586
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,810
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A KID

587
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,300
ME AND MY FATHER, WE WENT ICE FISHING

588
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,800
OUT ON LAKE WISSOTA.

589
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,800
ICE FISHING IS, YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU...

590
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,300
I KNOW WHAT ICE FISHING IS!

591
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,320
SORRY.

592
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:45,810
YOU JUST SEEM LIKE, YOU KNOW, KIND OF AN INDOOR GIRL.

593
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,820
ANYWAY, I, UH...

594
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,320
I FELL THROUGH SOME THIN ICE

595
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,820
AND I'M TELLING YOU...

596
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,820
WATER THAT COLD, LIKE RIGHT DOWN THERE

597
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,340
IT HITS YOU LIKE A THOUSAND KNIVES

598
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,330
STABBING YOU ALL OVER YOUR BODY.

599
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:05,330
YOU CAN'T BREATHE

600
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,830
YOU CAN'T THINK--

601
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:10,220
AT LEAST NOT ABOUT ANYTHING BUT THE PAIN.

602
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,220
WHICH IS WHY I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD

603
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,240
TO JUMPING IN THERE AFTER YOU.

604
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,230
LIKE I SAID...

605
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,730
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

606
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,240
I GUESS I'M KIND OF HOPING

607
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,740
YOU'LL COME BACK OVER THE RAIL AND GET ME OFF THE HOOK HERE.

608
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,240
YOU'RE CRAZY.

609
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,250
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS, BUT...

610
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,750
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, MISS

611
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,370
I'M NOT THE ONE HANGING OFF THE BACK OF A SHIP HERE.

612
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,370
COME ON.

613
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:47,370
COME ON, GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

614
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,890
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

615
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,640
WHEW!

616
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,640
I'M JACK DAWSON.

617
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,650
ROSE DEWITT BUKATER.

618
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,150
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET YOU

619
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,650
TO WRITE THAT ONE DOWN.

620
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,150
COME ON.

621
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,660
I GOT YOU!

622
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,660
COME ON.

623
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
COME ON!

624
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,300
HELP! PLEASE!

625
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,800
HELP! PLEASE!

626
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,670
PLEASE GET ME!

627
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,170
LISTEN... LISTEN TO ME.

628
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,170
I'VE GOT YOU... I WON'T LET GO.

629
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,190
NOW PULL YOURSELF UP.

630
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,180
COME ON!

631
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,180
COME ON.

632
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,930
THAT'S RIGHT.

633
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,430
YOU CAN DO IT.

634
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,570
I GOT YOU.

635
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,950
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

636
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,950
YOU STAND BACK!

637
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,970
AND DON'T MOVE AN INCH!

638
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,960
FETCH THE MASTER-AT-ARMS!

639
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,840
CARE FOR A BRANDY?

640
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,360
Cal: THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!

641
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,850
WHAT MADE YOU THINK

642
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,220
THAT YOU COULD PUT YOUR HANDS ON MY FIANCEE?

643
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,720
LOOK AT ME, YOU FILTH!

644
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
CAL...

645
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING?

646
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,860
CAL, STOP.

647
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,360
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

648
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,360
AN ACCIDENT?

649
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,360
IT WAS.

650
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,360
STUPID REALLY.

651
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:37,880
I WAS LEANING OVER, AND I SLIPPED.

652
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:43,870
I WAS LEANING FAR OVER TO SEE THE, UH...

653
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,370
UH... UH...

654
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,390
THE, UH... UH...

655
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,880
PROPELLERS?

656
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,880
PROPELLERS, AND I SLIPPED.

657
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,880
AND I WOULD HAVE GONE OVERBOARD

658
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,880
BUT MR. DAWSON HERE SAVED ME

659
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,380
AND ALMOST WENT OVER HIMSELF.

660
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:56,900
Cal: YOU WANTED TO SEE...

661
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:57,890
SHE WANTED TO SEE THE PROPELLERS.

662
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,390
LIKE I SAID

663
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,390
WOMEN AND MACHINERY DO NOT MIX.

664
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,390
WAS THAT THE WAY OF IT?

665
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,900
YEAH... YEAH, THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH IT.

666
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,400
WELL, THE BOY'S A HERO THEN.

667
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,400
GOOD FOR YOU, SON.

668
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,900
WELL DONE.

669
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,900
SO IT'S ALL'S WELL

670
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:16,920
AND BACK TO OUR BRANDY, EH?

671
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:18,410
LOOK AT YOU.

672
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:19,910
YOU MUST BE FREEZING.

673
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,410
LET'S GET YOU INSIDE.

674
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:24,410
PERHAPS A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR THE BOY.

675
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,420
OF COURSE.

676
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,920
MR. LOVEJOY, I THINK A 20 SHOULD DO IT.

677
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,920
IS THAT THE GOING RATE

678
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,920
FOR SAVING THE WOMAN YOU LOVE?

679
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,930
ROSE IS DISPLEASED.

680
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,430
WHAT TO DO?

681
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,930
I KNOW.

682
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,950
PERHAPS YOU COULD JOIN US FOR DINNER TOMORROW EVENING

683
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,690
TO REGALE OUR GROUP

684
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,190
WITH... YOUR HEROIC TALE.

685
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,710
SURE, COUNT ME IN.

686
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:57,810
GOOD.

687
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,830
SETTLED THEN.

688
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,320
THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

689
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,320
MMM.

690
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,330
CAN I, UH...

691
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,330
BUM A SMOKE?

692
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,840
YOU'LL WANT TO TIE THOSE.

693
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,730
IT'S INTERESTING.

694
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,230
THE YOUNG LADY SLIPS SO SUDDENLY

695
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,730
AND YOU STILL HAD TIME

696
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,230
TO REMOVE YOUR JACKET AND YOUR SHOES.

697
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:52,750
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN MELANCHOLY.

698
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,750
I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW WHY.

699
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,760
I INTENDED TO SAVE THIS

700
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,760
UNTIL THE ENGAGEMENT GALA

701
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,260
NEXT WEEK.

702
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:10,280
BUT I THOUGHT TONIGHT.

703
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,270
GOOD GRACIOUS.

704
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,270
PERHAPS AS A REMINDER

705
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,270
OF MY FEELINGS FOR YOU.

706
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,790
IS IT A...?

707
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,030
DIAMOND? YES.

708
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:23,530
56 CARATS TO BE EXACT.

709
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,540
IT WAS WORN BY LOUIS XVI

710
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:31,540
AND THEY CALLED IT "LE COEUR DE LA MER."

711
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,040
Both: THE HEART OF THE OCEAN.

712
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,540
YES.

713
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,050
IT'S OVERWHELMING.

714
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,050
WELL, IT'S FOR ROYALTY.

715
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,070
WE ARE ROYALTY, ROSE.

716
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,060
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING I COULDN'T GIVE YOU.

717
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:58,080
THERE'S NOTHING I'D DENY YOU

718
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:00,070
IF YOU WOULD NOT DENY ME.

719
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,080
NOW OPEN YOUR HEART TO ME, ROSE.

720
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,090
Jack: WELL, I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN SINCE I WAS 15

721
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,090
SINCE MY FOLKS DIED.

722
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,430
AND I HAD NO BROTHERS OR SISTERS

723
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,930
OR CLOSE KIN IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY.

724
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,430
SO I LIT ON OUT OF THERE

725
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,450
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN BACK SINCE.

726
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,940
YOU COULD JUST CALL ME

727
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,940
A TUMBLEWEED BLOWING IN THE WIND.

728
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,440
WELL, ROSE...

729
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:42,960
WE'VE WALKED ABOUT A MILE

730
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:43,950
AROUND THIS BOAT DECK

731
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:46,450
AND CHEWED OVER HOW GREAT THE WEATHER'S BEEN

732
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,950
AND HOW I GREW UP

733
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,950
BUT I RECKON THAT'S NOT WHY YOU CAME TO TALK TO ME, IS IT?

734
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,470
MR. DAWSON, I...

735
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,960
JACK.

736
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,460
JACK...

737
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,960
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID.

738
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,470
NOT JUST FOR... FOR PULLING ME BACK

739
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:05,470
BUT FOR YOUR DISCRETION.

740
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,340
YOU'RE WELCOME.

741
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:12,340
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT YOU MUST BE THINKING.

742
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,840
POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL.

743
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,350
WHAT DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT MISERY?

744
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:17,850
NO.

745
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,850
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS THINKING.

746
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,350
WHAT I WAS THINKING WAS

747
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,850
WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO THIS GIRL

748
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,360
TO MAKE HER THINK SHE HAD NO WAY OUT?

749
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,860
WELL, I...

750
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,360
IT WAS EVERYTHING.

751
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,360
IT WAS MY WHOLE WORLD

752
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,250
AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN IT

753
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,250
AND THE INERTIA OF MY LIFE

754
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,750
PLUNGING AHEAD

755
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,750
AND ME, POWERLESS TO STOP IT.

756
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,770
GOD! LOOK AT THAT THING.

757
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,260
YOU WOULD HAVE GONE STRAIGHT TO THE BOTTOM.

758
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,260
500 INVITATIONS HAVE GONE OUT.

759
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,770
ALL OF PHILADELPHIA SOCIETY WILL BE THERE

760
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:56,270
AND ALL THE WHILE I FEEL I'M...

761
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,270
STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CROWDED ROOM

762
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:59,770
SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS

763
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,640
AND NO ONE EVEN LOOKS UP.

764
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,280
DO YOU LOVE HIM?

765
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,780
PARDON ME?

766
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,780
DO YOU LOVE HIM?

767
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,780
YOU'RE BEING VERY RUDE.

768
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,030
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ASKING ME THIS.

769
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,050
WELL, IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION.

770
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,040
DO YOU LOVE THE GUY OR NOT?

771
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,540
THIS IS NOT A SUITABLE CONVERSATION.

772
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,040
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION?

773
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,550
THIS IS ABSURD.

774
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,050
YOU DON'T KNOW ME, AND I DON'T KNOW YOU

775
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,550
AND WE ARE NOT HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AT ALL.

776
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:32,550
YOU ARE RUDE AND UNCOUTH AND PRESUMPTUOUS

777
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,320
AND I AM LEAVING NOW.

778
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,810
JACK... MR. DAWSON, IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.

779
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,310
I SOUGHT YOU OUT TO THANK YOU

780
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,310
AND NOW I HAVE THANKED YOU...

781
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,310
AND YOU'VE INSULTED ME.

782
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,830
WELL, YOU DESERVED IT.

783
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,820
RIGHT.

784
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,820
RIGHT.

785
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,190
I THOUGHT YOU WERE LEAVING.

786
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,690
I AM.

787
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:54,190
YOU ARE SO ANNOYING.

788
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,090
WAIT.

789
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,580
I DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE.

790
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,580
THIS IS MY PART OF THE SHIP.

791
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,080
YOU LEAVE.

792
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,090
OH-HO-HO, WELL, WELL, WELL.

793
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:05,090
NOW WHO'S BEING RUDE?

794
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:11,590
WHAT IS THIS STUPID THING YOU'RE CARRYING AROUND?

795
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,110
SO WHAT ARE YOU, AN ARTIST OR SOMETHING?

796
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,600
WELL, THESE ARE RATHER GOOD.

797
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,610
THEY'RE, UH...

798
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:27,610
THEY'RE VERY GOOD ACTUALLY.

799
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:36,370
JACK, THIS IS EXQUISITE WORK.

800
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:39,620
THEY DIDN'T THINK TOO MUCH OF THEM IN OLD PAREE.

801
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,370
PARIS!

802
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,250
YOU DO GET AROUND FOR A POOR...

803
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,250
WELL, UH, UH, A PERSON OF LIMITED MEANS.

804
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,890
GO ON, A POOR GUY, YOU CAN SAY IT.

805
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,770
WELL, WELL, WELL.

806
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,510
AND THESE WERE DRAWN FROM LIFE?

807
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,020
WELL, THAT'S ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT PARIS--

808
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,020
LOTS OF GIRLS WILLING TO TAKE THEIR CLOTHES OFF.

809
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,030
YOU LIKED THIS WOMAN.

810
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:22,780
YOU USED HER SEVERAL TIMES.

811
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,540
WELL, SHE HAD BEAUTIFUL HANDS, YOU SEE?

812
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,040
I THINK YOU MUST HAVE HAD A LOVE AFFAIR WITH HER.

813
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,040
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

814
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,040
JUST WITH HER HANDS.

815
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:37,050
SHE WAS A ONE-LEGGED PROSTITUTE.

816
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,550
SEE?

817
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:44,050
OH!

818
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,070
AH, SHE HAD A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR, THOUGH.

819
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,310
OH, AND THIS LADY...

820
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:55,810
SHE USED TO SIT AT THIS BAR EVERY NIGHT

821
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,320
WEARING EVERY PIECE OF JEWELRY SHE OWNED

822
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,320
JUST WAITING FOR HER LONG-LOST LOVE.

823
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,070
CALLED HER MADAME BIJOU.

824
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:07,580
SEE HOW HER CLOTHES ARE ALL MOTH-EATEN?

825
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,580
WELL, YOU HAVE A GIFT, JACK.

826
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:12,580
YOU DO.

827
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,080
YOU SEE PEOPLE.

828
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,340
I SEE YOU.

829
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,340
AND?

830
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,720
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE JUMPED.

831
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,480
BUT THE PURPOSE OF UNIVERSITY

832
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,980
IS TO FIND A SUITABLE HUSBAND.

833
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,990
ROSE HAS ALREADY DONE THAT.

834
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:35,490
LOOK, HERE COMES THAT VULGAR BROWN WOMAN.

835
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:38,990
QUICKLY, GET UP BEFORE SHE SITS WITH US.

836
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,490
HELLO, GIRLS.

837
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,990
I WAS HOPING I'D CATCH YOU AT TEA.

838
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,010
WE'RE AWFULLY SORRY YOU MISSED IT.

839
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
THE COUNTESS AND I WERE JUST OFF

840
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,500
TO TAKE THE AIR ON THE BOAT DECK.

841
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,000
WHAT A LOVELY IDEA.

842
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I NEED TO CATCH UP ON MY GOSSIP.

843
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,510
Molly: COUNTESS.

844
00:52:56,510 --> 00:53:00,010
SO YOU'VE NOT YET LIT THE LAST FOUR BOILERS?

845
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,010
NO, I DON'T SEE THE NEED.

846
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,530
WE ARE MAKING EXCELLENT TIME.

847
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,020
THE PRESS KNOWS THE SIZE OF TITANIC.

848
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,020
NOW I WANT THEM TO MARVEL AT HER SPEED.

849
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,020
WE MUST GIVE THEM SOMETHING NEW TO PRINT.

850
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:18,030
THIS MAIDEN VOYAGE OF TITANIC MUST MAKE HEADLINES.

851
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,530
MR. ISMAY...

852
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,530
I WOULD PREFER NOT TO PUSH THE ENGINES

853
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,550
UNTIL THEY'VE BEEN PROPERLY RUN IN.

854
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,040
OF COURSE I'M JUST A PASSENGER.

855
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,040
I LEAVE IT TO YOUR GOOD OFFICES

856
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,540
TO DECIDE WHAT'S BEST.

857
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,040
BUT WHAT A GLORIOUS END TO YOUR FINAL CROSSING

858
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:35,060
IF WE WERE TO GET INTO NEW YORK ON TUESDAY NIGHT

859
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,550
AND SURPRISE THEM ALL.

860
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,170
MAKE THE MORNING PAPERS.

861
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:40,920
RETIRE WITH A BANG, EH, E.J.?

862
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,430
GOOD MAN.

863
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:47,790
WELL, AFTER THAT

864
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,300
I WORKED ON A SQUID BOAT IN MONTEREY.

865
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,300
THEN I WENT DOWN TO LOS ANGELES

866
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,800
TO THE PIER IN SANTA MONICA

867
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,800
AND STARTED DOING PORTRAITS THERE

868
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,300
FOR TEN CENTS APIECE.

869
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,940
WHY CAN'T I BE LIKE YOU, JACK--

870
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,440
JUST HEAD OUT FOR THE HORIZON

871
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:03,190
WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE IT?

872
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:07,200
SAY WE'LL GO THERE SOMETIME TO THAT PIER

873
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,700
EVEN IF WE ONLY EVER JUST TALK ABOUT IT.

874
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,450
NO, WE'LL DO IT.

875
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,950
WE'LL DRINK CHEAP BEER.

876
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:16,070
WE'LL RIDE ON THE ROLLER COASTER TILL WE THROW UP.

877
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:18,070
THEN WE'LL RIDE HORSES ON THE BEACH

878
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:19,570
RIGHT IN THE SURF.

879
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,090
NOW, BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO DO IT

880
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,580
LIKE A REAL COWBOY.

881
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,330
NONE OF THAT SIDESADDLE STUFF.

882
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,330
YOU MEAN, ONE LEG ON EACH SIDE?

883
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:27,830
YEAH.

884
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,330
CAN YOU SHOW ME?

885
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,590
SURE... IF YOU LIKE.

886
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:34,590
TEACH ME TO RIDE LIKE A MAN.

887
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:36,340
AND CHEW TOBACCO LIKE A MAN.

888
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,850
AND SPIT LIKE A MAN.

889
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:41,730
THEY DIDN'T TEACH YOU THAT IN FINISHING SCHOOL?

890
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,600
NO.

891
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,730
WELL, COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU.

892
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,240
LET'S DO IT.

893
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,240
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW-- COME ON.

894
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,740
JACK, NO! JACK, NO!

895
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,740
WAIT, JACK.

896
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,740
NO, JACK.

897
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,740
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY, JACK.

898
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,740
WATCH CLOSELY.

899
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,250
THAT'S DISGUSTING!

900
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,750
ALL RIGHT, YOUR TURN.

901
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,250
THAT WAS PITIFUL!

902
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,760
COME ON, YOU REALLY GOT TO HAWK IT BACK, YOU KNOW?

903
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,760
GET SOME LEVERAGE TO IT.

904
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,260
USE YOUR ARMS, ARC YOUR NECK.

905
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,760
SEE THE RANGE ON THAT THING?

906
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,130
MM-HMM.

907
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,130
Jack: OKAY, GO.

908
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:19,630
THAT WAS BETTER-- YOU GOT TO WORK ON IT.

909
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,150
REALLY?

910
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,140
REALLY TRY AND HAWK IT UP

911
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,640
AND GET SOME BODY TO IT, YOU KNOW?

912
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,640
YOU GOT TO...

913
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,030
MOTHER.

914
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:40,540
MAY I INTRODUCE JACK DAWSON?

915
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:43,290
CHARMED, I'M SURE.

916
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,420
THE OTHERS WERE GRACIOUS AND CURIOUS

917
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,420
ABOUT THE MAN WHO HAD SAVED MY LIFE

918
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:56,920
BUT MY MOTHER LOOKED AT HIM LIKE AN INSECT--

919
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,430
A DANGEROUS INSECT WHICH MUST BE SQUASHED QUICKLY.

920
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:04,430
WELL, JACK, SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE A GOOD MAN TO HAVE AROUND

921
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:06,060
IN A STICKY SPOT.

922
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,450
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS INSIST ON ANNOUNCING DINNER

923
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,940
LIKE A DAMN CAVALRY CHARGE?

924
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,820
SHALL WE GO DRESS, MOTHER?

925
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,340
SEE YOU AT DINNER, JACK.

926
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:20,950
UH, SON?

927
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,700
SON!

928
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,200
DO YOU HAVE THE SLIGHTEST COMPREHENSION WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

929
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,200
NOT REALLY.

930
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,710
WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO INTO THE SNAKEPIT.

931
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:34,590
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO WEAR?

932
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,600
I FIGURED.

933
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,600
COME ON.

934
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,100
I WAS RIGHT.

935
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,100
YOU AND MY SON ARE JUST ABOUT THE SAME SIZE.

936
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:47,620
PRETTY CLOSE.

937
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:54,610
YOU SHINE UP LIKE A NEW PENNY.

938
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,540
GOOD EVENING, SIR.

939
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,710
GOOD EVENING.

940
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,220
Man: HELLO.

941
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,360
Cal: DO YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE

942
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,360
SEVERAL THOUSAND TONS OF HOCKLEY STEEL

943
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,230
IN THIS VERY SHIP?

944
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:16,730
Ruth: HMM... WHICH PART?

945
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,230
Cal: ALL THE RIGHT ONES, OF COURSE.

946
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:20,370
THEN WE'LL KNOW WHO TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE IF THERE'S A PROBLEM.

947
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:22,370
WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER? OH, SHE'LL BE ALONG.

948
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,870
THERE IS THE COUNTESS.

949
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:25,870
HELLO, MY DEAR. GOOD EVENING, CAL.

950
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,870
Cal: SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

951
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:55,270
I SAW THAT IN A NICKELODEON ONCE

952
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,400
AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IT.

953
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,430
Ruth: I'LL SEE YOU AT DINNER.

954
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,920
DARLING?

955
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,920
SURELY YOU REMEMBER MR. DAWSON.

956
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,920
DAWSON?

957
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,940
WELL, IT'S AMAZING.

958
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:22,930
YOU COULD ALMOST PASS FOR A GENTLEMAN.

959
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,430
ALMOST.

960
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,930
EXTRAORDINARY.

961
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,450
Ruth: MY DEAR, IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO SEE YOU.

962
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,450
WHAT A REMARKABLE VOYAGE THIS IS.

963
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:43,950
IT'S MAD, ISN'T IT?

964
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,450
Ruth: I LOVE YOUR PERFUME.

965
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,950
THERE'S THE COUNTESS OF ROTHES.

966
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:53,470
AND, UM... THAT'S JOHN JACOB ASTOR--

967
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,960
THE RICHEST MAN ON THE SHIP.

968
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,460
HIS LITTLE WIFEY THERE, MADELEINE, IS MY AGE

969
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,460
AND IN A DELICATE CONDITION.

970
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:02,230
SEE HOW SHE'S TRYING TO HIDE IT?

971
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:03,720
QUITE THE SCANDAL.

972
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,720
HMM.

973
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,220
AND THAT'S BENJAMIN GUGGENHEIM

974
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,720
AND HIS MISTRESS MADAME AUBERT.

975
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,740
MRS. GUGGENHEIM IS AT HOME

976
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:12,730
WITH THE CHILDREN, OF COURSE.

977
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,230
AND OVER HERE WE HAVE

978
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:16,230
SIR COSMO AND LUCILLE LADY DUFF-GORDON.

979
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:19,100
SHE DESIGNS NAUGHTY LINGERIE, AMONG HER MANY TALENTS.

980
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,600
VERY POPULAR WITH THE ROYALS.

981
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,600
CONGRATULATIONS, HOCKLEY.

982
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:23,620
SHE'S SPLENDID.

983
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:25,610
WHY, THANK YOU.

984
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:27,610
CARE TO ESCORT A LADY TO DINNER?

985
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:28,610
CERTAINLY.

986
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:32,110
SWEET PEA?

987
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,630
Cal: SWEET PEA.

988
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,120
AIN'T NOTHIN' TO IT, IS THERE, JACK?

989
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,620
REMEMBER, THEY LOVE MONEY

990
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,620
SO JUST PRETEND LIKE YOU OWN A GOLD MINE

991
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,120
AND YOU'RE IN THE CLUB.

992
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:44,140
HEY, ASTOR!

993
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:46,130
WELL, HELLO, MOLLY.

994
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,630
NICE TO SEE YOU.

995
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:48,630
J.J., MADELEINE

996
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:50,630
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET JACK DAWSON.

997
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:51,630
HOW DO YOU DO?

998
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:52,630
PLEASURE.

999
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,650
HELLO, JACK.

1000
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,890
ARE YOU OF THE BOSTON DAWSONS?

1001
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:59,390
NO-- THE CHIPPEWA FALLS DAWSONS, ACTUALLY.

1002
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:01,390
OH, YES... YES.

1003
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:07,410
HE MUST HAVE BEEN NERVOUS, BUT HE NEVER FALTERED.

1004
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,900
THEY ASSUMED HE WAS ONE OF THEM--

1005
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:13,410
HEIR TO A RAILROAD FORTUNE, PERHAPS.

1006
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:18,410
NEW MONEY, OBVIOUSLY, BUT STILL A MEMBER OF THE CLUB.

1007
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:21,910
MOTHER, OF COURSE, COULD ALWAYS BE COUNTED UPON.

1008
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,310
TELL US OF THE ACCOMMODATIONS IN STEERAGE, MR. DAWSON.

1009
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,300
I HEAR THEY'RE QUITE GOOD ON THIS SHIP.

1010
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:30,310
THE BEST I'VE SEEN, MA'AM.

1011
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,310
HARDLY ANY RATS.

1012
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:36,430
MR. DAWSON IS JOINING US

1013
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:37,930
FROM THE THIRD CLASS.

1014
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:39,430
HE WAS OF SOME ASSISTANCE

1015
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:40,930
TO MY FIANCEE LAST NIGHT.

1016
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:42,430
IT TURNS OUT THAT MR. DAWSON

1017
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:43,950
IS QUITE A FINE ARTIST.

1018
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,440
HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO SHOW ME

1019
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,940
SOME OF HIS WORK TODAY.

1020
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:48,440
ROSE AND I DIFFER SOMEWHAT

1021
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,940
IN OUR DEFINITION OF FINE ART.

1022
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,940
NOT TO IMPUGN YOUR WORK, SIR.

1023
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:59,450
Ismay: SHE MAY BE MINE ON PAPER

1024
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:02,450
BUT IN THE EYES OF GOD, SHE BELONGS TO THOMAS ANDREWS.

1025
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,850
ARE THESE ALL FOR ME?

1026
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,840
JUST START FROM THE OUTSIDE

1027
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,840
AND WORK YOUR WAY IN.

1028
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,840
HE KNOWS EVERY RIVET IN HER, DON'T YOU, THOMAS?

1029
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,340
Andrews: INDEED.

1030
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,860
YOUR SHIP IS A WONDER, MR. ANDREWS, TRULY.

1031
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:12,850
THANK YOU, ROSE.

1032
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:17,350
AND HOW DO YOU TAKE YOUR CAVIAR, SIR?

1033
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:19,350
NO CAVIAR FOR ME, THANKS.

1034
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,870
NEVER DID LIKE IT MUCH.

1035
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:25,360
AND WHERE, EXACTLY, DO YOU LIVE, MR. DAWSON?

1036
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,360
WELL, RIGHT NOW, MY ADDRESS IS THE R.M.S. TITANIC.

1037
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,870
AFTER THAT, I'M ON GOD'S GOOD HUMOR.

1038
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:33,370
AND HOW IS IT YOU HAVE MEANS TO TRAVEL?

1039
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,870
I WORK MY WAY FROM PLACE TO PLACE--

1040
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:37,870
YOU KNOW, TRAMP STEAMERS AND SUCH.

1041
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:40,380
BUT I WON MY TICKET ON TITANIC HERE

1042
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,630
AT A LUCKY HAND AT POKER.

1043
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:44,500
A VERY LUCKY HAND.

1044
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,000
ALL LIFE IS A GAME OF LUCK.

1045
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
MMM.

1046
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,000
A REAL MAN MAKES HIS OWN LUCK, ARCHIE.

1047
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
RIGHT, DAWSON?

1048
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,500
MMM.

1049
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:55,520
AND YOU FIND THAT SORT OF ROOTLESS EXISTENCE

1050
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,510
APPEALING, DO YOU?

1051
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:01,510
WELL, YES, MA'AM, I DO.

1052
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:03,770
I MEAN...

1053
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:05,770
GOT EVERYTHING I NEED RIGHT HERE WITH ME.

1054
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:08,270
GOT AIR IN MY LUNGS AND A FEW BLANK SHEETS OF PAPER.

1055
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:10,270
I MEAN, I LOVE WAKING UP IN THE MORNING

1056
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:12,770
NOT KNOWING WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

1057
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,290
OR WHO I'M GOING TO MEET, WHERE I'M GOING TO WIND UP.

1058
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,280
JUST THE OTHER NIGHT, I WAS SLEEPING UNDER A BRIDGE

1059
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,780
AND NOW HERE I AM ON THE GRANDEST SHIP IN THE WORLD

1060
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,280
HAVING CHAMPAGNE WITH YOU FINE PEOPLE.

1061
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:24,800
I'LL TAKE SOME MORE OF THAT.

1062
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:26,670
I FIGURE LIFE'S A GIFT

1063
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:29,170
AND I DON'T INTEND ON WASTING IT.

1064
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:33,690
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT HAND YOU'RE GOING TO GET DEALT NEXT.

1065
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,680
YOU LEARN TO TAKE LIFE AS IT COMES AT YOU--

1066
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:36,180
HERE YOU GO, CAL.

1067
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,190
TO MAKE EACH DAY COUNT.

1068
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,190
WELL SAID, JACK.

1069
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,440
HEAR, HEAR!

1070
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,310
TO MAKING IT COUNT.

1071
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:48,810
All: TO MAKING IT COUNT.

1072
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:50,810
Archie: BRAVO.

1073
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:00,820
MR. BROWN HAD NO IDEA I'D HIDDEN THE MONEY IN THE STOVE.

1074
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:04,840
SO HE COMES HOME DRUNK AS A PIG, CELEBRATING

1075
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:06,830
AND HE LIGHTS A FIRE.

1076
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:12,330
NEXT IT'LL BE BRANDIES IN THE SMOKING ROOM.

1077
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,350
Archie: WELL...

1078
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:16,840
JOIN ME IN A BRANDY, GENTLEMEN?

1079
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:20,090
NOW THEY RETREAT INTO A CLOUD OF SMOKE

1080
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:23,090
AND CONGRATULATE EACH OTHER ON BEING MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE.

1081
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:25,110
LADIES, THANK YOU FOR THE PLEASURE OF YOUR COMPANY.

1082
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,230
ROSE, MAY I ESCORT YOU BACK TO THE CABIN?

1083
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:29,230
NO, I'LL STAY HERE.

1084
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,250
HERE YOU GO, MOLLY.

1085
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,240
Archie: JOINING US, DAWSON?

1086
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,740
YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY OUT HERE

1087
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:36,740
WITH THE WOMEN, DO YOU?

1088
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,740
NO, THANKS. I'VE GOT TO BE HEADING BACK.

1089
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:39,750
AH.

1090
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:40,620
PROBABLY BEST.

1091
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,610
IT'LL BE ALL BUSINESS AND POLITICS

1092
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:43,630
THAT SORT OF THING--

1093
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:44,620
WOULDN'T INTEREST YOU.

1094
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:47,120
BUT DAWSON...

1095
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,620
GOOD OF YOU TO COME.

1096
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:55,630
JACK, MUST YOU GO?

1097
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:58,130
TIME FOR ME TO GO ROW WITH THE OTHER SLAVES.

1098
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,630
GOOD NIGHT, ROSE.

1099
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:45,920
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO A REAL PARTY?

1100
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,240
IS OKAY I PUT MY HAND HERE.

1101
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,610
OKAY.

1102
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,620
TALLA FRIKKEN SVENSKA?

1103
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:14,620
WHAT?

1104
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:19,630
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

1105
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:45,900
HEY...!

1106
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:46,910
BRAVO, BRAVO!

1107
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:48,910
THANK YOU.

1108
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:49,910
COME ON, GUYS, LET'S GO!

1109
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:50,910
HO!

1110
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:54,410
I'M GOING TO DANCE WITH HER NOW, ALL RIGHT?

1111
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,410
COME ON.

1112
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:56,800
WHAT?

1113
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:57,920
COME WITH ME.

1114
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:59,050
WHAT? JACK...

1115
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:00,050
JACK, WAIT!

1116
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,560
I CAN'T DO THIS.

1117
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:05,920
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET A LITTLE BIT CLOSER.

1118
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:07,320
LIKE THIS.

1119
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:12,430
YOU'RE STILL MY BEST GIRL, CORA.

1120
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:16,930
I DON'T KNOW THE STEPS.

1121
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,440
NEITHER DO I.

1122
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:19,440
JUST GO WITH IT.

1123
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,440
DON'T THINK.

1124
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:23,940
HEY.

1125
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:40,590
WAIT, JACK, JACK!

1126
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,710
WAIT! STOP, JACK!

1127
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,220
BA-BA-BA.

1128
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:53,600
Rose: WAIT!

1129
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:55,120
HEY... HEY!

1130
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:34,260
Jack: YEAH!

1131
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:36,260
JACK... NO!

1132
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:38,780
WHAAA...

1133
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:44,270
...JURISDICTION OF THE SHERMAN ACT

1134
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:46,270
SO MY LAWYERS WILL ARGUE.

1135
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,290
THAT'S WHAT ROCKEFELLER SAID

1136
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:49,780
BUT THE SUPREME COURT IS NOT SWALLOWING IT.

1137
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,800
WHAT?

1138
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,300
YOU THINK A FIRST-CLASS GIRL CAN'T DRINK?

1139
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:17,320
GET OUT OF HERE.

1140
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:18,310
YOU ALL RIGHT?

1141
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:21,810
I'M FINE.

1142
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:25,310
TWO OUT OF THREE, TWO OUT OF THREE.

1143
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:26,950
SO...

1144
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:29,950
YOU THINK YOU'RE BIG, TOUGH MEN?

1145
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,820
LET'S SEE YOU DO THIS.

1146
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:36,320
HOLD THIS FOR ME, JACK.

1147
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:37,840
HOLD IT UP.

1148
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:52,970
OW!

1149
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,480
JESUS, MARY AND JOSEPH!

1150
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,980
YOU ALL RIGHT?

1151
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:59,850
I HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN YEARS.

1152
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,360
GO SEE MAGGIE, LADS.

1153
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,360
GIVE HER THE HOLLEY! LET'S GO!

1154
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:11,860
Musicians: HO!

1155
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:37,470
COFFEE, SIR?

1156
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:49,480
I HAD HOPED YOU WOULD COME TO ME LAST NIGHT.

1157
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,990
I WAS TIRED.

1158
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:58,490
YOUR EXERTIONS BELOW DECKS WERE NO DOUBT EXHAUSTING.

1159
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:04,000
I SEE YOU HAD THAT UNDERTAKER OF A MANSERVANT FOLLOW ME.

1160
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
HOW TYPICAL.

1161
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
YOU WILL NEVER BEHAVE LIKE THAT AGAIN, ROSE.

1162
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,500
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

1163
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:15,010
I'M NOT A FOREMAN IN ONE OF YOUR MILLS THAT YOU CAN COMMAND.

1164
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:18,010
I'M YOUR FIANCEE.

1165
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,510
MY FIANCEE?

1166
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:21,510
MY FIANCEE?!!

1167
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:24,770
YES, YOU ARE, AND MY WIFE!

1168
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,400
MY WIFE IN PRACTICE IF NOT YET BY LAW

1169
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,020
SO YOU WILL HONOR ME.

1170
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:32,020
YOU WILL HONOR ME THE WAY A WIFE IS REQUIRED

1171
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,020
TO HONOR A HUSBAND

1172
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:35,540
BECAUSE I WILL NOT BE MADE OUT A FOOL, ROSE.

1173
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:39,030
IS THIS IN ANY WAY UNCLEAR?

1174
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:40,030
NO.

1175
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:42,030
GOOD.

1176
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:43,030
EXCUSE ME.

1177
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,170
MISS ROSE!

1178
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,680
WE HAD A LITTLE... ACCIDENT.

1179
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,180
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MISS ROSE.

1180
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,180
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

1181
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:56,180
I'M SORRY, TRUDY.

1182
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,180
LET ME HELP YOU.

1183
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,180
IT'S ALL RIGHT, MISS.

1184
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:07,440
IT'S ALL RIGHT, MISS.

1185
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:13,450
TEA, TRUDY.

1186
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:15,450
YES, MA'AM.

1187
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:33,970
YOU'RE NOT TO SEE THAT BOY AGAIN

1188
01:12:33,970 --> 01:12:35,970
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

1189
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:38,970
ROSE, I FORBID IT.

1190
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:40,470
OH, STOP IT, MOTHER.

1191
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,490
YOU'LL GIVE YOURSELF A NOSEBLEED.

1192
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,480
THIS IS NOT A GAME.

1193
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,980
OUR SITUATION IS PRECARIOUS.

1194
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,480
YOU KNOW THE MONEY'S GONE.

1195
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:51,350
OF COURSE I KNOW IT'S GONE.

1196
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:53,350
YOU REMIND ME EVERY DAY.

1197
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,870
YOUR FATHER LEFT US

1198
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:57,360
NOTHING BUT A LEGACY OF BAD DEBTS

1199
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,360
HIDDEN BY A GOOD NAME.

1200
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,860
THAT NAME IS THE ONLY CARD WE HAVE TO PLAY.

1201
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,870
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

1202
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:07,870
IT IS A FINE MATCH WITH HOCKLEY.

1203
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:10,370
IT WILL ENSURE OUR SURVIVAL.

1204
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:11,870
HOW CAN YOU PUT THIS ON MY SHOULDERS?

1205
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:13,870
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO SELFISH?

1206
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:16,390
I'M BEING SELFISH?

1207
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:24,390
DO YOU WANT TO SEE ME WORKING AS A SEAMSTRESS?

1208
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:27,390
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

1209
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:32,890
TO SEE OUR FINE THINGS SOLD AT AUCTION?

1210
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:35,410
OUR MEMORIES SCATTERED TO THE WINDS?

1211
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:48,410
IT'S SO UNFAIR.

1212
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:52,410
OF COURSE IT'S UNFAIR.

1213
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:54,420
WE'RE WOMEN.

1214
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:58,920
OUR CHOICES ARE NEVER EASY.

1215
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:06,930

NO, I'M AFRAID I DON'T.

1232

1238
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,400
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY. PLEASE, I JUST...

1239
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,650

EXCUSE ME, SIR.

1254
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:10,950
ANOTHER ICE WARNING.

01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:19,560
QUITE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

1259
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:21,810
IN FACT, WE'RE SPEEDING UP.

1260
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:22,810
I'VE JUST ORDERED

1261
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,830
THE LAST BOILERS LIT.

1262
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,070
Man: OKAY, SON, WIND IT UP TIGHT

1263
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:31,570
LIKE I SHOWED YOU.

1264
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:34,210
OKAY, NOW, LET IT GO.

1265
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:37,460
WAS GOOD, WASN'T IT?

1266
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,460
QUITE NICE.

1267
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,460
THAT'S EXCELLENT, SON.

1268
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:47,600
Rose: MR. ANDREWS, FORGIVE ME...

1269
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:50,590
I DID THE SUM IN MY HEAD

1270
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:52,090
AND WITH THE NUMBER OF LIFEBOATS

1271
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:54,090
TIMES THE CAPACITY YOU MENTIONED

1272
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:57,110
FORGIVE ME, BUT IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH

1273
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,100
FOR EVERYONE ABOARD.

1274
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,600
ABOUT HALF, ACTUALLY.

1275
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,100
ROSE, YOU MISS NOTHING, DO YOU?

1276
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:06,120
IN FACT, I PUT IN THESE NEW TYPE DAVITS

1277
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:09,110
WHICH CAN TAKE AN EXTRA ROW OF BOATS INSIDE THIS ONE

1278
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:10,610
BUT IT WAS THOUGHT BY SOME

1279
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:13,610
THAT THE DECK WOULD LOOK TOO CLUTTERED

1280
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:16,630
SO I WAS OVERRULED.

1281
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:18,370
WASTE OF DECK SPACE AS IT IS

1282
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:19,870
ON AN UNSINKABLE SHIP.

1283
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:21,370
SLEEP SOUNDLY, YOUNG ROSE.

1284
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,370
I HAVE BUILT YOU A GOOD SHIP

1285
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:24,890
STRONG AND TRUE.

1286
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,380
SHE'S ALL THE LIFEBOAT YOU NEED.

1287
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:27,880
JUST KEEP HEADING AFT.

1288
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,880
THE NEXT STOP WILL BE THE ENGINE ROOM.

1289
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:31,380
COME ON.

1290
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:37,390
JACK, THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

1291
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:39,390
I CAN'T SEE YOU.

1292
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:40,890
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

1293
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:43,890
NO, JACK, NO.

1294
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:46,910
JACK, I'M ENGAGED.

1295
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,900
I'M MARRYING CAL.

1296
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,400
I LOVE CAL.

1297
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:55,920
ROSE, YOU'RE NO PICNIC.

1298
01:17:55,910 --> 01:18:00,410
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE A SPOILED LITTLE BRAT, EVEN

1299
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:04,920
BUT UNDER THAT YOU'RE THE MOST AMAZINGLY ASTOUNDING

1300
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,420
WONDERFUL GIRL-- WOMAN--

1301
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:09,420
THAT I'VE EVER KNOWN AND...

1302
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:10,420
JACK, I...

1303
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:12,670
NO, LET ME TRY AND GET THIS OUT.

1304
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:14,680
YOU'RE, YOU'RE AMA...

1305
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,180
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

1306
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:19,180
I KNOW HOW THE WORLD WORKS.

1307
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:21,180
I'VE GOT TEN BUCKS IN MY POCKET.

1308
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:24,180
I HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER YOU AND I KNOW THAT.

1309
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:26,700
I UNDERSTAND.

1310
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:28,690
BUT I'M TOO INVOLVED NOW.

1311
01:18:28,690 --> 01:18:30,190
YOU JUMP, I JUMP, REMEMBER?

1312
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:32,190
I CAN'T TURN AWAY

1313
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:34,700
WITHOUT KNOWING YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

1314
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,200
THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT.

1315
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,200
WELL, I'M FINE.

1316
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:43,700
I'LL BE FINE, REALLY.

1317
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:45,720
REALLY?

1318
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:49,710
I DON'T THINK SO.

1319
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:50,960
THEY'VE GOT YOU TRAPPED, ROSE

1320
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,460
AND YOU'RE GOING TO DIE IF YOU DON'T BREAK FREE--

1321
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:54,480
MAYBE NOT RIGHT AWAY

1322
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:57,350
BECAUSE YOU'RE STRONG, BUT...

1323
01:18:57,850 --> 01:19:01,360
SOONER OR LATER THAT FIRE THAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU, ROSE...

1324
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,860
THAT FIRE IS GOING TO BURN OUT.

1325
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:10,980
IT'S NOT UP TO YOU TO SAVE ME, JACK.

1326
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:15,500
YOU'RE RIGHT.

1327
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:17,490
ONLY YOU CAN DO THAT.

1328
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,010
I'M GOING BACK.

1329
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,500
LEAVE ME ALONE.

1330
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:39,510
Countess: TELL LUCILLE ABOUT THE DISASTER YOU HAD

1331
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:41,010
WITH THE STATIONER'S.

1332
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:44,010
WELL, OF COURSE, THE INVITATIONS HAD TO BE SENT BACK TWICE.

1333
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,520
OH, MY DEAR!

1334
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,520
AND THE DREADFUL BRIDESMAIDS' GOWNS--

1335
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,020
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT AN ODYSSEY THAT HAS BEEN.

1336
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:53,020
ROSE DECIDED SHE WANTED LAVENDER.

1337
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:55,040
SHE KNOWS I DETEST THE COLOR

1338
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:56,530
SO SHE DID IT ONLY TO SPITE ME.

1339
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:59,030
Lucille: IF ONLY YOU'D COME TO ME SOONER.

1340
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:00,530
RUTH SAW SOME OF MY DESIGNS

1341
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:02,030
IN "LA MODE ILLUSTREE."

1342
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:03,030
THEY WERE FOR THE TROUSSEAU

1343
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,050
OF THE DUCHESS OF MALBOROUGH'S YOUNGEST DAUGHTER.

1344
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,040
THEY WERE QUITE CHARMING

1345
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,540
BUT I THINK YOU'LL AGREE, MY DEAR

1346
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:08,540
THAT TOGETHER WE'VE CREATED

1347
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:11,290
SOMETHING OF A PHOENIX FROM THE ASHES.

1348
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:27,860
HELLO, JACK.

1349
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:35,480
I CHANGED MY MIND.

1350
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:41,490
THEY SAID YOU MIGHT BE...

1351
01:20:41,490 --> 01:20:42,620
SHH...

1352
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,740
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

1353
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,400
NOW CLOSE YOUR EYES.

1354
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:58,390
GO ON.

1355
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:03,390
STEP UP.

1356
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,400
NOW HOLD ON TO THE RAILING.

1357
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,400
KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED, DON'T PEEK.

1358
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,400
I'M NOT.

1359
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,910
STEP UP ONTO THE RAIL.

1360
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:19,910
HOLD ON...

1361
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:20,910
HOLD ON.

1362
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:22,280
KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED.

1363
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,280
DO YOU TRUST ME?

1364
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,780
I TRUST YOU.

1365
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:37,930
ALL RIGHT...

1366
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:39,930
OPEN YOUR EYES.

1367
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:47,690
I'M FLYING!

1368
01:21:47,690 --> 01:21:50,190
JACK!

1369
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:18,590
♪ COME, JOSEPHINE, MY FLYING MACHINE ♪

1370
01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:23,590
♪ GOING UP, SHE GOES, UP, SHE GOES... ♪

1371
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:13,140
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME TITANIC EVER SAW DAYLIGHT.

1372
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:17,640
SO WE'RE UP TO DUSK THE NIGHT OF THE SINKING.

1373
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:19,160
SIX HOURS TO GO.

1374
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:20,150
INCREDIBLE.

1375
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:22,150
THERE'S SMITH AND HE'S STANDING THERE

1376
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:23,650
AND HE'S GOT THE ICEBERG WARNING

1377
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:25,650
IN HIS FUCKING HAND-- EXCUSE ME-- HIS HAND

1378
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:27,150
AND HE'S ORDERING MORE SPEED.

1379
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,670
26 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING AGAINST HIM.

1380
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:32,660
HE FIGURES ANYTHING BIG ENOUGH TO SINK THE SHIP

1381
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:35,160
THEY'RE GOING TO SEE IN TIME TO TURN

1382
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:38,670
BUT THE SHIP'S TOO BIG WITH TOO SMALL A RUDDER.

1383
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:40,670
DOESN'T CORNER WORTH A DAMN.

1384
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:43,670
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS IS WRONG.

1385
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:58,190
IT'S QUITE PROPER, I ASSURE YOU.

1386
01:23:58,190 --> 01:24:01,190
THIS IS THE SITTING ROOM.

1387
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:02,690
WILL THIS LIGHT DO?

1388
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:03,690
WHAT?

1389
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:05,690
DON'T ARTISTS NEED GOOD LIGHT?

1390
01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:09,200
THAT IS TRUE, BUT I'M NOT USED TO WORKING

1391
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,700
IN SUCH HORRIBLE CONDITIONS.

1392
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,700
MONET!

1393
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,200
DO YOU KNOW HIS WORK?

1394
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,700
OF COURSE.

1395
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,470
LOOK AT HIS USE OF COLOR HERE.

1396
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:19,460
ISN'T HE GREAT?

1397
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:20,960
I KNOW, IT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

1398
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:27,180
CAL INSISTS ON CARTING THIS HIDEOUS THING EVERYWHERE.

1399
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:30,680
SHOULD WE BE EXPECTING HIM ANYTIME SOON?

1400
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:34,700
NOT AS LONG AS THE CIGARS AND BRANDY HOLD OUT.

1401
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,060
THAT'S NICE.

1402
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:41,060
WHAT IS IT, A SAPPHIRE?

1403
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:45,070
A DIAMOND, A VERY RARE DIAMOND.

1404
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:49,570
JACK, I WANT YOU TO DRAW ME

1405
01:24:49,570 --> 01:24:52,070
LIKE ONE OF YOUR FRENCH GIRLS...

1406
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:53,570
WEARING THIS.

1407
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,090
ALL RIGHT.

1408
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:59,080
WEARING ONLY THIS.

1409
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,580
THE LAST THING I NEED IS ANOTHER PICTURE OF ME

1410
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:38,080
LOOKING LIKE A PORCELAIN DOLL.

1411
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:43,340
AS A PAYING CUSTOMER...

1412
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,850
I EXPECT TO GET WHAT I WANT.

1413
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,870
OVER ON THE BED... THE COUCH.

1414
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:19,000
GO... LIE DOWN.

1415
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,500
TELL ME WHEN IT LOOKS RIGHT.

1416
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:26,500
PUT YOUR ARM BACK THE WAY IT WAS.

1417
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,000
RIGHT.

1418
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,140
PUT THAT OTHER ARM UP, THAT HAND RIGHT BY YOUR FACE THERE.

1419
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,260
RIGHT.

1420
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:37,760
NOW, HEAD DOWN...

1421
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,770
EYES TO ME, KEEP THEM ON ME.

1422
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:45,150
AND TRY TO STAY STILL.

1423
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:05,790
SO SERIOUS.

1424
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:52,090
I BELIEVE YOU ARE BLUSHING, MR. BIG ARTISTE.

1425
01:27:55,090 --> 01:27:58,590
I CAN'T IMAGINE MONSIEUR MONET BLUSHING.

1426
01:27:58,590 --> 01:28:01,090
HE DOES LANDSCAPES.

1427
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,110
JUST RELAX YOUR FACE.

1428
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:04,600
SORRY.

1429
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:05,600
NO LAUGHING.

1430
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:40,100
MY HEART WAS POUNDING THE WHOLE TIME.

1431
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:44,470
IT WAS THE MOST EROTIC MOMENT OF MY LIFE.

1432
01:28:47,730 --> 01:28:50,240
UP UNTIL THEN, AT LEAST.

1433
01:28:50,230 --> 01:28:52,230
SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

1434
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:56,230
YOU MEAN, DID WE DO IT?

1435
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,750
SORRY, TO DISAPPOINT YOU, MR. BODINE.

1436
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:03,620
JACK WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL.

1437
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:13,130
THANK YOU.

1438
01:29:21,010 --> 01:29:22,510
WHAT YOU DOING?

1439
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:25,010
WILL YOU PUT THIS BACK IN THE SAFE FOR ME?

1440
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:27,010
MM-HMM.

1441
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:40,040
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

1442
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:44,030
NONE OF THE STEWARDS HAVE SEEN HER.

1443
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:45,030
THIS IS ABSURD.

1444
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:50,040
IT'S A SHIP, THERE'S ONLY SO MANY PLACES SHE COULD BE.

1445
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,290
LOVEJOY, FIND HER.

1446
01:30:09,190 --> 01:30:10,190
CLEAR.

1447
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:12,190
YES.

1448
01:30:12,190 --> 01:30:15,700
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN SUCH A FLAT CALM.

1449
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:17,200
LIKE A MILL POND.

1450
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,200
NOT A BREATH OF WIND.

1451
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:24,200
IT WILL MAKE THE BERGS HARDER TO SEE

1452
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:28,720
WITH NO BREAKING WATER AT THE BASE.

1453
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:30,710
HMM.

1454
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,220
WELL, I'M OFF.

1455
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:41,220
MAINTAIN SPEED AND HEADING

1456
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:42,220
MR. LIGHTOLLER.

1457
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:44,220
YES, SIR.

1458
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:56,490
IT'S GETTING COLD.

1459
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:57,490
YOU LOOK NICE.

1460
01:30:58,490 --> 01:30:59,990
Lovejoy: MISS ROSE?

1461
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:01,990
MY DRAWINGS!

1462
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:29,020
COME ON!

1463
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:33,640
NO, WAIT, WAIT! WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

1464
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,640
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

1465
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:36,640
GO, GO!

1466
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:37,640
DOWN, DOWN!

1467
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:39,660
Rose: QUICKLY, QUICKLY!

1468
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:45,900
BYE!

1469
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:54,290
SORRY!

1470
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:02,170
IT'S ALL RIGHT!

1471
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:14,680
PRETTY TOUGH FOR A VALET, THIS FELLOW.

1472
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,180
SEEMS MORE LIKE A COP.

1473
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:17,680
I THINK HE WAS.

1474
01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:18,950
Jack: OH, SHIT.

1475
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:26,840
NO, OVER HERE!

1476
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:27,830
QUICK!

1477
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:35,950
NOW WHAT?!

1478
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:37,950
WHAT?!

1479
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:45,960
HOLD UP!

1480
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:46,960
WHAT'RE YOU TWO DOING DOWN HERE?

1481
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:48,980
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOWN HERE!

1482
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:50,220
IT COULD BE DANGEROUS!

1483
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:55,220
Jack: CARRY ON!

1484
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:58,220
DON'T MIND US, YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB!

1485
01:32:58,230 --> 01:32:59,740
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!

1486
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:18,130
AH, LOOK WHAT WE HAVE HERE, HUH?

1487
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:37,650
THANK YOU.

1488
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:51,660
WHERE TO, MISS?

1489
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:54,160
TO THE STARS.

1490
01:34:12,930 --> 01:34:14,930
YOU NERVOUS?

1491
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:18,440
NO.

1492
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:37,470
PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME, JACK.

1493
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:02,480
Crewman: GOD, IT'S BLOODY COLD.

1494
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:05,990
YOU KNOW, I CAN SMELL ICE, YOU KNOW...

1495
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:07,490
WHEN IT'S NEAR.

1496
01:35:07,490 --> 01:35:08,990
BOLLOCKS.

1497
01:35:09,490 --> 01:35:10,990
BUT I CAN, ALL RIGHT!

1498
01:35:11,490 --> 01:35:12,990
Murdoch: DID YOU EVER FIND THOSE BINOCULARS

1499
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:14,490
FOR THE LOOKOUTS?

1500
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,010
HAVEN'T SEEN THEM SINCE SOUTHAMPTON.

1501
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,000
WELL, I'LL BE ON MY ROUNDS.

1502
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
CHEERIO.

1503
01:35:50,530 --> 01:35:53,030
YOU'RE TREMBLING.

1504
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:58,540
DON'T WORRY, I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

1505
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:20,060
THEY RAN DOWN THERE.

1506
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:21,560
RIGHT.

1507
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:31,820
Lovejoy: ANYTHING MISSING?

1508
01:36:56,850 --> 01:36:59,350
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.

1509
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:12,860
GOTCHA!

1510
01:37:23,290 --> 01:37:25,790
DID YOU SEE THOSE GUYS' FACES?

1511
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:27,790
DID YOU SEE THE...?

1512
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,800
WHEN THE SHIP DOCKS...

1513
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,800
I'M GETTING OFF WITH YOU.

1514
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:40,820
THIS IS CRAZY.

1515
01:37:41,310 --> 01:37:42,310
I KNOW.

1516
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:44,310
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

1517
01:37:45,310 --> 01:37:47,310
THAT'S WHY I TRUST IT.

1518
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:57,440
OH, YES...

1519
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,940
HERE, LOOK AT THIS.

1520
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:00,440
OH, LOOK AT THAT

1521
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:01,940
WOULD YOU?

1522
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:03,460
THEY'RE A BIT WARMER THAN WE ARE.

1523
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:04,950
WELL, IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES

1524
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:06,950
FOR US TO GET WARMER I'D RATHER NOT

1525
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:08,950
IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU.

1526
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:21,630
BUGGER ME!

1527
01:38:26,890 --> 01:38:28,640
PICK UP, YOU BASTARDS.

1528
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:33,640
Is there anyone there?

1529
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:34,640
YES, WHAT DO YOU SEE?

1530
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:36,660
ICEBERG! RIGHT AHEAD!

1531
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:37,650
THANK YOU.

1532
01:38:40,030 --> 01:38:41,030
ICEBERG! RIGHT AHEAD!

1533
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,040
HARD TO STARBOARD!

1534
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,550
Crewman: HARD TO STARBOARD!

1535
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:52,800
Crewman: TURN, TURN! STEADY!

1536
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:58,800
FULL ASTERN!

1537
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:01,810
HARD OVER.

1538
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:03,820
HELM'S HARD OVER, SIR.

1539
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:09,310
GO, LADS! GO!

1540
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:17,820
SHUT ALL THE DAMPERS!

1541
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:19,820
SHUT THEM!

1542
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:24,940
HOLD IT.

1543
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:27,830
HOLD IT!

1544
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:31,200
NOW, ENGAGE THE REVERSING ENGINE!

1545
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:01,360
WHY AREN'T THEY TURNING?!

1546
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:02,380
IS IT HARD OVER?!

1547
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:05,370
Crewman: IT IS, YES, SIR, HARD OVER!

1548
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:12,380
COME ON... COME ON... COME ON...

1549
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:13,880
TURN.

1550
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:25,890
YES...

1551
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:32,910
IT'S GOING TO HIT!

1552
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:45,780
JESUS CHRIST.

1553
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:07,440
JESUS...

1554
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:08,930
HARD TO PORT!

1555
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:10,550
Crewman: HARD TO THE PORT!

1556
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,560
GET BACK!

1557
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,730
COME ON, LET'S GO!

1558
01:41:52,730 --> 01:41:54,230
GET OUT THE DOOR! THEY'RE CLOSING THE DOORS!

1559
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:56,230
GET OUT!

1560
01:41:56,230 --> 01:41:57,230
GET OUT!

1561
01:41:57,230 --> 01:42:01,230
GET OUT! GET OUT!

1562
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:04,110
GET OUT THE DOOR!

1563
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:05,100
GO ON!

1564
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:07,120
GO ON! COME ON, LADS!

1565
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:08,110
GO, LADS, GO!

1566
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:16,380
GET OUT!

1567
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:37,640
: OH, MY GOD...

1568
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:40,640
THAT WAS A CLOSE SHAVE, WEREN'T IT?

1569
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,140
SMELL ICE, CAN YOU?

1570
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:44,140
BLEEDING CHRIST.

1571
01:42:47,650 --> 01:42:50,650
NOTE THE TIME AND ENTER IT IN THE LOG.

1572
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,160
WHAT WAS THAT, MR. MURDOCH?

1573
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:00,660
AN ICEBERG, SIR.

1574
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:02,160
I PUT HER HARD TO STARBOARD

1575
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:03,660
AND RAN THE ENGINES FULL ASTERN

1576
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:05,160
BUT IT WAS TOO CLOSE.

1577
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:08,180
I TRIED TO PORT ROUND IT BUT SHE HIT AND THE...

1578
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:09,170
CLOSE THE WATERTIGHT DOORS.

1579
01:43:09,670 --> 01:43:11,670
Murdoch: THE DOORS ARE CLOSED, SIR.

1580
01:43:14,170 --> 01:43:15,170
ALL STOP.

1581
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:16,690
Crewman: AYE, SIR!

1582
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:24,680
FIND THE CARPENTER.

1583
01:43:24,690 --> 01:43:25,690
GET HIM TO SOUND THE SHIP.

1584
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:27,200
YES, SIR!

1585
01:43:30,690 --> 01:43:33,330
Fabrizio: PORCA PUTTANA!

1586
01:43:33,330 --> 01:43:34,830
CHE CAZZO E?

1587
01:43:37,330 --> 01:43:40,330
COME ON, LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

1588
01:43:40,330 --> 01:43:42,200
COME ON, HURRY UP.

1589
01:43:46,710 --> 01:43:47,710
EXCUSE ME.

1590
01:43:47,710 --> 01:43:49,210
WHY HAVE THE ENGINES STOPPED?

1591
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:50,210
I FELT A SHUDDER.

1592
01:43:50,210 --> 01:43:51,710
I SHOULDN'T WORRY, MADAM.

1593
01:43:51,710 --> 01:43:53,710
WE'VE LIKELY THROWN A PROPELLER BLADE.

1594
01:43:53,710 --> 01:43:55,210
THAT'S THE SHUDDER YOU FELT.

1595
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:56,230
MAY I BRING YOU ANYTHING?

1596
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:57,850
NO, THANK YOU.

1597
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:04,360
Man: DID YOU SEE ANYTHING?

1598
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,860
Man: I DON'T SEE ANYTHING NOW, DO YOU?

1599
01:44:08,730 --> 01:44:10,730
IF THIS IS THE DIRECTION THE RATS ARE GOING

1600
01:44:10,730 --> 01:44:12,230
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

1601
01:44:14,230 --> 01:44:15,730
Crewman: PLEASE, SIR, PLEASE.

1602
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:17,750
EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.

1603
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:20,240
YOU THERE.

1604
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,240
SIR, THERE IS NO EMERGENCY.

1605
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:22,740
YES, THERE IS, I HAVE BEEN ROBBED.

1606
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,240
GET THE MASTER-AT-ARMS.

1607
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:25,740
NOW, YOU MORON!

1608
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:26,760
YES, SIR.

1609
01:44:30,630 --> 01:44:32,640
HEY, YOU'RE GOING TO MISS THE FUN.

1610
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:34,140
DID YOU SEE WHAT HAPPEN?

1611
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:35,640
NO, I MISSED IT.

1612
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,640
APPARENTLY, IT HIT OVER THERE.

1613
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:40,640
Crewman: BOILER ROOM SIX IS FLOODED EIGHT FEET ABOVE THE PLATE

1614
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:41,640
AND THE MAIL HOLD IS WORSE.

1615
01:44:41,650 --> 01:44:43,160
SHE'S ALL BUCKLED IN IN THE FORWARD HOLD.

1616
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:44,150
CAN YOU SHORE UP?

1617
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:45,650
NOT UNLESS THE PUMPS GET AHEAD.

1618
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:48,150
HAVE YOU SEEN THE DAMAGE IN THE MAIL HOLD?

1619
01:44:48,150 --> 01:44:49,650
NO, SHE'S ALREADY UNDERWATER.

1620
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:50,650
THIS IS BAD.

1621
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:54,660
WE SHOULD TELL MOTHER AND CAL.

1622
01:44:56,330 --> 01:44:57,830
I THINK THEY'RE VERY GOOD, SIR.

1623
01:45:00,830 --> 01:45:01,830
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

1624
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:03,830
I WANT THE ENTIRE ROOM PHOTOGRAPHED.

1625
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:06,200
Rose: JUST KEEP HOLDING MY HAND.

1626
01:45:08,210 --> 01:45:11,220
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU, MISS.

1627
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:17,210
Rose: WELL, HERE WE GO.

1628
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:24,600
SOMETHING SERIOUS HAS HAPPENED.

1629
01:45:26,110 --> 01:45:28,110
YES, IT HAS...

1630
01:45:28,110 --> 01:45:32,110
INDEED. TWO THINGS DEAR TO ME HAVE DISAPPEARED THIS EVENING.

1631
01:45:32,610 --> 01:45:33,610
NOW THAT ONE IS BACK

1632
01:45:33,610 --> 01:45:36,120
I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHERE TO FIND THE OTHER.

1633
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:37,120
SEARCH HIM.

1634
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:38,620
TAKE YOUR COAT OFF, SIR.

1635
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:40,120
NOW WHAT? COME ON.

1636
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:41,620
CAL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1637
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:42,620
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE

1638
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:43,620
OF AN EMERGENCY.

1639
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:45,120
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1640
01:45:45,130 --> 01:45:46,140
IS THIS IT? THAT'S IT.

1641
01:45:46,630 --> 01:45:48,630
THIS IS HORSESHIT!

1642
01:45:48,630 --> 01:45:51,130
DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT, ROSE.

1643
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:52,130
DON'T!

1644
01:45:52,130 --> 01:45:53,130
HE COULDN'T HAVE.

1645
01:45:53,130 --> 01:45:54,130
OF COURSE HE COULD.

1646
01:45:54,130 --> 01:45:55,130
IT'S EASY ENOUGH FOR A PROFESSIONAL.

1647
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:56,650
BUT I WAS WITH HIM THE WHOLE TIME.

1648
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:58,140
THIS IS ABSURD.

1649
01:45:58,140 --> 01:45:59,140
PERHAPS HE DID IT

1650
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:01,140
WHILE YOU WERE PUTTING

1651
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:02,640
YOUR CLOTHES BACK ON, DEAR.

1652
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:05,140
REAL SLICK CAL. ROSE, THEY PUT IT IN MY POCKET.

1653
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:06,160
SHUT UP.

1654
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:08,150
IT ISN'T EVEN YOUR POCKET, IS IT, SON?

1655
01:46:08,150 --> 01:46:10,020
PROPERTY OF A. L. RYERSON.

1656
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:15,650
THAT WAS REPORTED STOLEN TODAY.

1657
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:16,670
I JUST BORROWED IT.

1658
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:18,160
I WAS GOING TO RETURN IT.

1659
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:20,160
WE HAVE AN HONEST THIEF HERE, DO WE?

1660
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:22,660
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T DO THIS, ROSE.

1661
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:24,660
YOU KNOW IT-- DON'T YOU BELIEVE THEM, ROSE.

1662
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:25,670
YOU KNOW IT.

1663
01:46:25,670 --> 01:46:26,680
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T DO IT.

1664
01:46:26,670 --> 01:46:27,670
COME ON, LET'S GO.

1665
01:46:27,670 --> 01:46:28,670
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T DO IT, ROSE. ROSE!

1666
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:29,670
COME ON, SON.

1667
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:31,170
THERE'S A GOOD LAD.

1668
01:46:31,670 --> 01:46:32,170
COME ON.

1669
01:46:32,670 --> 01:46:33,670
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T DO IT!

1670
01:46:33,670 --> 01:46:35,170
YOU KNOW ME!

1671
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:39,680
Ismay: MOST UNFORTUNATE, CAPTAIN.

1672
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:45,680
WATER... 14 FEET ABOVE THE KEEL IN TEN MINUTES--

1673
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:47,190
IN THE FOREPEAK

1674
01:46:47,190 --> 01:46:49,690
IN ALL THREE HOLDS AND IN BOILEROOM SIX.

1675
01:46:49,810 --> 01:46:50,810
THAT'S RIGHT, SIR.

1676
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:52,310
WHEN CAN WE GET UNDER WAY, DAMN IT?

1677
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:54,310
THAT'S FIVE COMPARTMENTS.

1678
01:46:55,810 --> 01:46:56,810
SHE CAN STAY AFLOAT

1679
01:46:56,810 --> 01:46:59,310
WITH THE FIRST FOUR COMPARTMENTS BREACHED

1680
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:00,830
BUT NOT FIVE.

1681
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:02,820
NOT FIVE.

1682
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:04,820
AS SHE GOES DOWN BY THE HEAD

1683
01:47:04,820 --> 01:47:06,210
THE WATER WILL SPILL

1684
01:47:06,210 --> 01:47:07,710
OVER THE TOPS OF THE BULKHEADS

1685
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:09,210
AT E DECK FROM ONE TO THE NEXT.

1686
01:47:09,210 --> 01:47:10,580
BACK AND BACK.

1687
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:12,080
THERE'S NO STOPPING IT.

1688
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,080
THE PUMPS...

1689
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:14,460
IF WE OPENED THE DOORS...

1690
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:16,970
THE PUMPS BUY YOU TIME, BUT MINUTES ONLY.

1691
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:18,470
FROM THIS MOMENT

1692
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:19,970
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO

1693
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:22,970
TITANIC WILL FOUNDER.

1694
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:27,490
BUT THIS SHIP CAN'T SINK.

1695
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:28,980
SHE'S MADE OF IRON, SIR.

1696
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:30,480
I ASSURE YOU, SHE CAN...

1697
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,980
AND SHE WILL.

1698
01:47:32,980 --> 01:47:35,480
IT IS A MATHEMATICAL CERTAINTY.

1699
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:40,440
HOW MUCH TIME?

1700
01:47:47,450 --> 01:47:48,450
AN HOUR.

1701
01:47:48,450 --> 01:47:50,950
TWO AT MOST.

1702
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:58,460
AND HOW MANY ABOARD, MR. MURDOCH?

1703
01:47:58,460 --> 01:48:01,460
2,200 SOULS ON BOARD, SIR.

1704
01:48:08,470 --> 01:48:12,470
WELL, I BELIEVE YOU MAY GET YOUR HEADLINES, MR. ISMAY.

1705
01:48:29,450 --> 01:48:30,960
OH, IT IS A LITTLE SLUT, ISN'T IT?

1706
01:48:30,950 --> 01:48:33,450
WILL YOU LOOK AT ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU.

1707
01:48:35,450 --> 01:48:35,950
MR. HOCKLEY?

1708
01:48:36,450 --> 01:48:37,450
NOT NOW, WE'RE BUSY.

1709
01:48:37,450 --> 01:48:38,450
SIR, I'VE BEEN TOLD TO ASK YOU

1710
01:48:38,450 --> 01:48:39,950
TO PLEASE PUT ON YOUR LIFEBELTS

1711
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:41,470
AND COME UP TO THE...

1712
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:42,960
I SAID NOT NOW.

1713
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:44,710
I'M SORRY TO INCONVENIENCE YOU, MR. HOCKLEY

1714
01:48:44,710 --> 01:48:46,210
BUT IT'S CAPTAIN'S ORDERS.

1715
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:47,210
NOW, PLEASE, DRESS WARMLY.

1716
01:48:47,210 --> 01:48:49,710
IT'S QUITE COLD OUT TONIGHT.

1717
01:48:49,970 --> 01:48:52,980
NOW, MAY I SUGGEST TOPCOATS AND HATS.

1718
01:48:52,970 --> 01:48:54,470
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

1719
01:48:55,470 --> 01:48:57,470
NOT TO WORRY, MISS.

1720
01:48:57,470 --> 01:48:59,470
I AM SURE IT'S JUST A PRECAUTION.

1721
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:00,610
EVERYBODY UP!

1722
01:49:00,610 --> 01:49:01,610
LIFEBELTS ON!

1723
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,860
WHAT'S HE YELLING ABOUT?

1724
01:49:04,860 --> 01:49:06,860
EVERYBODY UP! PUT YOUR LIFEBELTS ON!

1725
01:49:06,870 --> 01:49:07,880
WHAT'S THE RUCKUS?

1726
01:49:07,870 --> 01:49:08,870
JUST PUT YOU LIFEBELTS ON!

1727
01:49:09,370 --> 01:49:11,370
Crewman: C.Q.D.?

1728
01:49:11,870 --> 01:49:13,870
SIR?

1729
01:49:15,370 --> 01:49:16,490
THAT'S RIGHT-- C.Q.D.

1730
01:49:16,490 --> 01:49:17,490
THE DISTRESS CALL.

1731
01:49:17,490 --> 01:49:18,990
THAT'S OUR POSITION.

1732
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,000
TELL WHOEVER RESPONDS

1733
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
THAT WE'RE GOING DOWN BY THE HEAD.

1734
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
WE NEED IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.

1735
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:40,900
BLIMEY.

1736
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:51,790
KEEP LOWERING!

1737
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:54,280
KEEP LOWERING!

1738
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:14,300
MR. WILDE!

1739
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:16,800
MR. WILDE, WHERE ARE THE PASSENGERS?

1740
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:17,940
WE MOVED THEM BACK INSIDE.

1741
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:19,940
IT'S TOO DAMN COLD AND NOISY FOR THEM.

1742
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:21,440
YOU THERE!

1743
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:24,940
GET DOWN HERE AND HELP WITH THESE LINES.

1744
01:50:39,210 --> 01:50:41,210
CARE FOR A DRINK, SIR?

1745
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:44,580
Crewman: PLEASE PUT YOUR LIFEBELTS ON.

1746
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:45,580
HEY, SONNY, WHAT'S DOING?

1747
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:47,080
YOU GOT US ALL TRUSSED UP HERE

1748
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:48,580
AND NOW WE'RE COOLING OUR HEELS.

1749
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:49,580
SORRY, MA'AM.

1750
01:50:49,590 --> 01:50:50,600
LET ME GO AND FIND OUT.

1751
01:50:51,090 --> 01:50:52,590
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS

1752
01:50:52,590 --> 01:50:54,590
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON AROUND HERE.

1753
01:50:54,590 --> 01:50:56,090
IT'S THE GODDAMNED ENGLISH

1754
01:50:56,090 --> 01:50:58,090
DOING EVERYTHING BY THE... BOOK.

1755
01:50:58,090 --> 01:51:00,600
THERE'S NO NEED FOR LANGUAGE, MR. HOCKLEY.

1756
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:02,600
GO BACK AND TURN THE HEATERS ON IN OUR ROOMS.

1757
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:04,600
I'D LIKE A CUP OF TEA WHEN I RETURN.

1758
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:06,100
YES, MA'AM.

1759
01:51:15,610 --> 01:51:17,110
MR. ANDREWS...

1760
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:20,120
I SAW THE ICEBERG

1761
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:22,880
AND I SEE IT IN YOUR EYES.

1762
01:51:22,870 --> 01:51:24,750
PLEASE TELL ME THE TRUTH.

1763
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:34,760
THE SHIP WILL SINK.

1764
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:36,770
YOU'RE CERTAIN.

1765
01:51:36,770 --> 01:51:39,780
YES, IN AN HOUR OR SO...

1766
01:51:40,270 --> 01:51:41,270
ALL THIS WILL BE

1767
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:43,770
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ATLANTIC.

1768
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:45,770
WHAT?

1769
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:47,790
PLEASE, TELL ONLY WHO YOU MUST.

1770
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:50,280
I DON'T WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A PANIC

1771
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:53,280
AND GET TO A BOAT QUICKLY, DON'T WAIT.

1772
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:54,780
YOU REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU

1773
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:56,280
ABOUT THE BOATS?

1774
01:51:59,290 --> 01:52:00,790
YES...

1775
01:52:02,290 --> 01:52:04,290
I UNDERSTAND.

1776
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,300
OVER HERE, SIR.

1777
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:16,300
SIR, THEY NEED YOU

1778
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:17,320
UP IN THE SECOND-CLASS PURSER'S OFFICE.

1779
01:52:17,310 --> 01:52:18,310
THERE'S A BIG MOB UP THERE.

1780
01:52:18,310 --> 01:52:19,810
GO ON, I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

1781
01:52:20,810 --> 01:52:22,810
AYE, RIGHT.

1782
01:52:36,030 --> 01:52:37,030
SIR!

1783
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:40,540
CARPATHIA SAYS THEY'RE MAKING 17 KNOTS.

1784
01:52:40,530 --> 01:52:43,030
FULL STEAM FOR THEM, SIR.

1785
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:45,030
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO'S RESPONDING?

1786
01:52:45,030 --> 01:52:46,030
THE ONLY ONE CLOSE, SIR.

1787
01:52:46,540 --> 01:52:48,050
SHE SAYS THEY CAN BE HERE IN FOUR HOURS.

1788
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:50,540
FOUR HOURS?

1789
01:52:55,540 --> 01:52:57,550
THANK YOU, BRIDE.

1790
01:53:01,050 --> 01:53:03,050
MY GOD.

1791
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:12,440
SIR!

1792
01:53:12,450 --> 01:53:14,960
WE ARE SWUNG OUT AND READY, SIR.

1793

01:53:29,460 --> 01:53:31,460
YES...

1799
01:53:31,460 --> 01:53:33,970
YES, SIR.

1800
01:53:35,470 --> 01:53:38,970
Crewman: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE!

1801
01:53:38,970 --> 01:53:40,470

FOR THE TIME BEING

1807
01:53:48,230 --> 01:53:51,230
I SHALL REQUIRE ONLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

1808
01:53:51,730 --> 01:53:53,730
Man: RIGHT HERE.

1809
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:55,750
ALL RIGHT, BOYS, LIKE THE CAPTAIN SAID

1810
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:57,740
NICE AND CHEERY SO THERE'S NO PANIC.

1811
01:53:57,740 --> 01:54:00,240

HERE, PUT YOUR LIFEBELT ON.

1816
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:16,370
HERE, COME ON, HERE.

1817
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:24,880
Crewman: IT ISN'T TIME TO GO UP TO THE BOATS YET.

1818
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:26,880
PLEASE STAY CALM.

1819
01:54:27,390 --> 01:54:28,890
LOOK, PLEASE, MAKE SURE EVERYBODY

1820
01:54:28,890 --> 01:54:30,390
YOU'VE GOT YOUR LIFEBELTS ON

1821
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:32,390
AND GENTLEMEN, ALLOW THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN

1822
01:54:32,390 --> 01:54:33,390

1823
01:54:33,390 --> 01:54:35,390
WHAT ARE WE DOING, MOMMY?

1824
01:54:35,390 --> 01:54:36,890
WE'RE JUST WAITING, DEAR.

1825
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:38,410
WHEN THEY'RE FINISHED PUTTING

1826
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,400
THE FIRST-CLASS PEOPLE IN THE BOATS THEY'LL START WITH US

1827
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:42,400
AND WE'LL WANT TO BE ALL READY, WON'T WE?

1828
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:47,040
GO AND GET SOME HELP.

1829
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:48,040
LOWER AWAY!

1830
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:50,040
LEFT AND RIGHT TOGETHER!

1831
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:51,040
STEADY!

1832
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:54,050
BOTH SIDES TOGETHER!

1833
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:55,050
STEADY!

1834
01:54:55,050 --> 01:54:56,300

1835
01:54:56,300 --> 01:54:58,800
STEADY!

1836
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:03,800
HOLD THE LEFT SIDE!

1837
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:04,920
RIGHT SIDE ONLY!

1838
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:06,810
RIGHT SIDE ONLY!

1839
01:55:06,810 --> 01:55:07,810
RIGHT SIDE ONLY!

1840
01:55:08,310 --> 01:55:09,310
HOLD THE LEFT SIDE!

1841
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:10,810
RIGHT SIDE DOWN!

1842
01:55:10,810 --> 01:55:12,310
LOWER AWAY TOGETHER!

1843
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,180
STEADY, LADS!

1844
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:07,200
YOU KNOW, I DO BELIEVE THIS SHIP MAY SINK.

1845
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:10,200
I'VE BEEN ASKED TO GIVE YOU

1846
01:56:10,710 --> 01:56:13,220
THIS SMALL TOKEN OF OUR APPRECIATION.

1847
01:56:15,710 --> 01:56:18,710
COMPLIMENTS OF MR. CALEDON HOCKLEY.

1848
01:56:26,010 --> 01:56:28,520
COME ON, SISTER, YOU HEARD THE MAN-- INTO THE BOAT.

1849
01:56:28,510 --> 01:56:30,510
ANY ROOM FOR A GENTLEMAN, GENTLEMEN?

1850
01:56:30,510 --> 01:56:33,010
Crewman: ONLY WOMEN AT THIS TIME, SIR.

1851
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,510
WILL THE LIFEBOATS BE SEATED

1852
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:38,030
ACCORDING TO CLASS?

1853
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:42,520
I HOPE THEY'RE NOT TOO CROWDED.

1854
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:44,270
OH, MOTHER...

1855
01:56:44,270 --> 01:56:45,270
SHUT UP!

1856
01:56:45,270 --> 01:56:46,270
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

1857
01:56:46,780 --> 01:56:49,290
THE WATER IS FREEZING AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH BOATS.

1858
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,280
NOT ENOUGH BY HALF.

1859
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:54,530
HALF THE PEOPLE ON THIS SHIP ARE GOING TO DIE.

1860
01:56:54,530 --> 01:56:56,030
NOT THE BETTER HALF.

1861
01:56:58,540 --> 01:56:59,540
COME ON, RUTH, GET IN THE BOAT.

1862
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:02,290
FIRST-CLASS SEATS ARE RIGHT UP HERE.

1863
01:57:02,290 --> 01:57:03,670
YOU KNOW, IT'S A PITY

1864
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:04,690
I DIDN'T KEEP THAT DRAWING.

1865
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:06,680
IT'LL BE WORTH A LOT MORE BY MORNING.

1866
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:13,680
YOU UNIMAGINABLE BASTARD.

1867
01:57:13,690 --> 01:57:15,200
Molly: COME ON, ROSE, DARLING.

1868
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:17,190
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR YOU.

1869
01:57:18,190 --> 01:57:19,190
COME ON, ROSE.

1870
01:57:19,190 --> 01:57:20,690
YOU'RE NEXT, DARLING.

1871
01:57:20,690 --> 01:57:22,940
COME INTO THE BOAT, ROSE.

1872
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:25,950
COME.

1873
01:57:25,950 --> 01:57:26,950
ROSE...

1874
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:29,820
GET INTO THE BOAT.

1875
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:31,700
ROSE.

1876
01:57:32,710 --> 01:57:34,720
GOOD-BYE, MOTHER.

1877
01:57:36,210 --> 01:57:37,710
ROSE!

1878
01:57:37,710 --> 01:57:39,210
ROSE, COME BACK HERE!

1879
01:57:39,210 --> 01:57:40,830
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1880
01:57:40,830 --> 01:57:42,330
TO HIM?!

1881
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:44,830
TO BE A WHORE TO A GUTTER RAT?

1882
01:57:45,330 --> 01:57:47,840
I'D RATHER BE HIS WHORE THAN YOUR WIFE.

1883
01:57:50,590 --> 01:57:51,590
NO... NO!

1884
01:57:53,090 --> 01:57:54,090
I SAID NO!

1885
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:57,240
Ruth: ROSE!

1886
01:57:57,230 --> 01:57:58,230
PLEASE STOP!

1887
01:57:58,230 --> 01:58:00,230
Crewman: AND LOWER AWAY!

1888
01:58:00,230 --> 01:58:01,230
ROSE!!

1889
01:58:01,230 --> 01:58:02,230
MAN THE TILLER!

1890
01:58:02,230 --> 01:58:03,230
NO, WAIT!

1891
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:04,750
LOWER AWAY!

1892
01:58:04,740 --> 01:58:05,740
ROSE!

1893
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:07,350
LOWER TOGETHER!

1894
01:58:11,860 --> 01:58:13,610

1895
01:58:14,610 --> 01:58:16,610

01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:19,620

1898
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:25,770

1899
01:58:25,870 --> 01:58:29,880
SOMEBODY HELP ME, PLEASE!

1900
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:30,880
Rose: MR. ANDREWS?

1901
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:35,880
STEWARD, CHECK THE STARBOARD CORRIDOR.

1902
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:36,890
YES, MR. ANDREWS.

1903
01:58:37,390 --> 01:58:38,400
MADAM, PLEASE, PUT ON A LIFEBELT.

1904
01:58:38,390 --> 01:58:39,890
GET TO THE BOAT DECK IMMEDIATELY.

1905
01:58:39,890 --> 01:58:42,390
LUCY, FOR GOD'S SAKE, PUT ON YOUR LIFEBELT.

1906
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:43,390
SET A GOOD EXAMPLE.

1907
01:58:43,390 --> 01:58:44,390
YES, SIR.

1908
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:45,390
ANYONE IN HERE?

1909
01:58:45,390 --> 01:58:46,390
MR. ANDREWS?

1910
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:47,910
MR. ANDREWS, THANK GOD.

1911
01:58:47,900 --> 01:58:50,400
WHERE WOULD THE MASTER- AT-ARMS TAKE SOMEONE UNDER ARREST?

1912
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,900
WHAT? YOU HAVE TO GET TO A BOAT RIGHT AWAY.

1913
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:54,400
NO!

1914
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:56,400
I'M DOING THIS WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR HELP, SIR

1915
01:58:56,410 --> 01:58:57,920
BUT WITHOUT WILL TAKE LONGER.

1916
01:59:00,410 --> 01:59:01,910
TAKE THE ELEVATOR TO THE VERY BOTTOM.

1917
01:59:01,910 --> 01:59:04,410
GO TO THE LEFT DOWN THE CREWMEN'S PASSAGE.

1918
01:59:04,410 --> 01:59:06,910
THEN GO RIGHT AND LEFT AGAIN AT THE STAIRS.

1919
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:08,930
YOU'LL COME TO A LONG CORRIDOR.

1920
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:14,920
THIS COULD BE BAD.

1921
01:59:18,810 --> 01:59:20,310
OH, SHIT.

1922
01:59:20,310 --> 01:59:22,310
OH, SHIT!

1923
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:27,820
EXCUSE ME, THANK YOU.

1924
01:59:27,820 --> 01:59:29,820
Crewman: THE LIFTS ARE CLOSED.

1925
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:31,320
Woman: I DO NOT CARE...

1926
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:32,820
THE LIFTS ARE...

1927
01:59:32,830 --> 01:59:35,340
I'M SORRY, MISS, BUT THE LIFTS ARE CLOSED.

1928
01:59:36,330 --> 01:59:38,330
I'M THROUGH BEING POLITE, GODDAMN IT!

1929
01:59:38,330 --> 01:59:40,330

1966

02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:02,280
PLEASE, HELLO!

1983
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:03,780

1987
02:03:10,290 --> 02:03:11,290
WAIT!

1988
02:03:15,300 --> 02:03:17,800
HELLO?

1989
02:03:42,690 --> 02:03:43,690
HELLO?

1990
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:46,090
AH, MISS, YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE, NOW.

1991
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:47,080
PLEASE, I NEED YOUR HELP.

1992
02:03:47,580 --> 02:03:48,580

1993
02:03:48,580 --> 02:03:50,080
THERE IS A MAN DOWN HERE

1994
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:51,580
AND HE IS TRAPPED. PLEASE.

1995
02:03:51,580 --> 02:03:53,080
THERE'S NO NEED TO PANIC.

1996
02:03:53,090 --> 02:03:54,090
NO, I'M NOT PANICKING.

1997
02:03:54,090 --> 02:03:56,100
YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY!

1998
02:03:56,090 --> 02:03:58,460
LET GO OF ME, LISTEN!

1999
02:04:03,350 --> 02:04:05,110
TO HELL WITH YOU.

2000
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:07,100
OH!

2001
02:04:42,380 --> 02:04:44,380
OH, MY GOD...

2002
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:34,180
JACK!

2003
02:05:34,190 --> 02:05:35,700
ROSE!

2004
02:05:35,690 --> 02:05:37,190
WILL THIS WORK?

2005
02:05:37,190 --> 02:05:39,190
I GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT.

2006
02:05:39,190 --> 02:05:41,190
COME ON.

2007
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:46,210
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

2008
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:48,450
TRY A COUPLE PRACTICE SWINGS OVER THERE.

2009
02:05:53,570 --> 02:05:57,070
GOOD, NOW TRY TO HIT THE SAME MARK AGAIN, ROSE.

2010
02:05:57,080 --> 02:05:58,590
YOU CAN DO IT.

2011
02:06:03,580 --> 02:06:06,080
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH PRACTICE.

2012
02:06:06,590 --> 02:06:08,100
COME ON, ROSE, YOU CAN DO IT.

2013
02:06:08,090 --> 02:06:12,090
LISTEN, JUST HIT IT REALLY HARD AND REALLY FAST.

2014
02:06:13,590 --> 02:06:17,090
WAIT, OPEN YOUR HANDS UP A LITTLE MORE.

2015
02:06:17,100 --> 02:06:18,110
LIKE THAT?

2016
02:06:18,100 --> 02:06:19,100
RIGHT.

2017
02:06:19,100 --> 02:06:22,100
LISTEN, ROSE, I TRUST YOU.

2018
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:28,120

COME ON, LET'S GO.

2021
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:38,630
OH, SHIT, THIS IS COLD.

2022
02:06:38,620 --> 02:06:39,620
OH, SHIT!

2023
02:06:39,620 --> 02:06:41,620
SHIT, SHIT.

2024
02:06:48,260 --> 02:06:49,260
THIS IS THE WAY OUT.

2025
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:50,760
WE HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER WAY.

2026
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:52,380
COME ON.

2027
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:53,380
Tiller: PULL.

2028
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:56,380
PULL.

2029
02:06:56,380 --> 02:06:58,890
PUT YOUR BACKS INTO IT, PULL!

2030
02:07:03,390 --> 02:07:04,890
PULL!

2031
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:07,280
NOW, THERE'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE EVERY DAY.

2032
02:07:07,780 --> 02:07:09,280
PULL!

2033
02:07:30,390 --> 02:07:32,900
Crewman: WHAT'S THIS LUGGAGE DOING HERE?

2034
02:07:32,890 --> 02:07:34,390
GET RID OF IT, WE NEED THE ROOM.

2035
02:07:39,890 --> 02:07:40,890
KEEP CALM.

2036
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:43,010
NO!

2037
02:07:48,020 --> 02:07:49,520
LOVEJOY.

2038
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:51,520
SHE'S NOT ON THE STARBOARD SIDE EITHER.

2039
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:53,020
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME

2040
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:54,520
AND THIS STRUTTING MARTINET

2041
02:07:54,530 --> 02:07:56,040
ISN'T LETTING ANY MEN ON AT ALL.

2042
02:07:56,030 --> 02:07:58,910
THERE'S ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE LETTING MEN ON.

2043
02:07:58,910 --> 02:08:00,410
WELL, THEN, THAT'S OUR PLAY.

2044
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:02,430
WE'LL NEED SOME INSURANCE FIRST.

2045
02:08:02,420 --> 02:08:03,420
COME ON.

2046
02:08:04,790 --> 02:08:05,790
THIS WAY.

2047
02:08:05,790 --> 02:08:06,790
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE.

2048
02:08:09,290 --> 02:08:10,790
Steward: HERE!

2049
02:08:10,790 --> 02:08:12,790
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

2050
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:15,300
YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT, YOU KNOW.

2051
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:17,300
THAT'S WHITE STAR LINE PROPERTY.

2052
02:08:17,300 --> 02:08:18,800
Both: SHUT UP!

2053
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:21,800
WILL YOU HOLD THE BOAT A MOMENT?

2054
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:24,300
I JUST HAVE TO RUN BACK TO MY ROOM...

2055
02:08:24,310 --> 02:08:25,820
SIT DOWN!

2056
02:08:25,810 --> 02:08:26,810
SHE'S THE LAST.

2057
02:08:27,190 --> 02:08:28,190
ALL RIGHT TO LOWER.

2058
02:08:28,190 --> 02:08:29,690
MR. LIGHTOLLER, WHY ARE THE BOATS

2059
02:08:29,690 --> 02:08:31,190
BEING LAUNCHED HALF FULL?

2060
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:32,710
NOT NOW, MR. ANDREWS.

2061
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:34,200
THERE, LOOK, 20 OR SO

2062
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:35,950
IN A BOAT BUILT FOR 65

2063
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:38,320
AND I SAW ONE BOAT WITH ONLY 12-- 12!

2064
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:40,820
WELL, WE WEREN'T SURE OF THE WEIGHT, MR. ANDREWS.

2065
02:08:40,820 --> 02:08:42,320
THESE BOATS MAY BUCKLE.

2066
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:43,820
RUBBISH.

2067
02:08:43,830 --> 02:08:45,220
THEY WERE TESTED IN BELFAST

2068
02:08:45,710 --> 02:08:47,210
WITH THE WEIGHT OF 70 MEN!

2069
02:08:47,210 --> 02:08:48,710
NOW, FILL THESE BOATS, MR. LIGHTOLLER

2070
02:08:48,710 --> 02:08:50,710
FOR GOD'S SAKE, MAN!

2071
02:08:56,470 --> 02:09:00,090
PLEASE, I NEED MORE WOMEN AND CHILDREN, PLEASE.

2072
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:05,610
Crewman: GET BACK IN THERE.

2073
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:06,600
THIS IS NOT AN EXIT.

2074
02:09:07,100 --> 02:09:08,100
GET BACK IN THERE.

2075
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:09,600
THIS IS NOT AN EXIT.

2076
02:09:11,850 --> 02:09:13,350
YOU CAN'T KEEP US LOCKED IN HERE LIKE ANIMALS.

2077
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:15,250
THE SHIP'S BLOODY SINKING!

2078
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:17,740
BRING FORWARD THE WOMEN!

2079
02:09:18,110 --> 02:09:19,110
UNLOCK THE GATES.

2080
02:09:20,610 --> 02:09:22,110
WOMEN ONLY!

2081
02:09:22,110 --> 02:09:24,610

2082
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:32,870

2083
02:09:35,260 --> 02:09:37,260

2084
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:40,260
GET THEM BACK FROM THOSE GATES!

2085
02:09:40,270 --> 02:09:42,280
DON'T TOUCH THE GATES!

2086
02:09:44,770 --> 02:09:48,270
FOR GOD'S SAKE, MAN, THERE ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN DOWN HERE!

2087
02:09:48,270 --> 02:09:50,770
LET US UP SO WE CAN HAVE A CHANCE!

2088
02:09:50,780 --> 02:09:52,790

CAN WE GET OUT?

2092
02:09:58,530 --> 02:09:59,530
IT'S HOPELESS THAT WAY!

2093
02:09:59,530 --> 02:10:00,030
WHATEVER WE DO

2094
02:10:00,030 --> 02:10:01,030
WE'VE GOT TO DO IT FAST.

2095
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:02,550
JACK!

2096
02:10:02,540 --> 02:10:04,540
FABRIZIO!

2097
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:06,040
THE BOATS ARE ALL GONE.

2098
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:07,540
THIS WHOLE PLACE IS FLOODING.

2099
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:09,540
THERE IS NIENTE THIS WAY.

2100
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:11,540
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO THIS WAY, ALL RIGHT?

2101
02:10:11,550 --> 02:10:12,560
COME ON.

2102
02:10:17,550 --> 02:10:19,050

02:10:19,050 --> 02:10:21,550
SO DO I.

2104
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:30,560

2106
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:42,440
THIS WAY.

2107
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:43,440
Steward: JUST GO BACK

2108
02:10:43,450 --> 02:10:44,590
TO THE MAIN STAIRWELL

2109
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:47,080

2110
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:48,580
Man: HELL, IT WILL.

2111
02:10:48,580 --> 02:10:50,580
IT WILL ALL GET SORTED OUT BACK THERE.

2112
02:10:51,090 --> 02:10:52,100
GO BACK TO THE MAIN STAIRWELL.

2113
02:10:52,090 --> 02:10:53,090

02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:01,210

Jack: LET'S GO, ROSE.

2136
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:33,740
YOU CAN'T GO UP THERE.

2137
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:35,260
YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

2138
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:43,640
Lightoller: KEEP ORDER HERE.

2139
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:46,890

2149
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:24,800
Crewman: STAY BACK!

2150
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:26,310
WE'RE TOO LATE.

2151
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:28,300
THERE ARE MORE BOATS DOWN THE FRONT.

2152
02:12:28,300 --> 02:12:30,300
STAY WITH THIS ONE-- MURDOCH.

2153
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:32,300
HE SEEMS TO BE QUITE PRACTICAL.

2154
02:12:46,950 --> 02:12:48,950
Lowe: SIT DOWN!

2155
02:12:49,450 --> 02:12:50,950
STAY BACK, YOU LOT.

2156
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:52,330
STAY BACK!

2157
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:53,710
STAY BACK, THE LOT OF YOU!

2158
02:12:53,710 --> 02:12:54,210
STAY BACK!

2159
02:12:55,710 --> 02:12:58,330
IT'S STARTING TO FALL APART.

2160
02:12:58,330 --> 02:13:00,080
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

2161
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:03,080
MR. MURDOCH?

2162
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:04,080
MR. HOCKLEY...

2163
02:13:04,590 --> 02:13:05,600
YOU TWO, WITH ME, NOW.

2164
02:13:06,090 --> 02:13:07,590
I'M A BUSINESSMAN, AS YOU KNOW

2165
02:13:07,590 --> 02:13:09,590
AND I HAVE A BUSINESS PROPOSITION FOR YOU.

2166
02:13:09,590 --> 02:13:12,590
Crewman: EASY NOW.

2167
02:13:12,590 --> 02:13:13,590
ALL TOGETHER.

2168
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:16,610
LOWER AWAY, LOWER AWAY.

2169
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:18,100
Jack: COME ON, ROSE.

2170
02:13:21,740 --> 02:13:23,250
THE BOATS ARE GONE!

2171
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:29,240
COLONEL, ARE THERE ANY BOATS ON THAT SIDE?

2172
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:32,750
NO, MISS, BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF BOATS ALL THE WAY FORWARD.

2173
02:13:32,750 --> 02:13:34,750
THIS WAY, I'LL LEAD YOU.

2174
02:13:40,250 --> 02:13:41,750
WHAT'S THE USE?

2175
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:43,770
NOBODY'S LISTENING TO US ANYWAY.

2176
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:46,630
WELL, THEY DON'T LISTEN TO US AT DINNER EITHER.

2177
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:48,130
COME ON, LET'S PLAY.

2178
02:13:48,130 --> 02:13:49,630
KEEP US WARM.

2179
02:13:49,630 --> 02:13:51,130
"ORPHEUS."

2180
02:13:55,140 --> 02:13:56,640
MUSIC TO DROWN BY.

2181
02:13:56,640 --> 02:13:58,640
NOW I KNOW I'M IN FIRST CLASS.

2182
02:14:03,650 --> 02:14:04,650
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

2183
02:14:04,650 --> 02:14:07,160
THEY'RE ALL STILL AFT, SIR.

2184
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:11,780
WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING THEN, MR. MURDOCH?

2185
02:14:29,550 --> 02:14:31,550
WOMEN AND CHILDREN ONLY!

2186
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:32,570
GET BACK!

2187
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:34,060
STEP BACK, SIR.

2188
02:14:34,060 --> 02:14:35,060
COME THROUGH, MADAM.

2189
02:14:35,060 --> 02:14:36,060
THIS WAY.

2190
02:14:36,060 --> 02:14:37,060
STEP BACK, SIR.

2191
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:40,060
YOU'D BETTER CHECK THE OTHER SIDE.

2192
02:14:40,060 --> 02:14:41,060
GO!

2193
02:14:43,570 --> 02:14:48,070
Crewman: ANY MORE WOMEN AND CHILDREN?

2194
02:14:48,070 --> 02:14:50,570
I FOUND HER ON THE OTHER SIDE.

2195
02:14:50,830 --> 02:14:52,340
WAITING FOR A BOAT...

2196
02:14:52,830 --> 02:14:54,330
WITH HIM.

2197
02:14:55,830 --> 02:14:56,830
ANY MORE WOMEN AND CHILDREN?

2198
02:14:56,950 --> 02:14:57,950
THEY'RE ALL ABOARD, MR. MURDOCH.

2199
02:14:57,950 --> 02:14:59,950
ANYONE ELSE, THEN?

2200
02:15:00,950 --> 02:15:01,950
ANYONE ELSE?

2201
02:15:01,950 --> 02:15:03,450
HURRY ALONG.

2202
02:15:06,460 --> 02:15:08,460
STAND BY THE FALLS.

2203
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:12,100
OH, GODDAMN IT ALL TO HELL.

2204
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:15,100
SHIT.

2205
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:16,100
FIRE!

2206
02:15:16,100 --> 02:15:17,600
SIR!

2207
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:19,600
SIR, YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH HERE.

2208
02:15:19,600 --> 02:15:21,100
SIR, YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH.

2209
02:15:23,110 --> 02:15:24,610
YES, YES, SPLENDID.

2210
02:15:27,110 --> 02:15:29,110
RIGHT.

2211
02:15:29,110 --> 02:15:31,110
Murdoch: PREPARE TO LOWER!

2212
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:35,620
READY ON THE LEFT.

2213
02:15:41,130 --> 02:15:42,640
TAKE THEM DOWN.

2214
02:15:47,630 --> 02:15:49,130
KEEP IT STEADY.

2215
02:15:51,140 --> 02:15:53,650
BOTH SIDES TOGETHER, STEADY.

2216
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:56,140
KEEP IT STEADY.

2217
02:15:57,180 --> 02:15:58,180
GIVE HER TO ME.

2218
02:15:58,180 --> 02:15:59,690
Girl: DADDY...

2219
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:01,680
Man: IT'LL BE FINE, DARLING.

2220
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:03,180
DON'T YOU WORRY.

2221
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:05,180
IT'S GOOD-BYE FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

2222
02:16:05,180 --> 02:16:06,680
ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

2223
02:16:06,680 --> 02:16:09,190
THERE'LL BE ANOTHER BOAT FOR THE DADDIES.

2224
02:16:09,190 --> 02:16:11,690
THIS BOAT'S FOR THE MUMMIES AND THE CHILDREN.

2225
02:16:12,190 --> 02:16:14,190
YOU HOLD MUMMY'S HAND AND BE A GOOD LITTLE GIRL.

2226
02:16:14,190 --> 02:16:15,690
I'M NOT GOING WITHOUT YOU.

2227
02:16:15,690 --> 02:16:17,190
NO, YOU HAVE TO GO... NOW!

2228
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:18,710
NO, JACK.

2229
02:16:18,700 --> 02:16:20,200
GET IN THE BOAT, ROSE.

2230
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:21,700
NO, JACK.

2231
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:23,330
YES, GET ON THE BOAT.

2232
02:16:23,330 --> 02:16:26,340
YES, GET ON THE BOAT, ROSE.

2233
02:16:28,340 --> 02:16:29,840
MY GOD, LOOK AT YOU.

2234
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:31,340
YOU LOOK A FRIGHT.

2235
02:16:31,340 --> 02:16:33,340
HERE.

2236
02:16:34,850 --> 02:16:35,860
PUT THIS ON.

2237
02:16:36,350 --> 02:16:37,350
COME.

2238
02:16:42,350 --> 02:16:43,850
GO ON, I'LL GET THE NEXT ONE.

2239
02:16:43,860 --> 02:16:45,870
NO, NOT WITHOUT YOU.

2240
02:16:45,860 --> 02:16:47,360
Jack: I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

2241
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:48,360
LISTEN, I'LL BE FINE.

2242
02:16:48,480 --> 02:16:49,490
I'M A SURVIVOR, ALL RIGHT?

2243
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:50,480
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

2244
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:51,480
Jack: NOW GO ON, GET ON.

2245
02:16:51,480 --> 02:16:52,980
I HAVE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH AN OFFICER

2246
02:16:52,980 --> 02:16:54,730
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SHIP.

2247
02:16:54,730 --> 02:16:57,230
JACK AND I CAN GET OFF SAFELY.

2248
02:16:57,240 --> 02:16:58,240
BOTH OF US.

2249
02:16:58,740 --> 02:16:59,740
SEE.

2250
02:16:59,740 --> 02:17:01,240
GOT MY OWN BOAT TO CATCH.

2251
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:02,740
Cal: NOW, HURRY.

2252
02:17:02,740 --> 02:17:04,620
THEY'RE ALMOST FULL.

2253
02:17:05,880 --> 02:17:06,880
STEP ABOARD, MISS.

2254
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:09,380
Cal: COME ON, HURRY.

2255
02:17:09,380 --> 02:17:10,000
STEP ABOARD, PLEASE.

2256
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,500
Man: BE DADDY'S GOOD GIRL.

2257
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:13,000
STEP LIVELY.

2258
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Crewman: KEEP BACK, KEEP BACK, I SAY.

2259
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:18,000
CLEAR THE ROW, PLEASE.

2260
02:17:19,010 --> 02:17:20,510
LOWER AWAY!

2261
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:25,760
Crewman: SLOWLY...

2262
02:17:25,900 --> 02:17:27,900
KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING.

2263
02:17:27,900 --> 02:17:30,900
AND LOWER AWAY EVENLY, LADS.

2264
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:33,900
EASY. LOWER AWAY.

2265
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:35,920
YOU'RE A GOOD LIAR.

2266
02:17:35,910 --> 02:17:37,910
ALMOST AS GOOD AS YOU.

2267
02:17:37,910 --> 02:17:41,410
Crewman: EASY NOW... AND LOWER AWAY.

2268
02:17:42,910 --> 02:17:44,910
THERE'S NO, UH...

2269
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:46,930
THERE'S NO ARRANGEMENT, IS THERE?

2270
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:49,920
NO, THERE IS.

2271
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:52,420
NOT THAT YOU'LL BENEFIT MUCH FROM IT.

2272
02:17:53,930 --> 02:17:55,440
I ALWAYS WIN, JACK...

2273
02:17:56,930 --> 02:17:58,930
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

2274
02:18:01,930 --> 02:18:06,440
Crewman: EASY... EVEN, LADS.

2275
02:18:06,440 --> 02:18:08,940
KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING.

2276
02:18:56,350 --> 02:18:57,350
ROSE!

2277
02:19:00,360 --> 02:19:01,740
STOP HER!

2278
02:19:01,740 --> 02:19:03,860
Jack: ROSE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

2279
02:19:03,860 --> 02:19:04,860
Cal: STOP HER!

2280
02:19:04,860 --> 02:19:06,000
NO!

2281
02:19:24,130 --> 02:19:25,630
ROSE.

2282
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:30,150
YOU'RE SO STUPID.

2283
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:32,140
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

2284
02:19:32,140 --> 02:19:34,140
YOU'RE SO STUPID, ROSE.

2285
02:19:35,140 --> 02:19:37,640
WHY DID YOU DO THAT? WHY?

2286
02:19:37,650 --> 02:19:41,660
YOU JUMP, I JUMP, RIGHT?

2287
02:19:41,650 --> 02:19:42,650
RIGHT.

2288
02:19:44,650 --> 02:19:47,150
OH, GOD, I COULDN'T GO.

2289
02:19:47,150 --> 02:19:50,040
I COULDN'T GO, JACK.

2290
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:51,040
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

2291
02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:52,540
WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

2292
02:19:52,540 --> 02:19:54,540
Rose: AT LEAST I'M WITH YOU.

2293
02:19:54,550 --> 02:19:56,060
WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

2294
02:20:08,060 --> 02:20:09,310
COME ON!

2295
02:20:13,310 --> 02:20:14,810
COME ON, MOVE!

2296
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:22,440
COME ON.

2297
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:31,200
MOVE!

2298
02:20:37,960 --> 02:20:39,970
COME ON, COME ON, ROSE.

2299
02:20:39,960 --> 02:20:40,960
COME ON.

2300
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:42,960
ROSE, COME ON!

2301
02:20:45,850 --> 02:20:46,960
MOVE, ROSE!

2302
02:21:01,230 --> 02:21:04,860
I HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR TIME TOGETHER.

2303
02:21:18,130 --> 02:21:22,130
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE FUNNY?

2304
02:21:22,130 --> 02:21:24,250
I PUT THE DIAMOND IN THE COAT.

2305
02:21:26,250 --> 02:21:28,750
AND I PUT THE COAT ON HER!

2306
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:31,260
COME ON.

2307
02:21:55,580 --> 02:21:56,580
WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM.

2308
02:22:00,340 --> 02:22:01,840
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

2309
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:20,870
GO BACK!

2310
02:22:31,240 --> 02:22:32,240
IT'S THE WRONG WAY!

2311
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:34,130
COME BACK.

2312
02:22:39,880 --> 02:22:41,880
GO!

2313
02:22:59,010 --> 02:23:00,010
JACK!

2314
02:23:00,010 --> 02:23:01,760
ROSE!

2315
02:23:13,780 --> 02:23:15,530
THIS WAY.

2316
02:23:23,790 --> 02:23:25,290

YEA, THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH...

2445
02:36:41,330 --> 02:36:44,340

2450
02:37:40,030 --> 02:37:41,530
HAIL MARY, FULL OF GRACE

02:38:04,300 --> 02:38:06,300
I SAW A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH

2456
02:38:06,300 --> 02:38:09,800
WHEN THE FIRST HEAVEN AND THE FIRST EARTH HAD PASSED AWAY...

2457
02:38:11,310 --> 02:38:13,310
...AND THERE WAS NO MORE SEA.

2458

2462
02:38:30,080 --> 02:38:32,080

THIS IS WHERE WE FIRST MET.

2466
02:38:47,590 --> 02:38:51,100
AND GOD SHALL WIPE AWAY ALL THE TEARS FROM THEIR EYES

2467
02:38:51,100 --> 02:38:53,600
AND THERE SHALL BE NO MORE DEATH.

2468
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:56,350
NEITHER SHALL THERE BE SORROW OR CRYING.

2469
02:38:56,350 --> 02:39:00,360
NEITHER SHALL THERE BE ANY MORE PAIN

2470
02:39:00,360 --> 02:39:03,860
FOR THE FORMER WORLD HAS PASSED AWAY.

2483
02:42:24,930 --> 02:42:26,430
I WON'T LET GO.

2484
02:42:26,430 --> 02:42:27,680
COME ON, I'VE GOT YOU.

2485
02:42:38,690 --> 02:42:39,940
WHAT'S HAPPENING, JACK?

2486
02:42:40,440 --> 02:42:42,440
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW!

2487
02:42:50,950 --> 02:42:51,950
Jack: HOLD ON!

2488
02:42:51,950 --> 02:42:52,950
Rose: JACK!

2489
02:42:52,960 --> 02:42:54,470
THAT WAS CLOSE.

2490
02:42:54,460 --> 02:42:57,840
Man: HELP ME, PLEASE, SOMEONE HELP ME, PLEASE!

2491
02:43:20,730 --> 02:43:23,740
Woman: PLEASE HELP! HELP! HELP! HELP!

2492
02:43:34,250 --> 02:43:36,250
THIS IS IT!

2493
02:43:47,760 --> 02:43:51,260
Rose: OH, GOD, OH, GOD!

2494
02:43:51,260 --> 02:43:52,760
HOLD ON!

2495
02:43:52,770 --> 02:43:55,780
OH, GOD, OH, GOD, OH!

2496
02:44:07,910 --> 02:44:10,420
THE SHIP IS GOING TO SUCK US DOWN.

2497
02:44:10,420 --> 02:44:12,920
TAKE A DEEP BREATH WHEN I SAY.

2498
02:44:17,040 --> 02:44:20,040
KICK FOR THE SURFACE AND KEEP KICKING.

2499
02:44:20,040 --> 02:44:21,430
DO NOT LET GO

2500
02:44:21,430 --> 02:44:23,430
OF MY HAND.

2501
02:44:29,440 --> 02:44:30,450
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT, ROSE.

2502
02:44:30,440 --> 02:44:31,940
TRUST ME.

2503
02:44:32,440 --> 02:44:34,440
I TRUST YOU.

2504
02:44:36,940 --> 02:44:40,450
READY? READY?

02:46:40,850 --> 02:46:43,350
GET ON TOP.

2528
02:46:50,110 --> 02:46:50,610
COME ON, ROSE.

2529
02:47:01,500 --> 02:47:03,000
STAY ON IT, STAY ON, ROSE.

2530
02:47:03,010 --> 02:47:05,020
JACK.

2531
02:47:24,390 --> 02:47:27,400
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW.

2532
02:47:28,900 --> 02:47:31,900
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW.

2533
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:38,910
Crewman: RETURN...

2534
02:47:38,910 --> 02:47:40,910
THE BOATS!

2535
02:47:43,910 --> 02:47:47,420
THE BOATS ARE COMING BACK FOR US, ROSE.

2536
02:47:47,420 --> 02:47:49,420
HOLD ON JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

2537
02:47:49,420 --> 02:47:50,920
Crewman: RETURN THE BOATS!

2538
02:47:50,920 --> 02:47:53,420
THEY... HAD TO ROW AWAY FOR THE SUCTION

2539
02:47:53,420 --> 02:47:54,920
BUT NOW THEY'LL BE COMING BACK.

2540
02:47:54,920 --> 02:47:57,930
Woman: COME BACK!

2541
02:47:57,930 --> 02:47:59,430

2547
02:48:07,440 --> 02:48:08,940
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

2548
02:48:09,440 --> 02:48:12,440
IF WE GO BACK, THEY'LL SWAMP THE BOAT.

2549
02:48:12,940 --> 02:48:13,940
THEY'LL PULL US RIGHT DOWN, I'M TELLING YOU.

2550
02:48:14,440 --> 02:48:17,450
KNOCK IT OFF-- YOU'RE SCARING ME.

2551
02:48:17,450 --> 02:48:20,450
COME ON, GIRLS-- GRAB AN OAR, LET'S GO!

2552
02:48:20,450 --> 02:48:21,450
Man: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

2553
02:48:21,450 --> 02:48:23,450
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC!

2554
02:48:23,450 --> 02:48:24,950
NOW, DO YOU PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE

2555
02:48:24,950 --> 02:48:27,460
OR DO YOU WANT TO DIE?

2556
02:48:33,960 --> 02:48:36,460
I DON'T UNDERSTAND A ONE OF YOU.

2557
02:48:37,970 --> 02:48:39,970
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

2558
02:48:39,970 --> 02:48:41,470
IT'S YOUR MEN OUT THERE!

2559
02:48:44,470 --> 02:48:45,970
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR MORE.

2560
02:48:45,980 --> 02:48:47,490
AND THERE'LL BE ONE LESS ON THIS BOAT

2561
02:48:47,480 --> 02:48:51,480
IF YOU DON'T SHUT THAT HOLE IN YOUR FACE!

2562
02:48:51,480 --> 02:48:54,980
Woman: COME BACK!

2563
02:49:04,990 --> 02:49:06,490
Man: HERE, TAKE THIS ONE.

2564
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,010
Lowe: NOW BRING IN YOUR OARS OVER THERE

2565
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:12,000
AND TIE THESE TWO BOATS TOGETHER AS WELL.

2566
02:49:15,470 --> 02:49:18,470
NOW MAKE SURE THAT'S TIED UP NICE AND TIGHT.

2567
02:49:21,480 --> 02:49:24,480
RIGHT, LISTEN TO ME, MEN, WE HAVE TO GO BACK.

2568
02:49:24,730 --> 02:49:27,230
I WANT TO TRANSFER ALL THE WOMEN FROM THIS BOAT

2569
02:49:27,230 --> 02:49:28,730
INTO THAT BOAT RIGHT NOW

2570
02:49:28,730 --> 02:49:30,230
AS QUICK AS YOU CAN, PLEASE.

2571
02:49:30,240 --> 02:49:31,750
LET'S GET SOME SPACE THERE.

2572
02:49:31,740 --> 02:49:32,740
MOVE FORWARD AND AFT.

2573
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,500
IT'S GETTING QUIET.

2574
02:49:45,620 --> 02:49:49,620
IT'S JUST GOING TO TAKE THEM A COUPLE OF MINUTES

2575
02:49:49,620 --> 02:49:52,120
TO GET THE BOATS ORGANIZED.

2576
02:49:54,630 --> 02:49:56,630
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU

2577
02:49:56,630 --> 02:50:00,130
BUT I INTEND TO WRITE A STRONGLY WORDED LETTER

2578
02:50:00,130 --> 02:50:03,630
TO THE WHITE STAR LINE ABOUT ALL THIS.

2579
02:50:10,140 --> 02:50:12,640
I LOVE YOU, JACK.

2580
02:50:18,650 --> 02:50:21,650
DON'T YOU DO THAT.

2581
02:50:21,650 --> 02:50:24,160
DON'T YOU SAY YOUR GOOD-BYES.

2582
02:50:24,660 --> 02:50:27,160
NOT YET, DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

2583
02:50:27,160 --> 02:50:29,660
I'M SO COLD.

2584
02:50:29,660 --> 02:50:31,660
LISTEN, ROSE...

2585
02:50:31,660 --> 02:50:35,170
YOU'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE.

2586
02:50:35,170 --> 02:50:37,670
YOU'RE GOING TO GO ON

2587
02:50:37,670 --> 02:50:40,670
AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE LOTS OF BABIES

2588
02:50:40,670 --> 02:50:43,670
AND YOU'RE GOING TO WATCH THEM GROW.

2589
02:50:44,180 --> 02:50:48,680
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE AN OLD... AN OLD LADY WARM IN HER BED.

2590
02:50:50,180 --> 02:50:51,180
NOT HERE.

2591
02:50:51,180 --> 02:50:53,680
NOT THIS NIGHT.

2592
02:50:53,690 --> 02:50:54,700
NOT LIKE THIS.

2593
02:50:54,690 --> 02:50:57,690
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

2594
02:50:59,690 --> 02:51:02,190
I CAN'T FEEL MY BODY.

2595
02:51:03,700 --> 02:51:05,710
WINNING THAT TICKET, ROSE

2596
02:51:05,700 --> 02:51:09,200
WAS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

2597
02:51:09,200 --> 02:51:11,200
IT BROUGHT ME TO YOU...

2598
02:51:13,210 --> 02:51:15,220
AND I'M THANKFUL FOR THAT, ROSE.

2599
02:51:15,210 --> 02:51:17,210
I'M THANKFUL.

2600
02:51:18,710 --> 02:51:23,210

YOU MUST DO ME THIS HONOR...

2602
02:51:27,220 --> 02:51:33,220
YOU MUST PROMISE ME THAT YOU'LL SURVIVE...

2603
02:51:33,230 --> 02:51:36,240
THAT YOU WON'T GIVE UP...

2604
02:51:36,230 --> 02:51:38,730
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS...

2605
02:51:40,730 --> 02:51:43,230
NO MATTER HOW HOPELESS.

2606
02:51:46,740 --> 02:51:48,740
PROMISE ME NOW, ROSE...

2607
02:51:50,740 --> 02:51:53,740

2608
02:51:54,750 --> 02:51:56,750
I PROMISE.

2609
02:51:58,250 --> 02:52:00,250
NEVER LET GO.

2610
02:52:02,760 --> 02:52:04,770
I WILL NEVER LET GO, JACK.

2611
02:52:07,760 --> 02:52:10,260
I'LL NEVER LET GO.

2612
02:52:33,290 --> 02:52:35,300
Crewman: RIGHT AHEAD, SIR.

2613
02:52:38,290 --> 02:52:39,790
Lowe: OARS!

2614
02:52:40,290 --> 02:52:42,290
DO YOU SEE ANY MOVING?

2615
02:52:42,290 --> 02:52:44,800
NO, SIR. NONE MOVING, SIR.

2616
02:52:44,800 --> 02:52:46,800

BRING THAT OAR UP HERE.

2618
02:52:53,810 --> 02:52:56,070
CHECK THEM, MAKE SURE.

2619
02:52:57,560 --> 02:52:59,560
THESE ARE DEAD, SIR.

2620
02:52:59,560 --> 02:53:01,060

DON'T HIT THEM.

2624
02:53:14,460 --> 02:53:17,960
IS THERE ANYONE ALIVE OUT THERE?

2625
02:53:17,960 --> 02:53:22,470
CAN ANYONE HEAR ME?

2626

IS THERE ANYONE ALIVE OUT THERE?

2627
02:53:31,230 --> 02:53:33,730
WE WAITED TOO LONG.

2628
02:53:37,230 --> 02:53:40,850
WELL, KEEP CHECKING THEM, KEEP LOOKING!

2629

2652
02:56:51,680 --> 02:56:53,680
THERE'S NOTHING HERE, SIR.

2653
02:56:55,680 --> 02:56:57,180
COME BACK.

2654
02:56:58,180 --> 02:57:00,180
COME BACK.

2655
02:57:07,190 --> 02:57:09,190
I'LL NEVER LET GO.

2656
02:57:09,190 --> 02:57:11,200
I PROMISE.

2657
02:57:54,410 --> 02:57:55,920
COME ABOUT!

2658
02:58:16,630 --> 02:58:24,130
1,500 PEOPLE WENT INTO THE SEA WHEN TITANIC SANK FROM UNDER US.

2659
02:58:25,640 --> 02:58:30,140
THERE WERE 20 BOATS FLOATING NEARBY

2660
02:58:30,140 --> 02:58:32,640
AND ONLY ONE CAME BACK.

2661
02:58:34,150 --> 02:58:35,660
ONE.

2662
02:58:37,150 --> 02:58:40,150
SIX WERE SAVED FROM THE WATER

2663
02:58:40,150 --> 02:58:43,150
MYSELF INCLUDED.

2664
02:58:43,160 --> 02:58:48,670
SIX... OUT OF 1,500.

2665
02:58:50,660 --> 02:58:56,170
AFTERWARD, THE 700 PEOPLE IN THE BOATS

2666
02:58:56,170 --> 02:58:58,670
HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT WAIT...

2667
02:59:00,170 --> 02:59:03,670
WAIT TO DIE, WAIT TO LIVE...

2668
02:59:04,680 --> 02:59:09,180
WAIT FOR AN ABSOLUTION THAT WOULD NEVER COME.

2669
03:00:12,630 --> 03:00:14,630
OH, SIR, I DON'T THINK YOU'LL FIND

2670
03:00:14,630 --> 03:00:16,130
ANY OF YOUR PEOPLE DOWN HERE.

2671
03:00:16,130 --> 03:00:17,630
IT'S ALL STEERAGE.

2672
03:00:19,630 --> 03:00:21,640
Woman: HIS HAIR IS REDDISH BROWN.

2673
03:00:21,640 --> 03:00:24,140
REDDISH BROWN, REDDISH BROWN AND A WHITE BEARD.

2674
03:00:24,140 --> 03:00:26,640
Woman: ISN'T THERE ANOTHER PASSENGER LIST?

2675
03:00:26,640 --> 03:00:28,640
THERE'S NO OTHER LIST.

2676
03:00:28,640 --> 03:00:30,640
PERHAPS HE'S ON ANOTHER SHIP.

2677
03:00:30,650 --> 03:00:33,270
WE'RE DOING ALL WE CAN, MA'AM.

2678
03:00:55,790 --> 03:00:58,790
THAT'S THE LAST TIME I EVER SAW HIM.

2679
03:00:58,790 --> 03:01:02,790
HE MARRIED, OF COURSE, AND INHERITED HIS MILLIONS

2680
03:01:02,790 --> 03:01:06,800
BUT THE CRASH OF '29 HIT HIS INTERESTS HARD

2681
03:01:06,800 --> 03:01:09,300
AND HE PUT A PISTOL IN HIS MOUTH THAT YEAR

2682
03:01:09,300 --> 03:01:12,300
OR SO I READ.

2683
03:01:23,950 --> 03:01:26,450
CAN I TAKE YOUR NAME PLEASE, LOVE?

2684
03:01:29,450 --> 03:01:30,950
DAWSON.

2685
03:01:32,460 --> 03:01:34,960
ROSE DAWSON.

2686
03:01:35,080 --> 03:01:36,580
THANK YOU.

2687
03:01:43,080 --> 03:01:45,590
WE NEVER FOUND ANYTHING ON JACK.

2688
03:01:45,590 --> 03:01:47,590
THERE'S NO RECORD OF HIM AT ALL.

2689
03:01:48,090 --> 03:01:51,090
NO, THERE WOULDN'T BE, WOULD THERE?

2690
03:01:51,090 --> 03:01:54,590
AND I'VE NEVER SPOKEN OF HIM UNTIL NOW.

2691
03:01:54,600 --> 03:01:57,610
NOT TO ANYONE

2692
03:01:57,600 --> 03:01:59,600
NOT EVEN YOUR GRANDFATHER.

2693
03:01:59,600 --> 03:02:01,600
A WOMAN'S HEART

2694
03:02:01,600 --> 03:02:03,600
IS A DEEP OCEAN OF SECRETS.

2695
03:02:03,610 --> 03:02:08,120
BUT NOW YOU KNOW THERE WAS A MAN NAMED JACK DAWSON

2696
03:02:08,110 --> 03:02:10,110
AND THAT HE SAVED ME

2697
03:02:10,110 --> 03:02:14,110
IN EVERY WAY THAT A PERSON CAN BE SAVED.

2698
03:02:15,620 --> 03:02:19,120
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A PICTURE OF HIM.

2699
03:02:21,120 --> 03:02:25,130
HE EXISTS NOW ONLY IN MY MEMORY.

2700
03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:33,100
Man: Keldysh, Keldysh, Mir 2 on our way to the surface.

2701
03:02:48,650 --> 03:02:52,540
Brock: YOU KNOW I WAS SAVING THIS FOR WHEN I FOUND THE DIAMOND.

2702
03:03:01,050 --> 03:03:04,060
I'M SORRY.

2703
03:03:05,550 --> 03:03:11,050
THREE YEARS I'VE THOUGHT OF NOTHING EXCEPT TITANIC

2704
03:03:11,560 --> 03:03:13,560
BUT I NEVER GOT IT.

2705
03:03:15,560 --> 03:03:19,060
I NEVER LET IT IN.
