1
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:39,057
<i>Five thousand years ago,</i>

2
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:42,311
<i>a fierce warrior known as the Scorpion King</i>

3
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:44,479
<i>led a great army on a campaign</i>

4
00:00:44,563 --> 00:00:46,690
<i>to conquer the known world.</i>

5
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:12,567
<i>After a vicious campaign
which lasted seven long years,</i>

6
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:15,695
<i>the Scorpion King and his army
were defeated</i>

7
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:19,449
<i>and driven deep into the sacred desert
of A hm Shere.</i>

8
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,184
<i>One by one, they slowly perished
under the scorching sun</i>

9
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:52,274
<i>until only the great warrior himself
was left alive.</i>

10
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:01,116
<i>Near death,</i>

11
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,328
<i>the Scorpion King made a pact
with the dark god Anubis</i>

12
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:08,081
<i>that if Anubis would spare his life</i>

13
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:10,542
<i>and let him conquer his enemies,</i>

14
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:13,044
<i>he would give him his soul.</i>

15
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,890
<i>Anubis accepted his offer
and spared his life.</i>

16
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:55,879
<i>Anubis gave the Scorpion King
command of his army,</i>

17
00:03:57,672 --> 00:04:02,636
<i>And like an evil flood,
they washed away all that lay before them.</i>

18
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,317
<i>When his task was done,
Anubis forced the Scorpion King</i>

19
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,611
<i>to serve him for all time.</i>

20
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:30,705
<i>His army was returned to the sands
from whence they came,</i>

21
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:38,296
<i>Where they wait, silently,</i>

22
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,549
<i>to be awakened once again.</i>

23
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:18,480
Alex?

24
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:22,567
What were you thinking,
a mummy had come back to life?

25
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:24,444
I'll tell you a story sometime.

26
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:25,487
What are you doing down here?

27
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,988
I told you to wait for us up in the temple.

28
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:28,073
- But, Dad, I saw...
- No "buts."

29
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:29,199
It's dangerous down here, Alex.

30
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:31,951
- But I saw your tattoo.
- You saw what?

31
00:06:32,035 --> 00:06:35,080
On a wall by the entrance.
There's a cartouche just like it.

32
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:39,459
With the pyramid and the eye
and the two kings and everything.

33
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,836
- Really?
- Yeah.

34
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,839
Okay, well, I'll be up to take a look
at that in a minute.

35
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:46,675
In the meantime,
I want you to wait for us up there.

36
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:47,842
But... But...

37
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:51,346
No, pick up your stuff,
and I'll see you up in the temple. Go.

38
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,184
- Go on.
- And... And what shall I do?

39
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:58,728
I don't know. Surprise me.

40
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:01,523
- Build a better mousetrap.
- Okay.

41
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:04,442
While your mother goes
and desecrates another tomb.

42
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:19,791
Go away.

43
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:25,672
- Those are poisonous, you know.
- Only if they bite you.

44
00:07:25,755 --> 00:07:28,341
- What was all that about?
- Oh, nothing.

45
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:31,052
Alex wanted to show me something.

46
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:33,096
I swear,

47
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:35,682
the kid gets more
and more like you every day.

48
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:40,145
What, you mean more attractive,
sweet and devilishly charming?

49
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:42,480
No, he's driving me crazy.

50
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:44,691
Now, where were we?

51
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:47,444
Hammer and chisel.

52
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:55,869
- All right, all right! Let's do it your way.
- Thank you.

53
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:20,143
Ever since I had that dream,
this place is all I can think about.

54
00:08:20,226 --> 00:08:24,522
Ever since you had that dream,
I haven't had a decent night of sleep.

55
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:27,525
I feel like I've been here before.

56
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:31,613
- I know I've been here before.
- Evy, nobody's been here before.

57
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:34,949
Not in at least 3,000 years.
Except for these guys.

58
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:42,749
Then how do I seem to know exactly
where I'm going?

59
00:08:57,514 --> 00:08:58,765
Let's go.

60
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:36,344
Knock, knock. Anybody home?

61
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,600
You two check out that stuff,
see if it's there.

62
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:45,103
I'll sort out the O'Connells.

63
00:09:45,103 --> 00:10:15,103
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

64
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,324
You know, if you move that fast enough,
you can almost write your name.

65
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:23,201
I just had a vision.

66
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:27,789
It was...
It was like my dream, but it was real.

67
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:30,291
It was like I was actually here
in ancient times.

68
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:34,879
Well, if you actually were here,
could you show me how to open this thing?

69
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:36,881
Hold this.

70
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:56,025
- All right, now you're starting to scare me.
- Now I'm starting to scare myself.

71
00:11:56,901 --> 00:11:59,821
What is this?
Look at the state of this rubbish.

72
00:11:59,904 --> 00:12:03,700
Those Egyptians never had a clue.
It's all chintz and stuff.

73
00:12:04,242 --> 00:12:05,618
Look at that.

74
00:12:05,702 --> 00:12:09,831
Cheap pottery, this. Ancient rubbish.

75
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:18,297
- Jacques, something's hit me head!
- Shut up, Spivey. This place is cursed.

76
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:23,511
We do not want to wake the gods.

77
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:48,244
That's the emblem
of the Scorpion King.

78
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:50,496
He's supposed to be pure myth.

79
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,249
No... No trace of him
has ever been found before.

80
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:56,294
No artifacts, no archival evidence.

81
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:58,296
Maybe they didn't want anybody to find him.

82
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,380
Let's open this.

83
00:12:59,464 --> 00:13:02,216
Evy, I don't have
a real good feeling about this.

84
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,636
It's only a chest.
No harm ever came from opening a chest.

85
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,139
Right, and no harm ever came
from reading a book.

86
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:10,808
- Remember how that went?
- We can't stop now.

87
00:13:10,892 --> 00:13:13,519
Just remember,
I was the voice of reason here.

88
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:14,687
For once.

89
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:19,067
Rubbish. Rubbish. Dreck. Chintz.

90
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:21,611
Only half of this...

91
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:26,032
God, that hurt!

92
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,930
Hon? Let's do it your way.

93
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:09,158
The bracelet of Anubis.

94
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,377
I'll take care of this.

95
00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:27,426
Oh, my God.

96
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:30,555
It's a bit late for that!

97
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:33,766
- Put it in your rucksack.
- I got a better idea. Let's leave it here.

98
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,310
- I think it's a bit late for that!
- What's it say?

99
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:41,732
"He who disturbs this bracelet
shall drink from the Nile."

100
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:43,401
That doesn't sound too bad.

101
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:06,048
Jacques's gonna make a nice fillet
out of you, my son.

102
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:10,428
- Oh, please. Please.
- Spivey! Jacques!

103
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:13,931
- Let's get the hell out of here!
- Come on!

104
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:21,772
Come on!

105
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:07,485
Whoa.

106
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:16,869
This is bad, Evy!

107
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:19,413
- We've had bad before!
- This is worse!

108
00:16:58,536 --> 00:17:02,623
Mom, Dad, I can explain everything.

109
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:33,237
<i>The Book of the Dead</i> gives life.

110
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:36,198
And <i>The Book of the Living</i>

111
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,494
takes life away.

112
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,164
I thought that was my job.

113
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,501
We're getting close.

114
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:19,033
Did you acquire it?

115
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:32,565
We're getting very close.

116
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:48,956
We've found him.

117
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,711
We've found him! We've found him!

118
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:13,314
Step aside here. Out of the way!

119
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:22,406
Imhotep. It's him. It's Imhotep.

120
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:28,204
Now we must raise those that serve him.

121
00:20:29,413 --> 00:20:30,539
Get out of my way.

122
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:34,335
Get out of my way,
or I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

123
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:36,962
He means it. He shot someone before.

124
00:20:37,046 --> 00:20:41,717
- Give it to me.
- The opportunity passed us by.

125
00:20:42,635 --> 00:20:44,428
We need that bracelet.

126
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:47,097
And we need it before it opens.

127
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:52,603
Enough.

128
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:59,860
My dear Hafez,
I told you I should have handled it.

129
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:04,240
I did not want your past history
to cloud the issue.

130
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:06,951
We know where it is. We'll take care of it.

131
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:09,203
No, we'll take care of it.

132
00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:12,540
I have a different chore for you now.

133
00:21:12,623 --> 00:21:16,544
- Where is the bracelet?
- It's on its way to merry old London.

134
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:20,506
Then London is where we must go.

135
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,195
I think the bracelet is some sort of guide
to the lost oasis of A hm Shere.

136
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,741
Evy, I know what you're thinking,
and the answer is no.

137
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:49,910
We just got home.

138
00:21:49,994 --> 00:21:53,038
That's the beauty of it.
We're already packed.

139
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:56,750
Why don't you just give me
one good reason?

140
00:21:56,834 --> 00:22:01,505
It's just an oasis, darling.

141
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:06,844
A beautiful, exciting,

142
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:09,680
romantic

143
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:13,726
oasis.

144
00:22:14,143 --> 00:22:18,188
The kind with the white, sandy beach
and the palm trees

145
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:21,150
and the cool, clear, blue water and...

146
00:22:21,692 --> 00:22:25,696
We could have some of those big drinks
with the little umbrellas.

147
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:27,990
- Sounds good.
- Sounds too good.

148
00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:29,325
What's the catch?

149
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:31,744
Supposedly it's the resting place
of Anubis's army.

150
00:22:31,827 --> 00:22:34,455
See? I knew there's a catch.
There's always a catch.

151
00:22:34,538 --> 00:22:38,959
And let me guess. It was commanded
by that Scorpion King guy?

152
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:41,295
Yes, but he only awakens
once every 5,000 years.

153
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:43,130
Right. And if someone doesn't kill him,

154
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:45,674
- he's gonna wipe out the world.
- How did you know?

155
00:22:45,758 --> 00:22:47,801
I didn't. But that's always the story.

156
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:49,720
The last known expedition to actually

157
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:52,931
reach Ahm Shere was sent by Ramses IV

158
00:22:53,015 --> 00:22:54,808
over 3,000 years ago.

159
00:22:54,892 --> 00:22:57,603
- He sent over a thousand men.
- And none of them was ever seen again.

160
00:22:57,686 --> 00:22:58,771
- How did you know?
- I didn't.

161
00:22:58,854 --> 00:23:00,105
But that's always the story.

162
00:23:00,189 --> 00:23:02,191
- Did I mention there was a pyramid of gold?
- Twice.

163
00:23:02,274 --> 00:23:04,652
Alexander the Great
sent troops in search of it.

164
00:23:04,735 --> 00:23:06,403
- Hooray for him.
- So did Caesar.

165
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:08,572
- Yeah, look what happened to his career.
- And Napoleon.

166
00:23:08,656 --> 00:23:11,950
But we're smarter than him. And taller, too.

167
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:15,788
- Exactly. That's why we're gonna find it.
- Because we're taller?

168
00:23:16,955 --> 00:23:19,917
- That's why I love you.
- Nice try.

169
00:23:40,896 --> 00:23:42,189
Mom!

170
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,400
What do I do with this chest?

171
00:23:44,483 --> 00:23:46,694
This sucker weighs a goddang ton.

172
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:48,862
Alex, watch your language!

173
00:23:48,946 --> 00:23:50,781
Rather weighty, this.

174
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,454
Huh?

175
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:04,294
Evy, that first weird dream of yours
was exactly six weeks ago, right?

176
00:24:04,378 --> 00:24:07,548
I think so, yes.
But what's that got to do with anything?

177
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,593
It just happens to coincide
with Egyptian New Year.

178
00:24:12,261 --> 00:24:15,389
Oh. That's right. What a coincidence.

179
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:21,311
Maybe. All I'm saying is, let's be cautious.

180
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:27,568
Oh!

181
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:33,782
If anything happened to you,
I would never forgive myself.

182
00:24:53,886 --> 00:24:56,597
You and Alex are the only thing
that matter to me.

183
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,140
Well,

184
00:24:59,349 --> 00:25:02,853
the Bembridge scholars
have been begging me

185
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:04,980
to run the British Museum.

186
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:15,657
Wh... Whoa.

187
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:25,209
Cripes, how do you get this thing off?

188
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:27,336
Have I kissed you today?

189
00:25:35,886 --> 00:25:38,806
I hate it when you do that.

190
00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:41,850
- Why?
- Makes me feel like agreeing to anything.

191
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:43,393
Anything?

192
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:51,777
Those knickers are not mine.

193
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,738
Jonathan.

194
00:25:54,822 --> 00:25:57,407
Hey, Alex, behave yourself for five minutes.

195
00:25:57,991 --> 00:25:59,409
You betcha.

196
00:26:08,418 --> 00:26:11,171
- Happy to be home?
- Couldn't be happier.

197
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:14,341
It's the year of the scorpion.

198
00:26:14,424 --> 00:26:16,593
- Neat!
- Thought you might like that.

199
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:20,764
So then I killed the mummy
and all his minions and stole his scepter.

200
00:26:20,848 --> 00:26:24,726
- Oh, you're so brave.
- And rich. Did I mention rich?

201
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,937
What do you think I'm doing here?

202
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:31,275
Sorry. We must be in the wrong house.

203
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:34,027
- You said this was your house.
- No, I didn't.

204
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:35,779
Call me!

205
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,283
- You're not Sheila's husband, are you?
- No.

206
00:26:39,658 --> 00:26:42,828
Look, if you work for Johnny,
I was gonna pay him back on Tuesday.

207
00:26:42,911 --> 00:26:44,955
I don't know any Johnny.

208
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,374
We are looking for the bracelet of Anubis.

209
00:26:47,457 --> 00:26:50,794
Oh, good for you. Good thing to have,
the old bracelet of Anubis.

210
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:52,421
Where is it?

211
00:26:52,504 --> 00:26:55,048
You're looking here for the bracelet. I see.

212
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:57,134
I have no idea what you're talking about.

213
00:26:57,217 --> 00:27:00,387
Mr. O'Connell, you try my patience.

214
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,682
Mr. O'Connell? No, hold on a minute.
You've got the wrong...

215
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:05,934
That bracelet. Now I remember.

216
00:27:06,018 --> 00:27:09,688
- I lost it in a card game.
- For your sake, I hope not.

217
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,152
It can't be.

218
00:27:16,194 --> 00:27:17,863
Hello.

219
00:27:20,991 --> 00:27:22,409
Hello.

220
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,872
- Where's your wife?
- My wife? Oh, you mean Evy.

221
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:30,459
I think she went off to Baden-Baden
or Tibet or something.

222
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:32,002
The girl's a free spirit.

223
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:34,421
Did I mention I was single now?

224
00:27:40,177 --> 00:27:43,096
Egyptian asps are quite poisonous.

225
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:45,599
It's downstairs. There's a safe.

226
00:27:45,682 --> 00:27:50,228
The combination is 320-58...

227
00:27:50,312 --> 00:27:52,439
393-something.

228
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:55,734
It's in a safe downstairs.
I told you. I told you!

229
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:56,985
And your point is?

230
00:27:57,069 --> 00:27:59,321
My point is,
I told you so you wouldn't kill me.

231
00:27:59,404 --> 00:28:01,907
When did we make that arrangement?

232
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:10,582
Hello.

233
00:28:12,376 --> 00:28:14,670
Jonathan, I thought I said
no more wild parties.

234
00:28:14,753 --> 00:28:17,047
Well, when you're popular...

235
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,509
Alex, I'm serious.
If you've lost that key, you're grounded.

236
00:28:20,592 --> 00:28:23,553
I haven't lost it. I just can't find it.
There's a difference.

237
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:26,431
Well, you'd better start finding it then.

238
00:28:26,515 --> 00:28:28,850
I will, Mom. There's nothing to worry about.

239
00:28:28,934 --> 00:28:30,435
Good evening.

240
00:28:33,397 --> 00:28:36,942
Who are you? What are you doing here?

241
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:39,695
I'm looking for the chest, of course.

242
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:43,365
Give it to me now.

243
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:49,121
Get out of my house.

244
00:28:49,204 --> 00:28:51,415
Whoa, Mom. Maybe not the best idea.

245
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:53,250
Alex, get back there.

246
00:28:56,545 --> 00:28:59,047
Definitely not the best idea.

247
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:00,882
I think it's time to yell for Dad now.

248
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:04,594
- Now I will kill you and take it anyway.
- I think not.

249
00:29:06,763 --> 00:29:09,725
Ardeth, what are you doing here?

250
00:29:09,808 --> 00:29:11,852
Perhaps explanations are best kept for later.

251
00:29:11,935 --> 00:29:13,520
Ardeth Bay.

252
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:15,272
Lock-Nah.

253
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:17,649
Knowing my brother-in-law,

254
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:19,735
he probably deserves
whatever you're about to do to him,

255
00:29:19,818 --> 00:29:23,905
but this is my house, I have certain rules
about snakes and dismemberment.

256
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:28,910
Shoot him!

257
00:29:57,522 --> 00:30:00,859
Whoa, Mom! When did you learn to do that?

258
00:30:00,942 --> 00:30:02,486
I have no idea.

259
00:30:07,824 --> 00:30:09,242
That I learned from your father.

260
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,039
- I'll take that.
- Whoa!

261
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:25,967
Not bad for a Medjai.

262
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:34,059
Let go!

263
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:46,530
- What's in the chest?
- The bracelet of Anubis!

264
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:04,756
They must not get the bracelet!
Get it and get out of here!

265
00:31:11,263 --> 00:31:12,806
Mom, look out!

266
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:14,975
Evelyn!

267
00:31:19,521 --> 00:31:20,605
Mom!

268
00:31:27,028 --> 00:31:28,321
Jonathan!

269
00:31:29,406 --> 00:31:30,699
Jonathan!

270
00:31:34,077 --> 00:31:35,954
What'd you do this time?

271
00:31:36,037 --> 00:31:38,206
I haven't done anything to anybody!

272
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,751
- Lately.
- Come on!

273
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:04,524
Rick!

274
00:32:05,567 --> 00:32:07,527
- Evelyn!
- Look out, Rick!

275
00:32:17,913 --> 00:32:19,831
Dad! Dad!

276
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:22,334
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

277
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:23,877
Yeah? Okay.

278
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:26,963
O'Connell.

279
00:32:28,298 --> 00:32:31,426
What are you doing here?
No, scratch that. I don't care.

280
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:33,386
Who are those guys?
Where are they taking my wife?

281
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:36,181
My friend, I'm not sure,

282
00:32:36,264 --> 00:32:40,143
but wherever this man is,
your wife will surely be.

283
00:32:41,978 --> 00:32:43,730
Hey, I know him.

284
00:32:43,813 --> 00:32:46,691
He's the curator.
He works at the British Museum.

285
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:48,568
- Are you sure?
- Believe him.

286
00:32:48,652 --> 00:32:51,363
He spends more time there than at home.

287
00:32:53,615 --> 00:32:56,159
You're here, the bad guys are here,
Evy's been kidnapped.

288
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:58,203
- Let me guess.
- Yes, they once again removed

289
00:32:58,286 --> 00:32:59,412
the creature from his grave.

290
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:00,538
I don't mean to point fingers,

291
00:33:00,622 --> 00:33:02,874
but isn't it your job to make sure
that doesn't happen?

292
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,584
That woman who was with him,
she knows things

293
00:33:04,668 --> 00:33:06,544
that no living person could possibly know.

294
00:33:06,628 --> 00:33:08,797
She knew exactly
where the creature was buried.

295
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,050
We were hoping she would lead us
to the bracelet. She obviously did.

296
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:13,593
And now they have it.

297
00:33:13,677 --> 00:33:16,137
I wouldn't get too nervous just yet.

298
00:33:18,348 --> 00:33:19,432
Is that gold?

299
00:33:19,516 --> 00:33:21,601
When I stuck it on,
I saw the pyramids at Giza.

300
00:33:21,685 --> 00:33:24,521
Then, whoosh!
Straight across the desert to Karnak.

301
00:33:24,604 --> 00:33:26,439
By putting this on,
you have started a chain reaction

302
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:28,817
that could bring the next apocalypse.

303
00:33:29,192 --> 00:33:33,280
You, lighten up.
You, big trouble. You, get in the car.

304
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:41,121
I am sorry if I alarmed your son,

305
00:33:41,204 --> 00:33:44,207
but you must understand,
now that the bracelet is on his wrist,

306
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,751
we have only seven days before
the Scorpion King awakens.

307
00:33:46,835 --> 00:33:48,378
We? What we?

308
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:50,922
If he is not killed,
he will raise the Army of Anubis.

309
00:33:51,006 --> 00:33:53,883
- I take it that's not a good thing.
- Oh, he'll wipe out the world.

310
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:56,011
The old "wipe out the world" ploy.

311
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:02,559
Whomever can kill the Scorpion King

312
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:04,519
can send his army back to the Underworld

313
00:34:04,602 --> 00:34:07,314
or use it to destroy mankind
and rule the Earth.

314
00:34:07,397 --> 00:34:08,898
That's why they dug up Imhotep.

315
00:34:08,982 --> 00:34:11,318
He's the only guy tough enough
to take out the Scorpion King.

316
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:12,610
That is their plan.

317
00:34:25,248 --> 00:34:28,793
Alex, I've got a big job for you.
Stay here and protect the car.

318
00:34:28,877 --> 00:34:31,463
- I can do that.
- Protect the car?

319
00:34:31,546 --> 00:34:34,341
Just because I'm a kid
doesn't mean I'm stupid.

320
00:34:34,424 --> 00:34:36,885
- I know.
- Dad!

321
00:34:37,677 --> 00:34:41,014
If you see anyone come out screaming,
it's just me.

322
00:34:41,097 --> 00:34:44,809
- Maybe you should stay here and watch him.
- Yes, now you're talking.

323
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:52,275
- You want the shotgun?
- No, I prefer the Thompson.

324
00:34:58,948 --> 00:35:00,575
If I were to say to you,

325
00:35:00,658 --> 00:35:04,788
I'm a stranger traveling from the east,
seeking that which is lost...

326
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:07,624
Then I would reply that I am a stranger
traveling from the west.

327
00:35:07,707 --> 00:35:11,127
- It is I whom you seek. How...
- Then it is true.

328
00:35:11,211 --> 00:35:13,630
- You have the sacred mark.
- What, that?

329
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:16,174
No, that got slapped on me
in an orphanage in Cairo.

330
00:35:16,257 --> 00:35:21,638
That mark means you're a protector of man,
a warrior for God, a Medjai.

331
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:23,807
Sorry. You've got the wrong guy.

332
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:10,311
Mr. Hafez.

333
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,026
They found him.

334
00:36:49,225 --> 00:36:52,645
Rise up!

335
00:37:52,413 --> 00:37:53,665
Imhotep.

336
00:37:54,832 --> 00:37:56,292
What year is it?

337
00:37:56,459 --> 00:38:01,798
My Lord, it is the Year of the Scorpion.

338
00:38:02,006 --> 00:38:03,049
Truly?!

339
00:38:03,132 --> 00:38:04,133
Yes!

340
00:38:29,826 --> 00:38:31,744
Do not be frightened.

341
00:38:31,828 --> 00:38:33,079
I am not afraid.

342
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,709
I am Anck-su-namun reincarnated.

343
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:42,005
Only in body.

344
00:38:42,171 --> 00:38:43,798
But soon...

345
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:50,013
I shall bring your soul back
from the Underworld...

346
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:54,684
...and our love shall once again be whole.

347
00:39:02,942 --> 00:39:08,656
You know, a couple of years ago
this would've seemed really strange to me.

348
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:16,956
Lord Imhotep will be much pleased.

349
00:39:26,633 --> 00:39:28,217
Where is it?

350
00:39:28,718 --> 00:39:30,928
Where is the bracelet?

351
00:39:32,013 --> 00:39:33,431
I think I know.

352
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:38,645
At the very top of the gold pyramid,
there was a huge diamond.

353
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:39,812
Huge? How huge?

354
00:39:39,896 --> 00:39:45,234
It was so big, it would reflect the sun
and wink at distant travelers,

355
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:47,695
beckoning them to their deaths.

356
00:39:50,156 --> 00:39:52,075
I have a gift for you.

357
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:53,409
Her!

358
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:01,167
I knew it would please you to watch her die.

359
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:10,927
Get... No! Get off!

360
00:40:14,263 --> 00:40:15,473
Oh, my God.

361
00:40:15,765 --> 00:40:17,684
The Underworld awaits you.

362
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:21,104
You wait! I'll put you in your grave again!

363
00:40:21,187 --> 00:40:24,440
Our thinking was,
not if we put you in your grave first.

364
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:27,193
Burn her!

365
00:40:27,276 --> 00:40:28,820
You bast...

366
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:33,741
Rick!

367
00:40:43,126 --> 00:40:45,628
- Open it! Open it!
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

368
00:40:48,423 --> 00:40:49,632
Meela!

369
00:41:06,482 --> 00:41:08,901
- Hurry up!
- Come on, come on,

370
00:41:10,153 --> 00:41:12,822
- You broke it, you broke it, you broke it!
- Be quiet, Alex!

371
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:15,116
If there's gonna be hysterics,
they'll come from me!

372
00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:22,790
YOU!!

373
00:41:59,702 --> 00:42:01,287
Go, go, go, go!

374
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,039
Collect your bones!

375
00:42:03,206 --> 00:42:05,041
Gather your limbs!

376
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:07,919
Shake the earth from your flesh!

377
00:42:09,045 --> 00:42:10,880
Your Master is here!

378
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:19,347
Oh, no. Not these guys again.

379
00:42:19,722 --> 00:42:21,682
DESTROY THEM!!

380
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,192
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

381
00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:34,153
You're asking me? I'm only eight years old!

382
00:42:41,702 --> 00:42:45,540
Honey, what you doing?
These guys don't use doors.

383
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:50,211
Where the hell's Jonathan?

384
00:42:55,758 --> 00:42:57,510
- Alex!
- What's the matter with my car?

385
00:42:57,593 --> 00:43:00,096
I was forced to find an alternative
means of transportation.

386
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:02,515
- A double-Decker bus?
- It was his idea!

387
00:43:02,598 --> 00:43:03,850
- Was not!
- Was too!

388
00:43:03,933 --> 00:43:04,892
Just go!

389
00:43:04,976 --> 00:43:06,310
- It was too!
- Was not!

390
00:43:06,394 --> 00:43:07,687
Oh, jeez.

391
00:43:21,576 --> 00:43:24,036
No, no! Not my car!

392
00:43:28,457 --> 00:43:31,043
Oh, I hate mummies.

393
00:43:31,127 --> 00:43:33,963
- Glad to see me now?
- Just like old times, huh?

394
00:43:53,566 --> 00:43:54,734
Right.

395
00:45:13,562 --> 00:45:16,816
Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn!

396
00:45:33,374 --> 00:45:35,751
No! Get out of the way!

397
00:46:04,864 --> 00:46:06,407
Look out!

398
00:46:34,935 --> 00:46:36,312
Whoa!

399
00:47:09,512 --> 00:47:12,014
- Great driving, Uncle Jon.
- Yeah.

400
00:47:19,063 --> 00:47:23,692
- You all right?
- This was my first bus ride.

401
00:47:31,033 --> 00:47:32,535
What would I do without you?

402
00:47:32,618 --> 00:47:36,705
- Are all librarians this much trouble?
- Oh, jeez, get a room.

403
00:47:49,718 --> 00:47:51,554
- Let me go!
- Alex!

404
00:47:51,637 --> 00:47:53,347
- Silence!
- Stop!

405
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,975
- Go!
- Stop!

406
00:48:28,757 --> 00:48:30,134
Alex.

407
00:48:39,185 --> 00:48:40,477
I shall now go to Ahm Shere

408
00:48:40,561 --> 00:48:42,938
and kill the Scorpion King.

409
00:48:43,189 --> 00:48:46,275
And with his Army we shall rule the world...

410
00:48:46,483 --> 00:48:48,944
...together.

411
00:48:49,236 --> 00:48:50,946
My Lord...

412
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,073
...there is something you must know.

413
00:48:53,157 --> 00:48:55,159
They have the Scepter of Osiris.

414
00:48:55,242 --> 00:48:57,203
I have seen it.

415
00:48:57,786 --> 00:49:00,456
By the time we reach Ahm Shere,

416
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:02,958
my powers will have regenerated.

417
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:08,631
And I will have no need for the Scepter.

418
00:49:40,537 --> 00:49:43,707
Please, do not fear for your son, my friends.

419
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:47,461
They cannot hurt him,
for he wears the bracelet of Anubis.

420
00:49:47,628 --> 00:49:48,963
Alex is wearing the bracelet?

421
00:49:49,046 --> 00:49:52,549
When he put it on, he said he saw
the pyramids at Giza, the temple at Karnak.

422
00:49:52,633 --> 00:49:57,263
And when they reach Karnak, the bracelet
will show him the next step of the journey.

423
00:49:57,346 --> 00:49:58,722
Well, if we don't get to Karnak before them,

424
00:49:58,806 --> 00:50:01,433
we won't have any idea
where to look for him next.

425
00:50:01,517 --> 00:50:05,396
Seems to me like we need a magic carpet.

426
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,126
When Lord Imhotep
last encountered the O'Connells,

427
00:50:27,209 --> 00:50:30,296
they sent his immortal soul
to the Underworld.

428
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:34,466
As powerful as he will become,
he is still vulnerable.

429
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:38,220
Only with the Army of Anubis
will he be invincible.

430
00:50:39,388 --> 00:50:41,390
He will need your help.

431
00:50:45,144 --> 00:50:47,062
Keep this with you always.

432
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:49,440
Hey!

433
00:50:49,523 --> 00:50:51,317
<i>The Book of the Dead!</i>

434
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,694
What a bright little child.

435
00:50:55,321 --> 00:50:57,865
Your mother must be missing you terribly.

436
00:50:57,948 --> 00:51:00,659
If you wish to see her again,
you'd better behave.

437
00:51:00,743 --> 00:51:03,162
Lady, I don't behave for my parents.

438
00:51:03,245 --> 00:51:04,997
What makes you think
I'm going to do it for you?

439
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,206
Silence!

440
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:10,419
Because your parents wouldn't slip
poisonous snakes into your bed

441
00:51:10,919 --> 00:51:12,963
while you were sleeping.

442
00:51:13,672 --> 00:51:15,966
Lord Imhotep wishes to meet the boy.

443
00:51:16,842 --> 00:51:19,678
Now we shall see how brave you are.

444
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:23,724
Hey! Watch the suit! Hey!

445
00:51:24,433 --> 00:51:26,018
Me fingers!

446
00:51:27,436 --> 00:51:28,604
Nice.

447
00:51:32,316 --> 00:51:33,859
Very nice.

448
00:51:33,942 --> 00:51:38,113
- Did you acquire what we asked?
- Oh, we acquired it, all right.

449
00:51:38,447 --> 00:51:39,865
You know what?

450
00:51:39,948 --> 00:51:43,911
We had to kill two of those guards
at the mausoleum to acquire it.

451
00:51:43,994 --> 00:51:46,038
This chest is cursed.

452
00:51:48,123 --> 00:51:54,380
It says there is one, the undead,
who will kill all those who open this chest.

453
00:51:54,463 --> 00:51:56,298
Yes, yes, and the creature
will suck them dry,

454
00:51:56,382 --> 00:51:58,133
then become whole again.

455
00:51:58,634 --> 00:52:00,052
We've all heard this story before.

456
00:52:00,135 --> 00:52:04,056
Yeah, but I heard the yanks
who found it nine years ago all died.

457
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:06,058
Horrible deaths, they were.

458
00:52:06,517 --> 00:52:08,977
- So, with that in mind...
- We want ten.

459
00:52:09,061 --> 00:52:10,062
Quiet!

460
00:52:11,313 --> 00:52:13,148
This chest must never be opened.

461
00:52:13,816 --> 00:52:15,567
The agreement was for five.

462
00:52:15,651 --> 00:52:18,362
Yeah, well, we want ten,
or we'll take it elsewhere.

463
00:52:18,445 --> 00:52:21,073
- If you...
- Ten will be just fine.

464
00:52:21,156 --> 00:52:22,908
Follow me, gentlemen.

465
00:52:24,868 --> 00:52:26,161
Get in.

466
00:52:42,845 --> 00:52:45,222
I know you can understand me little one.

467
00:52:45,305 --> 00:52:47,850
So you must listen carefully because...

468
00:52:47,933 --> 00:52:50,853
It is you who are the chosen one,

469
00:52:50,936 --> 00:52:53,772
you who will take me to Ahm Shere.

470
00:52:53,856 --> 00:52:58,694
What if I don't? What if I get a little...lost?

471
00:53:01,071 --> 00:53:03,657
You have strength, little one.

472
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,909
You are your father's son.

473
00:53:05,993 --> 00:53:08,454
But I know something you don't.

474
00:53:08,537 --> 00:53:13,500
This bracelet is a gift and a curse.

475
00:53:14,126 --> 00:53:19,631
The sands of time
have already begun to pour against you.

476
00:53:23,385 --> 00:53:25,471
Yeah, yeah. I already heard this part.

477
00:53:25,554 --> 00:53:27,139
From the minute I put the bracelet on,

478
00:53:27,222 --> 00:53:30,017
seven days do I have before
the Scorpion King wakes up.

479
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,728
Did you also hear that
if you do not enter the pyramid

480
00:53:32,811 --> 00:53:35,314
before the sun strikes it
on that very morning

481
00:53:35,397 --> 00:53:38,442
that the bracelet
will suck the life out of you?

482
00:53:39,401 --> 00:53:41,069
That part I missed.

483
00:53:41,153 --> 00:53:44,156
Hey, wait a minute.
That means I've only got five days left.

484
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:48,619
Then I believe it will be best
if we do not get lost. Don't you?

485
00:53:48,702 --> 00:53:51,914
My dad is going to kick your ass.

486
00:53:59,546 --> 00:54:01,590
I do not think so.

487
00:54:05,928 --> 00:54:10,015
In here, gentlemen,
you shall receive your just rewards.

488
00:54:10,098 --> 00:54:12,017
No tricks now, woman.

489
00:54:12,392 --> 00:54:14,770
We're not giving up this chest
till we're satisfied.

490
00:54:14,853 --> 00:54:18,732
Oh, don't worry.
There is much satisfaction to be had.

491
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:28,992
What's going on?

492
00:54:33,705 --> 00:54:37,334
This place is cursed.

493
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:41,171
- What is it with you and curses?
- He ain't happy without a curse.

494
00:54:41,255 --> 00:54:45,425
- This is cursed. That is cursed.
- Give it a rest, will you!

495
00:54:48,971 --> 00:54:50,305
Christ!

496
00:54:59,064 --> 00:55:02,234
He wants you to open the chest!
Open the chest!

497
00:55:02,943 --> 00:55:04,570
No!

498
00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:28,719
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

499
00:55:48,071 --> 00:55:50,032
Spivey!

500
00:56:17,893 --> 00:56:21,355
- This is the magic carpet?
- He'll be fine. He's a professional.

501
00:56:24,274 --> 00:56:25,817
Izzy!

502
00:56:30,072 --> 00:56:31,198
Hey!

503
00:56:31,281 --> 00:56:34,159
- He definitely remembers you.
- He's a little shy.

504
00:56:34,242 --> 00:56:36,995
- Jonathan, get our bags.
- Oh, my hands are full.

505
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:39,956
- Now.
- Right. I'll get the bags.

506
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,167
I'll deal with the flight details.

507
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:46,129
- Honey, you're not a subtle man.
- We don't have time for subtle.

508
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,884
- Izzy, come here.
- Oh, no, no.

509
00:56:52,177 --> 00:56:54,930
- Doesn't look happy to see you.
- Never turned me down yet.

510
00:56:55,013 --> 00:56:57,015
Whatever it is, whatever you need,
I don't care.

511
00:56:57,099 --> 00:56:59,935
Forget it, O'Connell.
Every time I hook up with you, I get shot!

512
00:57:00,018 --> 00:57:03,814
Last time, I got shot in the ass.
I'm in mourning for my ass.

513
00:57:03,897 --> 00:57:06,983
- Remember that bank job in Marrakesh?
- Bank job?

514
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:10,320
- It's not like it sounds.
- It's exactly how it sounds.

515
00:57:10,404 --> 00:57:12,698
I'm flying high, hiding in the sun.

516
00:57:12,781 --> 00:57:15,701
The white boy here flags me down,
so I fly in low for the pickup.

517
00:57:15,784 --> 00:57:17,828
The next thing you know, I get shot!

518
00:57:17,911 --> 00:57:20,288
I'm lying in the middle of the road
with my spleen hanging out,

519
00:57:20,372 --> 00:57:23,333
and I see him waltzing up
with some belly dancer girl.

520
00:57:23,417 --> 00:57:27,045
Belly dancer girl?
Izzy, I think you and I should talk.

521
00:57:27,129 --> 00:57:29,381
- As long as I don't get shot.
- Quit your whining.

522
00:57:29,464 --> 00:57:31,842
You're gonna get paid this time.

523
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,345
O'Connell, have you looked
around here any? Huh?

524
00:57:35,429 --> 00:57:39,224
What do I need money for?
What the hell am I gonna spend it on?

525
00:57:39,307 --> 00:57:41,852
I'm gonna keep this short.
My little boy is out there.

526
00:57:41,935 --> 00:57:45,021
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to get him back.

527
00:57:51,903 --> 00:57:53,572
O'Connell, if you give me
that gold stick there,

528
00:57:53,655 --> 00:57:57,033
you can shave my head,
wax my legs and use me for a surfboard.

529
00:57:57,993 --> 00:58:00,120
Didn't we do that in Tripoli?

530
00:58:00,203 --> 00:58:03,707
Say, by the way,
when did you lose your eye?

531
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:05,917
Oh. I didn't.

532
00:58:06,001 --> 00:58:08,503
I just thought it made me
look more dashing.

533
00:58:09,671 --> 00:58:12,007
Come on. Get to work.

534
00:58:12,924 --> 00:58:16,470
- You're not exactly catching me at my best.
- Oh, I'm sure I am.

535
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:27,272
I knew it. I'm gonna get shot.

536
00:58:28,356 --> 00:58:31,985
These are the commanders
of the 12 tribes of the Medjai.

537
00:58:32,527 --> 00:58:33,779
Horus!

538
00:58:39,242 --> 00:58:42,662
- Pet bird.
- My best and most clever friend.

539
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:47,542
He will let the commanders know
of our progress so that they may follow.

540
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:06,603
If the Army of Anubis arises,

541
00:59:07,437 --> 00:59:10,065
they will do all they can to stop it.

542
00:59:10,398 --> 00:59:15,070
- Rick, are you sure Izzy's reliable?
- Yeah, yeah, he's reliable-ish.

543
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:22,994
- Isn't she beautiful?
- It's a balloon.

544
00:59:23,078 --> 00:59:26,540
- Oh! It's a dirigible.
- Where's your airplane?

545
00:59:26,623 --> 00:59:29,709
- Airplanes are a thing of the past.
- Izzy, you were right.

546
00:59:29,793 --> 00:59:31,503
- I was?
- Yeah. You're gonna get shot.

547
00:59:31,586 --> 00:59:35,090
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
She's faster than she looks.

548
00:59:35,173 --> 00:59:37,509
And she's quiet. Real quiet.

549
00:59:37,592 --> 00:59:41,179
Perfect for sneaking up on people,
which is a very good thing.

550
00:59:41,263 --> 00:59:43,348
Unless, of course, we go with your approach

551
00:59:43,431 --> 00:59:48,186
barging in face-first, guns blazing,
and getting your friends shot in the ass!

552
00:59:49,688 --> 00:59:52,440
Why can't you people
ever keep your feet on the ground?

553
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:42,991
O'Connell does not want to believe,
but he flies like Horus towards his destiny.

554
01:00:43,074 --> 01:00:46,953
Yes, yes, very interesting.
Tell me some more about this gold pyramid.

555
01:00:47,037 --> 01:00:49,706
Well, it is written
that since the time of the Scorpion King,

556
01:00:49,789 --> 01:00:52,834
no man who has laid eyes upon it
has ever returned to tell the tale.

557
01:00:52,918 --> 01:00:55,670
Where is all this stuff written? Hello.

558
01:00:57,631 --> 01:00:58,840
Got it.

559
01:01:04,512 --> 01:01:06,181
Pretty nice, eh?

560
01:01:06,556 --> 01:01:08,600
This is all I have left in the world.

561
01:01:08,683 --> 01:01:10,852
The rest of my fortune was lost

562
01:01:10,936 --> 01:01:13,480
to some rather unscrupulous characters,
actually.

563
01:01:13,563 --> 01:01:16,942
But if the curator reacted to it
the way you say, it must be very important.

564
01:01:17,025 --> 01:01:19,444
If I were you, I would keep it close.

565
01:01:19,527 --> 01:01:22,530
My friend, the gods couldn't take this away
from me.

566
01:01:22,614 --> 01:01:25,158
- Hey! That's mine!
- No, it's not!

567
01:01:26,952 --> 01:01:29,037
Keep your hands off of it.

568
01:01:36,878 --> 01:01:37,921
Hey.

569
01:01:39,005 --> 01:01:40,882
I want him back, Rick.

570
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,427
- I want him in my arms.
- I know.

571
01:01:47,263 --> 01:01:49,057
We taught him well.

572
01:01:50,266 --> 01:01:52,102
He's smarter than you

573
01:01:53,436 --> 01:01:55,188
and he's tougher than me.

574
01:01:55,271 --> 01:01:59,859
- I love him so much. I just can't...
- I know. We both do, and Alex knows that.

575
01:02:01,778 --> 01:02:05,198
- I'll get him back, Evy. I promise.
- I know you will.

576
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,935
- Are we there yet?
- No.

577
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:35,228
- Are we there yet?
- No.

578
01:02:35,311 --> 01:02:36,396
- Are we there yet?
- No.

579
01:02:36,479 --> 01:02:37,564
- Are we there yet?
- No.

580
01:02:37,647 --> 01:02:38,732
- Are we there yet?
- No.

581
01:02:38,815 --> 01:02:39,858
- Are we there yet?
- No.

582
01:02:39,941 --> 01:02:40,942
- Are we there yet?
- No.

583
01:02:41,026 --> 01:02:42,027
- Are we there yet?
- No.

584
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:43,319
- Are we there yet?
- No.

585
01:02:43,403 --> 01:02:44,404
- Are we there yet?
- No.

586
01:02:44,487 --> 01:02:46,114
- Are we there yet?
- No.

587
01:02:47,115 --> 01:02:48,950
Whoa! That was amazing!

588
01:02:49,034 --> 01:02:51,828
- Perfect aim.
- What are you talking about?

589
01:02:53,329 --> 01:02:54,622
I missed.

590
01:03:03,048 --> 01:03:04,716
I have to go to the bathroom.

591
01:03:36,164 --> 01:03:37,707
Make it quick.

592
01:03:44,964 --> 01:03:46,216
Hurry up.

593
01:03:49,761 --> 01:03:52,263
- Hey, reading material.
- Now!

594
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:59,604
I can't go when someone's watching.

595
01:04:02,107 --> 01:04:03,691
I don't trust you. You'll look.

596
01:04:13,409 --> 01:04:14,619
Damn!

597
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:22,877
Oh, my God! Doesn't anyone around here
know how to flush a toilet?

598
01:04:56,619 --> 01:04:57,620
The boy.

599
01:05:23,479 --> 01:05:24,731
Karnak.

600
01:05:37,285 --> 01:05:38,328
Huh?

601
01:06:05,647 --> 01:06:08,691
If a man does not embrace his past,
he has no future.

602
01:06:08,775 --> 01:06:12,528
Look, even if

603
01:06:13,071 --> 01:06:16,783
I was some sort of sacred Medjai,
what good does that do me now?

604
01:06:16,866 --> 01:06:18,993
It is the missing piece of your heart.

605
01:06:19,202 --> 01:06:22,789
If you embrace it, if you accept it,
you can do anything.

606
01:06:23,206 --> 01:06:25,041
Sounds great. Listen.

607
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,461
What can we expect
from our old friend Imhotep?

608
01:06:28,544 --> 01:06:30,588
His powers are returning.

609
01:06:30,672 --> 01:06:31,756
By the time he reaches Ahm Shere,

610
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:33,883
even the Scorpion King
won't be able to stop him.

611
01:06:49,524 --> 01:06:52,735
It is time to remind you of who you are...

612
01:06:55,238 --> 01:06:58,533
...and of who we are together.

613
01:06:58,741 --> 01:07:01,995
For our love is true love,

614
01:07:02,161 --> 01:07:05,331
an eternal love,

615
01:07:05,581 --> 01:07:07,208
our souls mated...

616
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:09,085
together as one...

617
01:07:09,752 --> 01:07:11,713
...forever.

618
01:07:56,924 --> 01:07:58,051
Put your mask on!

619
01:07:58,343 --> 01:08:00,261
Let's not scar that pretty face.

620
01:09:09,956 --> 01:09:13,126
You are learning quickly, Nefertiri.

621
01:09:13,418 --> 01:09:15,294
I'll have to watch my back.

622
01:09:15,711 --> 01:09:20,049
Yes... and I'll watch mine.

623
01:09:23,177 --> 01:09:24,178
Bravo! Bravo!

624
01:09:25,888 --> 01:09:30,268
Who better to protect
the Bracelet of Anubis...

625
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:33,563
than my lovely daughter, Nefertiri.

626
01:09:33,896 --> 01:09:37,024
And who better to protect <i>me,</i>

627
01:09:37,233 --> 01:09:38,860
than my future wife, Anck-su-namun.

628
01:09:43,448 --> 01:09:45,908
Well done, daughter.

629
01:10:51,891 --> 01:10:52,892
The Pharaoh!

630
01:10:55,102 --> 01:10:56,854
Anck-su-namun!

631
01:11:09,617 --> 01:11:10,868
Imhotep!

632
01:11:12,161 --> 01:11:13,162
Medjai!

633
01:11:13,579 --> 01:11:15,498
My father needs you!

634
01:11:24,966 --> 01:11:26,092
Evy!

635
01:11:38,312 --> 01:11:40,815
- Go! Save yourself!
- NO!

636
01:11:40,898 --> 01:11:42,775
Only you can resurrect me!

637
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:46,195
I won't leave you!

638
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,947
Get away from me!

639
01:11:49,824 --> 01:11:50,908
Anck-su-namun!

640
01:11:50,992 --> 01:11:52,243
Imhotep!

641
01:11:54,495 --> 01:11:57,665
My body is no longer his temple!

642
01:12:24,191 --> 01:12:26,694
- Imhotep.
- Anck-su-namun.

643
01:12:34,493 --> 01:12:36,662
Evy, I know
you haven't exactly been yourself lately

644
01:12:36,746 --> 01:12:38,331
with all these dreams and visions...

645
01:12:38,414 --> 01:12:40,958
No, no,
they're memories from my previous life.

646
01:12:41,042 --> 01:12:43,919
Honestly, I'm not losing my mind.
It all makes perfect sense now.

647
01:12:44,045 --> 01:12:45,880
And that's the reason
why we found the bracelet?

648
01:12:45,963 --> 01:12:47,923
Exactly. I was its protector.

649
01:12:48,007 --> 01:12:49,508
Now do you believe, my friend?

650
01:12:49,592 --> 01:12:51,802
Clearly, you were destined to protect
this woman.

651
01:12:51,886 --> 01:12:55,306
Right. She's a reincarnated princess,
and I'm a warrior for God.

652
01:12:55,389 --> 01:12:59,602
And your son leads the way to Ahm Shere.
Three sides of the pyramid.

653
01:12:59,727 --> 01:13:02,396
This was all preordained
thousands of years ago.

654
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,106
And how does the story end?

655
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:07,276
Only the journey's written,
not the destination.

656
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:10,321
- Convenient.
- How else do you explain Evy's visions?

657
01:13:10,404 --> 01:13:12,990
That it is your son who wears the bracelet?

658
01:13:13,074 --> 01:13:15,701
- How do you explain your mark?
- Coincidence.

659
01:13:15,868 --> 01:13:20,289
My friend, there is a fine line between
coincidence and fate.

660
01:13:40,518 --> 01:13:42,603
Don't even think about it!

661
01:13:46,357 --> 01:13:48,275
Hold on there, partner.

662
01:13:51,654 --> 01:13:53,447
When the time comes,

663
01:13:54,448 --> 01:13:56,826
I shall truly enjoy killing you.

664
01:13:58,786 --> 01:14:00,579
But until that time,

665
01:14:01,539 --> 01:14:04,083
you better be a little nicer to me.

666
01:14:04,417 --> 01:14:06,293
Now, where's my water?

667
01:14:10,297 --> 01:14:11,507
No ice?

668
01:14:16,929 --> 01:14:18,973
Make sure he doesn't move!

669
01:14:49,253 --> 01:14:51,505
They've gone. We've lost them.

670
01:15:07,813 --> 01:15:08,898
Rick!

671
01:15:18,115 --> 01:15:19,909
Alex left us his tie,

672
01:15:20,534 --> 01:15:23,913
and he made us a little sand castle.

673
01:15:24,789 --> 01:15:26,832
It's the Temple Island of Philae.

674
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:28,793
- They've gone to Philae.
- That-a-boy, Alex.

675
01:15:28,876 --> 01:15:30,169
Come on!

676
01:15:41,889 --> 01:15:44,225
The great temple of Abu Simbel.

677
01:17:11,645 --> 01:17:13,981
That's the Blue Nile down there.

678
01:17:14,106 --> 01:17:15,566
We must be out of Egypt by now.

679
01:17:15,649 --> 01:17:19,111
In ancient times, all this still belonged
to the upper kingdom.

680
01:17:19,528 --> 01:17:21,739
The oasis must be around here somewhere.

681
01:17:21,822 --> 01:17:24,742
Don't worry, Evy, we'll find him.
He's a smart kid.

682
01:17:24,825 --> 01:17:26,702
He'll leave us a sign.

683
01:17:31,916 --> 01:17:33,709
Surprised to see me?

684
01:17:34,376 --> 01:17:36,337
Leaving bread crumbs, huh? Huh?

685
01:17:37,713 --> 01:17:38,756
Lock-Nah!

686
01:17:38,839 --> 01:17:41,425
Put the boy down.

687
01:17:45,512 --> 01:17:49,183
I hope your parents enjoyed their journey.

688
01:18:30,849 --> 01:18:33,310
We're in trouble!

689
01:18:34,311 --> 01:18:35,437
Whoa!

690
01:18:45,614 --> 01:18:47,032
Horus, fly!

691
01:18:49,827 --> 01:18:53,914
Izzy, come hard right! Starboard! Starboard!

692
01:19:37,082 --> 01:19:39,835
Was there a little something
you forgot to mention?

693
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:45,799
People?

694
01:20:04,985 --> 01:20:06,320
Ahm Shere.

695
01:20:17,331 --> 01:20:18,540
Right.

696
01:20:25,672 --> 01:20:27,007
He's back!

697
01:20:30,344 --> 01:20:31,637
Hang on!

698
01:20:45,442 --> 01:20:47,319
Well, that's not good.

699
01:20:48,862 --> 01:20:50,114
Hang on!

700
01:20:57,704 --> 01:20:58,789
Mom?

701
01:20:59,873 --> 01:21:00,958
Dad?

702
01:21:10,884 --> 01:21:12,386
We're gonna go get my son.

703
01:21:12,469 --> 01:21:14,096
Then we're gonna wanna
get out of here fast,

704
01:21:14,179 --> 01:21:16,890
- so make this work, Izzy.
- No, no, you don't understand, goddamn it.

705
01:21:16,974 --> 01:21:19,685
This thing was filled with gas.
Not hot air... Gas.

706
01:21:19,768 --> 01:21:21,353
I need gas to get this thing off the ground.

707
01:21:21,436 --> 01:21:23,438
Where am I gonna get gas
from around here? Huh?

708
01:21:23,522 --> 01:21:26,191
Bananas? Mangos? Tarzan's ass?

709
01:21:26,275 --> 01:21:28,402
Well, maybe I could finagle it to take hot air.

710
01:21:28,485 --> 01:21:32,322
But do you know how many cubic meters
I'd need? It's too big!

711
01:21:32,781 --> 01:21:36,743
If anybody can fill this thing up with hot air,
Izzy, it's you.

712
01:21:43,208 --> 01:21:44,751
Come to Daddy.

713
01:21:48,088 --> 01:21:49,256
Horus!

714
01:21:58,056 --> 01:22:01,768
- So, Rick, what's the plan?
- Let's find some higher ground.

715
01:22:21,079 --> 01:22:22,289
Horus!

716
01:22:28,879 --> 01:22:30,505
- I must go.
- Where?

717
01:22:30,589 --> 01:22:32,090
I must let the commanders know
where we are.

718
01:22:32,174 --> 01:22:34,051
- You can't go.
- If the Army of Anubis arises...

719
01:22:34,134 --> 01:22:36,595
I need you to help me find my son.

720
01:22:41,975 --> 01:22:44,519
- Then first, I shall help you.
- Thank you.

721
01:23:23,517 --> 01:23:25,852
Look. Roman legionnaires.

722
01:23:28,397 --> 01:23:32,192
And here. Turn-of-the-century French.
Napoleon's troops.

723
01:23:32,276 --> 01:23:34,861
What in the name of Anubis did this?

724
01:23:55,882 --> 01:23:57,718
- You hear that?
- What?

725
01:23:59,094 --> 01:24:00,387
Nothing.

726
01:24:01,346 --> 01:24:03,098
Absolutely nothing.

727
01:24:05,058 --> 01:24:06,601
My word!

728
01:24:10,272 --> 01:24:12,357
I say, chaps, look at this.

729
01:24:12,441 --> 01:24:15,944
Shrunken heads.
I'd love to know how they do that.

730
01:24:19,281 --> 01:24:20,782
Just curious.

731
01:24:26,413 --> 01:24:27,914
You any good with that?

732
01:24:28,206 --> 01:24:31,168
Three times Fox and Hound's
grand champion, I'll have you know.

733
01:24:31,251 --> 01:24:34,755
- You any good with that?
- You'll know soon enough.

734
01:24:35,797 --> 01:24:39,593
Because the only way to kill
an Anubis warrior is by taking off its head.

735
01:24:40,761 --> 01:24:42,512
I'll remember that.

736
01:24:47,267 --> 01:24:49,686
Evy, try to remember to...

737
01:24:51,355 --> 01:24:54,107
Just keep it tight in the shoulder and

738
01:24:56,026 --> 01:24:58,820
lead the target a little bit, and then...

739
01:24:59,946 --> 01:25:02,449
And squeeze the trigger. Don't pull it.

740
01:25:04,284 --> 01:25:05,786
I won't miss.

741
01:25:45,575 --> 01:25:47,661
- Pyramid.
- The pyramid.

742
01:25:48,412 --> 01:25:50,539
Cripes, I'm in trouble now.

743
01:25:50,914 --> 01:25:52,124
Now may I kill him?

744
01:25:53,959 --> 01:25:54,960
My Lord...

745
01:25:55,043 --> 01:25:58,171
Now there is no need for the boy.

746
01:25:58,422 --> 01:26:00,173
Yes, but we need the bracelet.

747
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:02,509
It will unlock the Army of Anubis.

748
01:26:02,717 --> 01:26:03,760
The bracelet?

749
01:26:03,844 --> 01:26:05,470
The bracelet is the key?!

750
01:26:05,554 --> 01:26:08,014
- Retrieve that bracelet.
- With pleasure.

751
01:26:22,112 --> 01:26:23,113
What is it?

752
01:26:34,332 --> 01:26:37,043
Something is coming.

753
01:26:51,808 --> 01:26:53,059
Fan out! Eyes open! Guns up!

754
01:26:57,981 --> 01:26:59,566
- Jonathan?
- Yes?

755
01:27:00,192 --> 01:27:02,944
That's my husband and my son down there.

756
01:27:03,278 --> 01:27:04,821
Make me proud.

757
01:27:05,822 --> 01:27:07,741
Today's that day, Evy.

758
01:27:09,326 --> 01:27:13,246
Do not fear. They cannot harm me.

759
01:27:15,874 --> 01:27:17,459
Where's the boy?

760
01:28:36,121 --> 01:28:37,664
The black book!

761
01:28:42,711 --> 01:28:44,004
Let's go!

762
01:29:13,658 --> 01:29:15,201
There you are!

763
01:29:17,787 --> 01:29:21,333
- The time has come, my little friend.
- Let go!

764
01:29:39,267 --> 01:29:41,811
- Dad!
- Alex!

765
01:29:43,229 --> 01:29:44,481
Alex...

766
01:29:51,905 --> 01:29:52,947
Dad!

767
01:30:02,457 --> 01:30:05,293
Time to remove that bracelet, my good son.

768
01:30:05,418 --> 01:30:06,544
Dad!

769
01:30:15,845 --> 01:30:18,390
- Dad, behind you!
- Whoa!

770
01:31:41,598 --> 01:31:43,933
- Let's go.
- Thank God for that.

771
01:31:51,107 --> 01:31:55,028
The two of you must sacrifice yourselves
for me.

772
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:58,448
You shall be rewarded in heaven!

773
01:32:13,630 --> 01:32:15,048
- Mom!
- Alex!

774
01:32:16,341 --> 01:32:17,425
Hey, nice shootin', Tex.

775
01:32:17,509 --> 01:32:19,636
What were those creepy little pygmy things?

776
01:32:19,719 --> 01:32:21,930
- Just the local natives.
- Are you sure?

777
01:32:22,013 --> 01:32:23,264
I'm sure. It was nothin'.

778
01:32:23,348 --> 01:32:25,308
Come on, Mom! Come on! Come on, Dad!

779
01:32:25,391 --> 01:32:28,728
We have to get to the pyramid.
I have to get the bracelet off now!

780
01:32:28,812 --> 01:32:30,814
Oh, leave it on, Alex. Looks good on you.

781
01:32:30,897 --> 01:32:32,899
No, you guys! You don't understand!

782
01:32:32,982 --> 01:32:34,651
He told me the bracelet will kill me

783
01:32:34,734 --> 01:32:37,612
if I don't get inside the pyramid
before the sun hits it!

784
01:32:37,695 --> 01:32:40,240
- Today!
- Oh, my God.

785
01:32:43,952 --> 01:32:45,370
Time to go!

786
01:32:46,579 --> 01:32:48,540
I thought you said it was nothing!

787
01:33:01,386 --> 01:33:03,054
Where's Jonathan?

788
01:33:12,939 --> 01:33:14,691
Look! There's a burial ground!

789
01:33:14,774 --> 01:33:16,317
We're safe! We're safe!

790
01:33:16,401 --> 01:33:18,444
See those sacred stones?
They'll never cross those.

791
01:33:18,528 --> 01:33:21,281
- You are sure?
- Yes, of course I'm sure!

792
01:33:36,546 --> 01:33:38,256
Sorry. My mistake.

793
01:33:46,764 --> 01:33:49,726
- Wait for me!
- Hurry up, Jonathan!

794
01:33:50,977 --> 01:33:53,521
Wait for me! What's that for?

795
01:33:53,688 --> 01:33:56,190
Ah, nothin'. Just a little something
in case of an emergency.

796
01:34:14,292 --> 01:34:15,418
Rick.

797
01:34:19,213 --> 01:34:20,798
Let's go, Alex!

798
01:34:29,933 --> 01:34:33,353
Run! Come on, Alex, faster! Come on!

799
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:37,023
- Come on!
- Dad! The bracelet!

800
01:34:37,190 --> 01:34:39,150
Run! Come on!

801
01:35:02,173 --> 01:35:04,676
You know, it's not

802
01:35:05,176 --> 01:35:07,178
easy being a dad.

803
01:35:08,596 --> 01:35:11,265
Yeah, but you do it really good.

804
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:13,851
Thanks.

805
01:35:32,912 --> 01:35:35,415
They made it. Thank God.

806
01:35:36,541 --> 01:35:38,418
Oh, yes. Great.

807
01:35:39,085 --> 01:35:40,420
Fabulous.

808
01:35:44,007 --> 01:35:45,091
No!

809
01:35:57,937 --> 01:35:59,022
Evy!

810
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:00,565
Evy!

811
01:36:05,987 --> 01:36:08,031
- Jonathan! Jonathan!
- Mom!

812
01:36:09,323 --> 01:36:12,243
- You're going to be all right. Isn't she, Dad?
- She'll be fine.

813
01:36:12,326 --> 01:36:15,038
- She's going to be all right.
- Just get him... Take him. Take...

814
01:36:15,121 --> 01:36:17,081
Mommy's fine. It's okay.

815
01:36:18,332 --> 01:36:20,293
- Where... Evy...
- Your mother's gonna be fine, okay?

816
01:36:20,376 --> 01:36:22,003
Oh, my God!

817
01:36:22,795 --> 01:36:25,506
You're real strong.
You're gonna make it. You're gonna make it.

818
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:26,966
You're fine.

819
01:36:27,550 --> 01:36:30,970
What do I do? What do I do, Evy?

820
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,640
- What do I do?
- Take care of Alex.

821
01:36:36,809 --> 01:36:40,146
No. Sweetheart, no.

822
01:36:42,482 --> 01:36:43,900
I love you.

823
01:36:45,485 --> 01:36:48,738
No, don't... No. No!

824
01:36:50,031 --> 01:36:51,616
Evy? Evy?

825
01:36:52,909 --> 01:36:56,954
No. No. Evy!

826
01:37:01,417 --> 01:37:03,169
Come back, Evy.

827
01:37:05,296 --> 01:37:07,215
Evy, come back.

828
01:37:08,341 --> 01:37:09,717
Come back.

829
01:38:21,455 --> 01:38:22,498
The great god Anubis...

830
01:38:22,582 --> 01:38:25,084
...has taken my powers.

831
01:38:25,751 --> 01:38:29,088
It seems he wishes me to fight...

832
01:38:29,255 --> 01:38:30,965
...as a mortal.

833
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,512
Stay here.

834
01:39:28,606 --> 01:39:29,732
Whoa!

835
01:40:05,851 --> 01:40:06,852
So it begins.

836
01:40:11,357 --> 01:40:13,901
Try to think of it like this, Alex.

837
01:40:14,235 --> 01:40:16,487
She's gone to a better place.

838
01:40:16,654 --> 01:40:18,531
You know, like it says in the good book.

839
01:40:18,614 --> 01:40:20,241
- The book.
- What?

840
01:40:20,324 --> 01:40:21,450
That's it.

841
01:40:21,534 --> 01:40:24,287
- That's it. Come on, Uncle Jon!
- That's what?

842
01:40:24,370 --> 01:40:26,163
- Come on! Come on! That's it! The book!
- What?

843
01:40:35,631 --> 01:40:39,552
You're too late, O'Connell.
I have released the Army of Anubis.

844
01:40:40,344 --> 01:40:44,557
Lord Imhotep shall soon kill
the Scorpion King and take command.

845
01:40:45,641 --> 01:40:47,560
Not after I get through with him.

846
01:41:07,747 --> 01:41:09,415
I must face the Scorpion King alone.

847
01:41:09,498 --> 01:41:10,666
No. You must not.

848
01:41:10,833 --> 01:41:12,793
Without your powers he will kill you.

849
01:41:13,002 --> 01:41:14,086
Nothing can stop us.

850
01:41:14,211 --> 01:41:16,005
It is our destiny!

851
01:41:16,088 --> 01:41:17,214
<i>Niy!</i>

852
01:41:18,883 --> 01:41:21,093
I don't want to lose you again.

853
01:41:25,598 --> 01:41:28,225
<i>Niy! Niy!</i>

854
01:41:28,934 --> 01:41:30,353
You realize, of course,

855
01:41:30,436 --> 01:41:34,190
that this can only be done by someone
who can actually read ancient Egyptian.

856
01:41:34,273 --> 01:41:37,234
I don't know about you, but I'm a tad rusty.

857
01:41:38,319 --> 01:41:39,695
Now where?

858
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:42,156
- We go right.
- How do you know?

859
01:41:43,157 --> 01:41:45,117
<i>"Kasheesh Osirian Nye."</i>

860
01:41:45,659 --> 01:41:48,704
Basically, "This way to the Scorpion King."

861
01:41:50,247 --> 01:41:51,791
Mum taught me.

862
01:41:55,086 --> 01:41:56,921
This just might work.

863
01:42:27,993 --> 01:42:30,329
It's time someone taught you a lesson,
wench. Come on.

864
01:42:39,296 --> 01:42:41,173
This is for my sister.

865
01:43:33,767 --> 01:43:36,020
So you wish to kill me?

866
01:43:36,103 --> 01:43:38,063
And then you would kill him...

867
01:43:39,315 --> 01:43:41,817
...and send his Army back
to the Underworld.

868
01:43:43,152 --> 01:43:45,988
This I cannot allow.

869
01:44:30,616 --> 01:44:32,535
Is that all you've got?

870
01:45:24,461 --> 01:45:26,005
Hurry up, Alex!

871
01:45:26,255 --> 01:45:30,759
<i>"Hootash naraba oos Veesloo.</i>

872
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:34,305
<i>"Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei."</i>

873
01:46:17,222 --> 01:46:20,476
<i>"Efday Shokran... Efday Shokran..."</i>

874
01:46:20,559 --> 01:46:23,395
Uncle Jon, I don't know
what this last symbol is!

875
01:46:23,562 --> 01:46:26,982
- What's it look like?
- It's a bird! A stork!

876
01:46:29,652 --> 01:46:32,071
I know that one! I know that one!

877
01:46:32,696 --> 01:46:34,323
Then what is it?

878
01:46:36,617 --> 01:46:38,035
<i>Ahmenophus!</i>

879
01:46:39,078 --> 01:46:42,373
That's it! <i>"Efday Shokran Ahmenophus!"</i>

880
01:47:23,497 --> 01:47:26,458
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

881
01:47:26,792 --> 01:47:29,545
- Oh, my God. Evy!
- Take Alex.

882
01:47:29,628 --> 01:47:31,463
- Go and help Rick.
- But Mom...

883
01:47:31,547 --> 01:47:32,715
No "buts," Alex.

884
01:47:32,798 --> 01:47:35,008
- Come on, Alex.
- But... But...

885
01:47:36,844 --> 01:47:38,554
I'll be just fine.

886
01:47:38,804 --> 01:47:40,764
We did it, Uncle Jon! We did it!

887
01:47:40,848 --> 01:47:42,850
Right, partner. Now, let's go help your dad.

888
01:48:38,113 --> 01:48:39,114
I am your servant!

889
01:48:39,198 --> 01:48:41,408
I am your servant!

890
01:48:44,036 --> 01:48:45,287
We shall see.

891
01:48:48,582 --> 01:48:51,293
But <i>he</i> was sent to kill you!

892
01:49:19,404 --> 01:49:20,739
Nefertiri.

893
01:49:22,074 --> 01:49:23,242
Anck-su-namun.

894
01:49:24,576 --> 01:49:25,577
Good.

895
01:49:40,717 --> 01:49:42,803
You have remembered the old ways.

896
01:49:45,305 --> 01:49:47,349
That's a little something new!

897
01:50:16,128 --> 01:50:17,421
My lord!

898
01:50:19,590 --> 01:50:21,383
Save me! Save me!

899
01:50:21,633 --> 01:50:22,759
Why?

900
01:51:18,732 --> 01:51:19,858
God help us.

901
01:51:46,969 --> 01:51:48,971
Okay, now I'm a believer.

902
01:51:49,972 --> 01:51:51,098
Rick!

903
01:51:53,141 --> 01:51:54,768
- Jonathan!
- Dad!

904
01:51:55,227 --> 01:51:56,395
It's a spear!

905
01:51:56,478 --> 01:51:59,147
The gold stick thing... It's a... It's a spear!

906
01:51:59,231 --> 01:52:02,109
Really? Doesn't look like a spear!

907
01:52:02,192 --> 01:52:05,320
No! That's because it opens up into one!

908
01:52:05,404 --> 01:52:07,406
- Yes? And?
- Jonathan!

909
01:52:07,489 --> 01:52:10,659
It opens up into a spear!

910
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:41,606
'Til Death!

911
01:52:57,080 --> 01:53:00,000
- Rick!
- Evy?

912
01:53:06,548 --> 01:53:09,009
- Twist it!
- Pull! I tried it! Push!

913
01:53:11,511 --> 01:53:12,679
The Spear of Osiris!

914
01:53:12,971 --> 01:53:14,598
Jonathan, quick!

915
01:53:28,570 --> 01:53:31,698
Jonathan, throw it! Kill the Scorpion King!

916
01:53:31,782 --> 01:53:33,867
Send his army back to the Underworld!

917
01:53:34,493 --> 01:53:36,828
Step aside, Alex. I'm a professional.

918
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:54,054
The Army of Anubis shall now be MINE!

919
01:53:56,681 --> 01:53:57,849
Rick!

920
01:54:05,774 --> 01:54:07,526
No!

921
01:54:27,045 --> 01:54:28,088
No!

922
01:54:33,343 --> 01:54:34,845
<i>Niy!</i>

923
01:54:40,809 --> 01:54:44,229
Go to hell, and take your friends with you!

924
01:56:00,764 --> 01:56:01,806
Dad!

925
01:56:19,824 --> 01:56:22,994
Evy, no! Get out of here!

926
01:56:23,328 --> 01:56:25,163
Just get out of here!

927
01:56:25,956 --> 01:56:27,040
No!

928
01:56:31,503 --> 01:56:32,629
Mom!

929
01:56:46,017 --> 01:56:47,143
Hang on, Rick!

930
01:56:57,612 --> 01:56:59,155
Anck-su-namun!

931
01:56:59,948 --> 01:57:01,032
HELP ME!

932
01:57:01,825 --> 01:57:02,867
HELP ME!

933
01:57:03,827 --> 01:57:06,913
- No!
- Anck-su-namun!

934
01:57:11,334 --> 01:57:12,877
Anck-su-namun.

935
01:57:56,921 --> 01:57:58,089
Whoa!

936
01:58:02,969 --> 01:58:04,429
Let's go up!

937
01:58:23,990 --> 01:58:26,201
This whole damn place
is gonna get sucked up!

938
01:58:26,284 --> 01:58:27,952
Let's move up! Go!

939
01:58:41,299 --> 01:58:43,468
Go, Alex! Come on! Come on!

940
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:55,814
Rick, we're trapped!

941
01:59:03,321 --> 01:59:04,447
Hey!

942
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:10,578
- Izzy!
- Come on! Get your butts moving!

943
01:59:10,662 --> 01:59:12,872
Hurry up! Hurry up! I haven't got all day!

944
01:59:17,293 --> 01:59:18,920
Go! You're next!

945
01:59:26,761 --> 01:59:28,263
Jonathan! Hold on!

946
01:59:28,346 --> 01:59:31,474
- Pull him up! Pull him up!
- Pull up! Pull me up!

947
01:59:33,935 --> 01:59:37,522
Wait! Wait! Let me down! Let me down!

948
01:59:37,605 --> 01:59:41,025
- It's not worth your life, you idiot!
- Yes, it is! Yes, it is!

949
01:59:43,736 --> 01:59:44,946
Right.

950
01:59:52,203 --> 01:59:55,039
Pull me up! Pull me up!

951
02:00:10,054 --> 02:00:12,724
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Okay.

952
02:00:13,224 --> 02:00:15,768
Yeah! O'Connell.

953
02:00:15,852 --> 02:00:18,354
- You almost got me killed!
- At least you didn't get shot.

954
02:00:19,397 --> 02:00:21,858
Izzy! Thank you!

955
02:00:22,859 --> 02:00:24,235
Thank you!

956
02:00:25,111 --> 02:00:26,446
Yes!

957
02:00:28,198 --> 02:00:30,742
O'Connell, who the hell
you been messin' with this time?

958
02:00:30,825 --> 02:00:32,577
Huh? Oh, you know, the usual.

959
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:34,871
Mummies, pygmies,

960
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:36,915
big bugs.

961
02:01:06,152 --> 02:01:08,613
I thought I almost lost you there.

962
02:01:09,113 --> 02:01:11,074
For a moment there, you did.

963
02:01:12,367 --> 02:01:14,786
Would you like to know
what heaven looks like?

964
02:01:16,246 --> 02:01:17,413
Later.

965
02:01:21,417 --> 02:01:23,211
Oh, please!

966
02:01:23,545 --> 02:01:26,005
- That's half mine, you know.
- What?

967
02:01:26,089 --> 02:01:28,466
- That's half mine.
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

968
02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:31,636
What? You took my gold stick!
I know you took my gold stick!

969
02:01:31,719 --> 02:01:35,890
I swear on the head of my wife,
I have no idea what you're talking about.

970
02:01:35,974 --> 02:01:37,976
You haven't... You ain't got a wife!

971
02:01:38,059 --> 02:01:40,603
I don't have
your gold stick either!

972
02:04:21,597 --> 02:04:23,141
<i>Forever</i>

973
02:04:31,232 --> 02:04:34,777
