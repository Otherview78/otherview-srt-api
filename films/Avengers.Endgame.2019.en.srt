1
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:10,094
Okay, hold on, don't shoot.

2
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,597
- You see where you're going? - Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:13,764
Okay.

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,850
Now, let's worry about how you get there.

5
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:18,102
Gotta move your foot here.

6
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:20,021
Point your toe this way.

7
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:21,939
Your hips here.

8
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:23,482
Okay?

9
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:25,610
- Can you see? - Yeah.

10
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:26,777
- Are you sure? - Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,279
How about now? Can you see now?

12
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:29,739
- No. - How about now?

13
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:32,992
All right.

14
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,661
Ready? Three fingers.

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:37,538
Nice!

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,625
Nice throw, kiddo.

17
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:41,876
Here you go.

18
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,295
Hey, you guys want mayo? Or mustard?

19
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:45,922
Or both?

20
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:48,174
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

21
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:49,300
Probably your brothers.

22
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,636
Two mustard, please! Thanks, Mama.

23
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:52,637
Got it!

24
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,722
Nate, mayo or mustard?

25
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:56,557
How about ketchup?

26
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,935
Or ketchup. I got ketchup, too.

27
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:00,311
Mind your elbow.

28
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:04,357
Good job, hawk-eye.

29
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,150
Go get your arrow.

30
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:10,363
Hey, guys!

31
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,740
Enough practice. Soup's on!

32
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:13,950
All right.

33
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,493
We're coming. We're hungry.

34
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:18,037
Lila, let's go.

35
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,333
Lila?

36
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:26,254
Honey?

37
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,300
Hey, babe?

38
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,186
Babe?

39
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,439
Babe?

40
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,317
Boys!

41
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:51,070
Boys!

42
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:54,573
Laura!

43
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,618
You don't need to do that.

44
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,830
Because you're just holding the position.

45
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:45,041
Oh, yeah.

46
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,334
That was close.

47
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,962
That's a goal. We are now one apiece.

48
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,505
I would like to try again.

49
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,218
We're tied up. Feel the tension?

50
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,928
It's fun.

51
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,097
That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win.

52
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,350
And you've won.

53
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:04,602
Congratulations.

54
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:05,895
Fair game.

55
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:08,606
Good sport.

56
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:10,983
You have fun?

57
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,737
It was fun.

58
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:38,886
This thing on?

59
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,057
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

60
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,103
If you find this recording...

61
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,939
don't post it on social media.

62
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,816
It's gonna be a real tearjerker.

63
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,902
I don't know if you're ever gonna see these.

64
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,113
I don't even know if you're still...

65
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,532
Oh, God, I hope so.

66
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,618
Today's day 21.

67
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:05,037
No, 22.

68
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,249
You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror...

69
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:12,878
of staring into the literal void of space, I'd say I'm feeling a little better today.

70
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:16,090
Infection's run its course, thanks to the Blue Meanie back there.

71
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,259
You'd love her.

72
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:19,844
Very practical.

73
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,388
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

74
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:29,478
So, the fuel cells were cracked during battle...

75
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,814
and we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge...

76
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:34,692
and bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time.

77
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,822
But it's now dead in the water.

78
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:43,492
Thousand light years from the nearest 7-Eleven.

79
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:47,371
Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning...

80
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:50,541
and that'll be it.

81
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,922
Pep, I know I said no more surprises...

82
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,676
but I gotta say I was really hoping to pull off one last one.

83
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,803
But it looks like...

84
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,763
Well, you know what it looks like.

85
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:08,017
Don't feel bad about this.

86
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:10,978
I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks...

87
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,857
and then move on with enormous guilt...

88
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:24,033
I should probably lie down for a minute. Go rest my eyes.

89
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,579
Please know...

90
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,375
when I drift off, it'll be like every night lately.

91
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,545
I'm fine. Totally fine.

92
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:38,506
I dream about you.

93
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,675
Because it's always you.

94
00:05:41,675 --> 00:06:11,675
Subtitle www.movieddl.me

95
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,421
Couldn't stop him.

96
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,588
Neither could I.

97
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,923
Hang on.

98
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,927
I lost the kid.

99
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,056
Tony, we lost.

100
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,351
Is...?

101
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,979
- Oh, good. - Oh, my God!

102
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,022
Oh, my God!

103
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,155
It's okay.

104
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,872
It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.

105
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,585
World governments are in pieces.

106
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,670
The parts that are still working...

107
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,632
...are trying to take a census and it looks like he did...

108
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,970
He did exactly what he said he was gonna do.

109
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,305
Thanos wiped out...

110
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,810
...50% of all living creatures.

111
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,066
Where is he now? Where?

112
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,943
We don't know.

113
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,197
He just opened a portal and walked through.

114
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,867
What's wrong with him?

115
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,912
He's pissed.

116
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,413
He thinks he failed.

117
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:23,874
Which, of course, he did...

118
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,168
but there's a lot of that going around, ain't there?

119
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,879
Honestly, until this exact second I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

120
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,464
Maybe I am.

121
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,007
We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now.

122
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,176
Deep space scans...

123
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,386
and satellites, and we got nothing.

124
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,181
Tony, you fought him.

125
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:40,265
Who told you that?

126
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:41,975
I didn't fight him.

127
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,727
No, he wiped my face with a planet...

128
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,313
while the Bleecker Street magician gave away the store.

129
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,816
That's what happened. There was no fight, 'cause he's not beatable.

130
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,693
Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?

131
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,198
I saw this coming a few years back.

132
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,991
I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.

133
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,952
Thought I was dreaming.

134
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,119
Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.

135
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,038
And I needed you.

136
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,248
As in, past tense.

137
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,668
That trumps what you need. It's too late, buddy.

138
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:08,961
Sorry.

139
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,631
You know what I need? I need a shave.

140
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,801
And I believe I remember telling all yo use...

141
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:16,844
Tony, Tony!

142
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,307
...alive and otherwise, that what we needed was a suit of armor around the world.

143
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:26,103
Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not.

144
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,479
That's what we needed.

145
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:28,730
Well, that didn't work out, did it?

146
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,315
I said we'd lose.

147
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,651
You said, "We'll do that together, too."

148
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,278
And guess what, Cap?

149
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,737
We lost.

150
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,197
And you weren't there.

151
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:39,950
But that's what we do, right?

152
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,870
Our best work after the fact? We're the "Avengers."

153
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,997
We're the "Avengers," not the "Pre-vengers."

154
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,164
- Okay. - Right?

155
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,541
You made your point. Just sit down, okay?

156
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,667
Okay. No, no, here's my point. You know what?

157
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,210
- She's great by the way. - Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

158
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,004
We need you. You're new blood.

159
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,007
Bunch of tired old mules. I got nothing for you, Cap.

160
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,466
I got no coordinates...

161
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,386
no clues, no strategies, no options.

162
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,263
Zero. Zip. Nada.

163
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,181
No trust, liar.

164
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:08,979
Here, take this.

165
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,273
You find him, you put that on...

166
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,275
you hide.

167
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,278
- Tony! - I'm fine.

168
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,155
Let me...

169
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,954
Bruce gave him a sedative.

170
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,831
He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.

171
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,375
You guys take care of him...

172
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,085
and I'll bring him a Xorrian elixir when I come back.

173
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,670
Where are you going?

174
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,505
To kill Thanos.

175
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,676
Hey.

176
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,970
You know, we usually work as a team here...

177
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,805
and, between you and I, morale's a little fragile.

178
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:47,559
We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight, too.

179
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,894
You even know where he is?

180
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,228
I know people who might.

181
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,730
Don't bother.

182
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,441
I can tell you where Thanos is.

183
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,947
Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me.

184
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:04,618
And when he worked, he talked about his Great Plan.

185
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,871
Even disassembled, I wanted to please him.

186
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,456
I'd ask...

187
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,668
where would we go once his plan was complete?

188
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,170
And his answer was always the same.

189
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:20,384
"To the Garden."

190
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,762
That's cute. Thanos has a retirement plan.

191
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,472
So, where is he?

192
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,891
When Thanos snapped his fingers...

193
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:31,937
Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

194
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,314
No one's ever seen anything like it.

195
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,816
Until two days ago...

196
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,236
on this planet.

197
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,446
Thanos is there.

198
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,866
He used the stones again.

199
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:46,535
Hey, hey, hey.

200
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,912
We'd be going in shorthanded, you know?

201
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,455
Look, he's still got the stones, so...

202
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,165
So, let's get 'em.

203
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,709
Use them to bring everyone back.

204
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,960
Just like that?

205
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,712
Yeah. Just like that.

206
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,048
Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this...

207
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,926
I mean, we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.

208
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:07,055
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before?

209
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,849
Because before you didn't have me.

210
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:10,892
Hey, new girl?

211
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,770
Everybody in this room is about that superhero life.

212
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,565
And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time?

213
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:19,151
There are a lot of other planets in the universe.

214
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,195
And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys.

215
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,925
I like this one.

216
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,932
Let's go get this son of a bitch.

217
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:13,705
Okay.

218
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,500
Who here hasn't been to space?

219
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,002
Why?

220
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,837
You better not throw up on my ship.

221
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,297
Approaching jump in three...

222
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,549
two, one.

223
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,815
I'll head down for recon.

224
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,543
This is gonna work, Steve.

225
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,503
I know it will.

226
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,634
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

227
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,721
No satellites. No ships. No armies.

228
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,390
No ground defenses of any kind.

229
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,144
It's just him.

230
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,521
And that's enough.

231
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:49,986
Oh, no.

232
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,206
Where are they?

233
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,041
Answer the question.

234
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,879
The universe required correction.

235
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:11,841
After that, the stones served no purpose...

236
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,635
beyond temptation.

237
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,762
You murdered trillions!

238
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,306
You should be grateful.

239
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,437
Where are the stones?

240
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,981
Gone.

241
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,232
Reduced to atoms.

242
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,401
You used them two days ago!

243
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,779
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

244
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,156
It nearly killed me.

245
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,326
But the work is done.

246
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,413
It always will be.

247
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:46,376
I am inevitable.

248
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,047
We have to tear this place apart. He has to be lying!

249
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,424
My father is many things.

250
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,385
A liar is not one of them.

251
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,724
Thank you, daughter.

252
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,520
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

253
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,028
What?

254
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,447
What did you do?

255
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,783
I went for the head.

256
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,856
So...

257
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:35,652
...I went on a date the other day.

258
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,487
It's the first time in five years.

259
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,989
You know? I'm sitting there at dinner.

260
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,201
I didn't even know what to talk about.

261
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:45,745
What did you talk about?

262
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,582
Same old crap. You know, how things have changed.

263
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,835
My job, his job.

264
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,712
How much we miss the Mets.

265
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:58,675
And then things got quiet...

266
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,389
then he cried as they were serving the salads.

267
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:06,057
What about you?

268
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:10,395
I cried just before dessert.

269
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,276
But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...

270
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,194
That's great.

271
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,946
You did the hardest part. You took the jump.

272
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,240
You didn't know where you were gonna come down.

273
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:27,162
And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take...

274
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:31,040
to try and become whole again, try and find purpose.

275
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:36,880
I went in the ice in '45, right after I met the love of my life.

276
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,507
Woke up 70 years later.

277
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,679
You gotta move on.

278
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,017
Gotta move on.

279
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,274
The world is in our hands.

280
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,526
It's left to us, guys.

281
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,904
And we gotta do something with it.

282
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,031
Otherwise...

283
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,659
Thanos should've killed all of us.

284
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:09,931
What the hell?

285
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,570
Hope?

286
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,770
Kid!

287
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:58,980
Hey, kid!

288
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,528
What the hell happened here?

289
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,978
Oh, my God!

290
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,274
Oh, please!

291
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,984
Please, please!

292
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,153
No, no, no. No.

293
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:49,989
No.

294
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,326
Excuse me. Sorry.

295
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:54,786
Cassie, no.

296
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,412
No, no, no.

297
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,499
No, no.

298
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,336
Please, please, please. No, Cassie.

299
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:11,719
What?

300
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,126
Cassie?

301
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,670
Dad?

302
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,448
You're so big!

303
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,924
Yeah. We boarded that highly-suspect warship Danvers pinged.

304
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,801
It was an infectious garbage scow.

305
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,428
So, thanks for the hot tip.

306
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:36,929
Well, you were closer.

307
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,389
Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.

308
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:39,891
You get a reading on those tremors?

309
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,643
'Twas a mild subduction under the African plate.

310
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,854
Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?

311
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:46,189
Nat.

312
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,608
It's an earthquake under the ocean.

313
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:51,611
We handle it by not handling it.

314
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,489
Carol, are we seeing you here next month?

315
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,658
-Not likely. - What? You gonna get another haircut?

316
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,160
Listen, fur face.

317
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:01,120
I'm covering a lot of territory.

318
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:04,415
The things that are happening on Earth are happening everywhere.

319
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:06,584
On thousands of planets.

320
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:09,420
All right, all right. That's a good point. That's a good point.

321
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,672
So, you might not see me for a long time.

322
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:14,175
All right. Well...

323
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:17,178
This channel's always active.

324
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,430
So, if anything goes sideways...

325
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:22,016
anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't...

326
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:23,351
comes through me.

327
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:24,977
Okay.

328
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,604
All right.

329
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:28,439
Good luck.

330
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,032
Where are you?

331
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,200
Mexico.

332
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,994
The Federates found a room full of bodies.

333
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,788
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys...

334
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:45,915
never even had a chance to get their guns off

335
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,792
It's probably a rival gang.

336
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,168
Except it isn't.

337
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,504
It's definitely Barton.

338
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,673
What he's done here...

339
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,009
what he's been doing for the last few years...

340
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:59,637
I mean, the scene that he left...

341
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:04,183
I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even wanna find him.

342
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:12,024
Will you find out where he's going next?

343
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,071
Nat?

344
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:20,575
Please?

345
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,494
Okay.

346
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:34,130
You know, I'd offer to cook you dinner...

347
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,048
but you seem pretty miserable already.

348
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,554
You here to do your laundry?

349
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:43,306
And to see a friend.

350
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,059
Clearly, your friend is fine.

351
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:52,315
You know, I saw a pod of whales when I was coming over the bridge.

352
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,317
- In the Hudson? - There's fewer ships...

353
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,735
cleaner water.

354
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:59,822
You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side...

355
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,786
I'm about to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich.

356
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:08,915
Sorry.

357
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,249
Force of habit.

358
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,642
You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on...

359
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,477
and grow.

360
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:31,979
Some do.

361
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,943
But not us.

362
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,737
If I move on, who does this?

363
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,239
Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

364
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,704
I used to have nothing.

365
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,791
And then I got this.

366
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,795
This job.

367
00:29:58,172 --> 00:29:59,924
This family.

368
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,598
And I was better because of it.

369
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:17,400
And even though they're gone...

370
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:23,781
I'm still trying to be better.

371
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,245
I think we both need to get a life.

372
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,082
You first.

373
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:41,090
Hi, hi! Is anyone home?

374
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:42,967
This is Scott Lang.

375
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:45,970
We met a few years ago at the airport...

376
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:47,805
in Germany?

377
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:50,266
I was the guy that got really big. I had a mask on.

378
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:51,934
- You wouldn't recognize me. - Is this an old message?

379
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:55,062
Ant-Man? I know you know that.

380
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:57,815
- It's the front gate. - I really need to talk to you guys.

381
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:05,156
Scott.

382
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,116
Are you okay?

383
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:08,284
Yeah.

384
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,455
Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics?

385
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:14,373
Only to make conversation.

386
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,084
All right, so...

387
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,171
five years ago, right before...

388
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:21,881
Thanos...

389
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,341
I was in a place called the quantum realm.

390
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:27,011
The quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe.

391
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:29,305
To get in there, you have to be incredibly small.

392
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:31,015
Hope. She's my...

393
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,810
She was my...

394
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,730
She was supposed to pull me out.

395
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,482
And then Thanos happened...

396
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,317
and I got stuck in there.

397
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,736
I'm sorry, that must have been a very long five years.

398
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,237
Yeah, but that's just it.

399
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,572
It wasn't.

400
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:47,948
For me, it was five hours.

401
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,534
See, the rules of the quantum realm aren't like they are up here.

402
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,244
Everything is unpredictable.

403
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,621
Is that anybody's sandwich?

404
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:55,039
I'm starving.

405
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,499
Scott.

406
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,958
What are you talking about?

407
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,211
So...

408
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,755
what I'm saying is...

409
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:06,050
time works differently in the quantum realm.

410
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:09,512
The only problem is right now we don't have a way to navigate it.

411
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:10,679
But what if we did?

412
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,642
I can't stop thinking about it. What if we could somehow control the chaos...

413
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:15,935
and we could navigate it?

414
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:17,603
What if there was a way...

415
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,564
that we could enter the quantum realm at a certain point in time...

416
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:23,442
but then exit the quantum realm at another point in time?

417
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:24,944
Like...

418
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,780
- Like before Thanos. - Wait.

419
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:29,532
Are you talking about a time machine?

420
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,451
No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine.

421
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,661
This is more like a...

422
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,623
Yeah. Like a time machine.

423
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,583
I know, it's crazy. It's crazy.

424
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,129
But I can't stop thinking about it. There's gotta be...

425
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,172
some way...

426
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,133
- It's crazy. - Scott.

427
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,592
I get emails from a raccoon...

428
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,761
so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

429
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,597
So, who do we talk to about this?

430
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:12,783
Chow time!

431
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,287
Maguna.

432
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,084
Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch?

433
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:25,462
- Define "lunch" or be disintegrated. - Okay.

434
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,299
You should not be wearing that, okay?

435
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:31,010
That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom.

436
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,349
There you go. You thinking about lunch?

437
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,435
I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.

438
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:41,312
- No. - That's what you want.

439
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,606
How did you find this?

440
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,608
- Garage. - Really?

441
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,776
- Were you looking for it? - No.

442
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,529
I found it, though.

443
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,448
You like going in the garage, huh?

444
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:53,866
So does Daddy.

445
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:57,453
It's fine, actually. Mom never wears anything I buy her.

446
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,415
So, I'm gonna...

447
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:21,477
No. We know what it sounds like.

448
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,312
Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?

449
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,981
Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale...

450
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,943
which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?

451
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,194
Thank you.

452
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:32,488
In layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.

453
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,073
- I did. - No.

454
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,658
You accidentally survived.

455
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,369
It's a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.

456
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,622
And now you wanna pull a... What do you call it?

457
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,000
A time heist?

458
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:48,504
Yeah, a time heist. Of course. Why didn't we think of this before?

459
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:51,131
Oh, because it's laughable. Because it's a pipe dream.

460
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:54,885
The stones are in the past. We could go back, we could get them.

461
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:57,346
We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back.

462
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:59,431
Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?

463
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,599
I don't believe we would.

464
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,727
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.

465
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,313
However, high hopes won't help...

466
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,986
if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist.

467
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,989
I believe the most likely outcome will be our collective demise.

468
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:18,033
Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel.

469
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,786
All right? It means no talking to our past selves...

470
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,496
no betting on sporting events.

471
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:24,415
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott.

472
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:28,585
Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe...

473
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,421
is based on Back to the Future?

474
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:33,299
- Is it? - No.

475
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,634
Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that would be horseshit.

476
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,095
That's not how quantum physics works.

477
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,430
Tony.

478
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,850
We have to take a stand.

479
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,394
We did stand. And yet, here we are.

480
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,023
I know you got a lot on the line.

481
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:52,067
You got a wife, a daughter.

482
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,737
But I lost someone very important to me.

483
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,488
A lotta people did.

484
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,658
And now, now we have a chance to bring her back...

485
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,494
to bring everyone back, and you're telling me that you won't even...

486
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,455
That's right, Scott. I won't even.

487
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:07,499
I can't.

488
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,920
Mommy told me to come and save you.

489
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,506
Good job. I'm saved.

490
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:18,427
I wish you were coming here to ask me something else. Anything else.

491
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,387
I'm honestly happy to see you guys, I just...

492
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,181
- Oh, look, the table's set for six. - Tony.

493
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:23,432
I get it.

494
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,893
And I'm happy for you. I really am.

495
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,187
But this is a second chance.

496
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:31,315
I got my second chance right here, Cap.

497
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:33,025
Can't roll the dice on it.

498
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,029
If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.

499
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:41,492
Well, he's scared.

500
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,202
He's not wrong.

501
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,371
Yeah, but, I mean, what are we gonna do?

502
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,830
We need him. What, are we gonna stop?

503
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,750
No, I wanna do it right.

504
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,630
We're gonna need a really big brain.

505
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:56,924
Bigger than his?

506
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:00,219
Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating here. Try some of that.

507
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:01,387
Have some eggs.

508
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,138
I'm so confused.

509
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:04,973
These are confusing times.

510
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,059
Right, no, no. That's not what I meant.

511
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,728
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

512
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,106
I know, it's crazy.

513
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:13,482
I'm wearing shirts now.

514
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:16,485
Yeah. What? How? Why?

515
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:19,279
Five years ago, we got our asses beat.

516
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,532
Except it was worse for me...

517
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:22,908
'cause I lost twice.

518
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:24,868
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...

519
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,995
and then, we all lost.

520
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,414
No one blamed you, Bruce.

521
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,957
I did.

522
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,086
For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease...

523
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:35,712
something to get rid of.

524
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:39,133
But then, I start looking at him as the cure.

525
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,844
Eighteen months in the gamma lab.

526
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,596
I put the brains and the brawn together...

527
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,014
and now, look at me.

528
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,392
Best of both worlds.

529
00:37:49,143 --> 00:37:50,477
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk? - Yes.

530
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:51,979
Can we get a photo?

531
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:54,398
100%, little person.

532
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:56,608
Come on, step on up. Do you mind?

533
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,986
- Oh, yeah, yeah. - Thanks.

534
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:00,737
Say "green."

535
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,157
- Green. - Green.

536
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,241
Did you get that?

537
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:05,659
That's a good one.

538
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:08,704
Did you want to grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.

539
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:14,293
They're Hulk fans. They don't know Ant-Man.

540
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,544
Nobody does.

541
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,254
- No, he wants you to take a picture with him. - I don't want a picture.

542
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:18,422
Stranger danger.

543
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:20,132
Yeah, look, he's even saying no, he doesn't.

544
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,342
- I get it. I don't want it, either. - But come on. The kid...

545
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,927
I don't want a picture with them.

546
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,095
- He's gonna feel bad. - Sorry.

547
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:26,430
They're happy to do it. They said they'll do it.

548
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:28,056
- I don't want to do it. - We can do it.

549
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,225
- No, you feel bad. - Take the goddamn phone.

550
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:31,560
Okay.

551
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:34,396
- Thank you, Mr. Hulk. - No, it was great, kids. Thank you very much.

552
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:36,231
Hulk out!

553
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:37,274
Bruce.

554
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:38,859
Dab.

555
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:40,819
- Bruce. - Listen to your mom.

556
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:42,196
She knows better.

557
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,031
About what we were saying.

558
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:45,407
Right.

559
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,037
The whole time travel do-over?

560
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,083
Guys, it's outside of my area of expertise.

561
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:56,793
Well, you pulled this off.

562
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:01,632
I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible, too.

563
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:37,751
I've got a mild inspiration. I'd like to see if it checks out.

564
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:41,672
So, I'd like to run one last sim before we pack it in for the night.

565
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:46,218
This time, in the shape of a Mobius strip, inverted, please.

566
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,469
Processing.

567
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:53,433
Right, give me the eigenvalue of that particle...

568
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,602
factoring in spectral decomp.

569
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,729
- That'll take a second. - Just a moment.

570
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:01,650
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda...

571
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,695
Model rendered.

572
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:17,332
Shit!

573
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:18,709
Shit!

574
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,840
What are you doing up, little miss?

575
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:26,717
- Shit. - Nope. We don't say that.

576
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,093
Only Mommy says that word.

577
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,678
She coined it. It belongs to her.

578
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:30,804
Why are you up?

579
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,347
'Cause I've got some important shit going on here!

580
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:33,682
Why do you think?

581
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:36,810
No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind.

582
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:38,520
Was it juice pops?

583
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,273
Sure was.

584
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:44,443
That's extortion. That's a word.

585
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,777
What kind you want?

586
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:46,945
Great minds think alike.

587
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,947
Juice pops exactly...

588
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,242
was on my mind.

589
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,786
You done? Yeah?

590
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:56,538
Now you are.

591
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,290
Here. Wipe.

592
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,670
Good. That face goes there.

593
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:05,088
Tell me a story.

594
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:06,840
A story.

595
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:09,134
Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.

596
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:10,886
That is a horrible story.

597
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:12,804
Come on, that's your favorite story.

598
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:14,681
Love you tons.

599
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,518
I love you 3,000.

600
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,771
Wow.

601
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:30,989
3,000. That's crazy.

602
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,992
Go to bed or I'll sell all your toys.

603
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:36,536
Night night.

604
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:37,913
Not that it's a competition...

605
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,332
but she loves me 3,000.

606
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:41,583
Does she, now?

607
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,795
You were somewhere in the low 6 to 900 range.

608
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,344
Whatcha reading?

609
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,429
Just a book on composting.

610
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,682
What's new with composting?

611
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,185
- Interesting science... - I figured it out.

612
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,270
By the way.

613
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:06,525
And, you know, just so we're talking about the same thing...

614
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:08,151
Time travel.

615
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:09,653
What?

616
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:14,866
Wow.

617
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,497
That's amazing...

618
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:22,582
and terrifying.

619
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,209
That's right.

620
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:33,218
We got really lucky.

621
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:34,386
Yeah.

622
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:35,679
I know.

623
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:36,972
A lot of people didn't.

624
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:38,765
Nope. And I can't help everybody.

625
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,852
Sorta seems like you can.

626
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,645
Not if I stop.

627
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:47,691
I can put a pin in it right now and stop.

628
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:49,484
Tony...

629
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:51,737
trying to get you to stop...

630
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,531
has been one of the few failures of my entire life.

631
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:00,495
Something tells me...

632
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:04,458
I should put it in a lockbox and drop it to the bottom of the lake...

633
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:06,877
and go to bed.

634
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,302
But would you be able to rest?

635
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,351
Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one.

636
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,687
Scott, fire up...

637
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:27,773
the van thing.

638
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,109
Breakers are set.

639
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,111
Emergency generators are on standby.

640
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:38,200
Good, because if we blow the grid, I don't want to lose Tiny here in the 1950s.

641
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,201
Excuse me?

642
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,328
He's kidding.

643
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:43,455
You can't say things like that.

644
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:45,123
It was a bad joke.

645
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,084
You were kidding, right?

646
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:51,379
I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here.

647
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,799
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.

648
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,634
We're good!

649
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:57,135
Get your helmet on.

650
00:43:57,761 --> 00:43:59,554
Scott, I'm gonna send you back a week...

651
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,933
let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds.

652
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,100
Make sense?

653
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:06,019
Perfectly not confusing.

654
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:08,146
Good luck, Scott. You got this.

655
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,734
You're right. I do, Captain America.

656
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,238
On a count of three...

657
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:20,283
Three, two, one.

658
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:25,205
Guys?

659
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,541
This doesn't feel right.

660
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:28,542
What is this?

661
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:29,543
- What's going on? - Who is that?

662
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:30,544
- Hold on. - Is that Scott?

663
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,586
Yes, it's Scott.

664
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:37,008
- What's going on, Bruce? - Oh, my back!

665
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,134
- What is this? - Hold on a second.

666
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,553
- Could I get a little space here? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

667
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,596
- Can you bring him back? - I'm working on it.

668
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:49,646
It's a baby.

669
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:51,356
- It's Scott. - As a baby.

670
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:52,899
- He'll grow. - Bring Scott back.

671
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:54,442
When I say kill the power, kill the power.

672
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:55,861
Oh, my God.

673
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:57,946
And... kill it!

674
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,160
Somebody peed my pants.

675
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,287
Oh, thank God.

676
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,665
But I don't know if it was baby me or old me.

677
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:13,962
Or just me me.

678
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,589
Time travel!

679
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,343
What?

680
00:45:22,012 --> 00:45:24,264
I see this as an absolute win.

681
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:11,227
Why the long face?

682
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,146
Let me guess, he turned into a baby.

683
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,399
Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?

684
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:17,984
It's the EPR Paradox.

685
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:20,820
Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up...

686
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,405
pushing time through Lang.

687
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:25,241
It's tricky, dangerous. Somebody could have cautioned you against it.

688
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:26,368
You did.

689
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:27,744
Oh, did I?

690
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:29,579
Well, thank God I'm here.

691
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:31,998
Regardless, I fixed it.

692
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:35,377
A fully functioning time-space GPS.

693
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:38,713
I just want peace.

694
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,051
Turns out resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.

695
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:45,303
Me, too.

696
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:50,016
We got a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities.

697
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:52,519
Bring back what we lost, I hope, yes.

698
00:46:52,686 --> 00:46:55,522
Keep what I found, I have to, at all costs.

699
00:46:56,773 --> 00:46:59,359
And maybe not die trying.

700
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:00,568
Would be nice.

701
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,114
Sounds like a deal.

702
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:28,722
Tony, I don't know.

703
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,515
Why?

704
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:32,475
He made it for you.

705
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:36,229
Plus, honestly, I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.

706
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:42,902
Thank you, Tony.

707
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:45,447
Will you keep that a little quiet?

708
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:47,532
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

709
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:52,579
We are getting the whole team, yeah?

710
00:47:52,746 --> 00:47:54,497
We're working on that right now.

711
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:13,641
Hey, Humie.

712
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:15,977
Where's Big Green?

713
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:18,354
The kitchen, I think.

714
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:20,815
That's awesome.

715
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:24,110
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

716
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:25,987
There's an idiot in the landing zone.

717
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:28,281
Oh, God.

718
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:30,909
What's up, Regular-Sized Man?

719
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:26,047
Kind of a step down from the golden palaces and the magic hammers and whatnot.

720
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,549
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.

721
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,676
First, they lost Asgard, then half their people.

722
00:49:29,843 --> 00:49:31,386
They're probably just happy to have a home.

723
00:49:31,553 --> 00:49:33,263
You shouldn't have come.

724
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:36,349
Valkyrie!

725
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:39,227
Great to see you, angry girl!

726
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:41,604
I think I liked you better either of the other ways.

727
00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:44,649
- This is Rocket. - How ya doing?

728
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:48,069
He won't see you.

729
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:49,445
It's that bad, huh?

730
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:54,242
We only see him once a month when he comes in for "supplies."

731
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:56,452
It's that bad.

732
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:57,620
Yeah.

733
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:11,176
What the...?

734
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:16,306
Something died in here!

735
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,642
Hello? Thor!

736
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:21,853
Are you here about the cable?

737
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:24,689
The Cinemax went out two weeks ago...

738
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:28,026
and the sports are all kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

739
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:29,777
Thor?

740
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:40,288
Boys! Oh, my God!

741
00:50:40,914 --> 00:50:43,666
Oh, my God, it's so good to see you!

742
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,419
Come here, cuddly little rascal.

743
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:48,171
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

744
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:50,298
That's not necessary.

745
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:53,426
Hulk, you know my friends Miek and Korg, right?

746
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:54,719
- Hey, boys! - Hey, guys.

747
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:56,137
Long time no see.

748
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:58,556
Beer's in the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi.

749
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,433
No password, obviously.

750
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:03,019
Thor, he's back.

751
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:05,855
That kid on the TV just called me a dickhead again.

752
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,440
Noobmaster.

753
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:10,068
Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead.

754
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:11,402
I am sick of this.

755
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,240
Noobmaster, hey, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder.

756
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,575
Listen, bud, if you don't log off this game immediately...

757
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:20,870
I am gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in...

758
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:23,665
rip off your arms, and shove them up your butt!

759
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,085
Oh, that's right, yes! Go cry to your father, you little weasel.

760
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:28,795
Thank you, Thor.

761
00:51:28,962 --> 00:51:30,296
Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?

762
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:31,673
Thank you very much. I will.

763
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:33,967
So, you guys want a drink? What are we drinking?

764
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,552
I've got beer, tequila, all sorts of things.

765
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,848
Buddy.

766
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:41,975
You all right?

767
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,476
Yes, I'm fine. Why?

768
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:44,686
Why, don't I look all right?

769
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:46,521
You look like melted ice cream.

770
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:50,608
So, what's up? You just here for a hang, or what?

771
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,068
We need your help.

772
00:51:52,986 --> 00:51:55,280
There might be a chance we could fix everything.

773
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:56,781
What, like the cable?

774
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:59,158
'Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks.

775
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,326
Like Thanos.

776
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:22,348
Don't say that name.

777
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:26,185
Yeah, we don't actually say that name in here.

778
00:52:31,024 --> 00:52:32,900
Please take your hand off me.

779
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:39,365
Now, I know that guy...

780
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:41,409
might scare you.

781
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:42,952
Why would I be...?

782
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,289
Why would I be scared of that guy?

783
00:52:46,456 --> 00:52:48,291
I'm the one who killed that guy, remember?

784
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,502
Anyone else here kill that guy?

785
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,007
Nope.

786
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:57,550
Didn't think so.

787
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:02,889
Korg, why don't you tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off?

788
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:04,474
Storm breaker?

789
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,267
Who was swinging Storm breaker?

790
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:12,565
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?

791
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:13,733
I've been there myself.

792
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,194
And you want to know who helped me out of it?

793
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:18,696
Was it Natasha?

794
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:21,032
It was you.

795
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:23,159
You helped me.

796
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:25,828
So, why don't you ask...

797
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:29,248
the Asgardians down there...

798
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:31,125
how much my help is worth?

799
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:38,257
The ones that are left, anyway.

800
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,385
I think we could bring them back.

801
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:42,303
Stop.

802
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,514
Stop, okay?

803
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:48,184
I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity...

804
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:50,895
waiting to be rescued and saved...

805
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:53,147
but I'm fine, okay. We're fine, aren't we?

806
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:54,774
We're good here, mate.

807
00:53:54,941 --> 00:53:56,901
So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it.

808
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:58,569
Don't care. Couldn't care less.

809
00:53:58,736 --> 00:53:59,821
Goodbye.

810
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:04,909
We need you, pal.

811
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:16,337
There's beer on the ship.

812
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,009
What kind?

813
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:37,108
It's him! He's after Akihiko!

814
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:06,012
Why are you doing this?

815
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,307
We never did anything to you!

816
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:10,933
You survived...

817
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:13,060
Half the planet didn't.

818
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:14,979
They got Thanos.

819
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:16,564
You get me...

820
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,863
You're done hurting people.

821
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:27,033
WE hurt people?

822
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,496
You're crazy!

823
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:02,777
Wait! Help me!

824
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:05,738
I'll give you anything!

825
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,115
What do you want?

826
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,369
What I want you can't give me.

827
00:56:35,268 --> 00:56:36,435
You shouldn't be here.

828
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,898
Neither should you.

829
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,364
I've got a job to do.

830
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:51,576
Is that what you're calling this?

831
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,079
Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.

832
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:02,003
We found something.

833
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:05,840
A chance, maybe.

834
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:10,386
Don't.

835
00:57:11,304 --> 00:57:12,763
Don't what?

836
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:17,268
Don't give me hope.

837
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:23,065
I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.

838
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:45,921
You're drifting left.

839
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,215
One side there, Lebowski.

840
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:52,720
Ratchet, how's it going?

841
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:53,888
It's Rocket.

842
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:56,599
Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal.

843
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,105
Time travel suit, not bad.

844
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:05,983
Hey, hey, hey! Easy! Easy!

845
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,151
I'm being very careful.

846
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:08,736
No, you're being very Hulky.

847
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:09,820
I'm being careful.

848
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,364
These are Pym Particles, all right?

849
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,033
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it.

850
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,951
This is what we have. We're not making any more.

851
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:18,037
- Scott, calm down. - Sorry.

852
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:21,332
We've got enough for one round-trip each. That's it.

853
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:22,541
No do-overs.

854
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:24,919
Plus two test runs.

855
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:29,924
One test run.

856
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,843
All right. I'm not ready for this.

857
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,303
I'm game.

858
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,265
I'll do it.

859
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:41,894
Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift.

860
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:43,938
- Don't worry about that. - Wait a second. Let me ask you something.

861
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:45,731
If we can do this, you know...

862
00:58:45,898 --> 00:58:48,234
go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos?

863
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:49,568
You know, and...

864
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:55,449
- First of all, that's horrible. - It's Thanos.

865
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:57,910
And secondly, time doesn't work that way.

866
00:58:58,077 --> 00:59:00,246
Changing the past doesn't change the future.

867
00:59:00,413 --> 00:59:03,124
Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them...

868
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:06,043
Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved.

869
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,045
- Bingo. - That's not how it works.

870
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,339
- Well, that's what I heard. - Wait, but who? Who told you that?

871
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:12,299
Star Trek, Terminator, Timecop...

872
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,051
-Time After Time. - Quantum Leap.

873
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:16,262
-Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time. - Hot Tub Time Machine.

874
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:18,806
Hot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

875
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:21,058
Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.

876
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:23,060
Die Hard. No, that's not one.

877
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:24,270
This is known.

878
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,689
I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true.

879
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:28,858
Think about it. If you travel to the past...

880
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:31,360
that past becomes your future...

881
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:34,488
and your former present becomes the past...

882
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:37,283
which can't now be changed by your new future.

883
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:38,659
Exactly.

884
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:42,121
So Back to the Future is a bunch of bullshit?

885
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,460
All right, Clint.

886
00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:51,172
We're going in three, two...

887
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:52,339
one.

888
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:06,038
Cooper?

889
01:01:06,205 --> 01:01:07,748
Where are my headphones?

890
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:08,833
Lila?

891
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,085
- I never had them. - Lila?

892
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:13,838
Yeah, you had them yesterday!

893
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:15,714
Lila! Lila!

894
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,221
Yeah, Dad?

895
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,142
Dad?

896
01:01:29,645 --> 01:01:30,938
Lila!

897
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:39,196
Hey. Hey, look at me.

898
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:40,489
You okay?

899
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,242
Yeah. Yeah.

900
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,328
It worked.

901
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,456
It worked.

902
01:01:52,585 --> 01:01:54,420
Okay, so the how works.

903
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:58,132
Now, we gotta figure out the when and the where.

904
01:01:58,966 --> 01:02:00,759
Almost everyone in this room has had an encounter...

905
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,595
with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.

906
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:04,263
Or substitute the word "encounter"...

907
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,016
for "damn near been killed" by one of the six Infinity Stones.

908
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:08,350
Well, I haven't...

909
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:10,853
but I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about.

910
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:15,774
Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round-trip each.

911
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:19,153
And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.

912
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,613
Our history.

913
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:23,782
So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in, yeah?

914
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,743
Which means we have to pick our targets.

915
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:27,453
Correct.

916
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:30,414
So, let's start with the Aether.

917
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:31,790
Thor, what do you know?

918
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:38,589
Is he asleep?

919
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:41,300
No, no. I'm pretty sure he's dead.

920
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,930
Where to start?

921
01:02:47,723 --> 01:02:50,267
The Aether, firstly, is not a stone.

922
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:52,561
Someone called it a stone before.

923
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:57,942
It's more of an angry sludge sort of a thing...

924
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:00,986
so someone's gonna need to amend that and stop saying that.

925
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,989
Here's an interesting story, though, about the Aether.

926
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:06,033
My grandfather, many years ago...

927
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,703
had to hide the stone from the Dark Elves.

928
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:12,581
Scary beings.

929
01:03:12,748 --> 01:03:14,458
So, Jane, actually...

930
01:03:15,042 --> 01:03:16,585
Oh, there she is.

931
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:20,422
Yeah, so Jane was an old flame of mine.

932
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:24,635
You know, she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time...

933
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:27,638
and then the Aether stuck itself inside her...

934
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,848
and she became very, very sick.

935
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:33,143
And so I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from...

936
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,270
and we had to try and fix her.

937
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,064
We were dating at the time, you see...

938
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:40,609
and I got to introduce her to my mother...

939
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:43,988
who's dead and...

940
01:03:45,406 --> 01:03:48,951
Oh, you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, so...

941
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:51,203
Yes, these things happen, though. You know?

942
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:52,705
Nothing lasts forever. The only thing that...

943
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:54,623
- Why don't you come sit down? - I'm not done yet.

944
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:57,835
The only thing that is permanent in life is impermanence.

945
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,879
Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?

946
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,090
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

947
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:05,384
Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.

948
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,179
- Is that a person? - No, Morag's a planet.

949
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:11,265
Quill was a person.

950
01:04:12,016 --> 01:04:14,351
Like a planet? Like in outer space?

951
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:18,731
Oh, look. It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything.

952
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:22,067
Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy?

953
01:04:22,234 --> 01:04:23,360
I'll take you to space.

954
01:04:24,737 --> 01:04:26,655
Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.

955
01:04:26,822 --> 01:04:28,782
What is Vormir?

956
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:30,117
A dominion of death...

957
01:04:30,826 --> 01:04:32,703
at the very center of celestial existence.

958
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:38,625
It's where Thanos murdered my sister.

959
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:46,091
Not it.

960
01:04:47,843 --> 01:04:49,470
- That Time Stone guy. - Doctor Strange.

961
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,430
Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?

962
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:53,557
Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit-from-hat.

963
01:04:53,724 --> 01:04:55,017
Nice place in the Village, though.

964
01:04:55,184 --> 01:04:56,769
Yeah, on Sullivan Street?

965
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:57,936
Bleecker Street.

966
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,188
Wait, he lived in New York?

967
01:04:59,855 --> 01:05:01,899
- No, he lived in Toronto. - Yeah, on Bleecker and Sullivan.

968
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:03,859
- Have you been listening to anything? - Guys.

969
01:05:04,026 --> 01:05:07,571
If you pick the right year, there are three stones in New York.

970
01:05:10,032 --> 01:05:11,742
Shut the front door.

971
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,622
All right. We have a plan.

972
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:21,376
Six stones, three teams, one shot.

973
01:05:31,095 --> 01:05:32,971
Five years ago, we lost.

974
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:35,599
All of us.

975
01:05:37,518 --> 01:05:38,894
We lost friends.

976
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:41,271
We lost family.

977
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:45,067
We lost a part of ourselves.

978
01:05:46,527 --> 01:05:48,862
Today, we have a chance to take it all back.

979
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,117
You know your teams. You know your missions.

980
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:55,869
Get the stones. Get them back.

981
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:57,871
One round-trip each.

982
01:05:58,038 --> 01:05:59,123
No mistakes...

983
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,333
no do-overs.

984
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,377
Most of us are going somewhere we know.

985
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:05,379
That doesn't mean we should know what to expect.

986
01:06:06,547 --> 01:06:07,548
Be careful.

987
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:09,466
Look out for each other.

988
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:12,719
This is the fight of our lives...

989
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,180
and we're gonna win.

990
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:18,350
Whatever it takes.

991
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,063
Good luck.

992
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:24,314
He's pretty good at that.

993
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:25,649
- Right? - All right.

994
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:28,152
You heard the man. Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.

995
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:30,654
Trackers engaged.

996
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:33,282
You promise to bring that back in one piece, right?

997
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:34,783
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

998
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:36,827
Okay, I'll do my best.

999
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:38,787
As promises go, that was pretty lame.

1000
01:06:41,874 --> 01:06:43,000
See ya in a minute.

1001
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:38,722
All right, we all have our assignments.

1002
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:41,099
Two stones uptown, one stone down.

1003
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:43,227
Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.

1004
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:00,452
Maybe smash a few things along the way.

1005
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,580
I think it's gratuitous, but whatever.

1006
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:34,486
I'd be careful going that way. We just had the floors waxed.

1007
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:41,451
Yeah, I'm looking for Doctor Strange.

1008
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,914
You're about five years too early.

1009
01:08:46,707 --> 01:08:50,419
Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery about 20 blocks that way.

1010
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:53,213
What do you want from him?

1011
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:55,132
That, actually.

1012
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,344
I'm afraid not.

1013
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,138
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1014
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,056
You don't want to do this.

1015
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:04,808
You're right, I don't. But I need that stone...

1016
01:09:04,975 --> 01:09:06,476
and I don't have time to debate it.

1017
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,070
Let's start over, shall we?

1018
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,125
For you, Lady Jane.

1019
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:32,669
Do you have anything with pants?

1020
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:33,879
Pants?

1021
01:09:34,046 --> 01:09:36,131
Never mind. These will be fine. Thank you.

1022
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:37,924
- Yes, milady. - There's Jane.

1023
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:40,552
All right.

1024
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:43,388
Here's the deal, tubby.

1025
01:09:43,555 --> 01:09:45,932
You're gonna charm her, and I'm gonna poke her with this thing...

1026
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,560
and extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split.

1027
01:09:50,312 --> 01:09:53,273
I'll be right back, okay? The wine cellar is just down here.

1028
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:56,318
My father used to have this huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1029
01:09:56,485 --> 01:09:57,736
I'll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups.

1030
01:09:57,903 --> 01:09:59,780
Hey. Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?

1031
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:09,081
- If you could send Loki some soup. - Yes, milady.

1032
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:13,251
And ask our librarians to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelf.

1033
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:20,967
Who's the fancy broad?

1034
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:23,804
That's my mother.

1035
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:26,014
She dies today.

1036
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,475
Oh, that is today?

1037
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:37,567
I can't do this. I can't do this.

1038
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:39,694
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.

1039
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:40,987
It's a bad idea!

1040
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,322
- Come here. - No, no, no.

1041
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:44,908
I think I'm having a panic attack.

1042
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:47,077
- Come here. Right here. - I shouldn't be here. This is bad.

1043
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,496
You think you're the only one who lost people?

1044
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:51,498
What do you think we're doing here?

1045
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:53,834
I lost the only family I ever had.

1046
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,420
Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna...

1047
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,004
all gone.

1048
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:00,048
I get you miss your mom...

1049
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,550
but she's gone.

1050
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:02,717
Really gone.

1051
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:06,138
And there are plenty of people who are only kind of gone...

1052
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:07,431
and you can help them.

1053
01:11:08,557 --> 01:11:11,768
So, is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs out of your beard...

1054
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:14,229
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants...

1055
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:17,566
and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone...

1056
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:19,317
and help me get my family back?

1057
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:21,987
Okay.

1058
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:23,280
Are you crying?

1059
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,198
No.

1060
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,201
Yes.

1061
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:29,578
I feel like I'm losing it.

1062
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:30,745
Get it together!

1063
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:31,913
You can do this.

1064
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:34,416
You can do this.

1065
01:11:37,586 --> 01:11:38,587
All right?

1066
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:39,754
Yes, I can.

1067
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:40,922
Good.

1068
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:45,469
I can do this. I can do this.

1069
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:47,762
I can't do this.

1070
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:51,349
All right, heart breaker, she's alone. This is our shot.

1071
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,102
Thor? Thor!

1072
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:05,739
All right, bring it down, Blue.

1073
01:12:05,906 --> 01:12:08,325
Right on that line. That's it. Down, down.

1074
01:12:13,622 --> 01:12:14,664
Hey, can we hurry it up?

1075
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,917
Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on the clock.

1076
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,835
All that is really helpful.

1077
01:12:21,046 --> 01:12:22,547
- Take care, okay? - Yeah.

1078
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:25,175
Get that stone and come back. No messing around.

1079
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:27,385
- Hey. - We got this.

1080
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:28,762
- Let's get it done. - Yes, sir.

1081
01:12:28,929 --> 01:12:30,222
I'll see you back.

1082
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:32,265
You guys watch each other's six.

1083
01:12:32,933 --> 01:12:34,184
Yeah.

1084
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,402
Coordinates for Vormir are laid in.

1085
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,948
All they have to do is not fall out.

1086
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,248
We're a long way from Budapest.

1087
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,629
Okay, so...

1088
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,092
we just wait around for this Quill guy to show up...

1089
01:13:07,259 --> 01:13:09,094
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

1090
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:11,513
Let's take cover.

1091
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,600
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

1092
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:17,018
Wait a minute. What are you talking about right now?

1093
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:18,520
Who else is looking for these stones?

1094
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:23,567
My father...

1095
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,527
my sister...

1096
01:13:25,694 --> 01:13:26,820
and me.

1097
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:28,154
And you?

1098
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:31,616
Where are you right now?

1099
01:14:00,312 --> 01:14:01,479
You're welcome.

1100
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,940
I didn't ask for your help.

1101
01:14:04,608 --> 01:14:06,234
And yet, you always need it.

1102
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,282
Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.

1103
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:13,450
Why?

1104
01:14:13,617 --> 01:14:15,619
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1105
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,541
Where?

1106
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:23,460
On a planet called Morag.

1107
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:27,005
Father's plan is finally in motion.

1108
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:29,174
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1109
01:14:29,341 --> 01:14:30,550
It's a start.

1110
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:32,510
If he gets all of them...

1111
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:49,069
Ronan's located the Power Stone. I'm dispatching you to his ship.

1112
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,445
He won't like that.

1113
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:52,739
His alternative is death.

1114
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,992
Ronan's obsession...

1115
01:14:57,035 --> 01:14:59,204
clouds his judgment.

1116
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:05,418
We will not fail you, Father.

1117
01:15:06,461 --> 01:15:08,088
No, you won't.

1118
01:15:10,799 --> 01:15:11,800
I swear...

1119
01:15:13,677 --> 01:15:15,595
I will make you proud.

1120
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:27,649
...we just wait around for this Quill guy to show up...

1121
01:15:27,816 --> 01:15:29,818
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

1122
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:31,569
Let's take cover.

1123
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:35,448
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

1124
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,327
Who was that?

1125
01:15:39,494 --> 01:15:40,495
I don't know.

1126
01:15:40,662 --> 01:15:42,831
My head is splitting. I don't know.

1127
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,252
Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle.

1128
01:15:57,512 --> 01:15:59,556
Bring her to my ship.

1129
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:08,022
Better hustle, Cap.

1130
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:10,275
Things look like they're just about wrapped up here.

1131
01:16:10,442 --> 01:16:12,068
Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.

1132
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:20,118
If it's all the same to you...

1133
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:23,955
I'll have that drink now.

1134
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:25,957
All right, get him on his feet.

1135
01:16:26,124 --> 01:16:29,127
We can all stand around posing up a storm later.

1136
01:16:29,294 --> 01:16:30,628
By the way, feel free to clean up.

1137
01:16:31,546 --> 01:16:33,798
Mr. Rogers, I almost forgot that that suit...

1138
01:16:33,965 --> 01:16:35,884
did nothing for your ass.

1139
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:37,177
No one asked you to look, Tony.

1140
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:38,970
- It's ridiculous. - I think you look great, Cap.

1141
01:16:39,429 --> 01:16:41,931
As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass.

1142
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:44,058
Who gets the magic wand?

1143
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:45,268
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's coming to secure it.

1144
01:16:56,446 --> 01:16:58,198
We can take that off your hands.

1145
01:16:58,364 --> 01:16:59,365
By all means.

1146
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:03,328
Careful with that thing.

1147
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:04,954
Yeah, unless you want your mind erased.

1148
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:06,122
And not in a fun way.

1149
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:07,290
We promise to be careful.

1150
01:17:07,457 --> 01:17:08,458
Who are these guys?

1151
01:17:08,625 --> 01:17:09,918
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

1152
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:13,171
Well, actually Hydra, but we didn't know that yet.

1153
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:15,507
Seriously? You didn't?

1154
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:17,175
I mean, they look like bad guys.

1155
01:17:17,342 --> 01:17:18,760
You're small, but you're talking loud.

1156
01:17:18,927 --> 01:17:20,762
On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.

1157
01:17:20,929 --> 01:17:22,889
On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.

1158
01:17:23,056 --> 01:17:25,517
I mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down?

1159
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:27,101
Shut up.

1160
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:28,978
All right, you're up, little buddy.

1161
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:31,272
There's our stone.

1162
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:32,440
All right.

1163
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:33,775
Flick me.

1164
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:48,873
- Move. - Hey.

1165
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,792
Hey, hey. Buddy!

1166
01:17:50,959 --> 01:17:52,752
What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.

1167
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:53,920
Take the stairs.

1168
01:17:54,087 --> 01:17:55,964
Yeah. Stop, stop.

1169
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:01,511
"Take the stairs." Hate the stairs.

1170
01:18:05,223 --> 01:18:07,600
All right, Cap, I got our scepter in the elevator...

1171
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:09,561
just passing the 80th floor.

1172
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:11,354
On it.

1173
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:14,065
- Head to the lobby. - All right, I'll see you there.

1174
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,025
Evidence secure.

1175
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:17,610
We're en route to Doctor List.

1176
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:21,197
No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.

1177
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:27,370
Captain.

1178
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:29,581
I thought you were coordinating search and rescue.

1179
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,291
Change of plans.

1180
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:36,546
Hey, Cap.

1181
01:18:37,839 --> 01:18:38,882
Rumlow.

1182
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,015
I just got a call from the secretary.

1183
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:49,058
I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.

1184
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:53,813
Sir? I don't understand.

1185
01:18:56,274 --> 01:18:58,109
We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.

1186
01:18:58,276 --> 01:18:59,861
Sorry, Cap.

1187
01:19:00,028 --> 01:19:01,446
We can't give you the scepter.

1188
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:03,907
I'm gonna have to call the director.

1189
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,200
That's okay. Trust me.

1190
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:10,705
Hail Hydra.

1191
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:27,305
So many stairs!

1192
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:41,653
Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize.

1193
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:42,904
It is go time.

1194
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:44,072
Bombs away.

1195
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:53,706
Is that Axe Body Spray?

1196
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:56,084
Yeah, I had a can in the desk for emergencies. Relax.

1197
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:57,335
Can we focus, please?

1198
01:19:57,502 --> 01:19:58,753
I'm going inside you...

1199
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:00,463
now.

1200
01:20:06,344 --> 01:20:07,804
May I ask you where you're going?

1201
01:20:07,971 --> 01:20:10,223
Bit of lunch and then Asgard. I'm sorry, you are...?

1202
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:11,391
Alexander Pierce.

1203
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:14,018
He's the man above the folks behind Nick Fury.

1204
01:20:14,185 --> 01:20:15,311
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

1205
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,855
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.

1206
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:19,816
Loki will be answering to Odin himself.

1207
01:20:19,983 --> 01:20:22,360
No, he's going to answer to us. Odin can have what's left.

1208
01:20:22,527 --> 01:20:23,987
And I'm gonna need that case.

1209
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:25,947
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D. property for over 70 years.

1210
01:20:26,114 --> 01:20:27,323
Hand over the case, Stark.

1211
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:29,867
All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey out here. Let's go.

1212
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,744
I'm not gonna argue who's got the higher authority here...

1213
01:20:32,203 --> 01:20:33,496
You promise me you won't die?

1214
01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:36,374
We're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1215
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:38,126
That doesn't sound mild.

1216
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:39,293
I need the case.

1217
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:40,837
I know you got a lot of pull, I'm just saying, jurisdiction...

1218
01:20:41,004 --> 01:20:42,171
Okay, then give me the case.

1219
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:44,382
- Well, jurisdiction... - Hand it over.

1220
01:20:44,549 --> 01:20:45,466
Do it, Lang!

1221
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:47,427
- Get your hands off me. - Window's closing. Pull my pin.

1222
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:49,846
Here goes!

1223
01:20:52,682 --> 01:20:54,225
- Stark? - Stark?

1224
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,644
He's convulsing. Give him air!

1225
01:20:56,811 --> 01:20:58,521
- Medic! - Medic!

1226
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:00,440
Give these guys some help.

1227
01:21:00,815 --> 01:21:01,816
Speak to me.

1228
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:04,068
Stark, is it your chest machine?

1229
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:08,156
Breathe, breathe.

1230
01:21:13,411 --> 01:21:15,747
Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

1231
01:21:21,461 --> 01:21:23,171
No stairs!

1232
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:32,805
Come on, Stark, stay with us.

1233
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:34,932
I'm going to try something. Okay? I have no idea if it's going to work.

1234
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:37,810
Yes!

1235
01:21:37,977 --> 01:21:39,353
Oh, that worked a treat.

1236
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,521
Dude, that was so crazy.

1237
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:42,065
I had no idea if that was gonna work.

1238
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:44,108
- The case. - The case is...

1239
01:21:44,275 --> 01:21:46,277
Where's the case? Where's Loki?

1240
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:48,279
Loki!

1241
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:49,614
That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?

1242
01:21:49,781 --> 01:21:50,907
We blew it.

1243
01:21:51,074 --> 01:21:52,575
Loki?

1244
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:55,912
Tony, what's going on?

1245
01:21:56,913 --> 01:21:58,581
Tell me you found that Cube.

1246
01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:02,877
You gotta be shitting me.

1247
01:22:06,964 --> 01:22:09,175
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

1248
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:10,718
I'm not Loki...

1249
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:15,932
and I don't wanna hurt you.

1250
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:25,858
I can do this all day.

1251
01:22:26,025 --> 01:22:27,318
Yeah, I know.

1252
01:22:27,485 --> 01:22:28,486
I know.

1253
01:23:01,227 --> 01:23:02,228
Where did you get this?

1254
01:23:13,531 --> 01:23:16,576
Bucky is alive.

1255
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:21,164
What?

1256
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:37,638
That is America's ass.

1257
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:43,019
Please, please.

1258
01:23:43,186 --> 01:23:45,062
I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce.

1259
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:49,233
If I give up the Time Stone to help your reality, I'm dooming my own.

1260
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,152
With all due respect, all right...

1261
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:54,405
I'm not sure the science really supports that.

1262
01:24:00,036 --> 01:24:04,332
The Infinity Stones create what you experience as the flow of time.

1263
01:24:04,498 --> 01:24:06,042
Remove one of the stones...

1264
01:24:06,209 --> 01:24:08,294
and that flow splits.

1265
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:10,922
Now, this may benefit your reality...

1266
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:13,216
but my new one, not so much.

1267
01:24:13,591 --> 01:24:15,301
In this new branch reality...

1268
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:18,554
without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness...

1269
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:20,890
our world would be overrun.

1270
01:24:21,057 --> 01:24:22,767
Millions will suffer.

1271
01:24:22,934 --> 01:24:24,185
So, tell me, Doctor.

1272
01:24:24,769 --> 01:24:26,938
Can your science prevent all that?

1273
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:28,105
No...

1274
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:30,233
but we can erase it.

1275
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:32,109
Because once we're done with the stones...

1276
01:24:32,276 --> 01:24:34,445
we can return each one to its own timeline...

1277
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:36,113
at the moment it was taken.

1278
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,741
So, chronologically...

1279
01:24:39,784 --> 01:24:40,826
in that reality...

1280
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,081
it never left.

1281
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:50,544
Yes, but you're leaving out the most important part.

1282
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:56,592
In order to return the stones, you have to survive.

1283
01:24:56,759 --> 01:24:59,345
We will. I will. I promise.

1284
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:02,223
I can't risk this reality on a promise.

1285
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:08,521
It's the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone.

1286
01:25:08,896 --> 01:25:10,773
Then why the hell did Strange give it away?

1287
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:13,818
What did you say?

1288
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:16,320
Strange. He gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.

1289
01:25:16,946 --> 01:25:18,531
- Willingly? - Yes.

1290
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,036
- Why? - I have no idea.

1291
01:25:24,203 --> 01:25:25,955
Maybe he made a mistake.

1292
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:37,383
Or I did.

1293
01:25:57,653 --> 01:26:00,072
Strange is meant to be the best of us.

1294
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,742
So, he must've done it for a reason.

1295
01:26:03,534 --> 01:26:05,161
I fear you might be right.

1296
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:11,334
Thank you.

1297
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:19,258
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1298
01:26:21,302 --> 01:26:22,511
We all are.

1299
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:44,533
Run diagnostics.

1300
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:47,244
Show me her memory file.

1301
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:51,290
Sire, the file appears entangled.

1302
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:54,418
It was a memory, but not hers.

1303
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:57,088
There's another consciousness...

1304
01:26:57,254 --> 01:26:58,547
sharing her network.

1305
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:00,424
Another Nebula.

1306
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,011
Impossible.

1307
01:27:04,178 --> 01:27:06,806
This duplicate carries a time stamp...

1308
01:27:07,723 --> 01:27:09,892
from nine years in the future.

1309
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,982
Where is this other Nebula?

1310
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:19,652
In our solar system on Morag.

1311
01:27:21,195 --> 01:27:22,488
Can you access her?

1312
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:24,698
Yes, the two are linked.

1313
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:26,951
Search the duplicate's memories...

1314
01:27:27,118 --> 01:27:29,328
for Infinity Stones.

1315
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:35,835
And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.

1316
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:37,002
Our history.

1317
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:39,296
So, not a lot of convenient spots...

1318
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:40,589
to just drop in.

1319
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:42,425
Which means we have to pick our targets.

1320
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:43,884
- Correct. - Freeze image.

1321
01:27:45,845 --> 01:27:47,054
Terrans.

1322
01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:49,807
Avengers.

1323
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:52,601
Unruly wretches.

1324
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:54,270
What's that reflection?

1325
01:27:55,896 --> 01:27:57,064
Amplify this, Maw.

1326
01:28:00,568 --> 01:28:01,777
I don't understand.

1327
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,075
Two Nebulas.

1328
01:28:08,242 --> 01:28:10,661
No. The same Nebula...

1329
01:28:11,454 --> 01:28:13,205
from two different times.

1330
01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:16,125
Set course for Morag.

1331
01:28:16,292 --> 01:28:18,669
And scan the duplicate's memories.

1332
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,797
I wanna see everything.

1333
01:28:31,599 --> 01:28:35,060
My ladies, I'll see you after. I'll see you after. Go on ahead.

1334
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:50,451
What are you doing?

1335
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:53,287
Oh, God!

1336
01:28:53,454 --> 01:28:55,915
You're better off leaving the sneaking to your brother.

1337
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:57,958
No, I wasn't sneaking. I was just going for a walk.

1338
01:28:58,125 --> 01:28:59,460
What are you wearing?

1339
01:28:59,627 --> 01:29:02,004
I always wear this. It's one of my favorites.

1340
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:07,468
What's wrong with your eye?

1341
01:29:07,635 --> 01:29:08,636
Oh, my eye.

1342
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:10,763
Remember the Battle of Harokin...

1343
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:14,016
when I got hit in the face with the broadsword?

1344
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:19,605
You're not the Thor I know at all, are you?

1345
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:22,107
Yes, I am.

1346
01:29:22,608 --> 01:29:25,110
The future hasn't been kind to you, has it?

1347
01:29:25,569 --> 01:29:27,488
I didn't say I was from the future.

1348
01:29:27,947 --> 01:29:30,491
I was raised by witches, boy.

1349
01:29:31,534 --> 01:29:33,911
I see with more than eyes, you know that.

1350
01:29:35,996 --> 01:29:38,249
Yeah, I'm totally from the future.

1351
01:29:38,415 --> 01:29:40,042
Yes, you are, honey.

1352
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:41,710
I really need to talk to you.

1353
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:42,878
We can talk.

1354
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:08,988
His head was over there...

1355
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:12,116
and his body over there...

1356
01:30:13,409 --> 01:30:15,911
I mean, what was the point? I was too late.

1357
01:30:16,579 --> 01:30:18,205
I was just standing there.

1358
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:20,916
Some idiot with an axe.

1359
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:22,793
Now, you're no idiot.

1360
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:25,504
You're here, aren't you?

1361
01:30:25,713 --> 01:30:28,173
Seeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard.

1362
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:29,550
I am. Yes.

1363
01:30:29,717 --> 01:30:31,051
Idiot, no.

1364
01:30:31,218 --> 01:30:32,720
A failure?

1365
01:30:32,886 --> 01:30:34,013
Absolutely.

1366
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:35,973
That's a little bit harsh.

1367
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:37,641
Do you know what that makes you?

1368
01:30:38,851 --> 01:30:40,853
Just like everyone else.

1369
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:43,897
I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?

1370
01:30:44,398 --> 01:30:47,568
Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be, Thor.

1371
01:30:48,277 --> 01:30:51,322
The measure of a person, of a hero...

1372
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:54,867
is how well they succeed at being who they are.

1373
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:01,582
I've really missed you, Mom.

1374
01:31:07,463 --> 01:31:09,214
Thor! I got it!

1375
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:11,634
Get that rabbit!

1376
01:31:14,637 --> 01:31:16,221
Mom, I have to tell you something.

1377
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:18,182
No, son, you don't.

1378
01:31:18,349 --> 01:31:20,851
You're here to repair your future, not mine.

1379
01:31:21,018 --> 01:31:22,686
This is about your future.

1380
01:31:22,853 --> 01:31:24,188
It's none of my business.

1381
01:31:28,192 --> 01:31:29,443
Hi.

1382
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:31,612
You must be Mom.

1383
01:31:31,779 --> 01:31:33,238
I got the thing. Come on. We gotta move.

1384
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:34,865
I wish we had more time.

1385
01:31:35,032 --> 01:31:36,867
No, this was a gift.

1386
01:31:37,034 --> 01:31:40,454
Now you go and be the man you're meant to be.

1387
01:31:40,913 --> 01:31:41,997
I love you, Mom.

1388
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:43,082
I love you.

1389
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:49,463
And eat a salad.

1390
01:31:50,464 --> 01:31:51,590
Come on, we gotta go.

1391
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:53,342
- Goodbye. - Three...

1392
01:31:53,509 --> 01:31:54,593
- Two... - No, wait!

1393
01:31:57,846 --> 01:31:59,056
What am I looking at?

1394
01:31:59,223 --> 01:32:00,683
Sometimes it takes a second.

1395
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:12,194
I'm still worthy.

1396
01:32:13,612 --> 01:32:15,239
Oh, boy.

1397
01:32:16,407 --> 01:32:18,325
- Goodbye, Mom. - Goodbye.

1398
01:32:57,573 --> 01:32:59,199
So, he's an idiot?

1399
01:33:00,534 --> 01:33:01,952
Yeah.

1400
01:33:10,461 --> 01:33:11,670
What's that?

1401
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:13,714
The tool of a thief.

1402
01:33:23,474 --> 01:33:25,100
This is the part where spikes come out...

1403
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:26,685
with skeletons on the end of them and everything.

1404
01:33:26,852 --> 01:33:28,061
What are you talking about?

1405
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:30,564
When you break into a place called "The Temple of the Power Stone"...

1406
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:32,024
there's gonna be a bunch of booby traps.

1407
01:33:32,191 --> 01:33:34,443
- Oh, my God. - Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1408
01:34:07,726 --> 01:34:09,228
I wasn't always like this.

1409
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:11,146
Me either.

1410
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:14,399
But we work with what we got, right?

1411
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:19,822
Let's sync up.

1412
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:24,159
Three, two, one.

1413
01:34:37,005 --> 01:34:38,632
You murdered trillions!

1414
01:34:38,799 --> 01:34:40,217
You should be grateful.

1415
01:34:41,844 --> 01:34:43,428
Where are the stones?

1416
01:34:43,595 --> 01:34:44,596
Gone.

1417
01:34:45,347 --> 01:34:46,348
Reduced to atoms.

1418
01:34:47,057 --> 01:34:48,725
You used them two days ago!

1419
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:52,020
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

1420
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:54,022
It nearly killed me.

1421
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:56,108
But the work is done.

1422
01:34:56,275 --> 01:34:58,110
It always will be.

1423
01:34:59,403 --> 01:35:02,865
I am inevitable.

1424
01:35:04,116 --> 01:35:06,159
What did you do to them?

1425
01:35:06,326 --> 01:35:07,578
Nothing.

1426
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:09,746
Yet.

1427
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:15,252
They're not trying to stop something I'm going to do in our time.

1428
01:35:15,586 --> 01:35:19,214
They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs.

1429
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:21,049
The stones.

1430
01:35:21,967 --> 01:35:23,886
I found them all.

1431
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:27,055
I won.

1432
01:35:27,806 --> 01:35:30,767
Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.

1433
01:35:34,771 --> 01:35:36,523
This is your future.

1434
01:35:36,857 --> 01:35:38,901
It's my destiny.

1435
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:42,154
My father is many things.

1436
01:35:42,321 --> 01:35:44,156
A liar is not one of them.

1437
01:35:47,868 --> 01:35:49,786
Thank you, daughter.

1438
01:35:49,953 --> 01:35:52,122
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

1439
01:35:56,627 --> 01:35:59,504
And that is destiny fulfilled.

1440
01:35:59,922 --> 01:36:01,298
Sire...

1441
01:36:01,465 --> 01:36:02,591
your daughter...

1442
01:36:05,052 --> 01:36:06,053
No!

1443
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:07,554
...is a traitor.

1444
01:36:07,721 --> 01:36:10,182
That's not me. It's not, I could never...

1445
01:36:10,349 --> 01:36:11,516
I would never betray you.

1446
01:36:11,683 --> 01:36:13,518
Never. Never.

1447
01:36:19,274 --> 01:36:20,442
I know.

1448
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:24,655
And you'll have the chance to prove it.

1449
01:36:30,953 --> 01:36:32,037
No!

1450
01:36:32,746 --> 01:36:33,956
He knows!

1451
01:36:38,543 --> 01:36:40,587
Barton! Barton, come in.

1452
01:36:41,213 --> 01:36:42,506
Romanoff!

1453
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:44,549
Come in, we have a problem.

1454
01:36:44,716 --> 01:36:45,842
Come on!

1455
01:36:46,009 --> 01:36:47,427
Come in, we have a...

1456
01:36:47,594 --> 01:36:48,929
Thanos knows.

1457
01:36:49,596 --> 01:36:50,847
Thanos...

1458
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:05,654
Cap.

1459
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,533
Sorry, buddy, we got a problem.

1460
01:37:10,367 --> 01:37:11,702
Yeah, we do.

1461
01:37:12,285 --> 01:37:13,286
Well, what are we gonna do now?

1462
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:14,454
You know what? Give me a break, Steve.

1463
01:37:14,621 --> 01:37:16,039
I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.

1464
01:37:16,206 --> 01:37:17,624
You said that we had one shot.

1465
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:19,126
This was our shot.

1466
01:37:19,292 --> 01:37:21,294
We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing.

1467
01:37:21,461 --> 01:37:22,838
- It was six stones or nothing. - You're repeating yourself, you know that?

1468
01:37:23,005 --> 01:37:24,006
You're repeating yourself.

1469
01:37:24,172 --> 01:37:25,882
You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself.

1470
01:37:26,049 --> 01:37:27,843
- Dude. Come on! - No. You never wanted a time heist.

1471
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:29,011
You weren't on board with the time heist.

1472
01:37:29,177 --> 01:37:30,303
- I dropped the ball. - You ruined the time heist.

1473
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:31,763
- Is that what I did? - Yeah.

1474
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:33,724
Are there any other options with the Tesseract?

1475
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:35,100
No, no, no, there's no other options.

1476
01:37:35,267 --> 01:37:36,518
There's no do-overs.

1477
01:37:36,685 --> 01:37:38,770
We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left.

1478
01:37:38,937 --> 01:37:39,771
Each.

1479
01:37:39,938 --> 01:37:42,232
That's it. All right? We use that...

1480
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:43,567
bye-bye, you're not going home.

1481
01:37:43,734 --> 01:37:45,694
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

1482
01:37:45,861 --> 01:37:47,029
then no one else is going home, either.

1483
01:37:47,195 --> 01:37:48,113
I got it.

1484
01:37:49,406 --> 01:37:53,452
There's another way to retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles.

1485
01:37:54,286 --> 01:37:55,328
Little stroll down memory lane.

1486
01:37:56,121 --> 01:37:57,956
Military installation, Garden State.

1487
01:38:02,044 --> 01:38:03,336
When were they both there?

1488
01:38:03,503 --> 01:38:05,881
They were there at a time... I have a vaguely exact idea.

1489
01:38:06,548 --> 01:38:07,549
- How vague? - What are you talking about?

1490
01:38:07,716 --> 01:38:08,592
Where are we going?

1491
01:38:08,759 --> 01:38:09,676
I know for a fact they were there.

1492
01:38:09,843 --> 01:38:11,553
- Who's they? What are we doing? - And I know how I know.

1493
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,474
Guys, what is it?

1494
01:38:16,058 --> 01:38:17,684
Looks like we're improvising.

1495
01:38:17,851 --> 01:38:18,977
- Great. - What are we improvising?

1496
01:38:19,144 --> 01:38:20,896
Scott, get this back to the compound.

1497
01:38:21,063 --> 01:38:21,980
Suit up.

1498
01:38:22,314 --> 01:38:23,774
- What's in New Jersey? - 0-4.

1499
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:24,775
0-4.

1500
01:38:24,941 --> 01:38:25,942
- 0-7. - 0-7.

1501
01:38:26,109 --> 01:38:27,986
- Excuse me. - I-9-7-0.

1502
01:38:28,445 --> 01:38:29,362
Are you sure?

1503
01:38:29,529 --> 01:38:30,822
Cap? Captain?

1504
01:38:30,989 --> 01:38:32,824
Steve? Sorry.

1505
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:34,618
America. Rogers.

1506
01:38:34,785 --> 01:38:35,994
Look, if you do this...

1507
01:38:36,286 --> 01:38:38,830
and it doesn't work, you're not coming back.

1508
01:38:39,915 --> 01:38:41,708
Thanks for the pep talk, pissant.

1509
01:38:42,751 --> 01:38:43,960
You trust me?

1510
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:46,004
I do.

1511
01:38:47,047 --> 01:38:48,381
Your call.

1512
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:50,967
Here we go.

1513
01:39:07,025 --> 01:39:10,654
Hey, man! Make love, not war.

1514
01:39:16,576 --> 01:39:19,246
Clearly you weren't actually born here, right?

1515
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:20,914
The idea of me was.

1516
01:39:22,082 --> 01:39:23,625
Right. Well, imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

1517
01:39:23,792 --> 01:39:27,045
running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization...

1518
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:29,965
where do you hide it?

1519
01:39:30,132 --> 01:39:31,800
In plain sight.

1520
01:40:00,203 --> 01:40:01,329
Good luck on your mission, Captain.

1521
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:04,040
Good luck on your project, Doctor.

1522
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:08,545
You new here?

1523
01:40:11,089 --> 01:40:12,424
Not exactly.

1524
01:40:19,097 --> 01:40:20,891
Come on, you bastard.

1525
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:29,191
Gotcha.

1526
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:48,418
Back in the game.

1527
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:52,297
Arnim, you in there?

1528
01:40:53,256 --> 01:40:54,299
Arnim?

1529
01:40:59,596 --> 01:41:00,931
Hey!

1530
01:41:01,598 --> 01:41:03,308
The door is this way, pal.

1531
01:41:04,309 --> 01:41:05,185
Oh, yeah.

1532
01:41:05,352 --> 01:41:07,229
Looking for Doctor Zola, have you seen him?

1533
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:10,815
Yeah, Doctor Zola. No, I haven't seen a soul.

1534
01:41:12,317 --> 01:41:13,652
Pardon me.

1535
01:41:14,402 --> 01:41:16,029
Do I know you?

1536
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,281
No, sir.

1537
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:21,534
I'm a visitor from MIT.

1538
01:41:22,118 --> 01:41:23,245
MIT.

1539
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:24,829
Got a name?

1540
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:26,414
Howard.

1541
01:41:26,581 --> 01:41:29,084
- That'll be easy to remember. - Howard...

1542
01:41:30,085 --> 01:41:31,086
Potts.

1543
01:41:31,670 --> 01:41:33,880
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1544
01:41:34,047 --> 01:41:34,965
Hi.

1545
01:41:35,131 --> 01:41:36,424
Shake that, don't pull it.

1546
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:37,592
Yeah.

1547
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:41,221
You look a little green around the gills, there, Potts.

1548
01:41:41,388 --> 01:41:43,556
I'm fine. Just long hours.

1549
01:41:43,723 --> 01:41:45,433
You wanna get some air?

1550
01:41:47,978 --> 01:41:49,771
- Hello, Potts. - Yeah.

1551
01:41:49,938 --> 01:41:51,189
- That'd be swell. - That way.

1552
01:41:51,356 --> 01:41:52,315
Okay.

1553
01:41:52,482 --> 01:41:54,150
Need your briefcase?

1554
01:41:58,488 --> 01:42:01,074
You're not one of those beatniks, are you, Potts?

1555
01:42:06,913 --> 01:42:08,707
- Hello? - Doctor Pym?

1556
01:42:08,873 --> 01:42:11,084
That would be the number that you called, yes.

1557
01:42:11,251 --> 01:42:13,503
This is Captain Stevens from shipping.

1558
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:14,796
We have a package for you.

1559
01:42:15,171 --> 01:42:16,339
Bring it up.

1560
01:42:16,506 --> 01:42:18,466
That's the thing, sir, we can't.

1561
01:42:19,592 --> 01:42:22,220
I'm confused. I thought that was your job.

1562
01:42:22,387 --> 01:42:23,763
Well, it's just...

1563
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,390
Sir, the box is glowing...

1564
01:42:25,557 --> 01:42:28,351
and to be honest, some of our mail guys aren't feeling that great.

1565
01:42:28,518 --> 01:42:30,228
They didn't open it, did they?

1566
01:42:30,395 --> 01:42:32,564
Yeah, they did. You better get down here.

1567
01:42:33,398 --> 01:42:35,317
Excuse me! Out of the way!

1568
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:06,014
So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight?

1569
01:43:06,765 --> 01:43:08,224
My wife's expecting.

1570
01:43:08,391 --> 01:43:11,227
And too much time at the office.

1571
01:43:13,063 --> 01:43:14,439
Congratulations.

1572
01:43:14,606 --> 01:43:16,733
- Thanks. Hold this, will ya? - Yeah, sure.

1573
01:43:17,817 --> 01:43:19,903
- How far along is she? - I don't know.

1574
01:43:21,696 --> 01:43:24,449
She's at the point where she can't stand the sound of my chewing.

1575
01:43:24,616 --> 01:43:28,078
I guess I'll be eating dinner in the pantry again.

1576
01:43:28,995 --> 01:43:29,996
I have a little girl.

1577
01:43:30,163 --> 01:43:31,664
A girl would be nice.

1578
01:43:31,831 --> 01:43:33,833
Less of a chance she'd turn out exactly like me.

1579
01:43:34,501 --> 01:43:35,960
What'd be so awful about that?

1580
01:43:36,127 --> 01:43:41,508
Let's just say that the greater good has rarely outweighed my own self-interest.

1581
01:43:45,553 --> 01:43:46,596
And you've never seen these two men before?

1582
01:43:46,763 --> 01:43:48,598
No, I've got an eye for this. The two of them looked fishy.

1583
01:43:48,765 --> 01:43:51,017
- Can you describe them? - One of them had a hippie beard.

1584
01:43:51,184 --> 01:43:53,353
Hippie. Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1585
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:54,562
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1586
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:56,898
Yeah, this is Chester. I need every available MP to sublevel six.

1587
01:43:57,065 --> 01:43:58,942
We have a potential breach.

1588
01:44:16,835 --> 01:44:17,794
I said bring them in.

1589
01:44:17,961 --> 01:44:20,130
They're trying, ma'am, but Braddock's unit has been stopped by lightning strikes.

1590
01:44:20,296 --> 01:44:21,131
Oh, for the love of...

1591
01:44:21,297 --> 01:44:22,799
I'll look at the weather projections.

1592
01:44:46,823 --> 01:44:48,825
It's not lightning strikes we're looking at.

1593
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:01,880
So, where you at with names?

1594
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:05,175
Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo.

1595
01:45:06,134 --> 01:45:08,428
Might wanna let that stew awhile. You got time.

1596
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:11,723
Let me ask you a question.

1597
01:45:12,724 --> 01:45:15,977
When your kid was born, were you nervous?

1598
01:45:16,144 --> 01:45:17,479
Wildly.

1599
01:45:17,729 --> 01:45:19,439
- Yeah. - Did you feel qualified?

1600
01:45:19,606 --> 01:45:23,193
Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing?

1601
01:45:23,610 --> 01:45:26,446
I literally pieced it together as I went along.

1602
01:45:26,613 --> 01:45:28,615
I thought about what my dad did.

1603
01:45:29,324 --> 01:45:31,493
My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt.

1604
01:45:32,285 --> 01:45:34,329
I thought my dad was tough on me.

1605
01:45:34,496 --> 01:45:37,207
And now, looking back on it, I just remember the good stuff.

1606
01:45:37,373 --> 01:45:38,958
You know? He did drop the odd pearl.

1607
01:45:39,125 --> 01:45:40,502
Yeah? Like what?

1608
01:45:41,628 --> 01:45:44,130
"No amount of money ever bought a second of time."

1609
01:45:45,465 --> 01:45:46,508
Smart guy.

1610
01:45:46,925 --> 01:45:48,384
He did his best.

1611
01:45:49,761 --> 01:45:53,723
I'll tell you, that kid's not even here yet and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.

1612
01:46:02,482 --> 01:46:03,858
Good to meet you, Potts.

1613
01:46:04,526 --> 01:46:05,360
Yeah.

1614
01:46:05,777 --> 01:46:06,945
Howard...

1615
01:46:07,529 --> 01:46:09,113
everything's gonna be all right.

1616
01:46:12,116 --> 01:46:13,368
Thank you...

1617
01:46:14,327 --> 01:46:15,662
for everything...

1618
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:18,373
you've done for this country.

1619
01:46:21,251 --> 01:46:22,377
Jarvis.

1620
01:46:26,089 --> 01:46:27,632
Have we ever met that guy?

1621
01:46:29,634 --> 01:46:31,135
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1622
01:46:33,763 --> 01:46:35,390
Seems very familiar.

1623
01:46:36,307 --> 01:46:37,767
Weird beard.

1624
01:46:46,109 --> 01:46:47,110
You're weak.

1625
01:46:47,652 --> 01:46:48,736
I'm you.

1626
01:47:06,379 --> 01:47:08,464
You could stop this.

1627
01:47:08,756 --> 01:47:10,550
You know you want to.

1628
01:47:11,259 --> 01:47:13,428
Did you see what happens in the future?

1629
01:47:14,721 --> 01:47:17,098
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1630
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:20,643
You wanna know how he does that?

1631
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:26,190
You wanna know what he does to you?

1632
01:47:26,691 --> 01:47:27,692
That's enough.

1633
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:41,956
You disgust me.

1634
01:47:43,249 --> 01:47:48,129
But that doesn't mean you're useless.

1635
01:48:09,817 --> 01:48:11,527
How do I look?

1636
01:48:18,117 --> 01:48:19,118
Wow.

1637
01:48:20,119 --> 01:48:23,247
Under different circumstances...

1638
01:48:23,414 --> 01:48:25,416
this would be totally awesome.

1639
01:48:37,553 --> 01:48:40,390
I bet the raccoon didn't have to climb a mountain.

1640
01:48:40,556 --> 01:48:42,475
Technically he's not a raccoon, you know?

1641
01:48:42,642 --> 01:48:44,185
Whatever. He eats garbage.

1642
01:48:44,352 --> 01:48:45,687
Welcome.

1643
01:48:48,856 --> 01:48:50,191
Natasha.

1644
01:48:50,358 --> 01:48:51,359
Daughter of Ivan.

1645
01:48:52,694 --> 01:48:53,820
Clint.

1646
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:56,280
Son of Edith.

1647
01:49:01,661 --> 01:49:03,121
Who are you?

1648
01:49:03,746 --> 01:49:06,207
Consider me a guide...

1649
01:49:06,374 --> 01:49:08,042
to you...

1650
01:49:08,209 --> 01:49:10,044
and to all who seek the Soul Stone.

1651
01:49:10,211 --> 01:49:11,254
Oh, good.

1652
01:49:11,421 --> 01:49:13,548
You tell us where it is, then we'll be on our way.

1653
01:49:17,468 --> 01:49:19,721
If only it were that easy.

1654
01:49:31,816 --> 01:49:35,528
What you seek lies in front of you.

1655
01:49:36,779 --> 01:49:39,198
As does what you fear.

1656
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:45,997
The stone's down there.

1657
01:49:46,622 --> 01:49:48,541
For one of you.

1658
01:49:48,833 --> 01:49:50,543
For the other...

1659
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:55,131
In order to take the stone...

1660
01:49:55,298 --> 01:49:58,301
you must lose that which you love.

1661
01:49:59,677 --> 01:50:02,847
An everlasting exchange.

1662
01:50:03,848 --> 01:50:07,935
A soul for a soul.

1663
01:50:10,521 --> 01:50:11,898
How's it going?

1664
01:50:15,318 --> 01:50:16,736
Jesus.

1665
01:50:17,069 --> 01:50:18,780
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1666
01:50:19,655 --> 01:50:20,990
No.

1667
01:50:21,824 --> 01:50:22,825
I don't think so.

1668
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:25,703
Why? 'Cause he knows your daddy's name?

1669
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:28,247
I didn't.

1670
01:50:29,749 --> 01:50:32,126
Thanos left here with the stone...

1671
01:50:32,794 --> 01:50:34,337
without his daughter.

1672
01:50:34,504 --> 01:50:36,589
That's not a coincidence.

1673
01:50:37,673 --> 01:50:39,300
Yeah.

1674
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:42,887
Whatever it takes.

1675
01:50:47,391 --> 01:50:48,893
Whatever it takes.

1676
01:50:53,272 --> 01:50:55,233
If we don't get that stone...

1677
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:57,068
billions of people stay dead.

1678
01:50:57,944 --> 01:50:59,111
Yeah.

1679
01:51:00,988 --> 01:51:03,115
Then I guess we both know who it's gotta be.

1680
01:51:03,866 --> 01:51:05,034
I guess we do.

1681
01:51:13,459 --> 01:51:18,172
I'm starting to think we mean different people here, Natasha.

1682
01:51:18,673 --> 01:51:20,508
For the last five years, I've been trying to do one thing.

1683
01:51:20,675 --> 01:51:21,926
Get to right here.

1684
01:51:22,093 --> 01:51:24,095
That's all it's been about. Bringing everybody back.

1685
01:51:24,262 --> 01:51:26,472
No, don't you get all decent on me now.

1686
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:28,641
What, you think I wanna do it?

1687
01:51:29,225 --> 01:51:30,977
I'm trying to save your life, you idiot.

1688
01:51:31,143 --> 01:51:33,479
Yeah, well, I don't want you to. How's that?

1689
01:51:34,397 --> 01:51:36,607
Natasha, you know what I've done.

1690
01:51:38,276 --> 01:51:40,069
You know what I've become.

1691
01:51:42,196 --> 01:51:44,782
I don't judge people on their worst mistakes.

1692
01:51:48,953 --> 01:51:50,204
Maybe you should.

1693
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,623
You didn't.

1694
01:51:58,796 --> 01:52:01,007
You're a pain in my ass, you know that?

1695
01:52:12,101 --> 01:52:13,311
Okay.

1696
01:52:15,062 --> 01:52:16,564
You win.

1697
01:52:23,029 --> 01:52:24,196
Tell my family I love 'em.

1698
01:52:27,909 --> 01:52:29,118
You tell 'em yourself.

1699
01:53:01,984 --> 01:53:02,985
Damn you.

1700
01:53:10,493 --> 01:53:11,494
Wait.

1701
01:53:19,543 --> 01:53:21,379
Let me go.

1702
01:53:22,630 --> 01:53:23,631
No.

1703
01:53:25,383 --> 01:53:26,384
No. Please, no.

1704
01:53:29,762 --> 01:53:31,597
It's okay.

1705
01:53:33,808 --> 01:53:34,642
Please.

1706
01:53:36,727 --> 01:53:37,728
No!

1707
01:55:19,205 --> 01:55:20,206
Did we get 'em all?

1708
01:55:21,624 --> 01:55:23,417
Are you telling me this actually worked?

1709
01:55:28,255 --> 01:55:29,465
Clint, where's Nat?

1710
01:55:58,702 --> 01:55:59,703
Do we know if she had family?

1711
01:56:00,871 --> 01:56:02,039
Yeah.

1712
01:56:02,206 --> 01:56:03,207
Us.

1713
01:56:04,625 --> 01:56:05,668
What?

1714
01:56:07,628 --> 01:56:08,796
- What are you doing? - Just asked him a question.

1715
01:56:08,963 --> 01:56:10,214
Yeah, no, you're acting like she's dead.

1716
01:56:10,381 --> 01:56:12,842
Why are we acting like she's dead? We have the stones, right?

1717
01:56:13,008 --> 01:56:14,009
As long as we have the stones...

1718
01:56:14,176 --> 01:56:15,928
Cap, we can bring her back. Isn't that right?

1719
01:56:16,095 --> 01:56:18,097
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers. Get it together.

1720
01:56:18,264 --> 01:56:19,473
Can't get her back.

1721
01:56:22,476 --> 01:56:23,727
What's he...? What?

1722
01:56:23,894 --> 01:56:25,104
It can't be undone.

1723
01:56:25,688 --> 01:56:27,398
It can't.

1724
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:33,028
Look, I'm sorry, no offense, but you're a very earthly being, okay?

1725
01:56:33,195 --> 01:56:34,488
And we're talking about space magic.

1726
01:56:34,655 --> 01:56:36,657
And "can't" seems very definitive. Don't you think?

1727
01:56:36,824 --> 01:56:39,660
Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside my pay grade here.

1728
01:56:39,827 --> 01:56:41,287
But she still isn't here, is she?

1729
01:56:41,453 --> 01:56:42,454
No, that's my point.

1730
01:56:42,621 --> 01:56:45,583
It can't be undone.

1731
01:56:45,749 --> 01:56:49,086
Or that's at least what the red, floating guy had to say.

1732
01:56:49,253 --> 01:56:50,713
Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay?

1733
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:53,924
Go grab your hammer and you go fly and you talk to him.

1734
01:57:02,474 --> 01:57:04,518
It was supposed to be me.

1735
01:57:06,770 --> 01:57:09,064
She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone.

1736
01:57:09,231 --> 01:57:10,691
She bet her life on it.

1737
01:57:15,613 --> 01:57:17,948
She's not coming back.

1738
01:57:19,742 --> 01:57:21,285
We have to make it worth it.

1739
01:57:21,785 --> 01:57:23,245
We have to.

1740
01:57:24,663 --> 01:57:26,332
We will.

1741
01:57:51,023 --> 01:57:52,149
Boom!

1742
01:57:57,821 --> 01:57:59,281
All right, the glove's ready.

1743
01:58:00,074 --> 01:58:02,660
Question is, who's gonna snap their freakin' fingers?

1744
01:58:02,826 --> 01:58:04,912
- I'll do it. - Excuse me?

1745
01:58:05,079 --> 01:58:06,038
It's okay.

1746
01:58:06,205 --> 01:58:07,122
Stop, stop. Slow down.

1747
01:58:07,289 --> 01:58:08,791
Thor. Just wait.

1748
01:58:08,958 --> 01:58:10,793
We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet.

1749
01:58:11,168 --> 01:58:14,088
I'm sorry. What, we're all just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity?

1750
01:58:14,255 --> 01:58:15,381
We should at least discuss it.

1751
01:58:15,547 --> 01:58:19,385
Look, sitting here staring at the thing is not gonna bring everybody back.

1752
01:58:20,427 --> 01:58:23,347
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So, this responsibility falls upon me.

1753
01:58:23,514 --> 01:58:24,723
- Normally, you're right. - It's my duty.

1754
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:26,684
- It's not about that. - It's not that.

1755
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:28,644
- Hey, buddy... - Stop it! Just let me.

1756
01:58:31,647 --> 01:58:33,148
Just let me do it.

1757
01:58:33,315 --> 01:58:35,818
Just let me do something good. Something right.

1758
01:58:35,985 --> 01:58:36,986
Look, it's not just the fact...

1759
01:58:37,152 --> 01:58:39,280
that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent.

1760
01:58:39,446 --> 01:58:41,448
I'm telling you. You're in no condition.

1761
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:44,660
What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?

1762
01:58:44,827 --> 01:58:45,869
Cheez Whiz?

1763
01:58:48,414 --> 01:58:49,415
Lightning.

1764
01:58:49,581 --> 01:58:50,708
- Yeah. - Lightning.

1765
01:58:50,874 --> 01:58:52,251
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1766
01:58:52,418 --> 01:58:54,253
It's gotta be me.

1767
01:58:55,587 --> 01:58:57,756
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.

1768
01:58:57,923 --> 01:58:59,466
They almost killed him.

1769
01:59:00,884 --> 01:59:02,761
None of you could survive.

1770
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:05,097
How do we know you will?

1771
01:59:05,264 --> 01:59:06,307
We don't.

1772
01:59:06,598 --> 01:59:09,143
But the radiation's mostly gamma.

1773
01:59:12,646 --> 01:59:14,231
It's like...

1774
01:59:16,108 --> 01:59:18,027
I was made for this.

1775
01:59:36,962 --> 01:59:38,464
Good to go, yeah?

1776
01:59:40,591 --> 01:59:41,592
Let's do it.

1777
01:59:41,759 --> 01:59:44,803
Okay, remember, everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago...

1778
01:59:44,970 --> 01:59:47,431
you're just bringing them back to now, today.

1779
01:59:47,598 --> 01:59:49,016
Don't change anything from the last five years.

1780
01:59:50,434 --> 01:59:51,602
Got it.

1781
02:00:07,993 --> 02:00:10,788
Friday, do me a favor and activate Barn Door Protocol, will ya?

1782
02:00:10,954 --> 02:00:12,247
Yes, boss.

1783
02:00:20,839 --> 02:00:22,674
Everybody comes home.

1784
02:00:46,073 --> 02:00:47,491
Take it off! Take it off!

1785
02:00:47,658 --> 02:00:48,784
No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?

1786
02:00:49,952 --> 02:00:51,161
Talk to me, Banner.

1787
02:00:54,331 --> 02:00:55,332
I'm okay.

1788
02:00:55,833 --> 02:00:57,126
I'm okay.

1789
02:01:28,574 --> 02:01:29,700
Bruce!

1790
02:01:31,452 --> 02:01:33,036
Don't move him.

1791
02:01:39,918 --> 02:01:41,920
- Did it work? - We're not sure. It's okay.

1792
02:02:28,425 --> 02:02:29,301
Honey.

1793
02:02:29,468 --> 02:02:30,427
Clint?

1794
02:02:30,594 --> 02:02:31,845
Honey.

1795
02:02:32,679 --> 02:02:34,014
Guys...

1796
02:02:36,475 --> 02:02:37,851
I think it worked.

1797
02:03:20,477 --> 02:03:22,354
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

1798
02:03:23,605 --> 02:03:25,399
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

1799
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:33,824
Rhodey, Rocket, get out of here.

1800
02:03:34,992 --> 02:03:36,535
Let me up! Let me up!

1801
02:03:37,286 --> 02:03:38,036
Come on!

1802
02:03:48,171 --> 02:03:49,006
Rhodey!

1803
02:03:57,556 --> 02:04:00,601
Mayday, Mayday! Does anybody copy? We're on the lower level. It's flooding!

1804
02:04:00,767 --> 02:04:02,477
What? What?

1805
02:04:02,644 --> 02:04:04,813
We are drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!

1806
02:04:04,980 --> 02:04:07,149
Wait! I'm here!

1807
02:04:07,316 --> 02:04:08,817
I'm here. Can you hear me?

1808
02:04:28,462 --> 02:04:29,671
Cap?

1809
02:04:53,654 --> 02:04:54,780
Okay.

1810
02:05:14,049 --> 02:05:15,175
Daughter.

1811
02:05:15,342 --> 02:05:16,510
Yes, Father.

1812
02:05:18,387 --> 02:05:20,097
So, this is the future.

1813
02:05:20,764 --> 02:05:21,598
Well done.

1814
02:05:22,516 --> 02:05:24,017
Thank you, Father.

1815
02:05:24,184 --> 02:05:25,560
They suspected nothing.

1816
02:05:27,896 --> 02:05:29,356
The arrogant never do.

1817
02:05:32,317 --> 02:05:33,443
Go.

1818
02:05:34,403 --> 02:05:36,822
Find the stones, bring them to me.

1819
02:05:36,988 --> 02:05:38,699
What will you do?

1820
02:05:40,033 --> 02:05:41,702
Wait.

1821
02:06:06,935 --> 02:06:08,603
Tell me something.

1822
02:06:09,730 --> 02:06:12,149
In the future...

1823
02:06:12,315 --> 02:06:14,192
what happens to you and me?

1824
02:06:16,486 --> 02:06:18,113
I try to kill you.

1825
02:06:19,823 --> 02:06:21,324
Several times.

1826
02:06:22,409 --> 02:06:24,369
But eventually...

1827
02:06:24,536 --> 02:06:26,496
we become friends.

1828
02:06:27,998 --> 02:06:29,708
We become sisters.

1829
02:06:37,382 --> 02:06:38,592
Come on.

1830
02:06:40,635 --> 02:06:42,429
We can stop him.

1831
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:51,855
Come on, buddy, wake up!

1832
02:06:52,397 --> 02:06:53,857
That's my man.

1833
02:06:54,775 --> 02:06:56,818
You lose this again, I'm keeping it.

1834
02:07:00,363 --> 02:07:01,531
What happened?

1835
02:07:01,698 --> 02:07:03,825
You mess with time, it tends to mess back.

1836
02:07:03,992 --> 02:07:04,868
You'll see.

1837
02:07:26,973 --> 02:07:28,350
What's he been doing?

1838
02:07:30,268 --> 02:07:31,686
Absolutely nothing.

1839
02:07:33,438 --> 02:07:35,315
Where are the stones?

1840
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:37,526
Somewhere under all this.

1841
02:07:38,902 --> 02:07:41,112
All I know is he doesn't have 'em.

1842
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:43,031
So, we keep it that way.

1843
02:07:43,198 --> 02:07:44,574
You know it's a trap, right?

1844
02:07:44,741 --> 02:07:46,076
Yeah.

1845
02:07:46,243 --> 02:07:47,577
I don't much care.

1846
02:07:48,328 --> 02:07:49,329
Good.

1847
02:07:50,288 --> 02:07:52,791
Just as long as we're all in agreement.

1848
02:08:02,551 --> 02:08:04,553
Let's kill him properly this time.

1849
02:08:13,937 --> 02:08:16,857
You could not live with your own failure.

1850
02:08:18,358 --> 02:08:20,193
Where did that bring you?

1851
02:08:23,154 --> 02:08:25,031
Back to me.

1852
02:08:28,451 --> 02:08:31,288
I thought by eliminating half of life...

1853
02:08:32,038 --> 02:08:34,416
the other half would thrive.

1854
02:08:34,583 --> 02:08:35,917
But you've shown me...

1855
02:08:37,085 --> 02:08:38,837
that's impossible.

1856
02:08:40,755 --> 02:08:44,050
And as long as there are those that remember what was...

1857
02:08:44,217 --> 02:08:49,431
there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be.

1858
02:08:50,181 --> 02:08:51,433
They will resist.

1859
02:08:51,933 --> 02:08:53,852
Yep, we're all kinds of stubborn.

1860
02:08:54,769 --> 02:08:56,354
I'm thankful.

1861
02:08:58,523 --> 02:09:00,275
Because now...

1862
02:09:00,442 --> 02:09:02,569
I know what I must do.

1863
02:09:03,028 --> 02:09:05,989
I will shred this universe...

1864
02:09:06,156 --> 02:09:08,199
down to its last atom.

1865
02:09:08,992 --> 02:09:10,660
And then...

1866
02:09:10,827 --> 02:09:13,163
with the stones you've collected for me...

1867
02:09:13,955 --> 02:09:16,082
create a new one...

1868
02:09:16,249 --> 02:09:18,460
teeming with life...

1869
02:09:18,627 --> 02:09:20,503
that knows not what it has lost...

1870
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:23,048
but only what it has been given.

1871
02:09:26,134 --> 02:09:27,552
A grateful universe.

1872
02:09:28,094 --> 02:09:29,512
Born out of blood.

1873
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:31,348
They'll never know it.

1874
02:09:32,557 --> 02:09:35,477
Because you won't be alive to tell them.

1875
02:09:50,075 --> 02:09:51,368
See you on the other side, man.

1876
02:09:53,703 --> 02:09:55,705
Hang on! I'm coming!

1877
02:10:25,986 --> 02:10:26,987
Yeah!

1878
02:10:41,876 --> 02:10:43,420
Oh, hey.

1879
02:10:43,586 --> 02:10:45,296
I know you.

1880
02:10:48,216 --> 02:10:49,217
Father...

1881
02:10:49,968 --> 02:10:51,386
I have the stones.

1882
02:10:51,553 --> 02:10:52,470
What?

1883
02:10:53,847 --> 02:10:54,764
Stop.

1884
02:10:59,978 --> 02:11:01,396
You're betraying us?

1885
02:11:07,402 --> 02:11:08,695
You don't have to do this.

1886
02:11:11,531 --> 02:11:14,034
I am this.

1887
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:16,119
No, you're not.

1888
02:11:16,578 --> 02:11:18,455
You've seen what we become.

1889
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:26,755
Nebula, listen to her.

1890
02:11:28,214 --> 02:11:29,090
You can change.

1891
02:11:35,764 --> 02:11:37,265
He won't let me.

1892
02:11:38,892 --> 02:11:39,642
No!

1893
02:11:59,287 --> 02:12:00,663
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

1894
02:12:17,305 --> 02:12:18,598
Boss, wake up!

1895
02:13:09,899 --> 02:13:11,192
I knew it!

1896
02:14:33,566 --> 02:14:36,402
In all my years of conquest...

1897
02:14:37,695 --> 02:14:39,447
violence...

1898
02:14:40,490 --> 02:14:42,450
slaughter...

1899
02:14:43,576 --> 02:14:45,995
it was never personal.

1900
02:14:48,581 --> 02:14:50,667
But I'll tell you now...

1901
02:14:52,669 --> 02:14:58,925
what I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet...

1902
02:15:00,677 --> 02:15:02,887
I'm gonna enjoy it...

1903
02:15:03,805 --> 02:15:06,182
very, very much.

1904
02:16:09,662 --> 02:16:11,205
Hey, Cap, you read me?

1905
02:16:17,211 --> 02:16:19,505
Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?

1906
02:16:23,509 --> 02:16:24,927
On your left.

1907
02:17:50,596 --> 02:17:51,889
Is that everyone?

1908
02:17:52,056 --> 02:17:54,267
What? You wanted more?

1909
02:18:20,793 --> 02:18:22,753
Avengers...

1910
02:18:27,884 --> 02:18:28,968
assemble.

1911
02:19:04,170 --> 02:19:05,421
Die!

1912
02:19:26,067 --> 02:19:28,819
No, no, give me that. You have the little one.

1913
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:43,334
Hey!

1914
02:19:44,335 --> 02:19:45,336
Holy cow!

1915
02:19:45,503 --> 02:19:46,879
You will not believe what's been going on.

1916
02:19:46,963 --> 02:19:48,172
Do you remember when we were in space?

1917
02:19:48,339 --> 02:19:49,715
And I got all dusty?

1918
02:19:49,882 --> 02:19:52,552
And I must've passed out, because I woke up and you were gone.

1919
02:19:52,718 --> 02:19:54,345
But Doctor Strange was there, right? And he was like...

1920
02:19:54,512 --> 02:19:56,013
"It's been five years. Come on, they need us."

1921
02:19:56,180 --> 02:19:57,848
And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time.

1922
02:19:58,015 --> 02:19:58,849
He did? Oh, no.

1923
02:19:59,016 --> 02:20:00,309
What are you doing?

1924
02:20:05,356 --> 02:20:06,857
This is nice.

1925
02:20:28,629 --> 02:20:29,630
Gamora?

1926
02:20:39,056 --> 02:20:40,725
I thought I lost you.

1927
02:20:45,313 --> 02:20:48,232
Don't touch me!

1928
02:20:51,235 --> 02:20:53,070
You missed the first time.

1929
02:20:53,237 --> 02:20:55,239
Then you got 'em both the second time.

1930
02:20:57,241 --> 02:20:58,326
This is the one?

1931
02:20:58,492 --> 02:20:59,493
Seriously?

1932
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:01,662
Your choices were him or a tree.

1933
02:21:12,465 --> 02:21:13,466
Cap!

1934
02:21:13,633 --> 02:21:15,384
What do you want me to do with this damn thing?

1935
02:21:18,095 --> 02:21:20,139
Get those stones as far away as possible!

1936
02:21:20,306 --> 02:21:21,349
No!

1937
02:21:22,516 --> 02:21:24,477
We need to get 'em back where they came from.

1938
02:21:24,644 --> 02:21:27,229
No way to get 'em back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.

1939
02:21:27,396 --> 02:21:28,230
Hold on!

1940
02:21:30,107 --> 02:21:32,234
That wasn't our only time machine.

1941
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:40,159
Anyone see an ugly brown van out there?

1942
02:21:40,701 --> 02:21:43,788
Yes! But you're not gonna like where it's parked!

1943
02:21:43,954 --> 02:21:46,082
Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?

1944
02:21:47,458 --> 02:21:48,459
Maybe 10 minutes.

1945
02:21:48,626 --> 02:21:50,127
Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.

1946
02:21:50,294 --> 02:21:51,837
We're on it, Cap.

1947
02:22:01,597 --> 02:22:02,723
Hey.

1948
02:22:02,890 --> 02:22:05,893
You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah?

1949
02:22:06,811 --> 02:22:07,812
Tell me this is it.

1950
02:22:08,229 --> 02:22:10,106
If I tell you what happens...

1951
02:22:10,272 --> 02:22:11,440
it won't happen.

1952
02:22:15,027 --> 02:22:16,028
You better be right.

1953
02:22:24,453 --> 02:22:25,830
It's a mess back here.

1954
02:22:26,831 --> 02:22:27,832
It's dead.

1955
02:22:29,125 --> 02:22:30,626
- What? - It's dead.

1956
02:22:30,793 --> 02:22:32,211
I have to hot-wire it.

1957
02:22:35,297 --> 02:22:36,507
Where's Nebula?

1958
02:22:37,633 --> 02:22:38,968
She's not responding.

1959
02:22:39,343 --> 02:22:40,678
Sire...

1960
02:22:50,438 --> 02:22:51,689
Clint!

1961
02:22:53,733 --> 02:22:54,859
Give it to me.

1962
02:23:17,131 --> 02:23:20,509
You took everything from me.

1963
02:23:20,885 --> 02:23:23,220
I don't even know who you are.

1964
02:23:23,387 --> 02:23:25,014
You will.

1965
02:23:47,453 --> 02:23:48,412
I got it!

1966
02:23:50,956 --> 02:23:52,041
Activate Instant Kill.

1967
02:24:15,481 --> 02:24:16,816
Rain fire!

1968
02:24:17,525 --> 02:24:19,443
But, sire, our troops!

1969
02:24:19,610 --> 02:24:21,362
Just do it!

1970
02:24:41,507 --> 02:24:43,884
Is anyone else seeing this?

1971
02:24:57,815 --> 02:24:58,941
I got this!

1972
02:24:59,191 --> 02:25:00,985
I got this. Okay, I don't got this.

1973
02:25:01,318 --> 02:25:02,486
Help, somebody help!

1974
02:25:02,653 --> 02:25:04,530
Hey, Queens, heads up!

1975
02:25:14,582 --> 02:25:15,624
Hang on. I got you, kid.

1976
02:25:19,253 --> 02:25:20,421
Hey! Nice to meet you...

1977
02:25:20,588 --> 02:25:22,423
Oh, my God!

1978
02:25:58,667 --> 02:26:00,127
What the hell is this?

1979
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:02,004
Friday, what are they firing at?

1980
02:26:02,171 --> 02:26:04,048
Something just entered the upper atmosphere.

1981
02:26:17,311 --> 02:26:19,480
Oh, yeah!

1982
02:26:39,375 --> 02:26:41,794
Danvers, we need an assist here.

1983
02:26:50,552 --> 02:26:53,138
Hi, I'm Peter Parker.

1984
02:26:53,764 --> 02:26:55,182
Hey, Peter Parker.

1985
02:26:55,349 --> 02:26:56,517
You got something for me?

1986
02:27:02,648 --> 02:27:04,733
I don't know how you're gonna get it through all of that.

1987
02:27:06,402 --> 02:27:07,820
Don't worry.

1988
02:27:08,696 --> 02:27:10,280
She's got help.

1989
02:29:58,115 --> 02:30:01,618
I am inevitable.

1990
02:30:21,722 --> 02:30:23,265
And I...

1991
02:30:24,933 --> 02:30:26,101
am...

1992
02:30:29,813 --> 02:30:31,315
Iron Man.

1993
02:32:30,017 --> 02:32:31,727
Mr. Stark?

1994
02:32:32,144 --> 02:32:33,395
Hey!

1995
02:32:34,396 --> 02:32:37,357
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me?

1996
02:32:37,524 --> 02:32:39,067
It's Peter.

1997
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:41,987
Hey.

1998
02:32:43,030 --> 02:32:46,074
We won, Mr. Stark.

1999
02:32:47,909 --> 02:32:50,078
We won, Mr. Stark.

2000
02:32:51,705 --> 02:32:54,541
We won! You did it, sir, you did it.

2001
02:32:55,459 --> 02:32:56,752
I'm sorry.

2002
02:32:56,918 --> 02:32:57,919
Tony.

2003
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:12,642
Hey.

2004
02:33:12,809 --> 02:33:14,644
Hey, Pep.

2005
02:33:18,940 --> 02:33:20,025
Friday?

2006
02:33:20,192 --> 02:33:22,944
Life functions critical.

2007
02:33:31,536 --> 02:33:32,537
Tony?

2008
02:33:33,789 --> 02:33:34,873
Look at me.

2009
02:33:37,542 --> 02:33:39,461
We're gonna be okay.

2010
02:33:44,174 --> 02:33:46,051
You can rest now.

2011
02:35:31,573 --> 02:35:34,367
Everybody wants a happy ending, right?

2012
02:35:34,534 --> 02:35:36,745
But it doesn't always roll that way.

2013
02:35:38,830 --> 02:35:40,499
Maybe this time.

2014
02:35:42,083 --> 02:35:44,753
I'm hoping if you play this back...

2015
02:35:46,421 --> 02:35:47,756
it's in celebration.

2016
02:35:49,007 --> 02:35:52,677
I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back.

2017
02:35:52,844 --> 02:35:56,765
And something like a normal version of the planet has been restored.

2018
02:35:56,932 --> 02:35:58,892
If there ever was such a thing.

2019
02:35:59,476 --> 02:36:02,479
God, what a world. Universe, now.

2020
02:36:03,438 --> 02:36:05,440
If you told me 10 years ago that we weren't alone...

2021
02:36:05,607 --> 02:36:09,277
let alone to this extent, I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised...

2022
02:36:09,444 --> 02:36:11,071
but come on, who knew?

2023
02:36:11,238 --> 02:36:15,867
The epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play.

2024
02:36:16,034 --> 02:36:17,744
And for better or worse...

2025
02:36:17,911 --> 02:36:22,082
that's the reality Morgan's gonna have to find a way to grow up in.

2026
02:36:25,335 --> 02:36:27,128
So, I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting...

2027
02:36:27,295 --> 02:36:30,924
in the case of an untimely death. On my part.

2028
02:36:31,091 --> 02:36:34,344
Not that death at any time isn't untimely.

2029
02:36:35,554 --> 02:36:38,598
This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow...

2030
02:36:38,765 --> 02:36:40,976
it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all.

2031
02:36:41,142 --> 02:36:42,602
That's the thing.

2032
02:36:44,563 --> 02:36:46,481
Then again, that's the hero gig, right?

2033
02:36:46,648 --> 02:36:47,732
Part of the journey is the end.

2034
02:36:49,734 --> 02:36:50,735
What am I even tripping for?

2035
02:36:50,902 --> 02:36:54,990
Everything is gonna work out exactly the way it's supposed to.

2036
02:36:58,493 --> 02:37:00,161
I love you 3,000.

2037
02:39:15,088 --> 02:39:18,842
You know, I wish there was a way that I could let her know.

2038
02:39:21,344 --> 02:39:23,471
That we won.

2039
02:39:24,848 --> 02:39:26,558
We did it.

2040
02:39:30,145 --> 02:39:31,938
She knows.

2041
02:39:36,818 --> 02:39:38,903
They both do.

2042
02:39:47,871 --> 02:39:48,955
How you doing, squirt?

2043
02:39:49,122 --> 02:39:50,123
Good.

2044
02:39:50,290 --> 02:39:51,624
- You good? - Mm-hmm.

2045
02:39:51,791 --> 02:39:54,502
- Good. You hungry? - Mm-hmm.

2046
02:39:54,919 --> 02:39:55,920
What do you want?

2047
02:39:56,629 --> 02:39:58,047
Cheeseburgers.

2048
02:40:02,844 --> 02:40:05,096
You know, your dad liked cheeseburgers.

2049
02:40:05,263 --> 02:40:06,681
Okay.

2050
02:40:09,267 --> 02:40:11,519
I'm gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want.

2051
02:40:11,686 --> 02:40:12,687
Okay.

2052
02:40:29,454 --> 02:40:30,872
So...

2053
02:40:31,122 --> 02:40:33,291
when can we expect you back?

2054
02:40:35,376 --> 02:40:36,711
About that...

2055
02:40:36,961 --> 02:40:39,130
Thor, your people need a king.

2056
02:40:39,297 --> 02:40:41,174
No, they already have one.

2057
02:40:43,301 --> 02:40:44,302
That's funny.

2058
02:40:49,891 --> 02:40:51,726
Are you being serious?

2059
02:40:55,396 --> 02:40:57,649
It's time for me to be who I am...

2060
02:40:58,233 --> 02:41:00,819
rather than who I'm supposed to be.

2061
02:41:02,111 --> 02:41:03,863
But you, you're a leader.

2062
02:41:04,489 --> 02:41:06,199
That's who you are.

2063
02:41:08,701 --> 02:41:10,662
You know, I'd make a lot of changes around here.

2064
02:41:10,829 --> 02:41:12,330
I'm counting on it...

2065
02:41:12,497 --> 02:41:13,998
Your Majesty.

2066
02:41:24,133 --> 02:41:25,343
What will you do?

2067
02:41:26,094 --> 02:41:27,512
I'm not sure.

2068
02:41:27,679 --> 02:41:31,224
For the first time in a thousand years, I have no path.

2069
02:41:31,391 --> 02:41:32,809
I do have a ride though.

2070
02:41:32,976 --> 02:41:34,936
Move it or lose it, hair bag.

2071
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:40,984
Here we are!

2072
02:41:41,442 --> 02:41:42,986
Tree, good to see you.

2073
02:41:47,574 --> 02:41:50,869
The Asgardians of the Galaxy back together again.

2074
02:41:51,286 --> 02:41:53,162
Where to first?

2075
02:41:54,289 --> 02:41:55,331
Hey.

2076
02:41:55,957 --> 02:41:57,917
Just so you know, this is my ship still.

2077
02:41:58,084 --> 02:41:59,085
I'm in charge.

2078
02:41:59,627 --> 02:42:02,171
I know. I know. Of course you are.

2079
02:42:02,338 --> 02:42:03,882
Of course.

2080
02:42:06,509 --> 02:42:09,053
See, you say, "Of course," but then you touch the map.

2081
02:42:09,220 --> 02:42:11,723
It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge.

2082
02:42:12,348 --> 02:42:13,683
Quail, that's your own insecurities in there.

2083
02:42:13,850 --> 02:42:14,851
Quail?

2084
02:42:15,018 --> 02:42:17,270
Okay? I am merely trying to be of service and assisting.

2085
02:42:17,437 --> 02:42:18,646
Quill.

2086
02:42:18,813 --> 02:42:19,689
That's what I said.

2087
02:42:19,856 --> 02:42:22,233
You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.

2088
02:42:22,400 --> 02:42:23,776
Sounds fair.

2089
02:42:26,529 --> 02:42:28,907
- It's not necessary, okay? - It's not.

2090
02:42:29,073 --> 02:42:31,451
I got some blasters, unless you guys wanna use knives.

2091
02:42:31,618 --> 02:42:33,828
Oh, yes! Please, use knives.

2092
02:42:33,995 --> 02:42:35,079
Yeah. Knives.

2093
02:42:35,246 --> 02:42:36,789
I am Groot.

2094
02:42:42,545 --> 02:42:43,922
Not necessary.

2095
02:42:44,088 --> 02:42:45,548
There shall be no knifing one another.

2096
02:42:45,715 --> 02:42:48,718
Everybody knows who's in charge.

2097
02:42:52,305 --> 02:42:53,514
Me.

2098
02:42:54,599 --> 02:42:55,433
Right?

2099
02:42:56,351 --> 02:42:58,561
Yes, you.

2100
02:42:58,811 --> 02:43:01,230
Of course! Of course.

2101
02:43:01,397 --> 02:43:03,066
Of course.

2102
02:43:04,817 --> 02:43:06,361
Remember...

2103
02:43:07,195 --> 02:43:09,489
you have to return the stones to the exact moment you got 'em...

2104
02:43:09,656 --> 02:43:12,867
or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities.

2105
02:43:13,034 --> 02:43:14,035
Don't worry, Bruce.

2106
02:43:14,577 --> 02:43:16,454
Clip all the branches.

2107
02:43:16,996 --> 02:43:18,748
You know, I tried.

2108
02:43:20,041 --> 02:43:24,253
When I had the gauntlet, the stones, I really tried to bring her back.

2109
02:43:27,548 --> 02:43:29,175
I miss her, man.

2110
02:43:29,550 --> 02:43:30,551
Me too.

2111
02:43:34,639 --> 02:43:37,058
You know, if you want, I could come with you.

2112
02:43:39,644 --> 02:43:41,104
You're a good man, Sam.

2113
02:43:41,646 --> 02:43:43,189
This one's on me, though.

2114
02:43:47,652 --> 02:43:49,570
Don't do anything stupid till I get back.

2115
02:43:51,406 --> 02:43:52,657
How can I?

2116
02:43:52,824 --> 02:43:54,617
You're taking all the stupid with you.

2117
02:44:02,208 --> 02:44:04,002
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2118
02:44:04,377 --> 02:44:05,878
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

2119
02:44:13,261 --> 02:44:15,054
How long is this gonna take?

2120
02:44:15,304 --> 02:44:18,057
For him, as long as he needs. For us, five seconds.

2121
02:44:23,146 --> 02:44:24,397
You ready, Cap?

2122
02:44:24,564 --> 02:44:26,983
All right, we'll meet you back here, okay?

2123
02:44:27,650 --> 02:44:28,776
You bet.

2124
02:44:30,278 --> 02:44:31,863
Going quantum. Three...

2125
02:44:32,447 --> 02:44:33,281
two...

2126
02:44:33,948 --> 02:44:35,158
one.

2127
02:44:37,035 --> 02:44:39,078
And returning in five...

2128
02:44:39,245 --> 02:44:40,204
four...

2129
02:44:40,371 --> 02:44:42,206
three, two...

2130
02:44:42,373 --> 02:44:43,708
one.

2131
02:44:50,965 --> 02:44:51,966
Where is he?

2132
02:44:52,133 --> 02:44:53,885
I don't know. He blew right by his time stamp.

2133
02:44:54,052 --> 02:44:55,511
He should be here.

2134
02:45:01,017 --> 02:45:01,934
Get him back.

2135
02:45:02,101 --> 02:45:03,227
- I'm trying. - Get him the hell back.

2136
02:45:03,394 --> 02:45:05,271
- Hey, I said I'm trying. - Sam.

2137
02:45:29,253 --> 02:45:30,838
Go ahead.

2138
02:45:48,815 --> 02:45:49,565
Cap?

2139
02:45:51,901 --> 02:45:53,653
Hi, Sam.

2140
02:45:56,656 --> 02:45:59,700
So, did something go wrong or did something go right?

2141
02:46:01,828 --> 02:46:05,665
Well, after I put the stones back, I thought...

2142
02:46:06,791 --> 02:46:08,126
maybe...

2143
02:46:08,626 --> 02:46:13,422
I'll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get.

2144
02:46:15,424 --> 02:46:17,552
How'd that work out for ya?

2145
02:46:20,054 --> 02:46:21,472
It was beautiful.

2146
02:46:22,807 --> 02:46:24,517
Good. I'm happy for you.

2147
02:46:24,684 --> 02:46:25,726
Truly.

2148
02:46:26,477 --> 02:46:27,770
Thank you.

2149
02:46:29,105 --> 02:46:30,356
Only thing bumming me out...

2150
02:46:30,523 --> 02:46:34,110
is the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America.

2151
02:46:37,905 --> 02:46:40,700
That reminds me.

2152
02:46:49,208 --> 02:46:50,418
Try it on.

2153
02:47:15,943 --> 02:47:17,445
How does it feel?

2154
02:47:20,031 --> 02:47:21,741
Like it's someone else's.

2155
02:47:24,785 --> 02:47:25,953
It isn't.

2156
02:47:39,300 --> 02:47:40,885
Thank you.

2157
02:47:42,595 --> 02:47:43,888
I'll do my best.

2158
02:47:49,268 --> 02:47:51,187
That's why it's yours.

2159
02:47:52,897 --> 02:47:54,273
You wanna tell me about her?

2160
02:48:00,863 --> 02:48:02,365
No.

2161
02:48:02,782 --> 02:48:04,909
No, I don't think I will.
