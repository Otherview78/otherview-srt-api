00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,740
You're lying.

3
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:32,207
Julie.

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,308
You know I can't, Sara.

5
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:34,744
Can't or won't?

6
00:00:34,777 --> 00:00:36,311
- That's not fair. - C'mon,

7
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:37,714
I know I don't need to tell you this,

8
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:39,448
but Mom and Dad aren't getting any younger.

9
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,350
And lately, Mom...

10
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:43,485
I don't know. She's not the same. She...

11
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:45,554
Mom is just fine.

12
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:47,422
And so is Dad and so am I

13
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:50,325
and all is right and well in the universe, Sara.

14
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:52,227
Stop creating issues where there aren't any.

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,697
Julie, it's their anniversary.

16
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:56,465
I just know they'd love it if you came.

17
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:58,768
I got them a bouquet.

18
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:01,336
They're renewing their wedding vows, Julie.

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,472
Mom's wearing a wedding gown

20
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:05,775
and you're sending flowers in your place?

21
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:07,577
I'm not.

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,344
I'm sending you to send flowers in my place.

23
00:01:09,378 --> 00:01:10,647
Well, that's convenient.

24
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:13,248
- Julie. - Oh, sorry.

25
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,917
Uh, Sara, actually...

26
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:16,653
I'm gonna need you to pick 'em up for me.

27
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:17,820
What? Your flowers?

28
00:01:17,854 --> 00:01:19,287
Oh, hang on.

29
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:20,723
Yeah. Yeah.

30
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:21,824
Okay. Hold on.

31
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:22,925
Sara, I gotta run.

32
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,559
Are you serious?

33
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:25,728
Yup. We'll talk soon.

34
00:01:25,762 --> 00:01:26,729
- Bye. - Okay, I love...

35
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:30,565
You.

36
00:01:55,892 --> 00:01:57,727
Hey!

37
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,194
Sorry, I'm late.

38
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:01,998
Got Julie's flowers.

39
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:04,634
Took me forever.

40
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,836
The girl at the flower shop was having issues

41
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,271
with her boyfriend and she wanted advice,

42
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:10,940
well, you know...

43
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:12,274
Oh, my God.

44
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,612
This looks amazing.

45
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,828
Mom?

46
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:34,597
Where are you guys?

47
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:38,701
Mom?

48
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,508
Mom?

49
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:52,749
Daddy?

50
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:11,033
Mom?

51
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,577
Hello?

52
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:48,638
Mom?

53
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:08,825
What's wrong, darling?

54
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,731
It's okay,

55
00:04:15,765 --> 00:04:17,934
it's what he wanted.

56
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:35,350
Don't be scared.

57
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:39,554
Everything's gonna be different now.

58
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,424
Mom?

59
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:44,894
No.

60
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:00,790
Sara?

61
00:08:00,823 --> 00:08:02,792
Sara?

62
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:04,126
Sweetie.

63
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:08,330
Hey.

64
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,669
How you feelin'?

65
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,004
Uh...

66
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:19,175
I don't know.

67
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,778
But I still can't remember anything.

68
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:25,114
Everything just seems...

69
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:27,750
Like...

70
00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:32,922
Can you remember your name?

71
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:36,625
Sara.

72
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,294
I don't know if I remember

73
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:40,930
or if it's because that's what you called me.

74
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:42,698
They said that might happen.

75
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,068
You lost a lot of blood.

76
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:49,305
Blood?

77
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,742
You don't remember?

78
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:55,744
Remember what?

79
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:02,751
I have to tell you something and it's not easy.

80
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:06,956
But I need you to know that you are completely safe now.

81
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,058
What?

82
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,793
I found you in the tub, Sara.

83
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:16,365
You tried to kill yourself.

84
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:20,336
No...

85
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:21,937
No, I didn't.

86
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:23,205
I wouldn't.

87
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,440
It's okay.

88
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,043
- I wouldn't. - Honey.

89
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:29,145
I'm sorry,

90
00:09:31,347 --> 00:09:33,415
I'm so sorry.

91
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:58,974
Sara, take a breath.

92
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:01,477
This is off.

93
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,480
- Everything's just off. - Just try to breathe

94
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:05,981
and we'll go through it.

95
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,751
But...

96
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:10,452
I don't remember anything.

97
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,321
Go slow.

98
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,128
They prepared me for this.

99
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,730
He said you'd more than likely lose any recollection.

100
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:23,232
- I would remember... - Sara.

101
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,402
It happened.

102
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,837
This doesn't make sense.

103
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:33,976
I am so sorry, I feel terrible.

104
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,445
And I was so busy with...

105
00:10:36,478 --> 00:10:38,480
my writing and I knew that you were down

106
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,082
but I never thought...

107
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,988
It's okay now.

108
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,156
I'm here for you.

109
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,757
Completely.

110
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:53,996
I'm scared.

111
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:59,335
Just rest.

112
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:04,039
I love you so much.

113
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:07,176
Everything is going to be different now.

114
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:57,526
Nick?

115
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,501
Hey!

116
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:42,071
Run!

117
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,843
Sh...

118
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,649
It's okay. Come here.

119
00:12:52,682 --> 00:12:54,917
- Hey. - I had the worst dream.

120
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,053
Nah, it's okay. I'm here.

121
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:00,222
It was just a dream, all right?

122
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:02,024
It was just a nightmare.

123
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:04,059
It seemed so real.

124
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,495
Here.

125
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:09,064
You take one of these.

126
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:11,200
Doctor gave them to me for you.

127
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:13,969
Help you relax.

128
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,504
I'll get you some water.

129
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:33,475
Hello?

130
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:35,043
Sara?

131
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:37,479
Yes. This is Sara.

132
00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:39,047
Are you there?

133
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:43,051
Are you there?

134
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:44,587
I'm so sorry...

135
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,189
- Sara. Are. You... - Nick!

136
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:50,559
Stop bothering my wife!

137
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:53,529
- Oh, God, you scared me. - I'm sorry, darling.

138
00:15:53,562 --> 00:15:55,632
I just couldn't let them bother you like that, not right now.

139
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:57,366
- I didn't not what to do... - No, it's all right.

140
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,067
It's all right. I mean, I should have ripped

141
00:15:59,101 --> 00:16:01,403
that old phone from the wall years ago.

142
00:16:01,436 --> 00:16:03,640
None of that matters now.

143
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:05,407
Just happy to see you up.

144
00:16:07,142 --> 00:16:09,144
How's your memory?

145
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,113
I only remember little things.

146
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:13,081
Oh yeah? Like what?

147
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:15,117
Family.

148
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,052
I know I have a sister.

149
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:19,822
And my parents.

150
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:21,423
Do you remember your parents?

151
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:23,225
I think so.

152
00:16:25,294 --> 00:16:27,195
Have they come to see me since I've been home?

153
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:31,500
You don't remember?

154
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,570
No, I don't.

155
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:36,371
Mom...

156
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:39,408
Sara, your parents are gone.

157
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:42,344
They died last October.

158
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:46,849
Sara...

159
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:49,719
It's your sister. She...

160
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:54,222
My parents are dead and so is my sister?

161
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:56,224
No, she's not dead, she's just...

162
00:16:58,527 --> 00:16:59,862
All right, look, I'm not gonna say

163
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:02,364
I blame her entirely for your accident

164
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,767
but the way that she handled your parents' will,

165
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:06,903
she manipulated them into giving her

166
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:08,805
almost everything and leaving you with nothing

167
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:10,339
but this big, empty house. I...

168
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:12,775
I just can't imagine a more selfish,

169
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:16,178
deplorable thing to do and to you,

170
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:17,279
her flesh and blood.

171
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:21,283
You spiraled down from there.

172
00:17:21,316 --> 00:17:23,886
You spiraled and yes, I blame her,

173
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,622
I blame her for a lot of this.

174
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:29,257
She is not to be trusted, Sara.

175
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:39,568
But that, all of that is in the past.

176
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:42,939
From now on, we're moving forward,

177
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:45,742
not looking back. You understand?

178
00:18:19,374 --> 00:18:20,710
Sara?

179
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,545
Nick, you startled me.

180
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:24,847
I'm sorry, darling,

181
00:18:24,881 --> 00:18:25,882
that certainly wasn't my intention.

182
00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:27,583
Who was that woman?

183
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:29,384
I think I saw you talking with her yesterday.

184
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:31,921
Oh, Rose?

185
00:18:31,954 --> 00:18:33,956
I hired her to help me take care of you

186
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,258
while doing my writing.

187
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,694
She's been here?

188
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:39,896
Yes, of course.

189
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:42,598
She's been taking great care of you.

190
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,835
You've been sleeping...

191
00:18:48,537 --> 00:18:49,739
which is a good thing.

192
00:18:56,646 --> 00:18:57,880
Are you okay?

193
00:19:00,449 --> 00:19:04,386
I... I think I remember you're my husband

194
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:07,422
but I don't remember any of our experiences.

195
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:10,325
I'm sorry.

196
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,527
What about our trip to Costa Rica?

197
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,669
Christmas dinner in Ojai?

198
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:22,404
Your mum's drunken confession? You were scarred for weeks.

199
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:31,748
The day that we moved in together

200
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:33,482
was the best day of my life.

201
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:41,724
I'm so sorry, Nick.

202
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:45,293
It's okay, It'll all come back to you.

203
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:48,563
Gotta get back to work.

204
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,701
Nick.

205
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:56,939
I love you.

206
00:19:59,742 --> 00:20:01,476
I love you, too.

207
00:20:36,913 --> 00:20:38,080
Nick?

208
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:47,149
What are you doing?

209
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:49,517
The third floor is off limits.

210
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,454
I... I was...

211
00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:54,924
Nick gave explicit orders to keep this door locked.

212
00:21:54,957 --> 00:21:56,592
But why?

213
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:59,962
The third floor has access to the roof.

214
00:22:06,102 --> 00:22:08,503
I've put fresh sheets on your bed.

215
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,706
You must continue to rest.

216
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:23,418
Rose...

217
00:22:25,221 --> 00:22:26,889
Where's the clock?

218
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:28,991
- The clock? - The grandfather clock.

219
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:32,228
I've been into all these rooms and I can't find it.

220
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:34,562
There's no grandfather clock.

221
00:22:34,597 --> 00:22:36,165
Perhaps you were dreaming it.

222
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:38,167
No, I've heard it when I've been awake,

223
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,870
I heard it just now.

224
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:43,571
I've been through all the rooms in this house

225
00:22:43,606 --> 00:22:45,540
and if there was a grandfather clock,

226
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,009
I would have seen it.

227
00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:48,577
Now you must rest.

228
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,480
That's all you need to do.

229
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,152
I'll tend to you soon.

230
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,175
You smell good.

231
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:22,111
I took a shower.

232
00:23:28,985 --> 00:23:31,854
Nick, where there photographs in the hallway?

233
00:23:34,023 --> 00:23:35,825
There were.

234
00:23:35,858 --> 00:23:37,727
But I had them removed.

235
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,028
Why?

236
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:48,570
You don't have to think about those things right now.

237
00:23:48,604 --> 00:23:50,673
But I'd like to see them, they might help me rememb...

238
00:23:50,706 --> 00:23:52,174
Sweetheart, you just went through

239
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,744
a very intense experience.

240
00:23:54,777 --> 00:23:57,113
Your sister, your parents,

241
00:23:57,146 --> 00:23:59,615
I just want you to clear your head of all of that.

242
00:24:00,783 --> 00:24:02,885
Just give it some time.

243
00:24:02,918 --> 00:24:03,986
We'll put 'em back up.

244
00:24:05,621 --> 00:24:06,922
And what tub?

245
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:08,556
What's that?

246
00:24:08,591 --> 00:24:11,227
You said you found me in the bathtub when I...

247
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:15,931
There's no tub in the bathroom.

248
00:24:15,965 --> 00:24:17,532
Oh, that.

249
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,301
I had it removed.

250
00:24:20,202 --> 00:24:21,904
There was no need for that bad memory

251
00:24:21,937 --> 00:24:23,839
to cement itself in this house.

252
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,178
What's wrong, Sara?

253
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:31,280
Don't you believe me?

254
00:24:31,313 --> 00:24:33,115
No, it's not that.

255
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:35,317
This all just feels like a strange dream.

256
00:24:35,351 --> 00:24:37,653
I don't know what's wrong with me.

257
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,157
You're so beautiful.

258
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:44,860
I'm sorry.

259
00:24:46,328 --> 00:24:48,030
Give it some time, okay?

260
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:50,866
If you need me, I'll be right here.

261
00:26:42,444 --> 00:26:45,114
You must continue to rest.

262
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:59,061
I just don't know what's wrong with her.

263
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:01,964
What is wrong with you...

264
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:05,935
There she is.

265
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:13,909
See, it's so strange.

266
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:18,080
My God.

267
00:27:18,814 --> 00:27:20,449
I told you.

268
00:27:34,797 --> 00:27:36,398
What is it?

269
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,478
Ah...

270
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:54,817
What's wrong with her?

271
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:04,893
What is wrong with you!

272
00:28:21,944 --> 00:28:23,112
Go.

273
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:41,997
Sara,.

274
00:28:42,031 --> 00:28:43,399
Who was that?

275
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:45,000
That was your sister.

276
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:46,535
The other person... They were in here and

277
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:48,837
- he was like, examining me... - Wait, what?

278
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:50,973
- I met them at the door. - Then how did they get up here?

279
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:52,541
No, I didn't let them in, Sara.

280
00:28:52,574 --> 00:28:53,842
They were here.

281
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:57,313
I know that you've been having very vivid dreams, Sara,

282
00:28:57,346 --> 00:28:59,415
but I'm not gonna ignore this one.

283
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:01,450
Your sister has gotten herself into some things.

284
00:29:01,483 --> 00:29:04,186
She's done things behind my back in the past,

285
00:29:04,219 --> 00:29:05,588
things that I don't agree with.

286
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:07,323
That's why I headed them off at the door.

287
00:29:08,658 --> 00:29:11,628
But I can assure you, darling, they were not up here.

288
00:29:11,661 --> 00:29:14,096
And they won't be as long as I'm around.

289
00:29:16,498 --> 00:29:18,934
Dr. Simms, let's just say...

290
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,170
I don't agree with his practices and leave it at that.

291
00:29:23,238 --> 00:29:25,307
My face looked horrible.

292
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,285
You're so fragile, Sara.

293
00:29:38,921 --> 00:29:40,590
I can't find you like that again.

294
00:29:41,658 --> 00:29:43,392
I won't let it happen.

295
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:47,129
I need you.

296
00:29:48,397 --> 00:29:49,498
Do you understand?

297
00:29:49,531 --> 00:29:50,600
Yes.

298
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:53,268
We have each other.

299
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:56,105
We don't need anyone else.

300
00:29:57,506 --> 00:29:58,574
I love you.

301
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:09,218
I will never leave you.

302
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,048
You're good.

303
00:30:40,082 --> 00:30:42,284
I didn't know you can play the piano.

304
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,689
Yeah, well, you...

305
00:30:47,624 --> 00:30:48,691
Right.

306
00:30:57,433 --> 00:30:59,368
How are you?

307
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:01,937
What do you mean?

308
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:04,674
How are you?

309
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:12,981
I miss you.

310
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:16,084
Who?

311
00:31:16,118 --> 00:31:18,420
Who was I?

312
00:31:18,454 --> 00:31:20,723
I just feel like such a burden

313
00:31:20,757 --> 00:31:22,224
trying to find out.

314
00:31:23,693 --> 00:31:25,294
You were everything.

315
00:31:26,328 --> 00:31:27,496
You were funny.

316
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,033
And kind, honest.

317
00:31:32,134 --> 00:31:34,269
Everything I could never be.

318
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:37,406
But you still are,

319
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:40,476
still will be...

320
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:42,478
even if you don't get your memories back.

321
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,149
What if we could start again?

322
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:50,319
A new life

323
00:31:50,352 --> 00:31:52,020
with new memories.

324
00:31:54,323 --> 00:31:55,592
I would love that.

325
00:31:56,626 --> 00:31:57,993
Like a second chance.

326
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:01,096
That's exactly what this is.

327
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:04,566
We're lucky

328
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,375
I didn't know you could play the piano.

329
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:18,180
Well, there's a lot about me you don't know.

330
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,318
I can't wait to find out.

331
00:32:46,275 --> 00:32:47,744
I can hear you with me.

332
00:32:50,546 --> 00:32:52,247
Give her strength.

333
00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:06,194
Hi.

334
00:33:06,228 --> 00:33:07,797
Hi.

335
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,298
How you feeling?

336
00:33:11,266 --> 00:33:13,268
I think I feel good.

337
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,805
Why good?

338
00:33:21,176 --> 00:33:22,645
I don't know.

339
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:27,449
Something about you.

340
00:33:28,785 --> 00:33:30,352
That look you give me.

341
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:33,522
What look?

342
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:36,525
Like, I belong here.

343
00:33:37,794 --> 00:33:39,261
With you.

344
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:41,396
You know what I think?

345
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:46,401
You're feeling it.

346
00:33:47,937 --> 00:33:50,339
Your power.

347
00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:52,775
which is why I was thinking...

348
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:54,644
you're ready.

349
00:33:56,278 --> 00:33:57,714
Ready for what?

350
00:33:58,948 --> 00:34:02,184
What would you say to a dinner party here?

351
00:34:02,217 --> 00:34:05,454
A few of our closest friends? A simple evening.

352
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:07,590
Some wine, some laughs.

353
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:10,258
It'd be good for you.

354
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:14,196
They've been asking about you.

355
00:34:15,932 --> 00:34:17,834
They're concerned about you.

356
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:20,202
Just want to see you well.

357
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:25,474
I think this will be really good.

358
00:34:53,535 --> 00:34:55,872
Oh, Rose, let me get that.

359
00:34:55,905 --> 00:34:57,607
No, it's okay. I've got it.

360
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,642
- Let me help you. - Nah, it's nothing.

361
00:34:59,676 --> 00:35:01,343
It's nothing.

362
00:35:03,713 --> 00:35:05,380
I'm s-sorry, Rose, I just wanted...

363
00:35:05,414 --> 00:35:07,516
When a woman says she doesn't need help,

364
00:35:07,549 --> 00:35:08,851
she doesn't need help.

365
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,387
It looked heavy.

366
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,906
Is something the matter with Rose?

367
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:34,376
Nick?

368
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:37,847
I don't think so.

369
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,615
Why?

370
00:35:39,649 --> 00:35:41,450
Well, we were outside and I was trying to help her

371
00:35:41,483 --> 00:35:43,452
and she just...

372
00:35:43,485 --> 00:35:45,554
Snapped at me.

373
00:35:45,588 --> 00:35:47,657
I didn't know what to do.

374
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,958
- Snapped? - Yes.

375
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:50,626
She snapped at me.

376
00:35:52,729 --> 00:35:54,030
Snap back.

377
00:35:54,063 --> 00:35:55,698
No, that's not me.

378
00:35:55,732 --> 00:35:58,533
Sara, you can't let people walk all over you.

379
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:00,502
That's the anger boiling inside.

380
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:02,004
I mean, if you're gonna get healthy, Sara,

381
00:36:02,038 --> 00:36:03,773
you have to, you've gotta let it out.

382
00:36:03,806 --> 00:36:05,608
- But not at Rose. - Why not?

383
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:07,442
She's the hired help. Not your mother.

384
00:36:07,476 --> 00:36:08,945
She's an employee.

385
00:36:08,978 --> 00:36:10,780
To be perfectly honest, it doesn't sound like

386
00:36:10,813 --> 00:36:12,582
something she'd do but if you say she snapped at you,

387
00:36:12,615 --> 00:36:14,817
- I believe you.. - It wasn't that big of a deal.

388
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:16,753
- I just... - I'll tell you what,

389
00:36:16,786 --> 00:36:18,788
the next time she gives you shit, you let her have it.

390
00:36:19,421 --> 00:36:20,857
Let's practice right now.

391
00:36:23,325 --> 00:36:24,493
What are you smiling at?

392
00:36:24,526 --> 00:36:26,294
You think I'm joking?

393
00:36:26,328 --> 00:36:27,562
Nick..

394
00:36:27,597 --> 00:36:29,397
Are you gonna let that old bitch

395
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:30,967
get the best of you?

396
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,501
- Nick, I can't... - Can't?

397
00:36:33,636 --> 00:36:35,437
Can't is a word for weaklings, Sara.

398
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,506
- Are you a weakling? - Please don't call me that.

399
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:39,942
I didn't call you anything. I asked if that's what you are.

400
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:41,811
- You're being mean. - The world is mean, Sara.

401
00:36:41,844 --> 00:36:43,411
You can't survive the world.

402
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:44,881
You almost didn't...

403
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:50,519
Good.

404
00:38:45,234 --> 00:38:46,501
Nick?

405
00:38:53,643 --> 00:38:55,645
- Sara? - I...

406
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,848
I woke up and you weren't there.

407
00:38:58,881 --> 00:38:59,949
What are you doing down here?

408
00:39:15,765 --> 00:39:18,701
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

409
00:40:47,256 --> 00:40:48,523
Hello.

410
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:51,994
Hi, Sara.

411
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:53,662
You are Sara Wright.

412
00:40:53,696 --> 00:40:55,731
Who are you?

413
00:40:55,765 --> 00:40:58,566
My name is Tom and I'm a friend of your sister's.

414
00:41:00,803 --> 00:41:02,338
Nick?

415
00:41:02,371 --> 00:41:04,040
She thought I could maybe help you.

416
00:41:05,341 --> 00:41:06,609
Why?

417
00:41:08,044 --> 00:41:10,946
She's worried about you, quite worried.

418
00:41:13,149 --> 00:41:15,785
We could all use a little help from time to time.

419
00:41:16,218 --> 00:41:18,054
Sometimes we get so lost,

420
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:20,555
we don't even realize we need help.

421
00:41:21,824 --> 00:41:23,726
But there's always crumbs, Sara,

422
00:41:23,759 --> 00:41:26,362
always leading us home,

423
00:41:26,395 --> 00:41:28,531
you just have to find them.

424
00:41:33,302 --> 00:41:36,138
Sometimes the voices in our head

425
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:37,940
are there to guide us.

426
00:41:37,973 --> 00:41:39,608
Follow us, Sara.

427
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,977
Follow us.

428
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,714
What are you doing?

429
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:51,087
There was a knock and you weren't there and...

430
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:56,592
There was a man.

431
00:41:59,095 --> 00:42:00,196
No, there wasn't.

432
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:07,136
I came downstairs and you were standing there

433
00:42:07,169 --> 00:42:09,238
- with the door open. - But this was real, Nick.

434
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:11,907
There was no one there, Sara.

435
00:42:11,941 --> 00:42:13,409
You saw it for yourself.

436
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:15,177
I can't do this.

437
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:17,046
I'm trying to help you. But if you don't trust me

438
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,081
- then I ca- - No, no... I trust you.

439
00:42:19,115 --> 00:42:21,183
Just please, please don't leave.

440
00:42:27,456 --> 00:42:28,824
Sara?

441
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:34,697
You understand that I'm doing this for your benefit.

442
00:42:35,998 --> 00:42:37,233
Right?

443
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:39,001
The world...

444
00:42:39,034 --> 00:42:41,804
has always taken advantage of your kindness, Sara.

445
00:42:43,205 --> 00:42:44,840
This is what the world does.

446
00:42:44,874 --> 00:42:47,209
It takes people like you

447
00:42:47,243 --> 00:42:50,412
and it sucks the marrow out and it leaves the rest to rot.

448
00:42:52,014 --> 00:42:54,316
I love you...

449
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:58,387
I love you too much to lift you out of another fucking tub.

450
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,156
Do you understand?

451
00:43:00,189 --> 00:43:02,358
I'm sorry.

452
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:04,660
I'm so sorry.

453
00:43:12,001 --> 00:43:13,836
I have something for you.

454
00:43:22,211 --> 00:43:24,113
- Do you like it? - Oh, my goodness.

455
00:43:25,214 --> 00:43:26,348
It's beautiful, Nick.

456
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:28,884
Oh, my goodness.

457
00:43:28,918 --> 00:43:30,286
I was thinking you could wear it

458
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,987
to the dinner party tomorrow night.

459
00:43:35,324 --> 00:43:37,026
The party.

460
00:43:37,059 --> 00:43:38,394
We'll be ready.

461
00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:48,137
Sara?

462
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:51,273
You there?

463
00:43:52,942 --> 00:43:54,443
Sara!

464
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:31,747
Ah!

465
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:35,150
Sara?

466
00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:38,053
Sara?

467
00:44:38,087 --> 00:44:39,521
Sara!

468
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:41,056
Sara!

469
00:45:42,151 --> 00:45:44,019
Who are you?

470
00:45:46,656 --> 00:45:47,923
Sara.

471
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:49,491
Listen to me.

472
00:45:50,893 --> 00:45:52,595
Sara.

473
00:45:57,399 --> 00:45:59,134
You know you.

474
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:02,037
Sara!

475
00:46:02,071 --> 00:46:03,405
Stay with me.

476
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:07,242
Stay with me, you little bitch!

477
00:46:07,276 --> 00:46:10,079
Everything's going to be all right.

478
00:46:10,112 --> 00:46:11,980
You're with me now.

479
00:46:14,584 --> 00:46:16,185
No, no!

480
00:46:16,218 --> 00:46:18,420
Sara, Sara, it's over.

481
00:46:18,454 --> 00:46:20,489
It's over. It's over.

482
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:23,626
I'm here.

483
00:46:39,642 --> 00:46:41,644
You're looking well.

484
00:46:41,678 --> 00:46:43,212
I don't feel well.

485
00:46:43,245 --> 00:46:45,615
Nick told me to prepare a ham.

486
00:46:45,648 --> 00:46:48,217
I hope you're well enough to receive guests.

487
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,121
How do you get here?

488
00:46:53,956 --> 00:46:55,157
I take the bus.

489
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:57,627
I've never seen a bus pass this house.

490
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,561
It drops me off down the road

491
00:46:59,596 --> 00:47:01,296
and then I walk up.

492
00:47:02,965 --> 00:47:05,000
- Where do you live? - In town.

493
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:07,236
Do you live alone?

494
00:47:09,338 --> 00:47:11,106
I'm a widow.

495
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:15,110
Rose, I'd like you to make sure

496
00:47:15,144 --> 00:47:17,312
the dining room is spotless tonight.

497
00:47:17,346 --> 00:47:20,516
I believe that the dining room is up to Nick's standards.

498
00:47:23,218 --> 00:47:24,987
What about my standards?

499
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:30,092
Rose.

500
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:32,194
Well, if you're so concerned about it,

501
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:34,196
maybe you should do it yourself.

502
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:39,001
All I'm saying is if you want it done right...

503
00:47:39,034 --> 00:47:41,170
I could do it, Rose.

504
00:47:41,203 --> 00:47:43,338
Nick would never fuck you then.

505
00:47:44,473 --> 00:47:45,675
What did you just say?

506
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,378
Rose.

507
00:47:50,012 --> 00:47:51,714
- Rose. - As a matter of fact,

508
00:47:51,748 --> 00:47:53,583
you're not looking well at all. Perhaps you should lie down.

509
00:47:53,616 --> 00:47:55,117
Rose, what did you just say?

510
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:56,619
I watch him in the shower sometimes,

511
00:47:57,286 --> 00:47:58,420
when you're sleeping.

512
00:47:58,454 --> 00:47:59,689
He's caught me a few times.

513
00:47:59,722 --> 00:48:01,356
He doesn't seem to mind.

514
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:03,358
Just keep lathering chest.

515
00:48:03,392 --> 00:48:05,762
- Stop. - I think he enjoys it.

516
00:48:05,795 --> 00:48:07,664
Sara?

517
00:48:07,697 --> 00:48:08,964
Sara?

518
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:12,401
Are you all right, dear?

519
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:14,369
You're not looking well at all.

520
00:48:14,403 --> 00:48:16,238
Perhaps you should lie down.

521
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:19,208
Don't ever talk about him like that.

522
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:21,443
About who, dear? What are you talking about?

523
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:25,247
Please, please just go.

524
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,015
Are you all right, dear?

525
00:48:27,049 --> 00:48:28,785
Please go.

526
00:48:28,818 --> 00:48:30,486
What about the laundry?

527
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:32,187
You're fired.

528
00:49:49,632 --> 00:49:51,601
Sara!

529
00:49:58,908 --> 00:50:01,109
We can call the whole thing off.

530
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:02,612
Just say the word.

531
00:50:08,851 --> 00:50:10,118
No.

532
00:50:10,687 --> 00:50:12,554
I went out to the garden.

533
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:14,489
I couldn't find...

534
00:50:15,457 --> 00:50:17,359
whatever it was that you described.

535
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:19,662
It was just a pile of weeds.

536
00:50:23,298 --> 00:50:24,566
I'm sorry about Rose...

537
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:26,335
Don't apologize about Rose.

538
00:50:26,368 --> 00:50:27,737
You are the woman of the house

539
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,404
and you did what needed to be done.

540
00:50:31,173 --> 00:50:32,507
I'm proud of you.

541
00:51:08,678 --> 00:51:10,245
I'm nervous.

542
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,649
Pre-dinner courage?

543
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:15,150
Thank you.

544
00:51:21,591 --> 00:51:23,225
Mm.

545
00:51:23,258 --> 00:51:24,594
That's strong.

546
00:51:24,627 --> 00:51:26,395
Like you.

547
00:51:26,428 --> 00:51:28,698
I'm gonna head downstairs. You'll be fine.

548
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,835
Sara?

549
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:33,936
Yes?

550
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:37,539
I may show off a little tonight.

551
00:51:37,572 --> 00:51:39,508
Just been so long and I want everyone

552
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:41,476
to think that we're back to normal.

553
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:43,613
Or at least close to it.

554
00:51:43,646 --> 00:51:45,380
I hope that's okay.

555
00:51:45,414 --> 00:51:46,716
I understand.

556
00:51:46,749 --> 00:51:47,817
I love you.

557
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,819
I love you, too.

558
00:53:56,045 --> 00:53:57,512
You look fantastic.

559
00:53:57,546 --> 00:53:59,447
Thank you.

560
00:54:01,984 --> 00:54:05,888
Friends, I would like to reintroduce you

561
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:08,390
to Mrs. Sara Wright.

562
00:54:10,425 --> 00:54:12,061
Um, thank you.

563
00:54:12,094 --> 00:54:14,030
Thank you all for coming.

564
00:54:14,063 --> 00:54:17,532
I may not remember who you are but I'm glad you're here.

565
00:54:27,877 --> 00:54:29,377
What's that?

566
00:54:29,411 --> 00:54:31,080
Well, that's for you. After dinner.

567
00:54:32,748 --> 00:54:34,449
Here, sit right here.

568
00:54:38,087 --> 00:54:40,156
Sara, why don't you get reacquainted with everybody?

569
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:41,757
I'm gonna go check on the pork.

570
00:54:50,766 --> 00:54:53,636
It's so good to see you, Sara.

571
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:56,105
You are looking very fine.

572
00:54:56,939 --> 00:54:58,573
- Thank you... - Is it true?

573
00:54:58,608 --> 00:55:00,176
You don't remember a thing?

574
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:02,645
Things are slowly coming back to me.

575
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:04,881
Surely, you remember Madeleine and I.

576
00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:12,420
Wow. Is that the first...

577
00:55:12,454 --> 00:55:14,891
Nick, that looks amazing.

578
00:55:14,924 --> 00:55:16,025
Sure does.

579
00:55:16,058 --> 00:55:18,027
It's gonna taste even better.

580
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,196
Isn't that right, Bobby.

581
00:55:20,229 --> 00:55:22,698
I think I deserve a little credit.

582
00:55:25,735 --> 00:55:27,603
Hi.

583
00:55:29,571 --> 00:55:30,740
Nick.

584
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:37,613
Sara, she said that she didn't say anything to you.

585
00:55:37,647 --> 00:55:39,749
Plus, I had no idea how to cook the pork.

586
00:55:44,186 --> 00:55:46,088
Mm, pork.

587
00:55:46,122 --> 00:55:48,758
I'd eat my own body weight, if I could.

588
00:55:50,558 --> 00:55:52,094
You know, it's funny, you put it like that, Bobby.

589
00:55:52,128 --> 00:55:53,829
I was reading something earlier

590
00:55:53,863 --> 00:55:55,563
for this thing I'm working on about cannibalism.

591
00:55:55,598 --> 00:55:57,900
Do you know what cannibals call human flesh?

592
00:55:57,934 --> 00:55:59,567
They call it long pig.

593
00:56:00,269 --> 00:56:02,504
That's it, Bobby. And they say

594
00:56:02,537 --> 00:56:04,907
human flesh tastes like pork.

595
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,210
Now, apparently, cannibals do what they do

596
00:56:08,244 --> 00:56:10,746
to acquire the power of the person they're eating.

597
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,748
They don't eat the whole person, mind you,

598
00:56:12,782 --> 00:56:14,116
just the important bits.

599
00:56:14,817 --> 00:56:17,853
The Korowai tribe of New Guinea still practice it.

600
00:56:17,887 --> 00:56:20,790
I mean, really, people have been practicing cannibalism

601
00:56:20,823 --> 00:56:23,059
since the beginning.

602
00:56:23,092 --> 00:56:25,628
Neanderthal eating Neanderthal

603
00:56:25,661 --> 00:56:27,596
then modern man shows up and eats Neanderthal.

604
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:30,066
And obviously modern man eats modern man.

605
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,001
Huh?

606
00:56:32,034 --> 00:56:33,102
When you think about it, though,

607
00:56:33,135 --> 00:56:34,536
nothing's really changed.

608
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:38,107
Your husband has a gift

609
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,775
for dinner conversation, doesn't he?

610
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,650
Well, I would like to propose a toast

611
00:56:47,683 --> 00:56:49,251
to our lovely Sara.

612
00:56:49,285 --> 00:56:51,087
May your recovery be swift

613
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,689
and may this night mark a rebirth for you.

614
00:56:53,723 --> 00:56:55,157
- Salud. - Salud...

615
00:56:55,191 --> 00:56:56,659
Oh, and to Nick

616
00:56:56,692 --> 00:56:58,728
for cooking this extravagant meal

617
00:56:58,761 --> 00:57:01,230
and hosting this...

618
00:57:01,263 --> 00:57:02,999
very special evening.

619
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:05,801
- Salud. - Salud.

620
00:57:05,835 --> 00:57:09,772
To all of you for coming up and supporting us.

621
00:57:11,073 --> 00:57:12,808
It has not been an easy process

622
00:57:12,842 --> 00:57:16,544
but I feel confident that we're on the homestretch.

623
00:57:16,579 --> 00:57:18,948
But mostly to my wife...

624
00:57:21,017 --> 00:57:24,120
without whom I wouldn't have a home.

625
00:57:24,153 --> 00:57:25,520
Or purpose.

626
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:32,294
Watching you strengthen lately has really filled my heart.

627
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:40,136
To never looking back.

628
00:57:40,169 --> 00:57:41,704
To never looking back.

629
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,573
Sara.

630
00:57:49,945 --> 00:57:51,180
Someone's outside.

631
00:57:51,213 --> 00:57:52,915
Sorry, what did you see?

632
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:55,918
- I thought... - Sara.

633
00:57:57,153 --> 00:57:58,721
There's nobody outside.

634
00:57:58,754 --> 00:57:59,989
How many of these have you had?

635
00:58:00,022 --> 00:58:01,624
Sara, maybe you saw

636
00:58:01,657 --> 00:58:03,592
your reflection in the glass or something.

637
00:58:03,626 --> 00:58:04,894
Sara, where did you get that dress?

638
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,062
It's spectacular.

639
00:58:06,095 --> 00:58:07,830
Um.... Nick.

640
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:12,234
Oh... Handsome, charming and great taste.

641
00:58:12,268 --> 00:58:13,836
Come on. What are you waiting for?

642
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:14,937
Dig in.

643
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:27,983
Can I help you, Rose?

644
00:58:29,752 --> 00:58:31,087
The key.

645
00:58:34,323 --> 00:58:35,758
Mm.

646
00:58:38,194 --> 00:58:39,728
Mm.

647
00:58:42,198 --> 00:58:45,801
Yeah. Everybody, we need to loosen up.

648
00:58:45,835 --> 00:58:48,304
Drink. I want to see empty glasses. Come on.

649
00:58:49,672 --> 00:58:51,307
Somebody get me another drink.

650
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,776
Now, that's the spirit. I mean, this is a party, right?

651
00:58:56,312 --> 00:58:58,147
It's a party.

652
00:59:29,378 --> 00:59:31,147
Get your hand off my leg.

653
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:53,402
Don't you ever touch me again, you filthy, fucking pig.

654
00:59:53,435 --> 00:59:55,804
- I hate you! - I hate you!

655
00:59:55,838 --> 00:59:57,273
There she is.

656
00:59:59,341 --> 01:00:02,411
- Inappropriate. - Too much to drink, Bobby.

657
01:00:02,444 --> 01:00:04,079
Come on. Get him out of here.

658
01:00:11,086 --> 01:00:12,721
This is what I call a party.

659
01:00:16,959 --> 01:00:18,160
Woo!

660
01:00:36,478 --> 01:00:38,080
Sara.

661
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:21,050
Look.

662
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:22,951
What you've done.

663
01:02:24,486 --> 01:02:27,356
So beautiful.

664
01:02:29,191 --> 01:02:30,492
I didn't.

665
01:02:32,995 --> 01:02:34,063
You did.

666
01:02:34,096 --> 01:02:35,931
No. I didn't.

667
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:38,167
You took the final step.

668
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,437
Now, we can truly begin.

669
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,305
You bit the apple, Sara.

670
01:02:43,339 --> 01:02:45,140
This is your Eden.

671
01:02:46,475 --> 01:02:49,244
Your baptism, the place of your rebirth.

672
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:50,979
What?

673
01:02:51,013 --> 01:02:52,649
- What's going on? - Do you remember

674
01:02:52,682 --> 01:02:56,218
sitting in this very tub and letting go?

675
01:02:56,251 --> 01:02:58,287
Do you remember calling to me?

676
01:03:01,423 --> 01:03:04,893
I have never heard music sweeter than

677
01:03:04,927 --> 01:03:07,563
the sound of the razor kissing your wrists.

678
01:03:40,996 --> 01:03:42,297
But you...

679
01:03:43,733 --> 01:03:45,501
don't worry about anything.

680
01:03:46,568 --> 01:03:48,303
I didn't kill him.

681
01:03:48,337 --> 01:03:50,105
I just wanted him to stop touching me.

682
01:03:50,139 --> 01:03:53,108
You don't have to be scared. Anymore.

683
01:03:54,644 --> 01:03:57,580
Just let me get you home and I'll explain it all.

684
01:03:58,514 --> 01:03:59,582
I am home.

685
01:04:00,683 --> 01:04:02,217
No.

686
01:04:10,492 --> 01:04:11,628
No, please.

687
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:18,567
What's wrong, darling?

688
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:20,569
Oh, honey, you can't leave us.

689
01:04:32,582 --> 01:04:34,082
Sara, open the door!

690
01:04:34,116 --> 01:04:35,718
What are you?

691
01:04:35,752 --> 01:04:37,519
I'm your husband.

692
01:04:46,195 --> 01:04:47,362
Sweetheart.

693
01:04:50,232 --> 01:04:51,533
Sweetheart.

694
01:04:59,541 --> 01:05:01,210
Sara, you're not well.

695
01:05:01,744 --> 01:05:05,247
You just stabbed Bobby in the neck with a fork.

696
01:05:08,751 --> 01:05:10,252
Get out!

697
01:06:25,394 --> 01:06:27,296
Follow us.

698
01:06:44,413 --> 01:06:46,114
Sara?

699
01:07:01,698 --> 01:07:02,799
Hmm?

700
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:57,279
Sara.

701
01:08:59,514 --> 01:09:01,349
Listen to me.

702
01:09:07,456 --> 01:09:09,025
Listen to me.

703
01:09:09,058 --> 01:09:11,326
Sara.

704
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:17,566
She thought I could maybe help you.

705
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,475
Do you really want to die?

706
01:09:29,946 --> 01:09:31,914
Is that what you want?

707
01:09:31,948 --> 01:09:33,983
Sara.

708
01:09:38,553 --> 01:09:39,756
Sara.

709
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:43,358
Sara! Follow us.

710
01:09:43,391 --> 01:09:45,327
The key's in your hand!

711
01:09:46,896 --> 01:09:48,330
You wouldn't do it, would you?

712
01:09:50,565 --> 01:09:52,635
Sara, Sara, just listen to me,

713
01:09:52,668 --> 01:09:55,671
my voice. No one else.

714
01:09:55,705 --> 01:09:59,609
Sara. What do you see?

715
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:02,044
You can hear him.

716
01:10:02,078 --> 01:10:04,446
Don't let them do this to you.

717
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:06,015
Sara, just listen to me.

718
01:10:07,382 --> 01:10:10,318
I won't pick up your dead body again.

719
01:10:11,754 --> 01:10:13,022
I can't.

720
01:10:15,357 --> 01:10:17,827
The voices led the razors to your wrists.

721
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:19,061
Sara, he's lying.

722
01:10:20,562 --> 01:10:22,064
I'm your husband.

723
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:25,034
I love you.

724
01:10:25,067 --> 01:10:28,537
So, please, please don't do that to me again.

725
01:10:29,571 --> 01:10:33,475
This is exactly what they did to you the last time.

726
01:10:39,481 --> 01:10:40,549
Amen.

727
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:49,859
You are seeing things that aren't there, Sara.

728
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:57,499
Sara, hey.

729
01:11:00,002 --> 01:11:01,704
I'm with you now.

730
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,690
I love you so much.

731
01:11:38,774 --> 01:11:41,911
Trust me, I'll keep you safe.

732
01:11:48,117 --> 01:11:52,788
Everything is going to be different now.

733
01:12:01,063 --> 01:12:04,432
Amen.

734
01:12:09,705 --> 01:12:10,806
Sara, he's lying!

735
01:12:31,761 --> 01:12:32,828
Leave her now!

736
01:12:44,807 --> 01:12:45,875
Leave her now!

737
01:12:48,978 --> 01:12:50,179
Leave this earth!

738
01:12:55,685 --> 01:12:57,186
In the name of God Himself!

739
01:12:57,219 --> 01:12:58,721
Take me!

740
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:05,227
I cast you out.

741
01:13:05,261 --> 01:13:06,829
Out, demon!

742
01:13:09,131 --> 01:13:10,833
I cast you out!

743
01:13:13,736 --> 01:13:15,537
Out!

744
01:13:40,196 --> 01:13:41,664
It is done.

745
01:14:03,285 --> 01:14:05,221
Her vitals are fine.

746
01:14:05,254 --> 01:14:06,856
Everything seems to be okay, here.

747
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:10,760
Thank for your help, Mike.

748
01:14:13,629 --> 01:14:14,830
Ladies.

749
01:14:21,771 --> 01:14:24,006
Well, I've never heard of anything like this before.

750
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,008
Victims of possession

751
01:14:26,042 --> 01:14:27,843
don't usually remember being possessed.

752
01:14:29,178 --> 01:14:31,981
It seemed so real. He...

753
01:14:33,315 --> 01:14:35,017
felt like my husband.

754
01:14:35,051 --> 01:14:37,019
It, Sara. Not he.

755
01:14:37,053 --> 01:14:39,855
You mustn't continue to give strength to its illusions.

756
01:14:40,723 --> 01:14:42,224
This isn't over yet.

757
01:14:42,258 --> 01:14:45,995
The entity is purged but you're still vulnerable.

758
01:14:46,796 --> 01:14:49,865
When a demon, or in this case demons,

759
01:14:49,899 --> 01:14:51,901
exit the host,

760
01:14:51,934 --> 01:14:55,237
they don't leave the soul as it was before the invasion.

761
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:59,175
A hole is left behind, a void,

762
01:15:00,776 --> 01:15:02,912
a pocket of darkness.

763
01:15:02,945 --> 01:15:05,347
You can feel it, can't you?

764
01:15:05,381 --> 01:15:07,783
It will eventually go away.

765
01:15:09,919 --> 01:15:12,121
Be cautious, Sarah.

766
01:15:12,154 --> 01:15:14,023
Strengthen your faith.

767
01:15:15,424 --> 01:15:16,692
Fill that hole

768
01:15:17,426 --> 01:15:18,894
with light.

769
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:23,666
And, Julie, watch over her.

770
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:25,234
Take care of her.

771
01:15:25,267 --> 01:15:27,169
Be her lighthouse.

772
01:16:19,255 --> 01:16:21,790
Sara, I'm gonna make some tea.

773
01:16:21,824 --> 01:16:23,959
You want some?

774
01:16:27,096 --> 01:16:29,098
That sounds good, actually.

775
01:16:40,442 --> 01:16:42,745
Doc gave me these to give to you.

776
01:16:53,055 --> 01:16:54,223
Sara.

777
01:16:59,428 --> 01:17:01,764
I was the one who found you.

778
01:17:03,299 --> 01:17:05,734
In the bathtub with a razor blade.

779
01:17:07,336 --> 01:17:11,040
I can't even begin to describe what that did to me.

780
01:17:12,074 --> 01:17:14,376
I know living here must be a constant reminder

781
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:16,145
of what happened to Mom and Dad

782
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:18,480
but, you know, you can always talk to me

783
01:17:18,514 --> 01:17:21,417
about whatever, whenever, right?

784
01:17:22,051 --> 01:17:25,888
Come to me when you're feeling sad.

785
01:17:25,921 --> 01:17:29,058
Let's talk it out together, okay?

786
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:30,459
Julie, I am so sorry.

787
01:17:30,492 --> 01:17:32,861
I know. Don't apologize.

788
01:17:32,895 --> 01:17:35,064
- I never... - You don't need to apologize.

789
01:17:38,467 --> 01:17:41,770
Just know from now on everything is gonna be alright.

790
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,276
You're with me now.

791
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:51,947
The doctor gave them to me for you, help you relax.

792
01:17:55,117 --> 01:17:56,452
Take me!

793
01:18:06,996 --> 01:18:09,531
Everything's gonna be different now.

794
01:18:28,586 --> 01:18:32,297
