1
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,646
Hank: Stark!

2
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,272
Howard: He doesn't seem happy.

3
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,690
Hello, Hank.

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,027
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

5
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,862
I took a detour...

6
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,074
Through your defense lab.

7
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,160
Tell me that isn't what I think it is.

8
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:39,248
That depends if you think it's a poor attempt to replicate my work.

9
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,626
Even for this group, that takes nerve.

10
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,211
You were instructed to go to Russia.

11
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,296
May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you're a soldier...

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,506
I'm a scientist.

13
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,216
Then act like one.

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,899
The pym particle is the most revolutionary science ever developed.

15
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,053
Help us put it to good use.

16
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,556
I let you turn me into your errand boy,

17
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,558
and now you try to steal my research?

18
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:01,937
If only you'd protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,610
Easy, Hank.

20
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,614
You mention my wife again

21
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,741
and I'll show you ferocity.

22
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,410
Don't look at me. You said it.

23
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,830
I formally tender my resignation.

24
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,207
We don't accept it. Formally.

25
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,584
Hank,

26
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,377
we need you.

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,796
The pym particle is a miracle. Please.

28
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,173
Don't let your past determine the future.

29
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,176
As long as I am alive,

30
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,763
nobody will ever get that formula.

31
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,439
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

32
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,750
You've already lied to him. Now you want to go to war with him?

33
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,318
Yes.

34
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,404
Our scientists haven't come close to replicating his work.

35
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,531
He just kicked your ass, full-size.

36
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,495
You really want to find out what it's like when you can't see him coming?

37
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,786
I've known Hank pym for a long time.

38
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,330
He's no security risk.

39
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,250
Unless we make him one.

40
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,248
You like that?

41
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,809
You like that?

42
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,251
Come get you some now.

43
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,014
You didn't even move.

44
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,598
Nah.

45
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,911
What if I come in on the left side, right? Just down here.

46
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:05,936
You see this right here?

47
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,279
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.

48
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,198
I'm gonna miss you, too, peachy.

49
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,035
Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals.

50
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,079
Guard: All right, break it up.

51
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,456
Guard 2: Break it up! Break it up!

52
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,850
Scotty!

53
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,685
What's up, man!

54
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,228
Damn! Hey.

55
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,605
Ha-ha! Hey, man.

56
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,734
Hey, what's up with your eye?

57
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,903
Oh. Well, what do you think? Peachy. It's a going-away present.

58
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,864
Oh, yeah. I still got my scar from a year ago.

59
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,907
- Oh, yeah. - Yeah.

60
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,119
You know what? I'm still the only one who knocked him out.

61
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,329
Well, I definitely didn't.

62
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,440
Thanks for picking me up, brother.

63
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,001
Luis: Bro, you think I'm gonna miss my celly getting out?

64
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,377
Hey, how's your girl, man?

65
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,628
Oh, she left me.

66
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,548
- Oh. - Yeah, my ma died, too.

67
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,884
And my dad got deported.

68
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,511
But I got the Van!

69
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,096
- It's nice. - Yeah, right?

70
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,033
Scott: Thanks for the hook-up, too. I needed a place to stay.

71
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,411
You wait till you see this couch. You're gonna be really happy.

72
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,954
You're gonna be on your feet in no time. Watch.

73
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,438
- I hope so. - Yeah.

74
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,167
And I gotta introduce you to some people. Some really skilled people.

75
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,817
- Not interested. - Yeah, right.

76
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,236
No, I'm serious, man. I'm not going back.

77
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,782
I got a daughter to take care of.

78
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,075
You know thatjobs don't come easy for ex-cons, right?

79
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,078
Look, man, I got a master's in electrical engineering, all right?

80
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,997
I'm gonna be fine.

81
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,627
Welcome to baskin-Robbins.

82
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,712
Would you like to try our mango fruit blast?

83
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,797
Uh, no, thanks.

84
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,300
Um, I will have... I'll have a burger, please.

85
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,928
Oh, we don't... we don't make that.

86
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,931
Pretzel. Hot pretzel. Like, mustard... Do you have mustard dip?

87
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,891
It's ice cream. Baskin-Robbins.

88
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,436
I'll just do, like, whatever's hot and fresh.

89
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,104
Dude.

90
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,981
Can I see you in the back, chief? Pronto.

91
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,650
Sure thing, Dale.

92
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,487
Darby, could you just, uh, take care of this idiot? Thanks.

93
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,450
- Hey, Dale. - Come on in.

94
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,244
Pull up some chair.

95
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,915
Three years at San Quentin, huh?

96
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,166
You found out.

97
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,502
Baskin-Robbins always finds out.

98
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,963
Look, I'm sorry, all right? But I...

99
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,673
No one would hire me.

100
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,175
Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.

101
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,427
Look, I'm sorry.

102
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,971
I don't do it anymore. I just...

103
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,055
Respect.

104
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,408
I couldn't be happier about it.

105
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,809
- Really? - Yeah.

106
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,853
Thank you. Thank you.

107
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,522
You really stuck it to those billionaire sobs.

108
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,108
The more I read about what you did and stuff...

109
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,694
I'm like, "wow, I know this guy?

110
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,863
"I'm in charge of this guy?"

111
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,323
Well, I'm very happy in this job,

112
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,701
and I really just appreciate the opportunity to...

113
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,244
Well, you're fired, of course.

114
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,039
I can't really keep you on.

115
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,791
Wait, what? Fired?

116
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:15,959
Yeah.

117
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,104
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime. I mean, I'm a good worker.

118
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:21,006
No, it wasn't a violent crime. It was a cool crime.

119
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,382
I'll tell you what, though.

120
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,635
This will be totally off the books, off the records,

121
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,722
but if you want to grab one of those mango fruit blasts

122
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,098
on your way out the door,

123
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,642
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.

124
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,515
Hey, Scotty. What's up?

125
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,768
I thought you were supposed to be at work.

126
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,686
I was. I got fired.

127
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,521
Damn. They find out who you are?

128
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,606
Yeah.

129
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,441
Luis: Baskin-Robbins always finds out, bro.

130
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,443
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

131
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,738
- You want some waffles? - Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

132
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,281
Oh. That's Kurt.

133
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,685
He was folsom for five years. He's a wizard on that laptop.

134
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,037
- Nice meet you. - Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

135
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:35,956
Who are you?

136
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,374
Dave.

137
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,251
Nice work on the vista job.

138
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,504
Vista job, yes.

139
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,048
No, no. I have heard of this robbery.

140
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,510
Well, technically, I didn't Rob them. Robbery involves threat.

141
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,304
I hate violence. I burgled them. I'm a cat burglar.

142
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,806
You mean you're a pussy.

143
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,974
Yeah.

144
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,892
They were overcharging the customers, right?

145
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,435
And it added up to millions.

146
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,396
He blows the whistle and he gets fired.

147
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,231
And what does he do?

148
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,233
He hacks into the security system

149
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,986
and transfers millions back to the people that they stole it from.

150
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,989
Posts all the bank records online.

151
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,231
And he drove the dude's Bentley into his swimming pool.

152
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,703
What are you doing?

153
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,915
Why are you telling my life story to these guys?

154
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,250
What do you want?

155
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,334
Luis: Okay.

156
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,837
My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago

157
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,172
- about this little perfectjob. - No way.

158
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,675
No, no, no. Wait! This guy... this guy fits your m.O.

159
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,095
I'm finished, man. I'm not going back to jail.

160
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,281
It's some retired millionaire living off his golden parachute.

161
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,266
It's a perfect Scott lang Mark!

162
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,435
I don't care. I'm out.

163
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,496
Dr. Pym?

164
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,999
Yes. I'm still alive.

165
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,090
ID?

166
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,635
Hank: Perhaps that will suffice.

167
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,848
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.

168
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,144
Is that Hank pym?

169
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,524
Good morning, Hank.

170
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:28,777
Hope.

171
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,362
Would it kill you to call me dad?

172
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,200
Dr. Cross will be so pleased that you could find the time to join us today.

173
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,660
More like "thrilled."

174
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:42,248
I was surprised to receive any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

175
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,750
What's the occasion?

176
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,710
Oh, you'll see. Won't he, hope?

177
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,925
We're ready for you inside.

178
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,094
Ouch.

179
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,640
I guess some old wounds never heal, huh?

180
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,391
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

181
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,354
You're in for a treat.

182
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,777
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym. How's retirement?

183
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,029
How's your face?

184
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,826
After you.

185
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,628
Now, before we start, I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

186
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,047
This company's founder and my mentor,

187
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,757
Dr. Hank pym.

188
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,358
When I took over this company for Dr. Pym,

189
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,652
I immediately started researching a particle

190
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,488
that could change the distance between atoms,

191
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,408
while increasing density and strength.

192
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,995
Why this revolutionary idea remained buried

193
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,332
beneath the dust and cobwebs of Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

194
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,334
Butjust imagine,

195
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:12,672
a soldier the size of an insect.

196
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,677
The ultimate secret weapon.

197
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,649
An ant-man.

198
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,986
That's what they called you. Right, Hank?

199
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,783
Silly, I know.

200
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,327
Propaganda.

201
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,495
Tales to astonish!

202
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,957
Trumped-up bs to scare the ussr.

203
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,878
Hank, will you tell our guests what you told me

204
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,465
every single time I asked you,

205
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,552
"was the ant-man real?"

206
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,262
Just a tall tale.

207
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,388
Right.

208
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,558
Because how could anything so miraculous possibly be real?

209
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,572
Well, I was inspired by the legend of the ant-man.

210
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,492
And with my breakthrough shrinking inorganic material,

211
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,620
I thought, could it be possible to shrink a person?

212
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,122
Could that be done?

213
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,919
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

214
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,265
Distinguished guests,

215
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:40,426
I am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it.

216
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,303
The yellowjacket!

217
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,435
Oh, no.

218
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,814
The yellowjacket is an all-purpose weapon of war

219
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,900
capable of altering the size of the wearer

220
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,069
for the ultimate combat advantage.

221
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,154
Man: We live in an era

222
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,448
in which the weapons we use to protect ourselves

223
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,618
are undermined by constant surveillance.

224
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,412
It's time to return to a simpler age.

225
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:11,332
One where the powers of freedom can once again operate openly

226
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,709
to protect their interests.

227
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,628
An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel,

228
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,047
the yellowjacket can manage any conflict

229
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,507
on the geopolitical landscape

230
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,676
completely unseen.

231
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,680
Efficient in both preventative measures and tactical assault.

232
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,975
Practical applications include surveillance,

233
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,727
industrial sabotage,

234
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:35,940
And the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace.

235
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,275
A single yellowjacket

236
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:41,070
offers the user unlimited influence to carry out protective actions.

237
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,657
And, one day soon, an army of yellowjackets

238
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:49,954
will create a sustainable environment of well-being around the world.

239
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,914
The yellowjacket.

240
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,334
So, it's a suit?

241
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,505
Don't be crude, frank.

242
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,717
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.

243
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,737
What's the matter? You're not impressed?

244
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,638
No, I'm impressed. I'm also concerned.

245
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,683
Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech.

246
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,353
We should have a longer conversation about that, frank.

247
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,188
I really value your opinion.

248
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,690
Thank you for coming. Hope?

249
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,152
Thank you very much, everybody. I will escort you out now.

250
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,362
Thank you.

251
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,200
You seem a bit shocked.

252
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:31,537
Darren, there's a reason that I buried these secrets.

253
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,623
So you finally admit it!

254
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,919
We could have done this together, Hank. But you ruined that.

255
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,230
That's why you're the past and I'm the future.

256
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,715
Don't do this.

257
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,926
Mitchell: Dr. Cross?

258
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,930
You sell to me first, 20% over your asking price,

259
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,890
I can have the cash here in two weeks.

260
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,183
Darren: Deal.

261
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,069
Hope: We have to make our move, Hank.

262
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,195
How close is he?

263
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,948
He still can't shrink a live subject.

264
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,575
Just give me the suit and let me finish this once and for all.

265
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,787
I have cross' complete trust.

266
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,039
- It's too dangerous. - We don't have a choice.

267
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,667
Well, that's not entirely true.

268
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,504
I think I found a guy.

269
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,340
Who?

270
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,138
Daddy!

271
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,722
Peanut! Oh!

272
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,975
Happy birthday!

273
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,059
I'm so sorry I'm late.

274
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,787
I didn't know what time your party started.

275
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,312
It was on the invitation.

276
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,148
He didn't get an invitation.

277
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,732
But he came anyway!

278
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,777
Well, I'm not gonna miss my little girl's birthday party.

279
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,612
I'm gonna go tell mommy you're here.

280
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:47,697
Oh, you don't...

281
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,841
What are you doing here, lang?

282
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,426
You haven't paid a dime of child support.

283
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,219
You know, right now, if I wanted to, I could arrest you.

284
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,345
It's good to see you too, Paxton.

285
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,706
Mommy's so happy you're here, she choked on her drink.

286
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,960
Hey, look what I have for you.

287
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,420
Can I open it now?

288
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,213
Of course, sweetheart. It's your birthday.

289
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,191
Automated voice: You're my bestest friend.

290
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,429
What is that thing?

291
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,222
He's so ugly!

292
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,766
I love him!

293
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,393
Can I go show my friends?

294
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,395
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

295
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,702
Automated voice: You're my bestest friend.

296
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,858
Look, the child support is coming, all right?

297
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,981
It's just hard finding a job when you have a record.

298
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,827
I'm sure you'll figure it out. But for now, I want you out of my house.

299
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,424
- No way! It's my daughter's birthday. - It's my house!

300
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,008
- So what? It's my kid! - Maggie: Scott!

301
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,369
You can't just show up here. You know that. Come on.

302
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,496
It's a birthday party.

303
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,247
Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.

304
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,332
She's my daughter.

305
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,893
You don't know the first thing about being a father.

306
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:45,004
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend, and as the first love of my life.

307
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,006
Your fiance is an asshat.

308
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,174
He's not an asshat.

309
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,135
- Hey, watch your language. Okay? - What language? I said "hat."

310
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,595
Maggie: Stop it.

311
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,890
Really, Maggie? That guy?

312
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,600
Come on! You could marry anyone you want,

313
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,077
and you have to get engaged to a cop?

314
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,728
At least he's not a crook.

315
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,358
I'm trying, okay? I've changed. I'm straight.

316
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,777
I had a job and...

317
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,363
I wanna provide.

318
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,990
I had a lot of time to think about it and I love her.

319
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,075
So much.

320
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,453
I've missed so much time and I wanna be a part of her life.

321
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,538
What do I do?

322
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,623
Get an apartment,

323
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,584
get a job, pay child support.

324
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,879
And then we will talk about visitation, I promise.

325
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,382
You're her hero, Scott.

326
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:34,554
Just be the person that she already thinks you are.

327
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,163
I'm sorry you have such deep concerns about the yellowjacket, frank.

328
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,749
Yeah. Well, uh...

329
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:08,296
Unfortunately, we can't just do whatever we want.

330
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,590
It'd be nice though, right?

331
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,050
But there are laws.

332
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,177
What laws? Of man?

333
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,722
The laws of nature transcend the laws of man.

334
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,932
And I've transcended the laws of nature.

335
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,314
Darren, I don't think you understand...

336
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,318
Hmm.

337
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,864
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

338
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,412
Goodbye, frank.

339
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,594
Thank you.

340
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,476
You know, I've been thinking a lot about gratitude lately.

341
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,895
And today, during my morning meditation,

342
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,957
an interesting thought occurred to me, and I think it might apply to you, too.

343
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,274
How's that?

344
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,151
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

345
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:17,156
I've spent years carrying around my anger for Hank pym.

346
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,825
I devoted my genius to him.

347
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,744
I could have worked anywhere.

348
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,080
I chose my mentor poorly.

349
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,707
You didn't even have a choice.

350
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,710
He never believed in you.

351
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:35,341
It's a shame what we had to do, but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

352
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,761
But we shouldn't be angry, we should be grateful.

353
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,390
Because his failures as a mentor,

354
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,600
as a father,

355
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,270
forced us to spread our wings.

356
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,025
You're a success, Darren.

357
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,195
You deserve everything coming your way.

358
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,383
Ooh.

359
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,135
Stop cheating.

360
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,470
Luis: Hey, what's up, hotshot?

361
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,724
Dave: Maybe he didn't hear you.

362
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:25,808
How was the party?

363
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,151
- Tell me about that tip. - What?

364
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,194
I wanna know about that tip.

365
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,905
Oh, baby, it's on! It's so on, right now.

366
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,389
Calm down, all right? I just need to know where it came from.

367
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,743
It's gotta be airtight.

368
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,619
Okay.

369
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,955
I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto.

370
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,358
Which was mainly reds, and you know I don't like reds, man.

371
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,736
But there was a Rose that saved the day. It was delightful.

372
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,480
And then he tells me about this girl, Emily, that we used to kick it with.

373
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,715
It was actually the first pair of boobs I ever touched.

374
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,425
It's the wrong details.

375
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,948
It has nothing to do with the story.

376
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,432
Luis: So, uh, he tells me that she's working as a housekeeper now, right?

377
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,810
And she's dating this dude, Carlos, who's a shot caller from across the bay.

378
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,980
And she tells him about the dude that she's cleaning for.

379
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,441
Right? That he's like this big—shot ceo

380
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,568
that is all retired now, but he's loaded.

381
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:21,405
And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team,

382
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,115
and they get to talking, right?

383
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,619
And here comes the good part. Carlos says, "yo, man.

384
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,790
"This guy's got a big-ass safe just sitting in the basement, just chilling."

385
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,393
Of course Ernesto comes to me because he knows I got mad thieving skills.

386
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,418
Of course, I ask him...

387
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,838
"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was?"

388
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,131
And he says, "nah, dawg.

389
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,425
"All she said is that it's super-legit

390
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,677
"and whatever's in it, it's gotta be good."

391
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,722
What?

392
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,226
Old man have safe.

393
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,436
And he's gone for a week.

394
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,480
All right. There's an old man, he's got a safe,

395
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,648
and he's gone for a week.

396
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,816
Let's just work with that.

397
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,359
You know what I'm saying?

398
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,327
Landline's cut, cell signal's jammed.

399
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,705
No one will be making for distress call tonight.

400
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,789
Comm check.

401
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:54,999
Scott: Check. Dave: Check.

402
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,310
Hey, if the job goes bad, you know I got your back, right?

403
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,586
Don't worry.

404
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,880
It's not gonna happen.

405
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,092
I love it when he gets cocky.

406
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,224
Damn!

407
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,045
Alarm is dead.

408
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,171
Nice.

409
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,842
Scott: All right, I'm moving through the house.

410
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,911
There's a fingerprint lock on the door.

411
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,580
It's got what? Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.

412
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,749
Aw, man, are we screwed?

413
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,751
Not necessarily.

414
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,842
I'm in.

415
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,095
No alarms have been triggered. He's in like the Flynn.

416
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,726
Scott: Oh, man.

417
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,144
Luis: What is it?

418
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,522
Well, they weren't kidding. This safe is serious.

419
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,816
Luis: How serious are we talking, Scotty?

420
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,568
It's a carbondale.

421
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,069
It's from 1910.

422
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,905
Made from the same steel as the Titanic.

423
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,240
Wow.

424
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,700
Can you crack it?

425
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,203
Scott: Well, here's the thing. It doesn't do so well in the cold.

426
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:39,580
Remember what that iceberg did?

427
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,373
Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.

428
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:42,458
Killed everybody.

429
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,084
Did not kill the old lady.

430
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,336
She still throw the Jewel into the oceans.

431
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,099
Luis: What are you doing?

432
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,822
I poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen.

433
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,687
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.

434
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,190
- Luis: What are you doing now? - Waiting.

435
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:50,776
Waiting.

436
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,035
Nice.

437
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,916
Luis: What is it? Cash? Jewels?

438
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,044
- There's nothing here. - What did you say?

439
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,548
- It's a suit. - What?

440
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,050
It's an old motorcycle suit.

441
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,970
There's no cash, no jewelry, nothing?

442
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,389
It's a bust.

443
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,934
I'm really sorry, Scotty.

444
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,769
I know you needed to score.

445
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,889
I thought we were using mice.

446
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,891
What's the difference?

447
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:10,147
Commence experiment 34-c. Organic atomic reduction.

448
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,083
Darren, maybe we should think...

449
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,587
Shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology.

450
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,653
I can't go to the buyers with half a breakthrough.

451
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:45,432
Experiment 34-c results,

452
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,558
negafive.

453
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:54,524
Sanitize the work station. Bring in subject 35-c.

454
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,287
Scott: Why would you lock this up?

455
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,270
This is so weird.

456
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,636
Luis: Scotty, what's up, man?

457
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,269
Scott: I wonder... what is this?

458
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:46,178
Han k: The world sure seems different from down here, doesn't it, Scott?

459
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,680
Scott: What? Who said that?

460
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,979
Scott: Luis, down here!

461
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,442
Han k: It's a trial by fire, Scott. Or, in this case,

462
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,526
water.

463
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,303
Han k: Guess you're tougher than you thought.

464
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,474
Scott: Oh, I don't want to see this!

465
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,393
Luis!

466
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,357
Son of a...

467
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,852
What the hell?

468
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,439
Han k: Not bad for a test drive.

469
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,608
Keep the suit. I ll be in touch.

470
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,735
No! No! No, thank you!

471
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,041
Policeman: Get down on the ground!

472
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,501
You are under arrest!

473
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,337
No, I didn't steal anything! I was returning something I stole.

474
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,425
Policeman: Don't move.

475
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,781
Paxton: You know, you almost had us convinced

476
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,891
that you were gonna change your ways.

477
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,644
They were really rooting for you.

478
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,272
It's gonna break their hearts.

479
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,444
- You got a visitor. - Who?

480
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,862
Your lawyer.

481
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:52,989
My lawyer?

482
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,537
Hank: I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

483
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:03,041
I'm starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

484
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,876
Oh, man.

485
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,545
Han k: Sit down.

486
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,218
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

487
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,178
I don't even wanna know why you have it.

488
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,222
Maggie was right about you.

489
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:19,808
How do you know about...

490
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,931
No wonder she's trying to keep you away from Cassie.

491
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,896
The moment things get hard,

492
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,439
you turn right back to crime.

493
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,111
The way I see it, you have a choice.

494
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,822
You can either spend the rest of your life in prison,

495
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,491
or go back to your cell

496
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,578
and await further instructions.

497
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,079
I don't understand.

498
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,290
No, I don't expect you to.

499
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,418
But you don't have many options right now, and quite frankly,

500
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,836
neither do I.

501
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,591
Why do you think I let you steal that suit in the first place?

502
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:53,842
What?

503
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,314
Second chances don't come around all that much.

504
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:10,442
So, next time you think you might see one,

505
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:14,988
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

506
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,210
Automated voice: You're my bestest friend!

507
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,334
Maggie: Are you sure you don't want a different toy?

508
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,298
No, I love this one.

509
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,635
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.

510
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,678
- Mommy? - Hmm?

511
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:41,056
Is daddy a bad man?

512
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,517
I heard some grownups say he's bad.

513
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,523
Daddyjust gets confused sometimes, you know?

514
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,953
Han k: Smart choice. You actually listened, for once.

515
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:46,996
Under the door.

516
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,712
Okay, where to now?

517
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,797
- Han k: Hang tight. - Oh, god.

518
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,634
What, what?

519
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:00,719
Where the hell did he go?

520
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,113
I have no idea. He just vanished.

521
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,097
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!

522
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,390
Scott: Get back! Get back!

523
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,059
Han k: Scott, these are my associates.

524
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,978
Scott: Is that a camera on an ant?

525
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,938
Yeah, sure. Why not?

526
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,022
Where's the car?

527
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,733
Han k: No car. We've got wings.

528
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,109
Incoming!

529
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:29,080
Put your foot on the central node and mount the thorax.

530
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,164
- How safe is... - Just get on the damn ant, Scott!

531
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,766
Scott: Why am I on a police car? Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

532
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:50,327
Han k: So they can give you a lift past their five-block perimeter.

533
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,978
Scott: All right.

534
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,022
- Now, what's the next move? - Hang on tight.

535
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,916
Scott: Oh, this is easy! I'm getting the hang of this.

536
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,567
Yank up to go up. It's like a horse.

537
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,694
Han k: You're throwing 247 off balance.

538
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,196
Wait, his name is 247?

539
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,090
He doesn't have a name, he has a number, Scott.

540
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,617
Do you have any idea how many ants there are?

541
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,452
Scott: Whoa!

542
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,370
Hank: Maybe it's... maybe it's 248.

543
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,955
Scott: No, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

544
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,041
- Han k: No, I think it's 247. - Wait.

545
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,959
Han k: Hang on tight!

546
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,003
Scott: I think I'm getting the hang of this.

547
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,964
Han k: I am controlling 247. He is not listening to you.

548
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,048
Scott: What?

549
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,967
- Can I make one little request? - No.

550
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,387
Scott: Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

551
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,348
Time out.

552
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,516
All right, hold on.

553
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,476
Just wait! Whoa!

554
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,700
What happens if I throw up in this helmet?

555
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:37,148
Han k: It's my helmet, Scott. You do not throw up.

556
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:38,817
Scott: Let's set her down, all right?

557
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,901
I'm getting light-headed.

558
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,069
Hang on, Scott.

559
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,696
I'm getting a little light...

560
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,698
I need a snooze button.

561
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,576
Hit me in 5 minutes.

562
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,429
Hello.

563
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,017
Who are you?

564
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,856
Have you been standing there, watching me sleep, this whole time?

565
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,023
Yes.

566
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,265
Because the last time you were here, you stole something.

567
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,281
Oh. Oh.

568
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,116
Hey, look...

569
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,034
Whoa!

570
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,374
Hope: Paraponera clavata.

571
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,959
Giant tropical bullet ants,

572
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,642
ranked highest on the schmidt pain index.

573
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,549
They're here to keep an eye on you when I can't.

574
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,425
Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.

575
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,010
Who?

576
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,141
Um... whose pajamas are these?

577
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,482
How am I supposed to do this?

578
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:10,783
All right, just one step at a time.

579
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:20,084
You don't bite me, I don't step on you. Deal?

580
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,233
Hope: I could take down the servers and cross wouldn't even know it.

581
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,467
We don't need this guy.

582
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,011
I assume that you've already met my daughter, hope.

583
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,680
I did. She's great.

584
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,974
She doesn't think that we need you.

585
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,458
We don't. We can do this ourselves.

586
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,729
I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit,

587
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,398
and then hope has you arrested.

588
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,485
Okay, we can try this and when he fails, I'll do it myself.

589
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,195
She's a little bit anxious.

590
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,197
It has to do with this job,

591
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,783
which, judging by the fact that you're sitting opposite me,

592
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,118
I take it that you're interested in.

593
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,286
What job?

594
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,537
Would you like some tea?

595
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,790
Uh... sure.

596
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,458
I was very impressed with

597
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,336
how you managed to get past my security system.

598
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,590
Freezing that metal was particularly clever.

599
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,092
Were you watching me?

600
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,387
Scott, I've been watching you for a while.

601
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,847
Ever since you robbed vista corp.

602
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,101
Oh! Excuse me.

603
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,144
"Burgled" vista corp.

604
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:25,733
Vista's security system was one of the most advanced in the business.

605
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,527
It was supposed to be unbeatable.

606
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,529
But you beat it.

607
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,947
Would you like some sugar?

608
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,573
Yeah, thanks.

609
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,745
You know what? I'm okay.

610
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,877
How do you make them do that?

611
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,588
Ants can lift objects 50 times their weight.

612
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:51,300
They build, farm, they cooperate with each other.

613
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,553
Right. But how do you make them do that?

614
00:41:55,513 --> 00:42:01,102
I use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

615
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,188
I speak to them.

616
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,649
I can go anywhere, hear anything,

617
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,151
and see everything.

618
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,111
And still know absolutely nothing.

619
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,738
I'm late to meet cross.

620
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,326
Uh... Dr. Pym?

621
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,746
You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.

622
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,957
Sorry, I just have one question.

623
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,126
Who are you, who is she, what the hell's going on,

624
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,878
and can I go back to jail now?

625
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,337
Come with me.

626
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:33,092
40 years ago, I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance.

627
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,385
Scott: Huh?

628
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,721
I learned how to change the distance between atoms.

629
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,514
That's what powers the suit.

630
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,266
That's why it works.

631
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:42,477
Scott: Wow.

632
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,484
- Whoa! - But it was dangerous.

633
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,236
It was too dangerous.

634
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,406
So I hid it from the world.

635
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,243
And that's when I switched gears and I started my own company.

636
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,245
Pym tech.

637
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,455
Yes.

638
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:07,210
I took on a young protege called Darren cross.

639
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,544
Scott: Darren cross.

640
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:09,670
He's a big deal.

641
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,215
But before he was a big deal, he was my assistant.

642
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:16,636
I thought I saw something in him. The son I never had, perhaps.

643
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,013
He was brilliant, but as we became close,

644
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,683
he began to suspect that I wasn't telling him everything.

645
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:26,437
He heard rumors about what was called the pym particle,

646
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:29,690
and he became obsessed with recreating my formula.

647
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,275
But I wouldn't help him.

648
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,196
So he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company.

649
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,781
How could he do that?

650
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,659
The board's chairman is my daughter, hope.

651
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,077
She was the deciding vote.

652
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,664
But she came back to me

653
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:48,126
when she saw how close cross was to cracking my formula.

654
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,420
The process is highly volatile.

655
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:54,340
If one isn't protected by a specialized helmet,

656
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:57,301
it can affect the brain's chemistry.

657
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,346
I don't think Darren realizes this,

658
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,266
and, you know, he's not the most stable guy to begin with.

659
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:06,102
So, what do you want from me?

660
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,858
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption.

661
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:12,942
Do you?

662
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,485
I do.

663
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:16,612
If you can help me,

664
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:20,408
I promise I can help you be with your daughter again.

665
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,828
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

666
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:25,496
Absolutely.

667
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:29,333
My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done.

668
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:31,794
What do you want me to do?

669
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:35,256
I want you to break into a place and steal some shit.

670
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,734
Are you gonna be home for dinner tonight?

671
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,973
Uh, yeah. I'll pick something up. Text me.

672
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,349
Okay. Good news?

673
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,852
Uh... I don't know. It's news.

674
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,479
Are you trying to find my daddy?

675
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,108
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

676
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,819
I just want your daddy to be safe.

677
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,030
Hope you don't catch him.

678
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:46,827
This isn't the first time these guys

679
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,705
have tried to get their hands on game-changing weaponry.

680
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:53,834
That's Mitchell Carson, ex-head of defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

681
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,254
Presently in the business of toppling governments.

682
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,714
He always wanted my tech.

683
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:02,093
And now, unless we break in and steal the yellowjacket

684
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,303
and destroy all the data,

685
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:10,351
Darren cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.

686
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,816
I think our first move should be calling the avengers.

687
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,902
I spent half my life

688
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:23,155
trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a stark.

689
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,993
I'm sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now.

690
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:30,454
This is not some cute technology like the iron man suit.

691
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,082
This could change the texture of reality.

692
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:39,046
Besides, they're probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky.

693
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,632
Okay, then why don't you just send the ants?

694
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,427
Scott, they are ants.

695
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:48,431
Ants, they can do a lot of things, but they still need a leader.

696
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:54,353
Somebody that could infiltrate a place that's designed to prevent infiltration.

697
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:58,024
Hank, I'm a thief, all right? I mean, I'm a good thief, but this is insane.

698
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,192
He's right, Hank. And you know it.

699
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,862
You've seen the footage, you know what cross is capable of.

700
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,048
I was against using him when we had months,

701
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,033
and now we have days.

702
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:08,117
I'm wearing the suit.

703
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,577
Absolutely not!

704
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,580
I know the facility inside and out. I know how cross thinks.

705
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,266
I know this mission better than anybody here.

706
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:17,001
We need you close to cross. Othennise, this mission cannot work.

707
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,563
- We don't have time to screw around! - Hope, please listen to me...

708
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,130
He is a criminal! I'm your daughter.

709
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,548
No!

710
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,713
She's right, Hank.

711
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,465
I'm not your guy.

712
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,385
Why don't you wear the suit?

713
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,678
You think I don't want to?

714
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:10,971
I can't.

715
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,475
I spent years wearing it,

716
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,311
and it took atoll on me.

717
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,028
You're our only option.

718
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:34,328
Before hope lost her mother,

719
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:38,332
she used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world.

720
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:43,504
And now she looks at me and there's just disappointment.

721
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,843
It's too late for me,

722
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,804
but not for you.

723
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,806
This is your chance.

724
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,518
The chance to earn that look in your daughter's eyes.

725
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:01,480
To become the hero that she already thinks you are.

726
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,692
It's not about saving our world.

727
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:08,404
It's about saving theirs.

728
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,200
Damn. That was a good speech.

729
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,869
Scott,

730
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:19,707
I need you to be the ant-man.

731
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,128
In the right hands,

732
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,506
the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic.

733
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,343
The suit has power. The man harnesses that power.

734
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:34,263
You need to be skillful, agile, and above all,

735
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,556
you need to be fast.

736
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,558
You should be able to shrink and grow

737
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,809
on a dime.

738
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:42,730
So your size always suits your needs.

739
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,649
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

740
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:49,695
You charge big, you dive small, then you emerge big.

741
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,115
Scott: Ow!

742
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,409
Ahhh!

743
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:57,411
Ow!

744
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,746
Useless.

745
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,559
When you're small, energy's compressed,

746
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,502
so you have the force of a 200-pound man

747
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:07,880
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide. You're like a bullet.

748
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:11,300
You punch too hard, you kill someone. Too soft, it's a love tap.

749
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,903
In other words, you have to know how to punch.

750
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,779
I was in prison for three years. I know how to punch.

751
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,514
Show me.

752
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,357
- Terrible. - You wanna show me how to punch?

753
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:19,934
Show me...

754
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,145
That's how you punch.

755
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,981
- She's been looking toward to this. - No kidding.

756
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,692
Hope trained in martial arts at a difficult time.

757
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,896
Oh, by "difficult time," he means when my mother died.

758
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,988
We lost her in a plane crash.

759
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:34,841
It's bad enough you won't tell me how she died.

760
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,468
Could you please stop telling me that lie?

761
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:38,285
We're working, here.

762
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,175
All right, Princess. Let's get back to work.

763
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,168
Were you going for the hand?

764
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,635
You know, I think this regulator is holding me back.

765
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,388
Do not screw with the regulator.

766
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,223
If that regulator is compromised,

767
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,849
you would go subatomic.

768
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,309
What does that mean?

769
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,563
It means that you would enter a quantum realm.

770
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,064
What does that mean?

771
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:11,652
It means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space

772
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,778
become irrelevant

773
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,698
as you shrink for all eternity.

774
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,034
Everything that you know

775
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,411
andlove,

776
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,913
gone forever.

777
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:27,126
Cool. Yeah, if it ain't broke...

778
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,544
You've learned about the suit,

779
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,338
but you've yet to learn about your greatest allies,

780
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:33,716
the ants.

781
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,593
Loyal, brave,

782
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,469
and your partners on this job.

783
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,437
Hope: Paratrechina iongicornis. Commonly known as crazy ants.

784
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,689
They're lightning fast and can conduct electricity,

785
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,233
which makes them useful to fly out enemy electronics.

786
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:52,985
You're not so crazy.

787
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,404
Hey!

788
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,780
You're cute.

789
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,374
That was a lot scarier a second ago.

790
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:20,429
It looks like the futures lab has its own isolated power supply.

791
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,490
Hope: There's a security guard posted around the clock.

792
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,114
We'll need you to take him out to deactivate the security systems.

793
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,728
Scott: Okay, who's next?

794
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,106
Hope: Paraponera clavata.

795
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,816
Scott: I know. Bullet ants, right?

796
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,485
Number 1 on the schmidt pain index?

797
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,403
Hey, guys. Remember me from the bedroom?

798
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,158
Hope: The yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed,

799
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,552
and the only access point is a tube

800
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,329
we estimate to be about 5 millimeters in diameter.

801
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,247
Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach?

802
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,541
Hope: The tube is protected by a laser grid,

803
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,436
and we can only power that down for 15 seconds.

804
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,046
You're gonna need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers,

805
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:58,217
retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults before the backup power comes on.

806
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,469
Hope: Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

807
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,738
Alternatively known as a carpenter ant.

808
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,599
Ideal for ground and air transport.

809
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,351
Wait a minute, I know this guy.

810
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,938
I'm gonna call him "ant-thony."

811
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,272
That's good. That's very good.

812
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:16,985
Because this time, you're really gonna have to learn how to control him.

813
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:19,780
Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.

814
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,034
Aw! You okay? Did I hurt...

815
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,923
Hank wants you outside for target practice.

816
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,287
Han k: The suit has no weapons, so I made you these discs.

817
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,719
Red shrinks.

818
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,304
Blue enlarges.

819
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,809
Hope: Solenopsis mandibularis.

820
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,227
Han k: Known for their bite,

821
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,021
the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects.

822
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:56,191
They are handy to get you in and out of difficult places.

823
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,494
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

824
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:12,207
They're not listening to me.

825
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:14,960
You have to commit. You have to mean it.

826
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,004
No shortcuts, no lies.

827
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:21,759
Throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good, hope.

828
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:23,343
We don't have time for coddling.

829
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,596
Our focus should be on helping Scott!

830
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,055
Really?

831
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,808
Is that where our focus should be?

832
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,292
Hope!

833
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,845
I don't know why I came to you in the first place.

834
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,940
We can't do this without her.

835
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,195
Oh, god.

836
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,239
You gotta lock your doors.

837
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,200
I mean, really, there's some weird folks in this neighborhood.

838
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,952
Do you think this is a joke?

839
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,497
Do you have any idea what he's asking you to risk?

840
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,832
You have a daughter.

841
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,208
I'm doing this for her.

842
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,253
You know, when my mother died, I didn't see him for two weeks.

843
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,045
He was in grief.

844
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,464
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

845
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:45,133
And he never came back. Not in any way that counted.

846
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,928
He just sent me off to boarding school.

847
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:50,264
You know, I thought,

848
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,474
with all that's at stake,

849
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:55,686
just maybe we might have a chance of making peace.

850
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,688
But, even now, he still wants to shut me out.

851
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,649
He doesn't wanna shut you out. He trusts you.

852
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,109
Then why are you here?

853
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,194
It proves that he loves you.

854
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,865
Hope. Look at me.

855
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,784
I'm expendable.

856
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,870
That's why I'm here.

857
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,873
You must have realized that by now.

858
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,959
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit and you're not.

859
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,171
He would rather lose this fight than lose you.

860
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,133
Anyway...

861
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,637
You know, I didn't know you had a daughter

862
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,931
when I called the cops on you.

863
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,145
What's her name?

864
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,480
Cassie.

865
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,983
It's a pretty name.

866
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:49,299
You have to clear your mind, Scott. You have to make your thoughts precise.

867
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:51,283
That's how it works.

868
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,827
Think about Cassie.

869
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:57,831
About how badly you want to see her. And use that to focus.

870
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,342
Open your eyes

871
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,802
and just think about what you want the ants to do.

872
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:34,868
That's good!

873
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:55,639
Your mother convinced me

874
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:58,767
to let herjoin me on my missions.

875
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,478
They called her the wasp.

876
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,772
She was born to it.

877
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,401
And there's not a day that goes by

878
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:11,279
that I don't regret having said yes.

879
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,411
It was 1987.

880
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:22,708
Separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in kursk

881
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:27,212
and launched an icbm at the United States.

882
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,806
The only way to the internal mechanics

883
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,808
was through solid titanium.

884
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:53,822
I knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile.

885
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:57,159
But my regulator had sustained too much damage.

886
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,287
Your mother,

887
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,747
she didn't hesitate.

888
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,500
Janet! No!

889
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,760
She turned off her regulator

890
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,220
and went subatomic

891
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,807
to deactivate the bomb.

892
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,436
And she was gone.

893
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:30,984
Your mom died a hero.

894
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,989
And I spent the next 10 years

895
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:40,410
trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm.

896
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,124
You were trying to bring her back.

897
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:51,338
But all I learned was we know nothing.

898
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,178
It's not your fault.

899
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:02,015
She made her choice.

900
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:11,191
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

901
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,236
I was trying to protect you.

902
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:17,697
I lost your mother.

903
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:22,577
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

904
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,788
I'm sorry.

905
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,417
This is awesome.

906
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,170
It's awesome, you know?

907
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:34,339
You guys are breaking down walls, you're healing.

908
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,883
It's important.

909
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,263
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

910
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,056
Yes, you did. Yes.

911
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:46,143
I'm going to make some tea.

912
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:52,858
Nailed it!

913
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:04,161
That's a good boy, ant-thony.

914
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,902
Han k: The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.

915
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,153
Scott: It's freezing!

916
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,572
You couldn't make a suit with a flannel lining?

917
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:44,159
You must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy.

918
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,953
It's a device that I invented during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

919
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,764
Hope: We need it to counteract the transmission blockers

920
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,665
that cross installed in the futures vault.

921
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,668
It's currently collecting dust

922
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,880
in one of Howard stark's old storage facilities in upstate New York.

923
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,924
Should be a piece of cake.

924
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:00,884
You're over the target area.

925
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,261
Disengage now, Scott!

926
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:04,512
Squadron a, go!

927
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:12,896
All right, ant-thony, please don't drop me this time.

928
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:17,067
Oh, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this!

929
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,193
Stay calm.

930
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:21,905
Scott: Guys? We might have a problem.

931
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:25,408
Hank, didn't you say this was some old warehouse?

932
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:26,534
It's not!

933
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,829
You son of a bitch!

934
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,042
- Scott, get out of there. - Abort!

935
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,168
Abort now!

936
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:38,004
No, it's okay. It doesn't look like anyone's home.

937
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,131
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

938
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,092
He's gonna lose the suit.

939
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,677
He's gonna lose his life.

940
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,643
All right, I'm on the roof of the target building.

941
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,354
Somebody's home, Scott.

942
01:02:57,524 --> 01:02:58,876
Man: What's going on down there, Sam?

943
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,026
Scott: It's the falcon!

944
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,821
I had a sensor trip but I'm not seeing anything.

945
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:04,406
Wait a second.

946
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,449
Han k: Abort, Scott! Abort now!

947
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,076
It's okay. He can't see me.

948
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,202
I can see you.

949
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,412
He can see me.

950
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,708
Hi. I'm Scott.

951
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,418
Did hejust say, "hi, I'm Scott"?

952
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,796
- What are you doing here? - First off, I'm a big fan.

953
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,506
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

954
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,508
I'm ant-man.

955
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:24,843
"Ant-man"?

956
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,012
What? You haven't heard of me?

957
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,847
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

958
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:30,724
You wanna tell me what you want?

959
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,226
I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology.

960
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,020
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.

961
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,731
I need it to save the world. You know how that is.

962
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,232
I know exactly how that is.

963
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,192
Located the breach.

964
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:42,756
- Bringing him in. - Sorry about this!

965
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,742
What the hell are you doing?

966
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:54,423
Falcon: Breach is an adult male, who has some sort of shrinking tech.

967
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:08,803
Scott: Sorry!

968
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:10,388
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.

969
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,140
That's enough!

970
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:36,873
Ant-thony! A little help!

971
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:50,637
I've lost visual.

972
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,147
He's inside my pack!

973
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,273
Sorry!

974
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,178
You seem like a really great guy.

975
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:34,013
It's really important to me that cap never finds out about this.

976
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:40,812
That was completely irresponsible and dangerous!

977
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,731
You jeopardized everything!

978
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,291
You got it.

979
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,295
Well done.

980
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:06,378
Scott: Wait a minute.

981
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:07,839
Did you just compliment me?

982
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,383
- He did, didn't he? - Kind of sounded like he did.

983
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:13,720
I was good, wasn't I?

984
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:18,892
Hey, how about the fact that I fought an avenger and didn't die?

985
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,478
Let us not dwell on the past.

986
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,646
We gotta finish our planning.

987
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,692
Hope: Don't mind him.

988
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,235
You did good.

989
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,368
Darren.

990
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,040
How the hell did you get in here?

991
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,502
You left the front door open, Hank.

992
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:46,919
It's official.

993
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,087
You're old.

994
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,839
The plans.

995
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:52,842
He will kill him.

996
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:58,765
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

997
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,267
I have good news.

998
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,602
Really?

999
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,437
What's that?

1000
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:09,651
Pym tech, the company you created,

1001
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:13,530
is about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world.

1002
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:17,367
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales, tomorrow alone.

1003
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,124
You're welcome.

1004
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,965
I know this is odd, but I'd like you to be there.

1005
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,634
This is my moment. I want you to see it.

1006
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,428
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1007
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:38,805
I'll be there.

1008
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:57,323
What did you see in me?

1009
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,909
I don't know what you mean.

1010
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:03,413
All those years ago, you picked me.

1011
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,998
What did you see?

1012
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,960
I saw myself.

1013
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:11,963
Then why did you push me away?

1014
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:16,843
Because I saw too much of myself.

1015
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,105
Hope: He knows. He's baiting you.

1016
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,898
We have to call it off.

1017
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:32,150
We're all taking risks.

1018
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,526
What if he saw me here?

1019
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:34,944
He didn't. There's no way.

1020
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,405
How do you know that?

1021
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:46,164
Darren, hi.

1022
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:49,083
Hope, where are you right now?

1023
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:50,918
I'm at home. Why?

1024
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:52,754
I just saw Hank.

1025
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,631
I still get nothing but contempt from him.

1026
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:58,259
Don't let him rile you up. He's just a senile old man.

1027
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:00,803
We need to start everyone working around the clock.

1028
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,722
Get the assembly line up and running.

1029
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,057
And I'm tripling security.

1030
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,142
Full sensors at all entrances

1031
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:09,646
and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1032
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:11,356
Great. Good idea.

1033
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:15,735
Thank you, hope. I'm so lucky to have you on my team.

1034
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:22,659
He's tripling security. He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

1035
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,702
But he is not onto you.

1036
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:27,163
He's adding full body scanners to all entrances

1037
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:28,998
and closing exterior vents.

1038
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:31,000
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

1039
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,045
The water main.

1040
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,048
You can't add security to a water main.

1041
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,467
The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it,

1042
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,760
that's how I get in.

1043
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,072
Somebody would have to reach the building's control center

1044
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:44,472
to change the water pressure.

1045
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:47,266
Hank and I will be beside cross. How are we supposed to do that?

1046
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,851
So we expand our team.

1047
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:50,478
What do we need?

1048
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:53,940
A fake security guard on the inside to de-pressurize the water system,

1049
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,858
somebody else to hack in to the power supply

1050
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:57,360
and kill the laser grid,

1051
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,737
and a getaway guy.

1052
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:03,783
No, no. No, no, no. Not those three wombats. No way.

1053
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:05,928
Luis: Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

1054
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:09,539
It's not too often that you Rob a place and then get welcomed back.

1055
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,499
Because we just robbed you.

1056
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:16,629
You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1057
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,005
Two smoothie machines.

1058
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,674
Are you sure they can handle this?

1059
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:21,193
Oh, we can handle it. We're professionals.

1060
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:24,846
You'll forgive us if we're not instilled with confidence.

1061
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,598
Well, hey, everybodyjust kick back and relax a little bit, man.

1062
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:28,975
We know our business.

1063
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,436
We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn't we?

1064
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:32,937
Iletyou.

1065
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,315
Well, one could say that I let you let me.

1066
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:39,694
- Look, it's okay. They can handle this. - Yeah, we can handle it.

1067
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,588
- Scott: You got their credentials? - He's in the system.

1068
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:44,115
- I'm in the system? - You're in the system.

1069
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:45,366
The system?

1070
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,744
Yeah, we're doomed.

1071
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:48,870
Scott: All right.

1072
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:50,621
There's something you guys need to see.

1073
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:52,540
When you get to this corner,

1074
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:55,376
there's gonna be three offices on your left side.

1075
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,794
Dave: Damn!

1076
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:01,174
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1077
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,926
Now, look, this is gonna get weird, all right?

1078
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:07,263
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe. There's no reason to be scared.

1079
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:08,741
Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.

1080
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:10,600
- Really? - Yeah.

1081
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:11,809
Good.

1082
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,902
This is the work of gypsies.

1083
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:22,171
Dave: That's witchcraft.

1084
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:23,362
Wow, that's amazing.

1085
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,507
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

1086
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:26,675
Dave: That's some kind of wizardry.

1087
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:27,784
Kurt: This is sorcery!

1088
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:28,993
How'd you do that, bro?

1089
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:31,037
Scott: Don't freak out. Look at your shoulder.

1090
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:32,830
Ahhh!

1091
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,332
Get off! Get off!

1092
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:36,959
Scott: Wait, I thought daddy didn't get scared!

1093
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:40,630
I gave them each half a Xanax

1094
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:43,299
and Hank explained the science of the suit to them.

1095
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,551
They tell right asleep.

1096
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,805
Hey, look, iwanna thank you for...

1097
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,807
No, please don't.

1098
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,410
We're all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us.

1099
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:57,271
I'm just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

1100
01:11:57,355 --> 01:12:00,441
Hey, thank you, you know, for that pep talk.

1101
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:03,194
You know, the honest truth is, I actually went from despising you

1102
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:04,862
to almost liking you.

1103
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:06,656
You really should write poetry.

1104
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:11,744
Get some sleep, Scott.

1105
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:05,047
All right, just so we're clear, everyone here knows their role, right?

1106
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,757
- Dave? - Wheels on the ground.

1107
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,134
- Kud? - Eyes in the sky.

1108
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,677
- Luis? - Oh, man, you know it.

1109
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,280
You know what? I get to wear a uniform.

1110
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:12,889
- That's what's up. - Luis.

1111
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:15,182
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good. I'm just excited.

1112
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:16,660
Plus, your girlfriend's really hot.

1113
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:18,036
So, you know, that makes me nervous, too.

1114
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,121
And you are very beautiful, ma'am.

1115
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:21,022
- Oh, my lord. - She's not my...

1116
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:23,458
You know what? I was thinking of a tactic, like when I go undercover.

1117
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,460
Like a whistling. You know what I'm saying? To like, blend in.

1118
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,529
No. Don't whistle. No whistling.

1119
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:30,656
It's not the Andy Griffith show. No whistling.

1120
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,717
All clear in sector one.

1121
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,015
Guard: Step out.

1122
01:13:58,643 --> 01:13:59,810
All clear.

1123
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:06,609
We're set.

1124
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:08,527
Wish me luck.

1125
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:21,666
Utilities online.

1126
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:35,888
Hey! What are you doing?

1127
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:41,060
Uh... boss-man said to secure the area, so I'm securing it.

1128
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,771
I'm the boss.

1129
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,564
- Oh. - Utilities 1.3...

1130
01:14:59,704 --> 01:15:01,789
Kurt: Water level is dropping!

1131
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:32,153
Kurt: Coming up on extraction pipe.

1132
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:33,612
Scott: All right, I see it.

1133
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:45,124
All right, come on, I gotta get up there. That's it. That's it, guys! Yes!

1134
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:51,338
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!

1135
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:58,137
All right, let's fly, ant-thony.

1136
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,608
The ant-man is in the building.

1137
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:13,611
Dave: Pym's pulling up. Right on time.

1138
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,698
Got a crown Vic right outside there.

1139
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:18,991
This is problem?

1140
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:21,178
Dave: Considering the crown Vic's the most commonly used car

1141
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:22,328
for undercover cops, man,

1142
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,497
yes, this is problem.

1143
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,502
That's pym.

1144
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:33,589
Dave: Oh, no.

1145
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:34,983
Scott: I'm deploying the bullet ants.

1146
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:36,550
Papanera Claire de merna merna...

1147
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:39,553
I don't remember what it's called, but I feel bad for this guy.

1148
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:41,972
- What's up, man? - Hey.

1149
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:49,271
Ow! Ow!

1150
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,210
See? That's what I'm talking about.

1151
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:55,611
That's what I call an unfortunate casualty

1152
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:57,696
in a very serious operation.

1153
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:09,083
Kurt: Signal decoy in place.

1154
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,544
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.

1155
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:15,047
Dave: Looks like pym's getting arrested.

1156
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:16,841
Scott, we have problem.

1157
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:18,843
Scott: Problem? What's the problem?

1158
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:22,138
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!

1159
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:23,848
Listen to me.

1160
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:27,726
If I don't get into this building, people will die.

1161
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,104
That's awfully dramatic.

1162
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:34,275
Are you kidding me?

1163
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,489
Problem solved.

1164
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:56,630
Well...

1165
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,259
How do I look?

1166
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,561
There he is.

1167
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:15,357
Just in time. Come on.

1168
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:26,535
Automated female voice: 12—point verification.

1169
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:28,412
Little over-the-top, don't you think, Darren?

1170
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:30,098
Automated female voice: Confirming authorization level.

1171
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:31,707
Well, you can never be too safe.

1172
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,310
Automated female voice: Access granted.

1173
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:41,967
Hank: Gotta hand it to you, Darren.

1174
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:44,637
You really did it.

1175
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,555
And you only know the half of it, Hank.

1176
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,375
Arriving in second position.

1177
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:18,337
All right, top speed, ant-thony. Let's go!

1178
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:30,641
Proceeding to command position.

1179
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:50,035
I'll be right back, ant-thony.

1180
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,039
All right, guys. I'm in position.

1181
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:55,791
I'm gonna signal the ants.

1182
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:58,127
Paxton: No, no, no, no, no!

1183
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,587
Dave: Did you see that?

1184
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:08,637
Assume formation.

1185
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,639
All right, you cute little crazies,

1186
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:12,433
let's fry these servers!

1187
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:26,739
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

1188
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:40,252
Kurt: Servers are fried.

1189
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:42,546
Data backup completely erased.

1190
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:44,214
Scott: Heading to the particle chamber.

1191
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,598
Hello, Dr. Cross.

1192
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,937
My associates have agreed to your terms.

1193
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:00,189
Wonderful.

1194
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:03,108
Mr. Carson introduced me to these fine gentlemen here.

1195
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:04,777
They're representatives of hydra.

1196
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,195
They're not what they were.

1197
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,530
They're doing some interesting work.

1198
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:11,075
And I'm enjoying myself.

1199
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:13,994
You tried to hide your technology from me.

1200
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:16,038
And now it's gonna blow up in your face.

1201
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,001
Wow.

1202
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:25,381
Wow! I mean, I saw that punch coming a mile away,

1203
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:27,549
but I just figured it'd be all pathetic and weak.

1204
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:29,134
Well, you figured wrong.

1205
01:21:30,344 --> 01:21:31,678
Paxton: I know this Van.

1206
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:34,264
Anybody home?

1207
01:21:39,937 --> 01:21:41,105
All right, guys. I'm here.

1208
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:47,486
I'm setting the charges.

1209
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:09,383
Greatjob, guys. I'll take it from here.

1210
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:21,103
Good boy, ant-thony.

1211
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:23,063
Final position.

1212
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:33,991
Guys, how we looking on that laser grid?

1213
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:35,617
Kurt: Almost. Dave: No, you're not.

1214
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,181
- I'm getting close! - No, you're not.

1215
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,518
Paxton: San Francisco p.D.!

1216
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:44,543
Out of the Van!

1217
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:46,169
I know you're in there!

1218
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,380
- Make it go faster. - Dude, seriously.

1219
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:56,180
Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?

1220
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:57,264
So close.

1221
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,534
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute! - Freeze!

1222
01:22:59,558 --> 01:23:01,244
There was a black guy that looked exactly like me

1223
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:03,246
who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting Van.

1224
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:04,789
- Get out of the Van! - Dave: Okay, I'm coming.

1225
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,607
Take it easy!

1226
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,650
Kurt: No, I will not move! Go now!

1227
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,863
- Wait! - What? What do you mean, "wait"?

1228
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:20,787
Phew!

1229
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:24,416
What? What?

1230
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:27,336
Darren: Hey, little guy.

1231
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:43,185
I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere.

1232
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:44,268
Which begs the question,

1233
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:46,480
who is the new ant-man?

1234
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,982
Who is the man that my beloved mentor

1235
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:50,943
trusted even more than me?

1236
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:55,447
Scott lang.

1237
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:58,283
A martyr

1238
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:00,827
who took on the system and paid the price,

1239
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:04,498
losing his family and his only daughter in the process.

1240
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:07,834
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

1241
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:13,632
He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how.

1242
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:17,803
And then he disappears magically,

1243
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:21,098
despite having no money to his name.

1244
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:23,850
And now he brings me the ant-man suit.

1245
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:29,982
The only thing that can rival my creation.

1246
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:33,485
Darren, don't do this.

1247
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:35,612
If you sell to these men,

1248
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:37,155
it's gonna be chaos.

1249
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:38,615
I already have.

1250
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,158
And for twice the price,

1251
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:42,244
thanks to you.

1252
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:45,706
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate an avengers facility.

1253
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:47,749
Thankfully, word travels fast.

1254
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:51,670
I'll sell them the yellowjacket, but I'm keeping the particle to myself.

1255
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:54,089
They don't run on diesel.

1256
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:57,050
If you want the fuel, you'll have to come to me.

1257
01:24:58,218 --> 01:25:00,012
What do you call the only man

1258
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:03,056
who can arm the most powerful weapon in the world?

1259
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:06,351
The most powerful man in the world.

1260
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:07,936
You proud of me yet?

1261
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:11,064
You can stop this, Darren. It's not too late.

1262
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:14,860
It's been too late for a long time now.

1263
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:17,863
Darren!

1264
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:20,115
What are you doing?

1265
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:23,368
He wasn't any more capable of caring for you than he was for me.

1266
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:25,203
This is not who you are.

1267
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:28,123
It's the particles altering your brain chemistry.

1268
01:25:36,465 --> 01:25:38,508
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1269
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:42,888
You're right. I have to be the one to do it.

1270
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:46,767
Here we go.

1271
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:51,396
Drop your gun.

1272
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,943
You know, I came to the house the other night to kill him,

1273
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:58,111
but you were there.

1274
01:25:58,195 --> 01:26:01,698
You're sick and I can help you. Just put the gun down.

1275
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:03,062
I wasn't ready to kill you then,

1276
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,036
but I think I am now!

1277
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:08,205
Drop your gun now!

1278
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:11,667
You picked the wrong side, hope.

1279
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:25,889
Dad!

1280
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:35,857
Scott: Hank, no.

1281
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:37,567
No, Hank.

1282
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:40,153
Hank? Listen, you're gonna be okay.

1283
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:42,317
All right? You're gonna be just fine.

1284
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:46,201
Take the suit off, or I'll blow your brains out and peel it off.

1285
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:13,895
We got a 10-33 at pym tech.

1286
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:15,480
Request immediate backup!

1287
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:16,815
Dave: Go, go, go!

1288
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,621
Get me to the roof.

1289
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:32,956
And radio ahead.

1290
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:35,876
I want to make sure the helicopter is ready to take off.

1291
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,002
You two,

1292
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:39,755
kill anything that comes out of that vault!

1293
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:43,008
Dad, can you move?

1294
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:46,803
We need to get him out of here.

1295
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,724
Go get that suit.

1296
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:35,101
Hey, Scotty.

1297
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:36,895
Hey, did I save your life?

1298
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:39,147
Scotty?

1299
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:40,649
Scotty?

1300
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:44,653
Thank you, Luis.

1301
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:46,321
- Are we the good guys? - Yeah.

1302
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:48,685
- We're the good guys, right? - Yeah, we're the good guys.

1303
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:50,951
Feels kinda weird, you know.

1304
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:53,119
Yeah, but we're not done yet.

1305
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:55,247
Get out of here before this place blows!

1306
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:05,215
Damn it! That guy.

1307
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:08,510
Hey! We're getting out of here!

1308
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:14,057
Hope: The charges are set.

1309
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,142
We've gotta find a way out of here. And fast.

1310
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:18,144
Don't worry.

1311
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:20,772
I'm not gonna die.

1312
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:22,315
And neither are you.

1313
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,902
It's not a keychain.

1314
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:31,950
It's total chaos in here! Multiple shots fired!

1315
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:44,504
And there's a tank.

1316
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:55,640
A little help!

1317
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:58,268
I got it.

1318
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,520
We need a doctor!

1319
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:03,064
We've got him.

1320
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:06,818
Thank you.

1321
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:09,738
Let's go!

1322
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:27,172
Ant-thony!

1323
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:44,343
Scott: You're gonna regret that.

1324
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,242
Wait a minute! Get out of that Van!

1325
01:30:56,326 --> 01:30:57,911
- What? - Get out of that Van!

1326
01:30:57,994 --> 01:30:59,874
It's too loud, there's a tank. I can't hear you!

1327
01:31:00,956 --> 01:31:03,416
Hey! Hey!

1328
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:10,507
Man: Are you crazy? Put the gun down!

1329
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:12,092
The windows!

1330
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:19,432
Did you think you could stop the future with a heist?

1331
01:31:19,516 --> 01:31:21,059
Scott: It was neverjust a heist!

1332
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:44,749
Put the gun down!

1333
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,468
Okay, I got him, I got him. There he is! Go, go, go!

1334
01:32:11,735 --> 01:32:13,778
We gotta set her down somewhere.

1335
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:46,144
Darren: I'm gonna disintegrate you!

1336
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:47,827
Siri: Playing disintegration by the cure.

1337
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:27,519
Call 911!

1338
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:47,580
Scott: It's okay.

1339
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:54,003
Freeze! Put your hands up! Get them up!

1340
01:33:56,548 --> 01:33:57,549
Scott?

1341
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,952
Paxton, you have to listen to me!

1342
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:29,497
Paxton, turn around! Take me back!

1343
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:31,583
I am taking you back. To prison.

1344
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:34,127
There's something in that backyard that needs to be destroyed.

1345
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:35,295
In the bug zapper. There...

1346
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:40,466
You need to desist right now! Your delusions are out of hand.

1347
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:44,846
Dispatch: All units, we have a 2—36 in progress at 840 winter street.

1348
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:46,264
- Cassie! - That's my house.

1349
01:35:03,865 --> 01:35:05,158
Don't be scared.

1350
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:07,410
Scott: Paxton, let me help!

1351
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:09,495
- Don't move. - Let me help!

1352
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:11,664
- Maggie! What's going on? - He's got Cassie!

1353
01:35:11,748 --> 01:35:13,308
- Who's got Cassie, honey? - That thing.

1354
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:15,494
- Paxton: Thing? - Maggie: I don't know! I don't know!

1355
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:25,303
Are you a monster?

1356
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:28,848
Do I look like a monster?

1357
01:35:29,891 --> 01:35:31,351
I want my daddy!

1358
01:35:33,019 --> 01:35:34,437
I want your daddy, too.

1359
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:39,234
There you are.

1360
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:40,652
Daddy, is that you?

1361
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,321
Hi, peanut.

1362
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:46,449
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?

1363
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:02,507
Darren: Now, where did you go, little guy?

1364
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:08,680
There you are.

1365
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:13,935
Scott: Not just me!

1366
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:25,947
Damn it!

1367
01:36:26,656 --> 01:36:28,241
Go! Go!

1368
01:37:21,961 --> 01:37:23,689
Luis: Scotty needs us, you know what I'm saying?

1369
01:37:23,713 --> 01:37:25,548
Ain't nothing gonna stop us.

1370
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:29,385
Back it up.

1371
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:31,471
- Back it up, slow. - Yeah.

1372
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:32,972
- Back it up. - Yeah.

1373
01:37:33,056 --> 01:37:34,515
- Back it up. - Okay.

1374
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:37,411
- We just back it up, okay? - Dave: That's it.

1375
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:38,795
- Luis: Back it up. - That's right.

1376
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:41,647
- Luis: Backin' up? - Yep, just backin' up.

1377
01:37:41,731 --> 01:37:42,940
Luis: No, no. Just back it up.

1378
01:37:49,655 --> 01:37:51,699
You insult me, Scott.

1379
01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:59,791
Your very existence is insulting to me.

1380
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:05,004
You know, it'd be much easier to hit you if you were bigger.

1381
01:38:07,215 --> 01:38:08,508
Scott: Yeah, I agree.

1382
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:31,155
Paxton: Cassie!

1383
01:38:38,287 --> 01:38:41,916
I'm gonna show you just how insignificant you are.

1384
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:45,503
Cassie! I'm coming!

1385
01:38:58,307 --> 01:38:59,934
That's a messed-up looking dog.

1386
01:39:00,017 --> 01:39:01,144
I'm gonna destroy

1387
01:39:01,227 --> 01:39:02,770
everything you love.

1388
01:39:04,397 --> 01:39:05,940
Freeze! S.F.P.D.

1389
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:15,116
I can't break through.

1390
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:18,119
Darren: It's titanium, you idiot!

1391
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:26,210
- Scott: Get her out of here. - Come on.

1392
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:28,754
Darren: Sorry, sweetheart.

1393
01:39:28,838 --> 01:39:31,257
You have to help daddy pay for his mistakes.

1394
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:32,700
- You stay behind me, okay? - Okay.

1395
01:39:32,758 --> 01:39:33,759
Stay behind me.

1396
01:39:35,136 --> 01:39:38,139
I'm gonna have to shrink between the molecules to get in there.

1397
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:40,266
Get away from us!

1398
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:43,144
Daddy, help!

1399
01:39:43,227 --> 01:39:44,812
I love you, Cassie.

1400
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:16,010
Daddy, where are you?

1401
01:40:17,678 --> 01:40:19,597
Han k: You could go subatomic.

1402
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,890
You could go subatomic.

1403
01:40:21,933 --> 01:40:23,184
Oh, no.

1404
01:40:35,112 --> 01:40:37,698
Han k: You would enter a reality

1405
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:41,536
where all concepts of time and space...

1406
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:46,290
All concepts of time and space become irrelevant.

1407
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:52,213
All concepts of time and space become irrelevant.

1408
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:58,386
Cassie: Come back, daddy!

1409
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:05,726
Hank: As you shrink for all eternity.

1410
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:09,981
Everything that you know

1411
01:41:11,941 --> 01:41:13,651
and love,

1412
01:41:14,694 --> 01:41:16,612
gone forever.

1413
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:18,614
Cassie: Daddy, where are you?

1414
01:41:36,841 --> 01:41:37,925
Where are you?

1415
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:42,179
Where are you?

1416
01:41:43,389 --> 01:41:45,182
- Daddy! - Cassie.

1417
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:54,442
Come back, daddy!

1418
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:01,198
Han k: Do not screw with the regulator!

1419
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:33,606
Daddy!

1420
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:38,402
I love you so much.

1421
01:42:39,111 --> 01:42:40,279
I love you, too.

1422
01:42:40,946 --> 01:42:42,031
So much.

1423
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:48,050
You know, there's a big hole in the roof.

1424
01:42:51,248 --> 01:42:52,416
Sorry.

1425
01:42:55,211 --> 01:42:57,171
- Gale: Is she all right? - Yeah, she's fine.

1426
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:00,257
Mommy!

1427
01:43:03,135 --> 01:43:04,762
Paxton: She's fine, she's fine.

1428
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:15,648
Han k: Scott, please.

1429
01:43:16,357 --> 01:43:18,234
You don't remember anything?

1430
01:43:18,317 --> 01:43:19,485
Hank. I don't.

1431
01:43:19,568 --> 01:43:21,946
There must be something else.

1432
01:43:23,656 --> 01:43:26,784
Well, I suppose the human mind

1433
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:29,537
just can't comprehend the experience,

1434
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:32,957
but you made it.

1435
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:35,251
You went in,

1436
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:38,337
and you got out.

1437
01:43:40,548 --> 01:43:42,133
It's amazing.

1438
01:43:42,842 --> 01:43:44,593
Scott,

1439
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:46,595
I'll walk you out.

1440
01:43:50,558 --> 01:43:52,059
Get some rest.

1441
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:02,695
Is it possible?

1442
01:44:20,588 --> 01:44:21,630
When did this happen?

1443
01:44:21,714 --> 01:44:22,840
Nothing's happening.

1444
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:25,134
Whoa. Hold on. Something's kind of happening.

1445
01:44:25,217 --> 01:44:27,261
Well, if that's the case,

1446
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:28,846
shoot me again.

1447
01:44:29,221 --> 01:44:31,867
Yeah. I don't know what you were doing, grabbing and kissing me like that.

1448
01:44:31,891 --> 01:44:33,809
I'm a little surprised myself.

1449
01:44:33,893 --> 01:44:36,270
I have to get somewhere. I'll see you later, Hank.

1450
01:44:36,353 --> 01:44:37,813
Really, hope.

1451
01:44:38,647 --> 01:44:40,024
- Scott. - Yeah?

1452
01:44:40,608 --> 01:44:42,359
- You're full of shit. - Oh, yeah.

1453
01:44:43,778 --> 01:44:45,696
Paxton: Scott, I met with my captain today.

1454
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:48,449
He wanted a report on the night that you got out of jail.

1455
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:50,556
Something happened with the cameras.

1456
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:53,454
Some circuits got fried.

1457
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,832
But I told him that you were processed correctly.

1458
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:58,042
Really?

1459
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,543
Paxton: Well, yeah.

1460
01:45:01,337 --> 01:45:04,256
Can't be sending Cassie's dad back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1461
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:06,300
Thank you, Paxton.

1462
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:07,843
I'm blown away.

1463
01:45:08,636 --> 01:45:10,429
Thank you for everything you do for Cassie.

1464
01:45:10,513 --> 01:45:12,556
Well, that's my pleasure.

1465
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:16,894
But, no. This one, I did for you.

1466
01:45:18,938 --> 01:45:20,356
- This is awkward. - Yeah.

1467
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:22,233
Yeah.

1468
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:23,835
I mean, what do we even talk about after all of that?

1469
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:25,236
- Oh, I know. - What?

1470
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:27,863
- I did my first cartwheel today. - What?

1471
01:45:27,947 --> 01:45:30,533
Yeah. She has been practicing all week.

1472
01:45:30,616 --> 01:45:32,034
But today was the magic day.

1473
01:45:32,117 --> 01:45:33,397
I recorded it on my phone. Here.

1474
01:45:34,829 --> 01:45:37,164
Scott: No, that can't be Cassie. That's not you.

1475
01:45:37,248 --> 01:45:38,848
Maggie: Yeah, it is. Cassie: Yeah, it is.

1476
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:41,102
Scott: This is a professional gymnast. There is no way that's you.

1477
01:45:41,126 --> 01:45:42,253
Paxton: Yeah, that's her.

1478
01:45:43,212 --> 01:45:44,797
Good boy.

1479
01:45:46,715 --> 01:45:49,426
Sweetie, that's pretty amazing, peanut.

1480
01:45:52,388 --> 01:45:53,389
Sorry.

1481
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:56,767
It's work.

1482
01:45:57,434 --> 01:45:58,686
Yeah.

1483
01:46:00,437 --> 01:46:01,437
All right.

1484
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,232
Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.

1485
01:46:03,315 --> 01:46:04,608
Just the facts. Only the facts.

1486
01:46:04,692 --> 01:46:08,571
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.

1487
01:46:08,654 --> 01:46:10,322
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1488
01:46:10,406 --> 01:46:12,783
So, I'm at this art museum with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1489
01:46:12,867 --> 01:46:15,107
And there was this, like, abstract expressionism exhibit.

1490
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:17,430
But you know me, I'm more like a Neo-cubist kind of guy, right?

1491
01:46:17,454 --> 01:46:20,165
But there was this one rothko that was sublime, bro! Oh, my god!

1492
01:46:20,249 --> 01:46:22,376
- Luis. - Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1493
01:46:22,459 --> 01:46:24,461
You know, I just get excited and stuff.

1494
01:46:24,545 --> 01:46:26,505
But anyway, Ignacio tells me,

1495
01:46:26,589 --> 01:46:30,217
"yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick at the spot last night. Like fine-fine.

1496
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:32,737
"Like crazy-stupid fine." And he goes up to the bartender and goes,

1497
01:46:32,761 --> 01:46:34,489
"look at the girl I'm with. You know what I'm sayin'?

1498
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:35,824
"She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"

1499
01:46:35,848 --> 01:46:38,517
The bartender's all like, "yeah, crazy-stupid fine."

1500
01:46:38,601 --> 01:46:40,519
So this writer chick tells Ignacio,

1501
01:46:40,603 --> 01:46:43,397
"yo, I'm like a boss in the world of guerrilla journalism,

1502
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:45,250
"and I got mad connects with the peeps behind the curtains,

1503
01:46:45,274 --> 01:46:46,293
"you know what I'm saying?"

1504
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:47,818
Ignacio's like, "for real?"

1505
01:46:47,902 --> 01:46:50,863
And she's like, "yeah, you know what, I can't tell you who my contact is,

1506
01:46:50,946 --> 01:46:52,382
"because he works with the avengers."

1507
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:53,699
Oh, no.

1508
01:46:53,782 --> 01:46:56,201
Yeah, and this dude sounds like a badass, man.

1509
01:46:56,285 --> 01:46:57,470
Like, he comes up to her and says,

1510
01:46:57,494 --> 01:46:59,598
"yo, I'm looking for this dude who's new on the scene,

1511
01:46:59,622 --> 01:47:00,807
"who's flashing his fresh tack,

1512
01:47:00,831 --> 01:47:03,375
"who's got, like, bomb moves, right? Who you got?"

1513
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:06,587
And she's like, "well, we got everything nowadays. We got a guy who jumps.

1514
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:08,815
"We got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls.

1515
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:10,549
"You gotta be more specific."

1516
01:47:10,633 --> 01:47:12,527
And he's like, "I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."

1517
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:15,971
And I'm, like, "damn!" I got all nervous 'cause I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.

1518
01:47:16,055 --> 01:47:17,097
So I asked Ignacio,

1519
01:47:17,181 --> 01:47:19,224
"did the badass tell the stupid-fine writer chick

1520
01:47:19,308 --> 01:47:21,560
"to tell you to tell me, because I'm tight with ant-man,

1521
01:47:21,644 --> 01:47:22,853
"that he's looking for him?"

1522
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,065
And? What'd he say?

1523
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,778
He said, "yes."

1524
01:49:25,851 --> 01:49:28,145
There's something I want to show you.

1525
01:49:30,355 --> 01:49:33,609
I realized you can't destroy power.

1526
01:49:35,319 --> 01:49:39,239
All you can do is make sure that it's in the right hands.

1527
01:49:45,954 --> 01:49:48,082
This is an advanced prototype

1528
01:49:48,165 --> 01:49:51,043
that your mother and I worked on together.

1529
01:49:52,419 --> 01:49:55,130
She never got to use it.

1530
01:49:55,798 --> 01:50:00,177
But now I realize that we were... We were working on it for you.

1531
01:50:06,809 --> 01:50:09,353
Maybe it's time we finished it.

1532
01:50:15,984 --> 01:50:18,403
It's about damn time.

1533
01:56:18,722 --> 01:56:20,098
Falcon: Hey, cap!

1534
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:36,823
This would have been a lot easier a week ago.

1535
01:56:36,907 --> 01:56:38,825
- If we call Tony... - He won't believe us.

1536
01:56:38,909 --> 01:56:39,910
Even if he did...

1537
01:56:39,993 --> 01:56:41,703
Who knows if the accords will let him help.

1538
01:56:43,246 --> 01:56:44,789
We're on our own.

1539
01:56:46,166 --> 01:56:47,501
Maybe not.

1540
01:56:49,794 --> 01:56:51,213
I know a guy.
