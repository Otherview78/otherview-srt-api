1
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,373
<i>This man is worth $500,</i>

2
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,875
<i>and this man's going to collect.</i>

3
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,418
<i>He's Jake Cahill,</i>

4
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,212
<i>and he lives by...</i>

5
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,213
Bounty Law.

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,966
You don't ever bring them in alive, do you, Jake?

7
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,718
Not when there's three of them and one of me.

8
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,767
What are you looking at, bounty killer?

9
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,354
I'm looking at an ugly owl-hoot about to get his jaw busted.

10
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,982
Amateurs try and take men in alive.

11
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,404
- Amateurs usually don't make it.
- <i>Whether you're dead or alive,</i>

12
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:14,908
<i>you're just a dollar sign to Jake Cahill on</i> Bounty Law.

13
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,036
<i>Thursdays at 8:</i><i>30, only on NBC.</i>

14
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:22,958
Hello, everybody.

15
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:29,089
This is Allen Kincade on the set of the exciting hit NBC
and Screen Gems television series <i>Bounty Law.</i>

16
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,217
Now, if you think you're seeing double,
don't adjust your television sets

17
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,594
because, well, in a way, you are.

18
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:38,974
To my right is <i>Bounty Law</i> series lead
and Jake Cahill himself, Rick Dalton.

19
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,810
And to my left is Rick's stunt double, Cliff Booth.

20
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,730
Welcome, gentlemen,
and thanks for taking the time to visit with us.

21
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,148
Well, it's our pleasure, Allen.

22
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:50,527
So, Rick, explain to the audience
exactly what it is a stunt double does.

23
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,946
Well...

24
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,116
actors are required to do a lot of dangerous stuff.

25
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,202
Say Jake Cahill gets shot <i>off</i> his horse.

26
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,538
Now, can I fall <i>off</i> a horse?

27
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,166
Yes, I can, and, yes, I have.

28
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:11,882
But say I fall <i>off</i> wrong and I sprain my wrist
or I twist my ankle.

29
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:17,512
Now, that can put an undue burden on production
because now maybe I can't work for a week.

30
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,349
So Cliff here is meant to help carry the load.

31
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,851
Is that how you'd describe your job, Cliff?

32
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:26,104
What, carrying his load? Yeah, that's about right.

33
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,819
Join me next week on the set of <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show,</i>

34
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,448
where I'll be talking to those comical cutups,
Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie.

35
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:40,077
Till then, this is Allen Kincade signing off from Hollywood.

36
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,780
I missed you.

37
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,329
- The black one. And the flowers.
- Flowers, Ava, flowers.

38
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,249
- And there's the small one.
- Can I see your tickets?

39
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,293
Oh, good boy.

40
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,855
Gina, Gina, Gina.

41
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,649
The face in the misty light.

42
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,735
- Hello, Mr Schwarz.
- Hello, Gina.

43
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,864
I... I have a meeting with a very handsome cowboy man.

44
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,324
He's waiting for you in the bar.

45
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,245
Well...

46
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,415
since I just finished watching
a Rick Dalton fucking film festival,

47
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,210
I think I know who you are. Put it there.

48
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,796
Well, it's my pleasure, Mr Schwartz.

49
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,967
- And thank you for taking an interest.
- Schwarz, not Schwartz.

50
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,344
Goddamn it to hell. I'm sorry about that.

51
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,556
- It's my pleasure, Mr Schwarz.
- Call me Marvin.

52
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,266
Marvin, call me Rick.

53
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,183
- Rick?
- Yeah.

54
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,811
- Oh, is that your son?
- My son?

55
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,813
No, that's my stunt double, Cliff Booth.

56
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,314
- Yeah.
- Good to meet you.

57
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,484
We've worked together
since the last two seasons of <i>Bounty Law.</i>

58
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,153
- Yeah?
- My car's in the shop, so he gave me a ride.

59
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,738
<i>That's a big fucking lie.</i>

60
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,409
<i>Rick got his driver's licence taken away
for too many drunk-driving tickets.</i>

61
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,744
- <i>Cliff drives him everywhere now.</i>
- Oh, fuck.

62
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,789
- Well, sounds like a good friend.
- I try.

63
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:18,712
I wanna send you greetings from my wife,
Mary Alice Schwarz.

64
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,422
Oh, well, that's nice.

65
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,050
Thanks a lot.

66
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:31,641
We had a Rick Dalton double feature
in our screening room last night.

67
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:36,646
Oh, well, that's both flattering and embarrassing.

68
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,647
What'd you see?

69
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:43,069
Thirty-five mm prints of <i>Tanner</i>
and <i>The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.</i>

70
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,537
I hope the Rick Dalton double feature

71
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,790
wasn't too painful for you and the-- And the missus.

72
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:59,919
Oh, no. "Painful." Stop. What are you saying?

73
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:05,133
<i>Mary Alice loves Westerns.
Our whole courtship, we watched Westerns.</i>

74
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,843
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

75
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,137
<i>And we thoroughly enjoyed</i> Tanner.

76
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,807
- Oh, that's nice.
- It's really good. And anyway, she goes to bed.

77
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,977
<i>I open up a box of Ha van as.</i>

78
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:21,483
<i>I light up, I pour myself a cognac and I watch...</i>

79
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,528
<i>The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.</i>

80
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,780
What a picture.

81
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,657
- What a picture.
- Good picture, yeah.

82
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,575
That is so much fun.

83
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,743
All the shooting.

84
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,501
- I love that stuff. You know, the killing.
- A lot of killing. Lot of killing, yeah.

85
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,338
Now, gentlemen, the plan is, we reverse our forces

86
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,049
<i>und</i> drive the Allies back into the sea!

87
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,055
- Genius.
- Panzer divisions come in,

88
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,933
and we drive them here to the ocean.

89
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,434
They'll be up against the wall.

90
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,520
- They will have nowhere to go.
- Yes.

91
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,063
This is the spot...

92
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,691
Hermann!

93
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,403
Open the curtains.

94
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,217
Anybody order fried sauerkraut?!

95
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,737
Burn, you Nazi bastards!

96
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,533
That's you operating the flamethrower, isn't it?

97
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,577
Oh, you bet your sweet ass it was. Yeah, yeah.

98
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,495
- It was you?
- Yeah. And let me tell you,

99
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:02,083
that's one shit-fuck crazy weapon
you do not wanna be on the wrong side of.

100
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,293
Boy, oh, boy.

101
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,337
You know, I practised with that dragon

102
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,339
three hours a day for two weeks.

103
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,885
Not just because I wanted to look good
in the picture, but because I was--

104
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,095
I was shit-scared of the damn thing, to be honest.

105
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,639
Mike fucking Lewis!

106
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,308
Crisping them Nazis to hell!

107
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,976
Oh, shit, that's...

108
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,730
All right, that's too hot. Anything we can do about that heat?

109
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,483
- Rick, it's a flamethrower.
- Yeah.

110
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,903
So I came to the office early today,

111
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:35,492
and I watched two episodes of <i>Bounty Law</i> on 16 mm.

112
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,452
Jody Janice,

113
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:42,707
wanted for cattle rustling in the state of Wyoming,
$425 dead or alive.

114
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,753
And you brought him here to collect.

115
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,506
I don't even know where here is.

116
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,716
It was just the closest place.

117
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,636
Caught up with him about five miles outside of town.

118
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,179
So, bounty killer,

119
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,557
the name of this town is Janicetown.

120
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,270
And that boy you killed...

121
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,105
was Jody Janice.

122
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,820
He was the baby boy of Major Nathin Maxwell Janice.

123
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,742
Who's Major Nathin Maxwell Janice?

124
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:23,289
Well, I'll be sure and introduce you

125
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,624
when he gets here.

126
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,603
Bounty Law.

127
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,359
<i>Starring Rick Dalton.</i>

128
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:58,825
<i>Then a couple of the jokers over in archival sent over
a kinescope of a little treat featuring you.</i>

129
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,160
<i>There's an old piano</i>

130
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,873
<i>And they play it hot
Behind the green door</i>

131
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,917
<i>Don't know what they're doing</i>

132
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,629
<i>But they laugh a lot
Behind the green door</i>

133
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,591
<i>Wish they'd let me in</i>

134
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,469
<i>So I can find out
What's behind the green door</i>

135
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,100
So you've been doing guest shots

136
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,895
on episodic TV shows the last couple of years?

137
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:32,817
Yeah. Yeah. I'm doing a pilot for CBS right now.

138
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,403
It's called-- It's called <i>Lancer.</i> I play the heavy.

139
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,031
Did a Ron Ely <i>Tarzan.</i>

140
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,075
I did a <i>Land of the Giants. Green Hornet.</i>

141
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,077
I did that show...

142
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,497
<i>Bingo Martin</i> with that kid Scott Brown. Yeah.

143
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,876
And I got a <i>F.B.I.</i> that airs this Sunday.

144
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,422
You... You always play the bad guy on these shows?

145
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,424
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

146
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,344
So, and they have a fight scene at the end of them?

147
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:03,514
Well, not-- Not-- Not <i>Land of the Giants</i> or <i>F.B.I.,</i>

148
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,559
- but the rest, yeah. Yeah.
- And you lose in the fight?

149
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,355
Yeah. Yeah, of course. I'm-- I'm the heavy.

150
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:14,651
Oh, that's an old trick pulled by the networks.

151
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,279
Now, you take <i>Bingo Martin,</i> for example. Right?

152
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,823
So you got a new guy like Scott Brown.

153
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,452
You wanna build up his bona fides, right?

154
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:28,456
So you hire a guy from a cancelled show to play the heavy.

155
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,709
Then at the end of the show, when they fight,

156
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,670
it's hero besting heavy.

157
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,297
But what the audience sees

158
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:41,386
is Bingo Martin whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

159
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,512
You see?

160
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,391
Then next week, it's Ron Ely.

161
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,852
And next week, it's Bob Conrad,

162
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,897
wearing his tight pants, kicking your ass.

163
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:53,815
Yeah.

164
00:12:55,358 --> 00:13:01,155
In another couple of years, playing punching bag
to every swinging dick new to the network,

165
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:06,828
that's gonna have a psychological effect
on how the audience perceives you.

166
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,413
Right.

167
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,373
So, Rick,

168
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,292
who's gonna kick the shit out of you next week?

169
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,379
Mannix? The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?

170
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,423
The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.?

171
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,009
How about Batman and Robin?

172
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,807
Down goes you.

173
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,893
Down goes your career as a leading man.

174
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:38,276
Or do you go to Rome and star in Westerns

175
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,612
and win fucking fights?

176
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,746
Ticket, señor?

177
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,965
- All right, what's the matter, partner?
- Well...

178
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,552
it's official, old buddy.

179
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,638
- I'm a has-been.
- What are you talking about?

180
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,059
- What did that guy tell you?
- He told me the goddamn truth, is what he told me.

181
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:16,564
- Oh, shit.
- Hey.

182
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,484
- I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry about that.
- Here. Put these on.

183
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,695
- Don't cry in front of the Mexicans.
- Son of a bitch.

184
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,947
Now, what's got you so upset, man?

185
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:29,202
If coming face-to-face with the failure
that is your career ain't worth crying about,

186
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:33,331
- then I don't know what the fuck is.
- Right. That guy in there turn you down?

187
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,251
No. He wants to help me get into Italian movies.

188
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,088
- Then what's the problem?
- I gotta do Italian goddamn movies!

189
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,923
- That's the fucking problem!
- Come on.

190
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,218
Fucking bullshit! It doesn't matter whether I cry in public.

191
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,637
Nobody remembers who the fuck I am anyway, huh?

192
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,890

Ten years of treading water.

221
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,436
And now a race to the bottom.

222
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,523
Look, I never had much of a career to speak of,

223
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,860
so I can't say I really know how you feel.

224
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,279
What are you talking about? You're my stunt double.

225
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,906
Come on, now. Shit.

226
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,409
Rick, I'm your driver, man. I'm your gofer.

227
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,078
I'm not complaining, man. I like driving you around.

228
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,830
I like doing shit around the house

229
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,708
and house-sitting in the Hollywood Hills when you're gone.

230
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,880
But I haven't been a full-time stuntman for a while now,

231
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:50,009
and from where I'm standing,
going to Rome to star in movies does not sound

232
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,637
like the fate worse than death that you seem to think it is.

233
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,183
Come on, now. You ever seen an Italian Western, huh?

234
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,393
They're awful. It's a fucking farce.

235
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,021
Yeah, how many you seen? One? Two?

236
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,273
I've seen enough, all right? Nobody likes Spaghetti Westerns.

<b>Subtitle

238
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,668
Oh, hell, man, stay in L.A. Give it what fer next pilot season.

239
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,920
Nah, nah. I'm-- I'm--

240
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,173
I'm too insecure now to score come pilot season.

241
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,135
Besides, Screen Gems ain't gonna
have nothing good to say about me.

242
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,512
- You know that.
- Shit. You made <i>Bounty Law.</i>

243
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,057
Nobody's gonna forgive me
for that last season. No matter what I do,

244
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:23,728
I'm always gonna be the horse's ass
that got <i>Bounty Law</i> cancelled

245
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,398
because I wanted some fucking rinky-dink movie career.

246
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,360
Tom. My friend.

247
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,279
- I met him?
- No, you haven't met him.

248
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,490
- You won't meet him because I don't think you'd like him.
- Why?

249
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,075
Well...

250
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,831
- Don't even joke.
- A joke? But they're scared.

251
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:57,970
Holy shit.

252
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,557
That was Polanski.

253
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,184
That was Roman Polanski.

254
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:07,021
He's lived there for a month now. First time I seen him.

255
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,149
Holy shit. Goddamn it.

256
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,197
What do I always say?
Most important thing in this town is,

257
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,657
when you're making money, you buy a house in town.

258
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,410
You don't rent. Eddie O'Brien taught me that.

259
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,621
Hollywood real estate means you live here.

260
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:27,124
You're not just visiting, not just passing through.

261
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,293
You fucking live here.

262
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:33,172
Here I am flat on my ass,
and who I got living next door to me?

263
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,384
The director of <i>Rosemary's</i> fucking <i>Baby,</i> that's who.

264
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,678
Polanski, the hottest director in town right now,
probably the world.

265
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,098
He's my next-door fucking neighbour.

266
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,142
I mean, shit. I mean, who knows what could happen?

267
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:49,855
I could-- I could be one pool party away
from starring in a new Polanski movie.

268
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,234
- So you're feeling better now?
- Yeah, yeah. Sorry about all that.

269
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:57,113
- Give me my glasses back.
- Oh, come get them, fucker. Come--

270
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,448
All right, all right, Audie Murphy, relax.

271
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,951
- There you go.
- You gonna need me for anything else?

272
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,954
Nah, nah, nah. I got a lot of lines to learn for tomorrow.

273
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,247
- Shit. All right.
- All right.

274
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,332
- I'm gonna get my carcass on home.
- All right.

275
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,626
- All right, 7:15 a.m.
- Seven-fifteen.

276
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,503
- Out the door.
- Out the door.

277
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,797
- In the car.
- All right, see you then.

278
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,597
Hello, coming in. Hello.

279
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,724
Hello, darling. Hello.

280
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,686
Come here.

281
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,313
Hello, sweetheart.

282
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:19,857
How was your day?

283
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,152
Wait till you see what I got for you.

284
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,654
Wait until you see what I got for you.

285
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,699
Look what I got for you.

286
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,701
Gonna blow your mind, man.

287
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,831
Come here. Come here.

288
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,648
Was that a whine?

289
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,653
What did I tell you about whining? You whine, you don't eat.

290
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,823
I will throw this shit in the trash. I don't wanna, but I will.

291
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,117
You understand?

292
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,120
All right.

293
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:35,617
<i>I waited at the bar till closing time, but he never came back.</i>

294
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,954
<i>Okay, Peggy, what happened?</i>

295
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,665
<i>I don't know. Everything was fine.</i>

296
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,292
<i>We had dinner at my house.</i>

297
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,211
<i>And afterwards, you know, while I was doing the dishes,</i>

298
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,547
<i>he and Tobey played.</i>

299
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,467
<i>And then, at the club, Gabe was doing great.</i>

300
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,719
<i>Then, wham, a sudden change.</i>

301
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,097
<i>You know how musicians are. They're temperamental cats.</i>

302
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,266
- <i>Who knows what got into him?</i>
- Yeah.

303
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,651
<i>Rick Dalton rehearsal tape starting in five, four,</i>

Pepe, get your behind behind that bar! I got a guest.

306
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,368
<i>Johnny says...</i>

00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,370
<i>Spanish, Spanish, Spanish.</i>

308
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,124
- <i>How's the beans?</i>
- I've had worse.

309
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:28,295
<i>Johnny says... Spanish.</i>

310
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,922
<i>A toast.</i>

311
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,424
To my wife and all my sweethearts.

312
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,301
May they never meet.

313
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:39,515
Señor Madrid, care to join me at my table
where I entertain my guests?

314
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,977
<i>I would be delighted, Monsieur Dakota.</i>

315
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,730
Take the bottle with you.

316
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,526
<i>And Pepe comes over.</i>

317
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,904
Hey, where's that chilli pepper daughter of yours
with the fiddle?

318
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,365
<i>She's asleep.</i>

319
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:01,829
Well, wake her the heck up, get her down here
with her fiddle and her bow, and entertain my guests.

320
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:05,582
<i>Sí, señor, but please don't hurt her this time, I beg you.</i>

321
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:09,169
I ain't gonna hurt her. Just want her to play the fiddle.

322
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:14,091
Fetch her and tell her I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece,
she play her little chilli pepper heart out.

323
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,595
So, Johnny, what else you heard about me?

324
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:23,100
<i>I heard you're pushing Lancer pretty hard,
but Lancer has money.</i>

325
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:27,104
<i>At some point, he's gonna hire some guns and push back.</i>

326
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,233
- Oops, sorry.
- It's okay.

327
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,527
I'll open the door for you.

328
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,736
You look good.

329
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,002
- I think Steve's gonna be there too.
- Oh, yeah.

330
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,078
Oh, look. They're here.

331
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,304
Welcome to Playboy Mansion, Mr Polanski.

332
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,432
Hey, how are you doing, baby?

333
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,018
Hey! How are you?

334
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,033
Oh, Cass!

335
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,255
Yeah!

336
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,013
Yeah, baby!

337
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:09,558
Yeah!

338
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,029
Oh, yeah.

339
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,480
I'm gonna tell you a story.

340
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:00,692
She was engaged to him.

341
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,909
Then she flew to the UK...

342
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,245
to make a film with him,

343
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:17,292
and broke off her engagement with him and married him.

344
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:23,048
Then they moved to Los Angeles,

345
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,843
and the three of them have been inseparable.

346
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,970
Really?

347
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,265
What's up?

348
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,770
Jay loves Sharon, that's what's up.

349
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,065
And he knows...

350
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,069
as sure as God made little green apples...

351
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,990
that one of these days,
that Polish prick's gonna fuck things up,

352
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:52,786
and when he does, Jay's gonna be there.

353
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,163
Well, one thing's for sure.

354
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,957
Yeah?

355
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,291
What's that?

356
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,294
Sharon absolutely has a type.

357
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:07,300
Cute, short, talented guys who look like 12-year-old boys.

358
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,386
Yeah.

359
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,600
I never stood a chance.

360
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,017
Fuck you, Dr Sapirstein.

361
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,562
Oh, here we are.

362
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,526
Tell transpo! Gonna need to move all that out!

363
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,113
Just a sec. Hold on, guys.

364
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,031
Go ahead.

365
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,495
- Maybe you can talk to him.
- Just talk to him.

366
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,913
- Get that set in place.
- Hey.

367
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,417
I think the wind blew down my TV antenna last night,

368
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:08,922
so while I piss-fart around with wardrobe,
you mind going home and fixing it?

369
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,092
I can. Can you talk to the stunt gaffer about me today?

370
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:15,178
- That way I'll know if I'm working this week or not.
- Yeah.

371
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,680
I've been meaning to tell you.

372
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,934
The guy who gaffs this, he's best friends with Randy,

373
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,437
the gaffer from <i>The Green Hornet,</i>
so there really ain't no point.

374
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,482
Well, if you don't need me, I'll pick you up at wrap.

375
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,818
I don't need you. Not today.

376
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,113
Go home, fix my antenna, do whatever. See you at wrap.

377
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,242
Hey!

378
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,830
You're Rick fucking Dalton. Don't you forget it.

379
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,091
Hey, hey.

380
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,344
Hey, buddy, I'm Rick Dalton.
You know where I'm supposed to go?

381
00:34:56,428 --> 00:35:00,307
- They're waiting for you in the makeup trailer.
- Where's the makeup trailer?

382
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,517
Straight back the way you came, hard right.

383
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,857
Oh, my God.

384
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,698
Rick Dalton.

385
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,074
Sam Wanamaker.

386
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,952
Hey, Sam. Sorry about the wet hand.

387
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,621
Oh, don't worry about it. I'm used to it with Yul.

388
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:28,293
I just want you to know, I'm the one who cast you,
and I could not be more delighted you're doing this.

389
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,172
Oh, well, thank you, Sam. I-- I appreciate it. It's a good part.

390
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,175
Yeah, it is. Have you met Jim Stacy, the series lead?

391
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,512
- Not yet, no. No.
- Well, you guys are going to be dynamite together.

392
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,016
Well, it sounds exciting.

393
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,185
Yeah, lightning in a bottle.

394
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,313
- Now, you met Sonya, makeup and hair?
- Hi.

395
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:52,359
- And this is Rebekka, who does costumes.
- Hello.

396
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:53,276
- Hi.
- Howdy.

397
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,362
I want a whole new look for Caleb.

398
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:58,573
I don't want this Western costumed
the way they costumed <i>The Big Valley</i>

399
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,950
and <i>Bonanza</i> for the last decade.

400
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:03,661
I want a zeitgeist flair to the costumes.

401
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:11,086
I mean, nothing anachronistic,
but where does 1869 and 1969 meet?

402
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,714
Especially when it comes to you, Caleb.

403
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,092
First off, I want to give him a moustache.

404
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:21,930
A big, droopy, Zapata-like moustache.

405
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,057
Now, about his jacket.

406
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,059
I want to give him a hippie jacket.

407
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,311
Something he could wear into the London Fog tonight

408
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,272
- and look like the hippest guy in the room.
- Far out.

409
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,526
We got a Custer jacket. Fringes all down the arm.

410
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:39,531
It's tan now, but I dye it dark brown,
he could hit the Strip in it tonight.

411
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,658
That's my girl.

412
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,661
- Now, Rick, about your hair.
- What about my hair?

413
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,247
I want to go with a different hairstyle.

414
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,500
- What?
- Something more hippie-ish.

415
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,878
You-- You-- You-- You want me to look like a hippie?

416
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:57,006
Well, think less hippie, more...

417
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,508
Hells Angel!

418
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,720
- Right. Say, Sam--
- Get me the--

419
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:03,847
Sam. Sam...

420
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,642
if you got me covered up in all this...

421
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,980
This junk, how's the audience gonna know it's me?

422
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,149
I hope they don't.

423
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,988
I don't want them to see Jake Cahill.

424
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,865
I want them to see Caleb.

425
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,869
I hired you to be an actor, Rick.

426
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:29,164
Not a TV cowboy. You're better than that.

427
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:44,525
<i>I've been meaning to tell you, the guy who gaffs this,</i>

428
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,695
<i>he's best friends with Randy,
the gaffer from</i> The Green Hornet,

429
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,906
<i>so there really ain't no point.</i>

430
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,756
Hey, Randy.

431
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:09,926
Cliff.

432
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,514
- So you're still with Rick, huh?
- Still here.

433
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,309
- He in there?
- Yeah. Just knock.

434
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:26,234
Look, just put him in the wardrobe, all right?

435
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,195
What's it gonna hurt?
Then if you need him, you got him, all right?

436
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,782
But then I gotta have a conversation
with that wardrobe assistant,

437
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,368
and, man, she's a fucking bitch. I just don't-- Please, I--

438
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,454
Look, Randy, I'm asking you to help me out, man.

439
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:42,917
If the answer's no, the answer's no, not no with excuses.

440
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,835
Hey, man.

441
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:48,798
This ain't a fucking Andy McLaglen picture, you know?

442
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,384
I can't afford to hire a bunch of guys to smoke cigarettes

443
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:55,263
and sit around talking to each other all day
on the chance that I might use them.

444
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:59,392
I got a four-man team here, Rick.
If I need more than that, I gotta get it approved.

445
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,978
And, you know, I gotta look after my dudes.

446
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,981
Hey, and if your dudes were a better match for me,

447
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:09,235
I'd say, "Okay, you got me,"
but that's not the case, and you know it.

448
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,320
- He's a great fucking match for me.
- Yeah, no...

449
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:15,783
Hey, you could do anything you want to him.
Shit, throw him <i>off</i> a building, right?

450
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,745
Light him on fire. Hit him with a fucking Lincoln, right?

451
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:22,206
Get creative. Do whatever you want.
He's just happy for the opportunity.

452
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,750
- Rick.
- Yeah?

453
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,754
I don't dig him.

454
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,426
And I don't dig the vibe he brings on a set.

455
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,179
What, is there some old beef between the two of you?

456
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,598
- Oh, come on, man.
- What? What?

457
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,933
The dude killed his fucking wife.

458
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:46,189
Come on, man. You don't believe that old shit, do you?

459
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,940
Yes, Rick, I do.

460
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:51,277
And I work with my wife, and she believes it.

461
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,404
She doesn't want his creepy ass around.

462
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,619
You know, this is probably the shittiest weather ever.

463
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:04,916
The shittiest weather on the shittiest boat
with the shittiest person.

464
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:09,796
Natalie, my sister, said, "He's a loser. He's a loser."

465
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:13,257
They all said it, "He's a fucking loser,"
and I didn't believe them.

466
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,176
So I guess I'm the fucking idiot.

467
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,095
And now you're not gonna talk to me?

468
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,515
What, you don't feel like fighting?

469
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,266
Well, I feel like fucking fighting

470
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:28,189
because I've been up here by myself
for four hours on this fucking shithole of a boat.

471
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,398
Yeah.

472
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,279
He's a goddamn war hero. Fuck.

473
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,825
Yeah, appreciate it.

474
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:47,375
Okay, you fucking horse's ass.
Let's get you over to wardrobe.

475
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:55,466
Now, I'll put you in wardrobe,
but you don't stunt, I don't pay you.

476
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,511
Appreciate the opportunity, Randy. I won't let you down.

477
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:02,807
- You know my wife Janet, don't you?
- Yeah.

478
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,100
Steer clear of her.

479
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,479
Now, I admire Cassius Clay, I do.

480
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:13,192
What I admire is, in his sport,
there's an element of true combat.

481
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:18,239
When Cassius Clay meets Sonny Liston in the ring,
that's not two athletes posturing.

482
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,241
That's combat.

483
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,536
Two men trying to kill each other right now.

484
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,787
If you don't beat him...

485
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:26,998
he kills you.

486
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,625
That's beyond athletics.

487
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:33,337
That's beyond <i>Wide World of Sports,</i> you know?

488
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:37,008
That's two warriors engaged in combat. That's what I admire.

489
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,720
In martial arts tournaments, they won't let you fight like that.

490
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,222
It's very frustrating.

491
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:46,350
You stand in front of a guy,
and you just wanna let him have it.

492
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,270
But you can't.

493
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:53,316
So you gotta do this playacting, patty-cake version.

494
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,569
Cassius Clay. Sonny Liston. Joe Louis.

495
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,322
The coloured boxer, not that white kickboxing asshole.

496
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,701
They do what they need to do to win.

497
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:08,205
They unleash as much punishment as they have to
to defeat the other guy.

498
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:13,544
But in martial arts tournaments,
I do to win what they do to win.

499
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:16,047
I unleash all my power.

500
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,674
I kill people.

501
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:21,093
If you fought Cassius Clay, who would win?

502
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,930
Well, that would never happen.

503
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:26,641
But if you did, what do you think would happen?

504
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,185
I'd make him a cripple.

505
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:35,232
Hey, you. What's your name?

506
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,109
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

507
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,613
My name's Cliff.

508
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,740
I'm Rick Dalton's stunt double.

509
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,618
- Stuntman?
- Yeah.

510
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,079
You know, you're kind of pretty for a stuntman.

511
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,997
That's what they tell me.

512
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:53,334
So did I say something funny, stuntman?

513
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,420
- Yeah, you kind of did.
- What's so funny?

514
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,883
Look, I don't want any trouble. I'm just here to do a job.

515
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:04,428
But you're laughing at what I'm saying.
But I'm not saying anything funny.

516
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,263
So, what do you think is so funny?

517
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,642
What I think is...

518
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,314
you're a little man with a big mouth and a big chip,

519
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,066
and I think you should be embarrassed

520
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:22,071
to suggest you'd be anything more than a stain
on the seat of Cassius Clay's trunks.

521
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:25,241
Brother, you're the one with the big mouth.

522
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:29,954
And I would really enjoy closing it,
especially in front of all my friends.

523
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:33,416
But my hands are registered as lethal weapons.

524
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:39,880
That means, we get into a fight,
I accidentally kill you, I go to jail.

525
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,967
Anybody accidentally kills anybody in a fight,
they go to jail.

526
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,595
It's called manslaughter.
And I think all that "lethal weapon" horseshit

527
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:50,224
is just an excuse
so you dancers never have to get in a real fight.

528
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:52,852
Okay.

529
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,938
How about a friendly contest?

530
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,025
No punching in the face.

531
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,693
Two out of three.

532
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,820
Who puts who on the ground first?

533
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:07,199
Nobody tries to hurt nobody, just who ends up on their butt?

534
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,497
That's a great idea, Kato.

535
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,388
- You know, Bruce, that guy's kind of famous.
- That guy?

536
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:30,890
For what?

537
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:33,392
Killed his wife and got away with it.

538
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:34,643
That guy?

539
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:35,811
That guy.

540
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,296
Not bad, Kato.

541
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,757
Try that again.

542
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,262
What the fuck is going on here?

543
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:55,599
Hey, jackass, this is our series lead.
What the fuck are you thinking?

544
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,935
You're right, Janet. I'm sorry about that.

545
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,646
Don't fucking "Janet" me, you prick.

546
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,982
Hey. What's up, babe?

547
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,443
What's up, Randy, is that your loser asshole,

548
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:10,364
wife-killing buddy boy here was beating
the shit out of Bruce.

549
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,323
What?

550
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,450
- Hey, Randy.
- Cliff.

551
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,327
What the fuck, man?

552
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:19,206
Let me just say, nobody beat the shit out of Bruce.

553
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,500
It was a friendly contest. He barely touched me.

554
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:23,961
I think that dent in the car says something different.

555
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,882
Oh, my God!

556
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,426
What the fuck did you do to my car?!

557
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,678
What the fuck did you do to her car?

558
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:36,849
I threw this little prick into it, but I did not know it was her car.

559
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:41,437
Get the wardrobe off, get your shit, and get fucked!

560
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,521
- Janet!
- What?

561
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:45,608
- I will handle this.
- Then fucking handle it, Randy.

562
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:47,818
Cliff...

563
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:54,074
get the wardrobe off, get your shit, and get <i>off</i> the lot.

564
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,621
Fair enough.

565
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,531
What's the matter?

566
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:41,622
Are you afraid I'll tell Jim Morrison you were dancing
to Paul Revere and the Raiders?

567
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,666
Are they not cool enough for you?

568
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,052
Who's this shaggy asshole?

569
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:58,764
Hello? Can I help you?

570
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,600
Oh, yeah. Hey, man. I'm looking for Terry.

571
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:04,812
I'm a friend of Terry's and Dennis Wilson's.

572
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,691
Well, Terry and Candy don't live here anymore.
This is the Polanski residence now.

573
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,609
Really? He moved?

574
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,778
Dang.

575
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,948
You know--? You know where?

576
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:20,119
I'm not sure, really, but the owner of the property,
Paul, might. He's in the guest house.

577
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,955
Who is it, Jay?

578
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,749
It's okay, honey. It's a friend of Terry's.

579
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:30,045
- Yeah, just take the back path.
- Thank you kindly.

580
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:32,965
Ma'am.

581
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:51,608
- All right, that's an hour!
- Hey, Rick.

582
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:56,030
I know they just broke for lunch,
but you need to wait at least an hour before you can eat.

583
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,991
- Give that glue a chance to dry.
- Oh, no worries, honey.

584
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:03,746
I got my book. Say, say, where's the bad-guy saloon?

585
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:08,250
You just go straight through the Western town,
take a right and a left, and you see it right there.

586
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:11,253
- Thanks, honey.
- Yeah, that's better. That's better. Yeah.

587
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:14,381
Can we move to number two?

588
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,258
How is his bounce?

589
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,634
Can I get a bounce there?

590
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,928
Just grab the crescent wrench, come right back.

591
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:21,513
Just make it a quick one.

592
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,309
- Tim!
- Looks great. Right there.

593
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,022
Hello.

594
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:15,818
Hello.

595
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,446
Hello.

596
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:27,204
Would it bother you if I sat next to you
and read my book too?

597
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,499
I don't know.

598
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,335
Would you bother me?

599
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,712
I'll try not to.

600
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,259
Sit.

601
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:29,391
Sorry. Sorry about that.

602
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:37,983
You don't eat lunch?

603
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,570
I've got a scene after lunch.

604
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,488
Yeah?

605
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:47,534
Eating lunch before I do a scene makes me sluggish.

606
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:51,705
I believe it's the job of an actor--
And I say "actor," not "actress,"

607
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,625
because the word "actress" is nonsensical.

608
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:59,171
It's the actor's job to avoid impediments to their performance.

609
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:03,884
It's the actor's job to strive for 100 percent effectiveness.

610
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:07,554
Naturally, we never succeed, but it's the pursuit...

611
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:09,932
that's meaningful.

612
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,645
- Who are you?
- You can call me Marabella.

613
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,481
Mar-- Marabella what?

614
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,107
Marabella Lancer.

615
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:22,486
No, no, come on, come on. What's your real name?

616
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:28,659
When we're on set, I'd prefer to only be referred to
by my character's name.

617
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,870
It helps me invest in the reality of the story.

618
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:36,542
I've tried it both ways, and I'm always just a tiny bit better
when I don't break character.

619
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:40,254
And if I can be a tiny bit better, I want to be.

620
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:46,385
You're the bad guy. Caleb DeCoteau.

621
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:53,350
I thought it was pronounced Caleb "Dakota."

622
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,144
I'm pretty sure it's "DeCoteau."

623
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,107
DeCoteau.

624
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,403
DeCoteau. DeCoteau.

625
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,256
What are you reading?

626
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:28,051
It's a biography on Walt Disney.

627
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,761
It's fascinating.

628
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,722
He's a genius, you know.

629
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:35,225
I mean, a once-in-every-50-or-100-years kind of genius.

630
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:36,727
What are you, 12?

631
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,438
I'm 8.

632
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:41,690
What are you reading?

633
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,943
Just a Western.

634
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:48,030
What does that mean? Is it good?

635
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,158
- Pretty good.
- What's the story?

636
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,244
I haven't finished it yet.

637
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:57,497
I didn't ask for the whole story.

638
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,374
What's the idea of the story?

639
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,002
Well...

640
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,589
it's about this guy who's a bronco buster.

641
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,634
It's the story of his life.

642
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,720
Guy's name is Tom Breezy,

643
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,890
but everyone always calls him Easy Breezy.

644
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:17,601
Now, when Easy Breezy was in his 20s

645
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,729
and young and good-looking,

646
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:24,107
he could break any horse that you could throw at him.

647
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:27,110
Back then, he just had a way.

648
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:33,283
Now he's into his late 30s and he takes a bad fall,
and it messes up his hip.

649
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:38,288
He's not-- He's not--
He's not crippled or anything like that, but--

650
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:42,793
But he's got spine problems he never had before,
and he spends...

651
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:48,382
more of his days in pain than he ever did before.

652
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,801
Jeepers, this sounds like a good novel.

653
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,637
Yeah, it's not bad.

654
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,473
Where are you in it?

655
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,850
About midway.

656
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,021
What's happening to Easy Breezy now?

657
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,857
He's... He...

658
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,569
He's not the best anymore.

659
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:12,739
In fact, far from it. And...

660
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:18,245
he's coming to terms with what it's like to be slightly more...

661
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:22,290
use--

662
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:34,219
Slightly more useless each day.

663
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,279
It's okay, Caleb.

664
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,947
It's okay.

665
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,491
It sounds like a really sad book.

666
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,535
Poor Easy Breezy.

667
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,121
I'm practically crying and I haven't even read it.

668
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:06,501
- About 15 years, you'll be living it.
- What?

669
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:12,591
Nothing, pumpkin puss. I'm just...

670
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,177
I'm just teasing you.

671
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:18,013
You know something? You...

672
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,476
You might be right about this book.

673
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,479
I think it hits harder than I gave it credit for.

674
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:30,901
I don't like names like "pumpkin puss,"

675
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:35,989
but since you're upset, we'll talk about that some other time.

676
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:34,840
- I'm only going as far as Westwood Village.
- Hey, beggars can't be choosers.

677
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:35,841
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

678
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,363
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

679
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,199
- Good luck on your adventure.
- Thank you.

680
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:03,785
- Have a good time in Big Sur.
- Thank you so much.

681
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,078
- Take care.
- You too.

682
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:14,064
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

683
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,524
How can I help you, young lady?

684
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:23,490
I'm here to pick up a first edition
of Thomas Hardy's <i>Tess of the d'Urbervilles</i> I ordered.

685
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:24,824
It's under Polanski.

686
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:27,202
- Yeah, you're talking books there, kid.
- Oh, I know.

687
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,787
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah. Oh, man.

688
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,330
- I just read it.
- Yeah.

689
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,791
I'm getting it as a gift for my husband.

690
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:38,088
- Rick Dalton?
- You bet.

691
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,091
Jim Stacy. This is my show. Welcome aboard.

692
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:44,177
We're real glad to have a pro like you
playing the heavy on the pilot.

693
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:49,474
And I gotta tell you, I came damn close
to being in <i>The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.</i>

694
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:50,767
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

695
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,477
Let me tell you, I--

696
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,813
I just got my part by sheer luck.

697
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:58,400
Up until two weeks before shooting, Fabian was in the part.

698
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:02,821
Then he breaks his shoulder doing a <i>Virginian.</i>
That's how I got it, so...

699
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:08,910
Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you something I heard about.

700
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:12,080
Was it true you almost got the McQueen part
in <i>The Great Escape?</i>

701
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,668
- Hilts, isn't it?
- Captain Hilts, actually.

702
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,586
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen.

703
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:22,757
Never had an audition. Never had a meeting.
Never met John Sturges.

704
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:25,427
So, no, I don't think you could say I...

705
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,554
I almost got the part, but...

706
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,973
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

707
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:33,685
I suppose what's called in the American Army, a hotshot pilot.

708
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:38,606
But the story goes, for a brief moment,

709
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:42,777
McQueen almost passed on the movie,
and during that brief moment,

710
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,488
I, apparently, was on a list of four.

711
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:46,740
You have other plans?

712
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:51,995
I haven't seen Berlin yet from the ground or from the air,
and I plan on doing both before the war's over.

713
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,496
You and who?

714
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,833
- Me and-- Me and three Georges.
- Which three Georges?

715
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,460
Peppard, Maharis and Chakiris.

716
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,086
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

717
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,463
That's gotta hurt.

718
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,631
Yeah, well, I didn't get it,

719
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:05,050
McQueen did it,

720
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:08,136
and, frankly, I never had a chance.

721
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,890
Ten days isolation, Hilts.

722
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:13,016
Captain Hilts.

723
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,101
Twenty days.

724
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,019
Right.

725
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:20,148
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?

726
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:22,525
Cooler.

727
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:21,042
- One, please.
- Seventy-five cents.

728
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,422
What if I'm in the movie?

729
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,133
What do you mean?

730
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:30,885
I mean, I'm in the movie.

731
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:32,428
I'm Sharon Tate.

732
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:34,472
You're in this?

733
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:37,308
I play Miss Carlson, the klutz.

734
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:39,686
That's me.

735
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,149
But that's the girl from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

736
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:49,863
Well, that's me, the girl from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

737
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,991
- Really?
- Really.

738
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,328
Hey, Rubin! Come out here.

739
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,835
This is the girl from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

740
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:06,171
- Patty Duke?
- No, the other one.

741
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:08,256
- The girl from <i>Peyton Place?</i>
- No, the other one.

742
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,758
The one who ends up doing dirty movies.

743
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,471
- She's in this movie.
- Sharon Tate.

744
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:20,727
Well, welcome to the Bruin, Miss Tate.
Thank you for coming to our theatre.

745
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:23,563
- Would you like to come in and see the show?
- Could I?

746
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:25,231
By all means.

747
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,066
Thank you.

748
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:32,030
- Hey, can I get a picture?
- Oh, sure.

749
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:32,989
Okay.

750
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:41,748
You know, why don't you stand over by the poster
so people will know who you are.

751
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,167
Okay. Could you?

752
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,306
Would you like some refreshments?

753
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,516
- Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Enjoy the show.

754
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:40,598
<i>-Can I ask you a personal question?
- I wish you would.</i>

755
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:44,811
<i>How did a nice boy like you get involved
with a group like the Heads?</i>

756
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,356
<i>I turned to them after I was rejected
by the Daughters of the American Revolution.</i>

757
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:13,423
<i>Very pleasant hotel here.</i>

758
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:16,217
<i>-Mr Helm?
- Yes?</i>

759
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,682
<i>I'm Freya.</i>

760
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,809
<i>Welcome to Denmark, Mr Helm.</i>

761
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,980
<i>These are for you. Street maps, places of interest.</i>

762
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:30,440
<i>This is for you too.</i>

763
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:34,068
<i>-What year was that?
- 1949.</i>

764
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:37,447
<i>-Oh, that's a very good year.
- I'm here to help you in any way I can.</i>

765
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,325
<i>-That's very nice of you.
- Is there anything you'd like me to do?</i>

766
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:43,077
<i>-Yes, ma'am, a couple things.
- Yes, sir.</i>

767
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:46,622
<i>Would you mind getting off my camera case, please?</i>

768
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,291
<i>-Oh, l'm sorry.
- Oh, that's all right.</i>

769
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,460
<i>-I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.</i>

770
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:51,627
<i>I'm sorry about...</i>

771
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:54,630
<i>Welcome to Denmark.</i>

772
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:06,225
<i>This is some kind of hotel you've got here.</i>

773
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,563
<i>Haifa bottle is better than none.</i>

774
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,324
Morning, partner.

775
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,619
Probably come by to see you later.

776
01:09:58,319 --> 01:09:59,987
That's far enough, jughead.

777
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:02,824
Name's not jughead.

778
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,327
What you doing around here, boy?

779
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:09,372
I'm thirsty. That's a saloon, ain't it?

780
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:12,583
Oh, yeah, that's a saloon.

781
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,253
- Only you can't come in.
- Mr Gilbert.

782
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:20,216
Don't let me stop you from earning your money.

783
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:27,140
I know how bored and restless you get
when you run out of tamales.

784
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,935
But, Mr Gilbert, if I was you,

785
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,647
I'd find out that jughead's name.

786
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:38,693
Allow me to introduce the two of you.

787
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,655
This here is Bob Gilbert.

788
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,491
The Businessman?

789
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:46,784
That's right.

790
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:51,873
Business Bob Gilbert. And who might he be, Caleb?

791
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:54,500
Well, that's a fella by the name of Madrid.

792
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:57,462
Johnny Madrid.

793
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,381
Who's Johnny Madrid?

794
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:08,264
He ain't from round here.

795
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,475
No, really.

796
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:11,601
Who is he, Caleb?

797
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:18,232
Oh, you're about to find out...

798
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,027
Businessman.

799
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:41,714
Ready when you are, Gilbert.

800
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,424
Johnny Madrid.

801
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,598
How long has it been?

802
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:36,185
Since that time in Juárez, about three years ago.

803
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,689
Well, come on in and have a drink.

804
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:42,191
Hell, in that case...

805
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,571
buy you a drink, Caleb?

806
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:47,822
Sure, Johnny.

807
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,742
How about some mezcal?

808
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:53,953
Like that time in Juárez.

809
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,790
A lot of people died that day.

810
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,417
Yes, they did.

811
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,337
But we had a good time.

812
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:04,547
Didn't we?

813
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,716
Yeah, we did.

814
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:09,427
After you, DeCoteau.

815
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:13,848
Pepe! Get your behind behind that bar.

816
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:15,349
I have a guest.

817
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,159
How's the beans?

818
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,037
I've had worse.

819
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:39,790
One dollar.

820
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:46,505
To my wife and all my sweethearts.

821
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:49,091
May they never meet.

822
01:13:56,015 --> 01:14:00,936
Señor Madrid, you care to join me at my table
where I entertain my guests?

823
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,481
I'd be delighted, Monsieur DeCoteau.

824
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,068
Take the bottle with you.

825
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,488
So, Johnny...

826
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,825
what brings you to Arroyo del Oro?

827
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:17,870
Oh, you know me, Caleb.

828
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:18,954
Money.

829
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:23,000
And who's paying around here?

830
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:24,168
I hope you.

831
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:28,964
And what have you heard about me?

832
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:30,883
I heard about the Lancer Ranch.

833
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:33,177
All the cattle you've appropriated.

834
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:36,555
A lot of land, a lot of cows,
a lot of money, no law to speak of,

835
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:40,893
and nothing but an old man
and some Mexican ranch hands to shoo you off.

836
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:48,067
Say, where's that chilli pepper daughter of yours
with the fiddle?

837
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,902
She's asleep.

838
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:55,157
Wake her the heck up, get her down here
with her fiddle and her bow, and entertain my guest.

839
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:00,871
But, please, don't hurt her this time.

840
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:03,958
I ain't gonna hurt her.

841
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:07,002
I just want her to play the fiddle.

842
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:14,301
Line? "Go-- Go fetch her and tell her" what?

843
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:17,513
"Go fetch her and tell her I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece..."

844
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:21,434
Right. Go fetch her
and tell her I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece,

845
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,644
she play her little chilli pepper heart out,
right?

846
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:24,770
- Right.
- Got it.

847
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,237
I ain't gonna hurt her.

848
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,614
I just want her to play the fiddle.

849
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:38,784
Now, go fetch her and tell her I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece,

850
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:41,954
she play her little chilli pepper heart out.

851
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:43,038
Go on.

852
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,795
So, Johnny,

853
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,631
what else you heard?

854
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,886
I heard you're pushing Lancer pretty hard,

855
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:59,764
but Lancer's got money.

856
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:02,933
At some point,

857
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:05,352
he's gonna hire some guns

858
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:07,563
and push back.

859
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:18,157
- Line. Line. Line, line, line.
- "Maybe he already has."

860
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:21,827
Maybe...

861
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,413
- Goddamn it! I fucked this whole thing up, Sam.
- Keep going!

862
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:26,040
- I fucked this up.
- Fight through it.

863
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:28,250
Can we just go back? Please, can we just cut?

864
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:31,128
- No, really, just say the fucking line!
- No, really, Sam, please.

865
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:33,172
- "Maybe he already has."
- All right, all right!

866
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,341
- "Maybe he already has!"
- All right, goddamn it!

867
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,675
All right, all right!

868
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,429
You're a goddamn outlaw, Rick. Come on, now.

869
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:43,891
I got it. I got it.

870
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,519
Go back a bit, would you?

871
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,270
No, he's right. Back to one.

872
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,482
- Okay, now, use all that, baby.
- I'm gonna use it.

873
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:54,026
- Oh, I'm gonna use it.
- Put it all inside.

874
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,110
I'm gonna use it.

875
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,072
And...

876
01:16:59,114 --> 01:16:59,990
action.

877
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,704
I heard you're pushing Lancer pretty hard,

878
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:08,374
but Lancer's got money.

879
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,418
At some point,

880
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:15,840
he's gonna hire some guns and push back.

881
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:21,387
Maybe he already has.

882
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:24,098
Maybe.

883
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,103
Maybe I don't like Lancer.

884
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,398
Maybe I don't like his boots.

885
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:38,320
Maybe I don't like the way
he uses those boots to step on people.

886
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,159
What the fuck was that?!

887
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:46,662
Jesus Christ!

888
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:47,997
Fuck!

889
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,332
Piece of shit.

890
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:52,418
Fucking damn it, Rick, I swear to God.

891
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:57,089
Forgot your fucking lines, embarrassed yourself like that
in front of all those goddamn people!

892
01:17:57,214 --> 01:18:03,220
Well, you were drinking all night, fucking drinking again,
eight goddamn fucking whisky sours.

893
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:06,473
Fucking bullshit.

894
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:10,728
You're a fucking miserable drunk.

895
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,105
Not fucking remembering your fucking lines.

896
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:16,984
I practised them,
and now I don't look like I goddamn practised them!

897
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:19,361
You're sitting there like a fucking baboon!

898
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,073
Fuck! Eight fucking whisky sours.

899
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:26,160
I couldn't stop at fucking three or four. I have eight!

900
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:29,872
Why?! You're a fucking alcoholic.
You fucking drink too much, huh?

901
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,374
Every fucking night. Every fucking night.

902
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,543
That's it, that's fucking it!

903
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:35,502
That's fucking it.

904
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,922
You stop drinking right now, all right?

905
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:41,592
Make a promise to yourself.
You're gonna stop fucking drinking.

906
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:42,718
Oh, fuck it.

907
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:47,181
Damn it!

908
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:52,269
You show that little fucking girl.
You're gonna show that goddamn Jim Stacy.

909
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:56,565
You're gonna show all of them on that goddamn fucking set
who the fuck Rick Dalton is, all right?

910
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,817
Let me tell you something.

911
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:01,528
You don't get these lines right,

912
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:04,573
I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out tonight.

913
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:09,119
All right? Your brains are gonna be splattered
all over your goddamn pool.

914
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:11,121
I mean it, motherfucker.

915
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:12,623
Get your shit together.

916
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:20,482
- Better? Okay.
- It's great.

917
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,528
Hey!

918
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:49,404
Hi.

919
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:58,122
Shit.

920
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,297
Fuck you, you fucking pig!

921
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:09,258
Oh, no.

922
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:25,816
Hello, hot stuff.

923
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,110
Looks like third time's the charm.

924
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:30,279
How were those pickles?

925
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:36,910
Real good. They were the fancy kind.

926
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:40,747
Give me a lift?

927
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:42,416
Where are you going?

928
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:45,377
I'm going to Chatsworth.

929
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:47,212
Chatsworth?

930
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:53,010
You hitch up and down Burbank Boulevard all day
till someone says they'll drive you to Chatsworth?

931
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:55,637
Tourists love to drive me.

932
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:57,723
I'm their favourite part of their L.A. vacation.

933
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:01,435
They'll be telling stories about the Hollywood hippie girl

934
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:05,189
that they gave a ride to the movie ranch
for the rest of their lives.

935
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:06,732
Wait, Spahn Movie Ranch?

936
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:10,611
- Yeah.
- That's where you're going? Spahn Movie Ranch?

937
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:13,071
Why you going there?

938
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:14,781
I live there.

939
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:18,202
- Alone?
- No.

940
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:19,494
Me and my friends.

941
01:23:21,038 --> 01:23:25,292
So you and a bunch of friends like you all live
at Spahn Movie Ranch?

942
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:27,711
Yeah.

943
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,673
Well, hop in. I'll take you there.

944
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:33,508
Great!

945
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:46,355
- Go down here and get on the Hollywood Freeway.
- I know where it is.

946
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:52,361
Are you some old cowboy guy
that used to make movies there?

947
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:55,614
What?

948
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:58,575
I'm just surprised how accurate
that description of me really is.

949
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:02,371
Some old cowboy guy that used to shoot movies
at Spahn Ranch.

950
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:08,001
So you used to make Westerns at the ranch
back in the old-timey days?

951
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:16,260
Well, if by "the old-timey days,"
you mean television eight years ago, yeah.

952
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:17,719
Are you an actor?

953
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,429
No, I'm a stuntman.

954
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:21,765
You're a stuntman.

955
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,685
That's way better.

956
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:27,145
Why is that way better?

957
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:29,523
Actors are phoney.

958
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:32,734
They just say lines that other people write

959
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:36,029
and pretend to murder people on their stupid TV shows.

960
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:39,783
Meanwhile, real people are being murdered
every day in Vietnam.

961
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,349
Want me to suck your cock while driving?

962
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:14,234
How old are you?

963
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:16,528
What?

964
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,322
How old are you?

965
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:21,616
Wow, man.

966
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:26,288
That's the first time anybody asked that in a long time.

967
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:27,914
What's the answer?

968
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:33,337
Okay. We gonna play kiddie games?

969
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,758
Eighteen. Feel better?

970
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:41,970
You got some ID, you know,
like a driver's licence or something?

971
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,305
Are you joking?

972
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:44,348
No, I'm not.

973
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:50,896
I need to see something official that verifies that you're 18,
which you don't have because you're not.

974
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:57,027
Talk about a bring-down bummer, dude.

975
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,236
That's you.

976
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,154
Yeah.

977
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:07,454
Obviously, I'm not too young to fuck you.

978
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:10,457
But obviously, you are too old to fuck me.

979
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,961
What I'm too old to do is go to jail for poontang.

980
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:20,133
Prison's been trying to get me all my life. It ain't got me yet.

981
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:21,718
The day it does,

982
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:23,470
it won't be because of you.

983
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:25,555
No offence.

984
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,435
<i>You all right, honey?</i>

985
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:32,771
She's just fine, ain't you, shorty?

986
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,773
<i>I'm fine, Scott.</i>

987
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:37,567
- <i>They haven't hurt you?</i>
- Camera's ready, Mr Dalton.

988
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,113
I'll be right out.

989
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:43,573
<i>The war.</i>

990
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,786
<i>I rode with the British cavalry in Indi--</i>

991
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:42,174
Stand by, guys. We're going in five.

992
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:59,441
Lancer's boys are here!

993
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:02,194
The old man here?

994
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:03,487
Nada.

995
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:05,489
But the son is.

996
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,161
The one from Boston.

997
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:13,288
I don't know.

998
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,707
You from Boston?

999
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:16,875
Yes.

1000
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,460
It's the Boston one!

1001
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:22,130
Keep the others outside.

1002
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:24,674
Let the brother come in.

1003
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:28,011
You heard him, Boston.

1004
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:38,855
Come on in, Boston.

1005
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:41,525
See, honey?

1006
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:43,902
I told you they'd come to parlay.

1007
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:46,738
You all right, honey?

1008
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:49,866
Oh, she's just fine.

1009
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,076
Ain't you, shorty?

1010
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:54,079
I'm fine, Scott.

1011
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:56,206
They haven't hurt you?

1012
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:58,917
Not yet, I ain't.

1013
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,835
But that can all change...

1014
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:02,921
like that.

1015
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:07,509
Say...

1016
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:09,970
where'd you get that limp?

1017
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:12,389
From the war.

1018
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,058
Which side?

1019
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:18,979
I rode with the British cavalry in India.

1020
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:22,649
What'd they call that outfit?

1021
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,859
Bengal Lancers.

1022
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,824
Now, now, now, that is funny.

1023
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:33,410
- That is funny.
- That's not so funny.

1024
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:34,786
Don't you get it?

1025
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,871
"Bengal Lancer"?

1026
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:39,708
Oh, yeah.

1027
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,459
I get it now.

1028
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:44,129
- That is kind of funny.
- It is.

1029
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:47,757
You do know kidnapping is a hanging offence.

1030
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:50,760
So is blowing the heads <i>off</i> little girls.

1031
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:55,307
But they can only hang me once, right?

1032
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:57,392
So...

1033
01:29:58,977 --> 01:30:00,604
you come down here for a--

1034
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:02,981
For a Boston social?

1035
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:05,734
- Or we gonna talk price?
- How much?

1036
01:30:06,276 --> 01:30:09,863
I'd say $50,000 would buy me

1037
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:13,450
a whole lot of chicken mole in Mexico.

1038
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:14,993
That's a lot of money.

1039
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:17,454
Well, she's a lot of little girl.

1040
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:18,830
Or don't you agree?

1041
01:30:19,873 --> 01:30:20,874
I agree.

1042
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:23,918
So, what's next?

1043
01:30:24,753 --> 01:30:29,382
I'll send one of my boys out to your ranch
to fill you in on all the details...

1044
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:35,096
but the one detail I'm gonna fill you in on right now is this:

1045
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:41,061
I don't want no beaner bronco buster
handing me that $50,000.

1046
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:44,356
I want the old man himself.

1047
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:50,028
Murdoch Lancer puts $50,000 in my lap...

1048
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:53,323
or I heave this little pitcher down a well!

1049
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:55,950
You got that, Boston?!

1050
01:30:57,911 --> 01:30:58,745
Yeah.

1051
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:01,790
All right, messenger boy.

1052
01:31:03,249 --> 01:31:04,834
Deliver my message.

1053
01:31:11,549 --> 01:31:15,053
Give me evil, sexy Hamlet.

1054
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:16,971
Settle into it.

1055
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:18,348
Enjoy it.

1056
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:20,350
And cut!

1057
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:24,312
Oh, boy.

1058
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:26,898
I didn't hurt you there, Marabella, with that throw, did I?

1059
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:29,484
No, no, no. I'm good. I got pads on.

1060
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:34,781
And I throw myself on the floor just for fun,
even when I'm not getting paid.

1061
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:36,324
The gate's clean.

1062
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,160
Rick, Rick, Rick.

1063
01:31:39,244 --> 01:31:40,870
Put her there.

1064
01:31:40,954 --> 01:31:42,122
- That was it.
- Really?

1065
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:43,498
That was absolutely fantastic.

1066
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:44,874
- Oh, thank you.
- I loved it.

1067
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:49,003
Hey, and your idea about throwing the little girl
on the ground, that just worked like a charm.

1068
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:52,340
- I figured you said Shakespeare, so... Yeah.
- That's right. That was--

1069
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:54,551
That's what I mean by "scare me."

1070
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:57,053
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Evil Hamlet scares people.

1071
01:31:57,137 --> 01:31:59,597
- All right.
- Oh, and by the way...

1072
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:01,808
- "Beaner bronco buster"?
- Yeah.

1073
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:04,477
- Where the hell did that come from?
- I don't know. Improv.

1074
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:09,274
That was wonderful. It was just--
That was a triple alliterative improv.

1075
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:10,900
You don't hear those too often.

1076
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:12,736
- Okay? We're good.
- All right. We don't--?

1077
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:15,363
- Don't need to go again?
- No, we're done. That was fantastic.

1078
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,032
- All right.
- Okay, moving on. We're in the bordello.

1079
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:19,117
Next setup!

1080
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:27,167
That was the best acting I've ever seen in my whole life.

1081
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:29,544
Thank you.

1082
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:49,773
Rick fucking Dalton.

1083
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:03,703
That's a car.

1084
01:33:05,205 --> 01:33:06,748
That's a strange car.

1085
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:09,709
Snake, go see who's outside.

1086
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:24,307
So who is it?

1087
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:25,683
I ain't for sure yet.

1088
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:28,269
It's a bitchin' yellow Coupe de Ville.

1089
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:30,480
Keep an eye on him.

1090
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:20,613
Come on.

1091
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:39,591
Where the hell is everybody?

1092
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:49,976
Hey, where's Gypsy?

1093
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:52,145
She's down by the chop shop.

1094
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:01,112
- Hey!
- Hello!

1095
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:04,282
Gypsy! I want you to come meet my new friend.

1096
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:08,494
Some old-looking dude in a Hawaiian shirt
who just gave Pussycat a ride home.

1097
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:10,246
He just gave her a lift?

1098
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:14,667
Nope. She's bringing him down the ranch to meet everybody.

1099
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:17,086
Stay by the door. Tell me if he starts coming this way.

1100
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:21,633
- Welcome to our community.
- Thanks for having me.

1101
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:24,093
And thank you for giving our precious Pussy a ride home.

1102
01:35:24,177 --> 01:35:25,470
Think nothing of it.

1103
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:27,388
We love Pussy.

1104
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:28,723
Yes, we do.

1105
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:30,850
Hey, where is everybody? Where's the children?

1106
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:33,519
Everybody left for Santa Barbara.

1107
01:35:33,603 --> 01:35:35,146
Really?

1108
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:37,273
Charlie's gone? Everybody left?

1109
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:40,443
Well, not everybody-everybody, but mostly everybody.

1110
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:44,238
Drag.

1111
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:47,325
I really wanted Cliff to meet Charlie.

1112
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:50,703
I think Charlie's really gonna dig you.

1113
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:53,122
- Angel, hold up.
- Well, maybe next time.

1114
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:54,415
Yeah, you got to come back.

1115
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:58,127
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

1116
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:02,298
So how's it all comparing to your glory days?

1117
01:36:02,382 --> 01:36:04,342
Well, things have changed.

1118
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:09,722
Not a bad mount, Connie.

1119
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:11,933
I used to ride horses every day back in Tennessee.

1120
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:14,268
- Is that right?
- Every day?

1121
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:16,312
Well, every week.

1122
01:36:16,396 --> 01:36:18,022
All right.

1123
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:19,857
Ain't she just darling?

1124
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:26,656
So my name is Lulu.

1125
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:27,949
This is Tex.

1126
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:33,454
We're gonna be leading you on a great trail ride
through the beautiful Santa Susana canyons.

1127
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:36,791
Now, Curt, I hear you're already an experienced rider.

1128
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:39,210
- Yes.
- Yeah, and so are you, Connie?

1129
01:36:39,293 --> 01:36:40,628
- Yes, I am.
- Hey, Tex?

1130
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:43,965
- Come here.
- So if you're both experienced riders,

1131
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:47,260
I guess we'll just make this ride about having fun.

1132
01:36:47,343 --> 01:36:48,511
You ready to have some fun?

1133
01:36:48,594 --> 01:36:51,514
So Pussycat brought back some guy with her.

1134
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:53,808
- Gypsy wants you to go give him a look-see.
- Yeah. Sure thing.

1135
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:17,123
Oh, and here's someone you absolutely have to meet.

1136
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:19,584
One of our most favourite sons.

1137
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:22,336
Tex, come on over here and say hi to Cliff.

1138
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,589
- Howdy, Cliff.
- Tex.

1139
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:28,301
- What part of Texas you from?
- Oh, a place you never heard of.

1140
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:29,218
Copeville.

1141
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:31,554
Ever been to Houston?

1142
01:37:31,637 --> 01:37:33,139
Course I have.

1143
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:35,725
Yeah, I spent two weeks once on a Houston chain gang.

1144
01:37:35,808 --> 01:37:37,143
In August, no less.

1145
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:39,562
That doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun.

1146
01:37:40,146 --> 01:37:43,107
It's the last cop's jaw I ever broke, I can tell you that.

1147
01:37:47,487 --> 01:37:48,362
Man...

1148
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:51,324
Charlie's gonna dig you.

1149
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:54,619
The Hawaiian guy seems to be okay.

1150
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:56,788
Everybody's talking all friendly.

1151
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:59,082
- Enjoy your day!
- Thank you.

1152
01:38:00,458 --> 01:38:02,502
Tex checked him out, and now he's riding away.

1153
01:38:03,002 --> 01:38:05,421
If he comes this way, let me know.

1154
01:38:08,174 --> 01:38:10,802
Hey, does George Spahn still own this ranch?

1155
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:12,887
Yeah, George still owns it.

1156
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:16,015
- Does he still live here?
- Yeah.

1157
01:38:16,099 --> 01:38:19,018
Does he still live right there?

1158
01:38:19,102 --> 01:38:20,103
Yeah.

1159
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:21,521
Is he here now?

1160
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:23,272
I guess so.

1161
01:38:25,191 --> 01:38:27,902
So George gave you all permission to be here?

1162
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:30,196
Course he did.

1163
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:31,906
And y'all take care of him?

1164
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:35,243
Oh, we take care of George.

1165
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:36,536
We love George.

1166
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:42,583
Is there anything wrong
with me saying hello to an old friend?

1167
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:44,502
You can't see him right now.

1168
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:46,879
Why can't I see him right now?

1169
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:49,674
Because he's napping.

1170
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:53,219
This is his nap time.

1171
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:06,065
Well, I think I'll just go see for myself.

1172
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:09,193
You never know.

1173
01:39:09,277 --> 01:39:10,903
He might have just woke up.

1174
01:39:20,663 --> 01:39:22,665
The old Hawaiian guy's coming this way.

1175
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,543
Okay, y'all, beat it.

1176
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:26,878
I'll handle this guy.

1177
01:39:31,257 --> 01:39:32,091
Fine.

1178
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,263
You the mama bear?

1179
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:23,184
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

1180
01:40:23,267 --> 01:40:26,229
I'm an old friend of George's. Thought I'd stop and say hello.

1181
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:29,690
That's very nice of you,
but unfortunately, you picked the wrong time.

1182
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:31,442
George is taking a nap right now.

1183
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:33,819
Oh, that is unfortunate.

1184
01:40:33,903 --> 01:40:35,238
Yes, it is.

1185
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:38,991
- What's your name?
- Cliff Booth.

1186
01:40:39,492 --> 01:40:40,493
How do you know George?

1187
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,995
I used to shoot Westerns here at the ranch.

1188
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:45,039
When was the last time you saw George?

1189
01:40:45,456 --> 01:40:48,709
Oh, I'd say about...

1190
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:51,003
eight years ago.

1191
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:56,342
I'm sorry. I didn't realise the two of you were so close.

1192
01:40:57,635 --> 01:40:59,845
When he wakes up, I'll let him know you came by.

1193
01:41:00,471 --> 01:41:04,392
I'd really like to say a quick hello now while I'm here.

1194
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:06,018
Came a long ways.

1195
01:41:06,102 --> 01:41:08,896
Don't know when I'll get back this way again.

1196
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:11,774
Oh, I understand, but I'm afraid that's impossible.

1197
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:14,235
Impossible?

1198
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:16,112
Why is that impossible?

1199
01:41:16,195 --> 01:41:19,573
Because me and George like to watch TV
on Sunday night-- <i>F.B.I.</i> and <i>Bonanza.</i>

1200
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:22,410
- -But George finds it hard to keep awake that late,
so I make him take a nap now

1201
01:41:22,493 --> 01:41:24,578
so I don't get gypped out of my George TV time.

1202
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:31,335
Well, look, Red, I'm coming in there.

1203
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:34,964
With my own two eyes, I'm gonna get a good look at George.

1204
01:41:36,173 --> 01:41:37,466
And this...

1205
01:41:39,385 --> 01:41:40,678
ain't stopping me.

1206
01:41:44,473 --> 01:41:45,308
Okay.

1207
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:48,185
Suit yourself.

1208
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:15,481
He back there?

1209
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:19,068
Door at the end of the hallway.

1210
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:23,906
You might have to shake him awake.
I fucked his brains out this morning.

1211
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,538
He may be tired.

1212
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,468
Oh, Mr Eight Years Ago?

1213
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:49,682
George is blind,
so you'll probably have to tell him who you are.

1214
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:17,376
George, you awake?

1215
01:44:35,686 --> 01:44:36,729
George?

1216
01:44:39,023 --> 01:44:40,065
George?

1217
01:44:44,069 --> 01:44:45,029
George?

1218
01:44:47,323 --> 01:44:50,284
- George!
- Jesus.

1219
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:52,369
- Hi, George.
- Wait a minute.

1220
01:44:53,078 --> 01:44:55,164
- What's going on?
- Everything's all right.

1221
01:44:55,247 --> 01:44:58,375
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Who are you?

1222
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:00,336
It's Cliff Booth.

1223
01:45:00,461 --> 01:45:05,049
- Just stopped in to say hello and see how you're doing.
- John Wilkes Booth?

1224
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:06,675
No, Cliff Booth.

1225
01:45:08,928 --> 01:45:10,221
Who's that?

1226
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:12,890
I used to shoot <i>Bounty Law</i> here, George.

1227
01:45:12,973 --> 01:45:14,975
I was Rick Dalton's stunt double.

1228
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:17,895
- Who?
- Rick Dalton.

1229
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:19,563
The Dalton Brothers?

1230
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:21,357
No, Rick Dalton.

1231
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:23,901
Who's that?

1232
01:45:23,984 --> 01:45:26,904
He was the star of <i>Bounty Law.</i>

1233
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:28,697
And who are you?

1234
01:45:28,781 --> 01:45:30,491
I was Rick's stunt double.

1235
01:45:31,617 --> 01:45:33,536
Rick who?

1236
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:35,329
It don't matter, George.

1237
01:45:35,454 --> 01:45:40,501
We were colleagues from the past,
and I just wanted to make sure you're doing okay.

1238
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:42,920
- I'm not doing okay.
- What's the matter?

1239
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:46,590
Can't see shit. Would you call that "the matter"?

1240
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:50,970
- The man can't see shit, okay?
- I know. I'm sorry about that. I was told.

1241
01:45:51,053 --> 01:45:53,138
Squeaky sent me to bed.

1242
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:56,058
Would that be the little redhead out front?

1243
01:45:59,019 --> 01:46:01,605
What the fuck is the matter with you?

1244
01:46:01,689 --> 01:46:05,568
First you wake me up,
and now you're pretending that I didn't tell you

1245
01:46:05,651 --> 01:46:07,361
I was fucking blind!

1246
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:10,906
How am I gonna know what the hell colour the head

1247
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:13,742
of the girl is that's with me all the time?

1248
01:46:13,826 --> 01:46:15,703
Oh, fair enough, George.

1249
01:46:19,123 --> 01:46:22,459
- No. Jesus Christ.
- Come on, George. All right.

1250
01:46:22,543 --> 01:46:25,129
Everyone don't need a stuntman.

1251
01:46:32,761 --> 01:46:34,555
I don't know who you are...

1252
01:46:36,724 --> 01:46:38,809
but you touched me today.

1253
01:46:40,769 --> 01:46:43,314
You came to visit me.

1254
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:45,482
Now I got to go back to sleep.

1255
01:46:47,985 --> 01:46:50,696
I got to watch <i>F.B.I.</i> tonight.

1256
01:46:50,779 --> 01:46:52,448
I watch it with Squeaky.

1257
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:56,493
She gets all pissed off if I fall asleep.

1258
01:46:57,536 --> 01:47:00,247
What happens when she gets pissed off, George?

1259
01:47:01,498 --> 01:47:02,625
Nothing.

1260
01:47:04,209 --> 01:47:06,587
I just don't like to disappoint her.

1261
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:14,678
So you gave all these hippies permission to be here?

1262
01:47:20,684 --> 01:47:23,145
Just who the fuck are you?

1263
01:47:23,228 --> 01:47:25,147
I'm Cliff Booth.

1264
01:47:25,230 --> 01:47:28,776
I'm a stuntman. We used to work together, George.

1265
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:31,612
And I just want to make sure you're okay.

1266
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:35,407
And that all these hippies aren't taking advantage of you.

1267
01:47:35,491 --> 01:47:38,285
- Squeaky?
- Yeah.

1268
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:40,245
She loves me.

1269
01:47:42,831 --> 01:47:44,500
So suck on that.

1270
01:47:53,425 --> 01:47:55,135
You take care, George.

1271
01:48:02,017 --> 01:48:03,644
Goddamn it.

1272
01:48:25,082 --> 01:48:26,458
You embarrassed me.

1273
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:29,253
Yeah, sorry about that.

1274
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:35,134
How'd your little talk with George go?
Are we kidnapping him?

1275
01:48:35,217 --> 01:48:37,219
Not the word I'd use.

1276
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:39,430
Now that you've talked to him,
do you believe everything's all right?

1277
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:41,390
Not exactly.

1278
01:48:41,473 --> 01:48:44,810
- This was a mistake. You should leave.
- Way ahead of you.

1279
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:51,734
George isn't blind!

1280
01:48:51,817 --> 01:48:53,277
You're the blind one!

1281
01:49:38,447 --> 01:49:39,782
You do that?

1282
01:49:44,661 --> 01:49:46,121
You know, that's not my car.

1283
01:49:46,997 --> 01:49:49,082
That's my boss's car.

1284
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:52,836
And if something were to happen to my boss's car,
well, I'd get in trouble.

1285
01:49:55,506 --> 01:49:57,758
Lucky for you, he's got a spare.

1286
01:50:11,522 --> 01:50:12,856
Fix it.

1287
01:50:13,982 --> 01:50:15,150
Fuck you.

1288
01:50:47,307 --> 01:50:48,350
Ladies.

1289
01:50:55,649 --> 01:50:58,777
Come one step closer and I will knock his teeth out.

1290
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,206
Fix it.

1291
01:51:11,874 --> 01:51:14,167
Can I at least get a rag to wipe my face first?

1292
01:51:14,251 --> 01:51:15,794
Nope.

1293
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:17,588
Tyre first.

1294
01:51:27,806 --> 01:51:29,600
- Sundance.
- Yeah.

1295
01:51:29,683 --> 01:51:33,228
Get on a horse, go get Tex and get his ass down here.

1296
01:51:33,312 --> 01:51:34,146
Okay.

1297
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:45,282
<i>I love you.</i>

1298
01:52:09,598 --> 01:52:11,433
Tex! Tex!

1299
01:52:12,434 --> 01:52:15,312
That Hawaiian guy's back at the ranch
kicking Clem's face in.

1300
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:18,732
I'll take over for Tex.

1301
01:52:18,815 --> 01:52:19,942
Right this way.

1302
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:11,785
Clem, you all right?

1303
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:35,308
How do?

1304
01:53:35,392 --> 01:53:38,937
What a day. Shit, I almost lost my shit.

1305
01:54:26,276 --> 01:54:27,611
You...

1306
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:30,363
You want to come in and watch my <i>F.B.I. ?</i>

1307
01:54:30,447 --> 01:54:33,033
Why, I just figured we would. I got a six-pack in the back.

1308
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:34,534
Thought we'd order a pizza.

1309
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:35,911
All right.

1310
01:54:35,994 --> 01:54:36,995
All right.

1311
01:54:58,433 --> 01:55:00,977
<i>Eighteen miles to Pendleton, Willard.</i>

1312
01:55:01,061 --> 01:55:03,063
<i>Any kind of luck, we'll be unloaded</i>

1313
01:55:03,146 --> 01:55:05,941
<i>and back at El Toro before my kids go to bed.</i>

1314
01:55:10,695 --> 01:55:14,491
Hey, bought me an acid-dipped cigarette today.

1315
01:55:14,574 --> 01:55:15,826
Oh, yeah?

1316
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:17,911
You want to buy a cigarette dipped in acid?

1317
01:55:17,994 --> 01:55:19,746
Yeah.

1318
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:23,458
If I'm gonna trip, I want to trip here, man.
Walk in the woods. Not in my home.

1319
01:55:26,169 --> 01:55:27,254
Just gonna stash it here.

1320
01:55:27,337 --> 01:55:29,506
- Don't smoke it by mistake.
- Yeah.

1321
01:55:29,589 --> 01:55:32,050
You want to smoke some, smoke some. Just save me some.

1322
01:55:32,551 --> 01:55:35,846
Nah, I don't need to trip out on no acid.

1323
01:55:35,929 --> 01:55:37,806
My booze don't need no buddy.

1324
01:55:39,307 --> 01:55:41,143
Here I come. Here I come.

1325
01:55:44,813 --> 01:55:46,523
<i>What's the trouble, corporal?</i>

1326
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:48,233
<i>There's a truck tailing us, sir.</i>

1327
01:55:51,403 --> 01:55:53,947
<i>It might be a farmer in a hurry to get someplace.</i>

1328
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:57,450
<i>Oh, fine.</i>

1329
01:55:57,534 --> 01:56:00,954
<i>-Well, take it as fast as you can.
- Yes, sir.</i>

1330
01:56:04,207 --> 01:56:05,584
That PCH?

1331
01:56:05,667 --> 01:56:08,712
Yeah, yeah. Malibu.

1332
01:56:08,795 --> 01:56:11,214
Puerco Canyon or some shit. I don't know.

1333
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:19,681
Here comes trouble.

1334
01:56:24,227 --> 01:56:26,271
Oh, man. Right in the face.

1335
01:56:38,074 --> 01:56:39,701
That was a smooth leap.

1336
01:56:39,784 --> 01:56:40,785
Thank you.

1337
01:56:44,748 --> 01:56:46,333
Dead number two.

1338
01:56:53,590 --> 01:56:55,383
I like that shot.

1339
01:56:55,467 --> 01:56:57,510
That guy's a fucking prick.

1340
01:57:04,476 --> 01:57:06,311
That's Bobby Hogan. Good guy.

1341
01:57:15,695 --> 01:57:18,031
All right, get ready for my big <i>F.B.I.</i> moment.

1342
01:57:18,114 --> 01:57:20,450
<i>-They're all dead, babe.

01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:30,460
"Michael Murtaugh."

1344
01:57:30,543 --> 01:57:32,420
- <i>The F.B.I.</i>
- Michael Murtaugh.

1345
01:57:32,504 --> 01:57:33,838
<i>Buongiorno,</i> Sergio.

1346
01:57:33,922 --> 01:57:35,715

Except when Rick Dalton's got a fucking shotgun,
I'll tell you that.

<i>After that Musso & Frank's lunch meeting,</i>

1361
01:58:38,403 --> 01:58:42,324
<i>Marvin did provide Rick job opportunities
in the Italian film industry.</i>

1362
01:58:42,407 --> 01:58:45,827
Rick Dalton, Marvin Schwarz here. Hold on.

1363
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:47,746
Hennessy X.O on the rocks.

1364
01:58:47,829 --> 01:58:49,331
Yes, Mr Schwarz.

1365
01:58:49,414 --> 01:58:50,623
Two words.

1366
01:58:50,707 --> 01:58:53,209
Nebraska Jim, Sergio Corbucci.

1367
01:58:53,293 --> 01:58:55,253
Nebraska what?

1368
01:58:55,337 --> 01:58:56,379
Sergio who?

1369
01:58:56,463 --> 01:58:58,048
<i>Sergio Corbucci.</i>

1370
01:58:58,131 --> 01:58:59,632
And who's that?

1371
01:58:59,716 --> 01:59:03,386
The second-best director of Spaghetti Westerns
in the whole wide world.

1372
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:06,848
He's doing a new Western. It's called <i>Nebraska Jim.</i>

1373
01:59:06,931 --> 01:59:09,434
And because of me, he's considering you.

1374
01:59:10,685 --> 01:59:12,437
<i>Well, Rick got</i> Nebraska Jim.

1375
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:14,939
<i>And Rick made a rather compelling Nebraska Jim,</i>

1376
01:59:15,023 --> 01:59:19,944
<i>existing quite nicely within Sergio Corbucci's
rogues gallery of anti heroes.</i>

1377
01:59:21,279 --> 01:59:24,449
<i>In Rome, Rick loved the paparazzi
and the fuss they made over him</i>

1378
01:59:24,532 --> 01:59:28,244
<i>and his</i> Nebraska Jim <i>costar Daphna Ben-Cobo.</i>

1379
01:59:28,328 --> 01:59:31,456
All right there, paparazzos. All right. Take it easy.

1380
01:59:31,956 --> 01:59:36,753
<i>He loved the food so much that during his stay,
Rick gained almost 15 pounds.</i>

1381
01:59:36,836 --> 01:59:39,881
<i>But he didn't love the Italians' way of making movies.</i>

1382
01:59:39,964 --> 01:59:43,259
<i>He thought the post-synced,
"every actor speaks their own language, "</i>

1383
01:59:43,343 --> 01:59:47,222
<i>Tower of Babel shooting style
of European movies was ridiculous.</i>

1384
01:59:48,264 --> 01:59:52,143
<i>While in Rome, Marvin plugged Rick
into three other Italian productions.</i>

1385
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:56,064
<i>His second Western was</i>
Kill Me Quick, Ringo, Said the Gringo,

1386
01:59:56,147 --> 01:59:59,859
<i>also starring Joseph Cotten
and directed by Calvin Jackson Padget,</i>

1387
01:59:59,943 --> 02:00:02,195
<i>pseudonym for Giorgio Ferroni.</i>

1388
02:00:02,278 --> 02:00:04,781
<i>His third was an Italian!Spanish coproduction</i>

1389
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:09,035
<i>that paired him with Telly Savalas,
titled</i> Red Blood, Red Skin,

1390
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:13,289
<i>directed by Joaquín Romero Marchent
and based on the Floyd Raye Wilson novel,</i>

1391
02:00:13,373 --> 02:00:16,042
The Only Good Indian Is a Dead Indian.

1392
02:00:16,793 --> 02:00:23,466
<i>And his fourth, a Spaghetti secret agent,
James Bond rip-off-type flick called</i> Operazione Dyn-O-Mite!,

1393
02:00:23,550 --> 02:00:25,218
<i>directed by Antonio Margheriti.</i>

1394
02:01:07,677 --> 02:01:11,431
<i>Ultimately making
Rick's six-month Italian sojourn fairly profitable,</i>

1395
02:01:11,514 --> 02:01:15,643
<i>although his swank Roman apartment ate up
a big chunk of his earnings.</i>

1396
02:01:17,353 --> 02:01:20,482
<i>So as Rick returns to Hollywood via Pan Am,</i>

1397
02:01:20,565 --> 02:01:24,027
<i>he has four new movies under his belt,
some money in his pocket,</i>

1398
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:29,199
<i>and his brand-spanking-new Italian wife,
starlet Francesca Cappucci.</i>

1399
02:01:31,993 --> 02:01:35,914
<i>Hurtling through the air towards a new life
and uncertain future,</i>

1400
02:01:35,997 --> 02:01:39,209
<i>Rick was really not sure about what lay ahead for him.</i>

1401
02:01:42,378 --> 02:01:46,257
<i>Way back in coach,
working on his bottomless Bloody Mary,</i>

1402
02:01:46,341 --> 02:01:49,344
<i>Cliff Booth returned to Los Angeles as well.</i>

1403
02:01:50,053 --> 02:01:54,557
<i>He kept Rick company
during his entire six-month stay in Italy.</i>

1404
02:01:55,350 --> 02:01:59,687
<i>However, as the two men return home,
they've come to an understanding.</i>

1405
02:01:59,771 --> 02:02:01,147
Well, here it goes now.

1406
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:03,691
With the...

1407
02:02:05,109 --> 02:02:06,611
With the new wife, I...

1408
02:02:07,987 --> 02:02:10,782
I just I can't afford you anymore, Cliff.

1409
02:02:11,241 --> 02:02:14,661
You know? I can barely afford my own house anymore.

1410
02:02:14,744 --> 02:02:17,455
So I think the plan is to sell the house

1411
02:02:17,539 --> 02:02:21,376
and buy a condo in Toluca Lake, bank the money.

1412
02:02:21,459 --> 02:02:23,545
You know, live <i>off</i> it. That type of thing.

1413
02:02:24,212 --> 02:02:27,131
Hopefully, I score come next pilot season.

1414
02:02:27,215 --> 02:02:28,424
That's a good plan.

1415
02:02:28,508 --> 02:02:29,551
Yeah.

1416
02:02:29,634 --> 02:02:30,593
You know,

1417
02:02:30,677 --> 02:02:33,096
by then, I'll know if I have a career or not,

1418
02:02:33,179 --> 02:02:37,100
if I'm a solid Los Angeles citizen like Eddie O'Brien says,

1419
02:02:37,183 --> 02:02:41,229
or if I'm one step closer to going back to Missouri.

1420
02:02:41,688 --> 02:02:44,899
So when this whole European journey is over,

1421
02:02:44,983 --> 02:02:46,192
I think we've...

1422
02:02:47,819 --> 02:02:50,321
We've reached the end of the trail, Cliff.

1423
02:03:01,374 --> 02:03:05,003
<i>So these last four Italian flicks, after nine years together,</i>

1424
02:03:05,086 --> 02:03:08,214
<i>would be Rick and Cliff's final rodeo.</i>

1425
02:03:08,298 --> 02:03:11,050
<i>Cliff doesn't have a clue what he's gonna do.</i>

1426
02:03:11,134 --> 02:03:13,303
<i>The only thing the two men know of for sure:</i>

1427
02:03:13,386 --> 02:03:17,015
<i>Tonight, Rick and Cliff will have a good old-fashioned drunk.</i>

1428
02:03:17,098 --> 02:03:20,268
<i>Both men know,
once the plane touches down in El Segundo,</i>

1429
02:03:20,351 --> 02:03:22,770
<i>it'll be the end of an era for both of them.</i>

1430
02:03:22,895 --> 02:03:27,900
<i>And when you come to the end of the line with a buddy
who is more than a brother and a little less than a wife,</i>

1431
02:03:27,984 --> 02:03:32,155
<i>getting blind drunk together is really
the only way to say farewell.</i>

1432
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:30,213
Here it is, honey.

1433
02:04:31,756 --> 02:04:33,257
- You like it?
- I love it.

1434
02:04:44,811 --> 02:04:46,062
Where do you want it?

1435
02:04:50,733 --> 02:04:51,776
<i>Hello?</i>

1436
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:53,444
Hey, it's Joanna and the baby.

1437
02:04:53,528 --> 02:04:55,196
<i>Hi! Come on up.</i>

1438
02:05:01,536 --> 02:05:02,578
Hi!

1439
02:05:02,662 --> 02:05:05,456
Oh, honey. How are you?

1440
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:07,792
- Oh, my gosh, you're about to pop!
- I know!

1441
02:05:07,875 --> 02:05:09,502
I know.

1442
02:05:09,585 --> 02:05:11,170
And this is the nursery.

1443
02:05:11,254 --> 02:05:13,923
- Oh, my God, Sharon. It's perfect.
- Do you love it?

1444
02:05:14,006 --> 02:05:15,258
Little shoes!

1445
02:05:15,341 --> 02:05:16,634
I know.

1446
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:20,221
I'm about to burst.

1447
02:05:20,304 --> 02:05:22,640
- I think you're gonna be a wonderful mother.
- Thank you.

1448
02:05:39,198 --> 02:05:40,950
- Thanks, Gillian.
- Bye!

1449
02:05:41,033 --> 02:05:42,452
Bye, Brandy!

1450
02:05:46,956 --> 02:05:52,754
<i>Sharon had two friends move into the Cielo Drive residence
while Roman was in London preparing his next movie:</i>

1451
02:05:52,837 --> 02:05:56,257
<i>Voytek Frykowski, an old friend of Roman's from Poland,</i>

1452
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:59,010
<i>and his girlfriend, social worker Abigail Folger,</i>

1453
02:05:59,093 --> 02:06:01,554
<i>heiress to the vast Folger coffee empire.</i>

1454
02:06:43,596 --> 02:06:47,225
<i>That night, Sharon, her two houseguests
and, naturally, Jay,</i>

1455
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:52,021
<i>all went to the West Hollywood Mexican restaurant landmark
El Coyote, on Beverly, for dinner.</i>

1456
02:06:56,776 --> 02:06:59,195
What's going on at the dirty movie place?

1457
02:06:59,278 --> 02:07:01,030
Oh, they're having a premiere.

1458
02:07:01,113 --> 02:07:02,782
Dirty movies have premieres?

1459
02:07:02,865 --> 02:07:04,575
Yeah. They're fun.

1460
02:07:05,284 --> 02:07:06,953
- This place is always so busy.
- I know.

1461
02:07:07,036 --> 02:07:08,496
It's crazy in here.

1462
02:07:14,001 --> 02:07:15,628
And right here for you.

1463
02:07:16,921 --> 02:07:18,923
- Gentlemen.
- Thanks.

1464
02:07:20,842 --> 02:07:22,969
<i>While closer to 8:</i><i>30, Rick and Cliff went</i>

1465
02:07:23,052 --> 02:07:26,931
<i>to the Valley Mexican restaurant landmark
Casa Vega on Ventura.</i>

1466
02:07:32,478 --> 02:07:33,813
Hello. Welcome.

1467
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:36,899
You're welcome, sir.

1468
02:07:47,785 --> 02:07:50,454
Well, well, well, if it ain't the cobra himself.

1469
02:07:50,538 --> 02:07:52,039
- Hey, Doug. What's happening?
- Hey, Rick.

1470
02:07:52,123 --> 02:07:54,625
- How you doing? It's good to see you.
- How's the wife doing?

1471
02:07:54,709 --> 02:07:57,420
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

1472
02:08:00,590 --> 02:08:02,466
<i>Brandy stayed behind at Rick's house,</i>

1473
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:05,219
<i>guarding the beautiful Italian woman asleep in her bed</i>

1474
02:08:05,303 --> 02:08:08,055
<i>and waiting for Cliff and Rick to come home...</i>

1475
02:08:09,390 --> 02:08:11,726
<i>while jet-lagged Francesca slept.</i>

1476
02:08:15,271 --> 02:08:16,731
But you just get paid for the day

1477
02:08:16,814 --> 02:08:18,524
- that you cut his hair, though, right?
- No, no, no.

1478
02:08:18,608 --> 02:08:20,401
I get paid $1000 a day.

1479
02:08:20,484 --> 02:08:22,653
I get paid $1000 the day I arrive.

1480
02:08:22,737 --> 02:08:24,572
- I get paid $1000...
- <i>At El Coyote,</i>

1481
02:08:24,655 --> 02:08:28,451
<i>margaritas and good times were had by all, except Sharon.</i>

1482
02:08:28,534 --> 02:08:32,246
<i>Sharon was experiencing
a touch of pregnancy-induced melancholy.</i>

1483
02:08:32,330 --> 02:08:36,250
<i>Not only that, it was later reported
that it was the hottest night of the year,</i>

1484
02:08:36,334 --> 02:08:39,420
<i>and it made her feel especially pregnant
in all the worst ways.</i>

1485
02:08:39,503 --> 02:08:42,006
I don't want to party anymore. I am tired.

1486
02:08:42,423 --> 02:08:44,050
Because he got it done.

1487
02:08:44,133 --> 02:08:46,886
No, it's not-- It's not because he just got it done.

1488
02:08:46,969 --> 02:08:50,139
He had just as much time
as all the rest of the goddamn directors.

1489
02:08:50,222 --> 02:08:52,600
But it's what he did with that time-- That's what counted.

1490
02:08:52,683 --> 02:08:55,102
<i>At Casa Vega, Rick and Cliff drank so much that,</i>

1491
02:08:55,186 --> 02:08:58,606
<i>when they left, they left the Cadillac there
and took a cab home.</i>

1492
02:08:58,689 --> 02:09:00,483
The greatest action director,

1493
02:09:00,566 --> 02:09:02,985
underrated guy of all time.

1494
02:09:04,028 --> 02:09:08,824
<i>Around 10, Sharon and her friends left El Coyote
and arrived back at her house.</i>

1495
02:09:16,916 --> 02:09:20,795
You've had, like, 19 margaritas.

1496
02:09:22,588 --> 02:09:26,968
<i>The four of them hung out a little while longer,
with Abigail even playing the piano for them...</i>

1497
02:09:27,051 --> 02:09:31,180
<i>Don't get me mad
Don't tell no lie</i>

1498
02:09:31,263 --> 02:09:36,227
<i>Don't make me sad
Don't pass me by</i>

<i>Baby, are you holding</i>

1500
02:09:41,399 --> 02:09:45,903
<i>Holding anything but me?</i>

1501
02:09:45,987 --> 02:09:51,450
<i>'Cause I'm a real straight shooter
if you know what I mean</i>

1502
02:09:52,827 --> 02:09:56,580
<i>You can bring me love
You can hang around</i>

1503
02:09:56,664 --> 02:09:58,582
<i>You can bring me up</i>

1504
02:09:58,666 --> 02:10:03,462
<i>Don't you bring me down</i>

1505
02:10:03,546 --> 02:10:07,383
<i>...until she returned to her room,
smoked a joint and read a book.</i>

1506
02:10:07,466 --> 02:10:09,135
<i>That was around 11.</i>

1507
02:10:28,362 --> 02:10:32,992
<i>At more or less the same time,
Voytek laid on the couch watching American television</i>

1508
02:10:33,075 --> 02:10:37,621
<i>and thought about how much better it was
than Polish television, as he smoked a big joint.</i>

<i>Somewhere around 11:</i><i>10,
Sharon changed into her comfy house attire.</i>

Feel better?

1511
02:10:45,296 --> 02:10:47,715
That is drastically better.

Thank you. Right here.

All right. <i>Grazie,</i> amigo.

02:11:00,311 --> 02:11:02,646
- How much do I owe you?
- Three dollars.

<i>Brandy was glad to see them return.</i>

1518

02:11:18,287 --> 02:11:20,664
<i>a blender of frozen margaritas.</i>

1522
02:11:23,417 --> 02:11:24,418
All right.

1523
02:11:26,170 --> 02:11:27,296
We're walking.

1524
02:11:27,379 --> 02:11:31,550
<i>At the same time, Cliff was attaching a leash
to an excited Brandy's dog collar.</i>

1525
02:11:31,634 --> 02:11:32,510
I know.

1526
02:11:38,182 --> 02:11:39,892
I remember you.

1527
02:11:40,351 --> 02:11:44,063
- A cigarette dipped in acid. What's that do?
- You smoke it. It gets you high.

1528
02:11:44,146 --> 02:11:46,232
- How much?
- Fifty cents.

1529
02:11:48,192 --> 02:11:49,276
Fifty cents.

1530
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:51,529
Hippie girl, 50 cents.

1531
02:11:55,199 --> 02:11:56,575
Tonight the night?

1532
02:11:58,035 --> 02:11:59,161
Why not?

1533
02:12:22,726 --> 02:12:25,187
And away we go.

1534
02:12:27,273 --> 02:12:31,569
Our Polish friend said it was the hottest day of the year.

1535
02:12:31,652 --> 02:12:35,406
Despite the fact that he said it, actually, it might be true.

1536
02:13:56,612 --> 02:13:57,655
Goddamn.

1537
02:13:58,781 --> 02:14:00,783
Fucking private road.

1538
02:14:00,866 --> 02:14:03,410
Damn property taxes up the butt.

1539
02:14:03,494 --> 02:14:04,787
Goddamn.

1540
02:14:12,127 --> 02:14:15,714
Bunch of goddamn fucking hippies.

1541
02:14:15,798 --> 02:14:18,217
What the fuck?

1542
02:14:21,262 --> 02:14:22,471
Hey, you!

1543
02:14:23,931 --> 02:14:27,101
Yeah, asshole, I'm talking to you!

1544
02:14:28,185 --> 02:14:31,230
What the hell do you think you're doing
bringing that noisy hunk of shit

1545
02:14:31,313 --> 02:14:33,399
around here at midnight?

1546
02:14:33,482 --> 02:14:36,193
This is a private road, all right?

1547
02:14:36,277 --> 02:14:38,862
Who are you? And who are you here to see?

1548
02:14:38,946 --> 02:14:41,657
Nobody, sir. We just got lost and a little turned around.

1549
02:14:41,740 --> 02:14:43,367
Horseshit.

1550
02:14:45,619 --> 02:14:49,581
You fucking hippies came up here
to smoke dope on a dark road, huh?

1551
02:14:49,665 --> 02:14:52,334
Next time you want to try that, fix your fucking muffler.

1552
02:14:52,418 --> 02:14:56,505
- Look, we're really sorry we disturbed you.
- Look, chief, you don't belong here.

1553
02:14:56,588 --> 02:15:01,552
Now, take this mechanical asshole
and get it off my fucking street!

1554
02:15:13,939 --> 02:15:14,773
Hey!

1555
02:15:15,524 --> 02:15:18,277
Dennis Hopper! Move this fucking piece of shit!

1556
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:20,779
All right. Just give me a moment to turn it around.

1557
02:15:20,863 --> 02:15:22,656
Drive it backwards, numbnuts,

1558
02:15:22,740 --> 02:15:26,410
- but fucking drive it, and drive it now!
- Okay. Okay. Stop yelling.

1559
02:15:26,493 --> 02:15:28,078
Hold your horses. We're leaving.

1560
02:15:31,915 --> 02:15:35,627
The hell are you looking at, you little ginger-haired fucker?

1561
02:15:35,711 --> 02:15:38,464
Hey, you come around here again,
I'm gonna call the fucking cops!

1562
02:15:45,304 --> 02:15:46,805
Dirty fucking hippies.

1563
02:16:00,444 --> 02:16:02,821
There in his fancy fucking house, thinking he's handled it.

1564
02:16:02,905 --> 02:16:05,949
But he's seen us. He's awake. He's alert.

1565
02:16:06,075 --> 02:16:10,913
They're all awake. They're listening to fucking records.
Everybody's fucking awake!

1566
02:16:10,996 --> 02:16:12,164
Look!

1567
02:16:12,247 --> 02:16:14,333
- What did Charlie say?
- He said:

1568
02:16:14,875 --> 02:16:18,504
"Go to Terry's old house and kill everybody in there."

1569
02:16:19,046 --> 02:16:22,758
And you heard him yourself. He said, "Make it witchy."

1570
02:16:22,841 --> 02:16:25,886
Now, he either said that,

1571
02:16:25,969 --> 02:16:27,805
or I'm a liar.

1572
02:16:29,056 --> 02:16:32,309
Now, are any one of you calling me a liar?

1573
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:36,438
How about you?

1574
02:16:36,980 --> 02:16:38,524
Are you calling me a liar?

1575
02:16:39,942 --> 02:16:42,069
No, of course not.

1576
02:16:42,152 --> 02:16:43,028
Good.

1577
02:16:43,112 --> 02:16:44,530
Hold it.

1578
02:16:44,613 --> 02:16:47,116
- Was that Rick Dalton?
- Who?

1579
02:16:47,199 --> 02:16:48,450
The guy from <i>Bounty Law.</i>

1580
02:16:48,534 --> 02:16:50,285
- Who, Jake Cahill?
- Yeah.

1581
02:16:50,369 --> 02:16:52,788
That guy in the robe was Jake Cahill.

1582
02:16:53,414 --> 02:16:56,583
Wait a minute. That was fucking Jake Cahill
that just yelled at me?

1583
02:16:57,042 --> 02:16:59,169
He was older, but, yeah, I think so.

1584
02:16:59,253 --> 02:17:02,339
- So who's this Rick guy?
- Jesus Christ, Sadie, get it together.

1585
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:05,717
Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill on a cowboy show
in the '50s called <i>Bounty Law.</i>

1586
02:17:06,176 --> 02:17:07,636
Fuck you, Katie.

1587
02:17:07,719 --> 02:17:11,014
Sorry I don't know the name
of every fascist on TV in the '50s.

1588
02:17:11,098 --> 02:17:15,602
I can't believe that asshole in the robe was Jake Cahill.

1589
02:17:15,686 --> 02:17:18,480
When I was a kid, I had a <i>Bounty Law</i> lunch box.

1590
02:17:18,564 --> 02:17:21,191
That was my favourite of all my lunch boxes.

1591
02:17:22,192 --> 02:17:24,945
Dig this!

1592
02:17:25,028 --> 02:17:29,783
When we've been having our trip sessions,
I've been expanding on this one idea in my head.

1593
02:17:29,867 --> 02:17:33,454
All right, dig it. We all grew up watching TV,
you know what I mean?

1594
02:17:34,955 --> 02:17:38,667
And if you grew up watching TV,
that means you grew up watching murder.

1595
02:17:39,626 --> 02:17:44,173
Every show on TV
that wasn't <i>I Love Lucy</i> was about murder.

1596
02:17:44,256 --> 02:17:47,342
So my idea is...

1597
02:17:47,426 --> 02:17:49,845
we kill the people who taught us to kill.

1598
02:17:51,847 --> 02:17:56,018
I mean, where the fuck are we, man?
We are in fucking Hollywood, man.

1599
02:17:56,101 --> 02:17:59,730
The people an entire generation grew up
watching kill people live here.

1600
02:17:59,813 --> 02:18:03,317
And they live in pig-shit fucking luxury. I say fuck them.

1601
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:05,319
I say we cut their cocks <i>off</i> and make them eat it.

1602
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:08,363
That's a great idea, Sadie.

1603
02:18:10,699 --> 02:18:12,493
You two ready to kill some piggies?

1604
02:18:21,919 --> 02:18:24,171
Wait a minute. Oh, shit.

1605
02:18:24,254 --> 02:18:28,592
Sorry, I forgot my knife in the car. Can I go--?
Can I go back and get it?

1606
02:18:29,676 --> 02:18:31,011
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

1607
02:18:31,094 --> 02:18:32,179
Go on. Wait a minute.

1608
02:18:32,262 --> 02:18:35,349
- What?
- I locked the car. You'll need keys to get in.

1609
02:18:39,645 --> 02:18:41,522
Right. Thank you.

1610
02:18:41,605 --> 02:18:44,274
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1611
02:18:44,358 --> 02:18:47,402
- Just hurry up.
- Yeah, just a little minute.

1612
02:18:57,579 --> 02:18:59,331
Oh, that fucking bitch!

1613
02:18:59,414 --> 02:19:02,251
Calm down. There's a fucking house right there.

1614
02:19:03,627 --> 02:19:06,213
- What do we do now?
- We do what we came to do.

1615
02:19:06,296 --> 02:19:08,423
And when we're done, we split up and hitch home.

1616
02:19:09,216 --> 02:19:10,551
Any more questions?

1617
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:16,557
Okay, pig killers, let's kill some piggies.

1618
02:19:17,057 --> 02:19:17,933
All right.

1619
02:19:30,571 --> 02:19:32,281
Oh, someone's hungry.

1620
02:19:41,123 --> 02:19:42,332
All right.

1621
02:19:44,167 --> 02:19:45,794
It's feeding time.

1622
02:19:49,047 --> 02:19:50,257
Brandy, couch.

1623
02:19:56,847 --> 02:19:58,307
And don't you mo--

1624
02:20:06,690 --> 02:20:08,025
Oh, man.

1625
02:20:17,743 --> 02:20:19,870
The train has left the station.

1626
02:20:26,710 --> 02:20:28,045
Bad idea.

1627
02:21:45,997 --> 02:21:47,374
<i>Eighty men died</i>

1628
02:21:49,251 --> 02:21:51,211
<i>On the countryside</i>

1629
02:21:51,586 --> 02:21:53,422
<i>Ten, 20, 30, 40</i>

1630
02:21:53,505 --> 02:21:55,006
<i>Fifty or more</i>

1631
02:21:55,090 --> 02:21:58,427
<i>The bloody Red Baron
Was rollin' up the score</i>

1632
02:22:17,446 --> 02:22:20,657
You go around there, see if there's a back entrance.

1633
02:22:20,741 --> 02:22:21,950
All right? Go.

1634
02:23:09,581 --> 02:23:10,957
Hey.

1635
02:23:13,919 --> 02:23:18,006
I am doing the best I can under the circumstances.

1636
02:23:18,089 --> 02:23:20,300
Now, I do not want to get into it tonight.

1637
02:23:30,977 --> 02:23:32,562
Can I help you?

1638
02:23:38,819 --> 02:23:39,945
Shit.

1639
02:23:41,238 --> 02:23:43,114
How many other people are here?

1640
02:23:43,198 --> 02:23:46,034
Oh, just the one sleeping in the back there.

1641
02:23:47,536 --> 02:23:49,746
Go get him and bring him into the living room.

1642
02:23:50,747 --> 02:23:53,208
- What if he says no?
- Don't take no for an answer.

1643
02:23:53,291 --> 02:23:55,460
You're the one with the knife. Get him in here!

1644
02:23:58,171 --> 02:23:59,089
Hey.

1645
02:24:05,053 --> 02:24:06,930
You are real, right?

1646
02:24:07,013 --> 02:24:09,683
I'm as real as a doughnut, motherfucker.

1647
02:24:19,526 --> 02:24:20,652
What the fuck?

1648
02:24:28,326 --> 02:24:31,079
- Go to the living room.
- What is going on, huh?

1649
02:24:36,042 --> 02:24:37,836
- Go!
- <i>Si, si.</i>

1650
02:24:40,088 --> 02:24:41,506
Who the fuck's that?

1651
02:24:41,590 --> 02:24:42,591
I don't know.

1652
02:24:43,884 --> 02:24:44,968
Francesca.

1653
02:24:54,436 --> 02:24:55,353
What--?

1654
02:24:56,396 --> 02:24:58,064
Oh, I know you.

1655
02:24:58,148 --> 02:24:59,983
I know all three of you.

1656
02:25:01,192 --> 02:25:03,153
Yeah. Spahn Ranch.

1657
02:25:03,862 --> 02:25:05,906
Spahn Ranch. Yeah.

1658
02:25:08,074 --> 02:25:11,536
I don't know your name, but I remember that hair.

1659
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:15,665
And you, I remember your white little face.

1660
02:25:15,749 --> 02:25:17,709
And you were on a horsie.

1661
02:25:18,209 --> 02:25:19,169
Yeah.

1662
02:25:21,296 --> 02:25:22,255
You are...?

1663
02:25:22,881 --> 02:25:24,758
I'm the devil,

1664
02:25:24,841 --> 02:25:27,677
and I'm here to do the devil's business.

1665
02:25:30,889 --> 02:25:34,559
Nah, it was dumber than that. Something like... Rex.

1666
02:25:34,643 --> 02:25:36,686
- God, shoot him, Tex!
- Tex.

1667
02:25:40,148 --> 02:25:41,316
Fuck!

1668
02:25:56,373 --> 02:25:57,874
Son of a bitch!

1669
02:26:36,371 --> 02:26:37,205
Hey, you.

1670
02:26:40,208 --> 02:26:42,419
How dare you come into my house, motherfucker!

1671
02:27:08,445 --> 02:27:10,238
Wow, man.

1672
02:28:03,291 --> 02:28:04,459
What the fuck?!

1673
02:28:05,919 --> 02:28:07,545
Jesus Christ.

1674
02:29:24,205 --> 02:29:25,707
Holy shit.

1675
02:29:28,668 --> 02:29:31,588
Francesca! Francesca, honey!

1676
02:29:51,357 --> 02:29:53,735
- <i>10,000 block, Cielo Drive.</i>
- Sir, around what time was it

1677
02:29:53,818 --> 02:29:55,820
when you confronted the intruder?

1678
02:29:55,904 --> 02:29:58,072
It was about midnight.

1679
02:29:58,156 --> 02:29:59,240
- Around midnight?
- Yeah.

1680
02:29:59,324 --> 02:30:00,825
How do you know it was midnight?

1681
02:30:00,909 --> 02:30:03,828
Well, I was in the kitchen.

1682
02:30:04,495 --> 02:30:06,915
You know, I was making margaritas, and...

1683
02:30:07,832 --> 02:30:11,377
I heard the sound of a noisy muffler. I looked up at the clock.

1684
02:30:11,461 --> 02:30:13,630
It said... The kitchen clock said midnight.

1685
02:30:13,713 --> 02:30:17,425
- Twelve o'clock exactly?
- I mean, it could have been 12:05.

1686
02:30:17,508 --> 02:30:19,677
- Something like that.
- And you didn't see them again

1687
02:30:19,761 --> 02:30:22,138
until the woman attacked you in the pool.

1688
02:30:22,222 --> 02:30:23,640
No, no.

1689
02:30:24,265 --> 02:30:26,351
So, what did these perpetrators do?

1690
02:30:26,434 --> 02:30:29,062
Perpetrators? They were hippie assholes.

1691
02:30:29,145 --> 02:30:32,649
Two of them burst through the front door there,

1692
02:30:32,732 --> 02:30:37,070
and the guy hippie said he was the devil.

1693
02:30:37,153 --> 02:30:39,906
And he said, "I'm here to...

1694
02:30:39,989 --> 02:30:42,158
do some devil shit."

1695
02:30:42,242 --> 02:30:44,869
Or... That's not verbatim, but...

1696
02:30:44,953 --> 02:30:47,789
- "Some devil shit"?
- Yeah, "devil shit."

1697
02:31:01,886 --> 02:31:04,013
And away we go.

1698
02:31:07,100 --> 02:31:09,269
Hey. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1699
02:31:09,352 --> 02:31:12,272
What hospital you going to, Cliff? I'll meet you there, huh?

1700
02:31:12,355 --> 02:31:14,899
You don't want to meet me in no hospital.

1701
02:31:14,983 --> 02:31:16,776
Why don't you go take care of your lady.

1702
02:31:16,859 --> 02:31:19,862
Hey, she just took five fucking sleeping pills.

1703
02:31:19,946 --> 02:31:21,906
She'll be asleep till Columbus Day.

1704
02:31:22,031 --> 02:31:25,451
These guys will probably have to come out here again
just to wake her ass up.

1705
02:31:25,535 --> 02:31:28,705
Hey, I'm not gonna die.
I may get a limp, but I ain't gonna die.

1706
02:31:28,788 --> 02:31:30,748
- It's not my time yet, man.
- All right.

1707
02:31:30,873 --> 02:31:36,462
So no use waiting in some waiting room.
Why don't you go lie naked with that fine creature.

1708
02:31:36,546 --> 02:31:38,089
Come visit me tomorrow.

1709
02:31:38,172 --> 02:31:39,549
Bring bagels.

1710
02:31:40,842 --> 02:31:42,969
You want to do something for me, check on Brandy.

1711
02:31:43,052 --> 02:31:46,055
She may be a little shook up after that.
She may want to sleep with you.

1712
02:31:46,139 --> 02:31:49,350
Are you kidding me?
She's sleeping with Francesca right now.

1713
02:31:49,434 --> 02:31:51,519
You might never get her back.

1714
02:31:51,602 --> 02:31:53,271
- We got to go.
- All right, then, Cliff.

1715
02:31:53,354 --> 02:31:55,773
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

1716
02:31:59,193 --> 02:32:00,820
Hey. Hey.

1717
02:32:04,657 --> 02:32:06,451
You're a good friend, Cliff.

1718
02:32:07,910 --> 02:32:09,120
I try.

1719
02:32:41,486 --> 02:32:42,445
Hello?

1720
02:32:44,447 --> 02:32:45,281
Hey.

1721
02:32:45,365 --> 02:32:48,159
I'm Jay Sebring. I'm a friend of the Polanskis.

1722
02:32:48,701 --> 02:32:51,287
You're Rick Dalton, right?

1723
02:32:51,371 --> 02:32:54,248
Yeah. Yeah. I'm Rick Dalton.

1724
02:32:55,041 --> 02:32:56,876
- Live next door.
- Oh, I know.

1725
02:32:56,959 --> 02:32:59,712
I tease Sharon that she lives next door to Jake Cahill.

1726
02:32:59,837 --> 02:33:03,591
If she ever wants to put a bounty on Roman's head,
she just has to go next door, right?

1727
02:33:05,301 --> 02:33:06,511
No shit.

1728
02:33:07,136 --> 02:33:09,514
What the fuck happened?

1729
02:33:09,597 --> 02:33:12,183
Oh, these fucking hippie weirdos,

1730
02:33:12,266 --> 02:33:14,560
they broke into my house.

1731
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:17,313
What do you mean, like, trying to rob you?

1732
02:33:17,397 --> 02:33:19,190
We don't know what the fuck they wanted.

1733
02:33:19,273 --> 02:33:23,319
Were they robbing me? I don't know.
Were they freaking out on some bummer trip?

1734
02:33:23,403 --> 02:33:26,739
Who knows? But they tried to kill my wife and my buddy.

1735
02:33:26,823 --> 02:33:30,243
- Jesus Christ. Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

1736
02:33:30,326 --> 02:33:34,038
Now, my buddy and his dog killed two of them, and then...

1737
02:33:34,122 --> 02:33:37,166
Well, shit. I torched the last one.

1738
02:33:37,250 --> 02:33:38,251
"Torched"?

1739
02:33:38,334 --> 02:33:41,587
Yeah. I burnt her ass to a crisp.

1740
02:33:41,671 --> 02:33:44,590
- How'd you do that?
- Well, believe it or not, I--

1741
02:33:44,674 --> 02:33:48,761
- I got a flamethrower in my tool shed.
- Oh, from <i>The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.</i>

1742
02:33:49,637 --> 02:33:51,431
Yeah!

1743
02:33:51,514 --> 02:33:53,015
Yeah. Yeah.

1744
02:33:53,099 --> 02:33:54,684
That's the one.

1745
02:33:54,767 --> 02:33:57,186
Yeah, it still works too. Thank God.

1746
02:33:58,104 --> 02:33:59,480
Is everybody okay?

1747
02:33:59,564 --> 02:34:03,943
Well, the fucking hippies aren't, that's for goddamn sure.

1748
02:34:04,026 --> 02:34:05,611
Yeah. But I'm fine.

1749
02:34:05,695 --> 02:34:07,447
You know, my wife's fine.

1750
02:34:07,530 --> 02:34:11,909
- We're just a little shook up, is all.
- Oh, my God, that's terrifying.

1751
02:34:12,660 --> 02:34:13,870
Yeah.

1752
02:34:13,953 --> 02:34:16,706
<i>Jay, honey, is everything all right?</i>

1753
02:34:16,789 --> 02:34:18,791
Everything's okay now, honey.

1754
02:34:18,875 --> 02:34:21,669
But some hippies broke into the house next door.

1755
02:34:21,752 --> 02:34:23,588
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1756
02:34:23,671 --> 02:34:25,673
<i>Oh, that's terrifying.</i>

1757
02:34:25,756 --> 02:34:27,300
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

1758
02:34:27,383 --> 02:34:31,304
I'm talking to your next-door neighbour about it right now.

1759
02:34:31,387 --> 02:34:32,889
<i>Rick Dalton?</i>

1760
02:34:34,557 --> 02:34:36,392
Yeah, that's me.

1761
02:34:38,060 --> 02:34:39,520
<i>Well, hello, neighbour.</i>

1762
02:34:40,521 --> 02:34:42,315
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

1763
02:34:42,398 --> 02:34:45,401
Yes, Sharon, everybody's fine.

1764
02:34:45,485 --> 02:34:46,986
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1765
02:34:49,155 --> 02:34:51,365
Well, yes, I am. Thank you for asking that.

1766
02:34:52,450 --> 02:34:56,412
<i>Rick, would you like to come up to the house
for a drink and meet my other friends?</i>

1767
02:35:02,919 --> 02:35:05,004
Yeah, sure.

1768
02:35:05,087 --> 02:35:06,005
Thank you.

1769
02:35:07,256 --> 02:35:08,966
<i>Great. I'll buzz you up.</i>

1770
02:35:20,937 --> 02:35:22,104
Come on.

1771
02:35:25,191 --> 02:35:27,401
- Hey, nice to meet you, huh?
- Yeah.

1772
02:35:27,485 --> 02:35:28,945
- Jay Sebring.
- Hey, pleasure.

1773
02:35:29,028 --> 02:35:31,280
- Yeah.
- Pleasure, Jay. Pleasure's all mine.

1774
02:35:31,364 --> 02:35:33,616
Sounds like you had a hell of a night.

1775
02:38:52,273 --> 02:38:56,694
Hi. This is Rick Dalton,
better known as bounty hunter Jake Cahill,

1776
02:38:56,777 --> 02:39:00,239
speaking on behalf of Red Apple cigarettes.

1777
02:39:00,322 --> 02:39:03,492
Now, I smoke Red Apples. Been smoking them for years.

1778
02:39:03,576 --> 02:39:08,539
But since the Red Apple tobacco company's
been around since 1862,

1779
02:39:08,622 --> 02:39:11,876
<i>you'll see Jake Cahill smoke Red Apple too.</i>

1780
02:39:12,209 --> 02:39:17,089
<i>Now, back in Jake's day, Red Apple came in a pouch,
and he had to roll his own.</i>

1781
02:39:17,173 --> 02:39:20,134
But today, Red Apple comes factory-rolled.

1782
02:39:20,217 --> 02:39:23,846
For the best drag with the best tobacco flavour,

1783
02:39:23,929 --> 02:39:28,559
with less burn on your throat
than any other non-filtered cigarette.

1784
02:39:37,860 --> 02:39:40,529
Now, that's the way a cigarette should taste.

1785
02:39:41,530 --> 02:39:44,408
Better drag, more flavour,

1786
02:39:44,492 --> 02:39:45,993
less throat burn.

1787
02:39:48,287 --> 02:39:50,039
That's the Red Apple way.

1788
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:54,752
So, look for this life-size standee of me, Jake Cahill,

1789
02:39:54,835 --> 02:39:58,464
wherever fine Red Apple tobacco products are sold.

1790
02:39:58,547 --> 02:40:01,801
Take a bite and feel all right.

1791
02:40:01,884 --> 02:40:05,221
Take a bite of a Red Apple.

1792
02:40:05,304 --> 02:40:06,806
Tell them Jake sent you.

1793
02:40:10,309 --> 02:40:12,853
- And cut.
- This cigarette tastes like fucking shit.

1794
02:40:12,937 --> 02:40:16,232
And, by the way, who chose this photo?
I have a double chin. All right?

1795
02:40:16,315 --> 02:40:17,983
Nobody notices that crap?
