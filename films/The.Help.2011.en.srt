1
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,462
I was born 1911, Chickasaw County,
Piedmont Plantation.

2
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,509
And did you know, as a girl growing up,
that one day you'd be a maid?

3
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,970
Yes, ma'am, I did.

4
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,638
And you knew that because...

5
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,310
My mama was a maid.
My grand mama was a house slave.

6
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,481
House... slave.

7
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,611
Do you ever dream
of being something else?

8
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,784
What does it feel like
to raise a white child

9
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,746
when your own child's at home being
looked after by somebody else?

10
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,083
It feel...

11
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,848
<i>I done raised 17 kids in my life.</i>

12
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,310
<i>Looking after white babies,
that's what I do.</i>

13
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,396
Aibee, Aibee.

14
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,607
- Hi!
- Aibee!

15
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:32,861
<i>I know how to get them babies to sleep,
stop crying and go in the toilet bowl</i>

16
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,197
<i>before their mamas even
get out of bed in the morning.</i>

17
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,659
<i>Babies like fat.</i>

18
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,787
<i>They like big fat legs, too.
That I know.</i>

19
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:46,291
You is kind, you is smart...

20
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,710
...you is important.

21
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,338
- You is smart...
- Smart...

22
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,049
- ...you is kind...
- ...you is kind...

23
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:57,052
- ...you is important.
- ...you is important.

24
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,346
That's so good.

25
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,433
That's so good.

26
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,356
<i>I work for the Leefolts
from eight to four, six days a week.</i>

27
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:15,237
<i>I make 95 cent an hour.
That comes to $182 every month.</i>

28
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:21,827
<i>I do all the cooking, cleaning, washing,
ironing and grocery shopping.</i>

29
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,625
<i>But mostly, I take care of Baby Girl.</i>

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,087
<i>And, Lord, I worry
she gonna be fat.</i>

31
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,756
Mae Mobley.

32
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,050
<i>Ain't going to be
no beauty queen either.</i>

33
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,846
Aibileen, bridge club is in an hour.
Did you finish the chicken salad?

34
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,850
- Yes.
- And Hilly's devil led eggs. No paprika.

35
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,812
Does this dress look homemade?

36
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,150
I reckon when you finish it won't.

37
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,736
Well, thank you.

38
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,906
<i>Miss Leefolt still don't
pick Baby Girl up but once a day.</i>

39
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,452
<i>The birthing blues got hold
of Miss Leefolt pretty hard.</i>

40
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,912
<i>I done seen it happen plenty of times,</i>

41
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,415
<i>once babies start having
their own babies.</i>

42
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,303
<i>And the young white ladies of Jackson...</i>

43
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,097
<i>...oh Lord, was they having babies.</i>

44
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,057
<i>But not Miss Skeeter.</i>

45
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,060
<i>No man and no babies.</i>

46
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,095
- Morning.
- Hi.

47
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,348
- My name is Eugenia Phelan, and...
- Come on.

48
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,068
Eugenia Phelan, Mr Blackly.

49
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,113
Shut the damn door.

50
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,742
I guarantee you, one day they're going
to figure out cigarettes will kill you.

51
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,286
OK, Miss Phelan,
let's see what you got.

52
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,543
Murrah High: editor.

53
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,587
Ole Miss <i>Rebel Rouser</i> editor.

54
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,880
Double major.

55
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,049
Junior League: editor.

56
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,053
- Damn, girl, don't you have fun?
- Is that important?

57
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,514
- Do you have any references?
- Yes.

58
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,184
Right here.

59
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,147
This...

60
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,024
This is a rejection letter.

61
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,735
Not exactly. See, Miss Stein thought...

62
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,571
Stein?

63
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,282
Elaine Stein, from Harper and Row
Publishing in New York.

64
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,533
Oh, Lord.

65
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,410
I'm gonna be a serious writer,
Mr Blackly.

66
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,122
I applied for a job,
but Mrs Stein thought...

67
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,832
She said no.

68
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,917
Well, until I gain some experience.

69
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,419
See? Says right there.

70
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:21,131
"Great potential. Gain some experience
and please apply again."

71
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,428
Oh, Christ. I guess you'll do.
Do you clean?

72
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,972
- I'm sorry. Clean?
- Clean.

73
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,515
Grab that basket.

74
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,478
Miss Myrna has gone
shit-house crazy on us.

75
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,106
She drunk hair spray or something.

76
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,525
I want you to read her past columns.

77
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,361
Then read these letters and you
answer them just like she would.

78
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,947
Nobody is gonna know
the damn difference.

79
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,116
You know who Miss Myrna is?

80
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,535
I read her articles all the time.

81
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,997
Articles? Miss Phelan,
it's a cleaning advice column.

82
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,417
Eight bucks a week.
Copy is due on Thursday.

83
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,961
Hello?

84
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,799
Lou Ann, honey, I can't talk right now.
I'm at work.

85
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,345
What? Shut that goddamn door.

86
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,029
Mama, we're late for bridge!

87
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,740
<i>Miss Hilly was the first of the babies
to have a baby.</i>

88
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,450
...three...

89
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,328
<i>And it must have come out of her like
the 11th Commandment,</i>

90
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,747
<i>'cause once Miss Hilly had a baby,</i>

91
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,792
<i>every girl at the bridge table
had to have one, too.</i>

92
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,378
Minny, go get Mama!

93
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,427
Missus Walters,
you need help coming down?

94
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,054
I'm down.

95
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,807
- I been down.
- Give me a heart attack.

96
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,893
Missus Walters.
Here, let me help you.

97
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,021
Take that <i>off.</i>
It's 98 degrees out there.

98
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,648
- Is it?
- Yes, ma'am.

99
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,483
Well, let's put my coat on then.

100
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,694
- Come on, Minny.
- All right.

101
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,320
- Here's your pocketbook.
- Thank you.

102
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,114
OK, let me get the pie.

103
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,741
Hold on, Missus Walters. Hold on.

104
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,998
<i>Once Missus Walters' arteries went hard,
Miss Hilly moved her into her house</i>

105
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,792
<i>and fired the maid she had
to make room for Minny, too.</i>

106
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,921
<i>See, Minny about the best cook
in Mississippi,</i>

107
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,673
<i>and Miss Hilly wanted her.</i>

108
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,387
<i>I lost my own boy, Treelore,
four years ago.</i>

109
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,016
<i>After that, I just didn't want
to live no more.</i>

110
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,936
<i>It took God and Minny
to get me through it.</i>

111
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:45,442
<i>Minny my best friend.
Old lady like me lucky to have her.</i>

112
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,576
<i>After my boy died, a bitter seed
was planted inside of me.</i>

113
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,538
<i>And I just didn't feel
so accepting anymore.</i>

114
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,219
No.

115
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,723
You drunk up two glasses of grape juice.
I know you got to tee-tee.

116
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,891
No.

117
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,268
I'll give you two cookies if you go.

118
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,858
Mae Mobley, you're going!

119
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,236
Aibileen, the girls are pulling up,
and the table isn't set.

120
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,906
Mae Mobley go, Mama.

121
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,241
Get in your room right now.

122
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,995
Set out the dessert forks. Please.

123
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,418
Put Mama in a chair
before she breaks a hip.

124
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,545
I'm not deaf yet, Hilly.

125
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,172
Hey, girls.

126
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,678
Minny. Will you see if Aibileen
has some of that ambrosia?

127
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,103
Hold on. Those are Miss Hilly's.

128
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,523
She looks like the winning horse
at the Kentucky Derby.

129
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,233
All flowers and bows.

130
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,360
Got to have paprika on them.

131
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,156
Forgive me, Lord, but I'm gonna have
to kill that woman, Aibileen.

132
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,660
Now she gone to putting pencil marks
on my toilet paper.

133
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,578
Did she?

134
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,916
But I carry paper in from my own
damn house. That fool don't know.

135
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,921
Miss Leefolt got so much hairspray
on her head

136
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,298
she gonna blow us all up
if she light a cigarette.

137
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,301
And you know she will!

138
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,144
- You got some ambrosia?
- You know I do.

139
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,854
All right, I'll be back.

140
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,981
Minny, cord, girl.

141
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,066
Shut up.

142
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,403
The Guiding Light.

143
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,324
Hi, Missus Walters.

144
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,827
I'm watching my story.

145
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,745
OK.

146
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,747
Isn't it gorgeous?

147
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,457
Sorry I'm late.

148
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,128
You're home!

149
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,380
I missed you all, too.

150
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:18,011
Well, if it isn't "Long Haul" Skeeter.

151
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,388
We didn't ever think
you'd leave Ole Miss.

152
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,891
Well, it does take four years, Jolene.

153
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,812
I've got a great summer planned for you.

154
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,189
Great.

155
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,483
I went ahead and I picked up my black
dress from the cleaners this morning.

156
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,404
What?

157
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,824
- About supper club tonight.
- What?

158
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,786
Honey, Stuart had to cancel.

159
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,330
Again?

160
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,208
He got held up on the oil rig, Skeeter.

161
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,668
It's offshore.

162
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,631
I'm starting to think this Stuart
is a figment of your imagination,

163
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,049
so just forget it.

164
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,343
I'm just gonna go get a plate.

165
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,470
Sorry!

166
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,770
I got a job today.

167
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,482
At <i>The Jackson Journal.</i>

168
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,986
They'd be a fool not to hire you.

169
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,365
To Skeeter and her job.

170
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,283
Last stop till marriage.

171
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,916
It's for the <i>Miss Myrna</i> column.

172
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,168
Elizabeth, can I talk to Aibileen?

173
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,089
Just to help me with some of the letters
till I get a knack for it.

174
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,008
My Aibileen?

175
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,345
Why can't you just
get Constantine to help?

176
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,352
Constantine quit us.

177
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,689
Oh, my gosh. Skeeter, I'm so sorry.

178
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:57,110
Anyway, I just... I don't really know
how to answer these letters.

179
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,572
Well, I mean, as long as it doesn't
interfere with her work.

180
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,574
I don't see why not.

181
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,792
Leefolt residence.

182
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,919
Hello. Is Elizabeth in?

183
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,547
She having bridge club right now.
May I take a message?

184
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,592
Yes, please tell her Celia Foote
called again.

185
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,470
I'll call back tomorrow.

186
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,722
Yes, ma'am.

187
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,766
<i>Miss?</i>

188
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:33,271
I'm looking for some help at my house.
Do you know any maids looking?

189
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,605
No, ma'am.

190
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,275
<i>OK. It's Celia Foote.</i>

191
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:41,112
Emerson-684. Bye now.

192
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,704
You scared the daylights out of me!

193
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,042
It is lunchtime,
and I am suddenly hungry.

194
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,589
Honestly!

195
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,056
I'm still working on it, Aibileen.

196
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,977
Who was that on the phone?

197
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,229
Miss Celia Foote called again.

198
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,441
I've never called her back, Hilly.

199
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,236
She can't take a hint, can she?

200
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,988
Who's Celia Foote?

201
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,157
That tacky girl Johnny married.

202
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,159
From Sugar Ditch.

203
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,869
It could have been you, Hilly.

204
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:34,248
And live 30 minutes outside of town?
No, thank you.

205
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:40,630
Anyway, I ran into her at the beauty
parlour, and she had the nerve to ask

206
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,673
if she could help with
the Children's Benefit Ball.

207
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,010
Aren't we taking non-members?
The benefit has gotten so big.

208
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:49,347
Yes, but we're not telling her.

209
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,684
Thank you, Aibileen.

210
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,858
Hilly, I wish you'd just
go use the bathroom.

211
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,527
I'm fine.

212
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,445
Oh, she's just upset

213
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,365
because the nigra uses the guest bath
and so do we.

214
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,995
Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley.

215
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,247
Yes, ma'am.

216
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,125
Just go use mine and Raleigh's.

217
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,962
If Aibileen uses the guest bath,
I'm sure she uses yours, too.

218
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,463
She does not.

219
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,592
Wouldn't you rather them
take their business outside?

220
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,847
Have you all seen the cover
of <i>Life</i> this week?

221
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,390
Jackie's never looked more regal.

222
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,351
Tell Raleigh every penny he spends
on a colour's bathroom

223
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,354
he'll get back in spades
when y'all sell.

224
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:43,901
It's just plain dangerous. They carry
different diseases than we do.

225
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:45,862
Pass.

226
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,157
That's why I've drafted
the Home Health Sanitation Initiative.

227
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,616
The what?

228
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,702
A disease-preventative bill

229
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:57,290
that requires every white home to have a
separate bathroom for the coloured help.

230
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,501
It's been endorsed
by the White Citizens' Council.

231
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,508
Maybe we should just build you
a bathroom outside, Hilly.

232
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,179
You ought not to joke
about the coloured situation.

233
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,183
I'll do whatever it takes
to protect our children.

234
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,061
Your lead, Elizabeth.

235
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,200
- Aibileen?
- Yes, ma'am.

236
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,288
Do you think you'd be willing to help me
with those <i>Miss Myrna</i> letters?

237
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,001
Miss Myrna get it wrong a lot of times.
Be good to get it right.

238
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,130
Thank you, Aibileen.

239
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,134
All that talk in there today...

240
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,803
Hilly's talk?

241
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,556
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

242
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,734
Is that Preacher Green's sermon?

243
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,986
Yes, ma'am, it is.

244
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,073
That reminds me so much of my maid,
Constantine.

245
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,744
I know Constantine.
We're in church circle together.

246
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,704
Have you seen her lately?

247
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,290
No, ma'am.

248
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,000
Did you know that she had quit us?

249
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,168
Quit?

250
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,630
I got home from school a week ago,
and my mama told me she had quit.

251
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:31,592
Back in March, she went to live with
her daughter, Rachel. In Chicago.

252
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,762
Did you hear that?
Do you have her phone number?

253
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,014
There you are, Skeeter.

254
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,519
Hilly wants you to put her initiative
in the League newsletter.

255
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,687
OK.

256
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,856
I'll be back tomorrow, Aibileen,

257
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,609
to get started on those
<i>Miss Myrna</i> letters.

258
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,944
Y'all make it quick.

259
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,446
Tomorrow is silver-polishing day. OK?

260
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,883
Hi, Jameso.

261
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,302
How you, Miss Eugenia?

262
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,388
Mama?

263
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,810
Mama.

264
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,158
Mama?

265
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,534
Back here, honey!

266
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,458
Is this a little too young?

267
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,127
That's a little too everything.

268
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,213
Oh, hell. You're right.

269
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:07,980
OK.

270
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,068
Much better.

271
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,446
Your daddy bought me this dress in '58.

272
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,032
Mama, I want to ask you
about Constantine.

273
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,910
Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar Bowl.
Come on. You try it on.

274
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,203
What really happened?

275
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,289
Skeeter, your mother is sick.
She wants to see you in this dress.

276
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,457
Unzip me.

277
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,168
Come on.

278
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,048
Did I tell you Fanny Peatrow
got engaged?

279
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,926
After she got that teller job,

280
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,136
her mother said she was swimming
in proposals.

281
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,180
Good for fair Fanny Peatrow.

282
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,600
Eugenia, your eggs are dying.
Would it kill you to go on a date?

283
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:49,438
Just show a little gumption.
Careful now, careful.

284
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,899
Oh, now look at this.

285
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,820
This dress is just precious on you.

286
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,990
Just take it in a little here.
Little there.

287
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,121
- Get your hair fixed.
- I got a job today.

288
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,288
Where?

289
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,041
Writing for <i>The Jackson Journal.</i>

290
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,670
Great.

291
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,589
You can write my obituary!

292
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,885
"Charlotte Phelan, dead!
Her daughter, still single."

293
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,555
Mother, would it really be so bad
if I never met a husband?

294
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,474
Skeeter! Skeeter!

295
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,935
Skeeter!

296
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,024
I need to ask you something.

297
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,783
I read the other day about how
some girls get unbalanced.

298
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,785
They start thinking these...

299
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,456
...unnatural thoughts.

300
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,957
Are you...

301
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:56,547
Do you... find men attractive?

302
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:01,927
Are you having unnatural thoughts
about girls or women?

303
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,764
Oh, my God.

304
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,602
Because this article says there's
a cure. A special root tea!

305
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:15,149
Mother, I want to be with girls as much
as you want to be with Jameso.

306
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,693
- Eugenia!
- Unless, of course, you do!

307
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:24,617
Carlton's bringing Rebecca to dinner.
Try to look presentable!

308
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,081
What the hell you know
about cleaning a house, Skeeter?

309
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,959
It's a start, Carlton.

310
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,588
If you say so.
I thought you wanted to write books.

311
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,841
Now, y'all leave Sister alone.

312
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,886
- I'm proud of you, sweetheart.
- The irony of it all.

313
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,347
Giving advice on how to keep up a home
when she doesn't even...

314
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,934
No, Pascagoula. You couldn't have known
this, but I'm allergic to almonds.

315
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,269
Sorry, Miss Eugenia,
I'll get you another one.

316
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,523
You know, last time I had an almond,
I stopped liking men.

317
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,233
Oh, my Lord.

318
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,153
Oh, no, Rebecca, it's fine. There's
a special root tea for that now.

319
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,655
You have pushed it, young lady.

320
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,492
Daddy. What happened to Constantine?

321
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,953
Well...

322
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:13,040
Constantine went to live in Chicago
with her family.

323
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,709
People move on, Skeeter.

324
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,254
But I do wish that she'd
stayed down here with us.

325
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,969
I don't believe you.

326
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,181
She would've written and told me.

327
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,150
Did you fire her?

328
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,947
We were just a job to her, honey.
With them, it's all about money.

329
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:48,617
You'll understand that once you've
hired help of your own.

330
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,246
- She raised me.
- She did not!

331
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,999
She worked here for 29 years!

332
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,042
It was a coloured thing
and I put it behind me!

333
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,922
Excuse me a moment, Rebecca. My daughter
has upset my cancerous ulcers.

334
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:31,922
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

335
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,096
What you doing hiding out here, girl?

336
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:56,143
I couldn't tell Mama I didn't
get asked to the dance.

337
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,436
It's all right.

338
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:02,149
Some things we just got to
keep to ourselves, right?

339
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,069
All the boys say I'm ugly.

340
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:11,033
Mama was third runner-up in
the Miss South Carolina pageant.

341
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,870
I wish you'd quit
feeling sorry for yourself.

342
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,164
Now, that's ugly.

343
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,752
Ugly is something that
goes up inside you.

344
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,381
It's mean and hurtful, like them boys.

345
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,509
Now you're not one of them, is you?

346
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,470
I didn't think so, honey.

347
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:37,685
Every day...

348
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,481
Every day you're not
dead in the ground,

349
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:47,236
when you wake up in the morning, you're
gonna have to make some decisions.

350
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:51,115
Got to ask yourself this question:

351
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,409
"Am I gonna believe

352
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:58,247
all them bad things them fools
say about me today?"

353
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,291
You hear me?

354
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,586
"Am I gonna believe all them bad things

355
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,256
them fools say about me today?"

356
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,260
All right?

357
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:18,267
As for your mama,
she didn't pick her life.

358
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,061
It picked her.

359
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,982
But you...

360
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:31,405
...you're gonna do
something big with yours.

361
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,116
You wait and see.

362
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,455
Come on, go home with me
till the dance over. Come on.

363
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,771
Miss Stein, you said in your letter
to write about what disturbs me,

364
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,230
particularly if it bothers no one else.

365
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,398
Come on.

366
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,358
<i>And I understand that now.</i>

367
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:10,944
Continue.

368
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,740
I'd like to write something
from the point of view of the help.

369
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,827
These coloured women
raise white children,

370
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,289
and in 20 years,
those children become the boss.

371
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,167
<i>We love them and they love us,</i>

372
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,628
<i>but they can't even use the toilets
in our houses.</i>

373
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,379
<i>Don't you find that ironic, Miss Stein?</i>

374
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,547
I'm listening.

375
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,676
Margaret Mitchell glorified
the mammy figure,

376
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,721
<i>who dedicates her whole life
to a white family.</i>

377
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,266
But nobody ever asked Mammy
how she felt about it.

378
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,186
So, a side to this never before heard?

379
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,271
Yes.

380
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,274
'Cause nobody ever really
talks about it down here.

381
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,904
Skeeter, who are you
talking to in there?

382
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,281
Go away!

383
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,871
- Who was that?
- My mother.

384
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,581
Look.

385
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,210
No maid in her right mind is ever gonna
tell you the truth.

386
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,922
That's a hell of a risk to take in
a place like Jackson, Mississippi.

387
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,465
I already have a maid.

388
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,971
Really? A Negro maid has already agreed
to speak with you?

389
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,348
Yes, ma'am.

390
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,188
I guess I can read
what you come up with.

391
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,524
<i>The book biz could use
a little rattling.</i>

392
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,067
Thank you, Miss Stein.

393
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,986
Hey, hey, hey, all I'm saying

394
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,114
is that I'll let you know
if it's even worth pursuing.

395
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,701
<i>And for God's sake, you're
a 23-year-old educated woman.</i>

396
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,036
Go get yourself an apartment.

397
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,042
<i>"Dear Miss Myrna:</i>

398
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,671
When I'm chopping onions, how do I
keep tears out of my eyes?"

399
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,425
Shoot, that's easy. You tell her
hold a matchstick between her teeth.

400
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,428
Is it lit?

401
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,221
No, ma'am.

402
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,602
Miss Leefolt said you could start
right away.

403
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:11,190
Build it just like the bathroom
at my house. Let's see.

404
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:15,527
- Right there. That will be nice.
- Yes, ma'am.

405
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,368
My goodness, we got to run back
to the car. Come on.

406
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,287
Bye, Skeeter!

407
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,459
Aibileen.

408
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:34,254
There's something else I want to
write about. I would need your help.

409
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,511
I want to interview you about
what it's like to work as a maid.

410
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,598
I'd like to do a book of interviews
about working for white families.

411
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:49,519
And we could show what it's like
to work for, say, Elizabeth?

412
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,940
You know what Miss Leefolt do to me if
she knew I was telling stories on her?

413
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,235
I was thinking that we wouldn't
have to tell her.

414
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,279
The other maids would have
to keep it a secret, too.

415
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,781
Other maids?

416
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,743
I was hoping to get four or five.

417
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,289
To show what it's really like
in Jackson.

418
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:17,297
Show what y'all get paid,
and the babies and the bathrooms.

419
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,675
The good and the bad.

420
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,219
I bought you this damn house.
I put up with your new clothes

421
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,930
and trips to New Orleans,
but this takes the goddamn cake.

422
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,306
Hilly spoke to the surgeon general,

423
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,184
and she also said it'll add value
to our home.

424
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,187
I guess Mae Mobley can go to college
in that damn bathroom!

425
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,605
Hilly's covering the cost and said

426
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,607
you could just do William's taxes
to pay her back.

427
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,818
We don't take orders
from the Holbrooks.

428
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,614
Skeeter, how you doing?

429
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,075
Fine.

430
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,998
Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen.

431
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,586
Aibileen, Mae Mobley's
crying her eyes out.

432
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,426
Skeeter.

433
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,929
I'm sorry, but I think it's best
if you leave now.

434
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,889
Oh, sure, sure.

435
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,810
And this <i>Miss Myrna</i> thing isn't going
to work out with Aibileen.

436
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,730
I'm sorry.

437
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,869
You're making it hotter,
flapping your arms like that, Minny.

438
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,547
Look how big the waves are, Minny.

439
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,594
Let's go to the beach.
Run, get Mr Walters!

440
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,471
He loves riding these waves!

441
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,931
You know we went to Biloxi
on our honeymoon?

442
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,558
Yes, ma'am.

443
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,395
Are we in Biloxi, Minny?

444
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,566
No, ma'am. We ain't.

445
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,907
Why don't you sit down here for a spell.

446
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:12,871
And then me and you will go on down
to the beach in a little while.

447
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,373
How about that?

448
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,305
Miss Hilly?

449
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,769
Never mind.

450
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,814
You go on ahead and use
the inside bath, Minny, it's all right.

451
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,900
Oh, for crying out loud,
it's just a little rain.

452
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:46,029
She can go on up and get an umbrella
from William's study.

453
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:50,033
I believe she was working for me
before you dragged us both here.

454
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,789
Daddy ruined you.

455
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,128
I'm just gonna get your tea.

456
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,324
Minny?

457
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,369
Minny, are you in there?

458
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,747
Yes, ma'am.

459
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,834
And just what are you doing?

460
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,427
Get off my toilet!

461
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,185
You are fired, Minny Jackson!

462
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,740
Go on!

463
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,919
<i>Eighteen people died in Jackson
that day.</i>

464
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,172
<i>Ten white and eight black.</i>

465
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:35,639
<i>God don't pay no mind to colour once
He decides to set a tornado loose.</i>

466
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,725
Aibee's here, honey.

467
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,435
Aibee's here.

468
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:05,418
Hurry, Aibileen! Mae Mobley is up,
and I'm off to the doctor!

469
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,553
That's Aibee's bathroom, Mama.
Hey, Aibee!

470
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,430
No, no, no, honey.
Promise me you won't go in there, OK?

471
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,598
Yes, ma'am.

472
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,684
I'm right here, Baby Girl.

473
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,105
Isn't it so nice
to have your own, Aibileen?

474
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,398
Yes, ma'am.

475
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,417
You're my real mama, Aibee.

476
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,278
- Is that Minny?
- Minny.

477
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,864
Hey, Aibileen!

478
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:17,699
Hey, Minny!

479
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:20,910
Where you headed?

480
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,332
I got some business to tend to,
so y'all just mind your own.

481
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,959
All right, then. Well, bye!

482
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,919
Bye!

483
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,756
Now is she mad at me 'cause I got
that job at Miss Hilly's?

484
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,592
Don't worry about her.
She always mad about something.

485
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,054
Aibileen.

486
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,643
Yes, ma'am. Everything OK?

487
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,936
Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you.

488
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,148
You got some more
<i>Miss Myrna</i> questions for me?

489
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,400
Oh, no, I just wanted to talk about...

490
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,281
We never finished our conversation
at Elizabeth's.

491
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,659
About that book I want to write?

492
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,385
I'd really like
to interview you, Aibileen.

493
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,679
I know it's scary.

494
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,644
They set my cousin
Shinelle's car on fire,

495
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,854
just 'cause she went down
to the voting station.

496
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,273
A book like this has never
been written before.

497
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,109
'Cause there's a reason.

498
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,112
I do this with you, I might as well
burn my own house down.

499
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,571
I promise we'll be careful.

500
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,199
This already ain't careful,
Miss Skeeter!

501
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,165
You not knowing that is what's
scaring me the most.

502
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,418
Scare me more than Jim Crow.

503
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,463
All right.

504
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,882
Here's my phone number.

505
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,806
- My car's here. I could take you home.
- No, ma'am.

Hello?

515
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,532
Aibileen, I done went and did it now.

516
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,619
I went to Miss Hilly's house
this afternoon.

517
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,287
<i>Why, Minny?</i>

518
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,749
<i>She done told every white woman
in town I'm a thief.</i>

519
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,376
Said I stole a candelabra.

520
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,172
But I got her back.

521
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,007
What you did?

522
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,676
<i>I can't tell you.</i>

523
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,055
<i>I ain't telling nobody.</i>

524
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:35,271
<i>I done something terrible awful
to that woman,</i>

525
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,024
<i>and now she know what I done.</i>

526
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,484
Sorry.

527
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,781
Minny.

528
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,950
<i>She got what she deserved, Aibileen.</i>

529
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,912
But now I ain't gonna never get
no job again.

530
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,166
Oh, Lord, Leroy gonna kill me.

531
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:02,382
Leroy?

532
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,011
What you done did now, Minny?

533
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,390
<i>- Get off that phone, woman!
- Leroy, please!</i>

534
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,101
Minny? Minny!

535
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,478
<i>Please! Please!</i>

536
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:16,771
<i>Come here!</i>

537
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:28,992
<i>Please open your Bibles to Exodus.</i>

538
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,412
<i>Chapter four, verse ten.</i>

539
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:37,709
God, having asked Moses
to free the Israelites...

540
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,837
...Moses answered:

541
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,551
"Oh, my Lord. I am not eloquent.

542
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:52,140
I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."

543
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:58,605
See, courage isn't just
about being brave.

544
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,814
Amen!

545
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,191
Courage is daring to do what is right

546
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,278
in spite of the weakness of our flesh.

547
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,822
And God tells us,

548
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,284
commands us, compels us,

549
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:14,287
- to love. Amen?
- Amen.

550
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,582
See, love,

551
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:21,377
as exemplified
by our Lord Jesus Christ,

552
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:26,883
is to be prepared to put yourself
in harm's way for your fellow man.

553
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,969
And by your fellow man,
I mean your brother,

554
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:34,974
your sister, your neighbour,
your friend and your enemy.

555
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:39,145
If you can love your enemy,
you already have the victory.

556
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,397
Let's stand. All right.

557
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,295
Quick. Come quick.

558
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,715
I parked way up on State Street and
caught a cab here, like you asked.

559
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,467
Got dropped two streets over?

560
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:28,444
I know now that it's against the law,
what we're doing.

561
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,787
I've never seen you
out of uniform before.

562
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,249
You look really nice.

563
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,584
Thank you.

564
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,731
I ain't never had no white person
in my house before.

565
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,359
Miss Skeeter...

566
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:15,783
...what if you don't like what I
got to say... about white people?

567
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,120
This isn't about me.

568
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,373
It doesn't matter how I feel.

569
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,926
You gonna have to change my name.
Mine, Miss Leefolt's. Everybody.

570
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,472
Do you have other maids
that are interested?

571
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,392
That gonna be hard.

572
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,227
What about Minny?

573
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,979
Minny got her some stories,
sure enough,

574
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,983
but she ain't real keen on talking
to white peoples right now.

575
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,739
What does it feel like
to raise a white child

576
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,784
when your own child's at home being
looked after by somebody else?

577
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,163
It feel...

578
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,760
Is that your son?

579
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,809
Yes, ma'am.

580
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,602
Can we move on to the next question?

581
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,189
You don't have to call me ma'am.

582
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,775
Not here.

583
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,368
Do you want to talk about the bathroom?

584
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:44,163
Or anything about Miss Leefolt?

585
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:49,794
How she pays you, or has she ever
yelled at you in front of Mae Mobley?

586
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:57,552
I thought I might write my stories down
and read them to you.

587
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,638
Ain't no different than writing down
my prayers.

588
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,726
OK.

589
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,312
Sure.

590
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:18,156
I don't say my prayers out loud.

591
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,492
I can get my point across
a lot better writing them down.

592
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:26,706
I write an hour,
sometimes two, every night.

593
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:31,169
And after my prayers last night,
I got some stories down, too.

594
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,132
Go ahead.

595
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,853
"My first white baby to ever look after

596
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,231
was named Alton Carrington Speers.

597
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:56,444
It was 1925, and I had just turned 14.

598
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,156
I dropped out of school
to help Mama with the bills.

599
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,909
Alton's mama died of lung disease."

600
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:10,458
I loved that baby. And he loved me.

601
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:15,713
That's when I learned I could make
children feel proud of they self.

602
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:22,178
Alton used to always be asking me
how come I was black.

603
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:24,388
Just ate him up.

604
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,391
And one time, I told him it was because
I drank too much coffee.

605
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,316
You should have seen his face.

606
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,289
This was just so great.

607
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,586
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
your doing this with me.

608
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,547
What changed your mind?

609
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,384
God.

610
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,513
And Miss Hilly Holbrook.

611
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:23,406
Miss Hilly, I would like to ask you
and Mr William something.

612
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:30,913
My twin boys graduated from high school,
both on the honour roll.

613
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,042
Me and my husband, we been saving
for years to send them to Tougaloo.

614
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:40,172
We're short about $75
on one of the tuitions.

615
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:47,179
I am late. I gotta get going.

616
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,350
See you tonight, honey.

617
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,560
OK.

618
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,105
Go on.

619
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,486
Well, now we're...

620
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,364
...faced with having to choose

621
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,159
which son can go if we don't
come up with the money.

622
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,996
Would you consider giving us a loan?

623
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:17,960
I'd work every day for free
till it was paid off.

624
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:22,131
That's not working for free.
That's paying <i>off</i> a debt.

625
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,135
Yes, ma'am.

626
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:34,310
As a Christian, I'm doing you a favour.

627
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:40,274
See, God don't give charity to those
who are well and able.

628
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:45,237
You need to come up with this money
on your own. OK?

629
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,492
Yes, ma'am.

630
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,118
You'll thank me one day.

631
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:56,999
You cooking white food,
you taste it with a different spoon.

632
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,877
If they see you put the tasting spoon
back in the pot,

633
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,379
might as well throw it all out.

634
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,713
Spoon, too.

635
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,092
And you use the same cup, same fork,
same plate every day.

636
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,843
And you put it up in the cabinet.

637
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,721
You tell that white woman that's where
you're gonna keep it from now on out.

638
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,681
Don't do it and see what happens.

639
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,517
Morning, ladies.

640
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,352
When you're serving white folks coffee,

641
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:17,812
set it down in front of them.

642
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,648
Don't hand it to them,
'cause your hands can't touch.

643
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,151
And don't hit on they children.

644
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,862
White folks like to do
they own spanking.

645
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,658
And last thing. Come here.

646
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,160
Look at me.

647
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,663
No sass-mouthing.

648
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,167
No sass-mouthing.

649
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,044
I mean it.

650
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,592
Give your mama a kiss.

651
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:55,766
<i>Leroy had made Sugar quit school
to help him with the bills.</i>

652
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:03,065
<i>And every day Minny
went without a job,</i>

653
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:05,985
<i>might have been a day Leroy
took her from our world.</i>

654
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,199
Good morning, everybody.

655
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,374
<i>But I knew.</i>

656
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:24,837
<i>I knew the only white lady Miss Hilly
hadn't gotten to with her lies.</i>

657
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,142
Come on!

658
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:42,771
No sass-mouthing, Minny Jackson.
No sass-mouthing.

659
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,318
Aibileen said you'd be on time.

660
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,449
I'm Celia Rae Foote.

661
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,284
I'm Minny Jackson.

662
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,955
You... cooking something?

663
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:04,585
One of those upside-down cakes
from a magazine.

664
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:08,506
It ain't working out too good.
Come on, let's get you a cold Coca-Cola.

665
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,218
Come on.

666
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,388
This here is the kitchen.

667
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,934
What in the hell?

668
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,731
I guess I got some learning to do.

669
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,527
You sure do.

670
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,738
Johnny's grand mama left him this house
when she died.

671
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,908
And then Johnny's mama
wouldn't let me change a thing.

672
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,077
But if I had it my way,

673
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:43,123
this place would be wall-to-wall
white carpet with gold trim.

674
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,459
None of this old stuff.

675
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,920
The main house has
five beds and baths,

676
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:52,383
and then the pool house has
two more beds and baths.

677
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,718
When y'all gonna start
having some children,

678
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,971
filling up all these empty beds?

679
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,724
I'm pregnant now.

680
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:05,437
Gonna be eating for two.
That's double the cooking.

681
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,358
I know. It's an awful lot to do.

682
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,487
Five other maids have
already turned me down.

683
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,116
Let me at least get you some bus money.

684
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:20,703
Now... when did you hear me say
I don't want to clean this house?

685
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:25,207
Wait. So you'll do it?

686
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,465
No hugging. No hugging.

687
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:38,971
I'm sorry. This is the first time
I've hired a maid.

688
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,432
Come on.

689
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:51,150
- You hungry?
- No, ma'am. Hold on a minute.

690
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:53,360
We gots to talk about
some things first.

691
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:59,199
I work Sunday through Friday.

692
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,369
No, you can't work at all
on the weekends.

693
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,914
OK. What time you want me here?

694
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:10,919
After 9.00, and you gotta leave
before 4.00.

695
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,255
OK.

696
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:15,132
Now...

697
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:16,884
What your husband say you can pay?

698
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,638
Johnny doesn't know
I'm bringing in help.

699
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,890
And what Mr Johnny gonna do
when he come home

700
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,225
and find a coloured woman in his house?

701
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,187
It's not like I'd be fibbing.

702
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:30,773
I just want him to think I can do this
on my own.

703
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,235
I really need a maid.

704
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,615
I'll be here tomorrow morning
about 9.15.

705
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:42,868
Great.

706
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,206
Miss Celia?

707
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,001
I think you done burned up your cake.

708
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,547
Doggone it!

709
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,847
<i>OK, let's see.
What's first up on the agenda?</i>

710
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:10,145
We are running behind on our coat drive.
Hurry up and clean out those closets.

711
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:15,359
But our Christmas benefit, however,
is right on schedule. Mary Beth?

712
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:21,281
Well, thanks to y'all, I can announce
that we already filled

713
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:25,119
every raffle slot for baked goods!

714
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:30,416
Think we can put a dent in African
children's hunger this year?

715
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,585
A big dent!

716
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,881
Now...

717
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,676
...I just found out
the surgeon general

718
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:44,221
has reviewed the Home Health
Sanitation Initiative that I drafted,

719
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:48,058
and he passed it along
to Governor Barnett!

720
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:52,563
Skeeter, when can we expect to see
the initiative in the newsletter?

721
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,398
I gave it to you a month ago.

722
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,608
I gave that to you myself.

723
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:59,611
Would you please stand, Skeeter?

724
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,410
I'll have it in there real soon.

725
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,664
Great.

726
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,674
Sorry I'm late.

727
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:30,309
Thanks.

728
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,567
Hilly, I really am sorry
about the newsletter.

729
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:41,028
It's just with Mama being sick and all.

730
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,698
Oh, it's fine.

731
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,411
I made you the egg and olive on rye,
Miss Skeeter.

732
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,955
Thank you, Henry.

733
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,624
You remembered.

734
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,125
You're welcome.

735
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,630
Oh, Hilly, tell her.
I can hardly stand it.

736
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,091
He's coming.

737
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:06,678
Skeeter, Stuart's definitely
coming this time. Next Saturday week.

738
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:11,600
Well, he's cancelled twice before.
Don't you think maybe that's a sign?

739
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,102
Don't you dare say that.

740
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,021
You know I'm not gonna be his type.

741
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,398
Damn it, Skeeter, I'm not gonna
let you miss out on this

742
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,777
because your mother convinced you you're
not good enough for somebody like him.

743
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,658
Saturday night.

744
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,490
Good morning.

745
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:11,577
Good morning, Baby Girl.

746
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,037
Good morning.

747
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,802
I reckon I'm ready to talk about
Miss Leefolt now.

748
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:35,058
Baby Girl still gotta wear a diaper
when she sleep at night.

749
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,477
And it don't get changed till
I get there in the morning.

750
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,480
That about ten hours
she gotta sleep in her mess.

751
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,401
Now Miss Leefolt pregnant
with her second baby.

752
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,572
Lord... I pray this child
turn out good.

753
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,284
It's a lonely road if a mama
don't think their child is pretty.

754
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,080
That's very true.

755
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,920
Miss Leefolt should not
be having babies.

756
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,508
Write that down.

757
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:18,310
Treelore would like me doing this.

758
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:21,271
He always said we were gonna have
a writer in the family one day.

759
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,857
I always thought it was gonna be him.
Maybe it's gonna be me.

760
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,902
Aibileen, Aibileen.

761
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:29,863
They done set a bomb <i>off</i>
in Medgar Evers' carport.

762
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:42,167
Yule Mae told me what y'all was up to.
I didn't want to believe it.

763
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:48,006
And just what makes you think
coloured people need your help?

764
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,717
- Why do you care?
- Minny.

765
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,678
Maybe you just want
to get Aibileen in trouble.

766
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,429
No.

767
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,974
I want to show her perspective.

768
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,811
So people might understand
what it's like from your side.

769
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,647
Well, it's a real Fourth of July picnic.

770
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:07,484
It's what we dream of doing
all weekend long.

771
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:10,404
Get back into they house,
polish the silver.

772
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:15,158
And we just love not making minimum wage
or getting Social Security.

773
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,038
And how we love they children
when they little.

774
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:24,001
And then they turn out
just like they mamas.

775
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,210
I know.

776
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,755
Maybe things can change.

777
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,008
What law's gonna say you
gotta be nice to your maid?

778
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,718
You don't have to do this now, Minny.

779
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,511
You damn right I don't!

780
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,389
You two give me the heart palpitations.

781
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,145
And that's a good mood.

782
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,534
All right. I'm gonna do it.

783
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:01,663
But I need to make sure she understands
this ain't no game we playing here.

784
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:06,334
Slide your chair out from under
that table. Face me.

785
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:12,883
I need to see you square on
at all times.

786
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,853
I gotta come up with
your questions, too?

787
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:31,026
Let's begin with where you were born.

788
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:34,946
Belzoni, Mississippi,
on my great-auntie's sofa.

789
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,239
Next.

790
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,742
I put the green beans in first.

791
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:42,037
Then I get on the pork chops so I can
get started on that cornbread.

792
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:45,707
<i>Once Minny got to talking about food,
she liked to never stop.</i>

793
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:51,171
<i>And when she got to talking about
the white ladies, it took all night.</i>

794
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:55,842
Then she say, "Oh, Minny, I'm gonna
give you a paid vacation."

795
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,553
I ain't never had no paid vacation
in my life.

796
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,473
A week later I come back,
and they done moved to Mobile.

797
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,894
Miss Lazy Fingers scared I'd find
a new job before she moved.

798
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:08,105
Ain't that right, Aibileen?

799
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:15,445
We gots to get some more maids.

800
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,949
It hard. You go try and see.

801
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:22,744
OK, I will.

802
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,752
We gone and done it now.

803
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:38,343
Skeeter! Get down here! Something just
arrived from New York for you.

804
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:54,943
What is that?

805
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,780
The Shinalator.
All the way from New York City.

806
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,492
I'm a good mother.
Come on. Sit down.

807
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:09,291
The whole system cost 11 dollars.
Even smells expensive.

808
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:14,379
You're gonna look beautiful
on your date tonight.

809
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,882
I can feel the hope in your fingers.

810
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,887
Holy shit.

811
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,639
- You shrunk five inches.
- Oh, my God.

812
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,850
You'll be able to wear heels tonight.

813
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,021
You're not leaving the house in those
awful Mexican man shoes.

814
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:32,522
Can I take the Cadillac?

815
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,858
We promised the Cadillac
to Carlton and Rebecca tonight,

816
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:38,153
so William's cousin will just
have to come pick you up himself.

817
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,906
- I'll take the truck.
- It's hooked up to the motor grader.

818
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,073
I'll drive slow.

819
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,993
Skeeter! Skeeter!

820
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,998
Now remember, no gentleman wants
to spend the evening with a sourpuss.

821
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:53,418
Don't mope! Smile!

822
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:58,924
And for heaven's sakes, don't sit like
some squaw Indian! Cross your ankles!

823
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,593
I love you!

824
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,646
Stuart, she'll be here any minute.

825
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,482
Hey.

826
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,152
Skeeter.

827
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:25,533
Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all talk
about quarterbacks or something.

828
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,494
Yule Mae, get Miss Skeeter a Coca-Cola.

829
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:28,828
Yes, ma'am.

830
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:44,052
Want a drink?

831
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,012
Just water, please.

832
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:51,434
Double Old Kentucky, straight with
a water back. Make that two backs.

833
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,479
You sure you don't want to just make it
the whole bottle and a straw?

834
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:57,941
Honey, there's the lieutenant governor.
Let's go say hi.

835
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:05,031
Good to see you, sir.
You remember my wife?

836
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,409
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

837
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:14,666
So, what do you do with your time?

838
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:16,876
You work?

839
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:19,087
I write.

840
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,632
But right now I'm working on
a domestic maintenance column

841
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:23,883
for <i>The Jackson Journal.</i>

842
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,178
You mean housekeeping.

843
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,891
Jesus, I can't think of anything worse
than reading a cleaning column,

844
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,893
except for maybe writing one.

845
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,687
Well, I can.

846
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:39,858
Working with a bunch of greasy,
stinky men in the middle of the ocean.

847
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:43,528
It sounds like a ploy to find a husband,
becoming an expert in keeping house.

848
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:47,324
Well, aren't you a genius?
You figured out my whole scheme.

849
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,702
Isn't that what all you girls
from Ole Miss major in...

850
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:52,579
...professional husband hunting?

851
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:55,665
Who is hungry?

852
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,419
I'm sorry, but were you dropped
on your head as an infant?

853
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:01,254
Or were you just born stupid?

854
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,195
So, what can you cook?

855
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:29,657
I can cook cornpone.

856
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,327
Boil potatoes.

857
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,579
I can do grits.

858
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,042
Well...

859
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:43,880
...I reckon if there's anything you
ought to know about cooking, it's this.

860
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:47,133
The most important invention since
they put mayonnaise in a jar.

861
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,262
You got gum in your hair,

862
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,640
you got a squeaky door hinge...

863
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:54,808
Crisco.

864
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,186
How pretty.

865
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:02,023
Looks like frosting.

866
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:05,068
You got bags under your eyes.

867
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,195
Want to soften your husband's
scaly feet.

868
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:09,948
Crisco.

869
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:14,411
But it's best for frying chicken.

870
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:17,330
Frying chicken just...

871
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:20,583
...tend to make you
feel better about life.

872
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:25,547
At least me, anyway.

873
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,592
I love me some fried chicken.

874
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,262
Now...

875
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:35,432
...shake that.

876
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:44,649
This is so much fun!

877
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:49,529
All right, all right.
The chicken already dead, Miss Celia.

878
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,659
Yep. He dead.

879
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:07,172
There you are.

880
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:13,386
I'm starved. Looks so good.

881
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:15,638
We done been over this, Miss Celia.

882
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,684
You supposed to eat in the dining room.
That's how it works.

883
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:20,894
Let me take your plate back.

884
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,771
I'm fine right here, Minny.

885
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,292
What?

886
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:47,962
I just want you to know
I'm real grateful you're here.

887
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,882
You gots plenty more
to be grateful for than me.

888
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,637
And look, now I ain't
messing around no more.

889
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,096
Now Mr Johnny gonna catch me here,

890
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:00,099
and shoot me dead right here
on this no-wax floor.

891
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,227
You gots to tell him.

892
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,230
Ain't he wondering how
the cooking's so good?

893
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,023
You're right.

894
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,860
Maybe we ought to
burn the chicken a little.

895
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,614
Minny don't burn chicken.

896
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:20,954
I like this Sarah Ross. She testifies
without complaining too much.

897
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,749
And that Bertha,
she's got chutzpah, I'll give her that.

898
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:26,251
So you liked it?

899
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:29,045
<i>Eugenia, Martin Luther King
just invited</i>

900
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:32,173
the entire country to march with him
in D.C. in August.

901
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,841
This many Negroes and whites

902
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:36,219
<i>have not worked together since</i>
Gone with the Wind.

903
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:39,138
How many stories have you
recorded thus far?

904
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,307
The ones you've read.

905
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:44,686
<i>Two domestics, that's all?</i>

906
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,480
I'm real close to
getting more interviews.

907
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:51,651
Don't send me anything else
until you do have more maids.

908
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:54,654
Yes, ma'am. How... how many more?

909
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,699
I don't know. At least a dozen.

910
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:01,202
<i>My advice to you is to write it
and write it fast</i>

911
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:03,705
before this whole civil rights thing
blows over.

912
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,540
Now good night to you, Miss Phelan.

913
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:20,054
We need a dozen more.

914
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:25,143
Me and Aibileen done asked everybody
we know. Thirty-one maids.

915
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,104
They all too scared. Think we crazy.

916
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:32,108
If we don't get more,
we're not getting published.

917
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:35,236
I gots plenty stories, Miss Skeeter.

918
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:38,990
Just write them down
and invent the maid that said it.

919
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:41,701
You're already making up names.
Just make up the maids, too.

920
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:45,788
We're not gonna do that.
That would be wrong.

921
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,290
Don't give up on this, Miss Skeeter.

922
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,083
It wouldn't be real.

923
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,170
They killed my son.

924
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,221
He fell carrying two-by-fours
at the mill.

925
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:06,059
Truck run over him, crushed his lung.

926
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,816
That white foreman threw his body
on back of a truck.

927
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:17,487
Drove to the coloured hospital...

928
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,614
...dumped him there and honked the horn.

929
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:34,295
There was nothing they could do,
so I brought my baby home.

930
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,302
Laid him down on that sofa right there.

931
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,933
He died right in front of me.

932
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:53,147
He was just 24 years old, Miss Skeeter.
Best part of a person's life.

933
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:58,361
Anniversary of his death comes...

934
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,905
...every year, and I can't breathe.

935
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,282
But to y'all, it's just
another day of bridge.

936
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,205
You stop this...

937
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:14,293
...everything I wrote, he wrote,
everything he was is gonna die with him.

938
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:27,724
I am just honoured to be hosting
Elizabeth's shower.

939
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,685
Doesn't she look glowing, everybody?

940
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:32,729
Yes, she does!

941
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,940
Honey, you hold on to it,
to the bitter end.

942
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:39,026
- I'll try.
- Well, congratulations.

943
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,156
I'm hungry, Mommy.

944
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,241
She's always hungry.

945
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,078
You know she can hear you, Elizabeth.

946
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:53,499
I'll cut you a piece of cake, baby.
Go on, now.

947
01:10:57,545 --> 01:11:02,383
Aibileen, are you enjoying your new
bathroom over at Elizabeth's?

948
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:06,304
Nice to have your own.
Isn't it, Aibileen?

949
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,145
Yes, ma'am. And I thank you.

950
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,981
Separate, but equal.

951
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:20,109
That's what Ross Barnett says,
and you can't argue with the governor.

952
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:24,489
Well, certainly not in Mississippi,
the birthplace of modern-day government.

953
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:44,258
Hey, Miss Skeeter.
Can I get you something?

954
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:45,426
No, thanks.

955
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,096
Yule Mae, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

956
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,851
I already know what you're gonna ask,
Miss Skeeter.

957
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:58,231
Minny and Aibileen already did.

958
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,988
I'm trying to get my boys
off to college.

959
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:10,868
It's worthwhile what
y'all are doing, but...

960
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:13,621
...but my boys are worth more.

961
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,456
I understand.

962
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,797
What do you understand, Skeeter?

963
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:29,554
Yule Mae was just saying how excited she
is that her boys are going to college.

964
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:33,057
Did you also ask Miss Skeeter
if you could borrow money?

965
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,226
Of course not.

966
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:39,397
I'm gonna put Billy down for his nap.

967
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,775
Excuse me.

968
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,154
Come on, baby.

969
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:59,584
Skeeter, are you intentionally not
putting my initiative in the newsletter?

970
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,546
No, not at all. I just have been
really busy with Mama.

971
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,548
I know.

972
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:09,343
I know, you must be so worried
about your mother, but...

973
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,263
I'm worried about you.

974
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:14,891
Reading this stuff?

975
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:19,687
Believe it or not, there are real
racists in this town.

976
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:22,607
If the wrong person caught you
with anything like that,

977
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:24,775
you'd be in serious trouble.

978
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,321
I'll be on the lookout.

979
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,535
Put my initiative in the newsletter.

980
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:39,415
OK?

981
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,133
Skeeter, get up!

982
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,636
- No! What?
- We've got to get dressed.

983
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:36,514
What's wrong?

984
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:39,016
Don't panic. Don't panic.

985
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:44,063
There's a particularly tall and very
handsome man named Stuart here for you.

986
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:46,983
Oh, God.

987
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,151
Oh, mother.

988
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,862
You would not like him. Trust me.

989
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,280
He's a drunken asshole.

990
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:57,660
Love and hate are two horns on the same
goat, Eugenia, and you need a goat.

991
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,954
Put that on. Hurry!

992
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:08,129
Look, I know it was a few weeks back,

993
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:12,216
but I came to say I'm sorry
for the way I acted.

994
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:14,343
Who sent you, William or Hilly?

995
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,636
Neither.

996
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:18,180
Hilly. But I wanted to come, OK.

997
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,307
I was rude, and I've been
thinking about it a lot.

998
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:24,020
- Well, I haven't. So you can just go.
- Goddamn it!

999
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:29,775
I told Hilly I wasn't ready to go out on
any date. Wasn't even close to ready.

1000
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:36,782
I was engaged last year. She ended it.

1001
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,284
I'm sure she did.

1002
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,870
It's not like that.
I'm not always a jerk.

1003
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:46,709
We had been dating since we were 15,
and you know how it is.

1004
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:49,879
Actually, I don't. I've never really
dated anyone before.

1005
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:51,505
Ever?

1006
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,591
Ever.

1007
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,386
All right, I...

1008
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:01,348
Well, that must be it, then.

1009
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:02,850
- What?
- You, Skeeter.

1010
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:05,436
I've never met a woman that says
exactly what she's thinking.

1011
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:08,397
- Well, I got plenty to say.
- Yeah, I'll bet you do.

1012
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:12,401
You make me laugh, smile.

1013
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,656
Would you like to come
have dinner with me?

1014
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:22,828
We could talk. I could actually
listen to you this time.

1015
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:25,706
I can't think of anything worse.

1016
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:32,004
I understand, and I'm sorry. That's what
I came here to say, and I said it.

1017
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:40,429
Just give me a minute.

1018
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:43,432
Let me get my sweater.

1019
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:50,481
Not a big fan of oysters?

1020
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:53,359
Oysters are a vehicle
for crackers and ketchup.

1021
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:57,446
Well, here's to new beginnings.

1022
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:07,832
You're disgusting.

1023
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:09,583
You've already made that pretty clear.

1024
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,295
And just so you know,
the boys caught me reading

1025
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,422
your <i>Miss Myrna</i> column
on the rig the other day.

1026
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:18,092
Really? You read them?

1027
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:19,260
All of them.

1028
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:21,595
Very informative, too.

1029
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:24,557
I had no idea that ground egg shells
got grease out of clothes.

1030
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:26,142
Well, I do my homework.

1031
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:33,899
You're a good writer, Skeeter.

1032
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:36,402
Thank you.

1033
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:40,739
I want to be a journalist.

1034
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:44,952
Or maybe a novelist. Or maybe both.

1035
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,079
I like that.

1036
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:51,750
You're really smart. And pretty.

1037
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:01,969
Skeeter.

1038
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:05,014
I hope you get to write something
really good.

1039
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,683
Something you believe in.

1040
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,113
Hello?

1041
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,910
What? I'm coming!

1042
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:29,997
Aibileen! Come on. We have to go
help Hilly. Right now!

1043
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,713
You're trespassing!

1044
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:41,717
It's Skeeter!
She put it in the newsletter.

1045
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:43,385
Oh, my God.

1046
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:47,890
I specifically said,
"Drop old coats at my house."

1047
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,100
Not commodes!

1048
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:52,102
Why would she do this to me?

1049
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,104
I don't know. I don't know, Hilly.

1050
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,941
It's so embarrassing.

1051
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:06,700
Oh, Lord.

1052
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:08,244
I go potty, Mommy.

1053
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:11,288
No! Mae Mobley!

1054
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,499
You get off of that toilet!

1055
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,461
You will catch diseases, do you hear me?

1056
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:19,630
You will catch diseases
on those toilets.

1057
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:37,481
You is kind, you is smart,

1058
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:39,858
you is important.

1059
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,289
<i>Don't shop for anything
on Capitol Street.</i>

1060
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:58,335
<i>Let's let the merchants down on Capitol
Street feel the economic pinch.</i>

1061
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,421
<i>Let me say this to you.</i>

1062
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:03,299
<i>I had one merchant to call me,
and he said,</i>

1063
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:08,095
<i>"I want you to know that I've
talked to my national office today,</i>

1064
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:11,557
<i>and they want me to tell you that we
don't need nigger business."</i>

1065
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:16,729
<i>These are stores that help to support
the White Citizens' Council,</i>

1066
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:21,108
<i>the council that is dedicated to keeping
you and I second-class citizens.</i>

1067
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:23,110
Mama!

1068
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:27,489
Don't encourage them like that.

1069
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:30,034
- That is national news.
- I won't have it!

1070
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:34,246
You understand?

1071
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,008
How you doing, Miss Clark?

1072
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:50,220
All right, Henry.

1073
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,264
Thank you. How you doing?

1074
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:57,353
If God is willing, Miss Clark.
If God is willing.

1075
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:58,937
That's good.

1076
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:00,981
- Yeah.
- That's good.

1077
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:10,783
What's going on out there, mister?

1078
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,910
Coloured people off.

1079
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,661
The rest of you,
let me know where you're going.

1080
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:15,954
I'll get you close as I can.

1081
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,706
What happened?

1082
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,666
I don't know. Some nigger got shot.

1083
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:22,628
- Where you headed?
- Woodrow Wilson.

1084
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,755
Woodrow Wilson. All right.

1085
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:37,684
- You gonna be all right, Miss Clark?
- I'll be all right. You go on now.

1086
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:40,312
- You want me to walk you?
- No, thank you. I'll be all right.

1087
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:42,773
You have a good night.

1088
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,150
Which way you going?

1089
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:58,247
<i>We view this as a cold,
brutal, deliberate...</i>

1090
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:03,669
<i>...killing in a savage,
uncivilised state.</i>

1091
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:09,007
<i>There is no state with a record that
approaches that of Mississippi</i>

1092
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:13,470
<i>in inhumanity, murder, brutality</i>

1093
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:14,972
<i>and racial hatred.</i>

1094
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:19,393
<i>It is absolutely at the bottom
of the list.</i>

1095
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,020
<i>Fifteen minutes past midnight,</i>

1096
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:25,941
<i>Evers got out of his car beside his home
in a Negro residential area.</i>

1097
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:28,026
<i>In a vacant lot about 40 yards away,</i>

1098
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:31,613
<i>a sniper fired a single shot from a
high-powered rifle at Evers' silhouette.</i>

1099
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,116
I'm all right. Sit down. You all right?

1100
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:35,868
- I'm OK.
<i>- The bullet hit him in the back,</i>

1101
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,912
<i>crashed through his body,
through a window, into the house.</i>

1102
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:41,540
<i>He died within an hour
at a Jackson hospital.</i>

1103
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:44,042
<i>City detectives believe the fatal shot
was fired from...</i>

1104
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:48,213
KKK shot him. An hour ago.

1105
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,925
Right in front of his children,
Aibileen.

1106
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:56,555
We're gonna pray for the Evers.
We're gonna pray for Myrlie.

1107
01:22:56,722 --> 01:23:00,058
We living in hell. Trapped.

1108
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,978
Our kids, trapped.

1109
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:08,400
Sugar, take your brothers and sisters
and y'all go on to bed.

1110
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:15,699
Good night.

1111
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:18,202
Good night. Good night.

1112
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:22,748
Good night, baby.

1113
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:36,470
What they gonna do if they catch us
with Miss Skeeter?

1114
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:38,847
We're gonna be careful.

1115
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:44,853
Hitch us to a pickup? Drag us behind?
Shoot me in front of my children?

1116
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,523
We ain't doing civil rights.

1117
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,609
We're just telling stories
like they really happened.

1118
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:54,279
You're a fool, old woman.

1119
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,449
A fool.

1120
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:32,985
Miss Phelan, the presses are heating up.
We needed <i>Miss Myrna</i> 30 minutes ago.

1121
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:34,611
Yes, sir.

1122
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,321
Chop-chop.

1123
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:39,116
Good Lord.

1124
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,675
Miss Celia?

1125
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:17,362
- Miss Celia?
- Go home. I'll see you tomorrow.

1126
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:19,906
You mess up your hair colouring again?

1127
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:23,702
I helped you fix it last time.
We got it back to butter batch.

1128
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:25,454
Was real pretty, remember?

1129
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:30,834
Miss Celia.

1130
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,795
I told you, go home!

1131
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:51,438
I said get out!

1132
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:09,748
Why is there so much blood?

1133
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:19,257
Next one's gonna catch, Miss Celia.
You just wait and see.

1134
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,262
We got married 'cause I was pregnant.

1135
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:29,017
Then I lost it a month later.

1136
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:33,522
Johnny wants kids now.

1137
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:38,819
What's he gonna do with me?

1138
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,115
Well...

1139
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,660
Mr Johnny just gonna have
to get over it.

1140
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:51,123
He doesn't know about the baby.

1141
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:57,212
Or the two before.

1142
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,435
Yule Mae Davis?

1143
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,648
- What do you want me to do?
- You're under arrest.

1144
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:03,195
Just call my husband.
Just call my husband.

1145
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:10,202
- Wait a minute. I want my purse.
- No, you're under arrest.

1146
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:14,164
I want to get my purse.
I want to get my purse! Aibee!

1147
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:16,291
Don't fight, Yule Mae!

1148
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:21,379
I want my purse! I want my purse!

1149
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,219
Just let me go!

1150
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:30,263
Yule Mae, don't fight.

1151
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:41,942
I knew she was a thief
the day she started.

1152
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:46,947
A nigra walks into a pawn shop
with a ring of such size and colour.

1153
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:51,368
It took them all of ten minutes
to find out where she worked.

1154
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:57,249
I am desperate for a grilled cheese
sandwich. Are you? Are you?

1155
01:28:57,415 --> 01:28:59,751
- Do you want a grilled cheese sandwich?
- Oh, yes.

1156
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:02,170
Just go sit down over there.

1157
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:13,098
Miss Skeeter, you best head on over
to Miss Aibileen's house.

1158
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:14,891
Now.

1159
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,549
I'm gonna help with your stories.

1160
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:50,260
I'm gonna help, too.

1161
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:54,306
We all are.

1162
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:57,434
- That's right.
- I'll help you.

1163
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:04,149
I used to take a shortcut every day when
I went to work at Dr Dixon's house.

1164
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:07,861
Cut through that farmer's lower 40
to get there.

1165
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:11,865
One day this farmer
was waiting for me with a gun.

1166
01:30:12,032 --> 01:30:15,619
Said he'd shoot me dead
if I walked on his land again.

1167
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:22,417
Dr Dixon went and paid that farmer
double for two of those acres.

1168
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:25,420
Told him he was gonna
start farming, too.

1169
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:31,051
But he bought that just for me,
so I could get to work easy.

1170
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:33,553
He did.

1171
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:36,765
I worked for Miss Jolene's mother
till the day she died.

1172
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:41,144
Then her daughter, Miss Nancy,
asked me to come and work for her.

1173
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:44,522
Miss Nancy is a real sweet lady.

1174
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:49,903
But Miss Jolene's ma done put it in her
will I got to work for Miss Jolene.

1175
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:53,782
Miss Jolene's a mean woman.

1176
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:55,492
Mean for sport.

1177
01:30:57,827 --> 01:31:00,497
Lord, I tried to find another job.

1178
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:03,708
But in everybody's mind

1179
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:07,253
the French family
and Miss Jolene owned me.

1180
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:10,757
Owned me.

1181
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:18,306
<i>I leave early this week
for Thanksgiving.</i>

1182
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:21,267
Our last editors' meeting
is December 17th,

1183
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:23,186
so if you want a prayer
of this getting read,

1184
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:26,356
<i>- I'd better have it by then.</i>
- That's in three weeks, Miss Stein.

1185
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:29,025
Well, otherwise it goes in the pile.

1186
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:31,987
You do not want it in the pile.

1187
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:33,238
Yes, ma'am.

1188
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:36,741
And put something personal in there.
Write about the maid who raised you.

1189
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:39,452
I understand.

1190
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:49,921
Well, we have a lot of work to do
before the benefit, don't we?

1191
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:53,091
I know, but I think we're on track.
We're doing quite well.

1192
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:02,434
It's so good.

1193
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:04,936
- Who's there?
- I don't know.

1194
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:06,730
Aibileen?

1195
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:13,194
Hey, Elizabeth! It's me, Celia Foote.

1196
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,908
I was in the neighbourhood.
Thought I'd drop by.

1197
01:32:20,577 --> 01:32:23,288
Everybody hide.
Everybody get down, get down.

1198
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,458
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1199
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:31,921
- Turn <i>off</i> the music.
- Who are we hiding from?

1200
01:32:36,926 --> 01:32:38,428
Hey!

1201
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:46,144
I brought a chocolate pie!

1202
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,732
My maid, Minny, made it.

1203
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:00,325
She's in the bushes.

1204
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:26,893
Don't be taking those women
any more pies, you understand?

1205
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:38,613
They made me stand there like I was
the vacuum salesman.

1206
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:41,866
Why, Minny?

1207
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:47,872
Because they know about you getting
knocked up by Mr Johnny.

1208
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:49,958
Mad you married one of their mens.

1209
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:54,712
And especially since Miss Hilly and
Mr Johnny had just broke up, too.

1210
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:57,423
Hilly probably thinks that I was
fooling around with Johnny

1211
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:59,259
when they were still going steady.

1212
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:05,932
And Missus Walters always said Miss
Hilly still sweet on Mr Johnny, too.

1213
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:09,310
No wonder!

1214
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:16,484
They don't hate me.
They hate what they think I did.

1215
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,029
They hate you 'cause they think
you white trash.

1216
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:23,116
I'm just going to have to tell Hilly
I ain't no boyfriend stealer.

1217
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:27,537
In fact, I'll tell her Friday night
at the benefit.

1218
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:30,957
You don't need to be going
to that benefit, Miss Celia.

1219
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:35,712
Did you hear me? You just stay home.

1220
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:41,009
That looks bad.

1221
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:44,721
Let me take a look.

1222
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:47,265
I got to get these peas on.

1223
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:50,185
I know you didn't fall
in no tub, Minny.

1224
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,000
You know what I'd do if I were you?

1225
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:17,837
I'd give it right back to him.

1226
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:22,258
I'd hit him over the head
with a skillet,

1227
01:35:22,425 --> 01:35:25,178
and I'd tell him, "Go straight to hell."

1228
01:35:35,605 --> 01:35:37,941
<i>From here, the members of the family...</i>

1229
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:44,656
<i>...visitors from foreign countries
and others</i>

1230
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:47,825
<i>will walk to St. Matthew's Cathedral.</i>

1231
01:35:54,374 --> 01:35:57,168
<i>Senator Edward Kennedy
getting out of the car.</i>

1232
01:35:59,212 --> 01:36:00,546
<i>Mrs Kennedy.</i>

1233
01:36:01,965 --> 01:36:03,967
<i>Robert Kennedy, Attorney General.</i>

1234
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:06,219
Sweetheart, I gotta
get down to the coast.

1235
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:09,138
I'll be back in time for the benefit.

1236
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:23,861
The world done gone crazy,
Miss Skeeter, and I'm scared.

1237
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:27,865
What if people find out what we writing,
figure out Niceville really Jackson,

1238
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,367
figure out who who?

1239
01:36:32,578 --> 01:36:34,497
Maybe we need us some insurance.

1240
01:36:37,709 --> 01:36:40,461
I told God I'd never speak of it again.

1241
01:36:41,671 --> 01:36:43,464
But we ain't got no choice.

1242
01:36:44,966 --> 01:36:45,967
Sorry.

1243
01:36:47,093 --> 01:36:50,972
I need to tell y'all about the terrible
awful I done to Miss Hilly.

1244
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:54,600
It might be the only thing
that keep us safe.

1245
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:07,822
So...

1246
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:12,493
Nobody wanted to hire a sass-mouthing,
thieving nigra.

1247
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:16,539
Did they?

1248
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:26,507
Pie's as good as always, Minny.

1249
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:28,426
I'm glad you like it.

1250
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:38,227
If I take you back, I'll have to cut
your pay five dollars a week.

1251
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:39,854
Take me back?

1252
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:46,110
What do you put in here
that makes it taste so good?

1253
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:49,030
That good vanilla from Mexico...

1254
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,824
...and something else real special.

1255
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:58,956
No, no, no, Missus Walters.
That's Miss Hilly's special pie.

1256
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:03,378
Mama can have a piece.

1257
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:07,423
Cut her one.

1258
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:10,551
Go get a plate.

1259
01:38:15,515 --> 01:38:16,724
Eat my shit.

1260
01:38:20,978 --> 01:38:22,355
What'd you say?

1261
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:26,567
I said, "Eat... my... shit."

1262
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,495
Have you lost your mind?

1263
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:44,460
No, ma'am, but you about to,
'cause you just did.

1264
01:38:45,169 --> 01:38:47,797
Did what?

1265
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:13,239
And you didn't eat just one.
You had two slices!

1266
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:26,085
Run, Minny, run!

1267
01:39:30,673 --> 01:39:32,258
You trying to get yourself killed?

1268
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:35,344
No! I wasn't planning on telling.

1269
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:39,140
I just wanted to see her take a bite.

1270
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:44,312
Then I was gonna leave.
Be done with her forever.

1271
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:48,232
Before I knew it, I had done
told that woman what was in that pie!

1272
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:53,112
I done ask God to forgive me.

1273
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:57,992
But more for what happened
to poor Miss Walters.

1274
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:04,790
Miss Hilly threw her in that nursing
home... just for laughing.

1275
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:08,085
We can't put that story in the book.

1276
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:10,338
We ain't got no choice.

1277
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:14,550
Hilly Holbrook can't let nobody know
that pie story about her.

1278
01:40:14,717 --> 01:40:16,844
Exactly. If people find out
the terrible awful

1279
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:19,263
was you and Miss Hilly
we in trouble there ain't words for.

1280
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:21,516
Right! But don't you see?

1281
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:24,977
She gonna go to her grave convincing
folks this book ain't about Jackson.

1282
01:40:25,144 --> 01:40:27,897
Now, that keeps us safe. Insured.

1283
01:40:29,232 --> 01:40:30,608
No.

1284
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:33,110
No, that's too dangerous.

1285
01:40:37,406 --> 01:40:40,785
Y'all two brought me into this,
but I'm gonna finish it.

1286
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:44,997
Either put it in, or pull my parts out
altogether. Y'all pick!

1287
01:40:56,425 --> 01:40:59,387
Thank you, Tommy. I should be out
by 10.00. See you then.

1288
01:41:05,017 --> 01:41:08,688
This is Jolene French, reporting from
the African Children's Benefit Ball,

1289
01:41:08,854 --> 01:41:12,191
and I'm here with League President,
Miss Hilly Holbrook.

1290
01:41:12,358 --> 01:41:16,862
Thanks, Jolene. And I'm just so excited
for the auction tonight, aren't you?

1291
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:18,990
I'm absolutely thrilled.

1292
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:21,450
Scandalous!

1293
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:25,079
Thank you.

1294
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:36,716
Hi!

1295
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:45,349
Did you see what Miss Celia got on?

1296
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:48,853
Lord, have mercy. Women better hold onto
their husbands tonight.

1297
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:52,356
Miss Leefolt been working on that dress
for four weeks

1298
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:54,191
and that's what she came up with?

1299
01:41:56,027 --> 01:41:57,278
Here.

1300
01:42:08,414 --> 01:42:09,582
Kiss me.

1301
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:45,660
Everybody enjoying the evening?

1302
01:42:50,373 --> 01:42:53,376
Let's give a nice round of applause
for the help.

1303
01:42:57,129 --> 01:43:00,341
For all the men and women who have
helped make tonight possible.

1304
01:43:02,134 --> 01:43:04,970
A cause I'm sure is dear
to their hearts as well.

1305
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:09,558
- Your cocktail.
- Thank you.

1306
01:43:12,228 --> 01:43:15,356
Honey, don't you think you've
had enough to drink?

1307
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:17,233
I wish you'd try and eat something.

1308
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,694
I'm not having my stomach poke out.

1309
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:27,535
OK, OK, everybody, quiet down.
I got the list of the winners!

1310
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:30,788
OK.

1311
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:35,710
The winner of the beautiful
mink car coat is...

1312
01:43:36,377 --> 01:43:37,586
...Charlotte Phelan!

1313
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:44,009
Congrats, Miss Phelan. Ladies, I hope
your husbands take note of that.

1314
01:43:45,094 --> 01:43:48,514
Now it's time for the baked goods.

1315
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:51,642
Yummy, yummy!

1316
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:55,020
The highest bid
in baked goods goes to

1317
01:43:55,187 --> 01:43:58,023
Minny Jackson's chocolate pie.

1318
01:43:59,817 --> 01:44:01,318
Congratulations...

1319
01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:03,696
...Hilly Holbrook!

1320
01:44:05,656 --> 01:44:08,242
- Hilly.
- That's funny.

1321
01:44:08,409 --> 01:44:10,077
I didn't bid on anything.

1322
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:14,415
All right. And now it's time
for Danica's strawberry jam.

1323
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:19,795
Congratulations, Hilly!

1324
01:44:19,962 --> 01:44:23,090
I didn't know you were a fan
of Minny's pies.

1325
01:44:24,675 --> 01:44:27,136
I've been wanting to talk to you
all night.

1326
01:44:27,303 --> 01:44:29,263
Minny said why you won't be my friend.

1327
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:31,807
It's 'cause you think me and Johnny
went behind your back.

1328
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:35,269
Wait. I want to talk...

1329
01:44:35,436 --> 01:44:36,812
Oh, no.

1330
01:44:36,979 --> 01:44:38,647
I'm so sorry.

1331
01:44:41,859 --> 01:44:43,611
Come here, sweetheart.

1332
01:44:43,778 --> 01:44:45,529
Let me bring you back to your table.

1333
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:50,451
- I'm really sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

1334
01:44:51,744 --> 01:44:55,331
What are you trying to do to me?
What are you and that nigra up to?

1335
01:44:55,498 --> 01:44:57,166
I don't know what you're talking about.

1336
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:58,876
You liar! Who did you tell?

1337
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:01,337
Hilly, I got pregnant
after you and Johnny broke up!

1338
01:45:01,504 --> 01:45:04,173
- Oh, shit!
- Shut up, Mother!

1339
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:07,760
Johnny never cheated on you.

1340
01:45:08,677 --> 01:45:10,304
At least not with me.

1341
01:45:11,514 --> 01:45:13,724
Johnny would never cheat on me.

1342
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:17,269
I'm so sorry! I thought you'd be tickled
you won that pie!

1343
01:45:18,145 --> 01:45:23,192
You tell that nigra, if she tells
anybody, I will make her suffer!

1344
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:25,402
Hey, that is enough.

1345
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:26,570
Celia.

1346
01:45:26,737 --> 01:45:28,239
Hey, baby, what's the matter?

1347
01:45:34,662 --> 01:45:37,957
Oh, shit. What a mess. Napkins.

1348
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:42,127
Why don't we get back to the auction?

1349
01:45:42,294 --> 01:45:45,631
Next up, Debby's peppermint bark.

1350
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:47,842
It goes great with hot cocoa.

1351
01:45:54,139 --> 01:45:55,933
Just come on home with us
tonight, Mother.

1352
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:59,353
No, thanks. I've got a pie to eat.

1353
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,939
You throw that pie away right now.

1354
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:04,233
I spent good money on this pie.

1355
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:06,944
I won it just for you.

1356
01:46:07,111 --> 01:46:09,238
You signed me up?

1357
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:13,450
I may have trouble remembering my own
name, or what country I live in,

1358
01:46:13,617 --> 01:46:16,036
but there are two things
I can't seem to forget:

1359
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:19,748
that my own daughter
threw me into a nursing home,

1360
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:21,917
and that she ate Minny's shit.

1361
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:24,169
Good night.

1362
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:31,844
- Hey, how about a nightcap?
- Let's go.

1363
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:42,146
I'm not right for this
kind of life, Minny.

1364
01:46:44,023 --> 01:46:47,192
I don't need a dining room table
for 12 people.

1365
01:46:48,027 --> 01:46:51,405
I couldn't get two people
over here if I begged.

1366
01:46:55,701 --> 01:46:58,037
I can't do this to Johnny anymore.

1367
01:47:00,456 --> 01:47:02,750
That's why I've gotta go back
to Sugar Ditch.

1368
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:06,670
You can't move back to Sugar Ditch.

1369
01:47:09,798 --> 01:47:10,966
Lord.

1370
01:47:11,634 --> 01:47:13,928
I reckon it's time you knew.

1371
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:15,262
Sit down.

1372
01:47:25,981 --> 01:47:29,026
So Miss Hilly thought you knew about
the terrible awful.

1373
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:32,321
That you was making fun of her.

1374
01:47:35,324 --> 01:47:37,868
It's my fault she pounced on you.

1375
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:42,373
If you leave Mr Johnny...

1376
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:47,795
...then Miss Hilly done won
the whole ball game.

1377
01:47:49,964 --> 01:47:51,799
Then she done beaten me...

1378
01:47:53,217 --> 01:47:55,302
...and she done beat you.

1379
01:48:02,351 --> 01:48:04,895
Thank you for telling me that.

1380
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:16,031
Lord, look at all these pages. 266.

1381
01:48:19,618 --> 01:48:22,496
So we just send it <i>off?</i>
Just wait and see?

1382
01:48:22,663 --> 01:48:23,747
Hope Miss Stein gonna publish it?

1383
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:28,669
Well, I have one more story to type
before I put it in the mail,

1384
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:30,337
but other than that, we're done.

1385
01:48:30,504 --> 01:48:32,089
Which one you got left?

1386
01:48:34,591 --> 01:48:35,759
Mine.

1387
01:48:46,395 --> 01:48:48,856
I need to talk to you about Constantine.

1388
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:53,360
Oh, Eugenia, that was so long ago.

1389
01:48:53,902 --> 01:48:55,070
What happened?

1390
01:48:58,407 --> 01:49:00,242
What happened?

1391
01:49:04,997 --> 01:49:07,124
She didn't give me a choice.

1392
01:49:12,254 --> 01:49:17,134
The Daughters of America had just
appointed me state regent.

1393
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:23,307
<i>Grace Higginbotham, our esteemed
president, came all the way down</i>

1394
01:49:23,474 --> 01:49:27,436
<i>from Washington, D.C.,
to our house for the ceremony.</i>

1395
01:49:30,397 --> 01:49:33,067
That's just beautiful. Look at that.

1396
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:40,282
She'd gotten so old and slow, Skeeter.

1397
01:49:43,994 --> 01:49:45,204
Yes, ma'am.

1398
01:49:47,873 --> 01:49:51,251
It's such an honour
that you came all this way.

1399
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,053
That's all right.

1400
01:50:05,933 --> 01:50:07,726
- Hello, Miss Charlotte.
- Rachel.

1401
01:50:10,521 --> 01:50:12,731
We were expecting you next week.

1402
01:50:12,898 --> 01:50:14,900
I decided to come early
and surprise Mama.

1403
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:19,196
I'm entertaining.

1404
01:50:19,363 --> 01:50:21,740
Why don't you go around back.
Wait in the kitchen.

1405
01:50:27,412 --> 01:50:28,705
Go on now.

1406
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:33,377
I am sorry.

1407
01:50:37,256 --> 01:50:38,966
Rachel, what are you doing?

1408
01:50:39,133 --> 01:50:42,386
I'm just doing as I was told,
Miss Charlotte.

1409
01:50:42,553 --> 01:50:44,054
Going to the kitchen.

1410
01:50:44,221 --> 01:50:46,306
But I'm going to see my mama first.

1411
01:50:49,518 --> 01:50:50,519
Hello, Mama.

1412
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:53,397
Go on to the kitchen, baby.
I'll be there directly.

1413
01:50:53,564 --> 01:50:57,734
You may put up with this kind
of nonsense, but I do not.

1414
01:51:04,449 --> 01:51:05,993
Get out of this house, Rachel.

1415
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:12,499
You heard her. Go on, girl.

1416
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:16,795
Miss Charlotte, let me take her to
the kitchen. Come on, baby. Let's go.

1417
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:20,090
Charlotte.

1418
01:51:24,511 --> 01:51:26,430
Both of you.

1419
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:29,224
Leave. Now.

1420
01:51:33,395 --> 01:51:34,730
Come on, Mama.

1421
01:52:07,262 --> 01:52:08,805
Come on now.

1422
01:52:22,444 --> 01:52:24,947
Constantine didn't do anything wrong.

1423
01:52:26,657 --> 01:52:28,575
And you love Rachel. I know you do.

1424
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:31,912
She was our president.
What was I supposed to do?

1425
01:52:32,913 --> 01:52:37,251
She did you the biggest favour of your
life. She taught me everything.

1426
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:40,587
Well, you idolised her too much.
You always have.

1427
01:52:40,754 --> 01:52:42,881
I needed someone to look up to.

1428
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:52,182
I went to her house the next day,
but she had already gone.

1429
01:53:22,587 --> 01:53:24,464
How could you not tell me all this?

1430
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:28,135
Because I didn't want to upset you
during your final exams.

1431
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:30,887
I knew you'd blame me,
and it wasn't my fault!

1432
01:53:31,054 --> 01:53:32,556
I have to go find her. She needs me.

1433
01:53:32,723 --> 01:53:34,224
- Eugenia.
- What?

1434
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:39,604
We sent your brother up to Chicago
to bring Constantine home.

1435
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:49,948
When he got there...

1436
01:53:54,036 --> 01:53:55,579
...she had died.

1437
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,805
You broke her heart.

1438
01:54:20,979 --> 01:54:24,316
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

1439
01:54:27,402 --> 01:54:29,029
I'm sorry.

1440
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:26,795
<i>They printed a few thousand copies</i>

1441
01:55:26,962 --> 01:55:30,298
<i>with the worst advance Miss Stein
had ever seen.</i>

1442
01:55:30,465 --> 01:55:33,093
Baby, what you doing with Alicia book?
You can't read.

1443
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:39,516
<i>They sent Miss Skeeter $600. She broke
that money up and gave it to each of us.</i>

1444
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:45,272
<i>Divided 13 ways,
that came to about $46 each.</i>

1445
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:52,696
Y'all finish your homework.

1446
01:55:57,868 --> 01:56:00,454
Aibileen. Aibileen!

1447
01:56:01,288 --> 01:56:04,124
We just got this from Miss Skeeter.
Look at it.

1448
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:07,544
Look at it. Look at it!

1449
01:56:07,711 --> 01:56:09,254
Minny, we're rich!

1450
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:15,051
"She fired me for using her
inside toilet.

1451
01:56:15,218 --> 01:56:19,973
Put me out in a storm and told me never
to come back. But I did come back.

1452
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:24,311
I came back with a pie I had baked
to say I'm sorry.

1453
01:56:25,353 --> 01:56:26,688
I watched her eat..."

1454
01:56:37,073 --> 01:56:39,242
Well, it's a wonderful book, Hilly.

1455
01:56:39,409 --> 01:56:43,330
Filled with gripping testimonials
from Mississippi's housekeepers.

1456
01:56:44,164 --> 01:56:45,999
OK, Mama. I need to run.

1457
01:56:46,166 --> 01:56:50,962
Well. You should read the book, Hilly.
It's quite scandalous.

1458
01:56:51,129 --> 01:56:54,716
Sounds like... Jackson, if you ask me.

1459
01:56:55,217 --> 01:56:56,551
Quite scandalous.

1460
01:56:57,886 --> 01:56:59,137
What book?

1461
01:56:59,304 --> 01:57:00,514
<i>What's it called again?</i>

1462
01:57:02,098 --> 01:57:04,809
<i>The Help.</i> H-E-L-P.

1463
01:57:32,587 --> 01:57:33,922
There it is.

1464
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:44,224
You told me to write something good.
Something I believed in.

1465
01:57:44,391 --> 01:57:46,059
It's not what I believe in.

1466
01:57:46,226 --> 01:57:49,062
That joke you pulled with Hilly
with the toilets, that's funny.

1467
01:57:50,605 --> 01:57:52,566
Why would you do this to us?

1468
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:55,151
I don't even know why you care.

1469
01:57:55,318 --> 01:57:58,154
- What?
- Things are fine around here.

1470
01:57:58,321 --> 01:57:59,739
Why go stir up trouble?

1471
01:57:59,906 --> 01:58:02,284
Trouble's already here, Stuart.

1472
01:58:02,450 --> 01:58:04,411
I had to tell you this.
You needed to know.

1473
01:58:04,578 --> 01:58:07,455
Goddamn right I needed to know. You
should have told me this from the start.

1474
01:58:12,252 --> 01:58:13,878
You're a selfish woman, Skeeter.

1475
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:16,798
Stuart.

1476
01:58:16,965 --> 01:58:19,092
I think you're better off being alone.

1477
01:59:08,975 --> 01:59:11,728
Did you get to that part yet
that I was telling you about?

1478
01:59:11,895 --> 01:59:13,772
Don't read ahead, whatever you do.

1479
01:59:13,938 --> 01:59:16,232
"What you done put up in this?"

1480
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:19,819
"She said, 'My shit."'

1481
01:59:34,668 --> 01:59:36,211
What's the matter, Hilly?

1482
01:59:37,712 --> 01:59:40,131
Get <i>off</i> of me! Get off!

1483
01:59:40,298 --> 01:59:42,008
Stop hitting me!

1484
01:59:43,593 --> 01:59:46,262
I heard that Betty character
might be Mary Elizabeth.

1485
01:59:47,222 --> 01:59:48,765
It's not Jackson.

1486
01:59:48,932 --> 01:59:53,311
And that book is garbage. I bet the
whole thing is made up by some nigra.

1487
01:59:53,478 --> 01:59:55,397
And Jolene, didn't your mama

1488
01:59:55,563 --> 01:59:57,565
leave Cora to you in her will?

1489
01:59:57,732 --> 02:00:01,653
Yes, but that's not odd, is it?
Happens all the time, right?

1490
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:04,531
The book is not about Jackson.

1491
02:01:29,449 --> 02:01:30,950
What the hell?

1492
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:33,787
What are you doing here?

1493
02:01:36,498 --> 02:01:38,875
I've contacted my lawyer.
Hibbie Goodman?

1494
02:01:39,042 --> 02:01:40,710
He's the best libel attorney
in the state.

1495
02:01:40,877 --> 02:01:42,504
Oh, Missy, you're going to jail.

1496
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:44,422
You can't prove anything.

1497
02:01:44,589 --> 02:01:47,926
I 100 percent know you wrote it.
Nobody else in town is as tacky as you.

1498
02:01:48,092 --> 02:01:49,969
You don't know anything, Hilly.

1499
02:01:50,136 --> 02:01:51,638
I don't, do I?

1500
02:01:52,305 --> 02:01:55,350
You tell Aibileen the next time
she wants to write

1501
02:01:55,517 --> 02:01:58,394
about my dear friend Elizabeth...

1502
02:01:59,395 --> 02:02:02,482
Remember her? Had you in her wedding.

1503
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:05,860
Let's just say Aibileen ought to have
been a little bit smarter

1504
02:02:06,027 --> 02:02:08,696
before putting in about that
L-shaped scratch

1505
02:02:08,863 --> 02:02:11,533
in poor Elizabeth's dining table.

1506
02:02:13,618 --> 02:02:17,413
And that nigger Minny,
do I have plans for her.

1507
02:02:18,081 --> 02:02:22,460
Careful, Hilly. That's chapter 12.

1508
02:02:23,044 --> 02:02:25,213
Don't give yourself away now.

1509
02:02:25,672 --> 02:02:27,298
That was not me!

1510
02:02:28,216 --> 02:02:30,385
I've come to tell your mother
what a hippie you've become.

1511
02:02:30,552 --> 02:02:32,595
She's going to be disgusted by you.

1512
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:36,391
Why, Hilly. Is everything OK, you two?

1513
02:02:36,558 --> 02:02:37,559
Mrs Phelan.

1514
02:02:37,725 --> 02:02:41,604
Hilly, you're a sweaty mess.
Are you ill?

1515
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,481
No, ma'am.

1516
02:02:43,648 --> 02:02:48,611
Darling, no husband wants to come home
and see that.

1517
02:02:50,738 --> 02:02:52,198
I didn't have time to get fixed up.

1518
02:02:52,365 --> 02:02:54,325
You know, Hilly, if I didn't
know any better,

1519
02:02:54,492 --> 02:02:58,162
I'd say you've been eating too much pie.

1520
02:03:02,625 --> 02:03:05,920
Mrs Phelan, I came here...

1521
02:03:06,087 --> 02:03:08,590
In fact, I'm sure of it.

1522
02:03:08,756 --> 02:03:10,967
Now you get your raggedy ass
off my porch.

1523
02:03:11,634 --> 02:03:13,511
Go on.

1524
02:03:13,678 --> 02:03:16,764
Get off my property. Now!

1525
02:03:17,849 --> 02:03:21,102
Before we all get one of those
disgusting things on our lips!

1526
02:03:36,451 --> 02:03:39,704
Eugenia. Take me inside, please.

1527
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:41,831
Yes, ma'am.

1528
02:03:57,472 --> 02:04:00,475
Skeeter, do you have plans tomorrow?

1529
02:04:01,184 --> 02:04:02,810
- No, ma'am.
- Good.

1530
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:07,023
Because we are going shopping.

1531
02:04:08,942 --> 02:04:11,402
No single daughter of mine is
going to New York City

1532
02:04:11,569 --> 02:04:13,154
representing the great state
of Mississippi

1533
02:04:13,321 --> 02:04:15,740
without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe.

1534
02:04:15,907 --> 02:04:17,283
How do you know about New York?

1535
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:20,244
Oh, well, Miss Stein called last night.

1536
02:04:27,961 --> 02:04:30,880
Courage sometimes skips a generation.

1537
02:04:33,841 --> 02:04:36,636
Thank you for bringing it back
to our family.

1538
02:04:45,937 --> 02:04:48,064
I can't leave you like this.

1539
02:04:48,564 --> 02:04:51,693
Eugenia, I have made a decision.

1540
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:54,320
My health's been on the uptick
these last few weeks,

1541
02:04:54,487 --> 02:04:57,657
and I know the doctor says it's
some kind of last strength nonsense,

1542
02:04:57,824 --> 02:05:02,245
but I have decided not to die.

1543
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:08,918
Oh, Mama.

1544
02:05:09,085 --> 02:05:11,170
It's too late.
I tried calling Fanny Mae's

1545
02:05:11,337 --> 02:05:13,214
to make all your hair appointments
for the next 20 years,

1546
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:14,924
but they wouldn't allow it.

1547
02:05:18,094 --> 02:05:22,557
I have never been more proud of you.

1548
02:05:27,478 --> 02:05:29,188
Thank you.

1549
02:05:37,822 --> 02:05:39,198
Mama.

1550
02:06:07,393 --> 02:06:08,895
Need some help with those?

1551
02:06:11,064 --> 02:06:12,273
Minny.

1552
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:14,317
- Miss Celia!
- Minny, hey, stop! Minny!

1553
02:06:14,484 --> 02:06:16,110
- Miss Celia!
- Minny!

1554
02:06:16,277 --> 02:06:20,156
- Stay back!
- I'm not here to hurt you! Girl...

1555
02:06:22,075 --> 02:06:23,785
You gonna put the stick down?

1556
02:06:28,289 --> 02:06:31,834
Listen, Celia finally told me
about the babies.

1557
02:06:33,044 --> 02:06:34,378
All of them.

1558
02:06:36,172 --> 02:06:39,842
But I also know, the minute
you started working here,

1559
02:06:40,009 --> 02:06:41,844
she started getting better.

1560
02:06:42,970 --> 02:06:44,806
So, you saved her life.

1561
02:06:48,267 --> 02:06:51,104
You knew I was here the whole time?

1562
02:06:52,271 --> 02:06:54,440
Fried chicken and okra
on the first night?

1563
02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:58,152
Y'all could have at least put
some cornpone on the table.

1564
02:07:00,863 --> 02:07:02,031
No.

1565
02:07:03,699 --> 02:07:06,035
I couldn't let you eat no more cornpone,
Mr Johnny.

1566
02:07:06,202 --> 02:07:09,038
Thanks to you, now I've had to let out
every pair of pants I own.

1567
02:07:17,046 --> 02:07:19,382
You just leave that.

1568
02:07:20,049 --> 02:07:21,384
Here you go.

1569
02:07:22,385 --> 02:07:23,803
Let's head on up the house.

1570
02:07:48,744 --> 02:07:49,829
What's this?

1571
02:07:50,705 --> 02:07:52,373
I cooked it all by myself.

1572
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:55,126
Yes, she did. She was up all night.

1573
02:07:56,752 --> 02:07:58,838
I wanted to do something special.

1574
02:08:00,089 --> 02:08:02,216
I wanted to say thank you.

1575
02:08:05,386 --> 02:08:06,387
So...

1576
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:09,015
...I ain't losing my job?

1577
02:08:11,017 --> 02:08:14,687
No, you got a job here
for the rest of your life.

1578
02:08:14,854 --> 02:08:16,063
If you want it.

1579
02:08:22,445 --> 02:08:24,655
That's a mile-high meringue, Miss Celia.

1580
02:08:33,998 --> 02:08:36,250
- Please.
- Thank you.

1581
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:43,799
You remember to check the thighs?

1582
02:08:44,967 --> 02:08:47,470
- Cooked clean through.
- Ain't pink in the middle?

1583
02:08:49,096 --> 02:08:50,890
Just the way you taught me.

1584
02:08:51,057 --> 02:08:52,934
Looky here.

1585
02:08:56,771 --> 02:08:59,774
<i>That table of food gave Minny
the strength she needed.</i>

1586
02:09:00,858 --> 02:09:05,446
<i>She took her babies out from under Leroy
and never went back.</i>

1587
02:09:09,992 --> 02:09:12,620
What are all these cars doing out here?
Are we late?

1588
02:09:12,787 --> 02:09:14,121
No, we ain't late.

1589
02:09:15,748 --> 02:09:16,916
Why ain't you singing?

1590
02:09:17,083 --> 02:09:19,085
We got to worry about getting
in there and getting our seats.

1591
02:09:19,252 --> 02:09:20,461
Come on now, we late!

1592
02:09:29,428 --> 02:09:32,723
- Who we clapping for?
- Honey, we clapping for you!

1593
02:09:36,269 --> 02:09:37,979
Come on down, Sister Clark!

1594
02:09:38,896 --> 02:09:40,064
Come on.

1595
02:09:58,249 --> 02:09:59,667
Come on.

1596
02:10:02,461 --> 02:10:03,796
All right, all right.

1597
02:10:05,423 --> 02:10:10,594
Now... this is an important time
in our community.

1598
02:10:11,387 --> 02:10:15,683
And we have to thank you
for what you have done.

1599
02:10:18,019 --> 02:10:19,145
Now...

1600
02:10:20,271 --> 02:10:22,898
We know you couldn't put
your name in here,

1601
02:10:24,317 --> 02:10:26,027
so we all signed our own.

1602
02:10:28,446 --> 02:10:29,530
Thank you.

1603
02:10:33,075 --> 02:10:35,661
Come on, now. Come on.

1604
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:17,119
Churches over two counties signed
our books. All for you and me.

1605
02:11:21,123 --> 02:11:22,458
It's beautiful.

1606
02:11:25,795 --> 02:11:26,921
What's wrong?

1607
02:11:33,135 --> 02:11:35,471
I got a job offer from Harper and Row
in New York.

1608
02:11:35,638 --> 02:11:38,015
Congratulations!

1609
02:11:38,182 --> 02:11:41,769
- I'm not taking it.
- What you mean you're not taking it?

1610
02:11:41,936 --> 02:11:43,562
I can't just leave you two here

1611
02:11:43,729 --> 02:11:46,148
when things are getting bad
from the mess that I created.

1612
02:11:48,109 --> 02:11:51,070
If bad things happen,
ain't nothing you can do about it.

1613
02:11:51,237 --> 02:11:53,614
And now it's for a reason
we can be proud of.

1614
02:11:55,866 --> 02:11:57,868
I don't mean to rub salt in your wound,

1615
02:11:58,035 --> 02:12:00,496
but you ain't got a good life here
in Jackson.

1616
02:12:00,663 --> 02:12:02,123
Plus, your mama's getting better.

1617
02:12:02,289 --> 02:12:05,668
You ain't got nothing left here but
enemies in the Junior League.

1618
02:12:05,835 --> 02:12:07,753
You done burned every bridge there is.

1619
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:11,841
And you ain't never gonna get another
man in this town. Everybody know that.

1620
02:12:12,883 --> 02:12:16,345
So don't walk your white butt
to New York, run it!

1621
02:12:18,347 --> 02:12:22,017
Looky here, Miss Skeeter.
I'm gonna take care of Aibileen.

1622
02:12:24,186 --> 02:12:25,980
And she's gonna take care of me.

1623
02:12:37,741 --> 02:12:40,327
Go find your life, Miss Skeeter.

1624
02:12:53,799 --> 02:12:55,926
Aibileen, can you come in here, please?

1625
02:13:02,308 --> 02:13:03,350
Good morning.

1626
02:13:04,101 --> 02:13:08,981
Aibileen, the silver
I lent Elizabeth last week.

1627
02:13:09,148 --> 02:13:11,233
It not polished good?

1628
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:14,653
Humidity been fighting me
on polishing day.

1629
02:13:14,820 --> 02:13:19,492
When you returned it, three pieces
were missing from the felt wrapper.

1630
02:13:20,826 --> 02:13:23,496
A fork and two spoons.

1631
02:13:24,246 --> 02:13:27,791
Let me go check in the kitchen.
Maybe I left some behind.

1632
02:13:27,958 --> 02:13:31,003
You know as well as I do that silver's
not in the kitchen.

1633
02:13:33,339 --> 02:13:35,591
You check in Mae Mobley's bed?

1634
02:13:36,717 --> 02:13:38,802
Since the Lil Man was born,
she been putting things...

1635
02:13:38,969 --> 02:13:40,721
Do you hear her, Elizabeth?

1636
02:13:41,764 --> 02:13:43,557
She's trying to blame it on a toddler.

1637
02:13:45,726 --> 02:13:47,394
I ain't got no silver.

1638
02:13:47,561 --> 02:13:49,647
She says she doesn't have them.

1639
02:13:50,147 --> 02:13:54,401
Then it behooves me to inform you
that you are fired, Aibileen.

1640
02:13:55,528 --> 02:13:57,696
And I'll be calling the police.

1641
02:13:59,615 --> 02:14:02,409
Aibee, my throat hurts.

1642
02:14:04,578 --> 02:14:07,289
I'll go get some syrup, Miss Leefolt.

1643
02:14:07,998 --> 02:14:10,501
Elizabeth can take care
of her own children.

1644
02:14:13,921 --> 02:14:16,757
- I'll go get the cough syrup.
- Come here, Lil Man.

1645
02:14:16,924 --> 02:14:18,342
I'm OK.

1646
02:14:28,727 --> 02:14:30,771
I didn't steal no silver.

1647
02:14:30,938 --> 02:14:34,650
Maybe I can't send you to jail
for what you wrote,

1648
02:14:34,817 --> 02:14:36,694
but I can send you for being a thief.

1649
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:39,280
I know something about you.
Don't you forget that.

1650
02:14:39,989 --> 02:14:43,117
From what Yule Mae says, there's a lot
of time to write letters in jail.

1651
02:14:43,284 --> 02:14:46,954
Plenty of time to write the truth about
you. And the paper is free.

1652
02:14:47,121 --> 02:14:50,165
- Nobody will believe what you wrote!
- I don't know!

1653
02:14:50,332 --> 02:14:53,627
I been told I'm a pretty good writer.
Already sold a lot of books.

1654
02:14:58,382 --> 02:15:00,551
Call the police, Elizabeth.

1655
02:15:01,302 --> 02:15:04,013
All you do is scare and lie
to try to get what you want.

1656
02:15:04,179 --> 02:15:05,180
Aibileen, stop!

1657
02:15:05,347 --> 02:15:07,391
You a godless woman.

1658
02:15:09,435 --> 02:15:11,520
Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly?

1659
02:15:14,189 --> 02:15:15,524
Ain't you tired?

1660
02:15:28,954 --> 02:15:31,373
Aibileen, you have to go now.

1661
02:15:46,013 --> 02:15:48,432
Don't go, Aibee.

1662
02:15:49,642 --> 02:15:51,977
Baby, you need to get back to bed.

1663
02:15:52,519 --> 02:15:56,565
- Please don't leave.
- I gots to, baby. I am so sorry.

1664
02:15:56,732 --> 02:15:59,485
Are you going to take care
of another little girl?

1665
02:15:59,652 --> 02:16:01,612
No, that's not the reason.

1666
02:16:01,779 --> 02:16:05,324
I don't want to leave you,
but it's time for me to retire.

1667
02:16:05,491 --> 02:16:07,743
- You're my last little girl.
- No!

1668
02:16:07,910 --> 02:16:09,912
Baby. Baby.

1669
02:16:10,913 --> 02:16:13,415
I need you to remember everything
I told you, OK?

1670
02:16:13,582 --> 02:16:15,709
- OK.
- You remember what I told you?

1671
02:16:15,876 --> 02:16:21,298
You is kind. You is smart.

1672
02:16:21,465 --> 02:16:23,133
You is important.

1673
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:25,177
That's right, Baby Girl.

1674
02:16:30,391 --> 02:16:31,850
Don't go, Aibee.

1675
02:16:32,017 --> 02:16:33,227
I gots to, baby.

1676
02:16:35,896 --> 02:16:37,815
You give my sweet girl a chance.

1677
02:16:54,123 --> 02:16:56,375
<i>Mae Mobley was my last baby.</i>

1678
02:16:58,836 --> 02:17:01,714
<i>In just ten minutes,
the only life I knew was done.</i>

1679
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:04,591
Aibee!

1680
02:17:07,845 --> 02:17:10,055
<i>God says we need to love our enemies.</i>

1681
02:17:10,222 --> 02:17:11,557
No!

1682
02:17:13,475 --> 02:17:14,810
<i>It hard to do.</i>

1683
02:17:21,066 --> 02:17:23,193
<i>But it can start by telling the truth.</i>

1684
02:17:28,365 --> 02:17:31,952
<i>No one had ever asked me
what it felt like to be me.</i>

1685
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:37,374
<i>Once I told the truth about that...</i>

1686
02:17:39,376 --> 02:17:41,044
<i>...I felt free.</i>

1687
02:17:49,470 --> 02:17:52,556
<i>And I got to thinking
about all the people I know.</i>

1688
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:56,602
<i>And the things I seen and done.</i>

1689
02:18:02,357 --> 02:18:06,695
<i>My boy, Treelore, always said we going
to have a writer in the family one day.</i>

1690
02:18:10,032 --> 02:18:12,159
<i>I guess it's gonna be me.</i>
