2
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,883
<i>Glinda, exactly how dead is she?

3
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:40,250
<i>Because there has been
so much rumor and speculation...

4
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,282
<i>...let me tell you
the whole story.

5
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,042
<i>According to the Time Dragon Clock...

6
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,991
<i>...the melting occurred at the 13th hour.

7
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:04,212
<i>The direct result of a bucket of water
thrown by a female child.

8
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:19,294
<i>Yes, the Wicked Witch
of the West is dead.

9
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:21,867
Good news. The Witch.
She's dead.

10
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:24,102
Come out.
She's gone.

11
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:25,996
She's dead.

12
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:29,812
Munchkins, wake up.

13
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:31,815
Watch out. Come on.
Come on.

14
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:37,249
Good news.
The Wicked Witch is dead.

15
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:41,679
<i>Good news...

16
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,800
<i>She's dead...

17
00:02:44,835 --> 00:02:46,771
<i>The Witch of the West is dead...

18
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,332
<i>The wickedest witch there ever was...

19
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,672
<i>The enemy of all of us here in Oz...

20
00:02:51,677 --> 00:02:55,853
<i>Is dead...

21
00:02:55,965 --> 00:03:00,591
<i>Good news...

22
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:04,318
<i>Good news...

23
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:10,786
<i>Let us be glad...

24
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:13,358
Look.
It's Glinda.

25
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:18,319
<i>Let us be grateful...

26
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:26,089
<i>Let us rejoicify...
That Goodness could subdue...

27
00:03:26,094 --> 00:03:34,502
<i>The wicked workings of you-know-who...

28
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:45,205
- Hi.
- Glinda.

29
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:48,704
It's good to see me,
isn't it?

30
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:50,641
Huh?

31
00:03:54,563 --> 00:03:58,459
Fellow Ozians,
let me set the record straight.

32
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,548
Yes...

33
00:04:03,447 --> 00:04:06,330
...the Wicked Witch
of the West is dead.

34
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:14,123
<i>Isn't it nice to know...

35
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:19,712
<i>That good will conquer evil?..

36
00:04:19,713 --> 00:04:23,466
<i>The truth we all believe'll...

37
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:28,679
<i>By and by...

38
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,935
<i>Outlive a lie...

39
00:04:33,936 --> 00:04:37,103
<i>For you and...

40
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:40,440
<i>No one mourns the Wicked...

41
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:43,693
<i>No one cries, "They won't return"...

42
00:04:43,694 --> 00:04:48,365
<i>No one lays a lily on their grave...

43
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:51,785
<i>The good man scorns the Wicked...

44
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:55,080
<i>Through their lives,
our children learn...

45
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:59,793
<i>What we miss
when we misbehave...

46
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:03,463
<i>And Goodness knows...

47
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:07,634
<i>The Wicked's lives are lonely...

48
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:10,178
<i>Goodness knows...

49
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:14,641
<i>The Wicked die alone...

50
00:05:14,642 --> 00:05:18,061
<i>It just shows when you're Wicked...

51
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:20,564
<i>You're left only...

52
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:23,394
<i>On your own...

53
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:27,803
<i>Yes, Goodness knows...

54
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:31,824
<i>The Wicked's lives are lonely...

55
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:34,326
<i>Goodness knows...

56
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:38,248
<i>The Wicked cry alone...

57
00:05:38,748 --> 00:05:42,059
<i>Nothing grows for the Wicked...

58
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:45,075
<i>They reap only...

59
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:46,870
<i>...what they've sown...

60
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,204
- But, Miss Glinda?
- Yes?

61
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:51,958
Why does Wickedness happen?

62
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:56,832
That's a good question.

63
00:05:56,911 --> 00:06:00,060
One many people find confusifying.

64
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,427
Are people born Wicked?

65
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:05,273
Or do they have Wickedness
thrust upon them?

66
00:06:06,297 --> 00:06:09,812
After all, the Wicked Witch
had a childhood.

67
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:11,225
She had a father...

68
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,157
...who, by the way, had been appointed
governor of Munchkinland.

69
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,848
I'm off to the Assembly, dear.

70
00:06:15,883 --> 00:06:18,090
<i>And she had a mother,
as so many do.

71
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:22,081
<i>How I hate to go
and leave you lonely...

72
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:26,197
<i>That's all right,
it's only just one night...

73
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,915
<i>But know that
you're here in my heart...

74
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:37,415
<i>While I'm out of your sight...

75
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:40,151
<i>Like every family...

76
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,311
<i>...they had their secrets.

77
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:49,233
Oh.

78
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:59,701
<i>Have another drink,
my dark-eyed beauty...

79
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:02,579
<i>I've got one more night left
here in town...

80
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,916
<i>So have another drink
of green elixir...

81
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:09,253
<i>And we'll have ourselves a little mixer...

82
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:12,089
<i>Have another little swallow,
little lady...

83
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,756
<i>And follow me down...

84
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,755
<i>And one thing led to another...

85
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:20,688
...as it so often does.

86
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,852
<i>But from the moment
the Witch was born, she was...

87
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:25,811
Dulcibear.

88
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,446
<i>...well...

89
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:29,124
<i>...different.

90
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:30,518
It's coming.

91
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:31,066
Now?

92
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,097
The baby's coming.

93
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:33,694
And how?

94
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:35,269
<i>I see a nose...

95
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:36,737
<i>I see a curl...

96
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:41,457
<i>It's a healthy, perfect,
lovely, little...

97
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,527
Oh, sweet Oz.

98
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,154
What is it?
What's wrong?

99
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:48,878
<i>- How can it be?..
- What does it mean?..

100
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:54,008
<i>- It's uncanny...
- It's obscene...

101
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:56,361
<i>Like a froggy, ferny cabbage...

102
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:59,618
<i>The baby is unnaturally...

103
00:08:02,136 --> 00:08:03,928
...green.

104
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:16,012
Take it away.

105
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:25,978
Take it away.

106
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:38,715
It's all right, little one.

107
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:41,627
We'll look after you.

108
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:48,005
<i>So, her nanny,
Dulcibear, raised her.

109
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:52,464
<i>And as she grew,
so did her challenges.

110
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:54,189
Dulcibear.

111
00:08:54,593 --> 00:08:55,940
Coming, Governor.

112
00:08:56,379 --> 00:09:00,163
Little one, watch your baby sister.
Just a clock tick.

113
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:06,784
Oh, Nessarose.
Don't you worry. I'm here.

114
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:09,370
Now, you want to see
something amazing?

115
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,287
Yeah.

116
00:09:10,335 --> 00:09:14,498
This is all about
our wonderful Wizard of Oz.

117
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:16,418
Do you know how he got here?

118
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:17,978
No.

119
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:21,894
From the sky.
In a balloon. See?

120
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:25,836
Then, he built a city
made of emeralds...

121
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:28,250
...'cause he loves emeralds.

122
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,266
Even though they are green.

123
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:33,518
And, Nessa,
you want to know a secret?

124
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,821
If you get to meet him,
he grants your heart's desire.

125
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,151
Elphaba Thropp, green on top.

126
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:44,907
Someone run and tell her,
that everyone can smell her.

127
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:48,534
- Ew, green and ugly?
- She's so green.

128
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:51,703
Where did you come from?
You don't belong here.

129
00:09:55,124 --> 00:09:57,917
- She's as green as the trees.
- I do not like that.

130
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,404
So green.

131
00:10:07,098 --> 00:10:09,001
Stop.

132
00:10:10,354 --> 00:10:11,607
Elphaba.

133
00:10:11,996 --> 00:10:13,583
Elphaba Thropp.

134
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:15,697
What have you done this time?

135
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:17,600
Oh. That's okay.
Come to Daddy.

136
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:19,606
And now you've made your sister cry.

137
00:10:19,747 --> 00:10:23,382
Let's go get you a beautiful piece
of cake for the beautiful girl.

138
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,872
It's all right, little one.
He shouldn't have blamed you.

139
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:29,720
Dulcibear.

140
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,502
<i>And so...

141
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:39,675
...it couldn't have been easy.

142
00:10:40,835 --> 00:10:46,189
<i>No one mourns the Wicked...

143
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:51,428
<i>Now at last, she's dead and gone...

144
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:56,871
<i>Now at last there's joy
throughout the land...

145
00:10:57,091 --> 00:11:03,924
<i>- And Goodness knows...
- Goodness knows...

146
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:06,860
<i>We know what Goodness is...

147
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,563
<i>Goodness knows...

148
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:11,682
<i>The Wicked die alone...

149
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,285
<i>- She died alone...
- Woe to those...

150
00:11:15,286 --> 00:11:17,621
<i>Woe to those...

151
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:20,331
<i>Who spurn what goodnesses...

152
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:26,212
<i>They are shown...

153
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:28,936
<i>No one mourns the Wicked...

154
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:32,737
<i>Good news...

155
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:35,612
<i>No one mourns the Wicked...

156
00:11:35,617 --> 00:11:38,622
<i>Good news...

157
00:11:40,017 --> 00:11:46,617
<i>No one mourns the Wicked...

158
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:50,863
<i>Wicked...

159
00:11:53,133 --> 00:12:00,880
<i>Wicked...

160
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,243
Yep.

161
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:11,581
Well, this has been fun.

162
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:12,549
As you can imagine...

163
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,343
...I have much to attend to
with the Wizard's unexpected departure.

164
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:19,713
So if there are no further questions,
I'm gonna go.

165
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,916
Glinda...

166
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:24,160
...is it true you were her friend?

167
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,650
What?

168
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:27,376
Sorry.
One sec.

169
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:30,247
What?

170
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:33,058
Is it true you were her friend?

171
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:38,073
Friend?

172
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,016
Yes.

173
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:45,243
I... I mean,
I did know her.

174
00:12:47,108 --> 00:12:48,571
That is...

175
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:51,414
...our paths did cross.

176
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:04,096
At school.

177
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,322
<i>But you must understand...

178
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,641
<i>...it was a long time ago.

179
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:01,585
Hi.

180
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,034
- Oh, it's Galinda.
- Hi, Galinda.

181
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:06,719
Oh, we're so proud of you.

182
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:09,472
Thank you. I love you.
Just remember...

183
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:11,745
- ...it's not goodbye, it's farewell.
- We love you.

184
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,955
- You have all your cases?
- Yes.

185
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,394
- And you will write?
- Yes.

186
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:16,510
- I love you. It's that time.
- My darling.

187
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:17,580
Miss you already.

188
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:19,183
Popsicle, board the boat.

189
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:21,908
They are gonna miss me
so much.

190
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:24,125
My parents don't even know I left.

191
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:29,084
I'm Boq.

192
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:31,276
I'm from Munchkinland.

193
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:34,262
I know we don't really know
each other yet...

194
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:36,144
- ...but...
- You know what I believe, Bick?

195
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:38,471
It's Bick.
It's Boq.

196
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:40,819
That strangers...

197
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:42,789
...are just people I've never met.

198
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,830
Bye.

199
00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:53,514
<i>O hallowed halls
and vine-draped walls...

200
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:58,562
<i>- The proudliest sight there is...
- Sight there is...

201
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:03,500
<i>When gray and sere,
our hair hath turned...

202
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,554
<i>We shall still revere,
the lessons learned...

203
00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:13,781
<i>In our days at dear old Shiz...

204
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:18,754
<i>Our days at dear old...

205
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:25,767
<i>...old...

206
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:33,809
<i>- ...Shiz...
- Dear old Shiz...

207
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:36,999
Oh, Oz.

208
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,734
What?
What are you staring at?

209
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,611
Do I have something
in my teeth?

210
00:15:43,048 --> 00:15:44,629
No, it's just...

211
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,083
You're green.

212
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:50,528
I am?

213
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:59,187
Fine.
Let's get this over with.

214
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,348
No, I am not seasick.

215
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:04,609
No, I did not eat grass as a child.

216
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:06,266
And, yes...

217
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:08,283
...I've always been green.

218
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:10,855
Well...

219
00:16:11,462 --> 00:16:14,297
...I, for one, am so sorry...

220
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:18,320
...that you have been forced to live with...

221
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,405
...this.

222
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,434
Is that so?

223
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,732
Yes.

224
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:26,047
And it is my intention...

225
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:27,966
...to major in sorcery.

226
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:32,281
So, if at some point,
you wanted to address the... um...

227
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:34,921
...problem.

228
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,263
Problem.

229
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:39,101
Perhaps I could help.

230
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:43,480
- She's so good. She's so good.
- You're so good. We love you.

231
00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:47,944
Thank you.

232
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,366
All right.

233
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:54,992
Offering to help someone
that you don't know...

234
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:57,067
...with skills that you don't have.

235
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:00,152
I'm sure everyone is duly impressed.

236
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,840
I could care less
what others think.

237
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:03,459
- Couldn't.
- What?

238
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,577
You 'couldn't' care less
what other people think.

239
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:08,076
Though, I...

240
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:09,763
...I doubt that.

241
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:11,451
Elphaba.

242
00:17:11,612 --> 00:17:13,173
Elphaba Thropp.

243
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:16,555
This is my younger sister,
Nessarose.

244
00:17:16,698 --> 00:17:19,289
As you can see,
she's a perfectly acceptable color.

245
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:25,184
- Oh, my God.
- Stop making a spectacle of yourself.

246
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,731
I was trying to be nice.

247
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:28,958
- You were so nice and good and correct.
- Did I do something bad?

248
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:29,776
- I was...
- No.

249
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:32,183
- How did that come across?
- I don't see colors, but...

250
00:17:33,756 --> 00:17:35,092
My precious little girl.

251
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:36,510
Father.

252
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:40,267
A parting gift.

253
00:17:45,643 --> 00:17:47,980
Mother's jeweled shoes.

254
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:54,500
So they can all see how beautiful you are
right down to your toes.

255
00:17:54,535 --> 00:17:56,007
Thank you.

256
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:58,555
Thank you so much.
I love them.

257
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:00,685
Let me put them with your boxes.

258
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,142
Of course.

259
00:18:05,629 --> 00:18:07,713
I shouldn't have sprouted off like that.

260
00:18:08,606 --> 00:18:10,629
No, you shouldn't have.

261
00:18:12,477 --> 00:18:13,577
Today is...

262
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:15,380
The start of your new life.

263
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:18,827
New friends.

264
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,702
New books.

265
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,121
I'm excited for you.

266
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,762
I'll miss you.

267
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:27,883
No, you won't.

268
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:29,865
You'll be having too good a time.

269
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:36,633
<i>All new Shiz students...

270
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:38,443
<i>...please report to the quad.

271
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,303
- Don't help her.
- Don't help me.

272
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:44,788
She'll be fine.

273
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:50,783
<i>All new Shiz students,
please report to the quad.

274
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:58,021
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you too.

275
00:18:58,489 --> 00:18:59,896
We should head back.

276
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,457
- Go with her.
- What?

277
00:19:01,822 --> 00:19:04,119
Just until she's safely settled
in her room.

278
00:19:04,124 --> 00:19:06,852
Make sure she has everything she needs.

279
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:08,247
Father, she's on her own now.

280
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,749
- I can't just...
- Just stop jabbering.

281
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,432
Just do what I say.

282
00:19:13,616 --> 00:19:15,759
If anything should happen to her...

283
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:29,225
Thank you for your
contribution to our university.

284
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:34,232
And rounding out the rest of our faculty,
we have two scholars...

285
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:39,486
...eminent in their respective fields
of forestry and agriculture...

286
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:44,282
...as well as Professor Mombi
of the Biological Arts...

287
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:48,699
...and, of course, the head of our
History department, Dr. Dillamond.

288
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,084
You know,
except for our wonderful Wizard...

289
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:57,087
...true magic has
become all too rare...

290
00:19:57,088 --> 00:20:03,385
...which is why we are privileged to have
our esteemed Dean of Sorcery Studies...

291
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:04,970
...Madame Morrible.

292
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:23,300
Could you...

293
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:26,198
I don't...

294
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:28,534
Oh, my goodness.
It's really her.

295
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:39,420
Welcome, new students.

296
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:44,006
And congratulotions
for having been accepted to Shiz.

297
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:49,184
Whether you'll be studying law,
logic or linguification...

298
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:53,375
...I know I speak for
my fellow faculty members...

299
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:59,064
...when I say we have
nothing but the highest hopes...

300
00:20:59,602 --> 00:21:01,412
...for some of you.

301
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,738
And now, Miss Coddle, if you please.

302
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:10,617
I am Miss Coddle, Head Shizstress.

303
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:15,230
And these are your dormitory designations
and room assignments.

304
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:21,297
Good luck,
and welcome to Shiz.

305
00:21:31,764 --> 00:21:33,299
Madame Morrible, hi.

306
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:37,852
I am Galinda Upland,
of the Upper Uplands.

307
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:40,446
If this is regarding room assignments...

308
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:43,736
Oh, thank you so much, but I've already
been assigned a private suite.

309
00:21:43,771 --> 00:21:46,347
This is about my application
to your sorcery seminar.

310
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:50,684
Perhaps you recall my essay,
"Magic Wands, need they have a point?"

311
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,693
Well, dear, I don't teach
my seminar every semester.

312
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:58,247
Of course, if someone very special
were to come along.

313
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,847
Exactly. This is why
I wanted to talk to you. Um...

314
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,438
We'll be in touch.

315
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:06,332
There you are.

316
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:09,842
- Miss Nessarose, isn't it?
- Yes.

317
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:11,218
The Governor's daughter?

318
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:16,019
How tragically beautiful you are.

319
00:22:16,024 --> 00:22:18,766
It is such an honor to...

320
00:22:19,936 --> 00:22:21,145
I'm the other daughter.

321
00:22:21,146 --> 00:22:23,002
I'm beautifully tragic.

322
00:22:23,394 --> 00:22:25,950
The other... daughter?

323
00:22:25,985 --> 00:22:27,751
Elphaba.
What are you doing?

324
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:30,740
Well... I wasn't made aware.

325
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:33,484
- I know. I was just...
- Not to fret.

326
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,761
Just a slight gulch.

327
00:22:36,846 --> 00:22:39,178
We'll find some place to hide you.

328
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,304
I mean, house you.

329
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,595
That won't be necessary.

330
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:46,809
- I'm not enrolled.
- Oh, good.

331
00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:48,479
Why are you still here?

332
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:49,922
I'm sorry, Nessa.
Father insisted...

333
00:22:49,923 --> 00:22:53,064
Oh, the Governor made his concern
for your sister quite apparent.

334
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:56,262
- Wait.
- Please assure him I am honored to help her.

335
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:59,282
- She doesn't need your help.
- Stop. I just need to find my room.

336
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,185
- I'll bring you there myself.
- Miss Coddle, I...

337
00:23:02,186 --> 00:23:04,979
- Now, you have an entire staff...
- Miss Coddle, I promised my father that...

338
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,523
- ...at your disposal 24 hours a day...
- Just stop, Miss Coddle...

339
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:09,192
- ...seven days a week...
- She can do it alone.

340
00:23:09,193 --> 00:23:10,776
- ...365 days...
- Please, you don't understand.

341
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:12,190
Stop.

342
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,017
Let her go.

343
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,168
No.

344
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:54,761
This was my chance,
my new start.

345
00:23:55,512 --> 00:23:57,298
I'm sorry, Nessa.
I just...

346
00:23:58,241 --> 00:23:59,324
I didn't...

347
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,314
Magic is merely
the mind's attempt...

348
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:07,126
...to wrap itself
around the impossible.

349
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:10,848
Yes, that was me.

350
00:24:12,545 --> 00:24:19,227
To prepare you to expect
the unexpected here at Shiz.

351
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:27,445
- Did you visually see that?
- Yeah.

352
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,103
I simply must get into her seminar.

353
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:33,829
And speaking...
of the unexpected.

354
00:24:40,532 --> 00:24:44,493
Which of you would volunteer
to share a room with...

355
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:47,438
Madame Morrible...
um...

356
00:24:47,473 --> 00:24:49,082
Thank you, dear.

357
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:50,999
That is very good of you.

358
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:52,430
What?

359
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,964
- Miss...
- Elphaba.

360
00:24:58,257 --> 00:24:59,790
Elphaba.

361
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:03,178
You can room with Miss Galinda.

362
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,809
What? I...
What?

363
00:25:04,814 --> 00:25:08,368
Now, go.
All of you, go.

364
00:25:10,227 --> 00:25:11,428
Go.

365
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:13,312
And you.

366
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,557
- Come with me.
- Of course.

367
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,384
Not you.

368
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:22,163
You.

369
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:36,247
I would like to teach you privately
and take no other students.

370
00:25:36,252 --> 00:25:38,588
Uh... Thank you so much.

371
00:25:41,216 --> 00:25:43,041
- What happened?
- What happened?

372
00:25:43,363 --> 00:25:45,704
Something is very wrong.

373
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:47,421
I didn't get my way.

374
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:49,731
- I need to lie down.
- Yes.

375
00:25:49,802 --> 00:25:50,682
- I need to lie down.
- Get her.

376
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,059
- Go, go, go.
- Just get her.

377
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,727
- How?
- We need a pastry.

378
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:54,901
We need a pastry.

379
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:56,814
Thank you for covering for me.

380
00:25:56,815 --> 00:25:59,474
And I'm humbled
by your munificent offer...

381
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:01,168
...but my father
would never allow it.

382
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:04,572
Leave your father to me.
I'll speak to him immediately.

383
00:26:05,073 --> 00:26:09,737
So, how long have you
had this talent?

384
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:11,495
Talent... uh...

385
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:13,406
No...

386
00:26:13,496 --> 00:26:15,164
Something just...

387
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,562
Something just takes over me, and...

388
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:21,055
Something I can't control.

389
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:22,997
And when it does...

390
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:24,982
...bad things happen.

391
00:26:30,514 --> 00:26:35,501
If you can learn to use your powers
in the right way...

392
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:39,819
...Miss Elphaba...

393
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,399
<i>Many years I have waited
for a gift like yours to appear...

394
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,369
<i>Why, I predict the Wizard might make you
His Magic Grand Vizier...

395
00:26:53,456 --> 00:26:54,900
The Wizard?

396
00:26:54,913 --> 00:27:00,475
<i>My dear, my dear,
I'll write at once to the Wizard...

397
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:04,413
<i>Tell him of you in advance...

398
00:27:04,428 --> 00:27:10,777
<i>With a talent like yours, dear,
there is a definish chance...

399
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:14,910
<i>If you work as you should...

400
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:20,396
<i>You'll be making good...

401
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:26,155
Welcome to Shiz.

402
00:27:28,594 --> 00:27:30,290
See you in class.

403
00:27:36,954 --> 00:27:38,960
<i>Did that really just happen?..

404
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:42,941
<i>Have I actually understood?..

405
00:27:43,503 --> 00:27:48,441
<i>This weird quirk I've tried
to suppress or... hide...

406
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:56,758
<i>Is a talent that could help me
meet the Wizard...

407
00:27:57,557 --> 00:28:02,971
<i>If I make good...

408
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:11,460
<i>So... I'll make good...

409
00:28:13,365 --> 00:28:16,122
<i>When I meet the Wizard...

410
00:28:16,706 --> 00:28:18,979
<i>Once I prove my worth...

411
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,519
<i>Then I meet the Wizard...

412
00:28:22,554 --> 00:28:25,659
<i>What I've waited for since...
since birth...

413
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:28,754
<i>And with all his Wizard wisdom...

414
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:32,463
<i>By my looks, he won't be blinded...

415
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,892
<i>Do you think the Wizard is dumb?..

416
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:39,346
<i>Or like Munchkins, so small-minded?
No...

417
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:42,767
<i>He'll say to me,
"I see who you truly are..."

418
00:28:42,802 --> 00:28:45,662
<i>"A girl on whom I can rely..."

419
00:28:45,697 --> 00:28:48,732
<i>And that's how we'll begin...

420
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:52,806
<i>The Wizard and I...

421
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:03,152
<i>Once I'm with the Wizard,
my whole life will change...

422
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:08,971
<i>'Cause once you're with the Wizard,
no one thinks you're strange...

423
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:12,313
<i>No father is not proud of you...

424
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:16,171
<i>No sister acts ashamed...

425
00:29:16,206 --> 00:29:22,506
<i>And all of Oz has to love you
when, by the Wizard, you're acclaimed...

426
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:26,232
<i>And this gift or this curse
I have inside...

427
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:29,092
<i>Maybe at last,
I'll know why...

428
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:31,999
<i>As we work hand in hand...

429
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,222
<i>The Wizard and I...

430
00:29:36,257 --> 00:29:42,774
<i>And one day, he'll say to me,
"Elphaba, a girl who is so superior..."

431
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:48,499
<i>"Shouldn't a girl who's so good inside
have a matching exterior?.."

432
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,561
<i>"And since folks here
to an absurd degree..."

433
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:56,011
<i>"Seem fixated on your verdigris..."

434
00:29:56,046 --> 00:30:00,119
<i>"Would it be all right by you..."

435
00:30:00,154 --> 00:30:05,647
<i>"If I de-greenify you?.."

436
00:30:05,652 --> 00:30:08,908
<i>And though, of course,
that's not important to me...

437
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,184
<i>"All right, why not?"
I'll reply...

438
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:14,916
<i>Oh, what a pair we'll be...

439
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:19,125
<i>The Wizard and I...

440
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,965
<i>Yes, what a pair we'll be...

441
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,897
<i>The Wizard and...

442
00:30:35,504 --> 00:30:39,483
<i>Unlimited...

443
00:30:39,518 --> 00:30:44,383
<i>My future is unlimited...

444
00:30:44,418 --> 00:30:49,100
<i>And I've just had a vision
almost like a prophecy...

445
00:30:49,132 --> 00:30:53,756
<i>I know...
It sounds truly crazy...

446
00:30:54,564 --> 00:30:57,939
<i>And true, the vision's hazy...

447
00:30:58,298 --> 00:31:05,307
<i>But I swear, someday there'll be
a celebration throughout Oz...

448
00:31:05,342 --> 00:31:07,392
<i>That's all to do...

449
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:15,774
<i>With me...

450
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:21,152
<i>And I'll stand there
with the Wizard...

451
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:25,504
<i>Feeling things
I've never felt...

452
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:31,559
<i>And though I'd never show it
I'd be so happy, I could melt...

453
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:34,881
<i>And so it will be
for the rest of my life...

454
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:37,871
<i>And I'll want
nothing else till I die...

455
00:31:37,884 --> 00:31:41,344
<i>Held in such high esteem...

456
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:45,811
<i>When people see me,
they will scream...

457
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:52,673
<i>For half of Oz's favorite team...

458
00:31:54,618 --> 00:31:57,206
<i>The Wizard...

459
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:10,247
<i>And I...

Corrected & Arranged by BANQUO
(alacayel@gmail.com)

461
00:32:33,514 --> 00:32:35,381
Come in.

462
00:32:41,477 --> 00:32:44,068
The rest of my bags
should be arriving shortly.

463
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:50,051
Do you really think this is fair?

464
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:54,504
Oh, I do not.
I was promised a private suite.

465
00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:56,762
But thanks for asking.

466
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,037
- Wait. Uh...
- What?

467
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:02,481
- What?
- I was just...

468
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,571
I was just gonna close the door.

469
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:12,413
Oh, well, could you not? I'm sorry.
I just... I so enjoy air.

470
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,083
You know what I mean?

471
00:33:21,186 --> 00:33:23,537
Oh, I saved you some space by the way.

472
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:27,074
<i>Here it is...

473
00:33:27,358 --> 00:33:29,042
Just in here.

474
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,255
It's great.

475
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:45,877
It was nothing.

476
00:33:45,912 --> 00:33:48,236
Roommates do these things for each other.

477
00:33:48,596 --> 00:33:50,147
So I've been told.

478
00:33:54,522 --> 00:33:58,055
And in return,
perhaps you could... um...

479
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,076
Let's see.

480
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:02,577
Put in a good word for me
with Madame Morrible? Deal?

481
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:07,935
That was you down there
who made all that happen.

482
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,373
I know it was.

483
00:34:09,408 --> 00:34:10,912
You heard Madame Morrible.

484
00:34:15,063 --> 00:34:16,462
How did you do it?

485
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,869
Tell me, please.
I can keep a secret.

486
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:21,915
Fine.

487
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,559
Be that way.

488
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:25,511
But it really is
rather selfish on your part.

489
00:34:25,553 --> 00:34:27,850
You know, I asked really nicely,
and I saved you this whole drawer...

490
00:34:27,855 --> 00:34:29,673
I don't know.
I've never known.

491
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,719
There.
Enjoy the air.

492
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,182
<i>Dearest, darlingest
Momsie and Popsicle...

493
00:34:50,828 --> 00:34:51,878
My dear father...

494
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:54,889
Thank you for agreeing
to let me stay.

495
00:34:55,124 --> 00:34:56,412
Guess what?

496
00:34:56,417 --> 00:35:00,166
In regards to our request
that I move in with Nessa...

497
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:07,245
I can't hear your guesses,
because this is a letter.

498
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:10,381
I know how much she wants to be...

499
00:35:13,976 --> 00:35:15,680
So I'll just tell you.

500
00:35:16,737 --> 00:35:21,074
<i>There's been some confusion
over rooming here at Shiz...

501
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:23,659
<i>But of course,
I'll care for Nessa...

502
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,624
<i>But of course, I'll rise above it...

503
00:35:27,681 --> 00:35:31,667
<i>For I know that's how
you'd want me to respond...

504
00:35:31,925 --> 00:35:33,522
- Yes.
- Yes.

505
00:35:33,816 --> 00:35:39,701
<i>There's been some confusion
for you see, my roommate is...

506
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:45,811
<i>Unusually and exceedingly peculiar...

507
00:35:45,816 --> 00:35:52,400
<i>And altogether
quite impossible to describe...

508
00:35:53,858 --> 00:35:55,498
Blonde.

509
00:36:03,256 --> 00:36:04,425
<i>What is this feeling...

510
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,835
<i>So sudden and new?..

511
00:36:06,428 --> 00:36:09,192
<i>I felt the moment
I laid eyes on you...

512
00:36:09,491 --> 00:36:10,924
<i>My pulse is rushing...

513
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,073
<i>My head is reeling...

514
00:36:12,093 --> 00:36:14,035
<i>Yeah, well, my face is flushing...

515
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,739
<i>What is this feeling?..

516
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,802
<i>Fervid as a flame...

517
00:36:18,837 --> 00:36:21,883
<i>Does it have a name?..

518
00:36:21,884 --> 00:36:28,370
<i>Yes...

519
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:29,557
<i>Loathing...

520
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,625
<i>Unadulterated loathing...

521
00:36:32,811 --> 00:36:33,812
<i>For your face...

522
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,880
<i>- Your voice...
- Your clothing...

523
00:36:35,915 --> 00:36:39,285
<i>Let's just say,
I loathe it all...

524
00:36:39,944 --> 00:36:46,197
<i>Every little trait, however small,
makes my very flesh begin to crawl...

525
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:48,343
<i>With simple utter loathing...

526
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:54,737
<i>There's a strange exhilaration
in such total detestation...

527
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:58,973
<i>It's so pure, so strong...

528
00:36:58,978 --> 00:37:02,064
<i>Though I do admit it came on fast...

529
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,286
<i>Still I do believe
that it can last...

530
00:37:05,321 --> 00:37:07,386
<i>And I will be loathing...

531
00:37:07,487 --> 00:37:08,982
<i>Loathing you...

532
00:37:08,987 --> 00:37:12,908
<i>My whole life long...

533
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:15,953
<i>Dear Galinda,
you are just too good...

534
00:37:16,024 --> 00:37:18,559
<i>How do you stand it?
I don't think I could...

535
00:37:18,594 --> 00:37:20,249
<i>She's a terror,
she's a Tartar...

536
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:24,119
<i>We don't mean to show a bias,
but, Galinda, you're a martyr...

537
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:25,404
<i>Well...

538
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:32,936
<i>These things are
sent to try us...

539
00:37:40,377 --> 00:37:46,222
<i>Poor Galinda, forced to reside
with someone so disgustikified...

540
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:51,783
<i>We just want to tell you
we're all on your side...

541
00:37:51,788 --> 00:37:54,307
<i>- We share your loathing...
- What is this feeling...

542
00:37:54,342 --> 00:37:56,213
<i>- So sudden and new?..
- Unadulterated loathing...

543
00:37:56,218 --> 00:37:58,715
<i>- I felt the moment I laid eyes on you...
- For her face...

544
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,496
<i>- Her voice, her clothing...
- My pulse is rushing...

545
00:38:00,597 --> 00:38:02,485
<i>- My head is reeling...
- Let's just say...

546
00:38:02,591 --> 00:38:05,568
<i>- We loathe it all...
- Oh, what is this feeling?..

547
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,971
<i>- Every little trait, however small...
- Does it have a name?..

548
00:38:07,979 --> 00:38:12,233
<i>- Makes our very flesh begin to crawl...
- Yes...

549
00:38:15,078 --> 00:38:16,492
<i>- Loathing...
- Loathing...

550
00:38:16,497 --> 00:38:19,749
<i>- There's a strange exhilaration...
- Loathing...

551
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,164
<i>- In such total detestation...
- Loathing...

552
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:26,793
<i>- It's so pure, so strong...
- So strong...

553
00:38:26,798 --> 00:38:29,808
<i>Though I do admit
it came on fast...

554
00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:33,065
<i>Still I do believe
that it can last...

555
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:37,243
<i>- And I will be loathing for forever...
- Loathing...

556
00:38:37,278 --> 00:38:40,243
<i>- Loathing truly, deeply...
- Loathing...

557
00:38:40,316 --> 00:38:45,315
<i>- Loathing you...
- Loathing, loathing you...

558
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:50,646
<i>- My whole life long...
- Loathing... Unadulterated loathing...

559
00:38:55,569 --> 00:38:56,747
Boo.

560
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,836
All right. All right, everyone.
Settle down.

561
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:21,934
Ladies and gentlemen,
settle down.

562
00:39:22,135 --> 00:39:24,650
Quiet! Quiet, everyone.

563
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:26,021
Now then...

564
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:29,024
...I have read your most recent essays...

565
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:32,528
...and I am amazed
to report some progress.

566
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:34,410
- Although, some of us...
- Thank you.

567
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:38,845
...still tend to favor
form over content, Miss Glinda.

568
00:39:39,661 --> 00:39:43,590
Oh, actually, it's Galinda.
With a "Ga."

569
00:39:44,305 --> 00:39:46,623
Yes, of course.

570
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:48,586
Glinda.

571
00:39:48,828 --> 00:39:50,279
- No.
- Not even close.

572
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,288
Um... I don't see
what the problem is.

573
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:55,740
You know, every other professor
manages to pronouncify my name.

574
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:58,321
Maybe the pronuncifi-cation
of your precious name...

575
00:39:58,326 --> 00:40:00,880
...is not the sole focus
of Dr. Dillamond's life.

576
00:40:00,893 --> 00:40:04,117
Maybe Dr. Dillamond
is not like every other professor.

577
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:07,427
Maybe some of us are just different.

578
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:12,143
Well, it seems the artichoke
is steamed.

579
00:40:12,178 --> 00:40:13,276
Oh, my...

580
00:40:13,685 --> 00:40:16,130
The worst way to cook an artichoke.

581
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:19,109
Quiet, please.
Please.

582
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:22,760
Yes, we goats lack
upper front teeth...

583
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:26,644
...which accounts for the mispronunciation,
Miss Glinda.

584
00:40:29,328 --> 00:40:31,667
You see, indeed...

585
00:40:32,191 --> 00:40:34,219
...some of us are different.

586
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:41,038
Now, you may have noticed that I am one of
the last animal professors here at Shiz.

587
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:45,797
And it isn't encouraged
to discuss this in our classes, but...

588
00:40:45,963 --> 00:40:51,381
...there have been some great changes
throughout Oz with the rejection of animal culture.

589
00:40:51,856 --> 00:40:55,388
However, there was a time,
before you were born,

590
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:58,456
...when life in Oz was different.

591
00:41:00,315 --> 00:41:05,205
When one could walk these halls and
hear a snow leopard solving an equation...

592
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,381
...or an antelope explicating a sonnet.

593
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:13,093
So, when and why
did this change?

594
00:41:13,128 --> 00:41:14,887
From what I've read,
the Great Drought.

595
00:41:15,629 --> 00:41:18,298
- Okay, excuse me.
- Like, raise your hand.

596
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:19,955
Precisely.

597
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:21,935
Food grew scarce.

598
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:24,470
And when people are hungry and angry...

599
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:27,833
- ...well, then they begin to look for...
- ...someone to blame.

600
00:41:28,731 --> 00:41:31,157
Quite right, Miss Elphaba.

601
00:41:34,831 --> 00:41:37,441
Yes, Miss Glinda?

602
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,125
It is Galinda.

603
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,355
Galinda. Galinda.

604
00:41:42,392 --> 00:41:44,423
And I don't see why
you can't just teach us history...

605
00:41:44,443 --> 00:41:46,840
...instead of always
harping on the past.

606
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,576
Because we cannot escape the past...

607
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:53,587
...and we ignore it at our own peril.

608
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:57,211
The past helps explain
our present circumstances.

609
00:41:57,212 --> 00:42:00,944
For instance,
if we examine this timeline...

610
00:42:16,669 --> 00:42:19,340
Who is responsible for this?

611
00:42:25,031 --> 00:42:29,325
I asked, who is responsible for this?

612
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:36,610
Very well.
Class dismissed.

613
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:40,831
I said, class dismissed.

614
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:53,479
Dr. Dillamond.

615
00:42:54,098 --> 00:42:55,758
Miss Elphaba.

616
00:42:58,426 --> 00:43:00,692
Miss Elphaba,
you don't have to...

617
00:43:02,503 --> 00:43:05,180
Thank you.
You're very kind.

618
00:43:12,886 --> 00:43:14,383
Not bad.

619
00:43:18,923 --> 00:43:21,018
Poppies are my favorite.

620
00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:22,654
Mine too.

621
00:43:23,745 --> 00:43:26,717
They keep me cheerful
in these dark times.

622
00:43:29,052 --> 00:43:32,391
Miss Elphaba, please.
Go and join your friends.

623
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:34,507
That's all right.
I don't have any friends.

624
00:43:34,808 --> 00:43:37,787
Well, maybe one.

625
00:43:53,058 --> 00:43:54,727
<i>Try again.

626
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:58,082
Eyes shut.

627
00:43:58,414 --> 00:44:00,538
Toes clenched.

628
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:03,446
Now...

629
00:44:04,523 --> 00:44:06,550
...levitate the coin.

630
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,720
It's all right.

631
00:44:47,086 --> 00:44:49,097
It takes time.

632
00:44:56,478 --> 00:45:03,103
I hear there was an unfortunate
disturbance in Dr. Dillamond's class today.

633
00:45:07,564 --> 00:45:10,395
That must have been
so distressful for you.

634
00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:11,890
Well...

635
00:45:12,368 --> 00:45:14,748
...someone wrote those
horrendible words...

636
00:45:15,072 --> 00:45:17,842
...on purpose,
for him to see.

637
00:45:20,744 --> 00:45:22,281
I just wish I could...

638
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:24,206
What?

639
00:45:24,371 --> 00:45:26,155
You wish what?

640
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,909
I wish there were something I could do.
Because no one...

641
00:45:31,076 --> 00:45:33,630
No one... Do what?

642
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,352
No one should be scorned...

643
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:41,900
...or laughed at.

644
00:45:45,103 --> 00:45:47,301
Or looked down upon,
or...

645
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:52,565
...told to stop jabbering
and keep quiet.

646
00:45:58,745 --> 00:46:00,359
Remarkable.

647
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:03,075
Absolutely remarkable.

648
00:46:04,587 --> 00:46:07,627
Once you learn to harness your emotion...

649
00:46:08,992 --> 00:46:11,129
...the sky's the limit.

650
00:46:11,392 --> 00:46:14,264
It could lead you
to the Wizard himself.

651
00:46:22,555 --> 00:46:26,017
- Have a good night, Dr. Dillamond.
- Goodbye, Dr. Dillamond.

652
00:46:32,273 --> 00:46:33,783
Dr. Dillamond.

653
00:46:34,732 --> 00:46:36,178
Did you find out who...

654
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:48,037
<i>...yet another incident here at Shiz.

655
00:46:48,122 --> 00:46:52,983
<i>We animals are now being blamed
for everything that goes wrong.

656
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:56,023
Forced from our jobs,
told to keep silent.

657
00:46:56,058 --> 00:46:59,760
This is much bigger
than just some words on a chalkboard.

658
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,266
We can still converse in private,
thank Oz.

659
00:47:03,301 --> 00:47:04,403
A deer friend of mine...

660
00:47:04,453 --> 00:47:06,629
- A deer?
- A cow, actually.

661
00:47:06,664 --> 00:47:08,961
She's been speaking out at protests.

662
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:12,187
Recently wrote me,
asking to meet at a caf .

663
00:47:12,395 --> 00:47:14,169
She said it was urgent.

664
00:47:14,204 --> 00:47:15,630
What did she tell you?

665
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:18,600
She never showed.
And no one's seen her since.

666
00:47:18,634 --> 00:47:22,142
Many animals have gone missing,
or are actually leaving.

667
00:47:22,177 --> 00:47:25,173
Yesterday, a badger acquaintance,
a solicitor,

668
00:47:25,197 --> 00:47:28,253
...was sacked,
just for arguing a case.

669
00:47:28,288 --> 00:47:29,877
At least he can still argue.

670
00:47:30,082 --> 00:47:31,543
What do you mean?

671
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:33,166
Let me show you.

672
00:47:35,584 --> 00:47:36,784
<i>I've heard of an ox...

673
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,165
<i>A professor from Quox...

674
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,396
<i>No longer permitted to teach...

675
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,921
<i>Who has lost all powers of speech...

676
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,300
- Oh, no.
- Can't speak.

677
00:47:44,337 --> 00:47:46,772
<i>And an owl in Munchkin Rock...

678
00:47:47,004 --> 00:47:49,506
<i>A vicar with a thriving flock...

679
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:50,610
<i>Forbidden to preach...

680
00:47:50,615 --> 00:47:51,758
- Oh.
- No.

681
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,264
<i>Now he only can screech...

682
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:57,163
<i>Only rumors,
but still enough to give pause...

683
00:47:57,255 --> 00:47:59,337
<i>To anyone with paws...

684
00:47:59,342 --> 00:48:03,466
<i>Something bad is happening in Oz...

685
00:48:04,238 --> 00:48:07,638
<i>Something bad happening in...

686
00:48:07,643 --> 00:48:11,426
That's it. I'm leaving Oz while
I can still speak the word "goodbye."

687
00:48:11,507 --> 00:48:13,277
- No, you can't.
- Leave Oz?

688
00:48:15,796 --> 00:48:17,157
Take it away.

689
00:48:17,192 --> 00:48:18,285
<i>Stop jabbering.

690
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:24,885
- Someone's there.
- What is it?

691
00:48:25,104 --> 00:48:27,867
Miss Elphaba,
what are you doing here?

692
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:29,670
Well, I was just...

693
00:48:30,124 --> 00:48:31,188
It's all right.

694
00:48:31,224 --> 00:48:33,578
Quickly, come inside.

695
00:48:43,176 --> 00:48:44,615
Don't be frightened.

696
00:48:46,277 --> 00:48:47,916
Let me get you some tea.

697
00:48:48,879 --> 00:48:51,447
Dr. Dillamond,
what you were saying just now...

698
00:48:52,776 --> 00:48:54,256
...could that really happen?

699
00:48:54,997 --> 00:48:56,937
It is happening.

700
00:48:57,345 --> 00:49:00,285
You'll find if you make it
discouraging enough,

701
00:49:00,334 --> 00:49:03,318
...you can keep anyone silent.

702
00:49:11,962 --> 00:49:14,794
But if animals are losing
the ability to speak...

703
00:49:15,298 --> 00:49:16,749
...leaving Oz, then...

704
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,592
...someone's got to tell the Wizard.

705
00:49:18,993 --> 00:49:20,061
Listen to me.

706
00:49:20,162 --> 00:49:23,152
You mustn't tell another soul
what you've heard and seen here tonight.

707
00:49:23,287 --> 00:49:25,168
But that's why we have a Wizard.

708
00:49:25,876 --> 00:49:29,142
<i>So nothing bad...

709
00:49:29,143 --> 00:49:30,521
<i>- So nothing bad...</i>
- Perhaps you're right.

710
00:49:30,556 --> 00:49:35,337
<i>Nothing all that bad...

711
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:39,020
<i>Nothing truly baaa...

712
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,368
Sorry.

713
00:49:43,751 --> 00:49:45,077
Bad.

714
00:49:45,686 --> 00:49:48,021
I must be catching a cold.

715
00:49:51,509 --> 00:49:53,490
Oz bless you, Dr. Dillamond.

716
00:49:59,892 --> 00:50:02,748
You'd better go.
Take the lamp.

717
00:50:18,161 --> 00:50:20,817
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, there.

718
00:50:21,456 --> 00:50:24,348
- Whoa.
- I did not see her.

719
00:50:24,372 --> 00:50:25,868
Yeah, neither did I.

720
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:31,038
- Um... You might want to... Um... You know.
- Okay. Yeah, leave it with me.

721
00:50:31,082 --> 00:50:34,602
I'm so sorry, miss.
We didn't see you there. You must've...

722
00:50:36,306 --> 00:50:38,134
...blended with the foliage.

723
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:39,484
Is this how you go through life...

724
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:42,054
...just running amok
and trampling anyone in your path?

725
00:50:42,878 --> 00:50:44,168
No.

726
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,159
No.
Sometimes I'm asleep.

727
00:50:50,707 --> 00:50:51,924
All right.

728
00:50:52,503 --> 00:50:55,463
- Here we go. No, I'm not seasick.
- Neither am I.

729
00:50:55,545 --> 00:50:58,753
- No, I did not eat grass as a child.
- Oh, you didn't? I did.

730
00:50:58,758 --> 00:51:01,739
And, yes, I have always been green.

731
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:04,572
And the defensiveness,
is that a recent development?

732
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:16,884
Oh, no, no.

733
00:51:20,352 --> 00:51:22,957
I'm off for some more trampling.
May we offer you a ride?

734
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:25,140
No, thanks.
Get stuffed.

735
00:51:26,435 --> 00:51:27,652
Wow.

736
00:51:28,307 --> 00:51:30,981
Feldspur, we have just been
spurned by a girl.

737
00:51:31,517 --> 00:51:33,090
Indeed.

738
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:34,744
I guess there's
a first time for everything.

739
00:51:36,496 --> 00:51:37,821
<i>Attention, students.

740
00:51:37,822 --> 00:51:39,485
<i>It is my honor to announce that...

741
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:45,274
<i>...Prince Fiyero Tigelaar of Winkie Country
will be filling out our student body...

742
00:51:45,855 --> 00:51:49,011
<i>...having transferred from
the Royal Winkie Academy.

743
00:51:50,587 --> 00:51:52,843
<i>Please help him feel welcome...

744
00:51:52,894 --> 00:51:55,241
<i>...without making direct eye contact.

745
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:09,143
- Hi.
- Hi.

746
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:11,060
Hi.

747
00:52:12,263 --> 00:52:13,464
Hi.

748
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:23,035
Enroll here often?

749
00:52:23,126 --> 00:52:24,792
Can I ask you...

750
00:52:25,614 --> 00:52:28,124
Anything...
Anything you want.

751
00:52:28,434 --> 00:52:29,525
...just to move out the way?

752
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,524
Absolute...
Yeah, that's anything.

753
00:52:32,762 --> 00:52:35,289
- How are you?
- Hi. Yeah.

754
00:52:47,881 --> 00:52:50,351
Are you looking for something?
Or...

755
00:52:52,089 --> 00:52:54,705
- ...someone?
- No, I was...

756
00:52:57,363 --> 00:52:59,009
What was I doing?

757
00:52:59,919 --> 00:53:01,475
How would I know?

758
00:53:01,693 --> 00:53:03,393
Our first fight.

759
00:53:10,746 --> 00:53:13,016
Oh, still here.

760
00:53:14,388 --> 00:53:18,110
Well, I promised to give a guided tour
to any recently arrived students, so...

761
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:25,195
Wait. Are you a recently
arrived student?

762
00:53:25,405 --> 00:53:26,564
I am, yeah.

763
00:53:26,784 --> 00:53:28,323
Oh, I didn't know.

764
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:32,300
Though, I'm not sure I'll last longer
at this school than any of the others.

765
00:53:32,892 --> 00:53:36,738
But I wasn't at any
of your other schools.

766
00:54:06,871 --> 00:54:08,965
And this is the... um...

767
00:54:09,473 --> 00:54:10,898
...the book place.

768
00:54:11,903 --> 00:54:15,689
There's a collection of... um...
rare books around here somewhere...

769
00:54:15,741 --> 00:54:17,757
...and some medium rare as well.

770
00:54:18,168 --> 00:54:20,418
Well, there's so many
to choose from.

771
00:54:20,582 --> 00:54:21,837
Right?

772
00:54:35,802 --> 00:54:37,758
So, what do you do for fun
around here?

773
00:54:38,164 --> 00:54:39,784
Well, nothing.

774
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:41,049
Until now.

775
00:54:41,169 --> 00:54:42,818
You ever been to the Ozdust Ballroom?

776
00:54:42,832 --> 00:54:44,712
The Ozdust Ballroom?

777
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:47,016
I mean, isn't that place
somewhat illegal?

778
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:48,549
And scandalocious?

779
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:50,996
- Yeah, it is both of those things. Yeah.
- Hmm?

780
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:53,762
It's also not far from here,
which is another plus.

781
00:54:54,383 --> 00:54:55,838
Whoa.

782
00:54:57,162 --> 00:54:58,457
You all right?

783
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:00,911
Yeah.

784
00:55:02,797 --> 00:55:04,707
I'm Fiyero... Tigelaar.

785
00:55:05,934 --> 00:55:07,152
Winkie Country.

786
00:55:07,187 --> 00:55:08,864
Oh, Oz.

787
00:55:09,128 --> 00:55:10,558
Boq Woodsman...

788
00:55:12,506 --> 00:55:14,240
...of Munchkinland.

789
00:55:15,841 --> 00:55:17,097
Great.

790
00:55:17,132 --> 00:55:18,620
Excuse me.
Good to know.

791
00:55:18,714 --> 00:55:20,747
Um... What were you saying again...

792
00:55:20,795 --> 00:55:24,205
...about the Ozdust and fun, and you and me?

793
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:27,124
Unfortunately, it's against Shiz rules
to go into town after dark.

794
00:55:27,129 --> 00:55:30,889
I see that, once again, the responsibility
to corrupt my fellow students...

795
00:55:31,048 --> 00:55:33,019
...falls to me.

796
00:55:33,219 --> 00:55:34,829
Uh... Excuse me.

797
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:47,672
The trouble with schools is...

798
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:51,507
<i>They always try
to teach the wrong lesson...

799
00:55:56,336 --> 00:55:57,783
<i>Believe me...

800
00:55:57,913 --> 00:56:02,836
<i>I've been kicked out of
enough of them to know...

801
00:56:03,746 --> 00:56:06,120
<i>They want you to become less callow...

802
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:07,845
<i>Less shallow...

803
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:14,448
<i>But I say,
why invite stress in?..

804
00:56:20,265 --> 00:56:23,288
<i>Stop studying strife...

805
00:56:25,686 --> 00:56:29,535
<i>And learn to live...

806
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:38,064
<i>The unexamined life...

807
00:56:43,843 --> 00:56:45,496
<i>Dancing through life...

808
00:56:45,592 --> 00:56:47,649
<i>Skimming the surface...

809
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:51,869
<i>Gliding where turf is smooth...

810
00:56:51,874 --> 00:56:53,873
<i>Life's more painless...

811
00:56:53,985 --> 00:56:55,673
<i>For the brainless...

812
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:57,671
<i>Why think too hard...

813
00:56:57,676 --> 00:56:59,690
<i>When it's so soothing?..

814
00:56:59,695 --> 00:57:01,504
<i>Dancing through life...

815
00:57:01,676 --> 00:57:03,543
<i>No need to tough it...

816
00:57:03,548 --> 00:57:07,589
<i>When you can slough it off as I do...

817
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:09,282
<i>Nothing matters...

818
00:57:09,287 --> 00:57:12,009
<i>But knowing nothing matters...

819
00:57:12,014 --> 00:57:13,762
<i>It's just life...

820
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:18,797
<i>So keep dancing through...

821
00:57:30,919 --> 00:57:32,731
<i>Dancing through life...

822
00:57:32,752 --> 00:57:34,573
<i>Swaying and sweeping...

823
00:57:34,578 --> 00:57:38,707
<i>And always keeping cool...

824
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:40,550
<i>Life is fraught-less...

825
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:42,302
<i>When you're thoughtless...

826
00:57:42,503 --> 00:57:44,237
<i>Those who don't try...

827
00:57:44,542 --> 00:57:46,506
<i>Never look foolish...

828
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,332
<i>Dancing through life...

829
00:57:48,367 --> 00:57:50,102
<i>Mindless and careless...

830
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:53,952
<i>Make sure you're where
less trouble is rife...

831
00:57:53,957 --> 00:57:55,885
<i>Woes are fleeting...

832
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:58,209
<i>Blows are glancing...

833
00:57:58,243 --> 00:58:07,714
<i>When you're dancing through life...

834
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:24,149
I'm gonna go study outside.
I can't...

835
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:38,510
<i>Let's go down to the Ozdust Ballroom...

836
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,493
<i>We'll meet there later tonight...

837
00:58:42,845 --> 00:58:45,768
<i>We can dance till it's light...

838
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:48,145
<i>Find the prettiest girl...

839
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,356
<i>Give her a whirl...

840
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:54,777
<i>Right on down to the Ozdust Ballroom...

841
00:58:54,782 --> 00:58:58,238
<i>Come on, follow me...

842
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:01,909
<i>You'll be happy to be there...

843
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:05,663
<i>- Dancing through life...
- Down at the Ozdust...

844
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:09,540
<i>If only because dust is
what we come to...

845
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:14,313
<i>Nothing matters,
but knowing nothing matters...

846
00:59:14,348 --> 00:59:20,109
<i>It's just life...

847
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:23,625
<i>It's just life...

848
00:59:23,701 --> 00:59:29,561
<i>So keep dancing through...

849
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:33,911
Galinda. Galinda.

850
00:59:34,264 --> 00:59:36,126
Hey. Here.

851
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:39,865
Uh, keep it.

852
00:59:40,442 --> 00:59:41,802
I've got many.

853
00:59:42,193 --> 00:59:44,760
- I cry a lot.
- Well, thank you.

854
00:59:44,765 --> 00:59:47,908
Um, I hope you'll save a dance
for me tonight.

855
00:59:47,943 --> 00:59:50,292
I'll be right there, waiting.

856
00:59:50,494 --> 00:59:53,193
- All night.
- That's so kind.

857
00:59:53,681 --> 00:59:55,349
But you know what would be even kinder?

858
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:58,640
<i>See that tragically beautiful girl...

859
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:00,835
<i>The one in the chair...

860
01:00:01,648 --> 01:00:03,515
<i>It seems so unfair...

861
01:00:03,616 --> 01:00:05,484
<i>We should go on a spree...

862
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,905
<i>And not she, gee...

863
01:00:07,986 --> 01:00:10,833
<i>I know someone would be my hero...

864
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,644
<i>If that someone were...

865
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:17,088
<i>To go invite her...

866
01:00:17,913 --> 01:00:21,131
Well, maybe I could invite her.

867
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:24,105
Oh, Bick, really?

868
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:27,508
<i>You would do that for me?..

869
01:00:30,901 --> 01:00:32,933
I would do anything for you.

870
01:00:33,362 --> 01:00:34,696
Well?

871
01:00:34,972 --> 01:00:36,793
- Oh, right now?
- Why not?

872
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:38,108
Go ask her right now?

873
01:00:38,143 --> 01:00:39,873
Why not?
She's right there.

874
01:00:49,403 --> 01:00:52,574
- Uh... Hey, Nessa.
- Hi.

875
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,250
You're good.

876
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:01,397
I don't know what you mean.

877
01:01:02,139 --> 01:01:03,957
I love helping others.

878
01:01:04,687 --> 01:01:08,431
Oh, and I happen to be free tonight.
After all...

879
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:12,774
<i>Now that we've met one another...

880
01:01:12,813 --> 01:01:16,738
<i>It's clear we deserve each other...

881
01:01:16,743 --> 01:01:18,359
- You're perfect.
- You're perfect.

882
01:01:18,364 --> 01:01:21,490
<i>So we're perfect together...

883
01:01:21,525 --> 01:01:24,536
<i>Born to be forever...

884
01:01:24,586 --> 01:01:29,269
<i>Dancing through life...

885
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,361
- You'll never guess what just happened to me.
- What?

886
01:01:38,366 --> 01:01:42,739
That perfectly adorable Munchkin boy
just asked me out.

887
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:47,127
He said he was too shy to ask me at first,
but then Galinda emboldened him.

888
01:01:47,132 --> 01:01:49,164
- Wait. Galinda?
- Don't.

889
01:01:49,669 --> 01:01:52,766
Don't you dare say
another word against her.

890
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:56,817
I'm about to have the happiest night
of my life...

891
01:01:57,744 --> 01:02:00,039
...thanks to Galinda.

892
01:02:01,565 --> 01:02:03,993
<i>Finally for this one night...

893
01:02:04,028 --> 01:02:07,580
<i>I'm about to have a fun night...

894
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:12,422
<i>With this Munchkin boy
Galinda found for me...

895
01:02:12,457 --> 01:02:15,246
<i>And I only wish there were...

896
01:02:15,281 --> 01:02:21,235
<i>Something I could do for her,
to repay her...

897
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,462
<i>Elphaba, see?..

898
01:02:24,497 --> 01:02:26,592
<i>We deserve each other...

899
01:02:26,597 --> 01:02:30,480
<i>And Galinda helped it come true...

900
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:35,206
<i>We deserve each other,
me and Boq...

901
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:38,216
Please, Elphaba,
try to understand.

902
01:02:38,646 --> 01:02:42,227
<i>I do...

903
01:02:43,212 --> 01:02:44,795
One, two, three.

904
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,449
- That was it. That was it.
- We're in.

905
01:02:46,489 --> 01:02:47,867
- And it's perfect.
- Oh, sweet Oz.

906
01:02:48,486 --> 01:02:51,054
Am I not the most scandalocious
little fish in the sea?

907
01:02:51,112 --> 01:02:52,526
The most.

908
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:56,072
Fiyero's gonna lose
what's left of his mind.

909
01:02:56,107 --> 01:02:57,460
I mean, we nailed it.

910
01:02:57,513 --> 01:02:59,650
- Now, hurry up.
- Okay, I may have to...

911
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:02,783
I can't believe this boy knows
how to get into the Ozdust Ballroom.

912
01:03:02,795 --> 01:03:06,803
And that we just happened
to cross paths today. Am I right?

913
01:03:06,854 --> 01:03:08,479
Um...

914
01:03:08,742 --> 01:03:10,241
Eeew.

915
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:11,974
What even is that?

916
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:13,598
Galinda?

917
01:03:15,494 --> 01:03:16,834
What's the reason?

918
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:19,298
I know. It's my granny.

919
01:03:19,524 --> 01:03:22,118
She always makes me
the most hideoteous hats.

920
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:25,829
I'd give it away,
but I don't hate anyone that much.

921
01:03:28,698 --> 01:03:30,253
I couldn't.

922
01:03:31,889 --> 01:03:33,565
Could I?

923
01:03:34,301 --> 01:03:35,639
No.

924
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,172
- Hey.
- Hi.

925
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,199
Um, we should go.

926
01:03:41,204 --> 01:03:43,490
Yeah, we have to
go rouge our knees.

927
01:03:43,495 --> 01:03:44,419
- I know.
- Do it.

928
01:03:44,424 --> 01:03:45,299
- Yeah.
- Super rouge.

929
01:03:45,304 --> 01:03:45,871
- Right.
- I do it every day.

930
01:03:45,876 --> 01:03:48,369
Bye, Elphaba.
Love your shoulder pad...

931
01:03:48,374 --> 01:03:52,999
- Yeah. You just always look so good and joyful.
- Just a joy...

932
01:03:56,723 --> 01:03:58,249
Galinda... um...

933
01:03:58,672 --> 01:04:01,265
Nessa and I were talking about you
just now, and...

934
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,324
Oh, well, we were just talking about you...

935
01:04:04,021 --> 01:04:06,229
...how you should join us tonight.

936
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,327
I don't follow.

937
01:04:08,556 --> 01:04:12,079
You join us at the Ozdust.

938
01:04:12,351 --> 01:04:13,618
I'm inviting you.

939
01:04:13,777 --> 01:04:14,602
Why?

940
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:17,452
Well... Well, because everyone will be there.

941
01:04:17,492 --> 01:04:19,982
And don't tell me
you have nothing to wear...

942
01:04:20,112 --> 01:04:22,033
...because you could wear this.

943
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:27,230
I mean, it goes with
everything you own.

944
01:04:28,092 --> 01:04:31,319
<i>It's really, uh, sharp,
don't you think?..

945
01:04:31,378 --> 01:04:34,404
<i>You know, black
is this year's pink...

946
01:04:34,516 --> 01:04:38,123
<i>You deserve each other,
this hat and you...

947
01:04:38,158 --> 01:04:40,398
<i>You're both so smart...

948
01:04:40,954 --> 01:04:44,169
<i>You deserve each other,
so here...

949
01:04:44,204 --> 01:04:48,042
<i>Out of the Goodness of my heart...

950
01:05:04,017 --> 01:05:05,894
We're gonna get arrested.

951
01:05:06,195 --> 01:05:07,697
There's too much light.

952
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:10,657
Move.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

953
01:05:15,705 --> 01:05:19,928
Sorry to disturb you, Madame Morrible,
but I have a favor to ask.

954
01:05:58,753 --> 01:06:00,501
Here we go. Go. Ready?

955
01:06:00,536 --> 01:06:01,490
Yep.

956
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:07,452
- Yeah.
- Come on.

957
01:06:38,507 --> 01:06:39,202
<i>Listen, Nessa...

958
01:06:39,775 --> 01:06:41,550
- Yes?
<i>- Eee, Nessa...

959
01:06:41,555 --> 01:06:44,294
<i>I've got something to confess...

960
01:06:44,299 --> 01:06:46,968
<i>A reason why, well...

961
01:06:47,164 --> 01:06:49,857
<i>Why I asked you
here tonight...

962
01:06:49,892 --> 01:06:52,596
<i>And I know it isn't fair...

963
01:06:52,631 --> 01:06:54,438
Oh, Boq, I know why.

964
01:06:54,528 --> 01:06:55,785
You do?

965
01:06:56,117 --> 01:06:59,160
<i>It's because I'm in this chair...

966
01:06:59,195 --> 01:07:01,761
<i>And you felt sorry for me...

967
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,960
Well, isn't that right?

968
01:07:03,995 --> 01:07:05,927
No. Whoa.
No, no.

969
01:07:06,011 --> 01:07:07,930
I don't feel sorry for you.

970
01:07:07,965 --> 01:07:10,306
You're great.
I asked you because...

971
01:07:11,337 --> 01:07:12,978
...because...

972
01:07:14,507 --> 01:07:17,941
<i>Because you are so beautiful...

973
01:07:17,946 --> 01:07:21,222
<i>Oh, Boq, I think you're wonderful...

974
01:07:21,513 --> 01:07:23,637
<i>And we deserve each other...

975
01:07:23,691 --> 01:07:27,089
<i>Don't you see,
this is our chance?..

976
01:07:27,969 --> 01:07:30,221
<i>We deserve each other...

977
01:07:30,226 --> 01:07:32,085
<i>Don't we, Boq?..

978
01:07:32,555 --> 01:07:33,737
You know what?

979
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,691
<i>Let's dance...

980
01:07:36,883 --> 01:07:37,889
What?

981
01:07:37,924 --> 01:07:42,303
<i>Let's dance...

982
01:07:52,676 --> 01:07:54,427
Yeah. Yeah.

983
01:08:07,973 --> 01:08:10,731
Are all the Tigelaars so nimble?

984
01:08:11,105 --> 01:08:12,530
You.

985
01:08:12,709 --> 01:08:13,566
Me?

986
01:08:13,571 --> 01:08:17,241
And you can go back
to doing whatever this is.

987
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:19,135
Go.

988
01:08:19,441 --> 01:08:20,831
Go.

989
01:08:21,812 --> 01:08:24,529
Madame Morrible, you are...

990
01:08:24,564 --> 01:08:27,362
- Seriously, I admire you so...
- Enough.

991
01:08:30,418 --> 01:08:32,172
A magic wand?

992
01:08:32,354 --> 01:08:33,938
It's a training wand.

993
01:08:33,973 --> 01:08:36,586
A training wand?
For me?

994
01:08:36,621 --> 01:08:39,663
Madame Morrible,
how can I express my gratitution?

995
01:08:40,193 --> 01:08:42,542
It is my heart's desire
to become a sorceress.

996
01:08:42,547 --> 01:08:46,275
Thank you for having
faith in me.

997
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,760
Actually, I have no faith in you.

998
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,781
This is your roommate's idea,
not mine.

999
01:08:54,207 --> 01:08:55,604
I'm confused.

1000
01:08:55,756 --> 01:09:00,908
Miss Elphaba has requested
that I include you in our sorcery seminar...

1001
01:09:00,943 --> 01:09:05,152
...and insisted that I tell you
this very night, or she would quit.

1002
01:09:05,187 --> 01:09:06,844
Elphaba did?

1003
01:09:07,751 --> 01:09:09,779
But... why?

1004
01:09:09,814 --> 01:09:13,519
I'm a sorceress, not a mind reader.
I have no idea why.

1005
01:09:13,675 --> 01:09:16,119
But I can't risk losing her...

1006
01:09:16,177 --> 01:09:17,791
...so here I am.

1007
01:09:18,601 --> 01:09:23,395
My personal opinion, dear,
is that you do not have what it takes.

1008
01:09:23,634 --> 01:09:25,645
I hope you prove me wrong.

1009
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:28,017
I doubt you will.

1010
01:09:29,603 --> 01:09:32,655
Uh, you may want to thank her.
She just got here.

1011
01:09:33,287 --> 01:09:34,558
What?

1012
01:10:13,904 --> 01:10:16,024
<i>What is she wearing?

1013
01:10:19,785 --> 01:10:21,762
<i>What a ridiculous hat.

1014
01:11:11,252 --> 01:11:13,421
<i>Her hat is disgustifying.

1015
01:11:17,467 --> 01:11:18,843
<i>Oh, look at her go.

1016
01:11:22,104 --> 01:11:23,551
<i>What does she think she's doing?

1017
01:11:23,556 --> 01:11:25,272
<i>Is she dancing?

1018
01:12:22,663 --> 01:12:24,109
I'll say this much...

1019
01:12:24,114 --> 01:12:26,479
...she doesn't give a twig
what anyone thinks.

1020
01:12:26,836 --> 01:12:28,628
Of course she does.

1021
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:31,426
She just pretends not to.

1022
01:12:39,013 --> 01:12:40,752
Oh, I can't watch.

1023
01:12:43,017 --> 01:12:44,617
I feel awful.

1024
01:12:44,868 --> 01:12:46,137
Why?

1025
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,704
It's not like it's your fault.

1026
01:12:58,359 --> 01:12:59,874
Excuse me.

1027
01:13:52,341 --> 01:13:54,093
- What are you doing?
- Stop.

1028
01:13:58,132 --> 01:13:59,579
No.

1029
01:15:14,478 --> 01:15:16,229
It's all right.

1030
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:14,063
<i>Dancing through life...

1031
01:16:14,266 --> 01:16:16,132
<i>Here at the Ozdust...

1032
01:16:16,167 --> 01:16:20,187
<i>If only because
dust is what we come to...

1033
01:16:20,188 --> 01:16:22,222
<i>And here's a strange thing...

1034
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:24,557
<i>Your life could end up changing...

1035
01:16:24,876 --> 01:16:34,763
<i>While you're dancing...
through...

1036
01:16:41,449 --> 01:16:43,691
<i>Wait... a second.

1037
01:16:43,726 --> 01:16:47,288
You're telling me
that was your first party ever?

1038
01:16:47,344 --> 01:16:49,180
Well, do funerals count?

1039
01:16:51,136 --> 01:16:52,414
That was funny.

1040
01:16:52,419 --> 01:16:53,835
Thank you.

1041
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:57,088
- Oh, I couldn't remotely sleep.
- Neither can I.

1042
01:16:57,371 --> 01:17:01,026
I know. Let's tell each other
something we've never told anyone before.

1043
01:17:01,032 --> 01:17:02,935
Okay, fine. I'll go first.

1044
01:17:05,565 --> 01:17:07,746
Fiyero and I are getting married.

1045
01:17:07,865 --> 01:17:10,369
Oh, my God.

1046
01:17:10,895 --> 01:17:12,133
He asked you already?

1047
01:17:12,168 --> 01:17:13,748
Oh, he doesn't know yet.

1048
01:17:13,949 --> 01:17:15,651
Oh, okay.

1049
01:17:16,412 --> 01:17:17,927
Okay, now you
tell me a secret.

1050
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,260
- Like what?
- Like...

1051
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:22,923
Like...

1052
01:17:23,365 --> 01:17:26,396
...why do you sleep with this funny
little green bottle under your pillow?

1053
01:17:26,401 --> 01:17:28,393
- No, please, give that back.
- What is this? I wanna know.

1054
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:30,165
- Give it back, please.
- I wanna know.

1055
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:31,834
- Serious... Oh.
- Give it back.

1056
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:36,374
It was my mother's.
That's all.

1057
01:17:39,144 --> 01:17:40,708
Well, that's not fair.

1058
01:17:40,743 --> 01:17:42,472
I told you a really good one.

1059
01:18:04,947 --> 01:18:06,699
My father hates me.

1060
01:18:07,168 --> 01:18:08,262
What?

1061
01:18:08,365 --> 01:18:09,963
That's not the secret.

1062
01:18:10,044 --> 01:18:11,340
Oh.

1063
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:13,765
The secret is that... um...

1064
01:18:14,508 --> 01:18:16,073
...he has a good reason.

1065
01:18:25,559 --> 01:18:27,208
It's my fault.

1066
01:18:28,215 --> 01:18:29,614
What is?

1067
01:18:33,703 --> 01:18:35,704
That my sister is the way she is.

1068
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:41,925
When my mother was carrying Nessa, my...

1069
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:44,447
...father began to worry
that she might come out...

1070
01:18:44,452 --> 01:18:46,191
- Green.
- ...green.

1071
01:18:47,916 --> 01:18:52,830
He was so worried that he made my mother
chew milk flowers day and night.

1072
01:18:54,882 --> 01:18:56,381
Only...

1073
01:18:57,149 --> 01:19:00,578
the milk flowers made Nessa
come too soon, and...

1074
01:19:02,221 --> 01:19:04,230
...and her little legs, they...

1075
01:19:07,521 --> 01:19:09,211
And my mother...

1076
01:19:12,111 --> 01:19:13,851
Well, she never woke up.

1077
01:19:15,128 --> 01:19:18,290
None of which would've ever happened
if it wasn't for...

1078
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:21,287
...for me.

1079
01:19:22,555 --> 01:19:24,173
So...

1080
01:19:25,033 --> 01:19:26,646
...it's my fault.

1081
01:19:27,835 --> 01:19:29,660
What?
No.

1082
01:19:30,528 --> 01:19:34,974
That was the milk flowers' fault,
not yours.

1083
01:19:36,547 --> 01:19:39,776
That might be your secret, Elphaba,
but that doesn't make it true.

1084
01:19:44,512 --> 01:19:46,069
Look.

1085
01:19:46,074 --> 01:19:47,830
It's tomorrow.

1086
01:19:52,963 --> 01:19:54,190
And, Elphie...

1087
01:19:54,649 --> 01:19:56,810
- Can I call you Elphie?
- Well, it's a little bit perky.

1088
01:19:56,816 --> 01:20:00,227
- I know. I know. I'm gonna call you that.
- I don't really...

1089
01:20:01,514 --> 01:20:03,291
And you can call me...

1090
01:20:03,701 --> 01:20:04,546
...Galinda.

1091
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:05,501
That is your name.

1092
01:20:05,506 --> 01:20:07,343
Let's not quarrel.

1093
01:20:08,456 --> 01:20:09,715
Elphie?

1094
01:20:10,414 --> 01:20:12,211
Now that we're friends...

1095
01:20:13,148 --> 01:20:15,341
...I've decided to make you
my new project.

1096
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:16,852
Oh, you really don't have to do that.

1097
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,297
I know.

1098
01:20:18,752 --> 01:20:20,834
That's what makes me so nice.

1099
01:20:22,258 --> 01:20:27,126
<i>Whenever I see someone
less fortunate than I...

1100
01:20:27,148 --> 01:20:28,554
And let's face it, right?

1101
01:20:28,686 --> 01:20:31,951
<i>Who isn't less fortunate than I?..

1102
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:36,174
<i>My tender heart
tends to start to bleed...

1103
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:38,132
<i>And when someone needs a makeover...

1104
01:20:38,137 --> 01:20:39,832
<i>I simply have to take over...

1105
01:20:39,873 --> 01:20:42,649
<i>I know, I know...

1106
01:20:45,228 --> 01:20:50,317
<i>Exactly what they need...

1107
01:20:50,384 --> 01:20:53,264
<i>And even in your case...

1108
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:01,655
Never mind.

1109
01:21:01,736 --> 01:21:05,114
- I should... Okay.
- Yeah. Gonna put these right back on ya.

1110
01:21:07,127 --> 01:21:10,373
<i>Tho' it's the toughest case...

1111
01:21:10,754 --> 01:21:12,857
<i>I've yet to face...

1112
01:21:12,973 --> 01:21:17,319
<i>Don't worry,
I'm determined to succeed...

1113
01:21:17,853 --> 01:21:21,685
<i>Follow my lead...

1114
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:24,984
<i>And, yes, indeed...

1115
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:27,138
<i>You...

1116
01:21:27,143 --> 01:21:28,667
<i>Will...

1117
01:21:28,672 --> 01:21:31,646
<i>Be...

1118
01:21:40,845 --> 01:21:42,409
<i>Popular...

1119
01:21:42,444 --> 01:21:45,183
<i>You're gonna be popular...

1120
01:21:45,218 --> 01:21:47,297
<i>I'll teach you the proper ploys...

1121
01:21:47,332 --> 01:21:48,801
<i>When you talk to boys...

1122
01:21:48,836 --> 01:21:50,831
<i>Little ways to flirt and flounce, ew...

1123
01:21:50,836 --> 01:21:54,370
<i>I'll show you what shoes to wear,
how to fix your hair...

1124
01:21:54,405 --> 01:21:58,378
<i>Everything that really counts to be
popular...

1125
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:01,533
<i>I'll help you be popular...

1126
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:04,829
<i>You'll hang with the right cohorts,
you'll be good at sports...

1127
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:07,434
<i>Know the slang you've got to know...

1128
01:22:07,486 --> 01:22:08,533
<i>So let's start...

1129
01:22:08,538 --> 01:22:14,178
<i>'Cause you've got
an awf'lly long way to go...

1130
01:22:16,274 --> 01:22:18,677
<i>Don't be offended
by my frank analysis...

1131
01:22:18,682 --> 01:22:21,531
<i>Think of it as personality dialysis...

1132
01:22:21,613 --> 01:22:25,525
<i>Now that I've chosen to become a pal,
a sister and adviser...

1133
01:22:25,530 --> 01:22:26,753
<i>There's nobody wiser...

1134
01:22:26,788 --> 01:22:29,514
<i>Not when it comes to popular...

1135
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:32,505
<i>I know about popular...

1136
01:22:32,598 --> 01:22:34,599
<i>And with an assist from me...

1137
01:22:34,604 --> 01:22:36,167
<i>To be who you'll be...

1138
01:22:36,202 --> 01:22:38,911
<i>Instead of dreary who-you-were,
well, are...

1139
01:22:38,946 --> 01:22:42,375
<i>There's nothing that can stop you
from becoming populer...

1140
01:22:43,236 --> 01:22:44,649
<i>...lar...

1141
01:22:50,626 --> 01:22:54,243
<i>We're gonna make you popular...

1142
01:22:56,044 --> 01:22:57,491
This is never gonna work.

1143
01:22:58,288 --> 01:22:59,057
What?

1144
01:22:59,062 --> 01:23:02,572
Elphie, you mustn't think that way.

1145
01:23:02,607 --> 01:23:06,930
Your whole life is gonna change,
and it's all because of me.

1146
01:23:07,689 --> 01:23:09,011
Come on.

1147
01:23:09,305 --> 01:23:12,136
<i>When I see depressing creatures...

1148
01:23:12,141 --> 01:23:14,692
<i>With unprepossessing features...

1149
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:17,303
<i>I remind them on their own behalf...

1150
01:23:18,008 --> 01:23:20,097
- Get down.
<i>- To think of...

1151
01:23:20,103 --> 01:23:25,944
<i>Celebrated heads of state
or specially great communicators...

1152
01:23:25,996 --> 01:23:27,913
<i>Did they have brains
or knowledge?..

1153
01:23:27,964 --> 01:23:30,416
- Well, actually...
- Don't make me laugh.

1154
01:23:30,451 --> 01:23:31,973
- They were...
- Popular.

1155
01:23:32,008 --> 01:23:32,882
Right.

1156
01:23:32,917 --> 01:23:35,312
<i>It's all about popular...

1157
01:23:35,355 --> 01:23:38,879
<i>It's not about aptitude,
it's the way you're viewed...

1158
01:23:38,914 --> 01:23:41,587
<i>So it's very shrewd to be...

1159
01:23:41,592 --> 01:23:43,763
<i>Very, very popular...

1160
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:46,345
<i>Like me...

1161
01:23:48,702 --> 01:23:49,801
Come here.

1162
01:23:49,834 --> 01:23:51,654
First, hair.

1163
01:23:52,046 --> 01:23:54,119
We toss our hair.

1164
01:23:54,379 --> 01:23:55,643
Ready?

1165
01:23:56,008 --> 01:23:57,680
Toss, toss.

1166
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:02,016
Toss, toss.

1167
01:24:05,033 --> 01:24:06,521
That's a choice.

1168
01:24:07,345 --> 01:24:11,416
Next, I'm gonna transform
this simple frock... slash coat...

1169
01:24:11,451 --> 01:24:14,794
...this simple 'froat'... boop...
into a magnificent ball gown.

1170
01:24:16,882 --> 01:24:18,200
Ball gown.

1171
01:24:22,578 --> 01:24:23,796
Ball gown.

1172
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:25,722
Ball gown.

1173
01:24:25,757 --> 01:24:27,038
Come on.

1174
01:24:27,286 --> 01:24:29,281
Come on.
I'm counting on you.

1175
01:24:40,196 --> 01:24:41,692
Ball gown.

1176
01:24:43,394 --> 01:24:44,892
- Seriously?
- Do you need my help?

1177
01:24:44,897 --> 01:24:47,318
No. Just wear the 'froat.' It's pretty.

1178
01:24:49,791 --> 01:24:51,896
Let's just start a little smaller.

1179
01:24:52,032 --> 01:24:54,323
After you, madame.

1180
01:24:54,691 --> 01:24:55,937
- Let's see.
- Thank you.

1181
01:25:01,022 --> 01:25:02,316
Maybe...

1182
01:25:03,574 --> 01:25:05,682
...just this.

1183
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:12,328
Pink goes good with green.

1184
01:25:12,498 --> 01:25:14,234
Goes 'well' with green.

1185
01:25:14,269 --> 01:25:16,003
It so does.

1186
01:25:31,998 --> 01:25:33,809
Why, Miss Elphaba...

1187
01:25:36,333 --> 01:25:37,855
...look at you.

1188
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:42,995
You're beautiful.

1189
01:25:46,685 --> 01:25:48,241
I have to go.

1190
01:25:48,663 --> 01:25:49,885
What...

1191
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,153
You're welcome.

1192
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:01,896
Oh, hello.

1193
01:26:02,623 --> 01:26:05,662
Wow.

1194
01:26:06,792 --> 01:26:10,014
<i>And tho' you protest...

1195
01:26:10,388 --> 01:26:14,361
<i>Your disinterest...

1196
01:26:14,529 --> 01:26:22,158
<i>I know clandestinely...

1197
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:25,519
<i>You're gonna grin and bear it...

1198
01:26:25,608 --> 01:26:28,122
<i>Your newfound popularity...

1199
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:50,273
<i>You'll be popular...

1200
01:26:53,178 --> 01:27:03,068
<i>Just not quite as popular as me...

1201
01:27:10,107 --> 01:27:11,740
- Oh, hi, Elphaba.
- Hey.

1202
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:13,268
Hey, Elphaba.

1203
01:27:19,932 --> 01:27:21,456
Toss, toss.

1204
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:23,515
No.

1205
01:27:35,156 --> 01:27:36,962
You've been Galinda-fied.

1206
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:43,075
You don't need to do that,
you know.

1207
01:27:46,035 --> 01:27:47,816
Come on.
Let's get to class.

1208
01:27:49,478 --> 01:27:51,580
- Dr. Dilly.
- Dr. Dilly, because you can't...

1209
01:27:51,615 --> 01:27:53,198
- Well, he calls me...
- Dr. Dillamond.

1210
01:27:53,551 --> 01:27:54,866
- It's not his fault.
- He needs to accept it.

1211
01:27:54,867 --> 01:27:56,526
He doesn't have upper front teeth.

1212
01:27:58,346 --> 01:28:00,800
Uh, Dr. Dillamond,
I picked you some poppies.

1213
01:28:00,835 --> 01:28:02,886
Not now, Miss Elphaba.

1214
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:05,762
Please, everyone take your seats.

1215
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:08,448
I've something to say
and very little time.

1216
01:28:10,424 --> 01:28:12,451
My dear students...

1217
01:28:12,657 --> 01:28:15,500
...this will be my last day
here at Shiz.

1218
01:28:15,645 --> 01:28:19,562
You see, animals are no longer
permitted to teach.

1219
01:28:19,574 --> 01:28:20,316
What?

1220
01:28:20,321 --> 01:28:23,736
It's all right, Miss Elphaba.
I'll be all right. I...

1221
01:28:31,378 --> 01:28:35,343
Students, remain calm, please.
There's no cause for alarm.

1222
01:28:35,378 --> 01:28:36,894
What is this? What's happening?

1223
01:28:36,912 --> 01:28:38,194
Come on, goat.

1224
01:28:40,058 --> 01:28:41,057
Hey.

1225
01:28:41,092 --> 01:28:41,911
You can't permit this.

1226
01:28:41,912 --> 01:28:44,556
Miss Elphaba,
I'm afraid it's out of our hands.

1227
01:28:44,711 --> 01:28:45,665
They can take away my job...

1228
01:28:46,003 --> 01:28:48,151
- ...but I shall continue speaking out.
- Dr. Dillamond.

1229
01:28:48,462 --> 01:28:52,406
Listen to me.
You're not being told the whole story.

1230
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:59,003
Are we all just gonna
sit here in silence?

1231
01:29:01,622 --> 01:29:04,881
That's quite enough, Miss Elphaba.

1232
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:08,394
Take your seat.

1233
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:26,705
- Students...
- Are you all right?

1234
01:29:26,710 --> 01:29:32,028
...your new history professor
has prepared a special presentation.

1235
01:29:47,844 --> 01:29:50,428
Good afternoon, students.

1236
01:29:53,565 --> 01:29:55,818
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

1237
01:29:55,919 --> 01:29:57,769
In times such as these...

1238
01:29:57,815 --> 01:30:02,314
...it behooves us all
not merely to study the past...

1239
01:30:02,349 --> 01:30:05,279
...but to look to the future.

1240
01:30:09,096 --> 01:30:12,927
This is called a cage.

1241
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:21,750
This remarkable innovation
is for the good of all Oz...

1242
01:30:21,785 --> 01:30:24,153
...as well as for the animal's own good.
You see?

1243
01:30:24,235 --> 01:30:26,584
If it's so good,
why is he trembling?

1244
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,548
He's just happy to be here.

1245
01:30:35,023 --> 01:30:37,760
Now, one benefit
of caging an animal this young...

1246
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:41,080
...is that in all likelihood,
he'll never learn to speak.

1247
01:30:41,537 --> 01:30:42,375
Oh, no.

1248
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:45,128
The dimensions of the cage
will vary upon the size of the animal...

1249
01:30:45,133 --> 01:30:47,368
...but the basic design remains the same.

1250
01:30:47,405 --> 01:30:49,055
Let me show you.

1251
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:56,458
Can you imagine a world where animals are
kept in cages and they never learn to speak?

1252
01:30:56,545 --> 01:30:58,603
This poor lion cub
seems so frightened.

1253
01:30:58,868 --> 01:31:00,296
What are we gonna do?

1254
01:31:00,385 --> 01:31:01,565
Sorry, 'we'?

1255
01:31:01,661 --> 01:31:03,493
Well, someone's got to do something.

1256
01:31:35,391 --> 01:31:38,321
Hey. Hey, hey.
Hey, come here.

1257
01:31:40,986 --> 01:31:42,331
What is happening?

1258
01:31:43,087 --> 01:31:45,076
I don't know.
I got mad and...

1259
01:31:47,303 --> 01:31:49,086
Fiyero, what are you doing?

1260
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:52,732
Well, you coming?

1261
01:31:53,246 --> 01:31:54,532
Come on.

1262
01:31:59,609 --> 01:32:00,703
Look.

1263
01:32:00,738 --> 01:32:01,865
Come on.

1264
01:32:03,502 --> 01:32:05,170
Come, buddy. That's it.

1265
01:32:05,837 --> 01:32:08,530
- There we go. There we go.
- Yeah. All right.

1266
01:32:33,352 --> 01:32:35,411
What in the name of Oz?

1267
01:33:11,435 --> 01:33:13,399
I didn't mean to scare you.

1268
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:18,409
Why is it you're always causing
some sort of commotion?

1269
01:33:18,444 --> 01:33:20,753
I don't cause commotions.
I am one.

1270
01:33:20,788 --> 01:33:22,579
Yeah.
Well, that's for sure.

1271
01:33:23,034 --> 01:33:25,611
So, you think I should just keep my
mouth shut? Is that what you're saying?

1272
01:33:25,866 --> 01:33:27,307
What? No.
No, I'm saying...

1273
01:33:27,389 --> 01:33:29,201
- You think I wanna be this way?
- I...

1274
01:33:29,231 --> 01:33:31,111
- You think I wanna care this much?
- No, I mean...

1275
01:33:31,112 --> 01:33:33,391
I know that my life would be much easier
if I didn't care, but...

1276
01:33:33,396 --> 01:33:35,578
Do you ever let anyone else talk?

1277
01:33:37,543 --> 01:33:38,996
Sorry.

1278
01:33:40,236 --> 01:33:42,567
- I was just...
- But can I just say one more thing?

1279
01:33:44,264 --> 01:33:46,162
You could've walked away back there.

1280
01:33:46,682 --> 01:33:47,436
So?

1281
01:33:47,442 --> 01:33:50,768
So no matter how shallow and self-absorbed
you pretend to be...

1282
01:33:50,773 --> 01:33:53,019
Uh, excuse me.
There is no pretense here.

1283
01:33:53,054 --> 01:33:55,198
I happen to be genuinely self-absorbed
and deeply shallow.

1284
01:33:55,233 --> 01:33:57,472
Oh, please.
No, you're not.

1285
01:33:57,507 --> 01:33:59,257
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be so unhappy.

1286
01:34:08,488 --> 01:34:09,937
Fine.

1287
01:34:11,934 --> 01:34:14,205
- Well, if you don't want my help...
- No, I do.

1288
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:04,190
What did you mean to do back there?

1289
01:35:06,643 --> 01:35:08,972
And why was I the only one
you didn't do it to?

1290
01:35:15,704 --> 01:35:17,159
You're bleeding.

1291
01:35:18,236 --> 01:35:19,623
Am I?

1292
01:35:35,145 --> 01:35:36,737
There.

1293
01:35:41,237 --> 01:35:43,072
It must've scratched you.

1294
01:35:43,274 --> 01:35:44,797
Yeah.

1295
01:35:47,278 --> 01:35:49,850
Or maybe it scratched me or something.

1296
01:35:52,851 --> 01:35:54,690
I better get to safety.

1297
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:56,183
The cub.

1298
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:58,554
- I better get the, uh...
- Of course.

1299
01:35:58,589 --> 01:36:00,052
...the cub to safety.

1300
01:36:06,913 --> 01:36:08,538
Fiyero.

1301
01:36:18,828 --> 01:36:21,631
<i>Hands touch...

1302
01:36:23,897 --> 01:36:27,120
<i>Eyes meet...

1303
01:36:29,194 --> 01:36:32,673
<i>Sudden silence...

1304
01:36:33,115 --> 01:36:36,585
<i>Sudden heat...

1305
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:44,594
<i>Hearts leap in a giddy whirl...

1306
01:36:45,169 --> 01:36:51,812
<i>He could be that boy...

1307
01:36:52,801 --> 01:36:58,939
<i>But I'm not that girl...

1308
01:36:59,123 --> 01:37:05,072
<i>Don't dream too far...

1309
01:37:05,855 --> 01:37:11,458
<i>Don't lose sight of who you are...

1310
01:37:11,693 --> 01:37:18,437
<i>Don't remember that rush of joy...

1311
01:37:18,572 --> 01:37:24,470
<i>He could be that boy...

1312
01:37:24,791 --> 01:37:30,136
<i>I'm not that girl...

1313
01:37:30,171 --> 01:37:34,454
<i>Every so often we long to steal...

1314
01:37:34,492 --> 01:37:38,702
<i>To the land of what-might-have-been...

1315
01:37:38,737 --> 01:37:43,565
<i>But that doesn't soften
the ache we feel...

1316
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:49,672
<i>When reality sets back in...

1317
01:37:51,217 --> 01:37:57,767
<i>Blithe smile,
lithe limb...

1318
01:37:57,831 --> 01:38:03,431
<i>She who's winsome,
she wins him...

1319
01:38:04,153 --> 01:38:10,330
<i>Gold hair with a gentle curl...

1320
01:38:10,365 --> 01:38:16,135
<i>That's the girl he chose...

1321
01:38:16,637 --> 01:38:22,134
<i>And heaven knows...

1322
01:38:23,015 --> 01:38:29,093
<i>I'm not that girl...

1323
01:38:32,807 --> 01:38:34,432
Dearest.

1324
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:36,948
Oh, my goodness.
I was worried sick.

1325
01:38:38,604 --> 01:38:43,252
<i>Don't wish, don't start...

1326
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:50,236
<i>Wishing only wounds the heart...

1327
01:38:50,666 --> 01:38:59,178
<i>I wasn't born for
the rose and pearl...

1328
01:38:59,383 --> 01:39:05,600
<i>There's a girl I know...

1329
01:39:06,032 --> 01:39:10,869
<i>He loves her so...

1330
01:39:17,968 --> 01:39:29,703
<i>I'm not that girl...

1331
01:39:37,589 --> 01:39:39,564
<i>Miss Elphaba.

1332
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:41,196
<i>Come at once.

1333
01:39:47,641 --> 01:39:49,175
There.

1334
01:39:51,295 --> 01:39:53,607
Elphie, you gotta get down there.
Come on.

1335
01:39:58,398 --> 01:40:01,534
Miss Elphaba,
I finally heard back from the Wizard.

1336
01:40:01,689 --> 01:40:03,031
Look.

1337
01:40:10,434 --> 01:40:12,879
- Oh. Stop.
- I know.

1338
01:40:13,224 --> 01:40:16,266
I... I just cannot.

1339
01:40:27,417 --> 01:40:29,634
It's yours.
Open it.

1340
01:40:35,865 --> 01:40:39,810
His Royal Ozness,
the Wonderful Wizard of Oz...

1341
01:40:40,574 --> 01:40:42,737
...summons you most ceremony-ishly...

1342
01:40:42,742 --> 01:40:45,911
...to his personal palace
in the Emerald City.

1343
01:40:46,638 --> 01:40:48,260
Um... Wait... Um...

1344
01:40:48,574 --> 01:40:50,811
This invitation is non-transferable.

1345
01:41:02,096 --> 01:41:04,789
This is your chance to make good.

1346
01:41:05,747 --> 01:41:09,176
Of course, you're going to have to
prove yourself first.

1347
01:41:09,237 --> 01:41:10,327
Prove myself?

1348
01:41:10,375 --> 01:41:12,520
Prove yourself worthy.

1349
01:41:12,555 --> 01:41:16,092
Dearie, this is the Wizard of Oz.

1350
01:41:16,704 --> 01:41:18,810
If he's gonna grant your heart's desire...

1351
01:41:18,887 --> 01:41:21,178
But prove myself how?
I...

1352
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:23,403
I'm not ready.
It's too soon.

1353
01:41:23,408 --> 01:41:25,338
Don't be so pessi-mystical.

1354
01:41:25,373 --> 01:41:29,071
I, too, had to prove my powers
when I met the Wizard.

1355
01:41:29,248 --> 01:41:32,304
You'll find a way.
I have faith in you.

1356
01:41:36,957 --> 01:41:40,663
Not to fret.
Weather is my specialty.

1357
01:41:43,396 --> 01:41:45,122
Mustn't let you get wet.

1358
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:49,131
- Okay. I'll make a hand umbrella.
- My hair. Thank you.

1359
01:41:57,644 --> 01:42:01,110
Not when you're
on the cusp of greatness.

1360
01:42:31,608 --> 01:42:35,283
All aboard for the Emerald City.

1361
01:42:35,518 --> 01:42:38,283
Father, this is Boq,
the boy I wrote to you about.

1362
01:42:38,334 --> 01:42:42,058
Oh, yes. Governor Thropp,
good to meet you.

1363
01:42:42,205 --> 01:42:44,308
Oh, I've heard so much about you.

1364
01:42:44,343 --> 01:42:47,483
My Nessarose is very precious to me...

1365
01:42:47,518 --> 01:42:50,287
...so you see you take
good care of her.

1366
01:42:52,258 --> 01:42:54,074
I... I understand.

1367
01:42:54,894 --> 01:42:56,297
Good.

1368
01:42:57,666 --> 01:42:59,040
Elphie.

1369
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:00,437
Elphie, the train is here.

1370
01:43:00,472 --> 01:43:03,301
And it came with the cutest little man
with a mustache. You gotta see him.

1371
01:43:04,308 --> 01:43:06,524
Oh, Elphie.
How will we manage without you?

1372
01:43:06,797 --> 01:43:08,092
You won't even notice I'm gone.

1373
01:43:08,304 --> 01:43:09,925
- Uh, you have Fiyero.
- Oh.

1374
01:43:10,094 --> 01:43:11,904
Um, speaking of Fiyero,
where is he?

1375
01:43:12,129 --> 01:43:14,285
Not that I expected him
to come and say goodbye, but...

1376
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:16,170
I mean, we barely know each other.

1377
01:43:16,175 --> 01:43:18,614
Well, I barely know him anymore either.

1378
01:43:18,857 --> 01:43:20,543
He's been different.

1379
01:43:21,488 --> 01:43:23,983
He's distant and moodified.

1380
01:43:25,279 --> 01:43:26,926
And he's been thinking...

1381
01:43:26,931 --> 01:43:29,763
...which really worries me.

1382
01:43:30,231 --> 01:43:32,107
It all started the day
Dr. Dillamond was fired.

1383
01:43:32,111 --> 01:43:35,159
I mean, who knew he cared so much
about that old goat?

1384
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:37,400
Look. He did come.

1385
01:43:37,405 --> 01:43:38,736
Dearest.

1386
01:43:38,989 --> 01:43:41,723
We're over here, darling.
Come.

1387
01:43:42,323 --> 01:43:43,524
Hi.

1388
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:47,587
- Elphaba.
- Fiyero.

1389
01:43:49,217 --> 01:43:50,680
I'm happy for you.

1390
01:43:50,908 --> 01:43:52,436
Thank you.

1391
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:55,306
Yes.
We are both so happy.

1392
01:43:55,311 --> 01:43:58,498
- I've been thinking...
- Yeah. I heard.

1393
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:01,979
...about the, uh, the lion cub
and Dr. Dillamond.

1394
01:44:03,837 --> 01:44:05,712
I think about that day a lot.

1395
01:44:06,345 --> 01:44:07,747
So do I.

1396
01:44:14,322 --> 01:44:15,951
Oh, me too.

1397
01:44:16,293 --> 01:44:18,181
Oh, me too.
Me too.

1398
01:44:18,825 --> 01:44:20,630
I think about it constantly.

1399
01:44:20,942 --> 01:44:22,700
I mean, poor Dr. Dillamond.

1400
01:44:23,565 --> 01:44:25,715
It makes one want to...

1401
01:44:27,361 --> 01:44:28,998
...to take a stand.

1402
01:44:30,346 --> 01:44:31,982
In fact... Excuse me.

1403
01:44:32,474 --> 01:44:36,502
Everyone.
Please, I have an announcement.

1404
01:44:40,534 --> 01:44:43,186
I am changing my name.

1405
01:44:44,155 --> 01:44:45,633
- What?
- What?

1406
01:44:45,668 --> 01:44:47,200
- Your name?
- Yes.

1407
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:49,400
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1408
01:44:49,541 --> 01:44:54,260
Since Dr. Dillamond used to have his own
goat-like way of pronouncifying my name...

1409
01:44:54,356 --> 01:44:55,786
...in solidarity...

1410
01:44:55,897 --> 01:44:58,910
...and in order to express my outrage...

1411
01:44:59,274 --> 01:45:02,954
...I will henceforward be known
no longer as Galinda...

1412
01:45:04,228 --> 01:45:05,852
...but simply...

1413
01:45:08,501 --> 01:45:10,404
...Glinda.

1414
01:45:10,567 --> 01:45:12,080
Clapping.

1415
01:45:12,147 --> 01:45:14,505
- She's so good.
- Oh, she so is.

1416
01:45:14,575 --> 01:45:16,567
Such braverism.

1417
01:45:19,717 --> 01:45:20,782
Glinda.

1418
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:24,692
Galinda no more,
Glinda henceforth.

1419
01:45:25,221 --> 01:45:26,721
Glinda, you're wonderful.

1420
01:45:29,416 --> 01:45:30,777
Glinda.

1421
01:45:44,405 --> 01:45:45,904
Good luck.

1422
01:45:53,031 --> 01:45:55,196
See?
There.

1423
01:45:55,234 --> 01:45:57,247
Wha... What is that?

1424
01:45:57,282 --> 01:45:58,233
Don't be upset, Galinda.

1425
01:45:58,245 --> 01:46:01,053
It's Glinda now. Stupid.
I don't even know what made me say it.

1426
01:46:01,223 --> 01:46:03,339
It doesn't even matter what your name is.
Everyone loves you.

1427
01:46:03,344 --> 01:46:04,928
I don't care.

1428
01:46:05,001 --> 01:46:06,530
I want him.

1429
01:46:07,324 --> 01:46:10,334
I don't even think he's perfect anymore,
and I still want him.

1430
01:46:10,612 --> 01:46:13,234
This must be what
other people feel like.

1431
01:46:13,887 --> 01:46:15,778
How do they bear it?

1432
01:46:16,516 --> 01:46:19,871
<i>All aboard for the Emerald City.

1433
01:46:19,875 --> 01:46:21,519
The mustache man.

1434
01:46:21,739 --> 01:46:23,529
Hey, come on.
The train.

1435
01:46:26,621 --> 01:46:28,099
Thank you.

1436
01:46:33,851 --> 01:46:36,060
Yes, we love you.

1437
01:46:49,535 --> 01:46:52,857
- Stand clear of the doors.
- Goodbye.

1438
01:46:57,283 --> 01:46:59,138
Oh. Wait.

1439
01:46:59,173 --> 01:47:01,362
Oh, excuse me.
Um...

1440
01:47:01,397 --> 01:47:04,954
Elphie, here.
I forgot to give you this. Oh.

1441
01:47:05,898 --> 01:47:07,269
Bye.

1442
01:47:16,129 --> 01:47:18,172
- Come with me.
- What?

1443
01:47:18,207 --> 01:47:19,493
To meet the Wizard.

1444
01:47:19,548 --> 01:47:20,664
What are you saying?

1445
01:47:20,694 --> 01:47:22,712
Get on the train.
You're gonna miss it.

1446
01:47:22,747 --> 01:47:23,943
I wouldn't want to impose.

1447
01:47:23,963 --> 01:47:25,836
It doesn't matter.
Just come with me.

1448
01:47:25,895 --> 01:47:28,671
I couldn't possibly. This is your moment.
I'm coming.

1449
01:47:46,950 --> 01:47:49,325
<i>One short day...

1450
01:47:49,571 --> 01:47:54,368
<i>If you only have, if you only have...

1451
01:47:54,403 --> 01:47:59,503
<i>One short day...

1452
01:48:00,421 --> 01:48:06,261
<i>One short day in the Emerald City...

1453
01:48:06,266 --> 01:48:08,603
<i>Now arriving
at Emerald City Station.

1454
01:48:08,690 --> 01:48:14,808
<i>One short day in the Emerald City...

1455
01:48:14,843 --> 01:48:16,985
<i>- One short day...
- One short day...

1456
01:48:16,990 --> 01:48:18,975
<i>- One short day...
- One short...

1457
01:48:18,980 --> 01:48:21,408
<i>Day...

1458
01:48:21,566 --> 01:48:28,799
<i>In the Emerald City...

1459
01:48:28,804 --> 01:48:33,660
<i>Emerald City...

1460
01:48:33,665 --> 01:48:37,531
<i>One short day in the Emerald City...

1461
01:48:37,573 --> 01:48:41,494
<i>One short day
full of so much to do...

1462
01:48:41,624 --> 01:48:45,355
<i>Every way that you look in this city...

1463
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:49,212
<i>There's something exquisite
you'll want to visit...

1464
01:48:49,247 --> 01:48:51,769
<i>Before the day's through...

1465
01:48:53,245 --> 01:48:55,495
<i>There are buildings
tall as Quoxwood trees...

1466
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:57,590
<i>- Dress salons...
- And libraries...

1467
01:48:57,625 --> 01:48:58,911
<i>- Palaces...
- Museums...

1468
01:48:58,916 --> 01:49:01,262
<i>A hundred strong...

1469
01:49:01,383 --> 01:49:03,636
<i>There are wonders
like I've never seen...

1470
01:49:03,641 --> 01:49:05,591
<i>- It's all grand...
- And it's all green...

1471
01:49:05,617 --> 01:49:08,769
<i>I think we've found the place
where we belong...

1472
01:49:08,804 --> 01:49:13,524
<i>I wanna be in this hoi polloi...

1473
01:49:13,586 --> 01:49:15,804
<i>So I'll be back for good someday...

1474
01:49:15,809 --> 01:49:17,716
<i>To make my life and make my way...

1475
01:49:17,721 --> 01:49:23,968
<i>But for today, we'll wander and enjoy...

1476
01:49:23,995 --> 01:49:27,772
<i>One short day in the Emerald City...

1477
01:49:27,850 --> 01:49:31,796
<i>One short day
to have a lifetime of fun...

1478
01:49:31,837 --> 01:49:33,210
<i>One short day...

1479
01:49:33,227 --> 01:49:35,700
<i>And we're warning the city...

1480
01:49:35,705 --> 01:49:39,519
<i>Now that we're in here,
you'll know we've been here...

1481
01:49:39,554 --> 01:49:42,594
<i>Before we are done...

1482
01:49:42,626 --> 01:49:47,456
<i>Presenting the absolute factual story
of our Wonderful Wizard of Oz...

1483
01:49:47,491 --> 01:49:50,425
<i>...starring the Emerald City Players.

1484
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:55,574
<i>Long, long ago,
long before we can recall...

1485
01:49:55,807 --> 01:50:02,073
<i>There lived here in Oz,
the magical Wise Ones...

1486
01:50:03,249 --> 01:50:06,407
<i>The magical Wise Ones...

1487
01:50:06,442 --> 01:50:12,675
<i>The wisest of them all...

1488
01:50:17,774 --> 01:50:22,439
<i>We will not live forever,
that I can foresee...

1489
01:50:22,444 --> 01:50:25,860
<i>So let us set down all our magic...

1490
01:50:25,895 --> 01:50:28,254
<i>In a strange and secret language...

1491
01:50:28,289 --> 01:50:29,723
<i>In a book...

1492
01:50:29,891 --> 01:50:32,504
<i>The Grimmerie...

1493
01:50:32,509 --> 01:50:36,653
<i>The Grimmerie...

1494
01:50:36,688 --> 01:50:41,638
<i>But time ticked ever onward
day by day...

1495
01:50:41,751 --> 01:50:46,413
<i>And all those who could read it
passed away...

1496
01:50:46,448 --> 01:50:51,389
<i>Till one day no one could...

1497
01:50:51,772 --> 01:50:55,435
But the Wise Ones left a prophecy.

1498
01:50:57,937 --> 01:51:00,784
<i>In Oz's darkest hour...

1499
01:51:00,819 --> 01:51:03,578
<i>Though we cannot say when...

1500
01:51:03,613 --> 01:51:07,122
<i>There will come one with a power...

1501
01:51:07,157 --> 01:51:11,778
<i>To read the Grimmerie again...

1502
01:51:11,783 --> 01:51:15,274
<i>And Oz, which had been sad and blah...

1503
01:51:15,279 --> 01:51:18,299
<i>Once more will sing a joyous...

1504
01:51:18,334 --> 01:51:22,965
<i>Ah...

1505
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,245
Look.

1506
01:51:26,695 --> 01:51:30,285
A man in a balloon arriving from the sky.

1507
01:51:30,751 --> 01:51:33,634
Maybe he is here
to fulfill the prophecy...

1508
01:51:33,669 --> 01:51:36,005
...but can he read the Grimmerie?

1509
01:51:36,102 --> 01:51:41,980
<i>This man who comes out of the blue,
is he the prophecy?

1510
01:51:42,015 --> 01:51:45,417
<i>There's one way we'll know
if it's true...

1511
01:51:45,452 --> 01:51:53,352
<i>Fetch the Grimmerie...

1512
01:51:53,399 --> 01:52:00,245
Omaha. Omaha.

1513
01:52:00,387 --> 01:52:03,544
He can read it.
He must be...

1514
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:06,443
...a Wizard.

1515
01:52:06,830 --> 01:52:09,680
<i>The prophecy fulfilled...

1516
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:13,142
<i>What merriness he'll bring...

1517
01:52:13,167 --> 01:52:18,340
<i>Now every Ozian
raise a voice and sing...

1518
01:52:18,375 --> 01:52:25,104
<i>And sing, and sing...

1519
01:52:26,166 --> 01:52:27,881
<i>Who's the mage...

1520
01:52:27,939 --> 01:52:32,397
<i>Whose major itinerary
is making all Oz merrier?..

1521
01:52:32,432 --> 01:52:34,237
<i>Who's the sage...

1522
01:52:34,272 --> 01:52:38,759
<i>Who sagely sailed in
to save our posteriors?..

1523
01:52:38,837 --> 01:52:42,372
<i>Whose enthuse for hot-air ballooning...

1524
01:52:42,384 --> 01:52:45,143
<i>Has all of Oz honeymooning?..

1525
01:52:47,684 --> 01:52:51,628
<i>Isn't he wonderful,
our wonderful Wizard?..

1526
01:52:51,812 --> 01:52:54,011
<i>- One short day...
- Who's the mage whose major...

1527
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:58,077
<i>- In the Emerald City...
- Itinerary is making all Oz merrier?..

1528
01:52:58,316 --> 01:53:01,226
<i>- One short day...
- Who's the sage who sagely...

1529
01:53:01,231 --> 01:53:04,671
<i>- To have a lifetime of fun...
- Sailed in to save our posteriors?..

1530
01:53:04,676 --> 01:53:10,818
<i>What a way to be seeing the city...

1531
01:53:10,853 --> 01:53:13,610
<i>Where so many roam to...

1532
01:53:14,895 --> 01:53:17,885
<i>We'll call it home too...

1533
01:53:18,924 --> 01:53:23,886
<i>And then, just like now,
we can say...

1534
01:53:23,921 --> 01:53:26,566
<i>We're just two friends...

1535
01:53:26,601 --> 01:53:29,035
<i>Two good friends...

1536
01:53:29,089 --> 01:53:33,382
<i>Two best friends...

1537
01:53:36,186 --> 01:53:37,749
<i>Sharing one wonderful...

1538
01:53:37,754 --> 01:53:41,673
<i>One short...

1539
01:53:53,450 --> 01:53:56,002
The Wizard will see you now.

1540
01:53:56,041 --> 01:54:00,376
<i>Day...

1541
01:54:50,895 --> 01:54:52,574
Hello.

1542
01:55:16,318 --> 01:55:17,816
Elphaba Thropp.

1543
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:19,496
Listen to me.

1544
01:55:19,529 --> 01:55:21,234
You can do this.

1545
01:55:21,922 --> 01:55:24,919
You can do anything.

1546
01:56:02,465 --> 01:56:04,318
- What is that sound?
- Oh, I don't know.

1547
01:56:06,688 --> 01:56:08,689
- No.
- No. Go... Go, go, go.

1548
01:56:08,690 --> 01:56:11,026
- Go. Elphaba. Go.
- I don't...

1549
01:56:14,988 --> 01:56:19,900
I am Oz.

1550
01:56:19,937 --> 01:56:21,352
Oh, Elphie.

1551
01:56:21,387 --> 01:56:26,585
I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.

1552
01:56:27,432 --> 01:56:29,253
Who are you?

1553
01:56:29,288 --> 01:56:33,645
And why do you seek me?

1554
01:56:33,722 --> 01:56:36,157
Elphie. Say something.
Say something.

1555
01:56:36,215 --> 01:56:37,396
- What am I supposed to say?
- Anything.

1556
01:56:37,401 --> 01:56:40,007
- Say something.
- Um...

1557
01:56:40,252 --> 01:56:42,945
Say something.

1558
01:56:43,856 --> 01:56:46,171
My name is Elphaba Thropp...

1559
01:56:46,697 --> 01:56:47,910
...Your Ozness.

1560
01:56:47,941 --> 01:56:48,960
And... And this is...

1561
01:56:48,995 --> 01:56:51,524
El... Elphaba, is that you?

1562
01:56:54,777 --> 01:56:56,728
Elphaba Thropp?

1563
01:56:56,763 --> 01:56:57,725
A man.

1564
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:59,311
Elphaba Thropp?

1565
01:56:59,331 --> 01:57:01,021
I didn't know it was you.

1566
01:57:01,098 --> 01:57:02,737
You made it.

1567
01:57:03,725 --> 01:57:08,746
Uh, sorry about all that.
I didn't mean to startle you.

1568
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:14,008
You know, when I'm back there,
I cannot make out people's faces.

1569
01:57:15,085 --> 01:57:16,860
Well, it's just so...

1570
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:18,816
It's so great to meet you...

1571
01:57:22,528 --> 01:57:24,714
- So great to... Hang on. What's that?
- What?

1572
01:57:24,993 --> 01:57:26,719
- I'm so sorry. May I?
- Sure. Yes.

1573
01:57:26,724 --> 01:57:28,733
Okay now, just... It's okay.

1574
01:57:31,943 --> 01:57:34,264
For you.
My special guest.

1575
01:57:34,576 --> 01:57:38,037
That's a keepsake for you to cherish
for all of your days.

1576
01:57:38,072 --> 01:57:41,622
Very kind of you, Your Ozness.
Thank you.

1577
01:57:42,172 --> 01:57:46,562
And this is... uh...
an additional... unexpected...

1578
01:57:46,586 --> 01:57:48,066
Hi.
What's your name?

1579
01:57:48,108 --> 01:57:49,623
Glinda.

1580
01:57:50,361 --> 01:57:51,964
The 'Ga' is silent.

1581
01:57:52,012 --> 01:57:54,230
Hello, Belinda.

1582
01:57:54,723 --> 01:57:57,267
Uh, what you looking at there? Oh, yeah.

1583
01:57:57,302 --> 01:58:00,356
Ugh. Well, I don't know.
I think it's a bit much.

1584
01:58:00,827 --> 01:58:03,683
But, uh, folks have come to expect
that sort of thing.

1585
01:58:03,718 --> 01:58:06,208
<i>And you gotta give the people...

1586
01:58:07,058 --> 01:58:09,060
<i>What they want...

1587
01:58:09,522 --> 01:58:10,820
Thank you.
Thank you.

1588
01:58:10,855 --> 01:58:15,262
But, if you think that's something to see,
wait till you see this.

1589
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:19,918
I give you the Oz of tomorrow.

1590
01:58:25,176 --> 01:58:27,916
Yes. Yes.

1591
01:58:29,226 --> 01:58:33,570
Now, I don't know if your eyes have already
fallen upon this long and winding path.

1592
01:58:33,575 --> 01:58:34,780
Do you see that?

1593
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:36,928
I think people need direction.

1594
01:58:36,963 --> 01:58:39,086
When this thing gets built,
everybody, always,

1595
01:58:39,087 --> 01:58:42,364
...is going to remember
that if you just follow the road...

1596
01:58:42,499 --> 01:58:44,044
Follow the road...

1597
01:58:44,079 --> 01:58:47,382
...it's gonna lead you right to me.

1598
01:58:48,153 --> 01:58:52,839
Recently, I've gotten a little stuck trying to figure
out what color the bricks of that road ought to be.

1599
01:58:52,874 --> 01:58:55,060
So, I jerry-rigged this thing up...

1600
01:58:55,144 --> 01:58:57,695
- ...which does that.
- Oh.

1601
01:58:58,222 --> 01:59:00,953
Uh, Elphaba,
you give that a whirl.

1602
01:59:01,067 --> 01:59:03,257
Oh, sure.
Um, let's try.

1603
01:59:06,245 --> 01:59:08,191
What about green?

1604
01:59:09,167 --> 01:59:12,031
Um... Yellow.

1605
01:59:12,279 --> 01:59:13,869
Maybe purple?

1606
01:59:14,769 --> 01:59:17,365
Wait.
Just go back one, please.

1607
01:59:17,384 --> 01:59:18,925
The yellow, really?

1608
01:59:19,014 --> 01:59:20,404
Yes.

1609
01:59:20,735 --> 01:59:22,131
It just says 'road' to me.

1610
01:59:22,166 --> 01:59:23,900
Let me see.

1611
01:59:24,549 --> 01:59:26,487
And... Oh.

1612
01:59:26,522 --> 01:59:28,691
Yellow brick road?

1613
01:59:28,726 --> 01:59:29,891
I don't know.

1614
01:59:29,926 --> 01:59:31,805
- Oh, hey. Come up here.
- Oh.

1615
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:34,750
Come up here with me...
in my sandbox.

1616
01:59:34,770 --> 01:59:36,331
Step right up.
Watch this.

1617
01:59:36,336 --> 01:59:41,747
So here's where we are,
and when we open it up, inside...

1618
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:43,815
That's you.

1619
01:59:43,820 --> 01:59:44,850
Well, it is me.

1620
01:59:44,917 --> 01:59:46,313
Yeah, it is me.

1621
01:59:46,543 --> 01:59:47,717
I like it. I shouldn't.

1622
01:59:47,752 --> 01:59:49,183
I'm here by myself a lot.

1623
01:59:49,218 --> 01:59:51,361
Anyway.
I don't, uh... Oh.

1624
01:59:52,189 --> 01:59:53,422
I forgot.

1625
01:59:53,457 --> 01:59:55,444
If my head wasn't attached,
it would... uh...

1626
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:58,464
...I'd... I'd leave it in...
uh... Munchkinland.

1627
01:59:58,499 --> 02:00:01,007
Hey, you know what I had made?
Look. Special.

1628
02:00:04,655 --> 02:00:06,021
Keep that.

1629
02:00:06,084 --> 02:00:08,394
I... No, I mean it.
Keep it... Keep it forever.

1630
02:00:08,429 --> 02:00:11,418
Because at some point,
who knows?

1631
02:00:11,463 --> 02:00:16,605
We might be putting your little artifact
in there right next to mine.

1632
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,890
Because maybe someday...

1633
02:00:17,895 --> 02:00:22,331
...you're gonna be calling
this whole pile of stones your home.

1634
02:00:25,362 --> 02:00:26,901
Elphie.

1635
02:00:28,563 --> 02:00:30,184
She's green.

1636
02:00:30,371 --> 02:00:31,855
Oh, well...

1637
02:00:32,316 --> 02:00:33,902
...she doesn't have to be.

1638
02:00:34,059 --> 02:00:37,284
Would that be your...
your heart's desire?

1639
02:00:47,023 --> 02:00:48,419
No.

1640
02:00:51,573 --> 02:00:52,978
No.

1641
02:00:54,778 --> 02:00:57,562
My heart's desire
is for you to help the animals.

1642
02:00:57,942 --> 02:01:00,545
Something bad is happening to them,
and they need you.

1643
02:01:01,466 --> 02:01:03,264
I had a feeling you were gonna say that.

1644
02:01:03,299 --> 02:01:05,491
And I agree wholeheartedly.

1645
02:01:05,626 --> 02:01:07,872
Yeah. Wow, that's
the darndest thing.

1646
02:01:07,907 --> 02:01:12,156
It's almost like I.. uh...
I already know you.

1647
02:01:13,034 --> 02:01:14,689
I knew you'd understand.

1648
02:01:15,563 --> 02:01:18,161
That makes me...
That makes me so happy.

1649
02:01:18,196 --> 02:01:22,843
Well, that's what I love best.
Making people happy.

1650
02:01:25,295 --> 02:01:27,827
<i>I am a sentimental man...

1651
02:01:28,618 --> 02:01:33,701
<i>Who always longed to be a father...

1652
02:01:34,396 --> 02:01:37,986
<i>That's why I do
the best I can...

1653
02:01:38,217 --> 02:01:43,718
<i>To treat each citizen
of Oz as son...

1654
02:01:44,269 --> 02:01:46,167
<i>Or daughter...

1655
02:01:46,972 --> 02:01:52,312
<i>So Elphaba,
I'd like to raise you high...

1656
02:01:52,705 --> 02:02:00,880
<i>'Cause I think everyone
deserves the chance to fly...

1657
02:02:04,367 --> 02:02:07,980
<i>And helping you with your ascent...

1658
02:02:08,015 --> 02:02:11,896
<i>Allows me to feel so...

1659
02:02:13,976 --> 02:02:16,046
<i>Parental...

1660
02:02:18,660 --> 02:02:25,049
<i>For I am...

1661
02:02:25,672 --> 02:02:30,348
<i>A sentimental...

1662
02:02:33,564 --> 02:02:37,385
<i>Man...

1663
02:03:03,217 --> 02:03:05,435
That's enough of that.
Okay.

1664
02:03:05,570 --> 02:03:07,987
Uh... Uh...
Away with the moon.

1665
02:03:09,879 --> 02:03:11,178
Is that...

1666
02:03:12,532 --> 02:03:14,691
- Oh, it is.
- It is.

1667
02:03:14,726 --> 02:03:17,716
Madame Morrible,
what are you doing here?

1668
02:03:17,972 --> 02:03:20,338
Oh, dearie.

1669
02:03:20,528 --> 02:03:23,070
I couldn't miss your big moment.

1670
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:30,960
Neither could you, I see.

1671
02:03:31,314 --> 02:03:32,452
I...

1672
02:03:42,893 --> 02:03:44,295
I don't believe it.

1673
02:03:44,763 --> 02:03:46,334
Is that the Grimmerie?

1674
02:03:47,237 --> 02:03:48,548
Yes.

1675
02:03:49,550 --> 02:03:54,906
That's the ancient book of wisdom,
thaumaturgy and enchantments.

1676
02:04:06,385 --> 02:04:08,090
Can I touch it?

1677
02:04:09,133 --> 02:04:10,643
No.

1678
02:04:12,109 --> 02:04:13,905
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1679
02:04:13,955 --> 02:04:15,753
She may not be ready.

1680
02:04:15,788 --> 02:04:20,363
Casting a spell with the Grimmerie,
that's a mighty tall order.

1681
02:04:21,030 --> 02:04:22,460
I... You know, I should know.

1682
02:04:22,495 --> 02:04:24,395
You're right.
We mustn't rush her.

1683
02:04:24,430 --> 02:04:26,392
Perhaps today has been
too overwhelming.

1684
02:04:26,449 --> 02:04:27,664
No.

1685
02:04:28,056 --> 02:04:29,548
Please.

1686
02:04:29,860 --> 02:04:31,503
Let me try.

1687
02:04:32,290 --> 02:04:34,081
Let me prove myself.

1688
02:04:59,454 --> 02:05:00,884
Sweet Oz.

1689
02:05:00,949 --> 02:05:02,894
It opened for her.

1690
02:05:16,413 --> 02:05:19,036
So, which spell are you
gonna start with?

1691
02:05:19,071 --> 02:05:21,396
We've been working on levitation.

1692
02:05:21,733 --> 02:05:25,575
Levitation?
Oh, that's interesting.

1693
02:05:25,856 --> 02:05:29,331
Do you know that...
um... Chistery here...

1694
02:05:29,670 --> 02:05:32,964
Ha... Have you ladies met...
uh... Ch... Chistery...

1695
02:05:32,999 --> 02:05:35,966
...the leader of my...
my Emerald Guards?

1696
02:05:36,001 --> 02:05:37,379
Pleased to meet you.

1697
02:05:37,497 --> 02:05:39,138
Uh, he'd hate to admit this.

1698
02:05:39,362 --> 02:05:41,425
Does not like talking about himself.

1699
02:05:41,730 --> 02:05:46,752
But he watches birds
so longingly...

1700
02:05:46,761 --> 02:05:48,684
...every morning.

1701
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:50,612
Birds?

1702
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:54,172
- How can I help him? I... I don't...
- Elphie, look.

1703
02:06:01,592 --> 02:06:03,325
Are those words?

1704
02:06:05,442 --> 02:06:07,478
The lost language.

1705
02:06:07,598 --> 02:06:10,405
Our lost language of spells.

1706
02:06:10,805 --> 02:06:14,646
Don't be discouraged
if you can't decipher it.

1707
02:06:15,077 --> 02:06:18,968
Dearie, I, myself,
can only read a word or two...

1708
02:06:19,176 --> 02:06:20,734
...and that took years.

1709
02:06:26,455 --> 02:06:28,543
- Oh, Elphie.
- Praise Oz.

1710
02:06:47,738 --> 02:06:49,385
What did I tell you?

1711
02:07:03,445 --> 02:07:04,538
Chistery, are you all right?

1712
02:07:05,238 --> 02:07:06,443
Chistery?

1713
02:07:09,810 --> 02:07:11,687
It's just the transition, dearie.

1714
02:07:11,757 --> 02:07:13,530
It's just the transition.

1715
02:07:28,938 --> 02:07:30,629
But it's hurting him.

1716
02:07:31,636 --> 02:07:32,424
Chistery.

1717
02:07:32,478 --> 02:07:34,083
Don't bite. Don't bite.

1718
02:08:03,983 --> 02:08:05,381
Glory-osky.

1719
02:08:05,438 --> 02:08:08,497
You did it.
You actually did it.

1720
02:08:19,558 --> 02:08:20,755
He's in pain.

1721
02:08:20,838 --> 02:08:22,610
Quick.
How do I reverse it?

1722
02:08:22,645 --> 02:08:24,283
- Reverse...
- How do I reverse it?

1723
02:08:24,450 --> 02:08:27,583
A spell from the Grimmerie
can never be reversed.

1724
02:08:32,270 --> 02:08:34,288
Elphaba. Elphaba.

1725
02:08:34,293 --> 02:08:36,131
No. No.

1726
02:08:53,127 --> 02:08:56,158
I knew she had the power.
I told you.

1727
02:08:56,193 --> 02:08:58,133
Elphie, this is astoundifying.

1728
02:08:58,139 --> 02:09:00,315
It's just what we hoped for.
Eyes in the skies.

1729
02:09:00,350 --> 02:09:03,580
Yes.
They'll make perfect spies.

1730
02:09:03,596 --> 02:09:04,973
Spies?

1731
02:09:06,337 --> 02:09:08,814
- Elphaba? Elphaba?
- Oh... uh... no. No. Uh...

1732
02:09:08,819 --> 02:09:10,062
Elphie?

1733
02:09:10,411 --> 02:09:11,653
Elphie.

1734
02:09:13,247 --> 02:09:14,525
You're right.
That's a very harsh word.

1735
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:17,379
Oh, scouts. What about scouts?
Because they're gonna be flying around Oz

1736
02:09:17,384 --> 02:09:19,563
...reporting back
on any seditious animal activity...

1737
02:09:19,598 --> 02:09:21,317
Seditious animal activity?
What does that mean?

1738
02:09:21,352 --> 02:09:24,365
Elphie. I'm sure the Wizard
has a good reason.

1739
02:09:28,912 --> 02:09:30,504
It's you.

1740
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:33,094
You're behind all of this.

1741
02:09:34,368 --> 02:09:36,322
You're the reason why
people are turning against the animals.

1742
02:09:36,327 --> 02:09:38,113
You... It's all because of you.

1743
02:09:39,512 --> 02:09:41,333
We're doing this
to keep people safe.

1744
02:09:41,393 --> 02:09:43,700
All of Oz will benefit.

1745
02:09:43,879 --> 02:09:45,582
And you've known all along.

1746
02:09:47,091 --> 02:09:48,721
Since the day you met me.

1747
02:09:48,756 --> 02:09:51,327
You will benefit too, dearie.

1748
02:09:51,688 --> 02:09:53,579
- You must trust me.
- Don't. Don't.

1749
02:09:53,653 --> 02:09:55,268
El... Elphaba.

1750
02:09:55,303 --> 02:09:59,222
When I first got here, oh,
there was discord.

1751
02:09:59,227 --> 02:10:00,337
There was discontent.

1752
02:10:00,372 --> 02:10:02,202
And back where I come from...

1753
02:10:02,302 --> 02:10:06,966
...everybody knows that the best way
to bring folks together...

1754
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:10,860
...is to give them a...
a real good enemy.

1755
02:10:11,731 --> 02:10:14,424
If you wanted s... spies,
why wouldn't you just...

1756
02:10:14,491 --> 02:10:17,146
...why wouldn't you just
make them yourself? You...

1757
02:10:25,591 --> 02:10:26,994
Elphaba.

1758
02:10:27,847 --> 02:10:29,256
Elphaba.

1759
02:10:29,433 --> 02:10:31,895
You are talking to the Wizard of Oz.

1760
02:10:34,735 --> 02:10:35,954
Read it.

1761
02:10:36,074 --> 02:10:37,435
Cast a spell.

1762
02:10:37,625 --> 02:10:39,041
Read it.

1763
02:10:39,245 --> 02:10:40,827
- Elphaba.
- Don't...

1764
02:10:45,381 --> 02:10:47,073
You can't, can you?

1765
02:10:49,370 --> 02:10:50,843
Can you?

1766
02:10:57,326 --> 02:10:59,180
That's why you need
all of this.

1767
02:10:59,215 --> 02:11:02,796
And you need spies and...
and animals in cages and an enemy.

1768
02:11:02,801 --> 02:11:04,035
You...

1769
02:11:04,373 --> 02:11:06,476
You have no real power.

1770
02:11:06,521 --> 02:11:08,390
Exactly.

1771
02:11:08,565 --> 02:11:10,448
That's why I need you.

1772
02:11:10,483 --> 02:11:13,741
Think of your future, dearie.

1773
02:11:13,742 --> 02:11:15,373
Stay back.

1774
02:11:17,973 --> 02:11:20,192
Elphie, listen to them.

1775
02:11:21,565 --> 02:11:23,061
Please.

1776
02:11:23,463 --> 02:11:24,768
Good advice, young lady.

1777
02:11:24,793 --> 02:11:26,454
Listen... uh... Elphaba...

1778
02:11:26,489 --> 02:11:31,271
...if you can pull this off
first crack out of the box...

1779
02:11:31,522 --> 02:11:35,140
Oh. Oh, my golly.
I can't even imagine...

1780
02:11:35,175 --> 02:11:38,589
And I meant every word
about you having a home here.

1781
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:41,295
It's gonna be you and me...

1782
02:11:41,354 --> 02:11:44,188
...and, hey, if it'd make you happy...

1783
02:11:44,243 --> 02:11:47,667
...possibly your friend.

1784
02:11:47,702 --> 02:11:48,850
Really?

1785
02:11:49,860 --> 02:11:51,415
Why not?

1786
02:11:52,841 --> 02:11:54,591
No.

1787
02:11:56,486 --> 02:11:57,981
Elphaba.

1788
02:11:58,454 --> 02:12:01,637
You want to do yourself some good?
Get her back.

1789
02:12:04,409 --> 02:12:06,840
Elphie. Elphie.

1790
02:12:13,446 --> 02:12:14,890
Listen.

1791
02:12:19,390 --> 02:12:20,980
Listen.

1792
02:12:21,933 --> 02:12:24,885
If you want to keep your families safe...

1793
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:27,976
...you'll stay loyal to our Wizard.

1794
02:12:28,348 --> 02:12:31,324
She did this.
The green one.

1795
02:12:31,359 --> 02:12:33,727
Don't let her get away.

1797
02:13:20,704 --> 02:13:22,338
Elphie, where are you going?

1798
02:13:22,373 --> 02:13:24,054
Elphie, what are you doing?

1799
02:13:24,311 --> 02:13:26,303
Oh.
Oh, no.

1800
02:13:27,004 --> 02:13:29,523
Elphaba, please. Come back.
Let's just have a word with them.

1801
02:13:30,253 --> 02:13:31,749
Elphie. Elphie.

1802
02:13:31,865 --> 02:13:33,183
What are you doing?

1803
02:13:34,254 --> 02:13:35,022
Too much.

1804
02:13:39,147 --> 02:13:40,180
Take it.

1805
02:13:41,587 --> 02:13:43,878
Elphie. Oh. No...

1806
02:13:58,650 --> 02:14:03,112
Guards. Guards.
Guards.

1807
02:14:03,147 --> 02:14:07,377
There's a fugitive at large
here in the palace.

1808
02:14:07,412 --> 02:14:10,913
Bring her to me.

1809
02:14:16,186 --> 02:14:17,424
Let's go. Let's go.

1810
02:14:18,098 --> 02:14:20,290
- Elphaba, what are you doing?
- Just follow me. Follow me.

1811
02:14:20,316 --> 02:14:22,858
Where? What?
Are you out of your mind?

1812
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:24,511
Goodness, Elphaba,
you're being ridiculous.

1813
02:14:24,543 --> 02:14:27,070
- Just come on.
- Where are you going?

1814
02:14:27,949 --> 02:14:29,534
Up.

1815
02:14:32,576 --> 02:14:35,021
- They're in here.
- There she is. The green one.

1816
02:14:36,119 --> 02:14:38,670
- Get in quickly.
- Absolutely rid...

1817
02:14:41,210 --> 02:14:42,492
Quick. Jump.

1818
02:14:42,608 --> 02:14:44,308
Jump?
Me, jump?

1819
02:14:45,136 --> 02:14:47,526
Quick. Jump, Glinda.
Jump now.

1820
02:14:48,425 --> 02:14:49,375
Slipping...

1821
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:51,355
Just grab my hand.
Come on.

1822
02:14:58,194 --> 02:15:00,578
Come on. Grab on.

1823
02:15:01,517 --> 02:15:02,724
Get off.

1824
02:15:03,387 --> 02:15:05,061
Give me my leg.

1825
02:15:05,715 --> 02:15:07,403
Give me my leg.

1826
02:15:10,003 --> 02:15:11,349
Everyone, wait.

1827
02:15:33,940 --> 02:15:35,159
- Move.
- Faster.

1828
02:15:35,164 --> 02:15:36,512
- Push.
- Help me with this.

1829
02:15:36,517 --> 02:15:38,259
Hey. No.

1830
02:15:43,963 --> 02:15:45,707
Oh, no, no.

1831
02:15:48,010 --> 02:15:49,506
Elphie, Elphie, Elphie.

1832
02:15:51,219 --> 02:15:52,736
Faster.
Look out.

1833
02:16:02,967 --> 02:16:04,527
Quick. Get off.

1834
02:16:04,695 --> 02:16:06,104
Ow, ow, ow.

1835
02:16:09,018 --> 02:16:10,206
Don't look back.

1836
02:16:10,384 --> 02:16:12,867
- Get out of the way. Move.
- Watch out.

1837
02:16:16,932 --> 02:16:19,781
This is not good.
This is not good. This is not good.

1838
02:16:19,967 --> 02:16:21,265
Elphie.

1839
02:16:21,270 --> 02:16:22,558
Elphie.

1840
02:16:22,972 --> 02:16:25,310
Calm down.
You have got to let him explain.

1841
02:16:25,345 --> 02:16:26,818
Over my dead body.

1842
02:16:27,297 --> 02:16:29,372
This is everything you've dreamed of.

1843
02:16:36,137 --> 02:16:39,242
Elphaba, this is so much
bigger than us.

1844
02:16:39,574 --> 02:16:41,558
Why can't you have stayed calm
for once...

1845
02:16:41,593 --> 02:16:43,469
...instead of flying off the handle?

1846
02:16:43,504 --> 02:16:44,647
I hope you're happy.

1847
02:16:44,918 --> 02:16:46,265
<i>I hope you're happy now...

1848
02:16:46,364 --> 02:16:49,359
<i>I hope you're happy how
you hurt your cause forever...

1849
02:16:49,384 --> 02:16:51,594
<i>I hope you think you're clever...

1850
02:16:51,629 --> 02:16:52,764
I hope you're happy.

1851
02:16:52,984 --> 02:16:54,526
<i>I hope you're happy too...

1852
02:16:54,561 --> 02:16:58,209
<i>I hope you're proud how you
would grovel in submission...

1853
02:16:58,244 --> 02:17:00,628
<i>To feed your own ambition...

1854
02:17:00,663 --> 02:17:05,119
<i>So though I can't imagine how...

1855
02:17:05,154 --> 02:17:07,925
<i>I hope you're happy...

1856
02:17:08,156 --> 02:17:12,787
<i>Right now...

1857
02:17:12,822 --> 02:17:14,969
<i>Citizens of Oz...

1858
02:17:15,316 --> 02:17:20,989
...there is an enemy who must be found
and captured.

1859
02:17:21,131 --> 02:17:24,293
<i>Believe nothing she says.

1860
02:17:24,785 --> 02:17:27,770
She has stolen our Grimmerie.

1861
02:17:28,151 --> 02:17:30,737
<i>She is evil...

1862
02:17:30,955 --> 02:17:36,406
<i>...responsible for the mutilation
of these poor, innocent monkeys.

1863
02:17:36,607 --> 02:17:37,774
Oh, no.

1864
02:17:38,236 --> 02:17:40,814
<i>Her green skin...

1865
02:17:41,277 --> 02:17:47,038
<i>...is but an outward manifestorium
of her twisted nature.

1866
02:17:48,419 --> 02:17:50,812
<i>This distortion...

1867
02:17:51,001 --> 02:17:53,814
<i>...this repulsion...

1868
02:17:54,030 --> 02:17:55,396
<i>...this...

1869
02:17:57,090 --> 02:17:59,995
<i>...Wicked Witch.

1870
02:18:16,210 --> 02:18:17,846
Don't be afraid.

1871
02:18:20,315 --> 02:18:21,818
I'm not afraid.

1872
02:18:24,158 --> 02:18:26,500
It's the Wizard
who should be afraid of me.

1873
02:18:29,756 --> 02:18:31,595
Elphie, listen to me.

1874
02:18:31,998 --> 02:18:34,874
Listen to me. Just...
Just say you're sorry.

1875
02:18:36,646 --> 02:18:41,077
<i>You can still be with the Wizard...

1876
02:18:41,112 --> 02:18:46,021
<i>What you've worked and waited for...

1877
02:18:46,056 --> 02:18:51,887
<i>You can have all you ever wanted...

1878
02:18:55,148 --> 02:18:56,764
I know.

1879
02:18:58,370 --> 02:19:01,222
<i>But I don't want it...

1880
02:19:02,547 --> 02:19:03,802
No.

1881
02:19:04,606 --> 02:19:08,759
<i>I can't want it...

1882
02:19:09,557 --> 02:19:19,814
<i>Anymore...

1883
02:19:21,686 --> 02:19:26,767
<i>Something has changed within me...

1884
02:19:28,274 --> 02:19:31,934
<i>Something is not the same...

1885
02:19:33,523 --> 02:19:38,753
<i>I'm through with playing by the rules...

1886
02:19:38,788 --> 02:19:42,889
<i>Of someone else's game...

1887
02:19:43,651 --> 02:19:47,200
<i>Too late for second-guessing...

1888
02:19:47,555 --> 02:19:52,680
<i>Too late to go back to sleep...

1889
02:19:52,715 --> 02:19:56,941
<i>It's time to trust my instincts...

1890
02:19:56,976 --> 02:20:00,092
<i>Close my eyes...

1891
02:20:03,169 --> 02:20:05,944
<i>And leap...

1892
02:20:05,949 --> 02:20:12,213
<i>It's time to try defying gravity...

1893
02:20:12,310 --> 02:20:18,014
<i>I think I'll try defying gravity...

1894
02:20:18,083 --> 02:20:21,523
<i>And you can't pull me down...

1895
02:20:21,558 --> 02:20:26,137
<i>Can't I make you understand
you're having delusions of grandeur?..

1896
02:20:26,142 --> 02:20:29,521
<i>I'm through accepting limits...

1897
02:20:29,931 --> 02:20:32,738
<i>'Cause someone says they're so...

1898
02:20:33,015 --> 02:20:35,677
<i>Some things I cannot change...

1899
02:20:35,732 --> 02:20:39,337
<i>But till I try, I'll never know...

1900
02:20:39,418 --> 02:20:42,387
<i>Too long I've been afraid of...

1901
02:20:42,392 --> 02:20:45,708
<i>Losing love I guess I've lost...

1902
02:20:45,948 --> 02:20:47,679
<i>Well, if that's love...

1903
02:20:47,714 --> 02:20:52,349
<i>It comes at much too high a cost...

1904
02:20:52,384 --> 02:20:58,618
<i>I'd sooner buy defying gravity...

1905
02:20:58,706 --> 02:21:04,581
<i>Kiss me goodbye,
I'm defying gravity...

1906
02:21:04,616 --> 02:21:09,415
<i>And you can't pull me down...

1907
02:21:09,420 --> 02:21:11,970
- They're up there.
- You two. Come down.

1908
02:21:14,947 --> 02:21:17,440
Elphie, what are you doing?

1909
02:21:17,615 --> 02:21:19,015
Elphaba, please.

1910
02:21:19,924 --> 02:21:21,604
Listen to me.
Stop.

1911
02:21:25,070 --> 02:21:27,992
Not that hideoteous
levitation spell. Elphaba, please.

1912
02:21:28,108 --> 02:21:30,795
You don't know what you're doing
with that. Please.

1913
02:21:30,875 --> 02:21:32,966
Stop. Stop.

1914
02:21:33,343 --> 02:21:34,685
Stop.

1915
02:21:40,747 --> 02:21:41,992
Well...

1916
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:46,300
...where are your wings?

1917
02:21:49,517 --> 02:21:52,159
Maybe you're not as powerful
as you think you are.

1918
02:22:06,511 --> 02:22:08,143
Sweet Oz.

1919
02:22:53,417 --> 02:22:54,217
Charge.

1920
02:22:54,839 --> 02:22:55,928
Heave.

1921
02:22:59,669 --> 02:23:00,886
Quickly.

1922
02:23:01,832 --> 02:23:04,118
- Get on.
- What?

1923
02:23:04,153 --> 02:23:05,436
Heave.

1924
02:23:05,528 --> 02:23:06,710
Heave.

1925
02:23:07,010 --> 02:23:08,446
Heave.

1926
02:23:08,896 --> 02:23:10,411
Come with me.

1927
02:23:10,781 --> 02:23:13,843
Think of what we could do together.

1928
02:23:16,826 --> 02:23:20,613
<i>Unlimited...

1929
02:23:20,648 --> 02:23:25,721
<i>Together we're unlimited...

1930
02:23:25,756 --> 02:23:30,564
<i>Together we'll be the greatest team
there's ever been...

1931
02:23:30,599 --> 02:23:32,324
<i>Glinda...

1932
02:23:32,347 --> 02:23:35,472
<i>Dreams the way we planned 'em...

1933
02:23:35,735 --> 02:23:38,946
<i>If we work in tandem...

1934
02:23:39,004 --> 02:23:43,537
<i>There's no fight we cannot win...

1935
02:23:43,750 --> 02:23:50,663
<i>Just you and I
defying gravity...

1936
02:23:50,828 --> 02:23:56,910
<i>With you and I defying gravity...

1937
02:23:56,915 --> 02:24:02,172
<i>They'll never bring us down...

1938
02:24:05,294 --> 02:24:06,880
Are you coming?

1939
02:24:20,811 --> 02:24:22,542
Elphie, you're trembling.

1940
02:24:43,992 --> 02:24:45,362
Here.

1941
02:24:46,585 --> 02:24:48,232
Put this around you.

1942
02:25:49,688 --> 02:25:52,063
<i>I hope you're happy...

1943
02:25:53,242 --> 02:25:56,253
<i>Now that you're choosing this...

1944
02:25:56,290 --> 02:25:57,636
You too.

1945
02:25:58,190 --> 02:26:01,233
<i>I hope it brings you bliss...

1946
02:26:01,332 --> 02:26:03,217
<i>I really hope you get it...

1947
02:26:03,252 --> 02:26:06,475
<i>And you don't live to regret it...

1948
02:26:06,729 --> 02:26:13,413
<i>I hope you're happy in the end...

1949
02:26:13,437 --> 02:26:16,728
<i>I hope you're happy...

1950
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:22,506
<i>My friend...

1951
02:26:24,472 --> 02:26:25,844
Move.

1952
02:26:25,879 --> 02:26:27,074
- There they are.
- Get them.

1953
02:26:30,728 --> 02:26:31,462
Get her.

1954
02:26:31,525 --> 02:26:33,211
No.
Leave her alone.

1955
02:26:33,246 --> 02:26:35,443
- She hasn't done anything wrong.
- Get away from me.

1956
02:26:35,498 --> 02:26:36,434
- No.
- Catch them now.

1957
02:26:36,672 --> 02:26:37,848
Elphie.

1958
02:26:40,250 --> 02:26:42,719
No. Back off.
Back off.

1959
02:26:42,754 --> 02:26:43,941
- Elphie. Elphie, stop, no.
- I'm the one you want.

1960
02:26:44,299 --> 02:26:46,610
- I'm the one you want. It's me.
- No.

1961
02:26:47,613 --> 02:26:49,538
It's me.

1962
02:26:59,710 --> 02:27:02,476
<i>- What have you done this time?
- Elphaba Thropp, green on top.

1963
02:27:02,481 --> 02:27:04,909
<i>Someone run and tell her
that everyone can smell her.

1964
02:27:04,914 --> 02:27:07,781
<i>Just stop jabbering.
Just do what I say.

1965
02:27:09,191 --> 02:27:11,593
<i>Think of your future, dearie.

1966
02:27:11,861 --> 02:27:13,513
<i>Take it away.

1967
02:27:47,064 --> 02:27:51,453
<i>It's me.

1968
02:27:51,488 --> 02:27:54,617
<i>So if you care to find me...

1969
02:27:54,622 --> 02:27:57,295
<i>Look to the western sky...

1970
02:27:57,557 --> 02:28:00,311
<i>As someone told me lately:..

1971
02:28:00,482 --> 02:28:05,783
<i>"Ev'ryone deserves the chance to fly..."

1972
02:28:05,818 --> 02:28:08,578
<i>And if I'm flying solo...

1973
02:28:08,613 --> 02:28:11,796
<i>At least I'm flying free...

1974
02:28:11,845 --> 02:28:13,904
<i>To those who'd ground me...

1975
02:28:14,069 --> 02:28:18,237
<i>Take a message back from me...

1976
02:28:18,272 --> 02:28:24,521
<i>Tell them how I am
defying gravity...

1977
02:28:24,770 --> 02:28:30,252
<i>I'm flying high,
defying gravity...

1978
02:28:30,287 --> 02:28:36,750
<i>And soon,
I'll match them in renown...

1979
02:28:47,107 --> 02:28:52,794
<i>Unlimited...

1980
02:28:53,061 --> 02:28:54,928
<i>Citizens of Oz...

1981
02:28:55,455 --> 02:29:01,120
<i>...there is an enemy
who must be found and captured.

1982
02:29:02,991 --> 02:29:05,636
<i>Believe nothing she says.

1983
02:29:05,671 --> 02:29:08,382
<i>She has stolen our Grimmerie.

1984
02:29:08,431 --> 02:29:11,434
- Governor?
<i>- She is evil.

1985
02:29:11,921 --> 02:29:18,599
<i>Unlimited...

1986
02:29:20,195 --> 02:29:22,728
<i>Her green skin...

1987
02:29:23,101 --> 02:29:28,932
<i>...is but an outward manifestorium
of her twisted nature.

1988
02:29:30,011 --> 02:29:32,064
<i>This distortion...

1989
02:29:32,461 --> 02:29:35,207
<i>...this repulsion...

1990
02:29:35,505 --> 02:29:36,412
<i>- ...this...</i>
- Come on.

1991
02:29:36,417 --> 02:29:43,286
<i>- Unlimited...
- ...Wicked Witch.

1992
02:29:43,324 --> 02:29:45,821
<i>And...

1993
02:29:45,826 --> 02:29:48,897
...nobody in all of Oz...

1994
02:29:49,418 --> 02:29:53,385
<i>No Wizard
that there is or was...

1995
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:57,839
<i>Is ever gonna bring...

1996
02:29:58,226 --> 02:30:00,662
<i>Me down...

1997
02:30:00,667 --> 02:30:06,140
<i>- I hope you're happy...
- Look at her, she's Wicked, kill her...

1998
02:30:06,293 --> 02:30:09,324
<i>- Bring me down...
- No one mourns the Wicked...

1999
02:30:09,329 --> 02:30:15,986
<i>- Bring me down...
- So we've got to bring her...

2000
02:30:22,691 --> 02:30:30,417
<i>Down...

2001
02:30:36,763 --> 02:30:47,655
<i>Down...
