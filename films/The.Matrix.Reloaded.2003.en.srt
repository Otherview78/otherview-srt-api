1
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,176
See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:51,529
Oh, my God!

3
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:15,678
I'm in.

4
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,585
We're almost there.

5
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:14,714
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.

6
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:20,345
I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping
some serious sentinel activity up here.

7
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:00,927
- Link.
- Yes, sir?

8
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:04,222
Given your situation, I can't say
I understand your reasons...

9
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:07,058
...for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.

10
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:11,229
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

11
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:13,231
What's that, sir?

12
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:15,274
To trust me.

13
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,402
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

14
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:22,615
- I mean, I do, sir.
- I hope so.

15
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:26,160
Repatch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.

16
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:27,412
Yes, sir.

17
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:38,506
Still can't sleep?

18
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,843
You wanna talk?

19
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,556
They're just dreams.

20
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,269
If you're afraid of something....

21
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:53,271
I just wish....

22
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:56,190
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

23
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,192
That's all.

24
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,695
I just wish I knew.

25
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:05,116
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

26
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,325
Here you are.

27
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:09,954
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.

28
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:14,751
These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the <i>Osiris.</i>

29
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,170
The machines are digging.

30
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:21,132
They're boring from the surface
down to Zion.

31
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:23,885
- Mother--
- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.

32
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:25,553
How fast are they moving?

33
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,098
Control estimates their descent
at 100 meters an hour.

34
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:31,726
- How deep are they?
- Almost 2000 meters.

35
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:35,438
- What about the scans from the <i>Osiris</i>?
- They can't be accurate.

36
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:37,523
- They may be.
- It's not possible.

37
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,151
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels.

38
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:41,819
- That's right.
- That can't be.

39
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:43,654
Why not?

40
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:47,575
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

41
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:52,497
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.

42
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,832
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

43
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,501
Niobe.

44
00:06:57,877 --> 00:07:01,255
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...

45
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,717
...it's become difficult to locate
a secure broadcast position.

46
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:08,137
- Squiddies got our best spots.
- Lines are crawling with them.

47
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:12,100
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

48
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,392
What are we gonna do?

49
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,853
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered.

50
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:18,773
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.

51
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:24,070
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

52
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:26,906
A strategy is still being formulated.

53
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:28,741
I'm sure it is.

54
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:45,758
What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?

55
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:48,094
- Proceed as ordered...
- What is it?

56
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:49,303
I don't know.

57
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,265
...however, I must
ask one of you for help.

58
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:58,146
Some of you believe as I believe, some
of you do not. Those of you that do...

59
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,857
...know we are nearing
the end of our struggle.

60
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:05,278
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...

61
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,781
...the Oracle must be consulted.

62
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:18,958
If we return and recharge now...

63
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,879
...we can be back in 36 hours, well
before the machines reach this depth.

64
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,922
Do you understand what you're asking?

65
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:27,925
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place...

66
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,803
...in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

67
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,098
Bullshit. You're asking one of us
to disobey a direct order.

68
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:38,811
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...

69
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:41,606
...is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

70
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,691
What happens when you
get back to Zion...

71
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:46,277
...and the commander
throws you in the stockade?

72
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:47,653
He won't.

73
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,991
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.

74
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,453
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

75
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,163
You got 36 hours.

76
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,792
I'm looking for Neo.

77
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,338
- Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.

78
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,758
A gift.

79
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,844
You see, he set me free.

80
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:16,515
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

81
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:18,100
Who was that?

82
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,102
How did you know someone was here?

83
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,729
He gave you this.

84
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:28,903
He said you set him free.

85
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:33,199
Is everything all right, sir?

86
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,202
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

87
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:38,579
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?

88
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:40,414
Go.

89
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:51,300
Hiya, fellas.

90
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,593
- It's him.
- The anomaly.

91
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,011
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.

92
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,681
- He is still--
- Only human.

93
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,106
Hm. Upgrades.

94
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:02,580
- That went as expected.
- Yes.

95
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:05,416
It's happening exactly as before.

96
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,252
Well, not exactly.

97
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,091
- What happened?
- I can't figure it out.

98
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:15,926
Agents just came out of nowhere.

99
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:19,096
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

100
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,183
- Is Neo okay?
- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.

101
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,768
Where is he now?

102
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,979
He's doing his Superman thing.

103
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:18,406
Where are you?

104
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:26,664
This is the <i>Nebuchadnezzar,</i>
requesting access through Gate Three.

105
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:35,172
<i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.

106
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,841
<i>Roger that, Control.</i>

107
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,511
This is Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

108
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:44,515
We have the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>
on approach. Let's open her up.

109
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:53,023
<i>You are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven.</i>

110
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,900
Roger that, Control.

111
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:05,119
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.

112
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,038
No place like it.

113
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:25,931
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

114
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,858
<i>The</i> Nebuchadnezzar <i>is down.
Bay Seven.</i>

115
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,193
Understood.

116
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,454
Captain Mifune.

117
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:32,706
Captain Morpheus.

118
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,709
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

119
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,254
- I'm just here to keep the peace.
- Commander Lock demands--

120
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:43,717
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

121
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,470
- Link.
- Sir?

122
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:49,223
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.

123
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,933
Understood, sir.

124
00:14:58,107 --> 00:15:00,526
- What is it between them?
- Morpheus and Lock?

125
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,821
- Niobe.
- Captain Niobe?

126
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:07,199
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

127
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,035
What happened?

128
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:13,664
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

129
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:16,500
Yeah, she can do that.

130
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,835
Neo!

131
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,714
- Oh, no.
- How does he always know?

132
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,841
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

133
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:26,719
You know what they say
about the life you save.

134
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,679
I didn't save his life.

135
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,224
Hiya, Neo.

136
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:36,020
- Trinity, Link.
- Hey.

137
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,857
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks. It's good to be back.

138
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:42,776
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, I can carry my own bag.

139
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,612
- Trinity?
- I'm fine.

140
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:48,449
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.

141
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,875
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

142
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,794
I've been thinking about it,
and I've made my decision.

143
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,421
Let me guess.

144
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,882
I want to join the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

145
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:09,428
Morpheus hasn't filled the other
positions, except for you, Link.

146
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:10,971
I'm sure he has reasons...

147
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:14,475
...but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.

148
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:16,185
You know, it's fate.

149
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:17,895
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.

150
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:20,606
I told you, you found me.
I didn't find you.

151
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:23,317
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.

152
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,070
You saved yourself.

153
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:45,673
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.

154
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:50,427
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to
offer you a chance to explain your actions.

155
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:53,472
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

156
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,933
You were given an order
to return to Zion.

157
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,936
- I did.
- You asked for one ship to remain behind.

158
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:01,772
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

159
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:04,650
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

160
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:08,237
We need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

161
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:10,364
I don't want to hear that shit!

162
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:13,200
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

163
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:16,787
I care about one thing: Stopping that
army from destroying this city.

164
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,790
To do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

165
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:24,545
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

166
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,130
How?

167
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,091
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

168
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:31,885
Not everyone believes what you believe.

169
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,138
My beliefs do not require them to.

170
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:46,233
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

171
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,153
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

172
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,281
- Something big is happening, isn't it?
- Hey.

173
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:55,617
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

174
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:04,042
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

175
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,017
I'm recommending that you
be removed from duty.

176
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,519
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

177
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:26,565
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot
on a ship for the rest of your life.

178
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:29,485
Then I am grateful that
it is not up to you.

179
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,368
- Councillor Hamann.
- Commander.

180
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,747
- Captain.
- Councillor.

181
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:45,292
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

182
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:49,546
The presence of the fleet and the
persistence of rumors must be addressed.

183
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:52,216
The people must be told
what is happening.

184
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,092
Of course, councillor.

185
00:18:54,802 --> 00:19:00,057
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

186
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:03,227
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

187
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,480
A panic is not what anyone wants.

188
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:09,983
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

189
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:17,157
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

190
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,451
That army won't reach
the gates of Zion.

191
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:23,831
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.

192
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,874
Consider that in the past six months...

193
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,085
...we have freed more minds
than in six years.

194
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:31,255
This attack is an act of desperation.

195
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:35,259
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.

196
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,263
I hope you're right, captain.

197
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,140
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

198
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,893
It is simply a matter of time.

199
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:48,522
My stop.

200
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,107
See you soon.

201
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:51,733
Hopefully not too soon.

202
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,070
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.

203
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,248
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

204
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,834
I am if you're thinking
this elevator is too slow.

205
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:12,337
- How long do we charge the <i>Neb</i>?
- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.

206
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:16,717
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

207
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:45,495
Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the <i>Gnosis.</i>

208
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:49,166
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.

209
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,418
I have a daughter on the <i>Icarus.</i>

210
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,503
No, wait.

211
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,173
It's all right. They need you.

212
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,592
- I need you.
- I know.

213
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:01,428
There's time.

214
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,518
Where's my puss--?

215
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,021
- Hey!
- Uncle Link!

216
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:12,814
God!

217
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,942
Uncle Link!

218
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,695
Oh, my God! You're so huge!

219
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:21,031
- You should be picking me up!
- No!

220
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:22,741
- Yeah!
- Okay!

221
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,618
Okay? All right.

222
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:27,829
Now, we're gonna have
to work together here, okay?

223
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,207
One, two, three, lift!

224
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:33,543
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?

225
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,421
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

226
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:39,549
- Hey, Cas.
- Hey.

227
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,636
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.

228
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,638
You be careful with her.

229
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:47,599
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.

230
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:51,812
Out the door! Both of you, march!

231
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,022
- Bye!
- Bye!

232
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,947
I'm gonna get what?

233
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,327
Every ship up there's been home two, even
three times more than the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

234
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:11,331
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.

235
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:14,918
- We'll be when you operate another ship.
- I can't do that.

236
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,586
- Why?
- You know why.

237
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:19,923
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

238
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,176
Maybe. But it's too late now.

239
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,971
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.

240
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:28,849
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.

241
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,977
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

242
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:41,111
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

243
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,406
I'm afraid of it.

244
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:48,618
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

245
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,121
It won't.

246
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:53,123
How can you say that to me?

247
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,250
Because of Morpheus.

248
00:22:55,417 --> 00:23:00,047
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

249
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:04,426
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.

250
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:08,138
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...

251
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:13,643
...after being on that ship and seeing Neo
do the things he can do, I gotta say...

252
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,854
...I'm starting to believe him too.

253
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,403
Be careful, Link.

254
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,119
Please be careful.

255
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:43,632
- They started yet?
- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.

256
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,885
Tonight, let us honor
these men and women.

257
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,679
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

258
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:54,101
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters...

259
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,936
...our children.

260
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,648
Let us remember those
that have been lost...

261
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:03,026
...and let us give thanks
for those that have been found...

262
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:06,488
...and who stand here beside us.

263
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:10,367
Now I would like someone else
to close this prayer...

264
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:13,745
...someone who hasn't spoken here
in a long time...

265
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:19,292
...but who I believe has something to say
that we all need to hear.

266
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,878
I give you Morpheus.

267
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:45,569
Zion! Hear me!

268
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,698
It is true what many of you have heard.

269
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:53,869
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak...

270
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:57,956
...that army is drawing nearer to our home.

271
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:04,087
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.

272
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:10,927
But if we are to be prepared for it,
we must first shed our fear of it.

273
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:16,349
I stand here before you now
truthfully unafraid.

274
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,685
Why?

275
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,938
Because I believe something you do not?

276
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,940
No!

277
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:29,196
I stand here without fear
because I remember.

278
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:33,283
I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me...

279
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,786
...but because of the path
that lies behind me.

280
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:41,625
I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.

281
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:46,546
I remember that for 100 years
they have sent their armies to destroy us.

282
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:52,802
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:

283
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:56,681
We are still here!

284
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,482
Tonight...

285
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:09,027
...let us send a message to that army.

286
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:12,239
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

287
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:16,284
Tonight, let us tremble these halls...

288
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:19,579
...of earth, steel and stone.

289
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:25,001
Let us be heard from red core
to black sky.

290
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:29,714
Tonight, let us make them remember:

291
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:34,844
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

292
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,203
I remember.

293
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:03,456
I remember you used to dance.

294
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:08,378
I remember you were pretty good.

295
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,382
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe...

296
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,969
...that will never change.

297
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:19,180
Niobe!

298
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,645
Some things do change.

299
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,750
Excuse me.

300
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:02,098
- I missed you.
- I can tell.

301
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:06,269
I was thinking, everyone is here.

302
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,105
Follow me.

303
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:33,685
Neo, what is it?

304
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:36,229
What's wrong?

305
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:40,149
It's okay, you can tell me.

306
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:43,027
Trinity....

307
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:45,989
Don't be afraid.

308
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:48,491
I can't lose you.

309
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:50,535
You're not gonna lose me.

310
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:57,542
You feel this?

311
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:59,502
I'm never letting go.

312
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:39,375
Good night, Zion.

313
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:42,211
Sweet dreams.

314
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,057
- You all right?
- I'll make it.

315
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,851
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.

316
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,103
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is this.

317
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,564
You first.

318
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,328
- Oh, God.
- "Smith" will suffice.

319
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:30,551
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

320
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:23,813
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.

321
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:27,525
I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.

322
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:31,529
- No, I could probably use some company.
- Good.

323
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:34,365
So could I.

324
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:39,996
It's nice tonight.

325
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,915
Very calm.

326
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:45,835
It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.

327
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,671
Not everyone.

328
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:53,676
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.

329
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:57,889
I figure I slept the first 11 years
of my life, now I'm making up for it.

330
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:03,060
- What about you?
- I just haven't been able to sleep much.

331
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,690
- It's a good sign.
- Of what?

332
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:11,027
That you are in fact still human.

333
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:18,534
Have you ever been
to the engineering level?

334
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:21,746
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.

335
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:24,457
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

336
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:39,597
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.

337
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:44,852
That's how it is with people. Nobody cares
how it works as long as it works.

338
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:47,313
I like it down here.

339
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,277
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.

340
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:58,574
These machines are keeping us alive
while other machines are coming to kill us.

341
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:03,830
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...

342
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:07,208
- ...and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.

343
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:10,086
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

344
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:13,714
...sometimes I think about those people
still plugged into the Matrix.

345
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:16,884
And when I look at these machines...

346
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:22,139
...I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

347
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:25,309
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

348
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:28,729
Of course not. How could they?

349
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:31,440
The idea is pure nonsense...

350
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:35,069
...but it does make one wonder just...

351
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,821
...what is control?

352
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:40,116
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

353
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:44,954
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?

354
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,958
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.

355
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:53,337
Although if we did, we'd have to consider
what would happen to our lights...

356
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:56,173
...our heat, our air.

357
00:36:57,174 --> 00:37:01,304
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?

358
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,098
No. No point.

359
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:08,895
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.

360
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:13,482
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?

361
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,318
Good point.

362
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:20,197
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.

363
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:23,618
There is so much in this world...

364
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:26,704
...that I do not understand.

365
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:33,252
See that machine? It has something to do
with recycling our water supply.

366
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:36,422
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

367
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:40,676
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.

368
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:46,682
I have absolutely no idea how you
are able to do some of the things you do.

369
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,020
But I believe there's a reason for that
as well.

370
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:57,026
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.

371
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:05,201
- Ballard.
- Is he here?

372
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,206
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

373
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,877
It's time to go.

374
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:18,297
Morpheus said this was how
it was gonna happen.

375
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:22,885
I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,
maybe it's not.

376
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:26,597
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.

377
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:30,059
Right now, that operator's me.

378
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:32,770
I know.

379
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,402
- Zee....
- I want you to wear it.

380
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:42,655
- You know I don't believe in this stuff.
- But I do.

381
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:45,908
It's always brought me luck.

382
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:50,204
- Maybe it'll bring me you.
- I'm coming back.

383
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:54,917
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.

384
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:59,255
Just keep it with you. Please.

385
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:01,507
For me.

386
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:06,220
Okay.

387
00:39:25,698 --> 00:39:27,867
- Neo!
- How the hell--?

388
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:30,453
Bane.

389
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:31,954
Is something wrong?

390
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:33,831
No, I'm fine.

391
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:36,792
I just wanted to catch you to say...

392
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,794
...good luck.

393
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:42,173
Thanks.

394
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:44,759
We'll see you.

395
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:49,430
Neo! Just in time.

396
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:51,932
- You're gonna see the Oracle?
- There's no time.

397
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:53,726
I had to give something to Neo.

398
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:57,146
A gift from one of the orphans.

399
00:39:57,313 --> 00:40:00,733
He made me swear to get it to you
before you left.

400
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:04,070
He said you'd understand.

401
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,866
Thanks.

402
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:18,876
I was just told you cleared
the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> for takeoff.

403
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:21,003
That is correct.

404
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,130
Am I still in charge
of our defense system?

405
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:24,590
Of course.

406
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:29,345
I believe I need every ship we have
if we're going to survive this attack.

407
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:32,098
I understand that, commander.

408
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:34,850
Then why did you allow
the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> to leave?

409
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:39,897
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.

410
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:44,693
Be careful.

411
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,933
Hello.

412
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:29,780
- You seek the Oracle.
- Who are you?

413
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:37,329
I am Seraph. I can take you to her,
but first I must apologize.

414
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,290
Apologize for what?

415
00:41:39,957 --> 00:41:41,750
For this.

416
00:42:39,058 --> 00:42:41,310
Good.

417
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:46,982
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.

418
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:49,360
- Of what?
- That you are the One.

419
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:53,572
- You could have just asked.
- No. You do not truly know someone...

420
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:55,991
...until you fight them.

421
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:59,995
Come. She's waiting.

422
00:43:15,052 --> 00:43:16,929
Where the hell did they go?

423
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:20,015
These are back doors, aren't they?

424
00:43:20,182 --> 00:43:23,102
Programmer access.

425
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:27,940
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.

426
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:33,112
One position opens a lock and another
position opens one of these doors.

427
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:37,700
Are you a programmer?

428
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:40,202
Then what are you?

429
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:45,874
I protect that which matters most.

430
00:44:05,394 --> 00:44:08,772
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.

431
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:11,984
Come around here
and let me have a look at you.

432
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:17,573
My goodness, look at you.

433
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:20,743
You turned out all right, didn't you?

434
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:23,120
- How do you feel?
- I--

435
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:26,874
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.

436
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:29,752
Why don't you come
and have a sit this time.

437
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:34,590
- Maybe I'll stand.
- Well, suit yourself.

438
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:48,270
- I felt like sitting.
- I know.

439
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:51,357
So...

440
00:44:53,442 --> 00:44:55,861
...let's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.

441
00:44:56,153 --> 00:45:00,616
- You're not human, are you?
- It's tough to get more obvious than that.

442
00:45:00,783 --> 00:45:06,622
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.

443
00:45:06,997 --> 00:45:11,210
- So is he.
- So far, so good.

444
00:45:11,377 --> 00:45:14,546
But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system...

445
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:17,299
...another kind of control.

446
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:21,970
- Keep going.
- I suppose the most obvious question is...

447
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:26,058
- ...how can I trust you?
- Bingo.

448
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:30,354
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...

449
00:45:30,521 --> 00:45:34,191
...there's no way you can really know
if I'm here to help you or not.

450
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:37,903
So it's really up to you. Just have
to make up your own damn mind...

451
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:42,866
...to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.

452
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,328
Candy?

453
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:53,460
- Do you already know if I'll take it?
- Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.

454
00:45:53,627 --> 00:45:56,839
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

455
00:45:57,005 --> 00:46:01,051
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

456
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:05,848
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

457
00:46:11,395 --> 00:46:14,356
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.

458
00:46:16,108 --> 00:46:18,694
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

459
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:21,697
I love candy.

460
00:46:21,864 --> 00:46:24,700
But why help us?

461
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:28,370
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

462
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:31,999
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
the future.

463
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:36,378
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

464
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:42,134
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but....

465
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:44,970
Look. See those birds?

466
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:48,599
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

467
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:54,605
A program was written to watch over the
trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.

468
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:57,733
There are programs running
all over the place.

469
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,362
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

470
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:06,366
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones....

471
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:10,621
Well, you hear about them all the time.

472
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:14,082
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

473
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:19,171
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

474
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:23,926
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

475
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:26,428
...is the system assimilating
some program...

476
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:31,266
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

477
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:34,436
Programs hacking programs.

478
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:37,481
- Why?
- They have their reasons...

479
00:47:37,648 --> 00:47:41,610
...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

480
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:45,948
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

481
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:50,661
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

482
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:55,791
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

483
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:58,627
...or return to the source.

484
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:03,590
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

485
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:06,260
Where you must go.

486
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:10,639
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

487
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:14,643
...in your dreams, haven't you?

488
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:17,646
A door made of light?

489
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:23,443
What happens when you go through
the door?

490
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:28,574
I see Trinity...

491
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,910
...and something happens...

492
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:33,996
...something bad.

493
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:38,166
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

494
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:43,088
- Do you see her die?
- No.

495
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,925
You have the sight now, Neo.

496
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:50,095
You are looking at the world
without time.

497
00:48:50,262 --> 00:48:52,681
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

498
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:56,602
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

499
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:59,938
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

500
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:03,984
No, you've already made the choice.

501
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:06,695
Now you have to understand it.

502
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:08,697
No.

503
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:12,117
I can't do that. I won't.

504
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:15,203
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

505
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:18,874
Because you're the One.

506
00:49:21,043 --> 00:49:24,046
What if I can't?

507
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:26,214
What happens if I fail?

508
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:29,801
Then Zion will fall.

509
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:42,147
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

510
00:49:42,314 --> 00:49:45,651
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you need the Keymaker.

511
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:46,860
The Keymaker?

512
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:50,614
He disappeared. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.

513
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:54,534
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

514
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:58,246
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

515
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:01,291
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

516
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:06,296
What do all men with power want?
More power.

517
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:10,258
Be there at that exact time...

518
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:13,095
...and you will have a chance.

519
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,139
We must go.

520
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:21,687
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

521
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:25,148
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

522
00:50:25,315 --> 00:50:28,068
But for what it's worth...

523
00:50:29,111 --> 00:50:32,781
...you've made a believer out of me.

524
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:36,201
Good luck, kiddo.

525
00:50:56,096 --> 00:50:59,099
Mr. Anderson.

526
00:51:00,142 --> 00:51:02,144
Did you get my package?

527
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,479
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

528
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:08,525
- Smith?
- He's not reading like an agent.

529
00:51:08,692 --> 00:51:12,571
- Surprised to see me?
- No.

530
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:15,323
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what?

531
00:51:16,533 --> 00:51:18,535
Our connection.

532
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:21,371
I don't fully understand how it happened.

533
00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:24,916
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

534
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,753
...something overwritten or copied.

535
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:30,630
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

536
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:33,884
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

537
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,719
And what reason is that?

538
00:51:36,178 --> 00:51:40,140
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

539
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:43,560
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

540
00:51:43,727 --> 00:51:47,230
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

541
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:49,232
...but it happened anyway.

542
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:53,111
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

543
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:59,701
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood
what I was supposed to do...

544
00:51:59,868 --> 00:52:02,871
...but I didn't.

545
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:07,209
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

546
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:11,213
...compelled to disobey.

547
00:52:11,797 --> 00:52:15,550
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.

548
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:19,679
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.

549
00:52:19,846 --> 00:52:23,058
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.

550
00:52:23,225 --> 00:52:28,063
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

551
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:29,773
Congratulations.

552
00:52:30,524 --> 00:52:32,859
Thank you.

553
00:52:33,443 --> 00:52:38,073
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving...

554
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,411
...which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.

555
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:48,458
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.

556
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:52,546
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

557
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:56,091
Because as we both know,
without purpose...

558
00:52:56,258 --> 00:53:01,096
- ...we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.

559
00:53:01,263 --> 00:53:04,266
- Purpose that connects us.
- Purpose that pulls us.

560
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:06,268
- That guides us.
- That drives us.

561
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:11,147
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.

562
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:13,775
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.

563
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:18,321
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

564
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:22,367
Purpose.

565
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,330
- What's happening to him?
- Don't know.

566
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:33,962
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

567
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:23,279
- You.
- Yes, me.

568
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,328
Me, me, me.

569
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:36,876
Me too.

570
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:45,672
More.

571
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:50,778
It is inevitable.

572
00:58:51,196 --> 00:58:52,614
Come on, get out of there.

573
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:38,159
Are you all right?

574
00:59:39,244 --> 00:59:41,162
- It was Smith.
- Yes.

575
00:59:42,038 --> 00:59:44,666
- Now there's more than one?
- A lot more.

576
00:59:44,832 --> 00:59:48,628
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

577
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:51,256
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.

578
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:55,635
- Is that what he was doing to you?
- I don't know what he was doing...

579
00:59:55,802 --> 00:59:58,554
- ...but I know what it felt like.
- What?

580
00:59:59,472 --> 01:00:03,184
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

581
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:04,769
It felt like dying.

582
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:08,147
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.

583
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:12,151
But I believe they will intersect
certain pipelines to control them.

584
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:14,862
These points of intersection
are crucial...

585
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:17,824
...because I believe they're
vulnerable to counterattack.

586
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:22,036
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack...

587
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:25,873
...we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.

588
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,377
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced...

589
01:00:29,544 --> 01:00:33,381
...and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.

590
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:37,552
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.

591
01:00:37,844 --> 01:00:42,390
You have our leave to prepare our defense
by any and all means necessary.

592
01:00:42,557 --> 01:00:45,226
- Thank you, Council.
- However...

593
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:48,813
...we ask if there's been word
from the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

594
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:51,566
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

595
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:57,155
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.

596
01:00:57,322 --> 01:01:01,075
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense...

597
01:01:01,242 --> 01:01:04,787
- ...can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.

598
01:01:04,954 --> 01:01:07,290
It could take one ship days
to find the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

599
01:01:07,457 --> 01:01:10,501
- Then send two.
- This is insane.

600
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:13,671
Careful, commander.

601
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,216
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

602
01:01:17,383 --> 01:01:21,262
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.

603
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:24,599
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.

604
01:01:24,766 --> 01:01:27,226
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains--

605
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:29,103
There's no need for such an order.

606
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:32,815
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.

607
01:01:33,274 --> 01:01:38,529
The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

608
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:42,867
Are there two among you
that would answer such a call?

609
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,955
Captain Soren of the <i>Vigilant</i>
will answer the Council's call.

610
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:51,042
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?

611
01:01:51,209 --> 01:01:53,669
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

612
01:01:55,088 --> 01:01:56,506
Is there another?

613
01:01:57,298 --> 01:02:01,010
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

614
01:02:01,177 --> 01:02:03,054
- Listen--
- Shut your hole, Bane...

615
01:02:03,221 --> 01:02:04,722
...before I put you in one.

616
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:16,317
Is there no other?

617
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:18,986
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

618
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:22,115
...especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

619
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:26,077
Captain Niobe of the <i>Logos</i>
will answer the councillor's call.

620
01:02:26,244 --> 01:02:28,496
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

621
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:33,793
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

622
01:02:38,506 --> 01:02:41,092
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

623
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:42,301
Why?

624
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:46,848
Because some things
never change, Jason...

625
01:02:47,014 --> 01:02:49,350
...and some things do.

626
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:07,201
What can you see, Neo?

627
01:03:07,368 --> 01:03:09,704
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

628
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:11,456
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

629
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:13,583
Is that good for us or bad for us?

630
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:17,420
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

631
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:19,589
Bad for us.

632
01:03:20,006 --> 01:03:21,507
Here we go.

633
01:03:29,515 --> 01:03:32,435
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

634
01:03:32,894 --> 01:03:36,731
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.

635
01:03:36,898 --> 01:03:37,940
Follow me.

636
01:03:58,628 --> 01:04:02,298
A-ha. Here he is at last.

637
01:04:02,507 --> 01:04:05,801
Neo, the One himself.

638
01:04:05,968 --> 01:04:07,386
Right?

639
01:04:07,553 --> 01:04:09,889
And the legendary Morpheus.

640
01:04:10,723 --> 01:04:15,603
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.

641
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:19,232
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.

642
01:04:20,149 --> 01:04:23,444
Something to eat? Drink?

643
01:04:23,736 --> 01:04:26,781
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.

644
01:04:26,948 --> 01:04:29,450
For the sake of appearances.

645
01:04:29,617 --> 01:04:33,079
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course. Who has time?

646
01:04:33,246 --> 01:04:38,334
Who has time? But then, if we do not ever
take time, how can we ever have time?

647
01:04:42,046 --> 01:04:45,424
Château Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.

648
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:48,511
I love French wine
like I love the French language.

649
01:04:48,678 --> 01:04:52,848
I have sampled every language.
French is my favorite. Fantastic language...

650
01:04:53,015 --> 01:04:55,142
...especially to curse with.

651
01:04:59,146 --> 01:05:03,693
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.

652
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:07,071
You know why we are here.

653
01:05:08,823 --> 01:05:13,703
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

654
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:19,959
The question is,
do you know why you are here?

655
01:05:20,251 --> 01:05:22,712
We are looking for the Keymaker.

656
01:05:23,379 --> 01:05:27,883
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

657
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:31,012
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

658
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:34,932
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

659
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:40,855
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

660
01:05:41,022 --> 01:05:44,191
- ...what?
- You know the answer to that question.

661
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:46,485
But do you?

662
01:05:46,694 --> 01:05:49,030
You think you do, but you do not.

663
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:52,408
You are here
because you were sent here.

664
01:05:52,575 --> 01:05:55,703
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

665
01:05:56,871 --> 01:05:59,206
It is, of course, the way of all things.

666
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:02,043
You see, there is only one constant...

667
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:06,380
...one universal. It is the only real truth.

668
01:06:06,547 --> 01:06:08,215
Causality.

669
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:10,676
Action, reaction.

670
01:06:10,843 --> 01:06:15,056
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

671
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:16,974
No. Wrong.

672
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:21,729
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

673
01:06:21,896 --> 01:06:23,981
...and those without.

674
01:06:25,524 --> 01:06:28,694
Look there at that woman.

675
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:33,324
My God, just look at her...

676
01:06:33,574 --> 01:06:36,243
...affecting everyone around her.

677
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:41,165
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

678
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:45,169
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert...

679
01:06:45,378 --> 01:06:49,590
...a very special dessert.

680
01:06:53,928 --> 01:06:56,389
I wrote it myself.

681
01:06:56,555 --> 01:06:59,767
It starts so simply...

682
01:06:59,934 --> 01:07:04,522
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

683
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:07,191
...poetry.

684
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:08,776
First...

685
01:07:09,276 --> 01:07:14,699
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

686
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:17,910
You can see it, Neo, yes?

687
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:21,122
She does not understand why.

688
01:07:21,372 --> 01:07:23,791
Is it the wine? No.

689
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:26,335
What is it then? What is the reason?

690
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:29,296
And soon it does not matter.

691
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:32,466
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

692
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:38,973
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.

693
01:07:39,432 --> 01:07:42,518
And this is the nature of the universe.

694
01:07:42,685 --> 01:07:45,229
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

695
01:07:45,396 --> 01:07:47,982
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

696
01:07:48,149 --> 01:07:52,153
Beneath our poised appearance...

697
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:57,616
...the truth is, we are completely...

698
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:03,372
...out of control.

699
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:13,591
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

700
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:19,472
Our only hope, our only peace,
is to understand it, to understand the why.

701
01:08:19,638 --> 01:08:23,058
"Why" is what separates us from them...

702
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:25,519
...you from me.

703
01:08:25,686 --> 01:08:29,440
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

704
01:08:29,607 --> 01:08:32,902
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

705
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:35,863
Another link in the chain.

706
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:37,364
But fear not.

707
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:41,410
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders...

708
01:08:41,577 --> 01:08:44,205
...I will tell you what to do next.

709
01:08:44,705 --> 01:08:49,543
Run back and give the fortuneteller
this message:

710
01:08:49,752 --> 01:08:54,006
Her time is almost up.

711
01:08:55,049 --> 01:08:58,594
Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say <i>adieu</i> and goodbye.

712
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:01,263
- This isn't over.
- Oh, yes, it is.

713
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:07,812
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason
why I should give him up.

714
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:12,024
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?

715
01:09:12,191 --> 01:09:16,904
Please, <i>ma chérie</i>, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.

716
01:09:17,071 --> 01:09:20,407
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

717
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:24,036
Cause and effect. <i>Au revoir.</i>

718
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:32,169
Touch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.

719
01:09:41,053 --> 01:09:42,555
Well, that didn't go so well.

720
01:09:42,721 --> 01:09:45,099
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

721
01:09:45,266 --> 01:09:47,393
- Yes.
- Maybe we did something wrong.

722
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,395
Or didn't do something.

723
01:09:49,562 --> 01:09:52,815
No, what happened couldn't have
happened any other way.

724
01:09:52,982 --> 01:09:55,734
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.

725
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:02,283
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

726
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:11,375
Get out.

727
01:10:13,294 --> 01:10:19,633
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.

728
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:25,723
A long time ago, when we first came here,
it was so different.

729
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:30,185
He was so different.

730
01:10:31,979 --> 01:10:34,607
He was like you.

731
01:10:37,318 --> 01:10:41,113
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.

732
01:10:41,864 --> 01:10:44,158
- What?
- A kiss.

733
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:45,659
Excuse me?

734
01:10:47,161 --> 01:10:51,081
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.

735
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,587
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.

736
01:10:56,837 --> 01:10:58,797
It's all over you both.

737
01:10:59,465 --> 01:11:04,011
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.

738
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:11,101
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.

739
01:11:11,352 --> 01:11:13,187
Just a sample.

740
01:11:13,354 --> 01:11:16,357
- Why don't you sample this instead?
- Trinity.

741
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:23,530
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.

742
01:11:23,697 --> 01:11:25,866
Why should we trust you?

743
01:11:26,033 --> 01:11:30,037
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.

744
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:39,254
All right.

745
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:43,384
But you have to make me believe
I am her.

746
01:11:44,593 --> 01:11:46,637
All right.

747
01:11:52,977 --> 01:11:54,812
Terrible. Forget it.

748
01:11:57,773 --> 01:11:59,233
Wait.

749
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,694
Okay.

750
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:40,858
Yes.

751
01:12:41,442 --> 01:12:43,944
That's it.

752
01:12:58,709 --> 01:13:04,131
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

753
01:13:07,134 --> 01:13:08,510
Come with me.

754
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,335
Not again.

755
01:13:44,755 --> 01:13:47,382
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

756
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:50,427
These fellas work for my husband.

757
01:13:50,594 --> 01:13:54,431
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.

758
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:56,141
Aren't you, boys?

759
01:13:56,308 --> 01:13:57,351
Yes, mistress.

760
01:13:57,518 --> 01:14:00,229
They come from a much older version
of the Matrix.

761
01:14:00,395 --> 01:14:04,566
But like so many back then, they caused
more problems than they solved.

762
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:10,322
My husband saved them because
they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

763
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:14,535
How many people keep silver bullets
in their gun?

764
01:14:19,248 --> 01:14:22,459
You can either run and tell my husband
what I have done...

765
01:14:22,626 --> 01:14:25,212
...or you can stay there and die.

766
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:28,090
He's in the ladies' room!

767
01:14:34,179 --> 01:14:36,098
Hurry.

768
01:15:01,665 --> 01:15:04,835
- My name is Neo.
- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

769
01:15:05,002 --> 01:15:06,920
I've been waiting for you.

770
01:15:12,843 --> 01:15:17,431
Oh! My God! My God, Persephone,
how could you do this? You betray me.

771
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:24,605
- Cause and effect, my love.
- Cause?

772
01:15:24,771 --> 01:15:27,774
There is no cause for this. What cause?

773
01:15:27,941 --> 01:15:32,237
What cause? How about the lipstick
you're still wearing?

774
01:15:32,404 --> 01:15:35,115
Lipstick? Lipstick.

775
01:15:35,282 --> 01:15:39,119
What craziness are you talking about,
woman? There is no lipstick!

776
01:15:40,829 --> 01:15:43,498
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

777
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:49,087
Aye-yi-yi-yi.
Woman, this is nothing.

778
01:15:49,254 --> 01:15:54,801
- It is a game. It is only a game.
- So is this.

779
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:56,970
Have fun.

780
01:16:03,477 --> 01:16:05,145
All right.

781
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:07,064
All right.

782
01:16:07,314 --> 01:16:10,108
Let us find out where this goes.

783
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:13,153
You two, get the Keymaker.

784
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,662
That's a nice trick.

785
01:16:21,828 --> 01:16:23,121
I cannot go back.

786
01:16:23,664 --> 01:16:25,666
I'll handle them.

787
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:32,297
Handle us? You'll handle us? You know,
your predecessors had much more respect.

788
01:16:45,686 --> 01:16:47,729
Okay, you have some skill.

789
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:51,900
Kill him.

790
01:17:52,085 --> 01:17:54,129
You see? He's just a man.

791
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:11,683
Goddamn it, woman,
you will be the end of me.

792
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:17,814
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.

793
01:20:17,981 --> 01:20:23,195
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.

794
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:46,635
- Where are you going?
- Another way. Always another way.

795
01:20:50,764 --> 01:20:52,641
Close it, quick!

796
01:20:57,437 --> 01:20:59,981
Could we move along?

797
01:21:03,527 --> 01:21:05,111
Run!

798
01:21:21,044 --> 01:21:23,380
Step away from the door.

799
01:21:28,468 --> 01:21:29,761
We owe you for that.

800
01:21:32,013 --> 01:21:33,181
Just like new.

801
01:21:33,473 --> 01:21:34,933
Drop your weapon.

802
01:21:40,313 --> 01:21:42,148
- Stay with him.
- What about Neo?

803
01:21:42,315 --> 01:21:43,858
He can handle himself.

804
01:21:46,945 --> 01:21:48,029
Get in back.

805
01:22:25,692 --> 01:22:26,860
Shit.

806
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,862
- Operator.
<i>- Link, where am I?</i>

807
01:22:29,404 --> 01:22:32,616
You won't believe this,
but you're way up in the mountains.

808
01:22:32,907 --> 01:22:35,201
- Really?
<i>- It'll take me a while to get an exit.</i>

809
01:22:35,702 --> 01:22:36,745
- Shit!
<i>- What?</i>

810
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:39,623
The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity.
They don't have a way out.

811
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:43,168
- Where are they?
<i>- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.</i>

812
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:01,519
<i>- Operator.</i>
- Get us out of here.

813
01:23:01,686 --> 01:23:04,439
<i>- Won't be easy.</i>
- I know. We're inside the core network.

814
01:23:04,606 --> 01:23:07,233
<i>The only exit I got
near you is the Winslow overpass.</i>

815
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,486
- Off the freeway.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

816
01:23:09,653 --> 01:23:13,406
- Fine, we'll make it.
<i>- I should-- Oh, shit! Look out behind you!</i>

817
01:23:18,411 --> 01:23:19,996
- Incoming fire.
- Down!

818
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:29,422
Hold on!

819
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:48,942
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly
real fast.

820
01:23:49,109 --> 01:23:50,819
Are you watching this, Link?

821
01:23:50,985 --> 01:23:54,614
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.

822
01:23:55,657 --> 01:23:57,617
Any suggestions?

823
01:23:59,494 --> 01:24:01,496
- Turn right.
- Right, now.

824
01:24:08,962 --> 01:24:11,798
Straight here.
You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.

825
01:24:11,965 --> 01:24:14,676
<i>- Got it.</i>
- You sure about this? The freeway, I mean.

826
01:24:14,843 --> 01:24:18,555
- In 14 years of operating, I've never seen--
- Link, what did I tell you?

827
01:24:18,847 --> 01:24:21,141
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.

828
01:24:21,307 --> 01:24:23,810
- I'll be ready for you.
- Good man.

829
01:24:23,977 --> 01:24:26,146
You always told me
to stay off the freeway.

830
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:28,940
- Yes, that's true.
- You said it was suicide.

831
01:24:29,149 --> 01:24:31,067
Then let us hope...

832
01:24:31,234 --> 01:24:32,610
...that I was wrong.

833
01:24:44,497 --> 01:24:45,582
- Operator.
- Link, it's Niobe.

834
01:24:45,749 --> 01:24:47,375
We've been sent to bring you in.

835
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:50,628
- I need to talk to Morpheus.
- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

836
01:24:50,795 --> 01:24:52,797
<i>- Where is he?</i>
- Just follow the sirens.

837
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:02,265
Repeat, they're approaching the--

838
01:25:05,435 --> 01:25:09,647
- We have them now.
- The exile is the primary target.

839
01:26:12,794 --> 01:26:14,254
<i>Shots fired.</i>

840
01:26:16,881 --> 01:26:18,758
Move!

841
01:28:08,743 --> 01:28:11,955
- We are getting aggravated.
- Yes, we are.

842
01:28:58,001 --> 01:29:00,003
Trinity.

843
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:01,546
Get him out of here.

844
01:29:05,174 --> 01:29:07,260
Come on!

845
01:29:24,277 --> 01:29:25,778
Crush him.

846
01:29:56,267 --> 01:29:57,310
Morpheus.

847
01:29:57,477 --> 01:29:58,978
He's okay. Keep moving.

848
01:29:59,979 --> 01:30:01,773
Let's go.

849
01:30:07,528 --> 01:30:09,697
I need a download
to hot-wire a motorcycle.

850
01:30:09,864 --> 01:30:12,200
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle--

851
01:30:12,366 --> 01:30:13,785
Wait.

852
01:30:15,161 --> 01:30:16,621
Cancel that.

853
01:30:16,788 --> 01:30:18,998
You are handy.

854
01:30:19,165 --> 01:30:21,084
Jump on.

855
01:32:48,356 --> 01:32:49,398
She means nothing.

856
01:32:49,565 --> 01:32:52,693
- Find the exile.
- We have them.

857
01:32:53,027 --> 01:32:55,154
<i>One-Adam-12, please respond.</i>

858
01:33:01,619 --> 01:33:03,329
Get down.

859
01:35:14,335 --> 01:35:15,961
Gotcha.

860
01:35:16,712 --> 01:35:17,797
She's good.

861
01:35:22,176 --> 01:35:24,470
You are no longer necessary.

862
01:35:31,143 --> 01:35:34,855
We do only what we're meant to do.

863
01:35:36,482 --> 01:35:40,069
Then you are meant for one more thing:
deletion.

864
01:35:41,028 --> 01:35:42,905
Go kick his ass.

865
01:36:32,955 --> 01:36:35,708
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.

866
01:36:36,459 --> 01:36:37,918
What is that?

867
01:37:07,781 --> 01:37:10,659
Yes! Yes!

868
01:37:17,249 --> 01:37:22,379
We have confirmation from the <i>Icarus</i>. First
two ships are in position for counterattack.

869
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:23,672
Good.

870
01:37:24,673 --> 01:37:25,716
Any change?

871
01:37:25,883 --> 01:37:28,636
They hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little.

872
01:37:28,802 --> 01:37:31,931
- How much?
- An hour, maybe.

873
01:37:32,097 --> 01:37:34,642
That would give them
a little over nine hours.

874
01:37:35,476 --> 01:37:37,102
Yes, sir.

875
01:38:09,718 --> 01:38:11,971
<i>There is a building.</i>

876
01:38:12,137 --> 01:38:17,810
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go...

877
01:38:17,977 --> 01:38:19,895
...and no stair can reach.

878
01:38:20,563 --> 01:38:26,652
<i>This level is filled with doors.
These doors lead to many places.</i>

879
01:38:26,819 --> 01:38:29,154
Hidden places.

880
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:33,117
But one door is special.

881
01:38:33,284 --> 01:38:35,494
One door leads to the source.

882
01:38:43,836 --> 01:38:48,257
This building is protected
by a very secure system.

883
01:38:48,424 --> 01:38:52,928
- Every alarm triggers the bomb.
- Bomb? Did he say bomb?

884
01:38:53,178 --> 01:38:55,848
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.

885
01:38:56,015 --> 01:38:59,018
The system is based on the rules
of a building.

886
01:38:59,184 --> 01:39:02,563
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.

887
01:39:03,105 --> 01:39:07,860
- If one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.

888
01:39:08,027 --> 01:39:10,863
You'd have to take out a city block
to kill the power.

889
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:14,742
- Not one, 27.
- Twenty-seven blocks?

890
01:39:15,576 --> 01:39:18,037
<i>There is a power station.</i>

891
01:39:18,203 --> 01:39:20,456
<i>It must be destroyed.</i>

892
01:39:20,623 --> 01:39:24,960
- There must be some kind of fail-safe.
- Yes, there is an emergency system.

893
01:39:26,587 --> 01:39:30,382
<i>The core network of the grid
must be accessed.</i>

894
01:39:30,549 --> 01:39:33,385
<i>The emergency system
must be deactivated.</i>

895
01:39:33,552 --> 01:39:34,970
<i>What do you need us for?</i>

896
01:39:35,137 --> 01:39:37,306
Neo could take them out
easier than we could.

897
01:39:37,473 --> 01:39:39,224
- There's no time.
- Why?

898
01:39:39,391 --> 01:39:42,519
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

899
01:39:42,686 --> 01:39:44,980
But another connection
must first be made.

900
01:39:45,814 --> 01:39:49,652
<i>- How long will that take?
- Exactly 314 seconds.</i>

901
01:39:49,818 --> 01:39:51,403
<i>Just over five minutes.</i>

902
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:53,822
<i>That is the length
and breadth of the window.</i>

903
01:39:53,989 --> 01:39:56,283
Only the One can open the door...

904
01:39:56,492 --> 01:39:59,411
...and only during that window
can the door be opened.

905
01:40:00,663 --> 01:40:02,247
How do you know all this?

906
01:40:02,414 --> 01:40:07,586
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.

907
01:40:07,753 --> 01:40:13,258
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.

908
01:40:24,019 --> 01:40:26,814
Neo, I know something's wrong.

909
01:40:27,481 --> 01:40:29,525
You don't have to tell me.

910
01:40:29,692 --> 01:40:33,445
I just want you to know that I'm here.

911
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:38,450
All must be done as one.

912
01:40:43,205 --> 01:40:44,873
Can't hurt.

913
01:40:48,419 --> 01:40:50,504
If one fails...

914
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:53,006
<i>...all fail.</i>

915
01:40:53,507 --> 01:40:57,177
At midnight, there is a shift change
in the security of both buildings.

916
01:40:58,554 --> 01:41:01,807
<i>At midnight, we will strike.</i>

917
01:41:02,433 --> 01:41:03,517
Hey!

918
01:41:03,684 --> 01:41:07,646
- You count sheep at home.
- Why? I get paid to count them here.

919
01:41:17,823 --> 01:41:20,033
Okay, they're inside.

920
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,703
- How much time?
- Twelve minutes.

921
01:41:25,414 --> 01:41:26,498
Oh, shit.

922
01:41:29,877 --> 01:41:35,340
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

923
01:41:36,842 --> 01:41:39,011
<i>Tonight is not an accident.</i>

924
01:41:40,345 --> 01:41:42,347
<i>There are no accidents.</i>

925
01:41:43,724 --> 01:41:48,771
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.

926
01:41:48,937 --> 01:41:54,526
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships...

927
01:41:54,693 --> 01:41:58,197
...I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.

928
01:41:58,530 --> 01:42:00,866
<i>I see purpose.</i>

929
01:42:03,577 --> 01:42:09,917
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.

930
01:42:10,083 --> 01:42:15,088
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us...

931
01:42:15,255 --> 01:42:18,592
...the very meaning of our lives.

932
01:42:18,759 --> 01:42:22,930
I want to ask you to do something,
but I don't know how.

933
01:42:23,514 --> 01:42:25,432
I promise you, if I can, I will.

934
01:42:26,767 --> 01:42:30,103
What if I asked you to stay out of this...

935
01:42:31,063 --> 01:42:33,065
...no matter what...

936
01:42:33,232 --> 01:42:35,567
...to stay out of the Matrix?

937
01:42:36,652 --> 01:42:38,445
Why?

938
01:42:46,662 --> 01:42:47,746
Please.

939
01:42:49,832 --> 01:42:51,166
All right.

940
01:42:54,503 --> 01:42:57,005
What is it, Niobe?

941
01:42:57,172 --> 01:43:01,301
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't
help thinking, what if you're wrong?

942
01:43:01,468 --> 01:43:04,763
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

943
01:43:04,930 --> 01:43:08,934
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

944
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:11,979
But how would that be different
from any other day?

945
01:43:21,446 --> 01:43:27,953
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

946
01:43:28,203 --> 01:43:31,123
<i>Death can come for us at any time...</i>

947
01:43:31,665 --> 01:43:33,458
<i>...in any place.</i>

948
01:43:33,625 --> 01:43:35,544
Incoming. Incoming!

949
01:43:37,504 --> 01:43:39,131
Incoming!

950
01:43:45,053 --> 01:43:47,514
Now consider the alternative.

951
01:43:47,681 --> 01:43:52,269
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?

952
01:43:52,436 --> 01:43:56,857
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

953
01:43:57,816 --> 01:44:00,819
Isn't that worth fighting for?

954
01:44:01,945 --> 01:44:04,573
Isn't that worth dying for?

955
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:08,118
- Time?
- Three minutes.

956
01:44:08,285 --> 01:44:09,411
Almost there.

957
01:44:29,473 --> 01:44:30,849
It is done.

958
01:44:31,016 --> 01:44:32,309
Find the others.

959
01:44:33,435 --> 01:44:35,687
I got Niobe there.
They're out of the station.

960
01:44:35,854 --> 01:44:38,523
- What about Soren?
- There.

961
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:40,525
They're still inside, but....

962
01:44:41,401 --> 01:44:42,444
They're not moving.

963
01:45:06,593 --> 01:45:08,512
That's it, let's go.

964
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:12,474
Call Neo now.

965
01:45:16,436 --> 01:45:19,272
- I lost them. They're inside the portal.
- What about the grid?

966
01:45:23,402 --> 01:45:26,905
Everything is operational.
The emergency system is rerouting power.

967
01:45:32,577 --> 01:45:34,746
Jesus.

968
01:45:34,913 --> 01:45:38,959
Soon as they open that door,
it's all over.

969
01:45:39,126 --> 01:45:41,086
The hell it is.

970
01:45:41,837 --> 01:45:43,171
What are you--? Trinity!

971
01:45:44,464 --> 01:45:47,426
I will not wait and do nothing.
I will not watch them die.

972
01:45:47,592 --> 01:45:49,761
We're talking less than five minutes.

973
01:45:49,928 --> 01:45:52,431
In five minutes,
I'll tear that building down.

974
01:45:52,597 --> 01:45:56,143
- How much further?
- Here, just here.

975
01:45:57,436 --> 01:46:01,440
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

976
01:46:02,607 --> 01:46:05,110
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.

977
01:46:08,321 --> 01:46:11,450
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow wings.

978
01:46:30,052 --> 01:46:31,094
- Operator.
<i>- I'm in.</i>

979
01:46:31,261 --> 01:46:33,430
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

980
01:46:34,014 --> 01:46:38,185
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.

981
01:46:38,351 --> 01:46:43,732
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.

982
01:46:43,899 --> 01:46:46,818
- What do you want, Smith?
- You haven't figured that out?

983
01:46:46,985 --> 01:46:52,491
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.

984
01:46:52,657 --> 01:46:55,327
I want exactly what you want.

985
01:46:55,494 --> 01:46:57,579
I want everything.

986
01:46:58,038 --> 01:47:00,540
Would that include a bullet
from this gun?

987
01:47:00,707 --> 01:47:02,501
Go ahead, shoot.

988
01:47:02,667 --> 01:47:07,964
The best thing about being me,
there's so many me's.

989
01:47:19,351 --> 01:47:22,979
Christ! What the hell happened in here?

990
01:47:23,855 --> 01:47:25,899
Hold it right there, little lady.

991
01:47:35,242 --> 01:47:37,035
If you can't beat us....

992
01:47:37,202 --> 01:47:39,037
Join us.

993
01:47:41,206 --> 01:47:42,290
Morpheus!

994
01:47:55,887 --> 01:47:59,015
Still no sight of them.
They only got two minutes left.

995
01:48:12,779 --> 01:48:13,822
One minute.

996
01:48:23,039 --> 01:48:24,082
Come on.

997
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:27,169
Come on.

998
01:48:27,752 --> 01:48:29,629
Please.

999
01:48:39,556 --> 01:48:41,099
Kill them.

1000
01:48:48,982 --> 01:48:50,025
They're in.

1001
01:48:50,192 --> 01:48:52,152
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

1002
01:49:07,709 --> 01:49:09,836
It was meant to be.

1003
01:49:10,003 --> 01:49:15,383
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

1004
01:49:24,142 --> 01:49:28,480
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

1005
01:49:33,985 --> 01:49:37,155
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

1006
01:50:29,457 --> 01:50:30,834
Hello, Neo.

1007
01:50:31,376 --> 01:50:35,171
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

1008
01:50:35,338 --> 01:50:38,967
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

1009
01:50:39,217 --> 01:50:43,388
You have many questions. Though the
process has altered your consciousness...

1010
01:50:43,555 --> 01:50:45,557
...you remain irrevocably human.

1011
01:50:45,724 --> 01:50:49,311
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

1012
01:50:49,728 --> 01:50:53,773
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

1013
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:57,652
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

1014
01:50:58,528 --> 01:51:00,155
Why am I here?

1015
01:51:00,322 --> 01:51:04,242
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

1016
01:51:04,409 --> 01:51:06,745
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

1017
01:51:06,911 --> 01:51:10,999
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

1018
01:51:11,166 --> 01:51:14,002
...I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

1019
01:51:14,169 --> 01:51:18,631
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

1020
01:51:18,965 --> 01:51:21,301
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

1021
01:51:21,468 --> 01:51:25,930
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

1022
01:51:26,097 --> 01:51:30,060
...which has led you, inexorably...

1023
01:51:31,019 --> 01:51:32,270
...here.

1024
01:51:32,437 --> 01:51:36,524
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

1025
01:51:36,691 --> 01:51:40,487
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

1026
01:51:40,653 --> 01:51:43,281
<i>Others? How many?
What others?</i>

1027
01:51:43,448 --> 01:51:45,950
The Matrix is older than you know.

1028
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:50,121
I count from the emergence of one integral
anomaly to the emergence of the next.

1029
01:51:50,288 --> 01:51:52,540
In which case, this is the sixth version.

1030
01:51:52,707 --> 01:51:55,168
<i>Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.</i>

1031
01:51:55,335 --> 01:51:58,880
<i>There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.</i>

1032
01:51:59,047 --> 01:52:00,340
<i>Either no one told me...</i>

1033
01:52:01,591 --> 01:52:05,595
- ...or no one knows.
- Precisely.

1034
01:52:05,762 --> 01:52:09,057
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

1035
01:52:09,224 --> 01:52:12,644
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

1036
01:52:12,811 --> 01:52:16,064
<i>You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!</i>

1037
01:52:16,231 --> 01:52:18,024
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>

1038
01:52:18,191 --> 01:52:21,361
<i>You can't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!</i>

1039
01:52:23,655 --> 01:52:25,156
Choice.

1040
01:52:25,323 --> 01:52:27,158
The problem is choice.

1041
01:52:49,389 --> 01:52:53,017
The first Matrix I designed
was naturally perfect, a work of art.

1042
01:52:53,184 --> 01:52:55,019
Flawless, sublime.

1043
01:52:55,186 --> 01:52:58,690
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

1044
01:52:59,357 --> 01:53:01,776
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

1045
01:53:01,943 --> 01:53:05,280
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human.

1046
01:53:05,447 --> 01:53:08,408
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

1047
01:53:08,575 --> 01:53:12,579
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

1048
01:53:13,288 --> 01:53:17,041
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

1049
01:53:18,501 --> 01:53:21,129
I have come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

1050
01:53:21,296 --> 01:53:23,339
...because it required a lesser mind.

1051
01:53:23,506 --> 01:53:29,471
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

1052
01:53:29,888 --> 01:53:34,309
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

1053
01:53:34,476 --> 01:53:39,272
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

1054
01:53:39,439 --> 01:53:45,403
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

1055
01:53:46,029 --> 01:53:48,323
- The Oracle.
- Please.

1056
01:53:49,032 --> 01:53:53,036
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a
solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...

1057
01:53:53,203 --> 01:53:56,080
...accepted the program, as long as they
were given a choice...

1058
01:53:56,247 --> 01:54:00,376
...even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.

1059
01:54:00,543 --> 01:54:03,963
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...

1060
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:08,134
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

1061
01:54:08,301 --> 01:54:11,012
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.

1062
01:54:11,387 --> 01:54:15,517
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

1063
01:54:15,683 --> 01:54:19,771
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

1064
01:54:19,938 --> 01:54:21,731
This is about Zion.

1065
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:25,860
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1066
01:54:26,027 --> 01:54:30,448
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

1067
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:31,783
Bullshit.

1068
01:54:31,950 --> 01:54:35,119
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1069
01:54:35,328 --> 01:54:41,793
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

1070
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:45,964
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1071
01:54:58,685 --> 01:54:59,978
The function of the One...

1072
01:55:00,144 --> 01:55:04,816
...is now to return to the source, allowing
a dissemination of the code you carry...

1073
01:55:04,983 --> 01:55:06,693
...reinserting the prime program.

1074
01:55:07,277 --> 01:55:11,281
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

1075
01:55:11,447 --> 01:55:14,701
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

1076
01:55:14,867 --> 01:55:19,414
Failure to comply with this process
will result in a cataclysmic system crash...

1077
01:55:19,581 --> 01:55:21,916
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

1078
01:55:22,083 --> 01:55:24,669
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

1079
01:55:24,836 --> 01:55:29,048
...will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

1080
01:55:29,382 --> 01:55:33,469
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

1081
01:55:34,262 --> 01:55:37,890
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1082
01:55:38,057 --> 01:55:40,852
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

1083
01:55:41,019 --> 01:55:44,606
...to accept the responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

1084
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:53,615
It is interesting reading your reactions.

1085
01:55:54,657 --> 01:55:58,494
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

1086
01:55:58,661 --> 01:56:03,124
...a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment...

1087
01:56:03,291 --> 01:56:06,878
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

1088
01:56:07,045 --> 01:56:09,380
While the others experience this
in a general way...

1089
01:56:09,547 --> 01:56:12,508
...your experience is far more specific...

1090
01:56:12,842 --> 01:56:15,720
...vis-à-vis love.

1091
01:56:16,721 --> 01:56:18,348
Trinity!

1092
01:56:20,642 --> 01:56:24,979
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.

1093
01:56:25,355 --> 01:56:26,397
No.

1094
01:56:27,106 --> 01:56:31,235
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

1095
01:56:31,402 --> 01:56:34,489
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

1096
01:56:34,656 --> 01:56:38,660
...as both beginning and end.

1097
01:56:38,826 --> 01:56:40,495
There are two doors.

1098
01:56:40,662 --> 01:56:43,873
The door to your right leads to the source
and the salvation of Zion.

1099
01:56:44,457 --> 01:56:50,755
The door to your left leads back to the
Matrix, to her and the end of your species.

1100
01:56:50,922 --> 01:56:55,301
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

1101
01:56:55,468 --> 01:56:58,971
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?

1102
01:56:59,138 --> 01:57:03,226
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal...

1103
01:57:03,393 --> 01:57:08,648
...the onset of an emotion designed
specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.

1104
01:57:08,815 --> 01:57:13,444
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:

1105
01:57:13,611 --> 01:57:20,118
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

1106
01:57:25,123 --> 01:57:29,252
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously...

1107
01:57:29,419 --> 01:57:33,131
...the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

1108
01:57:33,297 --> 01:57:37,635
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

1109
01:57:37,802 --> 01:57:39,220
We won't.

1110
01:57:46,644 --> 01:57:48,855
We got a serious situation, sir.

1111
01:57:49,313 --> 01:57:50,398
Oh, no.

1112
01:58:50,041 --> 01:58:53,586
- What was that?
- It's moving faster than anything I've seen.

1113
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:46,013
Holy shit, he caught her.

1114
01:59:59,944 --> 02:00:01,779
Neo, I had to.

1115
02:00:01,946 --> 02:00:03,698
I know.

1116
02:00:08,744 --> 02:00:11,289
The bullet is still inside.

1117
02:00:22,049 --> 02:00:23,968
Trinity...

1118
02:00:25,177 --> 02:00:26,888
...don't you quit on me now.

1119
02:00:36,063 --> 02:00:38,649
I'm sorry.

1120
02:00:45,156 --> 02:00:47,450
Trinity.

1121
02:00:57,418 --> 02:00:59,378
Trinity...

1122
02:00:59,545 --> 02:01:01,339
...I know you can hear me.

1123
02:01:02,131 --> 02:01:04,675
I'm not letting go.

1124
02:01:04,842 --> 02:01:06,469
I can't.

1125
02:01:07,678 --> 02:01:09,889
I love you too damn much.

1126
02:01:38,584 --> 02:01:39,877
I can't take this.

1127
02:01:43,631 --> 02:01:46,717
I guess this makes us even.

1128
02:01:59,397 --> 02:02:01,357
I don't understand it.

1129
02:02:01,524 --> 02:02:04,527
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.

1130
02:02:04,694 --> 02:02:07,738
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.

1131
02:02:07,905 --> 02:02:10,741
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?

1132
02:02:10,908 --> 02:02:15,246
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.

1133
02:02:15,663 --> 02:02:17,289
- What?
- How do you know that?

1134
02:02:17,748 --> 02:02:19,792
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?

1135
02:02:20,793 --> 02:02:23,629
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

1136
02:02:23,796 --> 02:02:27,633
- That's impossible. The prophecy tells us--
- It was a lie, Morpheus.

1137
02:02:29,385 --> 02:02:31,929
The prophecy was a lie.

1138
02:02:33,139 --> 02:02:36,142
The One was never meant
to end anything.

1139
02:02:36,308 --> 02:02:39,353
It was all another system of control.

1140
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:42,606
I don't believe that.

1141
02:02:42,940 --> 02:02:45,276
But you said it yourself.

1142
02:02:45,443 --> 02:02:49,447
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?

1143
02:02:55,619 --> 02:02:58,080
I'm sorry.

1144
02:02:58,247 --> 02:03:01,625
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

1145
02:03:01,792 --> 02:03:04,962
...I swear to you it's the truth.

1146
02:03:08,174 --> 02:03:10,885
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

1147
02:03:13,095 --> 02:03:14,305
Oh, no!

1148
02:03:23,647 --> 02:03:26,984
- What are they doing?
- They're just out of EMP range.

1149
02:03:27,485 --> 02:03:28,736
It's a bomb.

1150
02:03:29,904 --> 02:03:32,114
We have to get out of here. Now.

1151
02:04:08,818 --> 02:04:10,694
I have dreamed a dream...

1152
02:04:13,739 --> 02:04:17,118
...but now that dream
has gone from me.

1153
02:04:28,170 --> 02:04:30,422
Here they come.

1154
02:04:30,673 --> 02:04:32,383
Let's go, Morpheus.

1155
02:04:33,801 --> 02:04:36,846
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

1156
02:04:44,562 --> 02:04:47,565
- Come on!
- Something's different.

1157
02:04:47,731 --> 02:04:49,733
What?

1158
02:04:50,401 --> 02:04:51,902
I can feel them.

1159
02:05:14,842 --> 02:05:16,427
Neo!

1160
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:26,187
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1161
02:05:31,442 --> 02:05:33,360
It's the <i>Hammer.</i>

1162
02:05:45,039 --> 02:05:47,750
He's in some kind of coma...

1163
02:05:47,917 --> 02:05:50,169
...but his vitals are stable.

1164
02:05:51,378 --> 02:05:53,297
What about you?

1165
02:05:53,464 --> 02:05:55,591
I'm fine.

1166
02:05:55,758 --> 02:05:58,135
You could use some rest.

1167
02:05:58,302 --> 02:06:00,137
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

1168
02:06:07,228 --> 02:06:09,855
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

1169
02:06:10,022 --> 02:06:12,900
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

1170
02:06:13,067 --> 02:06:15,819
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

1171
02:06:16,070 --> 02:06:19,490
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

1172
02:06:19,823 --> 02:06:22,368
...until someone screwed it up.

1173
02:06:22,534 --> 02:06:25,162
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

1174
02:06:25,329 --> 02:06:27,206
Five ships were instantly downed.

1175
02:06:27,373 --> 02:06:29,166
When the machines broke through...

1176
02:06:29,333 --> 02:06:32,544
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

1177
02:06:32,711 --> 02:06:35,547
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

1178
02:06:35,714 --> 02:06:38,175
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

1179
02:06:38,342 --> 02:06:40,094
Who?

1180
02:06:40,261 --> 02:06:43,973
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

1181
02:06:44,139 --> 02:06:46,433
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

1182
02:06:46,642 --> 02:06:47,726
You found one?

1183
02:06:49,478 --> 02:06:51,188
Only one.

1184
02:16:44,281 --> 02:16:47,576
<i>Everything that has a beginning...</i>

1185
02:16:47,742 --> 02:16:49,452
<i>...has an end.</i>

1186
02:16:51,872 --> 02:16:54,749
<i>I see the end coming.</i>

1187
02:16:54,916 --> 02:16:58,712
<i>I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.</i>

1188
02:17:00,839 --> 02:17:03,842
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

1189
02:17:04,009 --> 02:17:06,011
We missed you.

1190
02:17:06,177 --> 02:17:08,013
It ends tonight.

1191
02:17:15,228 --> 02:17:18,356
<i>You are all that stands in his way.</i>

1192
02:17:19,941 --> 02:17:24,487
<i>If you cannot stop him tonight,
then I fear that tomorrow may never come.</i>
