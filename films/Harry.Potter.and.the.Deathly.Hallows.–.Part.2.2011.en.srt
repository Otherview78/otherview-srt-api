1
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,322
It's beautiful here.

2
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,033
It was our aunt's.

3
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,410
We used to come here as kids.

4
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,622
The Order uses it now as a safe house.

5
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,042
What's left of us, at least.

6
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,423
Muggles think these keep evil away,
but they're wrong.

7
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,844
I need to talk to the goblin.

8
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,982
How are you?

9
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,486
Alive.

10
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,951
You probably don't remember--

11
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,287
That I showed you to your vault
the first time you came to Gringotts?

12
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,999
Even amongst goblins you're famous,
Harry Potter.

13
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,463
You buried the elf.

14
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,006
Yes.

15
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,883
And brought me here.

16
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,595
You are...

17
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,808
...a very unusual wizard.

18
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,609
How did you come by this sword?

19
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,490
It's complicated.

20
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,246
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it
should be in her vault at Gringotts?

21
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,499
It's complicated.

22
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,381
The sword presented itself to us
in a moment of need.

23
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,300
We didn't steal it.

24
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,723
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's
vault identical to this one...

25
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,516
...but it is a fake.

26
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,351
It was placed there this summer.

27
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,855
- And she never suspected it was a fake?
- The replica is very convincing.

28
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,901
Only a goblin would recognize
that this is the true sword of Gryffindor.

29
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,778
Who is the acquaintance?

30
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:42,407
A Hogwarts professor.
As I understand it, he's now headmaster.

31
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,242
Snape?

32
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,954
He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault?

33
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,706
Why?

34
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:54,461
There are more than a few curious things
in the vaults at Gringotts.

35
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,381
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?

36
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,260
Perhaps.

37
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:08,058
I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.

38
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,893
This is impossible.

39
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,980
Alone, yes. But with you, no.

40
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,570
Why should I help you?

41
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,490
I have gold. Lots of it.

42
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,701
- I have no interest in gold.
- Then what?

43
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,416
That.

44
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,085
That is my price.

45
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,810
Are you thinking
there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

46
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,479
She was terrified when she
thought we'd been in there.

47
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,523
She kept asking you
what else we'd taken.

48
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,609
I bet you there's a Horcrux in there,
another piece of his soul.

49
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,737
Let's find it and kill it,
we're one step closer to killing him.

50
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,698
And what happens when we find it?

51
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,285
How are we supposed to destroy it
now you've given the sword to Griphook?

52
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,495
I'm still working on that part.

53
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,124
He's weak.

54
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,135
Yes?

55
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,974
Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you
a few questions.

56
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,935
Anything, my boy, anything.

57
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,480
Would you mind identifying this wand?

58
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,275
We need to know if it's safe to use.

59
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,991
Walnut.

60
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,453
Dragon heart string.

61
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,873
Twelve and three-quarter inches.

62
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,667
Unyie--

63
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,421
Unyielding.

64
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,760
This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.

65
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,721
Treat it carefully.

66
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,723
And this?

67
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,020
Hawthorn.

68
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,940
And unicorn hair.

69
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,779
Ten inches. Reasonably pliant.

70
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:33,870
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

71
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,082
Was? Is it not still?

72
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:41,378
Well, perhaps not, if you won it from him.

73
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,384
I sense its allegiance has changed.

74
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:56,976
You talk about wands
as if they have feelings...

75
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,188
...can think.

76
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:08,029
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.

77
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:13,535
That much has always been clear
to those of us who have studied wandlore.

78
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,081
And what do you know
about the Deathly Hallows?

79
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,256
It is rumored there are three:

80
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,093
The Elder Wand...

81
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:36,099
...the Cloak of Invisibility
to hide you from your enemies...

82
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:42,105
...and the Resurrection Stone
to bring back loved ones from the dead.

83
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:47,277
Together, they make one
the master of death.

84
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:53,533
But few truly believe
that such objects exist.

85
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,368
Do you?

86
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,121
Do you believe they exist, sir?

87
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:08,256
I see no reason to put stock
into an old wives' tale.

88
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,924
You're lying.

89
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,386
You know one exists.

90
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,388
You told him about it.

91
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:21,102
You told him about the Elder Wand
and where he could go looking for it.

92
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,691
He tortured me.

93
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,196
Besides...

94
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,908
...I only conveyed rumors.

95
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,203
There's...

96
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,582
There's no telling whether he will find it.

97
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,504
He has found it, sir.

98
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,178
We'll let you rest.

99
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,099
He's after you, Mr. Potter.

100
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,523
If it's true, what you say,
and he has the Elder Wand...

101
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,026
...I'm afraid...

102
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,530
...you really don't stand a chance.

103
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,326
Well, I suppose I'll have to kill him
before he finds me, then.

104
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,750
Are you sure that's hers?

105
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,045
Positive.

106
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,719
Well?

107
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,639
How do I look?

108
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,724
Hideous.

109
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,645
You can give that to Hermione to hold,
all right, Griphook?

110
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,666
We're relying on you.

111
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,879
If you get us past the guards
and into the vault, the sword's yours.

112
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,601
Madam Lestrange.

113
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,561
Good morning.

114
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,441
"Good morning"? "Good morning"?

115
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,736
You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not some dewy-eyed school girl.

116
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,613
Hey. Easy.

117
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:41,326
She gives us away, we might as well
use that sword to slit our own throats.

118
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,369
Understand?

119
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,040
No, he's right. I was being stupid.

120
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,791
Okay.

121
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,710
Let's do it.

122
00:11:50,710 --> 00:12:20,710
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

123
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,236
I wish to enter my vault.

124
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,700
Identification?

125
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,372
I hardly think that'll be necessary.

126
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,710
Madam Lestrange.

127
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,718
I don't like to be kept waiting.

128
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,302
They know.

129
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,638
They know she's an imposter.

130
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,268
They've been warned.

131
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,902
Harry?

132
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,613
What do we do, Harry?

133
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:52,040
Madam Lestrange,
would you mind presenting your wand?

134
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,208
And why should I do that?

135
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:59,922
It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you
understand given the current climate.

136
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,259
No. I most certainly do not understand.

137
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:07,263
I'm afraid I must insist.

138
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,437
<i>lmperio.</i>

139
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:24,113
Very well, Madam Lestrange.
If you will follow me.

140
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,442
What is that, Griphook?

141
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,241
Griphook.

142
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,720
<i>Arresto momentum.</i>

143
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,725
Well done, Hermione.

144
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,902
Oh, no, you look like you again.

145
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:49,365
The Thief's Downfall.
Washes away all enchantments.

146
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,658
Can be deadly.

147
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,451
You don't say.

148
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,621
Just out of interest,
is there any other way out of here?

149
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,456
No.

150
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:02,336
What the devil are all you
doing down here?

151
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,713
Thieves!

152
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,173
- When you gave up the keys, you--
- <i>lmperio.</i>

153
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,437
That doesn't sound good.

154
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,198
Bloody hell.

155
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,700
That's a Ukrainian Ironbelly.

156
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,410
Here.

157
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,382
It's been trained to expect pain
when it hears the noise.

158
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,092
That's barbaric.

159
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,707
<i>Lumos.</i>

160
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,380
Blimey.

161
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,639
<i>Accio</i> Horcrux.

162
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,184
You're not trying that one again,
are you?

163
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,145
That kind of magic won't work in here.

164
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,360
Is it in here, Harry?

165
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,654
Can you feel anything?

166
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,970
That's it. Up there.

167
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,768
They've added the Gemino curse.
Everything you touch will multiply.

168
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,395
Give me the sword.

169
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,081
Stop moving.

170
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,938
Got it.

171
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,193
We had a deal, Griphook.

172
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,736
The cup for the sword.

173
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:24,413
I said I'd get you in.
I didn't say anything about getting you out.

174
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,102
Griphook!

175
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,938
- Thieves! Help!
- Griphook!

176
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,940
Thieves!

177
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,570
Foul little git.
Least we've still got Bogrod.

178
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:04,453
That's unfortunate.

179
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,627
We can't just stand here.
Who's got an idea?

180
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,337
You're the brilliant one.

181
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,798
I've got something, but it's mad.

182
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,299
<i>Reducto.</i>

183
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,313
Well, come on, then.

184
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,026
<i>Relashio.</i>

185
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,617
He's moving! Aah!

186
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,394
Now what?

187
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,896
<i>Reducto.</i>

188
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,523
Hold on.

189
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:09,954
That was brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

190
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:37,940
We're dropping.

191
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,279
- I say we jump.
- When?

192
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,823
Now.

193
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,213
He knows. You-Know-Who.

194
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,007
He knows we broke into Gringotts.

195
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,343
He knows what we took
and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.

196
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,345
- How is it you know?
- I saw him.

197
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,973
You let him in? Harry, you can't do that.

198
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,685
Hermione, I can't always help it.
Well, maybe I can. I don't know.

199
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,562
Never mind. What happened?

200
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,522
Well, he's angry.

201
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,274
And scared too.

202
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,944
He knows if we find and destroy all
the Horcruxes we'll be able to kill him.

203
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,782
I reckon he'll stop at nothing
to make sure we don't find the rest.

204
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,243
There's more. One of them's at Hogwarts.

205
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,120
What?

206
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,956
- You saw it?
- I saw the castle and Rowena Ravenclaw.

207
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,709
It must have to do with her.
We have to go there now.

208
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,171
We can't do that. We've got to plan.
We've got to figure it out.

209
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,466
Hermione, when have any of our plans
ever actually worked?

210
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,052
We plan, we get there,
all hell breaks loose.

211
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,429
He's right.

212
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:36,850
One problem: Snape's headmaster now.
We can't just walk through the front door.

213
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:41,772
Um, well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,
to Honeydukes.

214
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,274
Take the secret passage in the cellar.

215
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,820
It's-- There's something wrong with him.

216
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,324
It's like, you know, in the past, I've always
been able to follow his thoughts.

217
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,369
And now everything
just feels disconnected.

218
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,829
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.

219
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,997
Maybe he's growing weaker.
Maybe he's dying.

220
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,292
No. No, it's more like he's wounded.

221
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,254
If anything, he feels more dangerous.

222
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,638
- They're here!
- Search everywhere!

223
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,056
Look down by the stables!
You two, come with me!

224
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,643
Any sign?

225
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,201
Potter!

226
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,925
In here, Potter.

227
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,398
Did you get a look at him?

228
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,360
- For a second, I thought it was...
- I know. Dumbledore.

229
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,336
Harry?

230
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,548
I can see you in this.

231
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,272
You bloody fools.
What were you thinking coming here?

232
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,733
Have you any idea how dangerous it is?

233
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,570
You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.

234
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,906
It's you who I've been seeing in here.

235
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,367
You're the one who sent Dobby.

236
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:41,827
Where have you left him?

237
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,578
He's dead.

238
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,164
Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.

239
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,251
Who gave that to you? The mirror?

240
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,087
Mundungus Fletcher, about a year ago.

241
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:55,507
- Dung had no right. It belonged to--
- Sirius.

242
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,884
Albus told me.

243
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:02,681
He also told me you'd likely be hacked off
if you ever found out I had it...

244
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:07,769
...but ask yourself,
where would you be if I didn't?

245
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,442
Do you hear from the others much?
From the Order?

246
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,569
The Order's finished.

247
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,112
You-Know-Who's won.

248
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,657
Anyone who says otherwise
is kidding themselves.

249
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,368
We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.

250
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,495
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

251
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,330
Did he now?

252
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,957
Nice job? Easy?

253
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,045
We've been hunting Horcruxes.

254
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,631
We think the last one's inside the castle,
but we'll need help getting in.

255
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,510
That's not a job my brother's given you.
It's a suicide mission.

256
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,056
Do yourself a favor, boy, go home.
Live a little longer.

257
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:48,894
- Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
- What makes you think you can trust him?

258
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,855
You think you can believe
anything my brother told you?

259
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:55,817
In all the time you knew him,
did he ever mention my name?

260
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,904
Did he ever mention hers?

261
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,783
- Why should he--?
- Keep secrets? You tell me.

262
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:07,287
- I trusted him.
- That's a boy's answer.

263
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,540
A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes
on the word of a man...

264
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,460
...who wouldn't even tell him where to start.
You're lying!

265
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,923
Not just to me, that doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.

266
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,133
That's what a fool does.

267
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,179
You don't strike me as a fool,
Harry Potter.

268
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:29,017
So I'll ask you again.
There must be a reason.

269
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:34,356
I'm not interested in what happened
between you and your brother.

270
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,359
I don't care that you've given up.

271
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,405
I trusted the man I knew.

272
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,620
And we need to get into
the castle tonight.

273
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,294
You know what to do.

274
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,845
Where have you sent her?

275
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,890
You'll see soon enough.

276
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,858
That's your sister, Ariana, isn't it?

277
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,570
She died very young, didn't she?

278
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,241
My brother sacrificed many things,
Mr. Potter...

279
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,910
...on his journey to find power...

280
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,329
...including Ariana.

281
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,624
And she was devoted to him.

282
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,669
He gave her everything...

283
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,380
...but time.

284
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,134
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

285
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,518
He did save our lives twice.

286
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,313
Kept an eye on us in that mirror.

287
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,609
That doesn't seem
like someone who's given up.

288
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,908
She's coming back.

289
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,826
Who's that with her?

290
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,127
Neville.

291
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,796
- Oh, you look--
- Like hell, I reckon.

292
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,591
This is nothing. Seamus is worse.

293
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:28,803
Hey, Ab, we've got a couple more
coming through.

294
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,848
Don't remember this
on the Marauder's Map.

295
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,934
That's because it never existed till now.

296
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,354
The seven secret passages were sealed <i>off</i>
before the start of the year.

297
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,314
This is the only way in or out now.

298
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,108
The grounds are crawling with
Death Eaters and Dementors.

299
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,985
How bad is Snape as headmaster?

300
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,113
Hardly ever see him.
It's the Carrows you need to watch out for.

301
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,323
Carrows?

302
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,951
Yeah. Brother and sister.
In charge of discipline.

303
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,827
They like punishment, the Carrows.

304
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,996
They did that to you? Why?

305
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,833
Today's Dark Arts lessons
had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse.

306
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,919
On first-years.

307
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,921
I refused.

308
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,840
Hogwarts has changed.

309
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,189
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?

310
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,239
Hey, listen up, you lot.
Brought you a surprise.

311
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:33,535
Not more of Aberforth's cooking, I hope.
Be a surprise if we can digest it.

312
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,455
Blimey.

313
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,958
- Harry!
- Yeah!

314
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,473
Get the word out to Remus and the others
that Harry's back.

315
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,809
Okay, let's not kill him before
You-Know-Who--

316
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,519
River, D.A. calling. Do you read?

317
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,604
We have a new weather report:
Lightning has struck.

318
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,566
What's the plan, Harry?

319
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,447
Okay.

320
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,533
There's something we need to find.

321
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,663
Something hidden here in the castle.
And it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.

322
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,623
Right. What is it?

323
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,958
We don't know.

324
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,838
- Where is it?
- We don't know that either.

325
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,426
- I realize it's not much to go on.
- That's nothing to go on.

326
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,095
I think it has something to do
with Ravenclaw.

327
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,933
Um, it'll be small, easily concealed.

328
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,936
Anyone, any ideas?

329
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,774
Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's
lost diadem.

330
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,486
- Oh, bloody hell. Here we go.
- Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?

331
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,991
Hasn't anyone heard of it?
It's quite famous.

332
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,536
Yes, but, Luna, it's lost,
for centuries now.

333
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,498
There isn't a person alive today
who's seen it.

334
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,875
Excuse me. Can someone tell me
what a bloody diadem is?

335
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,795
It's a sort of crown.
You know, like a tiara.

336
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,299
Harry.

337
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,885
Hi there.

338
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,141
Six months she hasn't seen me
and it's like I'm Frankie First-Year.

339
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,060
- I'm her brother.
- Got lots of those.

340
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,521
- There's only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus.

341
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,189
What is it, Ginny?

342
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:30,568
Snape knows. He knows that Harry
was spotted in Hogsmeade.

343
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:15,196
Many of you are surely wondering
why I have summoned you at this hour.

344
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,411
It's come to my attention
that earlier this evening...

345
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,123
...Harry Potter was sighted
in Hogsmeade.

346
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,210
Now...

347
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,004
...should anyone...

348
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:37,886
...student or staff,
attempt to aid Mr. Potter...

349
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,181
...they will be punished...

350
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:45,810
...in a manner consistent with
the severity of their transgression.

351
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,229
Furthermore...

352
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:53,234
...any person found to have knowledge
of these events...

353
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:58,531
...who fails to come forward...

354
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:04,037
...will be treated as...

355
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,916
...equally guilty.

356
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,045
Now then...

357
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,592
...if anyone here...

358
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:24,265
...has any knowledge of Mr. Potter's
movements this evening...

359
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:30,355
...I invite them to step forward...

360
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,610
...now.

361
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:54,128
It seems, despite your exhaustive
defensive strategies...

362
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,965
...you still have a bit of a security problem,
headmaster.

363
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,471
And I'm afraid it's quite extensive.

364
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,307
How dare you stand where he stood?

365
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,061
Tell them how it happened that night.

366
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:14,774
Tell them how you looked him in the eye,
a man who trusted you, and killed him.

367
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,818
Tell them.

368
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,677
McGonagall:
Coward!

369
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,230
<i>Harry.</i>

370
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,524
McGonagall:
Potter?

371
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:36,731
<i>I know that many of you will want to fight.</i>

372
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:41,944
<i>Some of you may even think
that to fight is wise.</i>

373
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:45,406
<i>But this is folly.</i>

374
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,743
<i>Give me Harry Potter.</i>

375
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,873
<i>Do this and none shall be harmed.</i>

376
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:00,088
<i>Give me Harry Potter
and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.</i>

377
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,174
<i>Give me Harry Potter...</i>

378
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:07,261
<i>...and you will be rewarded.</i>

379
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:11,057
<i>You have one hour.</i>

380
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,777
What are you waiting for?

381
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,278
Someone grab him.

382
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,123
Students out of bed.

383
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,167
Students out of bed!

384
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,919
Students in the corridor!

385
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:43,464
They are supposed to be out of bed,
you blithering idiot.

386
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,300
Oh.

387
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:47,927
Sorry, ma'am.

388
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:51,973
As it happens, Mr. Filch,
your arrival is most opportune.

389
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,475
If you would, I would like you, please...

390
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:59,147
...to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest
of Slytherin House from the hall.

391
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,691
Exactly where is it
I'll be leading them to, ma'am?

392
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,652
The dungeons would do.

393
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,448
Right. Come on. Come on.

394
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:12,910
I presume you have a reason for returning,
Potter. What is it you need?

395
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,663
Time, professor.
As much as you can get me.

396
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,834
Do what you have to do.
I'll secure the castle.

397
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,295
Potter.

398
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,007
It's good to see you.

399
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,260
It's good to see you too, professor.

400
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,971
Hold the fort, Neville.

401
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,393
Hurry up, come on!

402
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,152
Harry. Hermione and I
have been thinking.

403
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,237
It doesn't matter if we find a Horcrux.

404
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,531
- What do you mean?
- Unless we can destroy it.

405
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,074
So we were thinking...

406
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,744
Ron was thinking.
It was Ron's idea. It's brilliant.

407
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:58,039
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
with a basilisk fang, right?

408
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,374
Me and Hermione
know where we might find one.

409
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,376
Okay.

410
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:06,297
Okay, but take this. That way you can
find me when you get back.

411
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,549
- Where are you going?
- Ravenclaw common room.

412
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,218
Gotta start somewhere.

413
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,726
Harry. Harry!

414
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,522
Let me get this straight.
You're giving us permission to do this?

415
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,566
That is correct, Longbottom.

416
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,151
To blow it up? Boom?

417
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,819
Boom!

418
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,406
Wicked. But how on earth
are we gonna do that?

419
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,909
Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan?

420
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:38,621
As I recall, he has a particular proclivity
for pyrotechnics.

421
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:39,830
I can bring it down.

422
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,375
That's the spirit. Now away you go.

423
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,587
You do realize, of course, we can't keep out
You-Know-Who indefinitely.

424
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,924
McGonagall: Well, that doesn't mean
we can't delay him.

425
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:55,096
And his name is Voldemort, Filius.
You might as well use it.

426
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,182
He's going to try to kill you either way.

427
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,771
<i>Piertotum Locomotor.</i>

428
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:21,122
Hogwarts is threatened.

429
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:27,461
Man the boundaries. Protect us.
Do your duty to our school.

430
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:34,218
I've always wanted to use that spell.

431
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,022
<i>Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.</i>

432
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:50,818
<i>Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.</i>

433
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:55,781
<i>Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.</i>

434
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:56,657
<i>Protego Maxima.</i>

435
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:30,191
- Harry, wait. I need to talk to you.
- I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna.

436
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:33,027
You won't find anything
where you're going. You're wasting time.

437
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,196
- Look, we'll talk later, okay, Luna?
- Harry.

438
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,739
- Later.
- Harry Potter!

439
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,866
You listen to me right now!

440
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:43,412
Don't you remember what Cho said
about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?

441
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,832
"There's not a person alive
who's seen it."

442
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:51,712
It's obvious, isn't it?
We have to talk to someone who's dead.

443
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,892
It's very impressive, isn't it?

444
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,868
If you're to find her,
you'll find her down there.

445
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,453
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

446
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,123
I think it's best if you two talk alone.

447
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,500
She's very shy.

448
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,570
You're the Grey Lady...

449
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,114
...the Ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.

450
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:01,991
I do not answer to that name.

451
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:06,745
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw.

452
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,039
Rowena's daughter.

453
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,250
Are you a friend of Luna's?

454
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,335
Yes.

455
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,963
And she thought you might be able
to help me.

456
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,467
You seek my mother's diadem.

457
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,679
Yes.

458
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:25,639
That's right.

459
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:32,062
Luna is kind,
unlike so many of the others.

460
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:35,316
But she was wrong. I cannot help you.

461
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:42,364
Wait. Please.

462
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,118
I want to destroy it.

463
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,617
They never learn.

464
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,787
Such a pity.

465
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:33,374
But, my Lord...

466
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,834
...shouldn't we wait for...?

467
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,711
My Lord.

468
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,385
Begin.

469
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,324
That's what you want too,
isn't it, Helena?

470
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,164
You want it destroyed.

471
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,376
Another swore to destroy it
many years ago...

472
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,421
...a strange boy with a strange name.

473
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,424
- Tom Riddle.
- But he lied.

474
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,758
He's lied to many people.

475
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:28,053
I know what he's done! I know who he is!

476
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,098
He defiled it with dark magic!

477
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,783
I can destroy it once and for all.

478
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,747
But only if you tell me where he hid it.

479
00:47:56,707 --> 00:48:02,463
You do know where he hid it,
don't you, Helena?

480
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,467
You just have to tell me.

481
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,762
Please.

482
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,817
Strange.

483
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:29,782
You remind me of him a bit.

484
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,242
It's here...

485
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,163
...in the castle, in the place where
everything is hidden.

486
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,793
If you have to ask...

487
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,253
...you will never know.

488
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,174
If you know, you need only ask.

489
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,053
Thank you.

490
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:08,112
Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I
will handle this side of the castle.

491
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,697
Yes, sir.

492
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:17,204
Hey, Dean, on second
thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall...

493
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,207
...we might need one or two more wands
this side.

494
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,712
It is the quality of one's
convictions that determines success...

495
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,631
...not the number of followers.

496
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,800
Who said that?

497
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,802
Me.

498
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,475
You okay, Freddie?

499
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,269
Yeah.

500
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,438
Me too.

501
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:04,168
Harry talks in his sleep.
Have you noticed?

502
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,087
No, of course not.

503
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:56,303
Yeah?

504
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,971
You and whose army?

505
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,826
- You do it.
- I can't.

506
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,079
Yes, you can.

507
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,800
Neville!

508
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,735
That went well.

509
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:31,077
McGonagall: Get inside!
This way, everyone. Take cover!

510
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,597
<i>Stupefy!</i>

511
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:53,433
Get your coat on!

512
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,728
Ginny. Neville. Are you all right?

513
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:01,441
Never better. I feel like I could spit fire.
You haven't seen Luna, have you?

514
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,443
- Luna?
- I'm mad for her!

515
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:07,906
I think it's about time I told her
since we'll probably both be dead by dawn.

516
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,620
I know.

517
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:44,025
Bloody hell. We'll never find it on this.

518
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,861
- There he is, just there.
- Brilliant.

519
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:50,323
He just vanished. Just now. I saw it.

520
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,453
Maybe he's gone to
the Room of Requirement.

521
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,082
It doesn't show up on the map, does it?
You said that last year.

522
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,584
That's right. I-- I did.

523
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,461
Let's go.

524
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,880
Brilliant.

525
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,179
Come on!

526
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,417
Well, well.

527
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,462
What brings you here, Potter?

528
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:12,132
I could ask you the same.

529
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,801
You have something of mine.

530
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,220
I'd like it back.

531
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,764
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- It's my mother's.

532
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:23,810
It's powerful, but it's not the same.

533
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:27,605
Doesn't quite understand me.

534
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,566
Know what I mean?

535
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,110
Why didn't you tell her?

536
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:34,988
Bellatrix.

537
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,619
You knew it was me.
You didn't say anything.

538
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:47,959
Come on, Draco.
Don't be a prat. Do him.

539
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,086
Easy.

540
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:52,797
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

541
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,007
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

542
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:55,175
<i>Stupefy!</i>

543
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,682
That's my girlfriend, you numpties!

544
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,914
Got it.

545
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,047
Run!

546
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,507
Run!

547
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:43,389
Goyle's setting the bloody place on fire!

548
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,292
Come on! This way!

549
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,634
We can't leave them.

550
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,970
He's joking, right?

551
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:15,481
If we die for them, Harry,
I'm gonna kill you.

552
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,839
Harry!

553
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,553
My Lord?

554
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,264
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

555
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:40,900
Come, Nagini. I need to keep you safe.

556
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,081
It's the snake.

557
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:58,876
She's the last one. It's the last Horcrux.

558
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,927
Look inside him, Harry.

559
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,889
Find out where he is.
If we find him, we can find the snake.

560
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:14,183
Then we can end this.

561
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,629
My Lord?

562
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:47,633
Might it be less, uh...

563
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:52,722
Might it not be more prudent
to call off this attack...

564
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,808
...and simply seek the boy yourself?

565
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:59,312
I do not need to seek the boy.

566
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:03,858
Before the night is out, he will come to me.
Do you understand?

567
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:07,820
Look at me.

568
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:11,949
How can you live with yourself, Lucius?

569
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:13,868
I don't know.

570
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,497
Go and find Severus.

571
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:21,167
Bring him to me.

572
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,219
I know where he is.

573
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,022
Come on!

574
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,189
<i>Crucio!</i>

575
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,363
No!

576
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:21,746
You have performed extraordinary
magic with this wand, my Lord...

577
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,956
...in the last few hours alone.

578
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,875
No.

579
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:29,628
No, I am extraordinary...

580
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:33,424
...but the wand resists me.

581
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:36,635
There is no wand more powerful.

582
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:39,638
Ollivander himself has said it.

583
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:45,436
Tonight, when the boy comes,
it will not fail you. I am sure of it.

584
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,316
It answers to you...

585
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,486
...and you only.

586
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:55,738
Does it?

587
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,284
My Lord?

588
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:06,916
The wand, does it truly answer to me?

589
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,795
You're a clever man, Severus.

590
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:12,838
Surely you must know.

591
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:18,260
Where does its true loyalty lie?

592
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,513
With you...

593
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:23,140
...of course, my Lord.

594
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:24,517
The Elder Wand...

595
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:31,107
...cannot serve me properly
because I am not its true master.

596
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:37,696
The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard
who killed its last owner.

597
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:47,289
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.

598
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:53,421
While you live,
the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine.

599
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,634
You've been a good and faithful servant,
Severus...

600
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:04,223
...but only I can live forever.

601
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,561
My Lord--

602
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,360
Nagini, kill.

603
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,423
Take them.

604
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:22,510
Take them.

605
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:24,803
Please.

606
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:28,682
Give me something. Quickly.
A flask, anything.

607
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:48,494
Take them to the Pensieve.

608
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:53,999
Look at me.

609
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,508
You have your mother's eyes.

610
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:39,712
<i>You have fought valiantly...</i>

611
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,882
<i>...but in vain.</i>

612
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:49,430
<i>I do not wish this.</i>

613
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:55,144
<i>Every drop of magical blood spilled
is a terrible waste.</i>

614
01:11:55,311 --> 01:12:00,065
<i>I therefore command my forces to retreat.</i>

615
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:05,779
<i>In their absence,
dispose of your dead with dignity.</i>

616
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:12,328
<i>Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.</i>

617
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:17,875
<i>On this night, you have allowed
your friends to die for you...</i>

618
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:20,544
<i>...rather than face me yourself.</i>

619
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:24,256
<i>There is no greater dishonor.</i>

620
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:29,428
<i>Join me in the Forbidden Forest
and confront your fate.</i>

621
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:33,265
<i>If you do not do this...</i>

622
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:40,105
<i>...I shall kill every last man,
woman and child...</i>

623
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:44,860
<i>...who tries to conceal you from me.</i>

624
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:06,340
Where is everybody?

625
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:32,157
Harry.

626
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,624
Oh, come on.
What's the matter with you?

627
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,418
Oh, she's passed.

628
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:46,714
There, she's gone.

629
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:39,892
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:39,892
...

630
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,136
Come here.

631
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:00,389
I'm gonna tell Mummy. You're a freak.

632
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,975
You're a freak, Lily!

633
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:04,768
Come here.

634
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:29,042
She's jealous because
she's ordinary and you're special.

635
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:31,753
That's mean, Severus.

636
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,653
Gryffindor!

637
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:07,122
- Hi. I'm James.
- Hi. I'm Lily.

638
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:15,839
<i>Just like your father. Lazy. Arrogant.</i>

639
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:17,841
<i>Don't say a word against my father.</i>

640
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,724
<i>Blood shall be spilt...</i>

641
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:30,896
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

642
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,981
<i>Severus.</i>

643
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,068
No. Don't kill me.

644
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:40,072
The prophecy did not refer to a woman.

645
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:42,491
It spoke of a boy born at the end of July.

646
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,910
Yes, but he thinks it's her son.

647
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:48,664
He intends to hunt them down now,
to kill them.

648
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:53,335
Hide her. Hide them all. I beg you.

649
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,588
What will you give me
in exchange, Severus?

650
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,383
Anything.

651
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:04,262
Harry. Harry, you are so loved. So loved.

652
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:07,933
Harry, Mama loves you.

653
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,976
Dada loves you.

654
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:14,064
Harry, be safe.

655
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:15,273
Be strong.

656
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,942
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

657
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:25,909
You said you would keep her safe.

658
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:30,122
Lily and James put
their faith in the wrong person, Severus.

659
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:33,125
Rather like you.

660
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:36,753
The boy survives.

661
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,172
He doesn't need protection.
The Dark Lord is gone.

662
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:41,591
The Dark Lord will return.

663
01:18:41,758 --> 01:18:45,303
And when he does,
the boy will be in terrible danger.

664
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:48,849
He has her eyes.

665
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:55,480
If you truly loved her...

666
01:18:58,191 --> 01:19:02,028
No one can know.

667
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:04,698
<i>That I should never reveal
the best of you, Severus?</i>

668
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:05,907
<i>Your word.</i>

669
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:08,994
<i>When you risk your life
every day to protect the boy?</i>

670
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:12,706
<i>He possesses no measurable talent,
his arrogance rivals that of his father...</i>

671
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:14,750
<i>...and he seems to relish his fame.</i>

672
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,794
<i>Don't say a word against my father.</i>

673
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:20,172
<i>James Potter?</i>

674
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:21,840
<i>Lazy, arrogant.</i>

675
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,341
<i>My father was a great man.</i>

676
01:19:23,508 --> 01:19:25,385
Your father was a swine!

677
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:28,889
<i>Drink the rest.</i>

678
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:33,101
It will contain the curse to your hand
for the time being.

679
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,187
It will spread, Albus.

680
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:37,063
How long?

681
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,525
Maybe a year.

682
01:19:42,694 --> 01:19:43,862
Don't ignore me, Severus.

683
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:45,530
<i>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</i>

684
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:49,701
We both know Lord Voldemort
has ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me.

685
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:55,999
<i>But should he fail,
one should presume the Dark Lord...</i>

686
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:58,293
...will turn to you.

687
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:04,966
You must be the one to kill me, Severus.

688
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:07,302
It is the only way.

689
01:20:08,261 --> 01:20:12,641
Only then will the Dark Lord
trust you completely.

690
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,477
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

691
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:23,652
<i>There will come a time
when Harry Potter must be told something.</i>

692
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:30,408
But you must wait until Voldemort
is at his most vulnerable.

693
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:33,495
Must be told what?

694
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,705
<i>On the night Lord Voldemort...</i>

695
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:39,084
<i>...went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...</i>

696
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,796
<i>...and Lily Potter cast herself
between them...</i>

697
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:45,507
<i>...the curse rebounded.</i>

698
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:50,929
When that happened,
a part of Voldemort's soul...

699
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:55,934
...latched itself onto the only living thing
it could find:

700
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,270
<i>Harry himself.</i>

701
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:03,024
<i>There's a reason Harry can speak
with snakes.</i>

702
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:06,444
<i>There's a reason he can look into
Lord Voldemort's mind.</i>

703
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:14,870
A part of Voldemort lives inside him.

704
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:24,254
So when the time comes...

705
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,299
...the boy must die?

706
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:31,261
Yes. Yes.

707
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:33,680
<i>He must die.</i>

708
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:56,828
You've kept him alive
so that he can die at the proper moment.

709
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:03,084
<i>You've been raising him
like a pig for slaughter.</i>

710
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:08,673
Don't tell me now that you've grown
to care for the boy?

711
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,431
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

712
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:28,860
Lily.

713
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:34,115
<i>After all this time?</i>

714
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:39,037
Always.

715
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:48,171
<i>So when the time comes...</i>

716
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:51,341
<i>...the boy must die?</i>

717
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:54,886
Yes. He must die.

718
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:58,056
And Voldemort himself must do it.

719
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:00,684
That is essential.

720
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:06,791
Where've you been?

721
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:10,128
- We thought you went to the forest.
- I'm going there now.

722
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:13,256
Are you mad? No.

723
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:16,468
You can't give yourself up to him.

724
01:24:19,804 --> 01:24:21,723
What is it, Harry?

725
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:25,185
What is it you know?

726
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:30,565
There's a reason I can hear them...

727
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:32,400
...the Horcruxes.

728
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:37,280
I think I've known for a while.

729
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:40,992
And I think you have too.

730
01:24:43,953 --> 01:24:47,123
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.

731
01:24:47,832 --> 01:24:50,001
Kill the snake and then it's just him.

732
01:26:10,206 --> 01:26:12,250
I'm ready to die.

733
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:55,960
The Resurrection Stone.

734
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:29,035
You've been so brave, sweetheart.

735
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:34,999
Why are you here?

736
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,585
All of you?

737
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,131
We never left.

738
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:52,600
Does it--?

739
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:54,519
Does it hurt?

740
01:27:55,561 --> 01:27:57,271
Dying?

741
01:27:58,189 --> 01:28:00,733
Quicker than falling asleep.

742
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:06,948
You're nearly there, son.

743
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:08,324
I'm sorry.

744
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:11,995
I never wanted any of you to die for me.

745
01:28:13,579 --> 01:28:15,206
And, Remus, your son...

746
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:19,627
Others will tell him
what his mother and father died for.

747
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:23,256
One day, he'll understand.

748
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:36,561
You'll stay with me?

749
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:40,398
Until the end.

750
01:28:41,065 --> 01:28:43,067
And he won't be able to see you?

751
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:44,902
No.

752
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:48,781
We're here, you see.

753
01:29:03,337 --> 01:29:05,381
Stay close to me.

754
01:29:07,091 --> 01:29:09,260
Always.

755
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:27,779
No sign of him, my Lord.

756
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:45,963
I thought he would come.

757
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:30,508
Harry? No! What are you doing here?

758
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:31,968
Quiet!

759
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:45,231
Harry Potter.

760
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:51,028
The Boy Who Lived.

761
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,702
Come to die.

762
01:31:15,928 --> 01:31:17,638
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

763
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,697
You can't help. Harry...

764
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:20,576
...you wonderful boy.

765
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:24,956
You brave, brave man.

766
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,918
Let us walk.

767
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,636
Professor, what is that?

768
01:32:41,305 --> 01:32:44,350
Something beyond either of our help.

769
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:50,481
A part of Voldemort sent here to die.

770
01:32:50,856 --> 01:32:52,066
And exactly where are we?

771
01:32:53,317 --> 01:32:57,321
I was going to ask you that.
Where would you say that we are?

772
01:32:57,488 --> 01:32:59,198
Well...

773
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:01,993
...it looks like King's Cross station.

774
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:04,662
Only cleaner.

775
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:07,039
And without all the trains.

776
01:33:07,581 --> 01:33:10,334
King's Cross, is that right?

777
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:14,255
This is, as they say, your party.

778
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:18,426
I expect you now realize
that you and Voldemort...

779
01:33:18,592 --> 01:33:21,429
...have been connected by something
other than fate...

780
01:33:21,595 --> 01:33:24,640
...since that night in Godric's Hollow
all those years ago.

781
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:26,517
So it's true then, sir?

782
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:29,687
A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?

783
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:31,022
Did.

784
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:36,027
It was just destroyed many moments ago
by none other than Voldemort himself.

785
01:33:37,069 --> 01:33:41,782
You were the Horcrux
he never meant to make, Harry.

786
01:33:54,336 --> 01:33:55,880
I have to go back, haven't I?

787
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,923
Oh. That's up to you.

788
01:33:58,090 --> 01:33:59,884
I have a choice?

789
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:01,844
Oh, yes.

790
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:04,847
We're in King's Cross, you say?

791
01:34:05,931 --> 01:34:10,728
I think, if you so desired,
you'd be able to board a train.

792
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:13,481
And where would it take me?

793
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:16,901
On.

794
01:34:34,877 --> 01:34:36,962
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.

795
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:40,633
True.

796
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,594
- And the snake's still alive.
- Yes.

797
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:46,347
And I've nothing to kill it with.

798
01:34:46,889 --> 01:34:51,602
Help will always be given at Hogwarts,
Harry, to those who ask for it.

799
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:56,524
I've always prized myself
on my ability to turn a phrase.

800
01:34:57,441 --> 01:35:00,611
Words are,
in my not so humble opinion...

801
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:04,365
...our most inexhaustible
source of magic...

802
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:08,869
...capable of both inflicting injury
and remedying it.

803
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:15,417
But I would, in this case,
amend my original statement to this:

804
01:35:18,212 --> 01:35:24,385
Help will always be given at Hogwarts
to those who deserve it.

805
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:32,977
Do not pity the dead, Harry.

806
01:35:33,435 --> 01:35:35,479
Pity the living.

807
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:40,901
And, above all,
all those who live without love.

808
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:47,283
Professor, my mother's Patronus
was a doe, wasn't it?

809
01:35:48,325 --> 01:35:50,953
That's the same as Professor Snape's.

810
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:53,914
It's curious, don't you think?

811
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:59,044
Actually, if I think about it,
it doesn't seem curious at all.

812
01:36:00,754 --> 01:36:02,923
I'll be going now, Harry.

813
01:36:03,465 --> 01:36:04,800
Professor?

814
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:11,473
Is this all real?

815
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:13,976
Or is it just happening inside my head?

816
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:17,688
Of course it's happening inside
your head, Harry.

817
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:21,609
Why should that mean that it's not real?

818
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:29,825
Professor? What should I do?

819
01:36:34,538 --> 01:36:36,332
Professor?

820
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:41,003
My Lord?

821
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:43,297
My Lord, are you hurt? My Lord?

822
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:45,090
I don't need your help.

823
01:36:45,257 --> 01:36:47,968
No. Come.

824
01:36:56,685 --> 01:36:58,520
The boy.

825
01:36:58,687 --> 01:37:00,606
Is he dead?

826
01:37:14,703 --> 01:37:16,914
Is he alive?

827
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:19,250
Draco, is he alive?

828
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:47,444
Dead.

829
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:17,242
Who is that Hagrid's carrying?

830
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:19,745
Neville, who is it?

831
01:39:20,412 --> 01:39:22,915
Harry Potter...

832
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:25,542
...is dead.

833
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:27,294
No! No!

834
01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:28,837
Silence.

835
01:39:32,508 --> 01:39:33,550
Stupid girl.

836
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:39,223
Harry Potter is dead.

837
01:39:39,389 --> 01:39:44,520
From this day forth, you put your faith...

838
01:39:44,686 --> 01:39:45,729
...in me.

839
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,575
Harry Potter is dead!

840
01:40:03,413 --> 01:40:06,875
And now is the time to declare yourself.

841
01:40:08,418 --> 01:40:11,171
Come forward and join us.

842
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:14,800
Or die.

843
01:40:20,347 --> 01:40:21,390
Draco.

844
01:40:27,062 --> 01:40:28,939
Draco.

845
01:40:31,817 --> 01:40:33,735
Draco...

846
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:38,448
...come.

847
01:40:49,459 --> 01:40:52,880
Ah. Well done, Draco.

848
01:40:53,672 --> 01:40:55,549
Well done.

849
01:41:18,113 --> 01:41:20,866
Well, I must say I'd hoped for better.

850
01:41:25,287 --> 01:41:28,165
And who might you be, young man?

851
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:31,376
Neville Longbottom.

852
01:41:36,673 --> 01:41:40,385
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
find a place for you in our ranks.

853
01:41:40,552 --> 01:41:42,804
I'd like to say something.

854
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:54,691
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be fascinated
to hear what you have to say.

855
01:41:57,694 --> 01:42:00,197
- It doesn't matter Harry's gone.
- Stand down, Neville.

856
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:02,991
People die every day.

857
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:08,705
Friends, family.

858
01:42:10,749 --> 01:42:12,334
Yeah.

859
01:42:13,752 --> 01:42:15,921
We lost Harry tonight.

860
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:21,969
But he's still with us, in here.

861
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:24,888
So's Fred...

862
01:42:25,889 --> 01:42:27,683
...and Remus.

863
01:42:28,767 --> 01:42:30,102
Tonks.

864
01:42:31,436 --> 01:42:33,355
All of them.

865
01:42:34,523 --> 01:42:36,775
They didn't die in vain.

866
01:42:41,905 --> 01:42:42,990
But you will.

867
01:42:43,156 --> 01:42:45,534
- Because you're wrong.
- Ha-ha-ha.

868
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:46,576
Harry's heart did beat for us.

869
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:50,455
For all of us. This is not over!

870
01:42:54,584 --> 01:42:56,420
<i>Confringo!</i>

871
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,263
No! No, come back!

872
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:10,392
Lucius! Come back! Come back and fight!

873
01:43:10,559 --> 01:43:12,602
Come back!

874
01:43:17,649 --> 01:43:20,819
I'll lure him into the castle.
We have to kill the snake.

875
01:43:20,986 --> 01:43:22,904
- You'll need this.
- Neville!

876
01:46:16,453 --> 01:46:18,955
Not my daughter, you bitch.

877
01:46:52,447 --> 01:46:53,782
You were right...

878
01:46:55,533 --> 01:46:57,869
...when you told Snape
that wand was failing you.

879
01:46:58,036 --> 01:46:59,704
It will always fail you.

880
01:47:00,997 --> 01:47:02,582
I killed Snape.

881
01:47:02,749 --> 01:47:04,876
But what if the wand
never belonged to Snape?

882
01:47:05,043 --> 01:47:07,921
What if its allegiance was always
to someone else?

883
01:47:08,088 --> 01:47:11,299
Come on, Tom.
Let's finish this the way we started it.

884
01:47:11,758 --> 01:47:12,801
Together.

885
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:45,161
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:45,161
...

886
01:50:49,434 --> 01:50:53,771
I couldn't find my wand.
I haven't lost my wand in my entire life.

887
01:50:53,938 --> 01:50:55,940
It was lost in the folds of my gowns.

888
01:50:56,107 --> 01:50:58,902
I managed to find it
and I dispatched a few of them...

889
01:50:59,068 --> 01:51:00,320
Harry.

890
01:52:00,797 --> 01:52:04,467
Why didn't it work for him,
the Elder Wand?

891
01:52:05,468 --> 01:52:07,387
It answered to somebody else.

892
01:52:08,346 --> 01:52:11,140
When he killed Snape,
he thought the wand would become his.

893
01:52:11,307 --> 01:52:15,478
But the thing is,
the wand never belonged to Snape.

894
01:52:15,645 --> 01:52:20,149
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the astronomy tower.

895
01:52:20,316 --> 01:52:24,320
From that moment on,
the wand answered to him.

896
01:52:25,196 --> 01:52:27,031
Until...

897
01:52:27,198 --> 01:52:31,786
...the other night
when I disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.

898
01:52:31,953 --> 01:52:34,080
So that means...

899
01:52:35,623 --> 01:52:37,375
It's mine.

900
01:52:39,335 --> 01:52:39,836
What should we do with it?

901
01:52:41,879 --> 01:52:43,006
We?

902
01:52:43,381 --> 01:52:47,635
I'm just saying, that's the Elder Wand,
the most powerful wand in the world.

903
01:52:47,802 --> 01:52:51,723
With that, we'd be invincible.

904
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:16,534
Together.

905
01:55:33,843 --> 01:55:36,012
Look after each other.

906
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:56,991
- Bag?
- Yeah.

907
01:55:57,158 --> 01:55:58,201
Jumper?

908
01:55:59,869 --> 01:56:01,871
I'll miss you.

909
01:56:02,997 --> 01:56:04,707
Here they come.

910
01:56:19,889 --> 01:56:24,101
Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?

911
01:56:26,395 --> 01:56:28,940
Albus Severus Potter...

912
01:56:30,233 --> 01:56:33,945
...you were named after two headmasters
of Hogwarts.

913
01:56:34,111 --> 01:56:35,738
One of them was a Slytherin...

914
01:56:35,905 --> 01:56:39,116
...and he was the bravest man
I've ever known.

915
01:56:40,993 --> 01:56:42,245
But just say that I am.

916
01:56:42,411 --> 01:56:48,042
Then Slytherin House will have gained
a wonderful young wizard.

917
01:56:48,209 --> 01:56:53,923
But, listen, if it really means that much
to you, you can choose Gryffindor.

918
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:57,009
The Sorting Hat
takes your choice into account.

919
01:56:57,593 --> 01:56:59,637
- Really?
- Really.

920
01:57:01,013 --> 01:57:03,683
- Bye, Mum.
- All aboard.

921
01:57:03,849 --> 01:57:04,892
Ready?

922
01:57:05,059 --> 01:57:06,602
Ready.

923
01:57:18,864 --> 01:57:20,491
Come on, Jay, get a move on.

924
01:57:20,658 --> 01:57:22,118
Come on.
