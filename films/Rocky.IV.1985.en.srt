1
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,780
A sharp left hand...

2
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,125
Come on! Come on!

3
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,920
Again! Again!

4
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,171
He's getting killed!

5
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:50,216
Oh, no, no, he's not getting killed, he's getting mad!

6
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,718
Come on, the whole world's watching!

7
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:53,302
Come on, knock me out!

8
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,517
Risin' up

9
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,601
Back on the street

10
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,103
No!

11
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,857
Did my time, took my chances

12
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:10,403
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet

13
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,321
Again! Come on, champ, you ain't so bad!

14
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:14,782
Rocky!

15
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,410
So many times

16
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,871
It happens too fast

17
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,540
You trade your passion for glory

18
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,250
Come on! Come on!

19
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,087
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past

20
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,423
Come on! Come on!

21
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:36,721
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight

22
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,933
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival

23
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:46,272
...five, six, seven,

24
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,983
eight, nine, ten.

25
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,318
You're out!

26
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:54,989
I can't believe we're doing this.

27
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,741
Come on, come on, we made a deal.

28
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,826
I know, but this is extremely crazy.

29
00:01:58,911 --> 00:01:59,952
Yeah, it's mentally irregular, right?

30
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,037
Yeah.

31
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,497
But it makes all the sense in the world.

32
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,956
You owe me a favor.

33
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,918
I know, but when did you think of this?

34
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,586
About three years ago.

35
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,630
Oh, this is very crazy, Apollo.

36
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,633
Look, Stallion. Look, when you won that last fight,

37
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,802
you won by one second, you beat me by one second.

38
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,429
One second, that's very hard for a man of my intelligence to handle.

39
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,306
Oh, is it? But didn't you say after I beat you,

40
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,099
you learned how to live with it?

41
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,142
I lied.

42
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,310
Oh, you lied!

43
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,730
Oh, so now you've just got to prove it to yourself, right?

44
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,858
Just to myself. No TV, no newspapers, just you and me.

45
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:34,028
Nothing, just you and me. Age before beauty.

46
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,279
Anything you say, Stallion.

47
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,448
I do all the work. Okay.

48
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,325
I'll tell you, Apollo, we'd better go slow,

49
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,744
'cause you ain't as young as springtime no more.

50
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,247
I'm still young enough to whip your butt, Stallion.

51
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,290
Oh, yeah? How you gonna do that?

52
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,209
You taught me everything you know.

53
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,878
Almost everything. You've got to remember now,

54
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,756
you fight great, but I'm a great fighter.

55
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,091
You ready?

56
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,342
Oh, absolutely.

57
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,303
All right. You know, Stallion,

58
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,430
it's too bad we've gotta get old, huh?

59
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,184
Just keep punching, Apollo.

60
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,354
Wanna ring the bell?

61
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,565
All right.

62
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,275
Ding, ding.

63
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,319
Come on, Stallion.

64
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,155
Come on, come on.

65
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,534
Boy, you really move good for an older guy.

66
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,244
Looking fly.

67
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,495
Look out, now.

68
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,913
No, no, you don't want any of this.

69
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,623
Come on. Come on.

70
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,459
Maybe I'm in here with the wrong guy.

71
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,984
Dad, you're late! Mom's gonna yell at you!

72
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,570
So how ya doin'?

73
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,696
Fine.

74
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,990
Don't you think that's a little bright, don't you think?

75
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,074
A little bit?

76
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,576
Where'd you get that hat?

77
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,995
A friend gave it to me. Like it?

78
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,331
Who punched you in the eye?

79
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:09,874
Same friend.

80
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,919
That's weird. Better hurry, Dad.

81
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:16,213
You know, you're developing a very, very loud personality.

82
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,675
Don't go too fast or you're gonna get out of focus.

83
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,093
Oh, really?

84
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,018
Yo! Yo, it's about time.

85
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,853
I'm sorry I'm late.

86
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,898
Listen, why don't you go over there and get ready to eat, okay?

87
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,109
Great, you're here. Now you can stop calling him names.

88
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,778
Oh, you been callin' me names, huh?

89
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,572
Well, we wait any longer, then I'll be ready for the next birthday.

90
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:42,740
Where have you been?

91
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,241
Oh, out gettin' punched.

92
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,618
Look, why don't you bring the cake in here?

93
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,787
We can get the celebration underway.

94
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,163
Boy, am I hungry.

95
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,207
Hey, babe, why don't you get the cake? I think he'll love it.

96
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,375
We got a great surprise for you.

97
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,793
You're gonna love this cake, okay?

98
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,628
You're gonna love your present, Uncle Paulie.

99
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,630
Where is it? Let me set the mood here.

100
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,882
I've got to turn the lights down and everything.

101
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,008
Watch this.

102
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,551
Is it parked outside in the driveway?

103
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,303
Just be patient, would ya?

104
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,432
I'm so excited, in fact, I'm starting to sweat.

105
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,642
I feel like I'm getting ready to go

106
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,768
into a big fight or something.

107
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,936
Watch this.

108
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,740
Happy birthday, Paulie.

109
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,836
What the hell is this?

110
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,045
Your present.

111
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,381
Yo, I wanted a sports car for my birthday,

112
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,966
not no walking trashcan.

113
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,634
Oh, come on, he looks great here.

114
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,261
This is extremely psycho, Rocko.

115
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,471
Since you don't have any friends, we thought you'd like it.

116
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,015
Yeah, pretend you're happy, will ya?

117
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,683
It'll keep you company when you're all alone.

118
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,059
That's a great-looking guy.

119
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,686
Please make a wish.

120
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,646
It's creepy! That talks, that thing!

121
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,064
Creepy? This thing's the greatest.

122
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,858
I wish I had one of these when I was growing up.

123
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,526
Go on, make a wish, like he says.

124
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,528
I wish I wasn't in this nightmare.

125
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,032
Hey, very classy wish. Very nice. What do you think there?

126
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,159
Very good, huh?

127
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,369
You wanna help me put out this forest fire?

128
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,454
Sure.

129
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:16,125
On the count of three. One, two, three!

130
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,756
Well, they're out!

131
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,965
You drowneded me!

132
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,176
Oh, don't worry.

133
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,803
I'll clean it up for you, Paulie.

134
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:32,767
Ta-da.

135
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,894
Rocky.

136
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,228
You noticed.

137
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,605
What are you doing with that cake?

138
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,691
Well, the party ain't over yet, you know?

139
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,987
Still gotta celebrate some more. It's a special night.

140
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,530
Yeah, it's Wednesday.

141
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,700
It's definitely Wednesday, but in case you forgot,

142
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:52,244
it's almost been nine years since you been married to me,

143
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,039
so here's your prize.

144
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,084
Oh, but our anniversary's a week away.

145
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,336
That's true, but why wait?

146
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,755
Has it been that rough?

147
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,673
Oh, no.

148
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,343
I'll tell you, it's been excellent, really.

149
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,636
Open your prize. Go on.

150
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,804
Go on, open your prize.

151
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:10,930
Okay.

152
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,518
You like it?

153
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:16,769
It's beautiful.

154
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,145
All right!

155
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,025
I was so nervous. I didn't know. I hope you like it.

156
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,444
The guy I bought it from says,

157
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,824
"Even if it looks like a snake, don't worry, 'cause it won't bite you. "

158
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,701
Oh, it's beautiful.

159
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,372
You know what's amazing?

160
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,709
That after all these years, everything still seems kind of new.

161
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,548
You remember a long time ago, I told you that...

162
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,801
I said that you ain't never gettin' rid of me?

163
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,344
Remember that?

164
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,639
Well, you're not.

165
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,475
You're never gettin' rid of me.

166
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,772
Happy almost anniversary.

167
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,289
Could you answer a few questions, please?

168
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,623
How long are you here for?

169
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,833
We talk later, please.

170
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,418
When are you gonna fight, Drago?

171
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,128
We talk later. Let's go.

172
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:28,132
Is it definite the Soviet Union will enter professional boxing?

173
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,427
Please, no more talk now. We will talk at press conference.

174
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,220
Do you know where it's gonna be held?

175
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:34,388
We talk later, please.

176
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,861
Today may have proved to be a landmark in sports history.

177
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,821
After unraveling years of red tape,

178
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,324
Russia will now throw its hat into the ring.

179
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,700
The prize ring, that is.

180
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,578
The introductions were made by his wife, Ludmilla Vobet Drago.

181
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,663
She was she double gold medalist in swimming.

182
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:03,667
Today, the Soviet Union has officially entered professional boxing.

183
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:08,297
My husband and great undefeated heavyweight world amateur champion,

184
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,090
Captain Ivan Drago,

185
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,301
has come here with his trainers to America

186
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,887
to compete as an international sportsman

187
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,931
and ambassador of goodwill.

188
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,433
Has Drago ever boxed against a real professional?

189
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,185
From having been trained in Russia

190
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,687
by great boxing coach Manuel Vega,

191
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,398
and now by Sergei Rimsky,

192
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,567
we hope he's qualified to do so.

193
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:29,735
Hope?

194
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,489
Well, I know he is, but I don't want to sound too confident.

195
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,784
If possible, we would like to have an exhibition bout

196
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,119
with your famous champion Rocky Balboa.

197
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,663
What makes you think he can stand the pressure

198
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,748
of fighting someone as seasoned as Balboa?

199
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,417
There is no one who can match his strength, his endurance,

200
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,961
or his aggressiveness.

201
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,421
You make it sound like he's indestructible.

202
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,298
Yes, he is.

203
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,259
Well, can this mammoth Russian,

204
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,636
who's already been nicknamed the Siberian Express,

205
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,597
wreak havoc among the professional heavyweight ranks?

206
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,767
Whoever he fights first, it'll be one hot ticket.

207
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,644
We'll be right back with a check on

208
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,729
today's pro football sports scoreboard.

209
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,233
Dad, when can I learn to fight?

210
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,193
I can't hear you. What?

211
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,279
I want to learn to fight!

212
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,323
Yo, could you turn your robot down?

213
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,869
You see, I fight so you don't have to fight,

214
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,913
'cause I want you to use your head for something

215
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,541
instead of a punching bag, like I do.

216
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,085
Your head doesn't look like a punching bag.

217
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,089
No? That's nice. Thanks a lot.

218
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,924
It looks like a catcher's mitt.

219
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:35,718
Oh!

220
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,511
Oh, a wise guy, huh?

221
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,222
Mr. Balboa, Mr. Creed's on the phone.

222
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,099
Yeah? I'll be right there.

223
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,892
You can get it right here.

224
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,686
Hope it's not another rematch.

225
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,856
Oh, don't worry about it. Okay. Hello?

226
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,524
Yeah, Apollo! Hey, turn that down.

227
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,359
Yeah, Apollo, how you doin'?

228
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,695
Yeah? You comin' out?

229
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,113
That's great.

230
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,408
What am I doin'? I'm just gettin' dizzy.

231
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,955
My husband and I thank you

232
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,416
for coming to our training quarter today.

233
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,710
As you can see, it is highly advanced,

234
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,004
and we wish to show the American press

235
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,466
a small portion of the advances our country's made

236
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,801
in the technology of human performance.

237
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:21,221
Coach Rimsky, what does all this do to enhance performance?

238
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,223
Well... If I may answer.

239
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,019
It makes a man a better man,

240
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,563
a great athlete, a super athlete

241
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,232
by harnessing all his strength.

242
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,194
Though most of the world is ignorant in body chemistry,

243
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,739
we wish to educate your country.

244
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,532
There have been rumors of blood doping

245
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:44,370
and widespread distribution of anabolic steroids in the Soviet Union.

246
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,789
Has Drago partaken in any such experiments?

247
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,208
No, no. Ivan is naturally trained.

248
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,711
Then how do you explain his freakish strength?

249
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,923
Like your Popeye, he ate his spinach every day.

250
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,886
Shall we have a demonstration?

251
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,596
Please do. Thank you.

252
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,515
A normal heavyweight

253
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:08,644
averages 700 pounds of pressure per square inch.

254
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:24,159
As you can see, Drago averages 1,850 pounds,

255
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,662
so the result's quite obvious.

256
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,122
And what results are those?

257
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,250
Whatever he hits, he destroys.

258
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,337
I've seen this Drago fight when he was an amateur.

259
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,256
He's big and he's strong, but he's clumsy.

260
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,133
I know I can beat him.

261
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,510
Why do you want to fight again?

262
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,388
Let's just say it's something I believe in.

263
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,432
You can do your homework.

264
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,933
Okay. Later, Dad.

265
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,977
Later, Uncle Paulie. Later, Apollo.

266
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,186
Later, big guy.

267
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,479
See you later, kiddo.

268
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:56,942
Yo, don't you think people are expecting to see Rocky whack this bum out first?

269
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,903
Yeah, yeah, and he will, when it's for real.

270
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,322
This is just an exhibition bout. It's kids' stuff.

271
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,740
What's the purpose?

272
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:07,244
I mean, what at this point in your life is worth getting hurt for?

273
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,375
What the hell is that?

274
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,043
That's my girl.

275
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,050
Thanks, honey.

276
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,802
You're welcome.

277
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:24,970
That's a nice song.

278
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,140
It's my favorite. You're the greatest.

279
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,850
See you, sport.

280
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,977
See you.

281
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,730
Yo, Paulie, who taught it to talk like that?

282
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,190
She loves me.

283
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,483
Oh!

284
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,364
Like I was saying,

285
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,076
I don't want this chump to come over here with all that hype, you know,

286
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,828
trying to make us look bad.

287
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,497
They try every other way.

288
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,290
With Rock's help, we can get great media coverage.

289
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,667
We can make them look bad for a change.

290
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,169
I think it's wrong.

291
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,254
No, it's never been more right.

292
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,923
You're a great fighter,

293
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,591
but you've been retired for nearly five years.

294
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,511
Don't you think it's time to start thinking about something else?

295
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,722
I mean, how much can you take? Either of you?

296
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,977
I'll get the coffee.

297
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,815
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

298
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,944
I just care about you both. I...

299
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,034
You ever try these comics?

300
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,162
No, no.

301
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,081
Keeps your fertility.

302
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,958
Hey, Paulie.

303
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,169
The ring now. Rocky's holding that right hand up.

304
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,129
He's fighting right-handed! I don't believe it!

305
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,215
Now, this was a great fight.

306
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,051
Yeah, great. I'm gettin' punchy just watching it. Look at this!

307
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,845
Mamma mia! What you using for a chin there, Stallion?

308
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:51,974
I should have slipped that one.

309
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,768
Yeah, you definitely should have slipped that one.

310
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,020
Ain't it something, Stallion?

311
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,731
It's crazy how people, they just care about you when you're in that ring

312
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:00,899
and they care about you when you're bleeding,

313
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,734
but once you step out of that ring, Stallion,

314
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,986
it's like you're ancient history.

315
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,904
Oh, go on. It ain't ancient history, you know.

316
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,740
I don't see anybody asking for autographs, do you? Huh?

317
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,870
Hey, Apollo, can I ask you something?

318
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,581
What?

319
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,001
Well, you know, this fight you're having against the Russian...

320
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,713
Do you think maybe it ain't against him?

321
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,466
If it's not him, Stallion, then who's it against?

322
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,138
Well, do you think maybe it's, like, you against you?

323
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,889
What do you think?

324
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,933
You know, I think you really are getting brain damaged,

325
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,351
that's what I think, Stallion.

326
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:40,188
Maybe. But, really, I'm speaking the truth here, Apollo.

327
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,857
Are you? Yeah.

328
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,611
I don't think I want to hear this, Stallion.

329
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,321
Oh, come on. Hey, Apollo, look,

330
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,281
you were a great fighter, no doubt about that,

331
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,284
but, look, we gotta face the facts, too.

332
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,120
You don't want to believe it, but maybe the show is over.

333
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,290
Man, that's easy for you to say. You're still on top.

334
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,335
But what happens when you're not on top? Then what, huh?

335
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,211
Where do we go, Stallion?

336
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,380
'Cause we sure as hell can't be born again.

337
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,257
No, I know, we can't be born again,

338
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:10,302
but, you know, let's face it, we gotta change sometime.

339
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,971
I don't want to change, man. I like who I am.

340
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,807
I like who you are, too, but look at that, you know?

341
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,059
You don't want to believe this,

342
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,894
but that ain't us up there no more, Apollo.

343
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,979
We can't do that the way we did it before.

344
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:25,734
We're changing. We're, like, turning into regular people.

345
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,862
No, Stallion, maybe you think you're changing,

346
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,156
but you can't change what you really are.

347
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,242
And you can forget all this money and stuff you got all around you, man,

348
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,578
'cause it don't change a thing.

349
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:40,290
You and me, we don't even have a choice.

350
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,250
See, we're born with a killer instinct

351
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,796
that you can't just turn off and on like some radio.

352
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,507
We have to be right in the middle of the action

353
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,300
'cause we're the warriors.

354
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,927
And without some challenge,

355
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,428
without some damn war to fight,

356
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,098
then the warrior may as well be dead, Stallion.

357
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,687
So I'm asking you,

358
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,856
as a friend,

359
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,446
stand by my side this one last time.

360
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,285
You're a great talker, Apollo.

361
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,375
All right, but when this is over...

362
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,004
You know me, Stallion.

363
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,841
I always think of something else.

364
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,759
That's what I'm afraid of.

365
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,262
All right, you've got a deal there.

366
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,515
I feel sorry for that guy, you know?

367
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:43,061
Apollo, what made you decide to put on an exhibition fight with Drago?

368
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,480
Oh, let's call it a sense of responsibility.

369
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,941
Responsibility how?

370
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,193
I had to teach this young fellow to box, American style.

371
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:55,115
Apollo, isn't Drago a little inexperienced to be in the same ring?

372
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,702
Well, you know, some folks got to learn the hard way!

373
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,371
So, no quick knockout prediction?

374
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,331
No, no, no. I'm not angry with him.

375
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,250
See, I just want to show the whole world

376
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,420
that Russia doesn't have all the best athletes.

377
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,506
Rocky, how do you think Apollo should fight Drago?

378
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,383
Well, personally,

379
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:16,428
I think the first thing you'd better get Apollo is a ladder.

380
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:22,225
Drago, how does it feel to spar with the great former champion?

381
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,146
The man's tongue didn't come through customs.

382
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,444
My husband is very happy to have this opportunity.

383
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,904
It's his dream.

384
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,572
Dream? How do you mean?

385
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,282
In our country, Apollo Creed

386
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,493
is well known and very respected.

387
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,119
It could be a good victory.

388
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,331
Hey, wait a minute, now. Wait a minute. Hold it.

389
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,540
Win?

390
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,169
You don't really think you gonna whip me, do you?

391
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,837
Well, he didn't come here to lose.

392
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,089
You hold on, little lady, you hold on,

393
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,717
'cause lose, and lose royally, he's gonna do.

394
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,010
How can you be so sure?

395
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,429
Well, I been with the best, and I've beat the best.

396
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,224
I've retired more men than Social Security!

397
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,892
Excuse, please.

398
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,436
You are not very realistic, are you, Mr. Creed?

399
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,563
Where did you come from? What are you talking about?

400
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,899
You can box, yes, but you are far too old

401
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,526
to think that you can win over Drago.

402
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,693
Is that a fact?

403
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,987
Yes! And it could be a painful one.

404
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,323
You put that heavy bag with eyeballs in the ring with me,

405
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,825
and you're gonna see the meaning of pain.

406
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,284
Why do you insult us?

407
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,496
Now, you just hold on here. Don't make me out to be the bad guy.

408
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,665
I came here to talk about a friendly exhibition bout

409
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,625
till Comrade Big Mouth started up.

410
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,794
It is you who are the aggressor. This is obvious.

411
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,839
I wish to say to the press, in all fairness,

412
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,674
Drago should not even fight this man,

413
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,509
because he is a has-been.

414
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,178
You get that big chump in the ring right now,

415
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,639
and I'm gonna show you what I have.

416
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,599
Break something! Bring it on!

417
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,811
I don't want to hear anything about hurt. Just let that chump go.

418
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,233
All right, all right, all right.

419
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,527
All right, I said what I feel.

420
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,695
We're gonna finish this in the ring.

421
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,488
You understand? We're gonna finish this in the ring.

422
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,991
Look, you just shut up, and all these puppets that you brought with you.

423
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,285
You history, chump! You history!

424
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,704
How did I do? Little loud for my taste.

425
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,746
But good?

426
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,039
Oh, yeah, very good.

427
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,214
Welcome, one and all, to the city of lights, Las Vegas,

428
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:19,050
and to one of the most unusual events in years,

429
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,719
East meets West,

430
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:24,222
age versus youth in a goodwill exhibition match

431
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:27,225
as the former champion Apollo Creed takes on

432
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,519
a mountain of muscle from the Soviet Union,

433
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:31,021
Ivan Drago.

434
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,398
Come on, man. Patience is a virtue, you know?

435
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,317
I'm ready to rock 'n' roll, and you want to talk patience!

436
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,736
I understand, but you gotta get your equipment here.

437
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,405
There you go. Now you look like a mummy.

438
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,324
I feel like a mummy, too. How does it feel? Okay?

439
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,910
Feels great. I feel like I could eat nails, Stallion.

440
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,037
You know, I never tried them things.

441
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,496
What are you talking about?

442
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,248
Snails. I never had 'em, you know.

443
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,250
I've seen 'em in the garden, but I never wanted to eat 'em.

444
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,127
I didn't say anything about snails.

445
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,880
I said nails. Nails, Stallion.

446
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,423
Okay. Nails, yeah.

447
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,885
Well, you look pretty good, but, you know, just do me a favor.

448
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:06,514
When you go up there, Apollo, try not to wear yourself out, okay?

449
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,725
Yeah. Wear myself out. Sure.

450
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,020
Well, it's just that you ain't been in the ring for, like, five years,

451
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,189
so I just want you to maintain a little bit.

452
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,941
What are you talking about? You sound like I'm an old man.

453
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,777
I'm in the best shape of my life. I'm stronger, I'm quicker.

454
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,529
Well, hey, hey, I'm not saying you're not ready or anything,

455
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,115
but personally, if it were me,

456
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,202
I wouldn't mind postponing a couple of weeks.

457
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:28,703
Postpone?

458
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,455
Yeah. I mean, come on, Apollo,

459
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,042
we don't know anything about this guy you're fighting, really.

460
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,629
Look, okay, okay, let's say I postpone, right?

461
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,298
I pull out, somebody else steps in and whips this chump,

462
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,675
then where does that leave me?

463
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,968
What do you mean "leave" you, Apollo?

464
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,804
It's just some kind of exhibition fight. This thing don't mean nothing.

465
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,223
No, no, no, man. That's where you're wrong.

466
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,643
This is not just an exhibition fight that doesn't mean anything.

467
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,397
Look, this is us against them. What are you talking about? Come on.

468
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,899
Stallion,

469
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,861
maybe you don't know what I'm talking about now,

470
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,073
but you will when it's over.

471
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,369
Believe me, you will when it's over.

472
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,922
Ivan!

473
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,204
Good luck. I hope after we can be friends.

474
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,706
I hope so.

475
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,917
Of course, they're sportsmen, not soldiers.

476
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,048
Enjoy the fight.

477
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,651
Ow!

478
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,035
Knock me out, hit it

479
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,543
Hit it

480
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,135
Hit it

481
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,346
Whoo

482
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,851
Whoo

483
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,520
Super highways

484
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,355
Coast to coast

485
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,733
Easy to get anywhere

486
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,195
On the transcontinental

487
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,030
Overload

488
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,574
Just slide behind the wheel

489
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,159
How does it feel?

490
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,537
When there's no destination

491
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,330
That's too far

492
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,499
And somewhere on the way

493
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,502
You might find out who you are

494
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,754
Living in America

495
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,049
Eye to eye

496
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,552
Station to station

497
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,304
Living in America

498
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,516
Hand to hand

499
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,434
Across the nation

500
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,688
Living in America

501
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,608
Got to have a celebration

502
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:51,364
You may not be lookin' for the promised land

503
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,325
But you might find it anyway

504
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,664
Under one of those old familiar names

505
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,999
Like New Orleans

506
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,250
New Orleans

507
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,460
Detroit City

508
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,588
Dallas Dallas

509
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,715
Pittsburgh, PA Pittsburgh, PA

510
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,800
New York City New York City

511

Kansas City Kansas City

Atlanta Atlanta

513
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,681
Chicago and LA

514
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:20,727
I live in America

515
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,770
Head to head

516
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,981
Toe to toe

517
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:29,277
Sing, I live in America

518
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,822
Say it loud It'll make you proud

519
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,660
I live in America

520
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,287
Hey

521
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,915
I know what it means

522
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,542
Living in America

523
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:45,793
Got it made

524
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,630
I said now eye to eye Tooth to tooth

525
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,216
This is the undisputed truth

526
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,842
Living in America

527
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,469
Yeah

528
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:58,640
All the way with your bad self

529
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,517
Living in America

530
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:02,810
Yeah

531
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,312
I feel good!

532
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,872
Good evening, everyone.

533
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,666
Along with Warner Wolf, I'm Stu Nahan,

534
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,751
and we welcome you to a most unusual event.

535
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,755
For the first time ever, West against East in professional sports.

536
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,340
Thanks for getting me here, Stallion.

537
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,424
I owe you one, okay?

538
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:34,926
Oh, no, no. We're even.

539
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,678
God, I feel born again.

540
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,889
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

541
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:44,060
I would like to announce the presence of a true fighting champion

542
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,771
that defines the word courage.

543
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,733
The Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa.

544
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:54,445
Excuse me, would you?

545
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,114
Oh, certainly.

546
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,533
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

547
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,826
Rocky!

548
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:08,501
Tonight's special event features two great athletes.

549
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:12,547
In the blue corner, weighing 221 pounds,

550
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,758
a former heavyweight champion of the world,

551
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,636
the Dancing Destroyer,

552
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,014
the King of Sting,

553
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,641
the Count of Monte Fisto...

554
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,310
Yo, you think you got enough names?

555
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,978
Patience, Stallion. Almost done.

556
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:32,233
...the Master of Disaster, the one and only Apollo Creed!

557
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:38,990
The crowd anticipating a great fight now as Apollo is in the ring.

558
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,908
He's playing to the crowd.

559
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:49,709
In the red corner, weighing an even 261 pounds,

560
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:54,589
gold medalist and undefeated world amateur champion

561
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,632
from the Soviet Union,

562
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,969
the Siberian Bull,

563
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,764
Ivan Drago.

564
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,189
I want you! I want you! I want you!

565
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,191
Now the two fighters come to the center of the ring

566
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,027
for the instructions from referee Lou Filippo.

567
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,612
You boys know the rules.

568
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,573
Watch your low blows, kidney punches, rabbit punches.

569
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,534
In case of a knockdown, you go to the corner I tell you to

570
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,536
and you stay there until I tell you to come out.

571
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,372
Shake hands. Let's have a good fight.

572
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,083
All right, it's time to go to school, son.

573
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,793
Come on, get your hands up, man!

574
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,213
You need an interpreter? It's time to go to school!

575
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,256
You will lose.

576
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,885
Why don't you land him on his head?

577
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,053
All right.

578
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,306
The bad blood between these two can be felt all over this arena.

579
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,517
I can't get over the size of this Russian.

580
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,061
Apollo! Apollo! Apollo!

581
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,896
Get ready, 'cause it's show time!

582
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,732
It's show time! It's show time!

583
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,859
Excuse me, didn't you forget something?

584
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,277
Huh. Come on.

585
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:01,072
And Apollo seems to be in great spirits tonight.

586
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,200
He's really putting on a show for this capacity crowd.

587
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,120
Be back in a minute, all right?

588
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,164
Round one.

589
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,793
Creed dancing around.

590
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,753
Creed backpedaling now. He's been away five years...

591
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:18,506
Don't wait on him. Get on first.

592
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:24,345
Come on! He may be big enough, but you are mean!

593
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,473
Come on. Come on, chump. Come on.

594
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:28,933
Neither fighter ready to throw a punch.

595
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,854
A left jab there. A left jab once again by Creed.

596
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,817
And a slip! A slip by Creed.

597
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,444
This is bizarre.

598
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,112
Creed is over the hill,

599
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,656
and the Russian hasn't fought anybody.

600
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,540
Keep him bottled! Keep your chin down!

601
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,584
Keep moving, Apollo! Stick him!

602
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:55,960
Drago moving in again.

603
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,087
A left hand by Creed, another left hand by Creed,

604
00:29:58,172 --> 00:29:59,881
and Drago moves away.

605
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,382
All right, come on!

606
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,470
Get your hands up! Get your hands up!

607
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,640
Another left hand by Creed!

608
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,768
Drago waiting, waiting, cocking that right hand.

609
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:17,565
Ooh! A crushing right by the Russian!

610
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,151
Get out of there! Stay away from him!

611
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,277
Get out of there!

612
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,696
And a left hand. He's taking some punishment now!

613
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,615
Drago moves him against the ropes.

614
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:26,991
Tie him up now!

615
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,326
Left hand ties him up.

616
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,828
And now the Russian throws Creed across the ring.

617
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:31,913
Move!

618
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:32,997
He comes in with more punishment.

619
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,707
It is Drago with the upper hand now,

620
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,334
Drago with the left to the midsection.

621
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,668
Get out of that corner!

622
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,962
...with the right hand. Another right. Another right.

623
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,005
Another right hand thrown by Drago.

624
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,634
Can Creed stay up?

625
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,427
Creed... Creed is against the ropes.

626
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,513
What's the matter with you guys?

627
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:53,017
What are you guys doing? This is supposed to be an exhibition!

628
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,186
You understand? An exhibition!

629
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,272
A tremendous end to the first round by the Russian,

630
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,108
and a very bloody Apollo Creed.

631
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,780
The Soviet's strength is incredible!

632
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,573
Champ, look, I gotta stop it.

633
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,867
This fight's finished. I gotta call it.

634
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,869
Look, champ, you can't do no more out there.

635
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:12,995
I'm here to fight him.

636
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,206
He's killin' ya. I gotta stop this thing.

637
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,167
I'm here to fight. Promise me you're not gonna stop this fight.

638
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:21,879
Boy, I'll you something, that was a pulverizing round for the ex-champion.

639
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:25,383
Hey, folks, Ivan Drago is definitely for real.

640
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,218
Apollo! Apollo!

641
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,845
You don't stop this fight, no matter what.

642
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:35,142
Apollo! Apollo! Apollo!

643
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,186
No matter what.

644
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:44,151
Apollo! Apollo! Apollo! Apollo!

645
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,739
Creed now comes out for round two, dancing around.

646
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,742
The legs appear to be still a little rubbery.

647
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,412
Get your hands up. Get your hands up.

648
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,498
And now it is the Russian just standing there,

649
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,959
the Russian trying to intimidate Creed.

650
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,753
And the Russian throws a right hand and staggers Creed!

651
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:06,007
Another right to the jaw! Another right to the head!

652
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,592
Get out of that corner!

653
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,760
Get out of the corner!

654
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,140
Creed is being pounded without mercy.

655
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:15,766
Stop the fight!

656
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,226
The referee tries to step in,

657
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:18,769
and he's thrown across the ring.

658
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,188
Throw the towel! Throw the towel!

659
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:23,691
No!

660
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,360
I've never seen Apollo take so much punishment!

661
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,778
Throw the damn towel!

662
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,196
No!

663
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,870
No!

664
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,633
My God!

665
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,509
Creed is down!

666
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,639
Apollo is down, and he could be badly hurt.

667
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,057
Let him breathe!

668
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,975
Move back! Get these guys out of here.

669
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,977
The winner, Ivan Drago.

670
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,480
Let me through! Apollo!

671
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,315
I cannot be defeated.

672
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,399
Is he okay?

673
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,692
Somebody get a doctor in here!

674
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,319
There is no movement by Creed.

675
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,570
Get that light off him!

676
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,113
I defeat all man.

677
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:13,032
Is he dead? Get out of here.

678
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,368
It's absolute pandemonium.

679
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,577
Stand back.

680
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,163
Let him breathe! Come on, Apollo, you can do it.

681
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,333
Soon I defeat real champion.

682
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,501
Where's the stretcher?

683
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,627
Somebody send for a doctor. Is he dead?

684
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,087
Let him breathe, for God's sake!

685
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,548
What started out as a joke has turned out to be a disaster.

686
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,009
Creed appears to be in very serious condition.

687
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:33,177
Is the man alive?

688
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,762
You can make it. You can make it, Apollo.

689
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,889
If he dies, he dies.

690
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,621
There's a lot I could say about this man.

691
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,625
I don't know if it matters now.

692
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,964
I guess what matters is what he stood for,

693
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,843
what he lived for,

694
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,596
and what he died for.

695
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,518
You always did everything

696
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,355
the way you wanted it.

697
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,194
I know I didn't understand that, but...

698
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,828
Now I understand.

699
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,544
I'll never forget you, Apollo.

700
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,355
You're the best.

701
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,869
Rocky, is the decision final?

702
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,953
Yes.

703
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,079
Rocky, over here, please.

704
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,957
Is this the first time the champion has given up his crown?

705
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,167
I don't know about that.

706
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,628
Doesn't the title mean anything to you anymore?

707
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:31,754
Not until this is over.

708
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,132
Coach Rimsky, considering Rocky's known punching power,

709
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:37,551
do you still think this is gonna be an easy fight?

710
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,679
Yes, of course. It is a matter of science.

711
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,849
Evolution. Isn't it, gentlemen?

712
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:48,354
Drago is the most perfectly trained athlete ever.

713
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,481
This other man has not the size

714
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,526
or the endurance or the genetics to win.

715
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,238
It's physically impossible for this little man to win.

716
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,491
Drago is a look at the future.

717
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,326
Champ, there's been no mention of it yet,

718
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,954
but how much are you making for this fight?

719
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,122
No money. It's not about money.

720
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,500
Has the fight date been set yet?

721
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,584
December 25th.

722
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,794
Why Christmas?

723
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,045
That's what I was told.

724
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,505
Where?

725
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,756
It's in Russia.

726
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:16,966
Are you nuts?

727
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,050
Rocky, what's going on?

728
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,468
Why did you agree to this?

729
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:23,097
We fight in Soviet Union, or we fight nowhere.

730
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,350
Why don't you ask Drago's wife why she is afraid?

731
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,518
Tell them, please.

732
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,520
I'm afraid for my husband's life.

733
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,355
We have threats of violence everywhere.

734
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,276
We are not in politics.

735
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,446
All I want is for my husband to be safe, to be treated fairly.

736
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,365
You call him a killer.

737
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,535
He's a professional fighter, not a killer.

738
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,954
You have this belief that you are better than us.

739
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,332
You have this belief that this country is so very good

740
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,126
and we are so very bad.

741
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,837
You have this belief that you are so fair

742
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,213
and we are so very cruel.

743
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:58,465
It is all lies and false propaganda

744
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,970
to support this antagonistic and violent government!

745
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,638
Oh, violent?

746
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:08,058
Hey, we don't keep our people behind a wall with machine guns!

747
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,310
Who are you?

748
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,644
Who am I?

749
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,355
I'm the unsilent majority, big mouth!

750
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,609
Good! Yes, good! Insult us!

751
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:20,571
Is more typical rude behavior toward visiting foreigners.

752
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,907
But perhaps this simple defeat

753
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,367
of this little so-called champion

754
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:29,038
will be a perfect example of how pathetically weak

755
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,165
your society has become!

756
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,499
We go!

757
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:35,878
Rocky, over here.

758
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,047
Rocky, can you tell us about a...

759
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:44,178
Mrs. Balboa! Mrs. Balboa!

760
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,763
How do you feel about going to Russia?

761
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,389
Is your husband going to Moscow?

762
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:50,434
Mrs. Balboa, how does it feel to be part of such a controversial decision?

763
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,727
Mrs. Balboa!

764
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,937
Adrian! Adrian!

765
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,439
Mrs. Balboa, did Creed's death make up your husband's mind?

766
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,149
I don't know what you're talking about!

767
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,193
One more question! Why is he going at Christmas?

768
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,403
Was it his decision?

769
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,113
When will you be going to Russia?

770
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:06,617
Look, I'm not going to Russia. I don't know what you're talking about.

771
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,245
I don't know why you're here. I don't know what you people are doing here!

772
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,122
Mrs. Balboa! Was it his decision?

773
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,691
Rocky?

774
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:40,109
Yeah?

775
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,864
You all right?

776
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,075
Yeah. Fine.

777
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,536
Why'd you do it?

778
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,874
I just gotta do what I gotta do.

779
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,002
You don't have to do anything.

780
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:02,965
No, Adrian, I do, and...

781
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,344
I gotta leave this place, too.

782
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,430
So where are you going?

783
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:13,058
They said they're going to let me train in Russia, and...

784
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,270
I just want to go someplace where

785
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,064
I ain't gonna think about nothing except him.

786
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,233
Rocky, give it some time.

787
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:24,737
Don't do this. A lot of people live with hurt.

788
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,365
Adrian, a lot of people don't have a choice. I do.

789
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,201
And for that, you're willing to lose everything?

790
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,954
Adrian, this ain't everything.

791
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,584
This house, the cars, and all the stuff we got,

792
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,461
it ain't everything.

793
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,424
There's a lot more than this, Adrian.

794
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,177
Before, there were reasons to fight I could understand,

795
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,762
but I don't understand this.

796
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:53,140
Even if you win, what have you won? Apollo's still gone.

797
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:57,352
Why can't you change your thinking? Everybody else does!

798
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,271
'Cause I'm a fighter.

799
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,899
That's the way I'm made, Adrian.

800
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:04,401
That's what you married.

801
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,403
We can't change what we are.

802
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:07,988
Yes, you can.

803
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,656
You can't change anything, Adrian.

804
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,451
All we can do is just go with what we are.

805
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,744
You can't go with what you are.

806
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,287
Have you read the papers?

807
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,372
Do you know what everybody says?

808
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:18,999
It's suicide!

809
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,169
You've seen him. You know how strong he is.

810
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,879
You can't win!

811
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,676
Oh, Adrian.

812
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,349
Adrian always tells the truth.

813
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,560
No, maybe I can't win.

814
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,023
Maybe the only thing I can do

815
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,443
is just take everything he's got.

816
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,862
But to beat me,

817
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,698
he's going to have to kill me.

818
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,700
And to kill me,

819
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:58,038
he's gonna have to have the heart to stand in front of me.

820
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:04,128
And to do that, he's got to be willing to die himself.

821
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,257
I don't know if he's ready to do that.

822
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,300
I don't know.

823
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,430
I don't know.

824
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,689
We're not indestructible

825
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:09,484
Baby, better get that straight

826
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,530
I think it's unbelievable

827
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:16,783
How you give in to the hands of fate

828
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,746
Some things are worth fighting for

829
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,583
Some feelings never die

830
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:28,462
I'm not asking for another chance

831
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,549
I just wanna know why

832
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:36,220
There's no easy way out

833
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,224
There's no shortcut home

834
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:43,644
There's no easy way out

835
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:48,315
Giving in can't be wrong

836
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,321
I don't wanna pacify you

837
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,158
I don't wanna drag you down

838
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:01,828
But I'm feeling like a prisoner

839
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:05,791
Like a stranger in a no-name town

840
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,711
I see all the angry faces

841
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:13,340
Afraid that could be you and me

842
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:16,802
Talking about what might have been

843
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,847
I'm thinking about what it used to be

844
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,518
There's no easy way out

845
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,355
There's no shortcut home

846
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,401
There's no easy way out

847
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:37,030
Giving in can't be wrong

848
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,683
Baby, baby, we can shed this skin

849
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:08,437
We can know how we feel inside

850
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:12,316
Instead of going down an endless road

851
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,028
Not knowing if we're dead or alive

852
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:20,157
Some things are worth fighting for

853
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,660
Some feelings never die

854
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:27,581
I'm not asking for another chance

855
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:32,044
I just wanna know why

856
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:35,380
There's no easy way out

857
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,884
There's no shortcut home

858
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:43,013
There's no easy way out

859
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,725
Giving in, giving in can't be wrong

860
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,227
No, there's no easy way out

861
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:51,104
There's no easy way out

862
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:54,900
There's no shortcut home

863
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,818
There's no easy way out

864
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,112
There's no easy, no easy

865
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,115
No easy way out

866
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,787
There's no easy way out

867
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,998
There's no shortcut home

868
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,335
There's no easy, no easy

869
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,921
No easy way out

870
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:53,166
Be careful with those plaid ones. They belong to the boss.

871
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,669
Paulie, did you pack your toothbrush?

872
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,130
You know how tobacco stains your teeth.

873
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,966
If I've told you once, I've told you 1,000 times.

874
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,677
Hey, stop busting my chops.

875
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:05,720
Paulie.

876
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,348
I'm gonna have her wires tied when I get back.

877
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,394
When will you be back?

878
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,521
Oh, pretty soon.

879
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,189
Are you scared?

880
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:17,899
No.

881
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,694
Yes, you are. A little, maybe?

882
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,363
Well, wouldn't you be?

883
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:26,241
If a big, giant man wanted to beat me up,

884
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,076
I'd be real scared.

885
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:34,583
Well, the truth is, you know, sometimes

886
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,837
I do get a little scared, you know.

887
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:42,632
When I'm in that ring and I'm really getting hit on,

888
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,969
and my arms hurt so much I can't even lift 'em,

889
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:49,723
and I'm thinking, "God, I wish this guy would hit me on the chin

890
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,559
"so I don't feel nothing anymore. "

891
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,396
Then there's another side that comes out

892
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,607
that isn't so scared.

893
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,276
There's another side that, like,

894
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,529
wants to take more,

895
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:07,657
wants to go that one more round

896
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:10,327
because by going that one more round

897
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:13,121
when you don't think you can,

898
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:17,250
that's what makes all the difference in your life.

899
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,252
You know what I mean?

900
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,964
And will you remember one more thing?

901
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:27,802
Remember that Daddy thinks you're the best boy in the world.

902
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,932
And that Daddy loves you, no matter what?

903
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:43,485
I gotta go now.

904
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,404
You gonna take care of everything?

905
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:47,697
Okay.

906
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,699
And don't forget to feed your robot.

907
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:51,451
Okay.

908
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,620
Bye, baby.

909
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:56,623
Good luck.

910
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,209
Thanks.

911
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,462
Come on! The meter's running!

912
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:34,452
Two worlds collide Rival nations

913
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:36,663
It's a primitive clash

914
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,000
Venting years of frustration

915
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:43,628
Bravely we hope against all hope

916
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,464
There is so much at stake

917
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:50,927
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes

918
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:54,139
Does the crowd understand?

919
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:56,516
Is it East versus West

920
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,060
Or man against man

921
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:03,690
Can any nation stand alone

922
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,985
In the burning heart

923
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,446
Just about to burst

924
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:14,367
There's a quest for answers An unquenchable thirst

925
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,330
What a horrendous flight.

926
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,206
This is Russia?

927
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,334
Don't look so tough, Rock.

928
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,444
Mr. Balboa.

929
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,406
We take you to quarters now.

930
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:56,868
Hey, when does the sun come up?

931
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,496
This is detrimental to my sinuses.

932
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,874
Weather changes hour to hour. Get used to it.

933
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:07,629
Get in the car now. We have very long trip.

934
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,006
Sounds like Dracula's cousin.

935
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,341
Come on, Paulie.

936
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:17,597
In the warrior's code there's no surrender

937
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,850
Though his body says stop

938
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:23,687
His spirit cries "Never!"

939
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:27,857
Deep in our soul a quiet ember

940
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,402
Knows it's you against you

941
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:35,115
It's the paradox that drives us all

942
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:38,076
It's a battle of wills

943
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,203
In the heat of attack

944
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,956
It's the passion that kills

945
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,627
The victory is yours alone

946
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,964
In the burning heart

947
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,383
Just about to burst

948
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,968
There's a quest for answers

949
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,263
An unquenchable thirst

950
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,432
In the darkest night

951
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:03,268
Rising like a spire

952
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:04,728
In the burning heart

953
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,772
The unmistakable fire

954
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,153
Like you request, yes?

955
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,530
You requested this dumb location?

956
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,781
Yeah.

957
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:20,452
Why? You planning to grow reindeer or something?

958
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:23,997
I just wanted to get away from things, you know?

959
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,041
The equipment you requested is in barn.

960
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:31,796
Who are they?

961
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,047
They?

962
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,550
They are assigned to you.

963
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,470
Official chaperones, yes?

964
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:41,598
Where you go, they go.

965
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,893
Oh, I have a bad dream here.

966
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,020
Paul, it's okay.

967
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,104
It's okay?

968
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:50,523
This is below human standards.

969
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:53,276
There's no antennas. You gotta complain!

970
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,944
We'll crack out here!

971
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:58,031
You have everything I have been instructed to provide.

972
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,742
We are finished, yes?

973
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,380
No sparring?

974
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,053
I don't think I need it anymore, Paulie.

975
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,931
No sparring, no TV, nothing?

976
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,726
How the heck is he supposed to train around here?

977
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:30,063
No TV. What about the Rose Bowl game?

978
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,148
No room service, I bet.

979
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:34,359
I hope they got my comics here.

980
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:36,778
What a depressing vacation.

981
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,829
God damn.

982
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,668
All right, you chipmunks,

983
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:52,961
are you ready to sing your song?

984
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:54,712
I'll say we are.

985
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:59,217
Christmas, Christmas time is here

986
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:04,514
Time for toys and time for cheer

987
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:08,893
We've been good, but we can't last

988
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,353
Checkmate, friend.

989
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,327
Yeah?

990
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:28,204
Hey, champ, can I come up?

991
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:29,664
Yeah, sure.

992
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,127
How you doing?

993
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,420
Pretty good.

994
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:37,463
Some kind of weather we're having up here, huh?

995
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,507
Yeah, it's pretty rough.

996
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:42,010
But for what you gotta do, it's good.

997
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,305
Toughen you up.

998
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,723
I guess so.

999
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:49,893
I know you're gonna have to do almost everything alone up here,

1000
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:51,644
but you know I'll be with you.

1001
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,187
Yeah, I know.

1002
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:55,481
Apollo was like my son.

1003
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:58,484
I raised him.

1004
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:02,655
And when he died, part of me died.

1005
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:06,492
But now you're the one.

1006
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:10,246
You're the one that's gonna keep his spirit alive.

1007
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:12,290
You're the one that's gonna make sure

1008
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,334
that he didn't die for nothing.

1009
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,796
Now, you're gonna have to go through hell,

1010
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,549
worse than any nightmare that you ever dreamed.

1011
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:26,721
But in the end, I know you'll be the one standing.

1012
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,475
I'll try.

1013
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,605
I'll try.

1014
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,445
You know what you gotta do.

1015
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,949
Do it.

1016
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:48,701
Do it.

1017
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,250
Thanks, Duke.

1018
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:12,715
I couldn't stay away anymore.

1019
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,221
I missed you.

1020
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,475
I missed you.

1021
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,812
I'm with you, no matter what.

1022
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,273
No matter what?

1023
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,028
No matter what.

1024
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:24,662
Silent darkness creeps into your soul

1025
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:31,711
And removes the light of self-control

1026
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:38,884
The cave that holds you captive has no doors

1027
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:44,557
Burnin' with determination

1028
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,518
To even up the score

1029
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:51,564
Hearts on fire

1030
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:55,192
Strong desire

1031
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:59,780
Rages deep within

1032
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,828
Hearts on fire

1033
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:12,877
Fever's rising high

1034
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:17,715
The moment of truth is here

1035
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:22,053
No pain.

1036
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:24,263
No pain.

1037
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,515
No pain. No pain.

1038
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,017
Oh, yeah

1039
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,926
Hearts on fire

1040
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:05,763
Strong desire

1041
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,182
Go on, pick it up.

1042
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,142
Pick it up, come on.

1043
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:15,106
Come on, push!

1044
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:19,860
Come on! Come on! Push it up!

1045
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,115
Drago!

1046
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:30,121
Hearts on fire

1047
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,874
Strong desire

1048
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:40,131
Rages deep within

1049
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:58,876
Drago!

1050
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,923
Drago!

1051
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:09,470
Drago!

1052
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:16,393
Hello, everybody, and Merry Christmas from a very unusual place.

1053
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:18,687
We're in Moscow, in the Soviet Union.

1054
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,856
I'm Barry Tompkins, along with Al Bandiero,

1055
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:24,568
and this promises to be the most-watched event in boxing history.

1056
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:27,446
The Iron Horse, from America, Rocky Balboa.

1057
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:33,077
Ivan Drago,

1058
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:36,330
since that tragedy in Las Vegas and the death of Apollo Creed,

1059
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:39,708
he's been re-nicknamed "Death from Above. "

1060
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,305
Drago! Drago! Drago!

1061
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:02,648
Drago! Drago!

1062
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:14,410
And high above us, the general secretary of the Soviet

1063
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:15,786
and other members of the Politburo

1064
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,663
have now made their way to their seats

1065
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,332
high above the ring here in Moscow.

1066
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,340
Rocky, I know you're kinda busy just now,

1067
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,968
but I want to tell you some things I never told you.

1068
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:34,513
I know sometimes I act stupid and I say stupid things,

1069
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,140
but you kept me around

1070
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:38,392
when other people would have said, "Drop that bum. "

1071
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:39,893
You give me respect.

1072
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:42,479
You know, it's hard for me to say these kind of things,

1073
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:44,356
because that ain't my way,

1074
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:47,776
but if I could just unzip myself and step out and be someone else,

1075
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,570
I'd want to be you.

1076
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,947
You're all heart, Rock.

1077
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,118
Thanks, Paulie.

1078
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,871
Now, blast this guy's teeth out.

1079
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,290
I'll try.

1080
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,058
Right now, one of the fighters

1081
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:22,478
is starting to make his way through this crowd and toward the ring.

1082
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:23,812
Listen to this crowd!

1083
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,022
We knew he wouldn't be popular,

1084
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,857
but this borders on pure hatred!

1085
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:29,652
Rocky's face, absolutely like stone.

1086
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,987
He is the picture of concentration,

1087
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:35,366
and the booing crowd here does not seem to bother him one bit.

1088
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:38,160
The champ has a look tonight that can burn through lead.

1089
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,789
It seems that the booing crowd has absolutely no effect on the man.

1090
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:44,249
His concentration seems to be like stone.

1091
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,584
That's my dad!

1092
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:46,835
We know.

1093
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,837
What do you think we are, nerds?

1094
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,173
Listen to this crowd. It sounds insane.

1095
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:03,227
And now the entrance of the Russian national champion,

1096
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:08,273
Ivan Drago, a man with an entire country in his corner.

1097
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:03,704
Look at the expression on the face of Ivan Drago.

1098
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:07,332
He seems impervious to this madness of the crowd.

1099
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:10,085
He's like a volcano just waiting to erupt.

1100
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,253
The Russian champion

1101
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,005
is amazingly cool, ladies and gentlemen,

1102
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:15,507
as he acknowledges his premier.

1103
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,260
As I say, I would like to point out again,

1104
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,763
this is a non-sanctioned fight.

1105
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:22,765
This is not for the title.

1106
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:25,851
The American Boxing Commission have not sanctioned this bout.

1107
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,782
Ladies and gentlemen...

1108
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,584
...Rocky Balboa!

1109
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:19,339
It's unbelievable.

1110
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:21,717
I have never, in all my years of reporting,

1111
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,468
seen such a hostile crowd.

1112
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:33,896
...Ivan Drago!

1113
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:45,949
They are screaming and roaring for their champion.

1114
01:10:46,034 --> 01:10:49,036
The two men are walking toward the center of the ring.

1115
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:51,622
It's an unbelievable sight to see.

1116
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:54,875
They're toe to toe.

1117
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,002
The Russian towers above the American.

1118
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:00,255
It's a true case of David and Goliath here.

1119
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:03,425
It's unbelievable, the condition of both men,

1120
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:04,968
but the Russian champion...

1121
01:11:05,053 --> 01:11:06,845
I must break you.

1122
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:16,104
Remember what I said back there about wanting to be you?

1123
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:17,314
Yeah.

1124
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:18,732
Forget it.

1125
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:21,902
Thanks, Paul.

1126
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:30,410
Drago! Drago!

1127
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:31,995
Take it straight to him, now.

1128
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,623
Take it straight to him and be a rock for me, you understand?

1129
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,166
Be a rock for me! Be strong!

1130
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,627
All right? Now take it to him! No pain!

1131
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:41,129
No pain. No pain.

1132
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:43,090
All right, run to him!

1133
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:46,051
There's the bell for the opening round,

1134
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,136
and Rocky Balboa comes out to the center of the ring.

1135
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:51,223
But the Russian, right back into Balboa's corner now.

1136
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:54,226
Just grab him! Grab him! Grab him!

1137
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:57,354
Come on! Get out of there!

1138
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,106
Come on, spit him out! Let's go, Rock!

1139
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,440
Get out of there!

1140
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,112
Balboa gets out of the corner now,

1141
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:08,782
and now once more it is Drago backing Rocky Balboa up with a jab,

1142
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:13,245
and Balboa is not staying on balance because of the long jab of the Russian.

1143
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,415
Brace yourself! Brace yourself!

1144
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:22,629
Come on, get up! Hands up!

1145
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,550
Charge him! Now!

1146
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,969
He can't seem to touch the Russian.

1147
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,097
Rocky pounding away at the midsection of the Russian,

1148
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,725
and he's just hitting with everything he's got.

1149
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,810
And Drago just smiled at him.

1150
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:40,022
There you go! Keep jabbing away!

1151
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:42,107
Chop him down! Chop him down!

1152
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,569
Stick it to him! Now, Rocky!

1153
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,154
Come on, Rock!

1154
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:51,074
Rocky Balboa is in serious trouble.

1155
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:54,244
They might have to stop this one before somebody gets killed.

1156
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:56,872
Reach and grab him! Reach and grab him!

1157
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:59,374
He's pounding away at the American.

1158
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:00,959
Rocky's hurt.

1159
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:03,879
He woke the sleeping giant, and now he's paying the price.

1160
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:08,175
A right hand from Drago sends Rocky Balboa 15 feet across the ring!

1161
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:10,093
And the champ is down!

1162
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,347
Get up!

1163
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,016
Get up!

1164
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,309
Come on, get up!

1165
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,607
Back up! Back up!

1166
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,657
Drago continuing to punish Rocky Balboa.

1167
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,160
He just will not let him out of that corner,

1168
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:39,581
and Rocky Balboa is just trying to get through this first round.

1169
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:49,091
The Russian just threw Rocky Balboa into his own corner like a rag doll.

1170
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,718
What a tough first three minutes for Rocky Balboa.

1171
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:54,971
He's not only fighting what appears to be an invincible opponent,

1172
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:57,307
he's also fighting a very hostile crowd

1173
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:01,311
and the Russian premier and most of the Politburo looking on.

1174
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:03,939
All right, what's happening out there?

1175
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:05,315
He's winning.

1176
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:08,693
I see three of him out there.

1177
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:09,861
Hit the one in the middle.

1178
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:11,905
Right! Hit the one in the middle.

1179
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:12,948
Yeah. Okay.

1180
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,791
Take his heart. You hurt him, you'll take his heart.

1181
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:23,959
No pain. No pain.

1182
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:25,127
No pain. Take his heart.

1183
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:26,378
Keep working! Keep working!

1184
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:29,297
There's the bell for round two.

1185
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:31,133
It's been a one-sided fight so far.

1186
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:33,593
It'll take more than luck for Rocky to survive this round.

1187
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:35,220
Rocky's been hit with bombs.

1188
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,722
Slip him a hook, Rock! Slip him a hook!

1189
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:39,933
Rocky Balboa trying to stay in the middle of the ring

1190
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:41,184
against the big Russian.

1191
01:14:41,269 --> 01:14:43,645
Move down! That a baby!

1192
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:46,731
Do what you gotta do!

1193
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:48,024
Stay with him!

1194
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:51,778
Go for it! Go for it!

1195
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:56,616
For all intents, Rocky Balboa should be all finished tonight,

1196
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:59,244
but he's fighting back ferociously.

1197
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:04,875
Rocky!

1198
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:06,585
Up, Rock! Get up!

1199
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:09,462
And Balboa goes down again from a right hand,

1200
01:15:09,547 --> 01:15:12,215
bounces right back up.

1201
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,676
He's gettin' killed out there.

1202
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:22,559
Rocky Balboa has taken Ivan Drago's best punches so far.

1203
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:26,188
He's cut and he's bleeding, but he's on his feet and he's on the run.

1204
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,901
Hold on! Hold on!

1205
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:32,903
Drago! Drago!

1206
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:35,238
He's cut! He's cut!

1207
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:37,324
The Russian's cut, and it's a bad cut,

1208
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:41,036
and now it's Rocky Balboa coming after Ivan Drago!

1209
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:51,213
You got him! You got him! Yes!

1210
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:53,131
Incredible! Go get him!

1211
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,217
Go! Go!

1212
01:15:57,637 --> 01:15:59,471
And now the Russian wants to go on!

1213
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,681
He grabs Rocky Balboa by the throat.

1214
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:03,433
Balboa picking up the Russian

1215
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,894
and throws him to the ground like a wrestler.

1216
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:10,023
It's a gutter war, no holds barred in Moscow.

1217
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:13,568
Rocky may be on the receiving end so far, but he's here to fight.

1218
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:15,946
This is shaping up to be a personal war,

1219
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:19,157
and right now it's anybody's boxing match.

1220
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:23,662
You're doing good, Rocky. Couldn't do better myself.

1221
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,080
Thanks.

1222
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,293
You got him hurt bad. Yeah?

1223
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:31,711
Now he's worried.

1224
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:33,755
You cut him! You hurt him!

1225
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:37,342
You see? You see? He's not a machine! He's a man!

1226
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:47,269
You want it more than he does. No pain.

1227
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:50,188
No pain. No pain.

1228
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:53,608
Okay, take it to him! Take it to him! Take it to him!

1229
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:12,836
Get up!

1230
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:46,411
Balboa's down!

1231
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:49,998
It's all right.

1232
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:57,005
And a good right hand by Rocky Balboa!

1233
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:09,059
Come on, come on!

1234
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:20,612
Rocky's got him now!

1235
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:25,950
You're doing fine. You're doing great.

1236
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:27,952
You've come a mighty long way, baby.

1237
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:36,169
Crush him! Now!

1238
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,065
That's it! Keep going!

1239
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:58,400
Go, go!

1240
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:02,821
Punch him! Punch him!

1241
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,268
Come on!

1242
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:43,403
A few cheers now for Rocky Balboa!

1243
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,531
Suddenly, Moscow is pro-Rocky!

1244
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:01,212
No pain. No pain.

1245
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,133
Keep taking it to him, you understand?

1246
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:08,845
Take his heart. No pain.

1247
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:28,198
I'll tell you, Al, this place is ready to explode.

1248
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:30,825
Lethal punch after punch! Amazing willpower!

1249
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,368
Neither man backing off,

1250
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:33,995
and Rocky Balboa's determination

1251
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,874
is actually beginning to win over what was once a hostile crowd.

1252
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:39,042
This is incredible!

1253
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:41,503
What round is it?

1254
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,505
Fifteen. One more round.

1255
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:46,508
There's no stopping us now. This is our round.

1256
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:51,513
Rocky! Rocky!

1257
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:54,182
Don't stop it now! We start, and we don't stop!

1258
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,352
All your strength, all your power, all your love,

1259
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:58,937
everything you've got!

1260
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:13,910
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

1261
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:15,870
Rocky! Rocky!

1262
01:21:28,259 --> 01:21:29,842
To win, you've got to knock him out.

1263
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:33,263
You've got to punch and punch till you can't punch no more.

1264
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:35,473
This is your whole life here.

1265
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:37,308
All right, knock him out, Rocky.

1266
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:39,686
Do it now! Now!

1267
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,813
There's the bell. The war is on.

1268
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:44,440
This is the last round...

1269
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:49,946
To the end.

1270
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:54,409
Which one of these magnificent fighters

1271
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,578
will be standing at the end of this round?

1272
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,622
Drago snaps out a stiff jab, and another.

1273
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:01,165
Come on.

1274
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:03,084
Another!

1275
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,503
Rocky taking punishment, trying to get inside.

1276
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:07,422
He's completely exhausted.

1277
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:10,550
Come on, Rock!

1278
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,343
What are you waiting for?

1279
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:14,012
Fight!

1280
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:16,931
Fight!

1281
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:19,392
Rocky! Rocky!

1282
01:22:19,476 --> 01:22:21,811
Hit him! Hit him!

1283
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,689
Come on! Come on, fight!

1284
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,066
Rocky! Rocky!

1285
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:28,818
Come on, fight!

1286
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:35,158
Come on!

1287
01:22:46,754 --> 01:22:49,130
Balboa is chopping the Russian down!

1288
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:52,592
Don't stop, Rock! Don't stop!

1289
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:54,218
Combinations of punches on the Russian,

1290
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:56,304
and Drago throws a hard right hand,

1291
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:58,431
which stuns Rocky Balboa.

1292
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:06,147
Don't go down! Don't go down!

1293
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:12,028
You can forget technique, forget strategy,

1294
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:13,946
this is just a street fight.

1295
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,657
It's a question of who wants it most.

1296
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:17,742
What is he doing? He's winning.

1297
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:25,416
To the body! To the body!

1298
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:26,876
Come on!

1299
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:31,172
Rocko! Rocko, break his head!

1300
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,216
Rocko, knock his head off!

1301
01:23:33,384 --> 01:23:36,010
Come on! Finish him!

1302
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:38,846
Don't stop, Rock!

1303
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:43,601
Yeah! Don't stop! This is incredible!

1304
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:45,353
You're gonna do it!

1305
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:01,160
Four!

1306
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:03,788
Six!

1307
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:12,630
Rocky Balboa has done the impossible,

1308
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:15,174
and these people love it!

1309
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:18,052
It is absolute pandemonium.

1310
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:22,056
More than ever, Rocky has proven himself a true champion!

1311
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:30,648
Rocky! Rocky!

1312
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:36,654
Rocky! Rocky!

1313
01:24:46,373 --> 01:24:48,291
...Rocky Balboa!

1314
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:54,714
Thank you.

1315
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:02,680
I came here tonight,

1316
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:05,475
and I didn't know what to expect.

1317
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:11,063
I seen a lot of people hatin' me,

1318
01:25:11,482 --> 01:25:15,860
and I didn't know what to feel about that,

1319
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:20,072
so I guess I didn't like you much none either.

1320
01:25:25,204 --> 01:25:27,789
During this fight,

1321
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,374
I seen a lot of changing.

1322
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:37,381
The way you felt about me,

1323
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:40,718
and the way I felt about you.

1324
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:50,520
In here, there were two guys killing each other,

1325
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:55,733
but I guess that's better than 20 million.

1326
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:01,739
So, what I'm trying to say is

1327
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:05,993
that if I can change

1328
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:09,831
And you can change,

1329
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:14,794
everybody can change!

1330
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:36,858
I just want to say one thing to my kid,

1331
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,901
who should be home sleeping.

1332
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:40,611
Merry Christmas, kid!

1333
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,865
I love you!

1334
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:59,255
Silent darkness creeps into your soul

1335
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:06,304
And removes the light of self-control

1336
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:13,519
The cave that holds you captive has no doors

1337
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:19,066
Burnin' with determination

1338
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:22,278
To even up the score

1339
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:26,198
Hearts on fire

1340
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:29,869
Strong desire

1341
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:34,624
Rages deep within

1342
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:40,421
Hearts on fire

1343
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:47,511
Fever's risin' high

1344
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:52,016
The moment of truth draws near

1345
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:04,487
Time will not allow you to stand still, no

1346
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:09,742
Silence breaks the heart and bends the will

1347
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:16,832
And things that give deep passions are your sword

1348
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:25,549
Rules and regulations have no meaning anymore

1349
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:29,679
Hearts on fire

1350
01:28:29,763 --> 01:28:33,307
Strong desire

1351
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:38,062
Rages deep within

1352
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,943
Hearts on fire

1353
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:51,033
Fever's risin' high

1354
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:55,579
The moment of truth is here

1355
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,457
Oh

1356
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:03,754
Is here

1357
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:08,592
Oh, yeah

1358
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:40,332
Hearts on fire

1359
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:43,878
Strong desire

1360
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:49,967
Rages deep within
