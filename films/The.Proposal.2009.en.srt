1
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,747
Shit! 

2
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,270
Andrew, hey.

3
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,767
Here you go.
Your regular lattes.

4
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:56,009
Literally saved my life.
Thank you. Thank you.

5
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,721
- Everyone OK?
- Yeah.

6
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,028
- Yeah.
- Me too.

7
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,767
Hello, Frank? How's my favorite writer?

8
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,466
Of course you've been
thinking about our talk

9
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:22,167
because you know I'm right.

10
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,108
Frank, people in this
country are busy, broke,

11
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:26,236
and they hate to read.
They need someone they can trust to say,

12
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,611
<i>"Hey! Don't watch
CSl: Indianapolis tonight.</i>

13
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,049
Read a book! Read Frank's book."
And that person is Oprah.

14
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,119
- Cuttin' it close.
- One of those mornings.

15
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:40,648
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

16
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,957
Sweet...

17
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,657
- Uh, sorry.
...Jesus!

18
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,597
Rub some dirt on it, brother.

19
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:50,091
Frank, the truth is all
A-plus novelists do publicity.

20
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,835
Roth, McCourt, Russo, and...

21
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:56,774
Frank! Can I tell you what else
they have in common? A Pulitzer.

22
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,411
I need the shirt off
your back. Literally.

23
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,903
- You're kidding, right?
- Yankees, Boston, this Tuesday,

24
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,349
two company seats for your shirt.
You have five seconds to decide.

25
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,046
Five, four, three, two, one.

26
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,576
I know...

27
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,885
- Shh!
- Later.

28
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,960
Uh-oh.

29
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,830
Uh, hello. Hello?

30
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,447
Morning, boss. You have a
conference call in 30 minutes.

31
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,450
Yes. About the marketing
of the spring books. I know.

32
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,849
Staff meeting at 9:00.

33
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,444
Did you call, um...
What's her name?

34
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,921
The one with the ugly hands.

35
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:44,980
- Janet.
- Yes, Janet.

36
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,423
Yes. I did call her. I told her that

37
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,154
if she doesn't get her
manuscript in on time

38
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,594
you won't give her a release date.
Your immigration lawyer called.

39
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,756
He said it's imperative...

40
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,459
Cancel the call, push
the meeting to tomorrow

41
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,932
and keep the lawyer on the sheets.

42
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,434
Oh, and get a hold of PR,

43
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,902
have them start drafting
a press release.

44
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,404
<i>Frank is doing Oprah.</i>

45
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,964
Wow. Nicely done.

46
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:05,205
If I want your praise,
I will ask for it.

47
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,214
Um...

48
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,909
Who is, uh, who is Jillian?

49
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,646
And why does she want me to call her?

50
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,790
Well, that was originally my cup.

51
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,793
And I'm drinking your coffee why?

52
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,852
Because your coffee spilled.

53
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:32,368
So, you drink unsweetened
cinnamon light soy lattes?

54
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,465
I do. It's like Christmas in a cup.

55
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,941
Is that a coincidence?

56
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,376
Incredibly, it is.

57
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,573
I mean I wouldn't possibly drink
the same coffee that you drink

58
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,241
just in case yours spilled.

59
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,079
That would be pathetic.

60
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,143
Morning. Miss Tate's office.

61
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,483
Hey, Bob.

62
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,387
Actually, we're headed to
your office right now. Yeah.

63
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,190
Why are we headed to Bob's office?

64
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,698
Oop!

65
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,703
Have you finished the
manuscript I gave you?

66
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,306
Uh, I read a few pages.
I wasn't that impressed.

67
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,714
- Can I say something?
- No.

68
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,809
I've read thousands of manuscripts,

69
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,251
and this is the only one
I've given you.

70
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,016
There's an incredible novel in there.

71
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:24,955
The kind of novel you used to publish.

72
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,290
Uh, wrong. And I do think you
order the same coffee as I do

73
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:30,818
just in case you spill,
which is, in fact, pathetic.

74
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,125
- Or impressive.
- I'd be impressed

75
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,393
if you didn't spill in the first place.

76
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,866
Now remember, you're
just a prop in here.

77
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,869
Won't say a word.

78
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:44,275
Ah! Our fearless leader and
her liege. Please, do come in.

79
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,939
Oh. Beautiful breakfront. Is it new?

80
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,006
It is English Regency Egyptian
Revival, built in the 1800s

81
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,883
but, yes, it is new to my office.

82
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,547
Witty.

83
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,216
Bob, I'm letting you go.

84
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,852
Pardon?

85
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,989
<i>I asked you over a dozen times to get
Frank to do Oprah, and you didn't do it.</i>

86
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,125
You're fired.

87
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,697
I have told you that is impossible.

88
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:14,137
Frank hasn't done an
interview in 20 years.

89
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,868
Well that is
interesting, because I just

90
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,399
got off the phone
with him, and he is in.

91
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,078
Excuse me?

92
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:22,512
You didn't even call him, did you?

93
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,645
- But...
- I know, I know.

94
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,916
Frank can be a little scary
to deal with. For you.

95
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,186
Now, I will give you two
months to find another job.

96
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,693
And then you can tell
everyone you resigned, OK?

97
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:40,857
What's his twenty?

98
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,563
He's moving. He has crazy eyes.

99
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,697
Don't do it, Bob. Don't do it.

100
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,732
You poisonous bitch!

101
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,437
You can't fire me!

102
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,776
You don't think I see
what you're doing here?

103
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,577
Sandbagging me on this Oprah thing

104
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,516
just so that you can
look good to the board?

105
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,543
Because you are threatened by me!

106
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,454
- And you are a monster.
- Bob, stop.

107
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,789
Just because you have
no semblance of a life

108
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,590
outside of this office,

109
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,756
you think that you can treat all of us

110
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,458
like your own personal slaves.

111
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,059
You know what? I feel sorry for you.

112
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,832
Because you know what you're
gonna have on your deathbed?

113
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,896
Nothing and no one.

114
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,303
Listen carefully, Bob.

115
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,941
I didn't fire you because
I feel threatened. No.

116
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:34,384
I fired you because you're
lazy, entitled, incompetent

117
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,081
and you spend more time
cheating on your wife

118
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,453
than you do in your office.

119
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,821
And if you say another word,

120
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,156
Andrew here is gonna have you
thrown out on your ass, OK?

121
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:43,718
Another word and you're
going out of here

122
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,025
with an armed escort.

123
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,929
Andrew will film it with
his little camera phone

124
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,593
and he will put it
on that Internet site.

125
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,862
- What was it?
- YouTube?

126
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,336
Exactly. Is that what you want?

127
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,998
Didn't think so. I have work to do.

128
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,367
Have security take his
breakfront out of his office

129
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,537
and put it in my conference room.

130
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,603
Will do.

131
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,738
And I need you around this weekend

132
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,146
to help review his files
and his manuscript.

133
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,776
- This weekend?
- You have a problem with that?

134
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,843
No. I... just my
grandmother's 90th birthday,

135
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,286
so I was gonna go home and...

136
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,119
...it's fine. I'll cancel it.

137
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,091
You're actually saving me from
a weekend of misery anyway,

138
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,423
so it's... good talk, yeah.

139
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:20,558
I know, I know. OK, tell
Gammy I'm sorry. OK? What...

140
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,158
Mom. What do you want me to tell you?

141
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,635
She's making me work the weekend.

142
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,967
No, I'm not... no.

143
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,563
Listen, I've worked too
hard for this promotion

144
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,699
to throw it all away, OK?

145
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,231
I'm sure that Dad is pissed,

146
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,177
but we take all of our submissions
around here very seriously.

147
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,613
We'll get back to
you as soon as we can.

148
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,640
- Was that your family?
- Yes.

149
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,413
- They tell you to quit?
- Every single day.

150
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,650
Miss Tate's office.

151
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,385
Oh... Yeah. OK. All right.

152
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,518
Bergen and Malloy want to
see you upstairs immediately.

153
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,155
OK. Come get me in ten
minutes. We've got a lot to do.

154
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,221
Okey-doke.

155
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,565
Good morning, Miss Tate.

156
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,799
Jack, Edwin.

157
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,606
<i>Margaret, congratulations
on the Oprah thing.</i>

158
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,510
- That's terrific news.
- Thank you, thank you.

159
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,413
This isn't about my second raise, is it?
Just kidding.

160
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,078
Margaret, do you
remember when we agreed

161
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,145
that you wouldn't go to
the Frankfurt Book Fair

162
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,587
because you weren't allowed
out of the country

163
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,523
while your visa application
was being processed?

164
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:20,582
Yes. I do.

165
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,992
And... you went to Frankfurt.

166
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,224
Yes, I did. We were going
to lose DeLillo to Viking.

167
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,289
So... really didn't
have a choice, did I?

168
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,698
It seems that the
United States Government

169
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,759
doesn't care much who
publishes Don DeLillo.

170
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,567
We, uh, just spoke to
your immigration attorney.

171
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,234
Great. So, we're all good?
Everything good?

172
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,743
Margaret, your visa application
has been denied.

173
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,941
And you are being deported.

174
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,107
Deported?

175
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,844
And apparently there
was also some paperwork

176
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,249
that you didn't fill out in time.

177
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:50,745
Come on. Come on! It's not
like I'm even an immigrant!

178
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,781
I'm from Canada, for Christ's sake.

179
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,191
There's gotta be... there's
gotta be something we can do.

180
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,195
We can reapply, but unfortunately

181
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:00,221
you have to leave the country
for at least a year.

182
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:07,171
OK. OK, well, that's
not ideal, but, uh...,

183
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,003
I can, uh... I can manage
everything from Toronto...

184
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,201
No, Margaret.

185
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,539
...with videoconferencing
and Internet.

186
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,703
Unfortunately, Margaret,

187
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,441
if you're deported,
you can't work for an American company.

188
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,881
Until this is resolved I'm going
to turn operations over

189
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,111
to Bob Spaulding.

190
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,813
Bob Spaulding? The guy I just fired?

191
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,253
We need an editor in chief.

192
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,655
He is the only person in the building
who has enough experience.

193
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,522
- You cannot be serious. I beg of you.
- Margaret.

194
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,528
We are desperate to have you stay.

195
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,531
If there was any way, any way at all

196
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,123
that we could make this work,
we'd be doing it.

197
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,292
There is no way...

198
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,358
I am begging you.

199
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,029
No, Margaret. Excuse me,
we're in a meeting.

200
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,628
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What? What!

201
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,232
Mary from Miss Winfrey's office
called. She's on the line.

202
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,332
- I know.
- She's on hold.

203
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,310
She needs to speak with you right away.
I told her you were otherwise engaged.

204
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,905
She insisted, so... sorry.

205
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,575
So...

206
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,584
Uh...

207
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,230
Come here.

208
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:11,432
Uh... Gentlemen, I understand.
I understand...

209
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,564
the predicament that we are in.

210
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,268
And, um...

211
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,374
And there's, uh... well...

212
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:23,040
I think there's something
that you should know.

213
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,784
Uh... we're, uh...
we're getting married.

214
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,913
We are getting married.

215
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,582
- Who is getting married?
- You and I.

216
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,388
You and I are getting married! Yes.

217
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:36,087
- We are.
- Getting married.

218
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,561
- We are getting married.
- Yes.

219
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,424
Isn't he your secretary?

220
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,525
Assistant.

221
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:46,299
Executive, uh...
assistant secretary. Titles.

222
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:50,604
But, wouldn't be the first time
one of us fell for our secretaries.

223
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,634
Would it, Edwin?

224
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,908
With Laquisha. Remember?

225
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:58,474
So, yeah... The truth is,

226
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,647
you know, Andrew and I, we're...
we are just two people

227
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,849
who weren't meant to
fall in love but we did.

228
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,221
No.

229
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:11,286
All those late nights at the
office and weekend book fairs.

230
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,388
- Yeah...
- No.

231
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,093
- Something happened.
- Something.

232
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,262
Yeah. Tried to fight it and...

233
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,931
Can't, can't fight a...

234
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:24,432
Can't fight a love like ours, so, uh...

235
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:27,877
Uh... Are we good with this?
Are you happy?

236
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,781
Because, well... we are happy. So happy.

237
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:32,943
- Margaret.
- Yes?

238
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,885
It's terrific.

239
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,649
Just make it legal. Mmm?

240
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,317
Oh! Legal.

241
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,691
Yeah, well, then...
then that means we...

242
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,026
...we need to get ourselves
to the immigration office.

243
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,692
So we can work this
whole mess out. Right?

244
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,598
Thank you
very much, gentlemen.

245
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,693
We will do that right away.

246
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,931
Thank you very much,
gentlemen. Thank you.

247
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,202
- Gentlemen.
- Thank you.

248
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,878
Margaret
and Andrew are getting married!

249
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,209
What is that about?

250
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,306
Dragon Lady!
Here they come...

251
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,680
Yeah.

252
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,480
What is he thinking?

253
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:07,610
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

254
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,316
Dude, for real. Her?

255
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,622
Married? Didn't
even know they were dating...

256
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,606
What?

257
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,884
I don't understand what's happening.

258
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,888
Relax. This is for you, too.

259
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,253
Do explain.

260
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,520
They were going to make Bob chief.

261
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:48,219
So naturally I would have to marry you.

262
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,852
And what's the problem?

263
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,227
Like you were saving yourself
for someone special?

264
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,392
I like to think so.
Besides, it's illegal.

265
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,631
They're looking for terrorists,
not for book publishers.

266
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,195
- Margaret.
- Yes?

267
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,299
- I'm not gonna marry you.
- Sure you are.

268
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,368
Because if you don't marry me, your
dreams of touching the lives of millions

269
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,141
with the written word are dead.

270
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,611
Bob is gonna fire you the second
I'm gone. Guaranteed.

271
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,714
That means you're out on the street
alone looking for a job.

272
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,248
That means all the time that
we spent together, all the lattes,

273
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,488
all the canceled dates,
all the midnight Tampax runs,

274
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,828
were all for nothing and all your dreams
of being an editor are gone.

275
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:29,265
But don't worry, after the required
allotment of time,

276
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,768
we'll get a quickie divorce
and you'll be done with me.

277
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,634
But until then, like it or not,

278
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,605
your wagon is hitched to mine. OK?

279
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,835
Phone.

280
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,751
- This way.
- Margaret.

281
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,816
- Come.
- The line...

282
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,884
Next, please.

283
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,555
Ooh, ooh. Just, uh...

284
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,120
Sorry, I just need to ask him something.

285
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,962
I need for you to file this
fiancée visa for me, please.

286
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,005
- Miss Tate?
- Yes.

287
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,100
Please, come with me.

288
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,703
Yes, ma'am, I understand
that. We're backed up...

289
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,110
I have a bad feeling about this.

290
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,151
- Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

291
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,678
Hi. I'm Mr. Gilbertson.

292
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,782
- Ah!
- And you must be Andrew,

293
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,156
- and you must be...
- Margaret.

294
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,990
...Margaret. Sorry about the wait.

295
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,690
It's a, uh, crazy day today.

296
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,891
Oh, of course, of course. We understand.

297
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,957
And I can't tell you how much
we appreciate you seeing us

298
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:40,062
- on such short notice.
- OK.

299
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,596
<i># Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh
buh, buh, buh, buuuh</i>

300
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,472
So, I have one question for you.

301
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,707
Are you both committing fraud
to avoid her deportation

302
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:51,842
so she can keep her position
as editor in chief at Colden Books?

303
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,512
- That's ridiculous.
- Where did you hear that?

304
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,852
We had a phone tip this afternoon
from a man named...

305
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,653
Would it be Bob Spaulding?

306
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,022
Bob Spaulding.

307
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,359
Bob. Poor Bob. I am so sorry.

308
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:08,332
Bob is nothing but a disgruntled
former employee.

309
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,459
And I apologize.

310
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,197
But we know you're incredibly busy

311
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:16,105
with a room full of gardeners
and delivery boys to tend to.

312
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,699
If you just give us our next step,

313
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,768
we will be out of your
hair and on our way.

314
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,437
Miss Tate, please.

315
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:27,979
Let me explain to you the
process that's about to unfold.

316
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,421
Step one will be a scheduled interview.

317
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,984
I'll put you each in a room,
and I'll ask you every little question

318
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,995
that a real couple
would know about each other.

319
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:41,227
Step two, I dig deeper.
I look at your phone records,

320
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,598
I talk to your neighbors,
I interview your coworkers.

321
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,069
If your answers don't match up
at every point,

322
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,767
you will be deported indefinitely.

323
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,207
And you, young man,
will have committed a felony...

324
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:55,236
...punishable by a fine of $250,000

325
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,512
and a stay of five years
in federal prison.

326
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,852
So, Andrew.

327
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:09,292
You wanna... you want to talk to me?

328
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,929
No?

329
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,902
Yes?

330
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,873
The truth is...

331
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:32,713
Mr. Gilbertson, the truth is...

332
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,514
Margaret and I...

333
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,257
...are just two people

334
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,283
who weren't supposed to fall in love.

335
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,857
But did.

336
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,895
We couldn't tell anyone we work with

337
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,528
because of my big promotion
that I had coming up.

338
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,037
- Promotion?
- Yeah.

339
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:56,905
- Your?
- We... we both felt, uh...

340
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:01,072
...that it would be deeply inappropriate
if I were to be promoted to editor.

341
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,775
- Editor. Mmm-hmm.
...while we were...

342
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,844
So...

343
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,946
Have the two of you told your parents
about your secret love?

344
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,322
Oh, I... impossible.
My parents are dead.

345
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,623
- No brothers or sisters either.
- Gone.

346
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,960
Are your parents dead?

347
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,158
- Oh, no, his are very much alive.
- No... very much.

348
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,499
Very much. They're, ah... Well,
we were gonna tell them this weekend.

349
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:28,495
Gammy's 90th birthday, and the whole
family's coming together.

350
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,132
And we thought it'd be a nice surprise.

351
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,200
And where is this
surprise gonna take place?

352
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,337
At Andrew's parents' house.

353
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,505
Where is that located again?

354
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,175
Um...
Why am I doing all the talking?

355
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,582
It's your parents' house.

356
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,051
Why don't you tell him
where it is. Jump in.

357
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:45,217
- Sitka.
- Sitka.

358
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,282
- Alaska.
- Alaska?

359
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,419
You're gonna go to Alaska this weekend?

360
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,931
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

361
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,162
We are going to Alaska.
Alaska, that's where...

362
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,102
That's where my little...
that's where my Andrew's from.

363
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,970
OK.

364
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,465
Fine. I see how this is gonna go.

365
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,445
I will see you both
at 11:00 Monday morning

366
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,448
for your scheduled interview,

367
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,883
and your answers better
match up on every account.

368
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,485
- Thank you.
- Hello?

369
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:18,614
- I'm looking forward to this one.
- We're looking forward to this one.

370
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,715
Thank you.

371
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,522
Gonna be fun.
I'll be checking up on you.

372
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,585
You got it.

373
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,000
OK... so, what's gonna happen is
we will go up there.

374
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,063
We will pretend like we're
boyfriend and girlfriend,

375
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,699
tell your parents we're engaged.

376
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,334
Uh, use the miles for the tickets.

377
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:42,074
I guess I will pop for you to fly first
class. But make sure you use the miles.

378
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,445
If we don't get the miles,
we're not doing it.

379
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,416
Oh, and please confirm
the vegan meal, OK?

380
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,418
'Cause last time they actually
gave it to a vegan,

381
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,079
and they, uh... forced me to eat

382
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,612
this clammy, warm, creamy
salad thing, which was...

383
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,648
Hey, I'm... Why aren't you taking notes?

384
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,024
I'm sorry, were you not in that room?

385
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,426
What? What?

386
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,288
Oh! The thing you said about
being promoted?

387
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,324
Genius! Genius.
He completely fell for it.

388
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,630
I was serious.

389
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,571
I'm looking at a $250,000 fine
and five years in jail.

390
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:08,800
That changes things.

391
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,970
- Promote you to editor? No, no way.
- Then I quit, and you're screwed.

392
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,035
Bye-bye, Margaret.

393
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,546
- Andrew!
- It really has been

394
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,981
- a little slice of heaven.
- Andrew, Andrew! Fine, fine.

395
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,253
I'll make you editor. Fine.

396
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,882
If you do the Alaska weekend
and the immigration interview,

397
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,825
I will make you editor. Happy?

398
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,260
- And not in two years. Right away.
- Fine.

399
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,786
And you'll publish my manuscript.

400
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:35,998
Ten thousand copy first...

401
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,592
Twenty thousand copies, first run.

402
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,570
And we'll tell my family
about our engagement

403
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:41,231
when I want and how I want.

404
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,571
Now, ask me nicely.

405
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:44,768
"Ask you nicely" what?

406
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,576
Ask me nicely to marry you, Margaret.

407
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:53,641
- What does that mean?
- You heard me. On your knee.

408
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:03,818
Fine.

409
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,569
- Does this work for you?
- Oh, I like this. Yeah.

410
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,767
- Will you marry me?
- No.

411
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,366
Say it like you mean it.

412
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:24,380
- Andrew?
- Yes, Margaret?

413
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,510
- Sweet Andrew?
- I'm listening.

414
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,544
Would you please,
with cherries on top, marry me?

415
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,820
OK. I don't appreciate the sarcasm,
but I'll do it.

416
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,489
- See you at the airport tomorrow.
- Good.

417
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,902
So, these are the questions
that INS is gonna ask us.

418
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,938
Now, the good news is is
I know everything about you,

419
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,678
but the bad news is
that you have four days

420
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:04,519
to learn all this about me.
So, you should... probably get studying.

421
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,357
You know all the answers
to these questions about me?

422
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,420
- Scary, isn't it?
- A little bit.

423
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,864
- What am I allergic to?
- Pine nuts.

424
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,834
And the full spectrum of human emotion.

425
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,836
Oh, that's... that was funny.

426
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,667
- Mmm-hmm.
- Umm...

427
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:23,572
Here's a good one. Do I have any scars?

428
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,508
I'm pretty sure that you have a tattoo.

429
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,205
Oh, you're pretty sure?

430
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,611
I'm pretty sure. Two years ago,
your dermatologist called

431
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,582
and asked about a Q-switched laser.

432
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,174
I of course Googled a Q-switched laser

433
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,516
and found that they
in fact do remove tattoos.

434
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,112
But you canceled your appointment.

435
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,248
So what is it? Tribal ink?

436
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,226
Japanese calligraphy? Barbed wire?

437
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,093
You know, it's exciting for me
to experience you like this.

438
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,394
Thank you. You're gonna have
to tell me where it is, though.

439
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,899
- No, I'm not.
- They're gonna ask.

440
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,459
We're done with that question.
We're done with that question.

441
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,698
On to another question.
Let me see, let me see.

442
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:56,605
Oh, here's one. Whose place do we
stay at, yours or mine?

443
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,040
That's easy. Mine.

444
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,941
And why wouldn't we stay at mine?

445
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,469
Because I live at Central Park West.

446
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,449
And you probably live at some
squalid little studio apartment

447
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:08,453
with stacks of yellowed
Penguin Classics.

448
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,456
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,
please fasten your seat belts.</i>

449
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,084
<i>We are beginning our descent
into Juneau.</i>

450
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,854
Juneau? I thought
we were going to Sitka.

451
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:21,155
- We are.
- How are we getting to Sitka?

452
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,329
Whoa.

453
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:53,593
All right. Here we go.

454
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,968
- Oh, there he is!
- Andrew!

455
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,504
Hi. Right this way...

456
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,878
- Hi!
- Oh...

457
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,511
- It's so good to see you!
- You're suffocating him, Grace.

458
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,453
- Come here.
- Hey, Gammy.

459
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:19,252
Ah, Gammy. How are you doing?
Where's Dad?

460
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,987
Oh, you know your father.
He's always working.

461
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,393
Never mind about him. Where's your girl?

462
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,897
Uh, she's... right there.

463
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,524
- Ah.
- There she is.

464
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,536
I guess the word "girl"
is inappropriate.

465
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,901
Annie.

466
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,029
- Hi!
- Hello.

467
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,836
- Margaret, this is my mom.
- Oh, hello.

468
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,309
Yeah, great. This is my gammy, Annie.

469
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,438
- Pleasure.
- Well, hello there.

470
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,474
Now, do you prefer being called Margaret
or Satan's Mistress?

471
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,384
We've heard it both ways.

472
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,218
Actually we've heard it
lots of ways.

473
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,848
She's kidding.

474
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,359
Oh! Oh... OK.

475
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:56,860
Thank you so much for...

476
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,590
allowing me to be a part
of this weekend.

477
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,827
Oh, you're welcome.
We're thrilled to have you.

478
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,595
Let's get you two back to the fort.

479
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,762
- OK.
- Oh...

480
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,830
- It's so good to see you.
- There we are.

481
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:43,969
Andrew...

482
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:47,467
Andrew. Andrew!

483
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,941
Please, don't do that.

484
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:55,146
You didn't tell me about all
the family businesses, honey.

485
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:58,383
He was probably just
being modest, dear.

486
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,913
Oh.

487
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,493
What are we doing? Shouldn't we
check into our hotel right now?

488
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,935
Oh, we canceled your reservation.

489
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,404
Family doesn't stay at a hotel.

490
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,134
You're gonna stay in our home.

491
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,165
Oh, great! Great.

492
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,608
- What?
- God.

493
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,839
You're gonna wanna use your legs
to lift that one.

494
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,713
Andrew! Help her with those.

495
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,240
I'd love to, but she won't let me
do anything.

496
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:30,777
She insists on doing it all herself.
She's one of those... she's a feminist.

497
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,226
Come on, sweetie.

498
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,295
You see the shoes
that broad was wearing?

499
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:55,972
This is the last of 'em.

500
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,811
- Oh!
- Ooh.

501
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,013
- Five second rule.
- Got it!

502
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,385
That will dry right off.

503
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,652
Psst! Psst!
I'm not getting on that boat.

504
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,556
You don't have to.
See you in a few days.

505
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,823
Psst! You know I can't swim.

506
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,353
Hence, the boat.

507
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:21,737
Come on.

508
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,212
Come on. Here we go.

509
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:38,184
Looking good, boss.
Take your time, though.

510
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,282
Shh.

511
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,191
She comes with a lot of baggage.

512
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,563
Just gonna give you
a little hand here.

513
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,470
Hand off ass! Off ass!

514
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,134
There you go. You're there.

515
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:07,441
Congratulations.
I'm a hundred years old now.

516
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,939
Here we are. We're home.

517
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,342
That is your home?

518
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,780
Who are you people?

519
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,660
Why did you tell me
you were poor?

520
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,537
- I never said I was poor.
- But you never told me you were rich.

521
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,769
I'm not rich. My parents are rich.

522
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,243
OK, you know what?
That's something only rich people say.

523
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,802
Hey, Andrew! Welcome home!

524
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,577
Hi! Mom, what is this?

525
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,244
Nothing. It's just a little
welcoming party.

526
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,513
Is that a crime?

527
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,680
Just 50 of our closest
friends and neighbors.

528
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,383
And all excited to meet you.

529
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,756
- Oh, good. Good.
- Come on. Come on.

530
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,091
- A party?
- Yeah, I guess so.

531
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:26,756
Come on. Let's go. My grandma's
moving faster than you.

532
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,765
Put your back into it.

533
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,601
So nice to meet you,
Margaret. Welcome to Sitka.

534
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,633
Jill? Hi. Nice to meet you.
My pleasure.

535
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:42,840
Why didn't you tell me you were
some kind of Alaskan Kennedy?

536
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:43,939
How could I?

537
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:47,474
We were in the middle of talking about
you for the last three years.

538
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:49,213
OK, know what? Timeout, OK?

539
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,983
This bickering Bickerson thing
has got to stop.

540
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,013
People need to think that we are
in love. So let's just...

541
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,581
That, that's no problem.
I can do that.

542
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,493
I can pretend to be the doting fiancé.
That's easy.

543
00:29:57,528 --> 00:29:58,995
But for you, it's going to require

544
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,430
that you stop snacking on
children while they dream.

545
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,162
Very funny. When are you going
to tell them we're engaged?

546
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,567
I'll pick the right moment.

547
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:09,471
Hey, Andrew. Hi!

548
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,135
Mrs. McKittrick. How are you?
Nice to see you.

549
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:14,167
Nice to see you, Mr. McKittrick.
This is Margaret.

550
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,077
- Hi. Pleasure.
- Margaret!

551
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,513
Hi, how are you? Pleasure.

552
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:20,949
So I always wanted to know,
what does a book editor do?

553
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,078
That's a great question, Louise.

554
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,521
I'm curious to know the answer myself.

555
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,353
- Hello, Dad.
- Son.

556
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,684
This must be Maggie.

557
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,355
Uh, Margaret.

558
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,855
- Joe. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure's mine.

559
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,495
So why don't you tell us exactly
what a book editor does.

560
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:42,995
Besides taking writers out
to lunch and getting bombed.

561
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,407
Now that sounds like fun.

562
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,240
No wonder you like being an editor.

563
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,509
No, Louise. Andrew's not an editor,
he's an editor's assistant.

564
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,039
Maggie here is the editor.

565
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,642
Margaret.

566
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,178
- So you're actually...
- Andrew's boss. Yeah.

567
00:30:58,222 --> 00:30:59,849
Well. How about that.

568
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,256
Huh.

569
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,283
I think I'll get a refill.

570
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,828
Charming.

571
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,695
That's a hell of
a first impression, Dad.

572
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,797
What the hell, Andrew?

573
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,604
You show up here after all this
time with this woman you hated

574
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:19,974
- and now she's your girlfriend?
- We just got here.

575
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,308
Can we wait two seconds

576
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,779
before we throw the
kitchen sink at each other?

577
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:26,045
Just never figured you for a guy
who slept his way to the middle.

578
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,779
Actually, I'll have you know
that that woman in there

579
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,446
is one of the most
respected editors in town.

580
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,579
She's your meal ticket,

581
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:32,088
and you brought her home
to meet your mother.

582
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:36,492
She's not my meal ticket, Dad.
She's my fiancée.

583
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:39,087
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.

584
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,927
I'm getting married.

585
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,402
- How are you?
- Good, good. Thank you.

586
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,768
Would you care for
some hors d'oeuvres?

587
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,102
No, I'm fine. Thank you very much.

588
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,471
It's a tradition.

589
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,169
It's the texture. I'm not a fish person.

590
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,610
- You'll like it.
- You're very sweet.

591
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:57,239
I think if you'll just taste it.

592
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:58,680
Thank you so much.

593
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,646
Ladies and gentlemen...

594
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,179
I have a very important
announcement to make.

595
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,816
Margaret and I are getting married.

596
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,121
It's the paprika.

597
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,525
So sorry.

598
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,359
That's OK. It's wash-and-wear.

599
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:18,191
Yep. Honey? Where you at?

600
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,701
Here it is.

601
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:25,369
Come on down here, pumpkin.

602
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,207
- All right.
- OK.

603
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,805
Oh, look at her. Look at her.

604
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,483
Right there, ladies and
gentlemen. There she is.

605
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,952
Congratulations, Andrew.

606
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,011
Thank you.

607
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,920
Thank you very much.

608
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:41,516
- Time to celebrate.
- Get the champagne.

609
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:46,122
So that was your idea
of the perfect time

610
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,358
- to tell them we're engaged?
- Mmm.

611
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,059
'Cause it was brilliant.
Brilliant timing.

612
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,068
Andrew. Hi.

613
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:55,038
Gert? Oh, my God. Hey, hi. Wow.

614
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,507
How you doing? I didn't know
that you were gonna be here.

615
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,807
Your mom probably wanted it to
be a surprise. So... surprise.

616
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,336
- Right.
- And...

617
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:06,316
...we're being completely rude. Hi.

618
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,547
- Oh, God. This is my ex...
- Hi. I'm Gertrude.

619
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:12,021
- Oh! Oh, wow. Wow!
- You can call me Gert.

620
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,251
Well, congratulations, you guys.

621
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,725
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

622
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,284
So did I miss the story?

623
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,256
- What story?
- What story?

624
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,060
About how you proposed.

625
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:25,433
Oh! How a man proposes says
a lot about his character.

626
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,529
- Yes.
- Yes, it does.

627
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,200
I actually would love
to hear the story, Andrew.

628
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:31,367
Would you tell us?

629
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,741
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

630
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,643
You know what?

631
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,673
Actually, Margaret loves
telling this story...

632
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:42,277
so I'm just gonna let her
go ahead and do that.

633
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,515
'Cause I think we
should just sit in rapture.

634
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:47,854
Huh! Wow, OK.

635
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:51,726
Wow, where to begin... this story.

636
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:54,754
Well... um, wow.

637
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,858
Mmm... yeah.

638
00:33:56,901 --> 00:34:01,770
OK, well, um, Andrew and I...

639
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,570
Andrew and I were about to celebrate

640
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,203
- our first anniversary together.
- Aw...

641
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,078
And I knew that he'd been
itching to ask me to marry him.

642
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:13,311
And he was scared.
Like a little tiny bird.

643
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,751
So I started leaving him
little hints here and there...

644
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:18,550
...because I knew he wouldn't
have the guts to ask, but...

645
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:21,422
That's not exactly how it happened.

646
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:22,949
- No? Hmm.
- No. No.

647
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,554
I mean, I picked up on
all her little hints.

648
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,621
This woman's about as subtle as a gun.

649
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,895
Yeah.

650
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,265
What I was worried about was

651
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,167
that she might find this little box...

652
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:36,230
Oh! The decoupage box that he made

653
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,435
where he'd taken the time to cut out

654
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,240
tiny, little pictures of himself. Yes.

655
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,976
Just pasted all over the
box. Oh! So beautiful.

656
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,450
So I opened that beautiful,
little decoupage

657
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:51,353
and out fluttered these tiny,
little hand-cut heart confettis.

658
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:55,485
And once they cleared,
I looked down, and I saw...

659
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,188
...the most beautiful, big...

660
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,753
...fat nothing.

661
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,162
No ring.

662
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,791
- No ring?
- What?

663
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:05,825
No. But inside that box...

664
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,531
...underneath all that crap...

665
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,836
...there was a little
handwritten note...

666
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:13,401
with the address to
a hotel, date, and time.

667
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,139
Real Humphrey Bogart-type stuff.

668
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,544
Yeah.

669
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,412
Masculine.

670
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,314
Anyway, naturally, Margaret thought...

671
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:21,909
I thought he was seeing someone else.

672
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,080
It was a terrible time for me,

673
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:26,487
but I went to that hotel anyway.

674
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,617
I went there and I pounded on the door,

675
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,490
but the door was already unlocked.

676
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:34,396
And as swung open that
door, there he was...

677
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,956
- Standing.
- Kneeling.

678
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,558
- Like a man.
- On a bed of rose petals,

679
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:41,060
in a tuxedo. Your son. Your son.

680
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,666
And he was choking back
soft, soft sobs.

681
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,974
And when he held back the tears
and finally caught his breath,

682
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,070
he said to me...

683
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,171
"Margaret, will you marry me?"

684
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:53,547
And she said, "Yep."
The end. Who's hungry?

685
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,582
That is quite a story.

686
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,523
- Oh, Andy!
- Gorgeous.

687
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,992
You are so sensitive.

688
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,786
Hand-cut confetti?

689
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,664
Hey! Let's see a kiss
from you two cuties.

690
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,792
Give her a kiss!

691
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,894
- No. Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

692
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:13,961
Come on!

693
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,563
OK, all right.

694
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,471
OK. Here we go. Ready?

695
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,376
What is this? Kiss her on
the mouth like you mean it.

696
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:27,009
- Kiss her. Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

697
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:30,953
Kiss her! Kiss her!
Kiss her! Kiss her!

698
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,615
OK!

699
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,849
- OK. All right.
- OK.

700
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,053
- Here we go.
- Mmm-hmm. OK.

701
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,560
Oh!

702
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,226
Andy! Give her a real kiss!

703
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,929
- Gammy.
- A real one!

704
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,494
- Yeah.
- You can do it!

705
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,199
Why don't we just do it?
Let's just do it really fast.

706
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:52,801
Mmmm.

707
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,778
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

708
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,974
- OK.
- Mmm.

709
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:07,817
Hmm.

710
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,824
I'm so happy for you two!

711
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:15,229
So happy! So happy!

712
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,131
Let's get the champagne!

713
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,003
So here we are.

714
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,568
This is your bedroom.

715
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:30,770
Wow. Wow, this is, um...
beautiful. And the view.

716
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,612
And here's the bed.

717
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,448
Wow! Exquisite bed. Exquisite.

718
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,455
So... where is Andrew's room?

719
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,423
Oh, sweetie, we're not
under any illusions

720
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,325
that you two don't
sleep in the same bed.

721
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,625
He'll sleep
in here with you.

722
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:48,029
Oh, great, 'cause we love to snuggle.

723
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,999
- Don't we, honey.
- We're huge snugglers.

724
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,264
Oh, my God. What is it?

725
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:56,205
- Calm down, Kevin.
- Whoa! You are cute.

726
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,832
Who is this?

727
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:01,470
- That's Kevin. I'm sorry, Margaret.
- So cute.

728
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,571
We just rescued him from the pound,

729
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,605
and he's still in training. Sorry.

730
00:38:05,649 --> 00:38:07,617
Just be sure you don't
let him outside,

731
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:09,448
or the eagles will snatch him.

732
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,352
No, don't you listen to her.

733
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,186
She's just pulling
your leg, isn't she?

734
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,557
By the way, there are extra
towels and linens and things

735
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:17,652
in here if you need them.

736
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,526
And if you
get chilly tonight...

737
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,224
...use this.

738
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,994
It has special powers.

739
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:26,025
Oh, what kind of special powers?

740
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,697
I call it the Baby Maker.

741
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,831
OK, well. Then I guess we...

742
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,398
...gonna be super careful with that one.

743
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,569
- Yeah, I'm just gonna...
- Don't throw it on the bed.

744
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,579
We'd better turn in.
It's been quite an evening.

745
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,342
So good night, everybody.

746
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:38,678
- Good night.
- Good night.

747
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,708
- Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

748
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,915
- Good night.
- Good night.

749
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:49,650
- Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

750
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:51,126
Thank you so much. Sweet dreams.

751
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,857
- Bye-bye, now.
- Bye.

752
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,968
So, uh... you haven't
been home in a while.

753
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,302
I haven't had a lot of vacation
time the last three years.

754
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,534
Stop complaining.

755
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:10,072
Um... Don't look, OK?

756
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,210
OK.

757
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,679
Are your eyes closed?

758
00:39:14,718 --> 00:39:16,015
Completely.

759
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:19,420
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

760
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:31,762
Those are the pajamas you
decided to bring to Alaska.

761
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:35,260
Yes, because I was supposed
to be in a hotel alone.

762
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:38,298
- Remember?
- Can we just go to sleep?

763
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,401
- Fine.
- Great.

764
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:12,302
Well.

765
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,605
Looks like I won't be
getting much sleep

766
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,169
with the sun streaming in.

767
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,043
Thank you.

768
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,209
Andrew. Phone.

769
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,714
Andrew!

770
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,148
Crap. Andrew, Andrew, phone.

771
00:40:53,183 --> 00:40:54,548
Andrew!

772
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,519
Yeah... right.

773
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:03,684
- Andrew, where is it?
- Purse, side pocket.

774
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:12,295
Hello. Hello? Hello.

775
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,201
Frank! Frank, darling.

776
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,296
Darling, Frank.

777
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,637
Are you there? Hello? Hello? Oh, crap.

778
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:21,133
I have horrible service, Frank.
Give me just one minute.

779
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:22,941
Oh, my God! Margaret!

780
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,540
One... one minute.
Frank, hold on just a second.

781
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,607
Frank, hold on. No, no, no, no.

782
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,515
Frank. Frank, I'm sorry you feel

783
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:33,216
I pressured you into doing Oprah, but...

784
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,715
Of course I want you
to be happy. Yes, yes.

785
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,596
Frank. Frank. Frank, darling.
Frank? It's going to be fine.

786
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,760
I can just call them and I can cancel.

787
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,874
You are...
you are so right, Frank.

788
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,036
Yes, Frank, of course
I'm listening to you.

789
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,739
Yeah... yes.

790
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,371
I love listening to you, Frank.

791
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:00,975
Shh! Sit. Sit.

792
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,445
No, not you, Frank.

793
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,284
No, no.

794
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,051
Frank, if I may get down to it, OK...

795
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:10,618
I think it would be
a mistake to back out.

796
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,858
Because, Frank, for so many years...

797
00:42:13,897 --> 00:42:17,355
...you have inspired me with your
beautiful words, and I feel that...

798
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,028
Shh! Dog, I'm on the phone.

799
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,970
I think it's time that the world
get to enjoy your words as well.

800
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,530
They are just so rich

801
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:24,700
with... passion...

802
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:29,406
And I think that we
should all be privy to.

803
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,141
Frank, I just, uh...

804
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,773
I just, uh, want you
to be happy, Frank.

805
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,307
Give me that dog!

806
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,786
Frank, hold on a second.
Can you hold a second?

807
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:38,845
Give me that dog!

808
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:42,081
Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

809
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,390
Come on! Come on! Oh, oh...

810
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,953
Oh, oh! Oh, oh. OK! OK, gotcha.

811
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,828
Frank, Frank.

812
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,060
Frank? So sorry, so sorry.

813
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,228
So sorry. I dropped the phone.
Now, listen, Frank.

814
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,000
I don't want to sell you on anything,

815
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,837
but this is your legacy, this book.

816
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,274
And I think it's up to you to

817
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:00,333
present your legacy to the world.

818
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,574
And call me tomorrow with your decision.

819
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,343
And my phone is on
all the time! OK, bye-bye.

820
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:06,406
No! Wait!

821
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,813
No! No! N-n-n... no. No

822
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,377
Take the doggy. Look at the doggy.

823
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,322
I need that phone. Take the dog.

824
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:14,824
Take the dog. I need that phone!

825
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:18,157
Here. Take the dog.
Take the dog. Take it. Take it.

826
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:20,186
Look at this.

827
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:24,195
- Is that cute or what?
- I know.

828
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,933
Morning, guys. Have you seen... daah.

829
00:43:28,972 --> 00:43:32,100
She's playing with Kevin.
We thought she didn't like him.

830
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,166
Will you go get her, Andy?

831
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,178
We have a whole day planned for her,

832
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,146
and she needs to get ready.

833
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:39,445
Yeah. Tell her we have
a big surprise for her.

834
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,110
Mmm.

835
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:46,656
Look! Give me my phone. Come on.
Please, just give me my phone.

836
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,318
- Come on. Right here.
- What the hell are you doing?

837
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,351
Oh, my God. Your grandmother
was completely right.

838
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,193
The eagle came
and tried to take the dog.

839
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:57,689
But then I saved him. Then it
came back, and it took my phone.

840
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:00,101
- Are you drunk?
- What? No! I'm serious.

841
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,605
He's got my phone, and Frank's
calling me on that phone.

842
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:03,970
Relax, all right?

843
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:07,067
We'll order another phone, same number.
We'll go into town tomorrow and get it.

844
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:08,169
- Really?
- Yeah.

845
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:13,343
Oh, OK. All right. Well, you go then.

846
00:44:13,383 --> 00:44:15,214
- You have to get ready.
- For what?

847
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:16,685
You're going out with Mom and the girls.

848
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,382
- I don't want to go out.
- Shopping, sightseeing. And a surprise.

849
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:20,890
- I hate shopping.
- You'll love it.

850
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:22,391
- I hate sightseeing.
- You're going.

851
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,688
- No, I don't want to go.
- You're going.

852
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,354
- I'm not going. I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

853
00:44:25,395 --> 00:44:26,862
Now give me a nice big hug.
We don't want them

854
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,023
- to think we're fighting.
- I don't want to touch you.

855
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:29,862
- Come on. Hug time.
- No, I don't want to...

856
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,629
- Hug time.
- I don't want to...

857
00:44:31,668 --> 00:44:33,431
There we go.

858
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,166
Yeah, that's nice.

859
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,902
Yeah. That's nice.

860
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,502
There we go. Isn't that nice?

861
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,069
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

862
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,580
- Mmm. Yeah.
- Boop boop boop.

863
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,879
If you touch my ass one more time,

864
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,078
I will cut your balls
off in your sleep. OK?

865
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,950
- Yeah.
- There you go.

866
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:53,650
All righty now. So, uh...
We clear on that?

867
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,056
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Such a good fiancé.

868
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,890
Hmm. Ow.

869
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:14,572
- Jeez.
- You want to see me?

870
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:17,307
Your mom found these eco-balls.

871
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,212
They dissolve in water.

872
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,581
I don't know how she
comes up with this stuff.

873
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:27,579
Anyway, she, uh... is a little peeved.

874
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:31,617
Apparently, I wasn't the most
gracious of hosts last night.

875
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:32,959
It was a little bit of a shock

876
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,554
to find out that
you're getting married...

877
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:37,829
...especially when none of us
even knew you were dating.

878
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:42,669
The point is... I owe you an apology.

879
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:46,469
Accepted.

880
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,240
There's something else.

881
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:53,113
I've been going over my
retirement plans recently,

882
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,674
and it got me thinking.

883
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,910
I've done a lot of things in my life.

884
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:01,652
Practically built an empire with
your mother from the ground up.

885
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:02,852
It doesn't mean anything unless...

886
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,292
Unless you have someone to leave it to.

887
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:07,764
- We already discussed this.
- I'd like to discuss it again.

888
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:11,734
You have responsibilities here.

889
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,531
I think I've been
more than understanding

890
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,969
about your goofing off in New York.

891
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,666
I need you to quit playing around...

892
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:17,765
Here we go again.

893
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,106
When are you going to start
taking what I do seriously?

894
00:46:20,143 --> 00:46:22,008
When you start acting seriously.

895
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:24,513
I'm sorry.

896
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,516
I feel sorry for you, Dad.

897
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,075
I wish you had another son. I really do.

898
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,279
One who wanted to stay here.

899
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,083
One who wanted to take over
the family business.

900
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,181
One who wanted to marry someone
that you approve of,

901
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,557
but it's not me. Now,
it must seem strange to you,

902
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:42,531
my life in New York... sitting
in an office, reading books.

903
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:45,160
But it makes me happy. You understand?

904
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:51,796
If that's what makes you happy,
son, I got nothing to say.

905
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:53,867
Well, that's a first.

906
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:58,610
You know what? Apology not
accepted. Have fun out here.

907
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,420
There is no way you
could leave her at home.

908
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,227
She had to be here. Absolutely.

909
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,291
She's been coming here forever.

910
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,099
I hope you are ready
for your big surprise...

911
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:24,437
...because this is one of
Sitka's greatest treasures.

912
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,738
- Right?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

913
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,079
OK, this is the big surprise

914
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:33,514
I was telling you about. You ready?

915
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,682
Oh, Margaret,
you're gonna love it!

916
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,316
Ramone's the only
exotic dancer on the island.

917
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,584
But we're lucky to have him.

918
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,922
Work it, Ramone!

919
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:28,370
- Wow.
- Over here, Ramone! Over here.

920
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,872
Over here, honey.

921
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,540
Show her what
she's gonna be missing.

922
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,908
Come, my sexy princess.

923
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,640
- Yeah!
- Oh, no. Not necessary.

924
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,547
It's a really nice gesture,
but I really need to just...

925
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,811
Go on, Margaret. Get up there!

926
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:41,909
You come dance.

927
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,442
OK, pluck my eyes out. OK.

928
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:47,116
All right. Here we go.

929
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,216
Go, Margaret! Go, Margaret!

930
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:52,387
Hey.

931
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,453
Hey... oh.

932
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:55,829
Give it to her, Ramone!

933
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,504
Go on, Ramone! Give it to her!

934
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,182
Ooh, that's a move I haven't seen.

935
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:22,587
Look at her face!

936
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,824
Guess who.
For you. For you. For you.

937
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:29,764
- Yeah!
- Enjoy!

938
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:37,939
I don't want to touch it.
No. OK, OK. Very sweet.

939
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,100
No, no, no, no, no.

940
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,570
Smack him!

941
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,012
- I'm sorry?
- Smack his ass.

942
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:47,016
Smack it. OK.

943
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:52,688
- Smack him, Margaret!
- Give it to him!

944
00:49:52,722 --> 00:49:56,249
Yeah! Woo!

945
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,090
Can I get down now?

946
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,239
Free. Be free.

947
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:21,645
Hey! There you are.
How are you holding up?

948
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:25,815
Oh, fine. Fine. Just working on my tan.

949
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,848
Yeah, the Paxtons can be
a bit overwhelming at times.

950
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,018
Yes, yes.

951
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:33,255
It's a little different
than New York, huh?

952
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:36,754
Little bit. Little bit. You ever been?

953
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,792
No. That was always
Andrew's dream, not mine.

954
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:42,202
You guys were pretty serious, huh?

955
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,969
Well, I mean, we dated in high
school and all through college,

956
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:47,101
but we were kids.

957
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:51,403
And you guys called it off because of...

958
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,815
Well, um...

959
00:50:55,852 --> 00:51:00,516
the night before we graduated
school, he proposed...

960
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,081
...and said he wanted to elope

961
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,889
and run away to New York with me.

962
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:07,488
And...

963
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,396
You said "no."

964
00:51:09,432 --> 00:51:12,367
And I said "no," yeah.

965
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:16,338
I've never been anywhere
but here. This is home.

966
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:21,174
But anyway... you're a lucky girl.

967
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:26,444
He really is the best, which
you obviously already know.

968
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:31,250
Oh, yep. Yep, very much so, yeah.

969
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:34,485
Well, cheers to you guys.

970
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:39,451
Oh... Thank you.

971
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:47,034
Looks like Ramone's
wrappin' it up.

972
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:51,907
Go, Annie!

973
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,001
I've never seen him so...

974
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,103
- No, he really got down.
...out there. I mean...

975
00:51:56,146 --> 00:52:00,344
He was wonderful.

976
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:02,112
Oh, no.

977
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,756
Andrew!

978
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,057
Andrew, honey, is everything OK?

979
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,396
What... What's he doing?

980
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:19,902
Something's up. It's best
to leave him alone.

981
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:21,198
Come on, honey.

982
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,333
<i>... Hunt's version
of that here tonight.</i>

983
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:30,073
Hey, hey, hey. What are you
doing? I'm watching that.

984
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:31,444
Why is Andrew out there

985
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,881
hollowing out that old
stupid canoe again?

986
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,351
Well, maybe he's
planning to escape. What?

987
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,183
I am so tired.

988
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:40,052
Think I'm gonna go
upstairs, take a shower,

989
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,285
wash off Ramone's coconut body oil.

990
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,690
Sure.

991
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,059
I had a great day today. Thank you.

992
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,355
What did you do?

993
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:51,629
I didn't do anything, I mean...

994
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:55,627
I just had a frank conversation
with him about his future.

995
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,300
Oh... Well, yeah.
That's a good idea.

996
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,808
That's a good idea, Joe,

997
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,073
because he will never
come back home now.

998
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:05,707
He is my son. I only get
to see him every three years

999
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,183
because of you. Because of you.

1000
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:09,276
I've had enough.

1001
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,787
- You are gonna be supportive...
- Shh!

1002
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:12,947
...of him marrying
Margaret, and that is that.

1003
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,787
Shh! Shh! Shh!

1004
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:17,383
You know, if we're not careful,

1005
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:20,328
we are gonna end up in
this great big house...

1006
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,490
...just you and me alone...

1007
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,261
...you and me and everything
that we're angry about,

1008
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:27,600
and God forbid that they
should have a grandchild

1009
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:29,332
that we never get to see.

1010
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:33,433
You are going to fix this,
Joe. I mean it. Fix it now.

1011
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:46,016
Where's a towel?

1012
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,185
Towel...

1013
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:58,361
Towel, towel, towel... towel, towel.

1014
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,232
This is all they have for a towel?

1015
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,761
It's ridiculous. I can't get dry.

1016
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:06,833
Hello.

1017
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:09,637
Hello?

1018
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:16,849
Oh!

1019
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:20,646
Oh! Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

1020
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,714
No, no, no, no, no.

1021
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,521
J-j-just... I'm sorry.

1022
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,721
L-l-let me just,
let me just get a towel.

1023
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,195
Let me just get a towel.

1024
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,164
Just... look.

1025
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,860
You need to just... I'm sorry.

1026
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,390
OK, I'm sorry for
feeding you to the eagle.

1027
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,902
I'm sorry.

1028
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:39,701
Go away. Go away.

1029
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:42,007
Go, go. Just let me get a towel.

1030
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:45,105
Go, go, go... Hold on.

1031
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,149
Yeah. Huh?

1032
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:56,215
How you like that? Huh?

1033
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,193
Take it, take it. That's right.

1034
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,856
That's what I'm talking
about. You like that?

1035
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,696
Oh. You like it.

1036
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,609
Come here. Come to Mama.

1037
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,702
That's right. Get on the carpet.

1038
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:17,736
That's a good boy.

1039
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:22,047
Yes! That's good, boy! Come on.

1040
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:23,746
Come on!

1041
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,311
Oh, oh!

1042
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:32,384
- Oh, oh!
- What the?

1043
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,954
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

1044
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,398
- Why are you naked? My God!
- Oh, God. Why are you wet?

1045
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:40,028
- Don't look at me.
- I don't understand.

1046
00:55:40,069 --> 00:55:41,559
- Why are you wet?
- Why are you naked?

1047
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:43,265
Don't look at me.

1048
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,900
Oh, God! You're showing everything.

1049
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,933
Cover it up, for the love of God!

1050
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:52,243
Oh, God, not the Baby Maker.

1051
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:53,806
Explain yourself please.

1052
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,080
- Explain myself?
- Yes, explain yourself.

1053
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,279
- I was outside.
- Oh, really?

1054
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,584
- You didn't hear me?
- I was listening to...

1055
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:00,816
What are you even doing home?

1056
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,984
Then you just, jump me
out of nowhere? What's that?

1057
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,755
I di... I didn't mean to jump you.

1058
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:09,094
Your dog was attacking me, and I
had to run, and I ran into you.

1059
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,759
What is it with you and this dog?

1060
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,791
Just, you know, just... go.

1061
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:14,133
- Go...
- Fine.

1062
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,762
- Go take a shower. You stink.
- Fine.

1063
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:17,636
- Nice tattoo, by the way.
- What?

1064
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:22,176
See? See? Exactly. You see that?

1065
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,806
Oh... barely made it out
with my life there.

1066
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,782
See the size of the teeth on that thing?

1067
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:28,215
I didn't...

1068
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:47,929
So... So naked.

1069
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,872
Can we, uh, not talk about that, please?

1070
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,566
Just sayin'.

1071
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:02,009
So, uh, what's the deal
with you and your father?

1072
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:06,681
Ooh, I'm sorry. That question
is not in the binder.

1073
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,089
Oh, really? Well, I thought
you were the one that said

1074
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:10,456
we needed to learn all this...

1075
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:12,051
Not about that, I didn't.

1076
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,995
- But if the guy asks us...
- Not about that, Margaret.

1077
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,861
Good night.

1078
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,283
- I like the Psychic Network.
- What?

1079
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:38,082
Not in the "ha-ha, isn't that
funny, she likes that trash"

1080
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,181
kind of way. I actually quite enjoy it.

1081
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,782
Umm...

1082
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,864
I took disco lessons in the sixth grade.

1083
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:55,061
My first concert was
Rob Base & D.J. E-Z Rock.

1084
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,571
I think Brian Dennehy is sexy.

1085
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,307
Don't like flowers in the house,

1086
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:05,644
'cause they remind me of funerals.

1087
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:07,206
Never played a video game.

1088
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,253
<i>I read Wuthering Heights
every Christmas.</i>

1089
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,653
It's my favorite book.

1090
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:20,919
Haven't slept with a man
in over a year and a half.

1091
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:25,493
And, uh... I went to
the bathroom and cried

1092
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:28,561
after Bob called me a poisonous bitch.

1093
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:33,040
And the, uh, bird tattoo?

1094
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:34,475
They're swallows.

1095
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:41,107
Got them when I was 16...
after my parents died.

1096
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:46,579
Stupid.

1097
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,716
I'm sure there's many many other things,

1098
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:51,226
but that's all I can
come up with right now.

1099
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,835
You, uh, there?

1100
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:04,101
I'm here.

1101
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,539
Just processing.

1102
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,549
You really haven't slept
with anyone in 18 months?

1103
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:20,078
Oh, my God. Out of all that,
that's all you got?

1104
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:21,590
That's a long time.

1105
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:23,922
Yeah, well, I've been a little busy.

1106
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,087
Yeah...

1107
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:30,531
Who's, uh...

1108
00:59:30,566 --> 00:59:33,694
- Rob Base and D. J...
- E-Z Rock?

1109
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,499
- Yeah.
- You know.

1110
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:44,210
- No. They were good.
- Mm-mm.

1111
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:52,047
- What?
- Nothing.

1112
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:55,615
I know who they are. I just
wanted to hear you sing it.

1113
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,633
- Margaret?
- Yes?

1114
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:10,972
Don't take this the wrong way.

1115
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:15,372
'K.

1116
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:20,439
You are a very... very beautiful woman.

1117
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,943
- Feel it deep, feel it low.
- Mmm-hmm.

1118
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:52,341
God, I can't sing that high.

1119
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,632
Huh? Where am I?

1120
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,874
What time is it?

1121
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,468
What time is it?

1122
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:26,141
Ooh! Ooh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...

1123
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:40,421
Oh, God.

1124
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:06,452
Room service.
Breakfast for the happy couple.

1125
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:09,014
Andrew! Andrew!

1126
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,993
Andr...

1127
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:13,495
Your mother's at the door. Get up!

1128
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:14,894
- Get up here! Your mother's...
- Oh, God.

1129
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:16,523
Just a second!

1130
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,201
- Not the baby blanket.
- OK, all right.

1131
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,969
Not the baby blanket. Get it
off, get it off, get it off.

1132
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,942
- OK, all right.
- Wait a second. Hold on.

1133
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:29,945
- What? What?
- Are you wearing makeup?

1134
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:31,708
What? No. Of course not.

1135
01:02:31,747 --> 01:02:34,807
- OK, what do we do? All right.
- Just spoon me, spoon me...

1136
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:37,615
- Oh, my God! What is that?
- I'm sorry. It's morning.

1137
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,621
What do you mean, "It's morning"?

1138
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:41,316
Are you OK?

1139
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:44,190
Yep! Coming. One second. Yep.
Come on in. Everything's fine.

1140
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:46,718
Disgusting.

1141
01:02:46,762 --> 01:02:48,559
Ow, you're on my hair. OK, just...

1142
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:57,135
- Oh, wow.
- Ooh, smells good.

1143
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,572
Cinnamon rolls.

1144
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,701
Oh, you shouldn't have
gone to that trouble.

1145
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:03,712
Oh, you're family now. It's no trouble.

1146
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:06,146
Hey, you have room for one more?

1147
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:10,312
Wow. Could we not do the
Brady family meeting right now?

1148
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:11,377
We just got up...

1149
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,819
- Yeah.
...if you don't mind.

1150
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:14,914
Your mother and I have
come up with a proposition

1151
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:18,154
and I happen to think
it's a terrific idea...

1152
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:20,458
We want you
to get married here tomorrow.

1153
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:21,622
Tomorrow.

1154
01:03:23,532 --> 01:03:25,659
- What? What? What?
- Mmm-mmm. No.

1155
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:27,362
Well, you're gonna get married anyway,

1156
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,803
so why don't you get married here...

1157
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,238
...where we can be all together,

1158
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:34,573
and that way Grandma Annie
can be a part of it.

1159
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,771
- Oh. Oh, we're...
- No.

1160
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:40,145
No. No, it's Gammy's
big birthday tomorrow night.

1161
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:41,274
Big day for her.

1162
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,410
We don't want to ruin it.
That's you know...

1163
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:47,183
I've had 89 birthday parties,
I don't need another one.

1164
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,622
Oh, Gammy.

1165
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,126
It would be a dream come true for me

1166
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,526
to see my one grandchild's wedding.

1167
01:03:53,562 --> 01:03:55,826
- A dream come true!
- Mmmm.

1168
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:59,062
- So you'll do it?
- Mmm-mmm.

1169
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:00,762
Before I'm dead?

1170
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:02,202
- OK. OK.
- OK.

1171
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,771
OK, we will do everything.

1172
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:09,369
And you can get married
like we did, in the barn.

1173
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,539
It's a Paxton family tradition.

1174
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:14,276
- Oh, wow!
- Yup.

1175
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:19,619
Wow! Uh! I've always wanted to
get married in a... in a barn.

1176
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:21,987
- I have.
- It's a sign.

1177
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:25,790
A sign from the universe that
you're meant to be together.

1178
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:28,991
Oh, we must give thanks, I tell you.

1179
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:32,159
Come, come. We must give thanks.

1180
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:34,829
OK, I know I should leave you alone now.

1181
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:38,328
But we're just so excited!
I know you're excited, too.

1182
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,274
- It's the craziest.
- Really excited.

1183
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:43,710
Yeah! Go. Go.

1184
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:44,838
Go.

1185
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:52,618
Oh, my God.

1186
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:54,555
When my mom finds out that
this whole thing is a sham

1187
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:55,921
she's gonna... she's gonna be crushed,

1188
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:58,153
and my grandmother's gonna die.

1189
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,821
- Your mom's not going to find out.
- I... my father.

1190
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:01,420
What the hell's with that?
The whole wedding thing?

1191
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:02,488
Where did that come from?

1192
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:04,761
She probably got him worked up into it.

1193
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,028
It's fine. She's not gonna find out.

1194
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,195
- They're not going to find out.
- Oh, God. Margaret!

1195
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:11,695
Andrew, they're not gonna
find out, OK? Just relax.

1196
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,299
It's gonna be OK.

1197
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,833
It's not like we're
gonna be married forever.

1198
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:18,472
We'll be happily divorced
before you know it.

1199
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:22,917
It will be fine. It will be fine.

1200
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:24,510
You OK?

1201
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:26,180
Yeah.

1202
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:33,252
- Get us some coffee.
- Yeah.

1203
01:05:33,295 --> 01:05:36,992
So, would you like a cinnamon soy latte?

1204
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:38,762
A-ha.

1205
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:44,964
You're right, you know...

1206
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:46,304
Get a quickie divorce, we'll be fine.

1207
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:47,969
- Absolutely.
- It's gonna be fine.

1208
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,376
Everything is going to be great.

1209
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:52,313
But this little missus
better learn how to cook...

1210
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:54,179
...so she can take care of her husband.

1211
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:55,342
Keep my man happy.

1212
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:57,113
I don't want him leaving
me for another woman.

1213
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:58,245
Come on...

1214
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,051
...haven't left you yet, Margaret.

1215
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,957
I got it. Let go.

1216
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:08,295
- You all right?
- Yeah, um...

1217
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:09,820
You know what? I'm gonna go.

1218
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:11,162
Where?

1219
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,101
I just kinda feel like going outside.

1220
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,661
All right. That's the bathroom.

1221
01:06:16,705 --> 01:06:18,104
Oh, yeah. I know. I'm just, uh...

1222
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,337
I'm gonna go to go to the bathroom,
and then I'm gonna go out, outside.

1223
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:22,401
All right.

1224
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:24,979
All right.

1225
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:40,827
OK, you just have to focus,
Margaret. Just focus.

1226
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:43,627
This is a business deal.
This is just a business deal.

1227
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:48,433
Everything's
gonna be just fine.

1228
01:06:49,738 --> 01:06:53,640
OK, this is a little
rough. I can do this.

1229
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:57,579
Oh, my God. God, I hate nature!

1230
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:58,944
I hate it.

1231
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:02,382
Not stopping. Not stopping. Oh! Oh...

1232
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:04,386
Why are you not stopping?

1233
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,854
Stop, stop, stop it, stop!

1234
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:13,587
I just wanted... some air.

1235
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:20,424
What is that?

1236
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:25,133
What now? What is that? What is that?

1237
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,608
What is that?

1238
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:42,483
What is that?

1239
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:02,038
Come to me,
Margaret of New York.

1240
01:08:02,077 --> 01:08:04,545
It is I, Grandma Annie.

1241
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,945
Oh!

1242
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:08,472
I see you are a curious one.

1243
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:11,509
Come. See how I give
thanks to Mother Earth.

1244
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:13,954
You know, actually,
I'm not that curious.

1245
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,854
- I'll just...
- Look around you.

1246
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:18,416
Mother Earth has provided all this...

1247
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:22,897
...just as she brought you and
Andrew together to be joined.

1248
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,560
- Oh.
- We must give thanks

1249
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,798
and ask that your loins
be abundantly fertile.

1250
01:08:28,837 --> 01:08:32,295
Come. Dance with me in celebration.

1251
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:35,674
You know, can I, can I
just thank her from here?

1252
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,576
I insist!

1253
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,911
OK, OK, OK.

1254
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,713
I will come down and dance with you.

1255
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:47,716
Follow and learn.

1256
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:55,690
Come on, Margaret! Feel the
rhythm of the drums. Now you.

1257
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:57,255
- Me what?
- Chant.

1258
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,857
Chant what?

1259
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:01,028
Whatever comes
to you. It is the way.

1260
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:04,836
- But I don't know any chants.
- To the trees. Use your vowels.

1261
01:09:04,873 --> 01:09:08,639
- Eee. Ooo. Ooo. Eee.
- Ooo. Eee.

1262
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:10,440
- Yes. Chant.
- Yes. Chant, chant.

1263
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,606
- Eee. To the trees.
- Yes! Yes!

1264
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:16,675
- To the universe!
- The universe. Ah. Universe.

1265
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:20,485
To the crazy.
To the window, the window.

1266
01:09:20,522 --> 01:09:22,183
To the wall, to the wall.

1267
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:23,919
To the sweat drip down my balls.

1268
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,393
- To all you bitches...
- Louder!

1269
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:28,362
To the window, to the window.

1270
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:30,126
To the walls, to the walls.

1271
01:09:30,165 --> 01:09:31,757
To the sweat drip down my balls.

1272
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,064
Now all you bitches crawl.

1273
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:35,764

Gammy! Let's take it

1296
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,350
Oh, uh.

1297
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:26,684
Uh... You know,
your Gammy wanted me to...

1298
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,622
...you know, chant.
Chant from the heart.

1299
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:31,148
Balls? That's what came to your heart?

1300
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:34,924
You know, it went with the beat.

1301
01:10:34,963 --> 01:10:36,726
Your phone arrived.

1302
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:38,323
I'm gonna go into town
to pick it up. Wanna come?

1303
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:41,268
Oh, yes, I want to go.
I want to go. Oh, hold on.

1304
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:44,204
Is it, uh, OK if I go with him?

1305
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,867
Whatever you do is what shall be.

1306
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:49,036
But you're OK if I go?

1307
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,536
- Fine. Go on.
- Bye, Gammy.

1308
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:55,072
- You're a freak!
- Shut up.

1309
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:57,585
Would you, please?

1310
01:10:58,153 --> 01:10:59,177
Ow!

1311
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:18,465
Hey, buddy.

1312
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:20,236
Andrew, hey!

1313
01:11:20,275 --> 01:11:23,244
- You got that phone I ordered?
- Yes, it came in. How are you?

1314
01:11:23,278 --> 01:11:25,178
- Great. You?
- Good.

1315
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:28,572
<i>Hola.</i>

1316
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:32,011
Hey, hi.

1317
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:33,681
Remember this?

1318
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:34,814
Yes, yes.

1319
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:37,417
Wonderful. Wonderful. Yes.

1320
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:40,428
- Remember that?
- Yes. Yes. I know.

1321
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:45,624
Think you made quite
an impression on Ramone.

1322
01:11:45,667 --> 01:11:48,033
Mmm-hmm, I think the part
where I burst into tears

1323
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,697
just really brought us together.

1324
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:51,205
- Yeah. Oh, guess what.
- What?

1325
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,673
Fun fact about Andrew number 11:

1326
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:54,232
- I like Pringles.
- Mm-hmm. OK.

1327
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:55,641
They're delicious. All Hostess products.

1328
01:11:55,677 --> 01:11:57,338
Coke, never Pepsi, and beef jerky.

1329
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:58,641
What, are you, like, 13?

1330
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,272
- Mmm.
- Here we go.

1331
01:12:00,315 --> 01:12:01,543
It's all charged up, Andrew.

1332
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:02,607
Thanks, buddy.

1333
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:06,785
And I put your lady's number in, too.

1334
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,312
- Thank you very mu...
- Milady.

1335
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,651
Thank you, thank you very much.
Thank you.

1336
01:12:13,695 --> 01:12:15,060
Just... thank you.

1337
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:21,895
Oh, my God. I have 37 messages.

1338
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:24,270
Shit. I need a computer.

1339
01:12:24,306 --> 01:12:26,137
Is there, is there a computer
in this godforsaken town?

1340
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:32,976
OK. So when it runs out,
it gives you a warning.

1341
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,346
Just put in more dimes.

1342
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:37,582
- Here you go.
- What?

1343
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:39,553
- You're kidding. Dimes?
- Come on, Kels.

1344
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:41,055
- You're not kidding?
- I'll be outside.

1345
01:12:41,089 --> 01:12:42,420
- Yell if you need me.
- But what am I supposed...

1346
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:44,119
You'll be fine.

1347
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:50,255
OK, I can figure this out.
I'm an intelligent woman.

1348
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:52,733
Block 'em out, block 'em out,
block 'em out. There you go.

1349
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:54,463
OK.

1350
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:56,733
Now.

1351
01:12:56,772 --> 01:12:58,262
What is that? What is it?

1352
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:04,970
Um, uh, excuse me? Excuse...

1353
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:09,810
OK.

1354
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,679
OK.

1355
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:45,113
So, it was nice
to see Gertrude, huh?

1356
01:13:45,153 --> 01:13:46,620
Yeah.

1357
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:48,850
She looked really pretty today.

1358
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,124
- Yeah, she did.
- Mmm-hmm.

1359
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:56,387
Must be nice to see each other
again and just catch up.

1360
01:13:56,431 --> 01:13:58,558
It's definitely good to see her. It's...

1361
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,431
...definitely, yeah.
It's been a long time.

1362
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:04,705
Oh, there they are.
There they are. Margaret!

1363
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,071
Woo!

1364
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,200
We need Margaret.

1365
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:09,802
Afraid we're going to have to
steal you away, young lady.

1366
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:11,369
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm just gonna keep...

1367
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:13,108
No, not to worry.

1368
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:15,480
No strippers, no chanting
in the woods. Promise.

1369
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:17,382
- Oh, well...
- Yeah. Come on.

1370
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:21,253
But not you. It's girl stuff.
You'd hate it.

1371
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,850
- But...
- Come on.

1372
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:25,484
Um, OK. Will I, uh...

1373
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:27,757
...are these shoes OK
for what we're gonna do?

1374
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,065
I can't believe this is happening.

1375
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,694
My mother made this dress by hand.

1376
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:38,502
In this very shop. In 1929.

1377
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,532
It's funny how things
come back in style.

1378
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:43,568
Just... just
finishing up the buttons.

1379
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:45,341
Yeah, and don't worry about the fit

1380
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:48,406
because Annie is the best
tailor in southeast Alaska.

1381
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:49,474
Oh... Pssh.

1382
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:53,411
Wow, incredible.

1383
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:56,015
Maybe a tad loose in certain
areas, but otherwise...

1384
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:59,789
Oh, sorry. I'm a bit
chesty to begin with

1385
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:02,524
and I happened to be
knocked up when I wore this.

1386
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:03,895
Oh.

1387
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:07,231
Oh, let's see if we can find your boobs.

1388
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:12,398
- They're in there somewhere.
- Yes. Yes, they are.

1389
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:14,272
This is like an Easter egg hunt.

1390
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:17,935
Maybe they shrunk up
in the cold Alaskan air.

1391
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:24,818
- Oh! There they are.
- That... yes. That would be...

1392
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:28,380
- There, let's see.
- I was thinking, if you'd like,

1393
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:33,156
maybe we could head down your
way for the holidays this year.

1394
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,390
Oh, that would, uh...
that would be nice.

1395
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:39,924
That'd be nice. Or maybe
we could come to you, too.

1396
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:43,699
- Well, that would be lovely.
- Mmm-hmm.

1397
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:45,900
I would like that very much.

1398
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:48,739
Oh, Grace, for God's sake.
We've got work to do.

1399
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:51,575
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Go make yourself a cup of tea.

1400
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:54,446
I'll finish this. Go.

1401
01:15:54,483 --> 01:16:00,422
Now, let's make this
absolute perfection.

1402
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:08,119
Now, just one special touch
and you're ready.

1403
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:16,668
It's been in the family
for more than 150 years.

1404
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:18,673
Annie, it's beautiful,
but I don't really think...

1405
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:21,369
- Shh. I'm not finished.
- Oh, sorry.

1406
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,902
My great-grandfather gave it
to my great-grandmother

1407
01:16:24,946 --> 01:16:27,107
when they got married.

1408
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:29,208
They were quite a scandal, you know.

1409
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:33,210
He was Russian and she
was Tlingit, and back then

1410
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:36,053
you had to get approval
from every member of the tribe

1411
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:37,422
before you got married.

1412
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:39,017
Almost broke them up.

1413
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:41,996
Well... how did they stay together then?

1414
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:44,726
She was a lot like you. Tough.

1415
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:47,701
Wouldn't take "no" for an answer.

1416
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:51,604
She was good for him.

1417
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,403
I want you to have it.

1418
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:56,934
- I can't. Can't take this.
- I don't want to hear it.

1419
01:16:56,978 --> 01:17:00,607
Grandmothers love to give
their stuff to their grandchildren.

1420
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:03,379
It makes us feel like we'll
still be part of your lives

1421
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:04,817
even after we're gone.

1422
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:07,048
Take it.

1423
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,727
Are... are you all right, dear?

1424
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:19,727
I, uh...

1425
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:24,204
Uh... Well, I, um...

1426
01:17:26,374 --> 01:17:32,108
I, uh... I just, uh, I just wanted to...

1427
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,911
make sure there was enough time
to get all the sewing done.

1428
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:37,919
Don't you worry about that.

1429
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:40,421
- You're gonna be beautiful.
- OK.

1430
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:44,050
- Now let's get you out of those pins.
- OK.

1431
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,308
All right.

1432
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:17,825
This is untied. Hop on in.

1433
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,595
Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1434
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:24,697
Whoa! What...

1435
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:26,291
Mind telling me what the hell's wrong?

1436
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:28,029
I just needed to get
away from everybody.

1437
01:18:28,069 --> 01:18:30,094
- What's wrong?
- Nothing! Just stop talking, please!

1438
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:42,108
Would you mind telling me
what's happening now?

1439
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:43,617
Margaret.

1440
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:48,779
- Margaret!
- I forgot, OK?

1441
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:50,018
You forgot what?

1442
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:52,618
I forgot what it was
like to have a family!

1443
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:55,027
I've been on my own since I was 16

1444
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:57,998
and I forgot what it felt
like to have people love you

1445
01:18:58,033 --> 01:19:00,297
and make you breakfast and say, "Hey!

1446
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:01,927
We'd love to come down
for the holidays."

1447
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:05,462
And I say, "Well, why don't we
come up and see you instead?"

1448
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:07,998
And give you necklaces!
And you have all that here,

1449
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:10,705
and you have Gertrude, and
I'm... I'm just screwing it up!

1450
01:19:10,745 --> 01:19:12,975
You're not screwing it up!
I agreed to this!

1451
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:14,072
You were there, remember?

1452
01:19:14,115 --> 01:19:15,673
Your family loves you. Do you know that?

1453
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,275
- I know that! Yes!
- You know that?

1454
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:18,980
And you're still willing
to put them through this?

1455
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,044
They're not gonna find out!

1456
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,385
How do you know they won't find out?

1457
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,754
Because you said so yourself.

1458
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:24,759
- I know, but what if your mother...
- You said so yourself!

1459
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:25,987
Oh, my God, if your mother found out...

1460
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:28,052
Whoa! Whoa!

1461
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:29,723
- Oh, my God! What if Gammy finds out?
- The boat is moving!

1462
01:19:29,764 --> 01:19:31,197
If Gammy finds out, she's
gonna have a heart attack!

1463
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:33,167
Stop! It's gonna be fine!

1464
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:35,431
- She's gonna have a heart attack!
- Will you calm down! Hold on!

1465
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:37,895
Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

1466
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:41,568
Whoa! I don't think
that hijacking a boat

1467
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:45,205
is a proper way to
express your frustration!

1468
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:46,612
Now... Oh, great.

1469
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:48,980
Now you decide to shut up! Margaret?

1470
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:51,076
- Andrew!
- Margaret?

1471
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,781
- Andrew!
- Margaret!

1472
01:19:57,592 --> 01:19:58,650
I can't swim!

1473
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:00,217
Margaret!

1474
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:01,524
To the buoy!

1475
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:04,031
- What?
- To the buoy!

1476
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:05,957
OK.

1477
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:21,613
All right, come on! Give me your hand!

1478
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,118
Hey! Give me your hand!

1479
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:26,848
Margaret! Give me...

1480
01:20:26,888 --> 01:20:28,412
Come on, give me your hand!

1481
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:29,946
Come on, come on. I got you. I got you.

1482
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:32,482
I got you.

1483
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:36,128
Come on.

1484
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:37,995
What the hell
were you thinking?

1485
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:39,694
Could've gotten yourself killed.

1486
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:43,135
You turned the boat and
made me fall in, you jackass.

1487
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,196
You let go of the steering wheel, Ahab.

1488
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,868
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1489
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:51,208
All right, come here.
You've got to get warm. Come on.

1490
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:55,808
Come on. It's OK.

1491
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:57,010
That's OK.

1492
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:01,650
It's OK.

1493
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,212
I want to talk to both of you.

1494
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:50,931
Your mother is never to
hear about any of this.

1495
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,242
Told you I'd check up on you.

1496
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:07,983
What did you do?

1497
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:09,923
I got a phone call from
Mr. Gilbertson here,

1498
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:12,222
who told me that if you were lying,

1499
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,490
and he strongly believes that you are,

1500
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:16,053
he would send you to prison.

1501
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:18,190
So I flew him up here.

1502
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,258
- Dad.
- Luckily for you,

1503
01:22:20,301 --> 01:22:23,327
your father negotiated
a deal on your behalf.

1504
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:26,602
Now, this offer's
gonna last for 20 seconds,

1505
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:28,370
so listen closely.

1506
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:29,502
You're gonna make a statement

1507
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:31,205
admitting this marriage is a sham...

1508
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:32,543
...or you're gonna go to prison.

1509
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:34,810
You tell the truth, you're off the hook,

1510
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:37,613
and she is going to go back to Canada.

1511
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:45,822
Ah, well. Take the deal.

1512
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:50,263
- I don't think so.
- Don't be stupid, Andrew.

1513
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:52,095
You want a statement?
Here's your statement.

1514
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:53,794
I've been working for
Margaret Tate for three years.

1515
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:56,133
Six months ago we started
dating, we fell in love.

1516
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:58,036
I asked her to marry me, she said "yes."

1517
01:22:58,073 --> 01:23:00,268
I'll see you at the wedding.

1518
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:12,544
Well, you know.

1519
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:37,834
So...

1520
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:40,541
...you sure about this?

1521
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:42,140
Not really.

1522
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,687
I mean, I am very appreciative
of what you've done,

1523
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:49,747
but I think that...

1524
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:50,985
You'd do the same for me.

1525
01:23:51,025 --> 01:23:52,652
Right?

1526
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:56,394
Hope everyone is decent.

1527
01:23:56,431 --> 01:23:57,921
You need to come with me.

1528
01:23:57,966 --> 01:23:59,661
Now, tomorrow
is your wedding day.

1529
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,362
You have to give the
Baby Maker a rest tonight.

1530
01:24:01,402 --> 01:24:03,165
It's tradition.

1531
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:05,195
- Give your bride a kiss good night.
- We're not gonna...

1532
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,468
...use the Baby Maker.

1533
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:08,237
You've got your whole
lives to be together.

1534
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:11,074
- OK.
- Now, come on. Come on.

1535
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:19,580
If I don't go with her,
she's just gonna...

1536
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:23,523
- Come right back.
- Yeah.

1537
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:31,863
See you in the morning?

1538
01:24:32,934 --> 01:24:34,333
Yeah.

1539
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:38,457
Hey, Gammy.

1540
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:42,031
- Thanks, Gammy.
- Oh.

1541
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:53,196
Everyone, please be seated.

1542
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,204
Ramone.

1543
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:08,885
We are gathered here
today to give thanks...

1544
01:27:09,857 --> 01:27:12,485
...and to celebrate...

1545
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:15,087
...one of life's greatest moments.

1546
01:27:15,129 --> 01:27:16,960
To give recognition

1547
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:21,765
to the beauty, honesty,
and unselfish ways

1548
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:24,601
of Andrew and Margaret's true love

1549
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:27,107
in front of family and friends.

1550
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:30,042
For it is their family and friends

1551
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:34,378
who taught Andrew and Margaret to love.

1552
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:39,182
So it is only right that
family and friends are all...

1553
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:44,920
<i>Mi amor. Do you have a question?</i>

1554
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,728
Uh, no...

1555
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:49,252
Your hand is up.

1556
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:55,860
Oh, it, it's, uh, not a question,

1557
01:27:55,903 --> 01:27:58,167
but I do have something I need to say.

1558
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:02,142
- Margaret.
- Can it wait till after?

1559
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:06,704
Uh... No. No.

1560
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:21,994
- Hi there.
- Hi.

1561
01:28:22,029 --> 01:28:24,190
Thank you all so much for coming out.

1562
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:27,395
I, uh... have
a bit of an announcement

1563
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:29,562
to make about the wedding.

1564
01:28:29,604 --> 01:28:32,903
- A confession, actually.
- What are you doing?

1565
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:36,501
Uh... I'm a Canadian. Yes, Canadian.

1566
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:40,708
With an expired visa
who was about to be deported.

1567
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:42,409
And because I didn't want to leave

1568
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,680
this wonderful country of yours,

1569
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:47,654
I forced Andrew here to marry me.

1570
01:28:47,688 --> 01:28:49,121
Margaret, stop it.

1571
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:53,025
See, Andrew has always had
this extraordinary work ethic.

1572
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:56,156
Something I think he learned from you.

1573
01:28:57,465 --> 01:28:59,524
And for three years I
watched him work harder

1574
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:01,535
than anyone else at our company.

1575
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:04,834
And I knew that if I threatened
to destroy his career...

1576
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:08,069
...he would, he would do
just about anything.

1577
01:29:11,646 --> 01:29:15,673
So I blackmailed him to
come up here and to lie to you.

1578
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:20,845
All of you.

1579
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:23,618
And I thought it would
be easy to watch him do it.

1580
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,318
But it wasn't.

1581
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:32,359
Turns out it's not easy
to ruin someone's life

1582
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,028
once you find out
how wonderful they are.

1583
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:43,300
You have a beautiful family.

1584
01:29:45,146 --> 01:29:47,273
Don't let this
come between you.

1585
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:52,616
This was my fault.

1586
01:29:52,653 --> 01:29:54,484
Margaret...

1587
01:29:54,522 --> 01:29:56,422
Andrew, this was a business deal,

1588
01:29:56,457 --> 01:30:00,484
and you held up your end,
but now the deal is off.

1589
01:30:01,762 --> 01:30:03,059
I'm sorry.

1590
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:06,194
And, you, meet me at the dock.

1591
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:08,031
You're giving me a ride to the airport.

1592
01:30:24,852 --> 01:30:27,343
- What were you thinking?
- I don't, I don't know.

1593
01:30:27,388 --> 01:30:28,980
Andrew, you lied to us.

1594
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:30,422
Let me get my head on straight, OK?

1595
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:31,857
I'll explain everything later.

1596
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:34,225
I'm sorry.

1597
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:14,499
<i> You were right.
This book is special.</i>

1598
01:31:14,535 --> 01:31:16,162
<i>I lied because I knew publishing meant</i>

1599
01:31:16,203 --> 01:31:17,465
<i>I'd lose you as an assistant</i>

1600
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:19,735
<i>but... you have an extraordinary eye,</i>

1601
01:31:19,774 --> 01:31:22,800
<i>and I'll make sure we
buy this before I leave.</i>

1602
01:31:22,843 --> 01:31:26,973
<i>Have an amazing life.
You deserve it. Margaret.</i>

1603
01:31:29,216 --> 01:31:32,447
Well, that was, uh... crazy.

1604
01:31:33,854 --> 01:31:36,288
You know, people are gonna be
talking about this forever.

1605
01:31:38,192 --> 01:31:39,819
Yeah. Yeah.

1606
01:31:41,529 --> 01:31:42,655
Are you OK?

1607
01:31:43,898 --> 01:31:46,765
Yeah. No. Uh...

1608
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:52,804
I just feel... You know
what the problem is?

1609
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:56,037
The problem is that this woman...

1610
01:31:56,077 --> 01:31:59,604
...is a gigantic pain in my ass.

1611
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:02,115
First there's the whole leaving
thing. I understand that.

1612
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:04,947
It's a sham wedding.
It's kind of stressful.

1613
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:08,012
But then she goes ahead
and she leaves this note.

1614
01:32:08,055 --> 01:32:09,920
Because she doesn't have the decency...

1615
01:32:09,957 --> 01:32:12,084
the humanity to do it to my face.

1616
01:32:12,126 --> 01:32:17,223
Three years. Three years
I work with this... this terrorist.

1617
01:32:17,264 --> 01:32:18,856
Never once has she had
a nice thing to say,

1618
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:20,764
and then she goes ahead
and she writes this crap!

1619
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:22,564
- Andrew.
- But none of that matters

1620
01:32:22,603 --> 01:32:23,831
because we had a deal!

1621
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:28,069
- Andrew.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

1622
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:29,303
She just makes me a little crazy.

1623
01:32:29,343 --> 01:32:32,779
Yeah. I can see that.

1624
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:36,874
So you're just gonna let her go?

1625
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:52,132
So, what now?

1626
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:55,135
Well... now that
you're leaving voluntarily,

1627
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:57,865
it all becomes very civilized.

1628
01:32:57,905 --> 01:33:00,669
Once we land in New York,
you have 24 hours

1629
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:03,734
to head back to Canada.

1630
01:33:11,118 --> 01:33:13,450
- Andrew, what's happening?
- I got to talk to her.

1631
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:14,715
- Why would you do that?
- Boys!

1632
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:15,779
This has nothing to do with you.

1633
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:16,847
Boys, stop it! Stop it!

1634
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:18,381
I'm not gonna let you do this.

1635
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:19,893
I'm not asking
your permission here.

1636
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:23,124
Annie! Joe! Joe!

1637
01:33:23,164 --> 01:33:26,361
Annie! Joe!

1638
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,392
I think I'm having a heart attack.

1639
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:30,870
- Easy. Easy.
- Somebody get a doctor!

1640
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:32,736
- Easy, easy.
- Get a doctor!

1641
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:37,869
I got it.

1642
01:34:06,407 --> 01:34:08,136
Andrew.

1643
01:34:10,711 --> 01:34:14,112
You two need to stop fighting.

1644
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:16,810
You'll never see eye to eye.

1645
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:21,748
But you're family.

1646
01:34:25,092 --> 01:34:30,029
Promise me you'll stand by Andrew.

1647
01:34:30,064 --> 01:34:32,931
Even if... if you don't agree with him.

1648
01:34:35,302 --> 01:34:36,667
I promise.

1649
01:34:38,606 --> 01:34:41,040
Andrew.

1650
01:34:41,075 --> 01:34:47,036
Promise me you'll work harder
to be a part of this family.

1651
01:34:47,081 --> 01:34:49,106
I will.

1652
01:34:51,752 --> 01:34:54,084
I will, Gammy.

1653
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:59,753
Well, then, the spirits can take me.

1654
01:34:59,794 --> 01:35:01,557
Oh, Annie.

1655
01:35:08,302 --> 01:35:09,963
Gammy?

1656
01:35:16,443 --> 01:35:18,172
I guess they're not ready for me.

1657
01:35:19,413 --> 01:35:21,244
I'm feeling much better, sonny.

1658
01:35:21,282 --> 01:35:23,182
No need to take us
to the hospital.

1659
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:25,014
Take us to the airport, please.

1660
01:35:25,052 --> 01:35:26,883
Mom, what? Are you faking
the heart attack?

1661
01:35:26,921 --> 01:35:28,354
Oh, come on!

1662
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,220
Well, it was the only
way I could get you two

1663
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:32,657
to shut up and get us to the airport!

1664
01:35:32,693 --> 01:35:34,752
Ma'am, we're not authorized
to take you to the airport.

1665
01:35:34,795 --> 01:35:37,764
Larry Ferris, don't
make me call your mother.

1666
01:35:37,798 --> 01:35:39,959
You got it.

1667
01:35:41,535 --> 01:35:43,833
You scared the hell out of me.

1668
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:53,004
Yep. You should've
given up back in New York.

1669
01:35:53,047 --> 01:35:56,278
See, I'm like Eliot Ness.

1670
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:59,411
I always get my man.

1671
01:35:59,453 --> 01:36:02,479
I'm that good.

1672
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:04,650
Flight 1601, as soon
as you're in position,

1673
01:36:04,692 --> 01:36:05,989
you're cleared for takeoff.

1674
01:36:06,026 --> 01:36:07,152
<i> Roger that, Chuck.</i>

1675
01:36:15,202 --> 01:36:17,102
OK. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1676
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:24,868
Tower. Talk to me.

1677
01:36:24,912 --> 01:36:27,005
<i>- Chuck! It's Drew Paxton.
- Hey, dude.</i>

1678
01:36:27,047 --> 01:36:30,039
Hey, uh... I have a little
favor I need from you, buddy...

1679
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:32,143
Margaret's on that plane. I got
to talk to her. Can you stop it?

1680
01:36:32,186 --> 01:36:33,483
<i> Oh, yeah!</i>

1681
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,283
I heard about your lady bailin'.

1682
01:36:35,322 --> 01:36:38,348
<i>- Drag-ola.
-  Chuck! I need you</i>

1683
01:36:38,392 --> 01:36:39,916
to stop the plane. Please.

1684
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:42,827
<i>I can't do that. </i>

1685
01:36:42,863 --> 01:36:46,196
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! Come on!

1686
01:36:47,001 --> 01:36:48,400
Oh, no.

1687
01:36:50,571 --> 01:36:52,266
No!

1688
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:55,941
- What's wrong?
- Margaret's on that plane.

1689
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:58,240
- And he didn't get to tell her.
- Tell her what?

1690
01:36:58,279 --> 01:36:59,746
That he loves her.

1691
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:02,613
So she could tell him
that she loves him, too.

1692
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:03,810
OK, but how does he...

1693
01:37:03,851 --> 01:37:05,216
If she didn't love him,
she wouldn't have left.

1694
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:06,742
Of course not.

1695
01:37:06,787 --> 01:37:08,311
Am I the only one not getting this?

1696
01:37:08,355 --> 01:37:12,223
- Oh, Joe!
- Chuck! Chuck! Look down.

1697
01:37:12,259 --> 01:37:13,726
Oh! Oh. Look down.

1698
01:37:13,761 --> 01:37:16,059
<i>Like... Oh, there you are!</i>

1699
01:37:16,096 --> 01:37:18,223
<i>Sorry, man. There was
nothing I could do.</i>

1700
01:37:20,234 --> 01:37:21,895
Thanks, Chuck.

1701
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:29,238
I'm sorry, son. I didn't
know how you felt about her.

1702
01:37:34,448 --> 01:37:36,040
Honey, it's gonna be OK.

1703
01:38:09,516 --> 01:38:10,983
Jordan?

1704
01:38:29,303 --> 01:38:30,327
Jordan.

1705
01:38:31,705 --> 01:38:33,172
Jordan!

1706
01:38:33,207 --> 01:38:36,540
I need for you to send
the boxes in my office to...

1707
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:38,169
...to this address, please.

1708
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:42,546
This one right here.
This address right here. OK?

1709
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:45,143
- Can you do that?
- Uh, yes. Sure.

1710
01:38:45,185 --> 01:38:47,050
- Good, all right. Thank you.
- Miss Tate.

1711
01:38:47,087 --> 01:38:50,284
Yes. What? What?

1712
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:55,526
Hey.

1713
01:38:56,897 --> 01:38:59,525
Andrew.

1714
01:39:03,337 --> 01:39:05,965
Why are, why are you panting?

1715
01:39:06,006 --> 01:39:08,167
Because I've been running.

1716
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:11,041
- Really. From Alaska?
- I need to talk to you.

1717
01:39:11,078 --> 01:39:12,773
Yeah? Well, I don't have time to talk.

1718
01:39:12,813 --> 01:39:15,213
I need to catch a 5:45 to Toronto.

1719
01:39:15,249 --> 01:39:16,944
- Margaret.
- I need the boxes to go out today.

1720
01:39:16,984 --> 01:39:18,042
I want to make sure everything is...

1721
01:39:18,085 --> 01:39:20,178
Margaret! Stop talking!

1722
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:25,781
Gotta say something.

1723
01:39:25,826 --> 01:39:27,521
- OK.
- This will just take a sec.

1724
01:39:27,561 --> 01:39:29,461
Fine. What?

1725
01:39:30,464 --> 01:39:35,197
Three days ago, I loathed you.

1726
01:39:35,235 --> 01:39:37,430
I used to dream about you
getting hit by a cab.

1727
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:38,768
Or poisoned.

1728
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:42,401
- Oh, that's nice.
- I told you to stop talking.

1729
01:39:42,443 --> 01:39:45,037
Then we had our little
adventure up in Alaska

1730
01:39:45,079 --> 01:39:47,445
and things started to change.

1731
01:39:47,481 --> 01:39:50,143
Things changed when we kissed.

1732
01:39:52,119 --> 01:39:54,053
And when you told me about your tattoo.

1733
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:58,885
Even when you checked me
out when we were naked.

1734
01:39:58,926 --> 01:40:00,291
Uh-huuuh.

1735
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:01,453
Naked?

1736
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:03,463
Well, I didn't see anything...

1737
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:04,862
Yeah, you did.

1738
01:40:04,898 --> 01:40:09,164
But I didn't realize any of
this until I was standing alone.

1739
01:40:09,203 --> 01:40:13,003
In a barn... wife-less.

1740
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,668
Now, you can imagine my disappointment

1741
01:40:15,709 --> 01:40:17,176
when it suddenly dawned on me

1742
01:40:17,211 --> 01:40:21,511
that the woman I love is about
to be kicked out of the country.

1743
01:40:24,118 --> 01:40:25,949
So, Margaret.

1744
01:40:28,188 --> 01:40:29,314
Marry me.

1745
01:40:32,759 --> 01:40:35,250
Because I'd like to date you.

1746
01:40:47,474 --> 01:40:50,807
Trust me. You don't really
want to be with me.

1747
01:40:50,844 --> 01:40:52,573
Yes, I do.

1748
01:40:54,214 --> 01:40:57,206
See, the thing is, there is a reason why

1749
01:40:57,251 --> 01:40:59,845
I've been alone all this time.

1750
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:01,855
I'm comfortable that way.

1751
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:03,914
And I think it would
just be a lot easier

1752
01:41:03,957 --> 01:41:09,987
if we forgot everything
that happened and I just left.

1753
01:41:11,865 --> 01:41:13,457
You're right.

1754
01:41:18,972 --> 01:41:21,566
That would be easier.

1755
01:41:37,357 --> 01:41:40,815
- I'm scared.
- Me, too.

1756
01:42:04,685 --> 01:42:07,620
Aren't you supposed to get down
on your knee or something?

1757
01:42:07,654 --> 01:42:09,178
I'm gonna take that as a "yes."

1758
01:42:09,223 --> 01:42:11,248
Oh, OK.

1759
01:42:25,772 --> 01:42:28,707
Yeah! Show her
who's boss, Andrew!

1760
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:40,446
So, let me see
if I've got this right.

1761
01:42:40,487 --> 01:42:42,921
You two are engaged again.

1762
01:42:42,956 --> 01:42:44,514
- Yes.
- Yes.

1763
01:42:44,558 --> 01:42:46,651
For real?

1764
01:42:47,594 --> 01:42:48,754
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1765
01:42:48,795 --> 01:42:49,853
You're sure you want to
go through with this?

1766
01:42:49,896 --> 01:42:51,022
Because one wrong answer...

1767
01:42:51,064 --> 01:42:54,261
I'm gonna take you down.

1768
01:42:56,637 --> 01:42:59,333
- OK.
- OK.

1769
01:43:00,974 --> 01:43:02,271
Let's do it.

1770
01:43:11,718 --> 01:43:13,242
When did you
first start to date?

1771
01:43:13,287 --> 01:43:15,152
Last week.

1772
01:43:15,188 --> 01:43:18,419
- That going well?
- So far it's great. Thank you.

1773
01:43:18,458 --> 01:43:19,948
What kind of
deodorant does Andrew use?

1774
01:43:19,993 --> 01:43:21,551
Men's Speed Stick?

1775
01:43:21,595 --> 01:43:24,894
What flavor? Musk? Alpine?

1776
01:43:24,931 --> 01:43:26,228
Was it love at first sight?

1777
01:43:26,266 --> 01:43:28,393
No.

1778
01:43:28,435 --> 01:43:32,269
I loved her from the beginning.

1779
01:43:32,306 --> 01:43:33,568
What side of the
bed does Margaret sleep on?

1780
01:43:33,607 --> 01:43:35,336
She sleeps on the left.

1781
01:43:35,375 --> 01:43:36,808
What side of the bed do you sleep on?

1782
01:43:38,845 --> 01:43:43,179
Look, are they soul mates? Eeeh.

1783
01:43:43,216 --> 01:43:45,844
Uh... Will they kill each other? No.

1784
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:47,012
Are you a good driver?

1785
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:49,648
Oh, excellent driver. Excellent.

1786
01:43:53,427 --> 01:43:55,827
Oh.

1787
01:43:55,862 --> 01:43:58,854
In my mind I see her
with someone perhaps...

1788
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:00,799
...more swarthy, darker.

1789
01:44:00,834 --> 01:44:03,462
We don't use the word
"Margaret" around Kevin.

1790
01:44:03,503 --> 01:44:07,803
He still hasn't warmed up to her.

1791
01:44:07,841 --> 01:44:09,536
Margaret.

1792
01:44:09,576 --> 01:44:11,567
Margaret.

1793
01:44:11,611 --> 01:44:13,340
See? It's the damnedest thing.

1794
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:15,007
I have never farted in front of him.

1795
01:44:15,048 --> 01:44:17,448
Nor will I ever fart in front of him.

1796
01:44:17,484 --> 01:44:20,009
She farts in her sleep.

1797
01:44:20,053 --> 01:44:21,953
Would you consider
Margaret a good dancer?

1798
01:44:21,988 --> 01:44:25,219
You can tell by the way
she drinks her soda pop

1799
01:44:25,258 --> 01:44:27,624
that she's a good dancer.

1800
01:44:27,661 --> 01:44:28,889
Uh-huh. How, how...

1801
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:33,366
How is the soda pop
relevant to the dancing?

1802
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,061
I don't understand this.

1803
01:44:35,102 --> 01:44:38,037
- I call him... puppy.
- Pumpkin.

1804
01:44:38,071 --> 01:44:39,732
- Monkey.
- Daisy.

1805
01:44:39,773 --> 01:44:41,968
- Kiddo.
- Uh... Bird.

1806
01:44:42,008 --> 01:44:45,205
Sometimes I call him Rick.

1807
01:44:45,245 --> 01:44:46,712
How do you spell "Ramone?"

1808
01:44:46,747 --> 01:44:49,614
R-A-M-O-N-E.

1809
01:44:49,649 --> 01:44:51,549
Could you do that
again in English, please?

1810
01:44:51,585 --> 01:44:54,452
When you say, you know, the
position in the relationship...

1811
01:44:54,488 --> 01:44:55,853
Top or bottom?

1812
01:44:55,889 --> 01:44:58,858
You're asking me a question
about who's on top?

1813
01:44:58,892 --> 01:45:00,621
You took an oath
when you walked in this office.

1814
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:03,128
I did not take an oath.
When did I take an oath?

1815
01:45:03,163 --> 01:45:04,425
Laura should've
done that, but she didn't.

1816
01:45:04,464 --> 01:45:06,329
- That's OK.
- Who's Laura?

1817
01:45:06,366 --> 01:45:08,698
She's the girl behind you.
Don't look around.

1818
01:45:08,735 --> 01:45:09,997
Which of
the following numbers

1819
01:45:10,036 --> 01:45:12,834
- is not a prime?
- Seventeen.

1820
01:45:12,873 --> 01:45:15,034
I'm sorry. Let me say the list, please.

1821
01:45:15,075 --> 01:45:16,099
I'm sorry?

1822
01:45:16,143 --> 01:45:17,405
He knew
your favorite color.

1823
01:45:17,444 --> 01:45:19,071
- Blue?
- Wrong!

1824
01:45:19,112 --> 01:45:20,636
- Red?
- No!

1825
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:22,204
Dark... Maybe like a hunter green?

1826
01:45:22,249 --> 01:45:23,648
No. White.

1827
01:45:23,683 --> 01:45:24,945
- White?
- OK, moving on.

1828
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:26,384
Favorite color is blue.

1829
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:30,322
What's her favorite color
when she's not at home?

1830
01:45:30,357 --> 01:45:31,756
I don't know.

1831
01:45:31,792 --> 01:45:33,555
Are you a citizen
of this country, Ramone?

1832
01:45:33,593 --> 01:45:37,461
Yes, I'm a citizen!
Are you crazy?

1833
01:45:39,499 --> 01:45:42,400
What relevance a ball in a net

1834
01:45:42,436 --> 01:45:44,370
or a Fruit Roll-Up or a Pop-Tart

1835
01:45:44,404 --> 01:45:46,964
has to do with my
relationship with Andrew?

1836
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:48,531
If you're
getting excited...

1837
01:45:48,575 --> 01:45:51,703
Who are you engaged to?

1838
01:45:51,745 --> 01:45:55,943
- Andrew.
- Very good. Got one right.

1839
01:45:55,982 --> 01:45:57,142
Who are you engaged to?

1840
01:45:57,184 --> 01:45:58,879
I'm engaged to Margaret Tate.

1841
01:45:58,919 --> 01:46:04,380
And on the wedding day,
who will be next to you?

1842
01:46:04,424 --> 01:46:06,722
I'm going to marry Margaret Tate.

1843
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:09,456
- Final answer?
- That work? Yeah, final answer.

1844
01:46:09,496 --> 01:46:12,795
Is this a game show?
I don't understand what...

1845
01:46:19,906 --> 01:46:21,373
That's a great song.

1846
01:46:21,408 --> 01:46:23,137
That was beautiful.
That was really beautiful.

1847
01:46:23,176 --> 01:46:24,837
Mama Cass.

1848
