1
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:07,610
Hey, Nat!

2
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,683
We're both upside down.

3
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,935
And I bet you're gonna fall down first.

4
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,645
No, you will.

5
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,439
You can't hold it much longer.

6
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:49,860
Told you you'd fall down first.

7
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,322
I told you! I told you!

8
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,951
Told you so!

9
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:00,413
Mommy!

10
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,505
What happened?

11
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:12,425
She fell on her knee.

12
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,552
- Oh, you bump your knee?
- Mmm-hmm.

13
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,845
Oh...

14
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:20,808
Kiss it better. There we go.

15
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,936
Oh, come on, little one.

16
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,730
Get up. You're okay.

17
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,899
Come on. You're a brave girl.

18
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,610
Your pain only makes you stronger.

19
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,196
- Right, you?
- Yeah.

20
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,364
- Yeah?
- Look!

21
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,491
Forest stars.

22
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,659
Yeah. You know what?

23
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:42,580
Those are actually
part of the <i>Lampyridae</i> family.

24
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:46,292
And the glow, the glow that you see,

25
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,920
that comes from
a chemical reaction called...

26
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,631
bioluminescence.

27
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,717
Come on, time for dinner.

28
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,094
Bio-goomin-feasants?

29
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,638
"Bio-goomin-feasants."
That's right.

30
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:02,516
Dinner!

31
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,852
Come on, dinner, big girl!

32
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:08,898
I want mac and cheese.

33
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,693
Oh, you want mac and cheese?
Okay. Well, I want...

34
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,779
caviar and champagne.

35
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,781
Grab the napkins.

36
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,325
You take this. Thank you.

37
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,244
Oh, would you grab
the ranch dressing for Dad?

38
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,708
Okay.

39
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,627
Green beans
are my favorite vegetable.

40
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,671
Dad's home!

41
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:36,967
Hey, Dad.

42
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,552
Hey, baby.

43
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,648
Everything okay?

44
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,903
How was everybody's day?

45
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,072
Mommy taught me
about lamp bugs.

46
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,075
- Lamp bugs.
- And I fell and hurt my knee,

47
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,786
- but it doesn't hurt anymore.
- Mmm-hmm.

48
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,955
And we also saw
fireflies in the backyard.

49
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:07,123
That was my favorite part

50
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,249
- of the whole day.
- No.

51
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,709
Yelena,
we see fireflies every year.

52
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:11,794
How long do we have?

53
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,463
I don't know. Like, an hour, maybe.

54
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,009
I don't wanna go.

55
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,180
Don't say that.

56
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,394
Girls...

57
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,023
you remember when I told you that
one day we would have that big adventure?

58
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,903
- Today's the day.
- Yay!

59
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,867
All right, let's go.

60
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,625
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:58,174 --> 00:04:59,758
- Come on, we gotta hurry.
- Thank you.

62
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,010
- I don't have my shoes.
- Thank you, baby.

63
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,803
That's okay. You don't need your shoes.

64
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,222
- But I'm still hungry.
- Yeah? Guess what?

65
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,765
I got Fruit Roll-Ups in the car.

66
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,777
No, leave it, leave it, leave it.
Go wait in the car.

67
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:27,620
- You have it?
- Yeah.

68
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,830
- It's the only copy?
- It's the only one not on fire.

69
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,301
Where are we going?

70
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,261
Home.

71
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,722
Mommy, you're silly.

72
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,474
We just left home.

73
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:01,654
I want my song.

74
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,117
<i>Bye, bye, Miss American Pie</i>

75
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:12,289
<i>Drove my Chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry</i>

76
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,835
<i>Them good old boys
were drinking whiskey and rye</i>

77
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:21,257
<i>Singing, "This'll be the day that I die"</i>

78
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:25,594
<i>"This'll be the day that I die"</i>

79
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,959
Come on, Yelena.
Hurry up, baby.

80
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:59,253
Let's go. Come on, Nat.
Hurry up. We gotta go.

81
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,879
We gotta go.
Come on, you gotta run.

82
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,142
Come on. Honey, honey.

83
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,268
- Go with your mom. Go with your mom.
- Okay.

84
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,811
- Nat, hurry up!
- I'm coming!

85
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,064
Okay. Seat belts.

86
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:22,985
Okay.

87
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,069
Why isn't Dad in the plane?

88
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,529
He's coming. He's coming, baby.
He's coming.

89
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:55,529

90
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,530
Mom?

91
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:19,792
Mom!

92
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,796
I need you up here.

93
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,257
- Okay.
- Okay.

94
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,301
I need you to pull right.

95
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,057
Mom, you've got blood on you.

96
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,225
It's okay, baby.

97
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,954
Hit the accelerator there.

98
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,173
Hold it steady, hold it steady.

99
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,802
You're gonna pull back at 55 knots.

100
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,303
Let's count together.

101
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,931
45, 50...

102
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,738
Pull back.
You can do it!

103
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,948
Pull back.
All your strength.

104
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:19,870
Okay.

105
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,129
Get up, Mommy.

106
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,508
Pain only makes you stronger, remember?

107
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,727
The Red Guardian returns.

108
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,355
The Red Guardian returns triumphant.

109
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,567
Please, please, I beg you.
No more undercover work.

110
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,778
I wanna get back in the action.
I want my suit back.

111
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,946
I wanna get back in it.

112
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,490
General Dreykov,
it's been over three years.

113
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,035
Forgive me mom.

114
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,161
I'm scared.

115
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,913
Never let them take your heart.

116
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,625
Did you get it?

117
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,591
And the North Institute?

118
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,218
Ashes.

119
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,761
It's gonna be okay.

120
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,972
How is Melina?

121
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,432
She'll live. She's strong.

122
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,771
- Mommy?
- Mom?

123
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,898
- Daddy!
- I'll handle this.

124
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,692
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Yelena!

125
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,402
- Daddy!
- Get away from her!

126
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,238
Don't touch her!

127
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,948
I will shoot.

128
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,284
Don't touch her!

129
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,953
I will kill you all!

130
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,788
I will shoot.

131
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,331
Don't touch her.

132
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,624
Honey.

133
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,712
You're gonna need to hand me that gun.

134
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,051
I don't wanna go back there.

135
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,304
I wanna stay in Ohio.

136
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,056
You can't take her.

137
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,184
You can't.

138
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,978
She's only six.

139
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,187
You were even younger.

140
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:12,024
It's okay.

141
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:14,943
Come here.

142
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:20,616
You're gonna be all right.

143
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,369
Do you know why
it's gonna be all right?

144
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,042
'Cause my girls are
the toughest girls in the world.

145
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,253
You're gonna take care
of each other, okay?

146
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,090
And everything,
everything's gonna be fine.

147
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,359
That one, she has fire in her.

148
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,029
What was her name?

149
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,448
Natasha.

150
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,412
Ah... Natasha.

151
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,147
No!

152
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,077
Remove all the defects.

153
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,251
That one

154
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,003
and her.

155
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,587
No!

156
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,755
Yelena!

157
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,096
Take it! Take it! No!

158
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,647
No!

159
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,196
The Red Room is your home now.

160
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,615
Get off me! No!

161
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,889
<i>Under cover spies in our communities.</i>

162
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,725
<i>They took on false identities,
even raised families...</i>

163
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,471
- They're topside, sir!
- Tier 1 has IOS!

164
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,308
We've got all exits covered.

165
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,476
All right. Stay alert.

166
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,312
I'm sending in alpha squad.

167
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,615
Natasha Romanoff is in violation
of the Sokovia Accords.

168
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,700
<i>She assaulted the king of Wakanda.</i>

169
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,160
<i>Make an example out of her.</i>

170
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,168
- Yeah?
- Don't do this.

171
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,544
Do what?

172
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,546
Come after me.

173
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,757
I mean, you're embarrassing yourself.
It looks desperate.

174
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,718
<i>Thought maybe you'd be
calling me to cut a deal.</i>

175
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,554
<i>'Cause from my vantage point,</i>

176
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,014
<i>it's the federal fugitive</i>

177
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,265
who's desperate.

178
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,393
<i>From my vantage point,
you look like you could use some bed rest.</i>

179
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,354
<i>What is this, your second triple bypass?</i>

180
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,731
I wouldn't worry about me.

181
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,150
We got Barton, we got Wilson
and that other guy,

182
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,110
the incredible shrinking convict.

183
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,988
<i>Rogers is on the run.
You got no friends.</i>

184
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,615
Where you gonna go?

185
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,117
I've lived a lot of lives
before I met you, Ross.

186
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,870
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble. I'm done.

187
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,539
Romanoff?

188
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,526
Got an empty nest,
Secretary Ross.

189
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,653
Her tracker, sir.

190
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,383
Eyes on target.
Waiting for the package.

191
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,887
I have sights on collateral one.

192
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,351
Firing in place of three.

193
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,145
Five, four...

194
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,232
She made us.
Target deployed smoke.

195
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,943
She's on foot with the package.
Stay high. I'm going to ground.

196
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,269
Oksana.

197
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,731
Oh, no.

198
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,691
What did I do?

199
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,652
Free the others.

200
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,247
Yelena, we need a status report.

201
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,628
<i>Yelena,
we need a status report.</i>

202
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,804
Converge on team leader.

203
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,061
<i>General Dreykov,
we have a deserter.</i>

204
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:13,648
<i>Permission to activate
Taskmaster Protocol?</i>

205
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:38,965
Smile.

206
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,158
After the Sokovia Accords

207
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,785
the hunt is on
for the remaining Avengers...

208
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:12,499
Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff
are currently on the run.

209
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,666
You're in my bed.

210
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,793
I'm... I'm not even under the covers.

211
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,086
Did you get everything on my list?

212
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:03,466
Got passports, entry visas,
a couple of local driver's licenses.

213
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:07,053
Mix and match, you should be able to
stretch it to 20 or so identities.

214
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:08,846
Fanny Longbottom?

215
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,807
- What?
- What, are you 12?

216
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:14,561
That is a legitimate name.

217
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:17,021
We've got a generator outside.

218
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:20,149
It's petrol-powered. And the septic tank
will need a flush in a couple of weeks,

219
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,985
but, you know,
I've got a guy coming for that.

220
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,071
You have to haul your rubbish into town.
It's just a 20-minute drive.

221
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:28,283
I've got your basic hardware kit
stashed under the stairs.

222
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:29,951
Nice.

223
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:31,869
Are you okay?

224
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,162
Why wouldn't I be?

225
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,249
I hear things. You know, something
about the Avengers getting divorced...

226
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,543
Ugh. It's fine.

227
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,253
I'm actually better on my own.

228
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,421
Are you sure?

229
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,172
Yeah.

230
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,882
Because you can tell me, you know.

231
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,718
That's the way
the whole friends thing works.

232
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,721
I know. I have friends.

233
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,765
People who have friends don't call me.

234
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,898
And I don't pay you to worry.

235
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,332
Oh, hey.

236
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,626
What's all this junk?

237
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,879
Oh, just some mail and personals
from the Budapest safe house.

238
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:24,797
Budapest?

239
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,966
Yeah. Budapest.

240
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,302
- No, it's "Budapest."
- Budapest.

241
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,553
Budapest.

242
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,805
- It's "Budapest." Sh.
- Whatever.

243
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,184
I knew you weren't going back there,
so I've got someone else in the flat now.

244
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,645
Sorry you went through the trouble.
I would've told you to chuck it.

245
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,938
Well, if you don't want it,
throw it in the rubbish.

246
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:08,466
<i>You're not
a sportsman, Mr. Bond.</i>

247
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,343
Why did you break up the encounter

248
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:11,511
with my pet python?

249
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:14,138
Because I discovered
he had a crush on me.

250
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:18,601
Moonraker 1
<i>on preset launch program...</i>

251
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,769
Oh, great.

252
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,396
<i>...minus two minutes.</i>

253
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:22,980
<i>Retract crew access...</i>

254
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:05,792
I'm pretty sure Ross
has no jurisdiction here.

255
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,047
And you should know I'm a better shot
when I'm pissed off.

256
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:15,862
You're not here for me.

257
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,097
Oh, shit.

258
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,488
I know you're out there.

259
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,284
I know you know I'm out here.

260
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,585
Then why are you skulking about
like it's a minefield?

261
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,712
'Cause I don't know
if I can trust you.

262
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,798
Funny,
I was going to say the same thing.

263
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:28,012
So, we gonna talk
like grown-ups?

264
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:31,724
Is that what we are?

265
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,778
Put it down before I make you.

266
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,029
You put yours down.

267
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:48,365
Watch your step.

268
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,721
Stay down. Stay down.

269
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:13,307
Stay down.

270
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,906
Stop.

271
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:15,452
Truce.

272
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:28,424
You've grown up.

273
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,347
No shit.

274
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,186
You had to come
to Budapest, didn't you?

275
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:43,480
I came here
because I thought you wouldn't.

276
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:47,359
But since you're here,
what bullet does that?

277
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:51,780
Not bullets. Arrows.

278
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,032
Ah, right.

279
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,368
If you didn't think I'd come here,
why'd you send me this?

280
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,412
You brought it back here?

281
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,459
I'm not here trying to be your friend,
but you need to tell me what that is.

282
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:05,044
It's a synthetic gas.

283
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:07,588
The counter agent to chemical subjugation.

284
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:09,465
The gas immunizes
the brain's neuropathways

285
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,549
from external manipulation.

286
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,009
Maybe in English next time?

287
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,261
It's an antidote to mind control.

288
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:15,638
Real mature.

289
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,641
Why don't you take it
to one of your super-scientist friends?

290
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:19,934
They can explain it to you.

291
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,602
Tony Stark, maybe?

292
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,271
Oh, yeah. We're not really
talking right now, so...

293
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:26,398
Great. Perfect timing.

294
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,651
Where's an Avenger when you need one?

295
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:29,818
I don't wanna be here.

296
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,238
I'm on the run.
You could've gotten me killed.

297
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,989
Well, what was I supposed to do?

298
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:37,076
You're the only superhero person
that I know.

299
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,038
That was the whole reason
I sent it to you.

300
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,584
I kept checking the news,

301
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:50,172
expecting to see Captain America
bringing down the Red Room.

302
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:55,344
What?

303
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,889
Taking down the Red Room?
What are you talking about?

304
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,641
It's been gone for years.

305
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,643
Dreykov's dead.

306
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:04,186
I killed him.

307
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,438
You don't actually believe that, do you?

308
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:13,153
You really do believe that.

309
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,738
Dreykov's dead.

310
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,157
It took almost destroying the entire city
just to get to him.

311
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:18,909
If you're so sure,
then tell me what happened.

312
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:20,703
Tell me exactly.

313
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:22,663
We rigged bombs.

314
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,331
- Who's "we"?
- Clint Barton.

315
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:27,543
Killing Dreykov was the final step
in my defection to S.H.I.E.L.D.

316
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,088
Simple as that?

317
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,175
Yeah, sure, "simple."

318
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,678
That's what I'd call imploding
a five-story building

319
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:40,931
and then shooting it out
with the Hungarian Special Forces.

320
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:44,143
Took 10 days in hiding
before we could even get out of Budapest.

321
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,894
And you checked the body?

322
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,646
Confirmed the kill?

323
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,985
There was no body left to check.

324
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:56,780
You're forgetting Dreykov's daughter.

325
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,716
Where are we trying to get?

326
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,885
Motorbike! East side
of the building.

327
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,180
They're going east, to the roof.

328
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,306
Copy, in pursuit.

329
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,292
I got you!

330
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,005
No!

331
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,775
Hey.

332
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:58,986
Don't move. You're hurt.

333
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:00,362
Let me help you.

334
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,463
I don't wanna do this.

335
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:21,758
- What are you doing?
- He's making me.

336
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:53,624
Do you believe me now?

337
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,543
How many others?

338
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,086
Enough.

339
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:11,892
Which one's yours?

340
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:13,477
Black. Brown seat.

341
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:15,521
Where are my keys?

342
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:18,273
...ah, bitch.

343
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:20,984
Any day now.

344
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:01,149
Are you okay?

345
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:02,276
Fantastic.

346
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,735
You can't just steal a guy's car.

347
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,737
So you want me to chase him down
and un-steal it?

348
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,868
- Okay. Any time now, please.
- Shut up.

349
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:47,571
Okay, you got a plan,

350
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:49,197
or shall I just stay duck-and-cover?

351
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,657
Yeah, my plan was to drive us away.

352
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:52,200
That's a shit plan.

353
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,089
You're welcome.

354
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,646
Oh, shit. He's back.

355
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:34,284
Put your seat belt on.

356
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:35,661
You're such a mom.

357
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,111
Natasha, no.

358
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:11,321
I think I'm bleeding. I'm...

359
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,283
No. Not now, trust me.

360
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:08,837
You okay?

361
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:11,715
Yeah. Great plan.

362
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:15,469
I love the part
where I almost bled to death.

363
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,430
This is cozy.

364
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:21,183
Barton and I spent two days
hiding out up here.

365
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:22,934
That must have been fun.

366
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,062
Who the hell is that guy?

367
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,606
Dreykov's special project.

368
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:30,150
He can mimic anyone he's ever seen.

369
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:31,443
It's like fighting a mirror.

370
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:34,279
Dreykov only deploys him
for top-priority missions.

371
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,114
This doesn't make any sense.

372
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:39,743
Well, the truth rarely makes sense
when you omit key details.

373
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:42,871
What is that supposed to mean?

374
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:44,998
You didn't say one word
about Dreykov's daughter.

375
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,709
You killed her.

376
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,753
I had to.

377
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:52,714
I needed her to lead me to Dreykov.

378
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,551
<i>We need confirmation
Dreykov's in the building.</i>

379
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,596
His car is pulling up now.

380
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:19,574
Dreykov's daughter was collateral damage.

381
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:23,411
I needed her to be sure.

382
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,121
<i>Natasha, we clear?</i>

383
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:28,416
All clear.

384
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:35,048
And here you are, not so sure.

385
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,717
I needed out.

386
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,026
The Red Room's still active. Where is it?

387
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,194
I have no idea.

388
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:59,114
He moves location constantly.

389
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:03,743
And every widow is sedated
on entry and exit for maximum security.

390
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:08,456
I'm just finding it hard to believe
that he could stay off my radar.

391
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:12,168
Well, it's not smart to attack an Avenger
if you want to stay hidden.

392
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,504
I mean, the clue is in the name.

393
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:15,964
Dreykov kills you,

394
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:18,884
one of the big ones comes to avenge you.

395
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,385
Wait, what are the big ones?

396
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:24,931
Well, I doubt the god from space
has to take an ibuprofen after a fight.

397
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:29,603
Where did you think I was all this time?

398
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:36,693
I thought that you got out
and were living a normal life.

399
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,113
And you just never made contact again?

400
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,157
Honestly, I thought
you didn't wanna see me.

401
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,868
Bullshit.

402
00:45:45,035 --> 00:45:47,704
You just didn't want
your baby sister to tag along,

403
00:45:47,871 --> 00:45:49,581
whilst you saved the world
with the cool kids.

404
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:51,708
You weren't really my sister.

405
00:45:55,045 --> 00:45:57,589
And the Avengers
aren't really your family.

406
00:45:58,298 --> 00:46:00,133
- Why do you always do that thing?
- Do what?

407
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,761
The thing you do when you're fighting.

408
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:05,263
The... Like, the...

409
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:08,183
This thing that you do

410
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,393
when you whip your hair
when you're fighting

411
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,020
with the arm and the hair.

412
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,522
And you do, like,
a fighting pose.

413
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:16,149
It's a...

414
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,026
It's a fighting pose.
You're a total poser.

415
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:20,111
I'm not a poser.

416
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:22,113
Oh, come on.
I mean, they're great poses,

417
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,950
but it does look like
you think everyone's looking at you, like,

418
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,117
all the time.

419
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:29,621
All that time that I spent posing,
I was trying to actually do something good

420
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:33,208
to make up for all the pain
and suffering that we caused.

421
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,752
Trying to be more
than just a trained killer.

422
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,049
Well, then you were fooling yourself

423
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:45,553
because pain and suffering is every day
and we are both still a trained killer.

424
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:48,932
Except I'm not the one
that's on the cover of a magazine.

425
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:51,309
I'm not the killer
that little girls call their hero.

426
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:10,829
That gas,

427
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:13,248
the counter agent,

428
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,166
it was synthesized in secret

429
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:18,003
by an older widow
from Melina's generation.

430
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:21,548
I was on the mission to retrieve it,
and she exposed me

431
00:47:21,715 --> 00:47:25,552
and I killed the widow that freed me.

432
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:27,303
Did you have a choice?

433
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,265
What you experienced
was psychological conditioning.

434
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:34,811
I'm talking about chemically
altering brain functions.

435
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:37,188
They're two completely different things.

436
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:41,609
You're fully conscious,
but you don't know which part is you.

437
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,403
I'm still not sure.

438
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:54,873
- Is that all there is left?
- Mmm-hmm.

439
00:47:55,832 --> 00:48:00,045
It's the only thing that can stop Dreykov
and his network of widows.

440
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,132
He takes more every day.

441
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,093
Children who don't have anyone
to protect them.

442
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,511
Just like us when we were small.

443
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:11,639
Maybe one in 20 survives the training,
becomes a widow.

444
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,183
The rest, he kills.

445
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,144
To him, we are just things.

446
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,565
Weapons with no face
that he can just throw away.

447
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,486
Because there is always more.

448
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:28,323
And no one's even looking for him,
thanks to you and Alexei.

449
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,116
Alexei?

450
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,328
"Dad."

451
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:46,925
Did you ever look
for your parents? Your real ones?

452
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:52,764
Well, my mom abandoned me
in the street like garbage.

453
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:57,268
What about you?

454
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:01,940
They destroyed my birth certificate,
so I reinvented it.

455
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:05,068
My parents still live in Ohio.

456
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:08,071
My sister moved out west.

457
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,155
Is that right?

458
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:10,865
You're a science teacher.

459
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:15,870
You're working part-time, though,
especially after you had your son.

460
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:18,706
Your husband, he renovates houses.

461
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:21,167
That is not my story.

462
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:23,044
What is your story?

463
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:30,009
I never let myself be alone
long enough to think about it.

464
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,933
Did you ever wish for kids?

465
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:42,272
I want a dog.

466
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,946
Where you gonna go?

467
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:51,698
I don't know.

468
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:56,452
I don't really have
anywhere to go back to,

469
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:58,121
so I guess anywhere.

470
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:06,462
- Don't.
- Don't what?

471
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:09,090
You're going to
give me some big hero speech,

472
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:10,175
I can feel it.

473
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:13,094
Speeches aren't really my thing.

474
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:14,179
Huh.

475
00:50:14,888 --> 00:50:16,556
It was more like an invitation.

476
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:20,185
To go to the Red Room and kill Dreykov?

477
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:21,811
Yeah.

478
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:24,230
Even though the Red Room
is impossible to find

479
00:50:24,314 --> 00:50:26,357
and Dreykov is too slippery to kill?

480
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:27,567
Yeah.

481
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:30,570
That sounds like a shitload of work.

482
00:50:30,904 --> 00:50:31,946
Yup.

483
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,951
Could be fun, though.

484
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:39,370
Yup.

485
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:47,420
I saw where he put the keys.

486
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:51,007
Top drawer, green cabinet.

487
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:03,019
You know, this is
the first piece of clothing

488
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,604
I've ever bought for myself.

489
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:07,982
That?

490
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:09,567
Yeah. You don't like it?

491
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,277
Is that like a...

492
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,363
Is it army surplus, or...

493
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:14,989
Okay, it has a lot of pockets.

494
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,700
But I use them all the time,

495
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:20,078
and I made some of my own
modifications.

496
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:21,871
- Oh, yeah?
- Whatever.

497
00:51:21,955 --> 00:51:24,249
Shut up. The point is, I've never...

498
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:27,710
I've never had control
over my own life before, and now I do.

499
00:51:27,877 --> 00:51:29,545
I want to do things.

500
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,506
Hmm...

501
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:32,966
I like your vest.

502
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:35,843
I knew it. I knew you did.
It's so cool, right?

503
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,136
It's good. Yes. I like it.

504
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:40,682
And you can put so much stuff in there.
You wouldn't even know.

505
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:46,813
I really don't know where
the Red Room is, though.

506
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:48,982
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

507
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:51,985
But I think I know somebody who does.

508
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:53,152
Oh, yeah? Who?

509
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,488
We're gonna need a jet.

510
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,616
I said we needed a jet.

511
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:01,536
Yeah, you know what you didn't give me?
Time.

512
00:52:01,703 --> 00:52:03,288
Or money. I'm not made of jets.

513
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:04,956
I thought you were
supposed to be the best.

514
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,040
Like a real pro.

515
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:07,417
Oh, I beg your pardon, tsarina.

516
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,377
Was the free flat
and lifetime supply of kissel

517
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,129
- not to your liking?
- Ha!

518
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,880
Don't let her wind you up.

519
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,466
No, I take exception
to impugning my professionalism.

520
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:19,470
Well, you did set me up with a generator
that crapped out after six hours.

521
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:21,889
You, too, huh? Tag team.

522
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:25,143
Aw, he's sensitive.
See why you keep him around.

523
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:26,769
Where's the rest?

524
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,610
Voilà.

525
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:36,446
Ooh.

526
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:39,157
Oh, I stashed that, like, five years ago.

527
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:42,493
How is it?

528
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,872
It's dry.
It's really dry.

529
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:53,004
You know, you're getting dangerously close
to running out your tab.

530
00:52:54,339 --> 00:52:57,133
Supplies I can tally, but you bring me
attention from the authorities,

531
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:58,843
all my prices go up.

532
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:01,971
What's that supposed to mean?

533
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:05,183
Your mate, Secretary Ross,
has been sniffing around my affairs

534
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,311
to the point at which I've got
contacts declining my calls.

535
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:10,396
I'm a private contractor.

536
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,399
You are sensitive.

537
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:15,109
You're a very annoying individual.

538
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:19,238
- I'll make it up to you.
- Mmm-hmm.

539
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:22,158
That's what you say every time.

540
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,625
So, I have the nuclear code.

541
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:34,253
But there he is.

542
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:38,966
- Captain America!
- America.

543
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:45,264
Finally, the Red Guardian's time has come!

544
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,643
I grab hold of his shield

545
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:54,524
and face to face, it's a test of strength.

546
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,823
Oh... Oh, no.

547
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,700
Oh...

548
00:54:06,786 --> 00:54:08,204
That guy think he going to beat me.

549
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:10,873
Anyway, this shield, you know,
that he carries with him

550
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,835
like a precious baby blanket, you know?

551
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,170
I use it to my advantage.
I take it

552
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:17,422
and I push him out the window.

553
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:20,049
And I make my escape. Huh?

554
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:22,260
What year was this?

555
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:25,888
I don't know.
Like, '83, '84.

556
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:27,056
I know.

557
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:30,435
Captain America was
still frozen in ice then.

558
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:36,774
Are you calling me a liar, Ursa, huh?

559
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:49,078
Alexei Shostakov! Mail Call.

560
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:51,789
Oh, no.

561
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:53,958
Uh-oh.

562
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,751
Alexei Shostakov! Mail Call.

563
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:57,462
Aw, look at the big bear.

564
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,297
Gonna cry, little girl?

565
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:16,063
The famed "Red Guardian."

566
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:21,652
When you write back, tell your
fans to use more butter.

567
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,488
Take it!

568
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:24,614
Come on.

569
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,644
Red Guardian forward!

570
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:55,937
The trumpet is calling!

571
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:14,163
Today is your lucky day, Alexei.

572
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,251
Move to the door on the south wall.

573
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:28,261
What's up with you?

574
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:29,595
Can't you read?

575
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:41,315
Go left.

576
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:43,818
Just don't make a scene.

577
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:49,782
The Red Guardian is escaping!

578
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,252
You made a scene, didn't you?

579
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:14,890
What now?

580
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,892
<i>We're gettin' you outta here.</i>

581
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:39,123
Go to the upper level.

582
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:44,128
<i>Move your ass, super soldier.</i>

583
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,683
He's never going to make it.

584
00:57:58,059 --> 00:57:59,268
Get me closer.

585
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:01,812
You got a better idea?

586
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,026
Natasha.

587
00:58:18,788 --> 00:58:20,206
Such a poser.

588
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:46,273
Seriously?

589
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:48,859
Whoo!

590
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,736
Sorry!

591
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:55,116
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?

592
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:56,951
Back up!

593
00:58:57,535 --> 00:58:59,787
We're both doing
a really good job.

594
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:10,923
No.

595
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:14,719
Okay. Enough of this.

596
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,361
Ha!

597
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:42,246
Whoa...

598
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:49,420
This would be a cool way to die.

599
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:55,468
Tell me that's a good sign for us!

600
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:56,761
Move your ass!

601
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:22,828
Get us outta here!

602
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:24,622
Huh.

603
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:10,417
Wait!

604
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:37,903
Yes!

605
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,449
I need some help up here!

606
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:49,373
Farewell, douche bags.

607
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:57,339
Oh, that was exciting.

608
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:02,553
Oh, I'm so proud of you girls.

609
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:06,140
Oh, you can't hear me, huh?

610
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,309
Okay.

611
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:11,520
Ah...

612
01:02:12,146 --> 01:02:13,147
Wow.

613
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,193
Okay.

614
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:21,280
Why the aggression, huh?

615
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:23,532
Is it your time of the month?

616
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:27,119
I don't get my period, dipshit.
I don't have a uterus.

617
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:28,495
Or ovaries.

618
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:30,956
Yeah. That's what happens
when the Red Room

619
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,458
gives you an involuntary hysterectomy.

620
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:37,171
They kind of just go in and they rip out
all of your reproductive organs.

621
01:02:37,338 --> 01:02:40,799
They just get right in there
and they chop them all away.

622
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,802
- Everything out, so you can't have babies.
- Okay, okay. Okay! Okay!

623
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:46,472
You don't have to get
so clinical and nasty.

624
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:48,140
Oh, well, I was about to talk about

625
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:50,476
- fallopian tubes, but okay.
- No.

626
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:56,857
It means so much to me
that you came back for me.

627
01:02:57,024 --> 01:03:00,611
No. No. You're gonna tell us
how to get to the Red Room.

628
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:02,279
Huh.

629
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:04,156
Whoa, look at you, huh? All business.

630
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:05,741
Trust me, this isn't pleasure.

631
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:09,954
Little Natasha,
all indoctrinated into the Western agenda.

632
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:13,248
I chose to go west to become an Avenger.

633
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:15,376
'Cause they treated me like family.

634
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,378
Really? Family?

635
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:19,838
Well, where are they now?

636
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:22,675
Where is that family now?

637
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:24,843
Tell me where the Red Room is.

638
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:29,974
I have no idea.

639
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:31,225
Okay?

640
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:37,856
Come on. You and Dreykov were like...

641
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,024
- Dreykov?
- Yeah.

642
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:41,527
General Dreykov, my friend, huh?

643
01:03:42,111 --> 01:03:44,029
Gives me glory...

644
01:03:44,196 --> 01:03:47,199
Soviet Union's first
and only super soldier.

645
01:03:47,366 --> 01:03:50,536
I could have been more famous
than Captain America.

646
01:03:50,703 --> 01:03:54,123
Then he buries me in Ohio
on that stupid mission.

647
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:55,708
Three years!

648
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:58,836
So tedious, boring me to tears.

649
01:04:01,797 --> 01:04:03,257
No offense, huh?

650
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:06,760
Then puts me in prison
for the rest of my life. Why, huh?

651
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:08,303
Why? Why would he put me in...
You know why?

652
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,140
'Cause maybe I want to talk
about the withering of the state.

653
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:12,891
Or maybe I don't like
his hair or something

654
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:14,226
and I say something casually about that.

655
01:04:14,393 --> 01:04:15,394
Maybe, you know,

656
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:17,521
I want the Party
to feel actually like a party

657
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:20,065
instead of this sourpuss organization.

658
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:22,401
But instead, no.

659
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:25,571
He puts me in prison
for the rest of my life.

660
01:04:25,738 --> 01:04:27,865
He just runs off and hides, huh?

661
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:31,785
I'm not even the one who, uh, you know...

662
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:35,789
I'm not the one who killed his daughter.

663
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:38,917
Can we throw him
out the window now?

664
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,003
I think we should wait
till we get to a higher altitude.

665
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:42,087
All right.

666
01:04:42,171 --> 01:04:44,590
Why not ask Melina where it is?

667
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:45,966
Wait, Mom Melina?

668
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,135
We thought she was dead.

669
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:51,013
You cannot kill a fox that swift.

670
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:52,347
- Ew.
- What?

671
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:57,102
She was the scientist, the strategist.
I was the muscle.

672
01:04:57,269 --> 01:04:59,772
She worked directly for Dreykov
far more than I ever did.

673
01:04:59,855 --> 01:05:03,400
Wait. Are you telling me that Melina
is working for the Red Room present day?

674
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,819
She works remotely outside St. Petersburg.

675
01:05:05,903 --> 01:05:07,738
Uh...

676
01:05:08,072 --> 01:05:10,657
I don't think we have enough
fuel for St. Petersburg.

677
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,409
No, we're good. We'll make it.

678
01:05:13,035 --> 01:05:14,036
Okay.

679
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:36,600
You should've brought
the Avengers' super jet.

680
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:42,731
I swear, if I hear
one more word from him,

681
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:44,733
- I will kick him in the face.
- He's the worst.

682
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:46,819
Natasha.

683
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:48,362
Natasha. Natasha.

684
01:05:48,529 --> 01:05:51,448
Come here, I want to ask you something.

685
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,534
- Come, it's important.
- What?

686
01:05:57,996 --> 01:05:59,623
Did he talk to you about me?

687
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,000
What?

688
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:06,171
Did he talk to you about me?
You know, trading war stories?

689
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:07,339
Who? What are you talking about?

690
01:06:07,506 --> 01:06:09,758
Captain America.

691
01:06:09,925 --> 01:06:14,888
My great adversary
in this theater of geopolitical conflict.

692
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:16,890
Not so much a nemesis.

693
01:06:16,974 --> 01:06:18,976
More like a contemporary, you know?
Coequal.

694
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:21,353
I always thought there was
a great deal of mutual respect...

695
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,564
Wait. You haven't seen
either one of us in 20 years

696
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,274
and you're gonna ask me about you?

697
01:06:26,525 --> 01:06:28,569
What is with this tension?

698
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:31,822
Did I do something wrong?

699
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:34,992
Is that a serious question?

700
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:38,245
I only ever loved you girls.

701
01:06:38,871 --> 01:06:40,914
I did my best to make sure
you would succeed

702
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:42,916
to achieve your fullest potential,

703
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,751
- and everything worked out.
- Everything worked out?

704
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:47,296
Yes. For you, yes.

705
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:51,425
We accomplished our mission in Ohio.

706
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:54,970
Yelena, you went on to become
the greatest child assassin

707
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:56,346
the world has ever known.

708
01:06:56,513 --> 01:07:00,475
No one can match your efficiency,
your ruthlessness.

709
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:02,603
And Natasha,

710
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:07,649
not just a spy,
not just toppling regimes,

711
01:07:07,816 --> 01:07:09,943
destroying empires from within,

712
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,279
but an Avenger.

713
01:07:13,197 --> 01:07:16,158
You both have killed

714
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:18,702
so many people.

715
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:22,956
Your ledgers must be dripping,
just gushing red.

716
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:25,709
I couldn't be more proud of you.

717
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:31,465
Okay. You can... No.

718
01:07:31,632 --> 01:07:33,383
Let go of me now.

719
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,344
You smell really bad.

720
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,226
So, are we there yet?

721
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,436
You'll know when we're there.

722
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:48,148
Slight right.

723
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:50,692
Straight on.

724
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:52,527
Right.

725
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,156
Slight right.

726
01:07:57,074 --> 01:07:59,493
Oh, very good, my darling.

727
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:02,829
Yes, very good.

728
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:06,083
Yes, very good, my darling.

729
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:21,723
Back home where it's safe.
Come on. Go on.

730
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:13,567
Honey, we're home.

731
01:09:24,745 --> 01:09:26,496
Come on, girls.

732
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:39,301
Welcome to my humble abode.

733
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,720
Make yourself at home.

734
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:45,932
Let's have a drink.

735
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,449
Hey, no funny business.

736
01:10:03,617 --> 01:10:05,869
I am putting away my weapon.

737
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:30,936
Are there
any booby traps around here?

738
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:32,104
Anything we need to know about?

739
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,897
I didn't raise my girls to fall in traps.

740
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:35,816
You didn't raise us at all.

741
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:39,444
Oh, maybe so.

742
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:43,115
But if you got soft,
it wasn't on my watch.

743
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,347
Let's drink.

744
01:11:09,224 --> 01:11:10,434
Okay.

745
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:22,988
Still fits.

746
01:11:24,531 --> 01:11:26,199
Oh, my God.

747
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:30,620
I never washed it once.

748
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:32,372
Come and drink.

749
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,336
<i>Rise, you workers of salvation</i>

750
01:11:41,423 --> 01:11:43,216
Family

751
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:45,844
back together again.

752
01:11:46,428 --> 01:11:48,638
- Mmm.
- Seeing as our

753
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:49,890
family construct

754
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:52,851
was just a calculated ruse
that only lasted three years,

755
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:57,355
I don't think that we can use
this term anymore, can we?

756
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:59,983
Agreed. So, here's what's gonna happen...

757
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:03,278
Okay. A reunion then, huh?

758
01:12:03,445 --> 01:12:04,529
And, uh...

759
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,115
I want to say something
right off the bat.

760
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:09,409
You haven't aged a day, huh?

761
01:12:09,576 --> 01:12:14,706
You're just as beautiful and as supple
as the day they staged our marriage.

762
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:17,667
You got fat.

763
01:12:18,335 --> 01:12:20,962
But still good.

764
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:23,882
I just got out of prison. I, uh...

765
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,344
- I have a lot of energy.
- Oh!

766
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:29,346
Please don't do that.

767
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:33,433
So, here's what's gonna happen.

768
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,018
Natasha, don't slouch.

769
01:12:35,936 --> 01:12:37,896
- I'm not slouching.
- Yes, yes, you are.

770
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:38,980
I don't slouch.

771
01:12:39,064 --> 01:12:40,190
You're going to get a back hunch.

772
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:41,608
- Listen to your mother.
- Oh, my God, this...

773
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:42,692
Up, up.

774
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:44,194
All right, enough. All of you.

775
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:46,112
I didn't say anything.
That's not fair.

776
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:47,781
- Here's what's gonna happen...
- I don't want any food.

777
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:49,950
Eat a little something,
Yelena, for God's sake.

778
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:51,785
You're gonna tell us
the location of the Red Room.

779
01:12:55,664 --> 01:12:58,500
You know, it's like when you told them

780
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,710
that they could stay up late
to catch Santa Claus.

781
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:02,963
What? That was fun. You know,
"He come down the chimney, girls.

782
01:13:03,046 --> 01:13:04,381
"Look out. Where is he?"

783
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:07,342
You wait for him,
and then when the cookies are gone,

784
01:13:07,509 --> 01:13:09,386
then you see he's there.

785
01:13:09,553 --> 01:13:11,429
No, no. What? I want them

786
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:13,139
- to follow their dreams.
- No good.

787
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,350
Reach for the stars, girls.

788
01:13:15,517 --> 01:13:18,019
Finding Dreykov is not a fantasy.
It's unfinished business.

789
01:13:18,186 --> 01:13:22,065
You can't defeat a man
who commands the very will of others.

790
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:26,111
You never saw the culmination
of what we started in America.

791
01:13:26,278 --> 01:13:27,612
Nor did you.

792
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:34,494
Natasha, always focus, focus.
Get what you want.

793
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:42,627
Come in.

794
01:13:49,968 --> 01:13:51,511
Did that pig just open the door?

795
01:13:51,678 --> 01:13:53,763
Yes. It did.

796
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,683
Good boy, Alexei.
Good boy.

797
01:13:57,684 --> 01:13:59,477
You named a pig after me?

798
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:01,855
You don't see the resemblance?

799
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:07,277
See, he sits just like dog.

800
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:09,696
Amazing. Now, watch.

801
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:11,156
It's a little weird, to me.

802
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:12,824
Stop breathing.

803
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:21,541
We infiltrated
the North Institute in Ohio.

804
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:23,251
It was a front
for S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists.

805
01:14:23,335 --> 01:14:26,588
Actually, it was Hydra scientists
at that time.

806
01:14:26,755 --> 01:14:28,298
In conjunction with
the Winter Soldier project,

807
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:31,343
they had dissected
and deconstructed the human brain

808
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:36,181
to create the first and only
cellular blueprint of the basal ganglia.

809
01:14:36,348 --> 01:14:37,766
Was the hub for cognition.

810
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:41,227
Voluntary motor movement,
procedural learning.

811
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:46,524
We didn't steal weaponry or technology.

812
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:49,527
We stole the key to unlocking free will.

813
01:14:55,367 --> 01:14:56,368
What are you doing?

814
01:14:56,493 --> 01:15:00,163
Oh, I am explaining
that the science is now so exact,

815
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,540
the subject can be instructed
to stop breathing

816
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,584
and has no choice but to obey.

817
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:06,252
Okay, you made your point.
That's enough.

818
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:09,297
Yes, all right. Well, don't worry,
Alexei could've survived

819
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:12,050
11 more seconds without oxygen.

820
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:15,011
Good boy. Now, you go back,
back home where it's safe.

821
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:18,640
You go. You go back home,
back home where it's safe.

822
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:21,059
Good boy, Alexei.

823
01:15:21,226 --> 01:15:24,854
The world functions on a higher level
when it is controlled.

824
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:29,401
Dreykov has chemically subjugated agents
planted around the globe.

825
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:31,695
And do you know who they test it on?

826
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:33,113
Hmm...

827
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:34,948
No. That's not my department.

828
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,908
Ah, come on, come on.

829
01:15:37,075 --> 01:15:38,952
- Don't lie to them. Hmm?
- I'm not lying.

830
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:40,578
You're Dreykov's architect, huh?

831
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:41,746
What were you?

832
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:43,498
If I was his architect,
you were his partner.

833
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:44,624
You were his business partner.

834
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:46,000
No, no, no. I was patsy!

835
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:48,378
- Don't give me that...
- He sell me ideology.

836
01:15:48,545 --> 01:15:49,713
- Stop with the politics.
- All the while, bigger...

837
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:52,674
Shut up! You are an idiot.

838
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:58,763
And you're a coward.

839
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,726
You're a coward.

840
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:07,021
And our family was never real,
so there's nothing to hold on to.

841
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:09,816
We're moving on.

842
01:16:09,983 --> 01:16:12,318
Never family, huh?

843
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:15,155
In my heart, I am simple man.

844
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:19,325
And I think that for a couple
deep undercover Russian agents

845
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,536
I think we did pretty great
as parents, huh?

846
01:16:21,828 --> 01:16:25,165
Yes, we had our orders,
and we played our roles to perfection.

847
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:28,001
Who cares? That wasn't real.

848
01:16:28,293 --> 01:16:30,712
- What?
- That wasn't real. Who cares?

849
01:16:30,879 --> 01:16:32,630
Don't say that.

850
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:35,717
Please don't say that.
It was real.

851
01:16:36,468 --> 01:16:39,429
It was real to me.
You are my mother.

852
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:42,348
You were my real mother.

853
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:45,143
The closest thing I ever had to one.

854
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:49,105
The best part of my life was fake.

855
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:52,942
And none of you told me.

856
01:16:55,904 --> 01:16:58,031
And those agents

857
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,825
you chemically subjugated
around the globe?

858
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:04,454
That was me.

859
01:17:06,748 --> 01:17:07,749
Mmm.

860
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,629
And you, you got out.

861
01:17:12,796 --> 01:17:15,173
Dreykov made sure no one could escape.

862
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:18,051
Are you gonna say anything?

863
01:17:21,596 --> 01:17:22,597
No.

864
01:17:24,057 --> 01:17:25,058
Don't touch me.

865
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:29,395
Yelena.

866
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:30,980
No.

867
01:17:34,818 --> 01:17:37,320
- I had no idea.
- It's okay, it's okay.

868
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:39,364
I'll go talk to her.

869
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,924
I came in here
because I didn't want to talk.

870
01:17:59,634 --> 01:18:00,760
Okay.

871
01:18:01,803 --> 01:18:03,930
We, uh... We just sit.

872
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:10,270
We just sit.

873
01:18:19,821 --> 01:18:20,989
Where are you going?

874
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,491
- To do this myself.
- Don't. You won't survive.

875
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:25,994
I wish I could believe that you cared.

876
01:18:26,828 --> 01:18:28,997
But you're not even the first mother
that abandoned me.

877
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:31,291
No, you weren't abandoned.

878
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,418
You were selected by a program

879
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:35,503
that assessed
the genetic potential in infants.

880
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:47,140
I was taken?

881
01:18:47,599 --> 01:18:51,060
I believe a bargain was struck,
your family paid off.

882
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:54,105
But your mother,
she never stopped looking for you.

883
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:57,191
She was like you in that way.
She was

884
01:18:57,358 --> 01:18:58,902
relentless.

885
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:01,279
What happened to her?

886
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:04,741
Dreykov had her killed.

887
01:19:06,034 --> 01:19:08,870
Her existence threatened
to uncover the Red Room.

888
01:19:09,913 --> 01:19:12,332
Normally, the actions
of one curious civilian

889
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:13,499
wouldn't warrant an execution,

890
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:16,377
but, as I said, she was relentless.

891
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,966
I thought about her every day of my life.

892
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:29,390
Whether or not I admitted it to myself,
I did.

893
01:19:31,851 --> 01:19:34,228
I've always found it best
not to look into the past.

894
01:19:45,365 --> 01:19:46,866
Then why did you save this?

895
01:20:04,801 --> 01:20:06,719
I remember this day.

896
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:10,848
We shot Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter
and summer vacation all in one day.

897
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:13,476
- Different backdrops.
- Mmm.

898
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:19,482
I knew all the presents under the tree
were just empty boxes, but I didn't care.

899
01:20:19,649 --> 01:20:21,317
I wanted to open every single one...

900
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:27,532
so just for a second it would feel real.

901
01:20:28,116 --> 01:20:29,492
Let's stop this.

902
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,543
Why you doing this?

903
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:43,631
Why does a mouse born in a cage
run on that little wheel?

904
01:20:43,798 --> 01:20:46,426
Do you know I was cycled
through the Red Room

905
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:49,095
four times before you were even born?

906
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:50,680
Those walls are all I know.

907
01:20:51,431 --> 01:20:53,683
I was never given a choice.

908
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,394
But you're not a mouse, Melina.

909
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:02,025
You were just born in a cage,
but that's not your fault.

910
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:08,948
Tell me, how did you keep your heart?

911
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:17,081
Pain only makes us stronger.

912
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,001
Didn't you tell us that?

913
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:24,422
What you taught me kept me alive.

914
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:30,136
I'm sorry, I already alerted the Red Room.

915
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:32,263
They'll be here any minute.

916
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:39,729
So, there I am
ice fishing with my father.

917
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:42,940
It's very cold day
in this little ice shed.

918
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:44,400
Cold even for Russia, you know?

919
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:47,320
"Keep the vodka by the fire,"
my father would say to me.

920
01:21:47,487 --> 01:21:48,613
Please stop talking.

921
01:21:48,696 --> 01:21:49,739
- Please wait. Please wait.
- Please, no.

922
01:21:49,822 --> 01:21:50,823
Please, I don't want to talk.

923
01:21:50,907 --> 01:21:52,450
Please. Please.

924
01:21:53,076 --> 01:21:55,787
There is a reason why
I'm telling you this, okay? Trust me.

925
01:21:56,162 --> 01:21:58,456
I am reaching for fish.

926
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:02,919
Oh! I lose balance. Ah!

927
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:04,003
Splash!

928
01:22:04,087 --> 01:22:06,005
My hands go in the river.

929
01:22:06,089 --> 01:22:10,176
In this weather,
frostbite sets in quick.

930
01:22:10,635 --> 01:22:14,347
My father, he go toilet on my hands.

931
01:22:14,514 --> 01:22:15,640
Oh, my God.

932
01:22:15,807 --> 01:22:20,603
Urine is 35 degrees Celsius,
staves off the frostbite.

933
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:22,271
How is this relevant?

934
01:22:23,064 --> 01:22:24,357
You know,

935
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,150
fathers.

936
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:31,280
No. No.

937
01:22:31,948 --> 01:22:35,451
You have done nothing
but tell me how bored you were.

938
01:22:35,827 --> 01:22:39,831
I was the chore,
the job you didn't want to do.

939
01:22:40,206 --> 01:22:41,499
To me?

940
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:44,752
To me, you were everything.

941
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:50,800
Exactly. You don't care.
You don't care.

942
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,719
The only thing you care about
are your stupid glory days

943
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:57,140
as the Crimson Dynamo,
and no one wants to hear about it.

944
01:23:03,771 --> 01:23:05,648
It's the Red Guardian.

945
01:23:05,815 --> 01:23:06,899
Get out.

946
01:23:07,275 --> 01:23:08,860
Get out!

947
01:23:18,369 --> 01:23:20,872
<i>I can't remember</i>

948
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:25,877
<i>If I cried</i>

949
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:31,674
<i>When I read about his widowed bride</i>

950
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:36,929
<i>Something touched me deep inside</i>

951
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:38,264
<i>The day</i>

952
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:42,226
<i>The music</i>

953
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:44,478
<i>Died</i>

954
01:23:45,146 --> 01:23:47,690
<i>And they were singing</i>

955
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,902
<i>-Bye
- Bye</i>

956
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:53,654
<i>-Miss American Pie
- American Pie</i>

957
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:56,741
<i>Drove my Chevy to the levee</i>

958
01:23:56,908 --> 01:23:59,535
<i>-But the levee was dry
- Was dry</i>

959
01:24:00,453 --> 01:24:02,455
<i>Them good old boys</i>

960
01:24:02,914 --> 01:24:04,957
<i>Drinking whiskey</i>

961
01:24:06,584 --> 01:24:07,877
<i>Singing</i>

962
01:24:08,336 --> 01:24:12,256
<i>"This will be the day that I die"</i>

963
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:15,468
<i>"This'll be the day..."</i>

964
01:24:35,363 --> 01:24:36,364
Get down.

965
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:45,206
They think...

966
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:46,434
I'm sorry.

967
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:04,535
Let's not keep him waiting.

968
01:26:30,895 --> 01:26:33,064
Request clearance for landing.

969
01:26:33,147 --> 01:26:34,315
Copy that.

970
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:35,441
You are cleared to land on bay 5.

971
01:26:35,608 --> 01:26:36,650
Melina?

972
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:43,324
We're touching down in one minute.

973
01:26:43,491 --> 01:26:46,118
Then why are we still going up?

974
01:26:48,371 --> 01:26:51,791
Now you'll know how Dreykov stayed
above the radar all these years.

975
01:28:11,454 --> 01:28:12,705
My God.

976
01:28:12,872 --> 01:28:14,415
Look at you.

977
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:18,377
So, uh,

978
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:20,588
how was the family reunion?

979
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:22,631
Oh, it was awful.

980
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:23,883
They were clingy,

981
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:26,093
and too emotional, and needy.

982
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:28,637
- Just like old times, huh?
- Hmm.

983
01:28:28,721 --> 01:28:30,222
Yelena Belova.

984
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:32,099
What's the deal with her?

985
01:28:32,266 --> 01:28:34,518
She was the only one affected, right?

986
01:28:34,685 --> 01:28:36,228
As far as I know, yes.

987
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:39,356
These gasses and antidotes,

988
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:42,610
it's a pain in my ass.

989
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:46,155
It's a problem. You need to sort it.

990
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:47,573
Hmm. I have nine pigs

991
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:48,657
that will require attending to
in my absence.

992
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:52,036
Don't give a shit about your pigs.

993
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,502
Cut her brain out...

994
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:03,005
Hmm? Identify the weakness.

995
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:15,100
This is a much less cool way to die.

996
01:29:24,068 --> 01:29:25,486
Alexei.

997
01:29:34,453 --> 01:29:35,996
What about Romanoff?

998
01:29:36,163 --> 01:29:37,456
She's a traitor.

999
01:29:38,332 --> 01:29:42,419
She turned her back on her people.
On her blood.

1000
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,339
She had nothing.

1001
01:29:45,506 --> 01:29:49,301
I gave her home.
I gave her love.

1002
01:29:49,802 --> 01:29:52,096
Put that thing in her you do.

1003
01:29:52,263 --> 01:29:54,348
You know, uh, chemicals.

1004
01:29:55,391 --> 01:29:58,519
Turn her into one of your pigs.

1005
01:29:59,103 --> 01:30:03,649
Can you imagine what I could do
with an Avenger under my control?

1006
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:06,277
Wouldn't you like to speak to her first?

1007
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:09,863
When you look into the eyes
of a child you have raised,

1008
01:30:10,364 --> 01:30:13,409
no mask in the world can hide that.

1009
01:30:27,298 --> 01:30:28,465
Welcome home.

1010
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:32,136
Now, now.

1011
01:30:33,429 --> 01:30:35,598
Don't go breaking my new toy.

1012
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:38,767
Natasha.

1013
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:42,938
I can't save us.

1014
01:30:43,856 --> 01:30:45,733
<i>I need you to know that I'm sorry.</i>

1015
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:47,776
<i>I pledged my life to a cause.</i>

1016
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:50,279
You know, I thought
I was being very brave.

1017
01:30:50,446 --> 01:30:51,572
Possibly the bravest.

1018
01:30:51,739 --> 01:30:54,241
<i>But I wasn't being brave.</i>

1019
01:30:54,408 --> 01:30:55,951
I was coward.

1020
01:31:01,832 --> 01:31:03,208
In Cuba,

1021
01:31:04,752 --> 01:31:07,046
when they came
and took you away from me...

1022
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,924
No cause is worth that.

1023
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:15,846
You should only sacrifice yourself

1024
01:31:16,722 --> 01:31:18,265
for something...

1025
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:27,983
How did you do that?

1026
01:31:28,776 --> 01:31:31,028
I designed these cells myself.

1027
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:35,407
What?

1028
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:38,243
What?

1029
01:31:38,744 --> 01:31:42,122
I bared my soul to you
and it was just you the whole time?

1030
01:31:42,289 --> 01:31:45,876
Yes, I'm afraid so.
But wait, shh, I'm on comms with Yelena.

1031
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:49,046
Yelena, it's me. It's Mama.

1032
01:31:49,213 --> 01:31:52,174
<i>You have a two-inch blade
concealed in your belt line.</i>

1033
01:31:52,341 --> 01:31:53,342
What?

1034
01:31:56,512 --> 01:31:58,514
What are you going to do to me?

1035
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:00,849
<i>Outside right hip.</i>

1036
01:32:02,893 --> 01:32:04,687
Keep her awake

1037
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:06,563
for the cranial incisions.

1038
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:30,212
You couldn't have told me sooner?

1039
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:31,380
<i>Don't throw a fit.</i>

1040
01:32:31,547 --> 01:32:32,840
- There wasn't time.
- Okay, girls,

1041
01:32:32,923 --> 01:32:34,174
I'm having trouble hearing you,

1042
01:32:34,258 --> 01:32:37,136
but, Natasha,
there's something I need you to know.

1043
01:32:37,553 --> 01:32:41,974
I need you to know that I'm sorry.
No more excuses, okay?

1044
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:45,561
I gave my life for a cause.
I thought I was being brave.

1045
01:32:45,728 --> 01:32:47,771
You don't have earpiece.

1046
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,481
What?

1047
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:50,774
No, she can't hear you.

1048
01:32:50,941 --> 01:32:52,359
- You don't have earpiece.
- Why not?

1049
01:32:52,526 --> 01:32:53,819
Because it wasn't part of the plan.

1050
01:32:53,986 --> 01:32:55,529
Oh, yeah?
Well, what was the plan?

1051
01:32:56,238 --> 01:32:57,322
So, once we're inside,

1052
01:32:57,406 --> 01:32:58,991
I'll activate my tracker
and Ross will come running.

1053
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:02,661
You are aware that
you are still a global fugitive, yes?

1054
01:33:03,245 --> 01:33:05,622
You know the facility.
There must be some way to land it.

1055
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:10,085
Instruct them to confine us on level zero.

1056
01:33:10,252 --> 01:33:12,921
Once I'm out,
I can activate the landing protocol,

1057
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,506
we can descend within the hour.

1058
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:16,258
Ah, problem.

1059
01:33:16,425 --> 01:33:19,011
I only have one earpiece set.

1060
01:33:19,803 --> 01:33:20,929
I'll give it to Yelena.

1061
01:33:21,597 --> 01:33:22,681
Where did he take the vials?

1062
01:33:22,848 --> 01:33:24,767
<i>Probably down to cold storage.</i>

1063
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:27,269
Dreykov still has the widows
under his control,

1064
01:33:27,436 --> 01:33:30,022
<i>so you have to expose them
to this antidote.</i>

1065
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:33,150
Yeah. Sure. Easy.

1066
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:35,903
Is this your plan?

1067
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:37,696
My plan is to kill you.

1068
01:33:37,863 --> 01:33:39,281
I'm alive.

1069
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:42,117
So, what do we do now?

1070
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:45,496
What was my mother's name?

1071
01:33:49,082 --> 01:33:50,167
Ah...

1072
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:53,337
Where we buried her,

1073
01:33:53,962 --> 01:33:55,839
there was a tree...

1074
01:33:56,465 --> 01:33:57,883
Um...

1075
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,843
A pink blossom.

1076
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:01,720
Beautiful.

1077
01:34:01,887 --> 01:34:03,639
And there was a tombstone

1078
01:34:03,806 --> 01:34:06,433
with her name engraved on it.

1079
01:34:07,226 --> 01:34:08,727
What was her name?

1080
01:34:08,811 --> 01:34:10,312
Ah.

1081
01:34:12,648 --> 01:34:16,026
"Unknown."

1082
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:20,364
You don't feel anything?

1083
01:34:21,615 --> 01:34:23,909
You feel anything
when I killed your daughter?

1084
01:34:24,076 --> 01:34:27,329
Is this your haunted past?

1085
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:31,416
Really?

1086
01:34:40,968 --> 01:34:43,637
Thank you, Natasha.

1087
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:50,477
You gave me my greatest weapon.

1088
01:34:54,231 --> 01:34:55,315
Say hello.

1089
01:35:10,539 --> 01:35:13,000
When your bomb exploded,

1090
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:15,711
it nearly killed my Antonia.

1091
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:23,302
I had to put a chip
in the back of her neck.

1092
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:25,804
In the back of her neck.

1093
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:28,181
Look at her.

1094
01:35:28,682 --> 01:35:30,893
You find it difficult to look at her?

1095
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:33,145
I do.

1096
01:35:34,021 --> 01:35:36,648
She... She watches everything

1097
01:35:37,524 --> 01:35:38,734
and she can do it.

1098
01:35:39,276 --> 01:35:41,320
She's a perfect mimic.

1099
01:35:43,405 --> 01:35:46,241
And she fights
just like all of your friends.

1100
01:35:50,913 --> 01:35:52,497
Can she hear me?

1101
01:35:55,876 --> 01:35:57,085
What?

1102
01:35:59,171 --> 01:36:01,298
You want to make her feel better?

1103
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:05,928
You want to tell her you're sorry?

1104
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:11,141
Well, you should have thought of that
before you blew her face off.

1105
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:15,687
But enough of all this bullshit.

1106
01:36:17,022 --> 01:36:18,148
Go to work.

1107
01:36:18,315 --> 01:36:20,359
I have rats in the basement. Go.

1108
01:36:22,903 --> 01:36:24,154
Go.

1109
01:36:35,749 --> 01:36:37,334
Well, that was a mistake.

1110
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:39,086
Was it?

1111
01:36:39,586 --> 01:36:42,631
You just sent away the one thing
that would stop me from killing you.

1112
01:36:44,383 --> 01:36:45,384
Try, then.

1113
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:46,760
Do it.

1114
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:53,058
Is the safety on?

1115
01:36:58,146 --> 01:36:59,147
No.

1116
01:37:02,985 --> 01:37:04,820
Try your knife.

1117
01:37:05,696 --> 01:37:06,780
Ah...

1118
01:37:13,787 --> 01:37:14,871
You're in trouble.

1119
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:16,373
How are you controlling me?

1120
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,583
I'm not controlling you, Natasha.

1121
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:20,627
Well, not yet.

1122
01:37:21,253 --> 01:37:23,422
But there is a pheromonal lock.

1123
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:28,176
Smelling my pheromones prevents you
from committing violence against me.

1124
01:37:32,723 --> 01:37:35,392
I'm very upset with Melina.

1125
01:37:35,559 --> 01:37:37,185
It's a shame I have to kill her.

1126
01:37:38,145 --> 01:37:39,771
Come on, now.
If we're just going to

1127
01:37:39,855 --> 01:37:41,690
press buttons and hack computers...

1128
01:37:41,857 --> 01:37:42,858
- Yes.
- I mean, I don't know.

1129
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:43,942
There's nothing for me to do.

1130
01:37:44,067 --> 01:37:46,862
I want to...
I want to break something.

1131
01:37:46,945 --> 01:37:47,946
Oh, you do?

1132
01:37:49,698 --> 01:37:52,325
Oh, there is something you can break.

1133
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:09,926
Melina, if this is
the last time that we...

1134
01:38:12,012 --> 01:38:13,764
Ah, damn it.

1135
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:28,570
That was disgusting.

1136
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:43,126
Okay.

1137
01:39:04,898 --> 01:39:07,651
So, this was the big plan, huh?

1138
01:39:07,984 --> 01:39:12,864
Melina was going to land the Red Room
and hand me over to the authorities.

1139
01:39:16,243 --> 01:39:17,702
Oh, no, no, no.

1140
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:26,545
So, what now, you're gonna fold me into
your pathetic little puppeteer act?

1141
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:27,712
Pathetic, huh?

1142
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:29,548
Yeah, what would you call it?

1143
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:30,882
- I would call it...
- When was the last time

1144
01:39:30,966 --> 01:39:32,342
that you had a conversation with somebody

1145
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:34,261
that wasn't forced to talk to you?

1146
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:37,389
You ran away to fight in the wrong war.

1147
01:39:37,806 --> 01:39:41,309
The real war was fought here,
in the shadows.

1148
01:39:41,476 --> 01:39:43,061
You didn't fight in the shadows.

1149
01:39:43,228 --> 01:39:44,437
You hid in the dark.

1150
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:48,400
Real power comes
from undetectable influence.

1151
01:39:48,567 --> 01:39:50,986
If no one's noticed, then why even do it?

1152
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:52,487
You're nothing.

1153
01:39:52,571 --> 01:39:54,781
- Hmm.
- You have nothing.

1154
01:39:55,282 --> 01:39:56,867
There are 50 people on this planet...

1155
01:39:57,033 --> 01:39:58,285
Oh, stop it.

1156
01:39:58,451 --> 01:40:01,079
Don't tell me to stop!

1157
01:40:01,246 --> 01:40:04,166
If I don't tell you when to stop,
then how will you know when to shut up?

1158
01:40:08,128 --> 01:40:09,254
Come on.

1159
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:11,256
Think I can't take a punch?

1160
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:12,424
Oh.

1161
01:40:14,259 --> 01:40:17,429
- God damn it, you're weak.
- Weak?

1162
01:40:17,596 --> 01:40:19,764
I bet it's easier to be tough
in front of defenseless little girls, huh?

1163
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:21,558
That's enough.

1164
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:33,278
You wouldn't be so glib

1165
01:40:33,445 --> 01:40:37,115
if you had any notion
of the scope of what I've built.

1166
01:40:38,742 --> 01:40:41,328
I own this world. Me.

1167
01:40:41,494 --> 01:40:43,246
You seem desperate to impress me.

1168
01:40:43,413 --> 01:40:44,748
I don't need to impress you.

1169
01:40:44,915 --> 01:40:47,417
I don't need to impress anyone.

1170
01:40:48,627 --> 01:40:51,796
These world leaders, these great men,

1171
01:40:52,631 --> 01:40:55,467
they answer to me and my widows.

1172
01:40:59,221 --> 01:41:00,305
Look at them.

1173
01:41:03,099 --> 01:41:04,809
These girls were trash.

1174
01:41:05,936 --> 01:41:08,021
They are thrown out into the street.

1175
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:11,775
I recycle the trash.

1176
01:41:11,942 --> 01:41:13,818
And I give them purpose.

1177
01:41:15,654 --> 01:41:17,447
I give them a life.

1178
01:41:24,663 --> 01:41:26,915
Melina, I found the location of the vials.

1179
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:30,293
I've had a slight setback.

1180
01:41:32,379 --> 01:41:34,089
You'll need to get to the widows.

1181
01:41:53,358 --> 01:41:55,193
It's my network of widows

1182
01:41:55,277 --> 01:41:58,405
that help me control the scales of power.

1183
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:02,826
One command,
the oil and stock markets crumble.

1184
01:42:02,993 --> 01:42:07,080
One command,
and a quarter of the planet will starve.

1185
01:42:07,247 --> 01:42:10,375
My widows can start and end wars.

1186
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:13,336
They can make and break kings.

1187
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:19,884
You control all of that from here?

1188
01:42:20,635 --> 01:42:22,512
And with you,

1189
01:42:23,179 --> 01:42:26,224
an Avenger under my control,

1190
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:30,061
I can finally come out of the shadows

1191
01:42:31,187 --> 01:42:35,942
using the only natural resource
that the world has too much of.

1192
01:42:37,527 --> 01:42:38,903
Girls.

1193
01:42:49,205 --> 01:42:51,583
All from that little console?

1194
01:42:52,334 --> 01:42:53,543
Yeah.

1195
01:42:57,881 --> 01:42:59,632
Oh, you find this amusing?

1196
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:01,468
Why are you smiling?

1197
01:43:02,135 --> 01:43:04,179
Don't take it personal, but, uh...

1198
01:43:06,473 --> 01:43:08,558
Thank you for your cooperation.

1199
01:43:09,017 --> 01:43:13,229
Even if you locate the database
and get him to show you the key,

1200
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:15,940
you won't be able to take it from him.

1201
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:19,486
For years, Dreykov has implemented
a pheromonal lock

1202
01:43:19,652 --> 01:43:21,488
in all widows, even me.

1203
01:43:22,155 --> 01:43:26,242
So, as long as we can smell him,
then we won't be able to hurt him.

1204
01:43:26,326 --> 01:43:28,036
Well, I'll just hold my breath.

1205
01:43:28,203 --> 01:43:29,662
Not enough.

1206
01:43:29,829 --> 01:43:31,539
This is basic science.

1207
01:43:31,706 --> 01:43:34,959
Natasha, to block receptors
in olfactory center,

1208
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:37,170
you have to sever the nerve.

1209
01:43:39,005 --> 01:43:40,340
I can handle that.

1210
01:43:41,257 --> 01:43:43,635
You weren't quite strong enough, so...

1211
01:43:44,511 --> 01:43:46,262
I'll have to finish it myself.

1212
01:43:46,346 --> 01:43:48,390
What are you going to do?

1213
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:51,643
Sever the nerve.

1214
01:44:12,539 --> 01:44:13,665
She's got a gun!

1215
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:16,459
Melina!

1216
01:44:21,005 --> 01:44:22,424
Melina, stop there!

1217
01:44:26,177 --> 01:44:27,512
Drop to the ground!

1218
01:44:27,804 --> 01:44:29,389
Precisely what I was thinking.

1219
01:44:42,068 --> 01:44:43,862
Yelena, slight change of plan.

1220
01:44:44,028 --> 01:44:47,323
I completely demolished one of the engines
and we are going into a controlled crash.

1221
01:44:50,368 --> 01:44:51,369
Fantastic.

1222
01:44:51,536 --> 01:44:53,037
I'm heading to the widows now.

1223
01:44:54,247 --> 01:44:55,540
No.

1224
01:45:33,161 --> 01:45:34,746
We have to go.

1225
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:42,712
Not so talkative now, are you?

1226
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:45,465
You took my childhood.

1227
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:49,636
You took my choices and tried to break me.

1228
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:51,846
But you're never gonna do that
to anybody ever again.

1229
01:46:03,274 --> 01:46:06,861
Nobody leaves
this room until she's dead.

1230
01:46:07,028 --> 01:46:09,197
Make her suffer.

1231
01:46:11,407 --> 01:46:12,825
I don't wanna hurt you.

1232
01:46:13,409 --> 01:46:14,827
You don't wanna hurt me.

1233
01:48:08,858 --> 01:48:10,068
Hey.

1234
01:48:10,443 --> 01:48:11,444
Are you okay?

1235
01:48:12,737 --> 01:48:13,863
That looks like it hurts.

1236
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:16,240
Okay. I take out on three, ready?

1237
01:48:16,449 --> 01:48:18,409
I'm sorry.

1238
01:48:20,370 --> 01:48:21,746
What do we do now?

1239
01:48:23,998 --> 01:48:26,167
Get as far away
from here as possible.

1240
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:28,711
You get to make your own choices now.

1241
01:48:39,764 --> 01:48:40,973
We gotta get outta here.

1242
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:42,225
We need to find Dreykov.
Are you coming?

1243
01:48:42,308 --> 01:48:43,518
I'm right behind you.

1244
01:48:50,233 --> 01:48:53,528
Wait, wait! I have to go back!

1245
01:49:33,818 --> 01:49:34,819
Yes!

1246
01:50:32,084 --> 01:50:33,503
Do you see the girls?

1247
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:37,381
No!

1248
01:51:10,248 --> 01:51:11,833
We need to go back.

1249
01:51:39,151 --> 01:51:40,778
We've lost control.

1250
01:52:04,886 --> 01:52:06,304
Antonia.

1251
01:52:09,181 --> 01:52:11,309
No!

1252
01:52:12,602 --> 01:52:14,312
I'm gonna open the door.

1253
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:16,939
You're gonna come after me.

1254
01:52:17,106 --> 01:52:19,317
It's okay. It's okay.

1255
01:52:21,444 --> 01:52:23,613
I know you're still in there.

1256
01:52:25,531 --> 01:52:28,451
And I'm not gonna leave you.
Okay.

1257
01:53:42,858 --> 01:53:43,859
Yelena!

1258
01:53:45,403 --> 01:53:46,904
She's on the wing!

1259
01:53:47,071 --> 01:53:49,448
Move! What are you waiting for?

1260
01:53:50,992 --> 01:53:51,993
Don't do it!

1261
01:53:52,952 --> 01:53:54,620
This was fun!

1262
01:53:54,787 --> 01:53:55,830
No!

1263
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:45,314
Okay.

1264
01:55:46,524 --> 01:55:48,025
Let's go.

1265
01:56:02,832 --> 01:56:04,083
Enough.

1266
01:56:55,467 --> 01:56:56,886
I'm sorry.

1267
01:56:57,052 --> 01:56:58,470
I'm sorry.

1268
01:57:01,682 --> 01:57:03,267
Is he gone?

1269
01:57:07,646 --> 01:57:08,898
He's gone.

1270
01:57:26,707 --> 01:57:28,083
Yelena!

1271
01:57:38,928 --> 01:57:40,221
Yelena?

1272
01:57:46,936 --> 01:57:49,146
We're both upside down.

1273
01:57:57,821 --> 01:58:01,909
Forgive me little sister.

1274
01:58:04,161 --> 01:58:05,454
I should've come back for you.

1275
01:58:05,621 --> 01:58:06,789
You don't have to say that.

1276
01:58:06,872 --> 01:58:08,165
- It's okay.
- Hey. Hey.

1277
01:58:08,707 --> 01:58:10,292
It was real to me, too.

1278
01:58:24,556 --> 01:58:25,557
Thank you.

1279
01:58:40,656 --> 01:58:41,782
Everybody good?

1280
01:58:41,949 --> 01:58:44,368
I am clearly injured.

1281
01:58:45,786 --> 01:58:47,705
You got something to say?

1282
01:58:48,664 --> 01:58:50,082
I'd just mess it up.

1283
01:59:04,430 --> 01:59:06,348
Here comes the cavalry.

1284
01:59:09,351 --> 01:59:11,770
<i>We're closing in on the target, sir.</i>

1285
01:59:14,481 --> 01:59:16,442
So, what's our plan?

1286
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:19,945
You guys go. I'll stay.

1287
01:59:20,112 --> 01:59:22,072
That's insanity. We fight.
We fight with you.

1288
01:59:22,156 --> 01:59:24,033
- I'll hold them off.
- Natasha, we fight.

1289
01:59:24,116 --> 01:59:25,659
We can't split up.
You're so pigheaded.

1290
01:59:25,826 --> 01:59:27,995
- You guys, go.
- Oh, my God.

1291
01:59:28,162 --> 01:59:30,914
Besides, if it can work out
with the four of us, you know,

1292
01:59:31,081 --> 01:59:33,500
there may be some hope for the Avengers.

1293
01:59:33,667 --> 01:59:34,960
Little bit.

1294
01:59:35,127 --> 01:59:39,048
Okay, well, if you're leaving,
then I guess you should take this.

1295
01:59:39,214 --> 01:59:41,759
I know how much you like it.

1296
01:59:41,925 --> 01:59:43,719
Shucks.

1297
01:59:43,802 --> 01:59:45,054
It does have a lot of pockets.

1298
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:47,222
Very handy pockets, yeah.

1299
01:59:48,349 --> 01:59:50,517
He had widows implanted
all over the world.

1300
01:59:50,684 --> 01:59:52,561
Melina will need to copy the formula,

1301
01:59:53,103 --> 01:59:54,897
but you should be the one
to tell 'em it's over.

1302
02:00:14,750 --> 02:00:16,668
You came back for us.

1303
02:00:16,835 --> 02:00:18,670
We wouldn't leave you behind.

1304
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:26,804
Thank you.

1305
02:00:31,850 --> 02:00:33,102
Hey.

1306
02:00:33,769 --> 02:00:36,563
Hey. You take care of yourself, okay?

1307
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:37,856
Don't worry. I got this.

1308
02:00:38,023 --> 02:00:39,483
I know.

1309
02:00:49,868 --> 02:00:52,788
Don't worry.
We're bringing her with us.

1310
02:00:53,497 --> 02:00:55,791
Come. Come with us.

1311
02:02:30,469 --> 02:02:31,595
You ever not sleep?

1312
02:02:32,763 --> 02:02:36,141
I've been in six different time zones
in three days because of you.

1313
02:02:36,308 --> 02:02:37,601
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1314
02:02:37,768 --> 02:02:40,229
What, are you scrapping together
some parts?

1315
02:02:40,395 --> 02:02:43,941
What'd you get me this time,
like, an upside-down lawnmower?

1316
02:02:49,112 --> 02:02:51,406
You see what I can get you
with a bit of time and money?

1317
02:02:57,412 --> 02:02:59,039
Go on, say it.
I wanna hear it.

1318
02:02:59,206 --> 02:03:01,833
It would really be good for me
to hear it. Really.

1319
02:03:03,085 --> 02:03:04,253
I'm impressed.

1320
02:03:04,419 --> 02:03:06,088
Well, yeah.

1321
02:03:06,713 --> 02:03:09,341
You've always been
a really good friend to me.

1322
02:03:09,508 --> 02:03:12,010
That's what every man wants to hear.

1323
02:03:12,803 --> 02:03:13,971
Where you gonna go?

1324
02:03:15,305 --> 02:03:17,975
It's funny. My whole life,
I didn't think I had any family.

1325
02:03:18,141 --> 02:03:20,310
Turns out I got two, so...

1326
02:03:20,811 --> 02:03:22,104
One of them's a bit of a mess right now.

1327
02:03:22,271 --> 02:03:25,065
I'm gonna go break
a few of them out of prison

1328
02:03:25,566 --> 02:03:28,068
see if I can't help patch things up.

1329
02:11:14,909 --> 02:11:17,245
Come on, Fanny.

1330
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:38,493
Wow. Sorry.

1331
02:12:39,577 --> 02:12:41,913
I'm allergic to the Midwest.

1332
02:12:44,415 --> 02:12:47,252
What this woman did,

1333
02:12:47,418 --> 02:12:50,255
honestly, I can't even imagine.

1334
02:12:50,755 --> 02:12:54,509
You're not supposed to be bothering me
on my holiday time, Valentina.

1335
02:12:54,676 --> 02:12:56,177
Oh, bothering you? Oh, no, no.

1336
02:12:56,261 --> 02:12:58,805
I'm just here paying my respects.

1337
02:12:58,888 --> 02:12:59,973
Hmm...

1338
02:13:00,390 --> 02:13:02,684
You know, coming here
makes you look desperate.

1339
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:07,063
Okay.

1340
02:13:07,230 --> 02:13:08,314
I want a raise.

1341
02:13:08,481 --> 02:13:09,816
Oh, yeah. You and me both.

1342
02:13:09,983 --> 02:13:12,443
Believe me, you're gonna earn it.

1343
02:13:13,611 --> 02:13:15,905
I've got your next target.

1344
02:13:16,072 --> 02:13:17,824
Thought I'd hand-deliver it.

1345
02:13:20,076 --> 02:13:24,873
Maybe you'd like a shot at the man
responsible for your sister's death.

1346
02:13:27,625 --> 02:13:29,586
Kind of a cutie, don't you think?
