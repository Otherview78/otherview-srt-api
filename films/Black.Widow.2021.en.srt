1
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:08,167
- European 24, Swiss control. - European 24, go ahead.

2
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,208
- Are you able flight level 400? - Stand by, we call you back.

3
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:15,000
We weigh 251 tons.

4
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:18,000
Just over optimal with a 1.5g buffet margin.

5
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:19,334
1.6 even.

6
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:22,875
European 24, we are able now flight level 400.

7
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,042
Maintain level 380, I'll call you back for climb.

8
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,500
Wilco.

9
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:30,292
- Jeanne and your meal. - I'll let her in.

10
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:35,584
Thanks.

11
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,125
We're serving breakfast.

12
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:39,417
It may get rocky. Let them know.

13
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,042
Ok, I'll get your meal.

14
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,167
Coffee?

15
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:55,333
Coffee?

16
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,333
- Can I have some coffee, please? - Sure.

17
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:03,042
Thank you.

18
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:18,709
Did you rest?

19
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,958
We are now approaching a zone of turbulence.

20
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:45,792
Please return to your seats and keep your seatbelts fastened.

21
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:50,917
Sir!

22
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:53,834
Please sit down, sir.

23
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:16,667
Still Swiss control?

24
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,875
They'll soon hand us over to Paris.

25
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,875
On turnaround this week?

26
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,375
New Delhi, then Bali right after.

27
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,292
Any room in your bags?

28
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,750
- Jeanne again. - I'll let her in.

29
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:43,333
European 24, say altitude. I see you descending, do you copy?

30
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,125
That's the lot.

31
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:20,750
An iPhone video, no flight recorder on board.

32
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:23,542
It looks like the tail rotor went.

33
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,959
Not just that.

34
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,250
Listen.

35
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,500
A transmission gear is too slow.

36
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:41,667
On a Dauphin, it should be at 1730. I hear it at 1680.

37
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:44,209
You can hear a 50 Hz difference?

38
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,000
I see it too.

39
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,209
Here, this line at 1680 Hz.

40
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,542
Pitch that part 300% to bass.

41
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,542
All I hear is the tail rotor.

42
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:10,250
I'm not sure. We need a test flight.

43
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:13,167
The same phone, the same distance.

44
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,084
Mathieu, I've seen this before. The video is clear.

45
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,084
Sorry, but I really think we should do a test flight.

46
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,792
Mathieu, believe me,

47
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,834
you'll end up at the same conclusion.

48
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:27,917
If you say so.

49
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:30,917
We'll never know.

50
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:33,625
Want Balsan to take over?

51
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:38,792
Right...

52
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:50,250
We need the 800 FCOM.

53
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,584
The updated one.

54
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,750
The whole avionic system.

55
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:56,709
The go-team's due at 3 pm.

56
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:00,084
Call the airline.

57
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,834
Get the recorder serial numbers.

58
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:05,292
I need to cancel, we have a crash.

59
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:06,875
We'll free the lab.

60
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:08,292
Ok, I'll hold.

61
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,084
Yes, I'll hold.

62
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:13,584
An Atrian 800 went down. 300 passengers.

63
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,750
When?

64
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,792
Air traffic just informed us.

65
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,792
All technical data.

66
00:06:20,084 --> 00:06:21,750
Plane, engine, the lot.

67
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,792
Pollock's in charge.

68
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:24,959
Who's going?

69
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:28,084
Rénier wants a CVR guy and a wreck tech.

70
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,250
Yes.

71
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:33,250
We need to work with your technical adviser.

72
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:35,459
The go-team flies out ASAP.

73
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Balsan, get your things.

74
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,709
Sorry, but you usually take me.

75
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:53,125
Balsan is as capable.

76
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:55,292
If it's about earlier...

77
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,292
I can't deal with your misgivings now.

78
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:05,959
The case bag.

79
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,375
- What? - The bag.

80
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,000
We need it.

81
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,167
Heard anything?

82
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,792
I've been side-lined

83
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,334
Tonight is off?

84
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,167
Don't chicken out.

85
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,917
I don't know what time I'll finish.

86
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,584
I've got everyone together, you have to come.

87
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:48,167
No one will come after the crash.

88
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,834
They'll all be after information.

89
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,209
Make an effort, for my sake.

90
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,792
Shit...

91
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,667
- What's up? - Hold on.

92
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:10,500
Mathieu?

93
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,167
Fuck...

94
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,875
Mathieu?

95
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,542
- What's wrong? - Nothing.

96
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,917
Are you coming?

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
If you want, but there'll be no one there.

98
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,000
They act normal, but they're thinking about the crash.

99
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:38,959
I'm not on it.

100
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
On what?

101
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:42,084
The investigation.

102
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,667
A huge case and I'm not on it.

103
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,375
I'm no better off.

104
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,959
If it's technical, Atrian is doomed,

105
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,875
with me and half this room.

106
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,792
Welcome to the Titanic.

107
00:09:57,042 --> 00:09:58,042
Xavier!

108
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:00,417
- Ok? - Fine, and you?

109
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:02,917
Pegase is securing CDG's network?

110
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:05,125
We're pleased, it's a big job.

111
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,917
Your single-fibre network

112
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,417
is awesome. It should be standard.

113
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:12,584
Lighter aircraft means lower fuel consumption.

114
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,917
Let's do lunch and talk.

115
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:16,917
Next week, after Montreal.

116
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:19,042
- I'll call you. - Ok.

117
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,375
He used to hate you.

118
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:26,167
They all want to give me their CVs now.

119
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,042
What are you two plotting?

120
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,792
I was asking how you got him here.

121
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:34,500
- Ok? - Yes.

122
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,042
- When d'you start with Varins? - Next month.

123
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:40,167
I'm so pleased.

124
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:42,042
Thanks again.

125
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,584
Just one call. How did the agency react?

126
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:47,334
Upset to see you in the private sector?

127
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:48,500
They'll recover.

128
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:51,917
Don't be modest, you're their best element.

129
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,209
I'll need to work hard.

130
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,917
Varins is demanding.

131
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:58,584
- No, you'll be fine. - I hope so.

132
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm organizing a cocktail party

133
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,292
for gender equality.

134
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,459
Could the Entrepreneurs help?

135
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,542
- Want me to ask? - Please.

136
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,459
Always after favours...

137
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:10,750
Stop it.

138
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:12,792
I'm kidding. I'll ask.

139
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,334
I have to see the Safran guys.

140
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,875
I'll call you.

141
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,042
Deal.

142
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:24,375
- Finished mingling? - Yes.

143
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Well?

144
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:31,959
Limited dispersion.

145
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:34,250
So, no explosion.

146
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,709
Got the ACARS and trajectory data?

147
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,959
Yes, a sudden nose-dive.

148
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,875
And traffic control?

149
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,417
The pilots tried to climb before losing contact.

150
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,542
Could it be technical?

151
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:51,959
Not for me. Our certification showed the 800 is a Rolls.

152
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:54,209
Not one major breakdown yet.

153
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:58,584
Nothing new on the Atrian 800 crash in the Alps this morning.

154
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:01,042
With the gendarmes

155
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:03,500
at work all day in the mountains,

156
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:04,959
BEA experts

157
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,334
are on site to localize the black boxes. Nothing...

158
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,959
Don't brood. You're not on it, ok.

159
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,875
I told you before, don't get Pollock's back up.

160
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:20,667
So I just shut up?

161
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,542
We aren't judged on skills alone.

162
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:32,959
You know that.

163
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,542
Just be more diplomatic.

164
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,084
It's green.

165
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,834
I learned that in a coaching seminar.

166
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,959
"Boost a distressed co-worker."

167
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,084
You have no mercy.

168
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,500
None at all.

169
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:59,292
{\an8}The European Airlines Atrian 800 was carrying

170
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,792
300 passengers and 16 crew.

171
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,459
There are no survivors.

172
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,625
Flight EA024 took off

173
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:09,292
at 1:40 am from Dubai with a planned arrival in Paris at 8:50.

174
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,625
But shortly before 8 am,

175
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:14,959
the plane plummeted and crashed

176
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,959
near Bellevaux in the Alps

177
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:19,042
for reasons unknown.

178
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:23,542
A rescue operation was launched after the loss of radar echo...

179
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,375
European Airlines Atrian Manslaughter

180
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:27,417
Victor Pollock, BEA investigator.

181
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,292
It's 7:10 pm on October 10, 2020.

182
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:34,917
In the presence of a police officer, we'll remove

183
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:36,917
and open the CVR

184
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,375
from the October 8 crash of the Atrian 800

185
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:42,709
registered FHLBN,

186
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:45,334
operated by European Airlines. Begin.

187
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:25,167
It's good, it's exploitable.

188
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,750
European 24, Swiss control.

189
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,708
European 24, go ahead.

190
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:32,750
European 24, are you able flight level 400?

191
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,333
- Stand by, we call you back. - We weigh 251 tons.

192
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,583
500.

193
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:37,709
Land the plane at 800 m

194
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,750
with low auto-brake. Reverse on my signal.

195
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,208
50. 40.

196
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:46,625
30.

197
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,750
20. Retard. Retard.

198
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,209
Reverse thrust!

199
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,000
On a wet runway,

200
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:11,834
the landing and late reverse led to a runway excursion.

201
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:16,292
The crew should have tried extra thrust before wheel contact.

202
00:18:17,334 --> 00:18:20,250
A quick simulation to accuse an absent pilot...

203
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:22,125
It's a bit too easy.

204
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:25,209
We reproduced the whole incident.

205
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:28,042
It's nothing like being in flight.

206
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,292
This may be tough, Mr Roussin,

207
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:33,459
but your colleague lied when he blamed the plane.

208
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:37,167
Keep accusing the pilots and planes will be flown like drones.

209
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,125
So you say.

210
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,084
We're judged by people like you.

211
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:43,500
Frustrated pilots.

212
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:54,292
Recommendation: review landing on short runways.

213
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,209
Mathieu, I must see you. It's urgent.

214
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,375
Sorry, is Balsan alone?

215
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:17,084
Pollock still isn't here. No one has heard from him all morning.

216
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,750
Yes, come in.

217
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:29,750
I'll send a copy of the CVR, but we had to talk first.

218
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:33,084
There were leaks with your predecessor.

219
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,209
I need to be sure our information will remain confidential.

220
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:38,834
Very good.

221
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,500
Mathieu, we have a problem.

222
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:48,250
Pollock can't be found. Balsan is stuck on the CVR.

223
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,792
The sound is mangled. Help him.

224
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,667
Ok. What did the FDR show?

225
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,125
It's almost useless.

226
00:19:56,667 --> 00:20:00,417
We found some incoherent flight orders in the final minutes,

227
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,417
but we don't know why.

228
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:07,125
- The minister's deputy. - Put him on.

229
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,667
I know it's urgent, Antoine, but I need time.

230
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:14,167
We're analysing the CVR.

231
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,584
No, 3 pm is too soon.

232
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:18,167
Ok, 7 pm.

233
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,625
I promise.

234
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:21,125
I'll keep you posted.

235
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:24,167
Press point at 7.

236
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,625
Make the CVR talk.

237
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,917
I need the full chain of events.

238
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:52,125
We've only processed the first hour.

239
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,417
The cockpit mic is dirty.

240
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:00,458
European 24, Swiss control.

241
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:01,667
Stop.

242
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:03,709
- What? - A buzz.

243
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:05,625
Unplug that.

244
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,417
European 24, are you able flight level 400?

245
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,250
Stand by, we call you back.

246
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:18,084
We weigh 251 tons.

247
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:21,209
Just over optimal with a 1.5g buffet margin.

248
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:22,625
1.6 even.

249
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,625
European 24, we are able now flight level 400.

250
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,542
Maintain level 380. I'll call you back for climb.

251
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,000
Wilco.

252
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:35,209
- Jeanne and your meal. - I'll let her in.

253
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:41,667
We're serving breakfast.

254
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,000
It may get rocky. Let them know.

255
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:45,709
Ok, I'll get your meal.

256
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:54,750
Sooner than I thought. Seatbelt time.

257
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:58,959
See those cbs on the right?

258
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,750
We were right to avoid them.

259
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:02,459
It looks clear ahead.

260
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:05,584
The CDG update. Westerly landing, visibility 3000 m,

261
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:08,250
rain, clouds at 800 feet, 8° C...

262
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:10,750
Static. They're in a cloud.

263
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:14,834
- Where do you live? - Just north of CDG.

264
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,334
22° today in Biarritz.

265
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:18,459
You live there?

266
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:20,459
The engine speed has changed.

267
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:22,500
My wife's Basque and I surf.

268
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,292
Still with Swiss control?

269
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,000
Their earphones are off.

270
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,542
On turnaround this week?

271
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,917
New Delhi, then Bali right after.

272
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,500
Any room in your bags?

273
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,625
- Jeanne again. - I'll let her in.

274
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:53,042
European 24, Swiss control, say altitude.

275
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,833
European 24, do you have a problem?

276
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,083
I see you descending.

277
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,458
Do you copy?

278
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:21,292
We're gonna crash!

279
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:29,167
Switch to RX. Give me 200 to 1800 Hz.

280
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,417
Lower the engine noise.

281
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,667
Let's bring the voices out.

282
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:56,792
Let me try something.

283
00:23:58,542 --> 00:23:59,792
Can you stop?

284
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:02,417
Your leg.

285
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:06,292
Thanks.

286
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,209
...akbar!

287
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:16,042
Allahu akbar!

288
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:25,250
At the end, it could be the pilot or the co.

289
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:28,084
We can't determine what they did.

290
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,209
All the 800 controls are touch-screen.

291
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,000
How did the guy get in?

292
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:36,167
The sound is terrible. We need more time.

293
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:38,834
I know, but I can't delay the press point.

294
00:24:39,334 --> 00:24:40,459
Can you do it?

295
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,250
Yes.

296
00:24:44,334 --> 00:24:47,000
Switch to iZotope RX at 7'51.

297
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:59,625
The limited spread of debris

298
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:02,084
shows the plane was intact

299
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,792
prior to impact.

300
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:07,292
The initial analysis of the fuselage

301
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:09,500
shows no sign of explosives.

302
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,792
Moreover, the voice recorder shows a passenger

303
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,292
entered the cockpit.

304
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:20,375
The pilots then fought with him.

305
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,042
Here, please.

306
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:23,875
Yes?

307
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,125
Caroline Delmas, Mediapart.

308
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:30,542
How could a passenger enter the cockpit

309
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,959
with three cameras over the door?

310
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:36,625
He apparently used a stewardess to gain entrance.

311
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:38,792
What allows you to assert that?

312
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,959
The CVR analysis.

313
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:44,250
Our investigator, Mathieu Vasseur,

314
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,584
will present the initial CVR findings.

315
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:56,917
Hello.

316
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:02,417
On the recording,

317
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:06,375
at 7:48 am Paris time,

318
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:10,959
we hear the voice of the hostess entering the cockpit

319
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,542
with the first meal tray.

320
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:18,875
She returns one minute 20 seconds later

321
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:21,334
and rings the doorbell.

322
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:24,084
Probably with the second meal.

323
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,042
The pilots identify her and let her in.

324
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,209
The door remains open

325
00:26:29,292 --> 00:26:31,875
and, over the central mic,

326
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:35,375
we hear hurried footsteps approaching the cockpit.

327
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:37,875
It's clearly not the hostess.

328
00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:41,709
That indicates an intrusion into the cockpit.

329
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:44,667
Shortly before, we have isolated

330
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,875
the sound of the pilots' lavatory latch.

331
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,334
This lavatory...

332
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:53,209
is here.

333
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:55,834
The man hid in there

334
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:58,292
before entering the cockpit.

335
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:02,792
The hostess should have checked before ringing the bell.

336
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:07,042
Those are our deductions after the audio analysis.

337
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,667
I hope I've answered your questions. Thank you.

338
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,709
We subsequently hear

339
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:17,417
overspeed and imminent impact alarms.

340
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:23,084
Antoine Istier, Europe 1.

341
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:25,209
Is it a terrorist attack?

342
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:27,084
In all likelihood.

343
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,625
But the judicial inquiry is still underway.

344
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:33,000
The full transcript of the CVR

345
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,750
will be the subject of a report in the coming weeks.

346
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:38,667
Thank you.

347
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:41,292
Thanks, Mathieu.

348
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,500
Have you identified the terrorist?

349
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,500
I can say no more.

350
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:54,417
Mr Vasseur, Caroline Delmas, Mediapart. One question.

351
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,959
Sorry, no comment.

352
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,709
Forgive me...

353
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:01,542
Isn't it a little easy, blaming the hostess's negligence?

354
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,792
The CVR shows it. I don't theorize,

355
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:06,292
I analyse facts.

356
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:07,459
Excuse me.

357
00:28:55,084 --> 00:28:59,709
A lead in the recent Atrian 800 crash in the Alps.

358
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:01,209
Reliable sources

359
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:05,000
claim a radical Islamist was on the passenger manifest.

360
00:29:05,084 --> 00:29:08,250
Moqtada Sualazi, an Egyptian aged 26.

361
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,875
After analysing the black boxes, the BEA investigators revealed

362
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,959
that the plane crashed

363
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:17,875
after a passenger entered the cockpit.

364
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,292
It's too early...

365
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,459
Mathieu!

366
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:25,542
Fine work yesterday.

367
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,167
Thank you.

368
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:30,000
After that excellent job, I want you

369
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:31,875
to head the investigation.

370
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:36,209
Thank you very much, sir.

371
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,334
Excuse me...

372
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:41,250
Any news of Pollock?

373
00:29:41,334 --> 00:29:42,584
Still nothing.

374
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:46,667
Victor can be hard to reach at times,

375
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:48,500
but absent in this storm...

376
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:50,000
I don't get it.

377
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,875
I can't wait for him to show up.

378
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,959
Finish the report for me.

379
00:29:57,709 --> 00:29:58,875
Of course.

380
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:01,125
{\an8}Captain: What's that noise?

381
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:04,375
{\an8}Other sounds: Change in engine speed / Interference

382
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,417
It's Julien. You're replacing Pollock on the Dubai-Paris?

383
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,334
Yes.

384
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:17,375
A victim's husband contacted us. She called him just before the crash.

385
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:18,459
Interested?

386
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:21,542
I'm on the transcript. Try Balsan.

387
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:24,417
He's busy with the Atrian engineers.

388
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:27,334
Ok, I'll take it.

389
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:33,042
During a search, the Egyptian police

390
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:37,125
found Jihadi propaganda on his computer.

391
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:40,209
Controversy reigns as Paris asks

392
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:43,875
how the Emirate authorities allowed him to board.

393
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:50,584
Honey, I'm on the plane, I don't know what's going on.

394
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:54,250
It's chaos, everyone's yelling.

395
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:57,917
I can see mountains.

396
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I love you.

397
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:02,000
I love you, you hear?

398
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:04,209
Tell the girls I love them.

399
00:31:04,292 --> 00:31:05,875
I love you all so much.

400
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,500
I love you.

401
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,250
She'd gone to Dubai

402
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,000
for a job interview.

403
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:25,584
If it worked out,

404
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:28,459
we planned to move there.

405
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,625
When she called,

406
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:39,042
I was busy at work.

407
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,542
Too busy to speak to her.

408
00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:01,834
Forgive me, Mr Reynal, but I need the original message.

409
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,417
I'll have to borrow your phone,

410
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,250
just overnight.

411
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:44,084
One new message. October 8, at 7:56 am.

412
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:48,542
Honey, I'm on the plane, I don't know what's going on.

413
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,292
It's chaos, everyone's yelling.

414
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:57,375
One new message. October 8,

415
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,375
at 7:56 am.

416
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,625
Honey, I'm...

417
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:16,459
Time of crash, CET, 07:53 am.

418
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:17,875
Three minutes?

419
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:19,042
Yes.

420
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,667
Remember Germanwings.

421
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,084
Between Civil Aviation, the airline, Flight Radar and others,

422
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,792
no one agreed on the time by up to eight minutes.

423
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:31,500
I know, but there's this too.

424
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,750
Listen.

425
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:36,959
Honey,

426
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:40,459
I'm on the plane, I don't know what's going on.

427
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:42,209
It's chaos...

428
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:45,375
Hear the announcement tone?

429
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:47,417
It's from the cockpit.

430
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,167
But the pilot's voice isn't on the CVR.

431
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:52,209
You mean you can't hear it.

432
00:33:53,209 --> 00:33:55,125
The audio is bad.

433
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:56,584
Yes...

434
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,084
Hold on, one last thing.

435
00:34:00,584 --> 00:34:01,584
Here.

436
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Emergency d...

437
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:07,584
Emergency d...

438
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:10,667
I hear "emergency descent".

439
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:13,667
Like for a technical problem.

440
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:15,375
Play it again.

441
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:28,625
I hear "Emergency", not "descent".

442
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,250
Checked European Airlines' security protocol?

443
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:39,125
In a cockpit intrusion, the code is "Emergency Delta".

444
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:42,500
The "d" you hear could be "Delta".

445
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:54,917
Carry on with the transcript.

446
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,584
Last passenger evacuated.

447
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:43,124
58 seconds.

448
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:46,042
Congratulations, your plane is certified.

449
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,750
Thank you.

450
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,166
Thank you all.

451
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,709
- Jeanne again. - I'll let her in.

452
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:17,000
European 24, Swiss control, say altitude.

453
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:33,875
Are you making a speech?

454
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,834
It's informal. Dorval will say a few words.

455
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:40,292
Are you ok?

456
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:42,167
Yes.

457
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:44,792
You can relax, you know.

458
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:47,667
Have some champagne, chat to people.

459
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:53,917
Come and meet Varins.

460
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:06,542
Claude...

461
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,167
Meet Mathieu, my husband.

462
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:10,584
Hello.

463
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,709
Your speech yesterday was very clear and precise.

464
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,875
Thank you.

465
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:19,542
I'm not head-hunting a couple,

466
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:23,292
but if you tire of the BEA, join us at Atrian.

467
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:25,542
You'll never persuade him.

468
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:28,500
Was working at the BEA

469
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:29,667
a vocation?

470
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:33,167
He wanted to be a pilot.

471
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,292
Yes.

472
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,250
But with my eyesight...

473
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,584
I specialized in acoustics at the ENAC.

474
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,875
Flight recorders

475
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:45,042
fascinated me and...

476
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,875
There you go.

477
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,000
Fascinating but exacting too,

478
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:52,459
to obtain answers.

479
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:53,792
Which you did.

480
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:56,542
Bravo. At a time like this,

481
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:59,209
the families and everyone need them.

482
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:04,417
Let's meet the Safran managers

483
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:06,084
you'll work with.

484
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,000
- Excuse us. - Certainly.

485
00:38:18,334 --> 00:38:19,792
- Hello? - It's Samir.

486
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:22,375
The passenger data's on the server.

487
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:23,959
Anything interesting?

488
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:27,375
A few Facebook photos and videos during the flight.

489
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:29,667
Thanks.

490
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,042
Hello, everyone.

491
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:39,834
Well done, all of you, for this certification.

492
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:43,834
I'd like to salute Noémie Vasseur.

493
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:47,667
This is her final certification as, unfortunately for us,

494
00:38:48,084 --> 00:38:49,917
she's leaving this month,

495
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,667
lured away by Atrian.

496
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:55,417
Thank you for your commitment

497
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,417
and passion.

498
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,667
I'm speaking for everyone here at the agency

499
00:39:00,917 --> 00:39:02,667
when I say we'll miss you.

500
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,375
Thank you.

501
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:40,709
Where are you?

502
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:47,334
Sorry, emergency at work

503
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,083
European 24, go ahead.

504
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:47,083
Are you able flight level 400?

505
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:48,958
Stand by, we call you back.

506
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,584
We weigh 251 tons.

507
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:54,042
Just over optimal with a 1.5g buffet margin.

508
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:55,709
1.6 even.

509
00:41:56,042 --> 00:41:59,458
European 24, we are able now flight level 400.

510
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:02,375
Maintain level 380. I'll call you back for climb.

511
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:03,708
Wilco.

512
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:10,209
- Jeanne and your meal. - I'll let her in.

513
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,084
We're serving breakfast.

514
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,750
It may get rocky. Let them know.

515
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,334
Ok. I'll get your meal.

516
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,375
Sir!

517
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:02,500
Please sit down, sir.

518
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:25,417
Sir...

519
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:26,667
Sir.

520
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:28,084
Sit down, please.

521
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:30,167
Sir!

522
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,875
Don't over-interpret things.

523
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:03,334
You tend to.

524
00:44:03,584 --> 00:44:07,334
You're diligent, but all the filtering and equalizing

525
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:09,792
makes a recording say anything.

526
00:44:10,709 --> 00:44:12,459
After 20 years on CVRs,

527
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:15,792
believe me, the best filter is the ear.

528
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:18,250
And about the meal trolley?

529
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:21,375
Do you really think a trolley

530
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:23,875
can stop a madman hijacking a plane?

531
00:44:25,292 --> 00:44:26,209
No, but...

532
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:28,459
Focus on what we really hear.

533
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,042
Report by Monday?

534
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:34,084
Yes.

535
00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:39,042
Excuse me...

536
00:44:39,417 --> 00:44:41,209
I need Pollock's input.

537
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:44,542
I can't complete a report like this.

538
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:47,042
You'll have to.

539
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,542
He's officially missing.

540
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:52,000
The police are investigating.

541
00:44:52,792 --> 00:44:54,084
Anything's possible.

542
00:44:57,709 --> 00:44:59,709
I admit we're worried.

543
00:45:01,709 --> 00:45:04,125
A Turkish company applied.

544
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:07,084
Serious but, with the crash, the Germans

545
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,000
are wary.

546
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:09,167
You've decided?

547
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:11,709
A work group is handling it.

548
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:16,000
What's up?

549
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,625
Doubts about the crash.

550
00:45:23,042 --> 00:45:24,500
Inconsistencies...

551
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:27,417
- Inconsistencies? - It's awkward like this.

552
00:45:30,584 --> 00:45:32,709
There's a problem with the CVR.

553
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:36,459
What kind of problem?

554
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:39,000
I'll tell you.

555
00:45:39,584 --> 00:45:40,667
I'll tell you.

556
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:42,334
It's a big case.

557
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,209
Keep your head this time.

558
00:45:55,584 --> 00:45:57,584
Victor Pollock. Leave a message.

559
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,084
How did he get the case?

560
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:09,792
He heard phantom sounds again.

561
00:46:09,959 --> 00:46:11,959
That you can't hear, huh?

562
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:13,292
You'll see.

563
00:46:13,459 --> 00:46:15,334
It's like the Cessna again.

564
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:42,875
What's that?

565
00:46:43,042 --> 00:46:44,667
The Bourget Falcon 20.

566
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:47,209
The pilot and the tower.

567
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:49,834
Limited bandwidth is tough.

568
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:53,084
- What is it? - Tell me,

569
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,125
when you listened to the CVR with Pollock,

570
00:46:56,459 --> 00:46:58,209
did you notice anything odd?

571
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,125
No, nothing special.

572
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,209
When did you finish?

573
00:47:03,042 --> 00:47:04,834
Midnight. He stayed. Why?

574
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,750
You finished before he did?

575
00:47:07,917 --> 00:47:12,500
Pollock was anxious to carry on. Are you done? I need to get on.

576
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:21,625
I hear a thud on the first call.

577
00:47:21,709 --> 00:47:23,375
Probably a bird.

578
00:47:23,459 --> 00:47:25,334
Then the engine surges fast,

579
00:47:25,417 --> 00:47:28,292
beyond its limit, up to 200%, before exploding.

580
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:32,334
The engineer will deny it but it's happened before with that plane.

581
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,042
Continue

582
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:20,459
for 50 metres.

583
00:49:28,709 --> 00:49:31,209
You have reached your destination.

584
00:53:59,917 --> 00:54:01,334
The file is empty

585
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,042
Basement speakers

586
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,250
Down, boy.

587
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,625
Down.

588
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:12,167
Looking for something?

589
00:56:13,792 --> 00:56:14,625
Sorry?

590
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:16,459
Looking for something?

591
00:56:16,709 --> 00:56:17,709
Yes.

592
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:20,084
Victor Pollock. He lives here?

593
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,750
Yes. And?

594
00:56:22,209 --> 00:56:25,334
I work with him. I rang, but there's no reply.

595
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,084
Have you seen him?

596
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,500
Not recently.

597
00:56:28,584 --> 00:56:30,625
Your colleagues came yesterday.

598
00:56:30,792 --> 00:56:31,917
He wasn't here.

599
00:56:33,167 --> 00:56:34,167
Ok.

600
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,250
Ok, thank you.

601
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:06,709
CVR Opening and Analysis

602
00:59:54,834 --> 00:59:56,042
- Hello? - Mr Vasseur?

603
00:59:56,209 --> 00:59:58,584
Caroline Delmas, Mediapart.

604
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:00,959
We met at the press point.

605
01:00:01,042 --> 01:00:02,250
Who gave you my number?

606
01:00:02,334 --> 01:00:05,459
You know the Atrian 800 has automation issues?

607
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:07,542
I can't talk to the press.

608
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:11,125
With the Bourget salon coming up, a fault would look bad.

609
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,125
Are you still there?

610
01:00:15,709 --> 01:00:17,375
I have to go. Goodbye.

611
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,792
A new coup for Pegase Security

612
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
{\an8}The CEO, Xavier Renaud, is a leader in aeronautics.

613
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,542
Pegase is specialized in civil aviation security.

614
01:00:44,834 --> 01:00:46,542
Renaud signed a lucrative deal

615
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:48,250
with Atrian...

616
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:49,625
Here.

617
01:00:50,209 --> 01:00:51,584
The flight reports.

618
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:54,792
What're you after?

619
01:00:55,209 --> 01:00:56,542
{\an8}Look, another.

620
01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:59,584
{\an8}Paris-Washington, a control surface problem.

621
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,334
Three in six months.

622
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,417
Jolts and lagging reported each time.

623
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:09,125
Maintenance reports?

624
01:01:09,209 --> 01:01:10,584
I brought them.

625
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,042
Here.

626
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:16,334
Nothing to report

627
01:01:19,334 --> 01:01:21,917
Could the 800 have a control problem?

628
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:23,584
I don't think so.

629
01:01:27,584 --> 01:01:30,542
Is the MHD an anti-stalling system?

630
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:33,042
It lowers the nose if it pitches up.

631
01:01:33,209 --> 01:01:35,250
How would a MHD problem look?

632
01:01:35,417 --> 01:01:38,500
- Can the pilots override it? - In theory, no.

633
01:01:38,584 --> 01:01:39,917
No reason to.

634
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:42,250
Tested the crash one?

635
01:01:42,334 --> 01:01:44,292
Why? We know what happened.

636
01:01:44,459 --> 01:01:46,167
- Received it? - Not yet.

637
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:48,459
We need to check it when you do.

638
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Samir...

639
01:01:51,084 --> 01:01:52,084
Samir.

640
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:56,459
Sorry to ask, but don't tell Rénier yet.

641
01:01:57,209 --> 01:01:58,209
Don't screw up.

642
01:02:07,584 --> 01:02:09,417
Atrian 800 technical incident

643
01:02:10,542 --> 01:02:13,334
Captain: Alain Roussin

644
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:17,959
Mr Roussin?

645
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,167
Mr Roussin!

646
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,292
Hello, Mathieu Vasseur.

647
01:02:23,834 --> 01:02:27,584
Remember me? The EM315 runway excursion simulation.

648
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:28,917
I have a flight.

649
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,292
I have some questions about the Dubai-Paris case.

650
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:33,750
I don't have time.

651
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:39,000
I understand you not wanting to answer, but I need your help.

652
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:43,125
You had a control surface problem on the 800?

653
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:45,959
Could the MHD be faulty?

654
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,584
Why ask me that?

655
01:02:49,959 --> 01:02:52,959
Ask Atrian. The BEA gets on well with them.

656
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:56,084
I have to be in my cockpit in five minutes.

657
01:02:57,834 --> 01:03:01,667
You talked more to defend a colleague. Now 300 people have died.

658
01:03:02,084 --> 01:03:03,792
It's a dumb Atrian system.

659
01:03:03,959 --> 01:03:05,875
The machine pilots the pilot.

660
01:03:05,959 --> 01:03:07,459
I told you that.

661
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,125
I'm ready to listen now.

662
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,125
Give me five minutes.

663
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:16,667
The plane was marketed too soon, to counter the competition.

664
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:20,417
They turned a blind eye to the auto-pilot system?

665
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:26,000
Qatar and India had signed. The penalties for delay were astronomic.

666
01:03:26,459 --> 01:03:29,334
But the certification commission ran checks.

667
01:03:29,834 --> 01:03:31,000
You're that naive?

668
01:03:31,584 --> 01:03:35,459
The pride of European aviation. Atrian's influence is huge.

669
01:03:37,792 --> 01:03:39,709
Heard of Claude Varins?

670
01:03:40,042 --> 01:03:41,917
He has people on the commission.

671
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:56,042
Alain! The crew is waiting.

672
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:57,959
I have to go.

673
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,542
We need to talk.

674
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:01,625
I'll be in touch.

675
01:04:32,292 --> 01:04:34,042
They want me next week.

676
01:04:34,209 --> 01:04:37,125
They'll exploit me to the last minute.

677
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,667
What is it now?

678
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,334
A study group on drone traffic.

679
01:04:51,084 --> 01:04:54,042
Heard of control surface problems on the 800?

680
01:04:55,917 --> 01:04:58,375
We had pilot reports six months ago.

681
01:04:59,917 --> 01:05:01,667
Certification saw nothing?

682
01:05:02,209 --> 01:05:04,125
Why? For your investigation?

683
01:05:04,292 --> 01:05:06,167
I'd just like an answer.

684
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:08,750
It's absurd, Mathieu.

685
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:12,875
You think the plane has a problem?

686
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:21,084
There were latency problems, but they were resolved.

687
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,834
So why do the pilots say the MHD took over the plane?

688
01:05:24,917 --> 01:05:26,875
You know that's pure fantasy.

689
01:05:26,959 --> 01:05:29,167
It's just an assistance system.

690
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:32,042
But which pilots do you mean?

691
01:05:32,209 --> 01:05:36,292
Those opposed to automation and cockpit cameras?

692
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:39,709
They'll say anything to keep their old habits.

693
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,459
You really think the agency would approve a faulty plane?

694
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:50,250
We did our job and Atrian complied.

695
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:51,417
C'mon, drive.

696
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:53,834
I forgot how close you are.

697
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:55,792
Meaning what?

698
01:05:55,959 --> 01:05:58,042
There's a report on those tests?

699
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:02,334
Forget I mentioned it. It's confidential.

700
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,584
There was a report.

701
01:06:04,917 --> 01:06:07,917
It's confidential, ok. You're a drag. Now drive.

702
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:11,625
Drive, I said!

703
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:22,750
You won't give up?

704
01:06:22,917 --> 01:06:24,709
I need to test the MHD.

705
01:06:24,792 --> 01:06:26,959
The facts are confirmed.

706
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:30,042
They're your conclusions.

707
01:06:30,459 --> 01:06:31,667
I know.

708
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:35,292
The MHD is in a Defence Ministry warehouse.

709
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:37,917
Why Defence?

710
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,417
It's sensitive.

711
01:06:39,584 --> 01:06:42,875
They've sealed the plane's avionics.

712
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,417
You could order them to return the MHD.

713
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:52,834
I won't do that without tangible evidence.

714
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,167
Return to your other files.

715
01:06:58,084 --> 01:07:00,042
How's the Dauphin crash going?

716
01:07:01,709 --> 01:07:03,250
I'm still waiting.

717
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:13,917
This is Alain Roussin. Please leave a message.

718
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,084
This is Mathieu Vasseur again.

719
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:21,334
You said we could meet. I need to talk to you.

720
01:07:21,959 --> 01:07:23,250
Please call me.

721
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:28,625
This is Alain Roussin...

722
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,417
Stop calling me!

723
01:07:39,209 --> 01:07:40,792
I don't want to see you.

724
01:07:41,459 --> 01:07:43,250
I don't understand.

725
01:07:43,334 --> 01:07:45,375
Stop calling me, ok!

726
01:07:45,459 --> 01:07:48,000
I thought we agreed...

727
01:07:59,917 --> 01:08:01,625
I keep hearing about you.

728
01:08:02,584 --> 01:08:06,459
You harassed a pilot and questioned the 800's reliability?

729
01:08:06,542 --> 01:08:07,542
Who said that?

730
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:09,167
Noémie?

731
01:08:09,209 --> 01:08:13,209
No, European's sales manager. You think Noémie and I talk about you?

732
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,625
Trying to get fired?

733
01:08:16,542 --> 01:08:19,250
Noémie's new job is sensitive.

734
01:08:19,417 --> 01:08:22,875
She needs your support, not conspiracy theories.

735
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:26,250
I say that as a friend.

736
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,834
Don't shoot yourself in the foot.

737
01:08:36,084 --> 01:08:37,542
Where's that from?

738
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:41,917
3 years I've worked with Pollock, you never said you knew him.

739
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:44,167
We met in a work group.

740
01:08:44,334 --> 01:08:45,584
Working on what?

741
01:08:46,917 --> 01:08:51,042
A distress beacon to permanently locate a plane in flight.

742
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:52,709
Why show me this?

743
01:08:53,334 --> 01:08:54,625
I don't know.

744
01:08:55,917 --> 01:08:59,792
Pollock vanished two days after the crash, it's weird.

745
01:08:59,959 --> 01:09:01,750
And I'm a suspect?

746
01:09:01,917 --> 01:09:05,042
- I didn't say that. - This is absurd.

747
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,917
What is this?

748
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:11,375
I get on too well with Noémie?

749
01:09:12,209 --> 01:09:15,959
You need to relax. You're getting worked up.

750
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:18,750
We know what happened on board. Accept it.

751
01:09:19,709 --> 01:09:20,709
Are you ok?

752
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:23,792
I have to go.

753
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:11,709
And now yet another day

754
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:13,417
marked by emotion,

755
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:16,584
10 days after the Atrian 800 attack.

756
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:18,292
The victims' families

757
01:10:18,459 --> 01:10:22,500
took part in a private ceremony near the crash site.

758
01:10:22,584 --> 01:10:26,417
They were accompanied to the site by gendarmes

759
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:29,709
and spoke to official representatives,

760
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:32,834
as well as the examining magistrate.

761
01:10:32,917 --> 01:10:36,209
Reporters were kept to one side

762
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:39,334
and were given no new information.

763
01:10:39,417 --> 01:10:41,334
The judicial authorities...

764
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:44,875
XAVIER Dinner confirmed with Varins tomorrow.

765
01:11:14,458 --> 01:11:17,375
Dinner out would do us good.

766
01:11:17,959 --> 01:11:20,500
- We're a bit on edge. - Mostly you.

767
01:11:22,459 --> 01:11:23,459
True.

768
01:11:23,791 --> 01:11:24,999
Dinner where?

769
01:11:26,334 --> 01:11:27,834
How about Matsuda?

770
01:11:28,292 --> 01:11:30,667
It's been ages and you like it.

771
01:11:30,959 --> 01:11:32,333
Yes, why not?

772
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:34,875
Tomorrow evening?

773
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,583
I can't tomorrow.

774
01:11:41,917 --> 01:11:43,292
I'll finish late.

775
01:11:45,084 --> 01:11:47,542
The drone report with Isabelle.

776
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:49,542
Thursday if you want.

777
01:11:51,542 --> 01:11:53,709
Thursday then. Great.

778
01:12:34,334 --> 01:12:35,334
Test flight

779
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:00,625
{\an8}Copy file to flash drive?

780
01:13:23,459 --> 01:13:25,542
How did you get this?

781
01:13:26,459 --> 01:13:28,084
You wanted evidence.

782
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,417
You'd better be right.

783
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:44,125
Most pilots aren't sufficiently qualified.

784
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:48,375
We have seen premature descents from crews using this system.

785
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:50,042
To minimize this risk,

786
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:52,625
I recommend the "3D" procedures.

787
01:13:53,292 --> 01:13:56,417
We hope that by using this satellite guidance system,

788
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:58,583
we can reduce noise pollution by at least 15%.

789
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:02,917
Atrian named Solignac project head.

790
01:14:04,584 --> 01:14:06,500
They just announced it.

791
01:14:18,542 --> 01:14:20,375
Claude, what's going on?

792
01:14:20,459 --> 01:14:23,375
- Why name Solignac? - Things have changed.

793
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:26,334
What do you mean? I don't understand.

794
01:14:26,959 --> 01:14:29,000
You can only blame yourself.

795
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:31,250
You really disappoint me.

796
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:33,792
I have to go.

797
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:44,917
You're wanted in the Vauban room.

798
01:14:46,792 --> 01:14:48,292
We wished to talk

799
01:14:48,459 --> 01:14:51,709
about a subject that puts us in a tricky position.

800
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:56,209
I had a very unpleasant call from Atrian's CEO.

801
01:14:56,709 --> 01:15:00,750
He claims we leaked information about one of their planes.

802
01:15:02,667 --> 01:15:04,542
You know what I mean?

803
01:15:05,875 --> 01:15:06,875
No.

804
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:10,292
A warrant has been filed on the Dubai-Paris 800.

805
01:15:11,625 --> 01:15:15,292
It was issued by the BEA, based on the initial report,

806
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:17,459
which has an electronic signature.

807
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:19,750
It's from your laptop.

808
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,167
Do you see how serious this is?

809
01:15:23,334 --> 01:15:25,625
Those tests were confidential.

810
01:15:26,417 --> 01:15:29,542
You broke your non-disclosure agreement.

811
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,500
It's gross misconduct.

812
01:15:32,084 --> 01:15:33,834
You're suspended.

813
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,334
I'm not behind the leak.

814
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,625
You can explain that later

815
01:15:39,042 --> 01:15:40,959
in a disciplinary hearing.

816
01:15:41,334 --> 01:15:43,417
Please hand over your laptop.

817
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:46,167
You can't...

818
01:15:46,334 --> 01:15:47,959
That'll be all, Noémie.

819
01:16:35,292 --> 01:16:39,167
Dorval suspended me today for gross misconduct.

820
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,125
How could you do that to me?

821
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:52,125
I'm sorry.

822
01:16:53,417 --> 01:16:55,875
- It shouldn't have... - You realize

823
01:16:56,042 --> 01:16:57,500
you'll get me fired.

824
01:16:57,959 --> 01:16:59,875
I didn't know it would leak.

825
01:17:00,542 --> 01:17:02,375
I needed the document.

826
01:17:02,459 --> 01:17:04,292
Why? It was an attack.

827
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,875
- You heard that first. - I didn't.

828
01:17:07,292 --> 01:17:10,584
I heard a ton of incoherent bullshit.

829
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:13,792
They stuffed the guy's laptop with Salafist videos.

830
01:17:13,959 --> 01:17:15,292
That's what's going on.

831
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:18,667
- Fuck! - You're mad.

832
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:20,375
I'm mad?

833
01:17:21,792 --> 01:17:23,500
Your dinner with Varins...

834
01:17:24,084 --> 01:17:25,084
Why do you lie?

835
01:17:25,209 --> 01:17:27,459
- What? - Why didn't you tell me?

836
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:30,334
To avoid a fit of paranoia like this.

837
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,917
Don't you realize?

838
01:17:32,584 --> 01:17:35,750
I was scared of a scandal, scared for me, my job.

839
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:37,459
Just listen to you!

840
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:40,375
Forget the job and ask some real questions!

841
01:17:40,542 --> 01:17:41,792
I did!

842
01:17:41,959 --> 01:17:45,584
Atrian got the plane certified before it was ready!

843
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:49,042
Maybe you turned a blind eye, maybe you helped...

844
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:50,250
You're sick.

845
01:17:50,417 --> 01:17:52,542
We owe the families the truth! 300 dead!

846
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:53,917
Forget the families!

847
01:17:54,584 --> 01:17:56,167
This is about you.

848
01:17:56,334 --> 01:17:57,917
Only your mad ideas count!

849
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:13,208
European 24...

850
01:19:17,917 --> 01:19:19,750
I repeat, do you copy?

851
01:19:29,959 --> 01:19:31,250
Mathieu, are you ok?

852
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:35,542
Are you ok?

853
01:19:41,584 --> 01:19:42,750
Are you ready?

854
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,500
What for?

855
01:19:45,584 --> 01:19:47,417
The test. Let's go.

856
01:20:11,834 --> 01:20:13,292
No counter-order.

857
01:20:13,834 --> 01:20:15,292
There must be. Check.

858
01:20:21,334 --> 01:20:22,625
Still nothing.

859
01:20:22,709 --> 01:20:24,709
Make the plane stall.

860
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:30,208
Stall. Stall.

861
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:33,500
Stall. Stall. Stall.

862
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:35,083
Stall. Stall.

863
01:20:35,292 --> 01:20:36,292
It's working.

864
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:38,417
- As per normal. - Again.

865
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:40,000
Redo the first test.

866
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:43,417
Again.

867
01:20:43,584 --> 01:20:44,750
Find the problem.

868
01:20:44,917 --> 01:20:47,542
- Mathieu, I think... - Let's find it.

869
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:49,042
It's not normal.

870
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,709
Try again.

871
01:20:52,709 --> 01:20:54,417
Try again, I said.

872
01:20:54,584 --> 01:20:56,084
Let me do it.

873
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:06,583
Stall. Stall.

874
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:11,250
Stall.

875
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:13,958
Stall.

876
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:16,042
- That's enough, Mathieu. - Stall.

877
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:17,625
Wait.

878
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,500
Wait.

879
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:23,375
Impossible.

880
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:26,625
It's the wrong box.

881
01:21:27,167 --> 01:21:28,459
The wrong box.

882
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:30,084
Samir, turn it off.

883
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,625
Wait!

884
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:37,708
Stall.

885
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,208
Stall. Stall.

886
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,167
Stall.

887
01:22:15,417 --> 01:22:17,250
We're gonna crash!

888
01:22:19,292 --> 01:22:20,667
Allahu akbar!

889
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,667
We're gonna crash!

890
01:22:26,542 --> 01:22:28,000
Allahu akbar!

891
01:23:43,292 --> 01:23:46,834
Hi, you've reached Noémie Vasseur. Leave a message.

892
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,209
Four weeks before opening,

893
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:55,792
the Bourget aeronautics and space salon

894
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:58,334
looks exceptional. 240 exhibitors,

895
01:23:58,417 --> 01:24:00,625
150 civilian and military craft

896
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:01,917
will perform...

897
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:04,084
You should go out a bit.

898
01:24:05,042 --> 01:24:06,709
Don't stay in all day.

899
01:24:08,709 --> 01:24:10,000
Can you take Théo

900
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:11,625
to the park?

901
01:24:14,959 --> 01:24:16,167
Maybe.

902
01:24:16,625 --> 01:24:18,750
The order books should be full,

903
01:24:18,917 --> 01:24:21,042
making Atrian a market leader.

904
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:22,959
Any news of the BEA?

905
01:24:25,042 --> 01:24:26,750
I'm summoned Thursday.

906
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:28,417
Explain things.

907
01:24:28,584 --> 01:24:30,667
Say what you went through.

908
01:24:31,084 --> 01:24:33,375
- The endless pressure... - Stop.

909
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:35,542
I screwed up.

910
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:42,250
I screwed up, it's that simple.

911
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:49,417
Know what? He was right.

912
01:24:50,584 --> 01:24:51,667
Who was?

913
01:24:52,209 --> 01:24:53,209
Him.

914
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:57,834
A useless pilot.

915
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:00,875
A useless acoustician.

916
01:25:59,959 --> 01:26:01,292
Mr Vasseur?

917
01:26:02,417 --> 01:26:03,500
Yes.

918
01:26:03,584 --> 01:26:05,959
Hello, I'm Laura Saunier.

919
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:09,167
Philippe Reynal gave me your number.

920
01:26:10,209 --> 01:26:12,625
My son was on the Dubai-Paris flight.

921
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:14,709
His name was Lucas.

922
01:26:15,667 --> 01:26:16,584
I...

923
01:26:16,667 --> 01:26:19,334
I need to understand what happened.

924
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:24,917
Sorry, ma'am, I'm no longer on the investigation.

925
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,042
Mr Reynal told me you're a good man.

926
01:26:28,459 --> 01:26:30,750
I'd like to know if he realized...

927
01:26:31,709 --> 01:26:33,792
that he was going to die.

928
01:26:35,709 --> 01:26:38,625
My son was in seat...

929
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:41,459
I can't hear you, ma'am.

930
01:26:50,334 --> 01:26:51,792
Uncle!

931
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,459
Why's it flying on its own?

932
01:27:29,209 --> 01:27:31,459
- What's that noise? - No idea...

933
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:39,000
What's that noise?

934
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:41,000
No idea. Interference.

935
01:27:43,459 --> 01:27:45,375
I can't keep my phones on.

936
01:28:03,334 --> 01:28:05,459
What made you change your mind?

937
01:28:31,417 --> 01:28:32,667
Come in.

938
01:28:34,417 --> 01:28:35,709
Come on in.

939
01:28:36,834 --> 01:28:38,500
- How are you? - Fine.

940
01:28:38,584 --> 01:28:42,417
I don't have long, an Air China delegation is due.

941
01:28:42,584 --> 01:28:43,834
Want a drink?

942
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:45,500
No, thanks.

943
01:28:45,667 --> 01:28:46,667
Have a seat.

944
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:51,625
How are you?

945
01:28:52,625 --> 01:28:53,417
What is it?

946
01:28:53,584 --> 01:28:55,125
I need your advice.

947
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:56,917
What about?

948
01:28:57,084 --> 01:29:00,667
Your firm handles computer security for Atrian's planes?

949
01:29:01,625 --> 01:29:02,459
Yes.

950
01:29:02,542 --> 01:29:05,584
How is the 800 better protected against hacking?

951
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,042
Why?

952
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:09,334
As you know,

953
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:13,500
piloting and communication systems are hard to make secure.

954
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:18,625
Could we imagine someone hacking into the navigation system?

955
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:21,125
It's unlikely.

956
01:29:21,209 --> 01:29:23,709
Data exchange and onboard wifi

957
01:29:23,792 --> 01:29:25,625
cause new flaws.

958
01:29:25,709 --> 01:29:28,000
Couldn't hackers exploit them?

959
01:29:29,417 --> 01:29:31,625
We work to remedy that.

960
01:29:31,792 --> 01:29:36,917
Could some geek enter the pilot system via the in-flight entertainment?

961
01:29:37,292 --> 01:29:40,375
Impossible, the two are physically separate.

962
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,959
Passenger cabin data on one side,

963
01:29:43,125 --> 01:29:46,084
the cockpit on the other. Separate networks.

964
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:51,500
At the ENAC reception, didn't you vaunt a single-fibre network?

965
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:54,750
Networks can be separate on the same cable.

966
01:29:55,584 --> 01:29:57,709
Don't you know about computing?

967
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,584
You think the flight was hacked?

968
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:03,750
Yes.

969
01:30:03,834 --> 01:30:07,209
And that, as network chief, you knew in real time.

970
01:30:11,459 --> 01:30:13,500
First, an auto-pilot problem,

971
01:30:13,584 --> 01:30:15,709
now hacking, what next?

972
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:18,334
A new theory every day?

973
01:30:18,417 --> 01:30:20,875
Your job is to analyse recordings,

974
01:30:20,959 --> 01:30:22,375
not to make stuff up.

975
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:25,000
I believe Pollock falsified the CVR.

976
01:30:25,167 --> 01:30:27,417
He was alone from midnight to 2 am.

977
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:30,584
And you asked him to do it.

978
01:30:37,709 --> 01:30:39,250
What can I say?

979
01:30:41,292 --> 01:30:42,917
You're pathetic.

980
01:30:44,209 --> 01:30:46,292
I have to work now.

981
01:30:46,375 --> 01:30:47,625
Xavier Renaud

982
01:30:47,792 --> 01:30:49,667
ignored a security flaw?

983
01:30:49,834 --> 01:30:52,334
Altering a line of code costs a million

984
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,250
and takes a year to be certified, so yes.

985
01:30:55,417 --> 01:30:57,875
No one could delay the market launch.

986
01:30:57,959 --> 01:30:59,042
Maybe,

987
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:01,375
but there's no proof of a fault.

988
01:31:02,459 --> 01:31:05,334
We've only seen one case of plane hacking.

989
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:08,334
A guy was arrested on landing in Warsaw.

990
01:31:08,417 --> 01:31:12,375
He said he altered airspeed via the in-flight entertainment.

991
01:31:12,792 --> 01:31:14,959
- Got his name? - Hold on.

992
01:31:19,334 --> 01:31:20,709
Apparently, it's...

993
01:31:21,167 --> 01:31:22,667
David Keller.

994
01:31:23,042 --> 01:31:25,959
These guys love to use their real names.

995
01:31:31,625 --> 01:31:33,959
Flights interrupted in Vienna

996
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:40,000
Computing breakdown at Vienna airport

997
01:31:45,042 --> 01:31:47,625
We now know more about the incident.

998
01:31:47,709 --> 01:31:51,792
Austrian police arrested a French citizen at the airport.

999
01:31:51,875 --> 01:31:54,959
David Keller, a computer security technician,

1000
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:57,334
claimed to have hacked a plane before.

1001
01:32:01,417 --> 01:32:03,000
This looks huge.

1002
01:32:03,167 --> 01:32:06,209
Keller was fired after three months at Pegase.

1003
01:32:06,375 --> 01:32:08,000
Now he's vanished.

1004
01:32:08,084 --> 01:32:10,625
No sign of him since last June.

1005
01:32:11,417 --> 01:32:13,542
Caroline, I'll call you back.

1006
01:32:56,958 --> 01:32:59,042
Return to your seat, please.

1007
01:34:01,709 --> 01:34:03,042
What's that noise?

1008
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:05,250
No idea.

1009
01:34:05,292 --> 01:34:06,292
Interference.

1010
01:34:09,209 --> 01:34:11,542
I can't keep my phones on.

1011
01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:16,459
He wanted publicity?

1012
01:34:16,625 --> 01:34:19,167
To show the fault, not wreck the plane.

1013
01:34:19,542 --> 01:34:21,500
The MHD wasn't faulty,

1014
01:34:21,584 --> 01:34:24,500
but it couldn't handle contradictory orders

1015
01:34:24,584 --> 01:34:26,375
from both Keller and the pilots.

1016
01:34:27,375 --> 01:34:28,959
You can't prove it.

1017
01:34:29,125 --> 01:34:31,625
We have the photo of Keller onboard.

1018
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:33,167
You see Keller.

1019
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:35,834
He isn't on the manifest.

1020
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:38,500
I know. He must have been erased.

1021
01:34:41,834 --> 01:34:43,792
Are you on my side?

1022
01:34:43,959 --> 01:34:45,834
You came looking for me.

1023
01:34:48,167 --> 01:34:49,792
Will you do the article?

1024
01:34:57,250 --> 01:35:01,250
CEO's Cessna found in the English Channel

1025
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:02,584
At the time,

1026
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:05,292
a whistle-blower contacted a colleague.

1027
01:35:05,834 --> 01:35:07,500
The informer claimed,

1028
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:10,375
with documents, that the engine fractured.

1029
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:13,834
But when the wreckage was found,

1030
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:15,500
the engine was intact.

1031
01:35:15,584 --> 01:35:19,250
The investigation showed the pilot overdid the trim.

1032
01:35:19,917 --> 01:35:22,500
My colleague is categorical.

1033
01:35:22,875 --> 01:35:25,625
The documents had to come from the BEA.

1034
01:35:27,167 --> 01:35:28,209
It was you?

1035
01:35:28,959 --> 01:35:29,959
Am I wrong?

1036
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,875
I heard the propeller shaft snap.

1037
01:35:33,292 --> 01:35:36,292
You thought you did, but you were wrong.

1038
01:35:36,459 --> 01:35:39,542
I couldn't wait until they found the wreckage,

1039
01:35:39,834 --> 01:35:41,667
with other planes flying.

1040
01:35:41,834 --> 01:35:43,334
But you were wrong.

1041
01:35:44,917 --> 01:35:46,667
You should have told me.

1042
01:35:46,834 --> 01:35:48,834
How can I trust you now?

1043
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,250
Don't drop me. I know I'm right.

1044
01:35:51,334 --> 01:35:52,500
Sorry, Mathieu.

1045
01:35:52,959 --> 01:35:53,959
You're a risk.

1046
01:35:54,084 --> 01:35:55,250
Count me out.

1047
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:57,792
Wait.

1048
01:36:15,292 --> 01:36:16,417
Noémie, please.

1049
01:36:16,584 --> 01:36:18,334
Just give me five minutes.

1050
01:36:18,792 --> 01:36:21,834
Blame me. Say I stole the document.

1051
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:23,584
Say it was my fault.

1052
01:36:23,667 --> 01:36:26,250
I'll talk to them. They'll reinstate you.

1053
01:36:26,417 --> 01:36:30,084
You have to help. I have no other solution.

1054
01:36:30,334 --> 01:36:32,834
I'll be fired, no one believes me.

1055
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,167
But I know the truth about the crash.

1056
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:36,875
It's all I have left.

1057
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:39,167
All I have.

1058
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:42,000
If you go back, they'll believe you.

1059
01:36:42,167 --> 01:36:43,167
Wait.

1060
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:45,667
I was wrong. It was on the CVR.

1061
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:48,167
The interference, the pilots' phones...

1062
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:50,334
It was a hacking job, see.

1063
01:36:51,459 --> 01:36:53,625
- Listen to me. - Let go!

1064
01:36:53,709 --> 01:36:56,625
- Listen... - Get out of my life!

1065
01:37:06,917 --> 01:37:09,667
Mathieu, this is a difficult decision.

1066
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:14,292
You know how I appreciate your work.

1067
01:37:14,917 --> 01:37:18,417
You also know a collective approach is crucial here.

1068
01:37:20,834 --> 01:37:23,000
You ignored that in recent weeks

1069
01:37:23,084 --> 01:37:26,459
and followed your instincts, not for the first time.

1070
01:37:28,959 --> 01:37:30,750
You've gone too far.

1071
01:37:35,084 --> 01:37:37,792
I'll have to ask for your transfer.

1072
01:37:48,125 --> 01:37:51,584
Excuse me, I need the Dauphin crash data.

1073
01:37:51,875 --> 01:37:53,375
I can't access it.

1074
01:37:55,459 --> 01:37:57,792
Sorry, I need all your files.

1075
01:38:08,542 --> 01:38:11,709
Modified: 11/10/2020 5:12 am

1076
01:38:12,917 --> 01:38:15,167
- You worked on it? - I can't open it.

1077
01:38:15,542 --> 01:38:17,334
Only Pollock and you could.

1078
01:38:20,209 --> 01:38:21,792
I'm in a hurry.

1079
01:38:21,875 --> 01:38:24,375
I'll collect the files and send them.

1080
01:38:26,167 --> 01:38:28,084
Ok. Thanks.

1081
01:39:47,792 --> 01:39:50,500
Fourty-eight point seven, six, five,

1082
01:39:50,708 --> 01:39:52,542
six, four, zero, seven...

1083
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:02,000
Fourty-eight point seven, six, five, six, four,

1084
01:40:02,208 --> 01:40:05,417
zero, seven, comma, one point eight, zero,

1085
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:08,583
seven, three, two, seven, eight.

1086
01:40:31,334 --> 01:40:32,334
Searching...

1087
01:40:42,917 --> 01:40:44,500
In 2 km, bear right

1088
01:40:45,167 --> 01:40:47,625
to join the A86.

1089
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:53,667
Had any news?

1090
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:55,250
Sorry?

1091
01:40:55,417 --> 01:40:56,959
Of the hearing.

1092
01:40:57,125 --> 01:40:58,834
It meets in ten days.

1093
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:01,792
My offer still stands.

1094
01:41:01,959 --> 01:41:03,625
I'd love you to join us.

1095
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:06,042
Thank you. I'm touched.

1096
01:41:07,042 --> 01:41:08,625
I'll think it over.

1097
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:12,750
Seen Mathieu?

1098
01:41:14,042 --> 01:41:15,334
How's he doing?

1099
01:41:16,167 --> 01:41:17,167
Badly.

1100
01:41:20,459 --> 01:41:21,959
It's awful.

1101
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:25,750
He got so wound up over the investigation.

1102
01:41:27,292 --> 01:41:30,667
He was totally obsessed about the black box.

1103
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:33,459
God knows what he heard.

1104
01:41:33,625 --> 01:41:35,750
Exactly, it was inaudible.

1105
01:41:35,834 --> 01:41:37,709
The pilots took off their phones.

1106
01:41:42,209 --> 01:41:43,334
How did you know that?

1107
01:41:47,209 --> 01:41:49,000
About the headphones.

1108
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:51,792
It's in the report.

1109
01:41:53,459 --> 01:41:55,125
The BEA already published it?

1110
01:41:55,667 --> 01:41:57,375
No, Atrian got it early.

1111
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:27,250
Excuse me.

1112
01:42:27,334 --> 01:42:29,459
The Dubai-Paris manifest.

1113
01:42:29,625 --> 01:42:32,209
Shall I give it to Balsan tomorrow?

1114
01:42:32,292 --> 01:42:33,334
Who requested it?

1115
01:42:33,792 --> 01:42:34,792
Mathieu.

1116
01:42:36,834 --> 01:42:37,834
Give it to me.

1117
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:41,417
We had the manifest.

1118
01:42:41,584 --> 01:42:43,584
He wanted the boarding copy.

1119
01:42:44,875 --> 01:42:46,292
Did he say why?

1120
01:42:46,917 --> 01:42:48,417
Attention to detail.

1121
01:42:48,959 --> 01:42:50,500
You know him.

1122
01:42:52,417 --> 01:42:53,417
Thank you.

1123
01:43:01,084 --> 01:43:02,209
In 50 metres,

1124
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:04,167
turn right.

1125
01:43:10,834 --> 01:43:12,084
Continue

1126
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:13,667
for 170 metres.

1127
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,084
Turn right.

1128
01:43:40,292 --> 01:43:41,542
Continue 110 metres.

1129
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,542
Continue 90 metres.

1130
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:16,250
It's me. I have to see you.

1131
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:19,875
Meet me at the apartment. It's important.

1132
01:44:21,167 --> 01:44:22,500
Can you hear me?

1133
01:44:23,375 --> 01:44:24,459
Yes.

1134
01:44:24,542 --> 01:44:27,084
Listen, I don't know but...

1135
01:44:28,125 --> 01:44:29,834
maybe I was too hasty.

1136
01:44:29,917 --> 01:44:32,834
Something's weird. I need to talk to you.

1137
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:37,292
Why aren't you speaking?

1138
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:38,917
Where are you?

1139
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,209
Don't worry.

1140
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:43,584
I'll see you in an hour, ok?

1141
01:44:45,667 --> 01:44:46,834
I love you.

1142
01:45:14,709 --> 01:45:15,709
Thank you.

1143
01:45:16,292 --> 01:45:17,334
Need a ride?

1144
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,250
I'll get a cab.

1145
01:45:19,417 --> 01:45:20,417
Sure?

1146
01:45:20,542 --> 01:45:22,250
Yes, really.

1147
01:45:27,959 --> 01:45:30,625
Continue 90 metres.

1148
01:46:16,417 --> 01:46:17,834
Continue 50 metres.

1149
01:46:34,542 --> 01:46:36,250
Continue 10 metres.

1150
01:46:43,834 --> 01:46:46,500
You have reached your destination.

1151
01:49:30,167 --> 01:49:31,375
Work station

1152
01:49:35,209 --> 01:49:37,625
- Jeanne and your meal. - I'll let her in.

1153
01:49:44,542 --> 01:49:46,250
We're serving breakfast.

1154
01:49:46,334 --> 01:49:48,584
It may get rocky. Let them know.

1155
01:49:48,667 --> 01:49:50,000
Ok, I'll get your meal.

1156
01:49:54,542 --> 01:49:57,167
Sooner than I thought. Seatbelt time.

1157
01:49:59,417 --> 01:50:00,917
See those cbs on the right?

1158
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,292
We were right to avoid them.

1159
01:50:03,375 --> 01:50:04,959
It looks clear ahead.

1160
01:50:05,042 --> 01:50:08,084
The CDG update. Westerly landing, visibility 3000 m,

1161
01:50:08,167 --> 01:50:11,375
rain, clouds at 800 feet, 8° C and 1014 QNH.

1162
01:50:11,459 --> 01:50:14,209
Stuck at home with the kids again.

1163
01:50:14,292 --> 01:50:17,334
- Where do you live? - Just north of CDG.

1164
01:50:17,625 --> 01:50:19,834
22° today in Biarritz.

1165
01:50:19,917 --> 01:50:22,042
You live there? Not too far?

1166
01:50:22,125 --> 01:50:24,500
My wife's Basque and I surf.

1167
01:50:24,584 --> 01:50:25,834
We had no choice.

1168
01:50:29,167 --> 01:50:30,334
What's that noise?

1169
01:50:32,084 --> 01:50:33,959
No idea. Interference.

1170
01:50:39,125 --> 01:50:41,042
I can't keep my phones on.

1171
01:50:58,042 --> 01:50:59,042
What was that?

1172
01:50:59,167 --> 01:51:00,250
I didn't see.

1173
01:51:00,417 --> 01:51:01,667
The route changed.

1174
01:51:01,834 --> 01:51:03,125
Is the FMS screwed?

1175
01:51:04,334 --> 01:51:05,542
AP off.

1176
01:51:06,917 --> 01:51:08,334
Taking the controls.

1177
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:22,500
What is this shit?

1178
01:51:22,667 --> 01:51:24,500
The AP is back on alone.

1179
01:51:57,750 --> 01:51:59,167
We're descending.

1180
01:51:59,334 --> 01:52:01,084
I know. Are you doing it?

1181
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:02,459
No, I'm not.

1182
01:52:02,625 --> 01:52:03,625
Let me try.

1183
01:52:08,667 --> 01:52:10,084
It's not reacting!

1184
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:11,792
Swiss control, say altitude.

1185
01:52:12,042 --> 01:52:13,792
I'll override the FCC.

1186
01:52:13,958 --> 01:52:16,083
Do you have a problem? I see you descending.

1187
01:52:16,542 --> 01:52:18,584
The system isn't reacting.

1188
01:52:18,958 --> 01:52:20,875
European 24, do you copy?

1189
01:52:46,334 --> 01:52:47,709
Mountains below.

1190
01:52:47,875 --> 01:52:49,000
The limit's at 15 000.

1191
01:52:49,167 --> 01:52:50,292
Pull with me.

1192
01:52:50,709 --> 01:52:52,167
- Pull! - I am pulling!

1193
01:52:52,334 --> 01:52:53,709
Nothing's reacting!

1194
01:52:54,959 --> 01:52:56,875
Cabin crew, emergency descent.

1195
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,375
Someone has taken control.

1196
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:17,459
They're piloting, not us.

1197
01:53:18,084 --> 01:53:19,875
We're gonna crash!

1198
01:53:36,334 --> 01:53:37,375
Mathieu,

1199
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:39,542
I suppose you're watching.

1200
01:53:40,292 --> 01:53:42,750
It means I was right about you.

1201
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:46,042
It also means no one will find me.

1202
01:53:46,709 --> 01:53:49,000
So go public with what follows.

1203
01:53:51,042 --> 01:53:52,792
My name is Victor Pollock.

1204
01:53:53,375 --> 01:53:56,209
I spent 20 years as a BEA analyst.

1205
01:53:56,917 --> 01:54:01,834
A few years ago, Xavier Renaud, CEO of Pegase Security, contacted me.

1206
01:54:02,625 --> 01:54:07,542
He wanted advance information to fix minor faults on Atrian planes.

1207
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:09,750
He paid well.

1208
01:54:10,209 --> 01:54:11,667
I needed money.

1209
01:54:12,459 --> 01:54:17,084
I didn't see it as corruption, just as a way to avoid bureaucracy.

1210
01:54:19,334 --> 01:54:23,250
But once we knew each other better, he asked for more.

1211
01:54:24,417 --> 01:54:26,959
I had to correct certain conclusions,

1212
01:54:27,417 --> 01:54:30,542
focus investigations on human factors.

1213
01:54:31,792 --> 01:54:33,125
I was trapped.

1214
01:54:35,834 --> 01:54:37,834
Then the 800 crashed.

1215
01:54:39,542 --> 01:54:43,000
This time, he asked me to alter the black boxes.

1216
01:54:44,875 --> 01:54:48,000
I refused, but he threatened to destroy me.

1217
01:54:49,125 --> 01:54:51,125
I don't seek forgiveness.

1218
01:54:51,959 --> 01:54:55,167
I probably deserve what awaits me.

1219
01:54:56,209 --> 01:54:58,584
But the man behind it must be exposed.

1220
01:55:00,167 --> 01:55:01,250
Mathieu,

1221
01:55:02,375 --> 01:55:07,042
I didn't take you to the crash as you might have found something.

1222
01:55:07,542 --> 01:55:09,125
I know how good you are.

1223
01:55:10,709 --> 01:55:13,959
And I'm recording this now because I trust you.

1224
01:55:55,792 --> 01:55:57,209
Basement - Lab

1225
01:56:45,167 --> 01:56:46,292
The basement.

1226
01:57:13,917 --> 01:57:15,000
Basement speakers

1227
01:57:15,542 --> 01:57:16,792
- Pull! - I am pulling!

1228
01:57:16,959 --> 01:57:18,292
Nothing's reacting!

1229
01:57:18,459 --> 01:57:20,792
Cabin crew, emergency descent.

1230
01:58:44,209 --> 01:58:45,750
Turn around.

1231
01:58:47,042 --> 01:58:48,459
Turn around.

1232
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:54,500
Jesus!

1233
01:58:59,209 --> 01:59:00,209
Fuck!

1234
02:01:15,292 --> 02:01:16,292
Noémie!

1235
02:01:17,542 --> 02:01:18,542
Are you ok?

1236
02:01:18,959 --> 02:01:19,959
I'm good.

1237
02:01:20,917 --> 02:01:23,417
- Attending my speech? - Too busy.

1238
02:01:23,584 --> 02:01:26,084
I have the Thales conference at 6.

1239
02:01:26,167 --> 02:01:27,167
Of course.

1240
02:01:27,584 --> 02:01:28,875
I'm glad you came.

1241
02:01:29,042 --> 02:01:31,375
I was going crazy at home.

1242
02:01:32,625 --> 02:01:34,417
If you need anything, ask.

1243
02:01:39,167 --> 02:01:40,875
Our generation

1244
02:01:41,042 --> 02:01:43,584
is slowly coming to terms with the idea

1245
02:01:44,209 --> 02:01:46,334
that pilots will vanish one day.

1246
02:01:47,084 --> 02:01:50,250
The challenge is to protect and secure planes

1247
02:01:50,417 --> 02:01:53,667
in which artificial intelligence is predominant.

1248
02:01:54,625 --> 02:01:57,625
Some say our ambitions are excessive,

1249
02:01:57,875 --> 02:02:00,500
calling us the Icarus of aeronautics.

1250
02:02:01,542 --> 02:02:05,750
Icarus flew too close to the sun, his wax wings melted,

1251
02:02:05,834 --> 02:02:07,792
he fell into the sea and died.

1252
02:02:09,250 --> 02:02:12,417
I never really knew if the moral of the tale

1253
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:14,875
was do not fly too high,

1254
02:02:14,959 --> 02:02:16,375
as people think,

1255
02:02:16,792 --> 02:02:20,209
or forget wax and feathers to build better wings.

1256
02:02:22,417 --> 02:02:25,250
In a perpetual quest for innovation...

1257
02:02:28,875 --> 02:02:30,917
Pegase Security is proud to...

1258
02:02:31,917 --> 02:02:33,542
My name is Victor Pollock.

1259
02:02:34,334 --> 02:02:36,667
I spent 20 years as a BEA analyst.

1260
02:02:37,625 --> 02:02:40,167
A few years ago, Xavier Renaud

1261
02:02:40,542 --> 02:02:42,084
contacted me.

1262
02:02:43,917 --> 02:02:48,417
He wanted advance information to fix minor faults on Atrian planes.

1263
02:02:49,084 --> 02:02:51,625
He paid well. I needed money.

1264
02:02:52,417 --> 02:02:55,959
I didn't see it as corruption, just as a way to avoid bureaucracy.

1265
02:02:57,500 --> 02:03:00,917
But once we knew each other better, he asked for more.

1266
02:03:01,084 --> 02:03:02,834
The black boxes doctored

1267
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,917
I had to correct conclusions,

1268
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
focus investigations

1269
02:03:07,167 --> 02:03:08,584
on human factors.

1270
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,167
I was trapped.

1271
02:03:13,667 --> 02:03:15,334
Then the 800 crashed.

1272
02:03:16,167 --> 02:03:18,959
This time, he asked me to alter the black boxes.

1273
02:03:19,625 --> 02:03:22,334
A fresh twist in the Dubai-Paris crash.

1274
02:03:22,417 --> 02:03:26,584
A BEA investigator's revelations have created an upheaval.

1275
02:03:26,667 --> 02:03:29,417
It seems hacking led to the tragedy,

1276
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:31,584
with the black boxes altered.

1277
02:03:31,667 --> 02:03:35,667
We're now joining the head of the BEA, Philippe Rénier.

1278
02:03:36,292 --> 02:03:39,500
The BEA has received a copy of the recording

1279
02:03:39,584 --> 02:03:42,417
of the Dubai-Paris cockpit conversations.

1280
02:03:43,209 --> 02:03:45,209
If it proves to be authentic,

1281
02:03:45,292 --> 02:03:48,375
it will confirm our latest findings...
