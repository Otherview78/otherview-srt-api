1
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:54,963
Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.

2
00:00:55,063 --> 00:00:58,958
Nor for the pestilence
that walketh in darkness.

3
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:01,953
Nor for the destruction
that wasteth at noonday.

4
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:04,956
Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.

5
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:07,960
Because thou hast made the Lord,

6
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,959
even the most high,
thy habitation.

7
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:14,956
Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.

8
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:17,966
There shall no evil befall thee,

9
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:20,953
neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling.

10
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:23,963
Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.

11
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,021
For he shall give
his angels charge over thee,

12
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:28,962
to keep thee in all thy ways.

13
00:01:29,062 --> 00:01:32,021
Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.

14
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:35,021
Let's take a little break,
shall we?

15
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:42,021
Hon, are you feeling all right?

16
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,021
Yeah, I'm fine.

17
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:51,021
I just can't remember
one quite like this.

18
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:01,947
He should try and get
some sleep.

19
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:03,966
Yeah. Here you go.

20
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:05,061
I'll take him,
Mr. Glatzel.

21
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:06,971
Yeah.

22
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:07,984
Thank you.

23
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:11,021
- Thank you, Arne.
- No problem. Come on, buddy.

24
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:16,947
He can't take much more of this.

25
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:18,977
He won't have to.

26
00:02:19,077 --> 00:02:21,953
Things will move quickly
now that the exorcism's

27
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:24,021
Father Gordon's already
on his way.

28
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:35,959
You're one brave kid, you know?

29
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:37,964
I was a little runt growing up,

30
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:39,930
so I know what it's like
to be picked on.

31
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,989
But...

32
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:45,021
But that was nothing compared
to what you're going through.

33
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:48,021
I don't feel very brave.

34
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:53,021
Being brave doesn't mean
you're not scared.

35
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:56,021
It means you are scared
but you hang in there.

36
00:02:58,021 --> 00:02:59,965
It's gonna be all right.

37
00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:03,020
I won't let anything
happen to you.

38
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,020
I promise.

39
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,021
Arne. When are you gonna
ask my sister to marry you?

40
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:13,954
I don't know what
you're talking about.

41
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:16,021
- Come on.
- No, I don't, I...

42
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:07,970
No! Help me!

43
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,021
No, no, no! No, no, no!

44
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:17,021
- David!
- David! Where is he?

45
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:19,021
David!

46
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:27,021
What's happening, buddy?
Are you okay?

47
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:31,021
David, what's going on?

48
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:37,021
David?

49
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:46,991
No!

50
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:48,965
Father, we need to do this,
right now!

51
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:51,942
Okay, let's get him down
to the car and we'll drive him

52
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:54,021
No, Father. Right now.

53
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:05,021
No! No! No!

54
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:22,021
Grab his arms, don't let go.

55
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:28,021
Save your servant
who trusts in you, my God.

56
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,968
Let him find in you, Lord,

57
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:33,951
a fortified tower in the face
of the enemy.

58
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:35,972
Put on the full armor of God,

59
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:38,955
that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil.

60
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:40,942
Against the powers
of the darkness of this world.

61
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:43,021
Against wickedness.

62
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:50,021
Lorraine, what's wrong?

63
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:52,021
I'm fine.

64
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,021
Lorraine.

65
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:58,953
Lord! Send him aid
from your Holy place

66
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,021
and watch over him from Sion.

67
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,021
Lord, heed my prayer.

68
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:07,021
Lord!

69
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:25,021
No. Father!

70
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,987
Father!

71
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:37,933
- Where's your first aid kit?
- It's in the kitchen!

72
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:39,021
I'm on it!

73
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:41,021
Ed, hurry up!

74
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:45,021
Hurry, Ed!

75
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:50,021
Ed. Ed, Hurry!

76
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,021
It's not working!

77
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:09,021
What? David, wait!

78
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,021
Stop it! What? What?

79
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:18,956
David! David! Help me, please!

80
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:21,951
What are you doing? David!

81
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:23,021
Help him, please!

82
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:27,021
David, stop it! David! David!

83
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:31,960
- Leave him alone!
- Arne, don't talk to it.

84
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,947
I said, leave him alone.
He's just a little boy,

85
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,020
No, Arne, don't talk to it!

86
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,020
I'll stop your heart, old man.

87
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,020
Ed!

88
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,020
Hey!

89
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,020
Listen to me. Look at me.

90
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,947
Look at me. I know
you're still in there, David.

91
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:13,020
Just leave him alone, okay?

92
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,020
Leave him alone and take me.

93
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,977
Take me.

94
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:20,936
Hey, take me. Take me!

95
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:21,984
David!

96
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:24,020
Leave him alone and take me!

97
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,020
No.

98
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,020
No, no.

99
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,965
David. David, David!

100
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:50,949
David, are you okay? Hey, hey.

101
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,020
David, go with Mom.

102
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,020
Yes, David.

103
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,020
Ed? Ed! Hon!

104
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,020
What?

105
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,020
- Somebody call 911!
- Okay.

106
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,020
Mrs. Warren.

107
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,020
He's stabilized.

108
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,954
We're gonna transfer him
to the coronary unit.

109
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:23,956
- So, it was a heart attack?
- Yes.

110
00:11:24,056 --> 00:11:25,958
And not a minor one, I'm afraid.

111
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:28,963
- Can we see him now?
- Not yet.

112
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,958
We're gonna to put a stent
into his artery,

113
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:34,020
try to get blood flowing
back to his heart.

114
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,967
So, is he gonna be all right?

115
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:44,020
We're gonna need to run
a few more tests before

116
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,020
I'm sorry.

117
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,949
- Leave him alone!
- Arne, don't talk to it.

118
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:05,020
Leave him alone and take me.

119
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
Leave him alone!

120
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,968
Hey, the mummy lives.

121
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:16,960
Hey, why did you let me
sleep so late?

122
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,959
I didn't let you,
I couldn't wake you.

123
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:21,940
- You couldn't wake me?
- No, I couldn't.

124
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,974
That's strange.

125
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:25,925
You mustn't have been
trying very hard.

126
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:27,020
No.

127
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,946
- Buddy! Easy, easy, easy!
- Okay, Bruno is right outside.

128
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:35,926
Come on.
Bruno's a worldly man,

129
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:37,992
No.

130
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,948
No, no, wait. Actually,
I do want to ask you something.

131
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:42,020
Okay. What do you want
to ask me?

132
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,020
Um...

133
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,967
It's no big deal.

134
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,960
I've... I've been thinking...

135
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,960
And now David's
out of the woods,

136
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,950
maybe we should
put all this behind us

137
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,966
and get out of this place.

138
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,020
- You know?
- You mean, leave Brookfield?

139
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,950
Sure, why not?
We've got nothing keeping

140
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,965
Yeah.
Nothing but my family

141
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:08,957
and all the money
we don't have. Arne...

142
00:13:09,057 --> 00:13:10,944
Okay, well,
money's no big deal, right?

143
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:11,973
We're both working,

144
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:13,960
and this place doesn't
cost us anything.

145
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,950
Arne, I just started this job.
I can't just up

146
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,963
- Jesus Christ!
- And besides,

147
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:21,020
Bruno doesn't know
the first thing about

148
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,984
Hey...

149
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:29,020
Let me think about it. Okay?

150
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,100
- You'll think about it?
- Yeah, I'll think about it.

151
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,020
Okay. There we go.

152
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,020
Okay, get dressed.

153
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,020
I love you.

154
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,962
I think David will love that.

155
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:48,960
- Did you call my mom?
- Yeah, I did.

156
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,958
-I told her we were going
to be very late.

157
00:13:51,058 --> 00:13:53,953
No, Arne. Please stop eating,
please stop.

158
00:13:54,053 --> 00:13:56,963
Mrs. Haskett,
so good to see you,

159
00:13:57,063 --> 00:13:58,957
- Hey, we're headed out now.
- Bye, Pookie.

160
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:00,962
I wrote down a list of stuff
for you to do

161
00:14:01,062 --> 00:14:03,945
Keeping track of this stuff
is what I'm supposed to be

162
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:05,962
Not on weekends, you're not.

163
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:06,968
I'm letting you live here
rent free.

164
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:09,955
That should buy me the weekends
maybe the holidays, too.

165
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:12,020
Okay, Andy gets one cup,
everyone else gets two.

166
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,956
Magic and Sparky are getting
picked up, so you don't need

167
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:17,957
But, you'll have to take
everyone else outside at some

168
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,957
Ruby's allergic to bees,
if she gets stung you've got

169
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:24,020
I wrote the number down
and stuck it on the fridge.

170
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,941
Yo, Arne, you wanna make
a quick five bucks, man?

171
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,971
My stereo's busted.

172
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:33,926
Yeah, sure.
I'll take a look at it later.

173
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:35,020
Ten.

174
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,956
- What happened this morning.
- I know.

175
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:40,955
Ma, okay.
Please don't say anything.

176
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:42,941
I won't say anything, I promise.

177
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:43,978
Okay, just...

178
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:46,956
He asked if we could
leave Brookfield.

179
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:48,955
You know what
that means, don't you?

180
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,020
-Actually, you mean he proposed?

181
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,968
- Did you say, yes?
- Not exactly.

182
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:56,953
Arne! Can you bring out
the tray with the meat on it?

183
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:58,928
Yes. I'm starving!
Are you starving, bud?

184
00:14:59,028 --> 00:14:59,986
Yeah.

185
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:02,020
Okay, I'll go get the meat.

186
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,958
Doctor Merrick, to OR-6.

187
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:13,020
Doctor Merrick, to OR-6.

188
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,020
It was nice seeing Judy again.

189
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,964
Will she be staying long?

190
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:35,020
I don't know, um,
it depends if...

191
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,020
The nurse says that you
have been sleeping

192
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,020
Ed would understand if you went
home for a little while.

193
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,944
Did I ever tell you the story
of how we met?

194
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:54,974
No, I don't think so.

195
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,938
Just that you were young.
In high school, wasn't it?

196
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:00,020
Yeah. We were 17.

197
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,020
I went out with
my girlfriends and...

198
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,020
And he was an usher
at the movie theater

199
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,020
Afterwards...

200
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,972
we went out for ice cream.

201
00:18:17,072 --> 00:18:21,020
He took me out to the park,
but then it started to rain.

202
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,020
And we stood under the gazebo
until it stopped.

203
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,020
That was 30 years ago.

204
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,020
I could go back
to the house, Father,

205
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,020
but my home is here with him.

206
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,020
Jesus Christ, Arne!
What the hell?

207
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,020
Can we please do something
about this racket?

208
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,966
These dogs are driving me crazy!

209
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:10,962
They probably just
smell a rabbit or something.

210
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:13,944
- How come you're not at work?
- I wasn't feeling so hot.

211
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:18,020
Arne!
Perfect timing, man.

212
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,957
Hey, why don't you come inside
with me, have a beer.

213
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:23,954
If we get that stereo fixed
we can put up a sign,

214
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:26,961
-You know what,
I don't think so, Bruno.

215
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,958
- Why, you quit drinking?
- No, I just don't...

216
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:31,938
Tell you what, we can
both quit next Saturday.

217
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:34,020
How about that?

218
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,959
Lorraine. Lorraine.

219
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,951
- Lorraine.
- Daddy!

220
00:20:56,051 --> 00:20:58,950
Ed, thank God.

221
00:20:59,050 --> 00:20:59,988
Lorraine.

222
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:02,948
- You have to call the Glatzels.
- She just called, you're fine...

223
00:21:03,048 --> 00:21:05,950
We have to warn them,
it's got the kid.

224
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:06,964
No, it's fine, it's over.

225
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:08,949
David is safe,
the demon is gone.

226
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:12,020
Arne. It's got Arne!

227
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,020
It's beautiful, man.
Nicely done!

228
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,020
Come on, man,
don't make me drink alone.

229
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,020
Your girl's gonna think
I'm a drunk.

230
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,020
Do you know...

231
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,964
that I saw these guys
play in Sydney?

232
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,948
They nearly blew the roof off
Her Majesty's Theater!

233
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:49,955
Bruno! Can you turn that down?

234
00:21:50,055 --> 00:21:52,020
I'm testing out his work!

235
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,990
Hey.

236
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,958
What's the matter?
Are you okay? Bruno...

237
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:28,948
- Let's dance, brother!
- Bruno! No, stop!

238
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,961
Bruno. Bruno! My Lord...

239
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:33,971
Okay. Bruno, go night-night.

240
00:22:34,071 --> 00:22:37,020
- No! Not until we dance.
- Yes! No, we're not dancing.

241
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,020
- One dance! One dance!
- I don't want to dance! Bruno!

242
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,020
Okay, one dance.

243
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,949
- This is Officer Thomas.
- My name is Lorraine Warren.

244
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,961
I know how this is
going to sound,

245
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:07,020
but there's going to be
a tragedy at the

246
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,020
Debbie!

247
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,020
- Arne...
- Bruno?

248
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,020
No, stop.

249
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,020
Arne!

250
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,020
Bruno, stop!

251
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,020
Arne, help me.

252
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,950
Arne, whoa. What is going on?

253
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,960
What are you doing?

254
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,020
Arne, please stop it!

255
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,020
Baby?

256
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,020
What the hell?

257
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,020
No, stop!

258
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,020
Hey.

259
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,020
You okay there?

260
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,020
Hey.

261
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,020
You okay?

262
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,020
Now, you just stay
right there, okay?

263
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,020
I think I hurt someone.

264
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,020
This is Sergeant Thomas.

265
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,946
I have one victim down,
multiple stab wounds.

266
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:20,971
Residents of Brookfield

267
00:25:21,071 --> 00:25:23,957
by the broad daylight murder
of Bruno Sauls.

268
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:25,946
Sauls, the manager
of a local dog kennel,

269
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:28,976
was stabbed 22 times.

270
00:25:29,076 --> 00:25:34,020
This is the first murder in
that town's 193-year history.

271
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,955
Who shall ascend
into the hill of the Lord?

272
00:25:46,055 --> 00:25:49,961
Or who shall stand
in his holy place?

273
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:53,958
He that hath clean hands,
and a pure heart,

274
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:56,945
who hath not lifted up
his soul unto vanity,

275
00:25:57,045 --> 00:25:58,971
nor sworn deceitfully.

276
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:01,960
He shall receive the blessing
from the Lord,

277
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,943
and righteousness from the God
of his salvation.

278
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:06,944
Right. That's enough.

279
00:26:07,044 --> 00:26:08,020
Thank you.

280
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,989
Well?

281
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:16,950
These religious objects
would've been enough

282
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,955
to provoke an inhuman spirit,

283
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:21,020
if there was one present.

284
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,967
Does that mean
he's not possessed?

285
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:29,948
The fact that he can read
from the Bible just seals it.

286
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:32,020
So, what does this mean, then...

287
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,020
I'm just crazy?

288
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,020
Well... you're not possessed.

289
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,020
But that doesn't mean
that you weren't.

290
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,961
I... invited this
thing into me,

291
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:50,020
and that's the reason
that he's dead.

292
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,946
So, you know,
whatever happens to me,

293
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:55,953
I've got it coming.

294
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:58,020
No, you don't.

295
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,020
Look...

296
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,020
I was there.

297
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,962
Whatever is going on...

298
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:12,020
whatever happened that day...

299
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,020
that was not Arne.

300
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,020
We're going to help you
in every way that we can.

301
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,020
If the demon's gone,
what can you do now?

302
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,975
Who's your lawyer?

303
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:36,959
He was found covered
in the victim's blood.

304
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:40,020
The murder weapon
belongs to him and it's got

305
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,948
Nobody's disputing any of that.
Arne knows that he's going

306
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:47,020
All we're saying
is that there were

307
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,963
Mitigating circumstances?

308
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:52,961
Look, I don't think
he should get

309
00:27:53,061 --> 00:27:54,958
But I am not going
before a grand jury

310
00:27:55,058 --> 00:27:56,947
and saying he was possessed
by demons.

311
00:27:57,047 --> 00:27:58,972
It's never been done.

312
00:27:59,072 --> 00:28:00,960
Yes it has! It's been done
twice in England.

313
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,955
The Michael Taylor case
was just a few years ago.

314
00:28:03,055 --> 00:28:05,945
Let me rephrase that.
It's never been done

315
00:28:06,045 --> 00:28:07,973
Then let us help you.

316
00:28:08,073 --> 00:28:11,960
Ed and I have proven
the existence of the demonic

317
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,957
You've proven it to the church.
This is a court of law.

318
00:28:16,057 --> 00:28:17,953
The standards of evidence
are completely different.

319
00:28:18,053 --> 00:28:18,962
The courts accepts
the existence of God

320
00:28:19,062 --> 00:28:21,959
every time a witness swears
to tell the truth.

321
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:26,020
I think it's about time
they accept the existence

322
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,955
How are you going
to convince a jury

323
00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:34,020
if you can't even convince me?

324
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,963
I'll tell you what.
You come over to our house

325
00:28:40,063 --> 00:28:43,944
We'll show you the evidence
we've collected over the years.

326
00:28:44,044 --> 00:28:45,965
Introduce you to Annabelle.

327
00:28:46,065 --> 00:28:49,020
If you're not convinced,
we'll butt out.

328
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,020
Deal?

329
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,020
All right.
Show me what you got.

330
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,960
Mr. Johnson,
to count one of indictment

331
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,941
which charges you with
first-degree murder,

332
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,958
a class-A felony,

333
00:29:07,058 --> 00:29:08,973
how do you plead?

334
00:29:09,073 --> 00:29:10,954
Your Honor,
my client pleads not guilty

335
00:29:11,054 --> 00:29:14,020
by reason of demonic possession.

336
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,960
This is ridiculous.
I can walk down

337
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,934
Hush. You shouldn't
even be out of bed.

338
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:42,980
Lorraine.

339
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,960
I just talked
to a friend of mine

340
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,961
He's gonna go for
the death penalty.

341
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:52,952
I'll build the case,
but that kid is gonna

342
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:55,956
depending on what you two find.

343
00:29:56,056 --> 00:29:57,141
Well, we won't let him down.

344
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,964
I hope not.

345
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,020
Keep me posted.

346
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,981
So, what now?

347
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:10,952
We've never had to prove
a possession after the fact.

348
00:30:11,052 --> 00:30:13,957
Demons don't just
disappear like this.

349
00:30:14,057 --> 00:30:14,961
There's something else
going on here,

350
00:30:15,061 --> 00:30:17,020
something that we missed
the first time.

351
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,020
Where do we start?

352
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,020
At the beginning.

353
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,970
It's July 18th, 1981.

354
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,955
This is Ed Warren,
here with Lorraine...

355
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:35,956
and Judy Glatzel,
Deborah Glatzel,

356
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:38,957
David Glatzel and Arne Johnson.

357
00:30:39,057 --> 00:30:40,963
All right, let's get started.

358
00:30:41,063 --> 00:30:43,959
Who was there
when David first started

359
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:48,956
We all were.
It was the day we moved in.

360
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:51,020
There you go.
Go have fun with them.

361
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,951
- Wanna order some pizza?
- Yeah sure,

362
00:30:55,051 --> 00:30:56,951
- Hey.
- Put that box down

363
00:30:57,051 --> 00:30:57,959
- Why?
- I just...

364
00:30:58,059 --> 00:30:58,970
What are you doing?

365
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,020
- Have a look...
- What is... Arne!

366
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,953
You know you're supposed
to do this when you

367
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:09,020
Okay, so maybe
we'll do that too.

368
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,020
No!

369
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,020
Mom!

370
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,020
I didn't know what happened.

371
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,971
It was like a dream.

372
00:33:57,071 --> 00:33:59,957
And nobody believed me
when I told them.

373
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:03,020
But that was the first time
I saw it.

374
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:19,979
I don't get it.

375
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,141
How could he have invited
a demon? He was only in here

376
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:25,021
There wasn't even anything
in here.

377
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:28,021
Where was the water bed?

378
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:31,975
Where that rug is.

379
00:34:32,075 --> 00:34:34,021
The wood got damaged
when the mattress ruptured.

380
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:39,021
- Mind if I have a look?
- Please.

381
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:56,021
That's not water damage.

382
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:14,966
Hon, will you let me
handle this?

383
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:17,021
You're going to ruin your dress
if you go in there.

384
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:23,929
So, um, the guest room's
about 15 feet in

385
00:35:24,029 --> 00:35:24,989
Okay.

386
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:29,021
- Just be careful.
- Just hold my purse.

387
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:12,021
Lorraine! Are you all right?

388
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:15,021
Yeah, I'm fine, Ed.
It's just a rat.

389
00:38:12,021 --> 00:38:12,969
It's a witch's totem,

390
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:15,963
used by Satanists
in their rituals.

391
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:19,021
Remember how I told you
that an inhuman spirit

392
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:22,021
And you couldn't imagine
how David could do that?

393
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:26,021
Well, you were right, he didn't.

394
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:32,021
We think David was cursed.

395
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:35,300
And on the night
of the exorcism,

396
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:38,931
the curse was passed
from David into Arne.

397
00:38:39,031 --> 00:38:40,987
Cursed?

398
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:44,954
Are you saying someone
did this to us... on purpose?

399
00:38:45,054 --> 00:38:47,947
We've heard of
satanic rituals like this.

400
00:38:48,047 --> 00:38:49,968
The demon is summoned,

401
00:38:50,068 --> 00:38:52,956
the possessed individual
takes a life

402
00:38:53,056 --> 00:38:55,964
Which is why Arne
was able to read

403
00:38:56,064 --> 00:39:01,957
Yeah. We think whoever
cursed David, used this

404
00:39:02,057 --> 00:39:02,957
And we'd like you to start
mailing these out

405
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:05,940
to every police department
you can find.

406
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,983
Start locally.

407
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:10,955
And, just find out if they've
ever seen anything like this.

408
00:39:11,055 --> 00:39:15,021
There might be someone else
we can ask about this.

409
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,969
Do you remember the priest

410
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:19,956
who helped expose the
Disciples of the Ram cult?

411
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:22,021
It would've been about
10 or 12 years ago...

412
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:23,968
- Father Kastner?
- Yeah, you're right.

413
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:27,945
Only it isn't "Father" anymore,
he's been retired for a while.

414
00:39:28,045 --> 00:39:29,967
He tried to help those people.

415
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:33,021
He tried to understand
why they did what they did.

416
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:39,021
If anyone is going to be able
to tell us what this is,

417
00:40:04,021 --> 00:40:05,021
Father Kastner.

418
00:40:12,021 --> 00:40:14,021
I didn't hear the car drive in.

419
00:40:16,021 --> 00:40:18,957
Would either of you care
for an omelet?

420
00:40:19,057 --> 00:40:21,959
We had breakfast before
we left home.

421
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:25,021
I'm Ed Warren,
this is my wife Lorraine.

422
00:40:29,021 --> 00:40:31,021
I have chicken shit on my hands.

423
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:40,021
Thank you.

424
00:40:48,021 --> 00:40:49,956
Forget you ever saw this.

425
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:51,964
You've seen it before?

426
00:40:52,064 --> 00:40:54,965
No. But I've seen ones like it.

427
00:40:55,065 --> 00:41:00,954
This is sophisticated.
It's a very nasty piece

428
00:41:01,054 --> 00:41:03,959
What I don't understand is...
is why?

429
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:07,957
David, the little boy
who was possessed,

430
00:41:08,057 --> 00:41:09,928
Why would someone
target this family?

431
00:41:10,028 --> 00:41:11,021
Why?

432
00:41:13,021 --> 00:41:15,021
The "why" is irrelevant.

433
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:21,948
The "why" is counter
to everything that

434
00:41:22,048 --> 00:41:24,958
His sole aim is chaos.

435
00:41:25,058 --> 00:41:26,971
His nectar is despair.

436
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:28,963
But someone had to
put it under their house.

437
00:41:29,063 --> 00:41:33,021
So, what does this tell you
about the person who made it?

438
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:37,021
Come with me.

439
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:02,021
I don't want to go down there.

440
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,021
What is this?

441
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:09,021
It's the reason you're here.

442
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:29,021
I collected these
while I was studying

443
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:45,956
- You should burn all this.
- I've thought of it.

444
00:42:46,056 --> 00:42:50,954
But I felt it was safer
to keep them locked.

445
00:42:51,054 --> 00:42:53,021
I like taking guns
off the streets.

446
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:58,953
I don't suppose you have
all these books organized

447
00:42:59,053 --> 00:43:01,021
using the Dewey Decimal System,
do you?

448
00:43:02,021 --> 00:43:05,973
No. No. No, I do not.

449
00:43:06,073 --> 00:43:09,950
The clues you seek could
be anywhere. Or, they...

450
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,021
Or, they may not be here at all.

451
00:43:13,021 --> 00:43:15,980
Ed, don't.

452
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,957
I studied
these people for nine years.

453
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:23,964
They worshipped
Satan and his demons

454
00:43:24,064 --> 00:43:26,953
They defiled holy land
with their obscene rituals,

455
00:43:27,053 --> 00:43:34,021
and they committed
acts of blasphemy...

456
00:43:35,021 --> 00:43:39,021
But... these acts gave
them power.

457
00:43:40,021 --> 00:43:41,967
The trial of the Disciples,

458
00:43:42,067 --> 00:43:47,962
the lead prosecutor,
his wife was pregnant.

459
00:43:48,062 --> 00:43:51,950
A few days after the Disciples
were all found guilty,

460
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:55,021
his baby was born
six weeks early,

461
00:43:56,021 --> 00:43:58,021
with its heart
outside of its body.

462
00:44:01,021 --> 00:44:02,955
Three months later,
his wife committed suicide

463
00:44:03,055 --> 00:44:06,957
by laying her neck
on a railroad track.

464
00:44:07,057 --> 00:44:12,021
A master Satanist
is not an adversary

465
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:19,957
We know the dangers,
better than you might think.

466
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:24,021
This boy, who's headed
to the death chamber...

467
00:44:26,021 --> 00:44:29,021
is saving him worth
everything you have?

468
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:32,021
Because that's what it may
very well cost.

469
00:45:39,021 --> 00:45:41,021
So, you gonna clean it up,
or what?

470
00:45:45,021 --> 00:45:46,021
I'm sorry.

471
00:46:17,021 --> 00:46:18,021
What?

472
00:47:08,021 --> 00:47:11,021
It was here!
I swear to God, it was here!

473
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:34,021
Look what the Perron family
sent.

474
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:38,021
That was sweet of them.

475
00:47:40,021 --> 00:47:40,964
- I got it.
- Ed, let me.

476
00:47:41,064 --> 00:47:43,021
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

477
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:45,963
- Hello?
- Ed?

478
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,976
We've got a bite.

479
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:49,961
I just got off the phone
with a homicide detective

480
00:47:50,061 --> 00:47:54,021
he wants to talk to you guys.
He says he says he's seen it.

481
00:48:07,021 --> 00:48:11,955
Katie Lincoln
and Jessica Strong went missing

482
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,963
They were best friends
in high school.

483
00:48:15,063 --> 00:48:17,949
Katie's body was found
near here, stabbed 22 times.

484
00:48:18,049 --> 00:48:20,965
We still haven't found Jessica.

485
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:24,021
But when we searched her home
back in May...

486
00:48:25,021 --> 00:48:26,021
we found this.

487
00:48:33,021 --> 00:48:35,964
So, you're the experts.

488
00:48:36,064 --> 00:48:36,957
What can you tell me about this?

489
00:48:37,057 --> 00:48:38,965
Well, to be honest, not much.

490
00:48:39,065 --> 00:48:41,955
Only that if this totem works
the same way

491
00:48:42,055 --> 00:48:45,965
it's possible that
your missing girl

492
00:48:46,065 --> 00:48:50,957
Look, I've read all about
what you two think happened

493
00:48:51,057 --> 00:48:54,939
But I'm only interested
in leads that are grounded

494
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,977
Good. So are we.

495
00:48:57,077 --> 00:48:58,952
We were actually hoping
there might be something

496
00:48:59,052 --> 00:49:00,961
that might help prove
Arne's story.

497
00:49:01,061 --> 00:49:02,948
No, no, no.
I brought you here to help me,

498
00:49:03,048 --> 00:49:04,971
not the other way around.

499
00:49:05,071 --> 00:49:06,956
Now, we've been looking
for a link to some sort of

500
00:49:07,056 --> 00:49:08,960
satanic cult ever since
we found that thing.

501
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,950
And these devil-worshippers,
they're just people.

502
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,021
Crazy, evil people, but, people.

503
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,021
Maybe we can help each other.

504
00:49:22,021 --> 00:49:24,962
We need to see your casefile...

505
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,947
and you need to find
the missing girl.

506
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,970
So, give us a chance.

507
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,962
- To do what exactly?
- To find Jessica.

508
00:49:32,062 --> 00:49:34,954
We've been combing
through these forests for over

509
00:49:35,054 --> 00:49:38,021
I can see things that
your people can't.

510
00:49:58,021 --> 00:50:02,959
One of these is the knife used
on Katie Lincoln.

511
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:06,959
The others I just pulled
from the evidence locker.

512
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:10,021
And what? You want her to pick
out the murder weapon?

513
00:50:12,021 --> 00:50:13,962
I'll take you out there,
but first I want to see

514
00:50:14,062 --> 00:50:16,956
Absolutely not! My wife's gift
is not a sideshow attraction.

515
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:19,101
If she is what you say she is,
then this shouldn't be

516
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:20,975
Mr. Warren. Right?

517
00:50:21,075 --> 00:50:23,021
- No way! Forget it. We...
- It's this one.

518
00:50:38,021 --> 00:50:39,181
It was a one-in-three chance.

519
00:50:41,021 --> 00:50:43,021
This song's appropriate.

520
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:47,930
You know, I actually met
Elvis once.

521
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:49,986
Yeah?

522
00:50:50,086 --> 00:50:53,021
-Was that before
or after he died?

523
00:50:54,021 --> 00:50:56,021
And after.

524
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,021
You missed a turn.

525
00:51:09,021 --> 00:51:14,021
The spot where
you found Katie's body,

526
00:51:22,021 --> 00:51:22,958
They're in Danvers, right now.

527
00:51:23,058 --> 00:51:24,969
If they can find some way to

528
00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:27,950
connect what happened there
to what happened to you,

529
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:30,021
You know, it's...
It's a pattern.

530
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:34,958
They might even find out
who did this.

531
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:38,949
Okay. Well, that sounds great,
right?

532
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:41,021
- It's great.
- Baby...

533
00:51:43,021 --> 00:51:44,021
What's going on?

534
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:46,021
Nothing.

535
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,936
I'm fine, I'm tired, you know...

536
00:51:50,036 --> 00:51:51,021
Come on.

537
00:51:53,021 --> 00:51:55,021
You're keeping something
from me.

538
00:51:57,021 --> 00:51:58,300
Don't you think I can tell that?

539
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:03,021
Look, I'm fine. Totally fine.

540
00:52:07,021 --> 00:52:08,021
It's cold in here.

541
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:11,979
Yeah, right?

542
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:17,021
It's like, they're trying
to freeze us out,

543
00:52:19,021 --> 00:52:21,021
I remember what it felt like.

544
00:52:23,021 --> 00:52:26,954
You're always cold,
and you're never alone.

545
00:52:27,054 --> 00:52:28,966
David, what are you
talking about?

546
00:52:29,066 --> 00:52:33,021
That's why you can't sleep.
Because it's never quiet

547
00:52:34,021 --> 00:52:36,964
Sometimes you think something,

548
00:52:37,064 --> 00:52:39,948
then you're not sure
if it was really you.

549
00:52:40,048 --> 00:52:42,967
But now you're seeing it.

550
00:52:43,067 --> 00:52:48,021
It's here with you.
And it's telling you

551
00:52:50,021 --> 00:52:52,021
Arne, what is it telling
you to do?

552
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:07,936
You sure you should be tromping
through the woods like this?

553
00:53:08,036 --> 00:53:09,972
Yeah, I'm fine.

554
00:53:10,072 --> 00:53:11,959
Then what are you worried about?

555
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:14,021
Afraid she won't be
able to do it?

556
00:53:16,021 --> 00:53:17,021
No.

557
00:53:18,021 --> 00:53:20,021
I'm afraid that she will.

558
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:35,021
Ed, something terrible
happened here.

559
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:06,021
Katie, wait up.

560
00:55:11,021 --> 00:55:12,021
Hey.

561
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:13,976
I got you something.

562
00:55:14,076 --> 00:55:16,957
They were selling them
at the May Festival this year.

563
00:55:17,057 --> 00:55:18,947
Your parents still dragging you
up there for that?

564
00:55:19,047 --> 00:55:21,021
Every year, since I was six.

565
00:55:22,021 --> 00:55:24,962
It's dumb, but,
I thought this was cool.

566
00:55:25,062 --> 00:55:27,947
It reminded me of the ones
we made in high school.

567
00:55:28,047 --> 00:55:30,932
Will you help me put it on?

568
00:55:31,032 --> 00:55:32,021
Sure.

569
00:56:28,021 --> 00:56:30,021
All right, that's enough.

570
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:35,021
Hon, that's enough.
That's enough! Come on!

571
00:56:42,021 --> 00:56:45,934
Katie? Katie? My God.
What did I do?

572
00:56:46,034 --> 00:56:47,021
Hon, no!

573
00:56:50,021 --> 00:56:51,021
Lorraine!

574
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:25,021
Lorraine!

575
00:57:30,021 --> 00:57:31,021
Lorraine.

576
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:36,021
Ed.

577
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:40,021
No!

578
00:57:56,021 --> 00:58:00,021
It's okay. I got you.
I got you.

579
00:58:07,021 --> 00:58:13,021
She's down there.
Ed, she's down there.

580
00:58:25,021 --> 00:58:26,959
Blood pressure's a little high.

581
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:28,966
I'm gonna give you
a vasodilator.

582
00:58:29,066 --> 00:58:31,021
It's a pill, you're gonna
put it under your tongue.

583
00:58:32,021 --> 00:58:32,949
It'll open up
your blood vessels.

584
00:58:33,049 --> 00:58:35,021
Yeah, I have those.

585
00:58:36,021 --> 00:58:37,966
I left them at home.

586
00:58:38,066 --> 00:58:41,021
Yeah, well, I wouldn't do that

587
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:44,021
Mind giving us a minute?

588
00:58:51,021 --> 00:58:53,021
Recovery team found a body.

589
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:56,961
- Is it...
- We're not sure.

590
00:58:57,061 --> 00:58:58,968
Look, I know what it looks like.

591
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,938
But, I don't want any of this
getting out until we have

592
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,973
from the coroner.

593
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:06,954
You know, we dragged
this basin. Twice.

594
00:59:07,054 --> 00:59:08,966
Had to pull teeth to get it done

595
00:59:09,066 --> 00:59:11,021
We never would've done it
if it weren't for you.

596
00:59:12,021 --> 00:59:13,961
I'm just glad we could help.

597
00:59:14,061 --> 00:59:15,965
Let me know where
you're staying.

598
00:59:16,065 --> 00:59:18,021
And I'll get that casefile
to you in the morning.

599
00:59:34,021 --> 00:59:34,986
Hello?

600
00:59:35,086 --> 00:59:35,960
My God, I've been leaving
messages all day.

601
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,946
- What's wrong?
- It's Arne. It followed him!

602
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:40,970
You said this was over,

603
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:42,949
but now he's trapped in there
with this thing

604
00:59:43,049 --> 00:59:44,969
- to kill himself!
- Debbie.

605
00:59:45,069 --> 00:59:47,950
Just calm down and listen
to me. I need you to call

606
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,965
- Father Newman.
- Father Newman.

607
00:59:51,065 --> 00:59:54,021
Arne needs to be put on
a 24-hour suicide watch!

608
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:58,021
What? Hello?

609
01:00:00,021 --> 01:00:02,021
What is this thing?

610
01:00:39,021 --> 01:00:40,021
Arne.

611
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:46,021
God gives everyone the right
to defend themselves.

612
01:01:05,021 --> 01:01:07,981
This demon...

613
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:11,952
it's not here of its own
free will. It was summoned.

614
01:01:12,052 --> 01:01:13,960
That doesn't make me feel
any better.

615
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:17,949
That means, we know that this
is a curse,

616
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,021
and curses can be broken.

617
01:01:22,021 --> 01:01:25,021
All right.
Then, how do we do that?

618
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,061
Back at the Glatzel house,

619
01:01:34,021 --> 01:01:37,021
I touched David's hand
and I saw something.

620
01:01:39,021 --> 01:01:40,965
I didn't know what it was then.

621
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:45,021
But I think that I was
connected to the person

622
01:01:46,021 --> 01:01:48,963
Ed, that body they found...

623
01:01:49,063 --> 01:01:52,960
if it's Jessica,
if it's really her,

624
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:56,021
then that connection
could still be open.

625
01:02:01,021 --> 01:02:03,021
There's gotta be another way.

626
01:02:35,021 --> 01:02:37,021
Okay... okay.

627
01:02:40,021 --> 01:02:42,021
Okay.

628
01:02:59,021 --> 01:03:00,962
The Lord is my shepherd,

629
01:03:01,062 --> 01:03:03,966
there is nothing I shall want.

630
01:03:04,066 --> 01:03:08,021
He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures...

631
01:03:25,021 --> 01:03:26,021
There's nobody there.

632
01:03:38,021 --> 01:03:40,021
We'll leave a note.

633
01:04:20,021 --> 01:04:22,021
Boy.

634
01:05:18,021 --> 01:05:19,021
Please be careful.

635
01:05:53,021 --> 01:05:55,021
Do you see anything?

636
01:05:58,021 --> 01:06:01,021
No. There's nothing.

637
01:06:04,021 --> 01:06:05,021
There's nothing here.

638
01:06:07,021 --> 01:06:09,021
I'm not sensing it.

639
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:23,021
- Lorraine, what is it?
- The connection.

640
01:06:27,021 --> 01:06:29,021
It's here.

641
01:07:32,021 --> 01:07:33,021
Do you see anything?

642
01:07:34,021 --> 01:07:36,021
Yes.

643
01:07:37,021 --> 01:07:40,021
Yes, there are... some stairs.

644
01:07:41,021 --> 01:07:43,021
I heard a train.

645
01:07:45,021 --> 01:07:46,021
But now...

646
01:07:49,021 --> 01:07:50,021
there's an altar.

647
01:07:52,021 --> 01:07:54,021
All those black candles.

648
01:07:55,021 --> 01:07:58,927
There's 12 of them.
In a circle.

649
01:07:59,027 --> 01:07:59,989
Ed.

650
01:08:00,089 --> 01:08:00,936
Okay, that's enough, come back.

651
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:03,021
I can't.

652
01:08:04,021 --> 01:08:05,021
Lorraine.

653
01:08:10,021 --> 01:08:11,021
It's a woman.

654
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:14,021
Can you see her?

655
01:08:15,021 --> 01:08:17,020
I am her.

656
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,020
Can you tell where she is?

657
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:23,020
I don't know. I...

658
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:26,963
She's doing it again.

659
01:08:27,063 --> 01:08:30,020
She's reaching out to Arne.

660
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:36,020
She's trying to complete
the curse.

661
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:53,020
She has him.
She has Arne.

662
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:57,020
No, no.

663
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:05,970
No, no. God.

664
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:08,020
End this black sabbath.

665
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:12,020
By the blood of Calvary
I command it!

666
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:23,949
I got a cutter! C-19!

667
01:09:24,049 --> 01:09:26,020
Come on, kid.

668
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,020
How are you doing this?

669
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:44,020
God has shown you to me.

670
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:48,020
Then your God has damned you.

671
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:55,020
Ed. The connection
works both ways.

672
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:40,020
Lorraine.

673
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,938
You need to come back.

674
01:10:46,038 --> 01:10:47,020
Lorr...

675
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:03,980
Lorraine?

676
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,942
You need to break
the connection.

677
01:11:07,042 --> 01:11:09,020
Drop her hand.

678
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:13,020
Lorraine, let go of her hand.

679
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,020
Ed...

680
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,020
She knows who we are.

681
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:51,020
We are so sorry.

682
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:54,952
We're so sorry.

683
01:11:55,052 --> 01:11:55,980
How's Arne?

684
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,945
He'll be all right.
They got him sedated.

685
01:11:59,045 --> 01:12:00,977
We got the casefile.

686
01:12:01,077 --> 01:12:03,934
There's got to be something
here that connects these girls

687
01:12:04,034 --> 01:12:05,020
That's great.

688
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:10,020
I got something
to show you, too.

689
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:14,959
I found it in the Stregheria.
It's early Renaissance.

690
01:12:15,059 --> 01:12:19,020
The Church used it to identify
and persecute witchcraft.

691
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:21,987
Now...

692
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:26,955
my Latin is rusty, but...
I think this...

693
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:29,020
is talking about
a human sacrifice.

694
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,951
One by murder
and the other by suicide.

695
01:12:34,051 --> 01:12:36,020
Does it say how to stop it?

696
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,972
Yeah, it looks like...

697
01:12:39,072 --> 01:12:41,928
you can break the curse
by destroying the altar

698
01:12:42,028 --> 01:12:43,020
But...

699
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:46,020
this part looks like Aramaic.

700
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,965
This next part, I can't read it.

701
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:53,020
But you stopped her.
Maybe she'll give up now.

702
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:54,982
She can't.

703
01:12:55,082 --> 01:12:56,947
Once started, the curse
must be completed.

704
01:12:57,047 --> 01:12:59,020
Her soul depends on it.

705
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:03,020
We'll find another way.

706
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,301
Was there anything
in your vision

707
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,341
that might help us
find her altar?

708
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,020
It was cold.

709
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:20,020
There was water dripping
from the ceiling.

710
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,020
I think I heard a train.

711
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:29,020
But it sounded strange somehow.
Like, um...

712
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:33,020
I don't know, muffled?

713
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:34,957
Well, maybe it was underground.

714
01:13:35,057 --> 01:13:38,020
Could be. I don't know where.

715
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:41,955
This woman targeted
David and Jessica.

716
01:13:42,055 --> 01:13:42,955
Maybe there's
a connection there.

717
01:13:43,055 --> 01:13:43,953
Let me take a look at the...

718
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:45,020
Take a look at the...

719
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:48,020
file.

720
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,020
Lorraine?

721
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:14,020
Lorraine?

722
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:25,020
Lorraine!

723
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:55,983
Where is she?

724
01:15:56,083 --> 01:16:00,020
You know, the two of you have
gathered quite the collection.

725
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:04,020
If you hurt her...

726
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,020
Don't worry, Mr. Warren.

727
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:12,020
You're so close.

728
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:17,020
I'd hate for you to give up now.

729
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:55,968
He who calls forth

730
01:16:56,068 --> 01:16:57,949
The Lord of Hosts is His name!

731
01:16:58,049 --> 01:16:58,972
Deliver Thy servant

732
01:16:59,072 --> 01:17:02,952
from all the workings
of unclean spirits!

733
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:05,927
Fear and flee, unclean spirit!

734
01:17:06,027 --> 01:17:09,020
Ed!

735
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,020
Ed.

736
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,020
I'm sorry.

737
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:18,020
Ed, it was her!

738
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:20,020
It was her.

739
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:25,020
Ed, what the hell is going on?

740
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:27,020
Find what?

741
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:32,935
Where is it?

742
01:17:33,035 --> 01:17:34,020
Ed.

743
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:36,991
Ed!

744
01:17:37,091 --> 01:17:40,020
She was here!
She was in our house!

745
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:06,020
When did these get here?

746
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:11,962
They just arrived yesterday

747
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:14,020
while you guys
were driving home.

748
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:18,020
They were fresh
when they got here.

749
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:06,020
We have to find this woman.

750
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:08,964
We've identified the curse

751
01:19:09,064 --> 01:19:09,958
and now we have
Jessica's casefile.

752
01:19:10,058 --> 01:19:13,020
There has to be
something in here.

753
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,955
Okay, I'm gonna take the book
to be translated.

754
01:19:16,055 --> 01:19:18,942
There has to be a clue
about where we can

755
01:19:19,042 --> 01:19:20,967
So what do we do?

756
01:19:21,067 --> 01:19:21,967
You should go be with Arne.

757
01:19:22,067 --> 01:19:24,949
He's gonna need you tonight
more than ever.

758
01:19:25,049 --> 01:19:27,020
Ask Father Newman for help.

759
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:31,956
Drew, you and me are gonna
tear into those files.

760
01:19:32,056 --> 01:19:34,960
We've got to find a link
between these cases.

761
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:37,957
And a Satanist's power
is strongest at night. So...

762
01:19:38,057 --> 01:19:41,020
Let's hope she doesn't
try anything before then.

763
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:01,020
They've stopped his sedation.

764
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:04,020
He'll be coming around soon.

765
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,962
There's nothing
in these interviews.

766
01:20:23,062 --> 01:20:26,952
Her friends barely saw her
after she got back

767
01:20:27,052 --> 01:20:28,948
Didn't that seem strange to you?

768
01:20:29,048 --> 01:20:29,974
I mean, we're here,

769
01:20:30,074 --> 01:20:31,955
the Glatzels live here,
just 15 minutes away.

770
01:20:32,055 --> 01:20:35,020
But Jessica lived
180 miles from here.

771
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:39,020
Why is this one so far away?

772
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:44,020
Hey, where did Jessica
find her totem?

773
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,962
I just saw something about that.

774
01:20:48,062 --> 01:20:49,942
It was in an interview
with her parents.

775
01:20:50,042 --> 01:20:51,978
It was in a box.

776
01:20:52,078 --> 01:20:54,020
"She brought it back home
in a box from college."

777
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:57,060
Where'd she go to college?

778
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,020
Fairfield.

779
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:18,959
This woman lives in the area.

780
01:21:19,059 --> 01:21:21,020
Still a lot of ground to cover.

781
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:24,966
Yeah, but not
a lot of train tracks.

782
01:21:25,066 --> 01:21:27,180
Remember Lorraine's vision?
She said she heard a train.

783
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:29,976
What time was it?

784
01:21:30,076 --> 01:21:31,948
Maybe we can start
eliminating some of these.

785
01:21:32,048 --> 01:21:33,964
Probably close to midnight.

786
01:21:34,064 --> 01:21:35,461
Then it can't be
either of these two.

787
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:36,956
The commuter lines
don't run that late.

788
01:21:37,056 --> 01:21:38,954
That just leaves
this freight line

789
01:21:39,054 --> 01:21:40,140
that crosses the river here.

790
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:44,020
The river.

791
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:47,020
Dear God.

792
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:56,977
Mrs. Warren.

793
01:21:57,077 --> 01:21:57,952
I'm sorry, Father,
we tried calling,

794
01:21:58,052 --> 01:21:59,969
but we couldn't reach you.

795
01:22:00,069 --> 01:22:04,020
We were hoping you'd help us
translate a passage

796
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:09,020
Of course. Come in.

797
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,020
Thank you.

798
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:21,950
Give me your keys.
You stay here, call the police.

799
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:23,958
What do you want me
to tell them?

800
01:22:24,058 --> 01:22:25,301
Anything,
just get 'em out there!

801
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:34,980
It's the curse.

802
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:40,020
It says, the curse needs three
victims to be complete.

803
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:44,020
It refers to them as...

804
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:48,020
"The child, the lover
and the man of God."

805
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:52,020
The embodiment of God's work.

806
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:57,020
Purity, love, faith.

807
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:02,020
Has there been another?

808
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:08,020
It's Ed. It's my husband.

809
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:14,020
Last night we found a totem
in his office.

810
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:19,020
That is unfortunate.

811
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:26,020
Here, come with me.

812
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:31,020
There's something
I need to show you.

813
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:56,020
Father?

814
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:59,020
I've been here many years...

815
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:03,020
starting when I was a priest.

816
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:10,020
The church
used this mill for storage.

817
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:15,020
It's where they put the things
that they were afraid of.

818
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:19,020
Things they didn't understand.

819
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:37,020
You had a child?

820
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:42,020
Her mother died in childbirth.

821
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:46,963
The Church couldn't know.

822
01:25:47,063 --> 01:25:51,020
So I raised her here, in secret.

823
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:55,060
It was just the two of us.

824
01:25:57,020 --> 01:26:01,020
Our happiness filled this house.

825
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:07,958
I continued my studies
into the occult.

826
01:26:08,058 --> 01:26:10,020
I wanted to protect her
from all this.

827
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:18,020
Instead I created a fascination.

828
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:24,975
We must be careful

829
01:26:25,075 --> 01:26:28,020
how our obsessions are passed
to our children.

830
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:34,955
"He who dwells in the shelter
of the most high

831
01:26:35,055 --> 01:26:37,948
will rest in the shadow
of the Almighty.

832
01:26:38,048 --> 01:26:39,965
I will say of the Lord,

833
01:26:40,065 --> 01:26:43,953
'He is my refuge
and my fortress,

834
01:26:44,053 --> 01:26:47,020
my God, in whom I trust.'"

835
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:55,961
It's just the wiring.

836
01:26:56,061 --> 01:26:59,020
You know, state building.

837
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:02,952
Debbie.

838
01:27:03,052 --> 01:27:04,020
Arne.

839
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,020
What is it?

840
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:15,020
She's... she's close.

841
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:28,020
You knew?

842
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:34,020
We came to you for help
and you knew this whole time?

843
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,020
She's my daughter.

844
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:44,020
I couldn't...

845
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:47,020
I didn't want to see.

846
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:51,969
After all these years,

847
01:27:52,069 --> 01:27:55,020
I thought she'd come back
to me again.

848
01:27:57,020 --> 01:28:00,020
And now I know
the real reason she's here.

849
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:06,958
There are tunnels
under this land.

850
01:28:07,058 --> 01:28:10,020
She would explore them
as a child.

851
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:15,966
Her altar must be down there.

852
01:28:16,066 --> 01:28:20,020
It's the only thing
that can break her curse.

853
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:25,020
We need to destroy it.

854
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:32,020
She's here.

855
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:45,020
Go.

856
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:29,020
I failed as a priest.

857
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:32,963
And I failed as a father.

858
01:29:33,063 --> 01:29:35,020
Please, God, don't let me fail...

859
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:51,958
Lorraine!

860
01:31:52,058 --> 01:31:52,940
Lorraine!

861
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,020
Ed!

862
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:57,020
Lorraine!

863
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:58,939
Lorraine!

864
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:00,020
Ed?

865
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:03,020
Ed!

866
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:08,020
Lorraine!

867
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:21,020
Ed!

868
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,020
Look at me.

869
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:01,020
Open your eyes.

870
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:07,020
Look at me.

871
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:11,020
No!

872
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:16,976
Look at me.

873
01:33:17,076 --> 01:33:20,020
Open your eyes and look at me.

874
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:25,020
Open up.

875
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:47,020
Lorraine!

876
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:49,020
Lorraine!

877
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:57,958
Lorraine!

878
01:33:58,058 --> 01:33:59,020
Lorraine?

879
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:02,020
Ed!

880
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:28,020
Ed?

881
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:32,020
Ed?

882
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,931
- It's happening.
- Now?

883
01:34:55,031 --> 01:34:56,020
Now.

884
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:13,020
Ed, stop!

885
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:18,020
Stop!
Ed, I'm begging you!

886
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:22,020
Ed! Stop!

887
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,020
Arne!

888
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:40,020
Arne, please. It's okay.

889
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:43,971
Our Father who art in heaven

890
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:45,949
- hallowed be thy name...
- No, Arne. It's okay! Please!

891
01:35:46,049 --> 01:35:47,461
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

892
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:49,949
- on earth as it is in heaven.
- Arne, it's okay!

893
01:35:50,049 --> 01:35:53,020
Stop this!
Ed, I'm begging you!

894
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:56,931
I'm begging you, remember me!

895
01:35:57,031 --> 01:35:59,020
Stop!

896
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:07,020
Ed, stop!

897
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:12,960
Ed, please.

898
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:14,020
Remember me.

899
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:20,971
My God! Guards!

900
01:36:21,071 --> 01:36:22,954
And lead us not into temptation

901
01:36:23,054 --> 01:36:23,970
but deliver us from evil.

902
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:25,947
- For thine is the kingdom...
- Arne, it's okay.

903
01:36:26,047 --> 01:36:27,955
The power and the glory...

904
01:36:28,055 --> 01:36:29,974
now and forever, amen!

905
01:36:30,074 --> 01:36:32,950
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed by thy name,

906
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:35,962
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

907
01:36:36,062 --> 01:36:38,020
- on earth as it is in heaven.
- No, Arne!

908
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:41,261
Arne? Arne, what are you doing?

909
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:49,967
What are you doing? Stop it!

910
01:36:50,067 --> 01:36:52,020
What are you doing?
Father Newman, help him!

911
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:57,957
Please... Guards!

912
01:36:58,057 --> 01:36:59,958
Please! Stop it!

913
01:37:00,058 --> 01:37:01,020
Please help him!

914
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:05,962
You're not gonna do this!

915
01:37:06,062 --> 01:37:09,020
This is wrong and you know it!

916
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:15,020
Father Newman... No, no.

917
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:18,968
What's happening?

918
01:37:19,068 --> 01:37:21,020
Please, Father, make it stop!

919
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:31,940
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name,

920
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,020
thy kingdom come...

921
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:36,020
No, no, no! Arne, no!

922
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:40,020
Arne, stop, please! Stop it!

923
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:43,930
Don't do this, Arne, I love you!

924
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:45,020
No...

925
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:46,954
And lead us not into temptation,

926
01:37:47,054 --> 01:37:49,020
but deliver us from evil!

927
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:09,020
Ed... Remember me.

928
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:17,020
She tried to
turn you against me.

929
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:24,020
Because, she thinks our love
is our weakness.

930
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:30,020
But it's not.

931
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:33,020
It's not.

932
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:39,020
It's our strength.

933
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:44,020
Now, open your eyes.

934
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:16,020
Arne? Arne, are you okay?

935
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:21,020
My God!

936
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:25,020
My God.

937
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:07,020
Your curse is broken.

938
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:22,020
You promised a demon a soul.

939
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:29,020
And it can't go back to hell
without one.

940
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:49,977
My God.

941
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:53,020
It's okay. It's over.

942
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:56,020
Please say it's over...

943
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:11,020
Hon... I...

944
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:14,020
I forgot my pills.

945
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:50,020
Arne?

946
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:52,020
Arne?

947
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:56,020
Excuse me. Arne!

948
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:00,020
I love you.

949
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:32,020
Will the defendant please rise?

950
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:11,961
As we go back now,
listen to the tapes

951
01:45:12,061 --> 01:45:13,960
as well as being there
and hearing him do it,

952
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:16,939
he would constantly challenge
what was in that boy.

953
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:18,973
What does that do

954
01:45:19,073 --> 01:45:19,955
- to the whole system of law...
- Yes.

955
01:45:20,055 --> 01:45:21,954
If a person can walk in and say,

956
01:45:22,054 --> 01:45:24,020
"The devil made me do it"?

957
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:31,960
David, I'm going to
put this on you.

958
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:34,020
In the name of Jesus,
Jesus repels you.

959
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:36,020
Leave this child alone.

960
01:45:37,020 --> 01:45:39,020
It's on your forehead.

961
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:43,935
Yes, remember, you are
not strong, you're weak.

962
01:45:44,035 --> 01:45:45,020
You're weak.

963
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:48,956
Jesus loves this boy.
This is... this is His child.

964
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:51,954
Wake him out of it.
Prop him up. Do something!

965
01:45:52,054 --> 01:45:53,959
He won't get out of it
right now, Ma.

966
01:45:54,059 --> 01:45:55,959
Well he called me
names, you didn't do

967
01:45:56,059 --> 01:45:56,957
Well, what do you
think we've been doing

968
01:45:57,057 --> 01:45:58,951
In the name of
the Father and the Son

969
01:45:59,051 --> 01:46:00,966
and the Holy Spirit, amen!

970
01:46:01,066 --> 01:46:03,948
You gotta hold him down.
He told me to.

971
01:46:04,048 --> 01:46:05,961
Hold him on the ground.

972
01:46:06,061 --> 01:46:07,060
Mommy's here.
Mommy's here.

973
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:08,972
Come on, wake up.

974
01:46:09,072 --> 01:46:10,953
Come on. Get up.
Come on, let's go.

975
01:46:11,053 --> 01:46:12,958
Get out. Get out of my son.

976
01:46:13,058 --> 01:46:14,971
Get out of my son. Come on.

977
01:46:15,071 --> 01:46:17,932
Come on, son. Come on.
Get out. Get away from my son.

978
01:46:18,032 --> 01:46:19,967
Go on! No!

979
01:46:20,067 --> 01:46:21,020
I'm your mother!

980
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:23,968
No, you're...

981
01:46:24,068 --> 01:46:25,951
David. David. Wake up!

982
01:46:26,051 --> 01:46:28,969
Let the boy go.

983
01:46:29,069 --> 01:46:30,957
Look, you need to hold him.

984
01:46:31,057 --> 01:46:32,020
In the name of the Father

985
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:35,949
and the Son
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

986
01:46:36,049 --> 01:46:38,960
Do something.
Sit him up.

987
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:39,945
- It won't work.
- You can't

988
01:46:40,045 --> 01:46:40,962
It won't work.

989
01:46:41,062 --> 01:46:43,963
Mom, you're dead!

990
01:46:44,063 --> 01:46:45,951
David!
Please, get up!

991
01:46:46,051 --> 01:46:48,020
My God, get up!
