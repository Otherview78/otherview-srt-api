1
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,920
<i>Remember, remember
The 5th of November</i>

2
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,756
<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

3
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,217
<i>I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason</i>

4
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,302
<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

5
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,307
<i>But what of the man?</i>

6
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,978
<i>I know his name was Guy Fawkes...</i>

7
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:05,899
<i>...and I know in 1605, he attempted
to blow up the Houses of Parliament.</i>

8
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,277
<i>But who was he really?</i>

9
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,903
<i>What was he like?</i>

10
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,205
<i>We are told to remember
the idea and not the man.</i>

11
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,957
<i>Because a man can fail.</i>

12
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,129
<i>He can be caught,
he can be killed and forgotten.</i>

13
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,339
<i>But 400 years later...</i>

14
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,259
<i>...an idea can still change the world.</i>

15
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,264
<i>I have witnessed firsthand
the power of ideas.</i>

16
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,850
<i>I've seen people kill
in the name of them...</i>

17
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,395
<i>...and die defending them.</i>

18
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,649
<i>But you cannot kiss an idea...</i>

19
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,028
<i>...cannot touch it or hold it.</i>

20
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,866
<i>Ideas do not bleed.
They do not feel pain.</i>

21
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,076
<i>They do not love.</i>

22
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,457
<i>And it is not an idea that I miss.</i>

23
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,584
<i>It is a man.</i>

24
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,296
<i>A man that made me remember
the 5th of November.</i>

25
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,548
<i>A man that I will never forget.</i>

26
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:29,983
<i>So I read that the former United States
is so desperate for medical supplies...</i>

27
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,197
<i>...that they have allegedly sent several
containers filled with wheat and tobacco.</i>

28
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,784
<i>A gesture, they said, of good will.</i>

29
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,827
<i>You wanna know what I think?</i>

30
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,623
<i>Well, you're listening to my show,
so I will assume you do.</i>

31
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,168
<i>It's high time we let the colonies know
what we really think of them.</i>

32
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:52,589
<i>I think it's payback time for a tea party
they threw us a few hundred years ago.</i>

33
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,967
<i>I say we go down to those docks tonight
and dump that crap...</i>

34
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,429
<i>...where everything from the
Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-Erica belongs!</i>

35
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,015
<i>Who's with me?
Who's bloody with me?!</i>

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,768
<i>Did you like that?</i>

37
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:09,106
<i>U.S.A., Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-Erica.
I mean, what else can you say?</i>

38
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,859
<i>Here was a country that had everything,
absolutely everything...</i>

39
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,362
<i>...and now, 20 years later, is what?</i>

40
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:19,199
<i>The world's biggest leper colony. Why?</i>

41
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,451
<i>Godlessness.</i>

42
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,245
<i>Let me say that again.</i>

43
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,705
<i>Godlessness.</i>

44
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,458
<i>It wasn't the war they started.
It wasn't the plague they created.</i>

45
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,836
<i>It was Judgment.</i>

46
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:35,132
<i>No one escapes their past.
No one escapes Judgment.</i>

47
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,552
<i>You think he's not up there?</i>

48
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,221
<i>You think he's not watching over
this country?</i>

49
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>How else can you explain it?
He tested us, but we came through.</i>

50
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,185
<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

51
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,440
<i>Islington. Enfield.
I was there. I saw it all.</i>

52
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,984
<i>Immigrants, Muslims...</i>

53
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,903
<i>...homosexuals, terrorists.</i>

54
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,991
<i>Disease-ridden degenerates.
They had to go.</i>

55
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,327
<i>Strength through unity.
Unity through faith.</i>

56
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:08,457
<i>I am a God-fearing Englishman,
and I'm goddamn proud of it!</i>

57
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,001
That's quite enough of that,
thank you very much.

58
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,421
Oh, shit.

59
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:20,302
<i>A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.</i>

60
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,805
<i>Any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest.</i>

61
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,475
<i>This is for your protection.</i>

62
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,936
<i>A yellow-coded curfew
is now in effect.</i>

63
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,565
<i>Any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest.</i>

64
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,150
<i>This is for your protection.</i>

65
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,279
- Whoa! Excuse me.
- Sorry, I didn't see you--

66
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,114
- In a hurry, are we?
- I was just--

67
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,992
- It's past curfew, you know.
- My uncle, he's very sick.

68
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,746
- Sick uncle? What you think, Willy?
- It's a load of bollocks.

69
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,832
I made a mistake. I shouldn't be out
after curfew. I know that.

70
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,336
Maybe you could look after us
before getting back to your uncle.

71
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,671
See, my friend, he's kind of sick.
Ain't you?

72
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,674
Real sick. Bad case of the blues.
You can feel them.

73
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,512
- Don't touch me!
- Look, Willy, kitty's got claws.

74
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,473
- She just threatened us.
- That she did, that she did.

75
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,225
You know what that means,
don't you?

76
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,144
It means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion.

77
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,188
And you get to swallow it.

78
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,482
- You're Fingermen.
- She's getting the picture.

79
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,359
No, please, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

80
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,528
Not yet you're not. But you will be.

81
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,240
By sunup, if you're not the sorriest
piece of ass in all of London...

82
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,826
...then you'll certainly be the sorest.

83
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,540
Oh, God, no. Please don't do this.

84
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,209
I'll go home.
I won't do it again, I swear! Please!

85
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,629
- What do you think, lads?
- Spare the rod, spoil the child.

86
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,381
Help me! Someone help!

87
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,884
The multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him.

88
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,096
- What the hell?!
- Bugger off!

89
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,348
Disdaining fortune,
with his brandish'd steel...

90
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,392
...which smoked with bloody execution.

91
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,102
We're Fingermen, pal.

92
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,291
Aha!

93
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,930
Jesus Christ! Mercy!

94
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,266
We are oft to blame in this--
'Tis too much proved.

95
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,518
- -That with devotion's visage
and pious action...

96
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,312
...we do sugar o'er the devil himself.

97
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,148
- What's that mean?
- Spare the rod.

98
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,780
I can assure you, I mean you no harm.

99
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,616
- Who are you?
- Who?

100
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,243
Who is but the form
following the function of what...

101
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,245
...and what I am is a man in a mask.

102
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,456
- Oh, I can see that.
- Of course you can.

103
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,791
I'm not questioning your powers
of observation.

104
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:01,046
I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is.

105
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:05,842
- Oh. Right.
- But on this most auspicious of nights...

106
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,304
...permit me then, in lieu of
the more commonplace sobriquet...

107
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,682
...to suggest the character
of this dramatis persona.

108
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,393
Voilà!

109
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,562
In view, a humble
vaudevillian veteran...

110
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,900
...cast vicariously as both victim
and villain by the vicissitudes of fate.

111
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,778
This visage,
no mere veneer of vanity...

112
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,448
...is a vestige of the vox populi,
now vacant, vanished.

113
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,994
However, this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified...

114
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,873
...and has vowed to vanquish these venal
and virulent vermin van guarding vice...

115
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,835
...and vouchsafing the violently vicious
and voracious violation of volition.

116
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,136
The only verdict is vengeance,
a vendetta...

117
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,015
...held as a votive not in vain,
for the value and veracity of such...

118
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,477
...shall one day vindicate the vigilant
and the virtuous.

119
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,984
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose.

120
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,070
So let me simply add that it's
my very good honor to meet you...

121
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,947
...and you may call me V.

122
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,201
Are you, like, a crazy person?

123
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,412
I am quite sure they will say so.

124
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,539
But to whom, might I ask,
am I speaking?

125
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,584
- I'm Evey.
- Evey?

126
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,129
E-vey. Of course you are.

127
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,007
- What does that mean?
- It means that I, like God...

128
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,385
...do not play with dice
and do not believe in coincidence.

129
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,387
Are you hurt?

130
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,264
No, I'm fine.

131
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,101
- Thanks to you.
- Oh, I merely played my part.

132
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,980
- But tell me, do you enjoy music, Evey?
- I suppose.

133
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,190
You see, I'm a musician of sorts...

134
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,735
...and on my way to give
a very special performance.

135
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,486
What kind of musician?

136
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,530
Percussion instruments
are my speciality.

137
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:54,034
But tonight I intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event...

138
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,244
...and would be honored
if you could join me.

139
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,538
I don't think so.
I should be getting home.

140
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,249
I promise you, it'll be like
nothing you've ever seen.

141
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,210
And afterwards,
you'll return home safely.

142
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,630
All right.

143
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,051
It's beautiful up here.

144
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,597
A more perfect stage
could not be asked for.

145
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,265
I don't see any instruments.

146
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,351
Your powers of observation
continue to serve you well.

147
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:25,774
But wait. It is to Madame Justice
that I dedicate this concerto...

148
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,235
...in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts...

149
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,448
...and in recognition of the imposter
that stands in her stead.

150
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,826
Tell me, do you know
what day it is, Evey?

151
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,372
- November the 4th?
- Not anymore.

152
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,799
<i>Remember, remember
The 5th of November</i>

153
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,052
<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

154
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,180
<i>I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason</i>

155
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,891
<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

156
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,606
First, the overture.

157
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,651
Yes.

158
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,112
Yes, the strings.

159
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,740
Listen carefully, can you hear it?

160
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,993
Now the brass.

161
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,912
I can hear it!

162
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,004
Look outside, Mommy!
They're playing music!

163
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,845
- How do you do that?
- Wait.

164
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,930
Here comes the crescendo!

165
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,023
How beautiful, is it not?

166
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,914
<i>Gentlemen, you have had four hours.
You had better have results. Mr. Creedy.</i>

167
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,959
The Bailey area is quarantined.

168
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,378
All significant witnesses
have been detained.

169
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,754
<i>Good. Mr. Etheridge?</i>

170
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,967
A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.

171
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,887
The DCD was Tchaikovsky's
<i>1812 Overture.</i>

172
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,514
<i>Add it to the blacklist.
I never want to hear that again.</i>

173
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,891
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,811
We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance...

175
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:30,565
...indicating a high percentage
of conversation about the explosion.

176
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,692
<i>Mr. Dascomb,
what are we doing about that?</i>

177
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,236
We're calling it
an emergency demolition.

178
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,448
We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the interlink.

179
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,827
Experts have been lined up to testify
against the Bailey's structural integrity.

180
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,955
<i>I want Prothero to speak on
the dangers of these old buildings...</i>

181
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,584
<i>...and how we must avoid clinging
to the edifice of a decadent past.</i>

182
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:53,421
<i>He should conclude that the New Bailey
will become the symbol of our time...</i>

183
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,758
<i>...and the future
that our conviction has rewarded us.</i>

184
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,134
<i>Mr. He yer.</i>

185
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,512
Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist...

186
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,058
...though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible.

187
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:10,396
We also managed to get a picture of
the girl that Creedy's men were detaining.

188
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,857
- <i>Who is she, Mr. Finch?</i>
- Not sure yet, sir.

189
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,568
- But we're working on several leads.
- <i>Anything else?</i>

190
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,528
We located the fireworks launch...

191
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,573
...and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites.

192
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,995
Unfortunately it appears that despite
the heavy level of sophistication...

193
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,874
...these devices were homemade
with over-the-counter chemicals...

194
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,543
...making them very difficult to trace.

195
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,547
Whoever he is, chancellor,
he's very good.

196
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,093
<i>Spare us your professional annotations,
Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant.</i>

197
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,970
Apologies, chancellor.

198
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,805
<i>Gentlemen, this is a test.</i>

199
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,599
<i>Moments such as these
are matters of faith.</i>

200
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,978
<i>To fail is to invite doubt
into everything we believe...</i>

201
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,813
<i>...everything we have fought for.</i>

202
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:56,943
<i>Doubt will plunge this country back
into chaos, and I will not let that happen.</i>

203
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,654
<i>Gentlemen, I want this
terrorist found...</i>

204
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:04,158
<i>...and I want him to understand
what terror really means.</i>

205
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,785
<i>England prevails.</i>

206
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,538
England prevails.

207
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,006
- You think people will buy this?
- Why not?

208
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,091
This is the BTN.

209
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,052
Our job is to report the news,
not fabricate it.

210
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,680
That's the government's job.

211
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,933
On the lighter side of things...

212
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,603
...seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the Old Bailey...

213
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,857
...wanted to give the old girl a grand,
albeit improvised, sendoff.

214
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,902
<i>Although the demolition had been
planned for some time...</i>

215
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,156
<i>...the music and the fireworks were,
according to the crew chief...</i>

216
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,200
- <i>... "definitely not on the schedule."</i>
<i>- We'll be right back.</i>

217
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,204
Do you believe that load of bollocks?
I mean, there was no bloody demolition.

218
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,831
I saw it, the whole thing.

219
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,709
- Did you see it?
- No. Last night I was--

220
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,171
Yeah, that's right. You went
to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?

221
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,840
Evey, there you are.

222
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,176
- You are still working for me.
- Sorry, Patricia.

223
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,720
I need two espressos and three coffees.

224
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,889
And Deitrich is ready for his tea.

225
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,351
I don't get it.

226
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,563
Why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask?
Didn't Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?

227
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,734
It's not too late.
He's still got another 16 hours.

228
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,153
Maybe he's just getting started.

229
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,406
Yeah?

230
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,909
Okay. A lead on the girl.

231
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,995
Look, don't get me wrong,
I love it. A cow getting crucified.

232
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,332
It's hysterical.
But you'll never get it approved.

233
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,210
You've got to rewrite it, okay?
Gotta go.

234
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,922
I don't recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman.

235
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,882
- Mr. Deitrich--
- Gordon, please.

236
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,593
I don't need "mister" to make
this body feel any older.

237
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,428
Gordon...

238
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,515
...I was on my way last night,
but there were Fingermen...

239
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,266
...and I got scared and went home.

240
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:56,938
Sadly, after last night,
I think our curfew will only get worse.

241
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,790
Gotcha.

242
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,129
- Hey, Fred.
- All that been x-rayed?

243
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,131
Nope. They're filled with bombs.

244
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,591
Well, wait till commercials
to set them off, okay?

245
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,095
- I can't believe you watch that shit.
- What?

246
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,180
Laser Lass is banging.

247
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,070
What's all that?

248
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,323
Not sure. They just arrived.
Marked for Stage 3.

249
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,159
Must be Prothero.

250
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,705
I wish someone had the balls to tell that
brat this station ain't his playground.

251
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,333
What the hell is this?

252
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,214
Just put them over there
until I can figure out what they're for.

253
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:09,635
This looks serious.
Her parents were political activists.

254
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,972
- They were detained when she was 12.
- What happened to her?

255
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,349
Juvenile Reclamation Project...

256
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,018
- ...for five years.
- Shit.

257
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,353
We're gonna need backup,
but keep it minimal.

258
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,855
You sure about that, sir?

259
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,440
I want a chance to talk to her...

260
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,151
...before she disappears
into one of Creedy's black bags.

261
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,539
Who's that?

262
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:42,543
Don't piss me about. You show me ID,
or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.

263
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,884
Fucking hell.

264
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,430
Come on, let's move!

265
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,994
You two, cover these elevators.
The rest of you follow me.

266
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,705
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

267
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,794
<i>Will all personnel please
evacuate the building.</i>

268
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,796
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

269
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,924
<i>Will all personnel evacuate the building.</i>

270
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,223
What the hell's going on?

271
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,433
- It's jammed.
- Break it down.

272
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,607
Dominic!

273
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,026
Police! Out of the way!

274
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,321
Get out the way!

275
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,330
Damn it!

276
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,211
<i>I'll tell you what I know.
I'll tell you what I know.</i>

277
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,047
<i>I'll tell you what I know.
England prevails.</i>

278
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,844
- Clear the halls.
- Sir.

279
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,972
<i>Help, Storm, help!</i>

280
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,610
Don't touch it.

281
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,903
Dad, what's wrong with the telly?

282
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,630
<i>Good evening, London.</i>

283
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,091
- <i>Allow me first to apologize...</i>
- That's the emergency channel!

284
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,387
<i>I do, like many of you, appreciate
the comforts of the everyday routine...</i>

285
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:02,558
<i>...the security of the familiar,
the tranquility of repetition.</i>

286
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,851
Bloody hell.

287
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:07,521
<i>I enjoy them as much as any bloke.
But in the spirit of commemoration--</i>

288
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,731
- Who's that, Mum?
- Shh.

289
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,816
<i>--Whereby important events
of the past...</i>

290
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,860
<i>...usually associated
with someone's death...</i>

291
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,112
<i>...or the end of some awful,
bloody struggle...</i>

292
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,782
<i>...are celebrated with a nice holiday...</i>

293
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,493
<i>...I thought we could mark
this November the 5th...</i>

294
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,953
<i>...a day that is, sadly,
no longer remembered...</i>

295
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,708
<i>...by taking time out of our daily lives
to sit down and have a little chat.</i>

296
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,878
<i>There are, of course,
those who do not want us to speak.</i>

297
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,338
Let me think, let me think.

298
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,882
<i>Even now, orders are being shouted
into telephones...</i>

299
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,385
<i>...and men with guns
will soon be on their way.</i>

300
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,387
- It's Chancellor Sutler.
- Damn it!

301
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,891
<i>Why? Because while the truncheon
may be used in lieu of conversation...</i>

302
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,894
<i>...words will always
retain their power.</i>

303
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,522
<i>Words offer the means to meaning...</i>

304
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,900
<i>...and, for those who will listen,
the enunciation of truth.</i>

305
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,443
<i>And the truth is...</i>

306
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,030
<i>...there is something terribly wrong
with this country, isn't there?</i>

307
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,575
You designed it, wanted it foolproof.
You said every television in London!

308
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,371
<i>Cruelty and injustice,
intolerance and oppression.</i>

309
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,873
<i>And where once
you had the freedom to object...</i>

310
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,834
<i>...to think and speak as you saw fit...</i>

311
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,254
<i>...you now have censors and surveillance
coercing your conformity...</i>

312
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,257
- <i>...and soliciting submission.</i>
- Cameras. We need cameras.

313
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,093
<i>How did this happen?
Who's to blame?</i>

314
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,513
<i>Certainly there are those
who are more responsible than others.</i>

315
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,598
<i>And they will be held accountable.</i>

316
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,727
<i>But again, truth be told,
if you're looking for the guilty...</i>

317
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,604
<i>...you need only look into a mirror.</i>

318
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,940
<i>I know why you did it.</i>

319
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,775
<i>I know you were afraid.</i>

320
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:38,487
<i>Who wouldn't be?
War, terror, disease.</i>

321
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,365
<i>There were a myriad of problems
which conspired...</i>

322
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,910
<i>...to corrupt your reason
and rob you of your common sense.</i>

323
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,662
<i>Fear got the best of you.</i>

324
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:51,083
<i>And in your panic, you turned to
the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.</i>

325
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,794
<i>He promised you order,
he promised you peace...</i>

326
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,715
<i>...and all he demanded in return
was your silent, obedient consent.</i>

327
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:01,635
- Inspector, they're almost through.
- <i>Last night, I sought to end that silence.</i>

328
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,138
<i>Last night,
I destroyed the Old Bailey...</i>

329
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:07,641
<i>...to remind this country
of what it has forgotten.</i>

330
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:13,147
<i>More than 400 years ago, a great citizen
wished to imbed the 5th of November...</i>

331
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,815
<i>...forever in our memory.</i>

332
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,652
<i>His hope was to remind the world
that fairness, justice and freedom...</i>

333
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,821
<i>...are more than words.</i>

334
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,573
<i>They are perspectives.</i>

335
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,617
<i>So if you've seen nothing...</i>

336
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,537
<i>...if the crimes of this government
remain unknown to you...</i>

337
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,000
<i>...then I would suggest that you allow
the 5th of November to pass unmarked.</i>

338
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,295
<i>But if you see what I see...</i>

339
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:41,008
<i>...if you feel as I feel,
and if you would seek as I seek...</i>

340
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,094
<i>...then I ask you to stand beside me,
one year from tonight...</i>

341
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,430
<i>...outside the gates of Parliament.</i>

342
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,350
<i>And together, we shall give them
a 5th of November...</i>

343
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,686
<i>...that shall never, ever be forgot.</i>

344
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,028
Kerosene fog.
He's using our smoke machines.

345
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,696
Cover the exits.

346
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,658
No one gets out.
The rest of you, follow me.

347
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,287
Left.

348
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,872
You go right.

349
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,666
Spread out.

350
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,384
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!

351
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,221
Hold your fire!

352
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,396
He put masks on all of us.

353
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,814
Jesus.

354
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,482
- Don't shoot!
- Wait!

355
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,234
- Wait!
- Hold your fire!

356
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,570
Freeze! Nobody move!

357
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,989
If you're wearing a mask,
get down on your knees!

358
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,329
- Get their masks off.
- Please hurry!

359
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,041
There's a bomb in the control booth.

360
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,835
Oh, no.

361
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,256
- Get anyone not wearing a mask out.
- Yes, sir.

362
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,717
- Marshal, help carry this man.
- Sir.

363
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,427
Everyone else, let's go.

364
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,395
Good God.

365
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,939
Hurry up, you lot! Come on!
Everybody out!

366
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,783
Dascomb.

367
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,787
Have you any idea how long
it would take to rebuild this facility?

368
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,040
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

369
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,374
Wait, wait!

370
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,045
Don't shoot me, please!
It's him! It's him!

371
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,715
On your knees! On your knees!

372
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,301
Please! Please don't hurt me!

373
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,996
Here we go.

374
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,003
I did it.

375
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,630
I did it.

376
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,803
Freeze!

377
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,764
Get your hands on your head.
Do it now or I shoot.

378
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:40,229
I must say that I am rather astonished
by the response time of London's finest.

379
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,441
I hadn't expected you to be
quite so Johnny-on-the-spot.

380
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,194
We were here before you even started.
Bad luck, chummy.

381
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,737
Oh, I don't know about that.

382
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,991
Aah!

383
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:07,506
<i>We're interrupting your regular program
to bring you this terrifying report...</i>

384
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:11,301
<i>...of a terrorist takeover of Jordan Tower
which ended only moments ago.</i>

385
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,722
<i>A psychotic terrorist,
identified only as the letter V...</i>

386
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,851
<i>...attacked the control booth with
high-powered explosives and weapons...</i>

387
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:23,147
<i>...that he used against unarmed civilians
in order to broadcast a message of hate.</i>

388
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:27,901
<i>We've just received this footage
of a daring police raid.</i>

389
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,697
<i>Stop!
Stop, stay where you are, or we'll shoot!</i>

390
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,782
<i>Stay where you are!</i>

391
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,287
<i>Now, this is only an initial report...</i>

392
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,416
<i>...but at this time, it's believed
that during this heroic raid...</i>

393
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,418
<i>...the terrorist was shot and killed.</i>

394
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:45,794
Bollocks.

395
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,423
<i>Again, from what we've been told
by authorities, the danger is now over.</i>

396
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,300
<i>The terrorist is dead.</i>

397
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,098
Right there. What's he thinking?

398
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,809
Is he considering leaving her?

399
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,354
After she just saved him?

400
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,610
He's a terrorist. You can't expect him
to act like you or me.

401
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,820
Some part of him's human.

402
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,949
And, for better or worse,
she's stuck with him.

403
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:45,949
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

404
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,539
- You scared me.
- My apologies.

405
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,625
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, thank you.

406
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,211
- What is this place?
- It's my home.

407
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,882
- I call it the Shadow Gallery.
- It's beautiful.

408
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,968
- Where did you get all this stuff?
- Oh, here and there.

409
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,722
Much of it from the vaults of
the Ministry of Objectionable Materials.

410
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,849
- You stole them?
- Heavens, no.

411
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,893
Stealing implies ownership.

412
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,229
You can't steal from the censor.
I merely reclaimed them.

413
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,148
God, if they ever find this place...

414
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:15,277
I suspect if they do, a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries.

415
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,738
You mean, after what you've done.

416
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,574
God, what have I done?

417
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,868
I Maced that detective.
Why did I do that?

418
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,580
- You did what you thought was right.
- No, I shouldn't have done that.

419
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,707
I must have been out of my mind.

420
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,085
Is that what you really think,
or what they'd want you to think?

421
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,087
I think I should go.

422
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,340
- May I ask where?
- Home. I have to go home.

423
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,758
They're looking for you.

424
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,469
If they know where you work,
they know where you live.

425
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:45,432
- I have friends, I could stay with them.
- I'm afraid that won't work either.

426
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,769
You have to understand, Evey,
I didn't want this for either of us...

427
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,604
...but I couldn't see any other way.

428
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:53,023
You were unconscious
and I had to make a decision.

429
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,402
If I had left you there, right now you'd be
in one of Creedy's interrogation cells.

430
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,448
They'd imprison you, torture you,
and, in all probability, kill you...

431
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,617
...in the pursuit of finding me.

432
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:06,161
After what you did,
I couldn't let that happen...

433
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:10,332
...so I picked you up and carried you
to the only place I knew you'd be safe:

434
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,125
Here, to my home.

435
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:16,046
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
You know you can trust me.

436
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,632
I'm sorry, but I can't take that risk.

437
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,801
But I don't even know where this is.

438
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,971
You know it's underground.
You know the color of the stone.

439
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:28,183
- That'd be enough for a clever man.
- Are you saying that I have to stay here?

440
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,728
Only until I'm done. After the 5th,
I no longer think it'll matter.

441
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,855
You mean a year from now?

442
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,816
I have to stay here for a year?

443
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,986
Sorry, Evey.
I didn't know what else to do.

444
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,821
You should've left me alone.

445
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,323
Why didn't you just leave me alone?!

446
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,329
- Anything else on the parents?
- Yeah, it ain't good.

447
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,540
They were interned at Belmarsh.

448
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,417
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

449
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,045
She died in a hunger strike. He died
when the military retook the shed.

450
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:00,465
And that ain't the worst of it.
Her brother was at St. Mary's.

451
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,802
- Christ.
- It's nothing but bad luck here.

452
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,681
So we know her story.
Now we need his.

453
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,704
V?

454
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,290
Ah. <i>Bonjour,</i> mademoiselle.

455
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:36,918
I just wanted to apologize
for my reaction last night.

456
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:41,757
I understand what you did for me,
and I want you to know I am grateful.

457
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,301
Your hands.

458
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,262
Yes.

459
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,226
There, that's better.

460
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,479
I hope I didn't put you off
your appetite.

461
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:59,399
- No, please. It's just-- Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine.

462
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,026
Can I ask what happened?

463
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,072
There was a fire. A long time ago.

464
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,407
Ancient history, for some.

465
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,409
Not really very good
table conversation.

466
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,245
Now, would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg?

467
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,041
- Yes, thank you. I'm starving, actually.
- Have a seat.

468
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,632
Mmm.

469
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,760
- It's delicious.
- Good.

470
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:30,013
God, I haven't had real butter
since I was a little girl.

471
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,431
Where did you get it?

472
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,768
A government supply train
on its way to Chancellor Sutler.

473
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,647
- You stole this from Chancellor Sutler?
- Yes.

474
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,065
You're insane.

475
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:44,111
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares more is none.

476
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,696
- <i>Macbeth.</i>
- Very good.

477
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,783
My mum, she used to
read all his plays to me...

478
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,244
...and ever since,
I've always wanted to act.

479
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,788
Be in plays, movies.

480
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:58,542
When I was 9, I played Viola
in <i>Twelfth Night.</i> Mum was very proud.

481
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,794
Where is your mother now?

482
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,754
She's dead.

483
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,172
I'm sorry.

484
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,969
Can I ask about
what you said on the telly?

485
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,720
- Did you mean it?
- Every word.

486
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,850
You really think blowing up Parliament's
going to make this country a better place?

487
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,310
There's no certainty, only opportunity.

488
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,021
You can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up...

489
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,107
...Creedy'll black-bag
every one of them.

490
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,818
People should not be afraid
of their governments.

491
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,862
Governments should be afraid
of their people.

492
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,448
And you'll make that happen
by blowing up a building?

493
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,161
The building is a symbol,
as is the act of destroying it.

494
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,079
Symbols are given power by people.

495
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:40,000
Alone, a symbol is meaningless,
but with enough people...

496
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,836
...blowing up a building
can change the world.

497
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,797
I wish I believed that was possible.

498
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,510
Every time I've seen this world change,
it's always been for the worse.

499
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,138
<i>I'll tell you what I know.
I know this is not a man.</i>

500
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:55,891
What is he?

501
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,851
<i>A man does not wear a mask.</i>

502
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:01,271
- What is he?
- <i>A man does not threaten civilians.</i>

503
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,900
<i>He's what every gutless,
freedom-hating terrorist is:</i>

504
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,319
<i>A goddamn coward!</i>

505
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,823
There will be no negotiation.

506
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,493
When I arrive in the morning,
the Paddy will be gone.

507
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:18,163
I'm looking at the tape right now,
and he has no idea how to light me.

508
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,041
My nose looks like Big fucking Ben.

509
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,669
Listen to me, you bleeding sod,
England prevails because I say it does!

510
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,631
So does every lazy cunt on this show,
and that includes you.

511
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:31,051
Find another DOP
or find yourself another job.

512
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,138
<i>I'll tell you what I wish.</i>

513
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,265
<i>I wish I'd been there.</i>

514
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,559
<i>I wish I'd had the chance
for a face-to-face.</i>

515
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,520
<i>Just one chance, that's all I'd need.</i>

516
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,820
<i>This so-called V and his accomplice,
Evey Hammond...</i>

517
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,282
<i>...neo-demagogues,
spouting their message of hate.</i>

518
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:59,037
<i>A delusional and aberrant voice
delivering a terrorist's ultimatum.</i>

519
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,916
<i>An ultimatum that was met
with swift and surgically precise justice.</i>

520
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,877
- No mercy!
- <i>The moral, ladies and gentlemen, is:</i>

521
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,255
Good guys win, bad guys lose...

522
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,800
...and, as always, England prevails!

523
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,804
Holy Christ! Jesus!

524
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,015
Good evening, Commander Prothero.

525
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,768
Oh, my God! How did you get in here?

526
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,063
Don't worry, I've made sure
our reunion won't be disturbed by...

527
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,440
...any pesky late-night phone calls,
commander.

528
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,442
Stop. Why do you keep calling me that?

529
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:34,364
That was your title, remember?
When we first met, all those years ago.

530
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,324
You wore a uniform in those days.

531
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,037
You.

532
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,917
- It is you.
- The Ghost of Christmas Past.

533
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,887
- Yeah?
<i>- Finch, it's Dascomb.</i>

534
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,640
- Dascomb.
- <i>I've already called the chancellor.</i>

535
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,644
- <i>We have to get control of the situation.</i>
- What situation?

536
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:10,191
Chancellor Sutler agreed, for obvious
reasons, we have to keep this discreet.

537
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,944
In the wrong light,
the loss of the Voice of London...

538
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,155
...could be devastating
to our credibility.

539
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,116
Perhaps a stroke?

540
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,036
No, no, it's too horrific.

541
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,956
A quiet, dignified death in his sleep.

542
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,877
- We got any eyes or ears on this?
- No, camcos were cut.

543
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:33,548
It's the same m.o. as before.
But we got an elevator log ID.

544
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:37,093
- Let me guess.
- She's in deep, inspector.

545
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:39,929
V?

546
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,146
My fat, metal friend.

547
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,702
Mondego.

548
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,419
Oh, God. I hope I didn't wake you.

549
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,215
No, I just thought you were fighting.
I mean, for real.

550
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,716
My favorite film:

551
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:21,346
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo,</i>
with Robert Donat as Edmond Dantes.

552
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,724
<i>It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.</i>

553
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,519
It gets me every time.

554
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,729
- Never seen it.
- Really?

555
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,149
- Would you like to?
- Does it have a happy ending?

556
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,568
As only celluloid can deliver.

557
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,445
Okay.

558
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,572
Put the sword away.

559
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,033
Forensics just wrapped.

560
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,870
No prints, no hair, no fibers.
The guy is like a ghost.

561
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,872
You won't believe
what they found on Prothero.

562
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,083
- Drugs?
- Could've started his own hospital.

563
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,835
- Interesting.
- Why?

564
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:55,422
Did you know Lewis Prothero was
one of the richest men in the country...

565
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,340
...before he was
the Voice of London?

566
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,968
- Drugs?
- Legal ones.

567
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,929
Major stockholder
in Viadoxic Pharmaceutical.

568
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:07,308
Viadoxic and St. Mary's
in less than a week. Coincidence?

569
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:11,020
When you're at this as long as I've been,
you stop believing in coincidence.

570
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,523
<i>May we come up?</i>

571
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,235
<i>- You find your own tree.</i>
- You find your own tree.

572
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,743
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

573
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,747
- But it made me feel sorry for Mercedes.
- Why?

574
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,751
Because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her.

575
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,464
<i>--Nationwide were devastated
as news of the most popular--</i>

576
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,840
Wait. What's this?

577
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,718
<i>--Most awarded stars
in the history of the BTN...</i>

578
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,971
<i>...a man known to the entire nation
as "The Voice of London"...</i>

579
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:48,016
<i>...passed away late last night
from apparent heart failure.</i>

580
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,395
- She's lying.
- How do you know?

581
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,565
She blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false.

582
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,901
<i>It came as no surprise
to those who knew him...</i>

583
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,819
<i>...that his body was at his office...</i>

584
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,698
<i>...where he often worked long hours
after everyone else had gone home.</i>

585
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,409
<i>Lewis, you will be sorely missed.</i>

586
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:16,085
V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.

587
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,962
You didn't take it, did you?

588
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,174
Would you prefer a lie or the truth?

589
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:25,094
Did you have anything
to do with that?

590
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,181
- Yes, I killed him.
- You...

591
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,849
- Oh, God.
- You're upset.

592
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,477
I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.

593
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:36,022
I might have killed the Fingermen that
attacked you. I heard no objection.

594
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,691
- What?
- Violence can be used for good.

595
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,611
- What are you talking about?
- Justice.

596
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:48,076
Oh, I see.

597
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:51,079
There's no court in this country
for men like Prothero.

598
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,582
And are you going to kill more people?

599
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,335
Yes.

600
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,796
Take a look at this.

601
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,423
Prothero's military record.

602
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,759
What do you see?

603
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:11,891
Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria,
before and after, Sudan.

604
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,685
- Busy boy.
- But after all that...

605
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:17,522
...they put him in charge
of a detention facility at Larkhill.

606
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,483
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

607
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,612
You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?

608
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,658
It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.

609
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:33,162
Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.

610
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:38,668
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.

611
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:42,213
- You're welcome to review our records.
- We've been through your records.

612
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,925
All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill...

613
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,595
...approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.

614
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,929
Well, there you have it.

615
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,434
This is a matter
of some urgency, major.

616
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,770
We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.

617
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,273
I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.

618
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,192
Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?

619
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,446
- Usual undesirables, I should think.
- But do you know?

620
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,532
- Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
- Do you know who was?

621
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,911
I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records--

622
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,624
Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.

623
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,709
As head of the Detention Program
at that--

624
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:23,755
Before you go further, let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then.

625
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,633
Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.

626
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,385
We all did what we had to do.

627
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,805
And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.

628
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,807
That's all I have to say about that.

629
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,899
You can do this.

630
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,494
Hi.

631
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,705
I've been thinking...

632
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,000
There's something
I want to ask you...

633
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:05,004
...but I don't think you'll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.

634
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,760
My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.

635
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,097
He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth...

636
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,683
...while politicians used them
to cover the truth up.

637
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,018
A man after my own heart.

638
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,854
He always told the best stories.

639
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,358
Until my brother died.

640
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,654
That was when everything changed.

641
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,992
<i>My brother was one of the students
at St. Mary's.</i>

642
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,996
<i>After he died,
my parents became political.</i>

643
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,543
<i>They protested the war
and the Reclamation.</i>

644
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,004
<i>When Sutler was appointed
high chancellor...</i>

645
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,381
<i>...they were at the riot in Leeds.</i>

646
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,550
<i>I watched on the television...</i>

647
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,136
<i>...thinking I was going
to see my parents killed.</i>

648
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,180
<i>I remember them arguing at night.</i>

649
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,684
<i>Mum wanted to leave the country.
Dad refused.</i>

650
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,895
<i>He said if we ran away,
they would win.</i>

651
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,856
<i>Win, like...</i>

652
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,190
<i>...it was a game.</i>

653
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,361
Evey, quick, hide!

654
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,253
- Mummy!
- Evey!

655
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,838
<i>I never saw them again.</i>

656
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,176
It was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth.

657
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,094
I'm sorry, Evey.

658
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,889
No, I'm the one that's sorry.

659
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,349
Sorry I'm not a stronger person.

660
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,519
Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...

661
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,397
...but I'm not.

662
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,318
I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...

663
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,404
...but I am.

664
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,116
I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.

665
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:02,121
Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right...

666
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,249
...please let me know.

667
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,085
If you wish.

668
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,303
Do you really think
you'll find something here?

669
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,971
Worth a shot.

670
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,933
One thing is true of all governments:

671
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,895
The most reliable records
are tax records.

672
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,696
It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.

673
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,784
Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.

674
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,955
But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.

675
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,374
Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.

676
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,001
Thanks. This is a great help.

677
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,975
"By the power of truth, I, while living,
have conquered the universe."

678
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:07,270
- Personal motto?
- From <i>Faust.</i>

679
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,856
That's about trying
to cheat the devil, isn't it?

680
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,191
It is. And speaking of the devil...

681
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,153
...I was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing.

682
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,655
- Of course.
- It appears unforeseen circumstances...

683
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,616
...have accelerated my original plan.

684
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,537
As a result, I'm in need of someone
with some theatrical skill.

685
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:25,955
I'll do my best.

686
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,207
I believe you will.

687
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:36,716
Another doctor. Why does a
detention facility need so many doctors?

688
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,759
I don't know, but this is interesting.

689
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:42,388
The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.

690
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:45,683
- Really?
- Yeah, Father Lilliman.

691
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:49,687
- Lilliman.
- Was paid almost 200 grand a month.

692
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,064
Now, that is interesting.

693
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:56,652
Looks like he was promoted.
He's a bishop now.

694
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,033
- Your Grace.
- Oh, Denis.

695
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,910
- Has everything been arranged?
- Yes.

696
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,204
I've just received
your interlink itinerary.

697
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,248
You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.

698
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,917
You're most diligent, Denis...

699
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:15,046
...a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our Lord, but--

700
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,757
- Your Grace?
- It wasn't labor I was speaking of.

701
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,968
It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.

702
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,387
My last little joy.

703
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,306
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

704
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,810
She has arrived, but there was
some confusion at the agency.

705
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,231
They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.

706
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,774
Older?

707
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,109
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?

708
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,528
That is for Your Grace to decide.

709
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,293
- Oh, my.
- Your Grace.

710
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,925
To think that I doubted your loveliness
for an instant.

711
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,513
Mea culpa, my child.

712
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,014
Mea culpa.

713
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,982
Your Grace, we don't have much time
and I have to tell you something.

714
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:20,194
A confession?
I love the confessional game.

715
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,280
Tell me your sins.

716
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,282
This isn't a game, Your Grace.

717
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,742
Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.

718
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,661
- I'm sorry?
- I'm telling you this...

719
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,414
...because I want some kind
of protection or amnesty.

720
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,251
I had nothing to do with the Bailey
and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.

721
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:38,504
- I think this should balance it out.
- What are you talking about?

722
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,548
I'm Evey Hammond. I'm--

723
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:43,926
I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V
for the past several weeks.

724
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:47,388
I'm telling you that any moment,
he's going to come through that door.

725
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,933
I unlocked the window in the room
where Denis told me to get ready.

726
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,394
Wonderful!

727
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,855
It's a game I've never played!

728
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,982
What a delightful mind you have.

729
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,026
I hope the rest of you
is just as interesting.

730
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,446
- No, please, you have to believe me.
- Oh, I do, I do, I do.

731
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,698
Let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs.

732
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,325
Stop it! Get off of me!

733
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,618
Seems I've captured
a dangerous terrorist.

734
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,871
Now, how best to procure
her confession?

735
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:13,581
Oh!

736
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,959
You little bitch.
You fucking little whore!

737
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,505
- Reverend.
- Oh, my God.

738
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,382
She wasn't lying. It is you.

739
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,551
I'm sorry.

740
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:27,428
- I had to.
- Evey!

741
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,352
And thus I clothe my naked villainy...

742
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,563
...with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ...

743
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,858
...and seem a saint,
when most I play the devil.

744
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,985
Oh, please, have mercy.

745
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,071
Oh, not tonight, Bishop.

746
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,947
<i>Not tonight.</i>

747
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:51,077
<i>Don't do this, I beg of you.</i>

748
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,412
Well, then.
Children's hour at the abbey.

749
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:55,581
<i>Open your mouth
and stick out your tongue.</i>

750
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:59,126
- What the--?
<i>- I don't want to die!</i>

751
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,463
This is Surveillance 109.
We have an emergency.

752
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:08,969
Run every name in that file.
I want the whereabouts of all of them.

753
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,805
- Tonight.
- Yes, sir.

754
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,557
Pucker up, here comes the Finger.

755
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,019
Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.

756
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,150
Creedy.

757
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,693
What are you doing here?

758
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:29,740
Several prominent party members
have been murdered, chief inspector.

759
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:34,120
This is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention.

760
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:37,123
The chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement.

761
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,292
It'll be hard to investigate
if you're detaining all my witnesses.

762
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,671
The security of information
is paramount.

763
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,673
In these volatile times...

764
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,676
...mistakes like Jordan Tower
can no longer be tolerated...

765
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,220
...if, indeed,
Jordan Tower was an accident.

766
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,639
- What does that mean?
- Terrorist seems to have...

767
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:56,434
...a rather intimate understanding
of our system.

768
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,395
The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.

769
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:02,106
Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?

770
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,024
At this time, it would behoove you...

771
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:09,196
...to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed...

772
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,783
...and concentrate on the concerns
of our present.

773
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,743
You mean Larkhill?

774
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,497
Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.

775
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,917
- His loyalty is not in question.
- But mine is?

776
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:26,005
Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?

777
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,842
Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?

778
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,679
I've been a party member for 27 years.

779
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:36,182
If I were you, chief inspector...

780
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,517
...I'd find the terrorist...

781
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,603
...and I'd find him soon.

782
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,524
Please.

783
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,822
Evey? Good God!

784
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,533
I'm sorry.
I didn't know where else to go.

785
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:59,497
Yes, well, you better come inside
before someone sees you.

786
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,633
- Cheers.
- I know every cop's looking for me.

787
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:13,469
I know it's horrible of me
to put you in this situation.

788
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:16,055
- Evey--
- You could be in terrible trouble.

789
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,723
Evey, listen to me.

790
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,769
If the government searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.

791
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,566
You trusted me.

792
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,819
It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.

793
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,585
Oh, my God.
That's <i>God Save the Queen.</i>

794
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,463
My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.

795
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:53,717
- I thought Sutler had it destroyed.
- He believes he did.

796
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,679
Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel...

797
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,681
...it always cheers me up.

798
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:04,853
- What is that?
- It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.

799
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,189
- Are you a Muslim?
- No, I'm in television.

800
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:09,400
But why would you keep it?

801
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,778
I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful, poetry moving.

802
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,947
Is it worth it?
If they found that here...

803
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:17,408
I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.

804
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,994
Thank you, Gordon.

805
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,288
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.

806
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:25,958
This whole thing started the night
he blew up the Old Bailey.

807
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,294
I was on my way here, and...

808
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,962
Ah.

809
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:31,589
Yes.

810
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,344
You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.

811
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,638
- But--
- You're wondering why...

812
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,349
...you were invited here to supper
in the first place...

813
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:46,604
...if my appetites were
for less conventional fare.

814
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,316
Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain...

815
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,110
...young and attractive ladies
like yourself.

816
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,072
Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired...

817
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,201
...I would undoubtedly find myself
without a home, let alone a TV show.

818
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,371
- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.

819
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,541
The truth is, after so many years...

820
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:11,170
...you begin to lose
more than just your appetite.

821
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:15,341
You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.

822
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:21,180
I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.

823
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,391
You could get these poisons
from any house in London.

824
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,102
Thanks, Delia.

825
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:31,273
Any leads on finding this guy?

826
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,777
Nothing yet. But there's something else
you can help me with.

827
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:40,574
You started as a botanist, didn't you?

828
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,453
It's-- It's a Scarlet Carson.

829
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,290
They're believed to be extinct.

830
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,418
He leaves them at the crime scenes.

831
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:54,254
I'd appreciate it
if you could have a look at it.

832
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:57,007
Any information could be helpful.

833
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,343
Of course.

834
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,137
Excuse me.

835
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,098
Yeah?

836
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,142
<i>I just finished
going through the file, inspector.</i>

837
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,560
<i>You better get back here.</i>

838
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,187
Yeah, okay.

839
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:15,067
- My God. He's killed them all.
- All but one.

840
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,696
- Who is she?
- Not sure.

841
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,407
She's clearly one of the people
in charge at Larkhill.

842
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:25,077
But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.

843
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:27,871
Till she applied for an overseas visa,
which was denied.

844
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,915
Running away?

845
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:34,253
Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.

846
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,797
- She changed her name.
- That's what I'm guessing.

847
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:40,050
I put a call in to the registry,
but I haven't heard back.

848
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,554
- It's late, or early.
- Call them again. I want that name.

849
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,317
What? Are you sure about that?

850
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,236
Okay. Thank you.

851
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,615
Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name
to Delia Surridge.

852
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,034
- The coroner?
- Yeah.

853
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,287
Jesus, I just saw her.

854
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,173
It's you, isn't it?

855
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,926
- You've come to kill me.
- Yes.

856
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,305
Thank God.

857
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,018
<i>I'm sorry,
I can't get a response from that number.</i>

858
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:33,020
<i>There's a problem
with the connection.</i>

859
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,022
Jesus Christ.

860
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,024
He's there.

861
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:41,445
After what happened,
after what they did...

862
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,947
...I thought about killing myself.

863
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:49,328
But I knew that one day
you'd come for me.

864
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,831
I didn't know what
they were going to do.

865
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,209
I swear to you.

866
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,002
Read my journal.

867
00:54:57,169 --> 00:55:00,422
What they did was only possible
because of you.

868
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,886
Oppenheimer was able to change
more than the course of a war.

869
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,889
He changed the entire course
of human history.

870
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,726
Is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope?

871
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:16,063
I have not come
for what you hoped to do.

872
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,106
I've come for what you did.

873
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,901
It's funny.

874
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,904
I was given one of your roses today.

875
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,367
I wasn't sure you were the terrorist
until I saw it.

876
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:34,206
What a strange coincidence,
that I should be given one today.

877
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,876
There are no coincidences, Delia.

878
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:41,046
Only the illusion of coincidence.

879
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:43,215
I have another rose.

880
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,718
And this one is for you.

881
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:56,228
- You're going to kill me now?
- I killed you 10 minutes ago...

882
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,814
...while you slept.

883
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:02,609
- Is there any pain?
- No.

884
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,194
Thank you.

885
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,741
Is it meaningless to apologize?

886
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,243
Never.

887
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,413
I'm so sorry.

888
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,769
Damn it.

889
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:43,108
The terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it.

890
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:46,862
He wanted us to know the story,
or at least a part of it.

891
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:50,073
<i>Am I to understand that you have read
this document, inspector?</i>

892
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,326
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Has anyone else read it?</i>

893
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:55,370
- No, sir.
- <i>Then let me make this perfectly clear.</i>

894
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:59,041
<i>The contents of this document
are a matter of national security...</i>

895
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:03,086
<i>...constituting an assault on the character
of several important party members...</i>

896
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:06,715
<i>...as well as a blatant violation
of the Articles of Allegiance.</i>

897
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:09,801
<i>As the authenticity of this document
cannot be verified...</i>

898
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:13,805
<i>...it could be an elaborate forgery
created by the terrorist...</i>

899
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:17,643
<i>...as easily as it could be the deranged
fantasy of a former party member...</i>

900
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,978
<i>...who resigned
for psychological reasons.</i>

901
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:23,065
<i>Any discussion of this document
or its contents...</i>

902
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,151
<i>...will be regarded, at the very least,
as an act of sedition...</i>

903
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:28,820
<i>...if not a willful act of treason.</i>

904
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:32,324
- <i>Is that understood, Mr. Finch?</i>
- Yes, sir.

905
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:35,160
<i>You would do well, inspector...</i>

906
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,746
<i>...to put it out of your mind.</i>

907
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,715
<i>May 23rd.</i>

908
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,886
<i>My first batch of subjects
arrived today...</i>

909
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:56,807
<i>...and I have to admit
that I'm very excited.</i>

910
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:02,771
<i>This could be the dawn of a new age.</i>

911
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,691
<i>Nuclear power is meaningless...</i>

912
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,860
<i>...in a world where a virus
can kill an entire population...</i>

913
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,071
<i>...and leave its wealth intact.</i>

914
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:14,366
- Stay together!
- Come on, move!

915
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,868
<i>May 27th.</i>

916
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:20,163
<i>Commander Prothero toured the lab
with a priest, Father Lilliman...</i>

917
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:24,167
<i>...who I was told is here to monitor
for Rules and Rights violations.</i>

918
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:28,588
<i>It made me nervous, but the commander
assured me there wouldn't be a problem.</i>

919
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:30,632
<i>June 2nd.</i>

920
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:35,012
<i>I keep wondering if these people knew
how they might be helping their country...</i>

921
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,514
<i>...if they would act any differently.</i>

922
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:41,601
<i>They're so weak and pathetic.
They never look you in the eye.</i>

923
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,271
<i>I find myself hating them.</i>

924
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,276
<i>August the 18th.</i>

925
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:53,280
<i>Of the original four dozen,
over 75 percent are now deceased.</i>

926
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,994
<i>No controllable pattern
has yet emerged.</i>

927
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,497
<i>September the 18th.</i>

928
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,751
<i>There is one case that continues
to give me hope.</i>

929
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:10,589
<i>He exhibits none of the immune-system
pathologies the other subjects developed.</i>

930
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:15,260
<i>I've discovered cellular anomalies in his
blood that I've been unable to categorize.</i>

931
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:17,262
<i>The mutations seem
to have triggered...</i>

932
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:21,391
<i>...the abnormal development
of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.</i>

933
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,727
<i>The subject said
he could no longer remember...</i>

934
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:26,605
<i>...who he was or where he was from.</i>

935
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:30,567
<i>Whoever he was,
he is now the key to our dream...</i>

936
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:34,321
<i>...and the hope that all of this
will not have been in vain.</i>

937
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,032
<i>November the 5th.</i>

938
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:42,662
<i>It started last night, around midnight.</i>

939
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:46,708
<i>The first explosions tore open
the entire medical section.</i>

940
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,712
<i>All my work, gone.</i>

941
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:54,925
<i>I was trying to understand how
it could've happened when I saw him.</i>

942
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:57,302
<i>The man from room 5.</i>

943
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:58,720
<i>He looked at me.</i>

944
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:02,307
<i>Not with eyes. There were no eyes.</i>

945
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:05,018
<i>But I know he was looking at me
because I felt it.</i>

946
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,611
<i>Oh, God...</i>

947
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,488
<i>...what have I done?</i>

948
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,145
<i>Bonjour,</i> mademoiselle.

949
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,063
What is that you're making?

950
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,774
We called it "eggie in the basket."
My mum made them.

951
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,776
- This is weird.
- What?

952
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:58,405
The first morning I was with him,
he made me eggs just like this.

953
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,866
- Really?
- I swear.

954
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:05,829
That is a strange coincidence.
Although there's an obvious explanation.

955
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,914
- There is?
- Yes, Evey.

956
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,916
I am V.

957
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,543
At last you know the truth.

958
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,420
You're stunned, I know.

959
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:17,215
Hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath
this wrinkled, well-fed exterior...

960
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:22,596
...there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.

961
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,347
<i>Viva la revolución.</i>

962
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:25,891
That is not funny, Gordon.

963
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,727
Yeah, I know.
I'm useless without a studio audience.

964
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,479
I've seen people go to jail
for less than that.

965
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,565
Of course, he was right, wasn't he?

966
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,068
There is something wrong
with this country.

967
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:54,669
Morning, inspector.

968
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:58,173
You're at it early.

969
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:03,470
Is something wrong?
You don't look so good, sir.

970
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,189
I wanna ask a question, Dominic.

971
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,984
I don't care if you answer me or not.

972
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:21,112
I just wanna say this aloud.

973
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:26,117
But I need to know that this question
will not leave this office.

974
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:28,620
Yeah, of course, inspector, but--

975
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,122
Because of the terrorist?

976
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,917
No.

977
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:38,171
So, what is it, chief?
What's going on?

978
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,511
The question I want to ask
is about St. Mary's...

979
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:46,763
...and Three Waters.

980
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:53,311
The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours...

981
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,314
...the question I have to ask, is:

982
01:02:57,816 --> 01:03:00,694
What if the worst...

983
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:04,990
...the most horrifying biological attack
in this country's history...

984
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:08,910
...was not the work
of religious extremists?

985
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:12,747
I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.

986
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,041
And they were executed. I know.

987
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,211
And maybe that's
really what happened.

988
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:23,174
But I see this chain of events...

989
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:28,096
...these coincidences,
and I have to ask:

990
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:29,848
What if that isn't what happened?

991
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,976
What if someone else
unleashed that virus?

992
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:37,188
What if someone else
killed all those people?

993
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,691
Would you really wanna know
who it was?

994
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:42,110
Sure.

995
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:44,612
Even if it was someone
working for this government?

996
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,116
That's my question.

997
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:51,369
If our own government
was responsible...

998
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:55,832
...for what happened at St. Mary's
and Three Waters...

999
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,086
...if our own government
was responsible...

1000
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:04,382
...for the deaths
of almost 100,000 people...

1001
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,803
...would you really wanna know?

1002
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:11,431
<i>This has to be the bloody
coldest March in years.</i>

1003
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:14,100
<i>Keep talking like that,
we'll lose our party status.</i>

1004
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,186
<i>They're a pack of lying hypocrites!</i>

1005
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:17,896
<i>Keep it down, will you?</i>

1006
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:25,070
Based on random audio sweeps,
I've projected that right now...

1007
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:28,448
...80 percent of the public
believe the terrorist is still alive.

1008
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,409
We're also showing
a 12-percent increase...

1009
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:35,038
...over last month's positive mention
in all four quadrants.

1010
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:38,708
<i>- Mr. Creedy?</i>
- We're handling it as best we can.

1011
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,503
Arrests are as high as they've been
since the Reclamation.

1012
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:44,172
<i>I want more than arrests.
I want results.</i>

1013
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:50,595
- What's all this about?
- I'm celebrating.

1014
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:52,889
Celebrating what?

1015
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:56,142
I think this could be
the best show we've ever done.

1016
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,104
<i>Very good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1017
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,524
<i>Listen, we've got an extraordinary
show for you tonight.</i>

1018
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:06,111
<i>You're not gonna believe it.
As a matter of fact, I don't think I do.</i>

1019
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:08,780
<i>Will you please give
a very warm welcome...</i>

1020
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:12,325
<i>...to our own Chancellor Adam Sutler!</i>

1021
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,415
- No way!
- No, it can't be!

1022
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:23,795
We threw out the censor-approved script
and shot one I wrote this morning.

1023
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,547
Oh, my God.

1024
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,811
<i>Chancellor, chancellor, chancellor...</i>

1025
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:42,814
<i>...I understand you've been under
tremendous strain lately...</i>

1026
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:46,151
<i>...since the beginning
of this whole terrorism business...</i>

1027
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:50,405
<i>...and we thought it would be a nice idea
to try and help you relax. Girls?</i>

1028
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:59,831
<i>Ah! Warm milk.
There's nothing better.</i>

1029
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:03,042
<i>I understand you enjoy a glass
every night, chancellor.</i>

1030
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,003
<i>Since I was a boy.</i>

1031
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,672
<i>But you're wrong, Mr. Deitrich.</i>

1032
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:11,634
- <i>The terrorist was never a concern.</i>
<i>- Oh, really?</i>

1033
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,012
- <i>Chancellor, chancellor</i>--
- It's him.

1034
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,432
<i>Are you saying that he's not still alive
and active?</i>

1035
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,268
<i>The terrorist has been neutralized.</i>

1036
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,647
<i>Oh, my God! Chancellor, look!</i>

1037
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,441
<i>The terrorist!</i>

1038
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:28,526
<i>The terrorist!</i>

1039
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:31,988
<i>Get him!</i>

1040
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,242
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

1041
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:57,305
<i>At last!</i>

1042
01:06:57,472 --> 01:07:01,392
<i>And now, for all the world to see.</i>

1043
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,811
It's him!

1044
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:08,983
<i>Unhand me! I am your chancellor!</i>

1045
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,862
<i>How dare you! I am the chancellor!</i>

1046
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,073
<i>Imposter!</i>

1047
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,748
<i>Soldiers! That man is the terrorist!</i>

1048
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:26,834
<i>-I order you to shoot that traitor!
- Liar!</i>

1049
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,044
<i>-Faker!
- Fraud!</i>

1050
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,088
<i>-Ready!
- Aim!</i>

1051
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,714
<i>-Fire!
- Fire!</i>

1052
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,603
What are they gonna do, fine us?

1053
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:49,232
Big deal. We've got
the most-watched show on air.

1054
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,901
Well, you're my agent,
that's what I pay you for.

1055
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,945
Protect me.

1056
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:55,947
I should've hired him
to be my mother.

1057
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:58,866
- You're mad.
- Either that or I wasn't breast-fed.

1058
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:02,036
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Only the things that matter.

1059
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:05,456
- What if they come after you?
- I tell you what's gonna happen.

1060
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:08,793
I'll have to make some kind of apology,
do some boring fundraiser.

1061
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,965
In the meantime, our ratings will go
through the roof. It'll be fine. Trust me.

1062
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:22,640
Gordon?

1063
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,894
Quick, Evey, hide!

1064
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:45,204
Not so funny now, is it, funnyman?

1065
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,215
- Gotcha.
- No, no.

1066
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,815
Do you know why you're here,
Evey Hammond?

1067
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:56,317
Please.

1068
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:58,945
You've been charged
with three counts of murder...

1069
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:02,907
...the bombing of government property,
conspiracy to commit terrorism...

1070
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:07,995
...treason and sedition, the penalty
for which is death by firing squad.

1071
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:14,585
You have one chance,
and only one chance, to save your life.

1072
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:18,756
You must tell us the identity
or whereabouts...

1073
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,758
...of code name V.

1074
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,095
If your information leads
to his capture...

1075
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:28,057
...you will be released
from this facility immediately.

1076
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,810
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

1077
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:34,105
You can return to your life,
Miss Hammond.

1078
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:38,609
All you have to do is cooperate.

1079
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,615
Process her.

1080
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:53,661
<i>I know there's
no way I can convince you...</i>

1081
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:56,622
<i>...this is not one of their tricks,
but I don't care.</i>

1082
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:58,583
<i>I am me.</i>

1083
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:00,501
<i>My name is Valerie.</i>

1084
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:05,715
<i>I don't think I'll live much longer.
I wanted to tell someone about my life.</i>

1085
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:10,261
<i>This is the only autobiography
that I will ever write and, God...</i>

1086
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:13,180
<i>...I'm writing it on toilet paper.</i>

1087
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,853
<i>I was born in Nottingham in 1985.</i>

1088
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,397
<i>I don't remember much
of those early years...</i>

1089
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:23,816
<i>...but I do remember the rain.</i>

1090
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,444
<i>My grandmother owned a farm
in Tottle Brook...</i>

1091
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,488
<i>...and she used to tell me
that God was in the rain.</i>

1092
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,450
<i>I passed my 11 Plus
and went to girls' grammar.</i>

1093
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,328
<i>It was at school
that I met my first girlfriend.</i>

1094
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:37,163
<i>Her name was Sarah.</i>

1095
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,290
<i>It was her wrists.</i>

1096
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:41,167
<i>They were beautiful.</i>

1097
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,047
<i>I thought we would
love each other forever.</i>

1098
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,925
<i>I remember our teacher telling us...</i>

1099
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,802
<i>...that it was an adolescent phase
that people outgrew.</i>

1100
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:53,512
<i>Sarah did.</i>

1101
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:56,891
<i>I didn't.</i>

1102
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:01,228
<i>In 2002, I fell in love
with a girl named Christina.</i>

1103
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:02,897
<i>That year I came out to my parents.</i>

1104
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:07,443
<i>I couldn't have done it
without Chris holding my hand.</i>

1105
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:11,489
<i>My father wouldn't look at me.
He told me to go and never come back.</i>

1106
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,617
<i>My mother said nothing.</i>

1107
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:19,497
<i>But I'd only told them the truth.
Was that so selfish?</i>

1108
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:24,502
<i>Our integrity sells for so little,
but it is all we really have.</i>

1109
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,837
<i>It is the very last inch of us.</i>

1110
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,548
<i>But within that inch...</i>

1111
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:30,967
<i>...we are free.</i>

1112
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:35,304
It ends whenever you want it to.

1113
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,057
- Just tell us where he is.
- I don't know.

1114
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,138
<i>I'd always known
what I wanted to do with my life...</i>

1115
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:22,518
<i>...and in 2015 I starred in my first film,</i>
The Salt Flats.

1116
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:27,481
<i>It was the most important role of my life.
Not because of my career...</i>

1117
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,650
<i>...but because that
was how I met Ruth.</i>

1118
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:33,571
<i>The first time we kissed...</i>

1119
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:38,534
<i>...I knew I never wanted to kiss
any other lips but hers again.</i>

1120
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,793
<i>We moved to a small flat
in London together.</i>

1121
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,504
<i>She grew Scarlet Carsons for me
in our window box...</i>

1122
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:54,300
<i>...and our place always smelt of roses.</i>

1123
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,804
<i>Those were the best years of my life.</i>

1124
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:04,894
<i>But America's war
grew worse and worse...</i>

1125
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,896
<i>...and eventually came to London.</i>

1126
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:10,191
The bill proposed by the Undersecretary
for Defense, Adam Sutler...

1127
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:13,277
...to close the remaining tube stations
passed with...

1128
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:16,322
<i>After that, there were no roses anymore.</i>

1129
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:18,199
<i>Not for anyone.</i>

1130
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:20,451
You won't last much longer.

1131
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,286
You're gonna die here.

1132
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:25,539
Why protect someone
who doesn't give a shit about you?

1133
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:39,762
<i>I remember how the meaning
of words began to change.</i>

1134
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:46,477
<i>How unfamiliar words like "collateral"
and "rendition" became frightening...</i>

1135
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:51,899
<i>...while things like "Norsefire" and the
"Articles of Allegiance" became powerful.</i>

1136
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:55,820
<i>I remember how "different"
became dangerous.</i>

1137
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:58,489
<i>I still don't understand it...</i>

1138
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:00,741
<i>...why they hate us so much.</i>

1139
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,166
<i>They took Ruth
while she was out buying food.</i>

1140
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:14,505
<i>I've never cried so hard in my life.</i>

1141
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,259
<i>It wasn't long till they came for me.</i>

1142
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:30,104
<i>It seems strange that my life should end
in such a terrible place.</i>

1143
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:35,693
<i>But for three years,
I had roses and apologized to no one.</i>

1144
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:40,114
<i>I shall die here.</i>

1145
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:43,826
<i>Every inch of me shall perish.</i>

1146
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,703
<i>Every inch...</i>

1147
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:47,538
<i>...but one.</i>

1148
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,419
<i>An inch.</i>

1149
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:56,714
<i>It is small, and it is fragile...</i>

1150
01:17:56,922 --> 01:18:00,551
<i>...and it is the only thing
in the world worth having.</i>

1151
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:05,848
<i>We must never lose it or give it away.
We must never let them take it from us.</i>

1152
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:10,978
<i>I hope that, whoever you are,
you escape this place.</i>

1153
01:18:11,145 --> 01:18:14,356
<i>I hope that the world turns
and that things get better.</i>

1154
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:19,445
<i>But what I hope most of all
is that you understand what I mean...</i>

1155
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:22,823
<i>...when I tell you that
even though I do not know you...</i>

1156
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:25,743
<i>...and even though
I may never meet you...</i>

1157
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:29,163
<i>...laugh with you, cry with you...</i>

1158
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,248
<i>...or kiss you...</i>

1159
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,542
<i>...I love you.</i>

1160
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:36,253
<i>With all my heart...</i>

1161
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:38,464
<i>...I love you.</i>

1162
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,508
<i>Valerie.</i>

1163
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,773
I'm instructed to inform you...

1164
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:58,943
...that you have been convicted
by special tribunal...

1165
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:02,071
...and that unless you are ready
to offer your cooperation...

1166
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,114
...you are to be executed.

1167
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:08,035
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

1168
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,872
- Yes.
- Are you ready to cooperate?

1169
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:18,003
- No.
- Very well.

1170
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:22,800
Escort Miss Hammond
back to her cell.

1171
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:25,427
Arrange a detail of six men...

1172
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,555
...and take her out behind
the chemical shed and shoot her.

1173
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,823
It's time.

1174
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:48,909
I'm ready.

1175
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:53,330
Look, all they want
is one little piece of information.

1176
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,791
Just give them something, anything.

1177
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,168
Thank you...

1178
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:01,338
...but I'd rather die
behind the chemical sheds.

1179
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:05,801
Then you have no fear anymore.
You're completely free.

1180
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,142
What?

1181
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:38,894
Hello, Evey.

1182
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,730
You.

1183
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,735
- It was you?
- Yeah.

1184
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:48,821
That wasn't real?

1185
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:55,285
- Is Gordon--?
- I'm sorry, but Mr. Deitrich's dead.

1186
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:56,870
I thought they'd arrest him...

1187
01:21:57,037 --> 01:22:00,290
...but when they found a Koran
in his house, they had him executed.

1188
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,459
Oh, God.

1189
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:06,713
- Fortunately, I got to you before they did.
- You got to me?

1190
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:10,300
You did this to me?

1191
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:13,303
You cut my hair?

1192
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:16,265
You tortured me?

1193
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:18,934
You tortured me.

1194
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:21,687
Why?

1195
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:27,317
You said you wanted to live without
fear. I wish there'd been an easier way...

1196
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,528
- ...but there wasn't.
- Oh, my God.

1197
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:31,613
I know you may never forgive me...

1198
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,825
...but nor will you understand
how hard it was for me.

1199
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:38,078
Every day, I saw in myself
everything you see in me now.

1200
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:40,664
Every day, I wanted to end it.

1201
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:44,418
But each time you refused to give in,
I knew I couldn't.

1202
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:47,337
You're sick! You're evil!

1203
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,966
You could have ended it.
You could have given in, but you didn't.

1204
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:54,094
- Why?
- Leave me alone! I hate you!

1205
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:57,848
That's it! See, at first,
I thought it was hate too.

1206
01:22:58,015 --> 01:23:00,559
Hate was all I knew.
It built my world, imprisoned me...

1207
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:03,228
...taught me how to eat,
how to drink, how to breathe.

1208
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:06,982
I thought I'd die
with all the hate in my veins.

1209
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:09,067
But then something happened.

1210
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,653
It happened to me
just as it happened to you.

1211
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,698
Shut up! I don't want to hear
your lies!

1212
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:18,619
Your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth.

1213
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:20,537
Yes, I created a lie.

1214
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:24,333
But because you believed it,
you found something true about yourself.

1215
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,878
- No.
- What was true in that cell is true now.

1216
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:31,131
What you felt in there
has nothing to do with me.

1217
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:33,884
I can't feel anything anymore!

1218
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:37,221
Don't run from it, Evey.
You've been running all your life.

1219
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,766
I can't... Can't breathe.

1220
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:45,646
Asthma. When I was little--

1221
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:49,316
Listen to me, Evey.

1222
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:53,070
This may be the most important moment
of your life. Commit to it.

1223
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:58,700
They took your parents from you.
They took your brother from you.

1224
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,496
They put you in a cell
and took everything they could take...

1225
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,748
...except your life.

1226
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:07,793
And you believed that was all
there was, didn't you?

1227
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,712
The only thing you had left
was your life, but it wasn't.

1228
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:14,550
- Oh, please.
- You found something else.

1229
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:18,554
In that cell, you found something
that mattered more to you than life.

1230
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,057
When they threatened to kill you
unless you gave what they wanted...

1231
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:25,102
...you told them you'd rather die.

1232
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:27,187
You faced your death, Evey.

1233
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:30,315
You were calm. You were still.

1234
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:32,901
Try to feel now what you felt then.

1235
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:41,034
Oh, God.

1236
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:44,871
I felt...

1237
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:46,957
Yes?

1238
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,752
I'm dizzy.

1239
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,005
I need air.

1240
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:56,425
Please, I need to be outside.

1241
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,635
There's a lift.
It'll take us to the roof.

1242
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:18,697
God is in the rain.

1243
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:24,930
V.

1244
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:27,432
I'm leaving.

1245
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:33,438
There are 872 songs in here.

1246
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:37,484
I've listened to them all,
but I've never danced to any of them.

1247
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:40,779
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

1248
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:42,447
I can't stay here.

1249
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:45,492
I know.

1250
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:50,205
Well, you won't find
any more locked doors here.

1251
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:53,333
I thought about keeping this...

1252
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:57,003
...but it didn't seem right,
knowing you wrote it.

1253
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:04,469
I didn't.

1254
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:08,682
May I show you something
before you go?

1255
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:22,028
- She was real.
- Yes.

1256
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:23,989
She's beautiful.

1257
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,242
- Did you know her?
- No.

1258
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:30,078
She wrote the letter
just before she died.

1259
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:33,123
And I delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me.

1260
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:35,208
Then it really happened, didn't it?

1261
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,503
- Yes.
- You were in the cell next to her.

1262
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:43,633
And that's what this is all about.

1263
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,928
You're getting back at them
for what they did to her.

1264
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:50,807
- And to you.
- What was done to me created me.

1265
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:52,851
It's a basic principle of the universe...

1266
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:55,979
...that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction.

1267
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:57,522
Is that how you see it?

1268
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:00,150
- Like an equation?
- What was done to me was monstrous.

1269
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:02,402
And they created a monster.

1270
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:16,082
- Do you know where you'll go?
- No.

1271
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,753
That would have scared me before...

1272
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,630
...but I suppose I should thank you.

1273
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,632
Well...

1274
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:34,851
Thank you.

1275
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:38,980
Goodbye.

1276
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,859
Evey...

1277
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,822
...may I ask you for something?

1278
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:51,785
If I had one wish, I would wish
to see you again, if only once...

1279
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,703
...before the 5th.

1280
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:58,583
- All right.
- Thank you.

1281
01:29:20,814 --> 01:29:23,567
Chancellor, I know no one
seems to want to discuss this...

1282
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:26,152
...but if we're to be prepared
for any eventuality...

1283
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:29,239
...then it can't be ignored any longer.

1284
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:33,910
The red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists.

1285
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,537
Now, it concludes that...

1286
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:39,082
...the most logical delivery system
for the terrorist to use...

1287
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:41,668
...would be an airborne attack.

1288
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:43,461
A separate report has been filed...

1289
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:47,465
...suggesting a train, despite the fact
that the tunnels surrounding Parliament...

1290
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:49,217
...have been sealed shut.

1291
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,344
<i>Who filed that report?</i>

1292
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:54,097
Chief Inspector Finch.

1293
01:29:54,264 --> 01:29:57,142
<i>Do you have any evidence
to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch?</i>

1294
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:59,895
No, sir. Just a feeling.

1295
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,022
<i>If I am sure of anything, inspector...</i>

1296
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:06,359
<i>...it is that this government won't survive
if it is to be subject to your feelings.</i>

1297
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:09,446
<i>Mr. Dascomb,
what we need right now...</i>

1298
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:12,699
<i>...is a clear message
to the people of this country.</i>

1299
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:15,201
<i>This message must be read
in every newspaper...</i>

1300
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:17,913
<i>...heard on every radio,
seen on every television.</i>

1301
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:22,125
<i>This message must resound
throughout the entire interlink!</i>

1302
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:25,670
<i>I want this country to realize
that we stand on the edge of oblivion.</i>

1303
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:30,133
<i>I want every man, woman and child to
understand how close we are to chaos.</i>

1304
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,218
<i>I want everyone...</i>

1305
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:36,139
<i>...to remember why they need us!</i>

1306
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:40,810
<i>In the former United States, civil war
continues to devastate the Midwest.</i>

1307
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:45,315
<i>Scientists attribute this water shortage
to the lack of rainfall the last two years.</i>

1308
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:48,610
<i>Ministry officials expect
water coupon prices to rise.</i>

1309
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:50,737
<i>Police have arrested nine suspects...</i>

1310
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:54,658
Can you believe this shit?
Been going on all summer.

1311
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:58,828
<i>Outside the quarantine zone, a new
airborne pathogen has killed 27 people.</i>

1312
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:03,333
<i>Authorities uncovered new evidence
linking the terrorist organization called V...</i>

1313
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:07,796
<i>...to the St. Mary's viral attack
on London 14 years ago.</i>

1314
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:22,352
My friend inside the Finger
came up with something.

1315
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,396
There were three men.

1316
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:26,356
Covert intel.

1317
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:28,817
Original black-baggers,
all under Creedy.

1318
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:33,697
Alan Percy, Robert Keyes,
William Rookwood.

1319
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:35,949
The day after
the St. Mary's outbreak...

1320
01:31:36,116 --> 01:31:39,536
...Percy gives his Beretta a blow job,
Keyes dies in a fire--

1321
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,204
Rookwood goes missing.

1322
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:44,290
Bloody coincidences
are making me sick to my stomach.

1323
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:46,209
Rookwood.

1324
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:48,253
How do I know that name?

1325
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:58,430
Shit. He must have had
a hidden trip on his file at the Finger.

1326
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:00,890
But how'd he know it was you?

1327
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,019
What do we do?

1328
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:07,981
I'm a cop. I have to know.

1329
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:19,826
I came when they opened it.
It gave me the collywobbles.

1330
01:32:21,494 --> 01:32:23,121
Still does.

1331
01:32:33,339 --> 01:32:35,383
That's close enough, inspector.

1332
01:32:36,926 --> 01:32:38,178
We're not wired.

1333
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:42,724
I'm sorry, but a man in my position
survives by taking every precaution.

1334
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:46,144
- You have information for us?
- No, you already have the information.

1335
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:48,396
All the names and dates
are inside your head.

1336
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:51,024
What you want,
what you really need, is a story.

1337
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:53,193
A story can be true or false.

1338
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:56,905
I leave such judgments to you,
inspector.

1339
01:32:57,739 --> 01:33:01,159
Our story begins,
as these stories often do...

1340
01:33:01,326 --> 01:33:04,454
...with a young,
up-and-coming politician.

1341
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:08,625
He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.

1342
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:13,129
<i>He's completely single-minded and
has no regard for the political process.</i>

1343
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:16,466
<i>The more power he attains,
the more obvious his zealotry...</i>

1344
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:19,260
<i>...and the more aggressive
his supporters become.</i>

1345
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:25,266
<i>Eventually, his party launches a special
project in the name of national security.</i>

1346
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:28,812
<i>At first it's believed to be a search
for biological weapons...</i>

1347
01:33:28,978 --> 01:33:31,773
<i>...and it's pursued without regard
to its cost.</i>

1348
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:35,652
<i>However, the true goal
of this project is power.</i>

1349
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:38,613
<i>Complete and total
hegemonic domination.</i>

1350
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:41,366
<i>The project, however, ends violently.</i>

1351
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:45,328
<i>But the efforts of those involved
are not in vain...</i>

1352
01:33:45,495 --> 01:33:50,500
<i>...for a new ability to wage war is born
from the blood of one of the victims.</i>

1353
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:54,295
Imagine a virus,
the most terrifying virus you can...

1354
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:57,507
...and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure.

1355
01:33:57,674 --> 01:34:02,554
<i>But if your ultimate goal is power,
how best to use such a weapon?</i>

1356
01:34:02,762 --> 01:34:06,391
Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.

1357
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:09,018
<i>A man seemingly
without a conscience...</i>

1358
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:11,479
<i>...for whom the ends
always justify the means.</i>

1359
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:15,233
<i>He suggests that their target
should not be an enemy of the country...</i>

1360
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,277
<i>...but rather, the country itself.</i>

1361
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:20,697
<i>Three targets are chosen
to maximize the effect of the attack:</i>

1362
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:23,867
<i>A school, a tube station
and a water-treatment plant.</i>

1363
01:34:24,033 --> 01:34:26,619
<i>Several hundred die
within the first few weeks.</i>

1364
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:29,122
Three Waters has, in fact,
been contaminated.

1365
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:31,958
Authorities are attempting to control
its deadly spread.

1366
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:34,127
- -Sent destruction
through the Underground.

1367
01:34:35,545 --> 01:34:38,173
<i>Fueled by the media,
fear and panic spread quickly...</i>

1368
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:41,426
<i>...fracturing and dividing
the country until, at last...</i>

1369
01:34:41,593 --> 01:34:43,553
<i>...the true goal comes into view.</i>

1370
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,346
Before the St. Mary's crises...

1371
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:49,559
...no one would've predicted the results
of the election that year. No one.

1372
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:54,189
<i>And then not long after the election,
lo and behold, a miracle.</i>

1373
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:56,900
<i>Some believed it was the work
of God himself.</i>

1374
01:34:57,066 --> 01:35:00,820
<i>But it was a pharmaceutical company
controlled by certain party members...</i>

1375
01:35:00,987 --> 01:35:04,240
<i>...that made them all obscenely rich.</i>

1376
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:08,578
A year later, several extremists are tried,
found guilty and executed...

1377
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:12,040
...while a memorial is built
to canonize their victims.

1378
01:35:13,082 --> 01:35:17,837
But the end result,
the true genius of the plan, was the fear.

1379
01:35:18,004 --> 01:35:20,340
Fear became the ultimate tool
of this government.

1380
01:35:20,506 --> 01:35:23,134
Through it, our politician
was ultimately appointed...

1381
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:27,263
...to the newly created position
of high chancellor.

1382
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:30,058
The rest, as they say, is history.

1383
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:36,105
- Can you prove any of this?
- Why do you think I'm still alive?

1384
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:42,612
All right. We'd like to take you into
protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.

1385
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:44,656
I'm sure you would.

1386
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:49,744
But if you want that recording,
you'll do what I tell you to do.

1387
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:52,872
Put Creedy under 24-hour surveillance.

1388
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:55,917
When I feel safe he can't pick his nose
without you knowing...

1389
01:35:56,084 --> 01:35:57,543
...I'll contact you again.

1390
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:00,004
Till then, cheerio.

1391
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:03,007
Rookwood...

1392
01:36:04,634 --> 01:36:06,511
...why didn't you
come forward before?

1393
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:08,930
What were you waiting for?

1394
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:11,307
Well, for you, inspector.

1395
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:13,268
I needed you.

1396
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,332
Shh, shh, shh...

1397
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:42,630
What's he doing in the dark there?

1398
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:45,341
Creepy Creedy.
Not sure I wanna know.

1399
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:49,095
Sutler can no longer trust you,
can he, Mr. Creedy?

1400
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:51,431
And we both know why.

1401
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:54,475
After I destroy Parliament...

1402
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:58,521
...his only chance will be to offer them
someone else, some other piece of meat.

1403
01:36:58,688 --> 01:36:59,939
And who will that be?

1404
01:37:00,189 --> 01:37:02,358
You, Mr. Creedy.

1405
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:06,029
A man as smart as you
has probably considered this.

1406
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:09,991
A man as smart as you
probably has a plan.

1407
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:13,328
That plan is the reason
Sutler no longer trusts you.

1408
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:15,997
It's the reason why
you're being watched right now...

1409
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:18,958
...why there are eyes and ears
in every room of this house...

1410
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:21,711
- ...and a tap on every phone.
- Bollocks.

1411
01:37:21,878 --> 01:37:26,299
Oh, a man as smart as you, I think,
knows otherwise.

1412
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:29,469
- What do you want?
- Sutler.

1413
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:33,639
Come, now, Mr. Creedy,
you knew this was coming.

1414
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,808
You knew that one day
it'd be you or him.

1415
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:39,312
That's why Sutler's been kept
underground for security purposes.

1416
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:42,648
That's why there are several
of your men close to Sutler...

1417
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:46,611
...men that can be counted on.
All you have to do is say the word.

1418
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:49,697
- What do I get out of this deal?
- Me.

1419
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:54,702
If you accept,
put an X on your front door.

1420
01:37:56,829 --> 01:37:58,748
Why should I trust you?

1421
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:02,126
Because it's the only way
you're ever going to stop me.

1422
01:38:10,009 --> 01:38:13,554
<i>It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.</i>

1423
01:38:15,348 --> 01:38:16,766
<i>May we come up?</i>

1424
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:20,353
<i>You find your own tree.</i>

1425
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:34,283
We got Creepy pinned
like a butterfly for weeks.

1426
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:37,286
Still no word. What's he waiting for?

1427
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:42,917
Yeah? Inspector, it's for you.

1428
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:47,547
- Yeah.
<i>- Is that Chief Inspector Finch?</i>

1429
01:38:47,713 --> 01:38:49,507
- It is.
- <i>This is Captain Clark...</i>

1430
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:51,801
<i>...of the 137th Ward at Southend.</i>

1431
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:53,177
- <i>We found him.</i>
- Found who?

1432
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,430
<i>William Rookwood,
the one you're looking for.</i>

1433
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:59,392
<i>I saw your report a couple weeks back,
thought I'd run it through our John Does.</i>

1434
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:01,477
<i>I hooked him. Perfect dental match.</i>

1435
01:39:01,686 --> 01:39:05,565
<i>A floater. Fishermen picked him up.
No ID, never solved. Till now, that is.</i>

1436
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:09,485
- William Rookwood is dead?
- <i>I'd say so. Twenty years now.</i>

1437
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:14,240
Goddamn it!

1438
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:16,909
That son of a bitch sat there...

1439
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:20,788
...and spoon-fed me that bullshit,
and I ate it up!

1440
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:23,624
So, what do we do now, inspector?

1441
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:26,210
We do what we should
have been doing.

1442
01:39:26,919 --> 01:39:28,212
We find him.

1443
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:52,862
<i>Every day, gentlemen.</i>

1444
01:39:53,029 --> 01:39:57,074
<i>Every day that brings us closer
to November...</i>

1445
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:59,994
<i>...every day that man remains free...</i>

1446
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:02,872
<i>...is one more failure.</i>

1447
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:05,458
<i>Three hundred and forty-seven days,
gentlemen.</i>

1448
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:08,044
<i>Three hundred
and forty-seven failures!</i>

1449
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:10,880
Chancellor, we do not have
the adequate force--

1450
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:14,050
<i>We are being buried
beneath the avalanche...</i>

1451
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:17,178
<i>...of your inadequacies, Mr. Creedy!</i>

1452
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:35,780
I'll get it.

1453
01:40:37,114 --> 01:40:39,408
- Eric Finch?
- Yeah.

1454
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:45,540
Bloody hell.

1455
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:48,209
How many went out?

1456
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:50,795
So far we count eight boxcars.

1457
01:40:50,962 --> 01:40:53,798
- Several hundred thousand, at least.
- Christ.

1458
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:59,428
<i>I want anyone caught
with one of those masks arrested!</i>

1459
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:02,390
Give me the money!
Give me the fucking money!

1460
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:05,560
We're under siege here.
The whole city's gone mad.

1461
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:08,688
- This is exactly what he wants.
- What?

1462
01:41:08,854 --> 01:41:12,567
- Anarchy in the UK!
- Chaos.

1463
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:17,947
<i>Mr. Creedy, I am holding you
personally responsible for this situation.</i>

1464
01:41:20,408 --> 01:41:24,829
<i>The problem is that he knows us
better than we know ourselves.</i>

1465
01:41:26,539 --> 01:41:29,709
That's why I went to Larkhill
last night.

1466
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:33,337
- That's outside quarantine.
- I had to see it.

1467
01:41:34,964 --> 01:41:36,632
<i>There wasn't much left.</i>

1468
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:40,761
<i>But when I was there, it was strange.</i>

1469
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:44,599
I suddenly had this feeling
that everything was connected.

1470
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:51,897
Like I could see the whole thing.

1471
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:57,111
<i>One long chain of events that stretched
all the way back before Larkhill.</i>

1472
01:41:59,155 --> 01:42:02,491
I felt like I could see everything
that had happened...

1473
01:42:08,623 --> 01:42:10,583
...and everything that
was going to happen.

1474
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:12,793
Hey, you!

1475
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:19,133
It was like a perfect pattern
laid out in front of me...

1476
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:22,970
...and I realized that
we were all a part of it...

1477
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:29,393
...and all trapped by it.

1478
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:38,611
So do you know
what's gonna happen?

1479
01:42:39,403 --> 01:42:42,490
No. It was a feeling.

1480
01:42:44,492 --> 01:42:46,118
But I can guess.

1481
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:51,624
With so much chaos,
someone will do something stupid.

1482
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,505
And when they do...

1483
01:42:57,672 --> 01:42:59,632
...things will turn nasty.

1484
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:15,940
<i>Rioters were arrested in Brixton.</i>

1485
01:43:16,148 --> 01:43:20,569
And then Sutler will be forced to do
the only thing he knows how to do.

1486
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:29,078
At which point,
all V needs to do is keep his word.

1487
01:43:30,371 --> 01:43:31,706
And then...

1488
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:38,564
Tonight's your big night.

1489
01:44:39,565 --> 01:44:41,275
You ready for it?

1490
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:45,654
Are we ready for it?

1491
01:45:18,896 --> 01:45:20,564
I missed this song.

1492
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:23,567
I didn't think you'd come.

1493
01:45:24,568 --> 01:45:27,404
- I said I would.
- Ah.

1494
01:45:29,949 --> 01:45:31,534
You look well.

1495
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:33,160
Thank you.

1496
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:39,333
May I inquire as to how
you've avoided detection?

1497
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,461
A fake ID works better
than a Guy Fawkes mask.

1498
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:48,008
I must confess, every time
I heard a siren, I worried about you.

1499
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:51,512
I worried about myself for a while.

1500
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:54,431
But then, one day,
I was at a market...

1501
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:58,686
...and a friend, someone I had worked
with at the BTN, got in line behind me.

1502
01:45:59,854 --> 01:46:04,024
I was so nervous that when the cashier
asked me for my money, I dropped it.

1503
01:46:05,276 --> 01:46:07,653
My friend picked it up...

1504
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,905
...and handed it to me.

1505
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:12,950
She looked at me right in the eyes...

1506
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:15,828
...didn't recognize me.

1507
01:46:18,163 --> 01:46:21,250
Whatever you did to me worked better
than I'd have imagined.

1508
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:29,758
I have a gift for you, Evey...

1509
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:34,930
...but before I give it to you,
I'd like to ask you something.

1510
01:46:35,139 --> 01:46:38,058
Would you dance with me?

1511
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:42,605
Now? On the eve of your revolution?

1512
01:46:42,771 --> 01:46:46,275
A revolution without dancing
is a revolution not worth having.

1513
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:49,153
I'd love to.

1514
01:46:50,571 --> 01:46:53,699
<i>Tonight, I will speak directly
to these people...</i>

1515
01:46:53,866 --> 01:46:56,285
<i>...and make the situation
perfectly clear to them.</i>

1516
01:46:56,452 --> 01:47:02,041
<i>The security of this nation depends
on complete and total compliance.</i>

1517
01:47:02,207 --> 01:47:06,754
<i>Tonight, any protestor,
any instigator or agitator...</i>

1518
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,131
<i>...will be made example of!</i>

1519
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:14,887
Chancellor, there is a contingency
that has not been addressed.

1520
01:47:15,054 --> 01:47:16,889
<i>And what is that, Mr. Dascomb?</i>

1521
01:47:17,056 --> 01:47:19,266
- Should the terrorist succeed--
- <i>He won't.</i>

1522
01:47:19,433 --> 01:47:22,978
I understand that it is highly unlikely,
but if he does--

1523
01:47:23,187 --> 01:47:26,899
<i>If he does, and something happens
to that building...</i>

1524
01:47:27,066 --> 01:47:30,319
<i>...the only thing that will change,
the only difference it will make...</i>

1525
01:47:30,486 --> 01:47:33,238
<i>...is that tomorrow morning,
instead of a newspaper...</i>

1526
01:47:33,405 --> 01:47:37,284
<i>...I will be reading
Mr. Creedy's resignation!</i>

1527
01:47:42,122 --> 01:47:46,251
You've been busy.
They're very scared right now.

1528
01:47:46,418 --> 01:47:50,506
I heard Sutler's going to make
a public statement tonight.

1529
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:52,341
It's nearly time.

1530
01:47:52,508 --> 01:47:55,177
The masks were ingenious.

1531
01:47:55,344 --> 01:47:58,180
It was strange to suddenly see
your face everywhere.

1532
01:47:58,347 --> 01:48:01,475
Conceal me what I am,
and be my aid...

1533
01:48:01,642 --> 01:48:05,020
...for such disguise as haply
shall become the form of my intent.

1534
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:08,023
<i>- Twelfth Night.</i>
- Viola.

1535
01:48:08,232 --> 01:48:10,943
- I don't understand.
- What?

1536
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:14,530
How you can be one of the most
important things that's happened to me...

1537
01:48:14,738 --> 01:48:17,116
...and yet I know
almost nothing about you.

1538
01:48:17,282 --> 01:48:20,077
I don't know where you were born,
who your parents were...

1539
01:48:20,244 --> 01:48:22,705
...if you had any brothers or sisters.

1540
01:48:22,871 --> 01:48:26,000
I don't even know
what you really look like.

1541
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:28,252
Evey, please.

1542
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:31,630
There is a face beneath this mask...

1543
01:48:31,797 --> 01:48:33,632
...but it's not me.

1544
01:48:33,799 --> 01:48:37,177
I'm no more that face than I am
the muscles beneath it...

1545
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:39,013
...or the bones beneath them.

1546
01:48:41,265 --> 01:48:42,474
I understand.

1547
01:48:43,684 --> 01:48:45,269
Thank you.

1548
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:47,771
There isn't much time.

1549
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:50,107
I have something I must give you.

1550
01:48:50,482 --> 01:48:52,484
I went by Parliament.

1551
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:57,489
Never seen anything like it.
Tanks, anti-aircraft, infantry.

1552
01:48:58,365 --> 01:49:01,285
Makes you wish that no one
would show up tonight.

1553
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:05,914
But if they do,
what do you think will happen?

1554
01:49:06,665 --> 01:49:09,251
What usually happens
when people without guns...

1555
01:49:09,418 --> 01:49:12,087
...stand up to people with guns.

1556
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,423
Pull over here.

1557
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:18,093
We've searched these tunnels for weeks.
You think you're gonna find him now?

1558
01:49:21,472 --> 01:49:22,890
Inspector.

1559
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:25,559
It's all gone wrong, hasn't it?

1560
01:49:34,359 --> 01:49:38,155
The Underground?
I thought they closed this all down.

1561
01:49:38,322 --> 01:49:39,573
They did.

1562
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:43,535
It took nearly 10 years to
clear the tracks and lay a bit of my own.

1563
01:49:45,496 --> 01:49:47,039
Let me show you.

1564
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:05,057
These tracks lead to Parliament.

1565
01:50:05,349 --> 01:50:06,767
Yes.

1566
01:50:07,476 --> 01:50:09,478
Then it's really going to happen,
isn't it?

1567
01:50:09,645 --> 01:50:12,940
It will if you want it to.

1568
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,567
- What?
- This is my gift to you, Evey.

1569
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:21,615
Everything that I have: my home,
my books, the gallery, this train...

1570
01:50:21,782 --> 01:50:24,743
...I'm leaving to you to do with
what you will.

1571
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:26,328
Is this another trick, V?

1572
01:50:26,495 --> 01:50:30,833
No. No more tricks. No more lies.

1573
01:50:30,999 --> 01:50:32,918
Only truth.

1574
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:36,255
And the truth is, you made me
understand that I was wrong...

1575
01:50:36,755 --> 01:50:41,677
...that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make.

1576
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:44,638
- Why?
- Because this world...

1577
01:50:44,805 --> 01:50:49,268
...the world that I'm a part of and
that I helped shape, will end tonight.

1578
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:52,354
And tomorrow,
a different world will begin...

1579
01:50:52,521 --> 01:50:57,609
...that different people will shape,
and this choice belongs to them.

1580
01:51:00,612 --> 01:51:02,531
Where are you going?

1581
01:51:02,781 --> 01:51:05,117
The time has come for me
to meet my maker...

1582
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:08,620
...and to repay him in kind
for all that he's done.

1583
01:51:08,787 --> 01:51:11,540
V, wait!
Please, you don't have to do this.

1584
01:51:11,707 --> 01:51:14,293
You could let it go.
We could leave here together.

1585
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:17,421
No. You were right about what I am.

1586
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:19,923
I have no tree waiting for me.

1587
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:24,845
All I want, all I deserve,
is at the end of that tunnel.

1588
01:51:25,012 --> 01:51:26,763
That's not true.

1589
01:51:53,373 --> 01:51:54,750
I can't.

1590
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:05,469
<i>My fellow Englishmen...</i>

1591
01:52:06,011 --> 01:52:08,013
<i>...tonight, our country...</i>

1592
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:09,723
<i>...that which we stand for...</i>

1593
01:52:09,973 --> 01:52:11,516
<i>...and all that we hold dear...</i>

1594
01:52:11,683 --> 01:52:15,437
<i>...faces a grave and terrible threat.</i>

1595
01:52:15,604 --> 01:52:17,105
The area's clean, sir.

1596
01:52:17,689 --> 01:52:21,443
<i>This violent and unparalleled assault
to our security...</i>

1597
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:23,403
<i>...will not go undefended.</i>

1598
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:24,821
Where is he?

1599
01:52:24,988 --> 01:52:26,031
<i>Or unpunished.</i>

1600
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:28,367
Penny for the Guy.

1601
01:52:28,533 --> 01:52:32,537
<i>Our enemy is an insidious one,
seeking to divide us...</i>

1602
01:52:33,121 --> 01:52:37,584
<i>...and destroy the very foundation
of our great nation.</i>

1603
01:52:37,751 --> 01:52:41,797
I have kept my side of the bargain,
but have you kept yours?

1604
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,131
Bring him down.

1605
01:52:43,298 --> 01:52:45,550
<i>Tonight we must remain steadfast.</i>

1606
01:52:46,051 --> 01:52:47,886
<i>We must remain determined.</i>

1607
01:52:48,053 --> 01:52:51,265
<i>But most of all,
we must remain united.</i>

1608
01:52:54,518 --> 01:52:58,146
<i>Those caught tonight
in violation of curfew...</i>

1609
01:52:58,313 --> 01:53:00,983
<i>...will be considered in league
with our enemy...</i>

1610
01:53:01,149 --> 01:53:04,403
<i>...and prosecuted as a terrorist
without leniency or exception.</i>

1611
01:53:04,569 --> 01:53:06,071
I want to see his face.

1612
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:09,700
<i>Tonight I give you
my most solemn vow...</i>

1613
01:53:09,866 --> 01:53:12,286
<i>...that justice will be swift...</i>

1614
01:53:12,452 --> 01:53:14,913
<i>...it will be righteous...</i>

1615
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,332
<i>...and it will be without mercy.</i>

1616
01:53:19,543 --> 01:53:21,670
Oh, God. No.

1617
01:53:21,837 --> 01:53:25,757
At last, we finally meet.

1618
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:30,679
I have something for you, chancellor.

1619
01:53:30,929 --> 01:53:32,723
A farewell gift.

1620
01:53:32,889 --> 01:53:36,518
For all the things you've done,
for the things you might have done...

1621
01:53:36,685 --> 01:53:38,687
...and for the only thing you have left.

1622
01:53:41,064 --> 01:53:42,983
Goodbye, chancellor.

1623
01:53:43,984 --> 01:53:45,193
Mr. Creedy.

1624
01:53:47,571 --> 01:53:49,323
Disgusting.

1625
01:54:02,085 --> 01:54:04,212
Now that's done with...

1626
01:54:04,379 --> 01:54:08,216
...it's time to have a look
at your face.

1627
01:54:08,759 --> 01:54:10,302
Take off your mask.

1628
01:54:10,594 --> 01:54:11,845
No.

1629
01:54:27,235 --> 01:54:28,904
Defiant to the end, huh?

1630
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:34,451
You won't cry like him, will you?
You're not afraid of death.

1631
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:35,786
You're like me.

1632
01:54:35,952 --> 01:54:38,580
The only thing you and I
have in common, Mr. Creedy...

1633
01:54:38,747 --> 01:54:40,374
...is we're both about to die.

1634
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,752
How do you imagine
that's gonna happen?

1635
01:54:44,044 --> 01:54:46,254
With my hands around your neck.

1636
01:54:48,507 --> 01:54:49,633
Bollocks.

1637
01:54:50,759 --> 01:54:52,969
What are you gonna do, huh?

1638
01:54:53,136 --> 01:54:55,263
We've swept this place.
You've got nothing.

1639
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:59,810
Nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks.

1640
01:54:59,976 --> 01:55:01,561
We have guns.

1641
01:55:01,728 --> 01:55:04,981
No, you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty...

1642
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:07,275
...I'm no longer standing,
because if I am...

1643
01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:10,237
...you'll all be dead
before you've reloaded.

1644
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:12,739
That's impossible!

1645
01:55:15,158 --> 01:55:16,201
Kill him.

1646
01:55:40,851 --> 01:55:41,977
My turn.

1647
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:55,842
Die! Die!

1648
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,887
Why won't you die?!

1649
01:56:59,846 --> 01:57:01,264
Why won't you die?

1650
01:57:03,058 --> 01:57:06,186
Beneath this mask
there is more than flesh.

1651
01:57:06,353 --> 01:57:09,147
Beneath this mask there is an idea,
Mr. Creedy.

1652
01:57:10,524 --> 01:57:12,776
And ideas are bulletproof.

1653
01:58:04,452 --> 01:58:07,539
This is perimeter one.
Whitehall is secure. Over.

1654
01:58:07,706 --> 01:58:08,957
This is General Ackroyd.

1655
01:58:09,416 --> 01:58:10,959
Keep communication tight.

1656
01:58:11,126 --> 01:58:14,379
I won't have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is.

1657
01:58:18,341 --> 01:58:19,634
V!

1658
01:58:24,264 --> 01:58:26,808
Oh, God, we have to stop
your bleeding.

1659
01:58:26,975 --> 01:58:31,104
Please, don't.
I'm finished and glad of it.

1660
01:58:31,479 --> 01:58:33,106
Don't say that.

1661
01:58:33,607 --> 01:58:36,484
I told you, only truth.

1662
01:58:39,988 --> 01:58:43,450
For 20 years I sought only this day.

1663
01:58:43,617 --> 01:58:45,744
Nothing else existed...

1664
01:58:47,871 --> 01:58:49,873
...until I saw you.

1665
01:58:50,999 --> 01:58:53,251
Then everything changed.

1666
01:58:54,669 --> 01:58:56,588
I fell in love with you, Evey...

1667
01:58:58,173 --> 01:59:01,343
...like I no longer believed I could.

1668
01:59:01,509 --> 01:59:04,012
V, I don't want you to die.

1669
01:59:06,765 --> 01:59:10,518
That's the most beautiful thing...

1670
01:59:10,685 --> 01:59:13,313
...you could have ever given me.

1671
01:59:20,904 --> 01:59:22,322
V?

1672
01:59:23,531 --> 01:59:24,824
V?!

1673
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:38,213
Eyes and ears have detected movement
heading to Trafalgar Square.

1674
01:59:38,421 --> 01:59:40,423
This is perimeter one.
We have enemy contact.

1675
02:00:12,664 --> 02:00:14,749
Hold it. Stop right there.

1676
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:19,671
You're Evey Hammond, aren't you?

1677
02:00:27,679 --> 02:00:28,972
Then it's over?

1678
02:00:29,472 --> 02:00:30,640
Almost.

1679
02:00:30,807 --> 02:00:33,268
Stop. Get your hand off that lever.

1680
02:00:35,603 --> 02:00:36,688
No.

1681
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,858
Enemy is approaching fast.
Requesting orders.

1682
02:00:40,024 --> 02:00:42,277
- What shall we do?
- No response from Command.

1683
02:00:43,695 --> 02:00:46,030
Or from Party Leader Creedy.

1684
02:00:46,197 --> 02:00:47,490
Or from the high chancellor.

1685
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:49,617
Why are you doing this?

1686
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:52,537
- Because he was right.
- About what?

1687
02:00:52,704 --> 02:00:57,208
That this country needs more than
a building right now. It needs hope.

1688
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:04,758
Bloody hell, stand down! Stand down!

1689
02:01:31,534 --> 02:01:33,953
Jesus bloody Christ.

1690
02:01:59,229 --> 02:02:00,355
It's time.

1691
02:02:21,709 --> 02:02:23,086
Tell me...

1692
02:02:24,087 --> 02:02:26,589
...do you like music, Mr. Finch?

1693
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:48,152
That music?

1694
02:02:48,653 --> 02:02:50,113
Yes.

1695
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:52,115
His music.

1696
02:03:24,022 --> 02:03:25,648
Who was he?

1697
02:03:26,858 --> 02:03:28,151
He was Edmond Dantes.

1698
02:03:30,278 --> 02:03:32,655
And he was my father...

1699
02:03:32,822 --> 02:03:34,782
...and my mother.

1700
02:03:35,658 --> 02:03:37,160
My brother.

1701
02:03:39,162 --> 02:03:40,955
My friend.

1702
02:03:41,915 --> 02:03:43,917
He was you...

1703
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:47,462
...and me.

1704
02:03:49,547 --> 02:03:51,424
He was all of us.

1705
02:04:20,912 --> 02:04:23,331
<i>No one will ever forget that night...</i>

1706
02:04:23,498 --> 02:04:26,209
<i>...and what it meant for this country.</i>

1707
02:04:26,709 --> 02:04:29,087
<i>But I will never forget the man...</i>

1708
02:04:29,253 --> 02:04:30,922
<i>...and what he meant to me.</i>
