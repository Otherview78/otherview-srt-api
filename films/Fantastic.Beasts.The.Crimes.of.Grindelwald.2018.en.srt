1
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,723
You'll be glad
to be rid of him, I expect.

2
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,475
We'd be more than happy
to keep him here in custody.

3
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,561
Six months are enough.

4
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,355
It's time for him to answer
for his crimes in Europe.

5
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,775
Mr. Abernathy: President picquery.
Mr. Spielman, sir.

6
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,445
Prisoner is secured and ready to travel.

7
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,745
Spielman: You've thrown
everything at him, I see.

8
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,789
Seraphina: It was necessary.
He's extremely powerful.

9
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,794
We've had to change his guard
three times. He's very persuasive.

10
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,631
So we removed his tongue.

11
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:20,349
Prisoners: Grindelwald!
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

12
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,105
Prisoners: Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

13
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,201
Spielman: The wizarding
community worldwide

14
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,911
owes you a great debt, madam president.

15
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,080
Do not underestimate him.

16
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,920
Mr. Spielman,
we found his wand hidden away.

17
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,633
Abernathy.

18
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,220
And we found this.

19
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,109
Hiyahl

20
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,524
No more silver tongue. Hmm?

21
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,827
Grindelwald: You have joined
a noble cause, my friend.

22
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,716
I know. I know. I know, Antonio.

23
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,390
So needy.

24
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,771
They're ready for you, newt.

25
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,191
Leta.

26
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,945
What are you doing here?

27
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,157
Theseus thought it would be good
if I became part of the ministry family.

28
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,660
Did he actually say the words
"ministry family"?

29
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,121
That sounds like my brother.

30
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,224
Theseus was disappointed
you couldn't come to dinner.

31
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,144
Any of the nights we've asked you.

32
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,229
Newt: Well, I've been busy.

33
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,691
Leta: He's your brother, newt.
He likes spending time with you.

34
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,110
And so do I.

35
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,659
Oi, you! Hop in, pick.

36
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,455
Why do strange creatures
love you so much?

37
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,600
Well, there are no strange creatures.
Only blinkered people.

38
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,125
Only blinkered people.

39
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,049
How long did you get in detention
for saying that to prendergast?

40
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,635
I think it was a month that time.

41
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:57,013
And I set off a dungbomb under his desk
so I could join you. Do you remember?

42
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,728
Newt: Um...

43
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,647
No, I actually don't remember that.

44
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,108
Theseus: Hello.

45
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,444
Theseus. We were just talking
about newt coming for dinner.

46
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,029
Really? Well...

47
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,865
Look, before we go in there, I...

48
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,996
It's my fifth attempt, theseus.
I know the form.

49
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,662
This isn't gonna
be like the other times. This is...

50
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,748
Just try and keep an open mind.
Will you?

51
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,792
And maybe a little less...

52
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,168
Like me.

53
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,796
Well, it can't hurt.

54
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,257
Come on, let's go.

55
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,181
Travers: Hearing commences.

56
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,186
You want an end to the ban
on you traveling internationally.

57
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,898
Because I'd like
to travel internationally.

58
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:54,404
Subject uncooperative and evasive
on reasons for last international trip.

59
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,447
It was a field trip, sir.

60
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,576
I was just collecting material
for my book on magical beasts.

61
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,149
You destroyed half of New York.

62
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,180
No, that's actually factually incorrect
on two counts.

63
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,205
Theseus: Newt.

64
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,252
Mr. Scamander, it's clear
you're frustrated,

65
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,422
and, frankly, so are we.

66
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,052
In the spirit of compromise,
we'd like to make a proposition.

67
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,929
What kind of proposition?

68
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,641
The committee will agree to lift
your travel ban under one condition.

69
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,768
Spielman: You join the ministry.

70
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,439
Specifically, your brother's department.

71
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,280
I think that...

72
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,407
Theseus is the auror.

73
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,284
I think my talents lie elsewhere.

74
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,702
Guzman: Mr. Scamander,

75
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,289
the wizarding and non-wizarding worlds
have been at peace for over a century.

76
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,918
Grindelwald wants to see
that peace destroyed.

77
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,795
And for certain members
of our community,

78
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,548
his message is very seductive.

79
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,136
Many pure-bloods believe
it is their birthright to rule.

80
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:05,016
Not only our world
but the non-magic world as well.

81
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:12,148
They see Grindelwald as their hero,
and Grindelwald sees this boy

82
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,525
as a means to make this all come true.

83
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,656
I'm sorry. You're talking about credence
as if he were still here.

84
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,617
He survived, newt.

85
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,954
He's still alive.

86
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,289
He left New York months ago.

87
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,542
He's somewhere in Europe.
Where exactly, we don't know, but...

88
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,711
Newt: You want me to hunt credence down?

89
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,714
To kill him?

90
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,050
Same old scamander.

91
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,929
What is he doing here?

92
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,015
I'm taking on the job
that you're too soft to do.

93
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,604
Is that it?

94
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,403
Travel documentation denied.

95
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,448
Newt!

96
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,552
You think I like the idea of grimmson
any more than you do?

97
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,221
Listen, I don't want to hear how
the ends justify the means, theseus.

98
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,306
I think you're gonna have to pull
your head out the sand!

99
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,517
Okay, right, here we go.
What a selfish, irresponsible...

100
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:17,171
The time is coming when everyone
is gonna have to pick a side.

101
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,589
Even you.

102
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,092
I don't do sides.

103
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,724
Newt. Newt.

104
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,480
Come here.

105
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,822
They're watching you.

106
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,085
Grimmson: Well, gentlemen...

107
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,756
I assume this means I have the job.

108
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,632
This will be suitable
after a thorough cleanse.

109
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,262
I want you to go to the circus now.

110
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,556
Give my note to credence.

111
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,307
Begin his journey.

112
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,561
When we've won,
they'll flee cities in the millions.

113
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,479
They've had their time.

114
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,898
We don't say such things out loud.

115
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,775
We want only freedom.

116
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,194
Freedom to be ourselves.

117
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,572
To annihilate non-wizards.

118
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,907
Not all of them. Not all.

119
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,452
We're not merciless.

120
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,997
The beast of burden
will always be necessary.

121
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,775
Ventus.

122
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,111
Newt: Dumbledore.

123
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,699
Were the less conspicuous
rooftops full, then?

124
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,825
Hmm.

125
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,661
I do enjoy a view.

126
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,247
Nebulus.

127
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,962
How was it?

128
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,506
Newt: They're still convinced
that you sent me to New York.

129
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,341
Dumbledore: You told them I didn't?

130
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:13,843
Yes.

131
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,219
Man: Evening.

132
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,637
Even though you did.

133
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,451
You told me where to find that
trafficked thunderbird, Dumbledore.

134
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,786
You knew that I would take him home,

135
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,580
and you knew I'd have to
take him through a muggle port.

136
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,481
Dumbledore: I've always felt an affinity
with the great magical birds.

137
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,358
There's a story in my family

138
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,237
that a Phoenix will come
to any Dumbledore in desperate need.

139
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,032
They say my great-grandfather had one.

140
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,244
And that it took flight when he died,
never to return.

141
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,931
With all due respect, professor,
I don't believe for a minute

142
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,957
that's why you told me
about the thunderbird.

143
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,508
Credence is in Paris, newt.

144
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,053
Trying to trace his real family.

145
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,391
I take it you've heard the rumors
about who he really is.

146
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,237
The pure-bloods think he's the last
of an important French line.

147
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,533
A baby whom everyone thought lost.

148
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,327
Not leta's brother?

149
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,662
That's what they're whispering.

150
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,290
And pure-blood or not, I know this.

151
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,502
An obscurus grows in the absence of love

152
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,254
as a dark twin, an only friend.

153
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,258
If credence has a real brother or sister
out there that can take its place,

154
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,594
he might yet be saved.

155
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,098
Wherever credence is in Paris,
he's either in danger,

156
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,058
or a danger to others.

157
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,603
We may not know who he is yet,
but he needs to be found.

158
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,149
And I rather hope
you might be the one to find him.

159
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,698
What's that?

160
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,993
An address of a very old
acquaintance of mine.

161
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:07,456
A safe house in Paris
reinforced with enchantments.

162
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,709
Safe house?
Why would I need a safe house in Paris?

163
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,379
One hopes you won't, but should things
at some point go terribly wrong,

164
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,964
it's good to have a place to go.

165
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,717
You know, for a cup of tea.

166
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,260
No. No, no, no.

167
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,783
Absolutely not.

168
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,413
No, 'cause I'm banned from
international travel, Dumbledore.

169
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,033
If I leave the country,
they will put me in Azkaban,

170
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,392
and they will throw away the key.

171
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,853
- Do you know why I admire you, newt?
- What?

172
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,106
More, perhaps, than any man I know.

173
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,277
You do not seek power.

174
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,320
Or popularity.

175
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:43,701
You simply ask,
is a thing right in itself?

176
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,496
If it is, you do it no matter the cost.

177
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,434
That's all very well, Dumbledore,
but forgive me for asking.

178
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,168
Why can't you go?

179
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,050
I cannot move against Grindelwald.

180
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,014
It has to be you.

181
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,189
Well, I can't blame you.

182
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,941
In your shoes, I'd probably refuse too.

183
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,486
- What?
- It's late. Good evening, newt.

184
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,779
Wait, no.

185
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,198
Oh, come on.

186
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,963
Dumbledore.

187
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,280
Bunty!

188
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:47,950
Bunty!

189
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:54,456
Bunty, the baby nifflers
are loose again.

190
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,595
Newt: Well done.

191
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,281
I'm so sorry, newt.
They must've picked the lock

192
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,505
- while I was cleaning out the augureys.
- Not to worry.

193
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,766
Bunty: Hmm.

194
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,815
I fed nearly everyone.

195
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,302
Pinky's had his nose drops and...

196
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,484
And Elsie?

197
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,170
Elsie's droppings
are nearly normal again.

198
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,195
Wonderful.

199
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,991
You can, um... you can clock off now.

200
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,764
- I told you to leave the kelpie to me.
- That wound needs more ointment.

201
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,388
I don't want you losing fingers over it.

202
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:49,053
Seriously, you go home now, bunty.

203
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,639
You must be exhausted.

204
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,515
You know the kelpie's easier with two.

205
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,606
Perhaps you should take off your shirt.

206
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,318
Don't worry.

207
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,320
I'll dry offquick enough.

208
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,989
Someone needed to let off some steam.

209
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,573
Ointment, bunty.

210
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,916
You bite bunty again,
and there'll be trouble, mister.

211
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,212
What was that?

212
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,006
I don't know.

213
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,176
But I want you to go home now, bunty.

214
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,720
- Shall I call the ministry?
- No.

215
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,638
I want you to go home. Please.

216
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,399
Woman: Just give me the pieces.
Man: I got it.

217
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,252
Woman: Honey, if you could just
give it to me...

218
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,736
Man: He doesn't care.

219
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,821
If you could just give this
to me, sweetheart.

220
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,120
Hey!

221
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,999
Newt! Get over here, you maniac.

222
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,376
We hope you don't mind, newt.

223
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,544
We let ourselves in.

224
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,172
It's rainin' out there, cats and dogs.

225
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,757
London's cold.

226
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,563
You were supposed
to have been obliviated.

227
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,135
I know.

228
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,762
It didn't work, pal.

229
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,138
I mean, you said it.

230
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,265
The potion only erases bad memories.

231
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,433
I didn't have any.

232
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,769
I mean, uh, don't get me wrong.
I had some weird ones,

233
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,520
and I had some scary ones.

234
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,855
But this angel...

235
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:09,735
This angel over here,
she filled me in on all the bad parts,

236
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,904
and, uh, here we are, I guess, huh?

237
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,531
This is wonderful.

238
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,452
Newt: Wait. Is...

239
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,706
Tina? Tina?

240
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,960
Oh, it's just us, honey.

241
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,671
Me and Jacob.

242
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,068
Queenie: Why don't!
Make us some dinner, huh?

243
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,259
Jacob: Yes!

244
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,349
Hey, honey.

245
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,934
Teen and I aren't talking.

246
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,063
- Newt: Why?
- Oh, well, you know...

247
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,791
She found out about
Jacob and I seeing each other,

248
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,567
and she didn't like it,
'cause of the law.

249
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,319
Not allowed to... oop!

250
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,321
Not allowed to date no-majs,

251
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,157
not allowed to marry them.
Blah, blah, blah.

252
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,829
Well, she was all in a tizzy anyanay
'cause of you.

253
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,706
- Me?
- Yeah, you, newt.

254
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,583
It was in spellbound.

255
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,169
Here. I brought it for you.

256
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,218
"Newt scamander with fiancee
leta Lestrange,

257
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,596
"brother theseus and unknown woman."

258
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,349
No. So theseus is marrying leta, not me.

259
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,309
Oh!

260
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,813
Oh... oh, dear.

261
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,274
Well...

262
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,610
See, teen read that,

263
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,737
and she started dating someone else.

264
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,116
He's an auror.
His name's achilles tolliver.

265
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,617
Jacob: Tolliver.

266
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,041
Queenie: Anyanay...

267
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,545
We are real excited to be here, newt.
This is a...

268
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,297
Well, it's a special trip for us.

269
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,717
You see, Jacob and I,

270
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,219
we're getting married.

271
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,974
I'm marrying Jacob.

272
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,769
Ah!

273
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,981
Jacob: Oh.

274
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,817
Newt: You've enchanted him, haven't you?

275
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,112
What?

276
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:20,699
- I have not.
- Will you stop reading my mind?

277
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,076
Queenie, you've brought him here
against his will.

278
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,538
Oh, that is an outrageous accusation.
Look at him.

279
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,708
He's just happy. He's so happy.

280
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,490
Then you won't mind if I, um...

281
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:34,963
Please don't.

282
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,900
Newt: Queenie, you've got nothing
to fear if he wants to get married.

283
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,843
We can just lift the enchantment,
and he can tell us himself.

284
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,764
Jacob: What do you got there?

285
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,440
What are you gonna do?

286
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,363
What are you gonna do with that,
Mr. Scamander?

287
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:56,944
Surgito.

288
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,998
Congratulations
on your engagement, Jacob.

289
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,375
Wait, what?

290
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,422
Oh, no. You didn't.

291
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,468
Queenie!

292
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:22,719
One second.

293
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,138
Queenie!

294
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:27,432
It's very nice to see you.

295
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,785
Where the hell am I right now?

296
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:29,810
Uh, London.

297
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:30,936
Oh!

298
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,063
I always wanted to go here!

299
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,731
Queenie!

300
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,237
Jacob: Oh, queenie, honey.

301
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,782
Well, I'm curious
when you were gonna wake me up.

302
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,157
After we had five kids?

303
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,454
Why is it wrong to wanna marry you?

304
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,832
- Okay.
- To wanna have a family?

305
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,460
I just want what everyone else has,
that's all.

306
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,464
Wait, wait.

307
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,550
We've talked about this
like a million times.

308
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,176
If we get married and they find out,

309
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,862
they're gonna
throw you in jail, sweetheart.

310
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,055
I can't have that.

311
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,017
They don't like people like me
marrying people like you.

312
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,478
I ain't a wizard. I'm just me.

313
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,274
They're really progressive here,
and they'll let us get married properly.

314
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,860
Sweetheart, you don't need
to enchant me.

315
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,321
I'm already enchanted.

316
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,282
I love you so much.

317
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,992
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

318
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,954
But I can't have you
risking everything like this, you know?

319
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,206
You're not giving us
a choice, sweetheart.

320
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,294
You're not giving me a choice.

321
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,714
One of us had to be brave,
and you were being a coward.

322
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,926
I was being a coward?

323
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,304
If I'm a coward, you're...

324
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,515
Crazy.

325
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,268
I didn't say it.

326
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:56,146
- You didn't have to.
- No, I didn't mean it, sweetheart.

327
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,523
Yeah, you did.

328
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,694
- No.
- I'm gonna go see my sister.

329
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,780
Fine. See your sister.

330
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,865
- Fine.
- No, wait! Wait!

331
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,867
No! Queenie!

332
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,496
I didn't mean it.

333
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,625
I didn't say nothin'.

334
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,598
Papyrus reparo.

335
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,414
Hey, newt!

336
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,708
Newt: Down here, Jacob.
So I'll be with you in a second.

337
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,381
I got my own problems.

338
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,366
Queenie left a postcard.

339
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,285
Tina's in Paris looking for credence.

340
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:34,536
Genius.

341
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,705
Queenie's gonna go straight for Tina.

342
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,415
Okay, we're going to France, pal.

343
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,584
- Oh, hold on. I'll get myjacket.
- I've got it.

344
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,427
Beautiful.

345
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:10,924
Nagini.

346
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,931
Credence.

347
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,353
I think I know where she is.

348
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,777
We escape tonight.

349
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:31,945
Hey.

350
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,203
I've told you
to stay away from her, boy.

351
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,664
Did I say you could take a break?

352
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:44,958
Clean out the kappa.

353
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,753
And you, get ready.

354
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:05,562
Next, in our little show
of freaks and oddities,

355
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:10,400
I present to you a maledictus.

356
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,698
Once trapped
in the jungles of Indonesia,

357
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,493
she is the carrier of a blood curse.

358
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:21,786
Audience: Ohh!

359
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:26,499
Skender: Such underbeings are destined
through the course of their lives

360
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,419
to turn permanently into beasts.

361
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,338
Audience: Ohh!

362
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,007
Skender: But look at her.

363
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,093
So beautiful. Yes.

364
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,889
So desirable.

365
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,769
But soon, she will be trapped forever
in a very different body.

366
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:51,274
Every night when she sleeps,
mesdames et messieurs,

367
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,236
she is forced to become...

368
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,368
She is forced to become...

369
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,129
She is forced to become...

370
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:26,017
Over time, she will not be able
to transform back.

371
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,440
She will be forever trapped
in the body of a snake.

372
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,058
Credence!

373
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,986
Pack it up.

374
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,821
Paris is done for us now.

375
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,145
The boy with the maledictus,
what do you know about him?

376
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,734
He's looking for his mother.

377
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,195
All my freaks think they can go home.

378
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,741
Okay, let's go.

379
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,551
Look, I think you and I
were at the circus

380
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,136
for the same reason, monsieur...

381
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,639
Kama. Yusuf kama.

382
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,183
And you think right.

383
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,310
- What do you want with credence?
- The same as you.

384
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,478
Which is?

385
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,355
To prove who the boy really is.

386
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,319
If the rumors of his identity
are correct,

387
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,989
he and I are, distantly, related.

388
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,743
I am the last male
of my pure-blooded line,

389
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,037
and so,
if the rumors are correct, is he.

390
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,960
Have you read
the predictions of tycho dodonus?

391
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,964
Yeah. But that's poetry, not proof.

392
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,131
Yusuf: Hmm.

393
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,302
If I could show you something better,

394
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:11,182
more concrete,
something that proves who he is,

395
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,894
would the ministries of Europe
and america let him live?

396
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,064
They might.

397
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,192
Then come.

398
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,093
Grindelwald: So...

399
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,682
Credence barebone.

400
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:58,062
Nearly destroyed
by the woman who raised him.

401
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,566
Yet now he seeks
the mother who bore him.

402
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,402
He's desperate for family.

403
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,113
He's desperate for love.

404
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,284
He's the key to our victory.

405
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,870
We know where the boy is, don't we?

406
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,750
- Why don't we grab him and leave?
- He must come to me freely,

407
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,585
and he will.

408
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:25,798
The path has been laid,
and he is following it.

409
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,386
The trail that will lead him to me

410
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:34,891
and the strange and glorious truth
of who he is.

411
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,768
Krall: Why is he so important?

412
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:48,404
Who represents the greatest threat
to our cause?

413
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,990
Albus Dumbledore.

414
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,242
If I asked you now

415
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:57,372
to go to the school where he is hiding
and kill him for me,

416
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,290
would you do it for me, krall?

417
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,049
Credence is the only entity alive

418
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,386
who can kill him.

419
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,931
You really think
he can kill the great...

420
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,727
Can kill Albus Dumbledore?

421
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,605
I know he can.

422
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:27,193
But will you be with us
when that happens, krall?

423
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,572
Will you?

424
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,795
Newt: Jacob, that man
Tina's been seeing...

425
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:49,298
Jacob: Don't worry. She's gonna see you,
and she'll see the four of us together,

426
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,402
it'll bejust like New York
all over again. Don't worry about it.

427
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,778
Newt: Yes, but he's an auror,
queenie said.

428
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:55,122
Jacob: Yeah, he's an auror. So what?
Don't worry about him.

429
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,185
What do you think
I should say to her if I see her?

430
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:06,399
Oh, well, it's best
not to plan these things.

431
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:10,236
You know, you just say
whatever comes to you in the moment.

432
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:17,285
She has eyes just like a salamander.

433
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,495
Don't say that.

434
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,169
Look,
You just tell her that you missed her.

435
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,754
- Right.
- Right, and then,

436
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,757
you came all the way to Paris
just to find her.

437
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,593
She'll love that. And then,

438
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:37,722
tell her you're losing sleep at night
for thinking of her and...

439
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,368
Just don't say nothing about
no salamanders, all right?

440
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,393
- Okay.
- Okay.

441
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,312
Hey. Hey, hey.

442
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,315
It's gonna be all right.

443
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,983
We're in this together, pal.

444
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,804
Okay, I'm gonna help you out.
I'm gonna help you find Tina,

445
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,154
find queenie,

446
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,990
and we'll all be happy again,
just like old times.

447
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,200
Who is this guy?

448
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,455
Newt: Oh, he's the only way I can
leave the country without documentation.

449
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:05,083
Now, you don't suffer from
motion sickness, do you?

450
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,293
I don't do well on boats, newt.

451
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,170
You'll be fine.

452
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,339
Portkey tout: Stir your stumps.
Leaves in one minute.

453
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:13,925
50 galleons.

454
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,176
No, we said 30.

455
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,261
Uh-huh. 30 to go to France.

456
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,305
20 not to tell anyone

457
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,517
I seen newt scamander
leaving the country illegally.

458
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,603
Price of fame, pal.

459
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,943
Mmm. Ten seconds.

460
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,153
- Eight.
- Jacob.

461
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:35,404
Seven.

462
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:37,740
Six.

463
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:39,659
Mmm...

464
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:41,911
Foun

465
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,747
three. Two.

466
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,999
One.

467
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,219
I didn't like
that portkey, newt.

468
00:43:58,386 --> 00:43:59,804
So you keep saying.

469
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,597
Follow me.

470
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,355
Confundus.

471
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,325
Newt: Come on.
It'll wear off in a few minutes.

472
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,168
Appare vestigium.

473
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:36,591
Accio niffler.

474
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,051
Get looking.

475
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,928
Oi! Get looking!

476
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,558
That's a kappa.

477
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,102
It's a Japanese water demon.

478
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,192
Tina?

479
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:55,943
Tina!

480
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,202
What have you found?

481
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,101
Jacob: And we're licking the dirt now.

482
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:25,348
Re velio.

483
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,019
Newt, what made those?

484
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:31,979
That is a zouwu.

485
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,317
It's a Chinese creature.

486
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,653
They are incredibly fast
and incredibly powerful.

487
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,155
They can travel 1,000 miles in a day,

488
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,009
and this one could take you
from one part of Paris to the next

489
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:45,076
in a single leap.

490
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,206
Newt: Oh, good boy.

491
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,376
Jacob, she was here.

492
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,378
Tina stood here.

493
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,797
She has incredibly narrow feet.
Have you noticed?

494
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:01,550
Can't say that I have.

495
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,056
Then someone came towards her.

496
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,403
Avensegium.

497
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,701
- Right. Follow that feather.
- What?

498
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,827
- Jacob, follow the feather.
- Follow the feather.

499
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:30,579
Where is he?

500
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,623
Accio niffler.

501
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,507
Drop the bucket.

502
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,759
I'm sorry,
I don't know what you just said at all.

503
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,345
Welcome to the French ministry of magic.

504
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,138
What is your business, please?

505
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:34,310
I need to
speak to Tina Goldstein.

506
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:39,398
She's an American auror
working on a case here.

507
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,529
We have no Tina Goldstein here.

508
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:49,450
No, I'm sorry.
There must be some sort of mistake.

509
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,495
See, I know she's in Paris.
She sent me a postcard.

510
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,261
I brought it.
I can show it to you. Here.

511
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,999
Maybe you can help me find it here.
It's just in here. Oh!

512
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,878
Rabbits! If you can
just wait one moment!

513
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,422
I know it's in here somewhere.
I definitely packed it.

514
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,840
Where is it?

515
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,342
One second.

516
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,177
What did I do with you?

517
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:44,898
Jacob: Could we at least
stop for coffee or...

518
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:45,923
Newt: Not now, Jacob.

519
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,509
Jacob: Chocolat chaud or...
Just for a second?

520
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,616
- I don't know.
- Newt: This way. Come on.

521
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,977
Jacob: Pain au chocolat?
Half a croissant and a bonbon?

522
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,311
Newt: This way.

523
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,484
Jacob!

524
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:20,583
Jacob?

525
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,895
She's home.

526
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,799
Credence: Are you Irma?

527
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:57,323
Are you Irma dugard?

528
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:03,245
I'm sorry.
Your name is on my adoption paper.

529
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,540
Does this make sense?

530
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:11,003
You gave me
to Mrs. Barebone in New York.

531
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,483
I am not your mother.

532
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,109
I was only a servant.

533
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,532
You were so beautiful a baby.

534
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,162
And you are a beautiful man.

535
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,175
I did not want to leave you there.

536
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,636
Credence: Why didn't they want me?

537
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,185
Why is your name on my adoption paper?

538
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:11,355
I took you to Mrs. Barebone

539
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,401
because she was supposed
to look after you.

540
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,238
She's dead.

541
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,867
How did the boy take it?

542
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,829
He's sensitive.

543
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,542
The ministry won't be happy
when I tell them I missed.

544
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,503
I know my reputation.

545
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:43,507
Listen to me. The disapproval of cowards
is praise to the brave.

546
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:49,763
Your name will be written in glory
when wizards rule the world.

547
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,100
And the clock is ticking faster.

548
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,521
You watch over credence. Keep him safe.

549
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,357
For the greater good.

550
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,527
For the greater good.

551
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,282
Jacob: You know what
I miss about queenie?

552
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,244
Everything.

553
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,915
I even miss the stuff
that drove me nuts.

554
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,917
Like the mind reading.

555
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:30,012
I was lucky to have someone like her
even interested in anything I thought.

556
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:33,849
You know what I mean?

557
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:35,934
Sorry?

558
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:44,443
I was saying, you're sure
the guy is here that we're looking for?

559
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:47,112
Yeah, definitely. The feather says so.

560
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,828
Jacob: Is that the guy
we're looking for?

561
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:19,853
Newt: Yes.

562
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,273
Ooh...

563
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,443
Sorry.

564
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,237
Bonjour. Bonjour, monsieur.

565
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,781
Oh, wait, no.
Sorry. So we actually...

566
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,744
We were just wondering
if you'd come across a friend of ours.

567
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:37,621
Jacob: Tina Goldstein.

568
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,165
Monsieur, Paris is a large city.

569
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,291
Newt: She's an auror.

570
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:46,755
And when aurors go missing,
the ministry tend to come looking, so...

571
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,426
No, I suppose it would probably
be better if we just report her absence.

572
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,303
Is she tall?

573
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,181
Dark? Rather...

574
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:57,588
- Intense.
- Beautiful. She's...

575
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,102
Jacob: Yeah, what I meant to say was...

576
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,729
- No, she's very pretty.
- She's intense too.

577
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,775
I think I saw
someone like this last night.

578
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,779
Perhaps if I showed you where...

579
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:12,466
If you wouldn't mind. That would be...

580
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,992
- That would be lovely.
- Sure.

581
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,656
Tina.

582
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:57,284
Newt.

583
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,567
- Yu s u f: Expelliarmus.
- Oh!

584
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,915
My apologies, Mr. Scamander.

585
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,961
I shall return and release you
once credence is dead.

586
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,129
Kama, wait.

587
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:13,008
You see, either he dies or I do.

588
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,469
No, no, no.

589
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:18,013
Oh, no. No, no, no.

590
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,734
Well, that's not the best start
to a rescue attempt.

591
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,527
Oh, this was a rescue attempt?

592
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,988
You just lost me my only lead.

593
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:38,241
Well, how was the interrogation going
before we turned up?

594
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,579
Jacob: Newt!

595
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,502
Well done, pick.

596
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,714
So you need this man, you said?

597
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,591
Yeah.

598
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,344
I think he knows
where credence is, Mr. Scamander.

599
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:03,892
Well, that'll be that zouwu.

600
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:25,455
Come on, newt. Get outta there.

601
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,092
Come on!

602
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:54,961
What were the three biggest mistakes
that you made last time?

603
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,139
- Caught by surprise, sir.
- Dumbledore: Mmm.

604
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,299
What else?

605
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:01,026
Didn't parry before counter-curse, sir.

606
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,637
Very good. The last one?

607
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:06,806
The most important one?

608
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:16,066
Not learning from the first two.

609
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:21,655
This is a school. You've no right.

610
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,698
I'm the head of magical law enforcement.

611
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,992
I have the right
to go wherever I please.

612
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,537
Out of here.

613
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:35,877
Go with professor McGonagall, please.

614
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,719
He's the best teacher we've got.

615
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,446
- Thanks, mcclaggan.
- Travers: Get out.

616
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,223
Come, mcclaggan.

617
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,397
Newt scamander is in Paris.

618
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:57,857
Really?

619
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,068
Cut the pretense.
I know he's there on your orders.

620
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,195
Oh, if you'd ever had the pleasure
to teach him,

621
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:05,073
you'd know newt is not
a great follower of orders.

622
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,620
You've read
the predictions of tycho dodonus?

623
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,205
Mmm. Many years ago.

624
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,708
"A son cruelly banished

625
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,626
"despair of the daughter

626
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,336
- "return..."
- yes, I know it.

627
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,758
There's a rumor this prediction
refers to the obscurial.

628
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,761
They say that Grindelwald wants...

629
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,805
As a highborn henchman.
I've heard the rumor.

630
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,683
And yet, scamander appears
wherever the obscurial goes,

631
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:34,436
to protect him.

632
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,438
Meanwhile, you've built up

633
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:39,774
quite the little network
of international contacts.

634
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:43,194
However long you keep me
and my friends under surveillance,

635
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:46,698
you're not going to discover plots
against you, Travers,

636
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,450
because we want the same thing.

637
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,452
The defeat of Grindelwald.

638
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:57,500
But I warn you, your policies
of suppression and violence

639
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:00,378
are pushing supporters into his arms.

640
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,172
I'm not interested in your warnings.

641
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,176
Now...

642
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:11,056
It pains me to say it
because I don't like you...

643
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,392
But...

644
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:19,647
You are the only wizard
who is his equal.

645
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:25,487
I need you to fight him.

646
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,452
I can't.

647
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,083
Because of this?

648
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:49,219
You and Grindelwald
were as close as brothers.

649
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,847
Oh, we were closer than brothers.

650
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,152
Will you fight him?

651
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:09,447
I can't.

652
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,118
Well, then you have chosen your side.

653
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,915
From now on,
I shall know every spell you cast.

654
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,084
I'm doubling the watch on you,

655
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,670
and you will no longer teach
defense against the dark arts.

656
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,590
Where's leta? We need to go to Paris.

657
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,014
Dumbledore: Theseus.

658
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:38,059
Theseus, if Grindelwald calls a rally,

659
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:40,854
don't try and break it up.

660
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,314
Don't let Travers send you in there.

661
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,443
If you ever trusted me...

662
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:47,694
Travers: Theseus.

663
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:49,821
Theseus!

664
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:33,196
Girl 1: Even the name Lestrange
makes me feel sick.

665
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,866
You know she stays here every vacation.

666
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:36,784
Her family don't actually want her home.

667
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,387
Girl 1: I don't blame them.
She's so annoying.

668
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:39,579
Did you see her last week?

669
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:40,830
Oscausi!

670
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,462
Girl 2: Professor McGonagall!

671
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:48,755
Lestrange has done it again!

672
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:51,007
McGonagall: Lestrange, stop running!

673
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:54,010
- Lestrange! Disobedient children.
- Girl 3: Leta, come back!

674
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:56,346
Stop! Shame on the house of Slytherin.

675
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,765
A hundred points! Two hundred!

676
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,600
Get back here, right now!

677
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:05,438
Children, stop it! You, stop! Come back!

678
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:07,774
Boy 1: Out of my way!
Boy 2: Where has she gone?

679
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:09,734
Boy 3: I think she went that way!

680
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:15,073
Miss, it was Lestrange. She's horrible.

681
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,751
Young leta: Scamander,
why aren't you packing?

682
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:28,545
I'm not going home.

683
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,547
Why not?

684
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,174
He needs me.

685
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,348
He was hurt.

686
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:48,731
What is that?

687
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:50,775
A raven chick.

688
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,862
Isn't the raven your family emblem?

689
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:57,532
Young leta: Yes, it is.

690
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:10,461
Dumbledore: All right, newt.

691
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,422
Be brave.

692
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,386
That's an unusual one.

693
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:22,932
So Mr. Scamander fears what
more than anything else in the world?

694
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,685
Having to work in an office, sir.

695
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,313
Go ahead, newt.

696
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:32,609
Riddikulus.

697
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,235
Dumbledore: Well done.

698
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,696
Good job. Leta.

699
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:40,867
It's only a boggart.

700
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:42,994
It can't hurt you.

701
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:47,457
Everyone is scared of something.

702
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:50,835
I've been looking fonnard to this.

703
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,507
I don't want to talk about it.

704
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,482
Young newt: They know me,

705
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,944
or they'd hide.

706
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:02,657
They only nest in trees
with wand-quality wood.

707
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,202
Did you know that?

708
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:10,498
And they have very complex social lives.

709
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,169
If you watch them for long enough,
you realize...

710
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:36,023
Hello, leta. This is a surprise.

711
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:42,238
Finding me in a classroom?

712
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:44,866
Was I such a bad student?

713
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,677
On the contrary,
you were one of my cleverest.

714
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,619
I said "bad," not "stupid."

715
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,835
Don't bother answering.

716
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:58,543
I know you never liked me.

717
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,006
You're wrong.

718
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:01,924
I never thought you bad.

719
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,552
You were alone, then.
Everybody else did.

720
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:06,763
And they were right.

721
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,474
I was wicked.

722
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,101
Leta, I know how painful

723
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:14,562
the rumors about your brother corvus
must be for you.

724
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:15,813
No, you don't.

725
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,984
Not unless
you had a brother who died, too.

726
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,236
In my case, it was my sister.

727
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:26,824
Did you love her?

728
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,210
Not as well as I should have done.

729
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,965
Never too late to free yourself.

730
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:49,847
Confession is a relief, I'm told.
A great weight lifted.

731
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:55,937
Regret is my constant companion.

732
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,148
Do not let it become yours.

733
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,577
Oh! No, thank you.

734
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,204
Well...

735
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,122
You've been really kind,

736
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:19,460
but my sister Tina's probably
worried sick about me.

737
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:22,630
You know,
banging on all the doors and things,

738
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,424
so I think I'd better be going.

739
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,593
But you haven't met your host.

740
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,512
Oh, are you married?

741
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:31,848
Let's say,

742
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,017
deeply committed.

743
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:40,273
You see, I can't tell if you're
making a joke or if you're just...

744
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:43,234
French.

745
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:55,746
Hey, knock it off.

746
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,463
You stay right there.

747
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,632
I know what you are.

748
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:08,718
Queenie.

749
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:12,013
We are not here to hurt you.

750
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,515
We only want to help you.

751
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,186
You're so very, very far away from home.

752
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:23,774
Far away from everything you love,
everything that is comfortable.

753
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,738
I would never see you harmed.

754
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:30,740
Even

755
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:36,287
it is not your fault
that your sister is an auror.

756
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,416
I wish you were working with me now

757
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:45,713
towards a world where
we wizards were free to live openly.

758
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:49,508
To love freely.

759
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,481
You are an innocent.

760
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,193
So go now.

761
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,696
Leave this place.

762
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:37,992
Jacob: Hey, uh, newt, buddy. Uh...

763
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,286
Tina's up here.
She's all by her lonesome,

764
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,913
and, uh, maybe you want to come up
and keep her company?

765
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,667
Uh, I've been looking for food,
and I ain't found any,

766
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:50,254
So I guess I'm gonna go upstairs
and try my luck

767
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:52,798
in, oh, I don't know, the attic.

768
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:55,593
Newt: You're all right.

769
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,011
Relashio.

770
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,101
Okay.

771
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:18,699
She's responded well to the dittany.

772
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,660
She was born to run, you see.

773
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:24,872
But I think she's...
She's just lacking in confidence.

774
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:28,060
Mr. Scamander,
have you got anything in your case

775
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:30,252
that might help revive this man?

776
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:31,504
I need to question him.

777
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:34,187
I think he knows who credence really is.
And the scars on his hand

778
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:36,215
- suggest an unbreakable vow.
- An unbreakable vow.

779
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,802
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

780
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:50,648
Lumos.

781
01:16:57,905 --> 01:16:59,240
What was that?

782
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:01,242
There must be
a water dragon in that sewer.

783
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:05,204
They carry these parasites,
you see. They, um...

784
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:07,873
- Jacob.
- Yeah?

785
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:12,545
In my case, in the pocket there,
you'll find a pair of tweezers.

786
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:13,963
Tweezers?

787
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:16,608
- They're thin, pointy...
- Little pointy things.

788
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,112
Jacob: Yes, I know what tweezers are.

789
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,606
All right.
You might not want to watch this.

790
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:24,640
I can handle it.

791
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:30,604
Newt: Come out.

792
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:33,399
Come on. You're all right.

793
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:36,485
- Ew.
- Come on. I got you.

794
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:38,797
Jacob, will you take that for me?

795
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,865
Huh. Ugh!

796
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:44,118
Calamari.

797
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,747
Must kill him.

798
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,249
Who?

799
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:51,458
Credence?

800
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:54,595
Newt: It may take him
a few hours to recover.

801
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:56,630
That parasite's poison is quite strong.

802
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,509
I have to go back to the ministry
with what I've got.

803
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,322
It's nice to see you again,
Mr. Scamander.

804
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:06,432
Jacob: Hey. Hey.
Hold on a second, will ya?

805
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,267
Hold on. Hold on.

806
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,436
Wait! Tina.

807
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,567
You didn't mention salamanders, did you?

808
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:19,320
No, I didn't.
She just ran. I don't know...

809
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,031
So you chase after her.

810
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:25,784
Tina. Please, just listen to me.

811
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:29,455
Mr. Scamander, I need to go talk
to the ministry.

812
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,498
I know how you feel about aurors.

813
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:33,042
I may have been a little strong

814
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,686
in the way that I expressed myself
in that letter.

815
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,880
What was the exact phrase?
"A bunch of careerist hypocrites"?

816
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,441
I'm sorry, but I can't admire people

817
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:42,593
whose answer to everything that
they fear or misunderstand is "kill it."

818
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,178
I'm an auror and I don't.

819
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:46,385
Yes, I know.
That's because you've gone middle head.

820
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,141
Excuse me?

821
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:52,287
It's an expression derived from
the three heads of the runespoor.

822
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:53,711
So the middle one is the visionary.

823
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:56,174
Now, every auror in Europe
wants credence dead, except you.

824
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:57,524
You've gone middle head.

825
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:01,904
Who else uses that expression,
Mr. Scamander?

826
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,865
I think it mightjust be me.

827
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,303
Tina: It's Grindelwald.
He's calling his followers.

828
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:57,543
It's too late.
Grindelwald has come for credence.

829
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:02,172
- He might already have him.
- It's not too late.

830
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:03,841
We can still get to him first.

831
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:07,386
Where are you going?

832
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,346
The French ministry of magic.

833
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,432
That's the last place credence would go.

834
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:13,767
There's a box
hidden in the ministry, Tina.

835
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,520
It's a box that can tell us
who credence really is.

836
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:18,939
A box? What are you talking about?

837
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:20,190
Trust me.

838
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:26,155
Credence: You wanna come out,
just for a little while?

839
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:27,656
You can be free.

840
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:37,458
Nagini: Credence.

841
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:47,009
What do you want?

842
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,093
Grindelwald: From you?

843
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:50,512
Nothing.

844
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:54,516
Foryou?

845
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,395
Everything I never had.

846
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:02,691
But what is it you want, my boy?

847
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,361
I want to know who I am.

848
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:19,875
This is where you will find proof
of your true identity.

849
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:29,343
Come to pere lachaise tonight,
and you will discover the truth.

850
01:21:46,693 --> 01:21:48,695
Father, why did you make me...

851
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:52,408
Jacob: Wait...

852
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:55,577
Wait.

853
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:19,643
I'm afraid we keep no food in the house.

854
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:23,188
Are you a ghost?

855
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:27,484
No. I'm alive.

856
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,488
But I'm an alchemist
and therefore immortal.

857
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,451
You don't look a day over 375.

858
01:22:38,912 --> 01:22:40,539
I'm sorry that we didn't knock.

859
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,541
No. No matter.

860
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:44,960
Albus told me some friends
might be dropping in.

861
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:47,463
Nicolas flamel.

862
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:52,426
Jacob Kowalski.

863
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:53,552
Oh!

864
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:56,221
I'm sorry.

865
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:57,306
It's all right.

866
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,808
- I didn't...
- Oh... oh!

867
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:13,238
At last, we see some development.

868
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:15,824
Yeah. I've seen one of these before.

869
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:18,035
It was at the fair.

870
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:19,888
There was this dame there,
and she had a veil,

871
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:23,207
and I gave her a nickel,
and she told me about my future.

872
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,752
And she missed out
on quite a bit, actually.

873
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:31,924
Oh. Hey, hey.

874
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:35,594
Wait a minute, I know him.
That's the kid. That's credence.

875
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:39,389
Jeez.

876
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:42,559
Hey... hey!

877
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:46,355
That's queenie. There she is. Hi, baby.

878
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,024
Where is this? Is this here?

879
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:51,568
Yes. This is the Lestrange tomb.

880
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:54,238
It lies in the cemetery
of pere lachaise.

881
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:57,241
I'm coming, baby. Stay right there.

882
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:58,659
Thank you, Mr. Flamel.

883
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:02,371
- Ouch.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay.

884
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:05,541
Oh, look after Mr. Tentacles for me.
Oh, no.

885
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:06,708
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

886
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:08,632
Flamel: Please,
you mustn't go to the cemetery.

887
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:32,901
What's happening?

888
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,708
Flamel: Exactly what he said
would happen.

889
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:38,240
Grindelwald rallies
at the cemetery tonight,

890
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:39,741
and there will be death.

891
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:40,993
Then you gotta go.

892
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,787
What? I haven't seen action
in 200 years.

893
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:46,748
Flamel, you can do this.
We believe in you.

894
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:58,218
The box is in
the ancestral records room, Tina.

895
01:24:58,385 --> 01:24:59,803
So it's three floors down.

896
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:00,929
Is that polyjuice?

897
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,806
It's just enough to get me inside.

898
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:13,567
- Who...
- It's my brother, theseus.

899
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,903
He's an auror and a hugger.

900
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,282
What's happening?

901
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:21,491
Grindelwald's rallying.

902
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:23,415
We don't know where,
but we think it's tonight.

903
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:29,541
- Be careful.
- Of course.

904
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:32,308
- Promise me you'll be careful.
- Of course. I'm gonna be careful.

905
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,963
Listen, I want you to hear this from me.

906
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,191
They think that credence boy
might be your missing brother.

907
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:38,759
- My brother is dead.
- I know.

908
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,260
- He died.
- I know.

909
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:43,055
- How many times, theseus?
- And the records will prove that.

910
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:47,059
- Okay? They can't lie.
- Theseus.

911
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:55,609
I want every person at that rally
arrested. If they resist...

912
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:57,128
Sir, forgive me, but if we go in
too heavy,

913
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,363
- don't we run the risk of adding to...
- Just do it.

914
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:19,817
I don't suppose you can disapparate
on ministry premises in France, can you?

915
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:20,842
Nope.

916
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:23,261
Pity.

917
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:26,306
- Newt!
- Yes, I know. I know it's...

918
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:31,978
Theseus: Newt!

919
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,481
Newt!

920
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,233
- Oh!
- That's your brother?

921
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:37,919
So I think I may have mentioned
in my letters

922
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,087
that we have quite
a complicated relationship.

923
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:40,404
Newt, stop!

924
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,090
- Does he wanna kill you?
- Frequently.

925
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:44,074
Enough!

926
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:52,582
He needs to control his temper.

927
01:26:57,754 --> 01:27:00,006
I think that might have been
the best moment of my life.

928
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:45,719
Queenie.

929
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,017
Queenie, honey.

930
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,606
Don't. Don't move.

931
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:09,868
Yes, this is leta Lestrange.

932
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:16,082
And, uh, I'm her...

933
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:17,375
Fiance.

934
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,341
Thank you.

935
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,146
Tina, about that fiancee business...

936
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,524
Oh, sorry. Yeah, I should have
congratulated you.

937
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,359
- No, that's...
- Lumos.

938
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:46,613
Lestrange.

939
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:54,913
Tina, about leta...

940
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,040
Yes, I've just said I am happy for you.

941
01:28:57,207 --> 01:28:59,584
No, I don't... please, don't be happy.

942
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:03,380
No. Sorry. I don't...

943
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:06,258
Obviously, I...

944
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,009
Obviously, I want you to be...

945
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:12,347
And I hear that you are now.
Which is wonderful.

946
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:16,852
Sorry, what I'm trying to say is,
I want you to be happy,

947
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:19,813
but I don't want you to be happy
that I'm happy, because I'm not.

948
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:24,776
Happy.

949
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:26,444
Or engaged.

950
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,365
- What?
- It was a mistake in a stupid magazine.

951
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:32,325
My brother's marrying leta,
June the 6th.

952
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:34,119
I'm supposed to be best man,

953
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:36,913
which is sort of mildly hilarious.

954
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,125
Does he think you're here
to win her back?

955
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:44,546
Are you here to win her back?

956
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:46,047
No, I'm here...

957
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,512
You know, your eyes really are...

958
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:56,683
Are what?

959
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:59,352
I'm not supposed to say.

960
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:04,625
- I cut a picture of you...
- Newt, I read your book and...

961
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,151
- Wait, did you read...
- Did you?

962
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,074
Icut this, um...

963
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:16,912
It's just a picture of you
from the paper,

964
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:20,248
but it's interesting
'cause your eyes in newsprint...

965
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,754
See, in reality they have
this effect in them, Tina. It's like...

966
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:29,132
It's like fire in water, in dark water.

967
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:34,679
And I've only ever seen that...

968
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:39,768
I've only ever seen that in...

969
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,398
Salamanders.

970
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:50,904
Come.

971
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:57,744
Leta: Lestrange.

972
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:03,959
Whoa!

973
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:02,600
Circumrota.

974
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:14,738
Hello, newt.

975
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:20,493
Hello, leta.

976
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:30,170
Newt: Oh, no.

977
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:36,926
Tina: What kind of cats are those?

978
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:38,219
Newt: Uh, these aren't cats.

979
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:40,513
They're matagots.
They're spirit familiars.

980
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:42,390
They guard the ministry.

981
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:44,079
But they won't hurt you unless you...

982
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:45,560
Stupefy!

983
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:47,812
Unless you attack them.

984
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:49,647
Oops.

985
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:51,649
- Leta.
- Leta: Reverte.

986
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:18,885
Accio!

987
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:31,564
Ascendio!

988
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,408
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

989
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:28,037
Okay. Wait. Hold it there, please.

990
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:30,665
Come on.

991
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,293
Oh!

992
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:34,544
All right.

993
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:39,424
Newt: Okay, wait.

994
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:56,065
Yusuf: You, go back.
Move! Out of the way!

995
01:34:57,775 --> 01:34:59,986
If I must kill you as well as corvus,
I shall.

996
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:02,197
Stop!

997
01:35:06,659 --> 01:35:07,660
Yusuf.

998
01:35:09,162 --> 01:35:10,788
Is that really you?

999
01:35:16,836 --> 01:35:18,588
My little sister?

1000
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:22,967
Credence: So he's your brother.

1001
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:26,262
Who am I?

1002
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:28,348
I don't know.

1003
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:31,059
I'm tired of living with no name
and no history.

1004
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,606
Just tell me my story,
then you can end it.

1005
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:38,441
Your story is our story.

1006
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:45,365
- Our story.
- No, Yusuf.

1007
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:04,300
Yusuf: My father was Mustafa kama.

1008
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:08,388
Pure-blood of Senegalese descent
and most accomplished.

1009
01:36:09,681 --> 01:36:11,391
My mother, laurena,

1010
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:15,603
was equally highbred, a noted beauty.

1011
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:18,398
They were deeply in love.

1012
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:24,654
They knew a man of great influence
from a famous French pure-blood family.

1013
01:36:26,823 --> 01:36:28,366
He desired her.

1014
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:31,786
Maman. Maman!

1015
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:37,375
Lestrange used the imperius curse
to seduce and abduct her.

1016
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:41,296
I tried to prevent it,
but he attacked me.

1017
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:44,966
That was the last time I ever saw her.

1018
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:50,888
She died giving birth to a little girl.

1019
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:53,683
You.

1020
01:36:57,061 --> 01:37:01,149
The news of her death
drove my father insane.

1021
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:03,443
With his dying breath,

1022
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:08,114
my father charged me to seek revenge.

1023
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:12,660
Kill the person Lestrange loves
best in the world.

1024
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:15,872
I thought at first it'd be easy.

1025
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:18,708
He had only one close relative.

1026
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,044
You.

1027
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:22,295
But he...

1028
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:23,963
Say it.

1029
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:26,507
Yusuf: He never loved you.

1030
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:33,681
He remarried,
and not three months after her death.

1031
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:39,687
He loved her no more
than he had loved you.

1032
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:48,237
But then his son, corvus,
was born at last.

1033
01:37:48,404 --> 01:37:53,076
And that man who had never known love
was filled with it.

1034
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:55,453
All he cared about

1035
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:57,580
was little corvus.

1036
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:02,794
So this is the truth?

1037
01:38:04,212 --> 01:38:06,047
I am corvus Lestrange?

1038
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:08,049
- Yes. Yes.
- No.No

1039
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:11,636
Yusuf: Realizing that Mustafa kama's son
had sworn revenge,

1040
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:14,389
your father sought to hide you
where I couldn't find you.

1041
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:19,685
So he confided you to his servant,
who boarded a ship for america.

1042
01:38:19,852 --> 01:38:22,897
- He did send corvus to america, but...
- Yusuf: His servant, Irma dugard,

1043
01:38:23,523 --> 01:38:24,857
was a half-elf.

1044
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:26,734
Her magic was weak,

1045
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:28,986
and therefore left no trace
I could follow.

1046
01:38:31,322 --> 01:38:34,450
I had only just discovered
how you had escaped

1047
01:38:34,617 --> 01:38:36,828
when I received news I never expected.

1048
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:39,997
The ship had gone down at sea.

1049
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:42,250
But you survived, didn't you?

1050
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:46,504
Somehow, someone had pulled you
from the water.

1051
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:50,174
"A son cruelly banished
despair of the daughter

1052
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:53,052
"return, great avenger,
with wings from the water."

1053
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:55,888
There stands the despairing daughter.

1054
01:38:56,055 --> 01:38:59,475
You are the winged raven,
returned from the sea,

1055
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:03,604
but I'm the avenger of my family's ruin.

1056
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:07,984
I pity you, corvus.

1057
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:11,362
But you must die.

1058
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:14,449
Corvus Lestrange is already dead!
I killed him!

1059
01:39:20,913 --> 01:39:21,914
Accio!

1060
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:42,977
My father owned
a very strange family tree.

1061
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:48,357
It only recorded the men.

1062
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:55,114
The women in my family
were recorded as flowers.

1063
01:39:58,409 --> 01:39:59,577
Beautiful.

1064
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:02,997
Separate.

1065
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:07,710
My father sent me to america
with corvus.

1066
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:16,636
Irma was to pose as a grandmother
with two grandchildren.

1067
01:40:22,391 --> 01:40:24,477
Corvus never stopped crying.

1068
01:40:29,065 --> 01:40:30,358
Woman: Do you have any news?

1069
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:32,151
Sailor: All hands to station!

1070
01:40:32,944 --> 01:40:34,779
Run to station!

1071
01:40:43,246 --> 01:40:45,446
Leta: I never wanted to hurt him.

1072
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:52,630
I only wanted to be free of him.

1073
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:54,840
Just for a moment.

1074
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:02,348
Just a single moment.

1075
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:09,230
Give him to me.

1076
01:41:10,273 --> 01:41:11,899
Sailor: Everyone, to the lifeboats!

1077
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:13,776
Woman: They want us
to put on life jackets.

1078
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:15,296
Newt: You didn't mean to do it, leta.

1079
01:42:17,673 --> 01:42:19,425
So it wasn't your fault.

1080
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:23,387
Oh, newt.

1081
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:30,019
You never met a monster
you couldn't love.

1082
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:36,025
Tina: Leta...

1083
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:39,028
Do you know who credence really is?

1084
01:42:40,613 --> 01:42:42,990
Did you know when you swapped them?

1085
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:08,349
Jacob: Queenie?

1086
01:43:35,835 --> 01:43:37,169
They're pure-bloods.

1087
01:43:37,503 --> 01:43:39,046
They kill the likes of us for sport.

1088
01:43:41,757 --> 01:43:42,758
Queenie?

1089
01:43:42,883 --> 01:43:44,593
Jacob!

1090
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:46,512
Honey, you're here! Hi!

1091
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:47,972
Hi, hon. Hi.

1092
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:50,474
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1093
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:52,768
I never should have done it.
I love you so much.

1094
01:43:52,935 --> 01:43:54,854
And you know that I love you, right?

1095
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:57,106
- Yeah.
- Good. Let's get the hell outta here.

1096
01:43:57,273 --> 01:43:59,066
Oh, no, wait a second.

1097
01:44:01,277 --> 01:44:04,780
I just thought maybe we could
hear him first.

1098
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,991
Just listen. That's all.

1099
01:44:08,117 --> 01:44:09,368
What are you talking about?

1100
01:44:14,707 --> 01:44:15,875
It's a trap.

1101
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:17,376
Yeah.

1102
01:44:18,878 --> 01:44:20,838
Queenie, the family tree.

1103
01:44:21,005 --> 01:44:22,047
It's all been bait.

1104
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:25,760
We have to find a way out of here
right now.

1105
01:44:27,636 --> 01:44:28,971
You go find the others.

1106
01:44:29,054 --> 01:44:30,347
What are you gonna do?

1107
01:44:31,015 --> 01:44:32,516
I'll think of something.

1108
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:24,235
My brothers, my sisters,

1109
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:26,946
my friends,

1110
01:45:27,905 --> 01:45:31,742
the great gift of your applause
is not for me. No.

1111
01:45:32,743 --> 01:45:34,995
It is for yourselves.

1112
01:45:37,498 --> 01:45:39,542
You came today because of a craving

1113
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:43,254
and a knowledge

1114
01:45:44,964 --> 01:45:47,925
that the old ways serve us no longer.

1115
01:45:51,053 --> 01:45:54,890
You came today because you crave
something new.

1116
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:58,018
Something different.

1117
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:02,106
It is said

1118
01:46:02,565 --> 01:46:05,943
that I hate ies non-magiques.

1119
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:08,320
The Muggles.

1120
01:46:08,487 --> 01:46:10,322
Man: Vermin!
Grindelwald: The no-maj.

1121
01:46:11,448 --> 01:46:13,033
The can't-spells.

1122
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:16,620
I do not hate them.

1123
01:46:17,538 --> 01:46:18,873
I do not.

1124
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:22,710
For I do not fight out of hatred.

1125
01:46:25,296 --> 01:46:28,883
I say the Muggles are not lesser,

1126
01:46:29,884 --> 01:46:31,176
but other.

1127
01:46:32,136 --> 01:46:33,470
Not worthless,

1128
01:46:35,055 --> 01:46:36,724
but of other value.

1129
01:46:37,933 --> 01:46:42,104
Not disposable,
but of a different disposition.

1130
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:45,357
Magic blooms

1131
01:46:47,443 --> 01:46:50,446
only in rare souls.

1132
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:56,577
It is granted to those
who live for higher things.

1133
01:46:57,578 --> 01:47:00,915
Oh, and what a world we would make
for all of humanity.

1134
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:03,792
We who live for freedom,

1135
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:06,545
for truth,

1136
01:47:09,173 --> 01:47:10,424
and for love.

1137
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:22,519
It isn't illegal to listen to him.

1138
01:47:23,646 --> 01:47:25,272
Use minimum force on the crowd.

1139
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:28,651
We mustn't be what he says we are.

1140
01:47:34,573 --> 01:47:39,286
The moment has come
to share my vision of the future

1141
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:44,375
that awaits if we do not rise up

1142
01:47:46,126 --> 01:47:51,173
and take our rightful place
in the world.

1143
01:48:35,217 --> 01:48:36,885
Not another war.

1144
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:45,894
That is what we are fighting.

1145
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:48,605
That is the enemy.

1146
01:48:50,566 --> 01:48:51,817
Their arrogance.

1147
01:48:53,318 --> 01:48:55,029
Their power lust.

1148
01:48:57,281 --> 01:48:58,699
Their barbarity.

1149
01:49:00,576 --> 01:49:04,371
How long will it take
before they turn their weapons on us?

1150
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:09,043
Do nothing when I speak of this.

1151
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:11,920
You must remain calm

1152
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:16,008
and contain your emotions.

1153
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:22,514
There are aurors here among us.

1154
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:35,569
Come closer, brother wizards. Join us.

1155
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:38,489
Do nothing.

1156
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:41,033
And no force.

1157
01:49:56,757 --> 01:49:59,885
Grindelwald: They have killed
many of my followers.

1158
01:50:00,677 --> 01:50:01,845
It is true.

1159
01:50:03,097 --> 01:50:07,309
They confined me
and tortured me in New York.

1160
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:12,731
They had struck down
their fellow witches and wizards.

1161
01:50:14,358 --> 01:50:18,779
For the simple crime
of seeking the truth.

1162
01:50:20,531 --> 01:50:22,324
For wanting freedom.

1163
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:30,582
Your anger, your desire for revenge
is natural.

1164
01:50:34,503 --> 01:50:35,504
Grindelwald: No!

1165
01:51:06,535 --> 01:51:10,122
Take this young warrior
back to her family.

1166
01:51:18,297 --> 01:51:19,464
Disapparate.

1167
01:51:20,132 --> 01:51:21,258
Leave.

1168
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:25,304
Go forth from this place
and spread the word.

1169
01:51:26,638 --> 01:51:29,850
It is not we who are violent.

1170
01:51:47,993 --> 01:51:49,203
Let's take him.

1171
01:52:18,315 --> 01:52:22,110
Aurors, join me in this circle.

1172
01:52:23,946 --> 01:52:25,364
Pledge to me

1173
01:52:26,615 --> 01:52:28,158
your eternal allegiance,

1174
01:52:29,076 --> 01:52:30,160
or die.

1175
01:52:30,827 --> 01:52:32,704
Only here shall you know freedom.

1176
01:52:33,288 --> 01:52:35,832
Only here shall you know yourself.

1177
01:52:39,127 --> 01:52:41,755
Auror: Move! Run! Run!

1178
01:52:42,965 --> 01:52:45,050
Play by the rules!

1179
01:52:45,217 --> 01:52:47,844
No cheating, children.

1180
01:52:52,641 --> 01:52:54,226
He knows who I am.

1181
01:52:54,393 --> 01:52:57,771
He knows what you were born,
not who you are!

1182
01:52:57,854 --> 01:52:58,939
Newt: Credence!

1183
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:16,665
Queenie, honey. Queenie.
You gotta wake up.

1184
01:53:18,417 --> 01:53:19,501
Jacob.

1185
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:21,586
He's the answer.

1186
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:23,005
He wants what we want.

1187
01:53:23,171 --> 01:53:24,548
- No.
- Yeah.

1188
01:53:34,516 --> 01:53:37,477
This has all been for you, credence.

1189
01:53:40,439 --> 01:53:41,857
Walk with me.

1190
01:53:43,567 --> 01:53:45,277
Hon. No!

1191
01:53:45,444 --> 01:53:46,987
Walk with me!

1192
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:50,407
You're crazy.

1193
01:53:52,826 --> 01:53:53,827
Queenie.

1194
01:53:55,620 --> 01:53:57,247
Queenie, don't do it!

1195
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:06,256
Queenie.

1196
01:54:08,925 --> 01:54:09,926
Tina: Queenie!

1197
01:54:27,652 --> 01:54:29,154
Grindelwald: Mr. Scamander.

1198
01:54:29,237 --> 01:54:33,408
Do you think Dumbledore
will mourn for you?

1199
01:54:43,668 --> 01:54:45,837
Leta: Grindelwald! Stop!

1200
01:54:53,387 --> 01:54:54,388
Leta...

1201
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:07,442
Grindelwald:
This one I believe I know.

1202
01:55:08,402 --> 01:55:10,153
Leta Lestrange.

1203
01:55:11,321 --> 01:55:16,785
Despised entirely amongst wizards,
unloved, mistreated,

1204
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:22,457
yet brave, so very brave.

1205
01:55:27,587 --> 01:55:29,214
Time to come home.

1206
01:55:47,357 --> 01:55:48,608
I love you.

1207
01:56:24,769 --> 01:56:26,438
I hate Paris.

1208
01:57:06,311 --> 01:57:07,395
Together, in a circle.

1209
01:57:07,562 --> 01:57:08,980
Your wand into the earth.

1210
01:57:10,148 --> 01:57:12,359
Or all Paris will be destroyed.

1211
01:57:19,324 --> 01:57:20,825
Both: Finite!

1212
01:57:22,702 --> 01:57:23,703
Finite!

1213
01:57:24,162 --> 01:57:25,163
Finite!

1214
01:57:26,581 --> 01:57:27,582
Finite!

1215
01:59:37,337 --> 01:59:39,172
I've chosen my side.

1216
02:00:00,402 --> 02:00:01,778
Come here.

1217
02:00:02,278 --> 02:00:04,781
I've got you. I've got you.

1218
02:00:49,659 --> 02:00:52,078
I think it's best
if he speaks to him alone.

1219
02:01:26,237 --> 02:01:28,114
Grindelwald:
Is he frightened of me still?

1220
02:01:29,616 --> 02:01:31,284
You need to be careful.

1221
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:34,496
He's not sure he made the right choice.

1222
02:01:35,914 --> 02:01:38,917
Be very gentle with him.

1223
02:01:44,422 --> 02:01:46,424
I have a gift for you, my boy.

1224
02:01:58,853 --> 02:02:00,271
Dumbledore: Is it true?

1225
02:02:01,231 --> 02:02:02,440
About leta?

1226
02:02:03,983 --> 02:02:04,984
Yes.

1227
02:02:07,737 --> 02:02:09,322
I'm so sorry.

1228
02:02:15,995 --> 02:02:18,164
It's a blood pact, isn't it?

1229
02:02:21,125 --> 02:02:23,211
You swore not to fight each other.

1230
02:02:30,593 --> 02:02:33,888
How in the name of Merlin
did you manage to get...

1231
02:02:37,433 --> 02:02:39,269
Grindelwald doesn't seem to understand

1232
02:02:39,352 --> 02:02:41,855
the nature of the things
he considers simple.

1233
02:02:57,954 --> 02:02:59,289
Can you destroy it?

1234
02:02:59,455 --> 02:03:00,707
Maybe.

1235
02:03:02,834 --> 02:03:04,085
Maybe.

1236
02:03:10,258 --> 02:03:12,135
Would he like a cup of tea?

1237
02:03:13,136 --> 02:03:14,554
He'll have some milk.

1238
02:03:16,973 --> 02:03:18,725
Hide the teaspoons.

1239
02:03:24,647 --> 02:03:29,527
Grindelwald: You have suffered
the most heinous of betrayals,

1240
02:03:30,737 --> 02:03:34,657
most purposely bestowed upon you
by your own blood.

1241
02:03:34,741 --> 02:03:36,951
Your own flesh and blood.

1242
02:03:37,785 --> 02:03:40,705
And just as
he has celebrated your torment,

1243
02:03:42,957 --> 02:03:46,794
your brother seeks to destroy you.

1244
02:04:07,774 --> 02:04:11,402
There is a legend in your family
that a Phoenix will come to any member

1245
02:04:11,611 --> 02:04:13,321
who is in dire need.

1246
02:04:20,912 --> 02:04:23,206
It is your birthright, my boy.

1247
02:04:27,502 --> 02:04:28,670
As is

1248
02:04:30,296 --> 02:04:32,715
the name I now restore to you.

1249
02:04:35,468 --> 02:04:36,886
Aurelius.

1250
02:04:38,346 --> 02:04:41,140
Aurelius Dumbledore.

1251
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:47,689
We will go down in history together
as we remake this world.

1252
02:13:42,890 --> 02:13:43,891
