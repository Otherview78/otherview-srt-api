I don't want to have to wait
for full clean-up just to get

16
00:02:46,463 --> 00:02:48,143
- a status report.
- We're collecting this data

17
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,144
- as quickly as possible.
- That's not good enough.

18
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:51,735
Okay, maybe you can tell me
what happened.

19
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:53,536
There was some kind of breach.
One of the astronauts

20
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:55,905
- sent a distress call.
- What about the crew?

21
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:59,542
- We're still investigating.
- Where did it go down?

22
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:01,545
It's 20 kilometers
west of Sibu.

23
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:03,747
Did we at least retrieve
all of the samples?

24
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:05,549
No. We have
three of them.

25
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:07,517
One of the organisms
got out of containment,

26
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,589
and it's missing.
We don't know which one.

27
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:25,636
What is she saying?

28
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,774
One of the astronauts
is still alive.

29
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,779
That's Jameson.

30
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,067
- Morning, sunshine.
- What?

31
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:01,504
I'm awake.

32
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:03,938
Missed me.

33
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,639
- I'm awake.
- Here you go.

34
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:07,874
- You can have it back.
- Thank...

35
00:05:07,876 --> 00:05:10,911
Oh, wow,
you're wearing a suit. Yes!

36
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:13,413
- I love it when you wear the suit.
- Thank you.

37
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:15,716
I have depositions today
in the Life Foundation case.

38
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:17,985
Hey, let me know
how your meeting goes.

39
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:19,621
My meeting?

40
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:21,488
Oh, shit. Yeah.

41
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,392
My meeting.

42
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:29,898
- Coffee.
- Oh. Mmm!

43
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,800
- You are perfect.
- Thank you.

44
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:33,702
Hey, you know what...
You know what night

45
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:35,536
- it is tonight, right?
- Date night.

46
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:38,473
Mmm-hmm. So, I will pick
you up around, uh, 6:00.

47
00:05:38,475 --> 00:05:40,909
And please do not forget
your helmet.

48
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:42,477
Oh, I'm glad
that you like it,

49
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,979
'cause I plan on wearing it
at our wedding.

50
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:45,714
That's hot.

51
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:47,616
Feed the cat.

52
00:05:47,618 --> 00:05:48,917
I will.

53
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,451
I love you!

54
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:52,054
Love you, too.
Feed the cat.

Hey, Richard!

73
00:06:54,787 --> 00:06:57,222
- Lookin' good!
- Eddie, you can't park there, bro.

74
00:06:57,455 --> 00:06:59,556
Come on, man. There's
no such thing as can't.

75
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:00,824
How'd she do?

76
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:03,761
Berkeley. Brown. MIT.

77
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:05,762
- She's got a scholarship, bro.
- What'd I tell you?

78
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:07,233
You told me what?

79
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:09,201
- No such thing as can't.
- Eddie.

80
00:07:10,436 --> 00:07:11,769
The bike.

81
00:07:11,771 --> 00:07:15,173
MIT! Whoo!

82
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:18,644
You know what I love
about this view?

83
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,247
- It never gets old.
- Yeah, well, uh...

84
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:24,148
Height's not really my thing.

85
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,719
But, uh...
What's the deal?

86
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,088
- I got you the big one, exclusive.
- Yeah? Who?

87
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,722
Carlton Drake.

88
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:32,758
- Carlton Drake?
- The man's a visionary.

89
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,960
He wants to talk
about his rockets,

90
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:37,663
assure everyone they're safe,
that the crash was an anomaly.

91
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,031
Uh...

92
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:41,033
He's... He's seriously off.

93
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:42,734
I'm gonna level with you.

94
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:45,137
Carlton Drake could buy us
with his pocket cash,

95
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:48,574
turn this building into his
own garage if he so wished.

96
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:51,577
Now, you're just gonna ask him
about his space program,

97
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:53,981
you're gonna thank him, and
you're gonna bid him a nice day.

98
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:58,917
He's a crook.

99
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,121
Eddie, when you had nowhere
to go, we gave you a home.

100
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:04,292
Now, you know we love
the Eddie Brock show.

101
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,227
There isn't a better investigative
reporter working today,

102
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:08,995
but no one
is above the network.

103
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:12,065
So do me a favor, Eddie,
don't start your shit again.

104
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:13,767
All right, all right.

105
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:18,138
- For me.
- All right. I'll do it.

106
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,806
I don't know why he gave
me this assignment, Annie.

107
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:21,608
It's not...
It's not what I do.

108
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,143
Well, my mother
always told me

109
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:26,112
that anything in life worth
having would take sacrifice...

110
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:27,315
- Mmm-hmm.
- Patience...

111
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,749
- Mmm.
- And be a lot of work.

112
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:31,184
- Oh.
- That's you...

113
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:32,853
- That's not.
- ...that I'm talking about.

114
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:34,055
- Nah.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:35,256
Well, you're lucky
to have me.

116
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:37,258
To be fair,
I'm quite a catch.

117
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,727
That's what my mom told me.

118
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,761
Are you gonna
behave yourself tomorrow?

119
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:44,999
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

120
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:47,068
I can't, you know,
not do my job.

121
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,936
The guy you work for
is a complete...

122
00:08:48,938 --> 00:08:51,005
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

123
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:52,640
and my firm works for him.

124
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:55,109
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

125
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:58,213
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

126
00:08:58,215 --> 00:09:00,981
- A repeat?
- Of the <i>Daily Globe</i> incident.

127
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:02,717
Ow! Really?

128
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,519
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

129
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:05,820
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- I was not. I did not.

130
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:07,222
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

131
00:09:07,224 --> 00:09:09,758
No, I still have
currency in New York.

132
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,060
I was going places.

133
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:13,161
I wasn't running.

134
00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:14,930
I was going places.

135
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:16,765
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

136
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:19,634
- Me?
- You are my home.

137
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:22,372
You're not so bad yourself,
champ.

138
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:28,044
- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

139
00:09:28,046 --> 00:09:29,312
Let's just get the check.

140
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:59,043
I'm gonna get a drink.

141
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:44,724
Shh.

142
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,308
Very soon,
another Life Foundation rocket

143
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,877
will be sent
on an exploratory mission.

144
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,147
And that's how, one day,
we might all live in space.

145
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:11,849
Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you

146
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:13,985
some of the cool stuff
that we do here,

147
00:11:13,987 --> 00:11:16,255
I'm hoping I've inspired
each and every one of you

148
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:18,457
to go out there
and create things that others

149
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:20,859
- have only dreamt of.
- Mr. Drake?

150
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:23,929
- Shh!
- It's okay. Don't silence her.

151
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:25,864
Come here. What's your name?

152
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:27,900
- Allie.
- It's okay, Allie.

153
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:29,542
You know, sometimes
that's what people do.

154
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:32,171
They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.

155
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:34,241
But you know what?
In the end,

156
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:37,176
we're the ones
who change the world.

157
00:11:37,178 --> 00:11:40,113
Take good care
of that, Allie.

158
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:41,880
Guys, this is Dr. Skirth.

159
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:43,249
- Say hi.
- Hi.

160
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:44,451
Hello, kids.

161
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,486
Um, sorry to interrupt,

162
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:48,854
but it's time to get changed
for your interview.

163
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:51,057
Yeah. Uh, kids,
sorry to leave you.

164
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:53,360
Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.

165
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:56,830
Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's
question, and any others.

166
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:58,711
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!

167
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:00,536
<i>What do you say,
Mr. Drake,</i>

168
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:02,503
we just start
at the beginning?

169
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,540
- Born to British parents.
- Mmm-hmm.

170
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:08,074
And then at 19, you
discovered a gene therapy

171
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:10,877
that literally doubles
the life expectancy

172
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,380
- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,

173
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:14,447
it tripled their
life expectancy.

174
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:16,117
But it's okay.

175
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:19,153
Okay, um, 24.
That's still extremely young.

176
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,154
All right, you create

177
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:22,857
- the Life Foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.

178
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:24,526
- And then...
- Rockets.

179
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:26,530
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

180
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:28,532
that you're gonna go
and explore space.

181
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:31,065
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

182
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,900
- Uh-huh.
- ...that space exploration

183
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:34,503
is crucial
in our quest to cure

184
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,438
everything that ails us
here on Earth.

185
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,005
But if you think about
everything we've found...

186
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,440
- Uh-huh.
- ...in the oceans and on land,

187
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,376
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

188
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:43,879
To this plethora
of untapped resources?

189
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:45,379
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

190
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:47,215
from your pharmaceutical
companies

191
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:49,016
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

192
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,217
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

193
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:51,554
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

194
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:53,855
So, I have to ask,
how does that work,

195
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,457
you know, exactly,
the Life Foundation thing?

196
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:57,459
How does it...
How does it, um...

197
00:12:57,461 --> 00:12:59,394
I don't know,
how does it go about,

198
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:02,464
- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
- Eddie, we're talking

199
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:04,300
- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

200
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:06,301
I'm talking
about the allegations.

201
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:07,904
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that

202
00:13:07,906 --> 00:13:09,404
your entire empire
has been built

203
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:11,475
- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.

204
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:13,910
It's true, right?
It says that you recruit

205
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:16,112
the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests...

206
00:13:16,114 --> 00:13:17,447
- Hmm.
- ...that more often than not

207
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:19,014
end up killing people.

208
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,517
Yeah, I'm aware
of these rumors online.

209
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,884
There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.

210
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,319
Right. What about
the legal cases?

211
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,886
Sorry?

212
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,023
Uh, the actual legal cases,
like Sarah Chambers,

213
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:28,958
- Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.
- That's it. Time to go.

214
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,293
Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.

215
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:31,894
And they're just some
of the people who walked

216
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,896
- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.

217
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:35,566
- Cut the camera off, please.
- Thank you very much.

218
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:37,266
- Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The Dead...

219
00:13:37,268 --> 00:13:38,535
- Could you show him out, please?
- The Dead Found...

220
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:40,337
Don't touch me.
The Dead Foundation thing.

221
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:41,205
- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.

222
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:42,071
Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.

223
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:42,939
Is that a threat?

224
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:44,577
Have a nice life.

225
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:50,246
I know what
you're going to say, but...

226
00:13:50,248 --> 00:13:52,916
This guy, he is
all the way bad, Jack.

227
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:54,951
- If you just give...
- Who's your source?

228
00:13:54,953 --> 00:13:57,491
- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?

229
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:04,928
I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.

230
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,667
This isn't the Wild Wild West.

231
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,634
We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.

232
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:11,201
We do the work.

233
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:13,674
We substantiate
our accusations.

234
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:15,974
We provide evidence.

235
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:19,310
You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumbass.

236
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:27,251
You're fired, Eddie.

237
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:29,254
I can't trust you.

238
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:31,659
Have a nice life.

239
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:33,773
- Will just take a second.
- Okay.

240
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:36,529
Hey.

241
00:14:36,531 --> 00:14:38,531
You are pathologically
self-absorbed.

242
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,064
Annie. Annie,
can you talk to me first?

243
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:41,099
Your ego requires
constant attention,

244
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:43,168
and you're stubborn as hell.

245
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,403
But I was willing to roll with
it, Eddie, because I loved you.

246
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:47,575
You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?

247
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:51,612
What you did
got me fired.

248
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:54,449
You used me.

249
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:04,493
Annie? Annie.

250
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:39,128
Oh, my God.

251
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:44,266
You're beautiful.

252
00:17:41,622 --> 00:17:43,320
Test 36.

253
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:44,856
Biological interactions

254
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:47,191
between two different organisms.

255
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:49,795
These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host

256
00:17:49,797 --> 00:17:51,830
in order to survive
for any amount of time

257
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:53,665
in an oxygen-rich environment.

258
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:54,868
Well, why are
all these hosts

259
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:56,636
showing this hyper-acute
rejection?

260
00:17:56,638 --> 00:17:58,605
That's what
we're trying to find out.

261
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:02,844
The bonding process
is starting.

262
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:09,349
It's equalizing.

263
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:18,423
But why? Why this rabbit?

264
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:20,896
- It's similar to an organ transplant.
- Huh.

265
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,863
Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?

266
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:26,431
- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.

267
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:30,302
If we do achieve symbiosis, they
should be able to survive here,

268
00:18:30,304 --> 00:18:34,607
but also we would
be able to survive there.

269
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:36,308
"We"?

270
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,444
- Begin human trials.
- Oh, it's way too soon

271
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:40,412
to even begin to think
about something like...

272
00:18:40,414 --> 00:18:41,848
Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.

273
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,350
I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?

274
00:18:44,352 --> 00:18:46,032
I understand,
but it's an ethical question.

275
00:18:46,155 --> 00:18:47,888
Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.

276
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,758
Hey, how are your kids?

277
00:18:51,794 --> 00:18:53,293
Let's begin human trials.

278
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:54,430
Good work.

279
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:17,887
Hey, Jack.

280
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:21,856
Do you ever feel
like your life

281
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:25,493
- is like one monumental screwup?
- Nope.

282
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:27,205
<i>Here at the Life Foundation,</i>

283
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:29,263
- <i>we've always believed...</i>
- Isn't that your buddy?

284
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:30,733
<i>...in finding the lessons
in our disappointments.</i>

285
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:32,432
<i>In the months
since our rocket failed,</i>

286
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:33,969
<i>we've learned so much.</i>

287
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:36,973
Do you think we could,
like, switch him off?

288
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,674
Some people
are trying to watch that.

289
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:39,977
Oh, you are, are you?

290
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:42,580
- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?

291
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:45,983
I used to be.

292
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:47,883
<i>We take
the same view of progress.</i>

293
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:50,519
<i>Thrilled to announce
that the Life Foundation</i>

294
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:53,490
<i>has now begun preparations
on its next launch.</i>

295
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,890
All right, Jack,
this is for you.

296
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:56,860
I do not want you
to spend it all at once.

297
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,894
I'm going to go home and chase
myself around the room,

298
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:00,896
playing hard to get.

299
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:06,368
- Hey, Maria.
- Eddie.

300
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,005
- How's it going?
- Righteous, Eddie.

301
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,009
Oh! Yeah, we're empty.

302
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,377
Cost you $5.

303
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,514
$5 for a paper that's free?

304
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,516
I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,

305
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,318
got the papers out and
brought 'em back over here,

306
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,789
so you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.

307
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:25,856
You did that for me?

308
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,458
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

309
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,529
- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.

310
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,964
Tell you what, you give
me a dollar for a song,

311
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,632
I'll throw in the paper.

312
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,367
I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,

313
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:39,839
but not to sing,
all right?

314
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:41,605
Deal.

315
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,507
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

316
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:47,343
No. You're welcome.

317
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,647
Hey, Mrs. Chen.

318
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,916
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, aches and pains,

319
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,918
you know, aches and pains.

320
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,087
You look like shit.

321
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,488
Excuse me?

322
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,858
You look like shit.

323
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,061
And you look
as beautiful as ever.

324
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:05,796
- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.

325
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,666
Have you been meditating
like I showed you?

326
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:09,668
- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,

327
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,802
- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,

328
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:15,006
because I bought a DVD off your
cousin, and it was in Mandarin.

329
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:17,809
Yeah, I don't understand that, either.

330
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:19,544
See, that right there, I don't
understand what you just said.

331
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:20,712
That is the problem.

332
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:28,587
Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.

333
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,989
Please.

334
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:32,456
Let's go.

335
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,138
Before the price goes up
for my protection.

336
00:21:36,764 --> 00:21:39,999
The full payment is due.
Now.

337
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:42,101
Make sure you have
my money ready, Chen.

338
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:43,805
I don't like to wait.

339
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:03,092
Life hurts, Eddie.

340
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:05,093
It just does.

341
00:22:22,443 --> 00:22:25,444
I gotta go.

342
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:29,517
- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.

343
00:22:32,923 --> 00:22:34,155
What a dick.

344
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:05,521
I'm not even
asking to staff there.

345
00:23:05,523 --> 00:23:07,055
Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.

346
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:08,523
I can use a pseudonym.

347
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:09,992
Any name. Think...
You pick a name.

348
00:23:09,994 --> 00:23:11,993
I could be a woman.
Have you seen <i>Tootsie?</i>

349
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:18,900
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

350
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:20,771
Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.

351
00:23:26,777 --> 00:23:32,214
<i>Realize deeply that the
present moment is all you ever have.</i>

352
00:23:32,216 --> 00:23:36,051
<i>Make the now the primary
focus of your life.</i>

353
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:38,520
<i>Any action is often better
than no action,</i>

354
00:23:38,522 --> 00:23:40,156
<i>especially if you
have been stuck</i>

355
00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:43,893
<i>in an unhappy situation
for a long time.</i>

356
00:23:43,895 --> 00:23:46,896
<i>If it is a mistake, at least
you learned something,</i>

357
00:23:46,898 --> 00:23:48,531
<i>in which case
it's no longer...</i>

358
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:10,787
Thank you all for
bringing us to this moment.

359
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:15,226
Our names will be spoken
long after we are dust.

360
00:24:15,228 --> 00:24:16,895
History starts now.

361
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:19,597
This is day one.

362
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,867
This is first contact.

363
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:25,236
Let's get to work.

364
00:24:38,084 --> 00:24:40,220
<i>Establishing subject baseline.</i>

365
00:24:42,255 --> 00:24:44,557
<i>All vital signs are normal.</i>

366
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:53,298
Put me through.

367
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,135
There's no need to be
frightened, Isaac.

368
00:24:57,571 --> 00:24:58,937
There's no need.

369
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:01,973
Isaac. You know
that's a biblical name?

370
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:04,009
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

371
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:06,144
<i>God said to Abraham,
"Give me your son,</i>

372
00:25:06,146 --> 00:25:08,880
<i>"show me you are willing
to sacrifice the one thing</i>

373
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:12,050
"most precious to you,"
and Abraham was willing.

374
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,119
You know what's always
impressed me about that story?

375
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:17,192
<i>It isn't Abraham's sacrifice.
It's Isaac's.</i>

376
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,730
<i>Now, I don't know what kind of
God would ask that of someone,</i>

377
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,065
<i>but it doesn't change
anything for me.</i>

378
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:30,870
Isaac is still the hero
of this story.

379
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:33,773
Look around you.
Look at the world.

380
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:35,241
<i>What do you see?
War, poverty,</i>

381
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,378
<i>a planet on the brink
of collapse.</i>

382
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:40,680
<i>I would argue that God
has abandoned us.</i>

383
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:42,315
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain, Isaac,

384
00:25:42,317 --> 00:25:45,351
<i>so now it's down to you and me
to put this right.</i>

385
00:25:45,353 --> 00:25:47,889
<i>And this time, Isaac,
we can.</i>

386
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:53,893
We will.

387
00:25:53,895 --> 00:25:56,966
<i>This time,
I will not abandon us.</i>

388
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:00,369
<i>Yes.</i>

389
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:04,273
Open it.

390
00:26:17,254 --> 00:26:19,353
What the hell is that?
What? No, what...

391
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:21,089
<i>Please let me... No.</i>

392
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:23,258
Oh, please, please, please!

393
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,411
His vitals are holding steady.

394
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:46,115
- Where the hell did it go?
<i>- Incredible.</i>

395
00:26:46,117 --> 00:26:47,685
<i>Where did it go?</i>

396
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,855
<i>Where is it?</i>

397
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:33,165
Bring in the next volunteer.

398
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:04,929
You know,
I used to be a reporter.

399
00:28:04,931 --> 00:28:06,330
I was...

400
00:28:06,332 --> 00:28:09,066
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

401
00:28:09,068 --> 00:28:13,237
My job, it required you to...
You know, to follow people

402
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:18,546
that did not want to be followed
and hide in plain sight.

403
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,344
I mean...

404
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:22,149
You have to know
how to disappear.

405
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,219
I was pretty good, but,
you know, you...

406
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:29,156
Whoever you are, you suck.

407
00:28:30,157 --> 00:28:32,123
Okay.

408
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,192
- Uh, my name is Dora Skirth.
- Mmm.

409
00:28:34,194 --> 00:28:35,528
I need your help.

410
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,229
- I work at the Life Foundation.
- You do?

411
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:38,964
- Yes.
- Wow. Good for you.

412
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:40,966
We're done.

413
00:28:40,968 --> 00:28:42,568
No...

414
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,904
Mr. Brock, please...
Please listen to me.

415
00:28:45,906 --> 00:28:47,973
Everything that you
accused him of,

416
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:49,308
you were right.
It's all true.

417
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,842
- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

418
00:28:50,844 --> 00:28:52,911
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

419
00:28:52,913 --> 00:28:55,247
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

420
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:57,083
and he's using them
like guinea pigs,

421
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:59,152
and they are dying.

422
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,253
They are all dying.

423
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:02,824
- You've seen that?
- Yes.

424
00:29:03,793 --> 00:29:04,993
Come here.

425
00:29:07,027 --> 00:29:08,227
Why would I believe you?

426
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:09,395
Because it's true.

427
00:29:09,397 --> 00:29:11,164
I believed in him, and I...

428
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,099
I told myself
that it was worth it

429
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:15,269
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

430
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:16,631
- Something else.
- Go to the cops.

431
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,137
I can't do that.

432
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:19,940
I'm afraid of what
will happen to my family.

433
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:21,575
He's a very dangerous man, and
he's a very powerful man...

434
00:29:21,577 --> 00:29:23,243
I know, I know
how dangerous he is,

435
00:29:23,245 --> 00:29:24,912
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

436
00:29:24,914 --> 00:29:27,114
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

437
00:29:27,116 --> 00:29:29,484
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

438
00:29:29,486 --> 00:29:32,251
I lost my apartment, I lost
everything I ever cared about.

439
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:34,557
You know why? Carlton Drake
ruined me. Finished.

440
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:38,092
Now, if you are
who you say you are,

441
00:29:38,094 --> 00:29:40,394
genuinely,
and you have proof,

442
00:29:40,396 --> 00:29:43,464
then you should be
very, very, very afraid.

443
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:45,500
I am.

444
00:29:45,502 --> 00:29:47,502
You need to find yourself another
white knight, Ms. Skirth,

445
00:29:47,504 --> 00:29:48,969
because I am done.

446
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:50,339
I am done
with all of this shit.

447
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,574
What shit?

448
00:29:52,576 --> 00:29:55,543
All of this "saving my
fellow man" shit.

449
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,114
All right? Good night.

450
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:17,300
Eddie?

451
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,670
Well, hey. Whoa.

452
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,937
Anne, I was just walking by,
and, uh...

453
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:24,272
I saw Mr. Belvedere.

454
00:30:24,274 --> 00:30:26,041
I felt concerned for
his welfare, so...

455
00:30:26,043 --> 00:30:27,645
Eddie...

456
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:29,479
This is Dan.

457
00:30:29,481 --> 00:30:31,515
- Dan, this is Eddie.
- Yeah.

458
00:30:31,517 --> 00:30:33,249
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

459
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:34,891
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

460
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:35,984
- Really?
- Yeah.

461
00:30:35,986 --> 00:30:37,987
I'm a big fan of your work.

462
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:40,322
- Thank you.
- Really?

463
00:30:40,324 --> 00:30:42,528
It's pretty cool, all the
people that he took down.

464
00:30:43,428 --> 00:30:44,962
Yeah, I was one of them.

465
00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:48,498
Well, look,
I'll let you guys catch up.

466
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,220
- So I'll see you inside?
- You're the best.

467
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:54,005
- Really nice meeting you, man.
- Uh, you, too.

468
00:31:01,045 --> 00:31:03,215
He has a key. You know he has a key?

469
00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:06,584
Yeah. How else
would he get in?

470
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:12,055
Yeah. Well, uh...

471
00:31:12,057 --> 00:31:14,458
So, uh, what you up to?

472
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,662
You realize that's light-years away
from being any of your business, right?

473
00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:19,699
Hey, well, just asking,
you know.

474
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:23,266
So, is Dan, uh, a lawyer?

475
00:31:23,268 --> 00:31:25,235
No, he's a doctor.

476
00:31:25,237 --> 00:31:27,273
- Surgeon, actually.
- Oh.

477
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:30,273
How's Mr. Belvedere, anyway?

478
00:31:30,275 --> 00:31:31,710
I would say
that he misses you,

479
00:31:31,712 --> 00:31:33,478
but that would be bullshit,
'cause...

480
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,179
- He's a cat.
- No, because he never liked you.

481
00:31:35,181 --> 00:31:36,582
No, he's a cat,
and cats don't like anyone.

482
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:38,719
You look good, by the way.
You doing good?

483
00:31:38,953 --> 00:31:40,151
What are you
doing here, Eddie?

484
00:31:40,153 --> 00:31:41,233
I'm here 'cause I miss you.

485
00:31:42,322 --> 00:31:44,221
A lot.

486
00:31:44,223 --> 00:31:45,624
You know, we were gonna
get married.

487
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:48,192
That wasn't so long ago,
and now, you know...

488
00:31:48,194 --> 00:31:50,097
I can't really believe
that we're not...

489
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:54,502
Are we gonna try
and find our way back?

490
00:31:55,468 --> 00:31:57,004
No, we can't.

491
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,140
You did this, Eddie.

492
00:32:03,043 --> 00:32:05,712
Not Carlton Drake,
not the network.

493
00:32:05,714 --> 00:32:06,781
You.

494
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:16,150
<i>Uh, hello.
This is Dr. Skirth.</i>

495
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:17,554
Yes, Eddie Brock here.

496
00:33:19,255 --> 00:33:20,389
Talk to me.

497
00:33:24,327 --> 00:33:26,494
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

498
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:28,096
Just stay down
and shut up, please.

499
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:32,703
<i>53.5,
win-909 RPM.</i>

500
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,774
Whew.

501
00:33:39,776 --> 00:33:42,344
<i>Overpopulation
and climate change.</i>

502
00:33:42,346 --> 00:33:44,480
These are two things
that Drake cannot control.

503
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:46,448
Yeah, got it, right.

504
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,485
We are literally a generation
away from an uninhabitable Earth.

505
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:52,320
- Uh, yeah.
- Drake is using his personal rockets

506
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,422
to scout real estate.

507
00:33:54,424 --> 00:33:56,291
You know, it's a really
interesting story,

508
00:33:56,293 --> 00:33:58,427
but we need to just get to the
part where he's killing people.

509
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:01,497
Drake sent a ship
on a recon mission.

510
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:04,333
On the way back,
they found a comet.

511
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:06,637
A comet?

512
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:09,705
Onboard computers indicated the presence
of life, of millions of organisms.

513
00:34:09,707 --> 00:34:11,642
Wait, wait, wait, when you
say "millions of organisms,"

514
00:34:11,644 --> 00:34:13,442
- what do you mean?
- We brought back some specimens.

515
00:34:13,444 --> 00:34:14,880
You're talking about aliens?

516
00:34:15,114 --> 00:34:17,514
Like, aliens?

517
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:18,882

518
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:20,617
Aliens, yeah.

519
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:22,921
Yes.

520
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:24,355
But we don't
call them that.

521
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,224
- We call them Symbiotes.
- Symbiotes?

522
00:34:28,226 --> 00:34:30,895
And they cannot survive in
our environment without help.

523
00:34:30,897 --> 00:34:35,365
Drake believes that the union
between human and Symbiote

524
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:38,234
is the key to our survival,
but not here on Earth.

525
00:34:38,236 --> 00:34:42,707
Drake is trying to put human
beings and aliens together?

526
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:44,206
So they can live in space?

527
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,642
We call them hosts.

528
00:34:45,644 --> 00:34:48,445
That's nuts, isn't it?
That's completely insane.

529
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:50,548
Yes. There's no protocol
for this thing.

530
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,816

We don't know what happened.

- Already did, sir.
- But I didn't.

585
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:31,867
Get it out of my sight.

586
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:34,002
- Carlton, you need to see this.
- What now?

587
00:40:34,004 --> 00:40:35,870

590
00:40:41,945 --> 00:40:43,947
See, his body just needed
time to adjust.

591
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,951
I don't want to waste any more time.
I want to up the tests.

592

- Okay?
- Yeah.

593
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,691

00:45:13,258 --> 00:45:15,092
I get claustrophobic, too.

687
00:45:15,094 --> 00:45:16,596
Dr. Lewis?

688
00:45:16,828 --> 00:45:18,962
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mrs. Manfredi. How are you?

689
00:45:18,964 --> 00:45:20,532
Oh, I just saw Morris.

690
00:45:20,534 --> 00:45:23,603
And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.

691
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:25,782
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank you so much.

692
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,871
Yeah, my pleasure.

693
00:45:27,873 --> 00:45:29,574
Okay, Mrs. Manfredi,
we talked about the dog.

694
00:45:29,576 --> 00:45:31,175
Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.

695
00:45:31,177 --> 00:45:33,244
Sorry. Gemini.

696
00:45:33,246 --> 00:45:34,878
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.

697
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,313
- But for now, go home, get some rest.
- Uh-huh.

698
00:45:36,315 --> 00:45:37,882
I'll call you when
your tests are in.

699
00:45:37,884 --> 00:45:39,217
- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.

700
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:40,859
- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.

701
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:44,355
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.

702
00:45:44,357 --> 00:45:45,590
Did you have
the same reactions

703
00:45:45,592 --> 00:45:47,258
regardless
of the temperature...

704
00:45:50,163 --> 00:45:51,865
Good afternoon,
Dr. Skirth.

705
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:59,204
The creature
and the host are one.

706
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:00,641
Everything was fine.

707
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:03,477
So, why does the human
continue to waste away?

708
00:46:03,479 --> 00:46:06,479
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

709
00:46:06,481 --> 00:46:08,013
But the organism
is unaffected?

710
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,382
- The Symbiote is thriving.
- Good.

711
00:46:09,384 --> 00:46:11,585
But once again,
it's killing the host.

712
00:46:11,587 --> 00:46:12,627
It's consuming his organs.

713
00:46:13,955 --> 00:46:15,289
Oh, watch this.

714
00:46:19,628 --> 00:46:21,948
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!

715
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,198
Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.

716
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,638
- Well, then don't make those sounds.
- Okay.

717
00:46:30,138 --> 00:46:31,937
He was stabilizing.
What happened?

718
00:46:31,939 --> 00:46:33,379
He's approaching
acute liver failure.

719
00:46:34,242 --> 00:46:36,175
We're gonna need another host.

720
00:46:36,177 --> 00:46:38,211
Such poor design.

721
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:41,046
- Excuse me?
- Human beings.

722
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,316
Sorry to interrupt.

723
00:46:45,087 --> 00:46:46,689
Thought you'd like
some good news.

724
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:48,625
I'm sorry.

725
00:46:59,368 --> 00:47:00,703
<i>Hungry!</i>

726
00:47:00,937 --> 00:47:03,103
Oh, goddamn.

727
00:47:03,105 --> 00:47:05,005
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

728
00:47:05,007 --> 00:47:07,207
Can I get through, please?
Excuse me.

729
00:47:07,209 --> 00:47:08,509
Thank you.

730
00:47:08,511 --> 00:47:10,076
I'm just gonna stay here,
all right?

731
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:12,650
Until the cable car stops.

732
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:19,688
We're good.
All right. Thank you.

733
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:21,691
Excuse me.

734
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,095
Oh, hey, Anne.

735
00:47:28,097 --> 00:47:31,066
Eddie, hi. How you feeling?

736
00:47:31,068 --> 00:47:32,736
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

737
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:36,070
Well, Eddie,
you have a parasite.

738
00:47:36,072 --> 00:47:37,708
They're not exactly sure
how you got it,

739
00:47:37,943 --> 00:47:39,675
but it would
explain the fever.

740
00:47:39,677 --> 00:47:41,275
<i>That would make sense.</i>

741
00:47:41,277 --> 00:47:45,147
Also, I'm hearing,
uh, a voice.

742
00:47:45,149 --> 00:47:47,048
<i>Auditory hallucinations
are actually very common.</i>

743
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,417
Oh, hey, Dan.
How you doing?

744
00:47:48,419 --> 00:47:50,052
<i>I didn't realize that
you were on the call, too.</i>

745
00:47:50,054 --> 00:47:52,287
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Mmm.

746
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:54,189
Hey, Dan,
would this parasite...

747
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:56,124
Would it, like, be able to
make me, I don't know...

748
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:59,261
Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,

749
00:47:59,263 --> 00:48:01,296
but super, super fast?

750
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:03,065
<i>Yes. We just did.</i>

751
00:48:03,067 --> 00:48:04,433
<i>Uh, well, Eddie,
it sounds like</i>

752
00:48:04,435 --> 00:48:06,301
it might be causing
some metabolic abnormalities

753
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:08,471
that are making it hard for your
body to maintain homeostasis.

754
00:48:08,473 --> 00:48:11,373
You said "causing" and "body,"
and... I lost you.

755
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:13,342
Listen, Eddie, um, we are
gonna get you on some meds,

756
00:48:13,344 --> 00:48:14,677
and we are gonna
clear that out.

757
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:16,246
- Yes.
<i>- Never gonna happen.</i>

758
00:48:16,248 --> 00:48:18,751
Will you stop doing that now.
Not now.

759
00:48:18,985 --> 00:48:20,650
- Eddie, we're just trying to help you.
- <i>I know.</i>

760
00:48:20,652 --> 00:48:23,186
I know. I'm just, I'm not
actually talking to you, Annie.

761
00:48:23,188 --> 00:48:24,655
Who are you talking to?

762
00:48:24,657 --> 00:48:26,557
I'm just gonna call you back,
all right?

763
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,459
Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.

764
00:48:44,744 --> 00:48:46,210
Yeah?

765
00:48:46,212 --> 00:48:47,852
Hey, can you turn
your music down, please?

766
00:48:48,014 --> 00:48:49,748
'Cause I'm having
a really hard time.

767
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,248
Whatever.

768
00:48:54,185 --> 00:48:56,186
Yeah, sure, man. Yeah.

769
00:48:56,188 --> 00:48:58,628
- I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

770
00:49:00,627 --> 00:49:03,129
I was troubled by

771
00:49:04,163 --> 00:49:05,765
what we've been doing.

772
00:49:05,767 --> 00:49:07,566
I get it.

773
00:49:07,568 --> 00:49:08,835
I get it.

774
00:49:10,102 --> 00:49:11,537
We've all been troubled.

775
00:49:11,539 --> 00:49:14,107
It's the nature
of what we do.

776
00:49:15,742 --> 00:49:18,813
But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.

777
00:49:20,514 --> 00:49:21,815
I need that from you.

778
00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:27,352
I can't do that.

779
00:49:27,354 --> 00:49:30,792
We can't fix things
unless we begin with

780
00:49:31,659 --> 00:49:33,093
your friend.

781
00:49:34,428 --> 00:49:36,161
The person who was here.

782
00:49:36,163 --> 00:49:38,163
Because they're gonna die.
They're in grave danger.

783
00:49:38,465 --> 00:49:40,701
You know that, right?

784
00:49:40,703 --> 00:49:43,201
They're gonna die unless
we bring them back here,

785
00:49:43,203 --> 00:49:45,474
where you can help
to keep them alive.

786
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:50,144
Hey. Dora.

787
00:49:51,746 --> 00:49:54,617
I promise, from here on in,
we will do things differently.

788
00:49:57,853 --> 00:49:59,153
Will you trust me?

789
00:50:06,127 --> 00:50:07,694
Eddie Brock.

790
00:50:07,696 --> 00:50:08,864
- Eddie Brock?
- Mmm-hmm.

791
00:50:18,507 --> 00:50:20,209
You were our best.

792
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,543
Open it.

793
00:50:26,683 --> 00:50:27,882
No! No!

794
00:50:27,884 --> 00:50:29,886
No! No! No!

795
00:50:34,724 --> 00:50:36,493
<i>Do not open that door.</i>

796
00:50:38,128 --> 00:50:39,326
Huh?

797
00:50:51,808 --> 00:50:53,876
Stay put.

798
00:50:53,878 --> 00:50:55,744
- Hey, Eddie.
<i>- Who the hell is this guy?</i>

799
00:50:55,746 --> 00:50:57,948
I'm gonna need
Mr. Drake's property back.

800
00:50:58,214 --> 00:50:59,882
Whoa.

801
00:50:59,884 --> 00:51:02,651
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- I'm, uh...

802
00:51:02,653 --> 00:51:04,352
I'm putting my hands up.

803
00:51:04,354 --> 00:51:06,655
<i>You are making us
look bad.</i>

804
00:51:06,657 --> 00:51:09,625
I...
No, I am not.

805
00:51:09,627 --> 00:51:10,928
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

806
00:51:11,162 --> 00:51:12,561
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Yes, you are!</i>

807
00:51:12,563 --> 00:51:14,263
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Why would you do that?</i>

808
00:51:14,265 --> 00:51:16,264
'Cause it is
a very sensible thing to do.

809
00:51:16,266 --> 00:51:18,466
- Eddie...
<i>- I will take care of this myself.</i>

810
00:51:18,468 --> 00:51:20,368
- What?
- Eddie, where's the bug?

811
00:51:22,174 --> 00:51:23,174
Take him down.

812
00:51:34,351 --> 00:51:35,754
I'm so sorry
about your friends.

813
00:51:44,296 --> 00:51:46,965
- What is that?
<i>- Not "what." Who.</i>

814
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:49,801
Oh.

815
00:51:59,311 --> 00:52:00,312
Shit.

816
00:52:22,235 --> 00:52:24,568
<i>Outstanding.</i>

817
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:26,604
<i>Now let's bite all their heads off
and pile them up in the corner.</i>

818
00:52:26,606 --> 00:52:27,705
Why would we do that?

819
00:52:27,707 --> 00:52:30,511
<i>Pile of bodies, pile of heads.</i>

820
00:52:37,751 --> 00:52:39,352
What the shit, man?

821
00:52:45,025 --> 00:52:46,960
No! No, no, no!

822
00:52:53,735 --> 00:52:55,767
- What the hell?
- Dude! How did you do that?

823
00:52:55,769 --> 00:52:58,038
Apparently, I have a parasite.

824
00:53:06,714 --> 00:53:09,050
Mr. Drake, our subject
is carrying the Symbiote.

825
00:53:09,284 --> 00:53:10,718
<i>Connecting you
to the feed now.</i>

826
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:17,590
He's achieved symbiosis.

827
00:53:17,592 --> 00:53:19,026
Are you seeing this?

828
00:53:19,028 --> 00:53:21,029
Are you seeing this?
He's achieved symbiosis!

829
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:24,030
Treece...

830
00:53:24,032 --> 00:53:26,035
Treece, bring me back
my creature.

831
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,744
<i>Eddie.</i>

832
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,788
You're not even here, are you?
I'm just seeing things.

833
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,890
It's not real.
You're in my head.

834
00:53:49,892 --> 00:53:51,458
'Cause you're just a parasite.

835
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,495
"Parasite"?

836
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,771
You have a brain tumor, Eddie.

837
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:07,742
I got him. He's in the alley
behind the Schueller Building.

838
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,544
I am sorry that I
called you a parasite.

839
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,946
We can discuss this
like two men.

840
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,449
What is that? What is that?

841
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:23,959
What?

842
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:26,426
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me, Treece?

843
00:54:26,428 --> 00:54:28,963
<i>Copy.
Weapons are armed and ready.</i>

844
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:30,066
Launch the drones.

845
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,563
<i>Duck.</i>

846
00:55:02,935 --> 00:55:04,567
Whew!

847
00:55:04,569 --> 00:55:06,471
- Thank you.
<i>- You are welcome.</i>

848
00:55:12,511 --> 00:55:14,680
Oh!

849
00:55:22,821 --> 00:55:25,301
This is beyond
anything we thought was possible.

850
00:55:32,031 --> 00:55:33,765
Oh, God, no!

851
00:55:55,989 --> 00:55:57,788
Holy shit!

852
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:07,065
Treece, do not
let him get away.

853
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:09,536
I've got him.
All ground vehicles, move in.

854
00:56:15,641 --> 00:56:17,778
Target is now eastbound
on Grant.

855
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:20,581
Oh, God! Do something!

856
00:56:28,122 --> 00:56:29,123
What the...

857
00:56:35,797 --> 00:56:38,099
Oh, yeah! We got more friends.
Awesome.

858
00:56:42,269 --> 00:56:43,270
No, no, no! No, no!

859
00:56:46,641 --> 00:56:47,761
No! You're out of your mind!

860
00:56:49,711 --> 00:56:52,047
No!

861
00:57:11,901 --> 00:57:13,869
- That is a dead-end!
<i>- Not for us.</i>

862
00:57:15,571 --> 00:57:17,673
Whoa!

863
00:57:23,846 --> 00:57:24,847
Yeah!

864
00:57:54,811 --> 00:57:55,979
Whoa!

865
00:58:02,819 --> 00:58:04,252
I am going to die!

866
00:58:04,254 --> 00:58:05,690
<i>You are not
going to die!</i>

867
00:58:17,768 --> 00:58:20,071
Whoa! That was pretty cool,
actually. I'm not gonna lie...

868
00:58:29,615 --> 00:58:30,880
I got him.

869
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:31,947
<i>- Bring him home.</i>
- Copy that.

870
00:58:31,949 --> 00:58:33,885
This is incredible.

871
00:58:40,191 --> 00:58:43,093
You have been a serious
pain in the ass for me, Eddie.

872
00:58:43,095 --> 00:58:46,131
Well, you know,
I aim to please.

873
00:58:57,943 --> 00:59:01,912
Eyes, lungs, pancreas.

874
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:04,383
So many snacks,
so little time.

875
00:59:15,028 --> 00:59:16,960
SFPD. Don't move!

876
00:59:16,962 --> 00:59:18,130
Get off the car!

877
00:59:34,914 --> 00:59:35,950
My legs.

878
00:59:38,219 --> 00:59:40,084
Oh, my God,
my legs were broken.

879
00:59:40,086 --> 00:59:42,489
Now they're not broken.
What is happening?

880
00:59:57,838 --> 00:59:59,771
What the hell
are you?

881
00:59:59,773 --> 01:00:02,241
I am Venom.

882
01:00:02,243 --> 01:00:05,010
And you are mine.

883
01:00:05,012 --> 01:00:07,379
You bit somebody's head off.

884
01:00:07,381 --> 01:00:09,449
Fuel in the tank.

885
01:00:09,451 --> 01:00:11,486
Listen carefully, Eddie.

886
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:13,953
You did not find us.

887
01:00:13,955 --> 01:00:16,525
We found you.

888
01:00:16,758 --> 01:00:18,791
Think of yourself
as my ride.

889
01:00:18,793 --> 01:00:20,059
Where are you going?

890
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:23,162
We need
Carlton Drake's rocket.

891
01:00:23,164 --> 01:00:25,131
You remember him.

892
01:00:25,133 --> 01:00:26,532
How do you even know
about that?

893
01:00:26,534 --> 01:00:29,035
- I know everything, Eddie.
- You do?

894
01:00:29,037 --> 01:00:30,870
- Everything about you.
- How?

895
01:00:30,872 --> 01:00:33,306
I am inside your head.

896
01:00:33,308 --> 01:00:35,876
You are a loser, Eddie.

897
01:00:40,448 --> 01:00:43,217
Are you gonna eat
anybody else?

898
01:00:43,219 --> 01:00:44,518
Most likely.

899
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,985
Oh, God.

900
01:00:45,987 --> 01:00:48,989
That is why we are here.

901
01:00:48,991 --> 01:00:52,295
Cooperate,
and you might just survive.

902
01:00:53,462 --> 01:00:55,565
That is the deal.

903
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:00,401
<i>Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

904
01:01:00,403 --> 01:01:02,303
<i>Welcome to San Francisco.</i>

905
01:01:02,305 --> 01:01:04,345
<i>For your safety and comfort,
please remain seated...</i>

906
01:01:25,261 --> 01:01:27,028
Hey, babe. I'm almost home.

907
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:28,862
<i>- Where's Eddie?</i>
- Why? What's happening?

908
01:01:28,864 --> 01:01:30,934
I got Eddie's labs back,

909
01:01:32,336 --> 01:01:34,269
and it's worse than I thought.

910
01:01:34,271 --> 01:01:37,439
His systems, renal, endocrine,
they're behaving abnormally.

911
01:01:37,441 --> 01:01:39,174
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

912
01:01:39,176 --> 01:01:40,975
What does that mean, Dan?
What are you telling me?

913
01:01:40,977 --> 01:01:42,613
- You need to get him here.
- <i>My God.</i>

914
01:01:46,585 --> 01:01:48,418
- <i>Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.</i>
- Shit.

915
01:01:54,959 --> 01:01:58,294
Where were you when
it left Dr. Skirth's body?

916
01:01:58,296 --> 01:02:00,463
- Where was he?
- I was...

917
01:02:00,465 --> 01:02:04,470
This is the higher life-form. You
stood by and watched while it died.

918
01:02:05,504 --> 01:02:06,538
The arrogance.

919
01:02:12,276 --> 01:02:16,514
Treece, listen to me. After this,
we can't risk killing Brock,

920
01:02:16,516 --> 01:02:18,650
not until we find
another suitable host.

921
01:02:18,884 --> 01:02:23,285
I don't want to see you again
unless you have Brock!

922
01:02:27,993 --> 01:02:30,293
Officer, what's happening?
I need to get in there.

923
01:02:30,295 --> 01:02:32,396
- It's my friend's apartment.
- Building's been evacuated.

924
01:02:32,398 --> 01:02:33,463
It's not safe for you
to be here, ma'am.

925
01:02:33,465 --> 01:02:35,399
Found another one, Bill.

926
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:37,300
Get off the streets.
Go home.

927
01:02:37,302 --> 01:02:39,002
There's bodies
all over the city tonight.

928
01:02:39,004 --> 01:02:40,038
Bodies?

929
01:02:41,474 --> 01:02:43,442
My God, Eddie,
where are you?

930
01:02:46,445 --> 01:02:48,412
<i>Who is Anne?
Your pulse has quickened.</i>

931
01:02:48,414 --> 01:02:50,348
That is none of your
goddamn business.

932
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,686
<i>Everything of yours
is my business, Eddie.</i>

933
01:02:52,918 --> 01:02:54,485
<i>We have no secrets.</i>

934
01:02:54,487 --> 01:02:56,120
Yeah? Well, then you know
exactly why I'm going here

935
01:02:56,122 --> 01:02:57,623
before we get to your rocket,
huh?

936
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:01,159
<i>Sure.
I'm not unreasonable.</i>

937
01:03:01,161 --> 01:03:02,960
Shit. Yeah?

938
01:03:02,962 --> 01:03:04,906
Eddie. Thank God. Where are you?
I need to see you.

939
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:06,665
No, no, you can't see me.

940
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:08,966
Eddie, I need you to tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

941
01:03:08,968 --> 01:03:10,536
No, you cannot come
anywhere near me.

942
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:13,105
You cannot come
near me right now.

943
01:03:13,107 --> 01:03:14,707
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
<i>- No!</i>

944
01:03:14,909 --> 01:03:16,407
- Eddie?
<i>- No, I gotta go up there.</i>

945
01:03:16,409 --> 01:03:17,442
You know you're not
supposed to be here, Eddie.

946
01:03:17,444 --> 01:03:18,712
I got to get up there, man.

947
01:03:18,946 --> 01:03:21,012
Look, I got love for you, bro,
but no can do.

948
01:03:21,014 --> 01:03:22,381
There's no such thing
as can't.

949
01:03:22,383 --> 01:03:23,552
I'm sorry, man.

950
01:03:24,485 --> 01:03:26,985
Okay, okay... Uh...

951
01:03:26,987 --> 01:03:29,288
Can you, uh,
just give him this?

952
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:32,224
- He needs to see what's on it.
- Eddie, please. I really need this job.

953
01:03:32,226 --> 01:03:34,527
<i>- Let's eat his brains.</i>
- No! You do not touch him!

954
01:03:34,529 --> 01:03:36,529
- He is my friend.
- What's wrong with you?

955
01:03:36,531 --> 01:03:38,598
He works three jobs just so
that he can support his family.

956
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,098
- Eddie, what's going on?
- We're leaving.

957
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,634
<i>- "We"?</i>
- Yeah.

958
01:03:41,636 --> 01:03:43,716
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

959
01:03:45,406 --> 01:03:47,241
Yeah.

960
01:03:53,113 --> 01:03:55,550
- Shit.
<i>- You want up?</i>

961
01:03:59,321 --> 01:04:01,657
<i>Well, why didn't you just say?</i>

962
01:04:12,467 --> 01:04:14,770
Hmm.

963
01:04:15,003 --> 01:04:18,204
- It is peaceful up here.
<i>- I'm not very good with heights.</i>

964
01:04:18,206 --> 01:04:22,409
Your world is not so ugly
after all.

965
01:04:22,411 --> 01:04:24,748
I'm almost sorry
to see it end.

966
01:04:24,982 --> 01:04:26,146
<i>What does that mean?</i>

967
01:04:34,423 --> 01:04:36,122
Where'd you go?
Where did you go?

968
01:04:47,036 --> 01:04:48,435
<i>I got us.</i>

969
01:04:48,437 --> 01:04:49,540
Whoa.

970
01:04:55,013 --> 01:04:58,581
Again?
You're gonna get me killed.

971
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:00,716
<i>You die, I die.</i>

972
01:05:00,718 --> 01:05:03,118
Yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

973
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,621
and exchange it for another
one whenever you need.

974
01:05:05,623 --> 01:05:07,523
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

975
01:05:07,525 --> 01:05:10,526
<i>You are far too good of a
match to throw away so soon.</i>

976
01:05:10,528 --> 01:05:12,695
<i>Plus, I am starting
to like you.</i>

977
01:05:12,697 --> 01:05:14,164
<i>You and I
are not so different.</i>

978
01:05:14,766 --> 01:05:15,833
Thank you.

979
01:05:19,704 --> 01:05:20,738
Okay.

980
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:24,207
Here's your evidence.

981
01:05:28,145 --> 01:05:29,346
<i>Jump.</i>

982
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,517
<i>Pussy.</i>

983
01:05:43,629 --> 01:05:44,763
Hands!

984
01:05:46,699 --> 01:05:48,433
On the ground! Now!

985
01:05:52,839 --> 01:05:55,672
Guys, you do not want to do this.
Trust me.

986
01:05:55,674 --> 01:05:57,741
- Mask!
- Copy!

987
01:05:57,743 --> 01:06:00,242
All right,
have it your own way.

988
01:06:00,244 --> 01:06:01,881
- Mask!
<i>- Copy.</i>

989
01:06:02,114 --> 01:06:03,648
What the hell
is that thing?

990
01:06:09,254 --> 01:06:10,422
What the hell?

991
01:06:11,658 --> 01:06:13,256
Hold your fire!

992
01:06:13,258 --> 01:06:15,392
Flares!

993
01:06:15,394 --> 01:06:16,494
He's there!
He's there!

994
01:06:16,496 --> 01:06:17,697
Reload!

995
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:20,531
Anybody see him?

996
01:06:31,443 --> 01:06:33,378
Does anyone have eyes on him?

997
01:06:35,115 --> 01:06:37,217
<i>Switching to
thermal. Seeking target.</i>

998
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:52,564
I don't have
eyes on him.

999
01:06:54,267 --> 01:06:55,335
Where is it?

1000
01:07:02,343 --> 01:07:03,442
Flash grenade!

1001
01:07:04,713 --> 01:07:05,845
Throw them!

1002
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:07,378
Flash grenade!

1003
01:07:18,426 --> 01:07:19,693
He's in the rafters!

1004
01:07:19,695 --> 01:07:20,760
Above!

1005
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:27,234
There he is!

1006
01:07:31,873 --> 01:07:33,308
Move, move, move!

1007
01:08:03,272 --> 01:08:04,972
<i>No! We do not
eat policemen!</i>

1008
01:08:11,347 --> 01:08:12,848
Annie! Annie, wait!

1009
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:14,682
- Wait, please.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

1010
01:08:14,684 --> 01:08:17,351
That's not me.
I've been infected.

1011
01:08:17,353 --> 01:08:19,821
- Eddie, what's happening?
- He's inside me.

1012
01:08:19,823 --> 01:08:21,422
- "He"?
- Yes.

1013
01:08:21,424 --> 01:08:23,859
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- You're sick.

1014
01:08:23,861 --> 01:08:26,563
- Eddie, you're really sick.
- No, I am scared!

1015
01:08:28,932 --> 01:08:31,635
- And I need help.
- Hospital.

1016
01:08:35,404 --> 01:08:36,405
Right now.

1017
01:08:39,611 --> 01:08:42,409
I can't go with you.
It's not safe.

1018
01:08:42,411 --> 01:08:43,480
Get in the car, Eddie.

1019
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:48,653
- In the back.
<i>- I like her. Get in.</i>

1020
01:08:55,727 --> 01:08:57,829
I'm out of control.

1021
01:08:59,497 --> 01:09:00,998
Dan just needs to do
another MRI.

1022
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,834
<i>- No MRI.</i>
- No. No. No MRI.

1023
01:09:03,536 --> 01:09:05,036
What? Why?

1024
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:07,369
<i>Sound at 4,000
to 6,000 hertz is lethal.</i>

1025
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:12,709
Sound frequency in the MRI
is really harmful for him.

1026
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:15,512
What, so, sound
is like his kryptonite?

1027
01:09:15,514 --> 01:09:18,083
- Not all sounds.
<i>- And fire.</i>

1028
01:09:18,315 --> 01:09:21,352
Fire. And fire.
He's talking to you?

1029
01:09:22,955 --> 01:09:24,389
Always.

1030
01:09:25,491 --> 01:09:27,659
- Are you in pain?
- No.

1031
01:09:27,661 --> 01:09:30,359
No, I don't feel anything,
actually, apart from...

1032
01:09:30,361 --> 01:09:32,663
I'm hungry all the time.

1033
01:09:32,665 --> 01:09:36,002
<i>And you feel sad, do you
not, Eddie, when you are with her?</i>

1034
01:09:37,304 --> 01:09:39,002
Get out of my head, man.

1035
01:09:39,004 --> 01:09:41,472
<i>You never apologized.</i>

1036
01:09:41,474 --> 01:09:44,077
<i>You might not live
to get another chance.</i>

1037
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:51,782
Annie.

1038
01:09:51,784 --> 01:09:55,452
I just want to say
that whatever happens,

1039
01:09:55,454 --> 01:10:01,458
that I am truly sorry for whatever...
And everything I have ever done to you.

1040
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,063
I am truly, truly sorry.

1041
01:10:04,463 --> 01:10:06,533
And that I love you.

1042
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:09,734
Oh, Eddie...

1043
01:10:09,736 --> 01:10:12,838
Now's really not the time. Let's
just keep you alive, okay?

1044
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,474
<i>Aw, that's nice.</i>

1045
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:23,582
You know, I'm really wet and
cold. Can I, uh, wear this?

1046
01:10:23,584 --> 01:10:26,785
Yeah, yeah, you can wear
whatever you want.

1047
01:10:26,787 --> 01:10:27,855
Thank you.

1048
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:47,509
Hello?

1049
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,056
What are you doing here?

1050
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:04,761
Are you lost?

1051
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,931
I'm not lost.

1052
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:18,005
Thanks for coming in.

1053
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:21,509
- Eddie, I'm sorry.
- What?

1054
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:24,179
Eddie, I got your labs back, and
your heart has atrophied severely.

1055
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:26,914
<i>Do not listen to him.
I can fix it.</i>

1056
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:28,217
I don't want you to fix it.

1057
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:29,784
<i>I can heal you.</i>

1058
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:33,689
Can you fix it?

1059
01:11:33,691 --> 01:11:35,623
No. I've never seen
anything like this before.

1060
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,825
- This parasite, whatever this is...
<i>- "Parasite"?</i>

1061
01:11:37,827 --> 01:11:39,126
It's eating you
from the inside.

1062
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,762
Not a parasite.
He's not.

1063
01:11:40,764 --> 01:11:42,864
- You're using him up.
<i>- No. She is wrong.</i>

1064
01:11:42,866 --> 01:11:45,900
- We need to get you to the ICU.
- Wait. Shh!

1065
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:48,502
- I, Eddie, am I dying?
<i>- No!</i>

1066
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,105
You're killing him.

1067
01:11:50,107 --> 01:11:51,573
<i>They do not know
what they are talking about.</i>

1068
01:11:51,575 --> 01:11:53,140
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time...

1069
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,702
- Oh, God!
<i>- We have to get out of here.</i>

1070
01:11:56,013 --> 01:11:57,079
- Stop!
- Oh, God, he's killing you.

1071
01:11:57,081 --> 01:11:58,241
I'm killing you.
I'm so sorry.

1072
01:12:00,784 --> 01:12:03,787
No! Don't do that!

1073
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:22,004
Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.

1074
01:12:22,006 --> 01:12:23,274
What is that?

1075
01:12:30,248 --> 01:12:33,216
You were killing me?

1076
01:12:33,218 --> 01:12:36,287
What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?

1077
01:12:38,123 --> 01:12:42,794
Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.

1078
01:12:44,029 --> 01:12:45,163
We're done.

1079
01:12:47,532 --> 01:12:49,900
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere other than here.

1080
01:12:49,902 --> 01:12:51,668
You don't think we have
a little problem on our hands?

1081
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:53,750
Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.

1082
01:12:56,608 --> 01:12:58,142
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1083
01:12:58,144 --> 01:13:02,046
I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,

1084
01:13:02,048 --> 01:13:04,281
but I don't know
much more than you do.

1085
01:13:04,283 --> 01:13:07,252
I guess he had
no one else to turn to.

1086
01:13:07,254 --> 01:13:10,988
He's a very complicated man.
But, Dan, I promise,

1087
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:12,723
there's nothing going on
between me and Eddie.

1088
01:13:12,725 --> 01:13:14,858
I'm not talking
about you and Eddie, Anne.

1089
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:16,128
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

1090
01:13:19,933 --> 01:13:20,933
Dan.

1091
01:13:27,773 --> 01:13:29,008
Where is it?

1092
01:13:54,936 --> 01:13:56,938
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

1093
01:14:23,064 --> 01:14:26,765
You can kill me,
'cause I'm dying anyway.

1094
01:14:26,767 --> 01:14:31,370
I'm not just gonna kill you.
That wouldn't be any fun.

1095
01:14:31,372 --> 01:14:35,410
No, no, no. I'm gonna rip your
tongue out of your face.

1096
01:14:35,644 --> 01:14:37,944
Whoo!

1097
01:14:39,616 --> 01:14:43,284
Stop. You're bleeding
all over my lab. Go. Go!

1098
01:14:52,862 --> 01:14:54,929
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1099
01:14:54,931 --> 01:14:57,964
And you know what? Even if I
did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

1100
01:14:57,966 --> 01:15:01,869
I don't trust you,
and you're insane.

1101
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:03,803
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

1102
01:15:03,805 --> 01:15:05,273
Long journal entry
about that tonight.

1103
01:15:05,275 --> 01:15:07,041
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

1104
01:15:07,043 --> 01:15:10,211
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

1105
01:15:10,213 --> 01:15:12,780
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

1106
01:15:12,782 --> 01:15:14,215
It can't go on.

1107
01:15:14,217 --> 01:15:16,752
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

1108
01:15:16,754 --> 01:15:18,753
We're parasites.
You're a good example.

1109
01:15:18,755 --> 01:15:20,424
Think about it.
All you do is take.

1110
01:15:20,658 --> 01:15:24,358
You took my Symbiote. You
take potshots at a great man

1111
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,161
- trying to get something done.
- Who?

1112
01:15:28,097 --> 01:15:30,364
Didn't you take from the
person you loved the most,

1113
01:15:30,366 --> 01:15:32,868
who trusted you the most?
That's insane.

1114
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:37,372
What I've initiated is a whole
new world, a new species.

1115
01:15:37,374 --> 01:15:39,808
Man and Symbiote combined.

1116
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:42,377
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

1117
01:15:42,379 --> 01:15:45,447
Because I have spent a significant
amount of time, all right,

1118
01:15:45,449 --> 01:15:48,850
with one of these creatures
up my ass.

1119
01:15:48,852 --> 01:15:50,152
It's not a lot of fun.

1120
01:15:50,154 --> 01:15:52,755
And then I find out,
all along,

1121
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:54,157
that they're killing you.

1122
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:55,891
This is the last time
I'm asking you.

1123
01:15:55,893 --> 01:15:58,428
- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.

1124
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:00,964
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God!

1125
01:16:00,966 --> 01:16:02,467
Where's Venom?

1126
01:16:02,701 --> 01:16:06,268
That is the ugliest-looking
thing I have ever seen.

1127
01:16:12,344 --> 01:16:16,145
You know, Brock,
I have no use for you.

1128
01:16:16,147 --> 01:16:18,815
Treece! Come and clean up
your mess.

1129
01:16:18,817 --> 01:16:23,052
Whoa, he has one
up his ass, too.

1130
01:16:31,297 --> 01:16:36,503
Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.

1131
01:16:36,737 --> 01:16:40,137
There are more of us.
Millions more.

1132
01:16:40,139 --> 01:16:42,341
They will follow
wherever I lead.

1133
01:16:44,377 --> 01:16:46,143
Where we lead.

1134
01:16:46,145 --> 01:16:47,878
Yes, "we."

1135
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,150
But first,
we must retrieve them.

1136
01:16:52,519 --> 01:16:54,087
I can take care of that.

1137
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:02,127
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?

1138
01:17:02,129 --> 01:17:03,130
Shut up.

1139
01:17:06,967 --> 01:17:08,569
Not so tough
without your friend.

1140
01:17:13,474 --> 01:17:15,142
Did your mama not love you?

1141
01:17:18,046 --> 01:17:19,512
God damn it!

1142
01:17:21,381 --> 01:17:24,550
I guess it
pays to be a specialist, huh?

1143
01:17:24,552 --> 01:17:26,553
You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,

1144
01:17:26,555 --> 01:17:28,320
because there's something
way bigger afoot

1145
01:17:28,322 --> 01:17:29,522
in this world than you and me.

1146
01:17:30,324 --> 01:17:32,559
Much bigger than me.

1147
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:37,065
And it's much,
much bigger than you.

1148
01:17:39,434 --> 01:17:41,267
Karma's a bitch.

1149
01:17:41,269 --> 01:17:42,504
I don't believe in karma.

1150
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:46,240
Oh! Ooh!

1151
01:17:50,945 --> 01:17:52,011
Hi, Eddie.

1152
01:17:52,013 --> 01:17:54,047
Whoa. Whoa...

1153
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:56,882
Oh...

1154
01:17:56,884 --> 01:17:57,885
Mmm...

1155
01:17:58,921 --> 01:18:00,122
Mmm!

1156
01:18:16,372 --> 01:18:17,540
Oh, no.

1157
01:18:19,141 --> 01:18:21,542
I just bit
that guy's head off.

1158
01:18:21,544 --> 01:18:24,045
I know, I know. I've been there, too.
It's not fun.

1159
01:18:24,047 --> 01:18:26,649
<i>- The one with Drake is Riot.</i>
- Who's Riot?

1160
01:18:26,882 --> 01:18:29,383
<i>Riot is what you would call
a team leader.</i>

1161
01:18:29,385 --> 01:18:31,451
<i>He has an arsenal of weapons.</i>

1162
01:18:31,453 --> 01:18:33,773
- Drake's got his own Symbiote.
<i>- He is unstoppable.</i>

1163
01:18:33,889 --> 01:18:35,455
- Oh, great.
<i>- We have got to go!</i>

1164
01:18:35,457 --> 01:18:37,158
Go where? Where we going?

1165
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,594
- Well, I'm coming with you.
<i>- No!</i>

1166
01:18:38,596 --> 01:18:40,496
<i>It's going to get ugly.</i>

1167
01:18:40,498 --> 01:18:42,978
- Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.
- Yeah, I can fight ugly.

1168
01:18:44,367 --> 01:18:45,935
Not today.

1169
01:18:47,404 --> 01:18:49,005
Oh, that's bullshit!

1170
01:18:51,174 --> 01:18:52,676
This is not a simulation.

1171
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:55,076
Well, the flight team
aren't prepped yet.

1172
01:18:55,078 --> 01:18:57,514
I'll be piloting
the spacecraft.

1173
01:18:57,516 --> 01:18:59,247
- You?
- Yes, me.

1174
01:18:59,249 --> 01:19:00,949
How long?

1175
01:19:00,951 --> 01:19:02,651
We're loading the probe
and running diagnostics.

1176
01:19:02,653 --> 01:19:06,023
But even fully automated, you
can't pilot that craft all alone.

1177
01:19:08,259 --> 01:19:09,360
I'm not alone.

1178
01:19:12,997 --> 01:19:16,298
God damn it! What the hell
happened there? We just left Annie.

1179
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,267
<i>It is not safe for her.</i>

1180
01:19:18,269 --> 01:19:19,671
<i>If we do not stop Riot,</i>

1181
01:19:19,905 --> 01:19:23,305
<i>he will come back here
with millions more of my kind.</i>

1182
01:19:23,307 --> 01:19:27,678
Millions? What, you were
gonna take the rocket,

1183
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,920
and you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

1184
01:19:29,948 --> 01:19:31,648
Then what were you gonna do,
you were gonna go feed

1185
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:33,416
- on a whole planet?
<i>- Yes!</i>

1186
01:19:33,418 --> 01:19:35,619
<i>But it is
different now, Eddie.</i>

1187
01:19:35,621 --> 01:19:38,188
- <i>I have decided to stay.</i>
- Wow!

1188
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:41,223
<i>On my planet, I am
kind of a loser, like you.</i>

1189
01:19:41,225 --> 01:19:43,729
- <i>But here, we could be more.</i>
- Excuse me?

1190
01:19:43,962 --> 01:19:45,696
<i>And I'm getting to
like it here.</i>

1191
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:48,364
Oh, you like us now,
do you, huh?

1192
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:51,000
<i>However, there will be nothing left to
like if we do not stop that rocket.</i>

1193
01:19:51,002 --> 01:19:54,740
Oh, I see. Right. When it comes
to being completely annihilated,

1194
01:19:55,006 --> 01:19:57,106
- then it's back to "we."
<i>- It is "we."</i>

1195
01:19:57,108 --> 01:19:59,510
<i>Like it or not, it is
going to take both of us.</i>

1196
01:19:59,512 --> 01:20:01,212
Hey, come on, man.
Cut the bullshit.

1197
01:20:01,214 --> 01:20:02,694
What really made you
change your mind?

1198
01:20:06,486 --> 01:20:09,455
You. You did, Eddie.

1199
01:20:11,457 --> 01:20:14,124
Scrub diagnostics.

1200
01:20:14,126 --> 01:20:16,497
- Sir?
- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch.

1201
01:20:23,202 --> 01:20:26,270
<i>T-minus
five minutes to launch.</i>

1202
01:20:26,272 --> 01:20:28,609
<i>Auto sequence has been
initiated.</i>

1203
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,690
Oh, shit.

1204
01:20:52,266 --> 01:20:55,202
<i>T-minus
four minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1205
01:21:02,677 --> 01:21:06,444
<i>Oh, Jesus!
You can take this guy, right?</i>

1206
01:21:06,446 --> 01:21:09,147
He has got shit
you have never seen.

1207
01:21:09,149 --> 01:21:11,249
<i>What does that mean?
What are our chances?</i>

1208
01:21:11,251 --> 01:21:14,687
Hmm. Pretty much zero.

1209
01:21:14,689 --> 01:21:17,593
<i>Oh, fuck it. Well,
let's go save the planet.</i>

1210
01:21:20,596 --> 01:21:22,698
<i>T-minus four minutes.</i>

1211
01:21:26,401 --> 01:21:29,203
<i>Initiate orbiter
aerosurface profile.</i>

1212
01:21:32,475 --> 01:21:35,308
Venom. Get in the rocket.

1213
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:39,446
No. We won't let you destroy
this world.

1214
01:21:39,448 --> 01:21:40,782
Then die.

1215
01:21:51,528 --> 01:21:53,528
<i>- Holy shit!</i>
- Told you.

1216
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:55,164
<i>T-minus three minutes.</i>

1217
01:22:07,611 --> 01:22:09,144
You have a strong host.

1218
01:22:11,413 --> 01:22:12,749
But not strong enough.

1219
01:22:51,523 --> 01:22:54,255
<i>T-minus
two minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1220
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:57,596
Eddie.

1221
01:23:02,134 --> 01:23:03,502
Drake, stop!

1222
01:24:09,771 --> 01:24:12,239
Told you I could fight ugly.

1223
01:24:19,379 --> 01:24:21,683
<i>T-minus one minute.</i>

1224
01:24:39,668 --> 01:24:41,366
You're too late.

1225
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:42,369
This is the next stage...

1226
01:24:44,439 --> 01:24:46,675
You talk too much.

1227
01:24:56,284 --> 01:24:58,019
<i>T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

1228
01:24:58,254 --> 01:24:59,889
You are nothing.

1229
01:25:28,552 --> 01:25:29,853
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

1230
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:31,755
<i>Nine...</i>

1231
01:25:32,589 --> 01:25:33,657
<i>Eight...</i>

1232
01:25:34,591 --> 01:25:35,592
<i>Seven...</i>

1233
01:25:36,358 --> 01:25:37,359
<i>Six...</i>

1234
01:25:37,894 --> 01:25:38,929
<i>Five...</i>

1235
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:41,361
<i>Four...</i>

1236
01:25:41,363 --> 01:25:42,897
<i>Three...</i>

1237
01:25:42,899 --> 01:25:44,766
<i>Two...</i>

1238
01:25:44,768 --> 01:25:46,771
<i>One...</i>

1239
01:25:48,572 --> 01:25:49,739
<i>Liftoff.</i>

1240
01:25:57,081 --> 01:25:58,714
Traitor!

1241
01:25:58,716 --> 01:26:00,483
Have a nice life.

1242
01:26:26,777 --> 01:26:28,145
<i>Goodbye, Eddie.</i>

1243
01:26:29,413 --> 01:26:30,849
Venom, no!

1244
01:27:18,898 --> 01:27:22,868
Thanks for sticking by me, Annie.
Thanks for saving me.

1245
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:24,467
So, how you feeling
after all that?

1246
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:26,206
I feel great. Awesome.

1247
01:27:26,439 --> 01:27:28,207
Wow.

1248
01:27:28,441 --> 01:27:30,108
Yeah, I'm thinking of suing, though.
You want to prosecute?

1249
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:33,612
Hmm. You're in luck. I've
decided to work pro bono.

1250
01:27:33,614 --> 01:27:35,614
I'm joining
the public defenders' office.

1251
01:27:35,616 --> 01:27:37,581
You're a good person, Annie.

1252
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:39,084
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

1253
01:27:39,086 --> 01:27:40,919
Uh, the network asked me
to bring the show back,

1254
01:27:40,921 --> 01:27:42,955
and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.

1255
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:45,057
Oh, wow, really?
So, what did you say?

1256
01:27:45,059 --> 01:27:49,495
Uh, I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.

1257
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:51,597
I scored the interview
of a lifetime.

1258
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:53,933
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.

1259
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,569
Oh! Like everyone else.

1260
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:57,572
Yeah.

1261
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:02,243
Hey, I'm sorry about Venom.

1262
01:28:03,944 --> 01:28:05,145
Hey, um...

1263
01:28:07,816 --> 01:28:09,649
Do you want to talk
about that kiss?

1264
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:12,854
Oh, that? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...

1265
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:18,225
Uh, that was your
buddy's idea.

1266
01:28:18,227 --> 01:28:20,629
Oh, right. Well,
that is good to know.

1267
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,501
- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?

1268
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,568
I mean, the...

1269
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:31,105
- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...

1270
01:28:31,107 --> 01:28:32,673
- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.

1271
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:33,776
Okay.

1272
01:28:35,077 --> 01:28:36,677
- Hey, Eddie?
- Mmm-hmm?

1273
01:28:36,679 --> 01:28:38,912
We're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?

1274
01:28:38,914 --> 01:28:42,649
<i>Look at her. She has no
idea we are going to get her back.</i>

1275
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:45,586
No, I don't think so.

1276
01:28:45,588 --> 01:28:48,055
- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.

1277
01:28:48,057 --> 01:28:49,857
Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?

1278
01:28:49,859 --> 01:28:52,261
- Nope.
<i>- You belong with us, Annie.</i>

1279
01:28:52,496 --> 01:28:54,029
Eddie, are you sure?

1280
01:28:54,031 --> 01:28:56,030
Good Lord, look at that.

1281
01:28:56,032 --> 01:28:58,167
- Look at the time.
- I have to go.

1282
01:28:59,936 --> 01:29:02,103
- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

1283
01:29:02,105 --> 01:29:04,240
You take care, all right?

1284
01:29:04,509 --> 01:29:06,309
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.

1285
01:29:10,247 --> 01:29:13,681
Hey. Don't give up on her.

1286
01:29:13,683 --> 01:29:14,851
Either of you.

1287
01:29:15,585 --> 01:29:16,951
We won't.

1288
01:29:16,953 --> 01:29:18,653
<i>- Who is that guy?</i>
- Okay.

1289
01:29:18,655 --> 01:29:21,222
<i>Wait.
This thing looks delicious.</i>

1290
01:29:21,224 --> 01:29:23,892
I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,

1291
01:29:23,894 --> 01:29:26,828
but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?

1292
01:29:26,830 --> 01:29:30,598
You cannot just go around eating
anybody that you want to.

1293
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,336
<i>- I cannot?</i>
- No, you cannot.

1294
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:34,269
All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.

1295
01:29:34,271 --> 01:29:37,840
There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

1296
01:29:37,842 --> 01:29:40,142
And then there are bad people.

1297
01:29:40,144 --> 01:29:42,011
You have to tell
the difference.

1298
01:29:42,013 --> 01:29:45,881
The deal is, you will only
ever be allowed to touch,

1299
01:29:45,883 --> 01:29:49,251
harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,

1300
01:29:49,253 --> 01:29:51,687
eat very, very bad people,

1301
01:29:51,689 --> 01:29:54,358
but never, ever,
ever good people. All right?

1302
01:29:54,592 --> 01:29:56,959
<i>- Fine.</i>
- Good.

1303
01:29:56,961 --> 01:29:58,728
<i>But how does one
tell the difference?</i>

1304
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:00,830
Well, it's super simple.

1305
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:03,733
I mean, you just have to... You
can intuit it, you can sense it.

1306
01:30:03,735 --> 01:30:05,802
Sometimes you can
even feel it.

1307
01:30:05,804 --> 01:30:07,237
<i>Whatever you say.</i>

1308
01:30:07,239 --> 01:30:09,306
<i>But can we get something to
eat now?</i>

1309
01:30:09,308 --> 01:30:14,743
<i>Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.</i>

1310
01:30:14,745 --> 01:30:17,049
Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.

1311
01:30:18,617 --> 01:30:20,919
Hey, Mrs. C.

1312
01:30:21,987 --> 01:30:23,687
How you doing, Eddie?

1313
01:30:23,689 --> 01:30:25,256
Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.

1314
01:30:25,258 --> 01:30:28,225
No.

1315
01:30:28,227 --> 01:30:31,364
So, what culinary delights will
tickle the pickle tonight?

1316
01:30:31,598 --> 01:30:33,263
<i>Tater tots
and chocolate.</i>

1317
01:30:33,265 --> 01:30:34,932
Right. Okay, no problem.

1318
01:30:36,202 --> 01:30:37,769
The payment's due, Chen.

1319
01:30:39,272 --> 01:30:41,271
Please.
I can't keep doing this.

1320
01:30:41,273 --> 01:30:42,840
Now.

1321
01:30:42,842 --> 01:30:44,410
<i>- Bad guy, right?</i>
- Yep.

1322
01:30:51,951 --> 01:30:54,018
You come in here again...

1323
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:58,689
In fact, you go anywhere in this
city, preying on innocent people,

1324
01:30:58,691 --> 01:31:02,193
and we will find you
and eat both your arms

1325
01:31:02,195 --> 01:31:04,195
- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.

1326
01:31:04,197 --> 01:31:07,266
And then we will eat your face right
off your head. Do you understand?

1327
01:31:07,268 --> 01:31:09,168
- Please...
- Yes.

1328
01:31:09,170 --> 01:31:13,071
So, you will be this armless,
legless, faceless thing, won't you,

1329
01:31:13,073 --> 01:31:17,843
rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?

1330
01:31:17,845 --> 01:31:20,214
- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?

1331
01:31:22,116 --> 01:31:24,685
We are Venom.

1332
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:28,289
- On second thought...
- Please.

1333
01:31:35,362 --> 01:31:37,763
Eddie? What was that?

1334
01:31:37,765 --> 01:31:39,164
Oh...

1335
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:42,971
I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. Chen.

1336
01:31:44,306 --> 01:31:45,838
<i>- "Parasite"?</i>
- Yeah.

1337
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,840
It's a term of endearment,
that's all.

1338
01:31:47,842 --> 01:31:49,842
<i>- Apologize!</i>
- No.

1339
01:31:49,844 --> 01:31:52,779
<i>- Apologize!</i>
- All right, fine.

1340
01:31:52,781 --> 01:31:55,485
I'm sorry. So, what do you
want to do now?

1341
01:31:55,717 --> 01:31:59,852
<i>The way I see it,
we can do whatever we want.</i>

1342
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:29,073
I need you
to stay quiet.

1343
01:34:29,075 --> 01:34:32,043
This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.

1344
01:34:32,045 --> 01:34:35,181
- You got that?
<i>- Fine, but make it quick.</i>

1345
01:34:39,521 --> 01:34:41,086
Open on five.

1346
01:34:41,088 --> 01:34:44,223
Go. Opening up.

1347
01:34:46,292 --> 01:34:48,994
You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.

1348
01:34:48,996 --> 01:34:51,531
Second he asked
for you to interview him,

1349
01:34:51,533 --> 01:34:53,264
I'd have shut that
shit down.

1350
01:34:53,266 --> 01:34:55,434
Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage

1351
01:34:55,436 --> 01:34:58,070
of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.

1352
01:34:58,072 --> 01:35:01,206
They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.

1353
01:35:01,208 --> 01:35:04,646
FBI don't work up close
and personal with him.

1354
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,349
The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.

1355
01:35:11,419 --> 01:35:14,322
Hey, Red!
I got a visitor for you.

1356
01:35:34,477 --> 01:35:37,110
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

1357
01:35:37,112 --> 01:35:41,549
Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?

1358
01:35:41,551 --> 01:35:42,718
Sure, it's good with me.

1359
01:35:42,951 --> 01:35:45,285
I mean, I can turn it on
if you want.

1360
01:35:45,287 --> 01:35:52,158
I can talk about the Dadaist
patterns of arterial spray.

1361
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,228
I bet you can.

1362
01:35:54,230 --> 01:35:56,700
Tough to see you
in this light, Eddie.

1363
01:35:57,534 --> 01:35:58,569
Come on over.

1364
01:35:59,536 --> 01:36:01,003
All right.

1365
01:36:06,042 --> 01:36:07,341
I'm here.

1366
01:36:07,343 --> 01:36:11,079
When I get out of here,
and I will,

1367
01:36:12,415 --> 01:36:14,384
there's gonna be carnage.

1368
01:48:24,905 --> 01:48:27,073
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

1369
01:48:28,775 --> 01:48:30,842
I want to do what you asked.

1370
01:48:30,844 --> 01:48:32,478
I really do.

1371
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,779
But... I'm sorry.

1372
01:48:39,052 --> 01:48:41,453
I can't do this without you.

1373
01:48:42,923 --> 01:48:43,989
Hey, kid...

1374
01:48:43,991 --> 01:48:45,290
Whoa.

1375
01:48:45,292 --> 01:48:46,293
What was... Whoa!

1376
01:48:50,163 --> 01:48:51,164
What?

1377
01:48:53,201 --> 01:48:54,235
Huh?

1378
01:49:02,844 --> 01:49:03,845
No.

1379
01:49:08,116 --> 01:49:10,050
Who are you?

1380
01:49:10,052 --> 01:49:11,412
What are you
doing over there?

1381
01:49:12,288 --> 01:49:14,220
Freeze! PDNY.

1382
01:49:14,222 --> 01:49:16,222
Kid, freeze!

1383
01:49:19,861 --> 01:49:20,995
You're kidding me right now?

1384
01:49:23,065 --> 01:49:24,466
Hey, kid.
Drop the body.

1385
01:49:33,476 --> 01:49:34,875
Ow!

1386
01:49:34,877 --> 01:49:36,078
Somebody stop that train!

1387
01:49:48,525 --> 01:49:49,593
Aah!

1388
01:49:58,536 --> 01:50:00,034
Sorry.

1389
01:50:09,145 --> 01:50:11,513
<i>...looks like
a child dressed like Spider-Man,</i>

1390
01:50:11,515 --> 01:50:13,047
<i>dragging a homeless corpse</i>

1391
01:50:13,049 --> 01:50:14,349
<i>behind a train.</i>

1392
01:50:14,351 --> 01:50:15,797
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1393
01:50:15,821 --> 01:50:17,152
Why are you
trying to kill me?

1394
01:50:17,154 --> 01:50:18,554
I'm not.
I'm trying to save you.

1395
01:50:38,175 --> 01:50:41,377
Hey, maybe you guys
can go around?

1396
01:50:41,379 --> 01:50:43,914
All right.
Thanks, New York.
