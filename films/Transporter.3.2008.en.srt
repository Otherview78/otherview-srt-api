1
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:06,265
Ninety-one, 92...

2
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,938
- It's down there.
- Where? If they catch us...

3
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,107
There's a million bottles
of booze in there.

4
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:12,707
You think they're
gonna miss one?

5
00:02:28,058 --> 00:02:30,151
Weather is with us, sir.

6
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:33,724
We arrive in port in a couple of hours.

7
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:35,489
Very good.

8
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:37,462
You're welcome, sir.

9
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,469
Man, I never smelt anything like this.
Not even when you're in the crapper.

10
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:49,908
Oh, what, your shit smells like roses?

11
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:51,410
Hey, look.

12
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:54,380
I'll give you a hand.

13
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:04,082
- Thought you said it was booze.
- That's what the papers said.

14
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:11,261
Captain, we have a breach
in lower level. Look.

15
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:13,026
- Which section?
- 101.

16
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:15,201
Fuck. Take the wheel.

17
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:16,804
- Yes, sir.
- Fuck.

18
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:21,071
Close the door! Get the masks.

19
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:29,444
Holy shit.

20
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,111
Take care of them.

21
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,295
- Morning.
- Passport, please.

22
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:25,964
Rough seas?

23
00:04:26,576 --> 00:04:29,841
The sea was smooth. The party was
a bit rough, if you know what I mean.

24
00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:31,571
- Ibiza.
- Yeah.

25
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:33,215
Thanks.

26
00:04:43,827 --> 00:04:46,625
When I was a kid,
my father used to take me fishing.

27
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,061
Never could figure out how he knew
where the fish were.

28
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:54,637
They were always exactly
where he said they would be.

29
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:20,794
Security check.

30
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:22,790
Do I look like a security risk?

31
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,126
Please step out of the car and bring
your documents to the office.

32
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:28,562
My documents are right here, sir.

33
00:05:28,772 --> 00:05:30,899
The computer is in the office.

34
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:33,636
Her too.

35
00:05:33,844 --> 00:05:35,505
She's sleeping.

36
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:38,476
- With her documents.
- Okay, sure.

37
00:05:53,397 --> 00:05:54,523
You're gonna lose it.

38
00:05:59,036 --> 00:06:00,731
Close, inspector, you're close.

39
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:07,543
That's a big one. Go left, go left.

40
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:11,910
Don't let him get away.

41
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:17,848
You're close.

42
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:24,716
Go left, go left! Go right!

43
00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:30,626
Must be Moby Dick you hooked.
Need some help?

44
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:31,892
No, thank you, Frank.

45
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:36,467
I have been fishing these waters
since before you were born.

46
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:45,246
You were close, inspector.
You were close.

47
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:52,482
Good thing that we French have such
a highly developed sense of humor.

48
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:56,224
With all due respect, the French
think Jerry Lewis is a genius.

49
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:59,554
- Jerry Lewis is a genius.
- Dean was the genius.

50
00:06:59,763 --> 00:07:02,823
No, Dean just stood there
with a drink and a cigarette.

51
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:06,002
My point exactly.
Anyone can fall down and get a laugh.

52
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:09,434
How many people can do it standing
still with a drink and a cigarette?

53
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,181
I am afraid our day of leisure
is cut short.

54
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:25,854
There is a mess in Marseilles.

55
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:28,923
Some madman driving an Audi
at impossible speeds.

56
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:33,395
Don't look at me.

57
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:36,464
That is the first place
the chief told me to look.

58
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,830
But I will tell him
you have the perfect alibi.

59
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:44,237
As usual.

60
00:07:49,913 --> 00:07:51,141
Tarconi!

61
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:53,949
- Please!
- I am sorry, Frank.

62
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:57,245
- It's our first bite!
- Yeah, yeah.

63
00:07:57,988 --> 00:07:59,853
- Please.
- Yeah.

64
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:01,523
Stop the boat. Come on.

65
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:04,455
- No. No, Frank.
- Come on, please.

66
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:48,262
Purpose of your visit, Mr. Johnson?

67
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,028
Business.

68
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:51,835
What kind of business?

69
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:54,239
Environmental protection.

70
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:02,243
Thank you.

71
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:07,921
Mr. Minister, you're giving the opening
address at an EU conference...

72
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:10,854
...on environmental impact of industry
in Odessa tomorrow.

73
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:13,791
- What is top on your list of priorities?
- It's a short list.

74
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:16,727
There's one item: the environment
and how to protect it.

75
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,730
In the face of increasing pressure...

76
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:21,870
...for industries to compete
successfully in a global economy...

77
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:25,405
...that goal can sometimes come up
against some very harsh realities.

78
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:28,578
Well, not as harsh as
a polluted and uninhabitable planet.

79
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:30,473
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me now...

80
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,877
...I have trees to save
and industrialists to disappoint.

81
00:09:37,587 --> 00:09:39,782
- Your speech for tomorrow.
- Any good?

82
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:44,191
- It's going to piss off a lot of people.
- Excellent.

83
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:08,306
Hello?

84
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,282
Mr. Minister?

85
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:13,311
Who is this?

86
00:10:13,723 --> 00:10:16,021
My name is not important.

87
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:18,456
I've been put in charge of
the negotiations...

88
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:21,062
...you are engaged in with Ecocorp...

89
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:24,529
...for issuance of their license
to do business in the Ukraine.

90
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:27,202
You must be misinformed,
Mr. Whatever-Your-Name-ls.

91
00:10:27,404 --> 00:10:29,463
I've terminated negotiations
permanently.

92
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:32,073
I think you will reconsider
that position...

93
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:35,676
...once you have a chance to study
the documents in the envelope.

94
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:52,561
I'll be in touch.

95
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,168
Yeah, there's been an accident.

96
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:39,872
Send an ambulance,
8 Route de la Falaise.

97
00:11:58,328 --> 00:11:59,693
Malcolm.

98
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:01,557
Malcolm. Malcolm.

99
00:12:07,704 --> 00:12:10,138
I asked you for your price.
What is this?

100
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,401
A man who might be interested
in taking the job. This man will.

101
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:16,775
My boss said you're the man
for the job.

102
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,641
Your boss got his facts wrong.

103
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,041
Two things you should know
about my boss:

104
00:12:23,253 --> 00:12:26,484
He never gets his facts wrong,
he never takes no for an answer.

105
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:28,714
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

106
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,427
Well, not this time.

107
00:12:46,676 --> 00:12:48,735
You don't wanna do this.

108
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:52,881
I don't think you're in a position to
tell me what I do and don't wanna do.

109
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:56,051
You have 10 seconds
to change your mind.

110
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:03,824
I'll give you five seconds
to remove your hand.

111
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,813
Malcolm. Malcolm.

112
00:14:06,022 --> 00:14:07,011
You hear me?

113
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:12,024
Mal, I said drop in anytime,
but I didn't mean...

114
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:15,091
- Nowhere else to go.
- Just take it easy, okay?

115
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,027
Don't move me from the car.

116
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:22,193
- It's just till the ambulance arrives.
- No ambulance.

117
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:26,007
You need a doctor, you've been shot.
I can't take care of this.

118
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:30,379
Not far from car.

119
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:32,939
Relax.

120
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:37,946
Just try to stay calm.
We'll have you fixed up in no time.

121
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:50,990
He's inside. Quick, it's serious.

122
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:56,561
Sir?

123
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:59,970
- You wanna be careful moving him.
- We know our job, okay?

124
00:15:00,176 --> 00:15:02,667
Sir, can you hear me?

125
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,403
This car... No...

126
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:06,138
If you hear me, press my hand.

127
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,880
The car...

128
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:00,035
Am I in heaven?

129
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,704
Actually, you're in a bit of the shit.

130
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:05,864
You'll help me out of it?

131
00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:08,305
That depends on
how deep you're in.

132
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:11,806
- Don't trust anyone.
- Couldn't agree with you more.

133
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,608
- Come on.
- No! Don't leave the car!

134
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:18,981
- What's so special about the car?
- Not the car.

135
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,964
Wait!

136
00:17:01,764 --> 00:17:02,753
I told you.

137
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:09,667
<i>Don't trust anyone.</i>

138
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:12,764
<i>I told you.</i>

139
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,421
I took the liberty
of bringing your suit.

140
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,791
It's what you wear when
you're working, correct?

141
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:12,661
Correct. But I'm not working.

142
00:18:13,202 --> 00:18:16,296
- You see, boss? I told you.
- Please, Joseph.

143
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:20,965
Your approach was not very effective in
presenting our proposal the first time.

144
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:22,735
Thank you.

145
00:18:23,412 --> 00:18:24,401
As I was saying...

146
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:27,742
...we came to you in good faith.
You said you were unavailable.

147
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,384
We contracted with the man
whose number you gave us.

148
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:32,110
He proved to be ineffective.

149
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:35,586
And now I am left
with unfinished business.

150
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:38,090
The way I see it, you're responsible.

151
00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:40,619
I understand your point of view.

152
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,024
But I'm still unavailable.

153
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:45,500
Boss, can I say something?

154
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:50,567
Anyone else wanna say something?

155
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:55,233
Good.

156
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,536
Find me a smarter one.

157
00:18:59,882 --> 00:19:01,907
You have three seconds
to change your mind...

158
00:19:02,118 --> 00:19:04,882
...or you're gonna
be permanently unavailable.

159
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,079
One.

160
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:10,347
Two.

161
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:14,655
One condition.

162
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,290
I'm listening.

163
00:19:20,002 --> 00:19:22,197
I drive my own car.

164
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:24,973
Deal.

165
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:31,678
In anticipation of your answer, we took
the liberty of bringing your car.

166
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:35,817
Changed the oil, gave it a tune-up,
took out all the non-essential material.

167
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:39,545
Left the switch-over license plates.
Love that.

168
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:42,019
Replaced the GPS
with one of our own.

169
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:44,090
Preprogrammed.
More efficient that way.

170
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:48,520
Why I was so insistent on using only
the best man for this assignment?

171
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,701
We're playing
in a much larger game here.

172
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:58,567
Don't think of this as just another job.
Think of it as a mission.

173
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,443
I'm so pleased to find we share
the same approach to our work.

174
00:20:03,646 --> 00:20:05,705
I make a deal, that's the deal.
Just like you.

175
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:08,645
You don't like names. Neither do I.
We're both precise.

176
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:11,945
Neither one of us has any interest
in what we're paid to do...

177
00:20:12,154 --> 00:20:16,113
...beyond what we are paid to do.
Those are your rules, right?

178
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,927
You forgot one.

179
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:29,436
- I work alone.
- I thought you might like the company.

180
00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:32,204
Thought you wanted me
to complete a mission.

181
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:36,240
You're right. I do.

182
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:40,209
Wait.

183
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:44,052
What, you wanna change the rules?

184
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:48,419
Every rule has an exception.
Let's make one for today.

185
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:52,821
You're the boss.

186
00:20:55,598 --> 00:20:57,589
Anything else?

187
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:00,064
The jewelry.
Anything I should know?

188
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:06,367
You remember those jokers
trying to blow up airliners...

189
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:09,408
...by sneaking liquids through
and combining them onboard?

190
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:11,512
Same principle, just refined.

191
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:13,409
Twenty-five feet from the car...

192
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:17,017
...yellow light comes on,
signaling the first liquid is ready.

193
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:19,016
Fifty feet, orange.

194
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:21,551
Second liquid
flows into the chamber.

195
00:21:21,757 --> 00:21:24,726
Seventy-five feet,
you're gonna see red.

196
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:31,729
Time to go.

197
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:35,931
This phone is programmed
to call only one number, mine.

198
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:40,874
When you pass the first toll on the
road going north, call me, all right?

199
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:44,947
Money for gas and food.

200
00:21:45,147 --> 00:21:46,341
Any other questions?

201
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,141
Would you mind
buckling your seat belt?

202
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,223
Don't suppose you wanna tell me
what this is all about?

203
00:22:40,036 --> 00:22:41,936
Great.

204
00:22:57,653 --> 00:23:00,213
<i>Ocean Pearl</i>
requesting cargo clearance.

205
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:04,415
The papers are with
the environmental agency.

206
00:23:04,827 --> 00:23:06,727
Drop anchor and wait to dock.

207
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:09,557
- <i>We'll inform you when they're signed.</i>
- Okay.

208
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:20,836
I know what happened to you.

209
00:23:21,043 --> 00:23:23,273
But what happened to Frank?

210
00:23:29,018 --> 00:23:33,114
Colonel Medved over at Intelligence
has been given all the information.

211
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:35,120
He knows it's top priority.

212
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:37,884
He wants you to know
he has his best men on it.

213
00:23:38,094 --> 00:23:40,255
He'll keep it out of official channels.

214
00:23:40,463 --> 00:23:44,126
He suggests you buy
as much time as you can.

215
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:44,287
Look, I don't know what your part in all
this is or isn't. And I don't really care.

216
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:46,791
You were here first,
you know more than I do...

217
00:24:46,996 --> 00:24:48,691
...download me on what you know.

218
00:24:48,898 --> 00:24:50,456
I know nothing.

219
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,861
How did you know Malcolm?

220
00:24:53,302 --> 00:24:54,291
I didn't.

221
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,737
You just happened to end up in a car
with a man you don't know?

222
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:02,002
I'm now in a car
with man I don't know.

223
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:06,507
Aren't you supposed to make a call?

224
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,355
<i>Nice to hear from you.</i>

225
00:25:14,557 --> 00:25:17,617
You can skip the pleasantries.
Just give me the code.

226
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,587
<i>1- 1- 2-6.</i>

227
00:25:23,832 --> 00:25:26,232
<i>Call me when you arrive.</i>

228
00:25:28,037 --> 00:25:30,403
What's in Budapest?

229
00:25:30,606 --> 00:25:32,870
Goulash. Beer.

230
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:41,110
All right.

231
00:25:41,317 --> 00:25:44,115
Let's rewind here,
start with the proper introductions.

232
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:47,278
What happened
to the rule of no names?

233
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:50,549
I'm suspending that rule
for the moment.

234
00:25:53,629 --> 00:25:55,824
I'm Frank Martin.

235
00:25:58,133 --> 00:25:59,566
And your name is?

236
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:05,137
What matters, my name?

237
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:08,642
Well, we're in this situation together.

238
00:26:09,211 --> 00:26:10,735
No.

239
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:17,146
We're sitting here with two exploding
bracelets on, going to the same place.

240
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,254
I'd call that being
in the same situation.

241
00:26:20,723 --> 00:26:23,283
It's not. They are going to kill you.

242
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:27,285
I'm aware of that.

243
00:26:28,264 --> 00:26:31,256
In all probability, after they kill me,
you're next on the list.

244
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:34,994
Now, if I'm gonna keep that from
happening, I'm gonna need a little help.

245
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:37,832
From the top. We have this problem.

246
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,008
You think I don't know
it's a problem?

247
00:26:40,476 --> 00:26:42,341
I look stupid to you?

248
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:45,536
I didn't say you were stupid.

249
00:26:47,283 --> 00:26:48,648
But we have a problem...

250
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:52,514
...and you're not being very helpful
in participating in the solution of it.

251
00:26:54,189 --> 00:26:56,453
I don't want to talk anymore.

252
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,094
Fine.

253
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,209
What did you say your name was?

254
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:24,152
Frank. Frank Martin.

255
00:27:25,154 --> 00:27:27,281
Frank Martin.

256
00:27:27,656 --> 00:27:29,681
Valentina.

257
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:35,252
Pleased to meet you.

258
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,414
<i>The gentlemen</i>
<i>from Ecocorp are here.</i>

259
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,050
Show them in.

260
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:44,855
Gentlemen.

261
00:28:48,137 --> 00:28:49,661
Mr. Minister.

262
00:28:49,872 --> 00:28:52,739
We'd like to thank you for
reconsidering our proposal...

263
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:55,876
...on such short notice.
- You make it very hard not to.

264
00:28:56,078 --> 00:28:59,707
Well, yes. We do have a reputation
of not taking no for an answer.

265
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:02,116
Here are the contracts.

266
00:29:03,986 --> 00:29:05,044
All in order.

267
00:29:05,888 --> 00:29:07,913
We were told the ships
couldn't be cleared...

268
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:10,114
...unless you personally
signed off on them.

269
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:11,656
Ships?

270
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:13,660
I thought there was only one.

271
00:29:13,862 --> 00:29:16,330
Oh, well, here's the thing.

272
00:29:16,532 --> 00:29:19,262
In order to make the venture
more profitable...

273
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:22,437
...we need to process the material
in a volume that makes sense.

274
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:24,265
How many ships
are we talking about?

275
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:28,239
Plus the one in the port
waiting on clearance, eight.

276
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:30,071
Eight.

277
00:29:30,446 --> 00:29:31,606
This year.

278
00:29:32,881 --> 00:29:35,907
Protecting the environment
is a long-term commitment.

279
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:38,109
You've said so yourself, haven't you?

280
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,845
And I will do again tomorrow
in Odessa...

281
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:43,923
...where I will sign these.

282
00:29:44,893 --> 00:29:47,657
We were really hoping to
settle this today.

283
00:29:47,863 --> 00:29:52,232
I want to review them, now that
there are some addendums.

284
00:29:52,434 --> 00:29:54,595
Twenty-four hours
doesn't make a difference...

285
00:29:54,803 --> 00:29:57,169
...on such a long-term
commitment, will it?

286
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,636
No, of course not.

287
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:04,836
Then I will see you tomorrow
in Odessa. Let's say 9 a.m.

288
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:12,118
<i>Yes.</i>

289
00:30:12,321 --> 00:30:14,050
Okay, I'll stay.

290
00:30:14,256 --> 00:30:15,883
- But the material is leaking.
- <i>And?</i>

291
00:30:16,091 --> 00:30:18,651
- We won't be able to hide it.
- <i>I'll take care of it.</i>

292
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:20,158
If ever they check...

293
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:22,660
<i>Easy. The deal will be closed</i>
<i>very soon.</i>

294
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:24,492
Twenty-four hours. No more.

295
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:37,375
- Yes?
- I've bought you another 24 hours.

296
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:39,877
You have until tomorrow, 9 a.m.

297
00:30:40,082 --> 00:30:41,913
That should be
more than enough time.

298
00:30:42,518 --> 00:30:44,349
<i>Do you have a lead?</i>

299
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:46,350
Better than a lead.

300
00:30:47,189 --> 00:30:48,178
A location.

301
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:28,730
I'm hungry.

302
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:32,256
We're 100 kilometers
from beer and sausage.

303
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:36,135
I don't like sausage.

304
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:40,875
What would you like?

305
00:31:45,047 --> 00:31:46,674
Veal.

306
00:31:46,882 --> 00:31:48,816
Roast, with carrots...

307
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:50,416
...and beets.

308
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,046
In gravy, with Madeira in stock.

309
00:31:55,257 --> 00:31:56,519
Nothing to start?

310
00:32:00,095 --> 00:32:02,063
A salad.

311
00:32:02,698 --> 00:32:05,929
Greens tossed with balsamic.

312
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:07,897
From Modena.

313
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:09,502
Aged?

314
00:32:09,705 --> 00:32:11,673
Of course, aged.

315
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,701
And for dessert?

316
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,572
Sachertorte.

317
00:32:20,115 --> 00:32:22,606
With whipped cream or without?

318
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:25,317
With.

319
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:27,952
To drink?

320
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:31,085
Wine.

321
00:32:31,293 --> 00:32:33,090
Tokaj, perhaps?

322
00:32:33,629 --> 00:32:34,687
Ice wine.

323
00:32:35,864 --> 00:32:37,661
Of course.

324
00:32:49,578 --> 00:32:52,376
- What are you doing?
- Seeing a man about some jewelry.

325
00:33:04,092 --> 00:33:05,616
He's gone off the reservation.

326
00:33:07,996 --> 00:33:11,295
Send someone to get him back on.

327
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:13,867
Don't kill him.

328
00:33:40,629 --> 00:33:43,223
Frank. It's so good to see you,
<i>mein Freund.</i>

329
00:33:43,532 --> 00:33:45,830
Good to see you too, Otto.

330
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:48,692
You didn't mention
you bring company.

331
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,363
It's not really company.

332
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:52,533
It's...

333
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:54,834
...complicated.

334
00:33:55,043 --> 00:33:58,012
With you, it's always complicated.
You can tell me about it...

335
00:33:58,213 --> 00:34:01,944
...over a nice schnitzel
with <i>Kartoffelsalat</i> I have prepared.

336
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,745
Hey, Otto, you know
I love your schnitzel...

337
00:34:04,953 --> 00:34:07,387
...but we need to get rid of this first.

338
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:13,383
Binary free-form
magnetic-resolution technology.

339
00:34:13,895 --> 00:34:15,089
English, please, Otto.

340
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:18,556
There's a program the
Pentagon has funded...

341
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:21,861
...through one of their
subsidiary front companies...

342
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,403
...that's been experimenting with
this new kind of weaponry...

343
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:28,235
...based on the theory
of magnetic attraction.

344
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:30,468
Very hush-hush stuff.

345
00:34:32,147 --> 00:34:35,048
I didn't realize you were in the loop
on the Pentagon hush-hush.

346
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,275
You wouldn't believe
what you can discover...

347
00:34:37,486 --> 00:34:39,647
...walking through the Internet.

348
00:34:39,855 --> 00:34:42,085
You wanna see the
invasion plans for Iran?

349
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:44,286
Maybe some other time.

350
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:47,929
Right now we need to get this thing off
without blowing myself to Iran.

351
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,564
I don't wanna bother you
with the details...

352
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:55,294
...but usually there's
a transmitter plate close by.

353
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,977
You should not be doing this.

354
00:35:03,178 --> 00:35:05,169
First you don't talk,
now you offer advice.

355
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,848
Not advice. A warning.

356
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:10,174
Well, a little late for warnings,
don't you think?

357
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:18,151
I agree with you.

358
00:35:22,798 --> 00:35:24,322
You're off course.

359
00:35:30,472 --> 00:35:33,066
- Should I?
- Yeah, you should.

360
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,638
Look, fellas...

361
00:35:41,483 --> 00:35:44,384
...some things in the car
were a bit off, needed checking.

362
00:35:45,821 --> 00:35:48,119
In my profession,
a man is only as good as the car.

363
00:35:48,323 --> 00:35:51,520
You take care of the car,
the car will take care of you.

364
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:56,027
The boss says, "Back on the road."

365
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:57,862
Frank?

366
00:35:58,667 --> 00:35:59,656
Keep at it.

367
00:36:02,437 --> 00:36:03,529
Back in the car, Frank.

368
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,433
No.

369
00:37:16,845 --> 00:37:18,904
- Find it?
- Not yet.

370
00:38:35,657 --> 00:38:37,249
You're the smart one?

371
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:40,053
No. I'm the big one.

372
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:33,544
Not so big anymore, are you?

373
00:39:56,171 --> 00:39:57,968
Found it.

374
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,701
- The transmitter.
- Can you remove it?

375
00:40:07,215 --> 00:40:08,204
It's wired.

376
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,547
If I do:

377
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,535
You fight good.

378
00:41:13,581 --> 00:41:15,674
But you tie bad.

379
00:41:21,322 --> 00:41:22,311
Where are you going?

380
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:24,620
Tired.

381
00:41:25,827 --> 00:41:28,022
That's why I prefer to deal with cars.

382
00:41:28,897 --> 00:41:30,558
That makes two of us.

383
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:34,068
What do you want me to do
when they...? When they wake up?

384
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:37,329
Probably best to take
the rest of the day off.

385
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,816
I'm not amused.

386
00:41:57,025 --> 00:41:58,890
You'd be less amused
if you ended up dead.

387
00:41:59,093 --> 00:42:01,493
<i>If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.</i>
<i>You need me.</i>

388
00:42:01,696 --> 00:42:04,494
You want me to complete the job,
I need some clarification.

389
00:42:06,134 --> 00:42:07,226
I'm listening.

390
00:42:07,702 --> 00:42:08,828
In person.

391
00:42:09,037 --> 00:42:10,470
We've already done in person.

392
00:42:10,672 --> 00:42:12,765
<i>Well, not to my satisfaction,</i>
<i>apparently.</i>

393
00:42:13,508 --> 00:42:16,409
Right now, my satisfaction
should be your main concern.

394
00:42:17,512 --> 00:42:20,037
Same place. One hour.
Wait for my call.

395
00:43:16,938 --> 00:43:17,996
Hello?

396
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:20,140
You've disappointed me.

397
00:43:20,341 --> 00:43:23,401
You won't be the first
and you won't be the last.

398
00:43:23,611 --> 00:43:28,378
- I told you I wanted to do this in person.
- That won't be necessary. You see...

399
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:30,642
...since our little chat
at the beginning...

400
00:43:30,852 --> 00:43:34,344
...l've been thinking I don't need
the best for this mundane assignment.

401
00:43:34,555 --> 00:43:36,716
Any idiot with
a driver's license will do.

402
00:43:36,924 --> 00:43:39,950
So in the words of the
great American, Donald Trump:

403
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:43,494
I'm sorry, but you're fired.

404
00:44:29,844 --> 00:44:30,868
Who are you?

405
00:44:31,279 --> 00:44:33,873
- Your new chauffeur.
- I want the old one back.

406
00:44:34,082 --> 00:44:36,414
He's about to go to pieces.

407
00:45:44,886 --> 00:45:46,217
You're fired.

408
00:45:50,057 --> 00:45:51,081
How was your nap?

409
00:45:51,459 --> 00:45:53,859
Restful. How was your phone call?

410
00:45:54,061 --> 00:45:56,529
Brief. Fasten your seat belt.

411
00:46:08,443 --> 00:46:09,432
Tarconi.

412
00:46:09,644 --> 00:46:10,668
It's me.

413
00:46:11,846 --> 00:46:13,575
I was wondering
when you would call.

414
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:14,975
I've been busy.

415
00:46:15,183 --> 00:46:17,811
Let me guess. In Budapest?

416
00:46:19,086 --> 00:46:20,417
You've been busy too.

417
00:46:20,922 --> 00:46:23,755
Never a problem keeping that way
with a friend like you.

418
00:46:23,958 --> 00:46:26,791
So I don't have to be redundant,
tell me what you know.

419
00:46:26,994 --> 00:46:29,428
There is a black Mercedes
also in Budapest.

420
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,689
<i>Probably not occupied</i>
<i>by friends of yours.</i>

421
00:46:31,899 --> 00:46:34,527
That is what I know.
Now tell me what you know.

422
00:46:35,336 --> 00:46:38,669
I have two bags in the back
and a girl in the front.

423
00:46:38,873 --> 00:46:40,773
Russian, I think.

424
00:46:41,008 --> 00:46:43,169
I don't know what she
has to do with anything.

425
00:46:43,377 --> 00:46:45,345
Have you tried asking her?

426
00:46:45,546 --> 00:46:47,605
- Now, why didn't I think of that?
- <i>Sorry.</i>

427
00:46:47,815 --> 00:46:49,510
Of course you've asked.
And she says?

428
00:46:50,151 --> 00:46:51,448
I'm going to die.

429
00:46:51,652 --> 00:46:53,950
Typical. Russians.

430
00:46:54,155 --> 00:46:56,350
They are so dark.

431
00:46:56,557 --> 00:47:00,049
I remember, in school,
reading Dostoyevsky and thinking...

432
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:02,923
...when do these people laugh?

433
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,791
One page after the other...

434
00:47:04,999 --> 00:47:07,968
...misery and suffering
like you wouldn't believe, Frank.

435
00:47:08,169 --> 00:47:11,570
Inspector, can we save the
literature lesson? I'm blinking here.

436
00:47:11,772 --> 00:47:12,966
Is that code?

437
00:47:13,908 --> 00:47:17,344
No, it's some bracelet
they accessorized us with.

438
00:47:17,545 --> 00:47:19,775
Wired to explode
if we get too far from the car.

439
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:20,970
<i>They?</i>

440
00:47:21,682 --> 00:47:22,706
Some American.

441
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,783
<i>Can you be more specific?</i>
<i>A name? A number?</i>

442
00:47:25,987 --> 00:47:27,011
Nothing.

443
00:47:27,221 --> 00:47:29,416
Why do you always
make it so easy, Frank?

444
00:47:29,624 --> 00:47:31,319
It's my nature.

445
00:47:31,526 --> 00:47:33,357
<i>Where are you? I will come there.</i>

446
00:47:33,561 --> 00:47:36,029
That's not a good idea.
They have me on a short leash.

447
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,063
I can't be of much help
if you do not give me something.

448
00:47:40,701 --> 00:47:42,828
How close are you to a computer?

449
00:47:46,674 --> 00:47:47,766
Yes, Frank?

450
00:47:47,975 --> 00:47:50,739
<i>That wasn't very nice,</i>
<i>back there in the market.</i>

451
00:47:50,945 --> 00:47:53,778
You were the one
who broke the rules, not me.

452
00:47:53,981 --> 00:47:56,040
<i>Point well taken.</i>

453
00:47:56,317 --> 00:47:59,844
That makes us even. What say
we start with a clean slate?

454
00:48:00,054 --> 00:48:03,182
So this call is about
kiss-and-make-up, then?

455
00:48:03,824 --> 00:48:04,882
<i>More or less.</i>

456
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:07,993
You have what I need
to get the bracelet off...

457
00:48:08,195 --> 00:48:11,028
...I have the packages
you need delivered.

458
00:48:12,066 --> 00:48:14,591
Here are the new coordinates,
then: 2-6-12.

459
00:48:15,002 --> 00:48:16,469
<i>That'll take you to the place...</i>

460
00:48:16,671 --> 00:48:18,969
<i>... where we can have a
<i>conclusion to this business.</i>

461
00:48:19,173 --> 00:48:20,902
I look forward to it.

462
00:48:26,914 --> 00:48:28,211
Frank.

463
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:29,610
<i>Did you get it?</i>

464
00:48:34,622 --> 00:48:36,556
Got the signal. Give us a little time...

465
00:48:36,757 --> 00:48:38,987
<i>... and we should have his number</i>
<i>and location.</i>

466
00:48:40,361 --> 00:48:42,090
Your new phone, sir.

467
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:50,938
- Anything else?
- No.

468
00:48:54,442 --> 00:48:58,139
<i>Frank, do you know where</i>
<i>the signal is taking you?</i>

469
00:49:08,522 --> 00:49:12,652
I know restaurant there.
Fish like you never had.

470
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:16,023
Roasted with small carrots
and black pepper.

471
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,790
Romanian wine, not so good.

472
00:49:20,401 --> 00:49:23,234
But for the last meal,
could be worse.

473
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:29,005
You really should begin
to think more positive.

474
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,576
I'm realist.

475
00:49:33,514 --> 00:49:36,176
My friend was right when he said
you were doom and gloom.

476
00:49:36,384 --> 00:49:39,251
What means "doom and gloom"?

477
00:49:39,453 --> 00:49:42,388
You know, you only see
the horrible and the terrible.

478
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:45,559
Your friend, where does he get this?
He doesn't know me.

479
00:49:45,793 --> 00:49:49,058
He was talking about you in general.
Russians, as a people.

480
00:49:49,263 --> 00:49:51,390
I'm not Russian. I'm Ukrainian.

481
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:53,157
Excuse me.

482
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:57,428
Not excused. We're different people.
We're different here...

483
00:49:57,638 --> 00:49:58,798
...and here.

484
00:50:04,478 --> 00:50:08,471
Me, personally, I think there's
a little bit of an optimist in you.

485
00:50:10,051 --> 00:50:12,451
How you can make such a statement?
You don't know me.

486
00:50:14,455 --> 00:50:16,787
Well, I see
you're putting makeup on.

487
00:50:16,991 --> 00:50:20,483
If you were so convinced
we was gonna die, why bother?

488
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:26,466
What does looking good
have to do with dying?

489
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,333
Hello.

490
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:37,503
What's that?

491
00:50:37,712 --> 00:50:40,180
Souvenirs from Ibiza.
Do you want one?

492
00:50:40,481 --> 00:50:43,507
No, thank you. And neither do you.
We need to stay sharp.

493
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:47,281
Okay.

494
00:50:52,393 --> 00:50:53,883
You stay sharp.

495
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:56,962
I stay, how you say? Optimist?

496
00:50:57,431 --> 00:51:00,798
Give me that.
Give me that thing. Give me the pill!

497
00:51:04,105 --> 00:51:05,367
Give me that...

498
00:51:10,478 --> 00:51:12,605
Jesus.

499
00:51:15,082 --> 00:51:16,709
Great.

500
00:51:18,819 --> 00:51:22,084
- Just great.
- Come on, Frank Martin, lighten up.

501
00:51:22,289 --> 00:51:24,154
I should?
How about when those pills hit?

502
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:26,986
You're gonna be lighting up
like a goddamn Christmas tree.

503
00:51:27,194 --> 00:51:28,252
That would be nice.

504
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:31,297
Boring. Boring. Boring?

505
00:51:31,499 --> 00:51:33,433
Oh, yeah.

506
00:52:11,705 --> 00:52:13,468
You should stay in the car.

507
00:52:13,808 --> 00:52:16,140
You want me to pee in car?

508
00:52:21,448 --> 00:52:23,609
Okay. Go on.

509
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:28,886
You remember.

510
00:52:55,115 --> 00:52:56,912
Don't.

511
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:19,663
Don't.

512
00:53:21,108 --> 00:53:22,097
<i>Don't.</i>

513
00:53:42,796 --> 00:53:43,785
Oh, no.

514
00:54:22,036 --> 00:54:25,494
- Stop, all right?
- Why? I don't drive.

515
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:26,929
I want to have fun.

516
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:30,474
I want to be happy. You should
try happy instead of so serious.

517
00:54:30,811 --> 00:54:33,837
It's important to stay positive,
like you say, yeah?

518
00:54:34,048 --> 00:54:37,245
- Drink with me, Frankie.
- I don't want a drink.

519
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,511
Now who is all gloomy and doomy?

520
00:54:42,723 --> 00:54:44,657
I say it right? Gloomy doomy?

521
00:54:45,693 --> 00:54:47,820
Come on, get in the car.

522
00:54:48,929 --> 00:54:50,988
I am free, like a bird.

523
00:54:59,006 --> 00:55:00,769
The girl! Come on! Faster!

524
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:12,144
- I have lost my friend!
- I'll buy you a new one.

525
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:28,524
Have any idea
why we have a car on our ass?

526
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,235
I don't know. I don't care.

527
00:55:33,574 --> 00:55:35,974
- You mind?
- First you say I'm doom and gloom...

528
00:55:36,176 --> 00:55:39,009
...and now you tell me do not
be happy? Make up your mind.

529
00:56:28,729 --> 00:56:31,163
- Yes, Frank?
- I thought we had an agreement.

530
00:56:31,365 --> 00:56:32,593
We do.

531
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,698
It had nothing to do
with a car on my ass.

532
00:56:36,336 --> 00:56:40,773
I don't have anything to do with that.
Someone else has issues with you?

533
00:56:40,974 --> 00:56:42,771
Likely.

534
00:56:45,546 --> 00:56:48,879
What I think is that there are
other forces at work here.

535
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:51,483
Let me check into it,
see what I can find out.

536
00:56:51,685 --> 00:56:53,277
What do I do in the meantime?

537
00:56:53,487 --> 00:56:55,648
Drive faster.

538
00:57:30,124 --> 00:57:31,421
What the hell is he doing?

539
00:58:34,454 --> 00:58:36,217
There!

540
00:58:36,423 --> 00:58:37,822
He's down there!

541
00:58:43,397 --> 00:58:44,694
I'm hungry.

542
00:58:44,898 --> 00:58:47,059
Should have thought
about a sandwich, not vodka.

543
00:58:49,336 --> 00:58:50,360
Look!

544
00:58:56,777 --> 00:58:58,904
I wasn't hungry then, I was thirsty.

545
00:58:59,112 --> 00:59:00,773
Why you are so mean to me?

546
00:59:02,115 --> 00:59:05,278
- I'm not being mean. I'm preoccupied.
- What means "preoccupied"?

547
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:12,516
That means preoccupied.

548
00:59:24,271 --> 00:59:26,239
Shoot the tires! Come on! Get him!

549
00:59:28,075 --> 00:59:30,635
- Get down!
- Shoot him!

550
00:59:41,355 --> 00:59:42,652
Bloody hell!

551
00:59:52,699 --> 00:59:53,927
Faster!

552
01:00:00,374 --> 01:00:02,001
Stop the car!

553
01:00:02,876 --> 01:00:04,104
Oh, shit!

554
01:01:09,109 --> 01:01:10,508
What are you doing?

555
01:01:10,744 --> 01:01:12,177
You're so tense.

556
01:01:12,579 --> 01:01:14,604
You don't say.

557
01:01:19,186 --> 01:01:20,847
I make you relax, okay?

558
01:01:22,189 --> 01:01:25,022
- Yeah.
- I'm good at this.

559
01:01:25,492 --> 01:01:27,722
Making tense go away.

560
01:01:36,737 --> 01:01:37,897
What are you doing?

561
01:01:38,105 --> 01:01:42,872
I want to feel sex
one more time before I die.

562
01:01:43,076 --> 01:01:44,543
Don't you?

563
01:01:46,813 --> 01:01:49,247
What is it with you and dying?

564
01:01:50,684 --> 01:01:53,346
There is something wrong with me?

565
01:01:53,954 --> 01:01:55,216
Am I not sexy?

566
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:57,716
Yeah, you're sexy.

567
01:02:03,764 --> 01:02:04,753
You're the gay.

568
01:02:06,066 --> 01:02:09,297
Nope, I am not the gay.

569
01:02:09,503 --> 01:02:11,403
I don't mind.

570
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,939
I'm not, okay?

571
01:02:17,411 --> 01:02:20,039
Then what's the problem?

572
01:02:22,182 --> 01:02:25,948
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe I'm not in the mood?

573
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:46,797
- I thought rule is don't open package.
- It is.

574
01:02:47,007 --> 01:02:48,702
Why you have rules
if you break them?

575
01:02:49,976 --> 01:02:51,671
I keep asking myself the same thing.

576
01:02:53,146 --> 01:02:55,137
Phone books.

577
01:03:03,557 --> 01:03:05,957
- You're the package.
- Yes.

578
01:03:06,993 --> 01:03:08,358
Could have said something.

579
01:03:08,895 --> 01:03:11,489
- Would it make a difference?
- Yes.

580
01:03:13,567 --> 01:03:14,932
Now what are you doing?

581
01:03:15,135 --> 01:03:17,569
You know, back in garage...

582
01:03:17,771 --> 01:03:22,640
...it was very turn-on to me
when you take off your clothes.

583
01:03:22,843 --> 01:03:25,505
I was trying to keep five cretins
from caving my head in.

584
01:03:25,712 --> 01:03:27,145
I don't see the turn-on in that.

585
01:03:27,347 --> 01:03:32,410
You think it's only man
gets turned on by striptease?

586
01:03:32,619 --> 01:03:34,644
I don't like where this
is going, Valentina.

587
01:03:34,855 --> 01:03:37,824
Would you striptease for me again?

588
01:03:38,525 --> 01:03:41,153
Give me the keys. This is not funny.

589
01:03:41,361 --> 01:03:42,487
You want keys?

590
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:49,331
I want you to stop playing around,
is what I want.

591
01:03:49,536 --> 01:03:52,801
Maybe it's last chance to
play around for you and for me.

592
01:03:53,006 --> 01:03:55,497
This is not the time
or the place for playing.

593
01:03:55,709 --> 01:03:59,770
Why do I get feeling with you
it's never time or place?

594
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:02,278
If I wanna get analyzed,
I'll see a psychiatrist.

595
01:04:02,482 --> 01:04:04,712
Now, give me the keys.

596
01:04:05,252 --> 01:04:07,584
Come on, Frank Martin.

597
01:04:07,787 --> 01:04:10,017
Make playtime for me.

598
01:04:30,076 --> 01:04:32,567
All right? That enough?

599
01:04:32,779 --> 01:04:35,543
Not enough.
That is not a striptease, Frank.

600
01:04:35,749 --> 01:04:39,241
Striptease is sexy.
You know, move your ass a little.

601
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:41,610
Come on, Frank Martin.

602
01:04:41,922 --> 01:04:43,822
You want keys?

603
01:04:44,224 --> 01:04:47,022
I want strip.

604
01:04:53,233 --> 01:04:55,827
You know what I'm gonna do to you
for making me do this?

605
01:04:56,036 --> 01:04:57,469
Spank me?

606
01:04:58,038 --> 01:04:59,266
For starters.

607
01:04:59,472 --> 01:05:02,066
- Tie me up?
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

608
01:05:03,543 --> 01:05:06,137
I like the rough stuff.

609
01:05:09,516 --> 01:05:11,507
Really?

610
01:05:15,822 --> 01:05:18,586
Oh, but not too rough.

611
01:05:19,593 --> 01:05:21,959
Deal was a striptease for the keys.

612
01:05:22,162 --> 01:05:25,620
New deal. Kiss me for the keys.

613
01:05:33,273 --> 01:05:34,672
Like you mean it.

614
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,043
Do you ever kiss
like you mean it, Frank?

615
01:05:45,185 --> 01:05:47,551
I'm thinking maybe not.

616
01:05:47,754 --> 01:05:50,018
I'm thinking you live alone.

617
01:05:51,024 --> 01:05:52,958
Inside and outside.

618
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,729
Thinking it is not dying
you're afraid of.

619
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:58,795
It's living.

620
01:05:59,065 --> 01:06:00,589
Live with me.

621
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,563
Just this once.

622
01:06:02,769 --> 01:06:06,227
Just this moment. Live with me.

623
01:06:48,548 --> 01:06:50,482
- What's his position?
- We lost him.

624
01:06:52,585 --> 01:06:56,544
He headed into the mountains.
We can't get reception up there.

625
01:06:56,756 --> 01:06:59,156
Hack into one of the
military satellites.

626
01:07:06,366 --> 01:07:07,458
Yes.

627
01:07:07,667 --> 01:07:09,931
You think we're playing games here,
Mr. Minister?

628
01:07:10,136 --> 01:07:11,933
I don't know what
you're talking about.

629
01:07:12,138 --> 01:07:15,471
I'm talking about a black car full of
your incompetent operatives.

630
01:07:15,675 --> 01:07:18,735
<i>One more move like that and you will</i>
<i>never see your daughter again.</i>

631
01:07:18,945 --> 01:07:20,344
I want to hear her voice.

632
01:07:20,547 --> 01:07:23,175
When the contract
is signed and delivered.

633
01:07:23,383 --> 01:07:25,783
I will not sign until I hear her voice.

634
01:07:25,985 --> 01:07:28,579
You are in no position
to play hardball, Mr. Minister.

635
01:07:28,788 --> 01:07:31,416
Well, neither are you, Mr. Johnson.

636
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:34,288
<i>Yes, I know who you are.</i>

637
01:07:34,627 --> 01:07:37,687
And I can assure you, if anything
happens to my daughter...

638
01:07:37,897 --> 01:07:39,762
...I will use all the power I have.

639
01:07:39,966 --> 01:07:45,404
I will hunt you down and make you pay
in a most hideous way for this.

640
01:07:48,808 --> 01:07:50,036
We have to move now.

641
01:07:56,216 --> 01:07:57,911
Pick up, Frank. Pick up.

642
01:08:14,934 --> 01:08:17,596
I'm in Ibiza. Making holiday.

643
01:08:22,909 --> 01:08:25,173
<i>Someone hands me</i>
<i>glass of champagne.</i>

644
01:08:25,378 --> 01:08:27,175
<i>I drink.</i>

645
01:08:27,914 --> 01:08:30,382
<i>Then I don't feel so good.</i>

646
01:08:43,329 --> 01:08:46,457
<i>I go to bathroom, and next thing,</i>
<i>I'm awake in the car.</i>

647
01:08:47,667 --> 01:08:51,467
I ask him, "Where is this?"
He tells me he's just a transporter.

648
01:08:55,341 --> 01:08:57,707
He's pretty good driver.

649
01:08:58,645 --> 01:09:00,806
Not like you good.

650
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:07,717
I tell him, "Please.
My father a really powerful man.

651
01:09:07,921 --> 01:09:12,290
Big influence. Knows a lot of people.
Let me call him."

652
01:09:12,692 --> 01:09:15,024
<i>He's afraid.</i>
<i>He's never done this before.</i>

653
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:20,391
It's supposed to be simple.
Pick up, drop off. Easy money.

654
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,933
He's been told no calls,
never leave car.

655
01:09:24,571 --> 01:09:26,300
But I convince him.

656
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:29,835
<i>I call.</i>

657
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:32,740
<i>But before I say to my father</i>
<i>where we are...</i>

658
01:09:32,946 --> 01:09:34,243
Inside the car. Come on!

659
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,581
<i>We get away, but...</i>

660
01:09:45,758 --> 01:09:48,386
There's people shooting at us. Why?

661
01:09:48,595 --> 01:09:50,756
Why they shooting at us?

662
01:09:50,964 --> 01:09:55,867
He says they shoot because
we didn't go according to plan.

663
01:09:56,236 --> 01:10:00,696
I said, "Okay, that's the old plan.
What's new plan?"

664
01:10:00,907 --> 01:10:03,205
He says he has a friend.

665
01:10:12,118 --> 01:10:14,416
And then I met you.

666
01:10:17,223 --> 01:10:19,885
And then I feel it's gonna be okay.

667
01:10:24,497 --> 01:10:26,727
You didn't even know me.

668
01:10:27,467 --> 01:10:28,866
Of course I don't know you.

669
01:10:29,068 --> 01:10:32,560
I talk about feelings, not knowing.

670
01:10:34,707 --> 01:10:39,041
Well, if you was feeling that way, you
sure had a funny way of showing it.

671
01:10:39,812 --> 01:10:43,407
Better for a woman
to have a little mystery to her.

672
01:10:43,616 --> 01:10:45,083
No?

673
01:10:46,653 --> 01:10:48,143
No.

674
01:10:48,655 --> 01:10:51,954
Yes. Just a little.

675
01:11:18,384 --> 01:11:20,545
He's back on the radar, sir.

676
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:27,491
- Yeah.
- Where the hell are you?

677
01:11:27,694 --> 01:11:28,888
On the way to Bucharest.

678
01:11:29,228 --> 01:11:30,627
Not any longer.

679
01:11:32,699 --> 01:11:36,294
New coordinates: 3-7-13.

680
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,003
Excuse me, Mr. Minister.

681
01:12:16,676 --> 01:12:18,837
Sorry, just a minute.

682
01:12:19,045 --> 01:12:21,138
Inspector Tarconi, from Marseilles.

683
01:12:22,749 --> 01:12:25,013
Well, not exactly Marseilles...

684
01:12:25,218 --> 01:12:28,153
...but a small town to the east...
- What do you want, inspector?

685
01:12:28,354 --> 01:12:30,015
- A word with you.
- I have no time.

686
01:12:31,024 --> 01:12:32,491
It's about your daughter.

687
01:12:40,767 --> 01:12:44,362
Odessa, Frank. My country.

688
01:12:45,038 --> 01:12:48,132
You take me home. Thank you.

689
01:12:50,209 --> 01:12:52,109
What happened to Bucharest?

690
01:12:53,713 --> 01:12:58,548
- Change of plans.
- It's a good change. I prefer Odessa.

691
01:12:59,218 --> 01:13:00,810
Yeah.

692
01:13:01,754 --> 01:13:04,882
I was looking forward to that fish
with the carrots myself.

693
01:13:05,091 --> 01:13:07,082
Oh, it's much better here.

694
01:13:07,293 --> 01:13:10,387
- You know chicken Kiev?
- I do.

695
01:13:10,596 --> 01:13:12,791
I know restaurant here.

696
01:13:12,999 --> 01:13:14,330
Best in the world.

697
01:13:14,534 --> 01:13:18,868
The chicken's so fresh.
And the butter, when it's coming out...

698
01:13:19,072 --> 01:13:21,199
Like you cannot believe, it's so nice.

699
01:13:26,913 --> 01:13:29,347
You know what I feel like now?

700
01:13:32,018 --> 01:13:33,679
Hungry.

701
01:13:36,823 --> 01:13:38,552
Safe.

702
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:51,034
It's going to end up like the movies,
this happily ever after?

703
01:13:54,707 --> 01:13:57,335
By tonight, this is all
gonna be a fading memory.

704
01:13:57,810 --> 01:14:01,803
It's gonna be you and me,
laughing over chicken Kiev.

705
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:05,448
Liar.

706
01:14:23,569 --> 01:14:25,662
<i>Mr. Minister, an update, please.</i>

707
01:14:27,373 --> 01:14:31,810
I am ready to sign the contract
once I speak to my daughter.

708
01:14:33,646 --> 01:14:36,513
Hello? Hello?

709
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:39,711
Have that pen ready.
I'll call you back.

710
01:14:48,361 --> 01:14:50,522
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- We are closing the noose, Frank.

711
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:54,463
Well, when it closes, make sure
no one tries to drag me out of the car.

712
01:14:54,667 --> 01:14:56,191
You know what this is about yet?

713
01:14:57,436 --> 01:14:59,927
The girl. Her father.

714
01:15:00,273 --> 01:15:02,798
Large amounts of toxic waste.

715
01:15:03,009 --> 01:15:05,341
It is a trade.
His signature for her life.

716
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:10,139
I have a reputation
to uphold here, inspector.

717
01:15:10,349 --> 01:15:13,580
One hundred percent
successful delivery rate.

718
01:15:13,786 --> 01:15:17,244
Am I detecting a little attachment?

719
01:15:17,757 --> 01:15:23,024
That is not the Frank I know. With his
rules, no names, no attachment.

720
01:15:23,229 --> 01:15:25,424
Why is everyone so concerned
about my rules?

721
01:15:26,132 --> 01:15:31,729
Frank, I always suspected
you are a romantic at heart.

722
01:15:33,706 --> 01:15:34,695
Anything else?

723
01:15:35,908 --> 01:15:37,569
<i>Where is the rendezvous?</i>

724
01:15:37,777 --> 01:15:39,711
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

725
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:47,078
- Yeah.
- We're almost at the end, Frank.

726
01:15:47,286 --> 01:15:49,846
- <i>Just give me the coordinates.</i>
- No more coordinates.

727
01:15:50,556 --> 01:15:52,547
The road you're on.

728
01:15:52,892 --> 01:15:54,223
Make your first left.

729
01:15:55,027 --> 01:15:56,517
I'd like to know where I'm going.

730
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,768
You'll know when you get there.

731
01:16:33,799 --> 01:16:36,063
Don't worry. We got them
right where we want them.

732
01:16:43,009 --> 01:16:44,977
My compliments, Frank.

733
01:16:45,177 --> 01:16:48,806
Our trust in your abilities
was well deserved.

734
01:16:49,382 --> 01:16:51,145
<i>If you could please</i>
<i>send the girl out.</i>

735
01:16:52,852 --> 01:16:54,342
She's coming.

736
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,813
I'm not coming.

737
01:16:57,523 --> 01:16:59,650
They need you. They won't kill you.

738
01:16:59,859 --> 01:17:02,191
But they will kill you.

739
01:17:02,695 --> 01:17:05,960
Do I look like a man who came halfway
across Europe to die on a bridge?

740
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,189
Do I?

741
01:17:18,477 --> 01:17:20,945
We don't have all day, Frank.

742
01:17:24,784 --> 01:17:26,342
Look how many of them.

743
01:17:26,552 --> 01:17:28,486
They have all the guns.

744
01:17:28,688 --> 01:17:29,848
How it's gonna be okay?

745
01:17:34,026 --> 01:17:35,323
Tell you over dinner.

746
01:17:36,996 --> 01:17:38,190
Now, go.

747
01:17:39,165 --> 01:17:40,393
Go.

748
01:17:40,599 --> 01:17:42,328
Kiss me.

749
01:17:59,218 --> 01:18:00,708
Go.

750
01:18:05,591 --> 01:18:08,151
You're gonna get me killed. Now, go.

751
01:18:32,852 --> 01:18:35,047
Get to her, you bastard.

752
01:19:00,413 --> 01:19:02,472
Better now, darling?

753
01:19:20,933 --> 01:19:22,423
Finish him.

754
01:19:41,954 --> 01:19:44,252
No! Frank!

755
01:19:55,534 --> 01:19:58,025
His beloved car will be his grave.

756
01:19:58,237 --> 01:20:01,104
Leaves it, he blows. Stays, he drowns.
Let's get out of here.

757
01:20:12,351 --> 01:20:14,342
- Tarconi.
- They have the girl.

758
01:20:15,621 --> 01:20:19,057
Frank, we are trying to track him
through the phone signal.

759
01:20:19,258 --> 01:20:21,488
- Where are you?
- In a lake.

760
01:20:22,728 --> 01:20:24,355
A lake?

761
01:20:24,864 --> 01:20:26,729
Can you be more specific?

762
01:20:26,932 --> 01:20:28,194
There's a dam.

763
01:20:29,869 --> 01:20:31,803
- A dam?
- I know the place, sir.

764
01:20:32,004 --> 01:20:33,801
- How far?
- Ten minutes at least.

765
01:20:34,039 --> 01:20:35,870
Frank, we'll be there in 10 minutes.

766
01:20:36,075 --> 01:20:37,372
Can you make it any faster?

767
01:20:37,843 --> 01:20:40,141
- We'll do our best.
- Thank you.

768
01:22:38,597 --> 01:22:40,087
Buy tickets for all of us.

769
01:22:40,699 --> 01:22:42,098
Where to?

770
01:22:42,301 --> 01:22:46,237
Anywhere this train is going. We need
to keep moving for half an hour.

771
01:22:46,438 --> 01:22:48,372
Why don't we just keep
driving around?

772
01:22:54,013 --> 01:22:55,412
Another day.

773
01:23:09,928 --> 01:23:12,419
Sir! There!

774
01:23:29,648 --> 01:23:33,778
- Out. Out!
- Everybody out!

775
01:23:34,019 --> 01:23:35,418
- Come on.
- Move!

776
01:23:36,188 --> 01:23:37,712
Move, quick!

777
01:23:55,708 --> 01:23:57,369
- Mr. Minister?
- Yes.

778
01:23:58,010 --> 01:23:59,705
Someone wants to talk to you.

779
01:24:01,046 --> 01:24:03,708
- Papa.
- Are you all right?

780
01:24:08,287 --> 01:24:09,948
Don't sign.

781
01:24:10,656 --> 01:24:13,716
What you have is 15 minutes.

782
01:24:20,999 --> 01:24:23,695
- You ever find out what this is about?
- Garbage.

783
01:24:23,902 --> 01:24:25,426
How much garbage are we talking?

784
01:24:26,371 --> 01:24:29,932
Enough to pollute half the country
for a hundred years.

785
01:24:30,142 --> 01:24:31,131
Try it again.

786
01:24:51,864 --> 01:24:55,197
For a modern woman,
you are very uninformed.

787
01:24:55,467 --> 01:24:57,128
This is the new world.

788
01:24:58,303 --> 01:25:00,567
There are no more countries.
That's old think.

789
01:25:01,006 --> 01:25:04,373
There are just economic realities.
Profit and loss.

790
01:25:04,576 --> 01:25:07,306
Efficiency and waste.

791
01:25:07,513 --> 01:25:09,504
Think global, not local.

792
01:25:10,315 --> 01:25:12,249
Think this.

793
01:25:27,065 --> 01:25:29,033
- Yes?
- Where are we?

794
01:25:36,642 --> 01:25:38,132
We're almost there.

795
01:25:40,779 --> 01:25:42,144
Where?

796
01:25:42,347 --> 01:25:44,372
Here. He is on a train.

797
01:25:45,017 --> 01:25:47,349
- And where are we?
- Here.

798
01:25:47,553 --> 01:25:49,748
We can get units there.

799
01:25:51,423 --> 01:25:53,220
That's a good idea. Do that.

800
01:25:57,196 --> 01:26:00,029
Oh, Frank, come on.

801
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:34,490
Mr. Minister, I assure you,
everything is in order.

802
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:36,565
I'm sure it is.

803
01:26:37,002 --> 01:26:40,836
- If there are any problems...
- I know you will solve them.

804
01:26:41,773 --> 01:26:43,673
Now, if you don't mind...

805
01:27:14,072 --> 01:27:17,599
You might not believe this,
but I am, at heart, a pacifist.

806
01:27:18,877 --> 01:27:20,936
I hate violence.

807
01:27:22,948 --> 01:27:25,746
It creates more problems
than it solves.

808
01:27:27,386 --> 01:27:30,219
You know, I never wanted
to do any of this.

809
01:27:31,723 --> 01:27:34,783
A client asked me to obtain a result...

810
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:37,353
...so I went about creating
an environment...

811
01:27:37,562 --> 01:27:39,325
...with the least amount
of bloodshed.

812
01:27:39,531 --> 01:27:42,261
No one wanted to cooperate.
Not you, not the first driver...

813
01:27:42,467 --> 01:27:46,233
...not your father, not the
recently deceased Frank Martin.

814
01:27:47,372 --> 01:27:49,932
Everyone wanted to fight.

815
01:28:05,324 --> 01:28:06,518
What's so funny?

816
01:28:07,759 --> 01:28:10,250
Hearing a dead man talking.

817
01:30:23,128 --> 01:30:25,062
One more step, Frank.

818
01:30:25,497 --> 01:30:27,021
Come on. One more.

819
01:31:10,642 --> 01:31:12,075
Look.

820
01:31:12,444 --> 01:31:13,468
It's over.

821
01:31:14,379 --> 01:31:16,040
Two minutes to 9. He signed.

822
01:31:19,851 --> 01:31:21,944
Oh, my God.

823
01:31:27,225 --> 01:31:28,658
No, Frank. No, no.

824
01:32:09,668 --> 01:32:12,102
It's over, Frank. It's over.

825
01:32:13,371 --> 01:32:15,839
Mission accomplished.
You and the girl are free to go.

826
01:32:17,442 --> 01:32:19,774
Matter of fact,
I'm so impressed by your talent...

827
01:32:19,978 --> 01:32:21,639
...l'd like to offer you a position.

828
01:32:21,846 --> 01:32:25,145
I'd like to offer you one.
Permanently disabled.

829
01:32:44,436 --> 01:32:45,767
I hate to waste talent.

830
01:32:45,971 --> 01:32:48,269
But I really don't think
we'd make a very good fit.

831
01:32:48,473 --> 01:32:49,963
That's right.

832
01:33:13,765 --> 01:33:14,857
No!

833
01:33:18,803 --> 01:33:21,966
We wouldn't fit, but you and the
bracelet were made for each other.

834
01:33:26,544 --> 01:33:27,806
No, no.

835
01:33:39,124 --> 01:33:40,148
No!

836
01:33:41,793 --> 01:33:43,021
No!

837
01:33:58,743 --> 01:34:00,608
You're doing the right thing.

838
01:34:20,465 --> 01:34:22,194
Valentina.

839
01:34:27,339 --> 01:34:28,567
Valentina.

840
01:34:38,883 --> 01:34:41,010
Am I in heaven?

841
01:34:44,155 --> 01:34:46,419
Looks more like we're in hell.

842
01:34:46,925 --> 01:34:48,722
I don't care.

843
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:50,721
As long as we're there together.

844
01:35:03,074 --> 01:35:04,132
Yes?

845
01:35:04,342 --> 01:35:07,505
Mr. Minister,
your daughter is in good hands.

846
01:35:09,013 --> 01:35:10,605
Thank you.

847
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:27,530
- What are you doing?
- What you said, the right thing.

848
01:35:27,732 --> 01:35:30,963
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a conference to address...

849
01:35:31,169 --> 01:35:34,104
...on the dangers of doing business
with people like you.

850
01:35:34,305 --> 01:35:35,294
Thank you very much.

851
01:35:54,492 --> 01:35:55,516
Is the launch ready?

852
01:35:55,727 --> 01:35:58,059
- It's on the water, sir, waiting.
- Time to leave.

853
01:35:58,797 --> 01:36:00,128
- Grab the log.
- Okay.

854
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:22,117
I just don't understand it.

855
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,288
When I was a boy, my father and I...

856
01:36:24,489 --> 01:36:27,822
...used to pull fish out of
this very spot all day long.

857
01:36:28,026 --> 01:36:29,653
Times change, inspector.

858
01:36:30,261 --> 01:36:31,990
As do people.

859
01:36:34,999 --> 01:36:36,933
You referring to me?

860
01:36:38,503 --> 01:36:40,596
I don't think that's
a very accurate statement.

861
01:36:41,539 --> 01:36:43,769
I drive the same car,
live in the same house.

862
01:36:43,975 --> 01:36:48,105
Oh, I was not referring
to your car or your house.

863
01:36:50,982 --> 01:36:53,348
The sea is so restful.

864
01:36:53,551 --> 01:36:54,711
Is lunch ready yet?

865
01:36:55,987 --> 01:36:59,286
Mademoiselle, there is
a certain progression to things.

866
01:36:59,491 --> 01:37:02,824
In order to eat the lunch,
you first have to catch the lunch.

867
01:37:03,027 --> 01:37:05,257
And if we keep talking
instead of concentrating...

868
01:37:05,463 --> 01:37:06,794
...we're gonna catch nothing.

869
01:37:06,998 --> 01:37:10,729
I have better idea. Why we
don't skip catching of lunch...

870
01:37:10,935 --> 01:37:12,869
...and go right to eating of lunch?

871
01:37:13,071 --> 01:37:16,234
I know wonderful place
just up coast from here...

872
01:37:16,441 --> 01:37:19,342
...where they make fish stew.
Incredible.
