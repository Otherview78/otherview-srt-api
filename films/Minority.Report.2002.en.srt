1
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,222
<i>You know how blind I am without them.</i>

2
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,015
<i>Howard, don't cry.</i>

3
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:01,414
Murder.

4
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,073
Good luck, John.

5
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:39,285
- Any contractions?
- Only the ones you give me.

6
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,217
Okay, Jad, what's coming?

7
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:58,054
Red Ball, double homicide,
one male, one female.

8
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,222
Killer's male, white, 40s.

9
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:02,683
Agatha nailed the time frame
at 8:04 a.m.

10
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:05,519
The twins are a little fuzzy on that,
so we'll need confirmation.

11
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,856
Location's still uncertain.
Remote witnesses are plugged in.

12
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,150
This will be case number 1108.

13
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,407
Good morning, detectives.

14
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,370
Case number 1108,
previsualized by the Precogs,

15
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:24,872
recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's q-stacks.

16
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,999
My fellow witnesses
for case number 1108

17
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,001
are Dr. Katherine James
and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

18
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,127
Good morning.

19
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,212
<i>-Good morning.
- Good morning.</i>

20
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,423
Will the witnesses preview
and validate number 1108 at this time?

21
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:37,968
<i>-Affirmative. I will validate.
- Go get him.</i>

22
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,222
- Stand by.
- Time of murder, 8:04 a.m.

23
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,724
That is 24 minutes, 13 seconds
from now.

24
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:45,518
This is a Red Ball.

25
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:14,171
<i>You know how blind I am without them.</i>

26
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,551
All right, Howard Marks, where are you?

27
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,221
Howard? Howard, breakfast!

28
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:41,198
"Four score and seven years ago..."

29
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:44,368
- He looked familiar.
- Who?

30
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:49,457
A man standing in the park
across the street. I've seen him before.

31
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,959
How can you even tell? You know
how blind you are without your glasses.

32
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,127
Where are your glasses?

33
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,837
I must have left them up in the bedroom.

34
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,130
You are running out of time.

35
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,299
<i>You know how blind I am...</i>

36
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,317
I show eight Howard Marks
in the District. Sorting by race and age.

37
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,110
Run their license and registration.

38
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:22,573
- See if I can capture an address here.
- <i>You are running out of time.</i>

39
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,493
<i>You know, I was thinking
maybe I'd play hooky, stay home today.</i>

40
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:29,121
<i>-What about your meeting?
- I've been working too much.</i>

41
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:31,540
- Can you grab that?
- It's unclear.

42
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,878
I got six licenses.
Where do you want them?

43
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,630
Over here, please.

44
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,600
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

45
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,819
<i>You know how blind I am without them.</i>

46
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,994
Got him in the Foxhall,
4421 Gainsborough.

47
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,496
Send a DCPD blue-and-white.

48
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,331
Set up a perimeter,
and tell them we're en route.

49
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:16,126
You know, I was thinking
maybe I'd play hooky, stay home today.

50
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,338
"We have come
to dedicate a portion of that field..."

51
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,423
- What do you think?
- "...as a final resting place..."

52
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,884
- What about your meeting?
- I'll reschedule.

53
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,261
I've been working too much anyway.

54
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,638
"...is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this."

55
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,683
- "But in a larger sense..." Good.
- We could have lunch together.

56
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:31,850
- What do you say?
- "We cannot consecrate.

57
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,352
"We cannot hallow this ground."

58
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,062
- Any place you want.
- I would love... I would love to.

59
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,605
"The brave men, living and dead..."

60
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:39,316
I have an open house
at the Ressler place.

61
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,487
"...have consecrated it far above
our poor power to add or detract."

62
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,699
I guess that's why you look so nice.

63
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,660
Chief!

64
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,663
We got a problem with our location.

65
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,961
- It's no longer there.
- Shit.

66
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,171
- Time frame?
- Thirteen minutes.

67
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,257
Investigator from the Fed's here.

68
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,509
Yeah, I don't need some twink
from the Fed poking around right now.

69
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:06,594
John, I wrote it down on your calendar.

70
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:07,720
I left you a message at your house.

71
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,054
Check in with the papers.
They had it forwarded.

72
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:10,097
See if the neighbors knew
where they went.

73
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,932
- Check all relations.
- Checking neighbors and relations.

74
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:14,310
- But, John...
- Fletch, just get him some coffee.

75
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,061
Tell him some stories
how I save your ass every day

76
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,439
- and you can't live without me.
- I got coffee, thank you.

77
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,442
Danny Witwer, the twink from the Fed.

78
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,444
Gum?

79
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,946
Sorry, Danny, I'm gonna have to give you
the full tour some other time.

80
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,364
The Markses moved
a couple of weeks ago,

81
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,117
nobody knows where.
Still searching for family and employer.

82
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,202
Time Horizon, 12 minutes.

83
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,246
All right. What he's doing now,
we call "scrubbing the image,"

84
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,790
looking for clues
as to where the murder's gonna happen.

85
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:40,669
Original running bond brick pattern,
streamlined early Georgian details...

86
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,171
The brick has been re-pointed.

87
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,840
- And, "That this nation..."
- "This nation..."

88
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,133
- "...under God..."
- "...under God..."

89
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,135
"...shall not perish from the Earth."

90
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,721
Victims are pronounced here,
killers here.

91
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,598
Beyond that and the date of the crime,

92
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,601
all we have to run on are the images
that they produce.

93
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,738
I show a cop on horseback.

94
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,282
- Near the Capitol?
- No Maglev system.

95
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:11,617
The Mall?

96
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,911
Georgetown.

97
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:17,122
The Precogs can see a murder
four days out. Why the late call?

98
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,457
Well, we call it a Red Ball.

99
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,334
With crimes of passion
there's no premeditation,

100
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,585
so they show up late.

101
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,879
Most of our scrambles are flash events,
like this one.

102
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,340
We rarely see anything
with premeditation anymore.

103
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,634
People have gotten the message.

104
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,052
This is good.

105
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,930
I show a match for Dwight Kingsley,
18th-century architect.

106
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,556
He did two dozen houses in D.C.

107
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,934
- Time Horizon, 10 minutes.
- Ten minutes.

108
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:47,653
Look at this kid. In this one, he's
on the left side of the man in the suit.

109
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,656
- Yes, so?
- This one he is on the right.

110
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,592
Merry-go-round.

111
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,594
It's a park!

112
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,727
<i>Tell me there's only 16 of these
old merry-go-rounds left in the city.</i>

113
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,228
<i>Two in Georgetown,
one in Barnaby Woods.</i>

114
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,354
<i>The other's in Woodley.</i>

115
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:24,231
Woodley's all Victorian.
It's gotta be Barnaby Woods.

116
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,858
- Evanna, flight time?
- The way I drive,

117
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:27,985
three minutes after wheels up.

118
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,416
- Clear.
- Clear.

119
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,667
- Clear.
- Clear.

120
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,105
Time Horizon, six minutes.

121
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:35,105
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

122
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,352
Let's go to bed.

123
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,938
Let's do it in here.

124
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:50,359
- The bed is soft.
- I'm soft.

125
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,115
Shit!

126
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,535
Which one is it?

127
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,792
- Don't stop!
- Not the bed!

128
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:52,754
- Come on, come on.
- I don't want to be on the bed!

129
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,969
Time Horizon, one minute.
Chief, we're catching up to the future.

130
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,804
Shut up, Evanna. Jad?

131
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,557
- <i>Jad?</i>
- Go ahead.

132
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,560
- <i>Did he close the front door?</i>
- What?

133
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,021
Did Marks close the front door?

134
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,780
Front door.

135
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,369
I didn't want to be on the bed.

136
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,751
Negative. The front door is open.

137
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,754
<i>-The front door is open.
- Time Horizon, 30 seconds.</i>

138
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:44,973
- I forgot my glasses.
- Howard!

139
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:52,522
No, no, no, Howard.

140
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,029
You know how blind I am without them.

141
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,907
Howard, don't cry.

142
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:03,742
Marks!

143
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,930
Look at me. Look at me.

144
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,645
Positive for Howard Marks.

145
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:35,983
Mr. Marks, by mandate of the
District of Columbia Precrime Division,

146
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,150
I'm placing you under arrest

147
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,860
for the future murder of Sarah Marks
and Donald Dubin

148
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:42,948
that was to take place today,
April 22nd, at 0804.

149
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,825
No! I didn't do anything.

150
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,661
- Sarah!
- Give the man his hat.

151
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:51,790
Oh, God.
Don't put that halo on me! Sarah!

152
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,334
- Put your hand on your head!
- Help me!

153
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,336
I wasn't gonna do anything!

154
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,506
<i>Officer Scott, I'm with the
Precrime Trauma Response Unit.</i>

155
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,967
<i>I want you to sit here a minute
and listen to me.</i>

156
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,178
<i>Your husband is being arrested
by officers from Precrime.</i>

157
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,055
Oh, God, Howard, no!

158
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,017
Howard, don't cry.

159
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,185
Howard, don't cry.

160
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,482
Howard, please don't cry.

161
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,526
Oh, God. Oh, God.

162
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,615
I thought they stopped the murder.

163
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,411
Well, that's just an echo,
a Precog déjá vu, if you will.

164
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:33,290
The really bad ones, the Precogs
see them over and over again.

165
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,417
Wally, erase the incoming.

166
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:53,226
<i>Imagine a world without murder.</i>

167
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,521
<i>-I lost my best friend.
- I lost my aunt.</i>

168
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:57,731
<i>-I lost my dad.
- I lost my father.</i>

169
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,815
<i>I lost my wife.</i>

170
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,526
<i>Just six years ago,
the homicide rate in this country</i>

171
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,612
<i>had reached epidemic proportions.</i>

172
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,740
<i>It seemed that only a miracle
could stop the bloodshed.</i>

173
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:11,328
<i>But instead of one miracle,
we were given three, the Precognitives.</i>

174
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,247
<i>Within just one month
under the Precrime program,</i>

175
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:18,043
<i>the murder rate in the
District of Columbia was reduced 90%.</i>

176
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,503
<i>They were gonna be waiting for me
in the car.</i>

177
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,587
<i>He was gonna rape me.</i>

178
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,255
<i>-I was going to be stabbed.
- Right here.</i>

179
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:27,219
<i>Within a year, Precrime effectively
stopped murder in our nation's capital.</i>

180
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,347
<i>In the six years we've been conducting
our little experiment,</i>

181
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,016
<i>there hasn't been a single murder.</i>

182
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,602
<i>And now Precrime can work for you.</i>

183
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,271
<i>We want to make absolutely certain</i>

184
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:42,150
<i>that every American can bank on
the utter infallibility of the system,</i>

185
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:46,905
<i>and to ensure that what keeps us safe
will also keep us free.</i>

186
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,118
<i>-Precrime, it works.
- It works.</i>

187
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,577
<i>-It works.
- It works.</i>

188
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,621
<i>-It works.
- It works.</i>

189
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,582
<i>-Precrime, it works!
- Precrime, it works!</i>

190
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:02,462
<i>On Tuesday, April 22nd, vote yes
on the National Precrime Initiative.</i>

191
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,343
What's the matter? Can't sleep?

192
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,644
- I just need a little clarity.
- True, true, true, true, that.

193
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:22,899
You want the customary clarity
or the new-and-improved kind of clarity?

194
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,651
Just give me the new stuff.

195
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:28,405
New and improved.
New and improved clarity, clarity, clarity.

196
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,490
Yes, indeed, clarity.

197
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,325
Come on, come on.
I just want a hit.

198
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,451
Look, don't bust my balls.

199
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,871
You just gave me four,
and some of these are duds.

200
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,831
Sweet dreams, Chief.

201
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:43,128
Don't worry none,
your secret's safe with me.

202
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,006
Besides, I could use a little juice
on my side.

203
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,300
What do you think you know, Lycon?

204
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,720
It's like my daddy used to say,

205
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,306
"In the land of the blind,

206
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:59,519
"the one-eyed man is king."

207
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,959
I'm home.

208
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,844
Overhead.

209
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:30,860
Wall screen.

210
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,953
<i>-Sean!
- Hi, Daddy.</i>

211
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,372
<i>Can you teach me how to run faster?</i>

212
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,042
<i>'Cause all the kids in my class
run faster than me.</i>

213
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,461
<i>No. That's good.</i>

214
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:52,173
- Look, keep your knees up.
- <i>Keep your knees up like that. Good.</i>

215
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,300
- Like that.
- <i>Like that.</i>

216
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,885
- Like that. High. High. Like that.
- <i>Like that. High.</i>

217
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:59,097
- See, you're a natural runner.
- <i>Gotta keep running!</i>

218
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,392
Gotta keep running.

219
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,478
- You gotta keep running.
- <i>You gotta keep running.</i>

220
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:08,189
<i>Will I be as fast as you someday?</i>

221
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,233
I think you'll beat me someday.

222
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,945
- <i>You're gonna beat everybody.</i>
- I think you'll beat everyone someday.

223
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:17,365
- <i>I gotta go. Bye.</i>
- No, no, no. No, no, no. Wait, wait.

224
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:20,702
- You gotta give me a kiss.
- <i>Not on the lips!</i>

225
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,621
<i>Only Mommy kisses me on the lips.</i>

226
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,041
<i>Yeah. All right, all right, all right.</i>

227
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,500
I love you.

228
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:31,421
- I <i>love you, Sean.</i>
- I love you, Daddy.

229
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,167
<i>It reminds me of Rosarito Beach.</i>

230
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,128
<i>Remember?</i>

231
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,173
<i>Yeah, we had those... We had $20,</i>

232
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:19,928
<i>and waiting in the van
so the sun would shine on our vacation.</i>

233
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,933
<i>John! John.</i>

234
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,270
<i>John, put the camera down. Look, I'm...
I'm all ready for bed.</i>

235
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,564
<i>What... What is this? No.</i>

236
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,567
<i>Put it away.
It's time to put the camera to sleep,</i>

237
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,570
<i>and time to come
and take care of your wife.</i>

238
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,909
<i>Sweetie, why don't you
put the camera down</i>

239
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,328
<i>and come and watch the rain with me?</i>

240
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,458
<i>No? I promise I'll make it
a memorable moment.</i>

241
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:58,258
<i>Look, put the camera down,
or you're not getting anything tonight.</i>

242
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,552
A gentleman at Justice wants
to take all this away from us.

243
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,138
You understand a week from now
people are going to vote

244
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,015
on whether or not
what we've been doing down here

245
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,392
has been
some noble-minded enterprise,

246
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,353
or a chance to change the way
this country fights crime.

247
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,439
- I understand, sir.
- John.

248
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,400
Watch this Danny Witwer,

249
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,862
- the observer from Justice.
- Yes, I met him yesterday.

250
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:04,491
You can let him look around,
answer his questions, but watch him.

251
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,242
- Yes, sir.
- And if there's any problem,

252
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,244
- make sure we know about it first.
- I understand.

253
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,663
When the Precogs declare
a victim and a killer,

254
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,624
their name is embedded
in the grain of wood.

255
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:15,376
Since each piece is unique,
the shape and grain is unique.

256
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,670
The shape and grain
is impossible to forge.

257
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:21,007
I'm sure you all understand the legalistic
drawback to Precrime methodology.

258
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,050
Here we go again.

259
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,260
Look, I'm not with the ACLU
on this, Jeff.

260
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,345
But let's not kid ourselves.

261
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,180
We are arresting individuals
who have broken no law.

262
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,182
- But they will.
- The commission of the crime itself

263
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,308
is absolute metaphysics.

264
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,519
The Precogs see the future,
and they're never wrong.

265
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:36,940
But it's not the future if you stop it.
Isn't that a fundamental paradox?

266
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,608
Yes, it is.

267
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,819
You're talking about predetermination,
which happens all the time.

268
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,034
- Why'd you catch that?
- Because it was going to fall.

269
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,619
- You're certain?
- Yeah.

270
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,121
But it didn't fall. You caught it.

271
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,041
The fact that
you prevented it from happening

272
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,126
doesn't change the fact
that it was going to happen.

273
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,420
You ever get any false positives?

274
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:02,966
Someone intends to kill his boss or his
wife, but they never go through with it.

275
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,968
How do the Precogs tell the difference?

276
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,846
The Precogs don't see what
you intend to do, only what you will do.

277
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,933
Then why can't they see rapes?
Or assaults or suicides?

278
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,394
Because of the nature of murder.

279
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,438
"There's nothing more destructive
to the metaphysical fabric that binds us

280
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:20,400
"than the untimely murder
of one human being by another."

281
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,985
Somehow, I don't think
that was Walt Whitman.

282
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,403
It's Iris Hineman.

283
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:27,198
She developed the Precogs, designed
the system and pioneered the interface.

284
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:29,993
Speaking of interfacing,
I'd love to say hello.

285
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,328
- To Hineman?
- To them.

286
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,457
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.

287
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,626
Really? You've never been inside?

288
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,422
We keep strict separations so that
no one can be accused of tampering.

289
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,174
So, I'll be the first one to go in, then?

290
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,094
- Maybe you didn't hear me.
- If it's a question of authority...

291
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:52,015
No, there is no question.
You don't have any.

292
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,561
I have a warrant in my pocket
that says different.

293
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:10,742
- Show it to me.
- Sure.

294
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,124
This investigation of Precrime
and its personnel

295
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,084
is being conducted
under the direct supervision

296
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:24,088
and express permission from the
Attorney General of the United States.

297
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:26,132
I'm here as his representative,

298
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:30,303
which means you're now operating
under my supervision.

299
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,685
Seems you've been
left out of the loop, John.

300
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,073
All right, we're ready. Let's go.

301
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,122
Hold it right there. Hold it.

302
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,416
<i>Not cleared for access.</i>

303
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,712
<i>Eye-dent, John Anderton. Approved.</i>

304
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,596
- Wally.
- No, no, no, no.

305
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,014
It's okay. This is Danny Witwer.

306
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,266
He's from Justice.
We're to give him the run of the farm.

307
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,351
I can't touch you.

308
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,603
- Don't touch him or anything else.
- John, you can't be in here...

309
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:23,773
I understand. Just answer his questions
and we'll get the hell out of here.

310
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,650
Tell me how...

311
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:29,612
- They're sleeping.
- Sorry. Tell me how all this works.

312
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:33,741
The photon milk acts as both
a nutrient supply and a liquid conductor.

313
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:36,452
It enhances the images
that each of them receive.

314
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:40,248
We call the female Agatha.
The twins are Arthur and Dashiell.

315
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,376
We scan by way of optical tomography.

316
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,212
White-light pinpoints pulse
along the entire length of the headgear,

317
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,757
and they're reread after absorption
through their brain tissue.

318
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,927
In other words, we see what they see.

319
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,513
They don't feel any pain.

320
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,266
We keep their heads pretty well stocked
with dopamine and endorphins.

321
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:02,186
Plus, we maintain careful control
over their serotonin levels.

322
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,981
Don't want them to drift off
into too deep a sleep.

323
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,941
They can't be kept too awake, either.

324
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:10,153
It's better if
you don't think of them as human.

325
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,989
No. They're much more than that.

326
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,786
Science has stolen
most of our miracles.

327
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:25,042
In a way, they give us hope,
hope of the existence of the divine.

328
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:29,046
I find it interesting that some people
have begun to deify the Precogs.

329
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,257
The Precogs are
pattern-recognition filters, that's all.

330
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,761
- Yet you call this room "the temple."
- Just a nickname.

331
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:37,054
The oracle isn't
where the power is, anyway.

332
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:38,765
The power's always been
with the priests,

333
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:41,517
even if they had to invent the oracle.

334
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:46,481
You guys are nodding like you actually
know what the hell he's talking about.

335
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:50,067
Well, come on, Chief. The way we work,
changing destiny and all,

336
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:53,279
I mean,
we're more like clergy than cops.

337
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,114
- Jad?
- Yeah?

338
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:57,784
Go to work. All of you.

339
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:09,212
Sorry. Old habit.

340
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,715
I spent three years at Fuller Seminary
before I became a cop.

341
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,550
My father was very proud.

342
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,427
What does he think
of your chosen line of work?

343
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,596
I don't know.
He was shot and killed when I was 15

344
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,265
on the steps of our church in Dublin.

345
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:24,060
I know what it's like
to lose someone close, John.

346
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,395
Of course,
nothing is like the loss of a child.

347
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,688
I don't have any children of my own,

348
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:31,108
so I can only imagine
what that must have been like.

349
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:34,654
To lose your son
in such a public place like that.

350
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,531
At least now you and I have
the chance to make sure

351
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,157
that kind of thing
doesn't happen to anyone.

352
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,909
Why don't you cut the cute act,
Danny Boy, and tell me

353
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,495
- exactly what it is you're looking for.
- Flaws.

354
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,663
There hasn't been a murder in six years.

355
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,331
There's nothing wrong with the system.
It is...

356
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:49,252
Perfect. I agree.
If there's a flaw, it's human.

357
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:52,004
It always is.

358
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:54,465
John.

359
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,968
Wally.

360
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:47,935
Can you see?

361
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,887
John, what the hell just happened?

362
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,513
Her ACTH levels
just shot through the roof!

363
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,766
- What did you do to her?
- She grabbed me.

364
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,185
Grabbed you? That's impossible.
The Precogs aren't even aware of us.

365
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,021
- In the milk, all they see is the future.
- She looked straight at me.

366
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,147
It could have been a nightmare.

367
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,107
Sometimes they dream
about the old murders.

368
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:37,193
- She spoke to me.
- To you?

369
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:41,530
- What'd she say?
- "Can you see?"

370
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,720
You the Sentry?

371
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,223
Yes, sir! I'm Gideon.

372
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:10,726
You're Chief Anderton.

373
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,604
The music relaxes the prisoners.

374
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:15,731
Say, I don't ever see
any of you Precops down here.

375
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:18,567
- I'm not in trouble, am I?
- Not yet.

376
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:23,155
- I'm interested in a murder.
- I got plenty of those. Kill type?

377
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,741
- Drowning.
- That narrows it down.

378
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:27,368
Not too many in here for that one.

379
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:31,122
- Victim's Caucasian, female.
- This about the Justice Department?

380
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,958
I'm supposed to spruce up
for a tour they got planned for tomorrow.

381
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,793
Told me to wear a tie. You like this one?

382
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:36,961
Stop.

383
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,924
Roll back.

384
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,011
There.

385
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:49,765
She's a golden oldie. One of our first.
Probably before your time.

386
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,310
This is the official composite
of the three Precogs?

387
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:58,774
That's right! A combined data stream
based on all three previsions.

388
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,985
Just show me Agatha's data stream.

389
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,319
For that,

390
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,781
we go for a ride.

391
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:31,432
My God.
I'd forgotten there were so many.

392
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:36,771
And to think they'd all be out there
killing people if it wasn't for you.

393
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,566
Look at them.
Look at how peaceful they all seem.

394
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,944
But on the inside, busy, busy, busy.

395
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:48,991
Okey-pokey! Now that is one bad man.

396
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:52,787
He drowned a woman
named Anne Lively out at Roland Lake.

397
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,123
The killer's a John Doe.
Never identified.

398
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,308
Why is he still a John Doe?

399
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,477
Why wasn't he ever ID'd
from the eye-scan?

400
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,604
On account of those are not his eyes.

401
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,565
He had them swapped out
to fool the scanners.

402
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:25,611
You can get it done on the street
for a few thousand bucks these days.

403
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:29,657
Okay, so you want
just the female prevision.

404
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,200
That's right.

405
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:39,792
We don't seem to have her data.

406
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,045
Try again.

407
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,549
This is odd.

408
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:50,302
See? We have the two previsions.

409
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:53,430
We got what Art saw,
we got what Dash saw,

410
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:55,474
but Agatha's isn't here.

411
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,396
Probably just a glitch.

412
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,774
Tell me about the intended victim,
this Anne Lively.

413
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:09,155
Looks like she's a neuroin addict,
like our John Doe here,

414
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:12,575
but I show an address history
that includes the Beaton Clinic.

415
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,244
So she cleaned up.
So where's she now?

416
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,748
I guess glitches come in twos.

417
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:26,338
You finally crawl your way out
of one hole just to fall into another.

418
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:32,970
No.

419
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,765
I can't let you take that
out of here, Chief.

420
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,685
It's against the rules.

421
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,272
Anything else going on in here
that's against the rules?

422
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:53,324
Careful, Chief.
You dig up the past, all you get is dirty.

423
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:01,874
And then you said the third prevision
was, what, kind of fuzzy or something?

424
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:06,128
No. No, the third prevision,
Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.

425
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:08,047
That's not all.
I spent a few hours down there,

426
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:12,343
and there are a dozen more cases
with missing previsions.

427
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:15,304
You'd think we'd have found a cure
for the common cold by now.

428
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,765
- It's stress.
- What's this?

429
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,559
Herbal tea with honey.

430
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:23,729
I hate herbal tea,
almost as much as I hate honey.

431
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,774
Just drink it before I pour it in your lap.

432
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:29,777
- Can I get you anything, John?
- No, thank you, Celeste.

433
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,906
Witwer's scheduled for a Containment...
Tour of Containment tomorrow.

434
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,200
Yeah, give him a tour.

435
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,453
- Lara called me.
- What?

436
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:43,290
She's worried about you.
Quite frankly, so am I.

437
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,085
I'm fine.

438
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:49,838
I understand you've been spending
a lot of time in the sprawl.

439
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:54,343
- I go running down there.
- In the middle of the night?

440
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,720
What if Danny Witwer
came to you right now

441
00:34:56,804 --> 00:35:00,266
- and insisted on a full chem run?
- Lamar, I'm fine.

442
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:02,476
You understand, John,

443
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,980
the minute Precrime goes national,
they're going to take it away from us.

444
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,314
We won't let them.

445
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:11,986
No? How's an old man and a cop
on the whiff ever going to stop them?

446
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,823
My father once said to me,

447
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:20,035
"You don't choose the things
you believe in. They choose you."

448
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,329
There's a reason you are here, John.

449
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:24,873
Had Precrime been in place
just six months earlier,

450
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:28,377
the loss you and Lara suffered
would have been prevented.

451
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,254
Remember the eyes...

452
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:35,843
The eyes of the nation
are on us right now.

453
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:38,804
And we both know
I'm not the generation anyone listens to.

454
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,889
But people trust you, John.

455
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:44,059
When you speak
of your absolute belief in Precrime,

456
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:48,647
they know it's a belief born of pain,
not politics. I always understood that.

457
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:52,318
And I may have even encouraged it
to help with the cause.

458
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:58,032
But now, your pain is hurting both of us.

459
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:05,706
They're not gonna take it away from us.

460
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,416
I won't let them.

461
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,198
Bingo.

462
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:54,380
<i>-Hi, Daddy!
- Hey, little buddy.</i>

463
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,548
<i>-I made up a club.
- Yeah?</i>

464
00:36:56,632 --> 00:37:00,219
<i>-We're called the Crescos.
- The Crescos.</i>

465
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:03,138
<i>-We made up a soccer team...
- Yeah.</i>

466
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:06,183
<i>-...and we practice at school.
- Yeah? Do you practice with Connor?</i>

467
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,685
Daddy's in a lot of trouble, Sean.

468
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,379
<i>Wait.</i>

469
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,177
Jad, how come you're not out there
with Father Witwer?

470
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,930
We're in motion on something.
Now, from what I can see,

471
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:48,600
we got a white male victim,
about 5'10", approximately 170.

472
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:51,061
He takes a round in the 10-ring
and goes out a window.

473
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:53,105
- Red Ball?
- Nope, Brown Ball.

474
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,107
- This one's premeditated.
- Amazing.

475
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,901
There's someone within 200 miles
actually dumb enough to still do that.

476
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:02,406
Well, the victim's name is Leo Crow.
This is case number 1109.

477
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,783
Time of occurrence, Friday, 1506 hours.

478
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:07,411
Start a location run and a contact
search for future victim, Leo Crow.

479
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,122
Case number 1109,
previsualized by the Precogs,

480
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,749
recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's q-stacks.

481
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,793
My fellow witnesses
for case number 1109

482
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:17,337
are Dr. Katherine James
and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

483
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:18,422
Good morning.

484
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:19,506
<i>-Good morning.
- Good morning.</i>

485
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,800
Are the witnesses ready
to preview and validate number 1109?

486
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:23,886
<i>-Ready when you are, John.
- Standing by.</i>

487
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:32,394
I love this part.

488
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,231
I've got no address,
last known or otherwise,

489
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,650
no tax returns for the last five years.

490
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:41,320
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.

491
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:45,741
And send a protection team
as soon as we lock location.

492
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,788
Looks like federal housing.
Concrete, glass, egg crates.

493
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:54,708
Ouch.
About 1,000 of those in the District.

494
00:38:56,418 --> 00:39:00,255
Fractured images coming in.
Numbers nine...

495
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,635
Nine and six.

496
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:13,644
Female, senior. She's smoking a pipe.

497
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,396
She's laughing.

498
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,276
Okay, now inside a room.

499
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:25,030
Window panes, aluminum extrusion.

500
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:28,617
Two figures resolving in the room.

501
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,203
<i>Wait!</i>

502
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:37,834
Looks like we got a third party,

503
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:41,421
wearing sunglasses,
just out of the window.

504
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,216
You're not gonna kill me.

505
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:48,512
Goodbye, Crow.

506
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,602
<i>You're not gonna kill me.
You're not gonna kill me.</i>

507
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,814
<i>-Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait!</i>

508
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,319
Wait. Wait.

509
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:07,614
- You say something, Chief?
- No.

510
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,495
I'll get this one.

511
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:15,998
We got time on this one, Jad.

512
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:19,126
Mind going down and getting me a piece
of cake they're eating down there?

513
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,253
- I'm starving.
- Sure, Chief.

514
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:24,089
I think I'll get one for myself
while I'm at it.

515
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,716
Take your time.

516
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,653
<i>Chief Anderton,
what is this that I'm seeing?</i>

517
00:40:46,737 --> 00:40:48,530
<i>I'm confused about...</i>

518
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,730
<i>-Anderton, wait!
- Goodbye, Crow.</i>

519
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,649
<i>Wait! Anderton, wait!</i>

520
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:27,611
<i>Anderton, wait!</i>

521
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:36,912
I like you, Chief.
You've always been nice to me.

522
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,085
I'll give you two minutes
before I hit the alarm.

523
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,852
Hold that, please.

524
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:03,146
Thanks.

525
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,945
- You're in a lot of trouble, John.
- You set me up.

526
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:13,532
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff
you've been doping on all night.

527
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:17,035
- Easy. Easy.
- Seems I found a flaw.

528
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:20,956
What are you gonna do?

529
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,209
Possession alone will cost you
six months, not to mention your badge.

530
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,795
I guess
we won't be working together after all.

531
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:30,424
Now, put the gun down, John.
I don't hear a Red Ball.

532
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:53,989
<i>Lamar? Lamar?</i>

533
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,952
- <i>Lamar?</i>
- John, what the hell is happening?

534
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,829
- It's Witwer! He set me up!
- <i>What the hell is happening?</i>

535
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,080
- He set me up.
- Stop. Just wait.

536
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:04,124
- Who...
- He set me up. Witwer. It's Witwer!

537
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:05,792
Yeah, who's the victim?

538
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:08,128
- Somebody.
- <i>Who?</i>

539
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,921
- Somebody. Leo Crow.
- <i>Well, who is he?</i>

540
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:13,175
I have no idea! I've never heard of him!

541
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,761
But I'm supposed to kill him
in less than 36 hours.

542
00:43:15,886 --> 00:43:18,305
But how could Witwer
have access to case files?

543
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:19,931
Can you fake a cerebral output?

544
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:21,308
- Why would anyone want to?
- <i>Can you?</i>

545
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:24,060
- Well, I doubt it very much.
- Well, would Hineman know?

546
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,146
- Listen. Come in.
- <i>What?</i>

547
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,774
Well, I'll keep you safe
until we get to the bottom of this, John.

548
00:43:28,857 --> 00:43:29,858
<i>No, Lamar, listen to me. Listen.</i>

549
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,943
Talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone
inside the temple again.

550
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:35,864
Then ask Jad for any off-hour eye-dents
into the analytical room.

551
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,408
Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?

552
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:41,203
<i>Security lockdown enabled.
Revised destination, office.</i>

553
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,370
Lamar, they found me.

554
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:51,880
Is there any way to override
the lockdown?

555
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,840
- <i>No. No. No.</i>
- No?

556
00:43:53,924 --> 00:43:57,385
<i>I'll meet you anywhere you say.
You can come to my house, John.</i>

557
00:43:57,469 --> 00:44:00,472
You know I can't. They'll get me there.
I'm not gonna get haloed.

558
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,765
You can't run, John.

559
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,518
Everybody runs.

560
00:44:50,981 --> 00:44:52,858
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, hey.

561
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,000
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

562
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,630
Don't worry, sir.
I'll bring him in, unharmed.

563
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:17,549
Actually, Gordon,
you're not gonna do that.

564
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,718
- I'm taking control of the team.
- What?

565
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:23,138
Witwer, Fletcher is second
in command. It's his show to run.

566
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:26,725
If you want, you can observe. Do it.
Find him.

567
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:28,101
Yes, sir.

568
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:33,899
He came to see you the other day,
right before he was tagged.

569
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:36,610
- What did you talk about?
- The Mets.

570
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:39,070
John doesn't think they have
a deep enough pitching roster this year,

571
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:41,656
- and I'm inclined to agree.
- Why are you protecting him?

572
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,742
You knew he was doping,
yet you did nothing about it.

573
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:47,746
- The man lost a child, for Christ's sake.
- Six years ago.

574
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:50,248
- What did you two talk about?
- None of your damn business.

575
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:52,584
It's all my damn business now, Lamar.

576
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,128
Investigation of a supervising officer
for a capital crime

577
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,463
falls under federal jurisdiction,

578
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:59,633
so as to rule out
any possibility of conspiracy.

579
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:02,093
- He's my suspect.
- He's my subordinate.

580
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,637
Shall we call the Attorney General?

581
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,931
I'm sure he'd be happy
to clarify the issue for you.

582
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:08,516
I don't want John Anderton hurt.

583
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,730
I'm gonna enjoy working here.

584
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:19,277
<i>A road diverges in the desert.</i>

585
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:20,987
<i>Lexus.</i>

586
00:46:21,071 --> 00:46:24,824
<i>The road you're on, John Anderton,
is the one less traveled.</i>

587
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:33,416
<i>-Good evening, John Anderton.
- John Anderton.</i>

588
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:37,128
<i>John Anderton!</i>

589
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:39,965
<i>You could use a Guinness
right about now.</i>

590
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:43,176
<i>Stressed out, John Anderton?</i>

591
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:49,140
<i>Get away, John Anderton.
Forget your troubles.</i>

592
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,035
He's been eye-dented on the Metro.

593
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,788
The train makes two stops,
at 20th and 33rd.

594
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,331
Send units to each location.

595
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:15,375
- They'll never make 20th.
- Have faith.

596
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:57,959
Fire them up!

597
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,069
- Hey, Fletch.
- Hey, John.

598
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:26,613
- That was a rough landing.
- Yeah.

599
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:28,865
- You have to work on that.
- It's that old, shit knee of mine.

600
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,825
- Yeah.
- Don't do it.

601
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,369
Hey, don't do this.

602
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:36,831
John? Don't run.

603
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,001
You don't have to chase me.

604
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,128
You don't have to run.

605
00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:45,799
- Everybody runs, Fletch.
- You know we'll catch you.

606
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,968
Everybody runs.

607
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:54,641
- It doesn't have to be like this, John.
- Everybody runs.

608
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:57,602
Get your sick-sticks ready.

609
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,438
Everybody runs, Fletch.

610
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:03,858
Slow down, Chief. Just take it easy.

611
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:09,405
No sudden moves, Chief.

612
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:13,034
John, it's okay.

613
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:15,036
- Fletch...
- Easy does it, Chief.

614
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:46,901
- Got a grip? Got a grip?
- Yeah.

615
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:15,096
Chief! Chief, no! Chief!

616
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,099
Anderton!

617
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:51,090
Go away! Get out of my kitchen!

618
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:55,094
Get that thing out of my house!
Get out of my house! Get out!

619
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,391
Anderton, stop!

620
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:03,228
Pull him off me, Fletcher.
Get him off me.

621
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:07,357
Do something! Try to get them out
of here! What's the matter with you?

622
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:15,448
- John! Stop!
- Get out of my house now!

623
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:38,471
By mandate of the
District of Columbia Precrime Division,

624
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,431
I'm placing you under arrest...

625
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:41,641
Go to sleep.

626
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:04,289
Just stay with me.

627
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,144
Dr. Hineman?

628
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:40,064
You're trespassing. I don't have visitors.

629
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,823
I'm afraid that would be
from the Doll's Eye, the vine.

630
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,701
The baneberry that scratched you
during your illegal climb over my wall.

631
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:54,996
It's not a true Doll's Eye, of course.
It's a little hybrid of my own design.

632
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,748
It's quite something. Once the poison
gets into your bloodstream,

633
00:56:57,832 --> 00:56:59,500
you will start to see
what I can only describe

634
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:03,629
as the most extraordinary display
of blue objects.

635
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:08,217
This just isn't your week, is it,

636
00:57:09,677 --> 00:57:11,178
Chief Anderton?

637
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:15,308
I'm not a killer.

638
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:22,607
You better drink this.

639
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:27,028
Soon you won't be able to swallow,
and then you'll be totally buggered.

640
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:29,947
All of it.

641
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:33,034
Okay, now take a minute
to right yourself.

642
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:38,539
Just what is it you think
I can do for you?

643
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:45,421
You can tell me
how someone can fake a prevision.

644
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,715
How would I know that?

645
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:50,217
Because you invented Precrime.

646
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:54,096
What's so funny?

647
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:57,892
If the unintended consequences
of a series of genetic mistakes

648
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:00,728
and science gone haywire
can be called invention,

649
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,813
yes, then I invented Precrime.

650
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:04,899
- You don't seem all that proud.
- I'm not.

651
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,735
I was trying to heal them,
not turn them into something else.

652
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:08,819
Heal who?

653
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:11,280
The innocents we now use
to stop the guilty.

654
00:58:11,364 --> 00:58:14,367
You're talking about the Precogs.

655
00:58:15,076 --> 00:58:17,286
You think the three in the tank
come out of a test tube?

656
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,997
They are merely the ones who survived.

657
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:22,500
I was doing genetic research
at the Woodhaven Clinic,

658
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:23,959
treating children of drug addicts.

659
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:27,338
This was 10 years ago,
when neuroin first hit the streets.

660
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:30,966
It was an impure form of the drug,
not the engineered cocktail

661
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:34,428
that became so popular
among the more educated.

662
00:58:35,388 --> 00:58:38,265
All of these kids were born
with severe brain damage.

663
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:41,018
Most died before the age of 12.

664
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:44,105
Those few, those precious few
who survived, they had a gift.

665
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:47,692
I call it a gift. For them,
it was more like a cosmic joke.

666
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:50,444
They would wake up in the night,
curled up in the corner of their rooms,

667
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:52,363
screaming, clawing at the wallpaper.

668
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:56,867
Because when these little children,
you see, closed their eyes at night,

669
00:58:56,951 --> 00:59:01,747
they dreamt only of murder,
over and over, one after the other.

670
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:05,084
And it didn't take long for us to
realize that the real nightmare

671
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:08,295
was that these so-called dreams
were about to come true.

672
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:10,965
These murders
were actually happening.

673
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:17,096
You say some of the children died.

674
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:20,433
So many of them,
despite what we did for them.

675
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:24,895
Or maybe because of what we did
to them. But it doesn't matter.

676
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:27,523
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?

677
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,402
I'm not going to commit murder.

678
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,696
I've never met the man
I'm supposed to kill.

679
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,698
And yet a chain of events has started,

680
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,242
a chain that will lead you inexorably
to his murder.

681
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,410
Not if I stay away from him.

682
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,911
How can you avoid a man
you've never met?

683
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:42,079
So you won't help me?

684
00:59:42,163 --> 00:59:47,001
I can't help you. Nobody can.
The Precogs are never wrong.

685
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:51,464
But occasionally,

686
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,175
they do disagree.

687
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,052
What?

688
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:02,099
Most of the time, all three Precognitives
will see an event in the same way,

689
01:00:02,183 --> 01:00:06,145
but once in a while, one of them will
see things differently than the other two.

690
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:09,690
Jesus Christ.
Why didn't I know about this?

691
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,612
Because these minority reports
are destroyed the instant they occur.

692
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:15,946
Why?

693
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:18,199
Obviously, for Precrime to function,

694
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,785
there can't be
any suggestion of fallibility.

695
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:24,246
After all, who wants a justice system
that instills doubt?

696
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:27,208
It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.

697
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:31,462
Are you saying
I've haloed innocent people?

698
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:35,341
I'm saying that every so often
those accused of a Precrime

699
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:38,344
might, just might,
have an alternate future.

700
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:42,890
Does Burgess know about this?
About this minority report?

701
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:46,268
I used to joke with Lamar that we were
the mother and father of Precrime.

702
01:00:46,352 --> 01:00:49,063
Well, in my experience,
parents very often see their children

703
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:51,023
as they want them to be, not as they are.

704
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,608
Answer my question.

705
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:56,445
Does Lamar Burgess know
about the minority report?

706
01:00:56,529 --> 01:00:58,614
Yes, of course, he knew.

707
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,658
But at the time, he felt, we both felt,

708
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:03,953
that their existence
was an insignificant variable.

709
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:05,788
Insignificant to you, maybe,

710
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:10,000
but what about those people
that I put away with alternate futures?

711
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:12,461
My God, if the country knew
there was a chance...

712
01:01:12,545 --> 01:01:14,547
The system would collapse.

713
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:18,884
- I believe in that system.
- Do you really?

714
01:01:18,968 --> 01:01:20,094
You want to bring it down.

715
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:24,181
You will bring it down,
if you manage to kill your victim.

716
01:01:24,265 --> 01:01:27,518
Why, that will be
the most spectacular public display

717
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,895
of how Precrime didn't work.

718
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:33,148
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- Hold that thought.

719
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:34,525
Why should I trust you?

720
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,360
You shouldn't.
You shouldn't trust anyone.

721
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,572
Certainly not the Attorney General,
who just wants it all for himself.

722
01:01:39,655 --> 01:01:42,700
And not the young federal agent
who wants your job.

723
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,619
Not even the old man who just wants
to hang on to what he created.

724
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:49,748
Don't trust anyone.
Just find the minority report.

725
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,628
You said
the minority report's destroyed.

726
01:01:54,712 --> 01:01:58,173
The record is destroyed.
The original report still exists.

727
01:01:58,257 --> 01:02:01,051
I designed the system
so that whenever a report occurred,

728
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:04,013
it would be stored in a safe place,
but not declared.

729
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:06,056
What safe place is that?

730
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:09,226
The safest place there is.

731
01:02:09,852 --> 01:02:12,021
Where is it?

732
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,235
Inside the Precog who predicted it.

733
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:27,328
All you have to do
is download it, darling.

734
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,290
That's all, huh?

735
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,755
Just walk right into Precrime,
get in the temple,

736
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:42,426
somehow tap into these Precogs,
and then download this minority report.

737
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,220
- If you have one.
- And then walk out.

738
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:50,142
Actually, I think you'll have to run out,
but, yes, that is what you have to do.

739
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,186
You're insane.

740
01:02:53,354 --> 01:02:55,022
Or you think I am.

741
01:02:55,814 --> 01:03:01,028
I'll get eye-scanned a dozen times
before I get within 10 miles of Precrime!

742
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:06,075
Sometimes, in order to see the light,
you have to risk the dark.

743
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:09,453
As a policeman...
Excuse me, as a former policeman,

744
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:12,039
I'm sure that you know
all sorts of people

745
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,708
who can help you out in this regard.

746
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,677
It's funny
how all living organisms are alike.

747
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,764
When the chips are down,
when the pressure is on,

748
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:33,268
every creature on the face of the Earth
is interested in one thing

749
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:35,062
and one thing only.

750
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:38,232
Its own survival.

751
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:42,528
Find the minority report.

752
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:50,494
How do I even know which one has it?

753
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:53,455
It's always in the more gifted
of the three.

754
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,209
Which one is that?

755
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:01,755
The female.

756
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:06,719
All right, here's where we're at.

757
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:08,887
Three men in a room.
The victim is here.

758
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:13,809
John is here. And this unidentified male,
out the window.

759
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,936
Now, the adjacent building
suggests public housing,

760
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,813
but I can't make out the location,
which means...

761
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,314
There's thousands of units like this one.

762
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:20,691
Yeah, they're everywhere.

763
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:23,152
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow
for another 22 hours.

764
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:24,403
Excuse me,
this is Chief Anderton's space.

765
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,529
Casey, he's okay.

766
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,114
- You can't sit in his space.
- He's not here anymore.

767
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,532
- He'll be back.
- I doubt that.

768
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:29,783
- What happened to you?
- It's okay.

769
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:31,952
In the meantime, I'm betting
he's somewhere in the sprawl.

770
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:34,079
Anderton's smart enough to
go where electronic billboards

771
01:04:34,163 --> 01:04:35,831
and other media can't ID him
to pick his pockets.

772
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:38,417
There's fewer consumers there, which
means fewer scanners to target him.

773
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,046
- Why won't he just run?
- Because he thinks he's innocent.

774
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:46,133
We concentrate on the sprawl.

775
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:49,386
Do flyovers in shifts
with two spyder teams on the ground.

776
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:53,766
Thermal scan the entire area,
read anything with eyes and a heartbeat.

777
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:10,824
Where is she?

778
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,395
This damn cold!

779
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:43,482
Don't worry.

780
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:46,485
You see, I could cut open your chest
and sew a dead cat in there,

781
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:47,694
you would never get an infection.

782
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:51,490
Not with the spectrum of antibios
I'll be shooting into you.

783
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,033
That's comforting.

784
01:05:53,117 --> 01:05:56,620
You do understand
I can't just give you new irises.

785
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,122
Please don't touch.

786
01:05:58,205 --> 01:06:01,792
Because the scanners will read
the new scar tissue, alarms will go off,

787
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,670
and large men with guns will appear.

788
01:06:07,506 --> 01:06:10,676
What was that? What was that?

789
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:13,971
It's anesthesia.
It's all gonna be downhill from...

790
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:15,806
You always sneak up
on your patients like that?

791
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:19,393
You wouldn't break the hand
of a violinist before the concert.

792
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:20,894
Please, relax.

793
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:30,612
All I'm trying to tell you is that
I'll have to remove your eyes completely.

794
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:32,739
I know.

795
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:35,325
And I'll have to replace them
with new ones.

796
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:37,494
I know that,
but I wanna keep the old ones.

797
01:06:37,578 --> 01:06:38,662
Why?

798
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:41,874
Because my mother gave them to me.

799
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:44,084
What's it to you? They're no good
in the secondary market anyway.

800
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:46,587
Whatever you say. It's your money.

801
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:57,973
Let me introduce my gorgeous assistant,
Miss Van Eyck.

802
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:23,957
- This is not a lot of money.
- It's all that I could safely move.

803
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,468
What did you give me?

804
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:38,847
Smile medicine. Tell you what,
since you and I go way back,

805
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:43,143
why don't I just give you my
"old pal" discount? What do you say?

806
01:07:43,227 --> 01:07:45,437
You don't remember me, do you?

807
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,106
- We know each other?
- Yes, we do.

808
01:07:49,608 --> 01:07:51,568
From where? D.C.?

809
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:53,779
- Baltimore. East side.
- Baltimore?

810
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:56,365
- Yeah.
- How do we go way back?

811
01:07:56,448 --> 01:08:00,535
Solomon P. Eddie, M.D.
I was a plastic surgeon.

812
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:05,123
You remember? I specialized
in burn victims, mostly women.

813
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:09,086
- I put you away.
- Yeah. You did.

814
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:13,340
You made those tapes.

815
01:08:13,966 --> 01:08:16,510
They were performance pieces.

816
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:21,682
- You set your patients on fire.
- I put them out!

817
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:26,853
Some not as quickly as others,
but let's change the subject, shall we?

818
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:34,528
The future is so much more interesting
than the past, don't you think?

819
01:08:37,698 --> 01:08:41,034
Miss van Eyck,
I'm afraid she's already smitten.

820
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:46,123
She only has eyes for you.

821
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:51,461
I know what you're thinking, John.
How can I do what I do now?

822
01:08:51,545 --> 01:08:56,300
Well, let's say that I did spend
an awful lot of time in the prison library.

823
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:57,467
Now that was a great way

824
01:08:57,551 --> 01:09:01,972
to avoid some of the more unpleasant
aspects of prison life.

825
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:05,100
Confinement was a real education,
a real

826
01:09:07,436 --> 01:09:08,812
eye-opener.

827
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:18,196
I mean, for true enlightenment,
there's nothing quite like, well, let's say,

828
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:21,575
taking a shower
while this large felon with an attitude

829
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,327
you can't even knock down
with a hammer

830
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:26,204
whispers in your ear,
"Oh, Nancy. Oh, Nancy."

831
01:09:26,288 --> 01:09:27,664
Now, that was a lot of fun.

832
01:09:27,748 --> 01:09:29,916
Thank you so very much, John,
for putting me there.

833
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,044
Thank you so very much
for giving me the opportunity

834
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:34,171
to get to know myself so much better.

835
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:36,423
And now, to return the favor.

836
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:50,604
- This your work?
- Yes.

837
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,565
I like it.

838
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,026
Thanks.
You take anything in your coffee?

839
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,695
- Cream and sugar.
- I don't have any cream. Sorry.

840
01:09:58,779 --> 01:10:00,739
Just sugar, then.
You and John ever come here?

841
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:04,201
- We used to, every summer.
- He's not here now, is he?

842
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:07,954
I had to ask.

843
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:12,501
You know,
I don't have any sugar, either.

844
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:13,752
Thank you.

845
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:17,214
- He hasn't tried to contact you?
- No.

846
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:19,883
You ever heard him
mention the name Leo Crow?

847
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,886
No, but then
I don't talk to John that much anymore.

848
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,013
So you haven't seen his apartment?

849
01:10:25,097 --> 01:10:27,849
- That was our apartment.
- Have you been there recently?

850
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:31,103
It's full of these.
How long has he been doping?

851
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:36,441
- Since right after we lost our son.
- You mean after he lost your son.

852
01:10:37,776 --> 01:10:39,611
It was nobody's fault.

853
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:45,492
But John was with him
at the public pool.

854
01:10:46,118 --> 01:10:48,745
You said in your divorce papers
that John tried to kill himself.

855
01:10:48,829 --> 01:10:50,080
It wasn't a suicide attempt.

856
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:52,249
- I regret ever saying that.
- Then what was it?

857
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:55,585
The FBI found something that
belonged to my son, a sandal.

858
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:58,588
Anyway, John was upset. He...

859
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:00,590
He took out his gun and sat down
and watched his home movies.

860
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:02,968
- He shot...
- This is all in your statement, Lara.

861
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:05,554
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling.
So what?

862
01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:08,849
You lose your son,
let's see how well you handle it.

863
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,560
Lamar Burgess thinks you left John

864
01:11:11,643 --> 01:11:14,187
because he lost himself
in Precrime instead of you.

865
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:20,110
I left him because every time
I looked at him, I saw my son.

866
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:24,865
Every time I got close to him,
I smelled my little boy.

867
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:27,909
That's why I left him.

868
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,329
And now you can leave.

869
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:36,334
Don't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.

870
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:46,011
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

871
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:51,016
In the fridge there's milk,
and Greta made you a sandwich.

872
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:53,477
Make sure you drink a lot of water.

873
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:56,605
How do I find the bathroom?

874
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:59,399
The bathroom?
Now that's your right hand.

875
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:04,821
The kitchen is your left.

876
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:10,243
Don't scratch. Never scratch!

877
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:13,997
Seeing as we're being old pals and all,
I'm going to give you a bonus.

878
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,790
It might come in handy.

879
01:12:15,874 --> 01:12:17,876
This is a temporary paralytic enzyme.

880
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:20,295
You're gonna shoot this baby up there,
right under your chin.

881
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:21,338
What is this?

882
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:23,715
It's gonna turn your pretty face
into mush.

883
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:26,468
People won't even recognize you, okay?

884
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:28,094
In 30 minutes, it'll tighten up again,

885
01:12:28,178 --> 01:12:31,056
but it's gonna hurt like
nothing you've ever felt before.

886
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:36,269
Gonna put this in your goodie bag,
together with your leftovers.

887
01:12:38,897 --> 01:12:42,025
I'm setting up a timer.
When it rings tomorrow,

888
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,569
you can take off the bandages
and get the hell out of here,

889
01:12:44,653 --> 01:12:48,657
- but not before then, or you'll...
- Go blind, I know.

890
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,408
Don't scratch.

891
01:12:51,743 --> 01:12:55,914
A little something
from a mutual friend of ours.

892
01:13:33,118 --> 01:13:35,787
<i>Don't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.</i>

893
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:41,293
<i>If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?</i>

894
01:14:02,147 --> 01:14:05,442
25.16 seconds. That's a new record.

895
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:06,943
Is that a world record?

896
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:10,614
Is it a world record? It's a personal best.

897
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:12,574
Okay, now I want to time you.

898
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:13,700
You wanna time me?
You gotta be kidding.

899
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:17,078
'Cause there's no possible way
I can beat 25.16 seconds.

900
01:14:17,162 --> 01:14:19,998
How long can a whale
hold its breath underwater?

901
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:22,417
A whale can hold its breath for
about 20 minutes.

902
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,170
- So we gotta beat the whale.
- Okay.

903
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:29,382
We gotta beat the whale.

904
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:33,136
Here you go.
Now, that's gonna be 20 minutes.

905
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:35,055
You sure you don't want to go
for an ice cream or something?

906
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:36,473
- No.
- Because you know,

907
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:38,850
- you know I'm going to beat that whale.
- Yeah.

908
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:40,644
- Okay, give me the count.
- Ready?

909
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:43,355
- Give me the count.
- Three, two, one, go.

910
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:02,707
Sean?

911
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:06,628
Sean?

912
01:15:09,756 --> 01:15:11,049
Sean!

913
01:15:15,387 --> 01:15:16,429
Sean?

914
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:19,140
Have you seen...

915
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,394
Sean! I'm looking for my son.

916
01:15:22,477 --> 01:15:25,230
Have you seen a boy
in a red bathing suit?

917
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:27,023
Sean!

918
01:15:28,942 --> 01:15:30,819
He's wearing a red bathing suit.

919
01:15:31,403 --> 01:15:32,570
Sean!

920
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,492
Sean!

921
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:41,413
Sean...

922
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,346
Jad, we are now in position
and ready to begin thermal scan

923
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:23,640
on all residences on North Powell.

924
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:27,268
I'm thinking you must really like me,
don't you, Fletcher?

925
01:17:27,352 --> 01:17:30,230
That's why you asked to partner with me
on this little sortie, isn't it?

926
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:31,856
I think you're swell company, Knott.

927
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,984
It's not that you don't trust me
to be alone with the Chief, is it?

928
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:37,403
That you think I might futz with him
if I had the chance?

929
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:40,114
No, I just want to watch him use your
body to sandblast another building.

930
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:42,826
That's all, Jeff. Evanna, go.

931
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:46,955
I show 27 warm bodies.

932
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:49,541
Roger that. Confirm 27 warm bodies.

933
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:51,835
What do you think? Four spyders?
One per floor?

934
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:54,254
Let's do eight. I gotta eat.

935
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:13,189
<i>Residents of 931 Powell,
residents of 931 Powell.</i>

936
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:15,859
<i>This is Officer Fletcher
of D.C. Precrime.</i>

937
01:18:15,942 --> 01:18:18,862
<i>Under authority P.C. Section 6409,</i>

938
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:21,364
<i>we are deploying spyders
into your complex.</i>

939
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:24,617
- Go, go, go, baby.
- Mom, I'm scared.

940
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:27,370
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy.

941
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,706
Come on, it's gonna scan you.
Keep your eyes open. Just stay still.

942
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:32,375
Stay still, baby. Open your eyes.
It's okay.

943
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,836
- I don't like it.
- Stay still, stay still.

944
01:18:57,108 --> 01:19:00,445
Come on! You can't just come
barging in here like that! Come on!

945
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:02,780
You have stepped out on me
for the last time.

946
01:19:02,864 --> 01:19:04,908
I told you where I was!
Now get off my back!

947
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:08,661
You're a no good liar!
I know you was with that ho last night.

948
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,668
- Leave me alone!
- Get out of here!

949
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,038
We lost one.

950
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:38,084
Roger that. Maybe it was a cat jumping
through a window or something.

951
01:20:38,668 --> 01:20:41,170
- That's an awful big cat.
- Fletcher.

952
01:20:42,714 --> 01:20:44,465
I'll go check it out.

953
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:24,630
They're crying their eyes out.

954
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:26,758
You terrified them.
They're absolutely terrified right now!

955
01:21:26,841 --> 01:21:29,177
You don't want your kids to know terror,
keep them away from me.

956
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:46,444
Wait a minute. The big cat's back.

957
01:21:46,778 --> 01:21:49,072
What do you guys think,
a drunk, maybe can't wake up?

958
01:21:49,155 --> 01:21:51,324
Yeah, some guy
who doesn't want to get read.

959
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:54,243
Folks, please be quiet.
Close your doors. Go back inside.

960
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,423
Be quiet and close the door!

961
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:16,766
We got an ID. It's not him.

962
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:19,936
Standing down.

963
01:22:20,186 --> 01:22:21,229
Let's eat.

964
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:23,356
<i>Anderton, wait!</i>

965
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:37,203
Fletcher, take a look.

966
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:42,291
There's four people in this room,
not three.

967
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:46,462
Four? There's Anderton, there's Crow
and there's the man with sunglasses.

968
01:22:46,546 --> 01:22:49,382
Here's the man with sunglasses
outside the window.

969
01:22:52,385 --> 01:22:56,180
There's also someone here,
in the mirror.

970
01:22:56,264 --> 01:22:58,891
Yeah. Definitely female.

971
01:23:00,059 --> 01:23:04,397
The Precrime Program began
in the year 2046 with a federal grant.

972
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,691
And now, nine years later,

973
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:09,819
the District of Columbia is
the safest city in America.

974
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:12,488
Why? Because Precrime works.

975
01:23:12,572 --> 01:23:16,075
Precrime has eliminated the need
for conventional detectives,

976
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,827
so most of what happens now

977
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,872
is the verification and the protection
of the future victim.

978
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:22,331
Can we see the Precogs?

979
01:23:22,415 --> 01:23:25,168
Well, the Precogs have
such a powerful gift

980
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:27,003
that they have to be kept
in peaceful seclusion

981
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:29,422
so as not to be distracted
from the outside world.

982
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:33,926
But this display is to give you some idea
of what their daily life is like.

983
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:38,806
The Precogs get over
eight million pieces of mail every year,

984
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:40,808
more mail than Santa Claus gets.

985
01:23:40,892 --> 01:23:44,353
Each Precog has their own bedroom,
television and weight room.

986
01:23:44,437 --> 01:23:46,898
It really is wonderful to be a Precog.

987
01:24:12,215 --> 01:24:14,133
My mom's new boyfriend
came over again last night.

988
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:17,220
He's just not a very intelligent person.

989
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:19,055
My mom wouldn't let me go upstairs
and eat in my room.

990
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:20,723
She made me sit down there
the entire time,

991
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:23,476
having to listen to him
go on and on and on.

992
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:35,071
Shit! Shit, shit, shit.

993
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:54,674
<i>Eye-dent, John Anderton.
Approved for entry.</i>

994
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:58,344
I want to get a new dog.

995
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,596
Which I told her I should be able to do

996
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,223
because I'm so good
at taking care of you guys.

997
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:06,060
But she thinks that I'll be irresponsible,
which is ridiculous.

998
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:14,527
No, no, no, no! You can't be in here!
No, no! What are you doing here?

999
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:19,156
No, no, no, no!

1000
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,951
Easy there, old-timer. Who cleared you?
You are not supposed to be in here.

1001
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,287
- Listen, Wally.
- Do I know you? Who are you?

1002
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:28,249
I like you, Wally. So, I don't want to have
to kick you or hit you with anything hard,

1003
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:30,501
but only if you promise to help me.

1004
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:33,713
Hi, John.

1005
01:25:42,388 --> 01:25:44,682
Who does that look like to you?

1006
01:25:46,267 --> 01:25:47,768
I don't know.

1007
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:53,816
It's Agatha.

1008
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:56,068
He's coming here to get her.

1009
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:01,866
- Are these all of her previsions?
- I'm rewinding her right now.

1010
01:26:04,577 --> 01:26:06,829
I don't need to see all these.
Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.

1011
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:08,497
I'm looking.
They're not coming out in any order.

1012
01:26:08,581 --> 01:26:10,416
I'm just getting them as she's giving.

1013
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,088
Can you see?

1014
01:26:29,894 --> 01:26:32,355
- He's inside.
- He's got some kind of mask on.

1015
01:26:32,438 --> 01:26:33,981
He sealed the door from the inside.

1016
01:26:34,065 --> 01:26:36,192
Shit! Nobody fires a weapon
inside the temple.

1017
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:38,944
Use only bindfoam or your sick-sticks.
Is there another way out of there?

1018
01:26:39,028 --> 01:26:41,155
We've got all the doors covered.
There's no way he's getting out.

1019
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:44,033
John, move away from the tank!

1020
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,619
Move away from the tank, John!

1021
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,255
No, no, no, no, no. No!

1022
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:02,468
No! No, no, no, no, no!

1023
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:06,305
- What does he want with the Precog?
- What do you think?

1024
01:27:06,389 --> 01:27:09,767
So he can kill whoever he wants to
without anyone knowing about it!

1025
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,477
But there's still the other two.

1026
01:27:11,936 --> 01:27:15,064
Wally! Wally!
The other two can still function, right?

1027
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:17,066
You don't understand.
They're a hive mind.

1028
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:20,611
It takes all three
for their predictive abilities to work.

1029
01:27:23,781 --> 01:27:25,282
Are you telling me
they can't see murders anymore?

1030
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:28,452
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males,
but Agatha, she's the key.

1031
01:27:28,536 --> 01:27:31,580
She's the one they listen to,
the one with the most talent.

1032
01:27:31,664 --> 01:27:33,499
She takes care of the other two.

1033
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:35,793
Jesus. Agatha.

1034
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:37,211
Please, bring her back.

1035
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:39,839
Find out where that pipe leads.
I want every team underground, now!

1036
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:41,048
It doesn't matter, he wins.

1037
01:27:41,132 --> 01:27:43,259
No, no. I'll send my men to EVAC.
We'll stop him in the reservoir.

1038
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:45,761
Gordon, she's in the room with him
when he kills Crow.

1039
01:27:45,845 --> 01:27:48,097
She's already a part of his future.

1040
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:50,307
Jad, put everything you've got
into finding that room,

1041
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:51,600
and we stop a murder.

1042
01:27:51,684 --> 01:27:56,814
- How much time have we got, Gordon?
- We've got 51 minutes, 30 seconds.

1043
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:01,110
You cold?

1044
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:04,989
Can you understand me? Are you cold?

1045
01:28:05,072 --> 01:28:07,450
The shivers, it's the drugs we gave you.

1046
01:28:07,533 --> 01:28:09,118
It should wear off soon.

1047
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:13,038
I'm sorry. I need your help.
You contain information.

1048
01:28:13,122 --> 01:28:15,207
I need to know how to get at it.

1049
01:28:16,584 --> 01:28:19,628
Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?
Can you tell me if...

1050
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,630
- Is it now?
- What?

1051
01:28:21,714 --> 01:28:23,090
Is it now?

1052
01:28:25,176 --> 01:28:28,179
Yes, this is all happening right now.

1053
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,682
We've gotta take you
some place in public,

1054
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:34,477
which means I've gotta get you
something else to wear.

1055
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,813
I'm tired. I'm tired of the future.

1056
01:28:44,904 --> 01:28:47,823
<i>Hello, Mr. Yakamoto.
Welcome back to the Gap!</i>

1057
01:28:47,907 --> 01:28:50,367
<i>How'd those assorted tank tops
work out for you?</i>

1058
01:28:51,744 --> 01:28:53,746
Mr. Yakamoto?

1059
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,002
<i>Hey, Miss Belford, did you come back</i>

1060
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:02,755
<i>for another pair of
those Shimmy Lace Ups?</i>

1061
01:29:17,728 --> 01:29:19,855
If he's ransoming her,
where's the damn note?

1062
01:29:19,939 --> 01:29:21,941
It has nothing to do with ransom.

1063
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:25,194
It has to do with the information
that's inside of Agatha.

1064
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:28,739
He's trying to prove his innocence.

1065
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,283
But he can't download her
without a lot of technical support.

1066
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:34,078
Well, your average consumer
can't buy any of this stuff

1067
01:29:34,161 --> 01:29:36,205
because it's been assembled
and scrounged

1068
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:38,415
from spare parts made to order.

1069
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:43,629
Assuming Anderton ordered this,
who put it together?

1070
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:55,849
Who's Rufus T. Riley?

1071
01:29:58,561 --> 01:30:00,062
What's your pleasure?
We got it all here.

1072
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:01,438
We got sports fantasies.

1073
01:30:01,522 --> 01:30:04,024
We got what I like to call
"Look, Ma, I can fly" fantasies,

1074
01:30:04,108 --> 01:30:06,068
which encompasses
everything from bungee jumping

1075
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,362
to soaring like an eagle
over the Grand Canyon.

1076
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:10,573
We got guys coming in
wanting to experience sex as a woman.

1077
01:30:10,656 --> 01:30:12,741
We got women coming, wanna get laid
by their favorite soap star.

1078
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:16,954
Or just some good, clean fun.

1079
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:20,332
Yeah.

1080
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:23,419
It's a big rush, but you come out
the other side without a heart attack.

1081
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:26,171
I want to kill my boss.

1082
01:30:27,965 --> 01:30:29,174
Okay.

1083
01:30:29,675 --> 01:30:31,427
You got some images I can work with?

1084
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:33,137
Rufus!

1085
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:37,099
Yeah, being concert master for
the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra

1086
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:38,726
is one of our most popular choices.

1087
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:40,769
No, no, no. I want to kill my boss.

1088
01:30:40,853 --> 01:30:42,104
You sick bastard!

1089
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:45,357
You're the kind of person that
makes this a terrible world to live in!

1090
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:47,192
Detective, nice of you
to come down here,

1091
01:30:47,276 --> 01:30:49,445
seeing how every cop in the world
is looking for you right now.

1092
01:30:49,528 --> 01:30:50,696
I need your help.

1093
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,156
Why did you have to come
all the way down here?

1094
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,158
Chief, I make house calls.
You know that.

1095
01:30:54,241 --> 01:30:57,411
- I need your help with her.
- Well, hello there, honey pie.

1096
01:30:57,911 --> 01:30:59,580
I'm impressed, Anderton.
You're on the I am,

1097
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:03,751
and you still have the time and energy
to slice off a little jerky for yourself.

1098
01:31:04,251 --> 01:31:08,756
- She's a Precog.
- Yeah. Okay. She's a Precog.

1099
01:31:11,717 --> 01:31:14,720
You brought a Precog here.

1100
01:31:29,068 --> 01:31:30,736
Jesus Christ.

1101
01:31:31,904 --> 01:31:34,782
- Are you reading my mind right now?
- Get up.

1102
01:31:34,865 --> 01:31:35,949
I'm sorry for whatever I'm going to do,

1103
01:31:36,033 --> 01:31:38,786
and I swear I didn't do
any of that stuff I did.

1104
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:46,377
She's got information inside of her.
I need you to get it out.

1105
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:49,838
No way, man. No.
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1106
01:31:49,922 --> 01:31:53,717
Those thoughts about my cousin Elena,
they were just thoughts.

1107
01:31:53,801 --> 01:31:55,427
You've been busted twice
for felony hacking.

1108
01:31:55,511 --> 01:31:58,347
- So?
- So, I need you to hack into her.

1109
01:32:01,934 --> 01:32:04,812
I tell you what. I do this,

1110
01:32:04,895 --> 01:32:07,314
I get to keep whatever images
I get from her head.

1111
01:32:07,398 --> 01:32:09,108
They don't belong to anybody.

1112
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:10,609
Take her to RadioShack.

1113
01:32:12,778 --> 01:32:14,113
Rufus, you gotta help me.

1114
01:32:20,494 --> 01:32:24,832
Agatha, I need to see. I need to see
what's going to happen to me.

1115
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:27,710
And then we'll go.

1116
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:45,352
- Wow. She works.
- Slow it down.

1117
01:32:46,812 --> 01:32:50,023
How do I slow this down?
I should hit her on the head?

1118
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:59,241
- Are you recording this?
- Shit.

1119
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:01,493
Yeah, recording.

1120
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:30,898
I know this already. Come on, move on.

1121
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:35,611
Goodbye, Crow.

1122
01:33:36,612 --> 01:33:38,113
<i>Goodbye, Crow.</i>

1123
01:33:46,371 --> 01:33:48,707
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1124
01:33:48,791 --> 01:33:50,459
- What happened?
- I...

1125
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:52,961
- Where's the rest of it?
- I guess that's all of it.

1126
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,217
Where's my minority report?

1127
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:02,763
Do I even have one?

1128
01:34:08,018 --> 01:34:10,896
- Do I have one?
- No.

1129
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:14,817
- What?
- No.

1130
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:26,537
What? Agatha, what?

1131
01:34:28,038 --> 01:34:30,582
- Can you see?
- See what?

1132
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:48,225
Anne Lively.

1133
01:34:56,942 --> 01:34:59,278
You want me to see
who killed Anne Lively.

1134
01:35:00,112 --> 01:35:01,196
Are you recording this?

1135
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,574
Yeah, but look,
it's pouring out of her backwards.

1136
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:12,124
I like my life. Everything is good.

1137
01:35:23,594 --> 01:35:25,262
They're inside.

1138
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:27,264
Who?

1139
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:30,225
All your old teammates.

1140
01:35:31,602 --> 01:35:33,145
Get in, left chamber.

1141
01:35:34,021 --> 01:35:35,522
- Hey, close the door!
- Negative!

1142
01:35:36,732 --> 01:35:38,233
- Negative!
- Negative!

1143
01:35:38,317 --> 01:35:39,735
Thank you, I don't deserve that.
I'm gonna cry.

1144
01:35:39,818 --> 01:35:40,944
- You are the man.
- No, you're the man.

1145
01:35:41,028 --> 01:35:42,112
- No, you are the man.
- You are the man.

1146
01:35:49,161 --> 01:35:51,330
Can you see the umbrella?

1147
01:35:51,997 --> 01:35:53,332
Take it!

1148
01:35:53,874 --> 01:35:55,208
Take it!

1149
01:35:59,671 --> 01:36:01,173
A man in a blue suit.

1150
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,675
He drops his briefcase.

1151
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:15,354
You see a woman in a brown dress.
She knows your face.

1152
01:36:16,855 --> 01:36:18,357
Turn in here.

1153
01:36:25,489 --> 01:36:26,740
Let's go.

1154
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:33,455
Wait.

1155
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:36,041
- No, we can't stop here.
- You see the balloon man?

1156
01:36:38,919 --> 01:36:40,253
Wait.

1157
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:44,299
Wait.

1158
01:36:45,759 --> 01:36:47,260
What are we waiting for?

1159
01:36:51,932 --> 01:36:53,767
Wait. Wait.

1160
01:36:54,643 --> 01:36:55,894
Wait.

1161
01:36:56,687 --> 01:36:58,939
- Please, Mommy, can I have one?
- All right.

1162
01:37:02,442 --> 01:37:03,610
Wait.

1163
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:10,075
Thank you.

1164
01:37:10,993 --> 01:37:12,828
- Anybody got an ID? Anybody?
- Negative.

1165
01:37:12,911 --> 01:37:14,162
- Negative.
- Negative.

1166
01:37:14,246 --> 01:37:16,164
All right.
Scott, Ramos, take the east end.

1167
01:37:16,248 --> 01:37:18,333
Everyone else, follow me. Let's go.

1168
01:37:30,554 --> 01:37:32,806
He knows. Don't go home.

1169
01:37:41,648 --> 01:37:42,899
We've got eyes on.

1170
01:37:42,983 --> 01:37:45,736
They're working,
but they're standing on it.

1171
01:37:46,445 --> 01:37:50,407
- Please! Please! Have you got a coin?
- Drop some money.

1172
01:37:53,285 --> 01:37:56,329
Can't you put it in my hand?

1173
01:37:56,413 --> 01:37:59,082
May the Lord bless you.

1174
01:37:59,166 --> 01:38:02,794
May God take care of you.

1175
01:38:22,647 --> 01:38:23,815
Damn!

1176
01:38:52,636 --> 01:38:56,223
That's the guy. The man in the window.

1177
01:39:09,486 --> 01:39:11,696
Hey. Hey.

1178
01:39:12,823 --> 01:39:15,784
- Rooms are $95 a night, plus tax.
- Mind if I look at the registry?

1179
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:17,786
Yeah, I mind.

1180
01:39:18,787 --> 01:39:20,288
How about now?

1181
01:39:20,372 --> 01:39:22,207
Help yourself.

1182
01:39:35,804 --> 01:39:37,639
He's here.

1183
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:39,850
Anderton, leave.

1184
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:50,110
You have a choice. Walk away.
Do it now.

1185
01:39:50,193 --> 01:39:53,405
I can't. I have to know. I have to find out
what happened in my life.

1186
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:55,031
Please.

1187
01:39:55,115 --> 01:39:59,244
Agatha, I'm not gonna kill the man.
I don't even know him.

1188
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:01,580
- What room is Crow in?
- 1006.

1189
01:40:02,539 --> 01:40:05,333
Come on. Come on.

1190
01:41:24,913 --> 01:41:26,665
Wrong room.

1191
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:58,363
Leave. Leave.

1192
01:42:55,378 --> 01:42:56,838
Oh, God.

1193
01:43:01,718 --> 01:43:05,305
This is Sean, my son.

1194
01:43:09,517 --> 01:43:14,481
Every day for the last six years,
I've thought about only two things.

1195
01:43:16,649 --> 01:43:20,528
The first is what my son would
look like if he were alive today,

1196
01:43:22,072 --> 01:43:25,492
if I would recognize him
if I saw him on the street,

1197
01:43:29,329 --> 01:43:32,874
and second is what I would do
to the man who took him.

1198
01:43:37,879 --> 01:43:39,464
You're right.

1199
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:42,842
I'm not being set up.

1200
01:43:45,804 --> 01:43:47,722
You have to take me home.

1201
01:43:48,098 --> 01:43:50,642
No. No.

1202
01:43:53,978 --> 01:43:57,774
You said so yourself.
There is no minority report.

1203
01:43:57,857 --> 01:44:00,568
I don't have an alternate future.

1204
01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:04,364
I am going to kill this man.

1205
01:44:07,325 --> 01:44:11,579
You still have a choice.
The others never saw their future.

1206
01:44:11,663 --> 01:44:13,748
You still have a choice.

1207
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,961
- Leo Crow?
- Who the hell are you?

1208
01:44:23,925 --> 01:44:25,802
Six years ago, Baltimore,
you grabbed up a kid

1209
01:44:25,885 --> 01:44:29,639
at Francis Public Pool in the West End.

1210
01:44:29,722 --> 01:44:31,641
Did I? I don't know.

1211
01:44:31,724 --> 01:44:34,394
I don't remember
anything about that place.

1212
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:42,068
Who am I? Who am I?
Do you know who I am?

1213
01:44:42,152 --> 01:44:45,697
- You're somebody's father.
- His name is Sean!

1214
01:44:47,991 --> 01:44:49,576
Sean!

1215
01:44:49,659 --> 01:44:52,454
I told him I was a policeman.
I told him I needed his help.

1216
01:44:52,537 --> 01:44:55,874
It wasn't so bad. I sang him a song.
I bought him a pretzel.

1217
01:44:55,957 --> 01:44:57,959
I bought him a pretzel.

1218
01:44:58,042 --> 01:45:00,628
He was happy. He was happy.

1219
01:45:00,712 --> 01:45:03,882
Is he alive? He's alive.
Where have you got him?

1220
01:45:03,965 --> 01:45:07,010
Is he all right?
Tell me, you fuck, where is he?

1221
01:45:07,093 --> 01:45:10,513
I put him in a barrel.
I sunk him in the bay.

1222
01:45:11,389 --> 01:45:14,684
He floated back up. I took him out.

1223
01:45:14,767 --> 01:45:17,187
I was gentle. I was gentle.

1224
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:20,565
I was gentle.

1225
01:45:25,653 --> 01:45:29,240
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1226
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:33,328
I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry.

1227
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,458
How could you do that to my...

1228
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:03,733
I'm sorry.

1229
01:46:10,782 --> 01:46:12,617
You can choose.

1230
01:46:16,746 --> 01:46:18,706
You can choose.

1231
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:40,353
You have the right to remain silent.

1232
01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:44,566
Anything you say or do can be
used against you in a court of law.

1233
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:47,860
You have the right to an attorney,

1234
01:46:47,944 --> 01:46:51,948
now and during any further questioning.

1235
01:46:52,699 --> 01:46:55,743
If you can't afford an attorney,

1236
01:46:57,954 --> 01:46:59,956
we will appoint one.

1237
01:47:01,708 --> 01:47:04,127
Do you understand these rights?

1238
01:47:05,503 --> 01:47:07,714
You're not gonna kill me?

1239
01:47:10,675 --> 01:47:14,178
- Do you understand these rights?
- You're not gonna kill me?

1240
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:21,394
If you don't go through with this,
my family gets nothing. Okay?

1241
01:47:21,477 --> 01:47:25,356
You're supposed to kill me.
He said you would.

1242
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:29,819
He? Who's he?

1243
01:47:29,902 --> 01:47:33,156
I don't know. He called me in my cell.

1244
01:47:33,239 --> 01:47:35,325
He told me I'd be released
if I went along,

1245
01:47:35,408 --> 01:47:40,580
- and my family would be taken care of.
- If you did what? If you did what?

1246
01:47:42,248 --> 01:47:45,752
If I acted like I killed your kid. Okay?

1247
01:47:47,503 --> 01:47:49,714
If you killed my kid?

1248
01:47:49,797 --> 01:47:53,551
Look, you don't kill me,
my family gets nothing. Okay?

1249
01:47:54,218 --> 01:47:56,512
What about the pictures?

1250
01:47:57,221 --> 01:48:00,933
They're fake.
He gave them to me. Okay?

1251
01:48:01,559 --> 01:48:04,145
Now, listen to me. You...

1252
01:48:04,228 --> 01:48:07,690
You tell me, who was it that set this up?

1253
01:48:08,566 --> 01:48:10,276
I don't know.

1254
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:13,071
- Come on.
- I'm asking you again.

1255
01:48:13,154 --> 01:48:16,199
- Who was it that put you up to this?
- I didn't see his face.

1256
01:48:16,282 --> 01:48:18,326
I tell you who it was,
and my family gets nothing.

1257
01:48:18,409 --> 01:48:20,453
- Who made you do this?
- Kill me.

1258
01:48:20,536 --> 01:48:21,996
- You can do this. Kill me.
- Tell me.

1259
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:24,082
- Kill me. Kill me.
- Give me the gun.

1260
01:48:24,165 --> 01:48:26,584
Leo, let go of the gun.

1261
01:48:26,668 --> 01:48:29,253
Let go of the gun. It's okay.

1262
01:48:31,214 --> 01:48:34,759
Let go of the gun. That's it.
Let go of the gun.

1263
01:48:36,594 --> 01:48:38,638
You're not gonna kill me.

1264
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:42,100
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait a...

1265
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:48,648
No!

1266
01:48:55,613 --> 01:48:58,074
- Hey, did you see it?
- Stay back!

1267
01:48:58,157 --> 01:49:00,326
What's happening down there?

1268
01:49:01,494 --> 01:49:03,037
Murder!

1269
01:49:03,121 --> 01:49:04,872
Murder!

1270
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:08,668
It doesn't make sense.

1271
01:49:08,751 --> 01:49:10,920
If you were a child killer,
you took these pictures,

1272
01:49:11,003 --> 01:49:12,880
would you leave them on the bed
for anyone to find?

1273
01:49:12,964 --> 01:49:15,216
They may have been put away.
Anderton might have found them.

1274
01:49:15,299 --> 01:49:18,052
- What kind of cop were you before this?
- Treasury agent. Eight years.

1275
01:49:18,136 --> 01:49:19,512
This would be
your first actual murder scene?

1276
01:49:19,595 --> 01:49:20,555
Yeah.

1277
01:49:20,638 --> 01:49:22,223
I worked homicide before I went federal.

1278
01:49:22,306 --> 01:49:24,767
This is what we call an orgy of evidence.

1279
01:49:24,851 --> 01:49:27,145
Know how many orgies I had
as a homicide cop, Gordon?

1280
01:49:27,228 --> 01:49:29,856
- How many?
- None.

1281
01:49:35,528 --> 01:49:37,488
This was all arranged.

1282
01:49:37,822 --> 01:49:42,577
<i>Today we saw the first murder in the
six years of the Precrime experiment.</i>

1283
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:45,496
<i>Sadly enough, this failure was human.</i>

1284
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:49,083
<i>The protection team simply didn't
get there in time to stop the murder.</i>

1285
01:49:49,167 --> 01:49:54,297
<i>But the murder itself happened exactly
as the Precogs predicted it would.</i>

1286
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:58,134
<i>I think that today's event put
a human face on the Precrime system.</i>

1287
01:49:58,217 --> 01:50:02,263
Danny Witwer's on the phone.
He says it's important.

1288
01:50:05,057 --> 01:50:06,726
Lamar?

1289
01:50:14,108 --> 01:50:15,109
- What?
- <i>Lamar, there's something</i>

1290
01:50:15,193 --> 01:50:17,445
<i>terribly wrong.
We're chasing the wrong man.</i>

1291
01:50:17,528 --> 01:50:20,239
- What?
- <i>I don't wanna say over the phone.</i>

1292
01:50:20,323 --> 01:50:22,074
<i>Meet me at Anderton's.</i>

1293
01:50:22,366 --> 01:50:25,536
We recovered that
from Leo Crow's hotel room.

1294
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:34,879
I remember when I gave this to him,
back in Baltimore.

1295
01:50:35,963 --> 01:50:37,548
Please, sir.

1296
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:42,428
Tell me what you have.

1297
01:50:47,058 --> 01:50:50,102
This is the murder of a woman
named Anne Lively.

1298
01:50:51,938 --> 01:50:55,983
Yeah, John told me about this.
You got this from Containment?

1299
01:50:56,067 --> 01:50:58,986
Yes. This is from the twins,
Arthur and Dashiell.

1300
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:01,072
Agatha's stream was missing.

1301
01:51:03,115 --> 01:51:05,451
Now this one is from the cyber parlor.

1302
01:51:05,535 --> 01:51:10,081
Anderton downloaded this directly from
Agatha, and Rufus Riley recorded it.

1303
01:51:13,251 --> 01:51:16,838
- It's the same prevision.
- Not quite.

1304
01:51:19,090 --> 01:51:23,094
Look at the surface wind
across the water. Watch the ripples.

1305
01:51:23,845 --> 01:51:26,430
Moving away from shore.

1306
01:51:27,974 --> 01:51:29,308
Now the second image.

1307
01:51:29,392 --> 01:51:32,478
This is the one from Containment.
It's what Art and Dash saw.

1308
01:51:33,145 --> 01:51:34,856
Watch the water.

1309
01:51:36,274 --> 01:51:40,653
The wind's changed.
The ripples are moving the other way.

1310
01:51:42,738 --> 01:51:45,950
This murder's taking place
at two different times.

1311
01:51:46,033 --> 01:51:48,160
According to the Sentry,
Anderton was watching this

1312
01:51:48,244 --> 01:51:49,871
at Containment
right before he was tagged.

1313
01:51:49,954 --> 01:51:53,040
Well, I know. He came to me,
told me about the missing data stream.

1314
01:51:53,124 --> 01:51:55,001
He was concerned that you might find it.

1315
01:51:55,084 --> 01:51:58,963
Well, he was right. I did find it.
It was inside of Agatha the whole time.

1316
01:51:59,046 --> 01:52:03,634
So the question is, why would someone
want this erased from the data file?

1317
01:52:04,302 --> 01:52:07,972
Danny, just tell me what you're thinking.

1318
01:52:08,973 --> 01:52:11,809
I'm thinking someone
got away with murder.

1319
01:52:12,435 --> 01:52:13,477
How?

1320
01:52:14,145 --> 01:52:16,272
Well, Jad told me
that sometimes the Precogs see

1321
01:52:16,355 --> 01:52:17,899
the same murder more than once.

1322
01:52:18,316 --> 01:52:22,570
- It's called an echo.
- Jad called it "Precog déjá vu."

1323
01:52:22,653 --> 01:52:26,616
Well, we teach the techs
to identify them and disregard.

1324
01:52:26,699 --> 01:52:32,455
Yeah, but what if a technician only
thought he was looking at an echo?

1325
01:52:32,538 --> 01:52:33,915
What if what he was really looking at

1326
01:52:33,998 --> 01:52:36,751
was a completely
different murder altogether?

1327
01:52:36,834 --> 01:52:39,170
I don't understand.

1328
01:52:39,253 --> 01:52:41,672
All you'd have to do is
hire someone to kill Anne Lively,

1329
01:52:41,756 --> 01:52:45,259
someone like a drifter, a neuroin addict,
someone with nothing to lose.

1330
01:52:45,343 --> 01:52:47,970
Precrime stops the murder
from taking place,

1331
01:52:48,054 --> 01:52:53,684
haloes the killer, takes him away.
But then, right then, someone else,

1332
01:52:53,768 --> 01:52:57,104
having reviewed the prevision
and dressed in the same clothes,

1333
01:52:57,188 --> 01:53:00,691
commits the murder
in exactly the same way.

1334
01:53:01,776 --> 01:53:06,489
Technician takes a look,
thinks he's looking at an echo, erases it.

1335
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:13,204
Of course, it would have to be someone

1336
01:53:13,287 --> 01:53:16,123
with access to the previsions
in the first place.

1337
01:53:16,207 --> 01:53:18,501
Someone fairly high up.

1338
01:53:20,962 --> 01:53:22,838
Do you know what I hear?

1339
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:28,386
Nothing. No footsteps up the stairs.

1340
01:53:28,469 --> 01:53:32,181
No hovercraft out the window.
No clickety-click of little spyders.

1341
01:53:32,264 --> 01:53:34,141
Do you know why I can't hear
any of those things, Danny?

1342
01:53:34,225 --> 01:53:37,728
Because right now,
the Precogs can't see a thing.

1343
01:54:02,628 --> 01:54:05,256
Can you see? It's beautiful.

1344
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:09,427
- Where are we going?
- Someplace safe.

1345
01:54:17,143 --> 01:54:19,103
- Burgess.
- Lamar, it's Lara.

1346
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:21,647
- <i>Yes, Lara.</i>
- You have to help him.

1347
01:54:23,149 --> 01:54:25,693
- Is he there?
- Yes.

1348
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:28,863
Has he got the Precog with him?

1349
01:54:31,073 --> 01:54:34,618
- Yes.
- Keep them there. I'm on my way.

1350
01:54:34,994 --> 01:54:38,748
Please. Please don't tell Danny Witwer.
I don't trust him.

1351
01:54:39,832 --> 01:54:41,959
I won't say a word.

1352
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:47,131
You just don't let John leave, all right?

1353
01:54:48,466 --> 01:54:50,176
He's no killer, Lamar.

1354
01:54:50,801 --> 01:54:52,386
I know.

1355
01:55:03,773 --> 01:55:05,274
It's cold.

1356
01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:12,907
Lara, this is Agatha.

1357
01:55:18,329 --> 01:55:23,334
You remember when I would read
<i>Tom Sawyer</i> to you and Sean?

1358
01:55:26,504 --> 01:55:31,342
He got so scared when Tom and Becky
were lost in the cave.

1359
01:55:34,512 --> 01:55:36,222
I gotta sit down.

1360
01:55:37,556 --> 01:55:40,309
I gotta figure this out.

1361
01:55:40,392 --> 01:55:42,520
I gotta figure this out.

1362
01:56:21,976 --> 01:56:23,561
<i>They used Sean.</i>

1363
01:56:25,604 --> 01:56:28,232
They wanted me to
think Crow killed him.

1364
01:56:29,567 --> 01:56:31,068
But he didn't.

1365
01:56:32,736 --> 01:56:34,196
He didn't.

1366
01:56:36,115 --> 01:56:38,409
Why would they set you up?

1367
01:56:46,083 --> 01:56:48,627
Because I found out about her.

1368
01:56:49,753 --> 01:56:51,839
About who?

1369
01:56:51,922 --> 01:56:55,634
- How could I not have seen this?
- Seen what?

1370
01:56:56,927 --> 01:56:58,762
Anne Lively.

1371
01:57:01,473 --> 01:57:02,933
Agatha.

1372
01:57:07,730 --> 01:57:12,359
Dr. Hineman once said, "The dead
don't die. They look on and help."

1373
01:57:13,819 --> 01:57:15,613
Remember that, John.

1374
01:57:17,114 --> 01:57:19,283
- Agatha.
- Sean.

1375
01:57:24,205 --> 01:57:28,751
He's on the beach now, toe in the water.

1376
01:57:30,586 --> 01:57:33,297
He's asking you to come in with him.

1377
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:37,718
He's been racing his mother
up and down the sand.

1378
01:57:39,303 --> 01:57:42,014
There's so much love in this house.

1379
01:57:47,228 --> 01:57:49,146
He's 10 years old.

1380
01:57:51,607 --> 01:57:53,817
He's surrounded by animals.

1381
01:57:55,486 --> 01:57:57,529
He wants to be a vet.

1382
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:03,994
You keep a rabbit for him,
a bird and a fox.

1383
01:58:05,913 --> 01:58:07,706
He's in high school.

1384
01:58:08,165 --> 01:58:11,001
He likes to run, like his father.

1385
01:58:11,543 --> 01:58:14,672
He runs the two-mile and the long relay.

1386
01:58:16,257 --> 01:58:18,008
He's 23.

1387
01:58:19,510 --> 01:58:21,345
He's at a university.

1388
01:58:22,054 --> 01:58:25,182
He makes love
to a pretty girl named Claire.

1389
01:58:25,266 --> 01:58:27,726
He asks her to be his wife.

1390
01:58:28,519 --> 01:58:31,522
He calls here and tells Lara, who cries.

1391
01:58:33,691 --> 01:58:39,196
He still runs across the university and
in the stadium, where John watches.

1392
01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:44,201
Oh, God.
He's running so fast, just like his daddy.

1393
01:58:45,536 --> 01:58:49,039
He sees his daddy.
He wants to run to him.

1394
01:58:51,208 --> 01:58:55,170
But he's only six years old,
and he can't do it.

1395
01:58:56,005 --> 01:58:58,382
And the other man is so fast.

1396
01:59:02,594 --> 01:59:05,264
There was so much love in this house.

1397
01:59:06,432 --> 01:59:08,559
I want him back so bad.

1398
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:13,022
So did she.

1399
01:59:13,856 --> 01:59:15,524
Can't you see?

1400
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:21,947
She just wanted her little girl back.

1401
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:26,702
But it was too late.

1402
01:59:28,662 --> 01:59:31,081
Her little girl was already gone.

1403
01:59:31,832 --> 01:59:33,584
She's still alive.

1404
01:59:35,085 --> 01:59:39,006
She didn't die, but she's not alive.

1405
01:59:41,133 --> 01:59:42,634
Agatha?

1406
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:48,390
Just tell me, who killed your mother?

1407
01:59:49,933 --> 01:59:51,977
Who killed Anne Lively?

1408
01:59:53,729 --> 01:59:58,609
I'm sorry, John,
but you're gonna have to run again.

1409
01:59:59,443 --> 02:00:00,486
What?

1410
02:00:00,569 --> 02:00:03,614
Run!

1411
02:00:18,629 --> 02:00:20,005
I love you.

1412
02:00:20,798 --> 02:00:22,633
- Okay. You're okay.
- No, no.

1413
02:00:22,716 --> 02:00:25,552
- You'll be fine with them.
- No, no.

1414
02:00:25,636 --> 02:00:26,887
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1415
02:00:26,970 --> 02:00:29,056
- John, no.
- Don't talk.

1416
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:48,534
John Anderton.

1417
02:00:49,827 --> 02:00:52,704
By mandate of the
District of Columbia Precrime Division,

1418
02:00:52,788 --> 02:00:57,876
I'm placing you under arrest for the
murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer.

1419
02:01:01,171 --> 02:01:02,589
That's it.

1420
02:01:03,173 --> 02:01:04,842
That's my girl.

1421
02:01:07,010 --> 02:01:09,513
I was so worried about you.

1422
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:14,768
Did he hurt you?

1423
02:01:18,188 --> 02:01:20,065
I missed you so much.

1424
02:01:20,149 --> 02:01:23,986
It's okay. Wally's here. Wally's here.

1425
02:01:29,366 --> 02:01:33,912
You're a part of my flock now, John.
Welcome.

1426
02:01:35,372 --> 02:01:39,960
It's actually kind of a rush.
They say you have visions,

1427
02:01:40,043 --> 02:01:46,258
that your life flashes before your eyes,
that all your dreams come true.

1428
02:02:03,609 --> 02:02:05,611
This is all my fault.

1429
02:02:06,945 --> 02:02:09,448
There was nothing anyone could do.

1430
02:02:12,034 --> 02:02:13,410
Lara...

1431
02:02:14,036 --> 02:02:16,788
I thought you might want to have those.

1432
02:02:23,003 --> 02:02:27,466
I haven't worn this in years. I just wanted
to make sure it fits before tonight.

1433
02:02:27,549 --> 02:02:29,218
You look great.

1434
02:02:29,301 --> 02:02:33,472
I knew he was having trouble for some
time, and yet I did nothing about it.

1435
02:02:33,555 --> 02:02:36,183
Excuse me.
The guy from <i>USA Today</i> is here.

1436
02:02:36,266 --> 02:02:37,309
Tell him not now.

1437
02:02:37,392 --> 02:02:40,604
- He just wanted a few minutes before...
- Not now!

1438
02:02:43,398 --> 02:02:47,069
- I thought you were retiring.
- Well, I was.

1439
02:02:47,152 --> 02:02:52,115
But this incident with John
made me realize the fragility of all this.

1440
02:02:53,492 --> 02:02:56,787
This is John's legacy
as much as it is my own.

1441
02:02:57,621 --> 02:03:00,958
Now I have an obligation to protect that.

1442
02:03:01,583 --> 02:03:05,337
Lara, I know how difficult this is for you.

1443
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:09,925
But maybe you can find
some closure in the fact that

1444
02:03:10,008 --> 02:03:12,928
John finally found the man
who killed your son.

1445
02:03:16,306 --> 02:03:18,058
Who's Anne Lively?

1446
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:22,771
- Who?
- Anne Lively.

1447
02:03:23,564 --> 02:03:27,067
John was talking about her
right before they took him.

1448
02:03:27,150 --> 02:03:29,152
I don't know who that is.

1449
02:03:30,821 --> 02:03:35,909
John said something about him being
set up because he found out about her.

1450
02:03:35,993 --> 02:03:41,081
- Well, we know why John was tagged.
- He also said Crow was a fake.

1451
02:03:41,164 --> 02:03:43,917
And Witwer?
He was killed with John's gun

1452
02:03:44,001 --> 02:03:46,587
- inside John's apartment.
- Lamar, do you know the reason

1453
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:50,048
why John came here to work for you?

1454
02:03:50,132 --> 02:03:51,592
- Sean.
- Yes.

1455
02:03:52,342 --> 02:03:55,762
He came here to work for you
because he thought

1456
02:03:55,846 --> 02:04:00,517
if he could just stop
that kind of thing from happening...

1457
02:04:01,226 --> 02:04:04,396
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

1458
02:04:04,688 --> 02:04:09,026
Sir, they wanna start
the press conference in two minutes.

1459
02:04:09,443 --> 02:04:13,739
Lara, John was the best cop
I ever knew,

1460
02:04:13,822 --> 02:04:17,117
and, in some ways, also the best man.

1461
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,786
But the scars he carried around...

1462
02:04:19,870 --> 02:04:25,417
Well, I know he'd want us to honor the
good things we remember about him.

1463
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:28,295
And I also know why he married you.

1464
02:04:28,378 --> 02:04:30,714
You're as stubborn as he is.

1465
02:04:31,298 --> 02:04:32,299
Lamar...

1466
02:04:32,382 --> 02:04:35,636
Lara, do you know
how to tie one of these?

1467
02:04:35,719 --> 02:04:39,723
Could you please give me a hand?
I'm all thumbs, you see.

1468
02:04:48,065 --> 02:04:50,984
Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1469
02:04:51,068 --> 02:04:55,489
First thing Monday,
I'll look over the Witwer evidence.

1470
02:04:55,572 --> 02:04:59,368
And I'll have Gideon
run the Containment files,

1471
02:04:59,451 --> 02:05:02,496
see if anyone drowned a woman
by the name of...

1472
02:05:02,579 --> 02:05:04,873
What did you say her name was?

1473
02:05:07,417 --> 02:05:09,169
Anne Lively.

1474
02:05:09,753 --> 02:05:12,172
But I never said she drowned.

1475
02:05:32,150 --> 02:05:36,613
- Sir, the press conference is starting.
- I'll be right there.

1476
02:05:41,702 --> 02:05:43,954
We'll talk about this later.

1477
02:05:44,830 --> 02:05:48,834
Perhaps tomorrow
I'll come by the cottage.

1478
02:06:26,163 --> 02:06:28,540
I'd like a word with my husband.

1479
02:06:29,499 --> 02:06:31,835
You're not authorized.

1480
02:06:32,627 --> 02:06:34,838
How did you get in here?

1481
02:06:44,055 --> 02:06:45,432
Thank you.

1482
02:06:45,515 --> 02:06:50,520
Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess,
director of the new National Precrime.

1483
02:06:53,857 --> 02:06:57,194
On behalf of your staff,
we would like to present you with this.

1484
02:06:57,277 --> 02:07:00,697
- Congratulations, sir.
- My God.

1485
02:07:02,407 --> 02:07:03,784
How did you get this?

1486
02:07:03,867 --> 02:07:05,911
I padded your expense account
for six months.

1487
02:07:09,873 --> 02:07:11,583
Revolvers like this one

1488
02:07:11,875 --> 02:07:16,171
were given to generals at the end of
the Civil War by their troops.

1489
02:07:17,172 --> 02:07:21,134
The cylinders were loaded
with five gold-plated bullets

1490
02:07:21,218 --> 02:07:24,054
to symbolize the end
of the destruction and death

1491
02:07:24,137 --> 02:07:27,140
that had ripped the country apart
for five years.

1492
02:07:27,224 --> 02:07:30,936
Ladies and gentlemen,
with Precrime going national,

1493
02:07:31,019 --> 02:07:34,815
maybe we can all look forward
to a time when none of us

1494
02:07:34,898 --> 02:07:38,318
will have to discharge
another firearm ever again.

1495
02:07:39,903 --> 02:07:44,074
Now enjoy yourselves.
Enjoy yourselves! That's an order.

1496
02:07:47,661 --> 02:07:50,789
Does this mean we can finally use
the lake house on weekends?

1497
02:07:50,872 --> 02:07:52,207
I hope so.

1498
02:07:54,501 --> 02:07:57,337
Hello. Yes. Right away.

1499
02:07:58,797 --> 02:08:01,132
Excuse me. Excuse me. So sorry.

1500
02:08:02,133 --> 02:08:03,844
- Sir?
- Yes.

1501
02:08:03,927 --> 02:08:05,846
Sir, you have an emergency call
on your private line.

1502
02:08:05,929 --> 02:08:07,764
All right. Thank you.

1503
02:08:08,431 --> 02:08:10,350
Yes, this is Burgess.

1504
02:08:10,433 --> 02:08:14,312
<i>Hello, Lamar. I just wanted
to congratulate you. You did it.</i>

1505
02:08:15,188 --> 02:08:17,774
<i>You created a world without murder.</i>

1506
02:08:17,858 --> 02:08:20,986
Sir, everyone wants your name on a hat.
Can you sign these for us?

1507
02:08:21,069 --> 02:08:23,613
<i>And all you had to do
was kill someone to do it.</i>

1508
02:08:28,285 --> 02:08:29,286
A-room. Jad.

1509
02:08:30,287 --> 02:08:33,540
Jad, it's Lara. John needs a favor.

1510
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:35,083
I don't know what you're talking about.

1511
02:08:35,166 --> 02:08:38,795
<i>I'm talking about Agatha's mother,
Anne Lively.</i>

1512
02:08:38,879 --> 02:08:41,548
<i>Just a junkie who had a kid once
and had to give her up.</i>

1513
02:08:41,631 --> 02:08:45,927
<i>But surprise. She cleaned herself up
and she wanted her daughter back.</i>

1514
02:08:46,011 --> 02:08:47,679
<i>She wanted Agatha.</i>

1515
02:08:50,932 --> 02:08:52,225
Jad, you getting this?

1516
02:08:52,309 --> 02:08:55,145
It's a single stream from the female only
with no time or incident data.

1517
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:57,772
Whatever this is, it isn't the future.
It already happened.

1518
02:08:57,981 --> 02:09:01,568
<i>The problem was, without Agatha,
there was no Precrime.</i>

1519
02:09:01,651 --> 02:09:04,112
<i>She's always been
the strongest of the three.</i>

1520
02:09:04,195 --> 02:09:06,406
<i>You knew without Agatha,
you had nothing.</i>

1521
02:09:06,489 --> 02:09:08,491
<i>Without her,
you wouldn't be where you are now,</i>

1522
02:09:08,575 --> 02:09:11,202
<i>standing there, signing autographs.</i>

1523
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:21,171
Jad, what are you doing?

1524
02:09:22,047 --> 02:09:23,465
Jad. Jad, what are you doing with that?

1525
02:09:23,548 --> 02:09:24,758
What you up to, big man?

1526
02:09:24,841 --> 02:09:27,260
Jad, Jad, let's think
before you send that.

1527
02:09:27,344 --> 02:09:28,345
Slow down.

1528
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:52,285
<i>So now you had to get rid of
Anne Lively. You had to shut her up,</i>

1529
02:09:52,369 --> 02:09:53,912
<i>which presented a problem.</i>

1530
02:09:53,995 --> 02:09:57,624
<i>How can you kill her
without the Precogs seeing it?</i>

1531
02:09:57,707 --> 02:10:02,128
<i>Simple.
Use a system you control against her.</i>

1532
02:10:02,212 --> 02:10:04,214
<i>So you hired someone to kill her for you,</i>

1533
02:10:04,297 --> 02:10:07,509
<i>knowing full well
the Precogs would see that murder.</i>

1534
02:10:07,592 --> 02:10:10,929
<i>You lured Anne Lively out to the lake</i>

1535
02:10:11,221 --> 02:10:14,891
<i>with the promise
of reuniting her with her daughter.</i>

1536
02:10:59,769 --> 02:11:01,730
<i>Where's my daughter?</i>

1537
02:11:09,029 --> 02:11:10,238
<i>Where?</i>

1538
02:11:12,407 --> 02:11:13,658
Run.

1539
02:11:16,995 --> 02:11:18,121
Run!

1540
02:11:29,966 --> 02:11:33,303
<i>And then, when you were all alone,
you killed her yourself,</i>

1541
02:11:33,386 --> 02:11:37,223
<i>in the same way the Precogs predicted
your John Doe would kill her.</i>

1542
02:11:37,307 --> 02:11:40,060
<i>You made the real murder
look like an echo,</i>

1543
02:11:40,143 --> 02:11:44,647
<i>knowing the tech would do
what he was trained to do. Disregard it.</i>

1544
02:11:51,071 --> 02:11:54,991
<i>Anne Lively became
just another missing person.</i>

1545
02:11:56,201 --> 02:11:58,703
<i>So, what are you gonna do, Lamar?</i>

1546
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:02,082
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

1547
02:12:13,343 --> 02:12:15,095
We got a Red Ball!

1548
02:12:20,850 --> 02:12:23,394
Think about the lives
that little girl has saved.

1549
02:12:23,937 --> 02:12:26,272
Think about the lives
that little girl has saved.

1550
02:12:26,356 --> 02:12:31,236
Think about all the lives she will save.
That little girl could have saved Sean.

1551
02:12:31,528 --> 02:12:34,030
Don't you ever say his name!

1552
02:12:36,533 --> 02:12:39,536
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up.

1553
02:12:39,744 --> 02:12:42,789
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up!

1554
02:12:42,872 --> 02:12:45,792
That was the one thing you knew
that would drive me to murder.

1555
02:12:46,209 --> 02:12:49,379
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?

1556
02:12:49,712 --> 02:12:51,506
- How are you gonna...
- Shut me up?

1557
02:12:51,714 --> 02:12:53,758
Forgive me, John.

1558
02:13:02,433 --> 02:13:04,102
<i>Forgive me, John.</i>

1559
02:13:15,822 --> 02:13:18,408
Lamar, it's over.

1560
02:13:19,701 --> 02:13:24,873
The question you have to ask is,
what are you gonna do now?

1561
02:13:38,261 --> 02:13:40,638
No doubt the Precogs
have already seen this.

1562
02:13:41,139 --> 02:13:42,682
No doubt.

1563
02:13:44,184 --> 02:13:46,352
You see the dilemma, don't you?

1564
02:13:47,103 --> 02:13:51,316
If you don't kill me, Precogs were
wrong and Precrime is over.

1565
02:13:52,442 --> 02:13:56,321
If you do kill me, you go away,

1566
02:13:56,404 --> 02:14:00,325
but it proves the system works.
Precogs were right.

1567
02:14:07,207 --> 02:14:10,043
So, what are you gonna do now?

1568
02:14:11,836 --> 02:14:13,630
What's it worth?

1569
02:14:14,505 --> 02:14:16,341
Just one more murder.

1570
02:14:19,928 --> 02:14:24,557
You'll rot in hell with a halo,
but people will still believe in Precrime.

1571
02:14:24,641 --> 02:14:28,311
All you have to do is kill me,
like they said you would.

1572
02:14:32,482 --> 02:14:37,403
Except you know your own future,

1573
02:14:37,487 --> 02:14:40,907
which means you can change it
if you want to.

1574
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:46,621
You still have a choice, Lamar,
like I did.

1575
02:14:52,210 --> 02:14:54,796
Yes, I have a choice.

1576
02:14:56,297 --> 02:14:57,924
And I made it.

1577
02:14:59,217 --> 02:15:00,885
Forgive me, John.

1578
02:15:02,845 --> 02:15:04,305
Forgive me.

1579
02:15:09,936 --> 02:15:11,688
Forgive me, my boy.

1580
02:15:30,206 --> 02:15:31,541
Lamar!

1581
02:15:43,052 --> 02:15:47,598
<i>In 2054, the six-year Precrime
experiment was abandoned.</i>

1582
02:15:55,565 --> 02:15:58,651
<i>All prisoners were unconditionally
pardoned and released,</i>

1583
02:15:58,735 --> 02:16:03,197
<i>although police departments kept watch
on many of them for years to come.</i>

1584
02:16:50,953 --> 02:16:56,042
<i>Agatha and the twins were transferred
to an undisclosed location,</i>

1585
02:16:57,960 --> 02:17:01,547
<i>a place where they could find relief
from their gifts.</i>

1586
02:17:01,631 --> 02:17:05,259
<i>A place where they could
live out their lives in peace.</i>
