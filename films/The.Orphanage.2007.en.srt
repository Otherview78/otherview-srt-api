1
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,960
One, two, three, knock on the wall!

2
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,080
One, two, three, knock on the wall!

3
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,640
One, two, three, knock on the wall!

4
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,760
One, two, three, knock on the wall!

5
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,280
One, two, three, knock on the wall!

6
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,080
One, two, three, knock on the wall!

7
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,880
One, two, three, knock on the wall!

8
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,480
One, two, three, knock on the wall!

9
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,800
One, two, three, knock on the...

10
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,520
One, two, three, knock on the...

11
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,240
Run! I'm going to catch you!

12
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,480
Good Shepherd Orphanage. Hello?

13
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,520
It's all ready.

14
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,040
She's playing. We haven't told her yet.

15
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,280
Laura will be very happy
in her new home. Don't worry.

16
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,200
See you in the afternoon.

17
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,640
Your friends will miss you a lot, Laura.

18
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Got you!

19
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,400
THE ORPHANAGE

20
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,480
Mommy!

21
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,840
Mommy!

22
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,000
Mommy!

23
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
Mommy!

24
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,440
I'll go, it's my turn.

25
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,560
Mommy!

26
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,160
I'm coming!

27
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,360
Simon!

28
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,400
They're outside. Listen.

29
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,440
Come on, go to sleep.

30
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,520
Simon, darling.

31
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,640
Oh, I see!

32
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,320
Watson and Pepe
have been playing until very late...

33
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,160
and now they can't get in, right?

34
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,680
Come on, in you go.

35
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,000
Aren't you a bit old for this?

36
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,640
Weren't you scared here,
when you were little?

37
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,960
No, darling. You couldn't be afraid.
There was a gang of us...

38
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,000
and the lighthouse was on all night.

39
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,000
- Lighthouse?
- It's still there...

40
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,800
but it doesn't work anymore.

41
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,920
I'll show you tomorrow
when we go to the beach.

42
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,680
Why doesn't it work?

43
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Can you keep a secret?

44
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,760
Actually, it does work.

45
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,840
But the light's invisible,
and it protects us from danger.

46
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,440
Invisible light?

47
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,720
OK, try this.

48
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,840
Look at the window, you'll see.

49
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,080
Over there. Don't move.

50
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,200
Can you see it?

51
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
What? Did you see it?

52
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,080
Those kids that are coming...

53
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,200
why can't they stay at home?

54
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,320
Darling, because they're
special children...

55
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,400
and they need a lot of special care.

56
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,520
They can't come and go,
because they're too far away.

57
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,680
Do you understand?

58
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,880
Can I sleep with you tonight?

59
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,000
You're pushing it!

60
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,160
Dad, are you not coming to the beach?

61
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,240
Aren't Watson and Pepe going?

62
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,240
No, they didn't sleep a wink last night.

63
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,680
You're such a smart-ass!
You have friends only when it suits.

64
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,840
OK, wise guy, take your pill.

65
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,320
"S" for Simon!

66
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,600
Go upstairs and get your bag.
Dad'll meet us there later, OK?

67
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,360
One of us should talk to Simon.

68
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,000
About his invisible friends.

69
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,840
It's normal, don't worry.
He's lonely, he's bored.

70
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,400
He'll forget them
as soon as the real kids arrive.

71
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,640
- Calm down!
- OK.

72
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,480
Everything will work out.

73
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,480
We'll have a great home.

74
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,240
I'm so glad we're here together.

75
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,840
- Pirate.
- Pirate.

76
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
- Cave.
- Cave.

77
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,200
- And lighthouse.
- And lighthouse.

78
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,520
Let's see.

79
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,520
Once upon a time, there was
a very, very bad pirate...

80
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,160
who hid his treasures
in a cave, near a lighthouse.

81
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,880
- And what treasures?
- Stolen treasures.

82
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,000
- But it wasn't easy...
- But...

83
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,400
...to get into the cave.

84
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,720
- They'd click a stone...
- And how did they get in?

85
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,520
...in a gap in the rocks...

86
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,800
...that big stone inside the other stone...

87
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,520
...and the rock did...like this.

88
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
And there's were they used to hide
all of their treasures.

89
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
Hello?

90
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,280
Hello?

91
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,000
Hello?

92
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,440
Siméon?

93
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,520
Simon, let's go!

94
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,040
Siméon?

95
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,200
What's your name?

96
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,200
I'm Simon. Do you want to play?

97
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,840
Why? Can't you play?

98
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,000
Do you want to come to my house
to play later?

99
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,600
Simén...

100
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,200
what are you doing there?

101
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,400
We are playing.

102
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,440
But Watson and Pepe
weren't going to come.

103
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,000
It's not them, it's another boy.

104
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,720
Then tell him to play somewhere else.
It's dangerous here.

105
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,160
Come on, let's go.

106
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,720
Can he come home to play?

107
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,360
Why are you dropping shells, Simon?

108
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,280
It's a path for my friend to follow...

109
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,360
so he can come home and play.

110
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,680
- He made a new friend. How's that?
- Another one?

111
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,960
We won't have room for all these kids.

112
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,080
- Hello.
- Good afternoon.

113
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,400
Sorry I didn't call,
but I couldn't get your number.

114
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,520
I'm Benigna Escobedo.

115
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
I'm a social worker.

116
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,560
I'm sorry you've come so far...

117
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,840
but I hadn't arranged
any interviews for today.

118
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,320
Interviews? No, I'm here for Simon.

119
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,120
What a sitting room!

120
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,560
It's a beautiful house.

121
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,240
How did you find it?

122
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,800
I grew up here. It was an orphanage.

123
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,520
I always wanted to return,
so we thought of the home.

124
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,160
Home?

125
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,280
For special children.
That's not why you came?

126
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,720
You'll need a lot of people for that.

127
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,640
It's not that kind of a home.

128
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,240
We'll be happy with 5 or 6 children.

129
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,960
More would be too complicated, right?

130
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,600
What about Simén?

131
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,000
Yes, yes. Of course.

132
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,440
I received his file yesterday...

133
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,880
and thought, "I should visit them
in case they need anything."

134
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,920
Will you make many changes
in the house?

135
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,920
Sorry, but I don't understand
why you're here.

136
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,000
This information is old.

137
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,960
I know, but I received it all.

138
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,200
There are new treatments,
an experimental program...

139
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,720
that requires an application,
and I thought you might be interested.

140
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,040
As you might know,
my husband is a doctor.

141
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,240
We're aware of all treatments
for Simoén's disease.

142
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,240
Now please leave.

143
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,520
Simon doesn't know he's adopted,
or about his illness...

144
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,840
and I like to deal with these issues
when my husband is at home.

145
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,480
CHANGE OF ADDRESS

146
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,480
HIV POSITIVE

147
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,440
Carlos.

148
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,200
I'll go. It's my turn.

149
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,080
Who's there?

150
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,440
What are you doing here?

151
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,840
Carlos! Carlos!

152
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
What is it?

153
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,840
Planning to bash the old lady's head in?

154
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,560
Sleep with Simon tonight.

155
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,880
If she shows up again,
we'll call the cops.

156
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,840
Mommy!

157
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,600
Mommy!

158
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,080
Can I wake up?

159
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,920
Can I wake up?

160
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,640
Mommy...

161
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,000
- Can I wake up?
- Simén, please.

162
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,840
You are already awake.

163
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,880
You can get up now, darling.

164
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,880
WENDY GREW UP

165
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,360
Wendy grows old and dies?

166
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,080
Wendy grows old, but Peter Pan takes
her daughter to Neverland every year.

167
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,120
Why doesn't Wendy go too?

168
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,720
Well...

169
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,160
If Peter Pan came to get me,
would you come too?

170
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,160
No, I'm too old
to go to Neverland, darling.

171
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,760
- How old are you?
- 37.

172
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,640
At what age will you die?

173
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,000
What sort of question is that?

174
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,000
Not for a long time, until you're very old.

175
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,800
I won't grow old.

176
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm not going to grow up.

177
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,600
Will you be like Peter Pan?

178
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,360
Like my new friends.

179
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,560
- There's more than one?
- Six.

180
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,640
- They won't grow up either?
- They can't.

181
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,520
What are they holding?

182
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,640
Treasures. To play with.

183
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,520
I see. Your invisible friends
play together?

184
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,560
Sure.

185
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,560
They steal your treasure...

186
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,760
something you love,
and you have to find it.

187
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,520
That's the game?
Finding what they took from you?

188
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,800
Yes, but following the clues.

189
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,160
If you find it, they grant you a wish.

190
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,840
Well, now. And you have a treasure?

191
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,680
Special coins.

192
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,000
An old man left them in the park.
I think they're gold...

193
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,760
and very valuable.

194
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,640
Want to see them?

195
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,560
Don't look yet.

196
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,320
- Where'd you get all this?
- I found it.

197
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,520
What's this?

198
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,160
The first ice cream I had
after my tonsil operation.

199
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,640
The special coins.

200
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,920
They're not coins,
they're your baby teeth.

201
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,080
- Where'd you find them?
- Can't you see?

202
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,320
They're the first clue.
They've got my coins.

203
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,760
You want to play treasure hunt?

204
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,160
The game's started.

205
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,520
Remember where you kept
my baby teeth.

206
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,800
If I find my treasure, I can make a wish.

207
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,880
Sand. Where do you find sand?

208
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,480
You set this up, right?

209
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,720
- The beach?
- No, no, it has to be at home.

210
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,360
What's this?

211
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,600
The sewing box!

212
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
Simon, wait!

213
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,920
Come on, hurry up!

214
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,080
This rings a bell.

215
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,120
I know, the key in the kitchen!

216
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,960
My treasure!

217
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,800
- Those are Daddy's...
- I can make a wish! I can make a wish!

218
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,400
- I can make a wish!
- Leave that alone!

219
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,040
- I can make a wish!
- Simon!

220
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,400
Those are our things,
you shouldn't touch them.

221
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,480
- Is that clear?
- I didn't. It was them!

222
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,440
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying.

223
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,000
You're lying! You say you're my mother...

224
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,040
and you're not!

225
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,680
- What?
- You're not my mother.

226
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,560
- Who told you that?
- My friend told me.

227
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,080
- What friend?
- Tomas.

228
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,000
Tomas told me the truth,
that I'm just like them...

229
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,920
I have no mother or father!
And I'm going to die!

230
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,200
You're not my mother, you're a liar!

231
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,440
We wanted you to be a bit older
to talk about certain things.

232
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,680
If you want to ask us anything...

233
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,120
Is Santa Claus a lie too?

234
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,360
Listen, Simon...

235
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,080
you heard Mommy and that lady talking...

236
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,680
saw the envelope
and invented the game...

237
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,400
because you were afraid to ask about it.

238
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
What if I don't take them?

239
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,400
Nothing would happen.

240
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,600
If I don't take them,
how soon would I die?

241
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,240
It would take many days,
many weeks, even, right?

242
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Don't worry, we'll take care of you.
You won't get sick or die.

243
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,360
OK?

244
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,720
You don't love me! It's a lie! It's a lie!

245
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,160
It's a lie! It's a lie!

246
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,040
Simdén, come down, son!

247
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,040
Simon!

248
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,600
Simon!

249
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,040
Hurry, the first kids are here! Come on!

250
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,080
We can't go yet.
I want to show you something.

251
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,040
- Really? What is it?
- Tomas' little house.

252
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,400
- Not now. Tomorrow, when we are alone.
- No!

253
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,320
- Not now, Simon.
- Now!

254
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,480
Go downstairs right now!

255
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,520
I don't want to!

256
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,400
- Go downstairs!
- I said come and see Tomas' house!

257
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,560
OK, if you don't want
to go downstairs, don't.

258
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
No one is forcing you.

259
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,160
WELCOME

260
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,280
Where is the mask?

261
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,320
Siméon?

262
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,480
Simon!

263
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,640
Siméon?

264
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,840
Darling!

265
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,040
Darling?

266
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,520
Simon!

267
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,800
Siméon?

268
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,920
Simon, darling.

269
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,800
Carlos!

270
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,040
What's going on?

271
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
Darling!

272
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,320
Siméon?

273
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,480
Simon!

274
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,520
Simon!

275
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,960
Simon!

276
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,520
Simon!

277
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,800
Simon!

278
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,360
Simon! Simon!

279
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,440
Simon!

280
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,200
Simon!

281
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,160
Simon! Simon!

282
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,600
Simon!

283
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,720
Darling! Simén!

284
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,160
Simon!

285
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,960
Laura!

286
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,840
No!

287
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,640
The tide is rising!

288
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,280
Simon!

289
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,640
Simon!

290
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,640
Simon!

291
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,080
- Simon!
- Laura!

292
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,680
He's over there, He's over there, Carlos!

293
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,560
There's no one, Laura! Come on.

294
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,600
- There's no one! We can't stay here!
- He's there, Carlos!

295
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,720
EMERGENCIES

296
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,080
Carlos is here.

297
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,360
He spoke to the police...

298
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,400
and now he wants to talk to you
if you feel better.

299
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,880
How are you?

300
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,600
He's not in the cave.

301
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,640
But I saw someone, Carlos.

302
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,400
You must have imagined it
in all the confusion.

303
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,320
Believe me, he wasn't there.

304
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,160
I'm Pilar.

305
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,240
I know it's hard, but you must know
we're doing all we can...

306
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,400
to locate your son as soon as possible.

307
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,760
Pilar is a psychologist.

308
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,920
She works with the police.

309
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,440
They're working hard to find Simén.

310
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,280
I have a few questions.

311
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,240
Your husband told me
about the adoption...

312
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
and your son's illness.

313
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,080
As he was adopted...

314
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,360
there are possibilities we must consider.

315
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,360
What possibilities?

316
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,360
He could have been kidnapped
by a relative.

317
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,440
I heard you recently found...

318
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,400
a woman intruder on the grounds.

319
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,440
Benigna Escobedo, a social worker,
came a few days ago.

320
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,320
We can't find a social worker
with that name.

321
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,880
Could you describe her?

322
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,520
She was about 70, with white hair...

323
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,040
pale eyes, very thick glasses.

324
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,120
Don't worry, we will find her.

325
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,000
You can be sure of that.

326
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,640
How can they trust me
with their kids after this?

327
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,000
Let's do something.

328
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,840
Wear my grandmother's Saint Anthony
medal, you know I'm very fond of it.

329
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,560
To bring us good luck.

330
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,640
You don't believe that.

331
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,960
Exactly. It will work if you have it.

332
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,800
But it's not a present,
I am lending it to you.

333
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,880
Give it back when we find Simon.

334
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,040
Carlos!

335
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,600
Carlos!

336
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,760
Simon Sanchez's parents
feel more and more forsaken.

337
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:56,240
The 7-year-old boy disappeared
from his home 6 months ago.

338
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
The situation is even more desperate...

339
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,680
because Simon is ill and needs
daily medication. His parents...

340
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,720
My son disappeared 6 months ago.

341
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,720
His name is Simon.

342
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,240
There are posters everywhere.
You may have seen them.

343
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,040
We've tried everything...

344
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,320
but not one clue...

345
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,680
not even a trace.

346
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,480
My son had imaginary friends.

347
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,440
We never paid much attention...

348
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,440
but I have the feeling
they're in the house.

349
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,080
I saw my daughter.

350
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,320
A year after her death.

351
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,280
It was at night, we were asleep.

352
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,960
I woke up...

353
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,040
and without knowing why,
I went to her room.

354
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,000
And there she was.

355
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,000
Smiling. Calm.

356
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,840
I think that was her way of telling me...

357
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,160
"I'm fine, I'm safe.

358
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,920
"Don't suffer for me."

359
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,560
It is not unusual to feel, in some way...

360
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,680
the presence of a loved one
after their death.

361
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,880
All of us in this bereavement group
could tell you similar stories.

362
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,200
You don't understand.

363
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,840
My son is not dead.

364
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,040
His friends took him. I saw one of them
the same day he vanished.

365
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,560
He was at home.

366
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,160
I'll do whatever it takes
to recover my son.

367
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,040
I'm not crazy...

368
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,920
believe me.

369
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,800
I know what I'm saying.

370
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,160
...Cities on state of alert
due to gales, rain and snow.

371
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,360
The heaviest snowfalls
will be recorded in the north.

372
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,280
North of Asturias.
Tonight, in some cities...

373
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,080
20 cm of snow are expected
in the Cantabrian Mountains region...

374
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,280
cities that usually end up isolated
during these storms. And...

375
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,720
It's her.

376
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,240
The woman who came to the house.

377
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,400
Benigna?

378
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,600
Simon!

379
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,360
He destroyed her. He destroyed her.

380
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,600
She's dead.

381
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,320
We went to Benigna's house.
We found some pictures...

382
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,000
and old Super 8 films.

383
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,360
I'd like you to see them.

384
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,120
Are any of the faces familiar?

385
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,960
Antonia, the principal,
and these are the orphans. My friends.

386
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,760
This is Martin.
She liked to be called Martin.

387
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,160
Rita.

388
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,960
Victor... I think his name was Guillermo.

389
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,960
That's Alicia, she was blind.

390
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,480
And this is me.

391
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,360
- Benigna?
- The woman that went to your house...

392
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,600
worked at the orphanage.

393
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,240
That's impossible. I'd remember.

394
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,040
She wasn't there very long.

395
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,360
She had a son. Tomas.

396
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,040
It seems that the child
was born deformed...

397
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,960
he was kept away from the others.

398
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,720
No one knew about him.

399
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,880
It was a total shock for the village
when they found the body.

400
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,760
What do you mean?

401
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,120
It seems he disappeared while playing.

402
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,760
CHILD'S BODY FOUND ON BEACH

403
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,000
Shortly after your adoption.

404
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,440
One of the orphans later confessed...

405
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,800
that they had played a trick on him.

406
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,400
They went into the caves with Tomas...

407
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,360
and took his mask off
to see if he'd come out.

408
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,440
But he never emerged. He drowned.

409
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,880
They found his body at low tide.

410
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,640
The children weren't blamed.
They were only playing.

411
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,160
That boy was in my house.

412
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,920
We asked everyone at the opening party.

413
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,480
No one remembers a child
with a sack over his head.

414
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,040
I can't remember what it's like
to sleep through the night.

415
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,080
I can't stop thinking.

416
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,280
Remember what we called Simon
when we met him?

417
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,120
"Two Little Kilos".

418
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,080
You used to say,
"My two little extra kilos."

419
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,640
That's all he weighed.

420
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,960
The doctors said it wasn't enough.

421
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,240
But it was plenty for us.

422
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,200
Although we knew that...

423
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:14,040
there was little chance
he could ever be normal.

424
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,400
But when we saw him...

425
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,880
saw his smile for the first time...

426
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,160
his eyes, his bright eyes...

427
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,200
Simon made us strong, Carlos.

428
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,680
Together, we're strong.

429
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,400
Together.

430
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,960
Forgive me if I get upset, but it's hard.

431
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,200
Carlos, someone's in the bathroom.

432
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,240
- What is it?
- Someone was here.

433
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,400
Carlos, don't give me that look.
Feel, it's still warm.

434
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,440
Sure, I just got up.

435
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,160
Someone got into the bed.

436
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,280
I'm convinced.

437
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,520
That's what Jung means when he says...

438
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:57,240
it's in the subconscious that
the living coexist with the dead.

439
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:02,360
The Germans have another name
for "the herald of death".

440
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,080
Doppelganger.

441
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,720
A being that appears in one's own image.

442
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,120
A double.

443
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,920
To glance at him...

444
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,720
or at any of the others I've shown you...

445
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,520
means, without the slightest doubt...

446
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,880
a passport to the other world.

447
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,920
How long has your son been missing?

448
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,720
Nine months.

449
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:38,480
Strange things are happening.
Things linked to his disappearance.

450
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,120
I don't know who to turn to.

451
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,560
It's not that simple.

452
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,480
You won't find an exorcist
in the yellow pages.

453
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,920
I tore it from my son's kidnapper's clothes.

454
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,920
The police say he's been dead
for over 30 years.

455
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,480
Someone has my son.

456
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,880
I don't know why.
But I won't sit at home and wait.

457
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,840
There's someone in this field,
someone I trust.

458
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,480
I'm talking from the heart.

459
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,880
Would you allow a medium
to visit your home?

460
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,880
This wasn't a children's room
in the orphanage, right?

461
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,760
No, the bedroom was back there.

462
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,760
Then we should start here.

463
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,280
Enrique.

464
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,680
Perfect, give me an hour.

465
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,200
I want an old object from this house...

466
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,480
something related to its history,
and, if possible...

467
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,720
some clothing from the past.

468
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,200
We're not alone.

469
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,040
There's a police psychologist, Pilar...

470
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,120
who would really like
to attend the session.

471
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,280
If you don't mind.

472
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,880
Perfect. Perfect.

473
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Cops are cool!

474
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,520
What does she need that doll for?

475
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,160
Aurora needs an object
to facilitate her trance.

476
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,840
Clothing and objects get her into it...

477
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,720
and begin the regression.

478
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,240
- Regression?
- A psychic summoning.

479
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,160
Past, present and future
are superimposed, and cross.

480
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,800
Like a sort of time travel.

481
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,720
It may sound like witchcraft...

482
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,360
but you mustn't fear parallel perception.

483
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,120
If there's anything, Aurora will see it.

484
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,360
If there's anything, I hope we'll all see it.

485
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,520
Everything's ready, Enrique.

486
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,440
Ready, whenever you want.

487
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,040
- Aurora, can you hear me?
- Perfectly. I'm ready.

488
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,760
Here we go.

489
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,520
Everything around you
is beginning to fade.

490
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,520
Darkness is forming
a circle around you...

491
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,120
it's closing in on you.

492
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,200
Everything is fading.
We're no longer here.

493
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:31,000
Now you're alone in the darkness...

494
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,720
and the darkness begins to disappear.

495
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,320
I'm going to count down...

496
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,640
from ten...

497
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,000
and once I've finished...

498
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:47,760
you can go wherever you want...

499
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,040
and will be able to see...

500
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:54,200
anyone who is hiding in this house.

501
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,280
Ten...

502
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,040
nine...

503
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,280
eight...

504
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,320
seven...

505
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,080
SIX...

506
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,880
five...

507
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,600
four...

508
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,320
three...

509
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,080
two...

510
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,320
one.

511
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,640
You can open your eyes.

512
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,840
It's cold...

513
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,920
the window is open.

514
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,800
Aurora...

515
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,640
I want you to look around you.

516
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,880
Is there anyone with you in the room?

517
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,480
I can hear someone.

518
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,200
I can hear...

519
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,800
I can hear something.

520
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,040
I can hear something.

521
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,160
The sound comes and goes.

522
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,400
I can't hear it anymore.

523
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,480
I think I've lost them.

524
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,280
I can hear something.

525
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,760
...all alone.

526
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,720
...all alone.

527
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,920
Children...

528
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I'm sure it's children.

529
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:25,640
At the end of the hall. I think it's them.

530
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,040
I can't open it.

531
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,360
It's closed.

532
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,360
But there's someone.

533
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,800
Why are you crying?

534
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,480
- We're sick!
- Who's sick?

535
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,400
I won't hurt you.

536
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,200
Don't be afraid. Open the door.

537
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,600
Don't be afraid.

538
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,680
Open the door.

539
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,600
We want you to open the door!

540
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,160
What have they done to you?

541
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,440
What have they done?

542
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,920
Aurora...

543
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,800
tell me what you see.

544
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,600
Five children.

545
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,200
They're very sick. They're crying.

546
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,280
What happened?

547
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,880
They're dying.

548
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,920
Who would want to poison you?

549
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,800
Someone's going to kill us.

550
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,400
Someone's going to kill us.

551
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,480
Is my son there?

552
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,560
Aurora, is Simon with you?

553
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,240
Is Simon here?

554
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,920
Aurora? Aurora, can you hear me?

555
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,960
Let's get her.

556
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,240
Aurora, stay in the middle of the room.

557
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,720
I'll count from ten.

558
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,320
Ten...

559
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,440
nine...

560
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,840
eight...

561
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,360
seven...

562
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,840
SIX...

563
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,360
five...

564
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,600
four...

565
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,000
three...

566
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,040
two...

567
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,600
one.

568
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,720
I was in this house, but...

569
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,360
everything was different.

570
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,800
The beds, the toys, the décor,
everything was much older.

571
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,960
The light from the lighthouse
came through the windows.

572
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,760
Are you sure you didn't see Simon?

573
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,040
It was too dark, I'm sorry.

574
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,520
I couldn't recognize anyone.

575
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,000
But the children were there.

576
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,680
You saw the children. Is that right?

577
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,480
- That's right.
- You're talking about ghosts.

578
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:50,000
And what is a ghost, Carlos?

579
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,840
There's something here,
and we all saw it.

580
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,560
When something terrible happens...

581
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:01,080
sometimes it leaves a trace...

582
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,440
a wound that acts...

583
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,480
as a knot between two time lines.

584
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:10,160
It's like an echo...

585
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,160
repeated over and over,
waiting to be heard.

586
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,640
Like a scar...

587
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,280
Oh, I'm sorry.

588
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,320
Like a scar or a pinch...

589
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,440
that begs for a caress to relieve it.

590
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,040
Laura...

591
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,960
we who are close to death...

592
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:39,480
we are more receptive
to these messages.

593
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,480
You mean my son
could see those children...

594
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,800
because...

595
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,760
Well, Laura... I think that's enough.

596
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,800
Please take your things and leave.

597
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,600
Carlos, we can't let them go like this.

598
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,880
Laura, this is a farce...

599
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,760
a sideshow trick.

600
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,520
I can't believe this. Why?

601
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,440
For what reason?
They're right, aren't they?

602
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,600
- They don't want money.
- Not yet.

603
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,080
What should I do?

604
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,720
Tell me, what should I do?

605
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,000
Over a long time,
the police haven't found a single clue...

606
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,200
not a single clue...

607
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,800
as to where my son can be,
whether dead or alive.

608
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,760
What do I do, just sit and wait?

609
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,320
Can it hurt to listen?

610
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,200
- Laura, stop!
- No, you stop!

611
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,320
Tell me, Pilar...

612
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,360
how many similar cases
have you had in this damned village?

613
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,920
Get another distraction,
I didn't invite you here.

614
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,760
What should I do?

615
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,200
My dear...

616
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,520
you are a good mother.

617
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,920
Your pain gives you strength,
it will guide you.

618
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,520
But only you know
how far you are willing to go...

619
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,280
to find your son.

620
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,480
I don't know what to do.

621
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,800
You hear, but don't listen.

622
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,880
Seeing is not believing.
It's the other way around.

623
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,240
Believe...

624
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,880
and you will see.

625
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,240
THE SEARCH FOR SIMON CONTINUES

626
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,600
What are you doing?

627
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,600
We can't stay here any longer.

628
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,720
We should go, at least for a while.

629
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,960
The children are here.
Aurora saw them. I can't leave.

630
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,320
You heard the voices.

631
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,480
Enrique was upstairs for one hour,
playing around with the cables.

632
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,320
Can't you see it could be a set-up?

633
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,240
That's Pilar's theory, a set-up?

634
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,640
- Her rational theory?
- Pilar is protecting us.

635
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,360
From what?

636
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,920
Things like this evening.

637
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,480
People entering our home
and fucking up our lives even more.

638
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,760
- They just want to help.
- Help?

639
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,680
Didn't you hear them?

640
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,680
Did they mention finding Simon?

641
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,200
No. They just want
to contact the dead, Laura.

642
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:38,200
If Simén's alive,
I can't see how they can help us.

643
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,880
If he's not, they won't recover him.

644
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,720
I'm neither willing nor able
to keep taking this shit.

645
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,880
Please, Laura, let's leave this house.

646
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,880
Carlos, you can't ask me to give up.
Neither you nor Pilar.

647
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,480
Laura, we can survive this. Many couples
lose a child and pull through.

648
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:05,160
I just want to be with Simén,
don't you understand?

649
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:08,640
If you want to go, I can't stop you.
I just want to see him, Carlos...

650
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,280
that's all I want!

651
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,520
Where are you?

652
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,200
I'm not afraid.

653
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,160
You want to play?

654
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,160
Are you playing with me?

655
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,360
Benigna?

656
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,320
God, don't let it be him.

657
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,440
Please. Please,
don't let it be Simén. Please.

658
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,400
- There are five, right?
- Yes.

659
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,320
All my friends.

660
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,640
Martin, Rita, Alicia, Guillermo, Victor.

661
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,360
Benigna killed them.

662
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,720
That's why she went back to the shed,
to recover their bodies.

663
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,840
I've thought it out.

664
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,400
Their game killed Tomas...

665
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,520
and now they're playing
with Simén and me, don't you get it?

666
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:04,360
Simon's in danger
and I don't know how to play.

667
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,520
I don't know how to play.

668
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,440
- Laura, you're making it up.
- Carlos, I saw it myself.

669
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,480
And this afternoon?
Who laid out the clues?

670
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,600
Simon made it all up
to get your attention.

671
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:15,680
Who?

672
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,480
Tell me! Come on, who?

673
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,600
I've packed. I don't want us to stay here.

674
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,600
I can't leave yet.

675
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,640
I won't live here...

676
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,640
and you're not staying alone.

677
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,640
I can't just leave,
there are too many memories, Carlos.

678
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,720
I have to say goodbye.

679
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,040
Two days.

680
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,160
Alone.

681
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,080
Please, I need this.

682
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,080
Please.

683
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,360
Please bless what you have given us.

684
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:19,360
Thank you for letting us
gather once again...

685
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:23,120
and be together.

686
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:53,360
What else do you want from me?

687
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,520
What more must I do?
What more must I do?

688
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,680
I have no time, I have no time.

689
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,760
I have no time,
I have no time, I have no time.

690
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:15,440
You want to keep playing? Is that it?

691
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,880
Let's make a deal. I'll play a while...

692
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,160
then you tell me where Simén is, OK?

693
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,160
OK?

694
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,320
OK?

695
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:56,000
One, two, three, knock on the wall!

696
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,080
One, two, three, knock on the wall.

697
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,600
One...

698
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,560
One, two, three, knock on the wall.

699
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:44,840
One, two, three, knock on the wall.

700
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:59,640
One, two, three, knock on the wall.

701
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,520
One, two, three, knock on the wall.

702
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,120
One, two, three...

703
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,200
Wait, wait, wait! No.

704
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,240
Wait, I won't hurt you.
I just want to find Simon.

705
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:00,560
Siméon?

706
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,520
Mommy, why are you crying?

707
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,320
Oh, my darling!

708
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:17,840
Are you OK? You're freezing.

709
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,320
Don't worry about a thing.

710
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,960
Don't be afraid, I'll get you out.

711
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,920
Stay and play with us.

712
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,400
No, darling, we can't stay to play.

713
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:45,360
Listen to me, Simon.

714
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:49,960
Imagine it's just you and me here. OK?

715
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,000
Think about before we came
to this house.

716
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:54,600
Remember, darling?

717
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:57,080
Think only about that, OK?

718
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,720
Think only about that...

719
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,080
think about Daddy...

720
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,120
think about next Christmas...

721
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:06,360
and all the things we'll do together.

722
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,880
So many things, darling!

723
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:11,680
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes, tight, tight, tight, tight.

724
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:14,520
That's it, really tight...

725
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:18,520
and think about what you'll be
when you grow up.

726
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:20,760
What would you like to be, darling?

727
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:24,640
Think about the schools you'll go to,
the friends you'll make.

728
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:28,640
And just believe for a moment that...

729
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:34,600
that Tomas and the other children
aren't real.

730
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,600
This is a fantasy, my darling...

731
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,880
like a nightmare.

732
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:46,880
Do it for me, Siméon, OK?

733
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,160
When you open your eyes...

734
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,280
make them go away.

735
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,280
Please. Please, make them go away.

736
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,640
Please.

737
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,840
Close your eyes, darling...

738
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:21,600
and keep on playing with me, OK?

739
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,560
Keep on playing, darling, OK?

740
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,360
- What is it?
- Tomas' little house.

741
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,360
Nooo!

742
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,120
No!

743
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:32,000
Nooooo!

744
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:39,520
Nooooo!

745
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,400
I found you. This isn't fair.

746
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,200
I found you.

747
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,640
I want Simon back.

748
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,120
Mommy, Mommy, can I wake up?

749
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:22,360
Of course you can, darling.
Of course you can.

750
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:29,120
Mommy, Mommy...

751
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:31,320
I found the special coins.

752
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,400
Now I just have to make a wish.

753
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:38,000
I wish you'd stay and look after all of us.

754
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,120
It's Laura!

755
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:40,880
It's Laura!

756
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,240
Laura!

757
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:52,880
She's grown old, like Wendy in the story.

758
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,800
It's Laura.

759
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,440
Laura.

760
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:02,720
It's Laura.

761
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:07,240
Come, don't be afraid.

762
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:14,360
The house. The beach. The lost children.

763
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,240
Once upon a time...

764
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:23,960
there was a house near the beach...

765
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:26,840
where the lost children lived...

766
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:08,240
In memory of Laura and Simén...

767
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,280
and of the orphans...

768
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:14,240
Martin, Rita,
Guillermo, Alicia, Victor, and Tomas.

769
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:36,320
THE ORPHANAGE
