1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,405
They say Japan was made
by a sword.

3
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,952
They say the old gods dipped
a coral blade into the ocean...

4
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,915
...and when they pulled it out, four
perfect drops fell back into the sea...

5
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,544
...and those drops became
the islands of Japan.

6
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:50,633
I say Japan was made
by a handful of brave men.

7
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,721
Warriors willing to give their lives...

8
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,599
...for what seems to have become
a forgotten word:

9
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,268
Honor.

10
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:59,035
Ladies and gentlemen:
Winchester.

11
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,788
America's leader in all forms
of armament used...

12
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,498
...by the United States Army...

13
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:08,586
...celebrates our nation's centennial
by bringing you a true American hero.

14
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,842
One of the most decorated warriors
this country has ever known.

15
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,512
Winner of the Medal of Honor
for his gallantry...

16
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,640
San Francisco, 1876.
...on the hallowed ground of Gettysburg.

17
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,643
He is late of the 7th Cavalry...

18
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,939
...and their triumphant campaign against
the most savage of the Indian nations.

19
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:32,444
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you:

20
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,739
Captain Nathan Algren!

21
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:47,167
Captain Nathan Algren!

22
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,169
Yes!

23
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,628
Yes!

24
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,716
One moment,
ladies and gentlemen.

25
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,763
Goddamn you, Algren,
get out there!

26
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:04,142
This is your last performance!
You're fired! Now get out there!

27
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,271
Come on! I'm sick of this!

28
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,773
Come on!

29
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,359
Yes!

30
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,370
My thanks, Mr. McCabe,
you are too kind.

31
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,041
This, ladies and gents...

32
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,294
...is the gun that's winning the West.

33
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,631
Why, many's the time
I've found myself...

34
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,886
...surrounded by a swarm of...

35
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,099
...angry hostiles...

36
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,935
...with nothing but this rifle...

37
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:51,773
...between me and a certain
and gruesome death.

38
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,235
And let me tell you, folks,
the red man...

39
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,446
...is a fearsome enemy.

40
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,407
And if he'd had his way...

41
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,910
...why, this scalp of mine
would be long gone...

42
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,664
...and there'd be a balder man
standing before you today.

43
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,131
Like those poor bastards out there...

44
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,925
...on the Little Bighorn.

45
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,179
Bodies stripped bare...

46
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,266
...mutilated.

47
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,020
Left to rot in the sun.

48
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:38,611
This, ladies and gentlemen,
the 73 lever-action...

49
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,613
...Trapper.

50
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:45,368
It's got a seven-shot capacity. Accurate
400 yards, one round per second.

51
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,913
Son, have you ever seen
what this could do to a man?

52
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,958
This would blow a hole
in your daddy six inches wide.

53
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,460
That's right, missy.

54
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,503
This beauty.

55
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,175
You could kill yourself five, six, seven
braves without ever having to reload.

56
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:04,220
Note the patented loading port
and the smooth cocking action.

57
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:24,199
My thanks on behalf
of those who died...

58
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,994
...in the name of better
mechanical amusements...

59
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,497
...and commercial opportunities.

60
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,167
Mr. McCabe here will take your orders.

61
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,670
God bless you all.

62
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,681
I must say, captain, you have a flair
for the old melodrama.

63
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,184
You're alive.
I am, indeed.

64
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,438
Your man Custer says to me,
"We're going to the Little Bighorn."

65
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,025
Says I, "What's this 'we' stuff?"
It's the walking ticket for me.

66
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,986
Nine lives I have.
But I'll tell you what else I have.

67
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,155
I have a good job for the both of us.

68
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,991
God knows it looks
as if you'll need one real soon.

69
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,202
What kind of a job?

70
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:14,165
The only job you're fit for, boyo.
A man's job.

71
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,212
Unless, of course, you got your heart
set on a career in the theater.

72
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,926
Nathan!

73
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,387
Just listen to what
your man has to say.

74
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,556
Been a while.
It's good to see you.

75
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,684
I'd like you to meet
Mr. Omura from Japan...

76
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:36,688
...and his associate, whose name
I've given up trying to pronounce.

77
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,148
Sit down, please.

78
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,238
Whiskey.

79
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:50,869
Now, Japan's got it in mind
to become a civilized country.

80
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,913
And Mr. Omura here is willing
to spend what it takes...

81
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,750
...to hire white experts
to train their army.

82
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,918
And if we play our cards right...

83
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,714
...the Emperor grants the U.S.
exclusive rights to supply arms.

84
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,599
Well, I have an agreement
with Winchester Company.

85
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,061
I'm certain Mr. Omura has some concept
of what an agreement is.

86
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:21,649
Your performances for the Winchester
Company bring you $25 a week.

87
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,486
We will pay you $400 a month.

88
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,035
Five. For each.

89
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:36,706
And another 500
when we get the job done.

90
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,753
How many other genuine heroes
you got lined up?

91
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,839
He's rude.

92
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,218
That's how it is here. A land of cheap traders.

93
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,220
Whiskey.

94
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,181
So who will we be training
your boys to fight?

95
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,936
His name is Katsumoto Moritsugu.
He was once the Emperor's teacher.

96
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,272
He's Samurai.
Samurai?

97
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,775
The word you might use is "warrior."

98
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:07,529
Mr. Omura is familiar with our
experiences dealing with renegades.

99
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,656
Is he?

100
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,491
He's even read your book.

101
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,785
Captain Algren's study of the tribes...

102
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,830
...was a crucial factor
in our defeat of the Cheyenne.

103
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,804
Please excuse. What is funny?

104
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:39,561
The corps back together again.
It's just so...

105
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,772
...inspiring!

106
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,446
Excuse me.

107
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,993
I need to use the necessities.

108
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,583
This isn't a problem.
I'll just talk to him for a minute.

109
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,251
Colonel Bagley.

110
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:07,005
We contacted you because you are
Captain Algren's superior officer...

111
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,632
...and you assured us
of his participation.

112
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,053
He'll do it.
I just need a minute.

113
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:16,973
Nathan.

114
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,770
I did what I was ordered
to do out there.

115
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,147
And I have no remorse.

116
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,859
So, what do you say we
put the past behind us?

117
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,908
You want me to kill Jappos, I'll kill Jappos.

118
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,119
I'm not asking you to kill anybody.
You want me to kill the enemies of Jappos...

119
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,829
...I'll kill the enemies of Jappos.

120
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,708
Rebs or Sioux or Cheyenne...

121
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,379
For 500 bucks a month,
I'll kill whoever you want.

122
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,964
But keep one thing in mind...

123
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,386
...I'd happily kill you for free.

124
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,779
July 12th, 1876.

125
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,532
There is some comfort
in the emptiness of the sea.

126
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:20,161
No past, no future.

127
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:26,376
And then at once, I am confronted by
the hard truth of present circumstances.

128
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:34,718
I have been hired to help suppress
the rebellion of yet another tribal leader.

129
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,638
Apparently, this is the only job
for which I am suited.

130
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,894
I am beset by the ironies of my life.

131
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,467
Captain Algren, I presume?
Yes.

132
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,095
Jolly good. How do you do?
Simon Graham.

133
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,765
Twenty years ago,
this was a sleepy little town.

134
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,266
Now look at it.

135
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,645
You see, the Emperor is mad
for all things Western...

136
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,856
...and the Samurai believe
it's changing too fast.

137
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:15,110
The ancient and the modern
are at war for the soul of Japan.

138
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,279
So your new employer, Mr. Omura,
is bringing in...

139
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,657
...every Western expert he can get.

140
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:24,744
Lawyers from France, engineers from
Germany, architects from Holland...

141
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,331
...and now, of course,
warriors from America.

142
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:33,086
I came over with the British
trade mission, oh, years ago.

143
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,130
I was soon relieved of my position.

144
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,882
I had an unfortunate tendency
to tell the truth...

145
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,844
...in a country where no one ever
says what they mean.

146
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:45,390
So now, I very accurately translate
other people's lies.

147
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,857
For 2 000 years, no emperor
was even seen by a commoner.

148
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:58,611
You have to realize what an honor this
is. It's all highly ritualized, of course.

149
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,656
You may look at him, but do not speak
unless spoken to, obviously.

150
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,827
If he stands, you must bow.
If he bows, you must bow lower.

151
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,039
Do I look presentable?
I haven't worn this in a decade.

152
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,375
Rather snug around the midriff.

153
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,392
And bow.

154
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,605
The divine Emperor Meiji
bids you welcome.

155
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:37,025
He is grateful for the assistance
your country offers.

156
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,278
We hope to accomplish
the same national harmony...

157
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,864
...you enjoy in your homeland.

158
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,625
The Emperor is most interested
in your American Indians...

159
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,211
...if you have fought
against them in battle.

160
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,506
We have, Your Highness.
The red man is a brutal adversary.

161
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,183
The Emperor wishes
to ask Captain Algren...

162
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,061
...if it is true they wear eagle feathers...

163
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:16,272
...and paint their faces
before going into battle...

164
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,650
...and that they have no fear.

165
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,571
They are very brave.

166
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,665
Bow.

167
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,260
Thank you very much.

168
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,982
And step back.

169
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:04,612
Step back, step back and turn.

170
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,076
Right, you little bastards!

171
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,913
You will stand up straight
or I will personally shit-kick...

172
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,584
...every Far Eastern buttock
that appears before my eyes!

173
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,463
Well done, sergeant.

174
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,841
When you understand the language, sir,
everything falls into piece.

175
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,844
The first rank will kneel,
rifles at the ready.

176
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,430
The second rank...

177
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,600
July 22nd, 1876.

178
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:39,022
For six months' work, I am to receive
three years of captain's pay...

179
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,816
...teaching Orientals to soldier.

180
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,029
They are an army of conscripts.

181
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:49,199
Most of them are peasants
who have never even seen a gun.

182
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,992
Fire!

183
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,663
They are led by General Hasegawa,
a man of small stature...

184
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,625
...who nonetheless commands
enormous respect.

185
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:02,796
What can the general tell me about
this man, this Samurai, Katsumoto?

186
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:11,388
He seems to have great knowledge
of Katsumoto and his rebellion.

187
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,099
I will count on his help
when facing the Samurai.

188
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,101
Who supplies their weapons?

189
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:27,737
Katsumoto no longer dishonors himself
by using firearms, you see.

190
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,906
He uses no firearms?

191
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,992
To those who honor the old ways,
Katsumoto is a hero.

192
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,911
How well does he know him?

193
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,331
The general and Katsumoto
fought together for the Emperor.

194
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,916
He fought with the Samurai?

195
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:43,837
He is Samurai.

196
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,596
You must understand.
Katsumoto pledged his sword...

197
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,056
...to defend the Emperor.

198
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,851
They say that a Samurai's sword
is his soul.

199
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,728
They are paradoxical people, Samurai.

200
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,856
I've tried to write about them,
but they keep to themselves.

201
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,567
The bastards are still wearing armor.

202
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,903
Yes, when the Irish were comporting
themselves in loin cloths...

203
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,282
...these chaps were the most
sophisticated warriors on Earth.

204
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,576
I need more detailed information
on their battle tactics.

205
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,912
I have several more books
just waiting to be translated.

206
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,248
He'll be speaking the lingo in no time.

207
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,500
You should hear him blather on in Blackfoot.

208
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,169
Really?

209
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:27,130
A fellow linguist? Oh, capital!

210
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,550
Come on, sir.
A word or two in the savage tongue.

211
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,262
Just "hello" or "goodbye" or...
No, no, no!

212
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,890
"Cut his tongue out and boil him in oil."

213
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,436
Early day tomorrow, captain.

214
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:45,440
It's about bedtime, isn't it?
I always had a fascination with scalping.

215
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,443
I never quite understood
its technique.

216
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:57,994
Imagine someone who hates you
with the utmost intensity...

217
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:03,166
...grabbing a handful of your hair while
you're lying prostrate and helpless...

218
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:12,550
...and scraping a dull blade
of a rusty knife around your scalp...

219
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,011
...with a saw-like motion.

220
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:20,809
And let your imagination grasp, if you
can, the effect of a strong, quick jerk...

221
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,480
...on the turf of your hair
to release any clinging particles...

222
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,400
...would have on your nervous system.

223
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:36,324
And you'll have some idea
of how it feels to be scalped...

224
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,952
...Mr. Graham.

225
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,626
How soon can you
translate those books?

226
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,839
Right away.

227
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,428
I'm just delighted you're taking
such an interest in Samurai.

228
00:18:56,594 --> 00:19:00,015
I don't give a damn about the Samurai.
I want to know my enemy.

229
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,601
I shall not sleep until it is done.

230
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,230
Sake.

231
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,358
I bid you good night.

232
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,694
Can I get you anything?

233
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,904
This is a punitive expedition, captain.

234
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,241
Colonel Bagley, these people had
nothing to do with the raids!

235
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,036
Good night, sir.
Quietly now, boys.

236
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,999
Fire!

237
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,845
We should be grateful they're all firing
in the same direction.

238
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,264
Couldn't have put it better myself, sir.

239
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,021
Rifle butt, against the shoulder.

240
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:34,234
Eye, down the sight.

241
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,111
Now, slowly...

242
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,617
Well done.

243
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,495
Nathan!

244
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,627
Katsumoto's attacked a railroad
at the border of his province.

245
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,964
We cannot govern a country
in which we cannot travel freely.

246
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,424
He must be stopped now.

247
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,219
My railroad is a priority
for this country.

248
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:02,679
They're not ready.

249
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:06,641
The rebels don't have single rifle.
They're savages with bows and arrows.

250
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,478
Whose sole occupation for the last
thousand years has been war.

251
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:14,399
You have superior firepower
and a larger force.

252
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,111
I am ordering the regiment
to move against the rebel Katsumoto.

253
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,614
You will track him down
and engage him.

254
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,202
Load.

255
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,998
Mr. Graham!
Tell this man to fire at me!

256
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:33,668
I beg your pardon?
Tell this man...

257
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:37,380
...if he does not shoot me,
I will kill him!

258
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,676
Captain, if I might have a word.
Tell him!

259
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,846
Tell him!

260
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,520
Load!

261
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,193
Load!

262
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,489
Faster!

263
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,075
Faster!

264
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:12,040
Shoot me, damn it.

265
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,213
Fire!

266
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,466
Fire!

267
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,327
They're not ready.

268
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,749
The regiment leaves at 6 a.m!

269
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:29,743
A thousand miles of rail track laid
in less than two years.

270
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,578
It's astonishing.

271
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,830
And Omura owns all of it?

272
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:37,000
As soon as he can get rid
of the Samurai, he will, yes.

273
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,711
How do you intend
to find Katsumoto?

274
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:44,424
Don't worry, Mr. Graham.
I assure you, he'II find us.

275
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,728
Move into position!

276
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:58,188
Yoshino Province, 1876.

277
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,690
1st Company,
form a battle line on me!

278
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,859
Pay attention,
it will save your life!

279
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,695
2nd Company,
form on 1st Company.

280
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,198
3rd and 4th Company,
form up behind.

281
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:09,908
Fill in on command!

282
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:13,912
Where's Hasegawa?
He refuses to fight against Katsumoto.

283
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,875
Cover down!
Captain Algren.

284
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,503
We are not here as combatants.

285
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:24,339
Then who's gonna lead these men?
Their own officers for Christ sake!

286
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:27,300
Let's move to the rear.
We'll be there presently.

287
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,010
Fix bayonets!

288
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:37,644
Mr. Graham, accompany me to the rear.
Yes, of course.

289
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:47,362
Sergeant Gant, report to the rear and see
to the disposition of the supply trains.

290
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,407
Did you hear my order?
I did indeed, sir!

291
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,909
Then you will obey it. Now!

292
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:56,454
No disrespect intended, sir,
but shove it up your ass.

293
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,421
Load!
Load!

294
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,491
Samurai come.

295
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:36,911
You'II be fine, son.

296
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:57,349
Assume firing positions!
Assume firing positions!

297
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,365
Fire on my order only!

298
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,513
Hold your fire!

299
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,224
Hold your fire!

300
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,273
Reload!

301
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:53,321
Hold the line!

302
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,825
Fire at will!

303
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:14,384
Lieutenant, fall back!

304
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:59,179
Zeb!

305
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:41,364
He's mine.

306
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,934
Stop!

307
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:19,194
Take him away!

308
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:27,697
What is your name?

309
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,535
Insolent swine! Answer!

310
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:46,341
Leave him be.

311
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:57,435
This is my son's village.

312
00:32:57,602 --> 00:33:01,314
We are deep in the mountains and
winter is coming. You cannot escape.

313
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,236
Jolly good.

314
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:12,362
My Lord, why do you spare the barbarian?

315
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:15,115
He is shamed in defeat.

316
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:17,701
He should kill himself.

317
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:20,161
That is not their custom.

318
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:25,834
Then...

319
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,378
...I will kill him.

320
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:30,130
Father...

321
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,090
I don't think...

322
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:35,677
Ujio...

323
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:38,805
...there will be plenty of killing to come.

324
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:40,849
For now...

325
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:43,476
...we will learn about our new enemy.

326
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:46,104
Keep him alive.

327
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,281
He's in bad shape.

328
00:35:57,741 --> 00:35:59,034
Sake.

329
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:02,245
Sake?

330
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,706
Sake.

331
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:13,381
Sake.

332
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:15,425
Taka will take care of you.

333
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,177
Sake.

334
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:18,738
Sake.

335
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:22,534
Sake!

336
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:25,328
Let him drink, Aunt.

337
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:27,288
No. That will not do.

338
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:28,707
This is my village.

339
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:31,001
This is my house.

340
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:37,215
Please.

341
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:39,134
Sake.

342
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:51,229
Sake!

343
00:37:57,694 --> 00:38:00,530
No!

344
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,783
No!

345
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:10,665
I told you!

346
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:19,966
No!

347
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:05,095
Morning.

348
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:57,957
Over there!

349
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:00,960
Go. You, go.

350
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,089
What's your name?

351
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:06,549
You got a name, don't you?

352
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:12,931
You don't know what I'm saying, do you?

353
00:41:14,307 --> 00:41:15,809
I know why you don't talk.

354
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:18,812
You're angry.

355
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:22,023
You're angry because
they make you wear a dress.

356
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:24,859
Son of a bitch.

357
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:07,819
This temple was built by my family
a thousand years ago.

358
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:12,782
My name is Katsumoto.

359
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:15,827
What is your name?

360
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:24,627
Are my words not correct?

361
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:32,052
I will practice my English with you...

362
00:42:33,511 --> 00:42:35,388
...if you would honor me.

363
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:39,351
You kept me alive just to speak English?

364
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:43,355
Then what do you want?

365
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:45,940
To know my enemy.

366
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:50,195
I've seen what you do to your enemies.

367
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:52,530
Warriors in your country do not kill?

368
00:42:52,697 --> 00:42:55,950
They don't cut the heads off defeated,
kneeling men.

369
00:42:56,993 --> 00:43:00,705
General Hasegawa asked me
to help him end his life.

370
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:05,585
A Samurai cannot stand
the shame of defeat.

371
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:08,546
I was honored to cut off his head.

372
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:16,429
Many of our customs seem strange to you.
The same is true of yours.

373
00:43:16,596 --> 00:43:18,139
For example...

374
00:43:18,306 --> 00:43:23,269
...not to introduce yourself is considered
extremely rude, even among enemies.

375
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:31,861
Nathan Algren.

376
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:36,783
I am honored to meet you.

377
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:41,329
I enjoyed this conversation in English.
I have questions.

378
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:45,166
I have introduced myself.
You have introduced yourself.

379
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:47,460
This is a very good conversation.

380
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:50,046
I have questions.
Questions come later.

381
00:43:50,213 --> 00:43:52,590
Who was the warrior in the red armor?

382
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:57,262
My brother-in-law, Hirotaro.
And the woman who cares for me?

383
00:43:57,554 --> 00:44:00,265
My sister, Hirotaro's wife.

384
00:44:00,432 --> 00:44:02,017
Her name is Taka.

385
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:03,601
I killed her husband?

386
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,731
It was a good death.

387
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:21,995
You!

388
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:26,458
You! Come... Please...

389
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:57,072
Thank you.

390
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:09,501
He smells like the pigs.
Tell my brother I cannot stand this.

391
00:45:09,709 --> 00:45:11,002
Why don't you tell him?

392
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:13,213
At least make him take a bath.

393
00:46:19,696 --> 00:46:21,489
Nicely done.

394
00:46:24,325 --> 00:46:26,786
They may be children, but they are strong.

395
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:28,246
You try.

396
00:46:29,247 --> 00:46:30,665
Try.

397
00:47:11,122 --> 00:47:12,415
Put down the sword.

398
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:44,150
I just realized, I've been remiss.
Forgive me.

399
00:49:44,526 --> 00:49:47,946
I have yet to thank you
for looking out for me yesterday.

400
00:49:48,279 --> 00:49:50,490
That is your job, correct?

401
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:52,617
Protecting me?

402
00:49:53,743 --> 00:49:55,620
Well done, Bob.

403
00:49:56,121 --> 00:49:58,456
You don't mind if I call you "Bob,"
do you?

404
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:03,086
I knew a Bob once.
God, he was ugly as a mule.

405
00:50:04,045 --> 00:50:06,006
You a ladies' man, Bob?

406
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:13,805
Ujio is teaching you the way
of the Japanese sword.

407
00:50:15,473 --> 00:50:17,225
Yes, indeed.

408
00:50:19,102 --> 00:50:22,814
You fought against your Red Indians?

409
00:50:27,485 --> 00:50:28,778
Yes.

410
00:50:28,945 --> 00:50:30,697
Tell me of your part in this war.

411
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:32,449
Why?
I wish to learn.

412
00:50:32,615 --> 00:50:35,952
Read a book.
I would rather have a good conversation.

413
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:38,163
Why?
Because...

414
00:50:38,329 --> 00:50:40,206
...we are both students of war.

415
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:49,090
So...

416
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:52,886
...you were the general of your army?

417
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:56,765
No.

418
00:50:57,974 --> 00:51:00,393
I was a captain.

419
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,854
This is a low rank?

420
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,025
A middle rank.

421
00:51:08,276 --> 00:51:09,611
And who was your general?

422
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:17,160
Don't you have a rebellion to lead?

423
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:20,663
People in your country
do not like conversation?

424
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:23,249
He was a lieutenant colonel.

425
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:25,627
His name was Custer.

426
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:27,087
I know this name.

427
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:29,547
He killed many warriors.

428
00:51:29,714 --> 00:51:31,383
Oh, yes. Many warriors.

429
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:33,718
So he was a good general.

430
00:51:33,885 --> 00:51:37,430
No. No, he wasn't a good general.
He was arrogant and foolhardy.

431
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:41,976
He got massacred because he took
a single battalion against 2 000 angry Indians.

432
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:44,896
Two thousand Indians?

433
00:51:45,313 --> 00:51:46,606
How many men for Custer?

434
00:51:47,023 --> 00:51:48,441
Two hundred and eleven.

435
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:51,861
I like this General Custer.

436
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:56,449
He was a murderer who fell in love
with his own legend.

437
00:51:56,616 --> 00:51:58,743
And his troopers died for it.

438
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,995
I think this is a very good death.

439
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:03,164
Maybe you can have one
just like it someday.

440
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:05,500
If it is in my destiny.

441
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:09,462
What do you want from me?
What do you want for yourself?

442
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:13,508
What are you doing?

443
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:15,802
Why are we having these conversations?

444
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,930
What the hell am I doing here?

445
00:52:24,102 --> 00:52:25,687
In spring...

446
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:29,274
...the snows will melt
and the passes will open.

447
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:33,778
Until that time, you are here.

448
00:52:35,613 --> 00:52:38,366
Good day, captain.

449
00:52:59,387 --> 00:53:01,222
1876.

450
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:04,601
Day unknown. Month unknown.

451
00:53:05,643 --> 00:53:09,314
I continue to live among
these unusual people.

452
00:53:10,565 --> 00:53:13,777
I am their captive,
in that I cannot escape.

453
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:18,448
Mostly, I'm treated with
a kind of a mild neglect...

454
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:23,953
...as if I were a stray dog
or an unwelcome guest.

455
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:38,760
Everyone is polite.
Everyone smiles and bows.

456
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:45,141
But beneath their courtesy,
I detect a deep reservoir of feeling.

457
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:27,434
They are an intriguing people.

458
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:29,561
From the moment they wake...

459
00:54:29,728 --> 00:54:33,732
...they devote themselves to
the perfection of whatever they pursue.

460
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:45,243
I have never seen such discipline.

461
00:54:46,327 --> 00:54:50,457
I am surprised to learn that the word
"Samurai" means "to serve"...

462
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:53,126
...and that Katsumoto believes
his rebellion to be...

463
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:55,211
...in the service of the Emperor.

464
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:59,753
Please forgive. Too many mind.

465
00:57:01,171 --> 00:57:02,964
Too many mind?

466
00:57:03,506 --> 00:57:07,802
Mind sword, mind people watch,
mind enemy.

467
00:57:08,636 --> 00:57:10,430
Too many mind.

468
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:13,600
No mind.

469
00:57:15,685 --> 00:57:16,895
No mind.

470
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:49,511
Thank you. More rice?

471
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:54,516
Taka. He spoke Japanese!

472
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:58,520
Eat a lot. Don't be polite.

473
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:01,356
Not so fast. What are these?

474
00:58:05,985 --> 00:58:08,029
How can he understand?

475
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:13,076
Top knot.

476
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:18,707
No, no. Not so fast.

477
00:58:22,877 --> 00:58:24,170
I'm Algren.

478
00:58:31,928 --> 00:58:34,764
Nobutada.
Nobutada.

479
00:58:35,473 --> 00:58:37,392
Magojiro.
Magojiro.

480
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:38,852
Higen.

481
00:58:39,477 --> 00:58:40,854
Higen.

482
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:45,775
Taka.

483
00:58:48,903 --> 00:58:52,407
Brother, please make him leave. I cannot stand it.

484
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:54,617
Is he so repulsive?

485
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:58,038
The shame is unbearable. I ask permission to end my life.

486
00:58:58,246 --> 00:59:00,540
You will do as you are told!

487
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:09,549
You'd rather I kill him to avenge your husband?

488
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:10,592
Yes.

489
00:59:14,846 --> 00:59:18,183
Hirotaro tried to kill the American.
It was karma.

490
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:19,684
I know.

491
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:25,607
Forgive my weakness.

492
00:59:26,232 --> 00:59:30,195
There must be some reason why he is here.

493
00:59:32,822 --> 00:59:35,909
It is beyond my understanding.

494
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:56,971
She's been very kind to me.

495
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:01,935
She's honored to have
my guest in her house.

496
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:29,087
Winter, 1877.

497
01:00:29,337 --> 01:00:31,965
What does it mean to be Samurai?

498
01:00:32,132 --> 01:00:35,552
To devote yourself utterly
to a set of moral principles...

499
01:00:36,302 --> 01:00:39,180
...to seek a stillness of your mind...

500
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:43,059
...and to master the way of the sword.

501
01:00:43,226 --> 01:00:44,853
He's getting better, no?

502
01:00:46,563 --> 01:00:48,857
But still so ugly.

503
01:00:57,574 --> 01:00:58,950
Cold?

504
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:12,130
Also. Also cold.

505
01:01:13,173 --> 01:01:14,507
Fire.

506
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:24,684
To burn.

507
01:01:43,078 --> 01:01:44,662
No, please.

508
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:48,875
Japanese men do not help with this.

509
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:52,837
I am not Japanese.

510
01:02:23,576 --> 01:02:24,869
I'm sorry.

511
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:37,340
For your husband, Hirotaro.

512
01:02:50,186 --> 01:02:54,691
He did his duty.

513
01:02:58,653 --> 01:03:02,574
You did your duty.

514
01:03:07,662 --> 01:03:11,750
I accept your apology...

515
01:03:29,642 --> 01:03:32,479
Spring, 1877.

516
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:37,859
This marks the longest I have stayed
in one place since I left the farm at 17.

517
01:03:41,363 --> 01:03:44,699
There is so much here
that I'll never understand.

518
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:51,873
I have never been a church-going man...

519
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,334
...and what I've seen
on the field of battle...

520
01:03:54,501 --> 01:03:56,461
...has led me to question God's purpose.

521
01:03:56,628 --> 01:03:59,005
But there is, indeed, something...

522
01:03:59,172 --> 01:04:02,092
...spiritual in this place.

523
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:08,973
And though it may forever
be obscure to me...

524
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:12,602
...I cannot but be aware of its power.

525
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:26,032
I do know it is here that I have known
my first untroubled sleep in many years.

526
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:32,330
No, you gotta get the ball!
Go and get it.

527
01:04:32,497 --> 01:04:36,626
No, not me!
You gotta get the ball! The ball!

528
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:47,345
Ujio will win in three moves.

529
01:04:50,098 --> 01:04:51,599
In five!

530
01:05:06,072 --> 01:05:07,532
Next in five moves.

531
01:05:09,576 --> 01:05:10,869
In six.

532
01:05:29,971 --> 01:05:31,639
No mind.

533
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:38,998
A draw!

534
01:07:22,625 --> 01:07:24,210
Who is this amateur?

535
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:28,608
Katsumoto!

536
01:08:32,028 --> 01:08:33,863
Protect Katsumoto! Protect our Lord!

537
01:09:13,695 --> 01:09:15,113
Lord, please go inside!

538
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:58,985
The perfect blossom is a rare thing.

539
01:11:59,152 --> 01:12:04,199
You could spend your life looking for
one, and it would not be a wasted life.

540
01:12:04,991 --> 01:12:06,993
Who sent those men to kill you?

541
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,246
I'm writing a poem about a dream I had.

542
01:12:10,747 --> 01:12:13,625
The tiger's eyes are like my own.

543
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:17,003
But he comes from across
a deep and troubled sea.

544
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:19,756
Was it the Emperor?

545
01:12:21,591 --> 01:12:22,884
Omura?

546
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:26,971
If the Emperor wishes my death,
he has but to ask.

547
01:12:27,889 --> 01:12:29,724
So it was Omura.

548
01:12:30,308 --> 01:12:32,477
I'm having trouble finishing the poem.

549
01:12:32,644 --> 01:12:36,314
Can you suggest a last line?
I'm not a writer.

550
01:12:36,564 --> 01:12:41,569
Yet you have written many pages
since you came here.

551
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:46,199
What else has she told you?

552
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:50,120
You have nightmares.

553
01:12:52,956 --> 01:12:54,499
Every soldier has nightmares.

554
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:58,128
Only one who is ashamed
of what he has done.

555
01:12:58,878 --> 01:13:02,090
You have no idea what I have done.

556
01:13:09,347 --> 01:13:12,517
You have seen many things.

557
01:13:13,309 --> 01:13:14,602
I have.

558
01:13:14,769 --> 01:13:18,982
And you do not fear death,
but sometimes you wish for it.

559
01:13:19,524 --> 01:13:21,568
Is this not so?

560
01:13:24,112 --> 01:13:26,698
Yes.
I, also.

561
01:13:27,615 --> 01:13:31,661
It happens to men who have seen
what we have seen.

562
01:13:32,203 --> 01:13:37,667
And then I come to this place
of my ancestors...

563
01:13:37,959 --> 01:13:39,961
...and I remember.

564
01:13:40,128 --> 01:13:42,464
Like these blossoms...

565
01:13:43,173 --> 01:13:45,216
...we are all dying.

566
01:13:47,093 --> 01:13:50,555
To know life in every breath...

567
01:13:51,306 --> 01:13:53,516
...every cup of tea...

568
01:13:53,683 --> 01:13:56,728
...every life we take.

569
01:13:56,895 --> 01:13:59,272
The way of the warrior.

570
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:01,649
Life in every breath.

571
01:14:02,734 --> 01:14:04,986
That is Bushido.

572
01:14:09,282 --> 01:14:12,911
The Emperor has granted
a safe passage to Tokyo.

573
01:14:13,578 --> 01:14:15,622
We leave tomorrow.

574
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,918
Good.

575
01:14:21,002 --> 01:14:22,337
Good.

576
01:14:28,927 --> 01:14:31,888
When I took these, you were...

577
01:14:32,764 --> 01:14:34,349
...my enemy.

578
01:14:54,494 --> 01:14:56,538
Excuse me.

579
01:14:58,123 --> 01:15:01,334
No, so sorry, I am finishing.

580
01:15:19,227 --> 01:15:21,104
I must go away.

581
01:15:43,084 --> 01:15:46,129
You have been kind to me.

582
01:15:49,382 --> 01:15:51,009
I won't forget...

583
01:16:17,827 --> 01:16:21,498
Algren-san! Algren-san.

584
01:19:15,755 --> 01:19:17,424
Algren?

585
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:20,510
Algren, my God, you are alive.

586
01:19:24,597 --> 01:19:27,058
Well, you never cease to astonish.

587
01:19:27,767 --> 01:19:31,521
Howitzers.
Yes, indeed.

588
01:19:31,688 --> 01:19:34,482
As soon as the Emperor signs
the damn trade agreement...

589
01:19:34,649 --> 01:19:36,735
...he gets the whole package.

590
01:19:36,901 --> 01:19:40,447
Including this particular item.
Two hundred rounds a minute.

591
01:19:40,864 --> 01:19:44,075
And the new cartridges
cut down on jamming.

592
01:19:44,242 --> 01:19:45,994
I need a bath.

593
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:49,748
After living with those savages,
I can only imagine.

594
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:53,501
Welcome back, captain.

595
01:20:03,386 --> 01:20:05,513
You rise against me, my teacher.

596
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:08,725
No, Highness. I rise against your enemies.

597
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:13,021
They are my advisors, like you.

598
01:20:13,229 --> 01:20:16,107
They advise in their own interest.

599
01:20:16,983 --> 01:20:21,780
I need advisors who know the modern world.

600
01:20:22,447 --> 01:20:26,534
If I am no use, I will happily end my life.

601
01:20:28,703 --> 01:20:30,205
No...

602
01:20:30,789 --> 01:20:33,625
I need your voice in the council.

603
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:36,127
It is your voice we need, Highness.

604
01:20:36,961 --> 01:20:40,256
You are a living god. Do what you think is right.

605
01:20:40,507 --> 01:20:43,134
I am a living god...

606
01:20:44,636 --> 01:20:48,223
...as long as I do what they think is right.

607
01:20:49,432 --> 01:20:51,476
What sad words you speak.

608
01:20:51,976 --> 01:20:55,063
Forgive me for saying what a teacher must.

609
01:20:56,731 --> 01:20:58,650
Have you forgotten your people?

610
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:02,821
Tell me what to do...

611
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,533
...my teacher.

612
01:21:11,454 --> 01:21:14,124
You are Emperor, my Lord, not me.

613
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:19,462
You must find the wisdom for all of us.

614
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:27,095
Gentlemen, come in.

615
01:21:27,595 --> 01:21:30,807
Captain Algren, it seems
you have endured your captivity...

616
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:32,267
...with little ill effect.

617
01:21:33,226 --> 01:21:34,769
I was not ill-treated, sir.

618
01:21:34,936 --> 01:21:38,481
Mr. Omura, I have here
a draft of the arms agreement.

619
01:21:38,523 --> 01:21:42,527
Captain Algren, I'm eager to know
how many Samurai have joined Katsumoto.

620
01:21:42,694 --> 01:21:44,112
I'm afraid I don't know.

621
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:47,657
You spent the winter at his encampment.
As his prisoner.

622
01:21:47,824 --> 01:21:52,078
Has he fortified his position?
Has he acquired firearms? Tell us what you saw.

623
01:21:52,245 --> 01:21:57,584
As you said, colonel,
they're savages with bows and arrows.

624
01:21:57,751 --> 01:22:01,713
Sir, about the...
I'm sure your documents are in order, ambassador.

625
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:06,301
Thank you. If you leave them on my desk.
I'll address them at the appropriate time.

626
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:10,847
With all due respect, sir,
our president's patience is wearing thin.

627
01:22:11,014 --> 01:22:13,558
Perhaps there is someone else
we should speaking to.

628
01:22:13,725 --> 01:22:16,102
With all due respect, ambassador...

629
01:22:16,269 --> 01:22:18,980
...perhaps there is someone else
we should speaking to.

630
01:22:19,147 --> 01:22:21,941
For instance, the French
or the English.

631
01:22:22,108 --> 01:22:25,236
Or any of the delegations
waiting in the next room.

632
01:22:26,946 --> 01:22:30,241
We should be looking forward
to hearing from you.

633
01:22:30,992 --> 01:22:34,621
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Captain Algren.

634
01:22:35,121 --> 01:22:39,918
Perhaps you and I might have
a word in private. Please, sit down.

635
01:22:42,962 --> 01:22:46,299
May I offer you whiskey?
No, thank you.

636
01:22:52,597 --> 01:22:55,767
Katsumoto is an extraordinary man,
is he not?

637
01:22:55,934 --> 01:22:59,646
He's a tribal leader.
I've known many of them.

638
01:22:59,813 --> 01:23:04,776
But none who are Samurai.
Their ways have great appeal.

639
01:23:04,943 --> 01:23:08,822
I don't see how this concerns me.
Ah, but it does.

640
01:23:08,988 --> 01:23:14,244
You see, you were right. Last year,
we were not prepared to go to battle.

641
01:23:14,411 --> 01:23:17,038
You were right,
and Colonel Bagley was wrong.

642
01:23:17,205 --> 01:23:19,165
But now, we are ready.

643
01:23:19,332 --> 01:23:22,752
If Katsumoto is allowed to attract
other Samurai to his cause...

644
01:23:22,919 --> 01:23:27,757
...we will have 10 years of rebellion.
This is something I will not allow.

645
01:23:27,924 --> 01:23:33,513
Either I'II stop him at the council today,
or you'll lead my army against him.

646
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:37,809
And with these new weapons,
you will crush him.

647
01:23:39,602 --> 01:23:43,148
I appreciate the offer.
It is not an offer.

648
01:23:43,898 --> 01:23:47,986
Mr. Omura, my contract with you
was to train your army.

649
01:23:48,153 --> 01:23:50,655
Then we will make a new contract...

650
01:23:50,822 --> 01:23:54,242
...one that will recognize
the extraordinary contribution...

651
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:56,036
...you've made to the Emperor.

652
01:23:56,536 --> 01:23:58,830
Do we understand each other?

653
01:24:01,374 --> 01:24:05,337
Yes, we understand each other perfectly.
Then I am pleased.

654
01:24:12,969 --> 01:24:17,724
Follow him.
If he goes anywhere near Katsumoto, kill him.

655
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,316
Captain Algren!
What in heaven's name is going on?

656
01:24:26,483 --> 01:24:28,485
The diplomatic community is abuzz.

657
01:24:28,651 --> 01:24:31,404
Omura has passed laws
against the Samurai.

658
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:32,864
I need a drink.

659
01:24:33,031 --> 01:24:37,410
Is your friend Katsumoto really planning to go
up against the council this afternoon?

660
01:24:37,577 --> 01:24:43,875
You, Samurai!
Don't you know about the order?

661
01:24:44,459 --> 01:24:45,710
My God, it's started.

662
01:24:46,086 --> 01:24:48,380
Hey boy, are you listening?

663
01:24:49,673 --> 01:24:51,591
No wonder the foreigners mock you.

664
01:24:51,758 --> 01:24:53,134
Let's give this Samurai a haircut.

665
01:24:53,426 --> 01:24:54,803
Cut off his top knot.

666
01:24:55,178 --> 01:24:56,471
Get down! Kneel!

667
01:24:56,638 --> 01:24:57,681
Captain Algren!

668
01:24:57,847 --> 01:24:58,890
Lower your weapons!

669
01:24:59,808 --> 01:25:01,434
Lower your weapons!

670
01:25:02,811 --> 01:25:03,978
Who are you?

671
01:25:04,145 --> 01:25:05,480
I am Captain Algren.

672
01:25:07,357 --> 01:25:08,858
Stop!

673
01:25:33,008 --> 01:25:34,426
Get down!

674
01:25:49,607 --> 01:25:51,401
Let's go.

675
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:09,961
I'll take you home.

676
01:26:11,046 --> 01:26:12,714
Jolly good.

677
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:41,785
We must resist the Western powers...

678
01:26:41,951 --> 01:26:43,745
...by becoming powerful ourselves.

679
01:26:44,537 --> 01:26:48,375
Our army, our economy, must be strong.

680
01:26:51,878 --> 01:26:55,215
Minister, you honor us.

681
01:26:57,717 --> 01:27:00,261
It is my honor to rejoin this council.

682
01:27:04,557 --> 01:27:07,811
Perhaps you are unaware of the law
against wearing swords?

683
01:27:08,061 --> 01:27:10,146
I read every law carefully.

684
01:27:10,271 --> 01:27:13,733
Yet you bring weapons into this chamber?

685
01:27:17,153 --> 01:27:20,657
This chamber was protected
by my sword when...

686
01:27:20,865 --> 01:27:24,285
We need no protection. We are a nation of laws.

687
01:27:24,452 --> 01:27:27,163
We are a nation of whores, selling ourselves...

688
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:31,543
If we are whores, the Samurai made us this way.

689
01:27:32,419 --> 01:27:36,548
I have not seen the Omura family giving gold to the masses.

690
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:43,138
Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regret...

691
01:27:44,222 --> 01:27:46,683
...but I must ask you to remove your sword.

692
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:53,231
This sword serves the Emperor.

693
01:27:53,732 --> 01:27:56,067
Only he can command me to remove it.

694
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:22,635
The Emperor's voice is too pure
to be heard in this council.

695
01:28:24,596 --> 01:28:28,183
Then, I must refuse to give up my sword.

696
01:28:33,772 --> 01:28:37,233
Then regretfully, my guards will
accompany you to your home in Tokyo.

697
01:28:37,484 --> 01:28:40,111
There you will await our summons.

698
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:06,262
I heard you were leaving.

699
01:29:08,056 --> 01:29:11,101
Omura offers you my job,
and you run away.

700
01:29:12,185 --> 01:29:14,396
I suppose I should thank you.

701
01:29:14,938 --> 01:29:19,484
$500 a month, including
back pay for time spent...

702
01:29:19,901 --> 01:29:21,736
...in captivity.

703
01:29:23,321 --> 01:29:26,658
Enough to climb back inside a bottle
for the rest of your life.

704
01:29:30,078 --> 01:29:31,538
You're welcome.

705
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:39,254
Well, it is pretty much over.

706
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:43,800
Katsumoto's under arrest.
Omura won't let him last the night.

707
01:29:44,009 --> 01:29:48,346
With Katsumoto dead, we should have
little trouble handling what's left of the rebellion...

708
01:29:48,513 --> 01:29:50,265
...even without you.

709
01:29:54,602 --> 01:29:56,896
Especially without you.

710
01:30:01,901 --> 01:30:04,112
Just tell me one thing.

711
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:09,034
What is it about your own people
that you hate so much?

712
01:31:01,878 --> 01:31:04,089
Save us the trouble...

713
01:33:53,842 --> 01:33:56,344
The Samurai are finished!

714
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:23,121
Stop!

715
01:34:23,329 --> 01:34:24,581
Don't come any closer!

716
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:27,417
Don't stop.
Whatever you do, don't stop.

717
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:32,339
Minister Omura has commanded us
to photograph the traitor...

718
01:34:32,881 --> 01:34:34,382
Stop! Somebody!

719
01:34:34,799 --> 01:34:36,259
Bring that equipment here now!

720
01:34:36,426 --> 01:34:37,802
Immediately!

721
01:34:37,969 --> 01:34:39,721
You stop!

722
01:34:40,055 --> 01:34:44,059
You insolent, useless son of a peasant dog!

723
01:34:46,311 --> 01:34:50,523
How dare you show your sword in his presence!
Do you know who this is?

724
01:34:50,982 --> 01:34:54,277
This is the President of the United States of America!

725
01:34:54,402 --> 01:34:58,490
He is here to lead our armies
in victorious battle against the rebels.

726
01:34:58,656 --> 01:35:00,492
It's not my responsibility...

727
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:04,371
Now get over there and
help those men with their equipment!

728
01:35:07,707 --> 01:35:09,209
Carry the equipment.

729
01:35:12,962 --> 01:35:16,091
President of the United States?
Sorry.

730
01:35:16,257 --> 01:35:18,051
I think I'm going to be sick.

731
01:35:36,277 --> 01:35:38,321
How's your poem coming?

732
01:35:40,949 --> 01:35:43,827
The end is proving difficult.

733
01:35:43,993 --> 01:35:47,914
This is Mr. Simon Graham. He'd like
very much to take your photograph.

734
01:35:49,457 --> 01:35:51,584
I thought you returned to America.

735
01:35:51,793 --> 01:35:56,464
I decided to stay.
See if I could convince you to escape.

736
01:35:56,715 --> 01:35:58,842
How do you plan to do that?

737
01:36:07,642 --> 01:36:11,646
Mr. Graham, perhaps you would care
to take pictures of my village.

738
01:36:11,813 --> 01:36:14,024
I would be greatly honored.

739
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:36,523
My Lord, no!

740
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:38,775
Nobutada!

741
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,282
Father, let me stay.

742
01:38:30,952 --> 01:38:32,454
It is my time.

743
01:38:46,217 --> 01:38:47,385
My Lord...

744
01:38:48,178 --> 01:38:50,013
...we must go.

745
01:40:12,554 --> 01:40:15,432
The Emperor could not hear my words.

746
01:40:17,767 --> 01:40:20,228
His army will come.

747
01:40:21,563 --> 01:40:23,481
It is the end.

748
01:40:25,942 --> 01:40:30,488
For 900 years, my ancestors
have protected our people.

749
01:40:32,157 --> 01:40:34,367
Now...

750
01:40:34,576 --> 01:40:36,286
...I have failed them.

751
01:40:47,839 --> 01:40:51,259
So you will take your own life...

752
01:40:52,802 --> 01:40:54,054
...in shame?

753
01:40:59,267 --> 01:41:02,937
Shame for a life of service?

754
01:41:03,938 --> 01:41:06,733
Discipline? Compassion?

755
01:41:07,525 --> 01:41:10,987
The way of the Samurai
is not necessary anymore.

756
01:41:11,154 --> 01:41:13,615
Necessary?

757
01:41:15,992 --> 01:41:18,286
What could be more necessary?

758
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:25,669
I will die by the sword.

759
01:41:27,545 --> 01:41:29,839
My own...

760
01:41:30,048 --> 01:41:31,883
...or my enemy's.

761
01:41:33,051 --> 01:41:35,178
Then let it be your enemy's.

762
01:41:38,807 --> 01:41:42,560
Together, we will make
the Emperor hear you.

763
01:42:10,338 --> 01:42:14,509
He was a good man.

764
01:42:17,429 --> 01:42:19,556
Will you fight the white men, too?

765
01:42:19,764 --> 01:42:25,353
If they come here, yes.

766
01:42:27,230 --> 01:42:28,648
Why?

767
01:42:31,401 --> 01:42:38,533
Because they come to destroy what I have come to love.

768
01:42:50,086 --> 01:42:58,261
The way of Samurai is difficult
for children. He misses his father.

769
01:42:59,596 --> 01:43:08,104
And he is angry because I am the cause of that.

770
01:43:12,317 --> 01:43:18,573
No. He is angry because
he fears you will die as well.

771
01:43:39,177 --> 01:43:44,099
My father taught me
it is glorious to die in battle.

772
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:55,110
That is what he believed.

773
01:43:58,321 --> 01:44:00,365
I would be afraid to die in battle.

774
01:44:02,367 --> 01:44:03,618
So would I.

775
01:44:06,329 --> 01:44:08,623
But you have been in many battles.

776
01:44:10,417 --> 01:44:13,086
And I was always afraid.

777
01:44:21,011 --> 01:44:22,345
I don't want you to go.

778
01:44:23,847 --> 01:44:25,724
Algren.

779
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:27,142
They are coming.

780
01:44:56,504 --> 01:44:58,590
I'd say two full regiments.

781
01:44:58,757 --> 01:45:01,051
They'll come in waves of a thousand.

782
01:45:01,593 --> 01:45:03,219
And they have the howitzers.

783
01:45:03,386 --> 01:45:07,640
It makes no difference. They will come
and we will make our stand.

784
01:45:07,807 --> 01:45:10,852
How many men will we have?
Maybe 500.

785
01:45:11,436 --> 01:45:13,229
Like General Custer, huh?

786
01:45:17,567 --> 01:45:21,571
There was once a battle
at a place called Thermopylae.

787
01:45:21,738 --> 01:45:25,325
Three hundred brave Greeks held off
a Persian army of a million men.

788
01:45:25,492 --> 01:45:28,036
A million. You understand this number.

789
01:45:28,244 --> 01:45:30,246
I understand this number.

790
01:45:30,497 --> 01:45:33,041
For two days the Greeks
made them pay so dearly...

791
01:45:33,249 --> 01:45:38,588
...the Persian army lost all taste
for battle and were defeated soon after.

792
01:45:38,755 --> 01:45:42,926
What do you have in mind?
Take away the advantage of their gun.

793
01:45:43,134 --> 01:45:46,638
They're overconfident. We'll use that
Lure them close.

794
01:45:47,806 --> 01:45:49,391
Close enough for a sword.

795
01:45:51,101 --> 01:45:53,395
You believe...

796
01:45:53,561 --> 01:45:55,647
...a man can change his destiny?

797
01:45:58,608 --> 01:46:01,778
I think a man does what he can...

798
01:46:01,945 --> 01:46:04,072
...until his destiny is revealed to.

799
01:46:11,454 --> 01:46:15,125
May 25th, 1877.

800
01:46:15,291 --> 01:46:18,461
This will be the last entry
in this journal.

801
01:46:18,628 --> 01:46:23,842
I've tried to give a true account
of what I have seen, what I have d.

802
01:46:24,009 --> 01:46:27,595
I do not presume to understand
the course of my life.

803
01:46:27,929 --> 01:46:31,975
I know I am grateful
to have partaken of all this...

804
01:46:32,142 --> 01:46:34,185
...even if for a moment.

805
01:48:26,381 --> 01:48:31,219
Algren-san, will you come with me?

806
01:48:48,194 --> 01:48:51,740
If you wear this armor,
it will honor us.

807
01:51:50,043 --> 01:51:52,921
You will need this.

808
01:52:04,766 --> 01:52:06,017
What does it say?

809
01:52:07,143 --> 01:52:12,649
"I belong to the warrior in whom
the old ways have joined the new."

810
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:19,215
Good God.

811
01:53:23,303 --> 01:53:26,973
Sir, the Imperial Army of Japan
demands your surrender.

812
01:53:27,223 --> 01:53:29,768
If you lay down your arms,
you will not be harmed.

813
01:53:30,143 --> 01:53:34,689
This is not possible,
as Mr. Omura knows.

814
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:40,779
Captain Algren.

815
01:53:40,945 --> 01:53:42,864
We will show you no quarter.

816
01:53:43,031 --> 01:53:45,700
You ride against us,
and you are the same as them.

817
01:53:46,701 --> 01:53:48,745
I'll look for you on the field.

818
01:54:09,516 --> 01:54:10,975
Captain Algren.

819
01:54:11,142 --> 01:54:13,770
Mr. Graham.

820
01:54:17,065 --> 01:54:20,443
Perhaps you can use these
for your book.

821
01:54:20,610 --> 01:54:22,987
Yes, I will. Captain.

822
01:54:26,199 --> 01:54:27,951
Godspeed.

823
01:54:29,577 --> 01:54:31,955
Mr. Graham.

824
01:54:55,812 --> 01:54:58,690
Well they won't surrender.

825
01:55:04,195 --> 01:55:07,157
Are we ready?

826
01:55:09,034 --> 01:55:10,410
Get into your positions!

827
01:55:54,829 --> 01:55:57,624
Commence firing!

828
01:57:13,491 --> 01:57:16,036
They're covering their retreat.
You see?

829
01:57:16,244 --> 01:57:19,998
Even the mighty Samurai
cannot stand up to the howitzers.

830
01:57:20,165 --> 01:57:23,376
Signal the attack.
I advise sending in skirmishers first.

831
01:57:23,543 --> 01:57:25,545
Nonsense! Full attack!

832
01:58:21,267 --> 01:58:23,478
They're coming.

833
01:58:55,927 --> 01:58:57,804
Wait for the volley.

834
01:59:09,607 --> 01:59:11,443
Second volley.

835
02:00:06,206 --> 02:00:08,500
What on earth?
What is happening?

836
02:00:53,294 --> 02:00:56,631
The attack has been stopped.
Send in the rest of the regiment.

837
02:01:01,594 --> 02:01:03,888
What happened to the warriors
at Thermopylae?

838
02:01:04,264 --> 02:01:07,058
Dead to the last man.

839
02:02:10,121 --> 02:02:11,873
Algren-san!

840
02:05:00,375 --> 02:05:03,211
Son of a bitch thinks he can win.

841
02:06:07,442 --> 02:06:11,363
They'II bring two more regiments
up here soon.

842
02:06:11,529 --> 02:06:13,573
We won't be able to stop them again.

843
02:06:14,574 --> 02:06:16,659
You do not have to die here.

844
02:06:19,704 --> 02:06:22,457
I should have died
so many times before.

845
02:06:22,999 --> 02:06:24,417
Now, you live again.

846
02:06:27,671 --> 02:06:29,881
Yes.

847
02:06:32,050 --> 02:06:35,011
It was not your time.

848
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:40,684
It's not over.

849
02:07:26,980 --> 02:07:28,398
What is this?

850
02:07:28,565 --> 02:07:30,108
Cannon, prepare to fire!

851
02:07:30,483 --> 02:07:31,985
Prepare to fire!

852
02:07:32,652 --> 02:07:36,990
This is madness. He's going to attack
Yes.

853
02:07:45,290 --> 02:07:48,335
He's defeated!
He must accept his shame!

854
02:08:00,305 --> 02:08:02,682
Kill him. All of them.

855
02:08:02,891 --> 02:08:05,268
Now!

856
02:08:09,356 --> 02:08:10,690
My horse!

857
02:09:03,618 --> 02:09:04,869
Fire!

858
02:09:41,906 --> 02:09:43,241
Ready!

859
02:09:46,619 --> 02:09:47,871
Aim!

860
02:09:53,251 --> 02:09:54,586
Fire!

861
02:10:00,759 --> 02:10:02,260
Fire at will!

862
02:10:48,431 --> 02:10:50,392
Bring up the new guns!

863
02:10:51,017 --> 02:10:52,477
Prepare the new guns!

864
02:10:57,440 --> 02:10:59,275
Fire!

865
02:11:01,319 --> 02:11:02,654
Backward!

866
02:11:05,657 --> 02:11:07,784
Quickly! Quickly!

867
02:11:11,329 --> 02:11:12,914
Fire!

868
02:12:57,519 --> 02:12:58,937
Stop firing!

869
02:12:59,270 --> 02:13:01,106
Idiots, keep on firing!

870
02:13:01,272 --> 02:13:02,941
Stop firing! Stop!

871
02:13:12,617 --> 02:13:14,077
No.

872
02:13:15,453 --> 02:13:18,998
Shoot! Kill Katsumoto!
Kill the American!

873
02:13:21,167 --> 02:13:23,920
You have your honor again.

874
02:13:26,131 --> 02:13:28,341
Let me die with mine.

875
02:13:37,809 --> 02:13:39,811
Help me up.

876
02:13:59,414 --> 02:14:01,124
Are you ready?

877
02:14:08,256 --> 02:14:11,926
I will miss our conversations.

878
02:14:58,515 --> 02:15:00,809
Perfect.

879
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:10,652
They are all...

880
02:15:11,653 --> 02:15:13,780
...perfect.

881
02:16:41,868 --> 02:16:45,538
On behalf of the United States
of America...

882
02:16:46,456 --> 02:16:51,670
...the signing of this treaty will
an era of unprecedented prosperity...

883
02:16:51,878 --> 02:16:56,007
...and cooperation between
our two great nations.

884
02:16:56,341 --> 02:16:58,051
On behalf of the Emperor...

885
02:16:58,218 --> 02:17:01,971
...we are pleased to have
successfully concluded this...

886
02:17:05,392 --> 02:17:07,686
...negotiation.

887
02:17:15,318 --> 02:17:17,070
He is here?

888
02:18:21,509 --> 02:18:24,387
Highness, if we could just conclude the matter at hand...

889
02:18:51,873 --> 02:18:54,709
This is Katsumoto's sword.

890
02:18:56,044 --> 02:18:58,755
He would have wanted you to have it.

891
02:18:59,923 --> 02:19:03,009
That the strength of the Samurai
be with you always.

892
02:19:03,885 --> 02:19:08,848
Enlightened One, we all weep for Katsumoto, but...

893
02:19:09,057 --> 02:19:10,642
He hoped...

894
02:19:11,267 --> 02:19:13,478
...with his last breath...

895
02:19:13,853 --> 02:19:17,232
...that you would remember the
ancestors who held this sword...

896
02:19:19,025 --> 02:19:21,319
...and what they died for.

897
02:19:22,696 --> 02:19:24,489
Your Highness...

898
02:19:41,548 --> 02:19:43,758
You were with him...

899
02:19:44,926 --> 02:19:47,012
...at the end?

900
02:19:49,472 --> 02:19:50,306
Yes.

901
02:19:52,392 --> 02:19:55,854
Emperor, this man fought against you!

902
02:20:00,066 --> 02:20:01,693
Your Highness...

903
02:20:02,944 --> 02:20:07,532
...if you believe me to be your enemy
command me...

904
02:20:07,699 --> 02:20:09,993
...and I will gladly take my life.

905
02:20:24,132 --> 02:20:28,219
I have dreamed of a unified Japan...

906
02:20:28,386 --> 02:20:34,184
...of a country strong
and independent and modern.

907
02:20:34,351 --> 02:20:40,148
And now we have railroads
and cannon, Western clothing.

908
02:20:42,108 --> 02:20:43,735
But...

909
02:20:47,113 --> 02:20:51,159
...we cannot forget who we are...

910
02:20:52,619 --> 02:20:57,123
...or where we come from.

911
02:21:09,511 --> 02:21:12,055
Ambassador Swanbeck...

912
02:21:12,263 --> 02:21:15,100
...I have concluded that your treaty...

913
02:21:15,266 --> 02:21:20,105
...is not in the best interest
of my people.

914
02:21:20,855 --> 02:21:24,442
Sir, if I may...
So sorry...

915
02:21:24,859 --> 02:21:26,653
...but you may not.

916
02:21:26,986 --> 02:21:30,323
This is an outrage!

917
02:21:36,329 --> 02:21:37,789
Enlightened One, we should discuss this...

918
02:21:37,956 --> 02:21:39,332
Omura...

919
02:21:39,499 --> 02:21:41,626
...you have done quite enough.

920
02:21:41,918 --> 02:21:44,546
Everything I have done, I have done for my country.

921
02:21:44,713 --> 02:21:47,674
Then you will not mind when I seize your family's assets...

922
02:21:47,924 --> 02:21:50,468
...and present them as my gift to the people.

923
02:21:50,677 --> 02:21:52,971
You disgrace me.

924
02:21:53,221 --> 02:21:55,265
If your shame is too unbearable...

925
02:22:04,566 --> 02:22:06,568
...I offer you this sword.

926
02:22:36,890 --> 02:22:39,434
Tell me how he died.

927
02:22:47,192 --> 02:22:51,738
I will tell you how he lived.

928
02:23:00,997 --> 02:23:05,418
And so the days
of the Samurai had ended.

929
02:23:05,585 --> 02:23:11,132
Nations, like men, it is sometimes said,
have their own destiny.

930
02:23:12,217 --> 02:23:14,761
As for the American captain...

931
02:23:14,969 --> 02:23:17,305
...no one knows what became of him.

932
02:23:17,472 --> 02:23:20,892
Some say that he died of his wounds...

933
02:23:21,101 --> 02:23:25,021
...others, that he returned
to his own country.

934
02:23:25,230 --> 02:23:26,856
But I like to think...

935
02:23:27,023 --> 02:23:32,070
...he may have at last found
some small measure of peace...

936
02:23:32,278 --> 02:23:34,280
...that we all seek...

937
02:23:35,031 --> 02:23:38,201
...and few of us ever find.
