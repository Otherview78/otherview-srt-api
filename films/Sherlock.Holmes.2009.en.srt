1
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,475
<i>Head cooked to the left...</i>

2
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,436
<i>...partial deafness in ear.</i>

3
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,854
<i>First point of attack.</i>

4
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,650
<i>Two, throat. Paralyze vocal cords.
Stop screaming.</i>

5
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,821
<i>Three, got to be heavy drinker.
Floating rib to the liver.</i>

6
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,366
<i>Four, finally, dragging left leg.
Fist to patella.</i>

7
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,037
<i>Summary of prognosis,
conscious in 90 seconds.</i>

8
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,913
<i>Martial efficacy, quarter of an hour.</i>

9
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,666
<i>Full faculty recovery, unlikely.</i>

10
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,241
I like the hat.

11
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,909
I just picked it up.

12
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,828
Did you remember your revolver?

13
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,246
Knew I forgot something.

14
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,624
- Thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.

15
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,087
I think that's quite enough.

16
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,089
You are a doctor, after all.

17
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,805
Always nice to see you, Watson.

18
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,184
Where's the inspector?

19
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,603
He's getting his troops lined up.

20
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,105
That could be all day.

21
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,956
Sherlock Holmes.

22
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,460
And his loyal dog.

23
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,378
Tell me, doctor...

24
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,381
...as a medical man,
have you enjoyed my work?

25
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,134
Let me show you
how much I've enjoyed it.

26
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,470
Watson. Don't.

27
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,351
Observe.

28
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,105
How did you see that?

29
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,649
Because I was looking for it.

30
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,572
Lord Blackwood.

31
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,908
You seem surprised.

32
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,578
I'd say the girl deserves your attention
more than he.

33
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,540
Indeed.

34
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,422
Oh, I'd leave that alone
if I were you, boy-o.

35
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,591
Good lad.

36
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,010
Impeccable timing, Lestrade.

37
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,763
We've one for the doctor...

38
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,431
...and one for the rope.

39
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,392
- Clarkie?
- Sir?

40
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,435
This woman needs a hospital
immediately.

41
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,229
Put her in the back of the Moriah.

42
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,605
Right, lads. That's it.

43
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,736
- Right. Pick him up, lads.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,822
If you don't mind.

45
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,741
Get him out of my sight.

46
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,457
And you were supposed to
wait for my orders.

47
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,879
If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse
and chasing a rumor.

48
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,966
Besides, the girl's parents hired me,
not the Yard.

49
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,969
Why they thought you'd require
any assistance is beyond me.

50
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,805
Well, London will breathe a sigh of relief.

51
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,141
Indeed. Congratulations, Lestrade.

52
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,977
Bravo, inspector. Have a cigar.

53
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,478
Gentlemen.

54
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,855
Cheese.

55
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,678
Blackwood hangs tomorrow.
Read all about it.

56
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,686
156 over 80. Very good.

57
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,315
My nerves are the best they've been
in years, thanks to you.

58
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,900
Tell me something.

59
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,069
Your new premises...

60
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,487
...when are you moving in?

61
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,489
I should be in within the week.

62
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:31,034
Cavendish Place.
And there'll be a woman's touch too.

63
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,535
- Well, that's marvelous.
- Indeed.

64
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,247
Good God.

65
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,334
- That was gunfire.
- No.

66
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,587
No, no. Hammer and nail, wasn't it?

67
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,007
My colleague's probably
just putting up a painting.

68
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,385
I'll-- I'll go and check.

69
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,512
- Your colleague--
- Yes?

70
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,056
Won't be moving with you, will he?

71
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,350
No, he won't.

72
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,104
Mrs. Hudson.

73
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,856
I won't go in,
not while he's got a gun in his hand.

74
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,733
You don't have to. Give me the paper.

75
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,487
What'll I do when you leave, doctor?
He'll have the whole house down.

76
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,531
He just needs another case. That's all.

77
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,783
Couldn't you have a longer engagement?

78
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,370
I smell gunpowder. It's not right, you know,
not in a domestic environment.

79
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,041
Thank you, Captain Philips.
Perhaps a nice cup of tea?

80
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,837
- Same time next week.
- Come along, captain.

81
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,256
- It's quieter downstairs.
- Mrs. Hudson?

82
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,924
Bring something to cheer him up.

83
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,395
Permission to enter the armory?

84
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,604
Granted.

85
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,527
Watson, I am in the process
of inventing a device...

86
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,696
...that suppresses the sound
of a gunshot.

87
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,034
It's not working.

88
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,828
Can I see that?

89
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,130
You know, it's been three months...

90
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,591
...since your last case.

91
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,596
Yes, yes. Gently, gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me--

92
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,226
Don't you think it's time
you found another one?

93
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,646
I can't but agree.

94
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,400
My mind rebels at stagnation.
Give me problems. Give me work.

95
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,194
The sooner, the better.

96
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,112
Paper

97
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,991
Let's see, then. There's a letter here...

98
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,453
...from Mrs. Ramsey of Queen's Park.

99
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,165
- Her husband's disappeared.
- He's in Belgium with the scullery maid.

100
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,958
Is it November?

101
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,753
Yes, Holmes. All right.

102
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,714
<i>Lady Redford reports...</i>

103
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,091
Oh, her emerald bracelet
has disappeared.

104
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,554
Insurance swindle. Lord Radford
likes fast women and slow ponies.

105
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,433
Oh. I see you're the attending physician
at Blackwood's hanging.

106
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,643
Yes.

107
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,396
It was our last case together
and I wanted to see it through to the end.

108
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,738
A Mr. Lewis is seeking...

109
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,616
There's only one case
that intrigues me at present:

110
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,870
The curious case of Mrs. Hudson,
the absentee landlady.

111
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,081
I've been studying
her comings and goings.

112
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,375
They appear most sinister.

113
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,210
Tea, Mr. Holmes?

114
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,670
Is it poisoned, nanny?

115
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,172
There's enough of that in you already.

116
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,883
Don't touch.
Everything is in its proper place...

117
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,386
...as per usual, nanny.

118
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,722
He's killed the dog. Again.

119
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,267
What have you done to Gladstone now?

120
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,562
I was simply testing a new anesthetic.

121
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,397
He doesn't mind.

122
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,651
Holmes, as your doctor...

123
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:56,030
- He'll be as right as a trivet in no time.
- As your friend...

124
00:10:56,197 --> 00:11:00,243
...you've been in this room for two weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.

125
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,497
There's nothing of interest for me
out there, on earth, at all.

126
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,251
- You're free this evening?
—Absolutely.

127
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,670
- Dinner? The Royale?
- Wonderful. My favorite.

128
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,380
Mary's coming.

129
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,467
- Not available.
- You're meeting her, Holmes.

130
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,512
Have you proposed yet?

131
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,725
- No, I haven't found the right ring.
- Then it's not official.

132
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,019
It's happening, whether you like it or not.

133
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,271
8:30, the Royale. Wear a jacket.

134
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,981
You wear a jacket.

135
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,372
A man? Outside my house?

136
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,881
Straighten your tie.

137
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,644
- Holmes.
- Mm.

138
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,771
You're early.

139
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,649
Fashionably.

140
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,817
Miss Mary Morstan.

141
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,320
My goodness. What a pleasure.

142
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,115
I don't know why it's taken him so long
to introduce us properly.

143
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,659
Pleasure is mine.

144
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,917
It really is quite a thrill to meet you,
Mr. Holmes.

145
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,044
I've heard so much about you.

146
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,546
I have a pile of detective novels at home.

147
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,924
- Wilkie Collins, Poe.
- It's true.

148
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,593
It can seem a little far-fetched
though sometimes...

149
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,513
...making grand assumptions
out of tiny details.

150
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,473
That's not quite right, is it?

151
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,601
In fact, the little details
are by far the most important.

152
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,482
- Take Watson.
- I intend to.

153
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,071
See his walking stick?
A rare African snake wood...

154
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,699
...hiding a blade of high-tensile steel.

155
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,327
A few were awarded
to veterans of the Afghan war...

156
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,538
...so I can assume
he's a decorated soldier.

157
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,708
Strong, brave,
born to be a man of action.

158
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,544
And neat, like all military men.

159
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,672
Now, I check his pockets.

160
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:23,219
Ah. A stub from a boxing match.
Now I can infer that he's a bit of a gambler.

161
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,054
I'd keep an eye on that dowry.

162
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,557
- Those days are behind me.
- Right behind you.

163
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,559
He's cost us the rent more than once.

164
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,396
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
you know John very well.

165
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,065
What about a complete stranger?

166
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,985
- What can you tell about me?
- You?

167
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,737
- I don't think--
- I don't know that--

168
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,029
- Not at dinner.
- Some other time.

169
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,322
- I insist.
- You insist?

170
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,576
- You remember we discussed this.
- The lady insists.

171
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,459
- You're a governess.
- Well done.

172
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,252
Yes, well done. Shall we...?

173
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,713
- Waiter?
- Your student...

174
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,214
...is a boy of 8.

175
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,259
- Charlie's 7, actually.
- Charlie, huh?

176
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,262
Then he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.

177
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,014
Is there ink on my face?

178
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,099
There's nothing wrong with your face.

179
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,226
There are two drops on your ear, in fact.

180
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,562
India blue's nearly impossible
to wash off.

181
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,355
A very impetuous act by the boy.

182
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,649
But you're too experienced
to react rashly...

183
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,611
...which is why the lady for whom you work
lent you that.

184
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:26,282
Oriental pearls, diamonds, a flawless ruby.
Hardly the gems of a governess.

185
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,288
The jewels you are not wearing
tell us more.

186
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,791
- Holmes.
- You were engaged.

187
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,418
The ring is gone,
but the lighter skin suggests...

188
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,296
...that you spent some time abroad
wearing it proudly...

189
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,965
...until you were informed
of its true, modest worth.

190
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,801
You broke off the engagement...

191
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,804
...and returned to England
for better prospects.

192
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,598
A doctor, perhaps.

193
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,232
Right on all counts, Mr. Holmes,
apart from one.

194
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,153
I didn't leave him.

195
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,988
He died.

196
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,500
Well done, old boy.

197
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,122
- Fight. Fight.
- Get him.

198
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,242
McMurdo:
Get up and fight.

199
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,538
Fight.

200
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,206
- Finish it.
- Come on.

201
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,381
Get up and fight, come on.

202
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,592
Come on.

203
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,178
Get up.

204
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,515
Get up and fight.

205
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,232
That's it, big man, we're done.

206
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,318
You won, congratulations.

207
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,403
We ain't done yet.

208
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,453
<i>This mustn't register
on an emotional level.</i>

209
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,289
<i>First, distract target.</i>

210
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,250
<i>Then block his blind jab.</i>

211
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,295
<i>Counter with cross to left cheek.</i>

212
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,632
<i>Discombobulate.</i>

213
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,676
<i>Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker.</i>

214
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,971
<i>Employ elbow block, and body shot.</i>

215
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,474
<i>Block feral left. Weaken right jaw.</i>

216
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,103
<i>Now fracture.</i>

217
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,481
<i>Break cracked ribs.</i>

218
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,316
<i>Traumatize solar plexus.</i>

219
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,276
<i>Dislocate jaw entirely.</i>

220
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,490
<i>Heel kick to diaphragm.</i>

221
00:17:56,534 --> 00:18:00,955
<i>In summary, ears ringing, jaw fractured,
three ribs cracked, four broken...</i>

222
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,916
<i>...diaphragm hemorrhaging,
physical recovery, six weeks...</i>

223
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,919
<i>...full psychological recovery,
six months...</i>

224
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,504
<i>...capacity to spit at back of head...</i>

225
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,048
<i>...neutralized.</i>

226
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,078
Where did that come from?

227
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,411
What the hell's going on here, Charlie?

228
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,122
Lord Blackwood's put him
under some kind of spell, sir.

229
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,042
It's like he's burning from the inside out.

230
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,422
You lot, shut up!

231
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,424
Charlie. Charlie!

232
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,718
Take this man to the infirmary, now.

233
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,608
What's this all about, then, Blackwood?

234
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,948
There's someone I want to see.

235
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,637
- Watson?
- Right.

236
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,472
Let's go.

237
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,058
What started merely as an experiment...

238
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,144
...has brought me to the threshold
of a monumental discovery.

239
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,273
Now, if I play a chromatic scale...

240
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,733
...there's no measurable response.

241
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,653
You do know what you're drinking
is meant for eye surgery?

242
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,154
But, now...

243
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,656
...and this is remarkable...

244
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:44,451
...if I change to atonal clusters...

245
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,957
...voilé, they fly in counterclockwise,
synchronized concentric circles...

246
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,709
...as though a regimented flock.

247
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,502
Watson, this is exceptional.

248
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:58,465
I, using musical theory,
have created order out of chaos.

249
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,260
How did you lure them in?

250
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,137
Excellent question.

251
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,181
Individually. I've been at it for six hours.

252
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,018
- And what happens if I do this?
- What?

253
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,689
- Right.
- Clean yourself up.

254
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,317
You are Blackwood's last request.

255
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,789
Look at those towering structures.

256
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,252
It's the first combination of bascule
and suspension bridge ever attempted.

257
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,338
Most innovative.

258
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,717
What an industrious empire.

259
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,677
Hm?

260
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,388
Oh, I have your winnings from last night.

261
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,601
You weren't there,
so I made your customary bet.

262
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:56,482
Right. I'll keep it with your checkbook,
locked safely away in my drawer.

263
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,320
Did you know the opera house
is featuring Don <i>Giovanni?</i>

264
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:06,075
I could procure a couple of tickets if you
had any cultural inclinations this evening.

265
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,580
You have the grand gift of silence,
Watson.

266
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,375
It makes you quite invaluable
as a companion.

267
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,129
I knew she'd been engaged.

268
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,422
She had told me.

269
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,257
So that's no to the opera, then?

270
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:32,059
- That was my waistcoat.
- We agreed it's too small for you.

271
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:33,727
- I'd like it back.
- We agreed.

272
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,396
I want it back.

273
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,305
This way, Mr. Holmes.

274
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,436
Blackwood certainly seems to have got
the crowd into something of a fear frenzy.

275
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:19,064
Which I'm certain will disperse
once his feet have stopped twitching.

276
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,733
Care to come along?

277
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,194
No, old cock.
I've no business with him whilst he's alive.

278
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,655
Suit yourself, mother hen.

279
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,754
It seems you have lots of rooms to let.

280
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,716
We had to move the prisoners, sir.
Otherwise we were gonna have a riot.

281
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:49,178
He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.

282
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,929
As though...

283
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,433
...he can get inside their heads.

284
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,439
I can find my own way
if you have other duties to perform.

285
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,358
Much obliged, sir. Thank you, sir.

286
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:08,030
If any man have an ear, let him hear.

287
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:11,075
I stood upon the sand of the sea
and saw a beast rise up...

288
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,993
...having seven heads and 10 horns.

289
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,454
Upon his heads were
the name of blasphemy.

290
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,873
They worshiped the dragon,
which gave power.

291
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,626
They worshiped, saying,
"Who is like unto the beast?"

292
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,669
The beast which I saw
was like a leopard.

293
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,506
His feet were of a bear,
his mouth was of a lion...

294
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:29,301
...and the dragon gave him his power
and his seat and great authority.

295
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,762
I love what you've done with the place.

296
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,724
So glad you could accept my invitation.

297
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,936
I just have a small point of concern.

298
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,523
- How can I help?
- I'd followed the murders with interest.

299
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,526
While my heart went out
to the families of the victims...

300
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:49,655
...I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery
in the stroke of your brush.

301
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,241
- You're too kind.
- However, by comparison...

302
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:56,245
...your work in the crypt
was more akin to a finger painting.

303
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,960
So now you're curious
as to whether there's a larger game afoot.

304
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,796
Either that or, um...

305
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:09,842
...shortly my friend will pronounce you dead
and I thought I might keep him company.

306
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,428
Your mistake is to imagine that
anything earthly's led to this moment.

307
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:17,599
Your error of judgement is to assume
that I'm holding the brush at all.

308
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,311
- I'm merely the channel.
- My only wish is that I caught you sooner.

309
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,273
You see,
five lives might have been spared.

310
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,442
Mm. Those lives were a necessity.

311
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,944
Hm.

312
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,779
Sacrifice.

313
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,241
Five meaningless creatures
called to serve a greater purpose.

314
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,827
I wonder if they'd let Watson and me
dissect your brain.

315
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,745
After you're hanged, of course.

316
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,750
I'd wager there's some deformity
that'd be scientifically significant.

317
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,546
Then you, too,
could serve a greater purpose.

318
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,800
Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze.

319
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:56,805
I'm concerned you underestimate
the gravity of coming events.

320
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,641
You and I are bound together
on a journey...

321
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,394
...that will twist the very fabric of nature.

322
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:07,024
But beneath your mask of logic,
I sense a fragility.

323
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,276
That worries me.

324
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,779
Steel your mind, Holmes.

325
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,448
I need you.

326
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:17,034
You've come a long way down
from the House of Lords.

327
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,785
- And I will rise again.
<i>-Bon voyage.</i>

328
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,621
Pay attention.

329
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:24,124
Three more will die, and there is
nothing you can do to save them.

330
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,336
You must accept
that this is beyond your control...

331
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:31,048
...or, by the time you realize you
made all of this possible...

332
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:34,468
...it'll be the last sane thought
in your head.

333
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,560
What did he want?

334
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,312
Not sure.

335
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,440
But I don't think you're needed, Father.
Not for this one.

336
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,194
<i>Lord Henry Blackwood...</i>

337
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:56,782
...you are sentenced to death
for the practice of black magic...

338
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,285
...the unholy murder of five
innocent young women...

339
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,871
...and the attempted murder of a sixth.

340
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,540
Do you have any final words?

341
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,168
Death...

342
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,380
...is only the beginning.

343
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,643
forever and ever. Amen.

344
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:49,251
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.

345
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,608
London's so bleak this time of year.

346
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,446
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.

347
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,115
I much prefer to travel in the winter.

348
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,746
Here, I brought you these,
all the way from Syria.

349
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,790
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...

350
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,959
...and your favorite...

351
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,503
...olives from the Cyclades.

352
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,922
Thought we might have a little tea party.

353
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,551
And while I was setting the table,
I found this:

354
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,803
A file with my name on it.

355
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,973
"Theft of Velézquez portrait
from king of Spain."

356
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,978
"Missing naval documents lead
to resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."

357
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,150
"Scandalous affair ends engagement of...

358
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,739
...Hapsburg prince
to Romanov princess."

359
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,826
I was simply studying your methods...

360
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,953
...should the authorities
ask me to hunt you down.

361
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,663
Ah.

362
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,999
But I don't see my name
in any of these articles.

363
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,959
But your signature was clear.

364
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,588
Is that the maharajah's
missing diamond?

365
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,966
Or just another souvenir?

366
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,677
Let's not dwell on the past.

367
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,889
Shall we?

368
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,185
By the looks of things,
you're between jobs.

369
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:33,605
And you between husbands.
How much did you get for the ring?

370
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:37,692
He was boring and jealous,
and he snored.

371
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,489
I'm Irene Adler again.

372
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,331
Thank you.

373
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,880
I need your help.

374
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,842
I need you to find someone.

375
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,887
Why are you always so suspicious?

376
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,557
Shall I answer chronologically
or alphabetically?

377
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:12,727
Careful not to out yourself
on this lethal envelope.

378
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,692
I think you'll find all the information
you need inside.

379
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,695
Who are you working for?

380
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,073
So I'll have to find out the hard way?

381
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,577
Keep your money.
I didn't say I'll take the case.

382
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,246
Well, consider it a wager that you will.

383
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,374
Do you remember The Grand?

384
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,751
They gave me our old room.

385
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,516
Hold the door.

386
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,560
Thanks, doctor.

387
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,626
Ma'am.

388
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,508
- He'll do it.
- Well done, Miss Adler.

389
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,427
That's precisely why I hired you.

390
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,181
I wager he'll have our man
within the next 24 hours.

391
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,933
He'd better.

392
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,310
Reordan is the key
to what Blackwood was doing.

393
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,146
He's essential to my plan.

394
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,482
Get off out of it.

395
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,276
What you doing?
Can't you see where you're going?

396
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,445
- You scalp diver.
- Get off out of it.

397
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:49,157
A little rifle range
would go a long way, sir...

398
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,702
...rubbing the calluses
off these German bands.

399
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,788
God save the queen.

400
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,249
God save the queen, sir.

401
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,750
Get off out of it.

402
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,214
Look at you.

403
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,425
Why is the only woman
you've cared about a criminal?

404
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,635
Are you a masochist?

405
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,887
- Allow me to explain.
- Allow me.

406
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,849
She's the only adversary
who ever outsmarted you. Twice.

407
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,685
Made a proper idiot out of you.

408
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,479
- Right, you've had your fun.
- What's she after, anyway?

409
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,107
- It's time to press on.
- What could she possibly need?

410
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,692
It doesn't matter.

411
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,987
An alibi? A beard? A human canoe.

412
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,990
She could sit on your back
and paddle you up the Thames.

413
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,242
That's of no consequence to you, is it?

414
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,369
We've done our last case together.

415
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,121
I've already read it.

416
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,999
Missing person:

417
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,168
Luke Reordan, 4 foot 10,
red hair, no front teeth.

418
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,378
Case solved.

419
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,840
You're obviously not her type.
She likes ginger dwarves.

420
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,633
- Midget.
- So you agree?

421
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,051
No, I don't agree.

422
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,804
It's more than technicality, you see.

423
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,057
You're misrepresenting the dimensions
of foreshortened peoples.

424
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,728
- I've said too much. I've upset you.
- No, I am simply stating that one has--

425
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,396
What were you doing?

426
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,190
- Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.

427
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,258
- Holmes. What are you doing?
- Nothing.

428
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,094
- Are you wearing a false--?
- False nose? No.

429
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,680
- Tell me that that wasn't...
- That wasn't.

430
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,684
Holmes. Where are you going?

431
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,106
Watson.

432
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,526
Watson.

433
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,383
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.
Cut you a deal because you're so pretty.

434
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:15,428
Oh. My lucky day.

435
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,473
Hello, gorgeous.
You got something for me?

436
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,937
Don't move.

437
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,983
Now, what have we got here?

438
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,486
It's--

439
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,533
Thank you.

440
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,619
That's the Irene I know.

441
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,336
Good boy.

442
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,174
This man intrigues me, Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.

443
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,718
- Which is no mean feat.
- She's intimidated.

444
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,052
She's scared of him.

445
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,387
Yet she works for him.

446
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,932
- Right.
- It's nothing to do with me...

447
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,852
...but I advise you leave the case alone.

448
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,562
Well, I may not have a choice.

449
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,858
After all, I may be paying the rent
on my own soon, thanks to you.

450
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,903
- Get that out of my face.
- It's not. It's in my hand.

451
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,404
Get what's in your hand out of my face.

452
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,864
- Mr. Holmes?
- CIarkie.

453
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,159
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks
that you come with me at once.

454
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,995
What's he done now,
lost his way to Scotland Yard?

455
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,247
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."

456
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,916
No, "you" means you.

457
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,502
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He, uh...

458
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,003
Well...

459
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,465
...it appears he's come back
from the grave, sir.

460
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:26,226
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.

461
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,269
I pronounced the man dead myself.

462
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,689
What are the facts?

463
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,109
Groundskeeper saw him walking
through the graveyard this morning.

464
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,987
I'll leave this in your capable hands.

465
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,742
- I have an appointment with Mary.
- It's not my reputation that's at stake here.

466
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,452
Don't try that.

467
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,872
- The newspapers got wind of it?
- That's what we're trying to avoid.

468
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,624
Certainly.

469
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,251
What's the major concern?

470
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,878
Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.

471
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,923
- Indeed.
- You're not taking this seriously, are you?

472
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,591
Yes, as you should.

473
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,637
It's a matter of professional integrity.

474
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,766
No girl wants to marry a doctor
who can't tell if a man's dead or not.

475
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,118
Who do you think won the match,
Clarkie?

476
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,704
- Sir?
- The rugby match.

477
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:32,000
Your boys have done a magnificent job
obliterating any potential evidence.

478
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:36,170
Yes. But at least they never miss
an opportunity to miss an opportunity.

479
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,175
You took your time, Holmes.

480
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,512
"And on the third day"...

481
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,309
These slabs are half a ton each
if they're a pound...

482
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,561
...and they're smashed open
from the inside.

483
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,355
Lestrade, what of the coffin?

484
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,859
- We are in the process of bringing it up.
- I see.

485
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,114
Hm. Right. At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?

486
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,452
Anyhow, where's our witness?

487
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:08,912
He's over there.

488
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,247
And apparently, he is Gate——

489
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,457
Cat--

490
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,125
Catatonic, sir.

491
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,211
- He's not feeling very well.
- Yes.

492
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:23,217
If you lot don't stop behaving like quivering
milkmaids, you're on double-time.

493
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,888
Now, you get down there
and you bring that coffin up now.

494
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,474
Good day, sir.

495
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,060
Hello.

496
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,812
It's all right.

497
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,689
I'm a doctor.

498
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,327
The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.

499
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,165
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.

500
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:55,792
Well?

501
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:59,087
- Well?
- You pronounced him dead.

502
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,756
He had no pulse.

503
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,096
Ready.

504
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,431
Down.

505
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,945
Good Lord.

506
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,115
That's not Blackwood.

507
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:32,120
Well, now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious.

508
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,126
Time of death?

509
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,672
Diptera is...

510
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,341
...approximately...

511
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:49,095
...two thirds of an inch
which would put the time of death...

512
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,305
...at between 10 and 12 hours ago.

513
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,808
May I borrow your pen?

514
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,898
- Adler's dwarf.
- Midget.

515
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,118
I know what I saw.

516
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,329
It was Blackwood.

517
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,958
As clear as I see you.

518
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,421
And when the dead walk...

519
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,175
...the living will fill these coffins.

520
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,637
Well, um...

521
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,810
Right.
Put the lid on and clean this lot up.

522
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,021
You really believe he was resurrected?

523
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,190
The question is not if, but how.

524
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,358
- The game's afoot.
- Follow your spirit--

525
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,235
And upon this charge, cry:

526
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,781
"God for Harry, England and St. George."

527
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,576
There you are.

528
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,329
Why that certain chips stall,
I don't understand.

529
00:40:56,496 --> 00:41:00,708
There's a particular beer in their batter.
A northern stout, to be exact.

530
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:04,670
You know, Holmes,
I've seen things in war I don't understand.

531
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,131
I once meta man
who predicted his own death...

532
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,634
...right down to the number
and the placement...

533
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,053
...of the bullets that killed him.

534
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,805
You have to admit, Holmes...

535
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,599
...that a supernatural explanation
to this case...

536
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,893
...is theoretically possible.

537
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:24,065
Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake
to theorize before one has data.

538
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,984
Inevitably one begins to twist facts
to suit theories...

539
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,362
...instead of theories to suit facts.

540
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:33,407
That said, I believe Adler's midget
is the key to this.

541
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,909
Hm.

542
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:38,246
Right. Scratches around
the keyhole where the watch was wound.

543
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,040
- What does that tell you?
- The man was likely a drunk.

544
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,585
Every time he wound the watch
his hand would slip, hence the scratches.

545
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,795
Very good, Watson.

546
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:49,674
You've developed considerable
deductive powers of your own. Hm.

547
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,593
Let's see now, there are several
sets of initials scored--

548
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,303
- Pawnbrokers' marks.
Excellent.

549
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,766
Most recent of which are "M.H."
M.H. M.H. is for?

550
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,477
- Maddison and Haig.
- Maddison and Haig.

551
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,608
They should be able to
give us an address.

552
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,322
What a coincidence.

553
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,951
There's one thing you've
failed to deduce from the watch.

554
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,536
Really? I think not.

555
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:21,914
The time. I have to get back, Holmes.

556
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,958
Taking tea with the in-laws.

557
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,419
- Reckon your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.

558
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,130
- No, thank you.
- You need to hear what I have to tell.

559
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,632
We have no need of your lucky heather,
gypsy woman.

560
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,051
Even if it's to do with Mary?

561
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,474
Oh. Oh.

562
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,644
I see two men. Brothers.

563
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,646
Not in blood, but in bond.

564
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,027
What of Mary?

565
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:54,989
M for Mary, for marriage.
Oh, you will be married.

566
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,158
Go on.

567
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,536
I see patterned tablecloths...

568
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,164
...and, oh, china figurines...

569
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,291
...and, oh, lace doilies.

570
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,001
Doilies.

571
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,671
Lace doilies'? Holmes.

572
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,133
Does your depravity know no bounds?

573
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,135
- No.
- Oh, she turns to fat...

574
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,137
...and, oh, she has a beard and...

575
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,473
- What of the warts?
- She's covered in warts.

576
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,266
- Enough.
- Are they extensive?

577
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,352
Please, enough.

578
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:28,689
It's the most apt prediction
Flora has made in years.

579
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,234
And precisely the reason
you can't find a suitable ring.

580
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,486
Do you have my money?

581
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:36,197
You are terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre.

582
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,449
- Do you have my cut from the fight?
- Admit it.

583
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,701
- Give me my money! Holmes.
- Admit it!

584
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,413
I see.

585
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,921
Thank you.

586
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:57,718
Well, you've got your ring and
I've got my address for the ginger midget.

587
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:01,389
- Should be just there.
- I think she'll really like this.

588
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:05,309
And I have some change in my pocket.

589
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:12,233
- Shall I look after it for you?
- No,no.

590
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,986
- Don't give it away here.
- No.

591
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,154
I have to go see Mary.

592
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,240
Give her my best.

593
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:22,159
And her family, as well.

594
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,285
It does make a considerable
difference to me...

595
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:07,038
...having someone with me
on whom I can thoroughly rely.

596
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,708
Well, you can rely on me
for exactly 10 minutes.

597
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,296
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

598
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,339
Something did.

599
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,092
Irene Adler was here.

600
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:24,346
Either that or the ginger midget
wore the same Parisian perfume.

601
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,643
Ah. Putrefaction.

602
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,985
Ammonium sulfate, among other aromas.

603
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,824
Phosphorous.

604
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,494
Formaldehyde.

605
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,341
It looks like...

606
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,427
...he was attempting to combine...

607
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,972
...some kind of sorcery
and scientific formula.

608
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,857
More importantly...

609
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,985
...let's see what he was
trying to dispose of.

610
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,781
Potassium, magnesium.
- Sultaphytic acid.

611
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:27,910
It'll suck the iron right out of the ink
as long as it's not too burnt.

612
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,218
Peculiar.

613
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,973
Hydrated rhododendron.

614
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,250
- Holmes.
- Hm?

615
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:17,918
Look at the crest.

616
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,838
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

617
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,756
Of course he was.

618
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,217
The question is, to what end.

619
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,433
Whatever he was working on,
he clearly succeeded.

620
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,934
How so?

621
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,312
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.

622
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:39,106
Which is why Miss Adler
is so desperate to find him.

623
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,774
Yes.

624
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,943
There is one odor
I can't quite put my finger on.

625
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,447
- Mm?
- Is it candy floss? Molasses?

626
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:47,990
Maple syrup?

627
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:49,283
Barley sugar.

628
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,202
Toffee apple.

629
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,292
Let me guess.

630
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,586
Judging by your arsonist tool kit...

631
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:04,715
...you're here to burn down the building
and extinguish all evidence therein.

632
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,134
Just one minute, boys.

633
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,094
Oh, Dredger.

634
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,115
Meat...

635
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,659
...or potatoes?

636
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:34,036
My 10 minutes are up.

637
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,882
You all right?

638
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,293
Holmes...

639
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,253
...what is that?

640
00:50:51,253 --> 00:51:21,253
<b>YAWNTiC Encode 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

641
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,588
Holmes!

642
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,726
Watson...

643
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,354
...what have you done?

644
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,325
I haven't slept all night.

645
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,494
Not a wink.

646
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:34,331
Why I ever believed...

647
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:38,251
...that I would get to have tea
with Mary's parents is beyond me...

648
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:42,631
- ...having been talked into going with you.
- We were set upon. It was self-defense.

649
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:47,052
I've been reviewing my notes
on our exploits over the last seven months.

650
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:49,012
Would you like to know my conclusion?

651
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,516
- I am psychologically disturbed.
- How so?

652
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:56,853
Why else would I continually be
led into situations...

653
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:01,608
...where you deliberately withhold
your plans from me? Why else?

654
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,779
You've never complained
about my methods before.

655
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:08,240
- I'm not complaining.
- What do you call this?

656
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,283
How am I complaining? I never complain.

657
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,370
Do I complain about you practicing
the violin in the morning...

658
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:17,749
...or your mess, your lack of hygiene,
or the fact that you steal my clothes?

659
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,126
We have a barter system.

660
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,628
Do I complain
about you setting fire to my rooms?

661
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:22,838
- Our rooms.
- The rooms.

662
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:25,632
When do I complain
that you experiment on my dog?

663
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:26,967
- Our dog.
- On the dog.

664
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:28,593
Gladstone is our dog.

665
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,807
Where I do take issue is your campaign
to sabotage my relationship with Mary.

666
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,858
I understand.

667
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,735
- Do you?
- I do.

668
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,363
- I don't think you do.
- You're overtired.

669
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,490
- Yes.
- You're feeling sensitive.

670
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,825
I'm not sensitive.

671
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:54,202
What you need is a rest.

672
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,038
My brother, Mycroft,
has a small estate near Chichester.

673
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:01,626
Beautiful grounds. There's a folly.
We can throw a lamb on the spit.

674
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:05,589
We? Holmes, if I were to go to the country,
it would be with my future wife.

675
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:08,842
- Well, certainly, if we must--
- No, not you. Mary and I.

676
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:10,802
- You are not--
- What, invited?

677
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,597
Why would I not be invited
to my brother's country home?

678
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,307
Now you're not making any sense.

679
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:16,516
You're not human.

680
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,018
John Watson?

681
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,562
Yes.

682
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,522
Your bail's been posted.

683
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,946
Mary.

684
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,285
Just Watson.

685
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,546
I hope you get bail by breakfast,
because the boys are getting hungry.

686
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,053
Step lively.

687
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,934
Back off. Back off.

688
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,561
To which the barman says,
"May I push in your stool?"

689
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,691
Right, you, you're out.

690
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,402
Until next time, Big Joe.

691
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,947
Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes.

692
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,659
Thank heaven you're here.
I'd almost run out of jokes.

693
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,953
In another life,
you'd have made an excellent criminal.

694
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:21,498
And you, sir, an excellent policeman.
Tomski, thank you.

695
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,459
Now, please tell me you have answers.

696
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,920
All in good time, Lestrade.

697
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:30,590
"All in good time"? Is this some parlor game
Where we guess what you're thinking?

698
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:33,969
I've got a public in frenzy out there.
If you don't fill me in...

699
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:37,973
...I'll have you in there playing Victoria
and Albert quicker than a bookie's runner.

700
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:41,268
Now, clean up
and make yourself presentable.

701
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,769
For whom?

702
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:46,648
Friends in high places.
They're the ones who bailed you out.

703
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:00,704
I'm terribly sorry
to inconvenience you, sir...

704
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,290
...but I'm gonna have to put this on you.

705
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,464
Mr. Holmes,
apologies for summoning you like this.

706
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:15,427
I'm sure it's quite a mystery
as to where you are and who I am.

707
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:16,970
As to where I am...

708
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:21,308
<i>...I was, admittedly, lost for a moment
between Charing Cross and Holborn.</i>

709
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:24,603
But I was saved by the bread shop
on Saffron Hill...

710
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:28,315
<i>...the only baker to use a certain
French glaze on their leaves...</i>

711
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:29,733
<i>...a Brittany sage.</i>

712
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:34,654
The carriage forked left, then right,
a telltale bump over the Fleet Conduit.

713
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:38,825
And as to who you are, that took every
ounce of my not inconsiderable experience.

714
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:42,329
The letters on your desk are addressed
to Sir Thomas Rotheram.

715
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,915
Lord Chief Justice,
that'd be your official title.

716
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,668
Who you really are is, of course,
another matter entirely.

717
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,171
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring...

718
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,882
...you're the head of
the Temple of the Four Orders...

719
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,842
...in whose headquarters we now sit...

720
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:59,179
...on the northwest corner
of St. James's Square, I think.

721
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:03,767
As to the mystery, the only mystery is
why you bothered to blindfold me at all.

722
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:10,190
Yes, well, standard procedure,
I suppose.

723
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,361
I daresay we have the right man,
gentlemen.

724
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:17,280
Sherlock Holmes,
Ambassador Standish from America...

725
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,366
...and Lord Coward, the home secretary.

726
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:23,870
I suppose you already have some notion
as to the practices of our order.

727
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,539
Yes. Um...

728
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,376
They're practically interesting.

729
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,961
Be as skeptical as you like.

730
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:34,589
But our secret systems have steered
the world towards good for centuries.

731
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:38,176
The danger is they can also be used
for more nefarious purposes.

732
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:41,137
What some call the dark arts,
or practical magic.

733
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:44,891
We know
you don't believe in magic, Mr. Holmes.

734
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,644
We don't expect you to share our faith...

735
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:49,229
...merely our fears.

736
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,982
Fear is the more infectious condition.

737
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,150
In this instance...

738
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:58,238
...fear of your own child.

739
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,201
Blackwood is your son.

740
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:06,830
You have the same irises,
a rare dark green...

741
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,915
...with diamond-shaped hazel flecks...

742
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:13,086
...together with identical outer ears, which
are only passed down through bloodline...

743
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:15,296
...which makes you either brothers...

744
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:18,216
...or, in this case, more likely,
father and son.

745
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,683
Very few people
are privy to that information...

746
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,685
...and we want to keep it that way.

747
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,608
He was conceived
during one of our rituals.

748
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,193
His mother wasn't my wife...

749
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,612
...but she shared our beliefs.

750
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,948
She was a powerful practitioner...

751
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,784
...though not enough
to survive giving birth to him.

752
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,788
Death followed him wherever he went.

753
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,374
Those five girls were not the first
to be butchered.

754
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,711
He killed many more,
using them to enhance his powers.

755
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:58,465
No one could prove anything,
of course, but we all knew.

756
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,176
The boy was a curse.

757
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:04,304
We've done our best to stop him,
but it's not enough.

758
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:05,889
His power grows daily.

759
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,141
His resurrection is evidence of that.

760
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,810
But what he does next
will be more dangerous.

761
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:15,482
His secret lies in the book
of spells. This is the source of his power.

762
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,943
He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the course of the world.

763
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,905
We want you to find him
and stop him before he does.

764
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:25,700
We'll give you any assistance
that we can.

765
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:30,330
As home secretary, I have considerable
influence over the police.

766
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:32,040
Hm, yes.

767
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,126
So...

768
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:38,379
...name your price.

769
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:40,757
The benefit of being
a consulting detective...

770
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:43,009
...is that I can pick and choose
my clients.

771
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,678
So consider it done, I'll stop him.

772
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,140
But not for you.

773
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,267
And certainly not for a price.

774
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:58,108
- I do have a parting query, Sir Thomas.
- What is that?

775
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:02,112
If the rest of his family's dead,
how long do you expect to survive?

776
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:04,614
Food for thought.

777
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:33,059
Well, perhaps you'll have better luck
opening that.

778
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,896
Margaux '58. A comet vintage.

779
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,401
How fascinating that an astronomical event
can affect the quality--

780
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:44,070
How is it going with our case
you refuse to take?

781
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,572
- -Of the wine.

782
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:49,659
Oh, I've hit a dead end, literally.

783
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,745
I found your man.

784
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:55,248
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.

785
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:57,500
If you still need him.

786
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:01,254
Oh, dear.

787
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:06,426
Hope my client
doesn't come looking for a refund.

788
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:07,927
He's a professor, isn't he?

789
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,014
<i>Couldn't see his face,
but I spotted chalk on his lapel.</i>

790
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:15,435
I've never known a professor to carry a gun,
and on such a clever contraption.

791
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,941
Eye patch, nice touch.

792
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,944
80 case closed...

793
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:28,114
...which makes this a social visit.

794
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:31,201
No, it's a "you're in over your head,
Irene" visit.

795
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,412
Whoever killed Reordan
was covering their tracks...

796
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,789
...which makes you the next loose end
to be snipped.

797
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,501
Let it breathe.

798
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,588
I've never been in over my head.

799
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:47,300
Leave now. Disappear.
You're good at that.

800
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:51,554
Or stay and volunteer
for protective custody.

801
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:58,144
If I'm in danger, so are you.

802
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,483
Come with me.

803
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,820
What if we trusted each other?

804
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,530
Hm?

805
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:10,782
You're not listening.

806
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:15,536
I'm taking you to either the railway station
or the police station.

807
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:28,841
So...

808
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,013
- Which is it to be?
- Careful.

809
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,517
You decide.

810
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:40,103
—Which will it be?
- What——?

811
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,563
I told you to let it breathe.

812
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,525
Can you taste the comet?

813
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:54,951
Why couldn't you just
come away with me?

814
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,037
Never.

815
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:48,981
Madam, I need you to remain calm
and trust me, I'm a professional.

816
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:51,651
But beneath this pillow
lies the key to my release.

817
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:56,155
<i>-She misinterpreted my intention entirely.
CLARK“. Naturally, sir.</i>

818
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:59,117
That's why I find this modern
religious fervor so troubling.

819
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:02,537
- No latitude for misunderstanding.
- Faith runs right over reason, sir.

820
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:05,706
Indeed. And chambermaids
were once such a liberal breed.

821
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:08,167
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.

822
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:14,215
Anyhow, a good thing she was offended,
or we may never have found you.

823
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:18,136
The inspector's been over to Baker Street
himself this morning, sir.

824
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,016
- Just joking about the wife, sir.
- Oh.

825
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:30,064
We've checked everything, sir.

826
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:33,067
No sign of a break-in
and the butler didn't hear a thing.

827
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:35,403
80 body in the bathtub...

828
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:39,824
...his eyes were wide open,
and the only thing missing was...

829
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,869
...his ring, sir.

830
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,720
Why did you drain the water?

831
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:04,557
- Out of common decency.
- Crime is common, logic is rare.

832
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:08,728
The decent thing to do is to catch the killer,
not provide comfort for the corpse.

833
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,911
What is that?

834
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,416
- Jasmine bath salts, sir.
- Superb.

835
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:34,212
Probably comes from a larger container.
It'll either be in the pantry...

836
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:38,090
...high up where it's warm and dry,
or in a linen cupboard with a vent.

837
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,593
Constable, you could do worse...

838
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,055
...than to check the ground under
the rear windows for any footprints.

839
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,933
Data, data, data.
I cannot make bricks without clay.

840
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,910
Mr. Holmes?

841
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,713
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?

842
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:00,673
It was in the pantry, sir.

843
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:02,925
I don't know what to make of this.

844
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,844
Excellent work.

845
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,762
<i>Adieu.</i>

846
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:48,220
What's the meaning of this, Coward?
Why have you called this meeting?

847
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:50,681
Sir Thomas is dead.

848
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:55,895
I nominate Lord Blackwood
as head of the order.

849
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:00,941
Have you lost your mind?

850
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:03,069
You know damn well
what he's capable of.

851
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:05,112
Of course he does.

852
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:08,866
That's why we're here.

853
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,078
That's why we're all here.

854
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:21,754
My powers and my assets
were given to me for one purpose.

855
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:26,300
A magnificent but simple purpose.

856
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:29,512
To create a new future.

857
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:33,599
A future ruled...

858
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,518
...by us.

859
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:42,608
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step
towards a new chapter in our history.

860
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:45,486
Magic will lead the way.

861
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:48,114
Once the people of England
see our newfound power...

862
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,199
...they'll bow down in fear.

863
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:58,958
Across the Atlantic
lies a colony that was once ours.

864
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,459
It will be again.

865
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,629
The Civil War has made them weak.

866
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:08,634
Their government is as corrupt
and as ineffective as ours...

867
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:11,011
...so we'll take it back.

868
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:15,015
We will remake the world...

869
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:18,436
...create the future.

870
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:23,482
These men are with me, Standish...

871
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,192
...but...

872
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:26,861
...are you?

873
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:30,239
No, sir. I am not.

874
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,118
These powers that you're playing with...

875
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:36,328
...no man can control.

876
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:40,249
Well, gentlemen...

877
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:45,171
...someone has to stop him,
even if you won't.

878
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,508
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

879
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:56,724
Save me!

880
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:14,492
Gentlemen...

881
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:16,535
...don't be afraid.

882
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:19,330
As you can see...

883
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:22,625
...we are protected.

884
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:26,378
Come, drink your allegiance here.

885
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:36,388
You control the police, now use them.

886
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,401
Didn't know you were here.

887
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:52,821
Since this room is no longer yours,
do you mind if I utilize it?

888
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,699
Be my guest.

889
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:59,078
- In here, chaps.
- Where would you like me...

890
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,664
- ...to put him, sir?
- Anywhere is fine.

891
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:15,386
- Who is he?
- The man who tried to kill you at Reordan's.

892
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:18,430
His neck didn't survive the impact
of Dredger landing on him.

893
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:20,599
Yes.

894
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:23,143
Thanks for that, by the way.

895
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:29,650
There is consolation in the knowledge that
he could be of service to his fellow man.

896
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:38,284
Elbows and arms stained with blood,
but it's older than his own injuries.

897
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:46,292
None of it human.

898
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:48,711
He's not a butcher, let me see.

899
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:01,098
Yellow flame, green bursts.

900
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:02,975
An industrial worker.

901
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,647
Pff. Coal.

902
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,441
River silt.

903
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:12,985
The slag on his trousers
should put him squarely in...

904
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:15,321
- Nine Elms.
- Sorry, what?

905
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:18,157
The area you're looking for is Nine Elms.

906
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,159
I wondered.

907
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:23,662
Do you remember where I put
the Lords Register of members' interests?

908
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,205
It's on the stepladder.

909
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:40,179
Well, Blackwood's had his hand in just about
everything that's corrosive to the spirit.

910
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:43,766
Woolwich Arsenal.
Limehouse Chemical Works.

911
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,934
It'll probably be a factory by the river.

912
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:47,853
What's that?

913
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,772
Never mind.

914
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,859
You don't know where
my rugby ball went, do you?

915
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,361
No, not a clue.

916
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:58,489
Queenshithe Slaughterhouse.

917
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:00,032
Nine Elms.

918
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:02,201
A factory by the river.

919
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:05,537
Well done. That should lead us
to Blackwood, dead or alive.

920
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:07,790
Not us.

921
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,959
You.

922
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:12,878
Yes.

923
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:16,507
Just a figure of speech, old boy.

924
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:26,892
He's left it there on purpose.

925
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,873
More coal, doctor.

926
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,047
That's a good one. He's such a tit.

927
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:58,757
Oh, God. Yeah.

928
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:00,759
Glad to see you two
are working hard.

929
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:03,595
And I thought we were
trying to be discreet.

930
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:07,599
You would not last one day in the navy.

931
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:13,856
Are you sure there isn't an alternative
means of water transportation than that?

932
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:17,609
I guarantee you nobody knows
London's waterways better.

933
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:21,280
- Tanner's practically a fish himself.
- He certainly drinks like one.

934
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,615
Oh, you found a sense of humor, doctor.

935
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:26,034
If only just a sense.

936
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:30,372
I better take over, there.
Bit tricky down here.

937
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:53,437
Come on, come on.

938
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,287
- Look familiar?
- Yep.

939
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:13,123
All that's missing is a ginger midget.

940
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:28,055
They cleared something away from here
not minutes ago.

941
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:29,807
Like what?

942
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:33,185
Not sure. Something mechanical.

943
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:34,978
Holmes.

944
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,356
Look at this.

945
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,131
1 8.
—Chapter and verse.

946
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:07,052
Revelations 1:18.
"I am he that Iiveth, and was dead."

947
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,472
"And behold, I'm alive for evermore."

948
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:15,477
I warned you, Holmes, to accept
that this was beyond your control...

949
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:18,522
...beyond what your rational mind
could comprehend.

950
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:24,069
- What a busy afterlife you're having.
- I want you to bear witness.

951
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:29,157
Tomorrow, at midday,
the world as you know it will end.

952
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:31,743
Show me your face,
it'll be the end of your world.

953
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,871
Save your bullets, Watson.

954
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:35,539
A gift for you.

955
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:43,005
What was that about saving bullets?

956
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:51,722
She followed you here, Holmes.

957
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:56,602
You led your lamb to slaughter.

958
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:00,939
Holmes.

959
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,276
This game was designed to hurt.

960
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:17,372
Watson!

961
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:22,794
It's warm in here, Watson.

962
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,637
In over your head yet, darling?

963
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,271
- Hold on there.
- I can't.

964
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:43,106
Let me take your weight.

965
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:46,026
Give us a leg up, old boy.

966
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:50,322
These German locks
always give me trouble.

967
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:57,579
It's a band saw.

968
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,001
No matter, we have plenty of time.

969
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:06,046
Holmes.

970
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,181
- It's not working.
- Keep calm.

971
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:26,149
Holmes, hurry up.

972
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:36,535
Don't get excited. Turn off that valve.

973
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,645
And we'll bounce in three, two...

974
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:06,231
...one.

975
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:17,826
Thank you.

976
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,579
I'm gonna get after Blackwood.

977
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:31,882
Thank you.

978
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:34,926
We should help the doctor.

979
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:48,023
Holmes!

980
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:21,575
Mr. Holmes.

981
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,036
Sir.

982
01:25:28,582 --> 01:25:30,500
Mr. Holmes.

983
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:43,054
Mr. Holmes, we have an order
for your arrest, sir.

984
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:48,143
Sir!

985
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:51,980
Lord Coward has issued a warrant
for your arrest, sir.

986
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:54,774
Now, Watson's alive.

987
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:57,861
Just get out of here, sir. Go, sir, go.

988
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:16,004
Will the train be departing on time?

989
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,465
The train's been delayed, madam.

990
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:20,675
Shouldn't be long now, though.

991
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:40,612
The train will depart when I tell it to.

992
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:45,533
And you will leave my employment
when I allow you to.

993
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:52,207
I fulfilled my contract.

994
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:53,625
I found Reordan.

995
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,961
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.

996
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:57,963
So that's me, finished.

997
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:02,008
Your job was to manipulate Holmes'
feelings for you...

998
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:03,760
...not succumb to them.

999
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,473
You have fulfilled nothing.

1000
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,309
I want what Reordan was making
for Blackwood.

1001
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:15,480
Finish the job or the next dead body...

1002
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:18,275
...will be Sherlock Holmes.

1003
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:46,845
The surgeon should be along shortly.

1004
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:54,019
He should be able to rest now.

1005
01:27:57,147 --> 01:27:58,648
Excuse me.

1006
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:04,362
Is that the best you can do?

1007
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,364
Yes, for now.

1008
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:08,658
I must attend to my other patients.

1009
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:12,078
Doctor.

1010
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,205
Doctor.

1011
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,291
Please.

1012
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:23,214
I know that you care for him
as much as I do.

1013
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:26,801
This is not your responsibility,
it was his choice.

1014
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:30,722
He'd say that it was worth the wounds.

1015
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:39,230
Solve this.

1016
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:42,067
Whatever it takes.

1017
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:54,245
<i>This is beyond your control.</i>

1018
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,039
<i>Sheer bloody panic, sir. Panic.</i>

1019
01:28:56,206 --> 01:28:59,000
<i>- It's Lord Blackwood, sir.
- I've never been in over my head.</i>

1020
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:03,046
<i>It's nothing to do with me,
but I advise you leave the case alone.</i>

1021
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:04,881
<i>- Solve this.</i>
<i>- Are you, Holmes?</i>

1022
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:07,050
<i>Accept that this was beyond your control.</i>

1023
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:10,553
<i>- Tomorrow, at midday, the world will end.
- I've got a public in frenzy.</i>

1024
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,055
<i>WATSON“.
Holmes!</i>

1025
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:34,744
<i>Widen your gaze.</i>

1026
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:37,455
<i>You must widen your gaze.
Widen your gaze.</i>

1027
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:42,043
<i>You and I are bound together on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature.</i>

1028
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,295
<i>Steel your mind, Holmes.
Widen your gaze.</i>

1029
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:46,881
<i>He's gonna raise a force
that Will alter the world.</i>

1030
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:49,926
<i>- His power grows daily.</i>
<i>- This is the source of his power.</i>

1031
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:51,094
<i>[need you.</i>

1032
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:53,805
<i>His secret lies in the book of spells.</i>

1033
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:23,877
<i>Three more will die...</i>

1034
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:27,297
...and there is nothing you can do
to save them.

1035
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:30,341
<i>We know you don't believe in magic.</i>

1036
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:33,219
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

1037
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:34,429
Is that better?

1038
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:37,056
<i>He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.</i>

1039
01:30:38,308 --> 01:30:42,187
His eyes were wide open
and the only thing missing was his ring.

1040
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:51,196
<i>Give up, Holmes.</i>

1041
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:55,867
<i>This is a riddle you cannot solve.</i>

1042
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:03,374
Good morning.

1043
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:10,048
Now, you need to work.

1044
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:12,175
Familiar artwork.

1045
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:16,554
You look gorgeous.

1046
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:22,018
Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.

1047
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:31,402
You made the front page.

1048
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,530
Only a name and no picture.

1049
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:38,868
So it looks like you'll be needing to
work outside the law now...

1050
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:41,079
...and that's my area of expertise.

1051
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:43,206
I feel safer already.

1052
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:47,794
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.

1053
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:50,713
Yes.

1054
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:53,424
Took the shrapnel out myself.

1055
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:56,427
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.

1056
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:03,184
Well, I'm...

1057
01:32:03,601 --> 01:32:05,144
I'm just so...

1058
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:06,896
...very glad that you're...

1059
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:08,439
...well...

1060
01:32:08,898 --> 01:32:10,358
...with us.

1061
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:18,866
Now that you're sitting comfortably,
I shall begin.

1062
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:22,412
My initial approach was far too narrow.

1063
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:25,039
When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville Prison...

1064
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:28,626
...he suggested I widen my gaze
and, at minimum, I have done just that.

1065
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:33,798
In fact, I may well have reconciled
thousands of years of theological disparity.

1066
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:37,468
But that's for another time.

1067
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:40,805
Blackwood's method is based on
a ritualistic mystical system...

1068
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:44,267
...that's been employed by the
Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.

1069
01:32:44,434 --> 01:32:47,520
To fully understand the system,
to get inside it...

1070
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:51,232
...I reenacted the ceremony
we interrupted at the crypt...

1071
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:53,318
...with a few enhancements of my own.

1072
01:32:54,277 --> 01:32:58,323
My journey took me somewhat further down
the rabbit hole than I had intended...

1073
01:32:58,489 --> 01:33:02,994
...and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail,
I have emerged enlightened.

1074
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:06,831
The fraternity who silently control
the empire...

1075
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:10,168
...share the belief with the kings,
pharaohs and emperors of old...

1076
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:13,129
...that the Sphinx was a door
to another dimension...

1077
01:33:13,296 --> 01:33:15,381
...a gateway to immeasurable power.

1078
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:19,302
It's made up of four parts:
the foot of a lion, the tail of an ox...

1079
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:21,846
...the wings of an eagle,
and the head of a man.

1080
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:25,558
<i>In Sir Thomas's secret chamber,
I found the bone of an ox...</i>

1081
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:28,811
<i>...the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle
and hair of a man.</i>

1082
01:33:28,978 --> 01:33:30,355
Map.

1083
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:37,028
The points of the star
represent the five murdered girls...

1084
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:40,156
...but the cross
is what we're now interested in.

1085
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:41,699
It's a widely held belief...

1086
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:45,244
...that within the architecture
of the great cities...

1087
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:48,164
...are coded references to this system.

1088
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:51,334
Since he rose from the grave,
Blackwood has killed three men...

1089
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:55,004
...each committed at a location
that has a connection with the temple...

1090
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:56,547
...therefore the system.

1091
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:00,551
<i>Reordan, the ginger midget,
represents man.</i>

1092
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:02,720
We found his body here.

1093
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:06,557
Sir Thomas, master of the temple,
wore the ox ring.

1094
01:34:07,517 --> 01:34:09,060
He died here.

1095
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,521
Standish, ambassador to America...

1096
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:14,816
...where the eagle has been
the national emblem for over 100 years.

1097
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:19,070
The headquarters of the Temple
of the Four Orders where he died...

1098
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:21,489
...is here.

1099
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:25,493
Correspondingly, the map will tell us
the location of Blackwood's final act.

1100
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:28,496
So we have man, the ox, eagle.

1101
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:30,581
Only the lion remaining.

1102
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:31,916
Right here.

1103
01:34:34,585 --> 01:34:35,753
Parliament.

1104
01:34:40,591 --> 01:34:42,051
Right.

1105
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:45,763
You four stay here
and the rest of you come with me.

1106
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,808
- Get out of the way, you lowlifes!
- Right this way.

1107
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,105
Ladies first.

1108
01:34:54,272 --> 01:34:55,773
Now.

1109
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:58,025
Follow these instructions.

1110
01:34:58,192 --> 01:34:59,736
- Aren't you--?
- Go.

1111
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:05,533
Hello, hello, hello.

1112
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:08,286
Did the devil turn up?

1113
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:10,913
Well...

1114
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:12,957
...never mind.

1115
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:15,126
You got the next best thing.

1116
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:42,820
Beg your pardon, my Lord.
I know that it's unorthodox...

1117
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:45,490
...but Mr. Holmes here...

1118
01:35:45,656 --> 01:35:49,327
...he's been making some
serious accusations about you...

1119
01:35:50,536 --> 01:35:52,079
...and the order.

1120
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:55,166
I see.

1121
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:59,504
Well, at least that solves the great mystery
as to how you became inspector.

1122
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:06,802
Excuse me, my Lord...

1123
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:09,847
...but I've been wanting to do that
for a long time.

1124
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:13,684
Well, inspector, I have five minutes
before my next engagement...

1125
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:17,688
...so why don't you regale me
with your stories of conspiracy?

1126
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:22,276
Thank you, Lestrade.

1127
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:24,362
My Lord.

1128
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:33,329
I'm curious, Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders...

1129
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:35,498
...or just the one I prevented?

1130
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:39,126
Very distinctive,
those handmade shoes of yours.

1131
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:46,425
But the price of quality
is often the unique imprint they leave.

1132
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:50,555
Nonetheless, I confess to being
completely outmatched.

1133
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:54,016
I could deduce very little
from my investigation.

1134
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:57,562
Fortunately,
there's nothing more stimulating...

1135
01:36:57,728 --> 01:37:00,064
...than a case where everything
goes against you.

1136
01:37:00,731 --> 01:37:04,235
How many members of Parliament
do you intend to murder at noon today?

1137
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:06,028
Man, ox, eagle, lion.

1138
01:37:06,904 --> 01:37:08,489
The lion is Parliament, isn't it?

1139
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:13,286
Very clever.

1140
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:16,247
But it's not murder, Mr. Holmes.

1141
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:18,082
It's mercy.

1142
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:20,751
We are giving the weak masses
a strong shepherd.

1143
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:23,379
Don't you see that it's for their own...?

1144
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:28,884
No, but I don't care much what you think.

1145
01:37:29,051 --> 01:37:31,929
I simply wanted to know the location
of Blackwood's ceremony...

1146
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:33,514
...and you've given it to me.

1147
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:34,890
I've told you nothing.

1148
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:38,769
But your clothes say
infinitely more than you could ever hope.

1149
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:40,146
<i>The mud on your boots
from where you've been walking.</i>

1150
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:45,610
<i>A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you've been kneeling.</i>

1151
01:37:46,902 --> 01:37:50,114
<i>A small bandage on your thumb
from where you've been vowing.</i>

1152
01:37:50,281 --> 01:37:54,285
<i>A faint aroma of excrement
from where you've been standing.</i>

1153
01:37:56,537 --> 01:37:59,290
You and Blackwood laid the final touches
to your ceremony...

1154
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:02,543
...in the sewers beneath Parliament
less than an hour ago.

1155
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:05,630
Both houses meet today.

1156
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:08,215
The whole government will be present.

1157
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,895
It's a shame you made an enemy
out of Blackwood, Holmes.

1158
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,397
You would have made a valuable ally.

1159
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:32,740
How terrible is wisdom...

1160
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,785
...when it brings no profit to the wise.

1161
01:38:36,494 --> 01:38:37,995
We take power at noon.

1162
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:41,332
There isn't any time to waste then,
is there?

1163
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:10,444
I told you he'd be coming
out the top window.

1164
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:13,114
There isn't any way
he'd be coming over that terrace.

1165
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:16,117
Technically, that isn't the top window,
is it, sailor boy?

1166
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:18,786
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.

1167
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:20,121
Anyway.

1168
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:23,791
You'll be pleased to know
Lestrade performed perfectly.

1169
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:25,626
In fact, I think he enjoyed it.

1170
01:39:25,793 --> 01:39:27,503
I hope you know what you're doing.

1171
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:29,880
Here's the key.

1172
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:33,884
- You got all you needed from Coward?
- Yes, I smoked him out with relative ease.

1173
01:39:35,261 --> 01:39:36,303
- Tanner?
- Sir?

1174
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:37,722
If you would, captain...

1175
01:39:37,888 --> 01:39:40,725
...take us under the bridge,
port side, 100 yards.

1176
01:39:40,891 --> 01:39:44,228
Beyond that you'll find the tunnel
that leads us to the sewers.

1177
01:39:44,395 --> 01:39:45,813
Right away, sir.

1178
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:54,447
The end is nigh.

1179
01:39:54,613 --> 01:39:58,909
Blackwood's come back from hell
and laid a curse upon this land.

1180
01:39:59,076 --> 01:40:02,705
He walks in every shadow
and every puff of smoke.

1181
01:40:02,872 --> 01:40:05,541
Behold, he cometh with clouds...

1182
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:08,544
...and every eye shall see him...

1183
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:12,298
...and every soul shall wail
because of him.

1184
01:40:12,465 --> 01:40:15,468
You cannot stop him!
No one can!

1185
01:40:45,498 --> 01:40:47,958
Behold, Blackwood's magic revealed.

1186
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:50,461
- What does it do?
- It's a chemical weapon.

1187
01:40:51,253 --> 01:40:52,379
The first of its kind.

1188
01:40:52,546 --> 01:40:54,507
You deduced that how?

1189
01:40:54,673 --> 01:40:56,425
From my pocket.

1190
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:59,595
I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat
at the slaughterhouse.

1191
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:02,890
Note the blue discoloration,
the faint smell of bitter almonds.

1192
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:05,142
- Telltale traces of cyanide.
- Cyanide.

1193
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:06,894
Shh.

1194
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:12,274
Now we know
what the ginger midget was working on.

1195
01:41:12,441 --> 01:41:14,318
It'll revolutionize warfare.

1196
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:16,028
Yes, killing a lot of people.

1197
01:41:16,195 --> 01:41:18,823
Now, it's seven minutes to noon.
What are we gonna do?

1198
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:21,992
Right. How many men
did you count on the--?

1199
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:27,623
She loves an entrance, your muse.

1200
01:41:58,404 --> 01:41:59,697
Woman!

1201
01:42:00,823 --> 01:42:02,700
Shoot him. Now, please.

1202
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:16,130
My lords.

1203
01:42:16,755 --> 01:42:17,798
My lords.

1204
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:19,842
My lords.

1205
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:22,052
The time has come...

1206
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:24,555
...for only those who believe to remain.

1207
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:27,683
Behold...

1208
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:29,727
...Lord Blackwood.

1209
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:44,366
You seem surprised.

1210
01:42:47,077 --> 01:42:50,497
I have returned from beyond the grave
to fulfill England's destiny...

1211
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:55,419
...and extend the boundaries
of this great empire.

1212
01:42:58,088 --> 01:43:00,049
Listen to the rabble outside.

1213
01:43:00,716 --> 01:43:02,217
Listen...

1214
01:43:02,384 --> 01:43:03,761
...to the fear.

1215
01:43:04,386 --> 01:43:06,055
I will use that as a weapon...

1216
01:43:06,221 --> 01:43:08,140
...to control them...

1217
01:43:08,641 --> 01:43:09,892
...and then the world.

1218
01:43:14,271 --> 01:43:16,565
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.

1219
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:23,197
Specifically designed
to prevent us from disarming it.

1220
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:28,744
These appear to be designed
to receive a signal of some sort.

1221
01:43:28,911 --> 01:43:30,120
Electromagnetic waves?

1222
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:31,956
<i>When triggered, the electrodes...</i>

1223
01:43:32,122 --> 01:43:34,708
<i>...will send a charge
converting the chemical into gas.</i>

1224
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:38,754
<i>The gas will travel up that shaft
and filter through the ventilation system...</i>

1225
01:43:38,921 --> 01:43:41,548
<i>...that leads directly to Parliament.
Within seconds...</i>

1226
01:43:41,715 --> 01:43:44,802
<i>...the most powerful men in the world
will be choking on death.</i>

1227
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:48,305
Blackwood must have some transmitter
that he can activate remotely.

1228
01:43:48,472 --> 01:43:50,307
Three minutes, 10 seconds.

1229
01:43:50,724 --> 01:43:54,812
I will create an empire
that will endure for millennia...

1230
01:43:55,437 --> 01:43:57,064
...indestructible...

1231
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:58,482
...and eternal.

1232
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:00,901
Move it. Move it.

1233
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:03,821
We don't actually have to
disarm the device...

1234
01:44:03,988 --> 01:44:07,533
...we just have to remove the cylinders.

1235
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:10,661
Yes, except that they're welded in.

1236
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:13,956
What we need is a controlled explosion.

1237
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:17,710
We'll need a container to direct the blast.
My clay pipe should service that ambition.

1238
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:41,108
I rather wish you hadn't done that,
Hene.

1239
01:44:47,406 --> 01:44:52,411
On the 12th chime,
I will summon the dark powers.

1240
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:57,332
All those of you who are with me
shall be protected.

1241
01:44:57,499 --> 01:44:58,542
All others...

1242
01:44:58,709 --> 01:45:00,044
...will perish.

1243
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:08,969
I need your pipe.

1244
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,058
Nut him!

1245
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:40,751
- Right.
- What?

1246
01:45:40,918 --> 01:45:42,586
- Coat.
- Got it.

1247
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,084
The new order...

1248
01:46:23,544 --> 01:46:24,628
...begins now.

1249
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:31,802
Woman.

1250
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:34,263
What are you waiting for?

1251
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:38,350
That

1252
01:46:49,653 --> 01:46:51,321
Apprehend Lord Coward.

1253
01:46:53,907 --> 01:46:55,784
- Can you manage?
- Course I can.

1254
01:47:22,811 --> 01:47:24,229
Relax...

1255
01:47:24,396 --> 01:47:25,439
...I'm a doctor.

1256
01:48:37,594 --> 01:48:40,013
Did you take a wrong turning
somewhere?

1257
01:48:42,057 --> 01:48:43,267
We're safe now.

1258
01:48:44,309 --> 01:48:45,602
Interesting assessment.

1259
01:48:48,146 --> 01:48:49,815
Run off.

1260
01:48:52,067 --> 01:48:53,860
I won't be chasing you anymore.

1261
01:48:55,445 --> 01:48:57,281
Fare thee well.

1262
01:49:02,452 --> 01:49:04,454
I don't want to run anymore.

1263
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:09,793
- I'll tell you everything.
- I wish you would.

1264
01:49:33,984 --> 01:49:35,152
No!

1265
01:50:41,009 --> 01:50:42,469
There was never any magic.

1266
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:46,223
Only conjuring tricks.

1267
01:50:50,852 --> 01:50:52,854
The simplest involved
paying people off...

1268
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:56,274
<i>...like the guard who pretended
to be possessed outside your cell.</i>

1269
01:50:56,441 --> 01:50:58,985
Your reputation
and the inmates' fear did the rest.

1270
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:03,073
Others required
more elaborate preparations...

1271
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:06,535
...like the sandstone slab
that covered your tomb.

1272
01:51:07,494 --> 01:51:11,456
You had it broken before your burial,
then put back together using an adhesive.

1273
01:51:12,791 --> 01:51:15,252
An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe...

1274
01:51:15,419 --> 01:51:17,504
<i>...a mixture of egg and honey...</i>

1275
01:51:18,171 --> 01:51:20,424
...designed to be washed away
by the rain.

1276
01:51:25,429 --> 01:51:26,763
Holmes!

1277
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:29,683
Arranging for your father
to drown in his own bathtub...

1278
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:31,685
<i>...required more modern science.</i>

1279
01:51:31,852 --> 01:51:34,771
Very clever of Reordan
to find a paralytic...

1280
01:51:34,938 --> 01:51:37,941
...that was activated by the combination
of copper and water...

1281
01:51:38,108 --> 01:51:41,445
...and was therefore undetectable
once the bath water was drained.

1282
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:44,281
That might've been a challenge for me...

1283
01:51:44,448 --> 01:51:48,034
...had he not also tested it
on some unfortunate amphibians.

1284
01:51:52,706 --> 01:51:55,792
The death of Standish
was a real mystery...

1285
01:51:55,959 --> 01:51:59,045
...until you used the same compound
to blow up the wharf.

1286
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:02,799
<i>An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid...</i>

1287
01:52:03,425 --> 01:52:05,552
...yet it burned
with an unusual pinkish hue.

1288
01:52:07,637 --> 01:52:10,974
Did Standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple?

1289
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:13,602
All it took was a spark.

1290
01:52:18,064 --> 01:52:20,275
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.

1291
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:23,153
<i>Ingenious.</i>

1292
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:26,781
Like all great performers, you saved
your piece de resistance for the end:

1293
01:52:26,948 --> 01:52:31,745
<i>A chemical weapon distilled from cyanide
and refined in the bellies of swine.</i>

1294
01:52:31,912 --> 01:52:33,455
Had it worked...

1295
01:52:33,622 --> 01:52:36,500
...your followers in Parliament
would have watched unharmed...

1296
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:39,169
...as their colleagues
were dying around them.

1297
01:52:39,336 --> 01:52:41,338
They didn't know
you'd given them the antidote.

1298
01:52:41,505 --> 01:52:43,924
<i>Instead,
they would've believed it was magic...</i>

1299
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:46,801
<i>...and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.</i>

1300
01:52:47,135 --> 01:52:50,847
And the world would've followed,
fear being the most powerful weapon of all.

1301
01:52:52,807 --> 01:52:55,685
You'd better hope
that it's nothing more than superstition...

1302
01:52:55,852 --> 01:52:58,021
...as you performed
all the rituals perfectly.

1303
01:52:58,855 --> 01:53:00,815
<i>The devil is due a soul, I'd say.</i>

1304
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:05,195
For God's sake, Holmes, cut me loose.

1305
01:53:15,997 --> 01:53:19,626
First, the world will see you
for what you are. A fraud.

1306
01:53:21,211 --> 01:53:22,546
Then you'll be hanged.

1307
01:53:22,712 --> 01:53:24,548
Properly, this time.

1308
01:53:24,714 --> 01:53:26,841
It's a long journey from here to the rope.

1309
01:54:18,184 --> 01:54:21,104
I've never woken up in handcuffs before.

1310
01:54:22,105 --> 01:54:23,648
I have.

1311
01:54:24,941 --> 01:54:26,526
Naked.

1312
01:54:30,488 --> 01:54:32,616
Storm's coming.

1313
01:54:32,907 --> 01:54:36,453
Well, we've still got a moment.

1314
01:54:40,457 --> 01:54:41,708
Moriarty.

1315
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:43,293
What?

1316
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:45,462
That's his name.

1317
01:54:46,046 --> 01:54:48,214
And he is a professor.

1318
01:54:50,342 --> 01:54:52,427
Everyone has a weak spot...

1319
01:54:52,844 --> 01:54:55,096
...and he found mine.

1320
01:54:56,514 --> 01:54:58,475
Where was it, precisely?

1321
01:55:09,361 --> 01:55:12,489
- Please don't underestimate him.
- Mm.

1322
01:55:12,656 --> 01:55:15,033
He's just as brilliant as you are...

1323
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:17,452
...and infinitely more devious.

1324
01:55:17,619 --> 01:55:19,829
We'll see about that.

1325
01:55:36,304 --> 01:55:38,682
You'll miss me, Sherlock.

1326
01:55:40,684 --> 01:55:42,352
Sadly...

1327
01:55:42,977 --> 01:55:44,646
...yes.

1328
01:56:10,004 --> 01:56:11,840
Just keep it under your hat.

1329
01:56:12,006 --> 01:56:14,926
Afternoon, sir.
I put the notebooks in this one, sir.

1330
01:56:15,093 --> 01:56:17,053
- Thank you.
- What's in these, John?

1331
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:18,221
Scribbles.

1332
01:56:18,388 --> 01:56:19,889
- Scribbles?
- Notes.

1333
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:22,726
They're your adventures.
I'd like to read them.

1334
01:56:29,566 --> 01:56:30,900
Come on, what's wrong?

1335
01:56:31,067 --> 01:56:33,611
Do you think he's come to terms
with you leaving?

1336
01:56:33,778 --> 01:56:37,157
Mary, look at the ring he's given us.

1337
01:56:37,782 --> 01:56:40,076
Now, five minutes here
and we'll go home.

1338
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:41,619
Our home.

1339
01:56:41,786 --> 01:56:43,455
Get up those stairs.

1340
01:56:51,379 --> 01:56:52,922
Don't worry, dear.

1341
01:56:53,089 --> 01:56:55,175
Suicide is not in his repertoire.

1342
01:56:55,341 --> 01:56:57,635
He's far too fond of himself for that.

1343
01:56:58,261 --> 01:56:59,929
Holmes.

1344
01:57:01,556 --> 01:57:03,683
Oh. Good afternoon.

1345
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:07,937
I was trying to deduce the manner
in which Blackwood survived his execution.

1346
01:57:08,104 --> 01:57:10,190
Clearing your good name, as it were.

1347
01:57:10,523 --> 01:57:13,067
But it had a surprisingly
soporific effect...

1348
01:57:13,234 --> 01:57:16,946
...and I was carried off in the arms
of Morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon.

1349
01:57:17,113 --> 01:57:18,448
Good afternoon, dear.

1350
01:57:18,615 --> 01:57:20,283
Get on with it, Holmes.

1351
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:24,120
Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot
was a hook.

1352
01:57:24,287 --> 01:57:27,290
Oh, dear, my legs have fallen asleep.
I should come down.

1353
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:29,042
John, shouldn't we help him down?

1354
01:57:29,209 --> 01:57:31,628
No,no,no,
I hate to cut him off midstream.

1355
01:57:31,795 --> 01:57:32,962
Carry on.

1356
01:57:34,005 --> 01:57:36,674
Well, the executioner
attached it to a harness...

1357
01:57:36,841 --> 01:57:39,636
<i>...allowing the weight to be
distributed around the waist...</i>

1358
01:57:39,803 --> 01:57:41,846
...and the neck to remain intact.

1359
01:57:42,013 --> 01:57:45,475
My Lord, I can't feel my cheeks.
Might we continue this at ground level?

1360
01:57:45,642 --> 01:57:47,268
How did you manage it, Holmes?

1361
01:57:47,894 --> 01:57:51,105
I managed it with braces,
belts and a coat hook.

1362
01:57:52,065 --> 01:57:54,943
Please, my tongue is going,
I'll be of no use to you at all.

1363
01:57:55,109 --> 01:57:56,820
- Worse things could happen.
- John.

1364
01:57:59,656 --> 01:58:02,784
Yet none of this explains
Blackwood's lack of pulse.

1365
01:58:02,951 --> 01:58:04,327
Right.

1366
01:58:04,494 --> 01:58:09,791
Now, <i>the medical mystery.
We must restore your reputation, Watson.</i>

1367
01:58:09,958 --> 01:58:13,586
There is a toxin refined from the nectar
of the <i>rhododendron ponticum</i>.

1368
01:58:13,753 --> 01:58:16,840
<i>It's infamous in the region of Turkey
bordering the Black Sea...</i>

1369
01:58:17,006 --> 01:58:20,510
...for its ability to induce
an apparently mortal paralysis.

1370
01:58:20,677 --> 01:58:24,097
Enough to mislead a medical mind
even as well-trained as your own.

1371
01:58:24,264 --> 01:58:26,599
- It's known as--
- What's wrong with Gladstone?

1372
01:58:26,766 --> 01:58:28,643
mad honey disease.

1373
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:32,605
Oh, he's demonstrating
the very effect I've just described.

1374
01:58:32,981 --> 01:58:34,315
He doesn't mind.

1375
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:39,279
Mary, don't worry, he's seen far worse.

1376
01:58:39,904 --> 01:58:41,281
Mr. Holmes?

1377
01:58:43,575 --> 01:58:44,826
Doctor. Miss Mary.

1378
01:58:45,535 --> 01:58:48,663
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks that
you come with me right away.

1379
01:58:49,205 --> 01:58:52,542
- What is it is this time, Clarkie?
- It's one of our sergeants, sir.

1380
01:58:52,709 --> 01:58:55,295
He went missing
the day you stopped Lord Blackwood.

1381
01:58:55,461 --> 01:58:59,048
<i>I'm afraid sewage workers
found his body just this morning, sir.</i>

1382
01:58:59,507 --> 01:59:02,552
We believe the sergeant
was our first man on the scene.

1383
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,512
Can I help you, officer?

1384
01:59:05,263 --> 01:59:06,306
Shot in the head.

1385
01:59:07,974 --> 01:59:09,726
Was it a small caliber bullet?

1386
01:59:10,852 --> 01:59:12,186
Yes.

1387
01:59:13,688 --> 01:59:15,940
Were there powder burns
on his eyebrows?

1388
01:59:16,107 --> 01:59:17,775
Indeed, sir.

1389
01:59:19,903 --> 01:59:21,237
Point blank range?

1390
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:22,655
Moriarty.

1391
01:59:24,073 --> 01:59:26,242
Professor Moriarty.

1392
01:59:28,786 --> 01:59:30,747
Oh, there's a good boy.

1393
01:59:30,914 --> 01:59:32,498
Everything's gonna be fine.

1394
01:59:33,708 --> 01:59:35,376
Where is Blackwood's device now?

1395
01:59:35,543 --> 01:59:38,588
Secret Service have it, sir.
They've taken over the case.

1396
01:59:39,088 --> 01:59:41,299
I'd wager there's a piece missing.

1397
01:59:43,259 --> 01:59:46,304
So Moriarty was after
a piece of the machine...

1398
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:48,181
...not the poison.

1399
01:59:48,348 --> 01:59:50,767
There's nothing more elusive
than an obvious fact.

1400
01:59:50,934 --> 01:59:53,394
<i>The Wire-free invention
was the game all along.</i>

1401
01:59:53,561 --> 01:59:56,022
And Adler was just the diversion.

1402
01:59:56,189 --> 01:59:58,816
<i>He knew I'd chase her,
leaving the machine accessible.</i>

1403
01:59:58,983 --> 02:00:02,862
<i>A technology of that kind
would be worth an untold fortune.</i>

1404
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:05,323
Imagine being able
to control any device...

1405
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:09,160
...simply by sending a command
via radio waves.

1406
02:00:09,953 --> 02:00:11,955
It's the future, Watson.

1407
02:00:14,248 --> 02:00:16,709
I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.

1408
02:00:20,046 --> 02:00:21,631
- Well...
- Well...

1409
02:00:22,966 --> 02:00:25,843
- Gladstone.
- Stop him before he gets to the front door.

1410
02:00:26,427 --> 02:00:27,845
Clarkie.

1411
02:00:30,098 --> 02:00:31,933
Case reopened.
