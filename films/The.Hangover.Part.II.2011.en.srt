1
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:05,744
You've reached Dr. Stuart Price.

2
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:10,212
The office will be closed until the 24th.
If this is an emergency, please try...

3
00:01:14,544 --> 00:01:16,387
Hi. This is Dr. Stu Price.

4
00:01:16,546 --> 00:01:19,800
I'm getting married, so I'll be out
of the country for two weeks.

5
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:24,563
I'm not sure if I'll have cell service.
If this is a dental emergency, plea...

6
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:26,014
Nothing.

7
00:01:32,312 --> 00:01:34,235
Daddy, please. You're not helping.

8
00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:38,744
I looked into his eyes.
Not the eyes of a man.

9
00:01:38,902 --> 00:01:41,246
The eyes of a coward.

10
00:01:45,158 --> 00:01:47,001
Excuse me.

11
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:53,007
- Phil.
- Tracy.

12
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:54,922
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:57,053
Where the hell are you?

14
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:00,928
It happened again.

15
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:03,264
Don't say that.

16
00:02:03,426 --> 00:02:04,427
Please.

17
00:02:04,594 --> 00:02:06,688
No, this time we really fucked up.

18
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:09,396
Seriously, what is wrong with you three?

19
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:12,815
So much, Trace,
I don't even know where to begin.

20
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:14,946
Oh, God. How bad?

21
00:02:15,814 --> 00:02:17,612
Like no wedding bad?

22
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,117
Yeah.

23
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:23,072
Little worse than that.

24
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,348
Mm-hm.

25
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:12,806
You really need to floss more.

26
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:15,101
Fuck that. That's why I come here.

27
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:17,689
Then you should come more than
once every two years.

28
00:04:17,852 --> 00:04:22,198
- So you could bleed me of all my money?
- I never charge you a dime, Phil.

29
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:25,406
- Hey, how do I work the nitrous?
- Uh, you don't, actually.

30
00:04:25,568 --> 00:04:27,570
Come on. Just one hit.

31
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:31,537
Fillings look pretty good.
Any other problems?

32
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:35,754
Yeah, actually.
You're getting married in Thailand.

33
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:39,883
For starters, that's flights for me and Steph.
That's two grand right there.

34
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,509
My mother-in-law's watching the kids.

35
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:43,921
Now she's got this whole new thing
to hold over my head.

36
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:46,089
Plus it takes five days to get there.

37
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:49,760
It's a 16-hour flight.
And it's beautiful when you get there.

38
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:52,054
- Whatever. it's a hassle.
- It is kind of far.

39
00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:54,932
Lauren's been there a week
and she's still jet-lagged.

40
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:57,271
It's where her parents are from.
It means a lot.

41
00:04:57,434 --> 00:05:00,529
Who gives a shit about her parents?
Her dad hates you.

42
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:03,110
He doesn't hate me.

43
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:05,947
He's just never spoken to me.
I think it's a cultural thing.

44
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:09,158
Why can't you get married in Vegas
like last time? So much easier.

45
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,449
Why can't you just be excited for me?

46
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:14,788
This is my wedding.

47
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:20,794
You're really happy, huh?

48
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,301
I really am.

49
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:29,473
All right. I'm happy too.

50
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:32,760
Thank you.

51
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:34,144
It's gonna be fun.

52
00:05:36,473 --> 00:05:39,147
Phil? Put the prescription pad back.

53
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:56,793
Thank you.
You know that's a felony, right?

54
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:58,498
Fuck you, man.

55
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,840
- Was this right up against your scrotum?
- Yep.

56
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:07,171
- Oh, my God. I just realized.
- What?

57
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:09,089
I forgot to renew my passport.

58
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:10,507
Oh, no.

59
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:13,927
Good thing I did it last week.
It's in the kitchen drawer.

60
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:15,811
You're the best.

61
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,688
Hey, we're a team.

62
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:22,694
No, I mean, you are a good guy.
Like, a really good guy.

63
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:24,945
Thank you.

64
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:26,948
So I know you're not gonna get mad.

65
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:29,484
Mad? What...? Mad at what?

66
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:32,947
Alan found out that we're going to Thailand
for Stu's wedding.

67
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:34,160
So?

68
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:37,201
So he's heartbroken, Doug.
You guys are like his family.

69
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:39,369
No, your family is like his family.

70
00:06:39,953 --> 00:06:44,299
All Alan talks about is the three of you.
And that weekend.

71
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:47,051
Wait. Is he the one that keeps calling
and hanging up?

72
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:51,890
He does that when he's upset. He doesn't
understand why he's not invited.

73
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:54,054
Could you just run it by Stu?

74
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:56,686
Just run it by him.

75
00:06:57,178 --> 00:06:58,430
For me?

76
00:07:00,932 --> 00:07:02,229
No fucking way.

77
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:03,735
Absolutely not.

78
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:06,362
Come on, Stu. it's killing him.

79
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:07,898
I don't care.

80
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:10,158
Honestly, the two of you
were barely invited.

81
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:12,068
- Oh.
- All right. I get it. I really do.

82
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:15,580
Just, you know what? Alan considers you
to be one of his best friends.

83
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,285
I consider Alan to be insane.

84
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:18,574
Stu, throw him a bone.

85
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:21,039
His dad pays
for everything he eats and breaks.

86
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:23,921
We should squeeze the old man
to cover the bachelor party.

87
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,127
That's good.

88
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:30,342
I'm glad you brought that up,
because this is the bachelor party.

89
00:07:30,503 --> 00:07:32,176
- What?
- What are you talking about?

90
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:34,261
Yeah. it's my bachelor brunch.

91
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:39,726
Go crazy. Get some chocolate-chip
pancakes, a lap dance from the waitress.

92
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:44,396
That's bullshit. Ha, ha. You can't just
skip out of a bachelor party, Stu.

93
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:48,154
You see that?
That's orange juice with a napkin on top.

94
00:07:48,313 --> 00:07:51,032
Do you know why?
So nobody roofies me.

95
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:53,990
Well, I refuse to eat fucking cantaloupe
at a bachelor party.

96
00:07:54,152 --> 00:07:56,246
Come on.
Don't you think you're overreacting?

97
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:58,498
No, I don't.

98
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:02,620
I'm still putting the broken pieces
of my psyche back together.

99
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:06,247
And you know what the glue is?

100
00:08:06,414 --> 00:08:09,714
Lauren. And I'm not doing anything
to screw that up.

101
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:13,005
- You wouldn't be with her if it wasn't for us.
- Oh, this'll be good.

102
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:15,640
Stu, think about it.
You ended up ditching Melissa.

103
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:17,892
Two years later,
you met your true soul mate.

104
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:21,806
You take Vegas out of that equation,
you would have married a cunt.

105
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:25,312
It's okay. I'm allowed to say it.
It's a bachelor party.

106
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:26,943
Drink up, everybody.

107
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:29,900
Wait, there's no alcohol.
I forgot, we're at a fucking IHOP.

108
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:33,158
Well, it's my decision and it's final,
so how about a toast?

109
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:37,162
- This sucks. I'm gonna wait in the car.
- Come on, Phil. Where you going?

110
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,789
I just don't get it.
He's getting married in Thailand.

111
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:42,827
That's great for him, but what about us?
You're just selfish.

112
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:44,961
Come on, sweetheart.

113
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:47,338
Shame on you.

114
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:53,466
Don't worry, Stu.
I will stand up for you no matter what.

115
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:54,925
Thank you.

116
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:58,012
But you gotta help me out
with this Alan thing.

117
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:02,596
Guys, I can't tell you
how much this means.

118
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:06,266
Alan's been waiting for the invite
ever since he got wind of the wedding.

119
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:07,479
I'm sure he has.

120
00:09:07,642 --> 00:09:10,862
Yeah, he's been standing outside
by the mailbox every day.

121
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,694
- Wow, that's rough.
- Yeah. I, uh...

122
00:09:13,856 --> 00:09:18,362
I'm not quite sure he ever left Vegas,
you know? He really needs this.

123
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:20,697
[KNOCKS ON Doom

124
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:22,035
What?

125
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:25,577
Sweetie, it's Pa Pa. You have visitors.

126
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:29,543
Go in slowly,
give him a chance to acclimate.

127
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,551
Hey, Alan.

128
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:36,008
Hey, guys.

129
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:38,677
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, bud.

130
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:42,556
Uh... Uh, you guys wanna come in?

131
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,938
- Sure.
- Yeah, absolutely.

132
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,227
- Hey.
- Hey.

133
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,516
Hey.

134
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:52,020
- Hey, Stu.
- Okay. See you on the court in half...

135
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:56,149
Pretty cool room, Alan.

136
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:58,865
Oh, thanks, Phil. My dad pays my rent.

137
00:09:59,027 --> 00:10:00,745
Alan, what the fuck?

138
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:04,407
We were supposed to delete these.
You made a promise.

139
00:10:04,574 --> 00:10:07,453
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell?

140
00:10:07,618 --> 00:10:10,497
I'm not cool with this at all.
You can't have these.

141
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,549
- Ha, ha.
- Chillax, Stu. Nobody ever comes in here.

142
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,301
Total violation of trust.

143
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,588
Mother, I'm done with my lunch.
It's just sitting here.

144
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:21,182
Sorry, honey. I'll be right up.

145
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:23,264
Can't believe you stopped by.
This is cool.

146
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:25,178
Wait a second. Al, is that Mr. Chow?

147
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:27,393
Yeah. We still keep in touch.

148
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:29,186
Stu.

149
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:31,602
- The guy that kidnapped us?
- He didn't kidnap us.

150
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:33,520
He kidnapped Black Doug. Remember?

151
00:10:33,686 --> 00:10:36,280
It was a whole big misunderstanding.
He's actually quite charming.

152
00:10:37,774 --> 00:10:40,277
- Alan, he's a criminal.
- Excuse me, boys.

153
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:42,161
- Hi, Linda.
- Hi, Dougie.

154
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,199
I guess we don't do dessert any more.
I didn't get that memo.

155
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:47,584
Well, I'm sorry, darling. I'll be right back.

156
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:49,953
Would a cupcake kill you?

157
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,216
- I don't think this was a good idea.
- Uh, Alan, we have a little surprise for you.

158
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,011
Stu would like to invite you
to his wedding.

159
00:10:58,378 --> 00:10:59,880
Well, only if you're not busy.

160
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,847
Stu.

161
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:04,134
Well, maybe the Jonas Brothers
are in town.

162
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,553
No. They're in Raleigh-Durham
that weekend.

163
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:08,892
Mm.

164
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:12,935
Are you really being serious, Stu?
You're inviting me?

165
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:19,445
Yeah, why not? Could be fun, right?

166
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:24,324
- Phil, are you going?
- Of course.

167
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,498
Then it will be fun.

168
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:36,841
- Ah!
- Whoa, what the fuck are you doing, man?

169
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,761
It's my immunizations.
This is the last day I can do it.

170
00:11:41,754 --> 00:11:44,177
That's supposed to be done
by a registered nurse.

171
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,843
I am a nurse. I'm just not registered.

172
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:48,978
Oh, Stu, look at this.

173
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:50,980
I bought this because I thought of you.

174
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,053
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey, Stu.

175
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:33,723
- Teddy. What's up? How are you?
- Good to see you, man.

176
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,858
- All right.
- Who's this guy, Stu?

177
00:12:36,017 --> 00:12:37,940
This is Teddy, Lauren's little brother.

178
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:40,855
Goes to Stanford. Premed.
This is Phil, Alan and Doug.

179
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:44,652
- Hey, nice to meet you, man.
- Wow, Stanford? How old are you?

180
00:12:44,984 --> 00:12:47,487
- I'm...
- Uh, he's 17. Kind of a genius.

181
00:12:47,653 --> 00:12:49,121
Actually, I'm 16.

182
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,659
And I'm not a genius. My dad just had me
take the entrance exams early.

183
00:12:52,825 --> 00:12:54,498
Because you're a genius.

184
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:58,422
- So, what are you, a doctor?
- No. Not yet. I'm premed.

185
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:01,209
Ever heard of that guy Doogie Howser?

186
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,629
- Yeah.
- Well, he turned out to be a gay.

187
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:07,514
- Alan.
- It's true. I read it in Teen People.

188
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:10,802
Right. Okay, well, I'm gonna grab a book
or something for the plane.

189
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:12,060
You guys want anything?

190
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,267
- No, thanks.
- I'm good.

191
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:15,102
I would actually love a Smartwater.

192
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:16,478
Cool.

193
00:13:17,391 --> 00:13:18,734
Thanks.

194
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:21,939
- What’s the matter with you? He's 16.
- Yeah, Alan. Take it easy.

195
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:24,948
I'm a little confused.
Is he here just to see us off or what?

196
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:27,280
- How does this work?
- How does what work?

197
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:29,411
Is that person coming to the wedding?

198
00:13:30,404 --> 00:13:34,125
Yes, Alan. My bride's little brother
is coming to the wedding.

199
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:35,535
Is that okay with you?

200
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:39,376
Well, it's just the first time I've heard of it.
You could have paged me.

201
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,879
Don't overreact. it's gonna be fine.

202
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:50,550
Hey. Mind if I sit?

203
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:54,892
- Wolf pack only. Find another chair.
- There's no wolf pack, Alan.

204
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:57,273
- Come on.
- It's no problem. I can find...

205
00:13:57,431 --> 00:14:01,106
- Don't be ridiculous. You're sitting here.
- Careful. That's a Louis...

206
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:03,146
That is a Louis Vuitton.

207
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:06,698
Thanks.

208
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:14,290
That's a nice neck roll.

209
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:18,624
Thanks. You can use it if you want.

210
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:20,497
Okay.

211
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:33,904
LAUREN;
Baby! Hi! on, my God!

212
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,663
Ah.

213
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:39,584
- How was your trip?
- It was long, but good.

214
00:15:45,623 --> 00:15:50,174
This is so absolutely beautiful.
Thank you so much.

215
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:51,428
Of course.

216
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:53,840
Between Teddy and me,
you must be pretty excited.

217
00:15:54,006 --> 00:15:56,384
Pretty soon you'll have two doctors
in the family. Ha, ha.

218
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,889
You have to realize that in my country, we
don't consider dentist to be real doctors.

219
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:02,307
Dad.

220
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:03,895
Okay.

221
00:16:04,058 --> 00:16:07,813
Anyway, I have to go and talk to Teddy
about his cello performance tonight.

222
00:16:07,978 --> 00:16:09,275
See you.

223
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:12,942
- Ouch.
- I'm so sorry.

224
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:15,490
Your dad's kind of obsessed
with your brother.

225
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:17,576
Teddy is my dad's prized possession.

226
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:19,706
It's always been that way.

227
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:23,002
He'll warm up. I promise. Okay?

228
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,039
If you just fax it over to me,
I'll pick it up from concierge.

229
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:28,628
Okay. Ha, ha. Thanks, Pa Pa.

230
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:29,792
Bye-bye.

231
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:32,883
That was, uh, my dad.
I'm a stay-at-home son.

232
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:36,094
We were discussing your wedding gift.
He's sparing no expense.

233
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:39,386
Oh, that's so unnecessary.

234
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:42,271
I've been, uh, meaning to ask.
I noticed it's a fishing village.

235
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,432
Is there a Long John Silver's
on the island?

236
00:16:44,598 --> 00:16:47,442
You know, no, I don't think so.
I'm so sorry.

237
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:50,980
But we are actually sewing
some great fresh seafood.

238
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:53,900
- Better than Long John's'?
- Yes.

239
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:56,319
I'll be the judge of that.
Enjoy your evening.

240
00:16:56,485 --> 00:16:59,329
You too. Okay.

241
00:17:35,566 --> 00:17:37,694
All right.

242
00:17:43,365 --> 00:17:44,912
Thank you, Teddy.

243
00:17:45,743 --> 00:17:48,337
The hands of a brilliant musician...

244
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:50,715
and one day, a great surgeon.

245
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:54,510
I admit it.

246
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:58,388
When I first met Stu, I was not quite sold.

247
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:03,310
He seemed unattractive.

248
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:06,393
He lacked intelligence and imagination.

249
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:10,647
He was missing that spark
you look for in a man.

250
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:16,032
But then I look into Stu's eyes.

251
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,569
He reminded me of my sweet brother,
Chaiyo.

252
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,242
For those who do not know...

253
00:18:22,404 --> 00:18:25,408
Chaiyo is learning-disabled
and lives in a group home.

254
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:32,423
But Chaiyo loves chok.

255
00:18:33,082 --> 00:18:34,254
And that's when I realized...

256
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,588
Stu is chok.

257
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:40,593
What's chok?

258
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,094
Chok is soft white rice
in lukewarm water.

259
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:47,514
It has no taste.

260
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,026
We feed it to small baby
and very old people.

261
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:55,947
It is nourishment
that everyone can digest.

262
00:18:56,313 --> 00:18:58,441
The world needs chok.

263
00:18:58,607 --> 00:19:01,702
Just as the world needs people like Stu.

264
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:08,042
To my sweet daughter and Stu.
Congratulations.

265
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,579
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers, guys.

266
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:16,959
And now I believe that Teddy
has something to say.

267
00:19:19,128 --> 00:19:21,347
Sit down. I got this.

268
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,973
Sit down, boy.

269
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,428
That was, uh, a great speech, sir.

270
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:31,983
I like the comparisons between, uh,
Stu and rice.

271
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:36,904
I've also prepared a few words.

272
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:39,990
"Hey, everybody, here are some fun facts.

273
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:43,907
The population in Thailand
is 63 million people.

274
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:46,242
It is twice the size of Wyoming.

275
00:19:46,864 --> 00:19:50,664
Its chief exports are textiles,
footwear and rice.

276
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:56,083
Each year, approximately 13,000 people
are killed in car accidents in Thailand.

277
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:58,091
- The climate in Thailand is..."
- Alan, uh...

278
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,800
Alan, why don't you skip
to the last card there, buddy?

279
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:03,756
Okay. Sorry.

280
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:09,679
"None of you know Stu like I do."

281
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:12,769
Not you. Not you.

282
00:20:13,474 --> 00:20:15,647
Not you. Not you.

283
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:18,107
Not nobody knows Stu like I do.

284
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:21,991
No one.

285
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:25,323
"I can't even tell you
what we've been through...

286
00:20:25,486 --> 00:20:28,365
because we made a pact
more important than blood.

287
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:31,283
What I can tell you is this:

288
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,498
This is not Stu's first marriage.

289
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:37,006
There was a whore in Las Vegas
a couple of years ago..."

290
00:20:37,164 --> 00:20:40,043
All right, time's up.
You can sit down, bud. You can sit down.

291
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:43,763
- It was good. I did good, though.
- Oh, God, you killed it.

292
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:46,674
- Okay. Thanks, Phil.
- Sit down. Yeah.

293
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:56,809
In your face.

294
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:03,320
Well, that was exactly as painful
as I expected it to be.

295
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:05,359
Ha, ha. Sorry.

296
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:08,745
Oh, rice pudding! What are you doing?

297
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:12,659
- Ha, ha, ha. Very funny, Phil.
- Be nice, Phil. He's extra sensitive tonight.

298
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,921
Get over it. He's your father-in-law.
He's supposed to hate you.

299
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,252
Come have a drink with me and the guys.

300
00:21:19,415 --> 00:21:23,716
You know, I'm really exhausted.
We're just gonna go upstairs and crash.

301
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:26,630
I spoke with the manager.
He'll let us have a beach bonfire.

302
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:28,549
That sounds fun.

303
00:21:28,716 --> 00:21:31,720
Nah. I'm good.

304
00:21:31,885 --> 00:21:32,932
He's tired.

305
00:21:33,095 --> 00:21:35,974
Stu. One drink with your friends.
They came all this way.

306
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,861
- I just wanna hang out with you.
- Oh, come on, just go and do me a favor:

307
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:42,238
Take Teddy with you.

308
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:43,898
He never gets to have any fun.

309
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,112
That is a great idea. Bring the kid.

310
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,777
- All right. One drink.
- Perfect.

311
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:49,945
- See?
- You win.

312
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:51,614
- See you later.
- Have fun.

313
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,579
- Got your key?
- Uh, yep. Got it right there.

314
00:21:54,742 --> 00:21:57,621
- I'll see you in 20 minutes.
- I love you.

315
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:03,592
My Uncle Roger said
that he once saw an albino polar bear.

316
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:05,628
Really? Polar bears are white.

317
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:07,637
How would he know if it's an albino?

318
00:22:09,965 --> 00:22:11,262
This one was black.

319
00:22:14,303 --> 00:22:16,726
Did you ever think
maybe it was just a black bear?

320
00:22:20,976 --> 00:22:21,977
Whatevs.

321
00:22:22,603 --> 00:22:24,822
- Okay. Here we go.
- All right.

322
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,028
- American beer.
- Let's do it.

323
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:28,659
Sealed bottles.

324
00:22:28,817 --> 00:22:30,319
Thank you. All right.

325
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:33,330
Um, I'm not really old enough to drink.

326
00:22:33,489 --> 00:22:36,242
Yeah, it's illegal.
Be a shame if somebody reported you.

327
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:39,124
Nobody's reporting anybody.

328
00:22:39,286 --> 00:22:41,334
It's fine, Teddy. Have a little fun.

329
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:43,420
- Careful.
- What? Oh.

330
00:22:43,624 --> 00:22:47,003
What is this? Roasting marshmallows?
Nice touch.

331
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:50,673
- That was Alan's idea.
- Oh. Good thinking, Alan.

332
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:55,928
You know, I gotta hand it to you, Stu.
This place is paradise.

333
00:22:56,095 --> 00:22:57,392
Not bad, right?

334
00:22:57,554 --> 00:23:01,650
And I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm actually jealous of you.

335
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:03,857
I mean, Lauren is an angel.

336
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:06,021
Yeah, she really is amazing.

337
00:23:06,188 --> 00:23:07,440
Wow, you guys are sweet.

338
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:12,578
Not big breasts on her,
but still, solid rack for an Asian.

339
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:14,204
Sorry, Teddy, but it's true.

340
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:15,743
That's okay.

341
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:21,288
That is just wildly inappropriate.
And yet I'm really glad you're here.

342
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:22,955
All you guys.

343
00:23:23,372 --> 00:23:24,373
Even you, Alan.

344
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,215
It means a lot that you made the trip.
Thank you.

345
00:23:28,377 --> 00:23:29,720
Wouldn't miss it, buddy.

346
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:33,716
Great. Now can we have our
one fucking beer, Dad?

347
00:23:33,882 --> 00:23:35,008
Mm-hm.

348
00:23:35,843 --> 00:23:37,186
All right. Toast.

349
00:23:37,344 --> 00:23:39,392
Come on, stand up, guys.

350
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:41,890
Come over here, Alan.

351
00:23:43,392 --> 00:23:46,191
To Lauren and Stu.

352
00:23:46,478 --> 00:23:48,446
- You did it, buddy.
- You sure did.

353
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:50,073
Cheers.

354
00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:09,694
What the hell?

355
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:50,189
What?

356
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:53,526
No.

357
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:17,550
Phil?

358
00:26:18,547 --> 00:26:20,766
I think it's happened again.

359
00:26:21,383 --> 00:26:23,556
Alan, what the fuck did you do?

360
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:26,563
I didn't do anything. I swear to God.

361
00:26:27,264 --> 00:26:29,483
Your hair is gone.

362
00:26:31,143 --> 00:26:32,611
No, no.

363
00:26:33,061 --> 00:26:34,404
UP...

364
00:26:40,193 --> 00:26:42,366
Where the fuck are we?

365
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:52,373
Phil, I'm scared.

366
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:07,103
Stu, come on, get up. We got a situation.

367
00:27:15,103 --> 00:27:17,401
Oh, holy shit.

368
00:27:18,106 --> 00:27:20,074
Where are we?

369
00:27:22,235 --> 00:27:25,614
Oh, my God, Alan. Your head.

370
00:27:25,989 --> 00:27:27,616
No, your head.

371
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:29,285
He's bald.

372
00:27:29,451 --> 00:27:32,250
Stu, you're gonna freak out,
but it's gonna be okay.

373
00:27:32,412 --> 00:27:34,540
Why? What's...? Is it my teeth?

374
00:27:34,706 --> 00:27:35,923
- It's not your teeth.
- No.

375
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:37,426
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

376
00:27:37,584 --> 00:27:39,712
- Did you check the bottoms?
- I did.

377
00:27:42,214 --> 00:27:44,137
Oh, my God.

378
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:47,477
What the fuck? Ow!

379
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,644
That's good.
Why don't you try to wash it off?

380
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:53,150
It's not coming off!

381
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:57,070
This is a real tattoo!

382
00:27:57,687 --> 00:27:59,610
Alan, what did you do?
Did you roofie me?

383
00:27:59,773 --> 00:28:03,118
- I didn't do anything.
- Stu, he swore to God.

384
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,946
What happened?

385
00:28:08,615 --> 00:28:10,788
- Oh, jeez!
- What is it?! What is it?!

386
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:12,919
Help! Back there! What are you'?!

387
00:28:13,495 --> 00:28:14,792
Did you see that jump?

388
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:17,674
- Oh, what the hell?!
- Oh, it's a monkey.

389
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,927
Look at the cute little vest.
Hi, little monkey.

390
00:28:21,086 --> 00:28:22,838
Alan. Alan.

391
00:28:23,672 --> 00:28:24,798
Butthole.

392
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:28,389
- Phone.
- Hi, monkey.

393
00:28:28,552 --> 00:28:30,646
Look, Alan, Alan, go find the phone.

394
00:28:31,763 --> 00:28:33,185
I got it.

395
00:28:34,182 --> 00:28:35,855
Doug. Doug. Where the hell are you?

396
00:28:36,017 --> 00:28:38,816
I'm at breakfast. By the pool.
You guys coming down or what?

397
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:41,607
Oh, Jesus. Thank God. Doug's fine.

398
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:44,026
Stu, Doug's fine! He's at the resort.

399
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:45,865
Why aren't we at the resort?

400
00:28:46,027 --> 00:28:47,574
What's going on? Where are you?

401
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:51,283
I don't know, man. We woke up
in some shithole room in some city.

402
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,703
Oh, God. What city?

403
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:56,873
I don't know, Doug. Fucking Asia Town.

404
00:28:57,372 --> 00:28:59,340
I don't know. I told you.

405
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:01,217
Where are we?

406
00:29:01,376 --> 00:29:03,299
I have no fucking idea.

407
00:29:06,214 --> 00:29:08,717
- Hey, Stu.
- What?

408
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:11,224
Check this out.

409
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:14,724
You ever seen anything like this?

410
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:24,074
- What is that?
- Careful!

411
00:29:24,232 --> 00:29:27,577
Might be a spider's nest.
I've tangled with those before.

412
00:29:28,737 --> 00:29:32,458
I don't get it, man. I mean,
we each had one beer last night, right?

413
00:29:32,616 --> 00:29:35,540
- I mean, you too.
- Yeah, but I left early, remember?

414
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:37,249
I don't remember shit.

415
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:39,915
Tracy wasn't feeling well.
She came down to get me.

416
00:29:40,415 --> 00:29:42,213
Wait a second. Is Teddy with you guys?

417
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:44,548
Teddy? What?
What are you talking about?

418
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:47,089
They've been looking for him
all morning.

419
00:29:47,255 --> 00:29:49,929
- Teddy went to Stanford, right?
- Yeah. Why?

420
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,767
Fuck!

421
00:29:54,012 --> 00:29:55,104
I just found his finger.

422
00:29:55,722 --> 00:29:57,144
What?

423
00:29:57,766 --> 00:30:00,269
I just found his fucking finger, Doug.

424
00:30:00,435 --> 00:30:01,857
Phil, what is going on?

425
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:05,448
All right. All right, all right, all right.

426
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:08,281
This is what we're gonna do.
Tell the girls that we woke up early...

427
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:10,445
and went on a fishing trip.
That's where we are.

428
00:30:10,612 --> 00:30:12,706
- Right.
- All right, stay by the phone.

429
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:15,579
Shit!

430
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:22,006
All right, we got a little bit of a problem.

431
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:24,964
What is that?

432
00:30:25,794 --> 00:30:27,512
We don't know.

433
00:30:28,213 --> 00:30:30,215
Is it a worm?

434
00:30:30,507 --> 00:30:32,601
It's a mushroom.

435
00:30:34,135 --> 00:30:35,978
Yeah, shiitake.

436
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:40,025
Monkey, taste it. What do you think?
Is it shiitake?

437
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:41,435
He can't understand you.

438
00:30:42,644 --> 00:30:44,146
He just did.

439
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:45,988
Why is he pulling on it?

440
00:30:46,147 --> 00:30:47,774
He's probably hungry.

441
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:49,909
Wait a second. Is that...?

442
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:52,992
Aah! What the fuck, man?!

443
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:55,452
Tell that gay monkey
to leave my shit alone!

444
00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:56,912
Chow'?!

445
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,627
You fucking crazy.

446
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,339
Ah, so fucking light in here.

447
00:31:02,497 --> 00:31:03,669
Alan.

448
00:31:04,165 --> 00:31:05,792
Grab me my sunglasses.

449
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:10,840
- It's great to see you, Leslie.
- Mm. Nice to see you too, my little hobo.

450
00:31:11,006 --> 00:31:12,929
Chow, what the fuck are you doing here?

451
00:31:13,091 --> 00:31:16,766
Alan called me a few days ago
and invited me to wedding.

452
00:31:16,928 --> 00:31:19,101
- Excuse me?
- What? He's my plus one.

453
00:31:19,264 --> 00:31:21,358
You didn't have a plus one.
It's $200 a plate.

454
00:31:21,516 --> 00:31:24,861
Guys, guys. Just focus, okay?
Chow, what happened?

455
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,695
You guys texted me, said you fucked up
and looking to party.

456
00:31:35,697 --> 00:31:38,951
I picked you up in my boat
and I brought you here to Bangkok.

457
00:31:39,117 --> 00:31:41,085
And we had a sick night, bitches!

458
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:44,544
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second, Chow.

459
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:46,458
Chow, we're in Bangkok?

460
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:50,346
Holler! City of squalor!

461
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:51,846
Do you know how I got this tattoo?

462
00:31:52,005 --> 00:31:55,350
Uh, yeah. From a fucking tattoo guy.

463
00:31:55,508 --> 00:31:58,011
Come on, Stewie.
Use that big Jewish brain.

464
00:31:58,178 --> 00:31:59,976
Hey, what's the monkey holding?

465
00:32:02,974 --> 00:32:04,271
That's a finger!

466
00:32:04,434 --> 00:32:06,653
Stu, I got some bad news.

467
00:32:07,562 --> 00:32:09,940
Teddy was with us last night.

468
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,612
That's his finger.

469
00:32:11,775 --> 00:32:14,198
Teddy... Teddy's dead?

470
00:32:14,361 --> 00:32:18,411
Ha, ha. Teddy not dead.
He party with us all night.

471
00:32:18,573 --> 00:32:19,745
Well, then where is he?

472
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:21,501
Don't you remember anything?

473
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:25,080
- No!
- No. Nothing, Chow.

474
00:32:25,246 --> 00:32:28,216
Okay, okay. I explain it all, okay?

475
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:30,920
Just let me do one bump,
get my head straight.

476
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:33,088
Come to papa.

477
00:32:33,672 --> 00:32:36,266
- Okay.
- That's a big...

478
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:45,393
You ready for craziest fucking story of...

479
00:32:55,568 --> 00:32:57,115
Chow.

480
00:32:59,114 --> 00:33:00,957
Mr. Chow, are you okay?

481
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:05,916
You gotta be kidding me.

482
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:13,719
Fuck, he's dead.

483
00:33:19,384 --> 00:33:20,727
- Help!
- Stu.

484
00:33:20,885 --> 00:33:23,229
- Help! Help!
- Stu, shut up.

485
00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:24,560
Stu, shut up. Stu, shut up!

486
00:33:25,932 --> 00:33:27,730
- Call an ambulance!
- Shut up!

487
00:33:27,892 --> 00:33:31,897
He's dead. Look, if someone comes and
finds a dead body and a pile of cocaine...

488
00:33:32,063 --> 00:33:34,532
we'll spend the rest of our lives
in a Thai prison. Shh!

489
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,323
Alan. Alan, please stop crying.

490
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:44,501
All right. All right!
I just need a second to figure this out.

491
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:21,867
This is the worst idea ever.
What the fuck is this place?

492
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,751
"Bangkok is the capital of Thailand.
Its population is 12 million people."

493
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:28,503
Alan, put the cards away and help.

494
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,672
Elevator.

495
00:34:35,835 --> 00:34:38,008
I'll get the button. I'll get the button.

496
00:34:40,715 --> 00:34:42,843
What the fuck is the deal
with this monkey?

497
00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:45,057
That monkey gets it.

498
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:48,148
- Come on.
- Oh, fuck. No, the power's out.

499
00:34:48,306 --> 00:34:50,684
- We gotta take the stairs.
- Ah, fuck!

500
00:34:51,309 --> 00:34:52,356
Come on.

501
00:34:57,649 --> 00:34:58,741
Here it is.

502
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:03,488
Feet first, feet first. I've done this before.

503
00:35:04,489 --> 00:35:06,036
Alan.

504
00:35:07,158 --> 00:35:10,082
All right. Careful. Careful.

505
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:33,059
- Stu.
- What?

506
00:35:35,144 --> 00:35:37,192
We still have to find Teddy.

507
00:35:37,355 --> 00:35:39,278
Oh, God.

508
00:35:47,115 --> 00:35:48,116
The roof!

509
00:35:48,908 --> 00:35:50,034
- Teddy!
- Teddy!

510
00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:54,422
- Teddy! Teddy!
- Teddy! Teddy!

511
00:35:55,623 --> 00:35:56,840
ALAN;
Teddy!

512
00:36:00,295 --> 00:36:02,969
- You guys see anything?
- No.

513
00:36:06,134 --> 00:36:09,559
Come on. Where are you, buddy?

514
00:36:12,307 --> 00:36:14,230
He's not here.

515
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:19,443
I can't believe this is happening again.

516
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:26,158
Okay. Look, we'll handle this.
You get back there.

517
00:36:26,321 --> 00:36:29,825
You tell them that Alan and I
got drunk with him, we're still partying.

518
00:36:29,991 --> 00:36:32,210
- You gotta go get married.
- No, no.

519
00:36:32,368 --> 00:36:34,996
I'm not going back without Teddy.

520
00:36:35,163 --> 00:36:38,007
It's Lauren's little brother,
he's lost, he's injured.

521
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:42,087
If I fuck this up...

522
00:36:42,378 --> 00:36:44,881
I lose everything.

523
00:36:47,383 --> 00:36:48,680
Okay.

524
00:36:50,178 --> 00:36:51,350
All right.

525
00:36:52,805 --> 00:36:55,103
Alan, check your pockets.

526
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:56,688
- What?
- You know the drill.

527
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:59,024
Come on, there might be clues.

528
00:36:59,187 --> 00:37:02,487
- Check your phones. Numbers, texts.
- Oh, that's a good idea.

529
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:04,943
- I got nothing. Fuck.
- Me neither.

530
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:07,032
- I got a text from Chow.
- What time?

531
00:37:07,195 --> 00:37:09,197
Uh, 10:00 last night.

532
00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:10,866
What's it say?

533
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:13,751
"On my way, niggas."

534
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,036
Oh, niggas. Okay.

535
00:37:15,203 --> 00:37:16,500
Hip-hop.

536
00:37:19,332 --> 00:37:23,212
We are so fucked.

537
00:37:24,379 --> 00:37:26,552
- Hey, Phil.
- What?

538
00:37:26,714 --> 00:37:28,557
Look who's back. Hi.

539
00:37:30,468 --> 00:37:33,221
We gotta get you out of the sun.
Get you a hat.

540
00:37:33,388 --> 00:37:35,186
Yeah. Yeah.

541
00:37:36,015 --> 00:37:39,019
Phil, I really think we should go
to the American Consulate.

542
00:37:39,185 --> 00:37:41,938
For what? Report a dead body
we shoved into an ice machine?

543
00:37:42,105 --> 00:37:45,075
Are we gonna keep walking in circles?
That's real productive.

544
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:48,032
I'm trying to figure this out.
Your attitude is not helping.

545
00:37:48,194 --> 00:37:51,323
Well, I'm sorry. It's 100 degrees
and we don't have a plan.

546
00:37:51,489 --> 00:37:53,583
And all we've done is buy him hats
and sodas.

547
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:55,084
What? it's a bag of Fanta.

548
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:57,837
- All right, what do you wanna do, Stu?
- I don't know.

549
00:37:57,996 --> 00:38:00,590
- Then stop yelling at me like it's my fault.
- It is your fault!

550
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,589
All I wanted was a bachelor brunch.

551
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,924
Shit. Shut up, it's Doug. Talk to me.

552
00:38:06,212 --> 00:38:09,261
Just got off the phone with Bangkok P.D.
They got him. He's okay.

553
00:38:09,424 --> 00:38:12,598
Oh. Thank God. Doug found him.

554
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,433
- What happened?
- He got arrested.

555
00:38:14,595 --> 00:38:17,439
- Arrested? For what?
- Disorderly conduct.

556
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:19,771
- Seriously?
- Yeah. He's okay, though.

557
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:23,484
They'll release him to you, no questions
asked. No one here has to know.

558
00:38:23,646 --> 00:38:25,694
He's at the, uh...

559
00:38:26,858 --> 00:38:29,031
"Ratchawang Police Station."

560
00:38:29,193 --> 00:38:31,446
Okay. Okay,
I'll call you when we get there.

561
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:35,367
- Teddy's in jail, but fine. We gotta get a cab.
- Okay. All right.

562
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:43,124
- Yes, I have his paperwork here.
- Okay.

563
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:45,293
- He has been cleared.
- Sounds good.

564
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,258
- Of course.
- Thank you.

565
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,923
We're good, we're good.
They're processing for release.

566
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:53,972
Yeah, they threw him in the drunk tank.
He's fine.

567
00:38:54,177 --> 00:38:57,272
Sixteen years old, spent a night in jail.
Can you imagine?

568
00:38:58,765 --> 00:39:00,312
We love to party.

569
00:39:04,437 --> 00:39:06,235
Here we go.

570
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:09,325
- Wait, who's this fucking guy?
- Teddy Srisai.

571
00:39:09,484 --> 00:39:10,986
What...? No, no, no. I'm so...

572
00:39:11,152 --> 00:39:12,779
It's the wrong guy. Sir.

573
00:39:12,945 --> 00:39:14,993
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Uh, there's been a mistake.

574
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:17,830
He brought the wrong guy.
That's not Teddy.

575
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:20,836
Of course it is.
We have his IDs and everything.

576
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:24,503
These were in his pockets
when we made the arrest.

577
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:25,791
They were in his pocket?

578
00:39:27,835 --> 00:39:29,007
Excuse me, sir.

579
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:31,343
How did you get this stuff?

580
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:34,300
Hello?

581
00:39:34,759 --> 00:39:36,102
Teddy doesn't speak.

582
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,605
We tried English, Thai, Chinese.
Nothing.

583
00:39:39,764 --> 00:39:41,186
Let me ask you something.

584
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:45,820
Does he look like he works out at
Bally Total Fitness in Palo Alto, California?

585
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:49,531
Look, we arrest a lot of people.

586
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,864
We cannot analyze everything. All right?

587
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:55,200
Well, what do you expect us to do
with this guy?

588
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:56,489
Not my problem.

589
00:39:57,907 --> 00:39:59,284
Hey, guys?

590
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:01,703
I think he knows us.

591
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:03,542
Hi. Hello.

592
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:11,471
Do you know where our friend is?!
Teddy! He's missing!

593
00:40:11,629 --> 00:40:13,723
Stu, forget it. The guy's worthless.

594
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:17,226
He knows something.
He's wearing Teddy's sweatshirt.

595
00:40:18,594 --> 00:40:20,016
What if he just doesn't understand?

596
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:24,059
Uh, I'll act it out.
Yeah, like charades. Watch.

597
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:26,477
- Two words.
- Is it a movie?

598
00:40:27,061 --> 00:40:29,405
This is not for you, Alan.

599
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,569
American teenager in Asia.

600
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:36,863
Karate Kid with Jaden Smith.

601
00:40:37,572 --> 00:40:39,916
It's easy because
you were talking through it.

602
00:40:40,283 --> 00:40:41,830
Stu, it's a waste of time.

603
00:40:41,993 --> 00:40:43,916
Just leave this fucking guy here.

604
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:47,833
Oh, here's something. "There are
500,000 monks living in Thailand.

605
00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:52,095
It is not uncommon for some monks
to take a vow of silence...

606
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:55,598
at the age of 8."
- There you go.

607
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:58,475
- Is there anything else in that envelope?
- No, it's empty.

608
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:01,061
Whoa, hang on.

609
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,691
A drink card from White Lion Bar,
Bangkok?

610
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:08,361
Worth a shot.

611
00:41:09,979 --> 00:41:13,074
Jesus Christ. Is this the right street?

612
00:41:13,232 --> 00:41:14,449
That's what it says.

613
00:41:20,114 --> 00:41:23,789
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is the White Lion.

614
00:41:24,452 --> 00:41:26,125
What the fuck happened here?

615
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:28,631
Holy shit.

616
00:41:33,461 --> 00:41:36,556
- Oh, okay. Just keep walking. Yeah.
- Okay. Yeah, we should probably...

617
00:41:40,635 --> 00:41:41,978
- Ah!
- All right. it's okay.

618
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:44,476
What the fuck is going on here?

619
00:41:46,265 --> 00:41:49,144
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, check it out.

620
00:41:49,644 --> 00:41:52,898
Holy shit. Stu, look.

621
00:41:53,064 --> 00:41:54,486
That's my face.

622
00:41:54,649 --> 00:41:56,401
Go, go, go.

623
00:41:56,901 --> 00:41:58,323
Nice work, Alan.

624
00:42:00,488 --> 00:42:03,241
- Hello?
- Be with you in a minute.

625
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:08,796
Excuse me.

626
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,673
Oh, look who it is.

627
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,258
So, what do you think?

628
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:14,589
What? I'm sorry?

629
00:42:14,752 --> 00:42:16,754
The tattoo? You love it?

630
00:42:17,588 --> 00:42:19,761
Uh, no. Actually, I hate it.

631
00:42:19,924 --> 00:42:22,018
No refunds. Get the fuck out.

632
00:42:22,176 --> 00:42:24,099
- Wait a second.
- Read the sign.

633
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:28,857
We don't want a refund.
We just have a couple of questions.

634
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:31,144
Trying to figure out
what went down last night.

635
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,607
"What went down"?

636
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:35,489
Look what you did outside.
Half the neighborhood went down.

637
00:42:35,648 --> 00:42:36,695
We did that?

638
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:39,861
You don't remember getting into a bar fight
at the White Lion?

639
00:42:40,027 --> 00:42:41,779
Starting a full-on fucking riot?

640
00:42:41,946 --> 00:42:45,450
No, sir. We don't remember anything.

641
00:42:49,578 --> 00:42:52,923
Hold this. Oh, boy.

642
00:42:53,624 --> 00:42:55,547
Check this out.

643
00:42:59,714 --> 00:43:00,886
Holy shit.

644
00:43:04,677 --> 00:43:06,805
Fuck the police!

645
00:43:06,971 --> 00:43:08,723
Fuck the police!

646
00:43:12,101 --> 00:43:13,523
There's Teddy. He was with us.

647
00:43:28,117 --> 00:43:29,619
Jesus Christ.

648
00:43:29,785 --> 00:43:32,709
That's when the cops arrived,
started cracking skulls.

649
00:43:32,872 --> 00:43:35,170
I took you guys
and hid you in the shop here.

650
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:39,216
Then you decided to get a tattoo.
Cried like a little bitch.

651
00:43:40,046 --> 00:43:42,925
This kid's fucking 9 years old.
He's got balls twice your size.

652
00:43:43,424 --> 00:43:46,428
- Show him your balls, man.
- No, no, no. That's okay.

653
00:43:47,595 --> 00:43:50,599
Listen, we're looking for our friend Teddy.
Have you seen him?

654
00:43:51,015 --> 00:43:52,733
Not since last night. What happened?

655
00:43:52,892 --> 00:43:56,237
Yeah, I'm supposed to marry his sister
tomorrow and we kind of lost him.

656
00:43:57,104 --> 00:43:59,948
Oh, well. Then fuck it.

657
00:44:00,107 --> 00:44:01,575
What do you mean, "fuck it"?

658
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:06,447
Bangkok has him now
and she'll never let him go.

659
00:44:06,614 --> 00:44:08,287
You hear that? Huh?

660
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:10,417
- Is this what you wanted? Happy now?
- Phil.

661
00:44:10,576 --> 00:44:14,376
You're wasting your time.
These monks take their vow shit seriously.

662
00:44:14,538 --> 00:44:15,710
Look at this.

663
00:44:15,873 --> 00:44:18,922
That's the sign of the Chiang Mei
monastery just outside of town.

664
00:44:19,627 --> 00:44:21,925
Maybe somebody over there
can get him to talk.

665
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:30,430
Can we just go over this one more time?
You got the beer from...?

666
00:44:30,596 --> 00:44:32,815
The hotel bar.
They gave me a sealed case.

667
00:44:32,973 --> 00:44:35,943
- Right. But who gave it to you?
- The bartender.

668
00:44:36,102 --> 00:44:37,649
Right. Okay.

669
00:44:37,812 --> 00:44:39,985
And then you brought them out
and I opened them.

670
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:43,651
Yeah, and Doug had one and he was fine,
so it's not the beer.

671
00:44:43,984 --> 00:44:46,078
- So, what the hell happened?
- I have no idea.

672
00:44:46,237 --> 00:44:49,241
Hey, guys. Check it out,
he's got a Chinese boner.

673
00:44:49,407 --> 00:44:51,660
Alan, come on. Cut it out.

674
00:44:55,246 --> 00:44:57,089
The monkey is a pervert.

675
00:44:57,248 --> 00:44:59,125
Come on, that is so wrong.

676
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:02,010
Hey, don't stop, monkey, keep doing it.

677
00:45:09,677 --> 00:45:13,352
When a monkey nibbles on a penis,
it's funny in any language.

678
00:45:15,766 --> 00:45:17,689
Oh, keep doing it!

679
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:21,363
All right. Thank you.

680
00:45:21,522 --> 00:45:23,024
We good?

681
00:45:23,858 --> 00:45:27,078
Bye, Shannon. Bye, Lil Wayne.

682
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,122
Wow.

683
00:45:38,622 --> 00:45:40,875
So beautiful.

684
00:45:42,668 --> 00:45:45,091
What is this, a P.F. Chang's?

685
00:45:46,547 --> 00:45:48,925
Ah, they're meditating.

686
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,849
- Such a peaceful people.
- Yeah.

687
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:54,684
Knock, knock! Hello?!

688
00:45:54,847 --> 00:45:57,726
Alan, Alan, show some respect.
Don't get up, guys.

689
00:45:58,392 --> 00:46:00,645
We brought one of your guys back.

690
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:03,564
He's really funny.
He's really nice and cool.

691
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:07,451
Hi, how you doing?
Uh, are you the one in charge?

692
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:11,242
- Hey! Aah!
- Excuse me. Ow!

693
00:46:11,405 --> 00:46:12,657
- Wait! Ah!
- stop in

694
00:46:12,823 --> 00:46:14,575
Just calm down! Aah!

695
00:46:14,742 --> 00:46:15,834
Hold on! Ah!

696
00:46:15,993 --> 00:46:18,371
It's because" Ow! We're talking! Ah!

697
00:46:18,537 --> 00:46:20,710
Stop talking. Goddamn it!

698
00:46:20,873 --> 00:46:22,216
Don't! Stop!

699
00:46:22,374 --> 00:46:23,591
Wait! it's me!

700
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:24,877
Stop hitting me!

701
00:46:25,044 --> 00:46:26,091
Oh, I get it.

702
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:32,267
No talk. No talk.

703
00:46:32,551 --> 00:46:35,771
Shh. Okay. We no talk.

704
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:40,814
Okay.

705
00:46:40,976 --> 00:46:43,274
- Asshole.
- I get it, I get it.

706
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:06,545
Late last night, you climbed the walls
of our monastery...

707
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:12,467
shouting out question about love,
marriage and the meaning of life.

708
00:47:14,093 --> 00:47:19,395
Poor Brother Han was meditating alone
in the garden and you took him.

709
00:47:19,557 --> 00:47:22,060
Oh, my God.

710
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,403
We kidnapped a monk.

711
00:47:24,853 --> 00:47:27,072
Uh, we live an alternative lifestyle.

712
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:32,158
And we are so sorry about that,
but we weren't ourselves last night.

713
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,993
Yup, things kind of spun out
of control a little bit.

714
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:39,160
But there's a boy who's missing
and hurt.

715
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:41,704
Can you find out if he knows
where our friend is?

716
00:47:41,996 --> 00:47:45,125
Brother Han took a vow of silence
many years ago.

717
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:47,293
It would be useless to try.

718
00:47:47,459 --> 00:47:51,839
Well, maybe he can write down
what happened on a piece of paper.

719
00:47:52,006 --> 00:47:54,680
Actually, that would be cheating.
Right, Grand Wizard?

720
00:47:54,842 --> 00:47:57,686
- Alan.
- I'm afraid Fatty is right.

721
00:47:57,845 --> 00:47:59,847
See? What?

722
00:48:00,014 --> 00:48:03,439
None us will ever know what
Brother Han knows.

723
00:48:03,601 --> 00:48:04,853
Oh, all right.

724
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:08,148
So much for holy people.
Bunch of bald assholes. Come on, let's go.

725
00:48:08,314 --> 00:48:12,035
Hey, you know what? FYI, you may wanna
put some signs up that say "no talking"...

726
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:15,036
...before you unleash your dragon.
- Yeah, that was a little rough.

727
00:48:15,195 --> 00:48:19,450
You're welcome for bringing him back safe.
You know, we found him in a drunk tank.

728
00:48:19,617 --> 00:48:21,335
We did take him in the first place.

729
00:48:21,493 --> 00:48:23,291
Come on, guys, let's go.

730
00:48:24,121 --> 00:48:25,543
Wait.

731
00:48:26,415 --> 00:48:27,883
The Buddha teach:

732
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:31,845
Every memory lives somewhere
deep within.

733
00:48:32,254 --> 00:48:36,725
Perhaps you should bring your question
to the garden of meditation.

734
00:48:37,301 --> 00:48:39,770
- Did you understand a word he said?
- About two-thirds.

735
00:48:39,928 --> 00:48:41,896
Something about the garden
of meditation?

736
00:48:42,056 --> 00:48:44,980
No, he said he's farting
because of his medication.

737
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:46,560
I get that.

738
00:48:52,274 --> 00:48:55,369
This is a waste of time.
I don't remember anything.

739
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,538
Do you?

740
00:48:57,696 --> 00:49:00,324
No. I got nothing.

741
00:49:01,325 --> 00:49:02,793
Alan?

742
00:49:05,287 --> 00:49:06,504
Alan?

743
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:12,928
Every memory lives somewhere
deep within.

744
00:49:13,087 --> 00:49:14,930
- Sweetie?
- What?

745
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:16,762
You have visitors.

746
00:49:16,924 --> 00:49:18,767
- Hey, Alan.
- Hey, guys.

747
00:49:18,926 --> 00:49:20,599
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, buddy.

748
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:24,265
- Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.
- Is this true, Stuart?

749
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,688
Yeah, why not? it'll be fun.

750
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,438
- What the fuck?
- To Lauren and Stu.

751
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,948
Cheers.

752
00:49:35,025 --> 00:49:38,074
- Chow?
- We had a sick night, bitches!

753
00:49:38,612 --> 00:49:41,115
- Yeah!
- Alan, what the fuck?

754
00:49:42,616 --> 00:49:44,289
Is that person coming to the wedding?

755
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:45,828
There is no wolf pack.

756
00:49:45,994 --> 00:49:48,668
- Alan, don't do that!
- "The population in Thailand is..."

757
00:49:48,831 --> 00:49:52,301
And we're the three best friends
That anybody could have

758
00:49:57,548 --> 00:49:58,640
Hey!

759
00:50:00,926 --> 00:50:04,305
Yeah! Fuck the police! Fuck the police!

760
00:50:16,608 --> 00:50:18,360
I know where to go.

761
00:50:21,155 --> 00:50:23,157
What do you think, Alan?

762
00:50:23,323 --> 00:50:25,325
Uh, this is the place.

763
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:26,789
Come on, let's go.

764
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:34,419
I don't remember any of this.

765
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,008
Yeah, Alan,
are you sure this is the place?

766
00:50:37,171 --> 00:50:39,173
Yeah, pretty sure.

767
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:48,607
Bros, finally!

768
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:51,440
Is he coming or what?
I've been waiting all day for him.

769
00:50:51,894 --> 00:50:53,862
Uh, I'm sorry. Waiting for who?

770
00:50:54,021 --> 00:50:55,614
Chow, that dick-ass fuck.

771
00:50:57,357 --> 00:50:59,530
- Why, what's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

772
00:50:59,693 --> 00:51:01,491
Okay, good. Look at this.

773
00:51:01,653 --> 00:51:04,532
Look what I bring for him.
Check it out, huh? Huh?

774
00:51:05,032 --> 00:51:07,706
- No, no, no.
- $6000, American.

775
00:51:07,868 --> 00:51:09,962
Wow, it looks so real.

776
00:51:16,001 --> 00:51:18,299
Sorry. Ahem. Sorry.

777
00:51:18,462 --> 00:51:19,964
Alan! What the fuck?!

778
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:23,885
It's okay! it's okay.
The gun, very sensitive. Very sensitive.

779
00:51:24,051 --> 00:51:25,894
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah, okay.

780
00:51:26,053 --> 00:51:29,307
Okay? Then get the fuck back to work!

781
00:51:29,473 --> 00:51:30,690
Come on! Music, please!

782
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:33,527
Who has my $6000?

783
00:51:33,685 --> 00:51:37,485
No, no, no. That's Chow's deal.
We got nothing to do with that.

784
00:51:37,648 --> 00:51:39,400
Un-fucking-believable, man.

785
00:51:39,566 --> 00:51:43,616
This guy, if he backs out again,
this shit is gonna catch up to him, okay?

786
00:51:43,779 --> 00:51:47,079
He's made a lot of enemies in this town
and now they're your enemies.

787
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:48,367
That's not fair!

788
00:51:48,534 --> 00:51:51,208
Okay, listen.
We're just looking for a little kid.

789
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:53,088
- Two thousand dollars.
- What?!

790
00:51:53,247 --> 00:51:56,091
I don't know. Maybe more.
How young you want this kid to be?

791
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,254
No! No, no, no. Sorry.
You misunderstood.

792
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:03,765
We're looking for our friend,
16 years old, Teddy?

793
00:52:03,924 --> 00:52:06,598
Teddy?
Yeah, he was here with you guys last night.

794
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,683
He was?
You remember if he left with us?

795
00:52:08,846 --> 00:52:12,396
You were in the corner all night
with Kimmy. I didn't see you leave.

796
00:52:12,558 --> 00:52:14,401
Kimmy? Kimmy? Is she here?

797
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,780
Yeah, she's in the back.
She just came for her shift. Go talk to her.

798
00:52:18,438 --> 00:52:20,987
Listen, I'm sorry about everything
that happened.

799
00:52:21,149 --> 00:52:23,322
Pay attention what
I'm gonna talk to you now.

800
00:52:23,485 --> 00:52:27,740
When you see Chow,
you tell him Samir says hello.

801
00:52:27,906 --> 00:52:29,874
- Okay.
- But do it like that, okay?

802
00:52:30,033 --> 00:52:31,956
Hello. Like threatening.

803
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:33,416
Like ironic.

804
00:52:33,787 --> 00:52:35,755
- Hello.
- Okay.

805
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:39,881
- Hello.
- Hello.

806
00:52:40,043 --> 00:52:42,421
- Hello.
- More O. Hello.

807
00:52:42,588 --> 00:52:43,635
Hello.

808
00:52:43,797 --> 00:52:46,391
Go away, go away.
Fucking make me crazy.

809
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,600
Of course I remember him.
He was buying shots for everyone.

810
00:52:50,762 --> 00:52:54,141
Nice kid. His parents must be so proud.

811
00:52:54,308 --> 00:52:55,730
Yeah. You have no idea.

812
00:52:56,393 --> 00:52:58,395
Okay, so do you remember
if he left with us?

813
00:52:58,562 --> 00:53:02,942
Yeah, you all were leaving together,
but you almost forgot this one right here.

814
00:53:03,108 --> 00:53:05,531
- Right, superstar?
- Hmm.

815
00:53:05,694 --> 00:53:10,074
This one was following me around
like a little puppy dog all night.

816
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,460
Saying how he fall in love with me
and ask me to marry him.

817
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:16,921
Classic Stu.

818
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:20,918
- We didn't get married, did we?
- Of course not.

819
00:53:21,084 --> 00:53:23,086
We just had some fun
in the Chardonnay Room.

820
00:53:23,545 --> 00:53:25,764
What, uh... What happens
in the Chardonnay Room?

821
00:53:25,923 --> 00:53:27,846
Let's just stay on task here.

822
00:53:28,008 --> 00:53:30,852
Oh, you know. Dance for him.
He tickle me. We had sex.

823
00:53:31,011 --> 00:53:33,139
- I massage his shoulders.
- Fuck!

824
00:53:33,305 --> 00:53:35,683
It's okay. You're not married yet.
It's no big deal.

825
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:37,977
It's cheating, okay?

826
00:53:38,143 --> 00:53:42,444
No offense to you. You're a lovely woman.
It's a violation of my moral code.

827
00:53:42,606 --> 00:53:45,280
Don't be sad. Stu, you love it.

828
00:53:45,442 --> 00:53:48,116
You were crying,
saying how special it was.

829
00:53:48,278 --> 00:53:50,201
Wait. Ha, ha. I'm sorry, he was crying?

830
00:53:50,364 --> 00:53:51,707
What a baby. He was crying.

831
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:55,961
You should have seen him.
He was so sexy, the way he move around.

832
00:53:56,662 --> 00:53:59,461
I had to ask him slow down
so I don't drop my load too quick.

833
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:04,052
Load? What load?

834
00:54:04,211 --> 00:54:06,885
Oh, you know. My sperms.

835
00:54:08,215 --> 00:54:11,810
Eh, I think your English is off.
You're talking about my sperms.

836
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:14,517
Where would your sperm come from?

837
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,057
From my balls.

838
00:54:16,223 --> 00:54:17,520
Hold on. Back up.

839
00:54:17,683 --> 00:54:20,232
Wait, wait. Are you...?

840
00:54:20,394 --> 00:54:22,863
Hey. You in Bangkok, sweetie.

841
00:54:23,021 --> 00:54:25,069
There's a reason
they don't call it Bangcunt.

842
00:54:25,232 --> 00:54:26,825
Oh!

843
00:54:31,071 --> 00:54:32,573
Oh, my God.

844
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:34,958
Wow.

845
00:54:36,576 --> 00:54:39,170
I don't get it. Is this a magic show?

846
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:44,423
Come on, Stu. It was beautiful.
We climaxed at the same time.

847
00:54:45,127 --> 00:54:46,674
How's that work?

848
00:54:46,837 --> 00:54:49,932
Shoot my load into you,
you shoot your load on the floor.

849
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:52,434
- Okay.
- You shot your load in me?

850
00:54:52,926 --> 00:54:54,098
In my bottom?

851
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:57,306
Oh, God.

852
00:55:04,563 --> 00:55:07,282
Stu, it's not the end of the world.

853
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:09,614
I'm sorry, but I am so confused.

854
00:55:11,069 --> 00:55:13,948
I made love to a man with boobies.

855
00:55:14,114 --> 00:55:17,789
Listen, I promise you no one's ever
gonna find out about this.

856
00:55:17,951 --> 00:55:19,453
But we just found out about it.

857
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:21,917
And then we forget. That's what we do.

858
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,959
I've done so much fucked up shit,
and I just forget about it.

859
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:28,755
- You have?
- Yeah. You just forget. It goes away.

860
00:55:29,963 --> 00:55:32,967
That might be harder to go away,
but in time it'll happen.

861
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:34,976
That's what I'm gonna do.

862
00:55:35,761 --> 00:55:37,308
I'm just gonna forget about it.

863
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,973
- Never happened.
- Right.

864
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:42,977
Phone. Phone. Who is it? Answer.

865
00:55:43,143 --> 00:55:44,645
Lauren's dad.

866
00:55:44,811 --> 00:55:46,108
It just reminded me.

867
00:55:46,271 --> 00:55:47,818
- Answer it.
- I can't.

868
00:55:47,981 --> 00:55:50,734
He might know something about Teddy.
We still have a shot.

869
00:55:50,901 --> 00:55:54,781
- I can't.
- Get your head back into the fucking game.

870
00:55:59,493 --> 00:56:01,837
- Hello?
- Who takes an all-day fishing trip...

871
00:56:01,995 --> 00:56:03,793
the day before a wedding?

872
00:56:03,955 --> 00:56:07,300
Yeah, ha, ha.
I guess it was kind of stupid.

873
00:56:07,459 --> 00:56:09,006
Put Teddy on the phone.

874
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:14,091
- Uh, Teddy's seasick, actually.
- Seasick?

875
00:56:14,257 --> 00:56:16,931
Teddy's been a maritime deck cadet
since he was 9.

876
00:56:17,094 --> 00:56:19,517
Well, that's weird,
because he's puking everywhere.

877
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:22,774
I'm gonna tell you something
that you did not know.

878
00:56:22,933 --> 00:56:24,310
I don't like you.

879
00:56:24,476 --> 00:56:27,150
- Yeah, I knew that already.
- My daughter chooses you...

880
00:56:27,312 --> 00:56:29,314
that's her problem.
- Hey, it's Phil Winnick.

881
00:56:29,481 --> 00:56:32,735
Listen, I apologize. We've been reeling in
some crazy marlin, and I just want...

882
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,367
- Phil!
- Phil!

883
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:37,531
Jesus.

884
00:56:37,697 --> 00:56:39,791
- Phil? You're okay.
- Fuck me.

885
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:41,202
Give us back our monkey.

886
00:56:41,368 --> 00:56:42,995
What monkey? Get your own monkey!

887
00:56:43,411 --> 00:56:45,539
Come on, you asshole.
The fucking monkey.

888
00:56:46,206 --> 00:56:47,549
Come on.

889
00:56:47,707 --> 00:56:49,835
Any time, Alan. He's pointing a gun at us.

890
00:56:50,001 --> 00:56:51,344
This is our monkey.

891
00:56:51,503 --> 00:56:55,133
Alan, no one's getting shot over
a fucking monkey. Hand him over now.

892
00:56:55,298 --> 00:56:58,472
Oh, God, I never get to keep no monkeys.

893
00:57:03,056 --> 00:57:05,434
Hey, check it out.
He's got a banana on his helmet.

894
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,898
- These guys are the real deal.
- What's happening?

895
00:57:08,061 --> 00:57:11,065
Hold on. How did this happen?
Do you know where our friend is?

896
00:57:11,231 --> 00:57:14,075
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, 16 years old, Asian kid?

897
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,243
No, I don't understand what he said.

898
00:57:18,738 --> 00:57:20,832
What did he say? What did he say?!

899
00:57:20,991 --> 00:57:23,665
He said, "Fuck you and your question."

900
00:57:25,537 --> 00:57:26,914
Oh, my arm!

901
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,253
Poor Phil! Phil, are you okay?

902
00:57:29,749 --> 00:57:33,629
Oh, I got shot. Fuck! Fuck, guys.

903
00:57:33,795 --> 00:57:38,096
It's all right, Phil. We'll figure this all out
and get the monkey back. I promise.

904
00:57:38,258 --> 00:57:40,226
No one gives a fuck
about the monkey, Alan!

905
00:57:40,385 --> 00:57:42,604
Oh, shit, look at my arm.

906
00:57:42,762 --> 00:57:45,606
What the fuck is going on?!

907
00:57:45,765 --> 00:57:48,359
Stu, am I gonna be okay?
You're a doctor.

908
00:57:48,518 --> 00:57:51,237
I don't know. Let me look, let me look.

909
00:57:52,772 --> 00:57:54,445
What? What?

910
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:56,110
Stu, come here. No, look at it.

911
00:57:56,276 --> 00:57:59,450
Stuart Price, get your ass back over here!

912
00:57:59,613 --> 00:58:01,035
- You got shot!
- I know!

913
00:58:17,631 --> 00:58:19,679
- Hey.
- Yo. You all right?

914
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:21,593
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

915
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,357
Actually, bullet just grazed my arm.
Eight stitches.

916
00:58:26,848 --> 00:58:28,976
Only cost $6. How's that even possible?

917
00:58:29,142 --> 00:58:31,941
How's any of this even possible?

918
00:58:35,357 --> 00:58:38,156
I mean, if I was a foot to my left,
Stu, I'd be dead.

919
00:58:40,987 --> 00:58:42,660
What are we gonna do?

920
00:58:47,869 --> 00:58:50,338
I'm sorry, guys.
This wasn't part of the plan.

921
00:58:52,207 --> 00:58:54,005
What plan, Alan?

922
00:58:55,293 --> 00:58:56,920
I've said too much already.

923
00:59:05,011 --> 00:59:08,015
Alan, what plan?

924
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:11,359
This is all Teddy's fault.

925
00:59:11,518 --> 00:59:13,020
What are you talking about, Alan?

926
00:59:13,186 --> 00:59:15,359
Why is he here?
He's not part of the wolf pack.

927
00:59:15,522 --> 00:59:18,366
Alan, what did you do?

928
00:59:18,525 --> 00:59:21,654
It's not my fault. Teddy shouldn't have
been sharing from his bag.

929
00:59:23,363 --> 00:59:24,455
What bag?

930
00:59:24,614 --> 00:59:27,709
The marshmallows.
I had a separate bag just for Teddy.

931
00:59:27,867 --> 00:59:31,371
But it was dark, it was hard to keep track,
and then you almost sat on them.

932
00:59:31,538 --> 00:59:33,882
I couldn't tell which was which.
It was mayhem.

933
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,088
What did you do to the marshmallows,
Alan?

934
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:39,004
Alan? What did you do?

935
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:42,925
Well, isn't it obvious?
I spiked them with muscle relaxers.

936
00:59:43,091 --> 00:59:45,389
And, plus, my ADHD medication.

937
00:59:45,552 --> 00:59:47,520
- What?!
- You drugged us again?!

938
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:51,354
Not you. I just wanted to knock out Teddy
so we could enjoy the weekend.

939
00:59:51,516 --> 00:59:56,192
"Enjoy the weekend"'? Alan, you told me
that you didn't do anything.

940
00:59:56,354 --> 00:59:58,027
Alan, you swore to God.

941
00:59:58,189 --> 01:00:00,442
I just wanted things to stay the same.

942
01:00:00,608 --> 01:00:02,781
Look at my face!

943
01:00:03,069 --> 01:00:04,571
You ruined my life!

944
01:00:05,113 --> 01:00:06,160
You're not my friend.

945
01:00:06,323 --> 01:00:09,076
Don't say that, Phil. Are you serious?
Even in America?

946
01:00:09,242 --> 01:00:13,088
- Yes!
- Oh, God. Don't say that, Phil.

947
01:00:13,246 --> 01:00:14,589
Don't start crying, Alan.

948
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:16,250
You're the bearded devil!

949
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:19,545
You liked it. You smiled at me when
I held up the marshmallows.

950
01:00:19,961 --> 01:00:23,591
Because I like marshmallows,
you fucking psycho!

951
01:00:24,341 --> 01:00:27,561
Hey! Whoa, whoa, hold on! Stop!

952
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:29,266
- Guys, guys. Enough.
- Why?!

953
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:31,602
Why, Alan?! Why?!

954
01:00:32,057 --> 01:00:34,606
Because we're the three best friends,
remember?

955
01:00:34,934 --> 01:00:36,436
Remember?

956
01:00:36,603 --> 01:00:39,777
Stu, that's enough. That's enough.

957
01:00:39,939 --> 01:00:41,407
Fuck.

958
01:00:42,984 --> 01:00:45,783
Guys, we can't fall apart now.
We gotta stick together.

959
01:00:51,451 --> 01:00:55,752
- Alan, what's that written on your belly?
- What? Huh?

960
01:00:55,914 --> 01:00:59,794
"Lebua Hotel. Saturday, 6 p.m."
Did you write that?

961
01:00:59,959 --> 01:01:01,381
No.

962
01:01:03,004 --> 01:01:05,052
Shit, that's in 20 minutes.

963
01:01:05,507 --> 01:01:07,384
What about England?
Are we friends there?

964
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:09,803
I told you,
it was in the heat of the moment.

965
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:12,973
We're still friends, all over the world.

966
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:15,858
- Even Great Britain?
- Yeah. Mm-hm.

967
01:01:17,811 --> 01:01:19,734
Well, what about you, Stu?

968
01:01:20,688 --> 01:01:22,281
We'll see.

969
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,902
Gentlemen, follow me.

970
01:01:28,988 --> 01:01:30,035
All right.

971
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:41,172
Here you go.

972
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,297
Well.

973
01:01:46,214 --> 01:01:48,808
It's about time. Sit down.

974
01:01:48,967 --> 01:01:50,935
- Come on, sit, sit, sit.
- Okay.

975
01:01:51,302 --> 01:01:53,430
Wow, you guys look like shit.

976
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:58,770
- Uh, do we know you?
- Hey.

977
01:01:58,935 --> 01:02:02,155
Take off your fucking hat.
You're in a restaurant, for chrissake.

978
01:02:07,026 --> 01:02:09,870
Okay, listen. Uh,
we have no clue what's going on here.

979
01:02:10,029 --> 01:02:14,159
You know, they sell a plum whiskey here.
It's fucking unreal.

980
01:02:14,325 --> 01:02:17,169
Seriously, it will absolutely fuck you up.

981
01:02:18,538 --> 01:02:21,542
Oh, I'm sorry, you guys already
got fucked up, didn't you?

982
01:02:23,084 --> 01:02:26,008
Uh, listen. I'm a little confused.
How did you...?

983
01:02:26,171 --> 01:02:28,720
Yeah, you know what?
I'm a little fucking confused.

984
01:02:28,882 --> 01:02:29,883
Where's Chow?!

985
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:35,852
Where is Chow with the fucking account
code and the fucking password?!

986
01:02:41,227 --> 01:02:46,529
We don't know anything about any codes.
We're just trying to find our friend.

987
01:02:49,402 --> 01:02:52,326
- Teddy.
- Yes. Teddy.

988
01:02:52,489 --> 01:02:53,581
Have you seen him?

989
01:02:55,074 --> 01:02:56,576
Come here.

990
01:02:56,743 --> 01:02:59,997
Hmm. Let's see. Oh.

991
01:03:00,788 --> 01:03:01,914
There's Teddy.

992
01:03:03,249 --> 01:03:06,879
- Holy shit. it's from last night.
- Hmm.

993
01:03:08,213 --> 01:03:09,840
Who are you?

994
01:03:10,006 --> 01:03:11,303
I'm a businessman...

995
01:03:11,466 --> 01:03:14,845
and I have invested a large chunk
of capital in your friend Chow.

996
01:03:15,845 --> 01:03:19,520
And in return, he was supposed
to transfer our profits electronically...

997
01:03:19,682 --> 01:03:23,027
about five fucking minutes ago.

998
01:03:23,895 --> 01:03:27,570
So last night,
we took Teddy as insurance.

999
01:03:28,483 --> 01:03:30,906
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

1000
01:03:31,319 --> 01:03:33,617
Oh, my God. I wasn't done talking.

1001
01:03:34,864 --> 01:03:36,707
You tell Chow...

1002
01:03:36,866 --> 01:03:41,542
that we are having breakfast on the roof
of this hotel tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.

1003
01:03:41,704 --> 01:03:43,957
Now, if he makes the transfer,
you will get Teddy.

1004
01:03:44,123 --> 01:03:48,219
If not, well, then, hey, you know?
It's Bangkok.

1005
01:03:50,421 --> 01:03:52,423
That's your cue to get the fuck
out of here.

1006
01:03:59,264 --> 01:04:00,891
Hey, you know what? Leave the hat.

1007
01:04:02,809 --> 01:04:04,231
Alan, leave the hat.

1008
01:04:06,312 --> 01:04:07,985
Attaboy.

1009
01:04:17,824 --> 01:04:20,998
We're fucked. Chow's dead.
What do we do now?

1010
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,540
The guy doesn't give a shit about Chow.
This whole thing's about a bank account.

1011
01:04:27,292 --> 01:04:29,670
Let's just go back to the hotel,
Search Chow's body.

1012
01:04:29,836 --> 01:04:32,589
And hopefully the password's
in his wallet or something.

1013
01:04:33,131 --> 01:04:35,509
What if it isn't?
I mean, they're gonna kill Teddy.

1014
01:04:35,675 --> 01:04:40,272
Just relax. We have until 8 a.m.
tomorrow to figure it out.

1015
01:04:42,974 --> 01:04:45,568
First the monkey, now my hat.

1016
01:04:45,852 --> 01:04:48,446
How much worse can this day get?

1017
01:04:51,858 --> 01:04:54,031
Jesus Christ.

1018
01:05:01,242 --> 01:05:05,839
Well, we're living here in Alantown

1019
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:11,546
And he's driven our lives into the ground

1020
01:05:12,378 --> 01:05:16,428
When we woke up
We were wasted and drunk

1021
01:05:16,591 --> 01:05:18,764
Phil got shot

1022
01:05:18,926 --> 01:05:22,806
We got beaten by a monk

1023
01:05:24,849 --> 01:05:28,945
I was happy, and my life was good

1024
01:05:30,063 --> 01:05:34,409
Getting married like a dentist should

1025
01:05:34,567 --> 01:05:38,538
Roasting marshmallows on a stick

1026
01:05:38,696 --> 01:05:41,575
I got fucked in the ass

1027
01:05:41,741 --> 01:05:44,460
By a girl with a dick

1028
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:48,123
I remember that.

1029
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:54,676
And we 're living here in Alantown

1030
01:05:57,006 --> 01:05:59,008
There's water everywhere.

1031
01:05:59,384 --> 01:06:02,183
Yeah, that's because it melted, Stu.
The fucking power's out.

1032
01:06:02,345 --> 01:06:05,349
"With an inadequate electrical grid
serving millions of people...

1033
01:06:05,515 --> 01:06:08,439
Bangkok experiences
1500 power outages per year."

1034
01:06:08,601 --> 01:06:10,444
Seriously, Alan, that's enough.

1035
01:06:10,937 --> 01:06:12,655
Out of the way.

1036
01:06:18,945 --> 01:06:20,413
We got it.

1037
01:06:22,532 --> 01:06:24,455
Ghost! There's a ghost!

1038
01:06:25,618 --> 01:06:27,791
Motherfucker!

1039
01:06:28,329 --> 01:06:31,754
Chow, calm down! Chow, calm down!

1040
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:34,711
- Fucking kill on me!
- No, no, no. Ah.

1041
01:06:37,547 --> 01:06:39,299
It's okay.

1042
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:41,138
Relax.

1043
01:06:43,928 --> 01:06:46,226
- Shh.
- Shh.

1044
01:06:49,809 --> 01:06:53,655
That's it. it's just us. Breathe.

1045
01:06:53,813 --> 01:06:56,066
- Chow so cold.
- I'm gonna warm you up.

1046
01:06:56,232 --> 01:06:58,826
Chow so cold. Chow so cold.

1047
01:06:58,985 --> 01:07:01,329
You did good, buddy. You did good.

1048
01:07:01,487 --> 01:07:02,739
Chow did good.

1049
01:07:08,244 --> 01:07:09,917
Feeling better?

1050
01:07:10,663 --> 01:07:12,290
You all right? You warm enough?

1051
01:07:12,707 --> 01:07:15,381
I don't know.
Come feel my balls and tell me.

1052
01:07:15,543 --> 01:07:19,173
I've been locked
in a fucking ice box all day.

1053
01:07:19,422 --> 01:07:23,017
Hey, Alan, you want my awesome
sunglasses, you just ask Chow.

1054
01:07:23,176 --> 01:07:24,849
You don't have to kill me.

1055
01:07:25,011 --> 01:07:28,982
Chow, nobody killed you. You were
already dead. You didn't have a pulse.

1056
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,892
Oh, you never do blow before?

1057
01:07:31,058 --> 01:07:34,437
Sometime your heart stop, start up again.
Read a book.

1058
01:07:35,021 --> 01:07:36,864
Look, I'm sorry.
We're just having a bad day.

1059
01:07:37,023 --> 01:07:40,368
Oh, you having a bad day? Did you die?

1060
01:07:41,235 --> 01:07:42,361
I got shot.

1061
01:07:42,528 --> 01:07:44,030
But did you die?

1062
01:07:44,197 --> 01:07:48,247
Chow, some guy told us that
you've got a bank code or something...

1063
01:07:48,409 --> 01:07:52,960
and if we don't bring it to him first thing
in the morning, he's gonna kill Teddy.

1064
01:07:53,122 --> 01:07:56,046
Who, Kingsley? Pfft. He harmless.

1065
01:07:56,209 --> 01:07:59,634
Don't worry. I got the bank codes.

1066
01:08:00,379 --> 01:08:03,303
Great. All right,
we gotta meet him at 8 a.m.

1067
01:08:03,466 --> 01:08:05,184
Who is that fucking guy, anyway?

1068
01:08:05,343 --> 01:08:06,890
Invest in my business.

1069
01:08:07,345 --> 01:08:08,767
Yeah? What business is that?

1070
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:12,104
It's called Not Your Business, okay?

1071
01:08:12,558 --> 01:08:14,401
So where's the monkey?

1072
01:08:14,852 --> 01:08:16,069
- The monkey?
- Yeah.

1073
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:20,575
I stashed the account number
and password in his vest. Where is he?

1074
01:08:22,568 --> 01:08:26,038
- Why would you do that?
- Safekeeping, pretty boy.

1075
01:08:26,197 --> 01:08:28,245
I got a lot of heat on my ass.

1076
01:08:28,407 --> 01:08:33,504
I got FBI, Bangkok P.D.,
Interpol, MSNBC.

1077
01:08:34,121 --> 01:08:36,249
That monkey snorting coke
with me all night...

1078
01:08:36,415 --> 01:08:38,964
jerking me off while
I watch Stu fuck with ladyboy.

1079
01:08:39,544 --> 01:08:41,546
- Ugh.
- He not going anywhere.

1080
01:08:41,712 --> 01:08:43,259
We don't have the monkey, Chow.

1081
01:08:43,422 --> 01:08:46,221
No, some Russian thugs
took him from us.

1082
01:08:46,384 --> 01:08:48,261
Oh, you fucking guys.

1083
01:08:49,262 --> 01:08:51,185
Okay, no problem.

1084
01:08:51,347 --> 01:08:53,395
We just have to get him back.

1085
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:56,444
- From where?
- Same place we took him from.

1086
01:09:17,957 --> 01:09:20,210
This monkey isn't just normal monkey.

1087
01:09:33,306 --> 01:09:36,651
Think of him like monkey drug mule.

1088
01:09:37,685 --> 01:09:40,609
He take coke to buyer...

1089
01:09:43,065 --> 01:09:44,612
and deliver cash to dealer.

1090
01:09:45,484 --> 01:09:47,407
He middleman.

1091
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:50,414
Dealer never handle drug directly.

1092
01:09:50,573 --> 01:09:51,745
He clean.

1093
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:55,127
That's terrible.

1094
01:09:55,286 --> 01:09:58,506
Not terrible. What you talking about?
It's fucking genius.

1095
01:09:58,664 --> 01:10:01,383
You ever see monkey go to jail?

1096
01:10:02,418 --> 01:10:04,796
We just signal monkey for deal,
he come close...

1097
01:10:04,962 --> 01:10:07,465
we take his vest and that's that.

1098
01:10:07,632 --> 01:10:10,010
Maybe get some blow too.
You know, just bump.

1099
01:10:10,176 --> 01:10:11,598
No. No more bumps, Chow.

1100
01:10:14,138 --> 01:10:16,015
Okay, this is ridiculous.

1101
01:10:18,392 --> 01:10:20,690
Stu, Mr. Chow can't whistle.
Signal monkey.

1102
01:10:33,282 --> 01:10:35,876
- All right, here we go.
- Come on.

1103
01:10:40,831 --> 01:10:42,833
How'd we wind up with the monkey
last night?

1104
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,050
Well, I needed some blow and
Alan thought he was cute, so we stole him.

1105
01:10:59,433 --> 01:11:00,810
So stupid.

1106
01:11:00,977 --> 01:11:02,320
Stu, ready to grab vest?

1107
01:11:02,645 --> 01:11:05,694
I... Okay. I just grab it?

1108
01:11:05,856 --> 01:11:08,484
- Yeah, just do it, Stu. Just do it.
- Hey, monkey!

1109
01:11:08,651 --> 01:11:10,369
- Alan, shh.
- Hi.

1110
01:11:13,489 --> 01:11:15,912
- Fuck!
- We gotta go right now.

1111
01:11:17,576 --> 01:11:19,044
Pull that fucking monkey in!

1112
01:11:19,203 --> 01:11:20,375
I'm trying!

1113
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:26,085
Aah! Fuck!

1114
01:11:29,922 --> 01:11:31,424
Get that monkey in here, Stu!

1115
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:33,843
He won't let go!

1116
01:11:34,093 --> 01:11:35,891
Stu, get back in the car right now!

1117
01:11:36,846 --> 01:11:39,850
I'm trying! Slow down!

1118
01:11:45,354 --> 01:11:47,072
He's so strong!

1119
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:52,236
Let go, you fucking monkey!

1120
01:11:53,779 --> 01:11:55,281
- Look out!
- Aah!

1121
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:57,121
Oh, shit. Tight squeeze.

1122
01:11:59,452 --> 01:12:02,581
I got him! I got him!

1123
01:12:04,832 --> 01:12:07,426
- Where's the code, Chow?
- Check his little vest.

1124
01:12:11,255 --> 01:12:13,223
- You got it, Alan?
- Yeah, I got it, Phil.

1125
01:12:13,382 --> 01:12:16,602
- Slow down, slow down, Chow!
- Hold on, gay boys!

1126
01:12:20,473 --> 01:12:22,396
- Holy shit!
- Fuck.

1127
01:12:23,768 --> 01:12:25,486
Don't worry, I got this shit.

1128
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,527
Pig!

1129
01:12:33,402 --> 01:12:34,449
Oh, my word!

1130
01:12:34,612 --> 01:12:36,489
Ha, ha. Sorry, Stu. My bad.

1131
01:12:42,411 --> 01:12:43,503
Oh, shit.

1132
01:12:44,997 --> 01:12:46,169
Get down!

1133
01:12:46,332 --> 01:12:47,629
What the fuck?!

1134
01:12:49,085 --> 01:12:51,679
Oh, no! They shot the monkey!

1135
01:12:52,546 --> 01:12:54,514
They shot the monkey!

1136
01:12:54,673 --> 01:12:56,266
I'm at my wits' end!

1137
01:12:59,178 --> 01:13:00,976
He's coming back around.

1138
01:13:02,014 --> 01:13:03,061
Look out!

1139
01:13:07,186 --> 01:13:09,484
- Holy fuck.
- Oh, no.

1140
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:31,469
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah.

1141
01:13:31,627 --> 01:13:35,632
Whoo! I have such an erection right now.

1142
01:13:39,593 --> 01:13:41,561
Are you for real?

1143
01:13:45,683 --> 01:13:46,809
Shh.

1144
01:13:46,976 --> 01:13:50,401
It's okay. it's okay. it's okay.

1145
01:13:52,314 --> 01:13:53,987
It's okay.

1146
01:13:55,734 --> 01:13:58,157
They're gonna take good care
of you here, okay?

1147
01:14:00,573 --> 01:14:01,620
What's that?

1148
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,162
Oh, yeah. Of course.

1149
01:14:06,328 --> 01:14:09,081
Cigarettes, got them right here.
Here you go.

1150
01:14:13,544 --> 01:14:14,921
There you go.

1151
01:14:17,923 --> 01:14:20,221
Deep breath.

1152
01:14:20,384 --> 01:14:22,102
Good. Good.

1153
01:14:22,261 --> 01:14:24,764
Smoke it in.

1154
01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:27,433
Breathe the smoke
into your tiny little lungs.

1155
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,943
There you go.

1156
01:14:29,518 --> 01:14:32,237
It's funny. I've never been
much of a smoker...

1157
01:14:33,606 --> 01:14:35,700
but, boy, does it look cool on you.

1158
01:14:35,858 --> 01:14:38,361
Alan! Come on, let's go!

1159
01:14:41,822 --> 01:14:43,540
I'm gonna miss you, monkey.

1160
01:14:46,577 --> 01:14:48,955
I wish monkeys could Skype.

1161
01:14:50,623 --> 01:14:52,125
Maybe one day.

1162
01:15:00,925 --> 01:15:02,598
- Come on, get in.
- Scoot over.

1163
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,730
- Oh, we gotta go see Kingsley.
- He's gonna be fine.

1164
01:15:21,111 --> 01:15:24,081
If I could save time in a bottle

1165
01:15:24,865 --> 01:15:28,995
The first thing that I'd like to do

1166
01:15:29,995 --> 01:15:32,373
Is to save every day

1167
01:15:32,831 --> 01:15:36,256
Till eternity passes away

1168
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:38,337
Just to spend them with you

1169
01:15:38,545 --> 01:15:40,388
Are you guys seriously this calm?

1170
01:15:40,547 --> 01:15:43,300
Relax, Stuart. It's classic switcheroo.

1171
01:15:43,467 --> 01:15:45,595
I give him money, he gives us Teddy.

1172
01:15:45,761 --> 01:15:48,139
Ever do anything that doesn't
end up in a standoff?

1173
01:15:48,305 --> 01:15:51,559
I'm an international criminal.
It always ends like this.

1174
01:15:51,725 --> 01:15:53,443
I met my wife at one of these things.

1175
01:15:54,853 --> 01:15:56,196
You have a wife?

1176
01:15:56,355 --> 01:15:58,653
Yeah. We married 15 years.

1177
01:15:58,816 --> 01:16:01,945
What, Chow not good-looking enough
for woman?

1178
01:16:02,611 --> 01:16:03,783
No, that's cool.

1179
01:16:06,073 --> 01:16:07,916
- Let's do this.
- Welcome to the Tower Club.

1180
01:16:08,075 --> 01:16:10,749
Blah, blah, blah. Who cares?

1181
01:16:11,161 --> 01:16:14,335
- it's okay.
- Stop. Chow crossing.

1182
01:16:18,002 --> 01:16:19,379
Hey, Kingsley.

1183
01:16:19,545 --> 01:16:21,798
- Well, well.
- Propecia looking nice.

1184
01:16:23,215 --> 01:16:24,717
Whew, you been hitting the gym?

1185
01:16:25,217 --> 01:16:28,391
Yes, I am, actually.
Thank you for noticing, Chow.

1186
01:16:28,554 --> 01:16:30,932
Hey, guys, have a seat.

1187
01:16:31,307 --> 01:16:32,399
Where's Teddy?

1188
01:16:32,558 --> 01:16:35,232
He's waiting downstairs in my car.
We'll send him up...

1189
01:16:35,394 --> 01:16:37,897
...when the transfer is complete.
- Tell you what:

1190
01:16:38,063 --> 01:16:42,409
Give me extra 50 grand, you keep Teddy.
And I throw in this other fat fuck for free.

1191
01:16:44,028 --> 01:16:45,245
Oh, jeez. Chow.

1192
01:16:46,155 --> 01:16:47,498
Can we move this along?

1193
01:16:48,032 --> 01:16:50,376
Alan, account number?

1194
01:16:51,118 --> 01:16:52,461
Come On, Come On, Come On.

1195
01:16:52,619 --> 01:16:56,874
Uh, eight-one-four...

1196
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,627
K, as in "knife"...

1197
01:16:59,793 --> 01:17:02,512
two-three-nine-eight.

1198
01:17:03,922 --> 01:17:05,094
Password?

1199
01:17:05,257 --> 01:17:06,600
"Baloney1

1200
01:17:07,343 --> 01:17:08,640
Your password is "baloney1"?

1201
01:17:08,802 --> 01:17:11,726
It used to be just "baloney."
Now they make you add number.

1202
01:17:12,222 --> 01:17:15,601
Really fucking annoying. Okay.

1203
01:17:25,402 --> 01:17:27,029
- And it's that easy.
- Ta-da.

1204
01:17:28,405 --> 01:17:30,032
Oh, look, you sunk my battleship.

1205
01:17:31,784 --> 01:17:33,582
Great. Now can we please have Teddy?

1206
01:17:34,453 --> 01:17:37,252
Uh, yeah. Bring him up.

1207
01:17:37,915 --> 01:17:38,962
Good to go.

1208
01:17:39,124 --> 01:17:43,129
Ha, ha. See? We go to your
wedding, we have fun, I bust a nut.

1209
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:46,299
We did it, Stu. it's over.

1210
01:17:55,057 --> 01:17:57,776
This is Bangkok Police.
Everybody down.

1211
01:18:01,146 --> 01:18:04,150
No! Kingsley, you're fucking 5-0?

1212
01:18:04,525 --> 01:18:05,822
Gotcha, Leslie.

1213
01:18:05,984 --> 01:18:07,156
Get him out of here.

1214
01:18:07,319 --> 01:18:08,741
Go. Good, good! We're good!

1215
01:18:13,992 --> 01:18:15,915
How the fuck...?!

1216
01:18:16,078 --> 01:18:17,671
Samir?

1217
01:18:18,122 --> 01:18:22,002
You fucked me over 6 grand?
You camel jockey.

1218
01:18:23,001 --> 01:18:24,253
You spit to me?

1219
01:18:24,586 --> 01:18:26,179
You spit to me?

1220
01:18:26,338 --> 01:18:28,511
Hey, 6 grand this time, 8 grand last time.

1221
01:18:28,674 --> 01:18:30,802
It's not the money, man.
It's the principle.

1222
01:18:30,968 --> 01:18:33,847
Principle? Nigga, please.
We both dead inside.

1223
01:18:34,012 --> 01:18:36,014
You call me nigga?
Huh? Don't call me nigga.

1224
01:18:36,181 --> 01:18:39,355
- Toodleoo, motherfucker!
- Called me nigga. Racist asshole, man.

1225
01:18:41,019 --> 01:18:43,488
- You guys okay?
- What the fuck's going on?

1226
01:18:43,647 --> 01:18:45,524
Detective Inspector Peters, Interpol.

1227
01:18:45,691 --> 01:18:47,364
- You're a cop?
- Yes.

1228
01:18:47,526 --> 01:18:49,949
This sting operation's been in place
for weeks.

1229
01:18:50,112 --> 01:18:53,332
When Samir told us
that your friend was lost...

1230
01:18:53,699 --> 01:18:55,326
we took advantage of that information.

1231
01:18:55,784 --> 01:18:58,378
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

1232
01:18:58,537 --> 01:19:02,337
- So can Teddy come out of the car now?
- No, Alan, Teddy's not in the fucking car.

1233
01:19:02,499 --> 01:19:05,002
They don't have him.
They never had him.

1234
01:19:05,169 --> 01:19:07,388
They just needed us to bring them Chow.

1235
01:19:07,754 --> 01:19:09,472
They used Teddy as bait.

1236
01:19:10,841 --> 01:19:12,343
Do you have any leads at all?

1237
01:19:12,509 --> 01:19:16,230
No. We've checked everywhere,
no one has seen him. I'm sorry.

1238
01:19:16,930 --> 01:19:19,399
If you haven't found him by now...

1239
01:19:19,766 --> 01:19:22,315
I'm afraid Bangkok has him.

1240
01:19:26,607 --> 01:19:29,486
Why do people keep saying that?

1241
01:19:31,528 --> 01:19:33,030
Stu...

1242
01:19:33,906 --> 01:19:35,624
it's time.

1243
01:19:40,496 --> 01:19:41,873
Phil.

1244
01:19:42,831 --> 01:19:43,878
I'm sorry.

1245
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:47,378
Don't say that. Please.

1246
01:19:47,544 --> 01:19:49,638
No, this time we really fucked up.

1247
01:19:49,796 --> 01:19:51,719
Oh, God. How bad?

1248
01:19:51,882 --> 01:19:53,759
Like no wedding bad?

1249
01:19:53,926 --> 01:19:55,428
Yeah.

1250
01:19:55,928 --> 01:19:58,147
Little worse than that.

1251
01:20:02,601 --> 01:20:04,399
I don't know what to tell you.

1252
01:20:24,248 --> 01:20:25,966
Okay, how about this?

1253
01:20:26,124 --> 01:20:28,092
He fell off the fishing boat and drowned.

1254
01:20:29,753 --> 01:20:30,879
No.

1255
01:20:32,297 --> 01:20:33,799
Okay, I got it.

1256
01:20:33,966 --> 01:20:36,094
Teddy was hit by a truck.

1257
01:20:36,552 --> 01:20:39,271
- Alan.
- Not a good time, Phil. Kind of busy.

1258
01:20:39,429 --> 01:20:41,272
How many people get run over here?

1259
01:20:41,431 --> 01:20:43,729
Ugh. Over 1200 a year, Phil.

1260
01:20:43,892 --> 01:20:46,987
Perfect.
His body was too mangled to recover.

1261
01:20:47,145 --> 01:20:48,271
Case closed.

1262
01:20:50,023 --> 01:20:51,650
Can I have more ice, please?

1263
01:20:52,818 --> 01:20:54,286
I'm not gonna lie to Lauren.

1264
01:20:54,444 --> 01:20:57,618
Stu, do you want this or not?

1265
01:20:57,948 --> 01:21:00,451
Look at what I've done, Phil.

1266
01:21:00,784 --> 01:21:02,878
What I do.

1267
01:21:05,289 --> 01:21:08,008
I have a weakness for prostitutes.

1268
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:10,093
All kinds, apparently.

1269
01:21:14,965 --> 01:21:17,434
I have a demon in me.

1270
01:21:18,427 --> 01:21:19,974
So what?

1271
01:21:20,596 --> 01:21:25,944
Teddy's gone, but I can still save Lauren.
I'll just let her live her life without me.

1272
01:21:26,101 --> 01:21:27,148
Stu.

1273
01:21:27,311 --> 01:21:30,611
I want you to call Doug and tell him
I'm never coming back.

1274
01:21:31,064 --> 01:21:33,487
I'm getting off the hamster wheel.

1275
01:21:34,526 --> 01:21:36,779
I'm gonna stay here in Bangkok.

1276
01:21:36,945 --> 01:21:39,073
I think I belong here.

1277
01:21:39,239 --> 01:21:41,913
Open up a little dentist office.

1278
01:21:42,784 --> 01:21:44,786
Teeth cleanings with a happy ending.

1279
01:21:49,207 --> 01:21:51,005
You sure about this?

1280
01:21:58,175 --> 01:22:00,473
Hey! What the crud?

1281
01:22:02,137 --> 01:22:03,229
Power's out, Alan.

1282
01:22:07,851 --> 01:22:09,478
- Phil.
- Doug.

1283
01:22:09,645 --> 01:22:10,897
I need answers, man.

1284
01:22:11,063 --> 01:22:13,566
- I know, um...
- Doug, who are you talking to?

1285
01:22:13,732 --> 01:22:15,860
- Give me the phone.
- No, that's a private...

1286
01:22:16,026 --> 01:22:17,744
- Who is this?
- Lauren?

1287
01:22:17,903 --> 01:22:20,577
Phil? Tell me what's going on right now.

1288
01:22:21,239 --> 01:22:22,832
We lost your little brother.

1289
01:22:23,283 --> 01:22:24,330
What?

1290
01:22:24,493 --> 01:22:26,916
Bangkok has him now.

1291
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,758
We gotta take the stairs.

1292
01:22:35,921 --> 01:22:37,389
You're in Bangkok?

1293
01:22:41,176 --> 01:22:44,601
Ew! That's a finger!

1294
01:22:44,763 --> 01:22:46,106
Put Stu on the phone.

1295
01:22:47,099 --> 01:22:50,569
"Bangkok experiences
1500 power outages per year."

1296
01:22:50,727 --> 01:22:52,821
Stu really just doesn't wanna
talk to anybody.

1297
01:22:53,647 --> 01:22:54,864
- Water.
- Power's out.

1298
01:22:55,023 --> 01:22:57,947
Come on, Stewie.
Use that big Jewish brain.

1299
01:22:58,110 --> 01:23:00,363
He's just not up for it...

1300
01:23:00,529 --> 01:23:02,952
- Phil? Phil. Phil, give me the phone.
- it's Lauren.

1301
01:23:03,115 --> 01:23:07,211
- I know. I need to talk to her.
- I'm handling this. I'll handle this, Stu!

1302
01:23:07,369 --> 01:23:10,088
- You're gonna break her heart!
- Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

1303
01:23:10,247 --> 01:23:11,294
I'm so sorry!

1304
01:23:11,456 --> 01:23:15,051
Stu? What the hell is going on?
What does he mean, you lost Teddy?

1305
01:23:15,210 --> 01:23:17,258
What? Is that what Phil said?

1306
01:23:17,421 --> 01:23:20,049
No, no, no. We misplaced Teddy.

1307
01:23:20,215 --> 01:23:23,515
But we're all good now. We're headed back
to the resort. See you soon.

1308
01:23:24,469 --> 01:23:25,971
I love you so much.

1309
01:23:26,138 --> 01:23:30,063
And I gotta go, but I'll see you soon. Bye.

1310
01:23:32,644 --> 01:23:34,146
Stu!

1311
01:23:37,023 --> 01:23:38,445
- Stu...!
- Ah!

1312
01:23:40,152 --> 01:23:42,575
Taxi! Taxi!

1313
01:23:42,738 --> 01:23:46,163
Come on! Come on, Alan! Come on!

1314
01:23:47,576 --> 01:23:49,704
- Hey, you mind filling us in?
- Okay.

1315
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:52,123
- Now, when we woke up, the power was out.
- Yeah.

1316
01:23:52,289 --> 01:23:54,166
And you found Teddy's finger in what?

1317
01:23:54,833 --> 01:23:58,007
- In a bowl of water.
- But it didn't start out as water.

1318
01:23:58,170 --> 01:24:00,764
- It was ice.
- Exactly. Teddy got ice from the machine...

1319
01:24:00,922 --> 01:24:03,721
came back to the room,
put his finger on ice, fell asleep.

1320
01:24:03,884 --> 01:24:07,263
What do you do if you wake up
and your finger's in a bowl of melted ice?

1321
01:24:07,429 --> 01:24:11,184
I'd get more ice, Stu,
on the 15th fucking floor!

1322
01:24:11,349 --> 01:24:14,444
Yes!
Teddy goes up, the power goes out...

1323
01:24:14,603 --> 01:24:17,732
Holy shit. Of course.

1324
01:24:17,898 --> 01:24:19,650
Of course, he's in the ice machine.

1325
01:24:19,816 --> 01:24:21,864
Alan, no!

1326
01:24:25,322 --> 01:24:26,790
It's on 10!

1327
01:24:26,948 --> 01:24:28,200
Sir, is the elevator stuck?

1328
01:24:29,785 --> 01:24:32,208
- Come on.
- Go. Go, go, go.

1329
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:36,712
Ten! This is it! Teddy!

1330
01:24:36,875 --> 01:24:38,127
Teddy! Teddy!

1331
01:24:38,293 --> 01:24:40,216
Look out, look out.

1332
01:24:47,093 --> 01:24:51,064
- Oh, my God! Teddy!
- He's okay! He's okay!

1333
01:24:51,223 --> 01:24:52,566
Hey, you okay?

1334
01:24:53,183 --> 01:24:54,901
You okay, man?

1335
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:56,061
Where am I?

1336
01:24:56,228 --> 01:24:58,401
You're in an elevator in the middle
of Bangkok.

1337
01:24:58,563 --> 01:25:00,907
But we're gonna get you out of here.
It's gonna be fine.

1338
01:25:01,066 --> 01:25:02,488
Hey, Stu...

1339
01:25:02,734 --> 01:25:04,532
nice tattoo.

1340
01:25:06,363 --> 01:25:08,536
- Thanks, man.
- All right, let's do this.

1341
01:25:08,698 --> 01:25:10,166
Come on. Come on, come on.

1342
01:25:10,325 --> 01:25:13,078
Doug, we found him. Yeah!

1343
01:25:13,245 --> 01:25:16,920
I know, I know, but we're on our way.
Okay, bye.

1344
01:25:17,082 --> 01:25:20,427
All right, guests are arriving,
people are starting to ask questions...

1345
01:25:20,585 --> 01:25:22,587
but we can still pull this off.

1346
01:25:22,754 --> 01:25:25,007
- How?
- I don't know. Like, a taxi?

1347
01:25:25,173 --> 01:25:26,846
- Chow's speedboat.
- What?

1348
01:25:27,008 --> 01:25:29,557
Last thing I remember was getting
off Chow's speedboat.

1349
01:25:29,719 --> 01:25:31,517
Chow has a speedboat?

1350
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,648
The Perfect Life.

1351
01:25:34,224 --> 01:25:35,271
Come on.

1352
01:25:39,145 --> 01:25:41,364
Stu, get that back line.

1353
01:25:42,983 --> 01:25:44,826
Good jump, Phil!

1354
01:25:46,862 --> 01:25:48,739
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1355
01:25:49,114 --> 01:25:50,707
You sure you know how
to drive this thing?

1356
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,498
Please. I was raised in yacht clubs.
I know what I'm doing.

1357
01:26:17,809 --> 01:26:19,811
You know where we're going?

1358
01:26:20,478 --> 01:26:22,321
Please address me as "captain."

1359
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,983
Oh, fuck you, Alan.

1360
01:26:25,942 --> 01:26:29,788
Do you know where We're going,
captain?

1361
01:26:30,405 --> 01:26:35,286
Affirmative, cadet. We're going south,
through the Gulf of Thailand. Ha, ha.

1362
01:26:35,452 --> 01:26:36,624
Good.

1363
01:26:57,891 --> 01:27:01,191
Hey. You okay?

1364
01:27:02,103 --> 01:27:04,356
- Feeling a little better.
- All right.

1365
01:27:05,857 --> 01:27:10,328
Listen, Teddy, I'm really sorry.
We didn't mean for any of this to happen.

1366
01:27:11,363 --> 01:27:15,243
It's funny. I can't remember anything...

1367
01:27:15,408 --> 01:27:18,537
but when I woke up...

1368
01:27:18,954 --> 01:27:20,627
I was kind of happy.

1369
01:27:21,498 --> 01:27:22,670
Yeah!

1370
01:27:24,501 --> 01:27:27,880
By the way, you have any idea
where my finger is?

1371
01:27:28,046 --> 01:27:31,391
Yeah, we gave it
to a drug-dealing monkey.

1372
01:27:34,386 --> 01:27:35,763
Bangkok.

1373
01:27:36,221 --> 01:27:38,064
Yeah, right?

1374
01:27:38,223 --> 01:27:40,021
Fucking Bangkok.

1375
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:50,239
He's on his way, I'm telling you.
Dad's always doing this.

1376
01:27:50,568 --> 01:27:52,241
No, it's just...

1377
01:27:54,030 --> 01:27:55,782
I apologize! There will be no wedding!

1378
01:27:55,949 --> 01:27:58,372
No, he is on his way. He will be here.

1379
01:27:58,535 --> 01:28:01,163
Please, if you will all move to the bar.

1380
01:28:01,329 --> 01:28:03,582
We are going to clear this area. Please.

1381
01:28:05,083 --> 01:28:06,881
Daddy, how can you do this?

1382
01:28:07,377 --> 01:28:10,005
I'm telling you, I spoke to him.
He's coming.

1383
01:28:12,048 --> 01:28:13,766
You don't understand.

1384
01:28:13,925 --> 01:28:16,394
Look. There they are.

1385
01:28:20,348 --> 01:28:22,021
Stu!

1386
01:28:27,772 --> 01:28:29,399
Alan, there's no dock.

1387
01:28:29,566 --> 01:28:30,613
Just hang on.

1388
01:28:30,775 --> 01:28:33,028
- Alan, it's not funny. Turn the boat.
- Hang on.

1389
01:28:33,194 --> 01:28:34,867
Is that Alan driving the boat?

1390
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:36,623
What? Uh...

1391
01:28:36,781 --> 01:28:40,035
We should probably move back a little bit.
Come on.

1392
01:28:40,201 --> 01:28:41,578
- Alan, slow down!
- Please!

1393
01:28:41,745 --> 01:28:44,544
Turn the boat! Turn the boat, Alan!
Turn the fucking boat!

1394
01:28:44,706 --> 01:28:46,379
Everyone, back up a little bit here.

1395
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:49,886
Sir, it's gonna get worse
before it gets better. Come on, sir.

1396
01:28:50,045 --> 01:28:51,137
Hold on! Hold on!

1397
01:29:00,972 --> 01:29:01,973
Fuck!

1398
01:29:05,685 --> 01:29:06,732
Hi.

1399
01:29:06,895 --> 01:29:08,738
Hi, everybody.

1400
01:29:10,231 --> 01:29:12,484
We came in a little hotter
than we planned.

1401
01:29:12,859 --> 01:29:14,827
And sorry we trenched the lawn here.

1402
01:29:15,737 --> 01:29:17,831
Totally fixable. A bit of sod, we'll be fine.

1403
01:29:17,989 --> 01:29:19,332
- Baby!
- Oh, my God.

1404
01:29:19,491 --> 01:29:22,586
- Hi.
- Ah, I'm so happy to see you.

1405
01:29:23,495 --> 01:29:24,997
Teddy.

1406
01:29:25,497 --> 01:29:26,919
Teddy, here.

1407
01:29:27,082 --> 01:29:29,176
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh, Teddy.

1408
01:29:29,334 --> 01:29:32,429
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1409
01:29:32,587 --> 01:29:34,089
No! Your hand!

1410
01:29:34,506 --> 01:29:38,181
I know. We had an accident. I'm okay.

1411
01:29:39,761 --> 01:29:41,809
- This is your fault.
- No, Dad.

1412
01:29:41,971 --> 01:29:43,848
He's right. Mr. Srisai, Lauren.

1413
01:29:44,015 --> 01:29:46,268
- I haven't been completely honest with you.
- Stu?

1414
01:29:46,434 --> 01:29:47,481
- Yeah?
- Don't do this.

1415
01:29:47,644 --> 01:29:49,942
Thanks, Phil, but gonna do it.

1416
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,778
You said I'm chok.

1417
01:29:52,941 --> 01:29:55,319
Well, I'm not.

1418
01:29:55,485 --> 01:30:00,207
I'm not some weird milky, ricey,
watery goop...

1419
01:30:00,365 --> 01:30:02,993
that you feed to infants
and old people, okay?

1420
01:30:03,159 --> 01:30:06,629
Maybe I would be
if you added some cayenne pepper.

1421
01:30:09,791 --> 01:30:13,591
I wish I was a boring dentist
who had a boring life and boring friends...

1422
01:30:13,753 --> 01:30:16,222
but I don't, I'm not.

1423
01:30:16,464 --> 01:30:18,842
I'm actually part of this weird wolf pack.

1424
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:22,478
Hey, it's not weird. it's pretty cool, actually.
No membership fee...

1425
01:30:22,637 --> 01:30:24,890
I have heard enough of this.
You come here.

1426
01:30:25,056 --> 01:30:26,603
Whoa.

1427
01:30:27,767 --> 01:30:29,235
Here's the deal, man.

1428
01:30:29,894 --> 01:30:32,317
I got a dark side.

1429
01:30:34,065 --> 01:30:36,193
There's a demon in me.

1430
01:30:36,693 --> 01:30:38,240
It's true, he has semen in him.

1431
01:30:39,404 --> 01:30:41,202
I said "demon."

1432
01:30:41,364 --> 01:30:43,241
But you also have semen in you.
Remember?

1433
01:30:43,408 --> 01:30:46,161
That's not relevant, but thank you, Alan.

1434
01:30:47,829 --> 01:30:48,876
Point is...

1435
01:30:49,038 --> 01:30:53,589
this demon takes me
to some pretty weird places.

1436
01:30:53,751 --> 01:30:57,005
And we lost Teddy
for two days in Bangkok.

1437
01:30:57,589 --> 01:31:01,435
But that same demon took us to hell
and back to find him.

1438
01:31:01,593 --> 01:31:04,096
We took on Bangkok and we won.

1439
01:31:04,262 --> 01:31:08,608
And that's pretty fucking cool
if you ask me. Right?

1440
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:15,650
I love your daughter
and I'm gonna marry her...

1441
01:31:15,815 --> 01:31:17,909
unless you have any problem with that.

1442
01:31:18,067 --> 01:31:19,364
- I'm good.
- All right.

1443
01:31:20,486 --> 01:31:23,035
But all that said...

1444
01:31:23,198 --> 01:31:25,997
it would actually mean a great deal
to both of us...

1445
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:29,538
if we could just get
your motherfucking blessing.

1446
01:31:45,637 --> 01:31:47,435
Hey, Alan.

1447
01:31:48,431 --> 01:31:50,104
Your head looks pretty cool shaved.

1448
01:31:51,226 --> 01:31:52,398
Thanks, Phil.

1449
01:31:53,061 --> 01:31:54,654
You should shave your head too.

1450
01:31:55,063 --> 01:31:56,360
Why would I do that?

1451
01:31:56,522 --> 01:31:59,150
Well, that way,
we would look exactly alike.

1452
01:32:10,286 --> 01:32:11,913
Take good care of my daughter, Stu.

1453
01:32:12,497 --> 01:32:15,546
- I will.
- Thank you.

1454
01:32:22,006 --> 01:32:24,509
I'm sorry we almost
killed everyone with the boat.

1455
01:32:24,676 --> 01:32:26,770
Just happy you're here.

1456
01:32:29,347 --> 01:32:33,102
Don't worry about the tattoo. I'll have it
lasered as soon as we're home in L.A.

1457
01:32:33,268 --> 01:32:34,861
It's okay. I can get used to it.

1458
01:32:36,271 --> 01:32:37,693
Really?

1459
01:32:40,441 --> 01:32:43,615
- But for now, let's switch sides?
- Yeah, okay.

1460
01:32:43,778 --> 01:32:45,530
Thank you.

1461
01:32:46,364 --> 01:32:47,991
Much better.

1462
01:32:49,242 --> 01:32:51,711
Dear family and friends...

1463
01:32:51,869 --> 01:32:53,542
on behalf of Stu and Lauren...

1464
01:32:53,705 --> 01:32:57,380
I welcome all of you
for this marriage celebration.

1465
01:32:57,875 --> 01:33:01,675
We are here today to encourage,
celebrate...

1466
01:33:36,956 --> 01:33:38,208
I walk along the avenue

1467
01:33:39,417 --> 01:33:43,388
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you

1468
01:33:44,005 --> 01:33:46,349
Meet a girl like you

1469
01:33:48,134 --> 01:33:53,231
And I ran
Iran so far away

1470
01:33:53,806 --> 01:33:55,900
I couldn't get away

1471
01:33:56,434 --> 01:33:58,937
Thanks, buddy.
Can you hold on for a second?

1472
01:33:59,103 --> 01:34:00,525
Thank you. Ahem.

1473
01:34:08,237 --> 01:34:11,116
Hello? Hi, everyone.

1474
01:34:12,116 --> 01:34:14,460
I'm, uh... My name's Alan Garner.

1475
01:34:14,619 --> 01:34:20,922
Um, I want to thank the Asiatic
people for allowing us in your land.

1476
01:34:22,627 --> 01:34:26,757
I wanted to, um, say that, um,
I'm really happy to be here...

1477
01:34:26,923 --> 01:34:30,973
and I have a wedding gift
to present to Lauren and Stu.

1478
01:34:31,344 --> 01:34:35,440
Um, and a lot of thought have gone
into this...

1479
01:34:35,598 --> 01:34:39,774
and I hope that you appreciate it
as much I di... Are going to.

1480
01:34:39,936 --> 01:34:40,983
Okay. Guys.

1481
01:34:55,326 --> 01:34:58,045
Bangkok, Oriental setting, and the city
Don't know what the city is getting

1482
01:34:58,246 --> 01:34:59,839
Oh, fuck!

1483
01:35:00,039 --> 01:35:02,588
In a show with everything
But Yul Brynner, ya know?

1484
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:09,300
One night in Bangkok
And the world's your oyster

1485
01:35:09,924 --> 01:35:13,178
The bars are temples
But the pearls, they ain't free

1486
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:18,020
You'll find a god in every golden cloister

1487
01:35:18,683 --> 01:35:21,778
And if you're lucky, then the god's a she

1488
01:35:22,019 --> 01:35:23,236
Alan!

1489
01:35:23,396 --> 01:35:25,649
I can feel the devil walking next to me

1490
01:35:25,815 --> 01:35:27,783
What the fuck, man?

1491
01:35:27,942 --> 01:35:30,821
- So, what do you think?
- It's insane! How did you do that?

1492
01:35:30,987 --> 01:35:33,911
My dad had to make a lot of calls,
and then I told Mike, I said:

1493
01:35:34,073 --> 01:35:36,371
"You gotta do it.
It's for my third best friend."

1494
01:35:37,118 --> 01:35:39,962
Alan, it's amazing. I love it.

1495
01:35:40,121 --> 01:35:41,168
Thank you so much.

1496
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:44,960
We only have him for the night.
We don't own him permanently.

1497
01:35:45,751 --> 01:35:47,628
Understood.

1498
01:35:48,171 --> 01:35:52,221
One night in Bangkok
Makes the hard man humble

1499
01:35:52,758 --> 01:35:56,137
Not much between despair and ecstasy

1500
01:35:56,888 --> 01:36:00,563
I can feel the devil walking next to me

1501
01:36:03,311 --> 01:36:05,188
You do a lot of public speaking, Alan?

1502
01:36:07,565 --> 01:36:09,613
Mike, you were great.

1503
01:36:09,775 --> 01:36:11,994
It's true, that was incredible.

1504
01:36:12,153 --> 01:36:15,407
Thanks, guys. Thank you.
That means a lot. Really, it does.

1505
01:36:15,573 --> 01:36:18,702
By the way, you really need to remove
that fucking tattoo from your face.

1506
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:20,870
Yep. On it.

1507
01:36:23,289 --> 01:36:25,417
Sorry about the last-minute
performance change.

1508
01:36:25,583 --> 01:36:27,506
- Don't worry.
- What are you talking about?

1509
01:36:27,668 --> 01:36:30,763
Well, he was supposed to sing
"Burning Up" by the Jonas Brothers...

1510
01:36:30,922 --> 01:36:33,266
but then I remembered
you don't like indie rock.

1511
01:36:33,424 --> 01:36:35,597
Hey, guys. You're not gonna believe this.

1512
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,138
- Is that your phone?
- Yeah.

1513
01:36:38,304 --> 01:36:40,227
How come you never tried calling us?

1514
01:36:40,389 --> 01:36:41,982
It's been dead for two days.

1515
01:36:42,141 --> 01:36:44,439
But I recharged it
and found all these photos.

1516
01:36:44,602 --> 01:36:46,195
- What?
- Oh, shit.

1517
01:36:46,354 --> 01:36:47,947
Some of it's pretty messed up.

1518
01:36:48,105 --> 01:36:51,109
- Awesome. Let's check them out.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1519
01:36:51,275 --> 01:36:52,777
No one needs to see this stuff.

1520
01:36:52,944 --> 01:36:55,367
Come on, man. I'm Mike Tyson.
I've seen everything.

1521
01:36:55,947 --> 01:36:58,075
- It'll be fine.
- What...?

1522
01:36:59,617 --> 01:37:01,244
All right. But we look at it once...

1523
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:04,630
And then we delete them.
It's gonna be okay.

1524
01:37:05,957 --> 01:37:07,049
Motherfucker.
