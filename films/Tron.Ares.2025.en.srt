00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,583
<i>The Grid.</i>

2
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,000
<i>A digital frontier.</i>

3
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:35,791
<i>A world beyond the screen
as real as our own.</i>

4
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,625
<i>I can picture it.</i>

5
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:41,000
<i>Clusters of information
rising like cities.</i>

6
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,708
<i>Programs as complex
as you and me.</i>

7
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,791
<i>In just a few years,</i>

8
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,291
<i>we're gonna be able
to enter this world.</i>

9
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,041
<i>And a few years after that,</i>

10
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,291
<i>well, this world
will come into ours.</i>

11
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,500
<i>Intelligent life
from inside the machine.</i>

12
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,208
<i>I, for one,
can't wait to meet it.</i>

00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,625
{\an8}<i>Our lead story,</i>

14
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:06,875
{\an8}<i>Encom CEO and video game icon
Kevin Flynn has disappeared.</i>

15
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,875
<i>He was best known</i>
<i>for designing</i> Tron

16
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,333
<i>and</i> Space Paranoids,

17
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:12,500
<i>the best-selling video games
in history.</i>

18
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:13,875
{\an8}<i>The company that started</i>

20
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:19,208
{\an8}<i>has faced years
of corporate turmoil.</i>

21
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:22,666
{\an8}<i>Can it find its way to
the victory screen once again?</i>

22
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,916
<i>It's a sister-act for Encom.</i>

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,666
<i>Eve and Tess Kim take the reins</i>

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,458

<i>The race between Encom

33
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,000
<i>as new CEOs Julian Dillinger</i>

34
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,041
<i>and the Kim sisters square off.</i>

35
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:53,083
<i>Here at Encom,</i>
<i>we believe the beauty of AI</i>

36
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,791
<i>is not the ability to build

00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:16,958
Who are you?

51
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,583
<i>I am your creator.</i>

52
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,958
And who am I?

53
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,750
Mmm.

54
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,416
<i>Not "who." What.</i>

55
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,666
<i>You are Dillinger Systems
security software.</i>

56
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,791
<i>Program name, Ares.
Defender of the Grid.</i>

57
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,125
<i>You are Master Control.</i>

58
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:49,916
Ares.

59
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,750
I am Master Control.

60
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,583
<i>So, you made it.</i>

61
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,928
<i>I had a feeling that you would.</i>

62
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,750
<i>I always dreamed that
we would do this together.</i>

63
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,500
<i>I'll admit,
not exactly like this.</i>

64
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,208
<i>But I'm glad you're here.</i>

65
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,000
<i>I'm really glad.</i>

66
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,625
<i>And, Evie,</i>

67
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,958
<i>remember I'm still here.</i>

68
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,958
<i>Even if you can't see me.</i>

69
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,125
<i>I love you.</i>

70
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, my God. Um, Eve.

71
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,458
I'm not sure you
actually told me

72
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,639
we'd be stealing energy
from the power grid.

73
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,666
Wow. So this is where
she kept coming back to, huh?

74
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,542
To be this disconnected
from the world?

75
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,708
That is dedication, my friend.

76
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,708
Wow.

77
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,166
It looks like your sister
had a little crush.

78
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,041
Yeah. She was so sure
Flynn left us the answer.

79
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,375
Like on a floppy disk?

80
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,333
Poor Flynn lived
before the cloud, huh?

81
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,083
Hey, are you still
gonna be doing

82
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,041
CEO-type stuff
while we're out here?

83
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,542
You know, like, earnings calls,

84
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,167
and the launch
of <i>Panic City</i> and stuff.

85
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,875
Let's just get this done.

86
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,042
Dude, I can make breakfast
burritos right here.

87
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,583
Hell yeah.

88
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,458
This is for you, Tess.

89
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,458
Members of the board,

90
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,333
for over 40 years,
my family at Dillinger Systems

91
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,916
has battled Encom
for control of the future.

92
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,375
You put me in charge
of the company

93
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,125
to ensure our victory.

94
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,625
Today...

95
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,416
I make it so.

96
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,958
Imagine if all our
digital prowess

97
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,250
wasn't just digital.

98
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,917
What if anything we could
dream in the machine

99
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,750
could become a reality here?

100
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,041
What if we could
build the bridge

101
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,916
between two previously
walled-off worlds?

102
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:17,166
So much talk of AI
in big tech today.

103
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,792
Virtual worlds,
what are they gonna look like?

104
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,125
When will we get there?

105
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,208
Well, folks.
We're not going there.

106
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,500
They are coming here.

107
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,541
<i>Attention,</i>

108
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,083
<i>please put on
your safety glasses now.</i>

109
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:35,958
<i>Laser systems activated.</i>

110
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,791
<i>Power fluctuations are nominal.</i>

111
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,791
<i>Warning, stand clear.</i>

112
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,125
<i>Outputting</i>
<i>from Dillinger Systems server.</i>

113
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,542

<i>Transfer complete.</i>

120
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,500
I present the Dillinger Systems

121
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,416
Amphibious Rapid-response Tank.

122
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,083
The DART.

123
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,250
Digitally modeled
inside our server,

124
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,382
output using our patented
laser technology.

125
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,125
There's an M1 rifle gun,
two M240 machine guns.

126
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,208
It's got a top speed of
75 miles per hour.

127
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,458
Durability, you find a wall,

128
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,292
this thing is gonna
drive through it.

129
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:46,125
This is full-scale war,
five minutes' notice.

130
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:51,291
So, if we can create
the hardware of the future,

131
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,083
then why not
the soldier to operate it?

132
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,708
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like you to meet Ares.

133
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:25,541
This is the most sophisticated
security program ever written.

134
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,416
Do you wanna shake his hand?
Go ahead. He doesn't bite.

135
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,958
Ares has billions of lines
of code unique to him.

136
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,358
Is it alive?

137
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,875
That depends
on your definition, Stuart.

138
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,583
Because unlike you,
he's biblically strong,

139
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,375
lightning fast,
and supremely intelligent.

140
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:50,666
He is fully proprietary
and 100% expendable.

141
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,583
Ares is the ultimate soldier.

142
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,458
He needs no food, no water,
sheds no blood.

143
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,750
And if, by some miracle,

144
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,292
he is struck down
on the battlefield,

145
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,125
I will simply make you another.

146
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,916
With all that
sophisticated code,

147
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,902
what makes you think
you can contain it?

148
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,542
I can assure you, General,

149
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,292
the most advanced
fail-safe mechanisms

150
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,083
and restriction protocols
are in place.

151
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,375
Ares is predictable,

152
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,166
controllable and fully aligned.

153
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Southerly front
with isentropic lift,

154
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,083
turning cyclonic.

155
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,583
{\an8}2.6 inches.

156
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,750
I hope that you brought
your umbrellas.

157
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,750
I have to hand it to you,
Julian.

158
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,041
You promised a big win

159
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,541
and this is even bigger

160
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,625
than any of us
could've imagined.

161
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,625
Thank you.

162
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,541
My grandfather started
Dillinger Corporation

163
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,291
long before anybody heard
the term "cybersecurity."

164
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,625
Military AI is the future.

165
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,667
The question is not whether
the car should be built.

166
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,916
The car is...

167
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,666
being built right now.

168
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,416
The question is...

169
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,041
who's holding the keys?

170
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:45,208
That was
quite some parlor trick.

171
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,000
-Time?
-Forty-four seconds.

172
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,540
"I hope you
brought your umbrellas."

173
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,625
Oh, was that in the script,

174
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,458
or was he just having a moment?

175
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,166
Elisabeth Dillinger,

176
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,541
eldest daughter of founder
Edward Dillinger, deceased.

177
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,083
Longtime CEO during a
relatively unremarkable period

178
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,208
of corporate history
before being superseded

179
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,291
by your only son.

180
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,916
It's a pleasure.

181
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,916
Unremarkable?

182
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,875
Market share was up 12%
during my tenure.

183
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,250
That's hardly...

184
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,208
And anyway, we don't say
it "superseded," we...

185
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,125
...we call it "giving birth."

186
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,333
Of course.

187
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,167
It's an honor
to meet my creator's creator.

188
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,791
Oh, well, here we go.

189
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,417
I noticed
you left out the part

190
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,083
where you can't seem to keep
this thing of yours alive

191
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,375
-for more than 25 minutes.
-Twenty-nine.

192
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,833
Deceiving your investors,
Julian,

193
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,167
is hardly a business model.

194
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,166
Whoever controls
the Permanence Code

195
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,291
controls the future.

196
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,375
We have to win.

197
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,166
Look, I...

198
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:10,125
admire your vision.
Straighten up.

199
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,166
However, the board will only
stand behind you

200
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,208
for another six months...

201
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,625
if you're lucky.

202
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,416
But if it doesn't work...

203
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,208
all of this goes away, darling.

204
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:32,916
Everything we have built
for the past 40 years.

205
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,291
What if I said
I had found a way?

206
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,500
Oh. I think this is
my 95th breakfast burrito,

207
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:13,083
and, honestly, can't get
enough. Isn't that wild?

208
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,708
Well...

209
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,458
Nice to see Tess wasn't the only

210
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,958
obsessive one in the family.

211
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,458
"Yeah, Seth, you're right.

212
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,792
Sorry, I should pay
more attention to you."

213
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,192
"Oh, don't worry about it."

214
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,125
Okay.

215
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,291
-I'm sorry.
-Get out of here.

216
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:49,500
Look, three months in sub-zero
is a long time, I get it.

217
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,666
Yeah, and four days,
ten hours, 32 minutes.

218
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,291
Who's counting, really?

219
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,208
You know...

220
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,666
Hold on.

221
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,083
What do you mean?

222
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:03,833
What?

223
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:21,958
Seth.

224
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,083
-What, you found something?
-I think so.

225
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,458
The line of code.

226
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,297
That's how he hid it,
it's two lines.

227
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,333
Whoa.

228
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,791
That looks like a double helix.

229
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,750
It is a double helix.

230
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,708
Tess would've loved this.

231
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,000
Wait. Are you serious?

232
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,083
So no more "29 minutes and out"?

233
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,629
If this is what I think it is,

234
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,166
it's the Permanence Code.

235
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Okay.

236
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:06,541
Encom offline trial 317a-1.
Permanence Code implemented.

237
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,375
Testing for asset stability

238
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,125
beyond current
29-minute barrier.

239
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,250
Go.

240
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,291
-Ready when you are.
-Okay.

241
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,748
It's all in the wrists, baby.

242
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,041
That never gets old.

243
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,083
Trial commenced.

244
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,708
Twenty-nine minutes
and counting down.

245
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,000
Let's see
if you last this time.

246
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,375
<i>Ares is the ultimate soldier.</i>

247
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:36,958
<i>If by some miracle</i>

248
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,833
<i>he is struck down
on the battlefield,</i>

249
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,750
<i>I will simply make you another.</i>

250
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,458
<i>Fully proprietary, 100%...</i>

251
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,208
...expendable.

252
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,500
-Athena.
-Welcome back, sir.

253
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,833
All units are online
and ready for inspection.

254
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,041
So how was it?

255
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,000
It was interesting.
Different this time.

256
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,750
I met a mother and a son.

257
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,166
It was raining.

258
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,125
The condensed moisture
of the atmosphere

259
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,875
falling visibly
in separate drops.

260
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,458
I could almost feel it.

261
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,000
Feel? I don't understand.

262
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,292
<i>This is Eve.</i>

263
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,083
<i>Get sensible and text.</i>

264
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,791
Hey, Eve. It's Erin. Got Ajay
for you again. Hit us back.

265
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,583
Still straight to voicemail.

266
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,708
CEO of a Fortune 500 company

267
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,000
and your phone's down
on our biggest night?

268
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,500
Goddamn it.
Where the hell are you, Eve?

269
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,375
All right, Paranoia-Con!

270
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:54,083
In five, four, three, two, one.

271
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,291
Did we just do it?
Dude, it's still there!

272
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,042
Dude, we just changed
the world, man!

273
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,916
You did it, Eve!
Oh, my God, you did it.

274
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,583
<i>Big news out of Encom tonight.</i>

275
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,083
<i>CEO Eve Kim will not attend</i>

276
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,458
<i>the highly anticipated
launch event</i>

277
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:28,458
<i>for the company's new game,</i>

278
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,083
<i>Kim, the visionary designer</i>

279
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:33,083
<i>behind the relaunch of

280
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,167
Well, I spoke to several
of our board members,

281
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,375
and needless to say
they are impressed.

282
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,125
Julian.

283
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,964
-Just carry on.
-Yes, sir.

284
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,417
What are you doing?

285
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,037
Oh, just trying to
change the world, Mother.

286
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,625
What's going on?

287
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,166
You're hacking Encom?

288
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,375
Just a peek
over the garden wall.

289
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,833
No one will notice.

290
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,250
What makes you think that Encom

291
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,667
is any closer to finding it?

292
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,042
Because I know who else
is looking for it, all right?

293
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,208
Who?

294
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:02,625
Eve Kim.

295
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,583
She's following
in her sister's footsteps.

296
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:05,792
She's after the Permanence Code.

297
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:06,875
I can feel it.

298
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,958
So I'm gonna find her,
and when I do...

299
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,333
No, I don't like it.
It's too risky, Julian.

300
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,458
Oops.

301
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,958
<i>Security breach in all zones.</i>

303
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,625
Penetrate the server core and
extract Eve Kim's user file.

00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,750

00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:16,875

307
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,083
-It's cowboy time.
-Oh, no.

308
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,458
Whoo!

309
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:23,625
Nice to see you!

Thank you.

312
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,625
What's up, Paranoia-Con?

313
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:57,541
I'm going in.

314
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,250
I'm in.

315
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm a genius! Who knew
you raised a genius, Mother?

316
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,666
I'm in!

317
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,333

00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:40,333
Initiate containment protocols

We need a response now.

320
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,250
Initiate security protocol.

339
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:16,875
Yes!

You're gonna make it, Caius.

Sometimes you have to
sacrifice your knight

-This is crazy.
-Have you seen this?

-This way, sir.

<i>Eve Kim's file acquired.</i>

358
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,500
<i>Objective achieved.</i>

359
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:02,250
Sir, I'm curious
why the Program Caius

360
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,291
was not reconstituted.

361
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:09,500
<i>I'm curious why you are curious.</i>

362
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:14,000
<i>Caius was dysfunctional,
so he was deleted.</i>

363
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:19,916
Just like any program

364
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,416
<i>that operates outside
their directive can be.</i>

365
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,500
<i>Do you understand?</i>

366
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,125
<i>Acknowledge, Master Control.</i>

367
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:35,958
Of course.

368
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:40,666
We are 100% expendable.

369
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:45,000
<i>New mission, Master Control.
Locate Eve Kim.</i>

370
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,083
Yes, sir.

371
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,500
Seems like we had
a little cyber breach, Jules.

372
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:52,583
But then of course
you knew that.

373
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:54,333
It looks like
the whole world knows, buddy.

374
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:55,833
Might wanna stay off
the socials for a few days.

375
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:57,917
You wanna play games with me?
Let's play games, Julian.

376
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,500
I heard about your cute
little pitch to the board.

377
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:03,041
<i>But you left off one
key detail from your deck.</i>

378
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:05,000
Did you tell them
the shot clock expires

379
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,166
at 29 minutes?

380
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:08,417
<i>Don't make me call</i> The Journal
<i>and tell them</i>

381
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,042
<i>you're making promises
you can't keep.</i>

382
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,250
Promises?

383
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,083
What, you mean like the one
that your CEO

384
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:14,375
<i>will be in office
running the company?</i>

385
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,250
Something in the water
over there, Ajay?

386
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,750
I mean, first, wonder boy
Sam Flynn, now his successor.

387
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:21,666
<i>Where is she, Ajay?
Do you even know where she is?</i>

388
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,000
Maybe you're right.

389
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,500
Maybe Eve went nuts.

390
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,916
Maybe she went AWOL
and left the country,

391
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,416
<i>or maybe...</i>

392
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,875
she's holed up off the grid

393
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,617
looking for the same
thing you are.

394
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,708
And I know who my money's on.

395
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,583
You mean what's left of it
after tonight.

396
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:36,916
End of line!

397
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,375
I hate that man.

398
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,000
Thank you so much.

399
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,666
You know, I made those oranges.

400
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,125
It's a long story.

401
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,041
Stop, stop, stop.

402
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:55,750
What are you doing?

403
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,500
-1913 messages. Popular.
-Wow.

404
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,220
Oh, it's Ajay.
Yeah, that's you.

405
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,750
-Ajay, are you there?
-Am I here?

406
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:07,542
A brute force attack
took down our servers

407
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,083

410
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:14,916
I found it, Ajay. It's real.

411
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:16,917
<i>Right where
Tess thought it would be.</i>

412
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,791
<i>Flynn had it all along.</i>

413
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,167
Are you talking
about the Permanence Code?

414
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,500
Yeah. Four hours and counting.

415
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,750
Zero degradation,
no instability.

416
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:25,875
It's incredible.

417
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:28,041
Wait a second.
Did you say four hours?

418
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,833
-<i>Yeah, four hours.</i>
-My God.

419
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:34,000
He must know, Evie.

420
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,291
-<i>I just spoke to Dillinger.</i>
-Wait.

421
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,250
-You just spoke to Dillinger?
<i>-He's looking</i>

422

423
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,500
We gotta move on this.

424
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,166
Eve, you've done a great thing.

425
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:45,458
Tess did a great thing.

426
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:46,791
I'm en route to Encom.

427
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,292
We'll secure the code,
I have it with me on a drive.

00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:32,666
Wow.

536
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:37,625
Where am I?

537
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,708
Dillinger Systems
Central Processing Unit.

538
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:44,083
Wait. What?

539
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:49,291
We have identified the sequence.

540
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:52,125
The user possesses the code.

541
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,208
The code?

542
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,541
The code?

543
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,667
I don't have the code.
I destroyed the drive.

544
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,583
Silence, user.

545
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:01,791
The code isn't only on a drive.

546
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:02,917
The code is inside of you.

547
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,417
Whether you remember it or not,

548
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,625
you've seen it
and that is enough.

549
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:08,292
Sir, her disk is showing
signs of instability.

550
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:09,875
Define instability.

551
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:12,416
Extraction of the code
may result in de-resolution

552
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,500
of the carrier.

553
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:14,917
The directive is clear.

554
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,791
Isolate the thread
and commence extraction.

555
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:20,833
Copy.

556
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:23,416
Wait. No, no, no.

557
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,541
Stop.

558
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:27,541
Athena is correct.

559
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:31,000
There's only one user
whose directive we follow.

560
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,875
<i>What will remain of the user</i>

561
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:51,000
<i>if she were to suffer
de-resolution?</i>

562
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:53,000
Nothing, sir.

563
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,250
<i>No trace of her existence
on the Grid?</i>

564
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:57,375
None, sir.

565
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:12,125
<i>Extract the code
and delete the carrier.</i>

566
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:16,458
But, sir, extracting
the Permanence Code

567
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:19,875
would delete the carrier from
the Grid and from your world.

568
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:30,375
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

569
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:32,833
<i>there was a weapon
and its name was Ares.</i>

570
00:51:32,916 --> 00:51:35,708
<i>And Ares obeyed every command
of Julian Dillinger,</i>

571
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:38,375
<i>and Julian Dillinger
made a trillion dollars.</i>

572
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:42,416
And wrote his name
on the face of time in blood.

573
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:45,750
Now, whatever PEBKAC error
is behind these feelings,

574
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:49,083
<i>I'm going to find it
and rip it out of you.</i>

575
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:51,208
<i>Do I make myself clear?</i>

576
00:51:52,916 --> 00:51:54,375
Perfectly.

577
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:56,500
<i>Program dismissed.</i>

578
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:03,875
The creature also said,
"I am fearless,"

579
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,375
"and therefore powerful."

580
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:20,250
Well?

581
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:21,625
The user is indisposed.

582
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:23,333
Hold extraction
until further directive.

583
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:24,750
-Indisposed?
-Correct.

584
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,708
Define indisposed.

585
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:31,416
He's stuck in traffic.

586
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:35,041
No, he's at the opera.

587
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:37,708
He's standing on
the top of Mount Fuji

588
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:38,875
in a pair of green socks

589
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,958
playing "Pistol Packin' Mama"
on the mandolin.

590
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:42,833
I gave you an order.

591
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:44,708
The creator is indisposed.

592
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:48,166
Hold extraction until
we receive further directive.

593
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,166
Do I make myself clear?

594
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:53,125
Yes, sir.

595
00:52:53,791 --> 00:52:55,375
Programs dismissed.

596
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:09,833
Can I trust you?

597
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:12,833
It's a complicated question.
How much time you got?

598
00:53:12,916 --> 00:53:14,042
Sixty seconds. Answer now.

599
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:15,500
Your life cycle depends upon it.

600
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:17,458
I don't have a life cycle.

601
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:20,250
Yes, you do.
For another 54 seconds.

602
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,833
Can I trust you?

603
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:25,750
Um, I'd like to think so,
but probably not.

604
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:37,250
<i>Where is Master Control?</i>

605
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:39,041
Sir, Master Control
is exhibiting

606
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:40,500
signs of malfunction.

607
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,750
Hmm.

608
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:51,625
<i>Any threat to the directive
must be eliminated.</i>

609
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:55,166
<i>Extract the code
and delete them both.</i>

610
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,333
<i>-Do you understand?</i>
-Hmm.

611
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:02,875
-And Julian Dillinger?
-You can't trust him.

612
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:07,000
For him, everyone
and everything is expendable.

613
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:11,291
I miscalculated.

614
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:12,708
We have a new directive.

615
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:17,110
Athena, it doesn't have to
be like this.

616
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,125
Delete him!

617
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:13,291
I'm okay. I'm okay.

618
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:18,363
They're headed
towards the Transfer Portal.

619
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,561
We lost them in the Grid, ma'am.

620
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,500
Preparing the drones.

621
00:56:32,416 --> 00:56:34,875
Delete Ares, and bring
the user back to me.

622
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:35,958
Copy.

623
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:56,958
What happened back there?

624
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:59,166
I disobeyed my directive.

625
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,250
Which was?

626
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,291
To retrieve the code
from your disk

627
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:03,791
and delete the carrier.

628
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:07,666
Dillinger told you to delete me?

629
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:14,416
Hang on!

630
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:18,541
Where are they?

631
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:20,542
Scanning
quadrants three and four.

632
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:21,792
Sector 18 clear.

633
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:26,541
Where are we going?

634
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:28,125
Transfer Portal.

635
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:29,625
It's the only way
out of the Grid.

636
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:32,000
You'll be reconstituted
in the real world

637
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:34,541
exactly as you were before,
hypothetically.

638
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:39,166
-Hypothetically?
-Probably.

639
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:42,014
We have movement in sector 72.

640
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:44,325
<i>Zeroing in on target.</i>

641
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:46,291
Shut them down!

642
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:58,750
You wanna get home,
I can help you.

643
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:01,166
But I need something in return.

644
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,000
I told you
I don't have the code.

645
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:07,333
You found it once,
you can find it again.

646
00:58:07,416 --> 00:58:08,977
So you can give it to Dillinger?

647
00:58:12,416 --> 00:58:13,500
Not for Dillinger.

648
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:15,041
For me.

649
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:19,791
Do we have a deal?

650
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:57,458
So, do we have a deal?

651
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:59,541
Yes. Yes, I know
where to find the code.

652
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:00,796
Just get me out of here.

653
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:11,208
Target
approaching Transfer Portal

654
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:12,416
in 45 seconds.

655
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:45,035
Drones
malfunctioned and offline.

656
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:17,875
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>Please stand clear.</i>

-Who authorized this?

660
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:27,916
Sir, this originated
inside the Grid.

661
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:28,875
Julian?

662

01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:08,666
Well, well, well.

671
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,750
Just got double-crossed
by my program.

672
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:13,958
It wants the Permanence Code
for itself.

673
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,041
Eve, is that the deal?

674
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:18,250
It gets you out of the Grid,

675
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:19,917
you turn Pinocchio
into a real boy?

676
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,125
Well, you're missing the part

677
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:22,500
where you're willing
to commit murder

678
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:23,750
for a piece of software.

679
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:24,833
Is that what it said?

680
01:01:24,916 --> 01:01:26,477
Twenty-eight minutes,
41 seconds.

681
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,458
Ares!

682
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:30,291
I do hope
this works out for you.

683
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:32,583
There's no second chances,
no do-overs.

684
01:01:32,666 --> 01:01:35,791
These are the last 29 minutes
you'll ever have!

685
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:37,541
Better make it count!

686
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:06,291
I should've majored
in English lit.

687
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:25,625
<i>Transfer complete.</i>

688
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:29,417
Your directive is
to find Eve Kim,

689
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,208
return her to the Grid and
get me the Permanence Code.

690
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:34,000
By any means necessary.

691
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:36,958
Do you understand

692
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:39,458
Master Control?

693
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:47,875
At your command, sir.

694
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:49,541
Attagirl.

695
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:11,000
Ticktock!

696
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:13,875
Oh!

697
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,875
Oh!

698
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:18,625
Whoo!

699
01:03:21,291 --> 01:03:25,458
Now that is the coolest thing
I have ever seen.

700
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:41,542
Do you know who Kevin Flynn was?

701
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:44,166
Of course.
Visionary programmer,

702
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,708
pioneer of <i>The Digital Frontier</i>.

703
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:47,500
Disappeared 1989.

704
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:50,083
I found the Permanence Code
on a backup of Flynn's server.

705
01:03:50,166 --> 01:03:53,125
That server is at Encom's
office downtown.

706
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,417
But we can make it within...

707
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,061
Twenty-six minutes,
nine seconds.

708
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:00,083
Eve, your plan contains
two major flaws.

709
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:01,208
Okay.

710
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:03,833
One, Encom is 9.2 miles away,

711
01:04:03,916 --> 01:04:04,917
given our present speed

712
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,833
and suboptimal
choice of vehicle...

713
01:04:06,916 --> 01:04:07,875
Oh, my God.

714
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:09,812
Two, we're gonna need
a particle laser.

715
01:04:11,625 --> 01:04:12,708
We need a phone.

716
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:29,750
I cannot believe I'm doing this.

717
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:34,666
Excuse me. Do you see this?
This is me.

718
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,083
If you let me use
your cell phone,

719
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:38,916
my assistant
will wire you $10,000.

720
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,250
I just need your phone.

721
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,500
Seth, where are you?

722
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:51,333
<i>Eve, whose phone is this?</i>

723
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:54,250
Listen to me. I need you
at Encom in 15 minutes.

724
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:55,583
Hey, is everything okay?

725
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:58,500
Seth, bring the particle laser.

726
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:00,417
<i>Encom, 15 minutes. Got it.</i>

727
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:03,125
That's my car.

728
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:04,333
I'll wire you another 50K.

729
01:05:04,416 --> 01:05:05,666
Hey, that's my car!

730
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,958
The Honda Civic 2.0
four-cylinder

731
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:10,000
with 138 horsepower.

732
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:11,583
Classic.

733
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:13,166
Hey! That's my car!

734
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:15,958
That's my car!

735
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:39,291
God.

736
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:42,708
-Eve?
-Yeah?

737
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:44,875
I was thinking about the time
you told your sister

738
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:47,875
that you wished you never
relaunched <i>Space Paranoids</i>.

739
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:49,208
Then you went on to say that...

740
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:51,417
Oh, my God. Of course.
You read all my texts.

741
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:54,666
Yeah. Yeah, I've read
them all. Every single one.

742
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:55,750
Wow.

743
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:57,792
Most of it was information
of a personal nature.

744
01:05:57,875 --> 01:06:00,166
Some of it, highly personal.

745
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:02,958
And I just can't get enough.

746
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:04,875
What?

747
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:09,750
Depeche Mode. Number eight
on the UK singles chart, 1982.

748
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:11,541
I find their brand of
pithy, catchy,

749
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:13,375
timeless and true
'80s electropop

750
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:16,333
to be deeply invigorating.

751
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:27,375
Sixteen minutes, 20 seconds.

752
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:29,875
Okay. So you like,
uh, '80s pop

753
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:32,375
and, uh, cyber-spying on me.

754
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:34,083
I was directed to kill you, Eve.

755
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:36,541
Hacking seems pretty tame
by comparison.

756
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:41,667
-Oh, my God.
-For the record,

757
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:44,000
I don't think you have
anything to be ashamed of.

758
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,500
<i>Space Paranoids</i> has entertained

759
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:46,791
hundreds of millions.

760
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:48,500
Plus, it's a pretty cool game.

761
01:06:49,291 --> 01:06:51,375
Anyway, you told your sister
that designing games

762
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:53,375
left you feeling hollow, broken.

763
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:54,542
Was it that your work was about

764
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:55,792
entertainment and profits

765
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:58,375
and her work was about
improving the human condition?

766
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:00,458
Your texts suggest
a certain fixation

767
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:02,542
with not being able to live up
to her standards,

768
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:04,250
which must have
been complicated,

769
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:06,667
especially considering
she was the younger sister.

770
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,583
Okay. Watch it.

771
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:11,166
By the way, I don't think
you should quit.

772
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:15,125
What do you mean?

773
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:17,375
Your plan upon returning
from the mountains,

774
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:18,458
if I read you correctly,

775
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:20,167
was to hand over
the Permanence Code to Encom

776
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,958
and then let them figure out
what to do with it next, no?

777
01:07:26,916 --> 01:07:28,583
Yeah. Now I understand.

778
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:30,291
You completed her work

779
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:32,125
as a way to
stay connected to her.

780
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:35,000
Huh.

781
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:36,500
And now what?

782
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:40,875
Being human is hard.

783
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:43,750
The things that make life
great are the same things

784
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:49,125
that make it excruciating,
like love, loss.

785
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:57,958
You must miss her very much.

786
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,333
Hey, hey.

787
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:12,636
What the hell?

788
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:15,290
Whoa.
Check this guy out.

789
01:08:16,541 --> 01:08:18,250
-Well, look who it is!
-Hi.

790
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:19,417
Glad you could join us,
Miss Kim.

791
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,667
People have been wondering
where you've been.

792
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,542
Long time no see. Bit of
a rush, so I'm just gonna...

793
01:08:22,625 --> 01:08:23,458
-Eve.
-Mm-hmm?

794
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:24,858
You gotta bring your badge.

795
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:27,000
Okay, yeah, Jolene...

796
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:30,083
Hello, Jolene. Hi.
Got her badge right here.

797
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:31,291
Okay. His too?

798
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:33,125
Uh, no. He's not with us.

799
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:34,500
-Yes, he is.
-Yes, he is.

800
01:08:39,208 --> 01:08:41,501
Let's start literally
anywhere you'd like. Um...

801
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:44,541
This is my boyfriend, Ares.

802
01:08:45,833 --> 01:08:48,708
No. Master Control
Security Program

803
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:49,875
from Dillinger's Grid.

804
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:52,041
Ares, Seth. Seth, Ares.
Oh, God.

805
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:53,125
Pleasure.

806
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:54,208
Hey, that's nice.

807
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:57,291
Um, so, Ares, like, as in,
the god of war, Ares?

808
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Yeah.

809
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:02,333
Cool. You're Greek.
That's awesome.

810
01:09:02,416 --> 01:09:03,416
So when you say that

811
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,833
he's the security program,
do you mean he's like...

812
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:06,333
-Yeah. He's not human.
-He's not human.

813
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:08,123
-Mm-hmm.
-Originated inside a GPU.

814
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:11,167
Okay. Is this
for the Christmas video?

815
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:15,208
Three minutes to de-resolution.

816
01:09:15,291 --> 01:09:16,458
Can you work with that, Seth?

817
01:09:16,541 --> 01:09:17,541
Yeah.

818
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:20,041
Don't need help, guys.

819
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:21,125
Okay.

820
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,250
Oh, boy.

821
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:32,291
So, this is where
I found the Permanence Code

822
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:33,958
on a backup of this server.

823
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,791
Talk about first gen.

824
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:44,208
Talk about a piece of garbage.
Am I right?

825
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:46,000
That was super insensitive
to your ancestors,

826
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:46,916
and I'm so sorry.

827
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,417
It's gonna take me
a few minutes to set this up.

828
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,708
No rush. Two minutes,
18 seconds.

829
01:09:52,875 --> 01:09:55,042
Soon as the laser's up,
we'll send you into the Grid.

830
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:56,875
Once you're in there, you'll
have to run your own search,

831
01:09:56,958 --> 01:09:59,208
{\an8}but believe me, the Permanence
Code is in there.

832
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:00,500
So what should I expect?

833
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:04,250
Uh, if I were to guess?
Think '80s.

834
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:05,208
'80s.

835
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:07,041
I like the '80s.

836
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:09,416
One minute, 31 seconds.

837
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:11,774
Okay. Come on.

838
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:13,705
Please, help me.

839
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:15,708
Okay, all set.

840
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:16,875
Adapters.

841
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:19,625
Once you locate the code,

842
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:21,916
get to the portal
and we'll bring you out.

843
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,416
I'll activate it
from the outside.

844
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:27,000
Can I trust you?

845
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:31,750
I'd like to think so,

846
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:33,583
-but probably not.
-Probably not.

847
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:35,083
Yeah.

848
01:10:35,166 --> 01:10:37,000
Well, it's a good thing
we don't have trust issues

849
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:38,500
because if we did,
I could imagine that...

850
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:39,583
I could pull the plug

851
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:42,666
and leave you in a Grid less
complex than my smartphone

852
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:44,541
for all eternity.

853
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:46,333
The thought had crossed my mind.

854
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:47,958
{\an8}Mine too.

855
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:49,041
Oh, mine three.

856
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:50,708
Sorry. Just...

857
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,666
Well, here goes nothing.

858
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,708
Or here goes something.

859
01:10:58,333 --> 01:10:59,333
You're right.

860
01:11:00,958 --> 01:11:01,958
I do miss her.

861
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,083
All the time.

862
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:11,666
Athena. She's here.

863
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:17,791
Whoa. What is that?

864
01:11:18,291 --> 01:11:19,625
Athena.

865
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:20,708
Wait. Who?

866
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:23,083
Seth, the laser. The laser!

867
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:25,083
Okay, initiating systems now.

868
01:11:25,166 --> 01:11:26,625
Connecting to the Flynn Grid.

869
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:34,041
Firing up the laser.

870
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:36,916
Wait, what's she doing?

871
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,659
She's waiting for me
to time out...

872
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:41,375
...and then she'll come
for you.

873
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,541
We're almost there. Get ready.

874
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:49,208
Come on.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

875
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:51,208
Ares, move
in front of the laser.

876
01:11:53,791 --> 01:11:55,011
Okay. We're ready.

877
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:57,083
{\an8}What are you doing?

878
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
{\an8}Come on.

879
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,416
Change of plans.

880
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:10,750
-No, no, no!
-No, wait!

881
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:52,971
Well, that actually worked.

882
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:02,541
-He's inside.
-Great.

883
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:11,166
Move!

884
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,291
Eve.

885
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:11,125
Time to get back to the Grid.

886
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:12,208
Leave her alone!

887
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:52,208
You're very persistent, user.

888
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:56,750
What?

889
01:15:59,166 --> 01:16:00,375
Hi.

890
01:16:02,666 --> 01:16:03,916
Did we win?

891
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,333
She'll be back.

892
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:08,833
Ares.

893
01:16:10,041 --> 01:16:11,458
He can't get out.

894
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:38,333
The '80s.

895
01:16:50,333 --> 01:16:51,458
Binary digit.

896
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:54,208
-You're a Bit.
-<i>Yes.</i>

897
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:58,083
I'm looking for something.
Can you help me find it?

898
01:16:58,166 --> 01:16:59,625
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

899
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:15,750
Classic.

900
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:44,791
{\an8}<i>I'm surrounded by
the wide-scale destruction</i>

901
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:46,791
{\an8}<i>caused by tonight's
brazen attack</i>

902
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:48,875
<i>that left local residents
stunned.</i>

903
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:50,958
<i>There is speculation that
Dillinger Systems</i>

904
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,791
<i>had something to do
with the event,</i>

905
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:54,333
<i>and authorities have
remained tight-lipped.</i>

906
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:55,583
<i>Citizens</i>

907
01:17:55,666 --> 01:17:57,125
<i>and authorities alike
want to know...</i>

908
01:17:57,208 --> 01:18:00,958
<i>was this a coordinated attack
or technology run amok?</i>

909
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:02,375
What now?

910
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:19,375
What is this?

911
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:21,541
Where's my code?

912
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:24,083
Hey!

913
01:18:25,041 --> 01:18:27,334
What are you doing?
Who gave you this directive?

914
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:29,333
You did, sir.

915
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:35,875
What is this?

916
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:38,875
<i>Warning.</i>

917
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:41,416
No, no, no.

918
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,125
This is too big, Athena.
Too big!

919
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:44,458
Julian!

920
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:45,750
You're done.

921
01:18:46,291 --> 01:18:47,833
The board is moving as we speak

922
01:18:47,916 --> 01:18:49,083
to strip you of your title,

923
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:51,333
and I'm reassuming control
of the company.

924
01:18:51,416 --> 01:18:53,583
No, you can't do that.
Can't do that!

925
01:18:53,666 --> 01:18:55,291
Yes, I can.

926
01:18:55,375 --> 01:18:57,166
This is not going any further.

927
01:18:58,541 --> 01:18:59,666
You can't...

928
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:01,542
My first order of business
is shutting down

929
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:03,917
-The Permanence Project.
-No, no, no. Mom, no!

930
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:10,750
Don't be afraid.

931
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:14,958
We gave a thousand lives
for the Grid.

932
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:20,458
You only have to give one.

933
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:23,000
No, no, no.

934
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:24,708
Mom!

935
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,250
Impediment eliminated.

936
01:19:33,291 --> 01:19:36,041
What did you do?
What did you do?

937
01:19:37,875 --> 01:19:39,375
I am fulfilling my directive.

938
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:40,875
Capture Eve Kim.

939
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:43,833
Return her to the Grid
by any means necessary.

940
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,875
Scanning
for further impediments.

941
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,409
<i>Please keep clear.</i>

942
01:20:05,041 --> 01:20:06,500
Hang on, Mom. Hang on.

943
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:16,583
No!

944
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:21,875
Flynn.

945
01:21:25,958 --> 01:21:27,583
Greetings, program.

946
01:21:50,791 --> 01:21:52,583
Oh, God. Not good.

947
01:21:52,666 --> 01:21:54,250
<i>There are multiple reports</i>

948
01:21:54,333 --> 01:21:56,250
<i>of fire and destruction
on the upper levels...</i>

949
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:57,375
Um, Eve?

950
01:21:57,875 --> 01:21:59,375
What the hell happened
to our office?

951
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:00,833
Ajay, look, there's no time.

952
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,958
The Dillingers transported me
inside their server

953
01:22:03,041 --> 01:22:04,625
by reversing the direction
of a particle laser.

954
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:07,041
-Not this one. Theirs.
-That's impossible.

955
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:09,916
No. A scary lady did it, man.
She threw me... It was wild.

956
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:12,750
I saw a complex world

957
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:15,041
where packets of energy
move as vehicles

958
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:17,208
that trail by lines of light.

959
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:20,083
And-And programs
take on human form.

960
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:23,916
I met the most advanced AI
known to mankind.

961
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:25,458
His name is Ares.

962
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:27,542
Like the god of war, but he's
actually a super nice guy.

963
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:28,750
-Sorry.
-Right now,

964
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:31,291
Ares is inside
Flynn's original server.

965
01:22:31,375 --> 01:22:32,875
He's looking
for the Permanence Code.

966
01:22:32,958 --> 01:22:34,333
I have to bring him back here,

967
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,458
and I'm not going to be able
to do that

968
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:38,291
until we fix this laser.

969
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,916
I don't understand.
Are you alive?

970
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,500
I exist in this moment
because you do.

971
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:49,458
A reflection of your presence.

972
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:52,708
What's your story?

973
01:22:52,791 --> 01:22:56,416
I'm Ares, Master Control of
the Dillinger Security Grid.

974
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,250
Dillinger?

975
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:00,458
Hmm.

976
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:03,125
Well, we both know
you can't get here from there.

977
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,791
Been someplace else in between?

978
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:11,500
What did you make of it
out there?

979
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:12,792
It's hard to put in a nutshell.

980
01:23:12,875 --> 01:23:14,875
You can say that again.

981
01:23:15,708 --> 01:23:17,416
It's hard to put in a nutshell.

982
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:22,791
Ah, classic. Humor, man.

983
01:23:22,875 --> 01:23:24,166
Oh.

984
01:23:26,625 --> 01:23:28,375
What are you looking for?

985
01:23:29,416 --> 01:23:30,416
Permanence.

986
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:35,833
The Permanence Code,
to be exact.

987
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:38,375
Strange things have
been happening.

988
01:23:38,458 --> 01:23:42,166
I questioned my directive.
I disobeyed my directive.

989
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:44,125
Mmm.

990
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:47,666
A malfunctioning program
who wants to live.

991
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:48,750
Really?

992
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:52,291
What makes you think
I should help you?

993
01:23:52,791 --> 01:23:54,083
No, it's not about me.

994
01:23:55,166 --> 01:23:56,708
Not anymore.

995
01:23:56,791 --> 01:24:00,208
I have a friend in danger,
and she needs my help.

996
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,083
Fascinating.

997
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,708
Fascinating.

998
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:12,458
Hey, Ajay, can you send
the prompt, please?

999
01:24:12,541 --> 01:24:13,541
Sure, yeah.

1000
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:20,791
-Uh, hey, Eve.
-Not now, Seth.

1001
01:24:20,875 --> 01:24:23,125
Okay. Hey, are you sure?

1002
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:25,708
Because that looks like
an actual Recognizer

1003
01:24:25,791 --> 01:24:26,916
flying towards us.

1004
01:24:31,791 --> 01:24:34,041
What in God's name is that?

1005
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:35,041
It's Athena.

1006
01:24:35,666 --> 01:24:36,875
She's back.

1007
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:39,833
As long as the Dillinger
Network is online,

1008
01:24:39,916 --> 01:24:41,041
she'll keep coming.

1009
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:44,291
If she gets me,
she gets the Permanence Code.

1010
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:49,208
The laser. Athena's laser!

1011
01:24:49,833 --> 01:24:52,625
The Dillingers run a wireless
direct link protocol,

1012
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:54,167
so let's use
what's left of the laser

1013
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,750
to ping the network
and trace a path home.

1014
01:24:56,833 --> 01:24:58,208
Once you have a connection,

1015
01:24:58,291 --> 01:25:00,250
then you can nuke
the whole Dillinger Grid.

1016
01:25:00,333 --> 01:25:03,041
And that's the only way
to stop her for good.

1017
01:25:03,708 --> 01:25:04,708
Eve, what are you talking about?

1018
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:05,750
She's right there.

1019
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:11,583
-I gotta go.
-Wait, what?

1020
01:25:11,666 --> 01:25:13,583
I'll keep her away
for as long as I can.

1021
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:15,666
-What?
-I'm gonna buy you some time.

1022
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:17,458
-Eve...
-You guys got this.

1023
01:25:39,666 --> 01:25:40,666
You're right.

1024
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:42,625
I think there is
something wrong with me.

1025
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:46,250
Or maybe there's
something right with you.

1026
01:25:46,833 --> 01:25:48,625
Well, maybe you're
just learning.

1027
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:51,625
That's what we all
ought to be doing.

1028
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:55,291
Back in the day,
when tech was young,

1029
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:58,625
I'd think,
"Damn, we're moving fast."

1030
01:25:59,125 --> 01:26:03,750
You move fast,
you leave stuff behind.

1031
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:07,875
How many people
born in this century

1032
01:26:07,958 --> 01:26:09,583
have even heard of Mozart?

1033
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:11,625
I like Mozart.

1034
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:15,458
Oh?

1035
01:26:16,291 --> 01:26:19,458
That said, if I'm being
honest, I prefer Depeche Mode.

1036
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:24,333
Really? Why is that?

1037
01:26:24,416 --> 01:26:26,500
I know one is considered
the greatest composer

1038
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:28,458
in the history
of Western civilization,

1039
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:30,875
the other a synth pop band
from the '80s,

1040
01:26:30,958 --> 01:26:34,875
but I find their balance
of technological exploration

1041
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:37,250
and pop hooks combined with...

1042
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:39,666
Uh, com... Uh...

1043
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,833
combined with, uh...

1044
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:44,666
What's wrong?

1045
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:48,083
I-I can't put my love
of Depeche Mode into words.

1046
01:26:48,166 --> 01:26:49,958
It's just a...

1047
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:54,500
Hmm? A what?

1048
01:26:56,041 --> 01:26:57,666
A feeling.

1049
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:03,625
Very good.

1050
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:07,416
Very good, man.

1051
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
You...

1052
01:27:26,583 --> 01:27:30,208
You did this.

1053
01:27:35,666 --> 01:27:37,083
<i>And tonight, as military...</i>

1054
01:27:37,166 --> 01:27:38,166
Impressive.

1055
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:40,250
Fully segmented
zero trust architecture.

1056
01:27:40,333 --> 01:27:41,750
Built to be totally impregnable

1057
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:43,687
to vertical, lateral
or hybrid attacks.

1058
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:46,375
Damn it.
Can't get a connection, dude.

1059
01:27:46,458 --> 01:27:47,434
No luck here either.

1060
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:55,250
Please, evacuate the area.

1061
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:22,958
What is that thing?

1062
01:28:23,041 --> 01:28:24,208
-Bring in SWAT!
-Requesting backup.

1063
01:28:26,875 --> 01:28:27,875
Oh, my God.

1064
01:28:28,916 --> 01:28:30,125
Oh, my God!

1065
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:35,000
Come on. A little closer.

1066
01:29:10,208 --> 01:29:12,375
<i>Viper-1 to base.</i>
<i>Tally on hostile.</i>

1067
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:14,125
<i>Confirmed visual ID.</i>

1068
01:29:14,208 --> 01:29:16,833
<i>Engaging Fox-2. Missile away.</i>

1069
01:29:25,416 --> 01:29:27,417
<i>Splash negative.</i>
<i>Missile intercepted.</i>

1070
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,875
<i>Be advised,
enemy fighter escorts inbound</i>

1071
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:31,041

1077
01:29:50,583 --> 01:29:51,875
<i>Viper-1. Punching out.</i>

1078
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:15,875
Uh, guys? Guys.

1079
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:18,540
Oh, my God.
There's hundreds of 'em.

1080
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:21,208
They're going after Eve.

1081
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:22,667
If we can't access
the Dillinger server,

1082
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,083
there's gonna be
nothing left to save.

1083
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:06,875
<i>Base, this is Raven-1.</i>

1084

1087
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:11,083
Ready?

1088
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:15,625
Hope you are, man,
'cause there's no going back.

1089
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,416
Permanence.

1090
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:20,958
Funny.

1091
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:24,708
When I found it,
that's what I called it.

1092
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:28,041
I know better now.

1093
01:32:33,375 --> 01:32:36,541
Ought to be called
the Impermanence Code.

1094
01:32:54,416 --> 01:32:56,875
The back door to my old lab.

1095
01:32:58,791 --> 01:33:00,791
One go-around.

1096
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:03,666
That's all you've got.

1097
01:33:10,875 --> 01:33:12,000
One...

1098
01:33:14,166 --> 01:33:15,458
is all I want.

1099
01:33:16,166 --> 01:33:17,541
Love that!

1100
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:20,458
You keep surprising me!

1101
01:34:24,833 --> 01:34:26,875
We'll do this
from the ground then.

1102
01:35:29,666 --> 01:35:31,958
<i>...and there are reports that
a civilian may be onboard,</i>

1103
01:35:32,041 --> 01:35:34,541
<i>making this
a possible hostage scenario.</i>

1104
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:37,125
Athena.
She must've gotten Eve.

1105
01:35:37,208 --> 01:35:38,769
<i>...into the mountains.</i>

1106
01:35:39,958 --> 01:35:41,333
Hey, hey, hey!

1107
01:35:48,833 --> 01:35:50,735
Soon we'll be back
on the Grid.

1108
01:36:55,916 --> 01:36:57,333
<i>General, thank you</i>
<i>for taking the time...</i>

1109
01:36:57,416 --> 01:36:58,875
<i>...to speak with us tonight.</i>

1110
01:36:58,958 --> 01:37:00,666
Hey, Erin. Seth.

1111
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,583
Stop the clock.

1112
01:37:05,375 --> 01:37:07,000
No way. You're in?

1113
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:09,668
There's a reason why I have
the corner office, my man.

1114
01:37:15,041 --> 01:37:16,041
Hey.

1115
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:22,333
You came back.

1116
01:37:24,416 --> 01:37:25,458
How did you...

1117
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:27,882
Let's just say I had
a little help from a friend.

1118
01:37:30,083 --> 01:37:32,583
Wait, the Dillinger Grid...

1119
01:37:33,666 --> 01:37:35,333
Ajay and Seth, they...

1120
01:37:51,625 --> 01:37:52,916
-Go.
-No.

1121
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,625
Ares!

1122
01:37:58,333 --> 01:37:59,375
What have you done?

1123
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:01,166
You're out of time, Athena.

1124
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:02,875
And you're out of lives.

1125
01:38:02,958 --> 01:38:04,833
I'll kill you
and come back for her.

1126
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:18,791
It's you she wants.

1127
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:20,924
If she gets the code,
she can't be stopped.

1128
01:38:22,833 --> 01:38:23,833
You had everything.

1129
01:38:23,916 --> 01:38:25,333
-Go.
-No.

1130
01:38:25,416 --> 01:38:27,791
The most advanced,
the most powerful,

1131
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:29,208
and you gave it away.

1132
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:31,250
For her?

1133
01:38:31,333 --> 01:38:32,541
Go!

1134
01:38:33,791 --> 01:38:35,583
This is the end for you.

1135
01:39:21,166 --> 01:39:22,666
Payload ready for transfer.

1136
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:24,791
Shipping it.

1137
01:39:26,625 --> 01:39:27,875
Let's hope Eve was right.

1138
01:39:29,166 --> 01:39:31,916
<i>Alert.</i>
<i>Unknown file incoming.</i>

1139
01:39:42,708 --> 01:39:44,458
In pursuit of this life
for yourself,

1140
01:39:44,541 --> 01:39:47,208
did you once consider
what that meant for the Grid?

1141
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:38,708
We were given an order.
It is our purpose.

1142
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:02,250
It's not our purpose.

1143
01:41:03,333 --> 01:41:04,541
It's our programming.

1144
01:41:05,666 --> 01:41:08,750
Our purpose is yet
to be determined.

1145
01:41:31,708 --> 01:41:32,916
It's over.

1146
01:41:35,708 --> 01:41:37,375
And there's no coming back.

1147
01:41:41,333 --> 01:41:42,333
No.

1148
01:41:43,916 --> 01:41:44,916
Not this time.

1149
01:41:53,458 --> 01:41:54,625
They did it.

1150
01:41:56,041 --> 01:41:57,375
Oh, my...

1151
01:42:04,916 --> 01:42:06,416
I followed my directive.

1152
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:08,000
I know.

1153
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:11,416
And now...

1154
01:42:12,625 --> 01:42:13,875
what is yours?

1155
01:42:19,583 --> 01:42:21,208
I'm not sure.

1156
01:42:22,958 --> 01:42:24,791
I guess we'll see.

1157
01:42:47,833 --> 01:42:48,958

1164
01:43:01,416 --> 01:43:04,833
<i>and many are pointing directly

1165
01:43:04,916 --> 01:43:07,291
<i>Agents have been deployed

1166
01:43:07,375 --> 01:43:10,708
<i>as well as his mother,

<i>the wide-scale destruction.</i>

1172
01:43:35,833 --> 01:43:38,666
Julian Dillinger,
this is the police.

1173
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:40,416
We have you surrounded.

1174
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,695
Open the door and come out
with your hands up.

1175
01:43:49,625 --> 01:43:51,541
Come on.

1176
01:43:59,375 --> 01:44:00,625
Breach!

1177
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:03,583

1178
01:44:05,625 --> 01:44:07,083

01:44:29,833 --> 01:44:30,833
Are you good?

1185
01:44:30,916 --> 01:44:33,958
Oh, I think
I broke a rib.

1186
01:44:39,416 --> 01:44:40,879
You still gonna quit your job?

1187
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:46,208
No, I'm not gonna quit anything.

1188
01:44:46,291 --> 01:44:47,458
Good.

1189
01:44:48,041 --> 01:44:49,041
Good.

1190
01:44:49,125 --> 01:44:51,125
I have some ideas.

1191
01:44:52,166 --> 01:44:53,750
Oh, yeah? Nice.

1192
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,083
Well, the world needs you, Eve.

1193
01:44:57,916 --> 01:44:59,583
The Grid needs you.

1194
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,083
Yeah. It's funny, permanence.

1195
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:06,875
A wise man once told me

1196
01:45:06,958 --> 01:45:09,397
it should have been called
the "Impermanence Code."

1197
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,166
I guess that's
the thing about life.

1198
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:15,666
There's nothing
quite permanent about it.

1199
01:45:19,041 --> 01:45:20,208
No.

1200
01:45:20,291 --> 01:45:22,291
No, there isn't.

1201
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:26,083
Yeah.

1202
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:38,750
So where are you gonna go?

1203
01:45:40,458 --> 01:45:41,750
I have some ideas.

1204
01:45:41,833 --> 01:45:42,833

<i>Pun intended.</i>

01:47:27,875 --> 01:47:31,166
<i>In my travels,

<i>Despite its wonder and beauty,</i>

1233

<i>I've come to realize
that life is...</i>

1234
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:39,750
<i>Well, it's hard
to put in a nutshell.</i>

1235
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,666
<i>Some days,

<i>For now,</i>

<i>"Maybe what emerges
