1
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,323
<i>Horsemen! Horsemen!</i>

2
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:41,226
<i>Horsemen! Horsemen!</i>

3
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,114
<i>Horsemen! Horsemen!
Horsemen! Horsemen!</i>

4
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,167
<i>Did you think
we abandoned you?</i>

5
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,324
<i>Or that we'd run out of magic?</i>

6
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,177
<i>Well, think again,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

7
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,279
<i>because you are
about to be amazed.</i>

8
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:06,351
<i>If you're here right now,
then you have</i>

9
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,336
<i>followed the clues
and cracked the code.</i>

10
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,989
<i>Congratulations, and welcome.</i>

11
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,697
<i>It's been 10 years since
the horseman last appeared,</i>

12
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,065
<i>but we are back!</i>

13
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:27,172
Okay, so, come in close.
Mm, closer.

14
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:28,939
Because the more
you think you see,

15
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,209
the easier it will be
to dress up old tricks

16
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,877
and fool you that they are new.

17
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:37,048
So, my name is
J. Daniel Atlas,

18
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:39,084
and allow me
to speak as I often do

19
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,819
for my less charismatic
colleagues when I say...

20
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,888
Whoo! It is very good
to be back!

21
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,161
Yes. Yes.
We vanished for a while,

22
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,362
but in the world of magic,

23
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,031
everything that disappears,
reappears.

24
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,114
Well, at least
if the trick is done right.

25
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,907
I'm Merritt McKinney.

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,344
Unlike my, uh, very good
buddy here, Danny,

27
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:10,348
most of you checked your egos
at the door tonight.

28
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:13,551
You found this
little underground soiree

29
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,254
because you wanted
to get fooled.

30
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:18,156
Hey, everyone.
I'm Jack Wilder.

31
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,863
Wars, pandemics,
climate change, AI.

32
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,916
Let's face it, we all need
magic more than ever.

33
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:33,371
So I want you to pay
very close attention.

34
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:35,698
You are not gonna want
to miss this next trick.

35
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,680
Henley Reeves,
now Henley Reeves Stanley.

36
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,750
Three kids, two dogs
and a master's degree.

37
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,084
It's been a while.

38
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,286
Did you miss us?

39
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,791
Those guys were great
back in the day.

40
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,726
I used to want to be a magician.

41
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,196
And then I turned 12.

42
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:00,731
Careful,
they might be listening.

43
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,367
Ooh, I'm shaking
in my AllSaints.

44
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,602
What are they gonna do?

45
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,304
Is that real gold?

46
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,439
-What?
-Is that real gold?

47
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,708
Yeah, I'm rich.

48
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,877
This is a magic show, dude.

49
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,879
Every fool here is a pickpocket,

50
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,147
or a pickpocket's fool.

51
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,951
-Was that a haiku?
-What was that?

52
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,587
Each of you
just received a playing card.

53
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,490
If you wouldn't mind, uh,
pulling it out?

54
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,392
Right. Now, we're gonna
shuffle the deck,

55
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:29,927
so everybody find
a random person near them

56
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,762
and switch cards with them.

57
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,298
And then when you've done that,

58
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:36,000
find somebody else
and switch with them.

59
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,735
Okay, great. Uh, now...

60
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,770
Uh, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh...
You there, down there.

61
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,472
-Me?
-Yeah. What is your card?

62
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,974
-Ace of diamonds.
-Ace of diamonds. Okay.

63
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,810
Let's make things a little
more complicated here.

64
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,913
Does anybody else here
have the ace of diamonds?

65
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,781
Wait, it's me.
Ace of diamonds!

66
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,851
Ooh!

67
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,188
Looks like we have a Fifth
Horseman not named Lula.

68
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,957
Come up on stage,
you're gonna be our helper.

69
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,413
-Do it!
-Yeah, go!

70
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:13,838
Now, uh, look into my eyes

71
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,541
and... sleep.

72
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:19,310
Still got it.

73
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,812
Now, this might look like
an ordinary kid to you,

74
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,816
but tonight, he is going
to do extraordinary magic

75
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,219
like a man possessed.

76
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,554
Literally.

77
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,556
-Henley.
-Yes, Merritt.

78
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,059
Would you mind
stepping inside his body?

79
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,162
Yep. And, Jack, uh,

80
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,531
why don't you throw yourself
on in there, too?

81
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,233
What I do best.

82
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:45,636
And... Oh, God help you.

83
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,656
Atlas, why don't you
slither on inside, as well?

84
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,345
And I might as well
wedge myself in there, too.

85
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,981
It takes a village
to make magic.

86
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,722
-Oh!
-Whoa!

87
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,491
J. Daniel Atlas in the house.

88
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:08,426
So, who wants
to see a magic trick?

89
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:14,648
Take it away, Merritt.

90
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,737
Hello, you beautiful people.

91
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,040
Now, everyone knows that
Merritt McKinney reads minds.

92
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:27,211
Well, now, I'm him.
Or he's me. Who knows?

93
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:32,417
Uh, I'm sensing
someone came here tonight

94
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,253
not to enjoy magic,
but to tear it down.

95
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,591
Is there a Brett Finnegan
in the house?

96
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,560
What up?

97
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,065
Now, you and your friends here

98
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,235
set up the
Camp Hobart Crypto Exchange.

99
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,903
-Fact. Yep. Yeah.
-It's what we're about.

100
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,539
Took the good people
of New York's

101
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:57,575
employee pension and
welfare fund half its cash.

102
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,377
Uh, you're rounding up,

103
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,812
and also, the risks were
laid out very clearly.

104
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,714
Everybody knew what
they were getting into, dude.

105
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,950
Did you hide
the profits offshore?

106
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,718
Account ending

107
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:12,990
in 53297?

108
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,377
You couldn't know that
without my, uh...

109
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,264
Oh, is this real gold?

110
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,233
Brett, you ought
to be more careful

111
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,602
with your things, man.

112
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,671
Merritt's a psychic,
but me, Jack,

113
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:27,905
I'm into sleight of hand.

114
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,273
Ask your friends.

115
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,642
They've just done their part
to close the wealth gap.

116
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,644
What? What the...

117
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,514
Now, here's
a little redistribution.

118
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,082
Hey! Hey, hey!

119
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,988
Thank you. Thank you.

120
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,322
Lawyer up, dude!
I'll kick your ass!

121
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,924
Uh-oh!

122
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,527
Someone forgot Henley can fly.

123
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,642
We can take it from here,
but a round of applause

124
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,477
for the best Horseman on stage.

125
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,146
Whoo! Wow.

126
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,581
Hey, hey,
hey. Hey, hey.

127
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,518
Fantastic. So, everybody,
I want you to take your drink,

128
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,454
and I want you to pour it
onto the face of your card.

129
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,823
Can you do that?

130
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:21,526
Those 12 unique words
on each of your cards

131
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,994
form the password
to your new crypto wallet.

132
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,463
-Oh!
-Log on

133
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:28,198
and you'll find Brett's
stolen millions more...

134
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,567
fairly redistributed.

135
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,070
Oh, my God. Fifty...
50,000 bucks!

136
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,539
50,000!

137
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,343
You're freaking done, dude!

138
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:42,179
Whoa, whoa!
Cool your head, gingerbread,

139
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,014
'cause I am having a vision.

140
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:48,085
Eh, maybe cops are gonna come
bursting through that door!

141
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,854
So perform a magic trick
of your own

142
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:53,707
and disappear
in three, two, one.

143
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:12,176
<i>Now come in close. Mm, closer.</i>

144
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,879
<i>Because the more you think
you see, the easier it will be</i>

145
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,180
<i>-to dress up old tricks...</i>
-What?

146
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,748
<i>...and fool you
that they are new.</i>

147
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,934
Oh, my God, no.

148
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:22,687
No!

149
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,605
No!

150
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:43,307
Look, in my opinion,
I think you did a great job.

151
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,142
Uh, I think my Atlas was good.

152
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,477
My Merritt could
probably use some work.

153
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,713
-Mm.
-It's like a San Diego stoner

154
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:50,414
and a shrimp boat captain
had a baby.

155
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:51,916
Sure.

156
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,918
No, seriously, Bosco,
I don't know how you do it.

157
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,086
A good impersonation
isn't just about the mimicry.

158
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,122
It's about attention to detail,

159
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,724
personality and nuance.

160
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,391
Okay. Okay.
Let me try, let me try.

161
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,928
Um...
I'm J. Daniel Atlas.

162
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,897
The closer
you look, the less you see.

163
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,998
It was something.

164
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,466
Yep. Uh, you'll work on it.

165
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,668
-I wasn't bad.
-It was a good start.

166
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,537
-But it could use some work.
-Okay, sure.

167
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,338
-What do you keep looking at?
-Nothing, nothing, nothing.

168
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,307
Dude, cheer up.
Guys, come on! Look at us!

169
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,745
Look at how far we've come.
We totally scored tonight.

170
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:22,680
All right, next time,
you wear the pink wig, okay?

171
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,448
No.

172
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:27,017
-Dude, it's locked again.
-Okay, I'll pick it.

173
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,686
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
Do the thing.

174
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:29,854
-No.
-Please do the thing.

175
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,088
-It's so unnecessary.
-It's so cool.

176
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,489
-I'll hold your bag.
-It's so unnecessary.

177
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,107
-Come on, it's fun.
-Okay.

178
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,883
You got this.

179
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:49,206
-She's like a little Mario.
-She is like Mario.

180
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,041
-Careful, careful.
-Please don't die.

181
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,793
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

182
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,514
If I could do that,
I would only do that.

183
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,349
-It's so cool.
-It's insane.

184
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,651
Happy?

185
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:01,986
-Yeah, that was awesome.
-Yeah.

186
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,054
Please let us in.
It's cold.

187
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,990
Whoo.

188
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,858
Best apartment
in the whole city.

189
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,294
Yep, and no one
will ever see it but us.

190
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,965
<i>♪ Everybody... ♪</i>

191
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,249
It's such a shame.

192
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,638
<i>♪ But in my armor
I am a man... ♪</i>

193
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,428
<i>Come in close.</i>

194
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,507
<i>Closer.</i>

195
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,011
That guy is so screwed.

196
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,247
Who's rich now?

197
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,282
Charlie, can you turn
that thing off, please?

198
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,751
I think I've had
enough Atlas for one night.

199
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:34,852
Yeah, I got you.

200
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,553
<i>...disappears, reappears.</i>

201
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,488
<i>At least
if the trick is done right.</i>

202
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,691
Bosco, can you check
for pizza? I'm so hungry.

203
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,059
Ugh, me, too.

204
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,493
<i>We are the Four Horsemen!</i>

205
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,896
No pizza,
but we got beer.

206
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,798
-And, no, literally just beer.
<i>-Closer. Because</i>

207
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,299
<i>-the more you think you see...</i>
-Any takers?

208
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,301
Yeah, I'll have one.

209
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,737
Dude, seriously,
turn that thing off.

210
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,438
I did.

211
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,441
Okay. Real funny, guys.
Where's the other projector?

212
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,542
I'm not a hologram.

213
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,544
"I'm not a hologram."
Right. Yes.

214
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,462
Exactly what
a hologram would say.

215
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,783
-Oh, my God, you're real.
-Never touch my face again.

216
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,284
I'm so sorry. I thought
that you were a hologram.

217
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,119
I would never do that.
I'm a huge fan of yours.

218
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,420
How are you?

219
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,790
How did you find us?

220
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,625
I don't know.
Took me about 30 seconds.

221
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,093
And if it was this easy
for me to find you,

222
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,895
how hard would it be
for the police?

223
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:20,197
-Whoa, hold on, the police?
-Yeah, the police.

224
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,099
Why would the police
be looking for us?

225
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,200
Uh, I don't know,
what about that

226
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,568
little heist you just pulled?

227
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,037
Or the fact that you're
squatting in this place

228
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,138
or that your electricity
comes from

229
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,640
the circuit box in the corner?

230
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,776
I don't know, it could be
anything. Am I right, Bozo?

231
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,310
Bosco.

232
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,712
-Hmm.
-Bosco Leroy.

233
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,114
Ah, that's right, yeah,
Bosco Leroy.

234
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,315
What, did you type, uh,

235
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,284
"fictional magician name"
into ChatGPT?

236
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,952
No, that's actually
my real name, Atlas.

237
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,087
Hmm.

238
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,388
What, did your mom
have sex with a map?

239
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,726
-That's not funny.
-Hmm.

240
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:49,994
You don't know
anything about us, dude.

241
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,662
-I know everything about you.
-Oh.

242
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,331
The dubiously named Bosco Leroy,

243
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:55,833
a promising acting career

244
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,902
cut short
by crippling student loans.

245
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,469
It's a bummer you had to
drop out of Juilliard,

246
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,172
but you never
stopped performing.

247
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,241
Uh, if memory serves,
your last paid gig,

248
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,310
I think, was dressing as Elmo
in Times Square?

249
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,145
Okay, first of all,
I was never Elmo.

250
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,279
It's the red Teletubby.

251
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,148
Po!

252
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,750
-What?
-The red Teletubby.

253
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,984
-Her name is Po.
-Oh, Po!

254
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,119
She's my favorite one.

255
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:16,186
Right?

256
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,538
-Her name is Po.
-Cute.

257
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,491
And you, June Rouclere.

258
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,993
Kicked out
of every boarding school

259
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,695
your parents
forced you to attend.

260
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,396
Not a big fan
of authority, I take it.

261
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,765
Uh, let me guess.

262
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,867
Uh, you think the "olds"
broke the planet

263
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,969
and it's your generation's
duty to clean up their mess.

264
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,854
-Am I right?
-Am I wrong?

265
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:35,940
No.

266
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,374
And so, you ran away from home,

267
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,710
made your way to New York,
where you ran into this guy

268
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,012
at Tannin's Magic Shop,
Charlie Gayes.

269
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,148
-Yeah, hi.
-Yeah, hi.

270
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,682
I actually couldn't find
a lot about you online.

271
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,317
Although, I do know
you were an orphan and

272
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,353
you were in and out of foster
care your entire childhood,

273
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,687
and that you didn't know
the meaning of family

274
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,356
until you hooked up
with these two.

275
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,558
And so, the three of you
have been working

276
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,326
your little Robin Hood act
for years now,

277
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,228
trying to change the world
one trick at a time,

278
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:01,565
all leading to your riskiest
theft to date, my identity.

279
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:02,666
You were there?

280
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,068
You had our faces plastered

281
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,836
on every scaffolding
and subway stop in the city.

282
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,204
That's copyright infringement,
by the way.

283
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,238
Of course I was there.

284
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,323
So, what'd you think?

285
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,676
I think your Merritt needs work.

286
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,978
-I knew it.
-That's a sensitive topic.

287
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,412
-You don't even get it.
-No. He's lying.

288
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,814
But overall design
was impressive.

289
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,849
And that's you, I assume,
the quiet guy?

290
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,550
-Textbook, behind the scenes.
-Yeah, well,

291
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,919
-Alexander Herrmann...
-Oh, boy.

292
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,754
...he said that the people
who designed his tricks

293
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,155
were the real geniuses.

294
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,557
The fact that you know
that man's name,

295
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,493
"behind the scenes" clearly.

296
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,728
And you, your sleight of hand
was advanced. Good dexterity.

297
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,831
You're quick and nimble on your
feet. Really, I was impressed.

298
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,599
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

299
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,067
Sounds like we're pretty great.

300
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,535
You're far from it.

301
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:42,506
But, uh, maybe with a little
fine tuning, you could be.

302
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,009
Yeah, I could... I could see
why The Eye sent me to you.

303
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,510
-I'm sorry.
-Wait, did you say "The Eye"?

304
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:47,660
Yeah, The Eye.

305
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,981
All right, listen.

306
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:54,351
This card arrived at my
apartment three weeks ago,

307
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,685
along with four plane tickets

308
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,221
and instructions
hidden in the lining

309
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:58,588
for a trick bigger and better

310
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,125
than anything
you have ever seen.

311
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,528
A trick that, for some reason,
includes the three of you.

312
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,863
-Us?
-Mm-hmm.

313
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,564
-Why not the other Horsemen?
-No,

314
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,866
-the other horsemen are dead.
-What?

315
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,734
To me, they're dead to me.
Stop interrupting.

316
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,303
No, things got emotional.
Everyone quit.

317
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,372
I took a walkabout in Australia.
It's a long story.

318
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,075
And now you need us?

319
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,559
According to that card, yes.

320
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:21,979
Well, we don't need you, so...

321
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,447
Bosco.

322
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,149
What? What do we need this
guy for? We're crushing it.

323
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,583
You're crushing it?
You're stealing

324
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,918
a little money
from some crypto bro.

325
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,120
I'm talking about
big fish here, man.

326
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,421
I'm talking
about something that will

327
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,990
make a real difference.

328
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,191
I thought that's what
you kids are all about.

329
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:35,292
It is. No, exactly.

330
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,493
Yes, we are.

331
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,129
Yeah, but I think we can
catch our own fish.

332
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,664
-You can?
-No, no, he...

333
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:41,731
-Good luck with that.
-What? No.

334
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,333
Can you just wait one second?

335
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,468
What are you doing?
What's... what's going on?

336
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,802
Are you out of your mind?

337
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,939
-This is J. Daniel Atlas.
-Yeah, I know who he is.

338
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,274
He's a freaking legend.

339
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,309
He was a legend.
Now he's just kind of a dick.

340
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,677
-Can you...
-Yeah, sure.

341
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,613
Bosco, he's kind of a dick,
but he is a Horseman.

342
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,917
I mean, come on,
just trust us on this, please.

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,452
Okay. Decision time, kids.
What's it gonna be?

344
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,988
Are you in...

345
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,022
...or are you out?

346
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,298
What's the trick?

347
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,976
Welcome,
esteemed community members,

348
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:29,379
valued press,
friends and colleagues.

349
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,182
We are gathered here
tonight to celebrate

350
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,818
Vanderberg's latest
and greatest mine,

351
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,554
C3, or as we like to call her,

352
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:41,291
"Amahle," Zulu
for "The Beautiful One."

353
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,227
Because every child is beautiful

354
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,728
in the eyes of its mother.

355
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:48,032
Our customer can rest assured

356
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:51,801
that when they buy the world's
greatest symbol of love

357
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,704
that it was produced
with nothing but.

358
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,375
To Amahle, and to all of you.

359
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,747
Well, thank you all so much
for making the trip out here.

360
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,351
Now, I take it you were
all impressed by Amahle.

361
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,053
Sorry, C3.

362
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,521
-Oh, it's quite dramatic.
-Yeah, it's amazing.

363
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,357
But I also understand
that you have chosen

364
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,260
this fine day
to broach some concerns,

365
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:19,312
which, contrary to your
expectations, I don't begrudge.

366
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,698
Fire away.

367
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:24,734
Right. Well, um,
the board feels that

368
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,437
projections
might be optimistic...

369
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,738
Mm.

370
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,440
...with increasing competition
from lab grown

371
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,841
and, in the event
borrowing rates plum...

372
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,810
William. William.

373
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,912
My father loved you,
but there was

374
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,265
a reason he called you
his dark cloud.

375
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,384
Aw, shame.

376
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,053
The Vanderberg family
does not lose.

377
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,655
As you're well aware,
our motor sports team just won

378
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,875
the Monaco Championship
for the seventh time.

379
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,878
The mine will produce.

380
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:53,713
Next?

381
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,066
Right.

382
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,534
Pricing. The minimums
that you've set for...

383
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:58,802
Will you humor me, William?

384
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,738
In a demonstration
about reality?

385
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:06,476
This diamond is say, what,
55 carats?

386
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,663
The AWDC would price it
at 3,000,000 US dollars.

387
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,251
William, will you
open your mouth

388
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,735
and stick out your tongue?

389
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,090
Now.

390
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,877
-Really?
-Really.

391
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,806
Now, if William here
were to swallow it,

392
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,477
that selfsame diamond would
tear his throat to shreds.

393
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,496
He would bleed to death
before paramedics arrived.

394
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,816
So, to the AWDC, it's 3,000,000,

395
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,336
but to William, priceless.

396
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,257
Tell me then,
as the CEO responsible

397
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,692
for the world's
last great diamond mines,

398
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,627
should I undercut our profits,

399
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,329
or should I choose prices

400
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,048
that I know
our unique clients will pay?

401
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,372
As I thought.

402
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,809
Now...

403
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:16,180
...unless there are
more concerns,

404
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:19,399
I would like to head
to Antwerp with my price list

405
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,735
and show off our stones.

406
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,626
Oh, uh, you know,
you probably could have led

407
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:30,960
with a free trip to Europe?

408
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,362
You know,
a little known fact

409
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,697
about Antwerp is that...

410
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,165
Oh, great, more magic
trivia. This is fun.

411
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,233
No, I was
just gonna say that

412
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,634
they make great biscuits.

413
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,136
Oh, do they? Can we
actually get some, please?

414
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,570
-On Atlas, obviously.
-No.

415
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,206
No, no, I'm not
getting you biscuits.

416
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,308
I just got you chocolates, okay?

417
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,076
All right, listen,
this is not a vacation, okay?

418
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,145
We have three days
to prepare an effect

419
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,247
that'll make your barely
passable Pepper's Ghost trick

420
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,731
look like a cave painting.

421
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,000
All right, come here.

422
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,789
The Heart Diamond, the most
valuable jewel in history

423
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,459
and the foundation of the
Vanderberg Mining Corporation.

424
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,930
<i>Now, for years, the family's
kept this big rock</i>

425
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,765
<i>hidden inside
their secret vault,</i>

426
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,535
<i>70 stories underground.</i>

427
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:15,239
<i>And not just any ground.
The Arabian Desert.</i>

428
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,602
<i>No one beyond their most
trusted team has been inside.</i>

429
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,190
<i>Access through
a single elevator,</i>

430
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,692
<i>constantly monitored
by armed guards...</i>

431
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,728
Identity verified.

432
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:39,929
<i>...and behind
a multi-level</i>

433
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,631
<i>biometric security system.</i>

434
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,075
<i>But the world will be watching,</i>

435
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:55,279
<i>because for the first time
in half a century,</i>

436
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,597
<i>that diamond is
being traveled here</i>

437
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,251
to Antwerp,
to establish credibility

438
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,986
and to spur bidding
at a private auction

439
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,589
for the company's latest finds
in three days' time.

440
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:06,890
Okay, obviously,
I'm down for stealing.

441
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,625
But what makes
this diamond so special?

442
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,395
Well, because the magical tarot
card told us to, June, right?

443
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:13,463
Yeah, okay, that's very cute.
But can I please finish?

444
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,299
You're not finished? Jeez,
you've been talking forever.

445
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,466
Yes, and I'm about to talk more.

446
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,101
So, please, pay attention.

447
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:20,170
For decades, first,
Peter Vanderberg,

448
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,605
now his daughter, Veronika,

449
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,740
have been selling these
diamonds at inflated prices

450
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,676
to arms dealers, traffickers,
warlords the world over,

451
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,612
to, like,
help launder their money.

452
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,180
So, I mean, the cash is dirty.

453
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,416
I mean, in some cases, it's,
like, literally blood-soaked.

454
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:33,850
But then, <i>voila...</i>

455
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,685
...it's cleaned in exchange
for these precious stones.

456
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,755
She makes all the world's
worst people possible.

457
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,191
So, whoever
sent that tarot card...

458
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:43,860
Are the few truly honorable
people left in this world.

459
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,795
The only people that
still care about justice.

460
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,297
They're people I haven't
spoken to in a long time.

461
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,299
They call themselves "The Eye,"

462
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:50,534
and they want us to do something

463
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,080
that the Horsemen never could.

464
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:53,637
This, man,

465
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,439
this is a chance
to drive a stake

466
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:57,106
through the heart
of the devil herself.

467
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,375
Let's do it.

468
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:02,512
All eyes
will be on me

469
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,514
and the Heart
tonight at the auction.

470
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,283
I have to look dazzling.

471
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,051
Do you have
that Kitten Kiss color?

472
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,705
Lethabo.

473
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,158
-Yes?
-Straw.

474
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:18,528
Who's that British photographer
from <i>Vanity Fair?</i>

475
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,613
Uh, what's his name again?
Marc...

476
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:22,332
Marc Scriber?

477
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,033
-Schreiber, good God.
-Schreiber.

478
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,069
Confirm him, cancel the others.

479
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:29,239
We went wide last year.
This year, exclusivity.

480
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:31,241
-All right.
-We're open, transparent.

481
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,709
We have nothing to hide.

482
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,061
Okay, perfect.
I'll have it done.

483
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,414
This is Veronika.

00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,349
<i>♪ Hush little baby ♪</i>

485
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,933

<i>♪ Papa's gonna buy you

493
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,733
This is a private line,
and that was a bit tone deaf.

494
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,569
I asked who you are.

495
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,105
<i>Ah, Veronika.</i>

496
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:04,173
<i>The storage unit to your left.</i>

497
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,335
<i>Look familiar?</i>

498
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:21,307
<i>It belonged to that boy
who died 15 years ago.</i>

499
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,761
This means nothing
to me or anyone.

500
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:25,929
<i>Really?</i>

501
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,114
<i>You and I both know
what you did.</i>

502
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,035
Look, if you have real evidence

503
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,854
and you're out to get me,
why not just use it?

504
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:40,377
<i>Fifteen years ago, you took
what your father loved most.</i>

505
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,580
<i>Now I'm going to do
the same to you.</i>

506
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:46,265
<i>I want the Heart Diamond.</i>

507
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,835
<i>You're going to give it to me.</i>

508
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,121
<i>Or I'm going to
hold up a looking glass</i>

509
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,507
<i>for the whole world
to see you as you are.</i>

510
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,478
Go ahead.
I have nothing to hide.

511
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,146
-Oh, my God.
-Hey.

512
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,400
I'm so sorry about that.

513
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:20,884
Hi. Can you
help me find this?

514
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,185
I've been looking
literally for an hour.

515
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,317
Yes. It's gonna be
right over there, ma'am.

516
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,853
Marc Schreiber, James Winn,
Vanderberg PR.

517
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,974
Huge admirer of your work.

518
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,710
James?
What happened to Dani?

519
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:49,278
Oh, Dani. Yeah, sadly,
we had to let her go.

520
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,147
Turns out she was racist.

521
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,984
And also, she booked you
into the Radisson Blu

522
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:58,221
-in a partial view, double.
-Ugh.

523
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:01,140
Thankfully, I took the liberty
of moving you to the FRANQ.

524
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,394
I do love the FRANQ.

525
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:08,364
Yes, the presidential suite
is befitting of, well,

526
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,234
presidents and talented
photographers like yourself.

527
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,503
Uh, your gala invitation
has been rerouted.

528
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,488
If I could just check
your confirmation?

529
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,242
Thank you.

530
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:21,344
I also bumped your shoot
from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m.

531
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:23,763
to give you proper time
to make your magic.

532
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,099
-Someone gets it.
-Yeah.

533
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,424
<i>♪ I'm shinin' like a supernova ♪</i>

534
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:37,910
<i>♪ With my hands up high
And my heart wide open... ♪</i>

535
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:43,967
<i>♪ I shine even more bright
Like a diamond ♪</i>

536
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,236
<i>♪ Brush that fear
right off my shoulder... ♪</i>

537
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,440
Take, for instance, diamonds
created in laboratories.

538
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:52,108
They purport to have value,

539
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,377
but they're neither
natural nor rare.

540
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,280
What honest woman wants
a falsehood on her finger?

541
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:58,482
I agree.

542
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:00,183
One of the great truths left

543
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:02,519
is the power
behind a natural gem.

544
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:05,021
Real diamonds
fill people with passion,

545
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:06,590
as they have for centuries.

546
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,157
That's right.
In fact, Marie-Antoinette,

547
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,093
wore the Hope Diamond
for a single day,

548
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,260
and a month later...

549
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,629
...was dragged
to the guillotine

550
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:14,598
by some very, well,
as you say, passionate folks.

551
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,967
Marie-Antoinette didn't
die because of a diamond.

552
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,303
She died because of
a monstrous lack of empathy.

553
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,605
Well...

554
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,907
And truth is,
she never even wore the Hope.

555
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,308
People just believe she did.

556
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:26,776
Really?
That's kind of interesting.

557
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,377
So it was not the mob
that killed her,

558
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,613
and it was not the guillotine,

559
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,463
it was a... a story.

560
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,317
I must not know
my own guest list.

561
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,919
Are you in the diamond business?

562
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:38,387
No, no, I'm in the
illusion business, like you.

563
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,825
See, for centuries,
diamonds were worthless

564
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:43,893
until some very smart,
very rich people

565
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,129
like Veronika here,
told us that, not only

566
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,464
are these little shards
of glass rare,

567
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,166
but that
no self-respecting couple

568
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,535
could possibly get married
without one.

569
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,770
No, now, that one is
a good magic trick.

570
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,439
The problem
with the trick is, um...

571
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:59,400
All the good ones
have a little twist in the tale.

572
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,061
Is it you?

573
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,096
Is what me?

574
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,751
-Of course not.
-No, no.

575
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,686
I mean, you wouldn't have let
me in had I not demonstrated

576
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,522
the finest moral fiber, like
some of your other guests.

577
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:15,659
I notice Luis Briseño,
the arms dealer over there.

578
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:16,960
Hello, sir.

579
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:18,562
And of course, Maria Bortnick,
when starstruck,

580
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:21,330
how she manages to mingle while
monopolizing her state media.

581
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,667
Perhaps you'd care
to reveal yourself.

582
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,169
Then we can apply
the same scrutiny to you.

583
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,837
Hmm.

584
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,039
Not just yet.

585
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,523
I'm sorry for interrupting.

586
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:37,029
That won't be necessary.

587
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,298
Let him eat cake.

588
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:44,020
Marc Schreiber.

589
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,438
Veronika Vanderberg.

590
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:50,326
Let's make this quick, shall we?

591
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,028
Our auction begins shortly.

592
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,063
I trust you can do me
and the Heart justice.

593
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:57,717
Yes. I only have one rule.
What I say goes.

594
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:01,320
Well, I'm sure I can
find my submissive side.

595
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:05,624
Well, if not, I'll find it
for you.

596
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,460
Ooh. I like you.

597
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:10,914
Right this way, darling.

598
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,323
-I don't want to be too matte.
-Sure. Sure, sure.

599
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:22,191
And I don't like
the sides of my nose shining.

600
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,275
Okay.

601
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,877
-Show me.
-Mm-hmm.

602
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,364
Excuse me,
can the little fruit fly

603
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,700
in my shot please shoo,
shoo, shoo?

604
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,235
Thank you.

605
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,771
The only thing more valuable
than that diamond is my time.

606
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:37,707
I did my research on you.

607
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,175
Your industry, like mine,

608
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,778
is besieged
by manufacturer lore.

609
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:46,098
But you, you bring us
beauty as it is.

610
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,551
We're alike in that regard.

611
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:52,555
We don't sell contrivance,
we sell reality.

612
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,974
Well, I would argue
that we don't sell at all.

613
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:56,960
Others buy.

614
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,177
Hmm.

615
00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:03,049
Let's see...

616
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:07,186
Uh... The diamond,
take it out.

617
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:08,988
Nah, boy.

618
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:11,074
Absolutely not.

619
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:13,877
The glare in the glass
will mar the photos.

620
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,511
I don't tolerate imperfections.

621
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:16,780
I don't imagine
someone as ravishing

622
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,614
as Ms. Vanderberg
does either.

623
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:22,886
So, take it out or find
yourself a new photographer.

624
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:46,976
In truth,
I was hoping you'd ask.

625
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,761
I don't remember asking.

626
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:57,120
There it is.

627
00:28:57,203 --> 00:28:59,989
Beautiful.
Work it. Fabulous.

628
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,292
Fabulous.
Fabulous.

629
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,593
Beautiful.

630
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:08,364
Yes. Smiling,
we're having fun.

631
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,433
This is what we came for.

632
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:14,453
Hold it, hold it.

633
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,123
That's the money shot.

634
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:18,925
Hold it.

635
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,378
And you, ma'am, are far enough.

636
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,847
I'm just trying...
I'm trying to help.

637
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,849
Her forehead is shinier
than the diamond.

638
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,817
Actually, I'm doing my job.
I don't take orders from you.

639
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,352
When it comes to the Heart,
you listen to me.

640
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,854
-Get out.
-I... I can walk myself.

641
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:32,038
-Thank you.
-Right.

642
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:36,159
Mr. Schreiber.

643
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:37,693
If you're all you purport to be,

644
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,879
you should already have
what you need.

645
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:43,649
-More than enough. Thank you.
-Excellent.

646
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,275
Well, it's been a pleasure,
but I have buyers waiting.

647
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:54,010
I've had enough
of this of this nonsense.

648
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:55,078
Make sure it's secured.

649
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:56,996
Yes, Lethabo.

650
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:02,018
-What the hell, what happened?
-I don't know. I don't know.

651
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,753
Time's ticking. Let's go.

652
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:21,104
At last, the auction
we've all been waiting for.

653
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,505
Now, if you're here tonight,

654
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,573
you probably think
you've seen everything.

655
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,193
So it is to you that I ask...

656
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:29,795
Everything?

657
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:37,220
It's not been seen in person
for a quarter of a century.

658
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:40,556
Still the largest diamond
ever discovered, the Heart.

659
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:48,832
Congratulations
to all of you

660
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:51,350
and for getting away
with it for so long.

661
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,536
Well, guess what?

662
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:54,904
Climate change

663
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:57,206
doesn't believe in you, either.

664
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,742
You tore your fortunes
from our Mother Earth,

665
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:02,912
set fire to her skies
in your private jets...

666
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:04,547
-Okay, she gets it.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

667
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:07,650
Bled her dry
with your insatiable...

668
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,619
Young man, we all want
to save the world here,

669
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,990
but time is also precious
and you're wasting mine.

670
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:16,860
Zip it, sparkles.

671
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:18,394
Why don't you
stop sucking

672
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,879
on plastic straws,
and suck on this!

673
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,740
Honored guests.
My name is J. Daniel Atlas.

674
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,910
You may remember me
as your personal favorite

675
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,744
of the Four Horsemen of magic.

676
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,146
Now watch closely

677
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,516
as I make the famous Heart
Diamond appear on my palm.

678
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,318
Gee-whiz, he must be as starved

679
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,087
for attention
as Greenpeace here.

680
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,507
Rest assured that the diamond
is completely safe.

681
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:50,526
Is it?

682
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:53,362
Now, a wise man once told me,
in the mirror, in fact,

683
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,631
uh, never assume you're the
smartest person in the room,

684
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:57,166
prove it.

685
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,368
Be my guest.

686
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,670
All right, well, let's see
if we can get that case open.

687
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,306
Uh... Abracadabra.

688
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:06,058
Huh. Nope.
Uh... Alakazam.

689
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,893
Wait.

690
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:10,313
Open sesame.

691
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:14,566
Ah.

692
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,222
Still safe with me.

693
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:23,392
No. Relax.
Mm, relax, Veronika.

694
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:25,228
Now, as your ads
like to remind us,

695
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:27,496
diamonds are forever.

696
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,499
-Get her to safety. Now!
-You stop him! Stop him!

697
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:31,753
Stop him!

698
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,571
-Jack.
-Hey.

699
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:37,974
-What are you doing here?
-Saving your ass.

700
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,472
-Ah.
-You're welcome.

701
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,644
You got one, too. Huh.

702
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,046
-Hi. I'm June.
-Yeah.

703
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,647
-Who's she?
-Sorry, she's with us.

704
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,802
Where is the diamond?

705
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,057
What?

706
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,760
I guess you guys don't care
about the environment.

707
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,306
You're stronger than you look.

708
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,231
Hey!

709
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,450
Run away.

710
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,470
Hey! Hey, hey!

711
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,872
Stop! Don't let
them get away!

712
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,341
Okay, what now?

713
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,476
My card just said to get you
out of there. I don't know.

714
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:52,448
Henley Reeves?

715
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,283
I have so many posters of you.

716
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,818
-You're my childhood...
-All right, fanboy later.

717
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:58,321
But it does, uh... You know,
it is really nice to see you.

718
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:01,157
Fanboy later.
We got to go up.

719
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,134
Put your hands up
and don't move!

720
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:13,069
This is some bullshit.

721
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,806
What is happening?

722
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,891
Beethoven's Concerto in D major.

723
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,511
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!

724
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,649
Whoa. Merritt? What...
What the hell was that?

725
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,417
Atlas, I would like to see you

726
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,653
hypnotize three dudes
in Belgian.

727
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:31,770
You mean Flemish.

728
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,023
Okay, that explains it.

729
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:35,791
Lovely reunion.
We have to go.

730
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,661
Henley Reeves!

731
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,596
-Welcome back!
-Thanks.

732
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,131
And may I say, you are...

733
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:44,333
-Okay, come on, let's go!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

734
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,934
I was paying her a compliment

735
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,003
because it was nice
to see her, and only her.

736
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,688
-I was...
-We get it!

737
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,344
Up there.

738
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,817
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Is that for us?

739
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,353
Do you see any other people
trying to escape?

740
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,272
Come on, come on.
Go, go!

741
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,230
Come on, come on.

742
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,301
Uh, it was in my hand

743
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,870
the whole time. It never...

744
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,588
They didn't swap the diamond.

745
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,074
They swapped the case.

746
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,178
And you, ma'am, are far enough.

747
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,487
Why don't you stop sucking
on plastic straws,

748
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,372
and suck on this!

749
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,076
Honored guests...

750
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,361
Open sesame.

751
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,151
Still safe with me.

752
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:46,572
Diamonds are forever.

753
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:51,394
-Lethabo.
-Yes, ma'am?

754
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:53,412
We're going to
make them regret this.

755
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:55,814
And then some.

756
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:58,884
Marc Schreiber, <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

757
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:02,354
What did I miss?

758
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:13,582
You know,
I thought it'd be shinier.

759
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:15,684
Okay.
All right, give it back.

760
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,586
-What are you doing?
-Oh. Sorry. It's so slippery.

761
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:18,621
-Hey. Hey.
-Heads up.

762
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:19,955
Okay, don't do that again.

763
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:23,359
Hey, can I address
the, uh, infant in the room?

764
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,461
Uh... Who are these guys?

765
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:28,197
These are the wonderful kids
that deep faked our show.

766
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,898
-What?
-Yeah.

767
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,834
You had the cops
sent to my house?

768
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,536
-You freaked out my kids.
-Yeah, sorry.

769
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:34,870
-Sorry about that.
-Sorry about that.

770
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:36,372
How are the kids, though?

771
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,106
How is the whole boring
suburban life you left us for?

772
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,675
Hey, relax, man.
You missed your shot.

773
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,477
-Hmm.
-See the size of that rock?

774
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,945
No, let me see that.

775
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,613
Ooh, it's no Heart Diamond,
but it's impressive.

776
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,782
I already told you, Danny.
I didn't feel safe

777
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,217
trying to escape
from a straitjacket

778
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,518
hanging upside down.

779
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,019
-I was six months pregnant.
-Come on.

780
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,688
We would have flipped
you right side up at the end.

781
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:53,856
You'd have been fine.

782
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,224
-Come on.
-You guys didn't even miss me.

783
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:57,993
How long did it take you
to replace me? An afternoon?

784
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:00,263
Um, and the better part
of an evening.

785
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:02,831
Hey, speaking of, how is Lula?

786
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:05,468
-Are you guys still, uh...
-No.

787
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:06,902
She, uh...
she moved to Paris.

788
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,204
Oh, no. She dumped
the great J. Wilder. My God.

789
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,373
I'm sorry. My apologies.

790
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:11,640
Don't you need to be
on some, like,

791
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:12,741
cruise ship somewhere
humiliating yourself?

792
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,377
-Humiliating myself?
-Yeah.

793
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,679
I make five figures
per cruise, plus perks.

794
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,314
"Plus perks."
He said, "plus perks."

795
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:19,582
And I thought
Merritt drinking himself

796
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:21,016
to death in Mexico
was depressing. Ooh.

797
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,985
Speaking of,
I got to get back to it.

798
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:25,571
This liver's
not gonna destroy itself.

799
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,557
Uh, can we dry dock this thing?

800
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,992
Wait, wait, wait.
You're leaving?

801
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:32,261
Well, yeah, I mean,
great catching up.

802
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:35,564
Um, I don't know, what,
see you in another ten?

803
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,733
Nice to meet you,
little tadpoles.

804
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,234
<i>Adios.</i>

805
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,236
Yeah, you know what?
I'm out of here, too.

806
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,338
I have a gig to get to.

807
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:43,439
Really?
They're covering your Uber?

808
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,457
Signed an NDA.
Can't say a word.

809
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,476
What are you doing?

810
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,578
Six handles
and none of them open it.

811
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,447
Who do you think
you're talking to? Move.

812
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,848
I'm sorry,
but I don't really know

813
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,517
what's going on with you guys.

814
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,251
I'm getting the feeling there's
a lot of weird history here,

815
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,786
and things are a little awkward.

816
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:01,006
Yeah, you guys,
you used to be the Horsemen.

817
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,092
I don't get it.
Why did you break up?

818
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,561
Ask them.
Ask them why we broke up.

819
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:07,400
If it was up to me,
we wouldn't have.

820
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,468
-The Eye wanted us to...
-No, no.

821
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:14,970
...expose a Russian
arms dealer.

822
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,905
Do we really have
to live through this again?

823
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,375
We made some
huge mistakes, we got...

824
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:21,710
-Sloppy.
-Cocky.

825
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,579
Because of us,
Dylan Shrike will never see

826
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:25,247
the outside
of a Russian prison again.

827
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,450
-Who?
-Dylan Shrike. Okay?

828
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,618
He's a Horseman. Come on.
Do your homework, man.

829
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,821
I'm so sorry.
Guys, I had no idea.

830
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,222
What, he's stuck
in there forever?

831
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,658
Which is
obviously a tragedy

832
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:36,892
and something
I'll never forgive myself for.

833
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:37,960
-Nor will I.
-Yeah, fine, man.

834
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,027
But it didn't mean
you have to quit.

835
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,997
Man, that is, uh...

836
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,226
It's really a bummer, guys.
Sorry about that.

837
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,085
"A bummer"?

838
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,472
I... I... I love the way

839
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:53,008
your generation
sums things up so eloquently.

840
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:55,411
I mean, someone explain to me

841
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,446
why these pre-pubes
are even here.

842
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,164
Same reason you are, man.

843
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,266
The Eye wanted 'em.

844
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,486
Well, we got the Heart.

845
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:05,153
What does The Eye
want us to do next?

846
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,289
-No idea.
-I know one thing.

847
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:10,593
You've got a half a billion
dollar diamond in your hands.

848
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:12,661
-They're gonna get in touch.
-Yeah, probably.

849
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,046
Whoa, wait, wait.
Atlas, can I see your card?

850
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:16,599
Yeah.

851
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:23,706
Hmm.

852
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,007
-Whoa.
-It's a map.

853
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,343
-Hey, Atlas, it's your dad.
-No, it's...

854
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,112
It's a map that
only reveals itself

855
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:32,764
when the Horsemen are together.

856
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,018
-Fat chance.
-Really, dude?

857
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,352
I mean, come on,

858
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,155
The Eye obviously wants
you guys to do this.

859
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:42,474
You're the Horsemen.
Start acting like it.

860
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:48,464
All right.

861
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:51,282
I suppose Rosarito
can wait a couple days.

862
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:56,204
I... I can try to reschedule
this gig.

863
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,624
It's not gonna be easy,
but I'll figure it out.

864
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:01,677
I mean, I have kind of missed
running for my life

865
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,278
and jumping off roofs
with you guys.

866
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:06,348
-It's good to have you back.
-Thanks.

867
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:08,283
Okay, so where is this place?

868
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,929
What are we
supposed to be doing here?

869
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,698
The Eye
will let us know.

870
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:25,200
-All right, picture time.
-What are you doing?

871
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:26,569
Taking a photo.
That's what couples do now.

872
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:27,936
Please don't post photos

873
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:28,771
-of the top secret location.
-Don't be jealous.

874
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:29,938
I know you want to be in it.

875
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,339
Yeah.
I don't want to be in it.

876
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,908
-Because it can be used for...
-For memories.

877
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,601
No, not memories.
Evidence.

878
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,632
Huh. I've never
seen a door like this.

879
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,287
Okay, I can't open it.

880
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,589
You got this, Jack?

881
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:48,724
Wait.
Don't you mean "June"?

882
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:51,560
-Jack's our lockpick.
-Whoa.

883
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:54,229
Looks like a little
healthy competish.

884
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:55,631
Come on, this isn't fair.

885
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:57,265
I've been picking locks
since before she was born.

886
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:00,736
Let me find the keyhole.

887
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:03,648
-Maybe the other side.
-Yeah, it's underneath.

888
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:06,041
You're not inspiring
confidence right now, Jack.

889
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:07,576
-He's got it.
-Hmm.

890
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:09,111
-He's got it.
-Feeling rusty?

891
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,195
Don't rush me.

892
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,549
When does he start
the lock picking?

893
00:42:13,632 --> 00:42:16,752
Hey, Jack, I don't think
this is a lock you pick.

894
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:19,137
I think it's a lock
you solve. So...

895
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,893
Show him how it's done.

896
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:26,294
Whoa.

897
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,030
Do you mind if I just figure
this out real quickly?

898
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:31,950
Okay.

899
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:38,641
If you've ever done
an escape room,

900
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:41,760
you'd know there are all kinds
of different puzzles.

901
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,180
It's not just about
locks and keys.

902
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:46,582
-Whoa.
-Huh.

903
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:48,283
You might want to
update your game, Jack.

904
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:49,317
Whoa.

905
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,270
But, by all means, lead the way.

906
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,608
I think he loosened it
for her, ultimately.

907
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:58,844
-Huh.
-Ooh.

908
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:01,163
-Whoa.
-Wow.

909
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,731
Uh, what is this place?

910
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:04,366
Magic nerd heaven.

911
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,051
P.T. Selbit's coffin?

912
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,004
See?

913
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,039
Guys, Houdini's straitjacket.

914
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:12,340
Yes, it is.

915
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,543
Hey, can I put you in here
for old time's sake?

916
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:16,111
-No.
-No?

917
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:17,179
I thought it was funny.

918
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:18,774
Thanks a lot.
You wanna come in?

919
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,116
-No.
-Right.

920
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,488
Charlie,
check this out, dude.

921
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:27,572
What is it?

922
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:29,191
Bullet catch.

923
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,441
No way!

924
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:33,244
Yo!

925
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,045
-Dead end?
-Yeah, dead end.

926
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,414
Hey, guys, dead end.

927
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:54,382
-Or, is it?
-Hmm.

928
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,837
Oh, my God.

929
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:02,373
Yeah, it is.

930
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:07,278
Hmm, that's weird.

931
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:14,169
The die should be here
and the ball should be here.

932
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:21,844
-Whoa.
-Well played.

933
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:22,878
It's nothing.

934
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:24,046
Four rows.

935
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:27,515
One, five, eight, four?
Is it a code?

936
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,718
-One, one, five, six, 18...
-Minus four.

937
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:31,053
-One, eight, nine?
-Fifteen, eighty-four.

938
00:44:31,136 --> 00:44:32,621
-1584.
-Wha...

939
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:34,222
<i>The Discoverie of Witchcraft.</i>

940
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:35,523
It's the first book
on stage magic.

941
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:36,591
It's when it was published.

942
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,126
God,
how does he know that?

943
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:40,428
Uh, he's basically a computer
full of useless information.

944
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,947
Huh.

945
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:53,859
"Useless"?

946
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,564
This is cool.

947
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:05,403
-Unreal.
-Nice.

948
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:18,984
Hey, guys, it's the floor plan
of the chateau.

949
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:21,820
But it's different somehow.

950
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:25,523
Up is down.

951
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,726
Left is right.

952
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:32,397
Even the rooms are tricks.

953
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,618
My Horsemen.

954
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:38,386
Thaddeus!

955
00:45:39,905 --> 00:45:41,857
-So good to see you.
-So good to see you, darling.

956
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,592
You could've just checked the
Ring camera and buzzed us in.

957
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,661
Now, where's the fun in that?

958
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,697
Sir. Hi, I'm Charlie.

959
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,433
-I'm such a big fan of yours.
-Hi, Charlie.

960
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:52,768
Um...

961
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:54,937
I've never seen a Lubor Lens
this big in person.

962
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,639
Really? Well, you ain't
seen nothing yet.

963
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:01,676
So you sent the tarot cards?

964
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,945
No.

965
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:05,613
No, I've long since given up
such foolishness,

966
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,833
and your collective dysfunction.

967
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,153
No, the only magic I do nowadays

968
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:12,637
is for my grandchildren.

969
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:16,224
Some weeks ago, however,

970
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:18,709
a card did appear
on my doorstep,

971
00:46:20,245 --> 00:46:23,198
warning me to prepare
this chateau

972
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,835
for the arrival of
seven soon-to-be fugitives

973
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,036
from the law.

974
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,537
-That tracks.
-Yeah.

975
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,339
Wait, so why does
The Eye want us here?

976
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:33,909
Well, I can only assume
that whatever it is

977
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:35,744
they want you to do next

978
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:37,929
is hidden somewhere
in these walls.

979
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:43,251
See, this chateau,
Chateau Roussillon,

980
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:44,652
used to be their home.

981
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,222
In 1943,

982
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:51,593
the Allies needed military
miracles from every source.

983
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:54,496
They enlisted the aid

984
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:58,600
of some of the most talented
magicians of the time.

985
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:03,105
They built a whole city
using mud, cardboard, lights,

986
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:06,174
thousands
of inflatable rubber tanks

987
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:08,343
to misdirect the Germans.

988
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:10,245
The genius of Jasper Maskelyne.

989
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:13,448
Somebody knows his history.

990
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:16,214
Wait, so, what do the Nazis
have to do with the diamond?

991
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:19,187
That, I do not know.

992
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,873
But the answer
is here somewhere.

993
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:25,110
We just have to start looking.

994
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,431
Ms. Vanderberg.
Ms. Vanderberg.

995
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,233
How do you respond to
the rumors that your company

996
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:33,068
is nothing but a front
for money laundering?

997
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:34,269
The Horsemen are thieves

998
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:37,239
posing as
anti-capitalist entertainers,

999
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:40,475
and they have unfairly targeted
me and my good company.

1000
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:43,311
I challenge anyone
who maligns us to look

1001
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:45,647
closely at our operations
and our books.

1002
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,383
And I challenge police
to put those magicians

1003
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,618
back where they belong,
in the past.

1004
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,288
All right, no more questions.

1005
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,540
No more questions, please!
Thank you!

1006
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:13,075
Interpol said
it was an inside job.

1007
00:48:13,158 --> 00:48:15,277
Thieves knew exactly
where the blind spots were.

1008
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:22,250
<i>-How was it?</i>
-Let me guess.

1009
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,618
You're the one
behind these Horsemen

1010
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:25,687
and their little stable hands.

1011
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:26,989
<i>No. Why would I ask
for the diamond</i>

1012
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:28,292
<i>and then try to steal it?</i>

1013
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,426
<i>If I were you,
I'd figure out a way</i>

1014
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:33,011
<i>to get it back, and fast.</i>

1015
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:35,864
<i>I understand that
you and your race team</i>

1016
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:37,632
<i>will be in Abu Dhabi
later this week.</i>

1017
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:39,601
<i>A perfect neutral ground.</i>

1018
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:40,869
<i>I'll bring my evidence.</i>

1019
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:43,605
<i>You bring your Heart,
if you have one.</i>

1020
00:48:43,688 --> 00:48:45,256
I...

1021
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:49,878
-Have you found them yet?
-We do have a few leads.

1022
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:52,447
They were seen headed
south out of Belgium.

1023
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:53,515
Now they're
saying the Horsemen

1024
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:56,351
have been seen in France
one hour ago.

1025
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,186
The head of the
French police owes me.

1026
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,422
Just call him and say that
I want these Horsemen's heads

1027
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:02,190
served up on a platter.

1028
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,443
The gendarme will find them.
I'm sure of it.

1029
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:08,530
Thaddeus told us
to look for something.

1030
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:09,898
What do you think it is?

1031
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:14,819
Oh, wow. This is cool.

1032
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:18,423
You are not a big talker.

1033
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,575
Oh. Sorry.

1034
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:22,677
But you are a big apologizer.

1035
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,980
Sorry.
I just did it again.

1036
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,015
Sorry. I mean...
I'm just nervous.

1037
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:28,850
I'm a big fan of you guys.

1038
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:31,669
And I got the cops called in,
and I'm really...

1039
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,422
I'm really...
I'm not gonna say it.

1040
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:36,691
You're forgiven.

1041
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:39,194
And you guys made
the Horsemen look good.

1042
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:42,197
But I didn't see you.
Why weren't you in it?

1043
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,516
Oh, I just... I prefer to be
behind the scenes, you know.

1044
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:47,936
I design all of our tricks.

1045
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:49,737
Um, where are we going?
I feel like we're lost.

1046
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,106
Do you really prefer that,

1047
00:49:51,189 --> 00:49:53,189
or is that just something
you hide behind?

1048
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,693
Uh, what do you mean?

1049
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,513
Well, I... Whoa.

1050
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:01,649
For years, I told myself
I wanted to be an assistant,

1051
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,851
that I didn't mind
being upstaged by Atlas,

1052
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,053
'cause he's so brilliant.

1053
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:08,005
But really, I just...
I was afraid.

1054
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:12,127
I was afraid
to take the spotlight.

1055
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:19,217
Ooh. Thaddeus was right.
Up is down.

1056
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,530
Upside down room. Cool.

1057
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:34,916
Cool?

1058
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:36,784
Is nothing impressive to you?

1059
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,720
That's why I said "cool."

1060
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:40,488
Do you not know what cool means?

1061
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:41,990
All right,
let's just try to figure out

1062
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:43,425
how this room works, okay?

1063
00:50:43,508 --> 00:50:44,842
Yeah.

1064
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:51,633
Figured it out.

1065
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,268
Of course. That's right.
You know everything already.

1066
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:55,337
So what did I
do wrong this time?

1067
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,705
Ah, nothing.
My apologies.

1068
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,837
You're amazing.
It's an honor to watch you.

1069
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:03,011
Has anyone ever told you
that you're a control freak?

1070
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:04,262
Yep. Many times.

1071
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,453
Whoa! Hey!

1072
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,040
I did figure it out.

1073
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:25,550
Whoa. Wow.

1074
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,730
Gummies kicked in.

1075
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,321
I wonder
what we're looking for.

1076
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,022
Anything weird.

1077
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,040
This is all weird.
Jesus.

1078
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,143
Look at this.

1079
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:59,033
You know, I have always
looked up to you.

1080
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,368
Oh, yeah?

1081
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,837
Yeah, before you became
a cruise ship magician.

1082
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,572
Hey, I also do corporate events.

1083
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,291
Oh, no way.
I couldn't tell.

1084
00:52:08,092 --> 00:52:10,378
So that was
a total waste. What now?

1085
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:11,979
One trick. Okay? No charm,

1086
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:13,815
no gifts of gabs.
Just one trick.

1087
00:52:13,898 --> 00:52:15,983
Dude, I do not
have to prove myself to you.

1088
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,152
I mean, you kind of do.

1089
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:18,747
Show me why The Eye picked you.

1090
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,356
You know what?

1091
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:23,585
Prove to me that
you don't need a babysitter.

1092
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:27,829
Oh, what,
now you stop performing?

1093
00:52:27,912 --> 00:52:30,064
You're done showing off 'cause
your misfit friends aren't here?

1094
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,033
-They're my family.
-Mm-hmm.

1095
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:33,768
Don't you dare.
I don't have to impress them.

1096
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:35,002
All right, fine.
Forget it.

1097
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,271
I just wanted to see
what you were capable of

1098
00:52:36,354 --> 00:52:37,805
when you weren't trying
to win cheap applause,

1099
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,191
but I guess
the answer is nothing.

1100
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:46,248
All right.
You wanna see a magic trick?

1101
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:47,915
See, the problem
with you, Atlas,

1102
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,785
is that you just like to
overcomplicate things, man.

1103
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:55,123
It is a lot easier to find
a diamond than you think.

1104
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:57,442
-Ooh.
-And to make it...

1105
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,026
...disappear.

1106
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:00,528
-Nice.
-Check your pocket.

1107
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:01,596
-Really?
-Yeah.

1108
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,265
Hmm.

1109
00:53:03,348 --> 00:53:06,201
Ooh, not bad.
Card to impossible location.

1110
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:07,702
But don't play checkers
on a chessboard

1111
00:53:07,785 --> 00:53:09,871
because I'm already
five steps ahead of you.

1112
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:10,988
Check your pocket.

1113
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,875
Hey.

1114
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:16,578
-Those are priceless antiques.
-Yeah.

1115
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:18,380
This room is where old relics

1116
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:20,148
go to their final resting place.

1117
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:23,818
Yep. You are, uh... You're
probably right, Thaddeus.

1118
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:27,789
But, uh, not before they have
one last shot at glory.

1119
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,224
-What's going on here?
-Pretty good,

1120
00:53:29,307 --> 00:53:31,125
but you should try to do
things a little more slow.

1121
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,260
Really?

1122
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:34,662
Let your audience
enjoy the real magic.

1123
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:35,897
Okay,

1124
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:36,998
-not bad. Not bad.
-Wow.

1125
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:38,233
Nice one, Bosco.

1126
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:39,901
I've never been great at poker,

1127
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:44,172
but is a diamond
trumped by a heart?

1128
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:47,475
-Ooh. There it is.
-Whoo.

1129
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,844
Nice misdirection,
but, let's not forget

1130
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:51,479
-what this is really about.
-I wasn't done.

1131
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:54,416
-Show 'em, Charlie.
-Making a jewel disappear.

1132
00:53:54,499 --> 00:53:55,717
-Let's see this one.
-All right.

1133
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,919
Keep your eye on the prize.

1134
00:53:58,002 --> 00:54:01,756
Round and round they go,
where they stop, nobody knows.

1135
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,091
-Good as gone.
-Ooh.

1136
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:06,994
Black art, table's rigged,
saw it when I came in.

1137
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,264
-Time for a clean escape.
-Oh, yeah.

1138
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:12,030
-Where is he going?
-I know what he's doing.

1139
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,386
Jack in the box?
That's a trick?

1140
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:18,773
Ah, it's old stuff.

1141
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:21,209
If I had known he was that
easy to get rid of.

1142
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,877
-Not that easy.
-Yeah, Jack.

1143
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,480
Ohh! Okay, enough
of the warm-up act,

1144
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:26,981
time for the headliner.

1145
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:30,184
I want you to think
of one of these cards,

1146
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:34,289
but don't think of the one you
think I want you to think of.

1147
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:36,031
-Got one?
-Yeah, I got one.

1148
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:39,561
-What was your card?
-Four of hearts.

1149
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:42,196
Ha-ha.

1150
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,166
Nice one, professor.
I'm impressed. I'm impressed.

1151
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:47,502
Hey. Hey. Hey.
That whiskey is older than you.

1152
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:49,404
Sorry, boss. So sorry.

1153
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:51,072
Look, you guys,
I'm not gonna lie.

1154
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:52,474
This has been really cool.

1155
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:54,008
-Really, really cool.
-Go show 'em.

1156
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:57,412
But, uh, I think I just want
to make it a little cooler.

1157
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:58,913
-Come on now, yeah!
-Hey.

1158
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:01,581
-There she goes.
-Yes! Snow storm in China.

1159
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,419
There we are.
Beautiful.

1160
00:55:05,603 --> 00:55:07,689
I always wear white
in winter, guys.

1161
00:55:07,772 --> 00:55:10,392
Snow is rare
in this part of France,

1162
00:55:10,475 --> 00:55:13,978
but, ice,
that is just impossible.

1163
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:17,899
-Classic.
-Nice.

1164
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,434
How do you do a vanish so good?

1165
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:21,352
-Oh, a magician never tells.
-Hmm?

1166
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,521
-Ooh. Hmm.
-Check.

1167
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,407
Mate?

1168
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:26,408
Shit.

1169
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:27,909
Face it, Bosco.

1170
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:31,078
Wisdom and skill overcome youth
and arrogance every time.

1171
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,614
Thank you.

1172
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:34,716
Never assume you're the smartest
guy in the room. Prove it.

1173
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,884
Give me a break, man.
You didn't prove anything.

1174
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:38,052
Hey, can I just remind everyone

1175
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:39,287
we still haven't figured out

1176
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,556
why we're even in this
World War II relic?

1177
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:42,940
Wait!

1178
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:45,126
Jasper Maskelyne,

1179
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:47,329
the... the magician
who vanquished the Nazis.

1180
00:55:47,412 --> 00:55:50,865
He built fake cities,
fake tanks.

1181
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:52,867
I mean... I wonder...

1182
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:06,381
-Whoa.
-Oh.

1183
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:07,565
Oh, wow.

1184
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,421
Oh, my God, I was right?

1185
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:15,323
Hey, Magic 101, man,
never act surprised

1186
00:56:15,406 --> 00:56:16,891
when the trick actually works.

1187
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,308
Oh, sorry.

1188
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,768
-Oh, my goodness.
-What is all that?

1189
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:28,836
Encyclopedia
of Nazi war criminals.

1190
00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:32,173
Uh, which apparently includes
Veronika's dad.

1191
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:34,976
After World War II, surviving
Nazis fled around the world.

1192
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:37,545
I'm not an accountant, but
looks like Peter Vanderberg

1193
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:39,313
got rich cleaning
their dirty money.

1194
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,282
Yeah, and apparently
Veronika took over

1195
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:43,184
right where he left off
using his criminal network.

1196
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:44,586
But...
But I don't understand.

1197
00:56:44,669 --> 00:56:46,488
What does The Eye
want us to do with this?

1198
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:48,673
Well, if I'm not mistaken,

1199
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:53,661
The Eye wants us
to unmask the Vanderbergs,

1200
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,964
bring down
two generations of criminals

1201
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:58,600
with a single sleight of hand.

1202
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:00,001
I've read
some interesting rumors

1203
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:02,136
about the Vanderbergs online.

1204
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:05,473
Looks like 15 years ago,
Veronika's mom killed herself,

1205
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:08,044
and a week later, their
housekeeper's brakes failed.

1206
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:11,145
Her car crashed,
she and her son died.

1207
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:13,047
There was some suspicion
of foul play,

1208
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,182
but nothing was ever proven.

1209
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,551
Hmm.

1210
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:18,352
-Whoa.
-Oh, shit.

1211
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:27,629
Police!

1212
00:57:27,712 --> 00:57:29,797
Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

1213
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,999
Listen closely. Split up.

1214
00:57:32,082 --> 00:57:33,968
-Find a way out. Go. Go.
-Okay. Come on, let's go.

1215
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:35,369
He's right.
Everybody split up.

1216
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,804
Okay, let's go.

1217
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,208
This way, this way!

1218
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:02,513
Stop!

1219
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:09,787
-Turn around.
-Turn around.

1220
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:14,925
You heard him, Bosco.
Turn around.

1221
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,469
Here they come!

1222
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:52,980
<i>Adios, mon ami.</i>

1223
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,688
Sorry!

1224
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:23,344
<i>Bonjour, monsieur. Bonjour.</i>

1225
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:25,079
You know, normally,
I like to give

1226
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:26,997
a proper tour to new guests.

1227
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:30,585
I suspect you've discovered

1228
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:33,120
that this house
holds many secrets.

1229
00:59:33,203 --> 00:59:34,238
Thaddeus!

1230
00:59:41,011 --> 00:59:42,079
Thaddeus!

1231
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:46,500
Would you like to see
a magic trick?

1232
00:59:48,786 --> 00:59:51,639
How about if I make myself...

1233
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:53,274
disappear?

1234
00:59:53,357 --> 00:59:54,558
Don't move!

1235
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:58,095
Thaddeus!

1236
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:14,596
Thaddeus!

1237
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,789
Hurry! This way!

1238
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:27,224
Thaddeus?

1239
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:29,210
Oh, thank God.

1240
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:31,293
Hey, which is
the fastest way out of here?

1241
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:34,181
-Around this bend...
-Yeah.

1242
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:37,351
...there's a passageway.

1243
01:00:37,434 --> 01:00:40,421
Just follow the creek
through the forest.

1244
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:42,990
-Whoa.
-Oh!

1245
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:45,392
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no. No, no, no.

1246
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,428
This can't be happening.
Come on, Thaddeus, stand up.

1247
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:48,529
We're gonna go now.

1248
01:00:48,612 --> 01:00:50,414
We need to get you help.

1249
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,917
Please, stand up.

1250
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:56,704
You have to stop
Veronika Vanderberg.

1251
01:00:56,787 --> 01:00:59,573
No, we can't do it
without you, Thaddeus.

1252
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:02,760
You don't need me.

1253
01:01:04,695 --> 01:01:06,296
But you do need each other.

1254
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:09,767
Never forget that.

1255
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:16,340
I knew when I came here,
this was...

1256
01:01:17,942 --> 01:01:21,545
probably my final trick.

1257
01:01:24,782 --> 01:01:28,352
Now, don't let me die in vain.

1258
01:01:31,388 --> 01:01:33,290
There's work to be done.

1259
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:41,231
Go. Go now, go. Please.

1260
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:43,768
Before it's...

1261
01:01:45,269 --> 01:01:47,237
too late.

1262
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,988
Let's go. We gotta go.

1263
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:09,593
Atlas!

1264
01:02:36,821 --> 01:02:38,639
The police
took June into custody.

1265
01:02:38,722 --> 01:02:40,374
Well, what about
Jack and Merritt?

1266
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:42,476
-Them, too.
-Okay, so we break them out.

1267
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:43,978
Whoa, uh-uh. Let's just talk
about this for a second.

1268
01:02:44,061 --> 01:02:45,046
Talk about what?

1269
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:46,213
Listen to me.
We need to be smart.

1270
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:48,015
No. We gotta get
my friend out of jail.

1271
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,450
-Bosco...
-Look, when you were researching

1272
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:52,118
all that stuff about us,
you know what didn't come up?

1273
01:02:53,037 --> 01:02:54,793
Charlie and June
are my only friends.

1274
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:56,958
You know what
I really love about them?

1275
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:58,659
They don't make me
feel like an asshole.

1276
01:02:58,742 --> 01:02:59,961
-I'm getting June.
-Bosco, wait...

1277
01:03:00,044 --> 01:03:01,695
-Listen to me. Hey.
-Just one second, dude.

1278
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:02,797
Listen to me.
You can't.

1279
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,831
Why? Tell me.

1280
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:05,132
They're looking for you, Bosco.

1281
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,500
They're looking for all of us.

1282
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:08,369
Yes. Yes, you're gonna
get arrested, too.

1283
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:09,370
Yes.

1284
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:10,671
-Shit.
-Exactly.

1285
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:11,839
If only there was somebody else

1286
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:13,140
crazy enough
to stage a jailbreak

1287
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:15,576
with no resources,
no protection.

1288
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:16,994
-Atlas.
-Yeah?

1289
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:20,047
Maybe there is.

1290
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:41,668
Thaddeus Marcus Bradley,
in case you're interested

1291
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,754
in the name of the man
you just murdered.

1292
01:03:45,689 --> 01:03:47,524
Ah, yes.

1293
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:50,027
That was unfortunate.

1294
01:03:51,528 --> 01:03:53,781
You know, when this
whole thing started,

1295
01:03:53,864 --> 01:03:57,785
I didn't give a shit about you
or your diamond,

1296
01:03:57,868 --> 01:04:03,724
but you just went
and made it deeply personal.

1297
01:04:03,807 --> 01:04:08,429
And now, I am really looking
forward to taking you down.

1298
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:11,465
My father
would have loved you.

1299
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:13,367
He was quite fond of magic.

1300
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:14,936
When I was five or six,

1301
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:17,487
in one of the few moments
that I had him to myself,

1302
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:19,941
he taught me a trick.

1303
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:22,509
He would make a red silk
handkerchief disappear

1304
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:24,278
and then come back
out of his mouth.

1305
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,213
I loved it!

1306
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:28,782
It had just
the right amount of flair.

1307
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,886
And I practiced
that trick for months.

1308
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:34,455
I thought that
if I could do it just right,

1309
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:36,073
I would earn more of...

1310
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:38,976
of him.

1311
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:41,562
But that was the illusion.

1312
01:04:41,645 --> 01:04:44,498
I've hated magic ever since.

1313
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:47,434
The camp, the cheese,
not to say anything

1314
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:50,921
of con artists like you
with your mentalism.

1315
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:57,078
Neither one of us has
psychic powers, Mr. McKinney.

1316
01:04:57,161 --> 01:05:00,314
But you don't have to.
You know where my Heart is.

1317
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:01,983
And I don't have to,

1318
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:03,627
because you're going to tell me.

1319
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:07,154
I think you're smart enough
to know that

1320
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:10,524
I ain't telling you shit,
as we say in Texas.

1321
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:12,927
And, you're wrong
about mentalism.

1322
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:17,865
People wear their entire
life story on their face.

1323
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:20,367
You just have to know
how to read it.

1324
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,286
Take yours, for example.

1325
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:25,922
-May I?
-With pleasure.

1326
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:28,943
This is gonna be fun.

1327
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:32,146
Well, you've already shared,

1328
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:35,782
in excruciating detail,
your daddy issues,

1329
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:38,935
but I'm curious about your mom.

1330
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:43,440
Why did she commit suicide?

1331
01:05:44,808 --> 01:05:47,028
Was she as desperate

1332
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:50,247
for your father's attention
as you were?

1333
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,200
Ooh...

1334
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,301
She was.

1335
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:57,004
And why was that?

1336
01:05:57,087 --> 01:06:01,208
Did your father give his
attention to someone else?

1337
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:06,330
When you tuck your hair
behind your ear, that's a tell.

1338
01:06:07,564 --> 01:06:08,682
He was.

1339
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:13,520
So, was he banging
his secretary?

1340
01:06:13,603 --> 01:06:16,157
No, that's too cliche.

1341
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,543
But it had to be someone close
to your mom for her to...

1342
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,813
A good friend?
Hairdresser?

1343
01:06:26,183 --> 01:06:28,252
It wasn't the housekeeper,
was it?

1344
01:06:29,386 --> 01:06:32,239
No, not the housekeeper.

1345
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:34,341
I don't have time for this.

1346
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:37,178
And that's what people usually
say when I'm getting hot.

1347
01:06:37,261 --> 01:06:40,281
Should we crank up the AC,
maybe open a window?

1348
01:06:40,364 --> 01:06:45,686
Now, if my dad was having sex
with my housekeeper

1349
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:48,822
and my mom found out
and committed suicide,

1350
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:54,561
I probably wouldn't cut the
brakes on my housekeeper's car.

1351
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:58,715
But then again,
I'm not a psychopath.

1352
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:02,986
You are a sad and pathetic man.

1353
01:07:04,054 --> 01:07:05,822
I can see
why you want to end it.

1354
01:07:07,324 --> 01:07:09,876
Uh, hey, uh, Veronika...

1355
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:10,944
You know,

1356
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:14,064
walking away is also a tell.

1357
01:07:40,857 --> 01:07:42,025
Ooh-la-la.

1358
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,207
<i>Monsieur, monsieur, monsieur.</i>

1359
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,242
Where is she?
Where's the girl?

1360
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:50,077
Shit!

1361
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,412
She escaped.

1362
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,208
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

1363
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:14,618
That's pretty disgusting,
even for you.

1364
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:20,073
I think I may have
overdone it on the wine.

1365
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,608
Hi, Lula.

1366
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:23,460
You look great, by the way.

1367
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,795
Okay, one...

1368
01:09:26,796 --> 01:09:28,515
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

1369
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:29,999
How did you find us?

1370
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,387
A little birdie told me.

1371
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,556
Imagine my surprise.

1372
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:38,091
You guys all got
back together without me.

1373
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,427
What? No, it's not like that.
You don't understand.

1374
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,962
It wasn't? No?

1375
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:43,347
You're free. Dick.

1376
01:09:47,284 --> 01:09:49,136
The cavalry.

1377
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:52,873
-Miss me?
-Oh, a lot.

1378
01:09:52,956 --> 01:09:54,858
Oh, hello there.
It's me, Lula...

1379
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:57,378
Teeth! Lula!

1380
01:09:57,461 --> 01:09:59,079
Remember?
I too was once a Horseman.

1381
01:09:59,162 --> 01:10:01,482
Yeah, I asked about you.
I was the only one.

1382
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:04,368
Oh, you were the...
He was the only one. Really?

1383
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:11,375
Shit. Okay.

1384
01:10:14,644 --> 01:10:16,663
We have to get to the meet-up.
Okay, here's the plan.

1385
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:18,932
I have the getaway car.
It's all ready to go.

1386
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:20,367
I just need Jack to hot wire it.

1387
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,068
Wait, your plan is
for me to steal a car?

1388
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:23,270
Uh-huh!

1389
01:10:23,353 --> 01:10:25,005
Okay, I'll hot wire the car.
You get June.

1390
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:26,173
Do not leave without her,
all right?

1391
01:10:26,256 --> 01:10:27,941
-Meet us outside.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

1392
01:10:28,024 --> 01:10:30,511
Oh! Uh, watch
for flashing lights!

1393
01:10:30,594 --> 01:10:32,779
Okay. You know,
I can hot wire the...

1394
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:58,755
-You can let go of me now.
-Right. Sorry.

1395
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:27,150
Whoa!

1396
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:31,605
<i>♪ Viva la France ♪</i>

1397
01:11:31,688 --> 01:11:33,507
<i>♪ I love the fries
and the toast ♪</i>

1398
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:43,884
Come here.

1399
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:45,719
Where is the diamond?

1400
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:48,221
Merritt, thank you.

1401
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,239
Got your back, kiddo.

1402
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:52,559
But who's got yours?

1403
01:11:53,777 --> 01:11:54,778
Flashing lights.

1404
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:57,197
Run!

1405
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:03,804
Look into my eyes,

1406
01:12:03,887 --> 01:12:05,472
watch and wonder
why I whisper words

1407
01:12:05,555 --> 01:12:08,257
that weaken your will,
and sleep.

1408
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:13,514
Not everyone's susceptible.

1409
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:21,337
I said, "Sleep!"

1410
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:33,434
Easy does it <i>s'il vous plait.</i>

1411
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:37,571
Ta-da!

1412
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:52,569
Hello?

1413
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:55,088
Jack?

1414
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:57,057
You could have told us
you were coming in a police car.

1415
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,592
Thank you very much.

1416
01:12:58,675 --> 01:13:00,461
And, look, we made
the Fifth Horseman reappear.

1417
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:01,995
-Hello, Lula.
-Hi.

1418
01:13:02,078 --> 01:13:03,263
Okay.

1419
01:13:03,346 --> 01:13:06,215
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

1420
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:09,503
-But they have Merritt.
-Shit.

1421
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:11,605
-Yeah, I escaped, he couldn't.
-Yeah, yeah.

1422
01:13:11,688 --> 01:13:13,507
Very emotional time
for everybody here.

1423
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,008
Clearly a lot going on.

1424
01:13:15,091 --> 01:13:18,345
And I'm really trying not to
take any of this personally.

1425
01:13:18,428 --> 01:13:20,280
But, please, can you tell me,

1426
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:22,583
did The Eye
contact you directly?

1427
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:23,617
Yeah.

1428
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,918
-You, too?
-Yes.

1429
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:26,887
-Why didn't you call me sooner?
-I'm so sorry.

1430
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,422
-I had to find a babysitter.
-Come on!

1431
01:13:28,505 --> 01:13:29,756
Everything happened like that.

1432
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:31,257
Wait, sorry.
You two know each other?

1433
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:32,559
-Yeah.
-Yeah, we know...

1434
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:33,794
How many female magicians
do you think

1435
01:13:33,877 --> 01:13:35,328
there are in the world?

1436
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,863
The fact there are three of us
in the room right now.

1437
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:38,164
Shocking. Shocking.

1438
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,666
-It's, like, mind blown.
-That's true.

1439
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:41,502
I'm surprised the universe
isn't folding in on itself.

1440
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:43,119
-Exactly.
-Abu Dhabi!

1441
01:13:44,287 --> 01:13:46,039
-Does he just do that?
-Mm-hmm.

1442
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:48,375
Sorry, I just... I'm a big fan
of yours, by the way.

1443
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:51,111
I was trying to figure out where
Veronika was gonna be next.

1444
01:13:51,194 --> 01:13:55,616
And, apparently, Vanderberg
Global has a motor sports team.

1445
01:13:55,699 --> 01:13:58,885
They're introducing a new car
this weekend in Abu Dhabi.

1446
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:01,021
So we can get Merritt back
and expose her.

1447
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:02,088
Yeah. Yeah.

1448
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,289
No, no, no.
I am not exposing her.

1449
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:04,491
I am not exposing anyone, okay?

1450
01:14:04,574 --> 01:14:06,126
I don't care
what The Eye wants. No.

1451
01:14:06,209 --> 01:14:07,961
We are swapping this for
Merritt, and then we are done.

1452
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:09,463
We're saving our friend,
we're not saving the world.

1453
01:14:09,546 --> 01:14:10,831
-And then what?
-What?

1454
01:14:10,914 --> 01:14:12,365
We just go back to our lives
and let her walk away?

1455
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,468
After Russia, you said,
"Magicians are entertainers,

1456
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:15,902
-"not superheroes."
-Oh, my God. Here we go.

1457
01:14:15,985 --> 01:14:17,303
And I'm starting to think
that you were right.

1458
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,005
She doesn't just launder money
like her father.

1459
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:20,807
You saw
what happened to Thaddeus.

1460
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:23,176
Obviously, I'm playing
a bit of catch-up here, right?

1461
01:14:23,259 --> 01:14:24,578
I don't have
all of the information,

1462
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:26,647
but I don't think that
that should stop me

1463
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:28,649
from having an opinion
about what we do next.

1464
01:14:28,732 --> 01:14:29,816
-Of course it should.
-Exactly.

1465
01:14:29,899 --> 01:14:30,917
No, it shouldn't, Atlas.

1466
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,986
And I think we should
expose Vanessa.

1467
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:34,054
-Veronika.
-Veronika.

1468
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:35,255
For murder and...

1469
01:14:35,338 --> 01:14:36,356
-What is the other thing?
-Money laundering.

1470
01:14:36,439 --> 01:14:37,424
And for money laundering.

1471
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:39,092
For murder
and for money laundering.

1472
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:40,527
-Yeah. Yeah.
-We should tie her up...

1473
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:42,563
No, no! It is too dangerous!

1474
01:14:42,646 --> 01:14:43,864
-And Atlas is right.
-What?

1475
01:14:43,947 --> 01:14:44,931
We are done
sacrificing ourselves.

1476
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:46,099
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry. It's not worth it.

1477
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:47,568
That's bullshit!

1478
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:49,002
-What?
-You're wrong.

1479
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:51,004
-Am I?
-Sorry.

1480
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:53,022
No. Don't be sorry.
Say it.

1481
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:56,610
You are.
You're wrong. It's just...

1482
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:00,614
Before I discovered
the Horsemen,

1483
01:15:00,697 --> 01:15:02,182
I didn't give a shit
about anything.

1484
01:15:02,265 --> 01:15:04,300
I... My family gave me up.

1485
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:06,469
I hated the whole world.

1486
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:11,391
And then,
I saw a video of you guys,

1487
01:15:11,474 --> 01:15:14,027
and you were trying
to make the world

1488
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:18,281
less corrupt, less terrible.

1489
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:23,570
And that made me give a shit.

1490
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,028
So what's the trick?

1491
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:37,450
I promise
this is gonna work.

1492
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,085
But is that enough misdirection?

1493
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:42,288
As long as
she's here and not there.

1494
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:43,624
We can take care of that.

1495
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:45,559
If you're even
just five minutes late...

1496
01:15:45,642 --> 01:15:47,728
-Five? I'd say one.
-One minute late.

1497
01:15:47,811 --> 01:15:49,796
How do we know enough people
are gonna show up?

1498
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,498
You guys, it's already viral.

1499
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:53,433
I guarantee there'll be a crowd.

1500
01:15:53,516 --> 01:15:54,668
This is nuts.
There's too many variables.

1501
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,302
Hey, we'll be
in constant contact with you

1502
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:57,904
-if something goes awry...
-Hey, hey, hey.

1503
01:15:57,987 --> 01:16:00,807
There's, like, no margin
for error here, man. Okay? Zero.

1504
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,609
We're going to have to be
absolutely flawless

1505
01:16:02,692 --> 01:16:04,444
if we're gonna
pull something this risky off

1506
01:16:04,527 --> 01:16:05,979
with this many moving parts

1507
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,781
in this ridiculously
short amount of time, okay?

1508
01:16:07,864 --> 01:16:08,982
-Yes.
-Yeah.

1509
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,784
But speaking for myself,
at least,

1510
01:16:10,867 --> 01:16:13,654
I think the seven of us have
a better chance than most.

1511
01:16:13,737 --> 01:16:15,188
Oh.

1512
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:16,990
Would you look at this?

1513
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,575
When did the great
Bosco Leroy go soft?

1514
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:23,012
Okay, guys,
are we doing this or what?

1515
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,115
It is a ten million to one shot.

1516
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,351
Those are my kind of odds.

1517
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:40,480
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1518
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:42,649
<i>the time has come.</i>

1519
01:16:42,732 --> 01:16:44,734
<i>Tonight, for one night only.</i>

1520
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:49,122
<i>-Come in close.</i>
<i>-Closer.</i>

1521
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:51,191
<i>'Cause the more
you think you see...</i>

1522
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:53,627
<i>The easier it will be
to fool you.</i>

1523
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:55,128
<i>The countdown begins.</i>

1524
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:56,563
<i>In only two hours,</i>

1525
01:16:56,646 --> 01:16:59,165
<i>the Four Horsemen
will be on stage together</i>

1526
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:01,450
<i>for the first time in ten years.</i>

1527
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:04,170
<i>J. Daniel Atlas.</i>

1528
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:10,660
<i>Henley Reeves.</i>

1529
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:17,566
<i>Jack Wilder.</i>

1530
01:17:22,772 --> 01:17:24,357
<i>And Lula May.</i>

1531
01:17:28,444 --> 01:17:31,898
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the Four Horsemen.</i>

1532
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:35,368
<i>That's right, the Horsemen
are back for one night only.</i>

1533
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:37,738
<i>Now, last week,
we stole the Heart Diamond,</i>

1534
01:17:37,821 --> 01:17:40,240
<i>and tonight, in two hours' time,</i>

1535
01:17:40,323 --> 01:17:42,208
<i>we're going to return it
to its rightful owner,</i>

1536
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:43,910
<i>all of you.</i>

1537
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:48,181
Do you think
that got her attention?

1538
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:49,549
If that didn't,
I don't know what will.

1539
01:17:49,632 --> 01:17:50,617
All right, listen,
now that you know

1540
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,085
how bad things can actually get,

1541
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:54,753
can you please just try
playing it safe this one time?

1542
01:17:56,072 --> 01:17:57,123
-No.
-Okay.

1543
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:58,959
Oh.

1544
01:17:59,042 --> 01:18:00,593
Here she is.
Right on time.

1545
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:01,962
You enjoying the show?

1546
01:18:02,045 --> 01:18:04,464
<i>Eh, it's
a little tacky for my taste.</i>

1547
01:18:04,547 --> 01:18:08,802
I assume you chose your venue
for its proximity to my own.

1548
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:10,236
Well, good news for you.

1549
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:13,239
I've placed you
on our guest list.

1550
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:16,710
Bring me my Heart.
We'll make an exchange.

1551
01:18:16,793 --> 01:18:18,745
Mr. McKinney
for the diamond.

1552
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:21,547
-Mm-hmm.
<i>-Outside, under the lights,</i>

1553
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:24,450
and not the first hint of magic.

1554
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,486
One rabbit comes out of a hat,

1555
01:18:26,569 --> 01:18:28,789
one ace slides out of a sleeve,

1556
01:18:28,872 --> 01:18:31,875
and your friend goes poof.

1557
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,378
Just trying to use parlance
you'd understand.

1558
01:18:38,314 --> 01:18:40,466
<i>♪ Abracadabra, amor-oo-na-na ♪</i>

1565
01:19:03,206 --> 01:19:05,358
Welcome to the W Yas Island.

1566
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:07,160
The Orlando of the Middle East.

1567
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:08,328
Ha.

1568
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,332
Now, finally,

1569
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:14,467
thank you to Yas Island
for hosting an event

1570
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:17,704
worthy of the fastest team
in motor sport.

1571
01:19:18,922 --> 01:19:20,807
This track is elite,

1572
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:22,876
but it will soon provide
our competitors

1573
01:19:22,959 --> 01:19:25,678
with the most common view
in racing,

1574
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,014
the rear wings of our cars.

1575
01:19:29,565 --> 01:19:30,984
Thank you.

1576
01:19:31,067 --> 01:19:33,769
Holy shit. That's Veronika?

1577
01:19:34,938 --> 01:19:37,523
She has a very
commanding presence.

1578
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,160
Our magical friends
have arrived.

1579
01:19:40,243 --> 01:19:41,694
Why don't you go and greet them?

1580
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,364
Thank you so much for coming.
I hope you enjoy the race.

1581
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:46,532
Okay, Atlas said
to create a distraction.

1582
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,134
How are we gonna pull this off?

1583
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:49,853
There is security everywhere.

1584
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,725
Okay, you guys, calm down.
I got this.

1585
01:19:53,656 --> 01:19:55,075
Hello. Hi.

1586
01:19:55,158 --> 01:19:57,243
Uh, David. Cool.
I'm from media relations.

1587
01:19:57,326 --> 01:19:58,845
I was just checking in.

1588
01:19:58,928 --> 01:20:01,514
Do you think you guys could do
a different camera placement?

1589
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:02,916
Okay, thanks. Continue.

1590
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:04,217
Who is that?

1591
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,601
Your turn.

1592
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:07,770
Let's do this.

1593
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:10,156
Make sure you confirm

1594
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,858
the authenticity of the diamond.

1595
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:14,010
These people are very tricky.

1596
01:20:15,278 --> 01:20:16,763
I'm so glad you came.

1597
01:20:16,846 --> 01:20:18,765
What do you say
we bury the hatchet?

1598
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:20,901
-In each other's necks?
-Ha! He's funny.

1599
01:20:20,984 --> 01:20:24,270
We each possess something
beneficial to the other.

1600
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:25,939
Perfect reason to do business.

1601
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:27,407
Only, there's one caveat.

1602
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:30,710
I fervently hope our mutual
dealings are at a close.

1603
01:20:30,793 --> 01:20:32,412
-She's so poised.
-Not now.

1604
01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:34,197
-I hate her... Ugh.
-Lula. Shh.

1605
01:20:35,298 --> 01:20:36,950
-How's it going?
-Bro, can I help you?

1606
01:20:37,033 --> 01:20:38,584
Yeah, we're here
to shoot the car.

1607
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,887
-ID?
-Oh, right. Of course.

1608
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:42,422
Obviously. There you are.

1609
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,357
-And you?
-Uh, yeah,

1610
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,142
it's in my jacket somewhere.

1611
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,030
There it is.

1612
01:20:50,113 --> 01:20:51,297
We're with <i>Checkered Flags,</i>
the doc series.

1613
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:52,732
Next season's on
Vanderberg Motorsports.

1614
01:20:52,815 --> 01:20:54,367
They seriously didn't
give you guys a heads-up?

1615
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,036
Typical.

1616
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:58,471
We're just gonna get some
inserts, maybe some B-roll

1617
01:20:58,554 --> 01:21:00,974
and some party people
gawking at this beauty.

1618
01:21:01,057 --> 01:21:02,943
-All right, whenever you're...
-Oi, don't touch the car.

1619
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:04,577
-We got to shoot the interior.
-Yeah.

1620
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,246
I can actually get you
a cameo in this thing.

1621
01:21:06,329 --> 01:21:09,465
-Save it. I've got my orders.
-Yeah, and so do we.

1622
01:21:10,499 --> 01:21:11,918
Good evening,
Ms. Vanderberg.

1623
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:14,620
Yeah. We're trying to get
that footage you asked for,

1624
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:16,990
but we ran into
a little bit of a problem.

1625
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:19,092
-You're gonna be in trouble.
-She wants to talk to you.

1626
01:21:19,175 --> 01:21:22,162
That's not good, my guy.
Mm-mm. Not good.

1627
01:21:22,245 --> 01:21:23,729
Hello.

1628
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:25,765
<i>Listen, my father always said</i>

1629
01:21:25,848 --> 01:21:28,768
<i>no one buys
a diamond sight unseen.</i>

1630
01:21:28,851 --> 01:21:32,138
<i>And at this very moment,
my car is the diamond.</i>

1631
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,740
So, you can
either let them do their job,

1632
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:36,642
or you can
find yourself a new one.

1633
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,861
Sorry for the hold-up, ma'am.

1634
01:21:42,065 --> 01:21:43,649
-You're good.
-You're the best.

1635
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:45,751
If you could just back up
for me really quick?

1636
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:47,520
Just for the light.
Thanks, man.

1637
01:21:50,773 --> 01:21:52,158
Well, shall we get on with it?

1638
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,276
Please.

1639
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:57,427
Oh. Of course, you have
a goon. Forgive me.

1640
01:21:59,715 --> 01:22:01,034
Ah, come on, you don't trust us?

1641
01:22:01,117 --> 01:22:02,918
After all we've been through?

1642
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:08,942
Is there a problem?

1643
01:22:09,025 --> 01:22:10,143
Double check
if you're not certain.

1644
01:22:10,226 --> 01:22:12,145
-It's the Heart.
-Yes, of course it is.

1645
01:22:12,228 --> 01:22:14,063
Now, please,
can you get our friend?

1646
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,033
Come on.

1647
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:23,556
There he is. Okay.

1648
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:25,291
-Ah!
-Hey.

1649
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:27,627
-Whew.
-You okay?

1650
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:29,829
Well, now that I know I'm
worth half a billion dollars.

1651
01:22:29,912 --> 01:22:31,531
I still think we got ripped off,
but it's good to see you.

1652
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:33,366
Signed, sealed, delivered.

1653
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,668
See, I'm a woman of my word.

1654
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:37,837
Stick around if you want,
enjoy the party.

1655
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,239
Hey! Hey!

1656
01:22:39,322 --> 01:22:41,374
What in God's name?

1657
01:22:45,728 --> 01:22:47,313
-Shit!
-Step aside!

1658
01:22:47,396 --> 01:22:48,881
Come on, how do you
make this thing go?

1659
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:52,318
I can't concentrate
with you yelling at me!

1660
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:53,987
Don't let him get away!

1661
01:22:55,771 --> 01:22:57,406
Excuse me!

1662
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:00,593
Call the police!

1663
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:02,195
You enjoying the show?

1664
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:04,863
You just gonna stand there
gawking or get my car back?

1665
01:23:07,216 --> 01:23:08,317
You did this.

1666
01:23:13,022 --> 01:23:14,374
Okay, here we go.

1667
01:23:16,059 --> 01:23:17,343
Okay, Atlas,
you wanted a distraction,

1668
01:23:17,426 --> 01:23:18,499
you got a distraction.

1669
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:23,266
Man, this thing is tail happy.

1670
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:31,791
Oh, man, what the hell?

1671
01:23:31,874 --> 01:23:34,794
We fell through
a trapdoor or something.

1672
01:23:34,877 --> 01:23:36,029
Is everybody okay?

1673
01:23:36,112 --> 01:23:37,546
-Where are we?
-No.

1674
01:23:39,382 --> 01:23:41,601
When I woke up this morning,
there was only one thing

1675
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:43,636
I wanted more than my diamond.

1676
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:46,072
My Horsemen under lock and key.

1677
01:23:46,155 --> 01:23:48,408
And now that I have both,

1678
01:23:48,491 --> 01:23:51,644
I must admit, I'm feeling
a little bit spoiled.

1679
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:53,746
While you were prepping
your little performance,

1680
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:56,082
I curated a trick of my own.

1681
01:23:56,165 --> 01:23:58,918
Five Horsemen trapped,
no escape.

1682
01:23:59,001 --> 01:24:01,087
You five may be
national treasures,

1683
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:03,256
but we have those here, too.

1684
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:05,491
Only they're hard to find,

1685
01:24:05,574 --> 01:24:07,760
because they're buried in sand.

1686
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,566
To the world,
it will appear you died

1687
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:15,935
in a failed escape act.

1688
01:24:16,018 --> 01:24:19,588
Now, let's see some magic.

1689
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,110
Fuck magic!
Somebody call for backup!

1690
01:24:24,193 --> 01:24:26,279
-Jack, call June.
-Anyone have service?

1691
01:24:26,362 --> 01:24:28,014
God, she must have scrambled
the cell signal.

1692
01:24:28,097 --> 01:24:29,315
She thought of everything!

1693
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,017
Lula, whose side are you on?

1694
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,319
I'm on our side, obviously, but
she also thought of everything.

1695
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:34,820
Both things can be true
at one time.

1696
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,856
The sand is getting higher.
The sand is getting bigger.

1697
01:24:36,939 --> 01:24:38,424
There's more sand
and it's getting larger.

1698
01:24:38,507 --> 01:24:40,426
Henley, Henley, uh,
first principle of escape.

1699
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:42,628
Uh, how long
is it survivable? Right.

1700
01:24:42,711 --> 01:24:44,430
Right. Great. Judging from
the rate of the flow,

1701
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:45,765
the volume of the box...

1702
01:24:45,848 --> 01:24:47,267
-Uh, yeah, we're screwed.
-Oh, amazing.

1703
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:49,435
Okay, how about the second
principle of escape then?

1704
01:24:49,518 --> 01:24:50,936
Okay, so that's the box itself.

1705
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:52,172
Is there a flaw?
Is there a weakness?

1706
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:53,273
Is there a back door?

1707
01:24:53,356 --> 01:24:55,108
Everybody just needs to check!

1708
01:24:55,191 --> 01:24:56,309
This side's sealed.

1709
01:24:56,392 --> 01:24:58,278
Shit. No, it's sealed,
sealed, sealed.

1710
01:25:00,363 --> 01:25:02,131
Everything's sealed.

1711
01:25:06,469 --> 01:25:08,237
Any chance
there's a third principle?

1712
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:17,163
I have what you're after.

1713
01:25:17,246 --> 01:25:18,398
<i>Perfect.</i>

1714
01:25:18,481 --> 01:25:20,383
<i>I will meet you
where the Heart resides.</i>

1715
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:23,085
I can hardly wait.

1716
01:25:28,257 --> 01:25:29,625
Straight to the vault.

1717
01:25:32,161 --> 01:25:34,514
No, no, no, no! Yes!

1718
01:25:36,332 --> 01:25:38,767
Help me, Ricky Bobby!
Help me!

1719
01:25:43,272 --> 01:25:44,590
Is this really gonna
happen right now?

1720
01:25:44,673 --> 01:25:47,193
We're just gonna die here
in this box? Really?

1721
01:25:47,276 --> 01:25:50,530
It's funny. A week ago,
I wanted to die,

1722
01:25:50,613 --> 01:25:53,065
and then... then I get
my reason to live back,

1723
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:55,235
and now,
we're actually gonna die.

1724
01:25:55,318 --> 01:25:57,403
How is that funny?

1725
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:59,439
Well, I mean,
it was funnier in my head.

1726
01:25:59,522 --> 01:26:00,740
It's... You know,
it's peculiar funny.

1727
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:02,608
No. Uh-uh. No.

1728
01:26:02,691 --> 01:26:04,177
We're out of options.

1729
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:05,678
God, I never should have
been that horrible

1730
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:09,149
about your website and
your costumes and the logo.

1731
01:26:09,232 --> 01:26:10,750
-Okay.
-It's not embarrassing

1732
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:12,852
that the "I" in "Wilder"
is a little magic wand.

1733
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:14,053
-I got it. That's...
-It's not.

1734
01:26:14,136 --> 01:26:15,788
-Thank you.
-It's cute and it's charming.

1735
01:26:15,871 --> 01:26:18,191
-That's enough.
-And I... I missed you.

1736
01:26:18,274 --> 01:26:20,926
Listen, I know I don't
always show it, but, um...

1737
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:22,528
I really do think
the world of all of you.

1738
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:27,300
I cannot believe
we're getting buried alive.

1739
01:26:27,383 --> 01:26:29,769
-I mean, it's like a Western.
-Wait, wait. Buried alive.

1740
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:31,304
That's, like,
an old magic tradition.

1741
01:26:31,387 --> 01:26:33,139
Sorry,
who do we know who did that?

1742
01:26:33,222 --> 01:26:35,908
Bill Shirk nearly died
doing that. Remember?

1743
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:38,811
He got into a Plexiglas coffin
and had it covered in sand.

1744
01:26:38,894 --> 01:26:41,447
But didn't the Plexiglas break?

1745
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:43,249
-The sand got wet.
-The sand got wet.

1746
01:26:43,332 --> 01:26:45,651
I remember now.
It rained the night before.

1747
01:26:45,734 --> 01:26:47,920
Okay, wet sand is heavier
than dry. It broke the glass.

1748
01:26:48,003 --> 01:26:50,890
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
If we broke that pipe,

1749
01:26:50,973 --> 01:26:52,158
then it would wet the sand,

1750
01:26:52,241 --> 01:26:54,126
and then it'll...
it'll break the box, right?

1751
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,061
If I could... If I could
wrap something around it,

1752
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:57,430
I might be able
to get some leverage.

1753
01:26:57,513 --> 01:26:58,598
Okay.

1754
01:26:58,681 --> 01:27:00,166
Merritt,
give me your belt.

1755
01:27:00,249 --> 01:27:02,101
Okay.
Okay, you got it. You got it.

1756
01:27:02,184 --> 01:27:03,336
-Yep, okay, okay.
-Come on.

1757
01:27:03,419 --> 01:27:04,737
-Good, good, good.
-You got this.

1758
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,939
-You got this.
-Come on. Come on.

1759
01:27:07,022 --> 01:27:09,342
-Yes! Yes!
-Yes!

1760
01:27:11,694 --> 01:27:13,078
Help me! Help me!
Pull me down!

1761
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:15,448
-Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-It's made up of metal.

1762
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,623
Nice, nice, nice, okay.

1763
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:28,761
<i>Pull over.</i>
<i>You have been surrounded.</i>

1764
01:27:28,844 --> 01:27:30,095
I'd love to pull over,

1765
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:32,332
but I'm finally getting
the hang of this.

1766
01:27:36,619 --> 01:27:38,704
I'm the greatest driver
in the world!

1767
01:27:52,301 --> 01:27:53,569
No, no, no, no.

1768
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:57,072
Watch out!

1769
01:27:58,974 --> 01:28:00,526
Damn it!

1770
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:02,194
<i>Turn off</i>
<i>the engine and exit the vehicle.</i>

1771
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,096
<i>We've got you surrounded.</i>

1772
01:28:04,179 --> 01:28:05,698
<i>Put your hands up
and don't move!</i>

1773
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:08,368
I'm sorry. Did I forget
to use my blinker?

1774
01:28:08,451 --> 01:28:09,652
You're under arrest.

1775
01:28:11,053 --> 01:28:14,039
Thank you, gentlemen.
Excellent work.

1776
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,876
We've had a red notice
for one Bosco Leroy.

1777
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:18,594
-Thank you.
-No problem.

1778
01:28:19,662 --> 01:28:21,497
Yep,
Atlas is gonna kill me.

1779
01:28:23,165 --> 01:28:25,885
-Water's coming in too fast.
-And the glass won't break.

1780
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:28,888
-All this for a diamond.
-We could use that now.

1781
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,556
Nothing cuts glass
like a diamond.

1782
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:33,826
Wait, whoa, whoa.
Wait, Henley. Henley.

1783
01:28:33,909 --> 01:28:36,862
Yes! I can hold my breath
for eight minutes.

1784
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:39,064
If anyone can get us
out of this, we can.

1785
01:29:01,404 --> 01:29:03,188
<i>We're</i>
<i>crossing into the desert, ma'am.</i>

1786
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:04,940
The dust storm is getting worse.

1787
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:14,233
What's he doing here?

1788
01:29:14,316 --> 01:29:17,653
Ms. Vanderberg's diamond that
you and your friends stole?

1789
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,956
Lost something?

1790
01:29:54,923 --> 01:29:56,158
That was fun.

1791
01:30:03,666 --> 01:30:05,651
-It's working!
-It's working.

1792
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:06,819
Everybody help!

1793
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:08,854
-Everybody help!
-Let's do it! Come on!

1794
01:30:29,324 --> 01:30:30,593
Come on.

1795
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,051
Henley, way to go!

1796
01:30:39,134 --> 01:30:40,553
-Oh, my God!
-Nice job!

1797
01:30:40,636 --> 01:30:42,688
All right,
we got a show to catch.

1798
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:44,323
I hope we're not too late.

1799
01:30:44,406 --> 01:30:45,808
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1800
01:31:02,224 --> 01:31:03,275
<i>Identity verified.</i>

1801
01:31:24,246 --> 01:31:25,480
You made it.

1802
01:31:26,915 --> 01:31:28,233
Do you have what I want?

1803
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:31,319
If you have what I want.

1804
01:31:34,857 --> 01:31:36,091
Where's the evidence?

1805
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:44,633
Right here.

1806
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:47,219
I'm the evidence.

1807
01:31:47,302 --> 01:31:49,304
No.

1808
01:31:50,673 --> 01:31:53,441
Charlie, I... I don't...

1809
01:31:54,977 --> 01:31:56,044
You're dead.

1810
01:31:58,046 --> 01:31:59,214
Now you see me.

1811
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:07,239
It's quite fascinating
the things people do

1812
01:32:07,322 --> 01:32:10,893
to make something or someone...

1813
01:32:12,327 --> 01:32:13,395
disappear.

1814
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:19,401
Ah.

1815
01:32:27,142 --> 01:32:28,661
I taught you that trick.

1816
01:32:28,744 --> 01:32:31,346
Just like our father taught you.

1817
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:34,433
And now,
after 15 years, you're...

1818
01:32:34,516 --> 01:32:35,768
you're trying to ruin me?

1819
01:32:35,851 --> 01:32:36,885
No.

1820
01:32:38,086 --> 01:32:39,922
All 15 years.

1821
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:43,275
I didn't know
you'd be in that car.

1822
01:32:43,358 --> 01:32:46,729
But you must have been
relieved to hear I was.

1823
01:32:47,763 --> 01:32:49,114
When we hit the water,

1824
01:32:49,197 --> 01:32:52,618
I couldn't unbuckle
my seat belt.

1825
01:32:52,701 --> 01:32:55,704
Mom freed me
with her dying breath.

1826
01:32:56,805 --> 01:32:59,074
I had nothing but fondness
for you, Charlie.

1827
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:03,929
Let me finally treat you
like a brother.

1828
01:33:04,012 --> 01:33:05,347
I am your brother!

1829
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:10,552
Father's blood is in both of us,

1830
01:33:11,954 --> 01:33:15,123
though he'd never
acknowledge mine.

1831
01:33:15,891 --> 01:33:17,209
God knows Mother begged.

1832
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:19,645
And the shame drove
my mother to her grave.

1833
01:33:19,728 --> 01:33:22,197
Then you sent mine to hers!

1834
01:33:24,733 --> 01:33:25,985
Fine.

1835
01:33:26,068 --> 01:33:27,435
You're right.

1836
01:33:30,538 --> 01:33:32,040
It should be yours.

1837
01:33:33,575 --> 01:33:34,743
Here.

1838
01:33:36,979 --> 01:33:38,080
Take it.

1839
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,809
Bullet catch.

1840
01:34:07,676 --> 01:34:11,063
-That's impossible.
-No. Just magic.

1841
01:34:14,316 --> 01:34:15,517
Ah.

1842
01:34:16,018 --> 01:34:17,119
Hmm.

1843
01:34:26,194 --> 01:34:28,280
Hello, everyone.

1844
01:34:28,363 --> 01:34:29,531
Thank you.

1845
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:32,752
All right, thank you.

1846
01:34:32,835 --> 01:34:34,586
Earlier tonight,
J. Daniel Atlas

1847
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:36,689
promised to return
the Heart Diamond

1848
01:34:36,772 --> 01:34:37,823
to its rightful owner.

1849
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:41,060
But before we do that,

1850
01:34:41,143 --> 01:34:43,228
some introductions are in order.

1851
01:34:43,311 --> 01:34:47,933
First, let's say hello
to the fierce force of nature,

1852
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:50,836
the extraordinary June Rouclere!

1853
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:54,974
Yeah, June!

1854
01:34:55,057 --> 01:34:57,376
Wow. Hello, everyone.
Thank you.

1855
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:00,880
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1856
01:35:00,963 --> 01:35:04,049
And give it up
for the indomitable

1857
01:35:04,132 --> 01:35:06,752
Bosco Leroy!

1858
01:35:07,903 --> 01:35:09,955
The pleasure is ours.

1859
01:35:10,038 --> 01:35:12,091
Hello, gorgeous.

1860
01:35:15,577 --> 01:35:17,596
And, of course,
we could not have done

1861
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:19,765
any of this in the first place

1862
01:35:19,848 --> 01:35:23,435
without the help of the
world's greatest magicians.

1863
01:35:23,518 --> 01:35:24,603
The Four...

1864
01:35:24,686 --> 01:35:27,539
Sorry, make that Five Horsemen!

1865
01:35:40,836 --> 01:35:41,854
Thank you, everyone.

1866
01:35:41,937 --> 01:35:44,990
Wow. Uh...

1867
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:47,026
You know,
we have entertained, well,

1868
01:35:47,109 --> 01:35:49,929
dazzled audiences
all over the world,

1869
01:35:50,012 --> 01:35:53,298
but we have never been
part of a trick like this.

1870
01:35:53,381 --> 01:35:55,000
And you may be
asking yourself,

1871
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:57,136
"How did they
pull this off?"

1872
01:35:57,219 --> 01:36:00,806
Okay, well, every magician
needs an assistant. Veronika?

1873
01:36:03,125 --> 01:36:04,881
You may think
Veronika here,

1874
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:07,913
as Peter Vanderberg's sole heir,

1875
01:36:07,996 --> 01:36:10,082
is the rightful owner
of this diamond.

1876
01:36:10,165 --> 01:36:12,317
But, here's the twist.

1877
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,887
Peter didn't have one child.
He had two.

1878
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:16,288
That's right.

1879
01:36:16,371 --> 01:36:18,891
And that other child
cheated death.

1880
01:36:18,974 --> 01:36:20,893
And landed in New York City.

1881
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:26,748
<i>Where vengeance
became his life's work.</i>

1882
01:36:28,884 --> 01:36:30,502
<i>But he would need help.</i>

1883
01:36:30,585 --> 01:36:33,388
Oh. Found the scotch.
Thanks.

1884
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:35,674
<i>So he recruited.</i>

1885
01:36:35,757 --> 01:36:36,742
...when to stop,
tell me when.

1886
01:36:36,825 --> 01:36:37,843
Stop.

1887
01:36:37,926 --> 01:36:38,978
-Is that your card?
-Yes.

1888
01:36:39,061 --> 01:36:40,712
Yeah? You want to know
how I did it?

1889
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:41,830
<i>Enticed...</i>

1890
01:36:43,899 --> 01:36:46,218
<i>and lured some of the most</i>

1891
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:48,070
<i>brilliant minds
he could assemble,</i>

1892
01:36:49,504 --> 01:36:53,075
<i>laying the groundwork
for a trick unlike any other.</i>

1893
01:36:55,243 --> 01:36:57,863
<i>Which brings us
to tonight.</i>

1894
01:36:57,946 --> 01:37:01,166
Make some noise for the
mastermind behind all of this.

1895
01:37:01,249 --> 01:37:02,734
Our best friend.

1896
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:05,737
-A ghost...
-Until this very moment.

1897
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,706
Charlie Vanderberg!

1898
01:37:11,093 --> 01:37:12,928
-Wow.
-Whoo!

1899
01:37:16,264 --> 01:37:18,217
I know I said
I'd enjoy taking you down,

1900
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:20,152
but this is more fun
than I anticipated.

1901
01:37:20,235 --> 01:37:22,888
You are still a sad
and pathetic man.

1902
01:37:22,971 --> 01:37:24,189
And you are nothing.

1903
01:37:24,272 --> 01:37:26,058
Oh, hold on, everyone.
One sec.

1904
01:37:26,141 --> 01:37:27,526
-And you never will be.
-What's that?

1905
01:37:27,609 --> 01:37:28,894
I don't understand
how you pulled this off.

1906
01:37:28,977 --> 01:37:30,062
You don't understand?

1907
01:37:30,145 --> 01:37:32,464
Veronika doesn't
seem to understand

1908
01:37:32,547 --> 01:37:34,466
how she found herself
in this position.

1909
01:37:34,549 --> 01:37:36,701
Well, let's explain it to her.

1910
01:37:36,784 --> 01:37:42,207
You see, the finest magic
preys on assumptions.

1911
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:43,675
<i>That the car waiting for you</i>

1912
01:37:43,758 --> 01:37:45,410
<i>was the same one
that dropped you off.</i>

1913
01:37:45,493 --> 01:37:46,478
Let's go.

1914
01:37:50,298 --> 01:37:53,701
<i>That an act of
Mother Nature is nothing but.</i>

1915
01:38:05,347 --> 01:38:06,966
<i>And that
a vault in the desert</i>

1916
01:38:07,049 --> 01:38:08,850
<i>isn't just smoke and mirrors.</i>

1917
01:38:13,555 --> 01:38:16,691
<i>That a gun
isn't filled with blanks.</i>

1918
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:18,978
<i>And that an elevator</i>

1919
01:38:19,061 --> 01:38:22,114
<i>is just simply
descending into earth.</i>

1920
01:38:22,197 --> 01:38:25,517
If you want to trick
the master of deception,

1921
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,003
you have to
manipulate her reality.

1922
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:30,355
And for our last trick,

1923
01:38:30,438 --> 01:38:32,691
why don't we make
Veronika disappear?

1924
01:38:34,676 --> 01:38:35,794
No.

1925
01:38:35,877 --> 01:38:37,262
You don't win.

1926
01:38:37,345 --> 01:38:39,764
-I'm the Vanderberg family!
-There she is.

1927
01:38:39,847 --> 01:38:41,033
Miss you already.

1928
01:38:41,116 --> 01:38:43,102
-Final reveal!
-Do you hear me?

1929
01:38:43,185 --> 01:38:44,603
The real Veronika Vanderberg.

1930
01:38:44,686 --> 01:38:46,771
The Vanderbergs do not lose!

1931
01:38:46,854 --> 01:38:49,141
The world is full of illusions.

1932
01:38:49,224 --> 01:38:51,276
One of the biggest
is that this diamond

1933
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:54,113
belongs to
the Vanderbergs at all.

1934
01:38:54,196 --> 01:38:57,682
As my father's only
un-incarcerated next of kin,

1935
01:38:57,765 --> 01:39:00,986
I'll make sure every one
of our illicit buyers

1936
01:39:01,069 --> 01:39:02,988
faces legal repercussions.

1937
01:39:03,071 --> 01:39:06,025
And then
I'll gift all our assets,

1938
01:39:06,108 --> 01:39:07,893
including the Heart,

1939
01:39:07,976 --> 01:39:11,130
to the South African
communities they came from

1940
01:39:11,213 --> 01:39:14,133
with a few extra dollars
left for all of you.

1941
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:18,904
Horsemen crowds always leave
with deeper pockets.

1942
01:39:18,987 --> 01:39:21,189
-Nice trick.
-I learned from the best.

1943
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:24,259
Thank you.

1944
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:26,311
Thank you.

1945
01:39:26,394 --> 01:39:29,864
Thank you for joining us,
all of us.

1946
01:39:31,166 --> 01:39:32,384
And please remember,

1947
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:35,387
no matter what cards
life deals you,

1948
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:38,640
you have to learn
to make your own magic.

1949
01:39:39,441 --> 01:39:40,659
Ladies and gentlemen...

1950
01:39:40,742 --> 01:39:43,362
We are the Horsemen.
Good night.

1951
01:40:11,973 --> 01:40:14,607
<i>(WHAT DO WE EVER REALLY KNOW?</i>

1952
01:40:19,381 --> 01:40:22,234

1954
01:40:24,619 --> 01:40:26,238
All right,
what do you want,

1955
01:40:26,321 --> 01:40:28,840
pomegranate or boysenberry?

1956
01:40:28,923 --> 01:40:30,909
Dude, I said I wanted a drink.

1957
01:40:30,992 --> 01:40:32,627
Just give it a try.

1958
01:40:34,696 --> 01:40:36,398
Kids today.

1959
01:40:41,169 --> 01:40:42,454
-Mm!
-Of course.

1960
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:43,655
That's pretty good.

1961
01:40:43,738 --> 01:40:44,956
-You wanna try?
-No.

1962
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:46,808
I think
you dropped this.

1963
01:40:47,809 --> 01:40:49,161
Oh. My old card.

1964
01:40:49,244 --> 01:40:50,595
Just in case you wanna frame it.

1965
01:40:50,678 --> 01:40:52,764
Thanks. I might.

1966
01:40:52,847 --> 01:40:55,100
You know, I still cannot
believe you're a Vanderberg.

1967
01:40:55,183 --> 01:40:56,501
Neither could she.

1968
01:40:56,584 --> 01:40:57,802
I was thinking I feel like

1969
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:59,438
we should start
our own group, you guys.

1970
01:40:59,521 --> 01:41:01,006
-A girls magic group?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1971
01:41:01,089 --> 01:41:03,708
-Yes.
-The Hor... Horsegirls.

1972
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:06,345
-No. Not that.
-Wait, Horsewomen.

1973
01:41:06,428 --> 01:41:07,679
-Not that.
-Ladies of the Horse.

1974
01:41:07,762 --> 01:41:08,913
-It wouldn't be that.
-Ponies!

1975
01:41:08,996 --> 01:41:09,981
-That's really bad.
-Yeah?

1976
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:11,416
Can I talk to you real quick?

1977
01:41:11,499 --> 01:41:12,851
Ooh!

1978
01:41:12,934 --> 01:41:14,853
I'm not trying to infiltrate
the Horsewomen.

1979
01:41:14,936 --> 01:41:16,504
What... what's up?

1980
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:18,673
Um...

1981
01:41:19,707 --> 01:41:20,859
-It's just...
-Speak.

1982
01:41:20,942 --> 01:41:22,361
What is the matter with you?
What's wrong?

1983
01:41:22,444 --> 01:41:24,629
It's hard because I don't...

1984
01:41:24,712 --> 01:41:26,198
I don't know how you feel.

1985
01:41:26,281 --> 01:41:27,332
And so...

1986
01:41:27,415 --> 01:41:29,301
Hey, uh, everybody.

1987
01:41:29,384 --> 01:41:31,870
Everybody, come on
over here, please.

1988
01:41:31,953 --> 01:41:33,938
Yeah? Come on, guys.

1989
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:37,709
Hey, can you grab some more of
those delicious things, Bosco?

1990
01:41:37,792 --> 01:41:41,513
You are gonna love this stuff.
It is slap.

1991
01:41:41,596 --> 01:41:43,615
-No, Merritt, please.
-It slaps.

1992
01:41:43,698 --> 01:41:45,150
What I meant to say is
it's good.

1993
01:41:45,233 --> 01:41:46,218
Yeah. Right.

1994
01:41:46,301 --> 01:41:48,520
Yes, and I will be
the one to say it.

1995
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:50,104
I'm going to miss you guys.

1996
01:41:51,406 --> 01:41:52,691
I was just thinking
the same thing.

1997
01:41:52,774 --> 01:41:53,875
Yeah. Me, too.

1998
01:41:54,776 --> 01:41:56,228
Damn it, I love you guys.

1999
01:41:56,311 --> 01:41:57,829
-Aw.
-We love you, too.

2000
01:41:57,912 --> 01:41:59,747
We love you.

2001
01:42:00,715 --> 01:42:01,900
-Adorable.
-Me, too.

2002
01:42:01,983 --> 01:42:03,302
Very sweet.
Even me?

2003
01:42:03,385 --> 01:42:05,304
Really?
You must be very drunk.

2004
01:42:05,387 --> 01:42:06,671
Whoa.

2005
01:42:06,754 --> 01:42:09,040
-Oh, my God.
-Just talk about something else.

2006
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:10,742
Go back to what...
We all love each other.

2007
01:42:10,825 --> 01:42:12,344
-You love him, he loves her.
-Fist bump. Fist bump.

2008
01:42:12,427 --> 01:42:13,712
You guys
love each other more.

2009
01:42:13,795 --> 01:42:15,080
Oh.

2010
01:42:15,163 --> 01:42:17,316
You guys expecting someone?

2011
01:42:17,399 --> 01:42:19,253
No one's supposed
to know where we are.

2012
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:38,670
-Who's it from?
-Doesn't say.

2013
01:42:38,753 --> 01:42:40,071
Open it.

2014
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:41,373
You open it.

2015
01:42:41,456 --> 01:42:42,490
Okay.

2016
01:42:49,631 --> 01:42:51,383
Oh, that's the... that's
the thing from the door.

2017
01:42:51,466 --> 01:42:52,784
-Yeah, from the chateau.
-Oh, yeah!

2018
01:42:52,867 --> 01:42:55,187
Do you, uh... You mind if
I take another crack at it?

2019
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:56,782
-Yeah, yeah, go for it.
-Yeah?

2020
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,426
I think I can handle it
this time.

2021
01:43:15,557 --> 01:43:16,775
Hello, Horsemen.

2022
01:43:17,992 --> 01:43:19,144
Did you miss me?

2023
01:43:19,227 --> 01:43:20,579
Dylan.

2024
01:43:20,662 --> 01:43:23,047
But he's supposed
to be in prison.

2025
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:26,084
I know what you're thinking.
"He lied to us."

2026
01:43:26,167 --> 01:43:27,486
But I...
I didn't lie to you.

2027
01:43:27,569 --> 01:43:29,988
I just led you to believe
something that wasn't true.

2028
01:43:30,071 --> 01:43:33,091
But it was
for your own good, trust me.

2029
01:43:33,174 --> 01:43:35,227
There's more to this mystery
than you realize.

2030
01:43:35,310 --> 01:43:36,428
And the end result

2031
01:43:36,511 --> 01:43:38,630
is that the Horsemen
are back together again.

2032
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:39,914
It warms my heart.

2033
01:43:41,749 --> 01:43:43,851
Now, for you three imposters,

2034
01:43:45,086 --> 01:43:46,905
brazenly pretending like

2035
01:43:46,988 --> 01:43:49,241
you're part of our
top secret organization?

2036
01:43:49,324 --> 01:43:51,910
You think you're gonna
get away with it

2037
01:43:51,993 --> 01:43:54,762
with no consequences
or repercussions?

2038
01:43:55,663 --> 01:43:56,664
Well...

2039
01:43:57,365 --> 01:43:58,750
you thought right.

2040
01:43:58,833 --> 01:44:00,735
-Hey!
-Welcome.

2041
01:44:01,436 --> 01:44:02,937
Welcome to The Eye.

2042
01:44:04,906 --> 01:44:06,441
As for the rest of you,

2043
01:44:07,375 --> 01:44:09,577
you thought your work was done.

2044
01:44:10,945 --> 01:44:12,246
Think again, team.

2045
01:44:13,348 --> 01:44:15,133
You're just getting started.

2046
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:20,254
