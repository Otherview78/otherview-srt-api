1
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,296
I'm so... I'm so glad you called.

2
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,340
I'm so glad you were free.

3
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,301
God, I love your eyes.

4
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,720
Okay, now what?

5
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:54,513
Cup my balls.

6
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,391
Okay, yes. All right. I can do that.

7
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,851
- There it is. - There we go.

8
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,938
That feels good.

9
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:04,315
You know what to do.

10
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,569
Okay, you know what? Slow it down, slow it down.

11
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:10,529
- Okay. - Slow it down.

12
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:12,365
- There we go. - How's that?

13
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,285
That's good, nice and slow. See? Doesn't that feel good?

14
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:17,577
- Yeah. - No, I want to go fast.

15
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,496
- You want to go fast? - Fast.

16
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:24,248
Yeah. No...

17
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,666
Oh, yeah. That feels good.

18
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:27,084
Oh, Yeah.

19
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:28,335
Yeah.

20
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:31,922
Okay. You know what? I think...

21
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:33,840
I think maybe we are on different rhythms here.

22
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:23,722
I was having a nightmare. I was so scared.

23
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:26,224
Good morning.

24
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:27,309
Good morning.

25
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:30,895
You look beautiful.

26
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:32,314
No, I'm sure I look terrible.

27
00:02:32,397 --> 00:02:34,357
I just woke up. Are you kidding?

28
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:36,233
I'm sure I'm a mess.

29
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:38,485
You slept over.

30
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:40,237
I did.

31
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:42,906
I thought we had a rule against that.

32
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:46,076
I'm kidding.

33
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,536
- That was funny. - I'm kidding.

34
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:49,495
You're funny in the morning.

35
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:51,163
- I like hanging out with you. - Yeah.

36
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:54,666
I love hanging out with you. I think we get along really well

37
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,420
and you're so sexy.

38
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,339
I know.

39
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,719
I just have a lot coming up at work

40
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:08,472
and I don't want to make promises I can't keep.

41
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:10,349
You know what I mean? I know you do.

42
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:12,392
Yeah. We're on the same page.

43
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:15,437
I'm not looking for a relationship right now, either. Let's just say that.

44
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,357
Whatever you wanna... I can do...

45
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,361
I'd rather just... I like simple... I'm not like other girls.

46
00:03:22,444 --> 00:03:25,530
I'm not like, "Be my boyfriend!" Unless you were like, "Yeah!"

47
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:27,616
Then I'd be like, "maybe".

48
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:29,992
But let's not.

49
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,119
I don't want that either.

50
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,383
Wow, this is so awkward. I really want you to leave,

51
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:49,261
but I don't know how to say it without sounding like a dick.

52
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:51,031
Come on! Hands behind your heads! Let's go! Sit-ups!

53
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,577
You're looking like pieces of bacon on a plate.

54
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,580
It's disgusting! I smell the fat!

55
00:04:58,372 --> 00:05:00,248
- He scares me. - Me, too.

56
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:01,458
But he's an excellent motivator.

57
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,750
That's true.

58
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,794
What are you looking at?

59
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:07,045
Oh, Shit, he sees us. Oh, God.

60
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:08,880
Hey! Hey!

61
00:05:09,297 --> 00:05:10,840
If you want to take this class,

62
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:13,008
you're going to have to pay for it

63
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,093
like the rest of these bitches!

64
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:18,263
What, are you dancing? In the park... Dance class?

65
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,223
You are not dancing. You are not dancing in the park!

66
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,225
- Go, go, go, go! - Freeloaders!

67
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:24,477
I'm coming over there.

68
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:26,103
- Is he coming? - I'm coming after you!

69
00:05:26,187 --> 00:05:28,564
Sorry, Rodney. We're on a budget.

70
00:05:28,647 --> 00:05:30,983
Oh, come on! It's only 12 bucks!

71
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:32,568
Oh, my God!

72
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:35,237
Come on! You fucking freeloaders.

73
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,658
- We are out of our minds. - I know.

74
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:41,744
That's okay. I'm so glad that we got to do this.

75
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:43,037
I feel like I haven't seen you in forever.

76
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:44,663
I've been in Chicago a lot.

77
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,749
I know. Sleeping at Dougie's house.

78
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:48,459
Well, it's just closer to work.

79
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,043
How is it going with him anyway?

80
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:53,003
I don't know. I mean, it's fine,

81
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:55,004
but I just feel like he's been distant later.

82
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:56,839
And I don't know...

83
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,383
He calls me "dude" a lot.

84
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:00,593
That doesn't mean anything.

85
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,052
I think everything is fine.

86
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:03,595
I don't know. Anyway,

87
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:05,430
what did you do last night?

88
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:08,934
What did you do last night?

89
00:06:11,268 --> 00:06:12,936
You are not telling me something.

90
00:06:14,938 --> 00:06:16,356
I hung out with Ted for a little bit.

91
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:19,359
- I knew it! - We had fun.

92
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:21,528
- It was fun. - Here's what I don't like about it.

93
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,906
You hate yourself after you see him, every time.

94
00:06:25,448 --> 00:06:27,200
And then we go through this, and then you feel like shit,

95
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:28,743
and it's almost like you're doing it

96
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:30,328
because you feel bad about yourself.

97
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:34,123
He called me late, and we hung out.

98
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:36,834
It wasn't a big deal. And you know what? It was fun.

99
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,294
You had sex with him.

100
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:43,632
We had an adult sleepover.

101
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,344
Did you let him sleep over in your mouth?

102
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:51,431
- Annie! - I'm sorry!

103
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:55,477
- You're unbelievable. - He kept putting it near my face.

104
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:56,936
They do that, don't they?

105
00:06:57,061 --> 00:06:58,145
Why do they do that? Let us offer.

106
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,480
If we don't offer...

107
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:00,565
Please. You're supposed to slap it away.

108
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:01,649
I couldn't.

109
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,528
You don't want to look right at it.

110
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:06,821
No.

111
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:09,949
It's too aggressive. It's like...

112
00:07:10,032 --> 00:07:11,408
"Hello."

113
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:12,534
That's my impression.

114
00:07:12,617 --> 00:07:13,577
Those are the balls?

115
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,244
Yeah. I'm trying to make it round,

116
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,953
but I can't because I have elbows.

117
00:07:19,622 --> 00:07:20,665
He is so hot, though.

118
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:25,003
Look, I know you say he's cute and all that stuff,

119
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:27,046
but it makes you feel like shit, you know?

120
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,132
You're a total catch, and any guy

121
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:31,259
would be psyched to be your man.

122
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:33,678
You should just make room

123
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:36,222
for somebody who is nice to you.

124
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:38,308
You know what? He's honest!

125
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,143
He told me that we are what we are

126
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:42,020
and we're just having fun. And I like that.

127
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:45,315
He also told you that you need dental work. He's an asshole.

128
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:51,195
I don't need dental work.

129
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:52,864
You're right.

130
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,157
There is nothing wrong with my teeth.

131
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,159
You are so beautiful.

132
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:58,453
- Will you marry me? - Yes.

133
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:02,498
I love you.

134
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:03,625
I love you.

135
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,462
I don't want to go to work today.

136
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:09,631
Let's see how many times Terry's called me.

137
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:10,715
Only 15!

138
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:12,341
You know what, Terry? I don't want

139
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:14,216
to pick up your monkey lamps. Sorry!

140
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:16,385
Monkey lamps?

141
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:19,347
I cannot wait to never work for a psychopath again.

142
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:21,931
Annie!

143
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,976
I'm sorry. I should have gone down Mason.

144
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:28,647
Well, I'm the genius that opened a bakery during the recession.

145
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:31,066
They were good cakes, Annie.

146
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:32,484
Thank you.

147
00:08:33,443 --> 00:08:35,695
Come on. Look away, look away, look away.

148
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:41,534
Do you have any ideas of styles?

149
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:42,786
Oh, I don't know. What do you think, honey?

150
00:08:42,911 --> 00:08:44,079
Whatever you want.

151
00:08:44,245 --> 00:08:46,205
Look at how you guys are making this decision together.

152
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,414
That's sweet. You guys love each other, huh?

153
00:08:48,498 --> 00:08:49,998
- Yeah. - Yeah.

154
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,834
That's sweet. That will go away.

155
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:00,634
You cannot trust anybody, ever.

156
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:02,928
Especially someone you're in a relationship with.

157
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:04,429
'Cause they're living with you, you don't

158
00:09:04,596 --> 00:09:06,056
know who you're sleeping next to. It is scary.

159
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,768
I mean, look at him. He may not even be Asian.

160
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,937
It is scary.

161
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:16,817
So did you guys want to look at these engagement rings?

162
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:19,151
- We're going to browse. - Okay, sure.

163
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,568
I'll be here.

164
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:25,782
Thank you.

165
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:27,659
What was that about?

166
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:31,537
Nothing. They had to run. They had to go somewhere.

167
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,789
And no wonder. You're selling lifelong happiness.

168
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:35,916
You're not telling everyone about your problems

169
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,501
and how your boyfriend left you,

170
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:39,169
and maybe marriage will work out.

171
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,797
Show me your "love is eternal" face.

172
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:47,469
No, that's two years, four years tops. That is not eternal.

173
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:50,305
Kahlua, can you come over here for a second, please?

174
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,141
What's up, Don-Don?

175
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:54,810
You make up the best nicknames.

176
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:57,688
You don't need a nickname because Kahlua is so delicious.

177
00:09:57,813 --> 00:09:58,981
Don't sue me for touching you.

178
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:02,609
Show Annie your "love is eternal" face.

179
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:11,827
That looks like you have menstrual cramps.

180
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:13,370
Thank you so much, Kahlua.

181
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,042
Now, why can't you be more like Kahlua?

182
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:20,169
Look, I'm trying really hard.

183
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:21,378
You've just got to try harder.

184
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:23,254
The whole reason you have got this job, Annie,

185
00:10:23,337 --> 00:10:26,298
is because your mom is my sponsor in AA, and I'm doing her a favour.

186
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:27,382
I understand.

187
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:31,011
Oscar, get back to work.

188
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,890
You shouldn't be behind the counter.

189
00:10:41,271 --> 00:10:43,856
Andrew, you are not the father!

190
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:47,693
That's great. Yeah.

191
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:52,531
Stop that. Don't do that.

192
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:55,785
Hey, Brynn.

193
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:57,244
Oh, hey, roomie.

194
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,038
- Guess what happened to me today. - What?

195
00:11:00,705 --> 00:11:02,248
- I got a free tattoo. - You did what?

196
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:05,168
I could not believe it. The guy said, "Do you want a tattoo?"

197
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:06,211
Just a random...

198
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:08,087
- Yeah, opened up the side of his van. - No.

199
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:10,590
He said, "It's for free!" And I said, "Sure".

200
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,008
- You said yes? - Yeah!

201
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:14,468
Yeah. Look. See here?

202
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:15,927
What is it?

203
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,053
See that?

204
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,639
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Brynn!

205
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,058
It's a Mexican drinking worm.

206
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,394
It's a Native American symbol meaning "wasted".

207
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,480
Okay, Brynn, just so you know, it's...

208
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,190
- Gil, hi. - Hello. How are you?

209
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,943
Have you seen your sister's tattoo? It's really infected.

210
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,194
Better get a little bit of ice on it.

211
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,445
Yeah, a little bit.

212
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,863
Stick some frozen peas on there.

213
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,990
- Yeah. It can't hurt. - All right.

214
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,409
So, I just wanted a quick word.

215
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,329
You know that tomorrow the rent is due.

216
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,580
I was getting my check, and I wondered

217
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,915
if I could get your check, too?

218
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,251
Yes. I'm getting the money.

219
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,003
It's been a little slow.

220
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:58,009
You have to keep it in the bag and put the bag on it.

221
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,683
So, the check?

222
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,851
- Yes. Yes. - Yeah.

223
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:11,271
Because it's a kind of, like, "needing it today"-type situation.

224
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:12,438
It's coming.

225
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:16,109
- Who is it? - Me!

226
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,277
Who is it?

227
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,237
Oh, my God. Hurry up, your creepy neighbour asked me

228
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,864
if I wanted to watch the news again.

229
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:22,490
Sorry. He is so gross.

230
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:25,034
Please, come on in. Let me take your magazines.

231
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:28,204
Welcome to the magazine and wine party.

232
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:30,164
Have a seat.

233
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:32,500
I'm very happy that you are here.

234
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:35,628
- What? - Because I want to eat an apple.

235
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:38,256
Would you like some apple?

236
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:42,509
- What is that? - I got engaged.

237
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:44,177
- What? - He asked me last night.

238
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:45,929
- What? - I know!

239
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:47,472
That's why he's been acting so weird

240
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:49,725
'cause he's a terrible liar, and he thought he was gonna blow it.

241
00:12:49,808 --> 00:12:50,851
He was ignoring me and I thought

242
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:52,060
he was going to break up with me.

243
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:53,270
Oh, my gosh.

244
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:56,607
Oh, my gosh!

245
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:57,774
I know!

246
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,359
LiI!

247
00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:00,903
I'm shocked, still.

248
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:02,487
But I'm happy. Can you believe this?

249
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:05,364
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I just got hot.

250
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:06,699
You did? Are you okay?

251
00:13:06,782 --> 00:13:07,742
Yes. My pits are sweating.

252
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:09,409
- My stomach hurts. I'm hot. - What does that mean?

253
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:12,661
Oh, my God! What is happening?

254
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:14,914
I don't know. I'm wearing a ring.

255
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:16,582
I can't believe it.

256
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:17,833
Lil, you're getting married.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,208
I'm getting married.

258
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:21,836
And you'll be my maid of honour.

259
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:24,422
God, of course I will!

260
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:25,881
- It will be super fun. - It's gonna be really fun.

261
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:28,008
Yeah. You know, we can plan everything together.

262
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:30,636
My God! Planning your wedding...

263
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:31,969
Are you sure you're up for it?

264
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:34,305
I know it's a lot to ask and to put on your plate.

265
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:37,349
And you're going through a tricky time, and you're super-busy...

266
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:38,934
- Stop. - It's a lot to ask.

267
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:40,060
- Stop. - Okay.

268
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:43,896
It's fine. And I'm more than happy to do it, and it's not too much.

269
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:47,232
Look at that. It's my fiancé calling.

270
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:48,776
Oh, your fiancé.

271
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:50,443
Hi, baby, what's up?

272
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:54,906
It's Annie. I just told her! Yeah, she's so happy.

273
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:56,281
No, I'm not!

274
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,532
"Yay", she said.

275
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:01,576
What, baby?

276
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:03,995
I know, I miss you, too.

277
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,624
Yeah, I'll meet you in an hour.

278
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,792
I love you, too.

279
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:34,566
Wow.

280
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:36,819
Wynonna Judd.

281
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:38,653
That's really good.

282
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:42,489
Painting those giant bangs was a royal pain in my can.

283
00:14:42,572 --> 00:14:45,617
And those teeth! I should have painted her mouth shut.

284
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:48,078
Can you just get dressed? We're gonna be late for the engagement party.

285
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:49,287
- Oh, I forgot to tell you, honey. - What?

286
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:50,497
- Forgot to tell you. - What?

287
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,418
I signed up to speak at AA tonight, and I just have to.

288
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:55,711
- Mom! - No.

289
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,296
I forgot. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

290
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,841
I keep telling you, you're not supposed to go to those things.

291
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:02,008
You're not an alcoholic.

292
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:04,051
Only because I've never had a drink.

293
00:15:04,927 --> 00:15:07,263
- What? - They are inspiring.

294
00:15:07,513 --> 00:15:09,932
There is this one story I've just got to tell you. Sit down.

295
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:11,392
Okay.

296
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:12,893
This gentleman

297
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:16,146
who started blow-jobbing to get crack. His name is Marvin Johnson...

298
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:20,025
- Mom, anonymous. You keep... It's no names. - Okay, okay.

299
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:22,360
Forget it. Marvin J. Whatever.

300
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:25,029
- Too late. - Well, he became a gay prostitute.

301
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:27,406
And he realised that he had hit his bottom.

302
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:30,034
And I have been thinking, honey,

303
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:32,995
that maybe this is your bottom.

304
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:36,915
I'm telling you, hitting bottom is a good thing.

305
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:38,751
Because there's nowhere to go but up.

306
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:40,627
Because there's nowhere to go but up.

307
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:42,129
- Right? - Yep. That's what you say.

308
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:44,465
- Yeah, a positive message. - Yeah.

309
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:46,592
Yeah. Thanks for the pep talk, Mom.

310
00:15:46,675 --> 00:15:48,761
Honey. Anytime, anytime.

311
00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:51,597
All right. I guess I'm going to Lillian's party by myself, then.

312
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:53,974
Don't talk to me about being by yourself.

313
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:56,393
I go everywhere by myself.

314
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:58,020
Thanks to that new whore, Barb.

315
00:15:58,103 --> 00:15:59,897
- Mom, come on. - No, I don't like to say it.

316
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,815
They've been married 12 years.

317
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,734
Okay. But she's still a whore.

318
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:07,321
I'm sure she greets him in the evening, beaver first.

319
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:10,073
I don't want to think about that.

320
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,743
I bet she got that car by giving your dad something sexually.

321
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:16,746
'Cause there was one thing I would never do,

322
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:18,247
and I'm sure Barb is a champion at it.

323
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:19,499
I don't want to know.

324
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,459
- It's called a "chicken coop". - Of course it is.

325
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:23,418
You start at the back and you peck your way

326
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:24,920
to the front like you have a beak.

327
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:28,256
And then you end up with two eggs in your mouth.

328
00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:31,092
That's gross.

329
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:32,803
Well, I'm sure your dad likes it.

330
00:16:32,886 --> 00:16:35,180
Of course, he grew up on a farm.

331
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:36,264
Okay.

332
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,600
You sure you don't want to move in with me?

333
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:42,145
Mom, thanks, but no way.

334
00:16:42,354 --> 00:16:43,688
- No way in hell. - Yeah?

335
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:44,773
No, thanks.

336
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:46,274
- Think about it. - Okay.

337
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:47,484
You don't need your own place.

338
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,527
- Yeah, I kind of do. - Okay.

339
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:50,945
- All right, I'm going to go. - All right.

340
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:14,385
Holy shit.

341
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:19,056
Valet. Perfect.

342
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,520
Sorry. Needs a wash.

343
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,736
You have to punch it a few times.

344
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,834
Annie!

345
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:49,752
Oh, my God!

346
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,755
- Oh, my God, Lillian. - I know.

347
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:54,924
- This is your engagement party. - Isn't that crazy?

348
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,676
It's so beautiful.

349
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,761
I can't believe Dougie's boss is a member here.

350
00:17:58,887 --> 00:18:02,432
I know, and his parents, too. And Dougie, I guess.

351
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,725
Gosh, and me, I guess, too, now.

352
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:07,728
Come on, let's go say hi to the rest of the bridal party!

353
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:10,439
You remember my cousin Rita?

354
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,565
- Rita. - Annie.

355
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:16,444
I haven't seen you since you graduated high school.

356
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:17,820
She has three kids now.

357
00:18:17,945 --> 00:18:20,031
- Three boys. - They're so cute.

358
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:22,783
They are cute, but when they reach that age,

359
00:18:22,992 --> 00:18:24,243
they are disgusting.

360
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:26,245
They smell, they are sticky,

361
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:28,413
they say things that are horrible,

362
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:31,541
and there is semen all over everything, okay?

363
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,209
Disgusting.

364
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:35,378
I cracked a blanket in half.

365
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:37,213
- Do you get where I'm going with that? - I do.

366
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:38,505
I cracked it in half.

367
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:39,839
What?

368
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:42,550
Annie, this is Becca, my friend from work.

369
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:43,635
We are in the trenches together.

370
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:44,886
- Hey. It's great to meet you. - Hey, how are you?

371
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:46,220
Nice to meet you.

372
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:47,472
This is my husband, Kevin.

373
00:18:47,555 --> 00:18:48,765
- Hi. - "Husband."

374
00:18:48,848 --> 00:18:50,058
I like to say it. We are newlyweds.

375
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,392
Wow. Congratulations.

376
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,643
Thank you so much.

377
00:18:53,185 --> 00:18:55,354
We went on a sweetheart honeymoon.

378
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:57,688
Where did you guys go?

379
00:18:57,772 --> 00:18:59,148
- Disney World. - Disney World.

380
00:18:59,231 --> 00:19:00,607
We finish each other's sentences. Sorry.

381
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,363
Sorry. Is this your husband?

382
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:10,115
No, no, no, no, no.

383
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,909
I don't know him. I'm sorry.

384
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:14,745
Do you want to go for a walk later?

385
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:16,455
Oh. I can't.

386
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,748
- All right. - I can't. I'm sorry.

387
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:20,124
I'm so sorry.

388
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,293
I'm not with anybody. I'm here solo.

389
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:26,338
- Let's start it again. I'm Becca. - Rewind.

390
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:29,424
This is my husband. You don't have a husband.

391
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:31,510
Sorry.

392
00:19:31,593 --> 00:19:34,429
And this is Dougie's sister, Megan.

393
00:19:34,513 --> 00:19:35,597
- Hey. - Hi.

394
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:39,184
My grandma is not supposed to have wine. I'll be right back.

395
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:43,188
- Hey. - Hey. How is it going?

396
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:46,232
It's going great. It's going great. I'm on the mend.

397
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:48,150
I just got some pins in my legs.

398
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:52,363
Believe it or not, pins in my legs, I can still do this. Right?

399
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:54,865
I fell off a cruise ship, but I'm back.

400
00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:56,533
- Oh, shit. - Yeah, "Oh, shit".

401
00:19:57,117 --> 00:19:58,284
Yeah, "Oh, Shit".

402
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:02,789
Took a hard, hard, violent fall. Kind of pin-balled down.

403
00:20:02,872 --> 00:20:05,083
Hit a lot of railings, broke a lot of shit.

404
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,211
I'm not going to say I survived, I'm going to say I thrived.

405
00:20:08,753 --> 00:20:10,296
I met a dolphin down there.

406
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,591
And I swear to God, that dolphin looked not at me,

407
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:14,883
but into my soul.

408
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:16,635
Into my goddamn soul, Annie.

409
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:19,388
And he said, "I'm saving you, Megan".

410
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:24,059
Not with his mouth, but he said it, I'm assuming, telepathically.

411
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:28,772
We had a connection that I don't even know if I can... Jesus.

412
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:33,402
Hey, shut my mouth. Look at... Unbelievable.

413
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:34,653
You must be Annie's fella.

414
00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:36,946
I'm Megan. It's a pleasure.

415
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:40,116
He's not... I'm not... He's not... I'm not with him.

416
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:41,659
- Sorry. - All right.

417
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:44,954
I'm glad he's single, because I'm going to climb that like a tree.

418
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,083
Okay. You have to meet Helen.

419
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,835
There she is. Helen.

420
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,965
Come here!

421
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:02,180
Helen, this is Annie.

422
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:03,264
Hi!

423
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:06,225
There she is. Maid of honour.

424
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:09,437
So lovely to meet Lillian's childhood friend.

425
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,313
You are so pretty.

426
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,441
You are so cute! You are so sweet.

427
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:20,488
Helen is married to Dougie's boss, Mr Harris. Perry.

428
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,447
Perry. And they are so close now,

429
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,282
they are literally joined at the hip.

430
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:26,117
Which is good, because so are we.

431
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,412
I know. I'm so glad you guys are finally meeting.

432
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,498
- I know. Me, too. - I know. It's lovely.

433
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,334
Well, excuse me, I better go check on the hors d'oeuvres.

434
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,169
But it was great to finally meet you.

435
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,961
It's a great party.

436
00:21:38,045 --> 00:21:39,337
- Enjoy. - Bye.

437
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,796
- Bye. - Bye.

438
00:21:44,132 --> 00:21:45,175
She's great, isn't she?

439
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:46,885
She's awesome.

440
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:51,598
And I really look forward to having Doug as part of our family.

441
00:21:51,973 --> 00:21:53,892
So much so that you two should get married right now

442
00:21:53,975 --> 00:21:55,435
and save me a shitload of money.

443
00:21:56,103 --> 00:21:57,187
Dad.

444
00:21:57,771 --> 00:22:01,108
Everybody always laughs at that, but I'm not joking.

445
00:22:03,485 --> 00:22:04,528
I'm not joking.

446
00:22:05,737 --> 00:22:09,241
Anyway, I want to thank all of you for coming.

447
00:22:09,324 --> 00:22:12,285
And here's to Doug and my baby girl, Lillian.

448
00:22:12,536 --> 00:22:14,328
- Cheers! - Cheers!

449
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:15,955
- I love you, Dad. - Enough of me.

450
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:17,748
Let's get the maid of honour up here.

451
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,917
All right. Annie?

452
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:24,630
Hi. I'm Annie Walker.

453
00:22:24,922 --> 00:22:26,090
Yay, Annie!

454
00:22:28,592 --> 00:22:32,596
I'm not going to go on with a big speech, so I'll just say this.

455
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:36,142
I'm so happy to be a part of this celebration.

456
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:38,101
And you two deserve each other,

457
00:22:38,268 --> 00:22:40,144
as well as a lifetime of happiness.

458
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:41,562
- Thank you. - Cheers.

459
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:43,355
- Love you guys. - Cheers.

460
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,898
- Thanks, Annie. - Cheers.

461
00:22:47,651 --> 00:22:50,028
Thank you, Annie. That was so sweet. Thank you.

462
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,324
Lil, remember that trip we took to Miami with the boys?

463
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:57,119
And they were working the entire weekend,

464
00:22:57,202 --> 00:22:59,787
and we just sat and drank wine and ate peanut brittle.

465
00:22:59,871 --> 00:23:03,791
And I shared things with you that I've never shared with anyone.

466
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:09,088
And you made me realise how I can trust people again.

467
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,132
So let me just say,

468
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:14,468
Lillian, you are my best friend.

469
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:17,512
And I'm so proud of you.

470
00:23:18,972 --> 00:23:22,058
Sorry. And, Dougly...

471
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:24,227
I'm sorry, inside joke.

472
00:23:27,314 --> 00:23:29,106
You better not keep my Lil on a leash

473
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,066
because I still need my drunken Saturday nights

474
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,319
at Rockin' Sushi, okay?

475
00:23:34,862 --> 00:23:39,450
Everybody raise your glasses to the couple of the decade,

476
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:41,410
Doug and Lillian.

477
00:23:47,915 --> 00:23:50,209
Have a great night. Dessert wine is out.

478
00:23:50,292 --> 00:23:52,836
Dessert wine, yummy. Excuse me.

479
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,425
I just wanted to say really quick that

480
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:02,012
you are so special to me, because...

481
00:24:02,095 --> 00:24:05,056
Well, one of the reasons is because I've known you my whole entire life.

482
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:09,143
And you've really helped shape who I am.

483
00:24:09,435 --> 00:24:13,564
I just want to thank you for carefully selecting me

484
00:24:13,648 --> 00:24:15,399
as your maid of honour.

485
00:24:15,483 --> 00:24:18,361
I know you had some other choices,

486
00:24:19,195 --> 00:24:21,864
but you are like my sister, and I love you.

487
00:24:22,198 --> 00:24:24,700
Well, that concludes the speeches for the night.

488
00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:26,786
Thank you. One last thing.

489
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:30,164
It's rare to meet someone as an adult who you really connect with,

490
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:31,374
and that's you, Lil.

491
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:34,084
I went to Thailand recently with my husband, Perry,

492
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:37,544
and there is a beautiful saying that I learned there.

493
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:47,470
It means, "You are a part of me,

494
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:50,056
"a part that I could never live without,

495
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:53,977
"and I hope and I pray that I never have to."

496
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:02,275
And that's it for tonight. Thank you for coming.

497
00:25:02,358 --> 00:25:03,566
- Really quick... - Thank you all for coming.

498
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,277
I just wanted to say really quick...

499
00:25:05,402 --> 00:25:07,028
Dessert wine is out. Consuelo?

500
00:25:07,112 --> 00:25:08,488
- Really quick. - Speaking of Consuelo,

501
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:12,867
Lillian and I took Spanish together in school.

502
00:25:13,368 --> 00:25:16,788
And so, I would just like to say to you, and to everyone here...

503
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:40,687
Thank you.

504
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,648
Thank you. I feel so close to you and can trust you.

505
00:25:43,732 --> 00:25:46,026
You are my angel and soul mate.

506
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:51,280
And I feel I can communicate with you with simply a look.

507
00:25:54,241 --> 00:25:56,201
Thank you for coming.

508
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:58,704
Here, I'll take that. I'll take that.

509
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:01,831
Yep, I got it.

510
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:04,917

Man, engagement parties rule.

522
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,550
It made me feel awesome,

523
00:26:55,634 --> 00:26:58,345
like I can go out and catch another dude to marry.

524
00:27:01,306 --> 00:27:04,184
So, what's up with her, anyway? With Helen?

525
00:27:05,143 --> 00:27:06,519
- -What? - I'm just like...

526
00:27:06,852 --> 00:27:08,354
I don't know. She's in your wedding

527
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:10,606
and you've only known her eight months, though, right?

528
00:27:10,856 --> 00:27:12,608
Come on. Get it out, get it all out.

529
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:18,447
I'm just... Like, the whole gown, and the... thing.

530
00:27:18,531 --> 00:27:20,366
It's just weird, right? You know what?

531
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:22,785
She's actually really cool, Annie.

532
00:27:22,868 --> 00:27:25,204
She's really... She's a good one. I'm telling you.

533
00:27:25,538 --> 00:27:28,666
Well, I'm sure if you like her, I will like her.

534
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:31,210
You have to just get to know her.

535
00:27:31,293 --> 00:27:33,087
Yeah. Which I think you really should.

536
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,005
And... Will you just do me a favour?

537
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:36,589
Would you just hang out with her once,

538
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:38,216
just the two of you. All right?

539
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:39,883
As a favour to me.

540
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:41,135
Okay, I will.

541
00:27:41,802 --> 00:27:43,386
- I love you, Annie Lou. - I love you, too.

542
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:44,512
- Bye. - Bye.

543
00:27:44,804 --> 00:27:46,931
Oh. Hi, I'm Helen.

544
00:27:47,014 --> 00:27:49,809
You live in Milwaukee? I'm sorry.

545
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:52,436
Have you met Lillian? She's my best friend.

546
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,395
Yeah, I know. We've only known each other for five minutes.

547
00:28:00,317 --> 00:28:02,694
Cute.

548
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:06,196
No. No. Come on.

549
00:28:11,326 --> 00:28:15,079
See? Okay? I'm not drunk. I told you.

550
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:17,330
So, you are just a terrible sober driver?

551
00:28:17,873 --> 00:28:19,708
Very funny. Can I stop walking now?

552
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,710
You can stop walking when I tell you to stop walking.

553
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:23,211
Hey, look. If I was drunk,

554
00:28:23,295 --> 00:28:24,963
would I be able to do this?

555
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,942
Stop it. Stop it. Please, stop.

556
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:47,777
Please, stop. I believe you. You are not drunk.

557
00:28:48,236 --> 00:28:49,612
But I'm still gonna have to give you a ticket.

558
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:51,197
What? Why?

559
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,366
It's a funny thing about brake lights. You have to have them.

560
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,495
I knew it. God, those have been out for like a year.

561
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:59,288
I'm so stupid.

562
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:00,623
Look, please.

563
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,000
Please, I promise I will get them fixed.

564
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:07,796
This week, I promise. Please. Do you have to give me a ticket?

565
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:12,301
Yes. License and registration, please.

566
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:20,935
Thanks.

567
00:29:22,686 --> 00:29:25,063
Look at that, you live on Wynnewood Drive.

568
00:29:25,146 --> 00:29:26,522
- Yep. - We are neighbours.

569
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,107
I just live over on Ashley.

570
00:29:31,151 --> 00:29:32,443
I used to work on Ashley.

571
00:29:32,527 --> 00:29:34,695
You did? Where?

572
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:39,617
I had a bakery on the main part of the street there.

573
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:42,701
Cake Baby.

574
00:29:44,912 --> 00:29:46,539
- You are Cake Baby! - Yeah!

575
00:29:46,914 --> 00:29:49,625
Yeah, you had your sign. It was your face.

576
00:29:50,251 --> 00:29:51,543
- Yeah! - That was you?

577
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:52,669
That was me.

578
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:55,046
You made good cakes.

579
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:57,839
Thanks.

580
00:29:57,923 --> 00:30:01,051
You used to make these little pastry things,

581
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:04,887
and you'd put something in them, like a cream or a custard...

582
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,305
Cream puffs.

583
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:08,683
Cream puffs, that's what you call them. Delicious.

584
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:13,396
I used to get served by this tall, broad guy,

585
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,022
with, like, a wormy face.

586
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,817
Yeah, that was my boyfriend.

587
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,362
- Sorry. - No, no. It was...

588
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:24,740
He was my boyfriend, and then he left me

589
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:28,452
when the business went under. So, anyway...

590
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,079
You're kidding?

591
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:32,832
What a dick.

592
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm glad I never tipped him.

593
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:42,505
You know what? Let's forget about this.

594
00:30:43,423 --> 00:30:45,299
- Let's just forget this one. - Really?

595
00:30:45,382 --> 00:30:47,009
- Under one condition. - What? What?

596
00:30:47,092 --> 00:30:48,218
Get your taillights fixed...

597
00:30:48,302 --> 00:30:50,178
I promise. I promise I will. I promise. Thank you.

598
00:30:50,262 --> 00:30:51,388
...before you kill someone.

599
00:30:51,555 --> 00:30:52,639
I'm not going to kill anybody.

600
00:30:52,723 --> 00:30:54,223
All right. Here, there's your ID.

601
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:55,808
And I'm going to give you this.

602
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:58,476
It's a buddy of mine. He has a body shop in Milwaukee.

603
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,270
He'll fix those right up for you.

604
00:31:01,062 --> 00:31:02,730
Bill Cozbi?

605
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,272
Yeah, with a "Z".

606
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:06,524
- Different guy. - Yeah.

607
00:31:06,608 --> 00:31:08,985
And don't mention the whole "Bill Cosby" thing to him.

608
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:11,487
It drives him nuts. I mean it.

609
00:31:11,571 --> 00:31:13,906
Okay, I get it. Thanks.

610
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,826
You know what? If you mention my name, that I referred you,

611
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:18,703
he'll give you a particularly good deal.

612
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:20,955
My gosh. Thank you.

613
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,248
I really appreciate it. Thanks.

614
00:31:23,332 --> 00:31:25,959
Okay. Well, I appreciated your cakes.

615
00:31:26,043 --> 00:31:27,835
So, we are even.

616
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:30,046
That's me, there. Rhodes. Officer Rhodes.

617
00:31:30,129 --> 00:31:31,297
That's really nice of you.

618
00:31:35,468 --> 00:31:37,178
Thank you.

619
00:31:37,261 --> 00:31:38,763
We are not all bad.

620
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:40,097
What?

621
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:41,599
I was just saying, we are not all bad!

622
00:31:41,807 --> 00:31:43,225
Yeah.

623
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:46,020
Actually, the rest of them are, but not me.

624
00:31:46,103 --> 00:31:47,605
I'm the best of them.

625
00:31:47,855 --> 00:31:49,023
Okay. Thank you.

626
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:50,941
Anyway.

627
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:52,443
Thank you.

628
00:33:42,136 --> 00:33:43,512
I didn't know you played tennis.

629
00:33:43,596 --> 00:33:45,514
Yeah, I played a little in high school.

630
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,391
I'm so glad we were able to do this.

631
00:33:47,641 --> 00:33:49,852
I'm really glad we could do this, too. It's nice we get to hang out.

632
00:33:49,935 --> 00:33:51,145
- I know, right? - Yeah.

633
00:33:51,228 --> 00:33:53,147
It's too bad Lillian couldn't play with us today.

634
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,398
Poor thing, she is so busy.

635
00:33:54,523 --> 00:33:55,733
I know.

636
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,527
But she's not really that into sports.

637
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,154
Even when we were little, she didn't like anything

638
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:01,613
that was too competitive.

639
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,699
She certainly enjoys playing tennis now.

640
00:34:04,783 --> 00:34:06,534
It's funny how people change, isn't it?

641
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,913
Yeah. I mean, I don't know. Do people really change?

642
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:11,581
I think they do.

643
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:14,918
Yeah, but, I mean, they still stay who they are, pretty much.

644
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:17,587
I think we change all the time.

645
00:34:18,046 --> 00:34:22,133
I think we stay the same, but grow, I guess, a little bit.

646
00:34:22,425 --> 00:34:24,677
I think if you are growing, then you are changing.

647
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:28,097
But, I mean, we are changing from who we are, which we always stay as.

648
00:34:28,181 --> 00:34:29,724
Not really, I don't think so.

649
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:31,433
- I think so. - I don't.

650
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:34,186
Annie! These are my kids.

651
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:36,104
- Step-kids. - Step.

652
00:34:38,273 --> 00:34:39,316
They are so hilarious.

653
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:40,525
Funny.

654
00:34:40,608 --> 00:34:43,361
Excuse me, my husband's kids.

655
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:44,862
What are you guys up to?

656
00:34:44,987 --> 00:34:46,113
Going to the snack bar.

657
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:48,115
Awesome. You need a ride home later?

658
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:49,826
Fuck off, Helen.

659
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:53,453
Okay. Put a quarter in the swear-jar.

660
00:34:53,954 --> 00:34:56,248
Good to see you.

661
00:34:56,331 --> 00:34:57,374
They are so cute.

662
00:34:57,499 --> 00:34:58,583
Sweet kids.

663
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,824
Carol!

664
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:33,659
Get your shit together, Carol!

665
00:35:46,505 --> 00:35:47,589
Yes!

666
00:35:50,091 --> 00:35:53,553
I've seen better tennis playing in a tampon commercial.

667
00:35:59,517 --> 00:36:01,393
I've been thinking, and...

668
00:36:01,643 --> 00:36:04,271
Brynn needs to start paying rent. That's it.

669
00:36:04,354 --> 00:36:05,646
She's been here long enough.

670
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,691
The three of us live here, it's not fair for me to be paying half.

671
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:11,319
We split it three ways. What do you say?

672
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,905
Well, she can't work. She's on a tourist visa.

673
00:36:13,988 --> 00:36:16,616
Yeah. So, technically, I'm only allowed to tour.

674
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:18,034
Well, you know...

675
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,451
I have no way of earning money,

676
00:36:19,534 --> 00:36:22,162
unless I just go and prostitute down on the street.

677
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:23,997
I don't want you to do that, no.

678
00:36:24,122 --> 00:36:25,832
"Hello, fellas. Here I am."

679
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,334
Yeah, but we... "Put your American sausage

680
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:28,919
"in my English McMuffin."

681
00:36:29,002 --> 00:36:30,128
- No, we did that. - All right.

682
00:36:30,211 --> 00:36:32,547
Okay, I don't even know what you're talking about anymore.

683
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:34,507
- There's three people living here. - Yeah.

684
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:36,509
If she doesn't start paying...

685
00:36:36,593 --> 00:36:37,719
- I'm not. - ...she has to leave.

686
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:39,596
Is this about the diary again?

687
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,763
What diary?

688
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:43,724
Your diary proved very interesting to read.

689
00:36:43,974 --> 00:36:45,850
You read my... You read my journal?

690
00:36:45,934 --> 00:36:49,145
At first, I did not know that it was your diary.

691
00:36:49,228 --> 00:36:52,273
I thought it was a very sad, hand-written book.

692
00:36:53,565 --> 00:36:55,233
What? That does not make any...

693
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,027
But, because of the deep personal details

694
00:36:57,152 --> 00:36:59,613
- and the bits that mentioned Gil and Brynn... - No, no, no, no.

695
00:36:59,738 --> 00:37:01,406
- Don't read my journal! - And the crumbs.

696
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,741
- Then... - Don't go in my room!

697
00:37:02,824 --> 00:37:06,954
Well, hello! I think, before you make those sort of demands,

698
00:37:07,037 --> 00:37:08,372
you need to, maybe, think about

699
00:37:08,497 --> 00:37:09,831
putting a note on your door saying,

700
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:13,210
"Do not come into my room, read my diary and wear my clothes."

701
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,264
Wow, I've never been to this part of town before.

702
00:37:26,765 --> 00:37:28,767
Look, you can get your cheques cashed next door.

703
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,310
I know it looks a little scary on the outside,

704
00:37:30,394 --> 00:37:32,729
but the food is really good, authentic Brazilian.

705
00:37:33,021 --> 00:37:35,273
I'm telling you, this is where Brazilians come to eat.

706
00:37:35,357 --> 00:37:36,692
I got to say, Annie's really good at this.

707
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:38,443
She always drags me to the weirdest places

708
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,278
and the food is always incredible.

709
00:37:40,362 --> 00:37:43,240
And plus, you get a lot for your money, too. So that's good.

710
00:37:43,907 --> 00:37:46,702
- All right. Let's do it. - Let's do it.

711
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:48,745
Whoa! Somebody likes Brazilian food.

712
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:54,334
To my bridesmaids.

713
00:37:54,418 --> 00:37:56,210
- Cheers. - Cheers.

714
00:37:56,919 --> 00:37:58,379
Cheers to Lil!

715
00:37:58,462 --> 00:38:02,466
This is such a stone-cold pack of weirdos, and I'm so proud.

716
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,802
And I just want to toast all of you ladies.

717
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:06,469
I'm so happy to get to know you guys,

718
00:38:06,553 --> 00:38:09,472
and happy to say that I have four new friends.

719
00:38:09,806 --> 00:38:11,349
Absolutely. Cheers.

720
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,395
So, Annie, do you have a date for the wedding?

721
00:38:17,813 --> 00:38:21,275
I don't... I don't think I'm bringing anybody, I guess.

722
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,652
Please, can I set you up? Please?

723
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:26,196
Annie, you can't go to the wedding alone. Please?

724
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,449
If you go alone, people might think you're a prostitute.

725
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:29,700
Maybe.

726
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:32,119
I'm sorry.

727
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,876
I hope that you're all hungry for churrasco Brasil. What would you like?

728
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:40,501
Yeah, I'll have some of that, please.

729
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:41,669
I'll start with this.

730
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:44,255
I'd say yes. Hello, chicken.

731
00:38:44,338 --> 00:38:46,132
This is crazy good, ya'll.

732
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:48,091
Helen, aren't you eating any meat?

733
00:38:49,426 --> 00:38:52,595
It's not good to eat a big meal before a fitting.

734
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:54,013
I feel a bit bloated, so...

735
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:55,139
Not me.

736
00:38:55,222 --> 00:38:57,433
- No? - No. Physically, I don't bloat.

737
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,685
- Lucky. - That is lucky.

738
00:39:00,478 --> 00:39:01,770
It's a gift.

739
00:39:01,936 --> 00:39:05,607
I can't wait to be married for as long as you've been married.

740
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,858
And to have kids.

741
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,696
- And be a mom. - Becca?

742
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,865
Yeah?

743
00:39:13,948 --> 00:39:16,117
The other night, I'm slaving away,

744
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:18,328
making a beautiful dinner for my family.

745
00:39:18,745 --> 00:39:21,790
My youngest boy comes in and says he wants to order a pizza.

746
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,708
I said, "No, we're not ordering pizza tonight."

747
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:26,294
He goes, "Mom, why don't you go and fuck yourself?"

748
00:39:26,795 --> 00:39:28,129
He's nine.

749
00:39:29,964 --> 00:39:31,299
Okay, now that Lillian's in the bathroom,

750
00:39:31,382 --> 00:39:33,759
I just wanted to talk to you guys about the shower really quick.

751
00:39:33,842 --> 00:39:37,262
I was thinking it could be French-themed,

752
00:39:37,346 --> 00:39:39,890
since she's always wanted to go to Paris her whole life.

753
00:39:40,891 --> 00:39:43,894
So I figured we could bring Paris here

754
00:39:44,061 --> 00:39:47,064
and have champagne and little cookies.

755
00:39:47,147 --> 00:39:48,649
They'd say "Lillian and Dougie" on them.

756
00:39:48,774 --> 00:39:50,317
We can dip them in chocolate fondue,

757
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,070
and get cheese from the nice part of the store.

758
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:54,947
- I love that. - Good idea, Annie.

759
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,032
We can have French invitations, the whole thing.

760
00:39:57,116 --> 00:39:58,242
Don't you think that'd be nice?

761
00:39:58,325 --> 00:40:00,327
- That's adorable! - That's really cute.

762
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,078
Good. Great.

763
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:03,829
I don't know. It's really cute.

764
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:05,914
But I feel like, personally, the Paris theme's

765
00:40:06,081 --> 00:40:08,083
a bit, "Been there, done that".

766
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,542
I just feel like we can top it.

767
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:11,001
We should throw some ideas around.

768
00:40:11,085 --> 00:40:13,294
See if anyone else has a theme they had in mind

769
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:14,921
or something they'd been thinking of.

770
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,256
What about a Pixar-themed shower?

771
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,259
And we all come dressed as our favourite Pixar character.

772
00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:24,721
That, and I'll just snowball on top of that, also Fight Club.

773
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:27,431
Female fight club.

774
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:30,518
We grease up, we pull in.

775
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:34,272
Lillian doesn't know, so it's, "Surprise! We're going to fight!"

776
00:40:34,438 --> 00:40:36,022
We beat the shit out of her.

777
00:40:36,815 --> 00:40:38,399
She's not going to forget that.

778
00:40:38,649 --> 00:40:40,525
We just fucking attack.

779
00:40:40,984 --> 00:40:42,776
- Can I be honest? - No.

780
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,029
I'm at home with three boys all day, every day.

781
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,447
What about the bachelorette party?

782
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:48,949
That's what's more important.

783
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:51,535
I've got a new tube top, I want to cut the tags off.

784
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:53,578
I'd like to take advantage of this opportunity.

785
00:40:54,078 --> 00:40:55,872
- Where are we going? - I'm going to second her.

786
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:57,582
- We'd better blow this shit out. - Yeah.

787
00:40:57,665 --> 00:41:00,334
That poor girl, Lillian, who we're all here for,

788
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:02,795
is in the bathroom probably bawling her fucking eyes out.

789
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:04,963
Because she's realising, "Holy shit!

790
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,798
"I've got to spend the rest of my life with Doug."

791
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:10,051
He's my brother. I love him. But he is a fucking asshole.

792
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,845
I think we can all agree on that, right?

793
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,264
We can... We'll figure it out.

794
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,808
I mean, I can think of stuff, and it will be great.

795
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,144
We just have to make sure it's really, really special.

796
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:27,734
Belle en Blanc? This is the place. Great job, Annie.

797
00:41:27,817 --> 00:41:29,485
- Thanks. - Annie.

798
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:33,947
Belle en Blanc. Reservation name?

799
00:41:34,031 --> 00:41:37,910
I don't have one. We're just here to shop, just to try on some dresses.

800
00:41:37,993 --> 00:41:39,661
Okay. Well, the next available appointment

801
00:41:39,786 --> 00:41:41,413
for bridesmaids' fittings is in seven weeks.

802
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:43,332
Absolutely no walk-ins.

803
00:41:43,457 --> 00:41:45,249
Whitney? It's Helen.

804
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:47,000
- Helen Harris? - Yeah!

805
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:48,126
- Hi! - Hi.

806
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,086
Oh, my God. Hi. Listen, I'll buzz you right in.

807
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,005
- Great, thanks. - Okay.

808
00:41:53,381 --> 00:41:55,842
Hello. Welcome, come in.

809
00:41:55,926 --> 00:41:57,052
You look wonderful. Great to see you.

810
00:41:57,135 --> 00:41:59,095
Welcome to Belle en Blanc, ladies.

811
00:41:59,179 --> 00:42:00,931
- Welcome to heaven. - Thank you.

812
00:42:01,014 --> 00:42:02,349
Oh, man!

813
00:42:03,183 --> 00:42:06,352
This is some classy shit here.

814
00:42:06,435 --> 00:42:08,103
Jesus, Megan!

815
00:42:08,187 --> 00:42:09,687
I'm sorry, I want to apologise.

816
00:42:09,771 --> 00:42:13,066
I'm not even confident on which end that came out of.

817
00:42:13,149 --> 00:42:15,193
Whitney, back to you. I'm sorry.

818
00:42:15,276 --> 00:42:18,363
Anyway, take a look around. Get to know the dresses.

819
00:42:18,696 --> 00:42:20,156
If you need anything, I'll be in my office.

820
00:42:20,657 --> 00:42:21,741
Have fun.

821
00:42:21,824 --> 00:42:24,661
Oh, my God.

822
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,537
It's a Fritz Bernaise.

823
00:42:26,663 --> 00:42:27,789
- Ladies, I... - Oh, my God!

824
00:42:27,872 --> 00:42:30,291
I just don't think we can do any better. This is...

825
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:32,293
- This is beautiful. - That is gorgeous.

826
00:42:32,377 --> 00:42:34,128
It's unique, it's special, it's couture.

827
00:42:34,212 --> 00:42:35,922
This is made in France.

828
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:37,799
Helen, this is $800.

829
00:42:37,882 --> 00:42:39,717
Are you kidding? It's on sale.

830
00:42:39,842 --> 00:42:41,886
- Are you serious? - Oh, my gosh. What a perfect combination.

831
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,388
You guys, it was meant to be.

832
00:42:43,471 --> 00:42:44,889
That's nice.

833
00:42:45,515 --> 00:42:49,102
There's other dresses we should be looking at.

834
00:42:49,185 --> 00:42:50,895
Nope, not that one.

835
00:42:52,563 --> 00:42:54,523
Lillian, Lillian, look at this one.

836
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:56,149
- Isn't this pretty? - Yeah.

837
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:58,442
It's really pretty and sweet, and...

838
00:42:58,526 --> 00:43:02,697
We don't want to upstage Lillian with a big fancy dress.

839
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,364
Maybe we should just get something kind of simple.

840
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,035
Please do not worry about upstaging me.

841
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,122
Because guess who Helen is friends with

842
00:43:12,247 --> 00:43:15,292
and who's designing my wedding dress.

843
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:18,168
Lady St Petsois JuJu.

844
00:43:19,128 --> 00:43:21,046
I just sent my measurements to France, y'all.

845
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:23,090
No, you didn't.

846
00:43:23,173 --> 00:43:24,675
Where were you when I was getting married?

847
00:43:24,758 --> 00:43:27,845
Ladies, let's not decide on this bridesmaids' dress straight away.

848
00:43:27,928 --> 00:43:29,263
Let's let our bodies decide.

849
00:43:29,596 --> 00:43:31,932
Try some things on and have some fun, okay?

850
00:43:32,308 --> 00:43:34,226
Yeah, let's have some fun, girls.

851
00:43:34,351 --> 00:43:36,270
Ladies, start your "engines".

852
00:43:37,021 --> 00:43:38,521
- Oh, yeah. - Lil, Lil.

853
00:43:38,604 --> 00:43:41,441
Amazing. This is so cool.

854
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,870
Ladies. Ladies, if I may interject.

855
00:43:53,953 --> 00:43:56,372
I just want to say you all look stunning.

856
00:43:56,539 --> 00:43:58,207
That's a given. Head to toe.

857
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:01,294
But, sadly, we need to agree on one.

858
00:44:01,377 --> 00:44:03,754
Well, I mean, ladies, you all look beautiful.

859
00:44:03,837 --> 00:44:07,466
But I just think, personally, the Fritz Bernaise is just...

860
00:44:07,549 --> 00:44:08,884
- I mean... - It's a Bernaise.

861
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:11,386
This is one o fa kind. I just...

862
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,471
I don't think there is a question.

863
00:44:12,596 --> 00:44:13,597
No. No question.

864
00:44:14,473 --> 00:44:15,973
There might be a question.

865
00:44:16,432 --> 00:44:17,892
I might... I might have a question.

866
00:44:17,975 --> 00:44:19,769
I think this dress would look great on everybody.

867
00:44:19,852 --> 00:44:21,937
It's a great colour. It's a great length.

868
00:44:22,021 --> 00:44:24,482
It's fun. You can twirl.

869
00:44:24,565 --> 00:44:26,609
You can move in it.

870
00:44:26,692 --> 00:44:28,402
You can spread your legs apart.

871
00:44:28,486 --> 00:44:30,821
And it's a great price.

872
00:44:31,655 --> 00:44:33,657
This is designer as well.

873
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:35,283
Is anyone else hot?

874
00:44:35,408 --> 00:44:36,659
It is like an oven in here.

875
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,913
Okay, well, maybe this might help you decide.

876
00:44:39,996 --> 00:44:41,748
While you gals were in the changing room,

877
00:44:41,831 --> 00:44:46,211
I happened to rustle up a two-year-old Lady JuJu dress in storage.

878
00:44:46,294 --> 00:44:48,004
I had Lillian put it on so you could see

879
00:44:48,129 --> 00:44:49,797
what you'll be standing next to.

880
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,340
Lillian, honey.

881
00:44:51,423 --> 00:44:53,091
My God.

882
00:44:55,343 --> 00:44:56,677
Beautiful length.

883
00:44:56,844 --> 00:44:58,220
Breathtaking.

884
00:44:58,303 --> 00:45:02,015
Holy shit! You look amazing.

885
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,600
- That's a dress. - That dress is so pretty

886
00:45:03,683 --> 00:45:04,684
it makes my stomach hurt.

887
00:45:06,812 --> 00:45:08,522
Lillian,

888
00:45:08,688 --> 00:45:11,273
I don't know what to say. You look...

889
00:45:13,401 --> 00:45:14,443
Megan, are you okay?

890
00:45:18,656 --> 00:45:19,698
I think...

891
00:45:21,492 --> 00:45:22,992
My dress was probably just tight.

892
00:45:23,076 --> 00:45:24,411
Oh, my God.

893
00:45:24,494 --> 00:45:26,788
You got food poisoning from that restaurant, didn't you?

894
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,375
No, I had the same thing that she had and I feel fine.

895
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:32,043
- Oh, my... Okay. - Oh, no.

896
00:45:32,252 --> 00:45:33,752
Why is this happening? Nothing is happening.

897
00:45:35,003 --> 00:45:36,213
Oh, my God.

898
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:38,631
I don't really care which dress we get.

899
00:45:38,714 --> 00:45:40,800
It doesn't matter to me. I just need to get off this white carpet.

900
00:45:40,883 --> 00:45:42,301
- Oh, God. - Okay. No, not the bathroom.

901
00:45:42,385 --> 00:45:45,138
Everybody go outside. I'm serious!

902
00:45:45,221 --> 00:45:47,140
There is a bathroom across the street.

903
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:51,560
I think everybody has the flu.

904
00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:55,313
Shit!

905
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,859
I need the toilet! I need the toilet!

906
00:46:00,694 --> 00:46:02,612
I need the toilet!

907
00:46:02,696 --> 00:46:04,196
No!

908
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:07,992
No. No, Megan. No! No!

909
00:46:08,075 --> 00:46:09,743
- Look away! - Megan, no!

910
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:10,953
Look away!

911
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:18,586
You don't look very well, Annie.

912
00:46:19,753 --> 00:46:20,796
I feel fine.

913
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:25,009
Are you sure? It wasn't that grey kind of lamb?

914
00:46:25,092 --> 00:46:26,844
You ate a lot of that weird chicken.

915
00:46:27,261 --> 00:46:28,804
Was it that?

916
00:46:28,929 --> 00:46:31,182
No. I'm...

917
00:46:31,265 --> 00:46:32,433
I... I feel fine.

918
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:36,394
I think you'd just feel better if you threw up.

919
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,440
I don't have... I don't have to throw up.

920
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:44,152
I am so sorry.

921
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:45,236
Get away from me!

922
00:46:46,154 --> 00:46:47,197
You're not sick?

923
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,281
- No. - No?

924
00:46:48,364 --> 00:46:51,451
In fact, Helen, I'm hungry.

925
00:46:51,534 --> 00:46:53,703
And I wish I had a snack.

926
00:46:53,912 --> 00:46:54,954
You're hungry?

927
00:46:55,955 --> 00:46:57,415
I'm starving.

928
00:46:58,875 --> 00:46:59,959
What did we eat?

929
00:47:01,294 --> 00:47:03,213
- The sink is a goner. - What are you doing?

930
00:47:03,296 --> 00:47:04,964
It's coming out of me like lava!

931
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,216
Oh, my God.

932
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:08,717
Don't you fucking look at me!

933
00:47:12,637 --> 00:47:13,638
Jordan almonds.

934
00:47:14,055 --> 00:47:15,056
These are great.

935
00:47:15,806 --> 00:47:17,141
Thank you.

936
00:47:27,652 --> 00:47:28,860
Better?

937
00:47:30,028 --> 00:47:31,320
I was... I was just hungry.

938
00:47:31,445 --> 00:47:32,696
Yeah.

939
00:47:33,988 --> 00:47:36,365
Annie, everybody is really sick from that restaurant.

940
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:39,700
- But it wasn't the restaurant. - No, no, no, no.

941
00:47:39,784 --> 00:47:41,202
- Lillian, where are you going? - No.

942
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:42,328
I need a bathroom.

943
00:47:43,329 --> 00:47:44,372
Lil!

944
00:47:44,455 --> 00:47:45,414
No. No.

945
00:47:45,498 --> 00:47:46,582
Lil, where are you going?

946
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:49,334
Be careful. What are you doing?

947
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:52,003
It's happening. It's happening.

948
00:47:52,128 --> 00:47:53,838
It's happening. It's happening.

949
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:58,717
- It happened. - What are you doing?

950
00:47:58,801 --> 00:48:00,177
It happened.

951
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,889
No. Don't you dare ruin that dress!

952
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,392
You're really doing it, aren't you?

953
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,101
You're really shitting in the street.

954
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:14,023
...

955
00:48:18,444 --> 00:48:20,196
We'll just take five of the Fritz Bernaises.

956
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,906
Thank you, Whitney. They really do look better.

957
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:23,658
- Right. - Thank you.

958
00:48:27,787 --> 00:48:29,122
You okay?

959
00:48:31,082 --> 00:48:34,127
I crapped my wedding dress. I crapped...

960
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:37,922
I... I crapped my wedding dress.

961
00:48:39,966 --> 00:48:42,051
Lunch was fun, though, right?

962
00:48:43,177 --> 00:48:44,804
It was a good time, all the girls together.

963
00:48:44,887 --> 00:48:46,806
Is this a sign, Annie?

964
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,224
No. I'm just going to pull over

965
00:48:48,308 --> 00:48:50,100
really quick, though, because...

966
00:48:50,183 --> 00:48:51,184
What?

967
00:48:51,268 --> 00:48:52,394
...my tire just feels a little...

968
00:48:52,477 --> 00:48:53,561
Where are you going?

969
00:48:53,644 --> 00:48:54,728
My tire just feels a little low.

970
00:48:54,811 --> 00:48:56,730
I just want to check my tire real quick.

971
00:49:23,715 --> 00:49:26,508
Could I borrow your razor, please?

972
00:49:30,471 --> 00:49:31,971
Thank you.

973
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,388
- Have a good date. - Thank you.

974
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:36,808
Is the guy that you're going out with also over 40?

975
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:38,852
I'm not over 40. Forget it.

976
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:41,604
Lift up your arm. Point it up.

977
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,149
Sorry.

978
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:57,244
- Hi. - Annie.

979
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,038
- Pete? - Yeah.

980
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,164
Come on in.

981
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,248
All right. Thank you.

982
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:06,628
This is my son, Tyler.

983
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,796
- Hi, Tyler. - Hi.

984
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:11,632
- These things are always so awkward. - Yeah.

985
00:50:11,715 --> 00:50:13,591
- I'm not really a setup guy. - Me, either.

986
00:50:13,674 --> 00:50:15,218
But Becca spoke so highly of you.

987
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:18,054
She had a lot of really nice things to say about you, too.

988
00:50:18,137 --> 00:50:19,221
That's nice to hear.

989
00:50:19,388 --> 00:50:22,015
I'm going to go upstairs, throw on a couple of finishing touches.

990
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:25,935
The babysitter's not here yet, so just hang out with Tyler

991
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,268
- and I'll be right back down. - Okay.

992
00:50:27,352 --> 00:50:28,353
Okay.

993
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:41,281
So, how old are you?

994
00:50:45,452 --> 00:50:47,162
Do you watch movies?

995
00:50:53,252 --> 00:50:55,587
Are you afraid of dying?

996
00:50:56,755 --> 00:50:59,007
Are you afraid of dying?

997
00:51:02,051 --> 00:51:03,927
I don't know.

998
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:08,765
I mean, I guess everybody is. I don't know. Why?

999
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,893
Because my mom is going to kill you.

1000
00:51:22,487 --> 00:51:24,614
You're making me uncomfortable.

1001
00:51:29,577 --> 00:51:32,370
Your hair looks burned.

1002
00:51:34,581 --> 00:51:35,582
Okay.

1003
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:40,420
Are you going to make a baby with my father?

1004
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,382
I don't... I don't know.

1005
00:51:44,883 --> 00:51:47,676
My grandma died where you're sitting.

1006
00:51:48,968 --> 00:51:50,428
She died right here?

1007
00:51:51,762 --> 00:51:54,098
Right where your underpants are.

1008
00:52:01,772 --> 00:52:03,440
You wanna watch me dance?

1009
00:52:04,983 --> 00:52:05,984
Sure.

1010
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:28,173
I can't do this.

1011
00:52:28,632 --> 00:52:31,676
Listen to me. I miss you so much.

1012
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:33,929
I'll come over right now.

1013
00:52:34,012 --> 00:52:36,139
Okay, I'm not over you yet, that's why.

1014
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,849
She's not even pretty.

1015
00:52:38,725 --> 00:52:41,228
I'm not doing it. I can't. No.

1016
00:52:49,151 --> 00:52:51,445
What are you doing? Did you eat one of those?

1017
00:52:51,529 --> 00:52:53,614
Did you eat one of those?

1018
00:52:53,697 --> 00:52:55,407
I ate Saturday.

1019
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,868
Okay. Oh, boy. You know what?

1020
00:52:57,952 --> 00:53:00,579
Something's going to happen to you. I don't know what it is,

1021
00:53:00,663 --> 00:53:03,541
but something's going to happen to your body.

1022
00:53:08,087 --> 00:53:09,922
- That was fun. - Oh, my gosh.

1023
00:53:11,924 --> 00:53:15,344
You know what I was thinking?

1024
00:53:15,427 --> 00:53:18,180
You should come with me to Lillian's wedding, maybe.

1025
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:20,599
Not like that. Not like anything serious.

1026
00:53:20,683 --> 00:53:22,518
But just like a fun time, you know?

1027
00:53:22,601 --> 00:53:27,189
We can get dressed up, and we can go dancing and have a drink.

1028
00:53:27,273 --> 00:53:28,565
It'll be fun, right?

1029
00:53:29,107 --> 00:53:31,943
No. I mean, I don't want to make you have to explain

1030
00:53:32,026 --> 00:53:34,821
to all those people what our relationship is.

1031
00:53:35,238 --> 00:53:38,741
That would suck for you. Right?

1032
00:53:39,701 --> 00:53:41,035
Yeah. I guess so.

1033
00:53:41,411 --> 00:53:43,037
- I'm just thinking of you. - Yeah.

1034
00:53:43,121 --> 00:53:45,706
No, it's okay.

1035
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:49,084
I have someone else I can ask, anyway. So...

1036
00:53:50,586 --> 00:53:52,129
- Really? - Yeah.

1037
00:53:52,212 --> 00:53:53,422
Who?

1038
00:53:53,547 --> 00:53:54,798
This guy, George.

1039
00:53:56,382 --> 00:53:58,050
George Glass.

1040
00:54:01,429 --> 00:54:02,513
Okay.

1041
00:54:04,097 --> 00:54:06,600
Who is this George?

1042
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:11,229
He is a very hot, nice guy

1043
00:54:11,313 --> 00:54:14,816
who likes me a lot, and would probably love to be my date.

1044
00:54:14,899 --> 00:54:15,900
Really?

1045
00:54:21,823 --> 00:54:23,908
Well, let me ask you this.

1046
00:54:23,992 --> 00:54:27,871
Can this George Glass

1047
00:54:29,455 --> 00:54:31,832
do this to you?

1048
00:54:42,676 --> 00:54:44,011
Probably.

1049
00:54:44,803 --> 00:54:47,598
You know what? It's getting really late.

1050
00:54:47,681 --> 00:54:51,143
You should probably go. I'm going to miss you so much.

1051
00:55:15,376 --> 00:55:16,377
Annie Walker.

1052
00:55:16,543 --> 00:55:17,544
Hi.

1053
00:55:17,628 --> 00:55:18,879
- Hey. - Hey.

1054
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:21,382
What brings you in here so early?

1055
00:55:21,465 --> 00:55:24,551
I've just had a bad night. Boy stuff.

1056
00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:27,303
Do you want me to arrest anybody?

1057
00:55:27,387 --> 00:55:28,388
I could do that.

1058
00:55:28,513 --> 00:55:29,514
Actually... No.

1059
00:55:29,847 --> 00:55:32,975
Do you want to talk to a cop about it? We are just like priests.

1060
00:55:34,643 --> 00:55:36,770
Except we can tell everybody about it afterwards.

1061
00:55:36,853 --> 00:55:37,896
I won't, though.

1062
00:55:38,397 --> 00:55:39,605
Doesn't sound very inviting.

1063
00:55:41,232 --> 00:55:42,400
You want a carrot?

1064
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,652
- Right now? - Yeah.

1065
00:55:46,236 --> 00:55:48,405
I'll share. I've got plenty.

1066
00:55:49,406 --> 00:55:50,532
Sure, I'll have a carrot.

1067
00:55:50,657 --> 00:55:51,741
Yeah?

1068
00:55:51,825 --> 00:55:53,076
Okay.

1069
00:55:53,743 --> 00:55:55,703
Yeah, that sounds rough.

1070
00:55:57,037 --> 00:55:58,121
It's going to get better, right?

1071
00:55:58,204 --> 00:55:59,205
I wouldn't have thought so.

1072
00:55:59,288 --> 00:56:02,333
You know, my sister was a maid of honour at our cousin's wedding,

1073
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:06,002
and she found it so stressful, her hair started falling out.

1074
00:56:06,253 --> 00:56:08,004
- That's terrible. - Yeah.

1075
00:56:08,088 --> 00:56:10,215
It grew back, but it was...

1076
00:56:10,716 --> 00:56:12,216
It was pretty gross.

1077
00:56:12,758 --> 00:56:14,093
Planning a wedding should be fun.

1078
00:56:14,176 --> 00:56:16,846
You know what? If I ever had a wedding,

1079
00:56:16,971 --> 00:56:19,640
I'd want everybody to be stress-free.

1080
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:21,434
I'd like it to be like a carnival.

1081
00:56:21,892 --> 00:56:25,980
Like, people win prizes for guessing the bride's weight.

1082
00:56:26,063 --> 00:56:27,398
Dunk tanks.

1083
00:56:27,481 --> 00:56:28,607
- Yeah. - You know?

1084
00:56:29,275 --> 00:56:30,359
You could have elephants,

1085
00:56:30,443 --> 00:56:32,778
and the bride and groom can walk on a little tightrope.

1086
00:56:32,862 --> 00:56:35,698
Okay, what you are talking about there, that's a circus wedding.

1087
00:56:35,781 --> 00:56:37,408
- It's a totally different... - Right.

1088
00:56:37,491 --> 00:56:38,909
- You missed it. - Yeah.

1089
00:56:39,785 --> 00:56:42,872
Hey, you know, instead of stressing out about this wedding,

1090
00:56:42,955 --> 00:56:45,540
you know what you should be doing?

1091
00:56:45,623 --> 00:56:47,583
Setting up a new bakery!

1092
00:56:50,669 --> 00:56:52,045
No, I'm kind of done with that.

1093
00:56:52,671 --> 00:56:53,714
What?

1094
00:56:54,381 --> 00:56:56,257
I don't do it anymore.

1095
00:56:56,591 --> 00:56:57,925
All right.

1096
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,514
- You got the ugly carrot. - What?

1097
00:57:04,223 --> 00:57:06,225
There is one in every bag. You have to eat it. It's good luck.

1098
00:57:06,309 --> 00:57:07,435
I'm not eating this.

1099
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,644
Yeah! I'll eat it.

1100
00:57:08,811 --> 00:57:11,147
It's the lucky carrot? No, don't eat it! Don't eat it. Don't eat it!

1101
00:57:12,148 --> 00:57:16,319
- Well, don't litter! I'll fine you. - I'm sorry.

1102
00:57:16,819 --> 00:57:18,362
You know what? Actually, I'm going to pick it up.

1103
00:57:18,446 --> 00:57:19,738
- It really bothers me. - Sorry.

1104
00:57:19,821 --> 00:57:23,992
I'm sorry. It's just that I'm anal about that kind of thing.

1105
00:57:27,537 --> 00:57:32,500
I didn't know that you could be a cop here if you weren't a citizen.

1106
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:34,501
- You can't. - No?

1107
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:36,419
No. No, you can't.

1108
00:57:36,503 --> 00:57:38,421
But they made a special dispensation

1109
00:57:38,546 --> 00:57:40,465
because I'm so tough and strong.

1110
00:57:40,548 --> 00:57:42,008
- Right. - And handsome.

1111
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:43,383
Okay.

1112
00:57:43,467 --> 00:57:45,010
You're pretty... You're pretty tough.

1113
00:57:46,053 --> 00:57:48,096
- I am tough. - You're tough. You're a tough cop.

1114
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,348
Look. You're saying it, but you're laughing.

1115
00:57:49,473 --> 00:57:50,599
No, you're... You're...

1116
00:57:50,682 --> 00:57:51,892
You didn't let me flex that time.

1117
00:57:52,017 --> 00:57:53,227
That was unfair. I'm really tough.

1118
00:57:53,435 --> 00:57:55,270
- So am I. - No.

1119
00:57:55,354 --> 00:57:57,606
Yeah. I could be a cop.

1120
00:57:57,856 --> 00:58:00,776
- You think you could be a cop? - Yeah.

1121
00:58:00,859 --> 00:58:01,860
- Okay. - Yeah.

1122
00:58:01,944 --> 00:58:03,779
Let's see. You know what?

1123
00:58:03,862 --> 00:58:06,949
The sun is nearly up. Let's go and see if you've got what it takes.

1124
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:09,910
That's right. Now, plant your feet.

1125
00:58:10,035 --> 00:58:11,036
Okay.

1126
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:12,162
Good.

1127
00:58:12,788 --> 00:58:14,288
And take aim.

1128
00:58:15,872 --> 00:58:19,209
Now, put your left hand behind your head.

1129
00:58:20,252 --> 00:58:22,087
Yeah. And just drop your left hip.

1130
00:58:25,757 --> 00:58:27,759
- I'm kidding. Put your arms out straight. - Okay.

1131
00:58:28,218 --> 00:58:30,094
You want to hit the middle of the license plate.

1132
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:31,637
That's where you get the most accurate reading.

1133
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,806
- Okay. - Okay, here we go. You ready?

1134
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:34,932
Okay.

1135
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,436
Fifty-eight. What's the speed limit?

1136
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,728
Fifty-five.

1137
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:43,481
Okay, they were all right. We'll let them go.

1138
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:46,192
You were born to do this. Look at you.

1139
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:48,486
- Okay. - All right, here we go.

1140
00:58:50,446 --> 00:58:52,073
Sixty-three.

1141
00:58:52,448 --> 00:58:53,908
You are missing some good ones here.

1142
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:57,287
People are on their way to work. Why ruin their day?

1143
00:58:57,954 --> 00:58:59,454
Okay, watch this. 48.

1144
00:59:01,248 --> 00:59:02,249
Forty-eight. How did you do that?

1145
00:59:02,332 --> 00:59:03,500
- It wasn't! - Yes, it was.

1146
00:59:03,584 --> 00:59:05,002
- That's never happened. - Are you serious?

1147
00:59:05,085 --> 00:59:06,503
- It was 48? - Yes, 48!

1148
00:59:06,587 --> 00:59:08,255
- Yeah. - I'm so impressed.

1149
00:59:08,338 --> 00:59:09,506
I'm pretty impressive.

1150
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:11,550
I'm very impressed by you.

1151
00:59:12,426 --> 00:59:13,427
Whoa!

1152
00:59:13,677 --> 00:59:14,678
Whoa!

1153
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:16,346
- Whoa! - Damn!

1154
00:59:17,139 --> 00:59:18,307
- That was 91. - 91?

1155
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:19,391
Yes. Can we go?

1156
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:20,475
We can go.

1157
00:59:21,685 --> 00:59:22,728
Come on, hot dogger.

1158
00:59:25,105 --> 00:59:26,273
Let's get that fucker.

1159
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,608
Oh, my God!

1160
00:59:28,692 --> 00:59:30,068
Oh, my God!

1161
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:42,581
...family lake house. Perfect.

1162
00:59:50,756 --> 00:59:54,426
- Hello? - I just got your e-mail. Lake house?

1163
00:59:55,052 --> 00:59:56,887
Yeah.

1164
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:59,306
Yeah, it's Lillian's parents' house.

1165
00:59:59,389 --> 01:00:01,934
We used to go there all the time in the summers and everything.

1166
01:00:02,059 --> 01:00:04,561
- It's one of... - A bachelorette in a cabin?

1167
01:00:04,895 --> 01:00:07,064
Wait. Can you... Hold that thought. Hold on.

1168
01:00:07,147 --> 01:00:08,190
Hello?

1169
01:00:08,607 --> 01:00:10,609
Fucking Helen. Hello?

1170
01:00:10,943 --> 01:00:12,569
Annie, it's Rita.

1171
01:00:12,778 --> 01:00:13,904
Hi.

1172
01:00:13,987 --> 01:00:17,240
Listen, I need a trip that I can fantasise forever

1173
01:00:17,324 --> 01:00:19,284
so that I am able to have sex with my husband.

1174
01:00:19,409 --> 01:00:21,495
That's why I'm thinking Vegas.

1175
01:00:22,329 --> 01:00:23,372
Vegas?

1176
01:00:23,455 --> 01:00:24,456
Hang on. Hey!

1177
01:00:24,665 --> 01:00:27,125
Shut your filthy fucking mouths! I'm sorry.

1178
01:00:27,209 --> 01:00:28,627
I'm surrounded by savages.

1179
01:00:29,795 --> 01:00:31,671
You know what? I should probably run. My other line is ringing.

1180
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:34,006
You know, I can get cocaine from my hairdresser.

1181
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:36,592
Okay, bye. Hello?

1182
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:37,969
- Annie. - Yeah?

1183
01:00:38,094 --> 01:00:41,180
I'm so excited. Helen just called. She said we can go to Vegas.

1184
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:44,266
You know... Yeah, but we have to... We have to fly there, and...

1185
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:47,519
Okay, Annie, I know you are afraid of flying,

1186
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:50,605
but I want to see Criss Angel, but I'm scared.

1187
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,732
Which I sort of love.

1188
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,442
Can you just hold on for one second?

1189
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,735
- Oh, sure, sure, sure. I... - Thanks. Hold on. God damn it.

1190
01:00:56,902 --> 01:00:58,862
- Hello? - Hey, Annie, it's Megan.

1191
01:00:58,946 --> 01:00:59,947
Hey.

1192
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:02,407
I just had some thoughts about the bachelorette party.

1193
01:01:02,532 --> 01:01:04,116
Okay, here we go.

1194
01:01:04,366 --> 01:01:05,742
Easy-peasy. Vegas it is.

1195
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:07,953
Helen called you, didn't she?

1196
01:01:08,078 --> 01:01:09,705
Yeah, she got the jump on you.

1197
01:01:11,123 --> 01:01:13,166
I want balls in my face.

1198
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:14,584
Honestly, I think it's Vegas.

1199
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,628
- I love puppets. - Balls.

1200
01:01:16,962 --> 01:01:18,046
I guess we are undecided.

1201
01:01:48,035 --> 01:01:50,078
I feel so bad Annie's stuck back in coach.

1202
01:01:50,245 --> 01:01:51,580
I know, I offered to pay for her

1203
01:01:51,747 --> 01:01:53,123
so she could sit in first class,

1204
01:01:53,206 --> 01:01:55,375
but she said no.

1205
01:01:55,459 --> 01:01:56,585
She's too proud.

1206
01:01:56,668 --> 01:01:58,252
It was nice of you to offer.

1207
01:02:01,047 --> 01:02:02,131
No carry-on, huh?

1208
01:02:02,965 --> 01:02:04,717
- No. - Yeah, I noticed.

1209
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,177
I noticed you didn't put anything in the overhead bin either.

1210
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,261
And I get it.

1211
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:11,931
I get it. I want you to know, protect and serve

1212
01:02:12,098 --> 01:02:13,558
Air Marshal-style.

1213
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:15,226
What?

1214
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:17,312
I don't want to infringe on your privacy, man.

1215
01:02:17,395 --> 01:02:19,772
I just... I really appreciate what you do for this country.

1216
01:02:20,314 --> 01:02:22,190
And I respect the hell out of you.

1217
01:02:24,275 --> 01:02:25,359
That's great.

1218
01:02:25,985 --> 01:02:28,154
I'm not an Air Marshal. I'm going to take a nap.

1219
01:02:28,237 --> 01:02:29,321
- Awesome. - Cool.

1220
01:02:29,571 --> 01:02:31,823
I'll take the first watch.

1221
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:35,619
I'm not an Air Marshal. You don't need to take a watch.

1222
01:02:35,702 --> 01:02:36,912
Okay.

1223
01:02:37,871 --> 01:02:39,998
I've got the first watch.

1224
01:02:40,248 --> 01:02:41,540
Please check your seatbelts

1225
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:43,793
and that your seat backs are in an upright position before takeoff.

1226
01:02:43,876 --> 01:02:44,919
Gosh.

1227
01:02:46,378 --> 01:02:48,422
I am really hoping this flight is quick,

1228
01:02:48,547 --> 01:02:50,549
and we get there on the ground safely.

1229
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:51,717
I'm not a good flyer, I'm sorry.

1230
01:02:52,093 --> 01:02:54,970
I had a dream last night that we went down.

1231
01:02:55,054 --> 01:02:57,847
Yep. It was terrible. You were in it.

1232
01:02:57,972 --> 01:03:00,433
- What? - It sounds like something's happening.

1233
01:03:09,984 --> 01:03:11,360
Annie, what are you doing up here?

1234
01:03:11,485 --> 01:03:12,861
You are supposed to be in your seat.

1235
01:03:12,945 --> 01:03:14,279
I know. I'm freaking out a little bit.

1236
01:03:14,363 --> 01:03:17,199
Ma'am, we're still ascending. You're gonna need to return to your seat.

1237
01:03:17,366 --> 01:03:18,617
Okay, I was just...

1238
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,703
Annie, I have something.

1239
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:24,456
Take two, you'll fall asleep, wake up and we'll be there. Here.

1240
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:28,502
Ma'am, you're going to have to return to your seat, please.

1241
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,170
- It's fine. - Okay. All right.

1242
01:03:30,254 --> 01:03:32,256
- Ma'am! - All right. All right.

1243
01:03:33,464 --> 01:03:36,717
Oh, my God, I feel terrible. I should be sitting back there with her.

1244
01:03:36,801 --> 01:03:39,720
I shouldn't be up here in first class. I feel like such a jerk.

1245
01:03:39,804 --> 01:03:41,722
Lil, this is your weekend, okay?

1246
01:03:41,848 --> 01:03:43,808
You are treating yourself. Just relax.

1247
01:03:44,016 --> 01:03:45,560
She will be fine. She will make friends.

1248
01:03:45,643 --> 01:03:47,770
There is much more sense of community in coach, I promise you.

1249
01:03:47,854 --> 01:03:48,938
She'll be fine.

1250
01:03:52,315 --> 01:03:55,026
I can't believe you've never been with anybody else.

1251
01:03:55,944 --> 01:03:57,112
Just Kevin.

1252
01:04:00,657 --> 01:04:02,117
I'm sorry. I just...

1253
01:04:02,367 --> 01:04:04,786
Becca, I just can't help but feel bad for you.

1254
01:04:05,203 --> 01:04:07,539
You don't even know what you want.

1255
01:04:07,706 --> 01:04:09,541
I got to know where you keep the gun, man.

1256
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:12,168
I mean, is it ankle, hip, lower back?

1257
01:04:12,376 --> 01:04:15,004
You don't... Between the cheeks, do you?

1258
01:04:15,087 --> 01:04:20,092
No, I don't stick a gun... up my butt. That's stupid.

1259
01:04:20,176 --> 01:04:21,302
I didn't say "up".

1260
01:04:21,552 --> 01:04:25,139
I just knew of a guy, that guy did a lot of undercover work.

1261
01:04:25,389 --> 01:04:29,310
And all I know is he had tape marks all up and down his cheeks.

1262
01:04:30,144 --> 01:04:31,312
That can't be true.

1263
01:04:31,562 --> 01:04:33,689
People don't keep guns up their asses

1264
01:04:33,772 --> 01:04:36,233
because if you needed to use it, how are you going to get it?

1265
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,818
He cut a hole in his pocket.

1266
01:04:37,985 --> 01:04:39,820
- What? - In his back pocket.

1267
01:04:40,237 --> 01:04:41,529
You have got to get something out of your ass

1268
01:04:41,613 --> 01:04:43,656
and you cut a hole in the back of your jeans,

1269
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:45,616
you want to tell me you can't get to something?

1270
01:04:46,283 --> 01:04:49,328
I don't have a gun for you to put up my ass to make your point.

1271
01:04:49,411 --> 01:04:51,538
I can put my Nano. I will show you.

1272
01:04:51,622 --> 01:04:53,040
I will... If you get me scissors,

1273
01:04:53,165 --> 01:04:54,583
I will cut a hole in my pocket.

1274
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:58,962
And you will never find this again until I want you to find it.

1275
01:05:00,214 --> 01:05:04,676
Kevin can only have sex in bed, in the dark, under the covers,

1276
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,094
only after we have showered

1277
01:05:06,678 --> 01:05:08,096
separately.

1278
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,265
And sometimes, by the time we are finished

1279
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:13,476
cleaning ourselves, he's too tired.

1280
01:05:14,393 --> 01:05:19,106
And then I pretend I'm tired, but I'm not tired. I'm not tired. I'm not tired.

1281
01:05:19,273 --> 01:05:22,276
That's why every girl needs those slutty college years.

1282
01:05:22,443 --> 01:05:26,072
To experiment, get it out of your system, find out what you like.

1283
01:05:26,781 --> 01:05:30,117
Excuse me, could I have a glass of alcohol when you get a chance?

1284
01:05:31,035 --> 01:05:33,913
Two double Seven and Sevens.

1285
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:36,289
Is that...

1286
01:05:36,456 --> 01:05:38,625
You will like it. It's sweet.

1287
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:40,293
I have to go to the bathroom.

1288
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:43,421
But I heard about a woman who went to the bathroom on a plane.

1289
01:05:43,588 --> 01:05:45,632
She got sucked into the toilet.

1290
01:05:46,633 --> 01:05:48,260
Sucked right in.

1291
01:05:51,388 --> 01:05:52,514
Are you okay?

1292
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,807
Yes.

1293
01:05:53,974 --> 01:05:57,477
Yeah, I just think that what you gave me didn't really do anything.

1294
01:05:57,644 --> 01:06:01,147
I just have too much adrenalin or something. But, thanks.

1295
01:06:01,898 --> 01:06:04,567
Why don't you take my scotch?

1296
01:06:04,734 --> 01:06:07,654
It will just give the pill a little kick that it needs.

1297
01:06:07,821 --> 01:06:09,489
- Honestly, I do it all the time. - Yeah?

1298
01:06:09,656 --> 01:06:12,117
Yeah, and I'm much smaller than you, so you'll handle it.

1299
01:06:13,325 --> 01:06:14,326
Well, thanks.

1300
01:06:14,493 --> 01:06:15,953
- Yeah? - Okay.

1301
01:06:29,466 --> 01:06:30,550
Yummy?

1302
01:06:30,675 --> 01:06:31,843
Yeah, it's good.

1303
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:34,137
You should just toss it back. Don't waste any more time.

1304
01:06:34,304 --> 01:06:35,346
Okay.

1305
01:06:40,184 --> 01:06:41,352
Look at that.

1306
01:06:43,521 --> 01:06:46,816
Okay, that'll do it. That'll do it.

1307
01:06:47,275 --> 01:06:48,985
So you don't even have sex anymore?

1308
01:06:49,152 --> 01:06:51,487
No, I have sex constantly.

1309
01:06:51,779 --> 01:06:53,114
The sex is constant.

1310
01:06:53,281 --> 01:06:55,950
But he hasn't kissed me in five years.

1311
01:06:56,117 --> 01:06:57,535
What are you doing when you are having sex, then?

1312
01:06:58,703 --> 01:07:01,539
Thinking about other things and wishing it would stop.

1313
01:07:02,332 --> 01:07:04,292
You know, sometimes I just want to watch

1314
01:07:04,417 --> 01:07:06,377
The Daily Show without him entering me.

1315
01:07:07,378 --> 01:07:09,797
- It's the Wet Republic Ultra Pool. - No.

1316
01:07:09,964 --> 01:07:11,132
Are you kidding?

1317
01:07:11,132 --> 01:07:12,467
What is it again?

1318
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:14,218
There is a bar in the pool and a tiger.

1319
01:07:14,344 --> 01:07:16,012
What?

1320
01:07:16,179 --> 01:07:18,014
It's crazy. It's Vegas at its best.

1321
01:07:18,181 --> 01:07:21,726
Wait a minute. Is this that place that was on The Real World?

1322
01:07:21,893 --> 01:07:24,520
Are you kidding me? Oh, my God. It's...

1323
01:07:24,687 --> 01:07:27,148
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

1324
01:07:27,315 --> 01:07:31,235
I'm good. I'm so much more relaxed. Thank you, Helen.

1325
01:07:31,402 --> 01:07:35,907
l just feel like I'm excited, and I feel relaxed.

1326
01:07:36,074 --> 01:07:38,201
And I'm ready

1327
01:07:38,368 --> 01:07:41,996
to party

1328
01:07:42,163 --> 01:07:45,416
with the best of them!

1329
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:50,004
♪ And I'm going to go down to the river ♪

1330
01:07:50,171 --> 01:07:54,926
Wow! It looks like somebody is really relaxing now.

1331
01:07:55,259 --> 01:07:58,262
What are you guys talking about up here?

1332
01:07:58,429 --> 01:08:01,099
We are going to a restaurant tonight. I know the owner, so...

1333
01:08:01,265 --> 01:08:02,767
You do?

1334
01:08:04,602 --> 01:08:06,729
Helen knows the owner.

1335
01:08:10,942 --> 01:08:12,110
Big whoop.

1336
01:08:12,276 --> 01:08:14,278
Let's go take a nap. What do you say?

1337
01:08:14,445 --> 01:08:16,447
Miss, you cannot be up here.

1338
01:08:16,614 --> 01:08:18,950
Hello, grandpa.

1339
01:08:20,034 --> 01:08:21,828
I'm sorry. I just want to be here with

1340
01:08:21,953 --> 01:08:23,788
my friends, because I'm with this group.

1341
01:08:23,955 --> 01:08:26,791
The sign just went off. Can't she stay up here for a minute and just talk?

1342
01:08:26,958 --> 01:08:27,959
Absolutely not.

1343
01:08:28,126 --> 01:08:30,086
Coach passengers are not allowed up here in first class.

1344
01:08:30,253 --> 01:08:31,587
It's policy. I'm sorry.

1345
01:08:32,964 --> 01:08:37,260
This is a very strict plane that I'm on.

1346
01:08:37,427 --> 01:08:39,095
Welcome to Germany.

1347
01:08:40,638 --> 01:08:44,308
Auf Wiedersehen, asshole.

1348
01:08:44,475 --> 01:08:45,476
All right.

1349
01:08:45,643 --> 01:08:46,644
Why don't you go lay down?

1350
01:08:46,811 --> 01:08:49,147
I'm going to go take a nap. I'm tired.

1351
01:08:49,272 --> 01:08:50,314
I think it's a good idea.

1352
01:08:50,481 --> 01:08:53,650
Catch you on the flip side, motherfuckers.

1353
01:08:54,776 --> 01:08:55,735
I'm sorry.

1354
01:08:55,819 --> 01:08:56,903
I'm leaving.

1355
01:08:56,987 --> 01:08:58,029
Thank you.

1356
01:08:59,405 --> 01:09:01,782
This should be open, because it's civil rights.

1357
01:09:01,949 --> 01:09:03,241
This is the '90s.

1358
01:09:03,408 --> 01:09:06,411
Right. It's not. You're in the wrong decade.

1359
01:09:06,578 --> 01:09:08,288
- You are. - Okay, I am.

1360
01:09:08,455 --> 01:09:09,497
Thank you.

1361
01:09:09,831 --> 01:09:12,292
Holy shit. What did you give her?

1362
01:09:30,852 --> 01:09:31,895
Miss?

1363
01:09:33,646 --> 01:09:35,773
No. It's not me.

1364
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:38,317
Yes, it is you. Please go back to your seat.

1365
01:09:38,484 --> 01:09:40,527
Yes, I am with him.

1366
01:09:40,694 --> 01:09:43,030
I am Mrs Iglesias.

1367
01:09:43,197 --> 01:09:44,198
No, you are not.

1368
01:09:44,323 --> 01:09:47,116
You were just out here and you put sunglasses on. Out.

1369
01:09:47,533 --> 01:09:48,534
But I don't want to.

1370
01:09:48,659 --> 01:09:51,036
Sir, she can have my seat, okay?

1371
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:53,288
Everyone should experience first class at least once in their lives.

1372
01:09:53,371 --> 01:09:55,665
And Annie shouldn't miss out just because she can't afford it.

1373
01:09:55,832 --> 01:09:57,375
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's not allowed.

1374
01:09:57,542 --> 01:09:59,502
- Help me, I'm poor. - No, listen,

1375
01:09:59,668 --> 01:10:02,379
we're a whole wedding party. I'm the bride. I'm getting married.

1376
01:10:02,546 --> 01:10:05,382
This seat is empty. She's obviously nervous. We'll calm her down and...

1377
01:10:05,549 --> 01:10:07,217
I understand. But Claire is right.

1378
01:10:07,383 --> 01:10:08,718
Everybody, go back to your seats.

1379
01:10:08,885 --> 01:10:10,385
Okay, you especially.

1380
01:10:10,552 --> 01:10:12,512
You have three seconds to get back to your seat.

1381
01:10:13,721 --> 01:10:15,806
You can't get anywhere in three seconds.

1382
01:10:15,973 --> 01:10:17,057
Well, you'd better try.

1383
01:10:17,224 --> 01:10:18,600
You are setting me up for a loss already.

1384
01:10:18,683 --> 01:10:19,726
Thank you.

1385
01:10:20,894 --> 01:10:23,396
Whatever you say, Stove.

1386
01:10:23,563 --> 01:10:24,898
It's Steve.

1387
01:10:26,233 --> 01:10:28,025
"Stove." What kind of name is that?

1388
01:10:28,192 --> 01:10:30,027
That's not a name. My name is Steve.

1389
01:10:30,194 --> 01:10:31,402
Are you an appliance?

1390
01:10:31,569 --> 01:10:33,404
No, I'm a man, and my name is Steve.

1391
01:10:33,571 --> 01:10:34,906
You are a flight attendant.

1392
01:10:35,073 --> 01:10:37,742
That's absolutely accurate.

1393
01:10:39,577 --> 01:10:41,913
You can close that. Thank you.

1394
01:10:46,417 --> 01:10:48,085
Hey, not-Air Marshall Jon.

1395
01:10:48,252 --> 01:10:50,879
You want to get back in that restroom and not rest?

1396
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:52,922
No, I have to get back to my seat.

1397
01:10:53,089 --> 01:10:55,716
Yeah, you gotta get back on my seat.

1398
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,761
You get it?

1399
01:10:58,928 --> 01:11:00,428
Yeah, I definitely got it.

1400
01:11:00,595 --> 01:11:02,097
What's that?

1401
01:11:04,224 --> 01:11:07,102
I got to get back to my seat. Could you just move your leg, please?

1402
01:11:07,269 --> 01:11:08,769
I got to go.

1403
01:11:11,105 --> 01:11:13,274
Somebody found a souvenir.

1404
01:11:13,774 --> 01:11:17,444
You feel that steam heat coming? That's from my undercarriage.

1405
01:11:17,778 --> 01:11:19,989
That can go up and higher.

1406
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:21,574
Okay.

1407
01:11:23,325 --> 01:11:25,119
Jon, get us a blanket.

1408
01:11:25,286 --> 01:11:26,620
No.

1409
01:11:26,787 --> 01:11:29,456
I got to take a whiz and I'll be right back.

1410
01:11:30,457 --> 01:11:31,500
Cool.

1411
01:11:33,794 --> 01:11:37,506
I don't want you to be a big fuck-up like me.

1412
01:11:37,673 --> 01:11:39,008
How do you think I feel?

1413
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:41,802
Like me. You can still turn it around.

1414
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:43,345
No, don't.

1415
01:11:44,637 --> 01:11:45,805
Stop it!

1416
01:11:45,972 --> 01:11:48,683
You are more beautiful than Cinderella.

1417
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:53,146
You smell like pine needles and you have a face like sunshine.

1418
01:12:06,659 --> 01:12:07,827
What?

1419
01:12:10,955 --> 01:12:12,123
Oh, no.

1420
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:14,709
Ladies and gentlemen,

1421
01:12:14,876 --> 01:12:18,045
as you can see, the captain has turned on the "fasten seatbelt" sign.

1422
01:12:18,211 --> 01:12:20,297
It appears we've run into a rough patch of weather...

1423
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:21,632
I have an announcement, too.

1424
01:12:21,715 --> 01:12:23,675
There is a Colonial woman on the wing.

1425
01:12:23,759 --> 01:12:25,135
There's a woman on the wing. I saw her.

1426
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:26,636
There's something they're not telling us!

1427
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:27,762
- Steve. - All right.

1428
01:12:27,845 --> 01:12:28,971
There's a Colonial woman.

1429
01:12:29,055 --> 01:12:30,765
- She was churning butter on that wing. - Steve, get her.

1430
01:12:30,848 --> 01:12:32,350
- She is out there right now. - Shit!

1431
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:34,810
Everyone, remain calm! I'm an Air Marshal.

1432
01:12:35,686 --> 01:12:38,356
Yes! I knew it. I got your back, Jon!

1433
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:39,857
There is a woman on the wing. I saw her.

1434
01:12:40,024 --> 01:12:41,442
There's something they're not telling us.

1435
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:43,485
Let's get out! Let's open the doors and get out!

1436
01:12:43,652 --> 01:12:46,237
She is dressed in traditional Colonial garb.

1437
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:48,531
Say goodbye! We are going down!

1438
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:49,658
Stay calm.

1439
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:51,033
There is something they are not telling us.

1440
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:52,784
There is a Colonial woman on the wing.

1441
01:12:53,368 --> 01:12:54,410
I will cover the pilot!

1442
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,125
Who is she? What does she want?

1443
01:13:32,365 --> 01:13:34,492
Just let me make it up to you, please.

1444
01:13:35,451 --> 01:13:37,370
I'm telling you,

1445
01:13:37,537 --> 01:13:40,206
your shower is going to be amazing.

1446
01:13:40,373 --> 01:13:42,291
I have so many ideas.

1447
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:44,126
I want to talk to you about the shower.

1448
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:46,669
I feel like...

1449
01:13:46,836 --> 01:13:50,840
it has been really overwhelming for you.

1450
01:13:51,632 --> 01:13:53,300
It's just starting to make you crazy.

1451
01:13:53,467 --> 01:13:55,970
No, Lil, I'm fine. I mean...

1452
01:13:57,304 --> 01:13:58,931
Lil, I'm fine.

1453
01:13:59,056 --> 01:14:00,640
No, you're not fine.

1454
01:14:00,807 --> 01:14:02,726
You are not fine, Annie,

1455
01:14:02,892 --> 01:14:05,937
and we need things to just

1456
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,107
flow smoothly from now on

1457
01:14:09,274 --> 01:14:12,777
and Helen just knows how to do this kind of stuff.

1458
01:14:12,944 --> 01:14:14,779
She does it all the time.

1459
01:14:14,946 --> 01:14:16,865
She is good at it. She likes doing it.

1460
01:14:17,449 --> 01:14:19,951
This way you don't have to...

1461
01:14:20,702 --> 01:14:24,455
plan any more lunches or trips.

1462
01:14:24,621 --> 01:14:26,457
You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.

1463
01:14:26,623 --> 01:14:27,958
I get it.

1464
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:30,461
I think it'll be best here on out

1465
01:14:30,627 --> 01:14:33,464
for the shower and for everything.

1466
01:14:33,964 --> 01:14:36,300
Yeah, whatever you want.

1467
01:14:36,467 --> 01:14:39,136
I mean, it's probably best.

1468
01:14:39,303 --> 01:14:41,346
I think so, right?

1469
01:14:41,513 --> 01:14:42,848
Yeah. I just want you to be happy.

1470
01:14:43,015 --> 01:14:45,142
I think that will make me happy. It will be good.

1471
01:14:45,309 --> 01:14:47,352
- Okay. - Okay.

1472
01:14:48,312 --> 01:14:49,480
Good.

1473
01:15:13,587 --> 01:15:14,588
Hey.

1474
01:15:15,005 --> 01:15:16,006
Hey.

1475
01:15:16,173 --> 01:15:18,675
Do you want to hang out?

1476
01:15:26,517 --> 01:15:27,935
It's not funny! Stop laughing.

1477
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,520
It's a little funny.

1478
01:15:29,686 --> 01:15:32,481
None of those girls are laughing, believe me.

1479
01:15:32,648 --> 01:15:34,857
It's not funny. Have you ever been kicked off a plane?

1480
01:15:35,024 --> 01:15:36,025
I can't say that I have.

1481
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:37,151
Thank you.

1482
01:15:37,318 --> 01:15:41,030
All of the girls... hate me right now.

1483
01:15:41,197 --> 01:15:43,366
You are like the maid of dishonour.

1484
01:15:45,868 --> 01:15:48,538
I hope Lillian isn't going to be mad at me for too long.

1485
01:15:48,704 --> 01:15:50,414
No, she will be all right.

1486
01:15:50,581 --> 01:15:51,999
I don't know, I just wish things were

1487
01:15:52,124 --> 01:15:53,543
the way that they used to be, you know.

1488
01:15:53,709 --> 01:15:55,545
I feel like her life is going off

1489
01:15:55,711 --> 01:15:59,048
and getting perfect, and mine is just like...

1490
01:16:00,883 --> 01:16:02,218
It will turn around, you know.

1491
01:16:02,385 --> 01:16:04,220
I have been hearing that for a long time.

1492
01:16:04,387 --> 01:16:05,930
It's going to turn around. I just know it.

1493
01:16:06,097 --> 01:16:07,723
Anyway.

1494
01:16:08,724 --> 01:16:09,892
You got to bake.

1495
01:16:10,059 --> 01:16:11,769
I don't really do that anymore, I told you.

1496
01:16:11,936 --> 01:16:13,104
Why?

1497
01:16:13,229 --> 01:16:14,437
I don't know, it's just...

1498
01:16:16,231 --> 01:16:19,234
I don't know, after it just went under, l just, kind of,

1499
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:22,279
stopped, I guess.

1500
01:16:22,445 --> 01:16:24,447
It doesn't make me happy anymore.

1501
01:16:24,614 --> 01:16:26,324
Just because you didn't make any money at it,

1502
01:16:26,408 --> 01:16:27,450
doesn't mean that you failed at it.

1503
01:16:28,285 --> 01:16:30,077
I lost a lot of money.

1504
01:16:30,244 --> 01:16:32,204
All my money.

1505
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:33,913
But you are so good at it.

1506
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,582
Oh, well. Let's change the subject.

1507
01:16:35,748 --> 01:16:37,917
No more baking. I'm done.

1508
01:16:38,084 --> 01:16:40,253
I don't know how you just can't do it anymore.

1509
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:43,715
If I wasn't a cop anymore, I would still...

1510
01:16:43,882 --> 01:16:44,883
Arrest people?

1511
01:16:45,049 --> 01:16:47,051
...go out with a gun and shoot people.

1512
01:16:47,844 --> 01:16:50,346
I probably wouldn't do that. I'm just trying to make you feel better.

1513
01:16:52,515 --> 01:16:54,183
You are okay, you know.

1514
01:16:55,393 --> 01:16:56,394
You don't know me very well.

1515
01:16:56,561 --> 01:16:58,770
I know you well enough to know that you're not so bad.

1516
01:16:58,937 --> 01:17:00,605
- You got some stuff. - Oh, yeah.

1517
01:17:00,771 --> 01:17:02,523
You got bits and pieces going on.

1518
01:17:02,607 --> 01:17:03,649
Thanks.

1519
01:17:03,733 --> 01:17:05,693
I have been thinking about you a little bit.

1520
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:07,570
About me? Really?

1521
01:17:07,737 --> 01:17:09,196
There is something about you.

1522
01:17:09,614 --> 01:17:11,908
Something about you that sticks.

1523
01:17:17,538 --> 01:17:19,373
I hate buttons.

1524
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:22,126
Where is the bedroom?

1525
01:17:26,881 --> 01:17:29,592
- Sorry. It's a mountain bike. - Are you okay?

1526
01:17:29,759 --> 01:17:31,135
- Do you like mountain biking? - Uh-huh.

1527
01:17:35,765 --> 01:17:36,933
Take this off.

1528
01:17:37,099 --> 01:17:38,475
I'm so glad this is happening.

1529
01:17:38,642 --> 01:17:39,893
So am I.

1530
01:17:54,824 --> 01:17:56,492
- Hello. - Morning.

1531
01:17:56,659 --> 01:17:58,202
Sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out.

1532
01:17:58,369 --> 01:17:59,620
No, it's okay.

1533
01:17:59,787 --> 01:18:01,872
I haven't been sitting here that long.

1534
01:18:06,251 --> 01:18:07,711
Sorry, I guess I fell asleep.

1535
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,881
I didn't mean to sleep over.

1536
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,841
Don't be silly.

1537
01:18:13,968 --> 01:18:15,468
I made you a cappuccino.

1538
01:18:15,635 --> 01:18:17,971
- Made it? - Yeah.

1539
01:18:18,972 --> 01:18:20,848
So, last night was fun.

1540
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:24,644
It was. It was very fun.

1541
01:18:26,187 --> 01:18:27,188
I had fun.

1542
01:18:27,355 --> 01:18:28,982
It was fun.

1543
01:18:30,316 --> 01:18:33,027
If you care to accompany me to the kitchen,

1544
01:18:33,194 --> 01:18:34,946
the fun may continue.

1545
01:18:35,113 --> 01:18:37,198
A different kind of fun.

1546
01:18:37,365 --> 01:18:40,952
But why don't you just get dressed and whatever, and...

1547
01:18:41,119 --> 01:18:42,453
I left your clothes over there.

1548
01:18:42,578 --> 01:18:43,913
Okay.

1549
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,372
And I'll see you in there.

1550
01:18:45,539 --> 01:18:46,873
Okay.

1551
01:18:51,378 --> 01:18:53,088
There she is.

1552
01:18:53,964 --> 01:18:55,756
Your workshop awaits.

1553
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:57,841
I know it's a bit crazy, but I popped out

1554
01:18:57,924 --> 01:19:00,760
and I got a few little baking bits and pieces.

1555
01:19:00,927 --> 01:19:02,053
Butter, milk.

1556
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:04,764
Because I thought that it would be fun for us to bake together today.

1557
01:19:04,931 --> 01:19:06,766
Obviously, you will be doing the baking.

1558
01:19:06,933 --> 01:19:08,560
I will be doing the eating.

1559
01:19:08,727 --> 01:19:10,895
Because you are the expert.

1560
01:19:11,312 --> 01:19:12,896
Yeah, I don't...

1561
01:19:13,063 --> 01:19:14,939
I don't really wanna...

1562
01:19:15,606 --> 01:19:17,650
Sorry. You went to all this trouble, but...

1563
01:19:17,817 --> 01:19:20,278
Come on, I know you haven't done it in a while, but it'll be great.

1564
01:19:20,445 --> 01:19:23,573
Don't be silly, just get into it. You are so good at it.

1565
01:19:24,865 --> 01:19:27,117
All right. I get it.

1566
01:19:27,284 --> 01:19:29,828
It was a bit of a curve ball.

1567
01:19:30,078 --> 01:19:31,954
Yeah, I think I'm going to go.

1568
01:19:32,121 --> 01:19:35,666
I'm sorry. I should just probably go.

1569
01:19:36,208 --> 01:19:37,251
Annie,

1570
01:19:38,377 --> 01:19:39,961
I don't know what you are getting so upset about.

1571
01:19:40,128 --> 01:19:41,546
Because you don't know me.

1572
01:19:42,172 --> 01:19:44,841
You don't know anything about me or my life or...

1573
01:19:45,008 --> 01:19:47,844
- Well, no, because... - I don't know what you're trying to do here.

1574
01:19:48,011 --> 01:19:50,096
- I don't need you to fix me. - To fix you?

1575
01:19:50,263 --> 01:19:52,640
I don't need any help. I mean, who do you think you are?

1576
01:19:52,807 --> 01:19:55,560
Jesus, Annie, we had a really good time. And now you are being all...

1577
01:19:55,727 --> 01:19:58,271
It's my fault. I shouldn't have come here last night.

1578
01:19:58,438 --> 01:20:00,482
Last night was a mistake.

1579
01:20:00,648 --> 01:20:02,024
Fucking hell. All right.

1580
01:20:17,998 --> 01:20:20,834
Hey, it's Lillian. Leave a message after the beep.

1581
01:20:21,668 --> 01:20:24,253
Hey, Lil, it's me.

1582
01:20:26,297 --> 01:20:31,052
I'm sure you're probably still a little bit mad at me, but I hope not.

1583
01:20:31,761 --> 01:20:35,932
Anyway, the excitement still continues with me.

1584
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:41,103
I just slept with a cop that pulled me over

1585
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:46,399
and I woke up today, and he was really sweet and nice and cute.

1586
01:20:46,691 --> 01:20:49,945
So, naturally, I ran out as fast as I could.

1587
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:51,780
What's wrong with me?

1588
01:20:53,406 --> 01:20:56,493
Anyway, I know you are busy and stuff,

1589
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:59,704
so just call me when you get a chance.

1590
01:20:59,871 --> 01:21:04,042
I'd love to talk this out with you when you can.

1591
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:06,128
Okay, bye.

1592
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:16,972
Annie! Annie, wake up.

1593
01:21:17,139 --> 01:21:18,890
It's 11:00 am.

1594
01:21:20,558 --> 01:21:22,309
Oh, shit.

1595
01:21:22,476 --> 01:21:24,103
You got a package.

1596
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:27,815
I'd bring it to you, but you said, "Don't touch my things."

1597
01:21:57,386 --> 01:21:59,138
Please join us for a Parisian brunch

1598
01:21:59,221 --> 01:22:00,973
at the home of Helen Harris III

1599
01:22:01,056 --> 01:22:04,225
to celebrate the marriage of Lillian Donovan and Douglas Price.

1600
01:22:04,726 --> 01:22:09,647
Let us shower Lillian with gifts and love. Répondez s'il vous plaît. Yay!

1601
01:22:18,448 --> 01:22:20,283
- Excuse me. - Oh. Hi.

1602
01:22:20,366 --> 01:22:22,827
I'm looking for a birthday gift for my best friend.

1603
01:22:22,911 --> 01:22:25,455
I want to get her a necklace that says, "Best Friends Forever."

1604
01:22:26,247 --> 01:22:27,749
You sure you want it to say "Forever"?

1605
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:29,751
Yeah, why?

1606
01:22:29,876 --> 01:22:31,544
Come on. "Forever"?

1607
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:33,421
Forever.

1608
01:22:33,504 --> 01:22:35,715
I don't think you guys will be best friends forever. No offence.

1609
01:22:35,798 --> 01:22:37,217
But you know...

1610
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,344
The friends you have when you are younger sometimes...

1611
01:22:39,594 --> 01:22:41,638
sometimes you grow apart when you get older.

1612
01:22:41,721 --> 01:22:43,264
Maybe she'll find a new best friend.

1613
01:22:43,431 --> 01:22:45,141
And maybe she will be more successful than you are

1614
01:22:45,225 --> 01:22:47,434
and prettier and richer and skinnier

1615
01:22:47,601 --> 01:22:49,853
and they end up doing everything together.

1616
01:22:50,979 --> 01:22:52,271
You are weird.

1617
01:22:52,521 --> 01:22:54,105
I'm not weird. Okay?

1618
01:22:54,773 --> 01:22:55,774
Yes, you are.

1619
01:22:55,857 --> 01:22:56,858
No, I'm not, and you started it.

1620
01:22:57,025 --> 01:22:58,568
No, you started it.

1621
01:22:58,735 --> 01:23:00,611
Did you forget to take your Xanax this morning?

1622
01:23:00,778 --> 01:23:02,278
God, I feel bad for your parents.

1623
01:23:02,362 --> 01:23:03,404
I feel bad for your face.

1624
01:23:03,696 --> 01:23:05,782
Okay, well, call me when your boobs come in.

1625
01:23:05,865 --> 01:23:07,533
You call me when yours come in.

1626
01:23:07,659 --> 01:23:09,619
- What, do you have four boyfriends? - Exactly.

1627
01:23:09,786 --> 01:23:12,664
Yeah, okay, have fun having a baby at your prom.

1628
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:14,374
You look like an old mop.

1629
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:16,376
You know what? You're not as popular as you think you are.

1630
01:23:16,459 --> 01:23:17,460
I am very popular.

1631
01:23:17,752 --> 01:23:19,712
I'm sure you are.

1632
01:23:20,171 --> 01:23:21,297
Very popular.

1633
01:23:21,464 --> 01:23:23,132
Well, you're an old, single loser

1634
01:23:23,258 --> 01:23:24,884
who is never going to have any friends.

1635
01:23:25,677 --> 01:23:26,969
You're a little cunt.

1636
01:23:35,018 --> 01:23:36,270
I'm sorry.

1637
01:23:40,023 --> 01:23:42,150
Let me tell my mom, okay.

1638
01:23:42,734 --> 01:23:44,402
I already told her.

1639
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:46,153
Was she mad?

1640
01:23:54,954 --> 01:23:57,248
Hi, Annie, it’s Rhodes again.

1641
01:23:57,415 --> 01:23:58,833
Since you're not returning any of my calls,

1642
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,418
I assume that you're not interested

1643
01:24:00,584 --> 01:24:02,837
in spending any more time with me, which is fine.

1644
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:06,424
So don't worry, I won't be bothering you ever again.

1645
01:24:07,258 --> 01:24:08,968
Get those taillights fixed.

1646
01:24:16,767 --> 01:24:21,022
We'd like to invite you to no longer live with us anymore.

1647
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,191
What? What do you mean? I don't get it.

1648
01:24:24,525 --> 01:24:27,445
The thing is, we decided that it was actually a bit immature

1649
01:24:27,528 --> 01:24:28,863
for a grown-up brother and sister to

1650
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,364
still be living together with a roommate.

1651
01:24:30,656 --> 01:24:33,451
- At our age, it's a bit ridiculous, isn't it? - Yeah.

1652
01:24:33,534 --> 01:24:35,661
- We look a bit silly, don't we? - Pathetic.

1653
01:24:35,828 --> 01:24:37,913
So we are actually going to live together alone.

1654
01:24:38,289 --> 01:24:39,540
Without you.

1655
01:24:39,749 --> 01:24:41,208
You're moving out.

1656
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,088
She's not moving.

1657
01:24:46,172 --> 01:24:47,423
She will move.

1658
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:48,841
- Eventually. - Eventually.

1659
01:24:48,924 --> 01:24:50,051
She has to.

1660
01:24:50,259 --> 01:24:51,343
She is taking it in.

1661
01:24:51,426 --> 01:24:53,010
You have to leave.

1662
01:24:53,177 --> 01:24:54,553
That's prickly.

1663
01:24:59,808 --> 01:25:01,392
- Hi. - Hi.

1664
01:25:03,394 --> 01:25:05,855
Remember when you thought I hit bottom?

1665
01:25:06,731 --> 01:25:08,066
That wasn't bottom.

1666
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:10,067
Come here.

1667
01:25:10,901 --> 01:25:13,737
We're gonna have fun. I, for one, am really glad you're here.

1668
01:25:14,237 --> 01:25:15,529
And guess what?

1669
01:25:16,072 --> 01:25:17,656
Good timing.

1670
01:25:18,157 --> 01:25:20,409
You know what just came in today on the Netflix?

1671
01:25:20,868 --> 01:25:22,995
Cast Away. Tom Hanks.

1672
01:25:23,162 --> 01:25:25,164
It's like Forrest Gump, but on an island.

1673
01:25:25,331 --> 01:25:27,416
Honey, you are gonna love it.

1674
01:25:55,945 --> 01:25:58,406
My God.

1675
01:25:58,864 --> 01:26:00,324
This is her driveway?

1676
01:26:01,867 --> 01:26:03,911
Who is that man?

1677
01:26:08,082 --> 01:26:10,291
Are you a guest of Helen Harris III?

1678
01:26:11,126 --> 01:26:13,294
Yes. Technically. I guess.

1679
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:15,463
An attendant will meet you at the stables.

1680
01:26:15,713 --> 01:26:16,881
Where?

1681
01:26:17,006 --> 01:26:18,216
The shower is over the second bridge.

1682
01:26:18,383 --> 01:26:21,261
- Pink lemonade? - Thank you.

1683
01:26:21,428 --> 01:26:24,472
I don't have a cup holder. Can I just give that...

1684
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:31,478
Pink lemonade. Nice. Nice touch.

1685
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,440
Shit.

1686
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,450
God damn it, that's good.

1687
01:26:47,453 --> 01:26:49,288
Shit, that is fresh.

1688
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:08,307
This is the most beautiful shower I have ever been to.

1689
01:27:08,682 --> 01:27:11,185
Yes, and Helen is giving out the cutest party favours.

1690
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:14,146
I know, I love their pink berets.

1691
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:31,538
- Would you like some champagne? - Yes.

1692
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:32,998
It's French.

1693
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:36,084
Annie. Hey.

1694
01:27:36,502 --> 01:27:37,503
Hi.

1695
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,506
How are you doing? You're here.

1696
01:27:41,048 --> 01:27:43,509
Yeah, I'm here. I was invited. Sorry.

1697
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:46,303
Of course you were invited. I just meant you have arrived.

1698
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:49,056
- No, I was just joking. - Okay.

1699
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,600
Can you believe this? Isn't it amazing?

1700
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:53,519
Yep.

1701
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,229
Yeah. It's nice.

1702
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:57,397
Yeah. Pretty.

1703
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,441
Are we okay?

1704
01:27:59,566 --> 01:28:01,068
Yes, I'm sorry I haven't called.

1705
01:28:01,235 --> 01:28:03,654
I just didn't want to bug you, but...

1706
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:06,073
Forgive me. It just got crazy.

1707
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:08,992
- There has been lots of organising, and... - I have so much to tell you.

1708
01:28:09,076 --> 01:28:11,578
I have to say hi to my aunt or she will get mad at my mom.

1709
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:13,080
No, you gotta go do your party rounds.

1710
01:28:13,247 --> 01:28:14,706
Yeah.

1711
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:16,041
I'll see you in a minute.

1712
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:17,334
Yeah. Okay.

1713
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,169
Rita, you got all our towels.

1714
01:28:19,253 --> 01:28:21,588
Yes, I did. Because I love you, kitten.

1715
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:23,840
All right, let's see what's next.

1716
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:26,009
Another one, another one, another one.

1717
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:29,513
I know who this is from. I can tell by the wrapping.

1718
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,056
Is that you?

1719
01:28:33,559 --> 01:28:35,894
Annie, you made this.

1720
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:37,938
Look.

1721
01:28:38,188 --> 01:28:39,898
- Oh, man. - Oh, my gosh.

1722
01:28:40,107 --> 01:28:41,650
It's us, Annie.

1723
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:44,236
Oh, my God. Let me see.

1724
01:28:45,696 --> 01:28:47,155
Oh, my God.

1725
01:28:48,115 --> 01:28:53,161
This is all my favourite stuff from all the stores I love in Milwaukee.

1726
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:56,290
Annie! This is so unbelievable.

1727
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:57,791
Wilson Phillips.

1728
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,459
Man, I love Wilson Phillips.

1729
01:29:00,626 --> 01:29:02,670
We listened to Hold On probably 10,000 times

1730
01:29:02,753 --> 01:29:04,505
when I got my driver's license.

1731
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:07,633
This is such an amazing gift.

1732
01:29:07,925 --> 01:29:09,301
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1733
01:29:10,427 --> 01:29:12,053
I feel really bad, Lil,

1734
01:29:12,137 --> 01:29:14,222
I didn't get a chance to actually get you a present

1735
01:29:14,306 --> 01:29:16,349
because I have been so busy organising the shower.

1736
01:29:16,433 --> 01:29:18,977
Helen, please. It's more than enough.

1737
01:29:19,144 --> 01:29:21,396
Here is a card to say congratulations.

1738
01:29:21,479 --> 01:29:25,317
Thank you. Gosh, you have really outdone yourself.

1739
01:29:27,652 --> 01:29:29,028
Oh, my God, Helen.

1740
01:29:30,988 --> 01:29:32,615
Honey, what is it?

1741
01:29:33,324 --> 01:29:35,701
Helen's taking me to Paris.

1742
01:29:38,495 --> 01:29:39,787
Your face!

1743
01:29:39,996 --> 01:29:41,456
I got you. I fooled you.

1744
01:29:41,539 --> 01:29:42,540
Look at your face.

1745
01:29:43,666 --> 01:29:46,835
It's just a little pre-wedding vacation. And while we're there,

1746
01:29:46,918 --> 01:29:49,171
we're gonna meet the designer of her dress and have a fitting.

1747
01:29:49,338 --> 01:29:51,840
You are taking me to Paris?

1748
01:29:52,007 --> 01:29:54,551
Oh, my God! This is the best present ever!

1749
01:29:55,177 --> 01:29:56,677
Thank you so much.

1750
01:29:56,802 --> 01:29:57,803
À Paris!

1751
01:29:57,928 --> 01:29:58,971
Oh, my God.

1752
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:00,764
Are you fucking kidding me?

1753
01:30:02,515 --> 01:30:03,807
- Annie! - No, Mom.

1754
01:30:03,891 --> 01:30:05,183
Motherfucking Paris?

1755
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:06,392
Annie, what are you doing?

1756
01:30:06,517 --> 01:30:09,812
I told you about Paris, Helen. I told you about this whole idea!

1757
01:30:09,896 --> 01:30:11,230
- Annie, calm down. - No, Lillian!

1758
01:30:11,356 --> 01:30:13,900
What, you're gonna go to Paris with Helen now?

1759
01:30:14,025 --> 01:30:16,110
What, you guys are gonna ride around on bikes

1760
01:30:16,194 --> 01:30:17,862
with berets and fucking baguettes

1761
01:30:17,987 --> 01:30:19,614
in the basket of the front of your bikes?

1762
01:30:19,697 --> 01:30:20,865
How romantic!

1763
01:30:21,157 --> 01:30:24,494
What woman gives another woman a trip to Paris?

1764
01:30:24,577 --> 01:30:26,537
Am I right? Lesbian.

1765
01:30:26,704 --> 01:30:28,288
- We're all thinking it, aren't we? - I'm not.

1766
01:30:28,372 --> 01:30:30,707
- Okay? Yes, we're all thinking it, right? - I was.

1767
01:30:30,874 --> 01:30:33,710
- Annie... - Lillian, this is not the "you" that I know.

1768
01:30:33,877 --> 01:30:35,212
The "you" that I know would have

1769
01:30:35,379 --> 01:30:36,713
walked in here and rolled your eyes

1770
01:30:36,838 --> 01:30:38,340
and thought this was completely

1771
01:30:38,465 --> 01:30:39,965
over-the-top, ridiculous and stupid.

1772
01:30:40,049 --> 01:30:43,552
Look at this shower! Look at that fucking cookie!

1773
01:30:43,761 --> 01:30:45,805
Did you really think that this group of women

1774
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:48,015
was going to finish that cookie?

1775
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:49,724
Really? You know what? That reminds me, actually.

1776
01:30:49,891 --> 01:30:53,395
I never got a chance to try that fucking cookie!

1777
01:30:55,063 --> 01:30:56,898
Stupid fucking cookie!

1778
01:31:00,568 --> 01:31:03,405
Delicious! Stupid cookie. I think I'll...

1779
01:31:04,613 --> 01:31:07,616
Maybe it's better if I dip it in the chocolate.

1780
01:31:14,707 --> 01:31:15,915
Is this what you want, Lillian?

1781
01:31:22,839 --> 01:31:24,131
This is so awesome.

1782
01:31:24,214 --> 01:31:30,595
All right, let's have some nice, hot, unsanitary chocolate!

1783
01:31:37,477 --> 01:31:39,646
It's hot! Jesus! God!

1784
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:42,399
Christ, Annie. Have you lost your fucking mind?

1785
01:31:42,482 --> 01:31:44,358
- What are you doing? - What am I doing?

1786
01:31:44,442 --> 01:31:46,527
You wouldn't know, would you? Where have you been?

1787
01:31:46,610 --> 01:31:48,779
You would have no idea. Let me fill you in, okay?

1788
01:31:48,988 --> 01:31:51,532
Ever since you got engaged, everything has turned to shit!

1789
01:31:51,615 --> 01:31:54,326
You know what? This is supposed to be about my time!

1790
01:31:54,452 --> 01:31:56,579
You have managed to ruin every event

1791
01:31:56,704 --> 01:31:58,831
in my wedding. Thank you very much.

1792
01:31:58,956 --> 01:32:00,291
Okay, well, thank you very much.

1793
01:32:00,416 --> 01:32:01,792
It's all her fault. It is not mine!

1794
01:32:01,876 --> 01:32:03,084
And you would know that,

1795
01:32:03,168 --> 01:32:06,171
if you got your beautiful haired head out of your asshole.

1796
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:10,467
In fact, out of her asshole, which I'm sure is perfectly bleached.

1797
01:32:10,592 --> 01:32:12,218
You know what? It is!

1798
01:32:12,302 --> 01:32:13,594
And you know how I know?

1799
01:32:13,677 --> 01:32:15,596
Because I went to the fucking salon with her

1800
01:32:15,721 --> 01:32:17,639
and I got my asshole bleached, too!

1801
01:32:17,973 --> 01:32:20,809
And I love my new asshole!

1802
01:32:21,727 --> 01:32:24,354
You know what? Why can't you just be happy for me

1803
01:32:24,438 --> 01:32:28,066
and then go home and talk behind my back later, like a normal person?

1804
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:32,195
I am happy for you, Lillian. I am very happy for you.

1805
01:32:32,278 --> 01:32:35,865
I wish you well. I won't bother you anymore.

1806
01:32:36,824 --> 01:32:39,577
Are you kidding me? Annie!

1807
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:41,328
Go, go, go, go, go!

1808
01:32:41,828 --> 01:32:44,122
Get back here! Stop.

1809
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:48,334
No, no! She does not get a party favour.

1810
01:32:48,542 --> 01:32:50,418
She does not get a dog!

1811
01:32:53,003 --> 01:32:54,587
And if you are going to act like this,

1812
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:57,089
then don't even bother coming to my wedding!

1813
01:33:05,807 --> 01:33:06,891
I'm proud of you, Lil.

1814
01:33:07,016 --> 01:33:08,142
Shut up, Helen!

1815
01:33:09,518 --> 01:33:12,395
Anybody else have anything they want to share today?

1816
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:17,943
I took two dogs already. They're in the back of my van.

1817
01:33:36,378 --> 01:33:37,712
What?

1818
01:33:47,222 --> 01:33:49,807
What? Where are you going?

1819
01:33:50,516 --> 01:33:52,059
Hit and run! Classy!

1820
01:33:52,309 --> 01:33:53,727
Perfect! Okay.

1821
01:33:54,854 --> 01:33:58,399
I'm gonna find you! I'm coming!

1822
01:33:58,566 --> 01:34:02,945
Come on! Come on! Come on.

1823
01:34:06,407 --> 01:34:08,409
No!

1824
01:34:23,716 --> 01:34:26,010
Shit.

1825
01:34:29,597 --> 01:34:31,806
I can't say I'm surprised.

1826
01:34:31,973 --> 01:34:34,142
I did tell you to get your lights fixed.

1827
01:34:34,309 --> 01:34:35,809
Yeah, I know.

1828
01:34:35,934 --> 01:34:38,061
And now here we are.

1829
01:34:39,605 --> 01:34:43,025
Look, I have had a horrible day.

1830
01:34:43,191 --> 01:34:45,568
I don't need a lecture from you right now, okay?

1831
01:34:45,735 --> 01:34:47,278
I just... Helen just...

1832
01:34:47,737 --> 01:34:48,738
Don't...

1833
01:34:49,113 --> 01:34:50,907
This didn't happen because of Helen.

1834
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,951
This happened because you didn't get your taillights fixed.

1835
01:34:54,118 --> 01:34:55,620
It's pretty simple.

1836
01:34:59,123 --> 01:35:01,417
Do you have any idea how frustrating it is

1837
01:35:01,542 --> 01:35:03,878
to see you, night by night, drive past me

1838
01:35:04,045 --> 01:35:06,756
with your fucking taillights still broken?

1839
01:35:06,923 --> 01:35:09,050
Do you have any idea how crazy that makes me?

1840
01:35:09,216 --> 01:35:11,636
It's a simple solution!

1841
01:35:11,719 --> 01:35:12,803
Your problem, Annie,

1842
01:35:12,887 --> 01:35:15,806
is that you just don't understand that you can hurt people

1843
01:35:16,098 --> 01:35:18,142
with these broken lights.

1844
01:35:19,393 --> 01:35:21,479
Don't you see how irresponsible this is?

1845
01:35:21,562 --> 01:35:25,315
Yes, I should have gotten my fucking taillights fixed.

1846
01:35:25,482 --> 01:35:27,400
But I didn't, okay? I didn't.

1847
01:35:27,567 --> 01:35:29,736
Listen, don't worry about it.

1848
01:35:29,903 --> 01:35:32,447
Seriously. Your message was received.

1849
01:35:32,614 --> 01:35:35,407
No, look, please, I don't know what's going on with me right now.

1850
01:35:35,491 --> 01:35:39,328
Look, it's fine. Don't bother. Really, what's done is done.

1851
01:35:39,495 --> 01:35:40,995
That's it? Where are you going?

1852
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:43,748
That's it! That's it. That's how this works.

1853
01:35:43,873 --> 01:35:44,916
Come on. I didn't...

1854
01:35:44,999 --> 01:35:48,752
For the record, Annie, you flirted with me.

1855
01:35:49,127 --> 01:35:53,090
You made me feel like you really liked me,

1856
01:35:53,173 --> 01:35:54,508
which was really unfair.

1857
01:35:54,841 --> 01:35:58,345
And then you came home with me and we did stuff, fun stuff,

1858
01:35:59,513 --> 01:36:01,807
and then you just left, just like it was nothing.

1859
01:36:02,349 --> 01:36:05,894
Oh, please. I know how guys do this thing.

1860
01:36:05,978 --> 01:36:07,478
I know how guys act.

1861
01:36:07,645 --> 01:36:10,189
One minute, it means something. The next minute, it doesn't.

1862
01:36:10,314 --> 01:36:11,357
Right, yeah, you've got it all figured out.

1863
01:36:11,482 --> 01:36:12,525
Yeah.

1864
01:36:12,608 --> 01:36:15,319
How is that working out for you? Pretty good?

1865
01:36:18,614 --> 01:36:19,782
Boom!

1866
01:36:19,865 --> 01:36:22,201
What's up, fuck-buddy? You call for some roadside assistance?

1867
01:36:27,039 --> 01:36:30,626
Thanks, officer. I can handle it from here on out.

1868
01:36:35,673 --> 01:36:36,716
Come on!

1869
01:36:38,050 --> 01:36:39,677
I didn't have anyone else to call!

1870
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,136
I didn't know that you were gonna show up!

1871
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:42,637
That's the problem with cops, Annie.

1872
01:36:42,762 --> 01:36:44,222
We're just never there when you need us.

1873
01:36:46,349 --> 01:36:47,392
That cop talks weird.

1874
01:36:54,315 --> 01:36:57,694
Come on, dingus. Tick-tock. I got shit to do.

1875
01:36:58,737 --> 01:37:01,072
Check it out. Look what's steering the car.

1876
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:08,955
Thanks again for picking me up.

1877
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:10,539
Not a problem.

1878
01:37:11,081 --> 01:37:12,457
Were you busy?

1879
01:37:12,707 --> 01:37:14,876
Well, it is Friday.

1880
01:37:17,085 --> 01:37:19,796
You know, you look tired.

1881
01:37:19,921 --> 01:37:22,007
If you're tired, you can totally

1882
01:37:22,132 --> 01:37:24,259
lay down in my lap, if you want.

1883
01:37:24,801 --> 01:37:25,844
What?

1884
01:37:25,927 --> 01:37:28,180
Just take a little lap-nap.

1885
01:37:34,436 --> 01:37:35,854
If you want.

1886
01:37:36,646 --> 01:37:38,065
Open for biz.

1887
01:37:38,231 --> 01:37:39,775
Okay, can you just pull over?

1888
01:37:39,941 --> 01:37:41,860
Yeah, actually, that's an even better idea.

1889
01:37:41,943 --> 01:37:45,363
No, no, no, can you please just stop the car? I want to get out.

1890
01:37:45,447 --> 01:37:46,615
No, it's super gravelly.

1891
01:37:46,698 --> 01:37:48,658
- Please pull over! - Why?

1892
01:37:48,742 --> 01:37:51,119
Because I would rather get murdered out here

1893
01:37:51,203 --> 01:37:53,371
than spend the next half-an-hour with you.

1894
01:37:53,455 --> 01:37:55,082
Can you please just pull over?

1895
01:37:55,457 --> 01:37:57,542
Come on, Annie. It's called humour.

1896
01:37:57,709 --> 01:37:59,544
Learn about it.

1897
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:02,339
Besides, I would never last a half-hour.

1898
01:38:06,885 --> 01:38:08,011
Goodbye, Ted.

1899
01:38:12,557 --> 01:38:15,352
If you're trying to turn me on, it's working.

1900
01:38:17,479 --> 01:38:19,106
You used me!

1901
01:38:19,272 --> 01:38:22,567
No big deal. You are no longer my number three!

1902
01:38:35,539 --> 01:38:36,706
Wilson!

1903
01:38:40,127 --> 01:38:43,712
Wilson! I'm sorry!

1904
01:38:45,548 --> 01:38:47,466
I'm sorry, Wilson.

1905
01:38:48,425 --> 01:38:50,636
Wilson, I'm sorry!

1906
01:38:51,387 --> 01:38:52,388
I'm sorry!

1907
01:38:52,471 --> 01:38:53,763
Oh, no, Wilson.

1908
01:38:53,930 --> 01:38:55,098
Wilson!

1909
01:38:57,308 --> 01:38:58,976
I'm coming in.

1910
01:38:59,143 --> 01:39:01,145
Let's go, let's go. And we're walking.

1911
01:39:01,562 --> 01:39:03,438
Okay, we're walking. Heel. Heel!

1912
01:39:03,856 --> 01:39:06,191
No pee. No! Not on the carpet!

1913
01:39:06,358 --> 01:39:08,485
Okay, we're coming... We're coming in.

1914
01:39:08,569 --> 01:39:10,946
Everybody is in and having fun.

1915
01:39:11,113 --> 01:39:13,365
We're having fun. And heel! We're heeling.

1916
01:39:14,074 --> 01:39:15,075
Heel!

1917
01:39:15,534 --> 01:39:16,952
How many of those did you take?

1918
01:39:17,077 --> 01:39:18,537
I took nine.

1919
01:39:18,704 --> 01:39:19,746
I took nine.

1920
01:39:19,913 --> 01:39:24,668
Yeah, I did slightly over-commit to the whole dog thing.

1921
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:27,671
It turns out, I'm probably more comfortable with six.

1922
01:39:27,838 --> 01:39:30,924
It's a lot... That's a lot of energy to deal with.

1923
01:39:31,091 --> 01:39:32,675
But you wouldn't know anything about that,

1924
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,384
because you haven't been returning my calls.

1925
01:39:36,052 --> 01:39:38,096
And say what, Megan?

1926
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:41,141
Say, "Hi, I can't get off the couch.

1927
01:39:41,349 --> 01:39:44,811
"I got fired from my job. I got kicked out of my apartment.

1928
01:39:44,895 --> 01:39:48,148
"I can't pay any of my bills. My car is a piece of shit.

1929
01:39:48,231 --> 01:39:50,775
"I don't have any friends. The last time I...

1930
01:39:50,859 --> 01:39:53,195
You know what I find interesting about that, Annie?

1931
01:39:53,278 --> 01:39:56,239
It's interesting to me that you have absolutely no friends.

1932
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:57,782
You know why it's interesting?

1933
01:39:57,949 --> 01:39:59,284
Here's a friend standing directly

1934
01:39:59,409 --> 01:40:00,785
in front of you, trying to talk to you.

1935
01:40:00,911 --> 01:40:02,329
And you choose to talk about the fact

1936
01:40:02,454 --> 01:40:03,872
that you don't have any friends.

1937
01:40:03,955 --> 01:40:05,331
You know what I mean.

1938
01:40:05,456 --> 01:40:06,832
No, I don't think you want any help.

1939
01:40:06,916 --> 01:40:08,959
- I think you want to have a little pity party. - That's not true.

1940
01:40:09,043 --> 01:40:11,128
I think Annie wants a little pity party.

1941
01:40:11,253 --> 01:40:13,297
- You're an asshole, Annie! - Oh, my God. What are you doing?

1942
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:15,965
You're an asshole. I'm life. Is life bothering you?

1943
01:40:16,049 --> 01:40:17,091
Yes! What are you doing?

1944
01:40:17,258 --> 01:40:18,301
I'm life, Annie. I'm life, Annie.

1945
01:40:18,509 --> 01:40:20,929
You have got to fight back on life.

1946
01:40:21,012 --> 01:40:22,263
Megan!

1947
01:40:22,388 --> 01:40:23,640
You better learn to fight.

1948
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:24,891
Megan!

1949
01:40:24,974 --> 01:40:26,768
I'm life and I'm going to bite you in the ass!

1950
01:40:28,937 --> 01:40:30,855
- Megan... - It's not me. I'm your life. Turn over!

1951
01:40:30,939 --> 01:40:32,106
My God!

1952
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:36,069
I'm trying to get you to fight for your shitty life, and you won't do it!

1953
01:40:36,152 --> 01:40:37,195
- You just won't do it. - Stop it.

1954
01:40:37,445 --> 01:40:39,614
You stop slapping yourself. Stop slapping yourself.

1955
01:40:39,781 --> 01:40:42,283
I'm your life, Annie. I'm your shitty...

1956
01:40:43,659 --> 01:40:44,660
I'm sorry.

1957
01:40:45,786 --> 01:40:46,787
Nice hit.

1958
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:50,581
All right.

1959
01:40:50,665 --> 01:40:52,917
I'm glad to see you've got a little bit of spark in you.

1960
01:40:53,751 --> 01:40:55,627
I knew that Annie was in there somewhere.

1961
01:40:56,002 --> 01:40:57,462
I think...

1962
01:40:57,629 --> 01:41:00,966
I think you're ready now to hear a little story about a girl.

1963
01:41:01,132 --> 01:41:03,176
A girl named Megan.

1964
01:41:03,343 --> 01:41:04,843
A girl named Megan that didn't have

1965
01:41:04,969 --> 01:41:06,512
a very good time in high school.

1966
01:41:06,679 --> 01:41:09,765
I'm referring to myself when I say "Megan".

1967
01:41:09,932 --> 01:41:11,850
- It's me, Megan. - Yeah, I got that.

1968
01:41:12,017 --> 01:41:13,519
I know you look at me now and think,

1969
01:41:13,602 --> 01:41:15,562
"Boy, she must have breezed through high school."

1970
01:41:15,646 --> 01:41:17,189
Not the case, Annie.

1971
01:41:17,273 --> 01:41:21,110
No, this was not easy going up and down the halls. Okay?

1972
01:41:21,193 --> 01:41:22,777
They used to try to blow me up.

1973
01:41:22,902 --> 01:41:24,486
They threw firecrackers at my head.

1974
01:41:25,112 --> 01:41:26,113
Firecrackers.

1975
01:41:26,488 --> 01:41:28,907
I mean literally. I'm not saying that figuratively.

1976
01:41:28,991 --> 01:41:31,702
I got firecrackers thrown at my head. They called me a freak.

1977
01:41:32,244 --> 01:41:33,495
Do you think I let that break me?

1978
01:41:33,912 --> 01:41:36,206
Do you think I went home to my mommy, crying,

1979
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:39,042
"I don't have any friends. Megan doesn't have any friends"?

1980
01:41:39,126 --> 01:41:41,503
No, I did not. You know what I did?

1981
01:41:41,586 --> 01:41:44,089
I pulled myself up, I studied really hard.

1982
01:41:44,172 --> 01:41:46,341
I read every book in the library. And now?

1983
01:41:46,425 --> 01:41:47,843
I work for the government. I have

1984
01:41:47,968 --> 01:41:49,386
the highest possible security clearance.

1985
01:41:49,469 --> 01:41:51,013
- Don't repeat that! - I won't.

1986
01:41:51,096 --> 01:41:52,139
I can't protect you.

1987
01:41:52,431 --> 01:41:54,683
I know where all the nukes are and I know the codes.

1988
01:41:56,685 --> 01:41:57,728
I won't say anything.

1989
01:41:57,978 --> 01:42:00,105
You would be amazed.

1990
01:42:00,355 --> 01:42:01,690
A lot of shopping malls.

1991
01:42:01,898 --> 01:42:03,108
Don't repeat that!

1992
01:42:03,233 --> 01:42:04,484
I won't.

1993
01:42:04,651 --> 01:42:05,735
I have six houses.

1994
01:42:06,110 --> 01:42:09,155
I bought an 18-wheeler a couple of months ago just because I could.

1995
01:42:09,238 --> 01:42:10,448
Okay, you lost Lillian.

1996
01:42:10,531 --> 01:42:11,866
You got another best friend

1997
01:42:11,949 --> 01:42:13,617
sitting right in front of you, if you would notice.

1998
01:42:14,535 --> 01:42:15,578
Huh?

1999
01:42:15,661 --> 01:42:17,371
Now, you got to stop feeling sorry for yourself.

2000
01:42:18,039 --> 01:42:19,665
Okay, 'cause I do not associate with people

2001
01:42:19,790 --> 01:42:21,417
that blame the world for their problems.

2002
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:23,252
'Cause you're your problem, Annie.

2003
01:42:23,419 --> 01:42:25,796
And you're also your solution.

2004
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:28,883
Right? I mean, that's...

2005
01:42:28,966 --> 01:42:31,093
You get that?

2006
01:42:32,261 --> 01:42:33,721
I just miss her, I guess.

2007
01:42:34,638 --> 01:42:36,766
Yeah, I know you do.

2008
01:42:37,224 --> 01:42:39,184
I know you do.

2009
01:42:39,601 --> 01:42:41,561
All right, come on. Bring it in.

2010
01:42:41,644 --> 01:42:43,063
There's the Annie...

2011
01:42:43,146 --> 01:42:44,856
There's the Annie I knew was there, okay?

2012
01:42:44,981 --> 01:42:47,233
All right. Man, you have got to wash your hair.

2013
01:42:47,359 --> 01:42:48,360
I'm sorry.

2014
01:42:48,443 --> 01:42:49,861
You've got to wash that hair.

2015
01:43:15,512 --> 01:43:16,804
What's wrong?

2016
01:43:16,970 --> 01:43:18,305
Nothing.

2017
01:43:23,268 --> 01:43:24,311
I love you.

2018
01:43:37,825 --> 01:43:40,285
Looks great. Thank you.

2019
01:43:40,536 --> 01:43:44,331
Rhodes and I worked out a deal way back when, so it's on the house.

2020
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:46,124
Are you serious?

2021
01:43:46,332 --> 01:43:48,626
Yeah. I owe him big time.

2022
01:43:48,876 --> 01:43:50,628
That's really nice.

2023
01:43:58,052 --> 01:43:59,303
Hey, Mom?

2024
01:44:01,472 --> 01:44:02,764
This is my mom, Judy.

2025
01:44:02,848 --> 01:44:04,850
Hey, how are you? Nice to meet you.

2026
01:44:04,933 --> 01:44:06,852
Good to meet you, too.

2027
01:44:07,853 --> 01:44:09,855
Wait a minute, don't I know you from AA?

2028
01:44:10,188 --> 01:44:13,525
Oh, my gosh. You made that artichoke dip, didn't you?

2029
01:44:13,692 --> 01:44:15,192
It's good, huh?

2030
01:44:15,276 --> 01:44:16,318
It's just delicious.

2031
01:45:21,217 --> 01:45:22,218
Come in.

2032
01:45:26,805 --> 01:45:28,891
Are you sure you're not gonna come with me today?

2033
01:45:29,141 --> 01:45:30,643
It's Lillian's big day.

2034
01:45:30,726 --> 01:45:32,518
Mom, she doesn't want me there.

2035
01:45:36,189 --> 01:45:38,149
I'll fix you a tuna fish sandwich.

2036
01:45:38,441 --> 01:45:39,733
Mom, it's 8:00 in the morning.

2037
01:45:39,858 --> 01:45:41,276
You can put syrup on it.

2038
01:45:51,245 --> 01:45:52,663
I know.

2039
01:45:53,830 --> 01:45:54,831
Hi.

2040
01:45:55,165 --> 01:45:56,249
What do you want?

2041
01:45:56,415 --> 01:45:58,459
I was wondering if you knew where Lillian was.

2042
01:45:58,834 --> 01:46:00,753
No, why would I... What do you mean?

2043
01:46:01,128 --> 01:46:03,756
I can't find her. We've looked everywhere.

2044
01:46:03,923 --> 01:46:05,007
What?

2045
01:46:05,091 --> 01:46:07,260
She is missing. Can you help?

2046
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:09,428
Okay, just wait here. I think I know

2047
01:46:09,595 --> 01:46:11,263
someone that might be able to help.

2048
01:46:11,429 --> 01:46:13,598
- I'll get my keys. - Can I just use...

2049
01:46:16,767 --> 01:46:20,688
I mean, l just don't know what could have possibly gone wrong.

2050
01:46:20,771 --> 01:46:22,355
Everything was going smoothly.

2051
01:46:22,438 --> 01:46:24,398
The dress looked fantastic. It had come in from Paris.

2052
01:46:24,773 --> 01:46:27,025
Dougie was being great and very helpful.

2053
01:46:27,109 --> 01:46:31,738
I had organised everything to the last final detail.

2054
01:46:31,822 --> 01:46:33,282
I just...

2055
01:46:33,448 --> 01:46:35,116
I don't know what's happened to her.

2056
01:46:35,324 --> 01:46:37,451
I don't know. You should know, right?

2057
01:46:37,535 --> 01:46:40,830
You're her best friend. It's weird that you don't know.

2058
01:46:40,997 --> 01:46:42,248
You guys are so close.

2059
01:46:46,335 --> 01:46:49,839
Annie, I want to apologise to you personally

2060
01:46:49,964 --> 01:46:52,717
for all of the things that have gone down.

2061
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,719
I know that I hurt you,

2062
01:46:54,802 --> 01:46:57,305
and that I created a distance between you and Lillian.

2063
01:46:57,388 --> 01:46:59,223
- I want to apologise for that... - I don't want to hear...

2064
01:46:59,307 --> 01:47:00,850
...and everything that happened

2065
01:47:00,975 --> 01:47:02,518
at the shower. And with Las Vegas...

2066
01:47:02,601 --> 01:47:04,395
Okay, I don't want to hear any more, honestly.

2067
01:47:04,478 --> 01:47:06,564
I don't even want to talk to you.

2068
01:47:07,189 --> 01:47:09,442
Harry never really wants to talk to me, either.

2069
01:47:09,525 --> 01:47:12,236
He travels a lot. Like, all year.

2070
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:14,947
I'm basically just by myself.

2071
01:47:15,031 --> 01:47:18,075
I don't want to... I don't feel sorry for you.

2072
01:47:19,243 --> 01:47:20,995
I really liked that original dress

2073
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:22,830
you picked at the bridal store.

2074
01:47:22,913 --> 01:47:25,833
I thought it was beautiful. You have really lovely taste.

2075
01:47:25,916 --> 01:47:29,378
Thanks, but it's a little too late for that.

2076
01:47:29,545 --> 01:47:30,713
And I know...

2077
01:47:30,796 --> 01:47:33,757
I don't think that Brazilian food really gave us food poisoning.

2078
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:34,841
No, it did.

2079
01:47:35,008 --> 01:47:35,967
No, I don't think it did.

2080
01:47:36,051 --> 01:47:38,053
It was the food. I shit my pants on the way home.

2081
01:47:38,136 --> 01:47:39,554
I don't think it was your fault.

2082
01:47:40,096 --> 01:47:41,848
That was my fault.

2083
01:47:42,724 --> 01:47:45,393
I think people just ask me to their weddings

2084
01:47:45,518 --> 01:47:48,188
because I'm good at organising parties.

2085
01:47:50,273 --> 01:47:53,026
I don't have any female friends.

2086
01:47:54,069 --> 01:47:55,569
I'm so sorry.

2087
01:47:55,944 --> 01:47:58,072
Why are you smiling, Annie?

2088
01:47:58,238 --> 01:47:59,906
It's just... It's just...

2089
01:48:00,073 --> 01:48:02,533
It's the first time I've ever seen you look ugly.

2090
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:04,452
And that makes me kind of happy.

2091
01:48:05,203 --> 01:48:08,580
I look ugly? No, I don't. I don't really look ugly.

2092
01:48:08,663 --> 01:48:10,957
A little bit. You're an ugly crier, but that's okay.

2093
01:48:11,041 --> 01:48:12,751
No, I'm not really an ugly crier.

2094
01:48:12,959 --> 01:48:14,419
- Maybe just a little bit. - No.

2095
01:48:14,586 --> 01:48:15,921
Just a little bit.

2096
01:48:16,797 --> 01:48:18,757
It's just my makeup.

2097
01:48:18,924 --> 01:48:20,967
But I still look pretty good.

2098
01:48:24,554 --> 01:48:25,764
Rhodes!

2099
01:48:27,056 --> 01:48:28,057
Rhodes.

2100
01:48:28,766 --> 01:48:30,058
Rhodes.

2101
01:48:31,226 --> 01:48:32,685
Come on! Rhodes!

2102
01:48:32,977 --> 01:48:34,479
- He's ignoring you. Let me. - Yes, he is.

2103
01:48:34,562 --> 01:48:36,564
Officer! Roll down your window!

2104
01:48:36,731 --> 01:48:39,609
Excuse me! Please!

2105
01:48:40,652 --> 01:48:43,363
Rhodes, I know you can hear me, and I know you're mad at me,

2106
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:46,157
but I need your help. Please!

2107
01:48:48,993 --> 01:48:50,661
You know this guy?

2108
01:48:59,837 --> 01:49:00,921
What are you doing?

2109
01:49:01,004 --> 01:49:02,631
I just want to get his attention.

2110
01:49:03,923 --> 01:49:06,008
Annie! Oh, my God.

2111
01:49:08,761 --> 01:49:10,555
Reckless driving!

2112
01:49:12,849 --> 01:49:16,602
Annie, my hair! What are you doing?

2113
01:49:16,727 --> 01:49:18,938
I'm speeding! You better pull me over!

2114
01:49:22,107 --> 01:49:23,150
Really?

2115
01:49:23,316 --> 01:49:25,152
Here comes the litter-bug!

2116
01:49:29,656 --> 01:49:31,616
Let's see what Marmaduke's doing.

2117
01:49:31,908 --> 01:49:34,369
Just texting. Talking on the phone while I'm driving.

2118
01:49:34,453 --> 01:49:36,955
Not even using my hands. Oh, hi!

2119
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:40,041
Yum! Yum!

2120
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:41,750
Beer!

2121
01:49:41,876 --> 01:49:42,877
Yum! Yum! Yum!

2122
01:49:43,627 --> 01:49:44,670
Idiot.

2123
01:49:47,006 --> 01:49:48,882
Hey, what's up, man?

2124
01:49:59,099 --> 01:50:01,226
I don't care. I don't care.

2125
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:09,357
I'm going to hurl. I feel really sick, Annie!

2126
01:50:11,109 --> 01:50:13,361
Hey, who's driving that car?

2127
01:50:16,114 --> 01:50:17,157
Can we go up now?

2128
01:50:18,116 --> 01:50:19,992
That's not clever.

2129
01:50:20,326 --> 01:50:21,410
Hey!

2130
01:50:21,494 --> 01:50:22,994
I'm topless!

2131
01:50:24,286 --> 01:50:25,786
I'm totally topless.

2132
01:50:35,338 --> 01:50:36,546
Really?

2133
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:40,508
Wow. Unbelievable.

2134
01:50:40,841 --> 01:50:42,551
What the fuck are you doing?

2135
01:50:42,718 --> 01:50:43,761
I don't know.

2136
01:50:43,844 --> 01:50:45,387
Hey! Are you crazy?

2137
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:46,847
Are you crazy?

2138
01:50:47,014 --> 01:50:49,934
All of that stuff, that would have been dangerous for a good driver.

2139
01:50:50,184 --> 01:50:53,187
I'm sorry. I just... I really need your help.

2140
01:50:53,354 --> 01:50:54,480
We can't find Lillian.

2141
01:50:55,856 --> 01:50:57,107
How long has she been gone?

2142
01:50:57,233 --> 01:50:58,484
She's been missing for 12 hours.

2143
01:50:58,651 --> 01:50:59,902
12 hours?

2144
01:51:00,069 --> 01:51:02,613
It's not a missing person until it's at least 24 hours.

2145
01:51:02,696 --> 01:51:04,907
Have you ever seen CSI? 24 hours.

2146
01:51:05,366 --> 01:51:07,575
Let me get on with my job, Annie.

2147
01:51:07,742 --> 01:51:10,495
Nathan, please?

2148
01:51:10,662 --> 01:51:11,704
I really need your help.

2149
01:51:13,790 --> 01:51:15,082
Please, Nathan.

2150
01:51:15,707 --> 01:51:16,708
Who is this one?

2151
01:51:17,167 --> 01:51:18,210
- This is Helen. - I'm Helen.

2152
01:51:18,377 --> 01:51:19,545
What?

2153
01:51:19,711 --> 01:51:20,879
It's Helen.

2154
01:51:21,213 --> 01:51:25,217
Hello, Helen. I've heard wonderful things.

2155
01:51:28,386 --> 01:51:31,472
Okay, thanks, buddy. Bye-bye.

2156
01:51:31,639 --> 01:51:33,223
Okay, we've traced her cell phone

2157
01:51:33,390 --> 01:51:34,974
to the corner of Craner and Rose.

2158
01:51:35,808 --> 01:51:37,142
Do you know where that is?

2159
01:51:37,226 --> 01:51:39,270
Yes. That is her apartment.

2160
01:51:40,062 --> 01:51:41,230
I thought you said you looked there.

2161
01:51:41,397 --> 01:51:42,439
We did. We did. Last night.

2162
01:51:42,565 --> 01:51:43,607
Okay.

2163
01:51:43,899 --> 01:51:46,652
So you're saying she's at her apartment? That's what you're telling me?

2164
01:51:46,735 --> 01:51:48,403
She must have gone back after you left.

2165
01:51:48,486 --> 01:51:49,778
God, that was crazy of her.

2166
01:51:50,028 --> 01:51:51,238
Thank God! Thank you. Let's go. Let's go.

2167
01:51:51,363 --> 01:51:52,573
Okay.

2168
01:51:56,034 --> 01:51:57,410
We found her!

2169
01:52:01,205 --> 01:52:03,833
I am so sorry. I didn't mean to waste your time.

2170
01:52:03,916 --> 01:52:05,751
That's embarrassing.

2171
01:52:06,919 --> 01:52:08,838
- Thank you - No, you are welcome.

2172
01:52:08,921 --> 01:52:10,923
It's this kind of high-octane stuff

2173
01:52:11,090 --> 01:52:13,092
that really made me want to become a cop.

2174
01:52:13,426 --> 01:52:15,511
"Missing girl found at her apartment."

2175
01:52:15,678 --> 01:52:17,096
It's...

2176
01:52:17,263 --> 01:52:19,265
It's adrenalin-pinching.

2177
01:52:21,767 --> 01:52:23,227
It's nice to see you.

2178
01:52:27,273 --> 01:52:30,066
I'm glad that you got your taillights fixed.

2179
01:52:30,233 --> 01:52:32,152
Means I won't have to stop you again.

2180
01:52:37,073 --> 01:52:38,116
Okay.

2181
01:52:39,826 --> 01:52:41,453
Annie, let's go.

2182
01:52:43,455 --> 01:52:45,582
Anyway, go and save your friend from her apartment.

2183
01:52:46,207 --> 01:52:47,459
Bye-bye.

2184
01:52:47,626 --> 01:52:48,960
Bye.

2185
01:53:16,988 --> 01:53:19,658
Do you mind actually if I go by myself?

2186
01:53:21,284 --> 01:53:23,160
- Sure. - Okay.

2187
01:53:24,370 --> 01:53:25,996
Lil?

2188
01:53:27,164 --> 01:53:28,624
Lillian?

2189
01:53:30,416 --> 01:53:31,417
Lil?

2190
01:53:31,501 --> 01:53:32,502
Go away.

2191
01:53:41,469 --> 01:53:42,512
What happened?

2192
01:53:45,515 --> 01:53:48,684
This whole wedding is fucked up.

2193
01:53:49,017 --> 01:53:51,311
Helen just took over everything, and

2194
01:53:53,688 --> 01:53:55,272
everything's got out of control.

2195
01:53:55,356 --> 01:53:58,234
And my dad can't afford the wedding.

2196
01:53:59,193 --> 01:54:02,655
This has been really hard to do without you.

2197
01:54:03,739 --> 01:54:06,659
It's been shitty.

2198
01:54:08,868 --> 01:54:10,495
I'm sorry.

2199
01:54:11,496 --> 01:54:13,372
Nope. I'm sorry.

2200
01:54:13,872 --> 01:54:15,666
I'm sorry I kicked you out of my wedding.

2201
01:54:17,458 --> 01:54:18,542
It's my fault.

2202
01:54:18,625 --> 01:54:19,668
No, it's my fault.

2203
01:54:19,751 --> 01:54:22,671
I think I'm the one with the mental problems.

2204
01:54:22,879 --> 01:54:24,089
Yeah, wasn't it my turn to be crazy?

2205
01:54:24,214 --> 01:54:25,465
The bride's supposed to be crazy.

2206
01:54:25,549 --> 01:54:26,550
Yes, technically.

2207
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:29,553
You kind of stole all the crazy. I out-crazied you.

2208
01:54:31,805 --> 01:54:33,223
Everything's going to be okay.

2209
01:54:33,473 --> 01:54:35,684
Yeah? How do you know that?

2210
01:54:38,687 --> 01:54:41,231
I left the rehearsal dinner last night.

2211
01:54:41,398 --> 01:54:43,525
I told Dougie I had to go get Q-tips.

2212
01:54:43,692 --> 01:54:45,068
And...

2213
01:54:46,152 --> 01:54:49,280
all of a sudden, I realised I was driving here.

2214
01:54:49,363 --> 01:54:50,447
I came here.

2215
01:54:53,158 --> 01:54:57,328
I realised this is the last time I'm going to be here

2216
01:54:57,495 --> 01:54:59,205
in this apartment

2217
01:54:59,372 --> 01:55:00,623
with that couch,

2218
01:55:00,999 --> 01:55:02,250
and this bed,

2219
01:55:02,417 --> 01:55:04,335
and take a bath in my bathtub.

2220
01:55:04,502 --> 01:55:06,337
Because you know how much I love my bathtub.

2221
01:55:06,588 --> 01:55:07,547
It's a good tub.

2222
01:55:07,672 --> 01:55:10,300
- I slept in there on my 30th birthday, remember? - Uh-huh.

2223
01:55:11,384 --> 01:55:13,052
Everything's gonna change.

2224
01:55:14,596 --> 01:55:16,556
I mean, I'm not going to get to

2225
01:55:16,681 --> 01:55:18,600
live five minutes away from you.

2226
01:55:21,769 --> 01:55:23,395
And it makes me so sad.

2227
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:28,901
Well, don't be.

2228
01:55:29,526 --> 01:55:32,487
Don't be sad. Because things are going to change,

2229
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:36,032
but they'll be better.

2230
01:55:37,742 --> 01:55:38,950
You know?

2231
01:55:39,326 --> 01:55:42,913
You're gonna take this huge, great, beautiful step.

2232
01:55:43,914 --> 01:55:46,208
And Dougie loves you more than anything.

2233
01:55:47,375 --> 01:55:48,543
And so do I.

2234
01:55:52,672 --> 01:55:55,342
But what about you? What's gonna happen to you?

2235
01:56:01,139 --> 01:56:03,350
I'm gonna be fine.

2236
01:56:05,811 --> 01:56:08,522
So don't worry, okay? I'm gonna be...

2237
01:56:08,688 --> 01:56:10,315
I'm gonna be fine.

2238
01:56:10,649 --> 01:56:12,192
I am fine.

2239
01:56:15,821 --> 01:56:19,241
And besides, you need to blaze the trail for me.

2240
01:56:19,407 --> 01:56:22,327
And then report back and tell me what's coming.

2241
01:56:23,203 --> 01:56:25,372
Whatever you say, boss.

2242
01:56:27,833 --> 01:56:29,751
All right, let's get your dress on,

2243
01:56:29,876 --> 01:56:31,836
okay, and let's go to your wedding.

2244
01:56:33,504 --> 01:56:35,088
Oh, yeah.

2245
01:56:35,964 --> 01:56:37,340
That's the other problem.

2246
01:56:47,767 --> 01:56:51,855
Don't you dare laugh.

2247
01:56:59,778 --> 01:57:00,821
Okay.

2248
01:57:00,904 --> 01:57:03,115
I cannot wear this dress!

2249
01:57:03,365 --> 01:57:04,867
Okay, don't panic.

2250
01:57:06,034 --> 01:57:07,536
This is a nightmare.

2251
01:57:08,370 --> 01:57:09,913
We'll fix it.

2252
01:57:10,205 --> 01:57:11,748
We'll tweak it.

2253
01:57:12,416 --> 01:57:13,959
I will not let you walk down that aisle

2254
01:57:14,042 --> 01:57:15,918
unless you look perfect and beautiful, I promise.

2255
01:57:16,210 --> 01:57:19,379
Do you have a chainsaw and a blowtorch?

2256
01:57:22,172 --> 01:57:24,466
I think this wedding is gonna be a disaster.

2257
01:57:24,550 --> 01:57:25,634
No, don't say that.

2258
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:27,970
If Helen had anything to do with this wedding,

2259
01:57:28,053 --> 01:57:31,640
it is going to be perfect and tasteful and beautiful.

2260
01:57:31,724 --> 01:57:32,725
That's true.

2261
01:57:33,809 --> 01:57:36,562
Will you, Douglas, take Lillian to be your wife?

2262
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:39,731
Will you love her, comfort her, and keep her

2263
01:57:39,898 --> 01:57:42,817
and, forsaking all others, remain true to her

2264
01:57:42,901 --> 01:57:44,903
as long as you both shall live?

2265
01:57:44,986 --> 01:57:46,029
I do.

2266
01:57:46,362 --> 01:57:48,907
And will you, Lillian, take Douglas to be your husband?

2267
01:57:48,990 --> 01:57:51,326
Will you love him, comfort him, and keep him

2268
01:57:51,492 --> 01:57:52,784
as long as you both shall live?

2269
01:57:54,076 --> 01:57:55,411
I do.

2270
01:57:57,246 --> 01:57:59,415
By the powers vested in me by the state of Illinois,

2271
01:57:59,665 --> 01:58:01,417
I pronounce you husband and wife.

2272
01:58:01,667 --> 01:58:02,751
You may now kiss the bride.

2273
01:58:13,637 --> 01:58:15,180
Ladies and gentlemen,

2274
01:58:15,263 --> 01:58:19,684
here with us tonight is Lillian's favourite band singing her favourite song.

2275
01:58:19,851 --> 01:58:24,105
Put your hands together for Wilson Phillips!

2276
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:29,361
Hi, everybody!

2277
01:58:31,863 --> 01:58:33,114
How we doing tonight?

2278
01:58:33,657 --> 01:58:35,617
I am not paying for this shit.

2279
01:58:37,702 --> 01:58:38,954
Really?

2280
01:58:40,622 --> 01:58:41,998
It's the last one, I promise.

2281
01:58:42,082 --> 01:58:43,792

I put a loaded gun in Dougie's carry-on.

2315
02:00:43,076 --> 02:00:46,954
The TSA is going to just rip his ass apart.

2316
02:00:50,792 --> 02:00:51,793
Annie?

2317
02:00:53,461 --> 02:00:54,462
Hey.

2318
02:00:57,924 --> 02:00:59,884
Did you have a nice evening?

2319
02:01:00,051 --> 02:01:02,053
It was beautiful. Yeah.

2320
02:01:02,303 --> 02:01:04,430
What did you think of the wedding?

2321
02:01:05,389 --> 02:01:06,808
It was...

2322
02:01:06,933 --> 02:01:07,934
It was great.

2323
02:01:08,101 --> 02:01:09,227
- It was great, right? - Yeah.

2324
02:01:09,435 --> 02:01:10,603
It was perfect.

2325
02:01:11,270 --> 02:01:12,522
It was great.

2326
02:01:12,647 --> 02:01:13,939
Yeah, it was great.

2327
02:01:17,442 --> 02:01:19,402
It was really nice meeting you.

2328
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:21,988
Yeah, it was...

2329
02:01:22,155 --> 02:01:24,825
Helen, it was really nice meeting you, too.

2330
02:01:28,912 --> 02:01:30,539
Hey, you know, maybe

2331
02:01:30,622 --> 02:01:34,292
sometime the three of us could go to Rockin' Sushi together.

2332
02:01:36,086 --> 02:01:38,964
Thank you, Annie.

2333
02:01:39,131 --> 02:01:40,799
I would love that.

2334
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:49,140
Your ride is here.

2335
02:02:05,531 --> 02:02:07,491
Hey, how did everything go?

2336
02:02:09,702 --> 02:02:10,786
Strangely well.

2337
02:02:10,911 --> 02:02:11,995
Good.

2338
02:02:14,998 --> 02:02:16,624
So, I ate your cake...

2339
02:02:17,625 --> 02:02:19,043
that you left.

2340
02:02:19,169 --> 02:02:20,170
- You did? - Yeah.

2341
02:02:20,378 --> 02:02:21,588
I mean, I had to fight some raccoons off.

2342
02:02:22,630 --> 02:02:24,841
But that's okay. I'm pretty strong and tough,

2343
02:02:24,966 --> 02:02:27,177
so it wasn't much of a contest.

2344
02:02:27,343 --> 02:02:28,427
So that might have been...

2345
02:02:28,510 --> 02:02:29,845
I'm just going to kiss you now rather than just...

2346
02:02:42,858 --> 02:02:44,234
Officer Rhodes, please report to...

2347
02:02:44,318 --> 02:02:45,319
I'm on duty.

2348
02:02:46,153 --> 02:02:47,779
And I need to put my uniform on.

2349
02:02:47,863 --> 02:02:49,781
If I drive like this, they're gonna think I just stole a car,

2350
02:02:49,865 --> 02:02:51,033
which wouldn't be great.

2351
02:02:52,325 --> 02:02:54,702
You could ride with me... if you want.

2352
02:02:54,869 --> 02:02:56,829
- You want to come? - Yeah, I do.

2353
02:02:57,038 --> 02:02:58,080
Come on.

2354
02:02:58,164 --> 02:02:59,165
All right.

2355
02:02:59,332 --> 02:03:00,374
Whoa! Whoa! Where are you going?

2356
02:03:00,499 --> 02:03:01,542
I'm getting in the car.

2357
02:03:01,626 --> 02:03:03,294
- No, no, no, you got to get in the back. - What?

2358
02:03:03,461 --> 02:03:05,630
You can't sit in the front, it's against regulations.

2359
02:03:05,713 --> 02:03:07,798
Come on. Come on.

2360
02:03:07,965 --> 02:03:09,675
You're going to make me sit in the back seat?

2361
02:03:09,884 --> 02:03:11,135
Yeah, come on.

2362
02:03:11,219 --> 02:03:12,303
Sorry. Habit.

2363
02:03:12,637 --> 02:03:13,888
All right.

2364
02:03:14,013 --> 02:03:15,223
It's a force of habit.

2365
02:03:19,018 --> 02:03:20,394
Can I please get in the front seat?

2366
02:03:20,561 --> 02:03:23,564
Actually, no, I'm afraid there's a warrant out for your arrest.

2367
02:03:23,731 --> 02:03:25,399
What? Why?

2368
02:03:25,483 --> 02:03:28,152
Reckless driving, littering, texting,

2369
02:03:28,319 --> 02:03:30,238
consuming alcohol while operating a vehicle.

2370
02:03:30,404 --> 02:03:31,447
You didn't think I was going to

2371
02:03:31,530 --> 02:03:33,114
let you get away with that, did you?

2372
02:03:33,907 --> 02:03:36,159
Could we put the siren on? Please?

2373
02:03:38,662 --> 02:03:40,038
Thank you.

2397
02:04:38,965 --> 02:04:41,884
Yeah, that's a good-looking bear sandwich.

2398

Yeah, that's a big bear sandwich.
