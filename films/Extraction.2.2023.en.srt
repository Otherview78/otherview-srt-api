1
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,205
Mmm num ba de

2
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,332
Dum bum ba be

3
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:48,542
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

4
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:54,006
Pressure pushing down on me

5
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,219
Pressing down on you, no man ask for

6
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:02,640
Under pressure That burns a building down

7
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:05,434
Splits a family in two

8
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,894
Puts people on streets

9
00:03:06,977 --> 00:03:09,689
Um ba ba be

10
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,565
Um ba ba be

11
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,234
De day da

12
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:14,402
Ee day da

13
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,486
That's okay

14
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:19,824
It's the terror of knowing What this world is about

15
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:23,077
Watching some good friends screaming

16
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,624
“Let me out!"” Pray tomorrow gets me higher

17
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,545
Pressure on people, people on streets

18
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,553
Careful with this, it's highly toxic.

19
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:42,513
Come on, lads, keep it moving.

20
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:44,056
Keep it moving.

21
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,643
Go, go, go!

22
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,188
Is this double pay or what?

23
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,273
It's toxic waste.

24
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,740
What are you doing sitting there, mate?

25
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,824
Get amongst it.

26
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:04,243
I want this filth off my ship as fast as possible.

27
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:25,556
What you doing, then?

28
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,226
Naughty.

29
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,687
Help! Help!

30
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,148
Naughty.

31
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:35,357
Shh.

32
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,693
Keep your little beak shut.

33
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,154
-Not very nice. -Otherwise, you'll go for a swim.

34
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:41,739
Help! Help!

35
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:43,699
Help me! Help me!

36
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:45,576
Hey.

37
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,660
Uh, well done.

38
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:48,704
I'm here from the home office.

39
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,789
Bullshit.

40
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,458
Here checking on security protocols...

41
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:55,628
...and, um, taking a few pictures, SO smile.

42
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:58,923
What are you doing in here?

43
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:00,341
- Not very nice. - What's going on?

44
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:05,930
That's him!

45
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:06,889
I'll get you!

46
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,399
Hey, hey! Get at this!

47
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,751
Get him!

48
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:40,548
You two, go left! Cut him off!

49
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,466
I want him caught, dead or dead.

50
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:48,556
Not there! Go around! Go around!

51
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:52,935
There you go, mate. End of the line.

52
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,271
Okay.

53
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:57,314
You're all under arrest.

54
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:00,860
For the illegal dumping of radioactive materials.

55
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,821
Yeah, you, you, you, you and you.

56
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:07,241
What, me and... And him and him?

57
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:08,284
And him?

58
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:11,829
-Kill him. -Wait, wait, wait.

59
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:14,748
I know. You want to see the warrant.

60
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,041
It's right in my pocket.

61
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,545
I'll see you in court, yeah?

62
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,846
We're out of shipping lanes, and you're 200 miles from shore.

63
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:30,431
So enjoy your swim.

64
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,646
I've got him. Just off the port side.

65
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,109
He's like a green James Bond. I like it.

66
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,448
Oh, no, my hat!

67
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,658
Hello, suckers.

68
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,243
Looks like he's been making friends.

69
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,954
Wherever he goes, people just love him.

70
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,122
God knows why.

71
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,253
Have you got this?

72
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,839
We'll see.

73
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,718
Maybe this wasn't the best idea.

74
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:10,012
Maybe this isn't the best idea.

75
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,222
This is gonna be awesome.

76
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,390
Define "awesome."

77
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,642
I'm about to.

78
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,436
Opening hatch.

79
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:35,162
Next time, put a little more air in this thing.

80
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:36,747
It's like breathing through a straw.

81
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,748
Worked, didn't it?

82
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,333
You okay?

83
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,087
If you love your job, you'll never work a day in your life.

84
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:50,594
Okay, bring in Test 15.

85
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:53,013
Initiating suit power-up.

86
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:53,931
Clear.

87
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,977
Promising.

88
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:05,985
The exo suit is performing way beyond what we expected, Jiuming.

89
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,573
21% increase in power.

90
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,618
Not bad, huh?

91
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,703
So cool.

92
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,750
I can't wait to use these in the trench.

93
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:25,754
Hi.

94
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:37,224
-Maybe 25. Mm? -Okay.

95
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:39,560
I mean it, don't be late!

96
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:50,821
I cannot believe you got this far in life

97
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:52,072
without knowing how to tie a tie.

98
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,576
First, let's not overstate how far I've gotten in life.

99
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:58,287
Second, never involved wearing a monkey suit.

100
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,748
-Perfect. You look great. -Thanks.

101
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,292
Ah. Maybe this is the start of something.

102
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,835
Don't count on it.

103
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,299
Hi.

104
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,764
That guy look familiar to you?

105
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,723
No.

106
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:21,810
- I don't like him. - You don't like anyone.

107
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:23,520
I like you.

108
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,397
That's 'cause I save your life all the time...

109
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,775
I buy you beers and I back you up in bar fights.

110
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,860
It's 'cause you're a special guy.

111
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:31,737
You're both special.

112
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,697
-Wish me luck. -Good luck.

113
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,366
- Thanks for the money. - Ladies and gentlemen,

114
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,162
welcome to the 10th anniversary of the Oceanic Institute.

115
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:41,622
I'm Hilary Driscoll.

116
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:45,042
Thank you for coming tonight, and for joining me

117
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,420
in funding this incredible work.

118
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,090
Stop. Don't fidget.

119
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,343
Why exactly do I have to be up here anyway?

120
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:56,595
'Cause you're a team player.

121
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:58,764
Great.

122
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,851
Please give a warm welcome

123
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,603
to the director of the Institute.

124
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,356
Zhang Jiuming.

125
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:12,069
Thank you, Hilary.

126
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,570
Thanks to the generous donations from our supporters,

127
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:39,114
we have been able to create the technology

128
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,200
to pass through the thermocline,

129
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,660
a thermal layer of freezing cold water

130
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,705
that separates Haiqi's world from ours

131
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:50,959
and into a trench 6,000 meters below sea level.

132
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:55,130
Thanks to you, we have the ability to go further than ever before.

133
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:04,514
And thank you. Zhang Jiuming.

134
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,892
So, thank you all

135
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:11,772
for being part of protecting this incredible ecosystem.

136
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:14,316
Thank you for coming.

137
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:22,532
Who wants to get a selfie with the man

138
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,661
who fought a megalodon and lived to tell the tale?

139
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,789
We give you, ladies and gentlemen, Jonas Taylor.

140
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:30,874
There he is! There he is.

141
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,963
I know this was your idea.

142
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,798
I'm gonna kill you.

143
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:39,967
Smile and pretend you love it.

144
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,094
Go on, give him a hug. Give him a tickle.

145
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,471
Oh, he loves people.

146
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,527
I wanna go to Mana One with you.

147
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:00,737
I want to dive the trench.

148
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:02,990
No.

149
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,117
Sorry, Meiying.

150
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:06,827
Why not?

151
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,329
Mom was diving all the time at my age.

152
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,207
Not to 25,000 feet.

153
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,460
Saying it's too dangerous?

154
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:16,545
Too dangerous for you.

155
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,256
But not dangerous.

156
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:23,176
In psychology, they call that "cognitive dissonance."

157
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,971
In the real world, they call it "parenting."

158
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,142
You need to start taking me seriously as a scientist.

159
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:31,893
-You're 14. -Exactly.

160
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:36,690
I know every system on Mana One, every dive protocol,

161
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:38,483
and every animal we've seen down there.

162
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,071
Hey, look. You can come to Mana One.

163
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:45,615
To observe the dive.

164
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,077
And that's it.

165
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:51,997
Jiuming is swimming with the meg.

166
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,458
Uncle.

167
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,627
Haigi's vitals are elevated.

168
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,005
Be careful, she's definitely aware of you.

169
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,345
Why are you swimming with the meg, Jiuming?

170
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,388
I'm conducting an experiment.

171
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,807
Is the experiment "Do I taste good?"

172
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,604
It's okay.

173
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,398
I've been training Haiqi since she was a pup.

174
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,151
A meg is not trainable, Jiuming.

175
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:25,155
But if you wanna be eaten in front of your niece, go ahead.

176
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:27,908
Fifty bucks says this is gonna end badly.

177
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:29,326
I'll take that action.

178
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:31,203
I am all in for team shark.

179
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,955
What? You can't bet on a shark, man.

180
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,998
That's bad karma.

181
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,084
Come on, guys, focus. That's not cool.

182
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,293
Jiuming...

183
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:41,963
I'd like to respectfully suggest that this is truly a terrible idea.

184
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,174
Megs and humanity were never meant to mix.

185
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,677
Haiqi and I have a special bond.

186
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,679
Watch this.

187
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:54,559
One click to come. Two clicks to go.

188
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:27,467
Whoa, I think she's looking at us.

189
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,643
You see?

190
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:40,355
She's coming around. Heart rate is up.

191
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,775
Moving in fast.

192
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:48,989
Four hundred meters.

193
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,086
- Jiuming, she's not responding. - Come on, Haiqi.

194
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,379
Two hundred meters.

195
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,092
One hundred meters.

196
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,343
Jiuming, move.

197
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,345
It's too late. She's coming in too fast.

198
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,430
Fifty meters.

199
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,765
Pull the cord.

200
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,601
Twenty meters.

201
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:19,227
- Jiuming, get out of there! - Uncle, no!

202
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,360
Did it get him?

203
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,279
I don't know. I couldn't watch.

204
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:30,947
I don't see him.

205
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,534
I knew this was a bad idea.

206
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:48,798
Huh?

207
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,759
That was exciting, huh?

208
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,055
I can't figure out what's wrong with her.

209
00:16:55,138 --> 00:16:57,349
She's been acting strangely all week.

210
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,351
You can clickety-click all you want.

211
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:01,895
The problem is, that it's a meg.

212
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:03,188
And you're a snack.

213
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:04,689
Yeah.

214
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,400
For the record, you scared the hell out of Meiying.

215
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:10,654
You're one to talk. What were you doing on that ship?

216
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,282
Actually, don't tell me. I don't wanna know.

217
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,328
Well, the Institute's mandate is to protect the oceans, right?

218
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,082
We can't be a part of any illegal activity.

219
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:23,917
Oh, I abhor lawlessness.

220
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,960
Oh, good.

221
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:27,504
Especially the illegal dumping of radioactive waste.

222
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:32,717
You're taking bigger and bigger risks each time you go out.

223
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,678
Well, I guess we both know about that.

224
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,806
It's not the same.

225
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:40,892
With me, there's a calculation of risks.

226
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:44,229
Not that I see.

227
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,578
Do you miss your mom, big fish?

228
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:03,456
Dr. Howard.

229
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,959
Are you ready for Mana One?

230
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:15,969
Say.

231
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,806
What?

232
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,175
Ground crew, we're approaching Mana One.

233
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:39,302
Hey, Rigas. Good to have you back.

234
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,137
I missed you guys.

235
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,389
Are you ready to do some diving?

236
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:44,432
You know it.

237
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,081
Morning, everyone. Let's get this show underwater.

238
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,917
Dive 1 and Dive 2, descend to 25,000 feet.

239
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,794
We're exploring Area 19.

240
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,088
Collecting rock samples and logging any new species.

241
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,424
Diving in T-minus 20 minutes.

242
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:03,219
All eyes open for a straightforward sweep and scan. The usual.

243
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,305
Yeah. There's no usual down there.

244
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:06,765
System's up.

245
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:12,395
What's with all these toys you have hanging around your console, Lance?

246
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,690
They're not toys, they're figurines.

247
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,151
They are definitely toys, Lance.

248
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:19,235
Thank you.

249
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,410
Ready for the drop, guys?

250
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,978
So, are you and Sal, like, Comic-Con guys or what?

251
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,022
Uh...

252
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:57,482
Absolutely right, yeah.

253
00:21:57,565 --> 00:21:59,692
Do you, um, dress up?

254
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,486
Uh, yeah.

255
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:04,405
Don't get him started, unless you want to see a million photographs.

256
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,574
Oh, yes, please.

257
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,159
Stay focused, guys.

258
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,455
Passing 17,000...

259
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,165
Telemetry's good.

260
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:19,420
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

261
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:27,053
Passing 18,000 feet.

262
00:22:27,136 --> 00:22:28,763
All systems nominal.

263
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,350
Looking good, team. Let's pull up the grids we're gonna map today.

264
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:33,434
Area 19.

265
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,728
When are we going to look at something different?

266
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,689
Yeah, there's like 100 more sectors to explore.

267
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:40,275
Jonas, can you confirm O2 levels?

268
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:43,361
Consumption is 11% over mission spec.

269
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:45,822
Guess Rigas is nervous.

270
00:22:45,905 --> 00:22:47,615
More like you're a mouth breather.

271
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,992
He totally is.

272
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:50,410
Can feel the breeze from over here.

273
00:22:50,493 --> 00:22:51,327
Yeah.

274
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:54,539
Firstly, it's called a deviated septum.

275
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:57,584
Second, I distinctly remember deviating it

276
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,918
while saving your ungrateful ass

277
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,754
from a 70-foot megalodon.

278
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,464
Passing 20,000 feet.

279
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,133
Approaching the thermocline.

280
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,305
Checking O2 lines and tank pressure.

281
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,264
If there was a leak,

282
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:12,765
there would be a fluctuation on the readings.

283
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,892
I'm not seeing anything here.

284
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,519
Check the pressure on the auxiliary O2 tanks.

285
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,896
Okay, I'll check.

286
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,273
That's not the problem.

287
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,483
Uh, Jonas?

288
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:25,653
Meiying?

289
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,865
You gotta be kidding me.

290
00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:33,578
I see that you're angry.

291
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:37,206
But I believe that this is a reasonable and responsible decision.

292
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,124
Stop the dive.

293
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,169
Full stop.

294
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:43,588
But before you start yelling, can I just say...

295
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,050
I did all kinds of stupid things when I was 14.

296
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,010
And look how I turned out.

297
00:23:49,844 --> 00:23:50,762
We're surfacing.

298
00:23:50,845 --> 00:23:52,430
But I don't see what the problem is.

299
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:55,183
This is your 26th trench dive without incident.

300
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:57,018
Subs have electric predator countermeasures,

301
00:23:57,101 --> 00:23:58,311
and emergency dive suits.

302
00:23:58,394 --> 00:23:59,395
Which you don't have.

303
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,730
Actually...

304
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,234
I packed one while you were doing the pre-dive meeting.

305
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,444
You know,

306
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:11,574
now's maybe a good time to sit down and be quiet for a minute.

307
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,576
I can do a seatbelt by myself, you know.

308
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,494
I know you can.

309
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:15,578
Jonas.

310
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:17,789
It's not your call, Jiuming.

311
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:18,998
We've got company.

312
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,751
Guys, it's a meg.

313
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,628
Approaching fast.

314
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:26,339
That's not possible, they can't go through the thermocline.

315
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:29,092
It's not coming from the thermocline. I'm tracking it from the shore.

316
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,428
Dive! Flank speed!

317
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,681
Engaging. Rerouting battery array.

318
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,933
Hold on.

319
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,812
Charging the predator countermeasures.

320
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:42,271
We'll be dead before they're online.

321
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,565
Thermocline's our only hope.

322
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:46,567
I'm reading Haiqi's tracker.

323
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:50,363
Impossible.

324
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:52,198
Well, impossible just got possible.

325
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:53,700
Five hundred meters to the thermocline.

326
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,784
Haiqi's closing fast.

327
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:56,786
One hundred meters.

328
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:57,870
She's right above us.

329
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:01,374
Come on, come on!

330
00:25:01,457 --> 00:25:03,001
Entering the thermocline.

331
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,003
Dive 1, Dive 2.

332
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,629
Switch to low-frequency light,

333
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,464
you don't want to attract any more megs.

334
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,967
I've lost her. She can't follow us through.

335
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,051
Can she?

336
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,094
Going dark.

337
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:16,139
I've never crossed the thermocline at 60 knots.

338
00:25:18,474 --> 00:25:20,518
Careful, you don't want to burn out the engines.

339
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:23,104
Don't worry, I'm not gonna break the pretty toys.

340
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:33,364
Yes.

341
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:38,661
She's still on us.

342
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:39,579
Thirty seconds...

343
00:25:39,662 --> 00:25:40,997
For the countermeasures.

344
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,040
Evasive.

345
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,374
She must have followed our heat signature.

346
00:26:03,644 --> 00:26:05,563
How did your pet shark get down here, Jiuming?

347
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,733
She must have escaped. How did that happen?

348
00:26:08,816 --> 00:26:10,777
Predator countermeasures active.

349
00:26:12,528 --> 00:26:14,113
Proximity alert.

350
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,198
Megs.

351
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:19,285
No way.

352
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:32,298
That's the biggest meg I've ever seen.

353
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,802
Biggest meg anyone's ever seen.

354
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,513
That's gotta be the apex predator.

355
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:45,103
Incredible. Megs are solitary.

356
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,813
It's like they're being called.

357
00:26:48,564 --> 00:26:51,818
I'm changing the dive plan. We have to see what they're up to.

358
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,528
And what about Meiying?

359
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,655
Well, I vote we go.

360
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,698
I wasn't asking you.

361
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,493
Oxygen reserves are at maximum.

362
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:02,912
Predator countermeasures are deployed.

363
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:05,498
Right now we are perfectly safe.

364
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:06,958
Right now, yeah.

365
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:11,170
If I see anything dangerous, I'm pulling the plug.

366
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,673
Mac, we're changing the mission profile.

367
00:27:13,756 --> 00:27:15,800
Proceeding on heading 227.

368
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,719
Now they're already off mission. They need to stay on course.

369
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,055
Jonas, you're going way outside the sector we have already mapped.

370
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,765
This is an exploration mission.

371
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,642
Let's explore.

372
00:27:25,768 --> 00:27:26,644
Copy that.

373
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:28,062
Eyes open, watch your backs.

374
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,564
Really, Mac?

375
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:33,109
We're gonna follow some giant sharks to a unknown sector?

376
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,236
Man...

377
00:27:35,903 --> 00:27:37,905
This some dumb-ass shit, mark my words.

378
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,662
Entering Sector 21.

379
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,681
Commencing geographical scan.

380
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:06,726
It's so beautiful.

381
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,938
Your mom loved this place more than anything.

382
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,275
I'm glad I finally get to see it.

383
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:17,820
Don't get used to it.

384
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,323
You're grounded for the rest of your life.

385
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,242
I love you, too.

386
00:28:25,244 --> 00:28:27,288
Haiqi 400 meters ahead and holding.

387
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,498
Where are we going now?

388
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,833
/Into the unknown.

389
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,127
That's what we came for.

390
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:35,838
I've got Haiqi's tracker ahead.

391
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,465
Looks like she's circling.

392
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,645
Look up.

393
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,397
It's some instinctual gathering.

394
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,732
Incredible.

395
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:57,443
They're here to mate.

396
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:01,197
This is why Haiqi has been acting strangely.

397
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,824
Oh, great. More megs.

398
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,583
The scanner's detecting an abnormal structure.

399
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:21,801
No way.

400
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:24,053
Is that a wreck?

401
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,308
It's some kind of sea floor station.

402
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,143
What could they be doing down here?

403
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,857
Rigas, run all spectrums.

404
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,570
No, that's no wreck. I'm getting heat signatures off it.

405
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:43,906
Just can't see what's inside.

406
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,492
Multiple airlocks, power generation.

407
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:48,661
The resources needed is staggering.

408
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,082
Who would even have that technology?

409
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:56,961
Sonar says there's something above us.

410
00:29:57,044 --> 00:29:59,255
It looks like a submarine.

411
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:00,798
Let's take a look.

412
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:03,926
Charges set. Priming zone for detonation.

413
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,637
Come on. We need to blow this ridge.

414
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,180
Yeah, okay, okay.

415
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,141
We don't wanna be down here any longer than needs be.

416
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:16,188
Yeah, well, this is the only place to mine this stuff.

417
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:19,442
Slow and steady.

418
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,278
Hey, Montes. Why do you get to stay in the submarine?

419
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:26,115
It's good to be the king.

420
00:30:26,198 --> 00:30:27,783
Incoming object detected.

421
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:32,288
Zoom in 400%.

422
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,759
Mana One crew is below us.

423
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,471
There's no way they haven't seen the station.

424
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:50,431
What are we gonna do?

425
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:52,266
I'm arming the explosives right now.

426
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,977
- You have to get out. - What? Wait.

427
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,228
No, you can't do that.

428
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,105
There isn't time. You know there isn't time.

429
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,774
It will take ten minutes to get clear.

430
00:31:01,108 --> 00:31:01,942
Montes!

431
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:12,078
- Sorry, guys. - Montes! Montes, don't do it!

432
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:16,791
What was that?

433
00:31:19,293 --> 00:31:20,586
Landslide!

434
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:22,838
I can't get ahead of it. I'm gonna have to go through.

435
00:31:57,456 --> 00:31:58,874
Guys? What's happening?

436
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,626
I'm reading a thermocline breach.

437
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:02,837
Something's ripped a giant hole in it.

438
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,142
Rerouting the thrusters. This is all we've got.

439
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:23,357
Vertical control is down.

440
00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:25,734
Hydraulics are non-responsive.

441
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,781
We're pinned.

442
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,576
Coming in.

443
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,496
- Hold us steady. - Yeah.

444
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:43,294
Jiuming. Sixty degrees down.

445
00:32:43,377 --> 00:32:44,753
Two feet forward.

446
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,258
Jiuming!

447
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,727
Go, go, go!

448
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:02,521
Full thrust! Full thrust!

449
00:33:14,074 --> 00:33:14,950
Jiuming!

450
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,870
No!

451
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,216
There's no telemetry.

452
00:33:32,384 --> 00:33:33,511
Dive 1,

453
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,887
Dive 2. Do you copy?

454
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,182
Dive 1, Dive 2. Do you copy?

455
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:41,852
We've got nothing here.

456
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:43,521
Keep trying, DJ.

457
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,273
Jess, prep the rescue sub. Stat.

458
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,651
-Ugh, what happened? -I don't know.

459
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,029
How do we know if they're still alive?

460
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,822
Prep the rescue vehicle.

461
00:33:56,408 --> 00:33:57,243
Dive 1,

462
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,828
Dive 2. Do you copy?

463
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,163
Come on, Jonas.

464
00:34:03,582 --> 00:34:04,833
Meiying.

465
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,128
Meiying.

466
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:11,674
- Meiying. - What happened?

467
00:34:12,883 --> 00:34:13,926
Took a nasty hit.

468
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:16,929
Uncle Jiuming?

469
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:19,515
Where's Uncle Jiuming?

470
00:34:19,598 --> 00:34:20,683
-Where is he? -We can't raise him.

471
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,895
Hey. We work the problems one by one.

472
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,441
We do what's in front of us, and then we do the next thing.

473
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:31,860
We're gonna be okay.

474
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,405
Mac!

475
00:34:35,197 --> 00:34:36,740
The rescue sub isn't working.

476
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:41,245
The battery array was deliberately shorted out. It looks like sabotage.

477
00:34:41,328 --> 00:34:42,246
How's that possible?

478
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:45,082
This isn't a secure area, there are 30 people who work here.

479
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:46,125
Well, how long to fix it?

480
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:49,128
It's the control boards, Mac. There is no fixing it.

481
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:55,342
- Try it now. - What's our status?

482
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,385
No comms, no heat.

483
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:58,846
We're losing air fast.

484
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:01,974
- This isn't working. - Flood in my extra O2.

485
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,518
Already done.

486
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,812
Yeah, I have got one last idea.

487
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:08,772
Route the power through the heating cell.

488
00:35:15,237 --> 00:35:16,530
I got Dive 1. Mac.

489
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,948
- I got Dive 1. -Jonas?

490
00:35:19,241 --> 00:35:20,826
Good to hear your voice, Mac.

491
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:22,870
Not as good as it is to hear yours, brother.

492
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,288
Talk to me.

493
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,956
It ain't good.

494
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,667
Almost every system is down and we're losing air fast.

495
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,797
We'll get into the emergency dive suits, and we're gonna need a ride up.

496
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,008
Jonas...

497
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:38,177
it's not gonna be possible.

498
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,138
What are you talking about?

499
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:42,598
The battery array.

500
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:45,017
It shorted out the control board in the rescue sub.

501
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,560
We're investigating it now.

502
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,023
Jonas?

503
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,442
Jonas, can you hear me?

504
00:35:55,277 --> 00:35:56,904
Jonas, we can't get to you.

505
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,742
We're gonna walk.

506
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,955
We're gonna walk back across the trench. Make it into that sea floor station.

507
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,626
And we're gonna get inside. And then we're gonna get to the surface.

508
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:13,170
Those suits have two hours of air tops.

509
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:15,673
They're only designed for brief extravehicular work.

510
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,008
We'll go slow and steady. They'll hold.

511
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,301
It's three kilometers.

512
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:21,261
You'll be defenseless out there.

513
00:36:21,845 --> 00:36:23,180
What do you want from me, Mac?

514
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,766
This is what we got, and this is what we're gonna do.

515
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,104
Half our team is dead...

516
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,064
and I'm not losing the other half.

517
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,697
Beginning suit initialization.

518
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,658
Joint actuators functioning.

519
00:36:42,741 --> 00:36:45,536
Ultrasonic signal communications online.

520
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:47,955
Initialization complete.

521
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,710
Abandoning Dive 1, Mac.

522
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:56,964
The radios won't relay to the surface, so we're going dark.

523
00:36:57,631 --> 00:36:58,966
Talk to you on the other side.

524
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,634
Godspeed, Jonas.

525
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,518
Emergency escape initiated.

526
00:37:55,063 --> 00:37:56,148
Hey. Whoa.

527
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,901
Almost killed you.

528
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:00,986
The hell are you doing?

529
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:02,821
Saving your ass.

530
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,448
And walking back to that station.

531
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:07,326
What are you doing?

532
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:11,205
Saving your ass. And walking back to that station.

533
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,208
-Don't have much time. -Let's get going.

534
00:38:16,418 --> 00:38:17,419
-Jiu. -Oh!

535
00:38:25,427 --> 00:38:26,303
Hey.

536
00:38:26,386 --> 00:38:28,639
Hey. Let me check.

537
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:29,681
Air left...

538
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,142
Hey, you need to calm down or you're gonna run out of oxygen, Lance.

539
00:38:33,101 --> 00:38:34,311
I don't think I can.

540
00:38:34,394 --> 00:38:36,104
Think of it as cosplay.

541
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:39,691
Or we could be paintballing.

542
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,568
Like the ultimate team-building exercise.

543
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,695
We need to cover distance while the megs are still occupied.

544
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,239
Three kilometers to destination.

545
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:47,533
Away from the megs is fine by me.

546
00:38:48,116 --> 00:38:50,869
We're a strong group. We can do this.

547
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:54,665
Amazing.

548
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,334
Lighting courtesy of Mother Nature.

549
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,380
It's incredible, there are new species all around us.

550
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,174
Hey. Look.

551
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,051
Look at this. It's beautiful.

552
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:11,306
Hello, my little biolum...

553
00:39:13,725 --> 00:39:15,561
There's a snake! There's a snake!

554
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,437
Get this monster off my head!

555
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,528
No touching stuff.

556
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:25,821
He started it.

557
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:32,035
Everyone clear the station. DJ, what's our time on Jonas?

558
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,954
Forty-one minutes since they went dark.

559
00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:35,247
At best, it'll take another hour

560
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,206
for them to cover the distance.

561
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,666
Listen up.

562
00:39:37,749 --> 00:39:40,252
We know there's some kind of rogue operation in the trench.

563
00:39:40,335 --> 00:39:42,504
Now some bastard's got his fingers in our operation here.

564
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:46,800
That sub was definitely sabotaged, so we've got a mole on the station.

565
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,094
DJ, I want you to pull all surveillance footage

566
00:39:49,177 --> 00:39:51,680
from the sub bay for the last 24 hours.

567
00:39:51,763 --> 00:39:53,348
Jess, run the personnel files on the crew,

568
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,725
look for anything suspect.

569
00:39:55,517 --> 00:39:57,936
We're gonna get these sons of bitches, but we have to watch our own backs.

570
00:39:58,645 --> 00:40:01,523
One of us mans the DCC at all times, understood?

571
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,858
Yes.

572
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,572
Is it just me,

573
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,241
or does walking three kilometers underwater

574
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,492
sound like hard work?

575
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,953
It certainly wasn't on my to-do list.

576
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,875
Baby octopi.

577
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:23,211
So many colors, it's incredible.

578
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,508
Anybody wanna play a game?

579
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,469
- A game? - This isn't a game.

580
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,013
She means to keep our minds occupied.

581
00:40:33,805 --> 00:40:36,391
Right now, my mind is pretty damn occupied.

582
00:40:57,412 --> 00:40:59,998
There's a, there's a, it's...

583
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,667
Lance?

584
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,751
What was it?

585
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:05,629
- I didn't see. - Where's Lance?

586
00:41:05,712 --> 00:41:06,713
Is it a meg?

587
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:11,426
Something's happened to him, I know it.

588
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,386
Lance?

589
00:41:16,264 --> 00:41:18,392
No. Oh, no.

590
00:41:19,184 --> 00:41:20,310
We have to keep moving.

591
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,562
No, we can't just leave him out there.

592
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,648
We need to find him! Please!

593
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:26,149
-Jiuming. -I'm sorry.

594
00:41:27,442 --> 00:41:28,443
He's gone.

595
00:41:30,737 --> 00:41:33,907
Rigas, cover our six. Shoot anything that moves.

596
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,786
You bet your ass I will.

597
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,679
Comms online.

598
00:41:59,057 --> 00:42:00,475
What happened to you?

599
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,062
The Mana One crew stumbled upon our station.

600
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,897
I took them out with a landslide.

601
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,442
Okay, this is out of control.

602
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,610
You authorized me to do

603
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,821
whatever's necessary to protect our operation.

604
00:42:12,904 --> 00:42:14,781
No.

605
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:19,786
They are not dead. They are walking right now

606
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,871
to the station.

607
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:22,497
If they get there,

608
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,666
we are screwed.

609
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,714
There's still a kilometer to go, straight through that valley,

610
00:42:30,797 --> 00:42:32,758
and we don't have the bioluminescence to cover us.

611
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,718
We're going to be totally exposed out there.

612
00:42:34,801 --> 00:42:35,635
We don't have a choice.

613
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,138
We only have enough air to go straight through.

614
00:42:39,264 --> 00:42:42,017
Let's keep our lights on low spectrum.

615
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:44,936
Yeah, we don't want to attract the megs.

616
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,730
One kilometer to destination.

617
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:50,525
- 02 check? - 65%.

618
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:51,985
50.

619
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,653
26%.

620
00:42:54,279 --> 00:42:55,739
It's not gonna be enough.

621
00:42:55,822 --> 00:42:57,324
Look at me. Look at me.

622
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,326
Look at me, okay? Focus, okay?

623
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:02,037
You can do this. Remember the training.

624
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,415
Anything on sonar?

625
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,918
I got something, right at the edge of my range.

626
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,170
Keeps going in and out.

627
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,008
Stalking us.

628
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,935
Proximity alert.

629
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,105
What is it?

630
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,654
It's just a shoal of fish.

631
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,073
Stay calm, everyone.

632
00:43:38,573 --> 00:43:40,367
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

633
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:41,326
Keep moving.

634
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:45,497
Ayo, Mac.

635
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,542
We got jack on the security footage. Somebody deleted it.

636
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,877
-For the sub bay? -For the whole damn station.

637
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,130
They're good, but they don't know everything.

638
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,340
There's a satellite uplink with an encrypted backup.

639
00:43:55,423 --> 00:43:58,093
I'm gonna go to the server room, see if I can pull it down.

640
00:43:58,176 --> 00:43:59,177
Time?

641
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,054
One hour, 50. They'll be out of air soon.

642
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,889
I'm scanning all channels, but nothing yet.

643
00:44:08,353 --> 00:44:11,231
That's it. Maybe 400 meters.

644
00:44:16,778 --> 00:44:19,156
Warning. Entering oxygen reserves.

645
00:44:19,364 --> 00:44:20,365
You can do this.

646
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,409
- Yeah? - Yeah.

647
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,786
I'm getting a reading.

648
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,496
Many contacts to our right.

649
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:28,999
Coming in fast.

650
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:32,919
What, megs?

651
00:44:33,628 --> 00:44:36,840
No. Smaller. Faster.

652
00:44:40,343 --> 00:44:43,096
Everybody make it to the station! Go, move!

653
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,806
Warning. Oxygen level low.

654
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,057
- Come on. - I'm out of air.

655
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:49,019
They're coming over the ridge!

656
00:44:53,481 --> 00:44:54,733
What are those things?

657
00:44:54,816 --> 00:44:56,026
It's too far.

658
00:44:56,109 --> 00:44:57,736
We need to make a stand!

659
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,487
Turn and fight!

660
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,378
Come on! Get off!

661
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,925
Meiying!

662
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,468
Help! Shoot their head!

663
00:45:21,551 --> 00:45:22,886
-Meiying! -Uncle!

664
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:27,182
I've got you!

665
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,935
They're biting through the suit.

666
00:45:33,146 --> 00:45:34,439
Meiying!

667
00:45:44,282 --> 00:45:46,243
-No. No. -Hold on, Curtis!

668
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:48,995
Too many! We don't have a chance!

669
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:09,057
Everybody stay back!

670
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,143
Keep going!

671
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:20,944
Jiuming!

672
00:46:21,027 --> 00:46:22,320
There's no choice.

673
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,365
You really wanna die, don't you?

674
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,100
Gotta make it to the airlock!

675
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,614
Warning. Low air.

676
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,867
-It's no use. I'm holding you back. -Low air.

677
00:47:12,662 --> 00:47:14,331
It's not too far.

678
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:15,665
You can make it!

679
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,709
Warning. Low air.

680
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:21,504
Warning. Low air.

681
00:47:22,922 --> 00:47:24,632
Air depleted.

682
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:35,894
Uncle!

683
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,021
Visor failure imminent.

684
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:40,690
Jiuming!

685
00:47:47,238 --> 00:47:49,783
Okay. We gotta go. We don't have a choice.

686
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,451
He's coming back around!

687
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:53,411
- Oh, God! - Go, go, go!

688
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,582
We have to do the override.

689
00:47:59,584 --> 00:48:01,836
Come on, hurry up.

690
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,046
Rigas, come on!

691
00:48:04,672 --> 00:48:05,840
You can do it. Get in!

692
00:48:08,134 --> 00:48:09,969
Shut the door!

693
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:11,971
Curtis, you'll be okay.

694
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,223
Suit implosion imminent.

695
00:48:13,306 --> 00:48:14,849
- Almost there. Almost there! - Oh, my God.

696
00:48:17,977 --> 00:48:19,104
It's gonna implode.

697
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,397
Depressurize the room!

698
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,273
No, no, no.

699
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,733
- Implosion imminent. - No!

700
00:49:06,067 --> 00:49:07,444
Son of a bitch!

701
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,612
I hate these things!

702
00:49:11,197 --> 00:49:12,198
Hey, Rigas.

703
00:49:12,907 --> 00:49:14,367
Let's try to keep it together.

704
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:17,745
We ain't out of the woods yet.

705
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,941
Rigas.

706
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,622
Where is everybody?

707
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:17,972
What is that smell?

708
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,850
Divers.

709
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,693
Nobody home.

710
00:50:31,986 --> 00:50:33,154
I'll cover the door.

711
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,828
Whoever's running this...

712
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,540
is not our friend.

713
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,251
We need to contact Mana One ASAP. Think you can handle it?

714
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,502
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

715
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,549
What is this that they're mining?

716
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,843
Whatever it is, they're sending it up to the surface

717
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:56,970
with these pods.

718
00:51:03,601 --> 00:51:05,395
Mm. Rare earth metals.

719
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,857
They're used in superconductors, aerospace and quantum computing.

720
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:14,320
This box alone could be a billion dollars.

721
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,990
"Billion" with a "B"?

722
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,199
Yes.

723
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,534
Mana One.

724
00:51:19,617 --> 00:51:21,244
Jonas. Comms are live.

725
00:51:26,165 --> 00:51:27,333
Come in.

726
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,378
-It's Jonas. Getting this? -Hey, you're alive.

727
00:51:30,461 --> 00:51:31,754
What's your status?

728
00:51:32,922 --> 00:51:35,091
We lost Lance, Sal, and Curtis.

729
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,552
We're at the station.

730
00:51:38,052 --> 00:51:39,887
It's a rogue mining operation.

731
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,681
Is there anyone down there?

732
00:51:41,764 --> 00:51:43,182
Not that we've seen so far.

733
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:46,769
They've infiltrated Mana One. The rescue sub was sabotaged.

734
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,813
-By who? -We're working on it.

735
00:51:48,896 --> 00:51:50,440
But check this out.

736
00:51:50,523 --> 00:51:53,443
I was going over the video of when you went over that station before.

737
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:55,737
Look at the north side.

738
00:51:58,823 --> 00:52:00,700
Looks like emergency escape pods.

739
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,661
It's the opposite side from where we are.

740
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:22,055
- Feels dead in here. - Stay close.

741
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,768
These are my designs.

742
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,562
How do they have this?

743
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:42,909
Looks like this is it.

744
00:52:54,295 --> 00:52:55,129
On three.

745
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,173
Three.

746
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,845
- Again. - It's not gonna work.

747
00:53:14,273 --> 00:53:15,316
After you.

748
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,821
Ah, this is more like it.

749
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,865
Let's crack open a pod and get out of here.

750
00:53:25,284 --> 00:53:26,119
Nothing here.

751
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,454
These controls ain't working.

752
00:53:28,996 --> 00:53:30,289
We need to close the hatch.

753
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,207
On it.

754
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:38,089
Guys, that wasn't me.

755
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:42,927
Jonas, now that I have you here,

756
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,262
we need lo talk candidly.

757
00:53:44,762 --> 00:53:47,265
I have full control of the station and I've locked down this room.

758
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:50,393
-Jess? -Your life is in my hands.

759
00:53:50,476 --> 00:53:51,728
What are you doing, Jess?

760
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,440
These are your friends.

761
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,109
They've been with you for years.

762
00:53:58,192 --> 00:54:00,611
I know it hurts. And we're talking

763
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,822
because I'd prefer we were on the same side.

764
00:54:02,905 --> 00:54:05,283
All making so much money, it ceases to have meaning.

765
00:54:05,366 --> 00:54:06,659
You're offering us money?

766
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,664
Three of our friends are dead because of you.

767
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,166
You think I'm gonna forget about that?

768
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,505
No, no, no! That's the first escape pod!

769
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:21,340
Son of a bitch!

770
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:25,094
Rigas? Rigas, you can save Meiying.

771
00:54:25,678 --> 00:54:28,306
Take that speargun and shoot Jonas in the heart.

772
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,329
Don't shoot him.

773
00:55:04,717 --> 00:55:05,635
Do it.

774
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,553
Go ahead.

775
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,557
It's the only way Meiying survives.

776
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:17,021
Do it.

777
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,149
Rigas!

778
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:22,610
Do it!

779
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,032
-Do it! -No. I'm sorry.

780
00:55:28,115 --> 00:55:30,952
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't, I can't, I can't.

781
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,795
That was the last pod.

782
00:55:43,464 --> 00:55:44,715
I told you that wouldn't work.

783
00:55:45,716 --> 00:55:46,592
Put me on.

784
00:55:49,428 --> 00:55:51,556
Sorry it had to come to this.

785
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:53,975
So...

786
00:55:54,058 --> 00:55:55,852
we'll be back at work in a week

787
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:59,730
using your technology to take whatever we want.

788
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:03,276
Your institute'll be a platform that we use

789
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,821
to plunder the ocean for decades.

790
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:10,533
And before you start whining about the ecosystem...

791
00:56:10,616 --> 00:56:12,994
Who cares? We'll make billions.

792
00:56:13,077 --> 00:56:15,371
And no one is going to see the damage we do.

793
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:21,252
Jess, I've already dispatched a clean-up crew to Mana One.

794
00:56:22,503 --> 00:56:23,504
Finish this.

795
00:56:28,175 --> 00:56:29,468
How do we open the door?

796
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,014
If we could cut the comm link to the surface...

797
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,266
she couldn't control anything.

798
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:36,809
But it's back in the first room

799
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,477
and there's no getting through this door.

800
00:56:39,186 --> 00:56:40,438
This airlock still works!

801
00:56:41,105 --> 00:56:42,940
Why would you go through the airlock? There's no pod.

802
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,359
I'll swim to the airlock where we came in

803
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,861
and do the override.

804
00:56:46,944 --> 00:56:49,155
You have no suit. How could it work?

805
00:56:50,114 --> 00:56:51,991
Water doesn't compress under pressure,

806
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:54,076
so if he can force water in his sinus cavities,

807
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,122
he could survive 30, maybe 60 seconds before he passes out.

808
00:56:58,205 --> 00:56:59,290
It is possible.

809
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,628
We work the problems one by one.

810
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:08,257
We do what's in front of us, then we do the next thing.

811
00:57:16,557 --> 00:57:19,685
If anyone can do this, it's you.

812
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,205
Won't he be crushed by the pressure?

813
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,791
It doesn't work like that.

814
00:57:41,874 --> 00:57:44,418
You don't see fish wearing metal suits, do you?

815
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:48,589
It's about air. It reacts under pressure.

816
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:51,217
And that's why he has to blow it out of his sinuses.

817
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,528
Hey there, tree hugger.

818
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,827
Jonas Taylor, eco-warrior,

819
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,412
fighting the good fight.

820
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,915
Well, guess what? You lost.

821
00:59:09,962 --> 00:59:13,049
I spent two years in a Manila prison

822
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:18,554
after you and your eco-freak buddies had our ship seized.

823
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,973
I thought about you every single day.

824
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:25,603
You don't even remember me, do you?

825
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:27,813
Hmm?

826
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:28,731
No?

827
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:30,149
Montes.

828
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:34,361
There's a million scumbags in this world.

829
00:59:37,406 --> 00:59:39,158
It's hard to keep track of all of 'em.

830
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:49,163
Meiying!

831
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,081
Meiying!

832
01:02:10,267 --> 01:02:12,228
Clean up crew approaching Mana One.

833
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:14,438
About time. We are on alert.

834
01:02:14,521 --> 01:02:16,899
Everyone confined to their quarters.

835
01:02:17,274 --> 01:02:21,362
We need to get control of Mana One and dispose of any liabilities.

836
01:02:26,575 --> 01:02:27,493
What's the emergency?

837
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,911
I got into the security backup.

838
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:30,704
Look at this.

839
01:02:32,706 --> 01:02:34,333
Jess disabled the rescue sub.

840
01:02:35,709 --> 01:02:37,503
-What? -Watch.

841
01:02:38,003 --> 01:02:40,798
Like she could be repairing it, right? But no, wait.

842
01:02:45,302 --> 01:02:46,553
It's Montes' sub.

843
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,222
That's our ride out of here.

844
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,564
There's a leak in the hydraulics.

845
01:02:57,731 --> 01:02:59,316
Predator countermeasures are down.

846
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,527
We'll never make it past the megs.

847
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:02,611
We need a distraction.

848
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,573
Light up the station. The megs will attack it.

849
01:03:06,865 --> 01:03:08,242
Yeah. And kill us.

850
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:10,494
Not if we're fast enough.

851
01:03:10,911 --> 01:03:11,787
Jiuming!

852
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,171
-Hey, Rigas. -Yep?

853
01:03:21,338 --> 01:03:23,340
For a moment, I thought you were gonna kill me back there.

854
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:26,010
Well, she did say to shoot you in the heart.

855
01:03:26,176 --> 01:03:28,262
And I know for a fact you ain't got one of those.

856
01:03:48,949 --> 01:03:50,326
Gotta close the hatch, Jonas.

857
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:55,706
We're all gonna die.

858
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:59,543
-He's gonna make it. -No, he's not.

859
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,424
-He's gonna make it. -No! We have to close the hatch!

860
01:04:10,804 --> 01:04:12,389
Close it! Jonas!

861
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,191
I'm here!

862
01:04:23,859 --> 01:04:24,693
That's him!

863
01:04:37,122 --> 01:04:38,332
That was close.

864
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:40,876
Too close.

865
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:45,089
You should have shut the hatch.

866
01:04:45,964 --> 01:04:47,716
Yeah. Meiying would have killed me.

867
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:53,639
You thought about it, though.

868
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,891
Yeah. We thought about it.

869
01:04:55,974 --> 01:04:56,850
Didn't we, Rigas?

870
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:58,685
Shut up.

871
01:04:59,895 --> 01:05:00,896
Just a little bit.

872
01:05:11,865 --> 01:05:12,908
Explosives?

873
01:05:14,576 --> 01:05:15,411
Check this out.

874
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:17,037
Look what else.

875
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,385
Is that gonna be a problem?

876
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:34,138
It's a hole in the thermal layer.

877
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:37,391
It must have been caused by the mining explosions.

878
01:05:37,474 --> 01:05:38,684
It will seal up eventually.

879
01:05:39,726 --> 01:05:41,186
Eventually?

880
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,564
Yeah. Within an hour.

881
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,732
Can the megs follow us through?

882
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:47,734
I hope not.

883
01:06:12,384 --> 01:06:16,263
Boys, I don't want to harm you, but I do need you to come out of this room.

884
01:06:16,346 --> 01:06:18,348
It's Jess. She's got three soldiers.

885
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:21,268
Yeah. It's go time.

886
01:06:22,102 --> 01:06:23,395
Take this.

887
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:24,771
-The hell is this? -It's a Taser.

888
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:26,565
Open up.

889
01:06:27,399 --> 01:06:29,401
They tried to kill Jonas, they're definitely gonna Kill us.

890
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,069
Okay, listen. Here's the plan.

891
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,154
On the count of three,

892
01:06:32,237 --> 01:06:34,156
you'll open the door and I'mma pepper spray 'em.

893
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:35,949
Right, and you'll shut the door and you're gonna wait.

894
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,868
Then go out there and use the Taser.

895
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,328
One, two, three.

896
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:43,582
No, Mac, no!

897
01:06:43,665 --> 01:06:45,083
No, Mac!

898
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,628
It burns! It burns!

899
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:49,505
I'm sorry!

900
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:50,881
Sleepy time.

901
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,105
What's that?

902
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,235
Trouble.

903
01:07:19,451 --> 01:07:23,622
So, we're walking fast and with a lot of determination, which is great.

904
01:07:23,705 --> 01:07:25,791
But what exactly is the plan here?

905
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:27,000
They're armed and we're not.

906
01:07:32,714 --> 01:07:34,007
All righty. So what are you thinking?

907
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,426
What are you thinking?

908
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,012
You and I find Mac and DJ.

909
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:40,389
Rigas, grab what you can.

910
01:07:40,472 --> 01:07:41,890
Secure a Zodiac so we can get off this thing.

911
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:43,350
Rock and roll.

912
01:07:43,433 --> 01:07:44,851
Safest if Meiying goes with you.

913
01:07:53,485 --> 01:07:54,778
I'll protect her with my life.

914
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:56,655
And I'll protect her with mine.

915
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:58,365
No.

916
01:07:58,657 --> 01:07:59,575
No.

917
01:07:59,908 --> 01:08:00,742
No.

918
01:08:02,035 --> 01:08:03,036
Let's go.

919
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:17,509
I told you to wait before you went out that door.

920
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,303
-How's your eyes? -My eye stings.

921
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:22,472
If we climb up to the communications array,

922
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:24,725
we can bypass the DCC and we can call for help.

923
01:08:24,808 --> 01:08:25,934
What are we supposed to say?

924
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:28,270
Um... Terrorist action?

925
01:08:28,353 --> 01:08:29,646
-Yeah, good. Terrorist action. -Yeah, terrorist action.

926
01:08:30,814 --> 01:08:32,107
-Okay. -You got a better idea?

927
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:33,191
Freeze!

928
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:34,735
Oh, no.

929
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,163
DJ! DJ!

930
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:49,249
What the hell?

931
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:52,461
Wow! Yeah, baby! Get some!

932
01:08:52,544 --> 01:08:53,670
- Hey. - Run, Mac, run!

933
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:56,006
Go, go, go!

934
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:10,395
Spread out! Find 'em.

935
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:16,652
You got Tasers? Now you can swim?

936
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:19,071
All of a sudden you're running around like you're Batman.

937
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:20,656
Hell yeah.

938
01:09:21,948 --> 01:09:25,243
After last time, y'all begged me to come back.

939
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:28,372
"DJ, Oh! We family, DJ."

940
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:31,291
"DJ, we need you." Yeah, all right. Bet.

941
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:32,334
But I ain't stupid.

942
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:35,087
I trained up, I learned how to fight, I learned how to swim,

943
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,714
and I will never go anywhere without my survival pack.

944
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:39,216
-Survival pack? -Yeah.

945
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:40,300
Check this out.

946
01:09:40,967 --> 01:09:42,678
Come here, baby. Come here.

947
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:43,720
Bam.

948
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:47,974
Yeah, I even made poison-tipped bullets

949
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:49,351
just like Jaws 2.

950
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:55,357
Come on, DJ! Let's go, let's go.

951
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:00,070
This is insane.

952
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:05,200
Freeze, assholes.

953
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,454
Yeah, freeze.

954
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:10,455
You got this?

955
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:15,961
That was some unfortunate shit back there.

956
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:18,839
No, please! Don't shoot!

957
01:10:30,475 --> 01:10:31,351
What?

958
01:10:37,357 --> 01:10:39,234
Sucker.

959
01:10:42,487 --> 01:10:43,697
I thought you were dead.

960
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:46,241
Wishful thinking, Mac.

961
01:10:46,324 --> 01:10:48,785
If it ain't the deviated septum.

962
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:50,078
- Boat's leaving. - Huh.

963
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:55,542
What's our status?

964
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:57,836
Bravo team are inbound. ETA, ten minutes.

965
01:10:57,919 --> 01:10:58,879
Excellent.

966
01:11:01,047 --> 01:11:02,215
What are you doing here?

967
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:11,433
-Are you okay? -Yeah.

968
01:11:12,642 --> 01:11:13,935
Jonas is on Mana One.

969
01:11:14,978 --> 01:11:16,855
We need to lock this place down now.

970
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:21,651
Search the station top to bottom.

971
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:24,946
Secure personnel in their quarters, kill anyone else.

972
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:27,199
Go! Go!

973
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:35,332
Oh, my God.

974
01:11:41,546 --> 01:11:42,923
Guys?

975
01:11:43,006 --> 01:11:44,841
We've got a big problem.

976
01:11:53,725 --> 01:11:55,060
We tracked three megs that escaped

977
01:11:55,143 --> 01:11:56,061
before the breach closed.

978
01:11:56,144 --> 01:11:58,855
We're gonna need a good cover story for this.

979
01:11:58,939 --> 01:11:59,815
Well that shouldn't be hard.

980
01:12:00,398 --> 01:12:02,526
Everyone knows Jonas and Jiuming were reckless.

981
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,820
No, we need a hero.

982
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:08,782
Someone to emerge from this unforeseeable tragedy...

983
01:12:08,865 --> 01:12:11,993
who can step into a leadership position at the Institute.

984
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:15,163
Jess, are you ready for promotion?

985
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:18,250
I appreciate your confidence.

986
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:19,668
Jess!

987
01:12:19,751 --> 01:12:22,838
It's from the thermocline breach. But you can relax. This place?

988
01:12:23,713 --> 01:12:24,589
Meg-proof.

989
01:12:25,006 --> 01:12:27,092
I mean, Jonas was always afraid of this, but I think

990
01:12:27,175 --> 01:12:29,094
between trackers and gunships, we can solve the problem

991
01:12:29,177 --> 01:12:32,222
and come out the other side with a significant positive PR spin.

992
01:12:33,056 --> 01:12:33,974
Yeah, I'm on it.

993
01:12:34,057 --> 01:12:35,100
I was also thinking--

994
01:13:01,167 --> 01:13:02,419
What now?

995
01:13:02,502 --> 01:13:04,671
It's our only way off. We have to take it.

996
01:13:04,754 --> 01:13:07,340
But that thing doesn't have the range to get us to the mainland.

997
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,636
You're worried about the destination? What about the first hundred yards?

998
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,762
That's where we're gonna die.

999
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:14,764
We paddle out slow.

1000
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:17,267
No engines. Minimal motion.

1001
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:18,852
We won't look like food.

1002
01:13:18,935 --> 01:13:21,021
When we're clear, we make a run for it. Huh?

1003
01:13:21,104 --> 01:13:22,022
Let's do it.

1004
01:13:23,773 --> 01:13:25,984
I still think we look like food.

1005
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:29,946
Shh. Quiet, everyone. Paddle slowly.

1006
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:32,490
This feels unpleasantly familiar.

1007
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,784
Let's just hope it goes better than last time.

1008
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:36,661
What happened last time?

1009
01:13:37,537 --> 01:13:38,788
You don't wanna know.

1010
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:46,046
Oh. Here he comes.

1011
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:54,012
Go, go, go!

1012
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:57,474
Let's not bring 'em back alive.

1013
01:13:59,225 --> 01:14:01,186
You do know how to drive this thing, right?

1014
01:14:08,109 --> 01:14:10,570
Stop! Stop the engine right now.

1015
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,531
Or you will attract the megs.

1016
01:14:15,158 --> 01:14:17,744
Okay. Be still.

1017
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,163
No motion whatsoever.

1018
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,586
I have the shot.

1019
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:29,089
Take it.

1020
01:14:29,172 --> 01:14:30,423
- Get down! - Come on, mate, do your job.

1021
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:32,008
-Take the bloody shot. -It's not easy as it looks.

1022
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,891
He got 'em! He ate 'em! He ate the whole boat!

1023
01:14:43,144 --> 01:14:44,229
What happened?

1024
01:14:45,021 --> 01:14:46,147
Jess is dead.

1025
01:14:47,315 --> 01:14:48,692
-What? -We stabilized Mana One,

1026
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:50,944
but Taylor and Zhang have escaped.

1027
01:14:51,277 --> 01:14:52,404
What do you want me to do?

1028
01:14:52,487 --> 01:14:53,989
Fix it! Kill them!

1029
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:56,116
You do this, you write your own ticket.

1030
01:14:56,199 --> 01:14:57,575
You are set for life.

1031
01:14:58,535 --> 01:14:59,536
Okay.

1032
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:03,206
There's only a couple places they could make it to.

1033
01:15:03,289 --> 01:15:05,375
Are you crying, Montes?

1034
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:19,097
Any sign of the megs?

1035
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:20,974
Negative.

1036
01:15:21,641 --> 01:15:23,643
There's no way this thing's gonna work.

1037
01:15:24,519 --> 01:15:25,478
It's gonna work.

1038
01:15:26,187 --> 01:15:29,190
Look, you got more chance of blowing up yourself than one of the megs.

1039
01:15:30,191 --> 01:15:31,693
At least I won't get eaten.

1040
01:15:31,776 --> 01:15:33,361
Ha! I hear that.

1041
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:34,529
Jo...

1042
01:15:34,612 --> 01:15:35,655
can you make me one?

1043
01:15:37,365 --> 01:15:39,075
I got you covered, Mac.

1044
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:41,411
We have to find a way to warn people.

1045
01:15:41,494 --> 01:15:44,706
In case the megs move towards land. There's an island

1046
01:15:44,789 --> 01:15:46,916
60 klicks south east of us.

1047
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,836
It's listed as inhabited.

1048
01:15:49,919 --> 01:15:51,546
Inhabited by who?

1049
01:15:51,629 --> 01:15:53,715
The name more or less translates to...

1050
01:15:54,966 --> 01:15:55,800
Fun Island.

1051
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:58,094
Fun Island?

1052
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:04,851
Yeah!

1053
01:16:10,273 --> 01:16:13,818
Welcome to Fun Island. Our resort has everything.

1054
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:17,280
The restaurant, amazing.

1055
01:16:17,363 --> 01:16:19,157
The disco, incredible.

1056
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:21,409
And our spa, to die for.

1057
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:22,327
Oh.

1058
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:23,453
OMG.

1059
01:16:23,536 --> 01:16:25,914
It's our special dish. Seafood Surprise!

1060
01:16:25,997 --> 01:16:28,541
Wow, I wouldn't know where to start.

1061
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:30,543
Well, just don't miss out on the grilled shark.

1062
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:32,629
Pippin! Pippin! Pippin!

1063
01:16:33,379 --> 01:16:34,923
-Whoa! What is that? -Pippin!

1064
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:36,966
What are they running from?

1065
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:42,055
Your first time at the rodeo?

1066
01:16:43,264 --> 01:16:45,642
I worked with your dad since before you were born.

1067
01:16:46,392 --> 01:16:47,435
I never had this kind of trouble from him.

1068
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,277
Yeah, and I yelled at him too.

1069
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:04,410
I'm sitting in paradise and you are ruining it!

1070
01:17:04,494 --> 01:17:07,539
Who does that? Who ruins paradise for other people?

1071
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:12,210
Hey, baby.

1072
01:17:12,293 --> 01:17:13,878
Wanna rub some oil on my back?

1073
01:17:15,004 --> 01:17:16,005
No?

1074
01:17:16,464 --> 01:17:18,133
How 'bout my front?

1075
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:19,092
Ew.

1076
01:18:00,633 --> 01:18:01,467
Hey.

1077
01:18:04,345 --> 01:18:05,180
Yaoyao.

1078
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:08,141
Yaoyao.

1079
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:10,268
Yaoyao!

1080
01:18:10,351 --> 01:18:11,186
Yaoyao!

1081
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:45,553
This doesn't look good.

1082
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:47,722
Rigas, get us there fast!

1083
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:57,106
Kill the cellphone uplink.

1084
01:19:07,742 --> 01:19:10,411
There's a lot of exposure for us on this.

1085
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:13,957
Take care of Jonas and his team quickly and quietly.

1086
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:18,336
Everybody out of the water!

1087
01:19:18,419 --> 01:19:20,713
- Shark! Shark! - Get back on the beach!

1088
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:22,257
Get out of the water!

1089
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:24,550
Get back on the beach!

1090
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,514
Mobile comms are down, over.

1091
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:15,810
You copy, guys?

1092
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,897
Crocodile!

1093
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:21,357
What is that?

1094
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:22,900
-Move, move! -Get into the chopper.

1095
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:24,652
Now! Go with her!

1096
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:30,908
Mmm. Mmm.

1097
01:20:40,626 --> 01:20:41,711
Everybody out!

1098
01:20:41,794 --> 01:20:42,962
- Shark! - Shark!

1099
01:20:47,091 --> 01:20:48,718
Get on the beach!

1100
01:20:48,801 --> 01:20:49,927
Go back!

1101
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,512
We have to save them.

1102
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:53,097
-I'm not leaving ya. -Cell phone's down.

1103
01:20:53,723 --> 01:20:55,141
Hello? Hello?

1104
01:20:55,224 --> 01:20:56,351
-No signal. -There's no choice.

1105
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:57,769
-She's right. -We got no signal, guys.

1106
01:20:57,852 --> 01:21:00,396
Hey, you two! Find a way to call for help.

1107
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,439
Let everyone know what happened.

1108
01:21:01,522 --> 01:21:02,774
Come on, come on! This way, this way!

1109
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:05,526
You're gonna hide.

1110
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:06,611
See that lifeguard tower?

1111
01:21:06,694 --> 01:21:08,529
-Yeah. -You go there and you stay there.

1112
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:11,115
This is not one of those things where I tell you to do something,

1113
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,785
you say "yes," and then you do whatever you want.

1114
01:21:13,868 --> 01:21:15,161
Understand?

1115
01:21:15,244 --> 01:21:16,204
Yes.

1116
01:21:16,829 --> 01:21:19,040
-You're not messing with me? -No.

1117
01:21:19,123 --> 01:21:21,709
I can't do what I need to do if I'm worried about you.

1118
01:21:22,668 --> 01:21:23,669
I'll be fine.

1119
01:21:24,337 --> 01:21:25,713
Promise me you'll come back.

1120
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:30,676
You know I love you.

1121
01:22:10,133 --> 01:22:11,300
Oh, shit.

1122
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:17,098
Sonny.

1123
01:22:17,181 --> 01:22:18,433
Check that out.

1124
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:24,939
Hey, yo, my man. You got a phone?

1125
01:22:26,524 --> 01:22:27,817
What's everyone running from?

1126
01:22:29,193 --> 01:22:31,404
What the hell was that?

1127
01:22:31,487 --> 01:22:33,656
Three megs. Three of us.

1128
01:22:33,739 --> 01:22:35,241
We each grab a jet ski.

1129
01:22:35,324 --> 01:22:38,453
Get them to chase it away from these people and out to sea.

1130
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:39,704
Then we harpoon them.

1131
01:22:39,787 --> 01:22:41,706
Oh, you mean with those jerry-rigged,

1132
01:22:41,789 --> 01:22:43,958
maybe they work, maybe they kill us harpoons?

1133
01:22:44,041 --> 01:22:44,876
Yeah.

1134
01:22:44,959 --> 01:22:46,711
It's a terrible idea.

1135
01:22:46,794 --> 01:22:49,046
-You got a better one? -No? No.

1136
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,590
-Then we're agreed. -Yeah.

1137
01:22:50,673 --> 01:22:51,799
-Good. -Great.

1138
01:23:07,064 --> 01:23:08,149
Montes!

1139
01:23:10,359 --> 01:23:11,194
Shit.

1140
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:40,806
Let's go old school.

1141
01:23:47,271 --> 01:23:49,106
The landline's down, too.

1142
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,858
Okay, coast is clear. Let's go.

1143
01:23:57,448 --> 01:23:58,282
They can walk?

1144
01:24:00,409 --> 01:24:01,244
Shit.

1145
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:03,871
It's those things.

1146
01:24:03,955 --> 01:24:06,082
They haven't spotted us yet.

1147
01:24:06,165 --> 01:24:07,208
Okay.

1148
01:24:13,297 --> 01:24:14,340
What else you got in here?

1149
01:24:14,799 --> 01:24:16,259
Emergency stuff.

1150
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:19,971
Okay.

1151
01:24:23,432 --> 01:24:24,976
Really? Condoms?

1152
01:24:25,851 --> 01:24:27,144
Different kind of emergencies.

1153
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:28,688
Hand me that.

1154
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,901
Now hand me that gum in your mouth.

1155
01:24:36,529 --> 01:24:37,530
Thank you.

1156
01:24:50,334 --> 01:24:51,919
There's only one ski.

1157
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:53,045
Give me your harpoons.

1158
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:55,715
You sure?

1159
01:24:55,965 --> 01:24:56,924
Oh...

1160
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:02,555
- I got this. - Good luck.

1161
01:25:03,973 --> 01:25:05,266
We need more firepower.

1162
01:25:05,891 --> 01:25:06,726
Yeah.

1163
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:10,730
I have an idea. Let's go.

1164
01:25:19,822 --> 01:25:21,449
Not this time, Taylor.

1165
01:25:42,887 --> 01:25:44,388
This should be the place.

1166
01:25:47,558 --> 01:25:48,559
Come on.

1167
01:25:55,024 --> 01:25:56,150
What are we looking for?

1168
01:25:57,902 --> 01:25:59,278
Ammonium nitrate.

1169
01:26:00,821 --> 01:26:02,156
You're making a bomb?

1170
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:04,659
This stuff is as powerful as TNT.

1171
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:05,868
Hey!

1172
01:26:05,951 --> 01:26:08,329
Get in! Get in!

1173
01:26:13,167 --> 01:26:14,293
Freeze!

1174
01:26:32,228 --> 01:26:33,062
Come on!

1175
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:05,845
Come on!

1176
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:20,401
Come on, let's see if he's got a phone.

1177
01:27:23,863 --> 01:27:25,781
I got the sat phone. I got the sat...

1178
01:27:25,865 --> 01:27:27,491
I got the phone, why you stealing his money?

1179
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:29,076
What? He's not gonna need it.

1180
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,286
Uh-oh.

1181
01:27:30,995 --> 01:27:34,540
Nice doggies. Nice doggies.

1182
01:27:34,623 --> 01:27:35,541
Okay, Rigas.

1183
01:27:35,624 --> 01:27:37,668
On the count of three, we're gonna bolt.

1184
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:40,087
One. Two. Three!

1185
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:41,088
What the hell? Hey!

1186
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:45,217
Wait for DJ! Wait for DJ!

1187
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:50,681
-They're right behind us! -Let's hide in here!

1188
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,892
Come on, come on. Come here, come here.

1189
01:27:52,975 --> 01:27:55,144
-What the hell? -Hi, DJ. Hi, Rigas.

1190
01:27:55,227 --> 01:27:57,730
All of you together. Up against the wall. Hands up!

1191
01:27:58,647 --> 01:28:01,275
I wouldn't point that at me if I were you. Trust me.

1192
01:28:01,942 --> 01:28:03,819
Shut it! Keep your hands in the air.

1193
01:28:03,903 --> 01:28:04,904
Hands up!

1194
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:10,659
Don't want to hurt you...

1195
01:28:10,743 --> 01:28:12,495
so I'm going to give you one chance.

1196
01:28:13,245 --> 01:28:14,955
Put those weapons down.

1197
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:16,081
Or you'll do what?

1198
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:19,376
Stay still, little guy.

1199
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:26,592
No, no! Joe, Joe, door!

1200
01:28:27,009 --> 01:28:28,010
Stay where you are!

1201
01:28:29,678 --> 01:28:31,305
- Go, go! - Get to cover!

1202
01:28:49,448 --> 01:28:50,407
Damn!

1203
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:54,954
I got signal.

1204
01:28:55,246 --> 01:28:56,163
Call for help!

1205
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:58,123
To get down to the beach and help people!

1206
01:28:58,582 --> 01:28:59,500
Where are you going?

1207
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:01,669
- Stealing a chopper. - What chopper?

1208
01:29:01,961 --> 01:29:03,128
Global rescue?

1209
01:29:03,212 --> 01:29:06,173
We need rescue! We need you to send everybody you got!

1210
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:09,343
The National Guard, the lifeguard, the Coast Guard, anybody!

1211
01:29:09,426 --> 01:29:10,427
Just come now!

1212
01:30:17,411 --> 01:30:19,538
Ugh! Looks like someone else had the same idea.

1213
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:22,291
We need a plan.

1214
01:30:22,374 --> 01:30:24,835
We have to lead it away and steal the chopper.

1215
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:27,421
Okay, you lead it away, I'll steal the chopper.

1216
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:30,591
-You distract it, I'll get the chopper. -Why me?

1217
01:30:30,674 --> 01:30:31,967
Can you fly a chopper?

1218
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:32,927
Yeah, I can.

1219
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:34,303
-You have a license? -Yes, I do!

1220
01:30:34,386 --> 01:30:35,596
-I didn't know that. -What?

1221
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:37,097
Okay, good plan.

1222
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:38,015
Mac!

1223
01:31:15,886 --> 01:31:17,846
Jiuming! We gotta go!

1224
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:26,855
Fuel! Get the fuel!

1225
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:27,940
Gas! We need gas!

1226
01:31:35,197 --> 01:31:36,031
Get up!

1227
01:31:41,745 --> 01:31:42,913
Get the fuel!

1228
01:31:49,294 --> 01:31:50,170
Lizard incoming!

1229
01:31:50,254 --> 01:31:51,088
Hold on!

1230
01:31:51,964 --> 01:31:53,549
Jiuming? Jiuming!

1231
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:05,561
Run!

1232
01:32:12,359 --> 01:32:13,193
Go!

1233
01:32:17,656 --> 01:32:18,657
Whoa, yay!

1234
01:32:20,409 --> 01:32:22,119
Man, I didn't think you were gonna make that one.

1235
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:32,963
Run!

1236
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:48,520
No.

1237
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:16,465
Where are you going, Jonas?

1238
01:33:57,965 --> 01:33:59,758
Get lower! That's Meiying!

1239
01:33:59,842 --> 01:34:01,009
Are you sure it's Meiying?

1240
01:34:07,057 --> 01:34:08,058
Get lower!

1241
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:09,893
Okay, okay! Hold on!

1242
01:34:25,534 --> 01:34:26,535
Meiying!

1243
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:29,329
Over here!

1244
01:34:32,457 --> 01:34:33,292
Leap up!

1245
01:35:56,583 --> 01:35:57,876
Jonas is still alive?

1246
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,628
Get me over there!

1247
01:36:05,842 --> 01:36:06,677
Help!

1248
01:36:24,861 --> 01:36:26,446
Taylor!

1249
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:31,576
Come on!

1250
01:36:34,579 --> 01:36:36,915
Come out from under the bridge, little troll!

1251
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:02,357
End of the line, no?

1252
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:03,859
I guess it is.

1253
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:06,320
You got the gun.

1254
01:37:11,241 --> 01:37:12,242
I won't be needing this.

1255
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:16,872
I knew you couldn't do it.

1256
01:37:20,876 --> 01:37:22,377
See you later, chum.

1257
01:37:27,507 --> 01:37:28,342
Jiu!

1258
01:37:30,802 --> 01:37:31,636
Meiying!

1259
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:34,973
Where?

1260
01:39:09,317 --> 01:39:11,486
Hold on! I'm coming!

1261
01:39:15,365 --> 01:39:16,366
Meiying!

1262
01:39:17,659 --> 01:39:18,785
Meiying!

1263
01:39:18,869 --> 01:39:20,579
Jonas! Over here!

1264
01:39:21,746 --> 01:39:23,248
-You okay? -Yeah.

1265
01:39:23,331 --> 01:39:24,749
Uncle Jiuming and Mac's in trouble.

1266
01:39:29,963 --> 01:39:31,506
Stay here. I'll be right back.

1267
01:39:40,515 --> 01:39:43,101
Mac! Are you okay? Mac?

1268
01:40:40,325 --> 01:40:41,952
Come on, you ugly bastard!

1269
01:41:39,301 --> 01:41:40,510
Come on, come on, come on!

1270
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:42,429
Come on, come on. I got you, I got you. Come on, come on!

1271
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:46,057
Come on, come on, come on!

1272
01:41:48,768 --> 01:41:50,687
Meiying, what are you doing here?

1273
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:51,938
I had to save the dog!

1274
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:53,565
What?

1275
01:41:54,316 --> 01:41:55,150
Mommy's here.

1276
01:41:55,233 --> 01:41:56,901
-Thank you, thank you, thank you! -You're welcome.

1277
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:04,326
- Oh, no, you don't! - Meiying! Come!

1278
01:42:13,627 --> 01:42:14,461
Hell yeah!

1279
01:42:14,544 --> 01:42:16,504
Get some!

1280
01:42:16,588 --> 01:42:19,466
Who says a .50 caliber is an impractical round?

1281
01:42:24,596 --> 01:42:26,264
Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

1282
01:42:26,348 --> 01:42:28,391
Everyone stay still. No motion.

1283
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:31,061
No, it's okay.

1284
01:42:31,811 --> 01:42:33,229
That's Haiqi.

1285
01:42:33,313 --> 01:42:34,731
Who cares which one it is?

1286
01:42:35,899 --> 01:42:36,733
She'll listen to me.

1287
01:42:36,816 --> 01:42:39,194
Let's spread out so that thing don't get us all.

1288
01:42:39,277 --> 01:42:40,320
I got this!

1289
01:43:12,644 --> 01:43:14,354
Yes! I knew it!

1290
01:43:15,563 --> 01:43:18,066
I told you! We have a special bond.

1291
01:43:18,149 --> 01:43:20,151
-It went after the dolphins. -No!

1292
01:43:21,152 --> 01:43:23,697
-She obeyed my command. -Ridiculous.

1293
01:43:25,448 --> 01:43:27,992
I didn't believe it before and I don't believe it now.

1294
01:43:28,076 --> 01:43:29,077
Hey, Mac, back me up.

1295
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:31,413
I'm getting out of here before she changes her mind.

1296
01:43:32,831 --> 01:43:33,665
Mac!

1297
01:43:33,748 --> 01:43:35,709
You guys stay there and argue.

1298
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:37,419
She obeyed my command!

1299
01:43:38,837 --> 01:43:40,463
-Dolphins. -No!

1300
01:43:46,845 --> 01:43:47,971
It's not my fault.

1301
01:43:48,805 --> 01:43:50,932
Sometimes, there's a situation and bad things are happening,

1302
01:43:51,015 --> 01:43:52,809
and you just have to get involved.

1303
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:56,020
I'm glad you finally understand.

1304
01:43:58,314 --> 01:43:59,399
I'm proud of you.

1305
01:44:08,116 --> 01:44:11,202
Rescue One to Fun Island, over.

1306
01:44:11,286 --> 01:44:13,621
Oh, it's good to hear your voice, man.

1307
01:44:13,705 --> 01:44:15,498
We got a lot of people who need help.

1308
01:44:19,836 --> 01:44:22,046
Yeah, I used to didn't know how to swim, but then, you know...

1309
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:24,883
You out there chasing sharks, you better learn how to swim quick!

1310
01:44:26,092 --> 01:44:28,094
The water was cold, it wasn't that cold, but yeah...

1311
01:44:28,178 --> 01:44:29,971
- I was just having fun! - What about Haiqi?

1312
01:44:30,930 --> 01:44:33,016
She's still out there. Maybe pregnant.

1313
01:44:33,099 --> 01:44:34,225
Preferably not.

1314
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:37,020
That's tomorrow.

1315
01:44:37,103 --> 01:44:39,314
Today, we count our blessings.

1316
01:44:40,231 --> 01:44:41,274
Here's to being alive.

1317
01:44:42,817 --> 01:44:44,027
Here's to dolphins.

1318
01:44:45,528 --> 01:44:47,155
To Meiying being safe.

1319
01:44:48,281 --> 01:44:50,200
And here's to Sal, Lance, and Curtis.

1320
01:44:53,536 --> 01:44:54,496
So...

1321
01:44:54,871 --> 01:44:56,039
am I still grounded?

1322
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:00,919
-Absolutely. -Absolutely.

1323
01:45:06,716 --> 01:45:08,176
You two are ridiculous.

1324
01:45:10,011 --> 01:45:11,429
But I love you anyway.

1325
01:45:15,391 --> 01:45:17,685
Looks like you got a little reckless out there.

1326
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:21,439
No, everything was totally under control.

1327
01:45:21,606 --> 01:45:22,899
Yeah, right.

1328
01:45:22,982 --> 01:45:25,735
Well, everything's about to be totally not under control.

1329
01:45:27,862 --> 01:45:28,863
Give me some.

1330
01:45:33,368 --> 01:45:34,786
Mmm.

1331
01:45:34,869 --> 01:45:36,621
Yeah, that's the good stuff.
