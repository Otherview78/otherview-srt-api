1
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,272
Ever seen a shooting star?

2
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,485
Sure. You?

3
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,544
You know what
you're supposed to do, right?

4
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,358
What do you mean, make a wish?

5
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,414
So, if you saw one right now,
what would you wish for?

6
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,628
Well, that's a secret.

7
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,047
What about you?

8
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,510
To know why it took you so long.

9
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,097
All freshman year Biology,

10
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,975
we sat next to each other,
you don't even remember.

11
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,021
No, hey, I remember. Okay?

12
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,231
How about the next year
we had two classes,

13
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,483
do you remember which?

14
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,780
- Never even noticed.
- Oh, hey, that's not true.

15
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,619
So this is it. We're about to graduate
and now you ask me out.

16
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,623
- Now you want to start something?
- Hey, I'm sorry.

17
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,459
Okay? You've gotta forgive me.

18
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,337
Sometimes, you just...

19
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,483
You don't see
what's right in front of you.

20
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,633
Yeah, you don't see.

21
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,511
Okay, so what? You're gonna leave?

22
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,513
You ditch me, we'll be even?

23
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,144
Look, I can't change the past, Emily.

24
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,772
All I know is about tonight.

25
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,402
And tonight you're my wish.

26
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,293
So, uh,

27
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,047
make yourself... You know.

28
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,843
- It's nice, your place.
- Thanks.

29
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,390
Whoa. Is it that late already?

30
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,753
I thought your parents were away.

31
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,144
No. They are.

32
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,980
I just, um, I guess
I lost track of time here.

33
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,919
Uh, can I get you something to drink?

34
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,442
- Sure.
- Yeah? Okay.

35
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,119
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

36
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,482
Hey.

37
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,359
Hey.

38
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,530
I wanna show you something.

39
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,282
What?

40
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:51,917
- Thank you.
- There you go.

41
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,419
To secrets.

42
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,673
- Secrets?
- And sharing them.

43
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:11,353
Have you ever seen something so scary
that you had to show to someone else?

44
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,564
- Um...
- I mean, like,

45
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,358
you know, a movie or something.

46
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:18,902
Well...

47
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:23,240
Okay, I've got the scariest freakin' movie
you'll ever see.

48
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,076
Now.

49
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,620
A buddy of mine
actually turned me on to it.

50
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,622
And, uh, he made me a copy.

51
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,083
So I did one for you.

52
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,939
You brought me here to watch a video?

53
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,672
Well, two minutes. Okay?

54
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,507
Two minutes and it'll all be over.

55
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,259
It's totally underground stuff.

56
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,845
I thought we were gonna just...

57
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,388
No, we will. We will.

58
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,100
You just gotta see this.
I'm telling you, it's...

59
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,475
How about after...?

60
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,186
No, you need to watch it now.

61
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,772
Okay?

62
00:05:58,817 --> 00:05:59,943
So, um...

63
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,989
Just put it in the VCR, and press play,

64
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,952
and as soon as it's over,
I'll be right back in.

65
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,535
- Wait, wait, wait, "back"?
- Yeah, I've seen it.

66
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,706
It's scarier by yourself.

67
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,464
Look, my buddy did this to me. Okay?

68
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,225
This would really
mean something to me, Emily.

69
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,729
You know, like...

70
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,439
Like we're together.

71
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,991
What's so scary about it?

72
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,671
You'll see.

73
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,695
Play it. Just play the thing.

74
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,281
Come on, I got two minutes here, please.

75
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,696
Emily, play the goddamn tape!

76
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,097
- Hello?
- Tick tock, time's up.

77
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,892
What went down, man?
You get someone to watch it?

78
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,895
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, man.

79
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,690
Some stupid chick from my school.

80
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,443
Good thing. I was worried
you didn't believe me.

81
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,446
You don't show somebody else
a copy within a week,

82
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,490
I swear you're dead.

83
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,618
This is freaky stuff, man, freaky stuff.

84
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,954
My cousin, he showed it to his friend,

85
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,997
his friend didn't believe him

86
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,541
he was dead in a week.

87
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:26,917
Jake?

88
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,962
Jake?

89
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,045
Are you there, man?

90
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,508
Jake, don't play around with me.

91
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,218
Emily?

92
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,443
Emily!

93
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,077
Emily!

94
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,556
Emily, what the hell did you do?

95
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,290
I played it, I just didn't look.

96
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,669
Come on, Aidan, let's go home.

97
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,183
It was the right choice. No question.

98
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,609
Aidan, dinner's ready.

99
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,364
Damn.

100
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,700
Aidan!

101
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,219
Okay, now, before you say anything,

102
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,180
I followed the recipe this time.

103
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,082
So just 'cause it doesn't
look like the one in the magazine,

104
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,143
doesn't mean to say it won't taste good.

105
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,068
Those are great, honey.
Got a really good eye.

106
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:27,992
He'd be proud of you.

107
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:30,911
Thanks, Rachel.

108
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,710
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to call me Mom now and again.

109
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,214
Ma. Mommy.

110
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,383
Something besides Rachel.

111
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,886
Yeah, I like Rachel.

112
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,430
Well, Mom has its charms too, you know?

113
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,599
But Rachel, you know,
is more your personality.

114
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,308
Really?

115
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:58,064
Well, Rachel declares dinnertime.

116
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,032
It's working out great, don't you think?

117
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,370
All of this space and fresh air.

118
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,787
We have a yard.

119
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,623
It's really great.

120
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,091
Listen, honey.

121
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,306
We didn't do anything wrong.

122
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,102
We did what anyone would do.

123
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:40,981
We started over.

124
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,213
Yeah?

125
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,468
- Hey.
- Hey.

126
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,015
Uh, you know how they can tell
you used to work at a real newspaper?

127
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,225
You're the only one who closes your door.

128
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,559
Habit.

129
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,985
Uh, I wanted to talk
to you about my editorial.

130
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,403
Those changes okay?

131
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,866
Well, I asked you to
copy edit it and you rewrote it.

132
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,160
Well, just the part
about the bond measure.

133
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,244
That was the whole thing.

134
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,080
Well, it's the bridge that would
get the money, not the riverfront.

135
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,501
Yeah, uh...

136
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,589
You know, it's kind of a tradition here
that I write the lead editorial.

137
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,424
- I mean, it is my paper.
- Of course.

138
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,592
- I own it.
- Right.

139
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,968
And I hired you.

140
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,136
Uh-huh.

141
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,890
I just wouldn't want to see us
print an opinion that was...

142
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,308
What's the word?

143
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,061
Wrong?

144
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,274
Rachel.

145
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,693
Um...

146
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,491
You know, a big news day in Astoria
is a school board meeting,

147
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,284
a car wreck and a cat in a tree.

148
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,368
That's big news.

149
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,206
You sure this is
the job you're looking for?

150
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,626
Well, I'm around for my son more.

151
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,753
In Seattle, I wasn't.

152
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,798
Good a reason as any.

153
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,927
Um, I'm glad to see
you're settling in. I like the...

154
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,887
Hey, Max, while you're here,

155
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,306
have you given any thought
to that piece for tomorrow?

156
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,600
You know what? Don't you worry about it.

157
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,069
Sorry.

158
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,035
It's 442 Ridgecrest.

159
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,833
Ridgecrest. Ridgecrest!

160
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,636
I've already talked
to the medical examiner.

161
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,752
They're on their way.

162
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,337
Squad 19 to respond.

163
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,173
Squad 19, can we keep
this channel clear, please?

164
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,260
- It's the police, they found a body.
- Possible homicide.

165
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,845
Please, we should be so lucky.

166
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,346
What are they saying?

167
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:22,101
High school student, male, 17.
Address, 442 Ridgecrest.

168
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,853
Found the house partially flooded,

169
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,730
and a girlfriend hiding in the basement.

170
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,503
Suspect or witness, they don't know.

171
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,002
The guy was dead on the living room floor
right in front of the TV.

172
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,944
They keep on talking about his face.

173
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,614
What about his face?

174
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,533
All emergency units, area Astoria,

175
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,285
switch to Tack Five.

176
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,886
Detective.

177
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,848
Detective, you have a minute?
Was it homicide or wasn't it?

178
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,600
You know how he died, don't you?

179
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,741
I just have a few last questions.
If you could walk me through it again.

180
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,902
It's just horrible. So young.

181
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,030
No.

182
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,998
No.

183
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,002
No, please, not here.

184
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,939
I found you.

185
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,919
We only made one copy.

186
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,174
Oh, God.

187
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,809
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hold on.

188
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,434
Yeah'?

189
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,157
I'm Rachel Keller from the Daily Astorian.

190
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,397
We'll make a statement.

191
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,899
I need to know about the girl.

192
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,150
We'll make a statement.

193
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,027
She hasn't said a word, has she?

194
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,073
You're welcome to wait. Excuse me.

195
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,538
Watch your step. Have a seat here, okay?

196
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,958
Have a seat.
I just want you to relax for me.

197
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,126
You can't keep her here. She's scared.

198
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,420
- Focus on the walls.
- We wanna take her home.

199
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,357
- She'll talk to us.
- I understand your concerns.

200
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,181
I'm just gonna ask
a few questions in private.

201
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,551
It'll just take a minute. Please.

202
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,594
- Be right back, Emily.
- Thank you. Thank you.

203
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,014
All right. Give me his number.

204
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,058
Yeah. All right.

205
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,365
Emily.

206
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:52,121
Emily, listen to me. I know what happened.

207
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,538
I know.

208
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,917
Now, you have to tell me. The tape.

209
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,047
Did you watch it?

210
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,803
Do you know who else has watched it?

211
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,141
Has anyone else watched it?

212
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,436
No.

213
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:16,979
Then where is it?

214
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,608
Hey, you, get away from her. Ray.

215
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:24,194
Emily, talk to me.

216
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,155
I want her out of here. Now.

217
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,157
You can tell me, Emily.

218
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:23,499
Not here, Samara. Not here.

219
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,092
Rachel?

220
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,388
Rachel?

221
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,446
Rachel?

222
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,662
Rachel!

223
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,835
Rachel! Rachel!

224
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,171
Rachel! Rachel!

225
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,923
Honey, what is it?

226
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,342
What's wrong? Huh?

227
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,969
What's wrong? Look at me. Shh.

228
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,348
- Okay? What is it?
- I had a nightmare.

229
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,727
That's all right. We all have them.

230
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,690
Oh, God, you're soaked.
And you're freezing.

231
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,735
Let's get you out of
these clothes. Come on.

232
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,861
Aidan?

233
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,324
What happened in your nightmare?

234
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,621
I woke up and you weren't here.

235
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,872
You weren't here.

236
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,337
I'm here now, honey. I'm right here, okay?

237
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,131
Listen.

238
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:23,387
All you have to do is call my name
and I'll follow your voice.

239
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,888
Okay?

240
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:31,478
Even if I have to come right down
into that nightmare with you.

241
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,649
So tell me what happened.

242
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,362
Hmm?

243
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,154
I don't remember.

244
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:44,449
You don't remember?

245
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,202
I don't remember.

246
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,359
Aidan.

247
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:23,404
Aidan.

248
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,829
Aidan.

249
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,837
Honey. Can you hear me?

250
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,256
I've been calling your name.

251
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,551
I'm sorry.

252
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,306
- You ready to go?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

253
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,185
Okay.

254
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:55,372
So we'll just swing by
and see what they have, okay?

255
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,417
And you can keep a watch
on the backyard stuff. How's that?

256
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:07,259
Look at all this stuff.
Who do you think buys this crap?

257
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,679
Rachel. Hi.

258
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,931
- Hi.
- Hey.

259
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,368
You guys, come here. Here's the new
neighbor I was telling you about.

260
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,476
Rachel Keller.

261
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,061
She works for the Daily Astoria.

262
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,730
Oh, Rachel, meet
Meg Lowry and Audrey Flint.

263
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,482
- Hello.
- Hello.

264
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,902
So looking for stuff to
fill up that new house, huh?

265
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,296
You should see what
Rachel is doing with it.

266
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,072
She's doing with it, a kind of, um,

267
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,324
a country loft look, right?

268
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,536
Did they replace that orange linoleum

269
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,122
that was in the back
bathroom there before you moved in?

270
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,205
Oh, you are so bad.

271
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,207
You know, you really
should get here early, Rachel,

272
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,811
because the good stuff is gone by noon.

273
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,046
I'm sorry, just a sec.

274
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,844
Whatever I say,
walk and keep walking, all right?

275
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,182
I'm sorry. I forgot your names.

276
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,725
Oh, Meg and Audrey.

277
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,852
Aidan, stay with me, honey.

278
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,565
Aidan, stay with me, honey.

279
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,776
Kids.

280
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,448
Yeah, well, there's
a reason God made them so cute.

281
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,282
Huh?

282
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,658
[I So we don't kill them.

283
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:18,413
- I really should...
- Oh, we know, we know, we know.

284
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,082
Go ahead, we're around.
We'll run into you.

285
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,566
- It's good to meet you.
- You, too.

286
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:25,378
Good luck with everything.

287
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,880
- Take care now.
- Goodbye.

288
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,843
Aidan?

289
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,848
Thank you, I owe you one.

290
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,559
Don't you want friends?

291
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,771
Those aren't friends, honey.
They're the secret police.

292
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,440
You still cold?

293
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,694
What's wrong, honey? You all right?

294
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:51,655
Mm-hmm.

295
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,618
- I'm gonna take a look around.
- All right.

296
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,246
Stay close.

297
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,620
Hello, young man.

298
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,544
Have you received
your free lucky marble today?

299
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,433
I wouldn't, if I were you.

300
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,853
I heard they don't even
make the machines anymore.

301
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,228
Fine with me.

302
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,859
Well, I guess it's proof
there's not a lot to do around here.

303
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,153
Not much happens.

304
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,614
Although, the past three months

305
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,033
we've had a couple of
interesting events, haven't we?

306
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,117
A couple?

307
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,202
What? Something
happened before the murder?

308
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,873
Yeah, well, you came here.
That was interesting.

309
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,209
Is that a line, Max?

310
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:31,712
More of a question.

311
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,049
Why would you choose to live here?

312
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,635
No one would choose
to live in a place like this.

313
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,929
It's quiet.

314
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,480
Well, I got to tell you,
I think it's too quiet.

315
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,064
I can't sleep, I miss noise.
I miss garbage trucks.

316
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,441
I lived in New York for ten years.

317
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,402
Four years at Columbia,
then the Daily News, and for me,

318
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,819
that place is home.

319
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,657
I thought you were born here.

320
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,367
Oh, yeah, I was. I moved back.

321
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,370
It's not that tragic.

322
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,664
I'm just surprised, that's all.

323
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:09,209
Found out my parents weren't well,
so I came back to help out for a while.

324
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,543
I'm still here.

325
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,046
Are they still...?

326
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,382
No. I got the house, I got the paper.

327
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:18,259
And I got the 20 employees in the town

328
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,886
I swore I would never come back to.

329
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,349
- Homesick.
- Yeah.

330
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:28,603
- Yeah. Terminal case.
- I recognize the symptoms.

331
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,109
- Hey, Max, how are you?
- Good, Dale.

332
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,402
Who's the little cutie?

333
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,156
Uh, new editor, Dale.
Co-worker, colleague.

334
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,367
Whatever you say.

335
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,248
This place will grow on you, Rachel.

336
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,919
Are you ready? You guys all ready to go?

337
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,965
On your mark, get set, go!

338
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,245
Love to meet him.
You should bring him by sometime.

339
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,496
I will.

340
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:29,945
Paper's the only family I have.

341
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,750
So, I try to treat it like one.

342
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:32,833
I can see that.

343
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,422
Whenever you want
to tell me, feel free to.

344
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,299
- Tell you what?
- Why here?

345
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,094
Like I said, it's quiet.

346
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:45,971
Okay.

347
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,767
You don't have kids, do you, Max?

348
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,145
Everything I do is for my son.

349
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
Everything.

350
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,359
I should, uh...

351
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,110
Sure.

352
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,822
I really would like to meet him.

353
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,574
See if he's anything like you.

354
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,872
Man, that was genius.

355
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:22,883
Aidan?

356
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,610
Aidan.

357
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:28,866
Aidan.

358
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:50,930
Aidan?

359
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,654
Remember, you gotta wait for the whistle.

360
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:00,856
Aidan.

361
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:02,983
Aidan.

362
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,939
Aidan! Aidan!

363
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,032
Are you in there?

364
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,451
Aidan?

365
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,753
Why didn't you answer me, honey?
What are you...

366
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,214
Jesus.

367
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,342
Jesus, you're freezing, honey.
What's going on? Are you sick?

368
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,053
Talk to me, honey.

369
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,097
Talk to me. What's going on?

370
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,809
- What is it?
- I'm cold.

371
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,437
Oh.

372
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,984
It's okay. It's okay.

373
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,832
Honey, when did this start?

374
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,501
Was it last night,

375
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,545
or this morning?

376
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,382
I don't remember.

377
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:35,094
Look, I know you don't like me prying,
but this is important, okay?

378
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:38,848
Was it your nightmare?

379
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:41,713
I really don't remember, Rachel.

380
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,394
I need you to try.

381
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:48,566
You're sick, all right?
And we need to know what started it.

382
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,567
Aidan.

383
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,784
Was she in your nightmare?

384
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:09,044
Rachel!

385
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,519
Don't stop.

386
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,230
Don't stop.

387
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,068
- Go! Drive, drive!
- What's the matter, honey?

388
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:33,861
Just don't stop the car!

389
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,917
Just... just don't stop the car!

390
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,597
Get down!

391
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,038
- Why did you say...
- Rachel!

392
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,390
"Don't stop."

393
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:47,810
You said, "Don't stop."

394
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,288
Oh, my God.

395
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,537
Don't stop.

396
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:42,717
Okay. Let's see.

397
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,015
That's impossible.

398
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:55,479
Rachel, what's happening?

399
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,034
Yeah, hi, um,

400
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:12,663
my son is very sick
and I'd like to talk to someone who...

401
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:14,789
Right.

402
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,712
Well, it's his temperature.

403
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:22,548
It's... it"'s five degrees low.

404
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,297
Okay.

405
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,472
Keep him warm.

406
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:52,263
Oh, my God.

407
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,266
Oh, my God.

408
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,661
Aidan?

409
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:19,706
Honey.

410
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,337
Honey, this shouldn't be open.

411
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:27,464
God.

412
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,776
Aidan, let's go. Get out of bed.

413
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,992
Aidan, what are you doing over there?

414
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,329
Get back in bed right now.

415
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:02,082
I saw something.

416
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:15,762
Aidan.

417
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,725
Move, get away. Get away from there.

418
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,645
Honey, let's go. Come on.

419
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:32,321
I saw it.

420
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,449
- I saw it in my head.
- Let's go.

421
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:03,561
- Oh, Ms. Keller, about my story. I...
- Not now.

422
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:19,660
Now, listen, sweetie.
Last night I found a tape.

423
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:21,537
It was one of hers.

424
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,623
And I made it so
we'd never have to see it again.

425
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:28,794
But if she knows that,

426
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,965
what I did might make her wanna hurt us.

427
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,258
Am I right?

428
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,720
Do you know something, honey?

429
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,807
Look, if you know why
she's here, you have to tell me.

430
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,474
Aidan.

431
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:47,104
Is she here to hurt you?

432
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,356
Honey.

433
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,659
She can hear us.

434
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,414
She hears everything.

435
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,293
Except when we sleep.

436
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,047
She can't hear us when we sleep?

437
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:15,466
What does that mean?

438
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,844
We have to sleep.

439
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,265
Rachel, may I come in, please?

440
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:26,476
Yeah.

441
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:31,857
What happened to your car?

442
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:34,610
Your car. Apparently it's wrecked.

443
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,696
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah. We got hit.

444
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,281
And no one's hurt?

445
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:41,532
That's good.

446
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,954
Aidan, right? Hi, I'm Max.

447
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:51,251
- Is he all right?
- He's sick.

448
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:52,502
How sick?

449
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:03,263
Max, I need your help.

450
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,593
- Here.
- I'll get some more blankets.

451
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,888
The house is yours if
there's anything you need at all.

452
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,223
Okay. Thanks.

453
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,143
- Here.
- Thank you.

454
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,854
- Shouldn't he be at a hospital?
- No, he's fine.

455
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,689
The bath?

456
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,816
Yeah, it's just down the hall.
I'll get it started.

457
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:58,777
Honey.

458
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,365
I'm gonna go home
and get some of our things.

459
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:07,703
Then we'll leave here
and never come back, okay?

460
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,543
Let's get you warmed up.

461
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,962
Not the best water pressure, but it works.

462
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,088
It's good, thanks.

463
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:19,465
I don't know why we lost power.

464
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:20,734
The rest of the block seemed fine.

465
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:23,677
I have plenty of candles
in case the problem spreads.

466
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,847
Okay. Let's go ahead and get in.
Let's get you warmed up.

467
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,974
Max, I just need to go back to my house,

468
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,268
get a few things, some medicine.

469
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,020
Do you mind if you could...?

470
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:36,106
- I'll watch him. Of course.
- Okay, thanks.

471
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,357
Honey, go ahead and get in.

472
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:38,692
Let's go. Let's go.

473
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,905
We need to raise your temperature.
Now, let's get in.

474
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:46,200
Aidan, what's wrong? It's just water.

475
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:48,636
We need to raise your temperature,
honey, come on.

476
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,995
I don't want to, Rachel.

477
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,872
Do you want me to get in with you?

478
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:56,126
Let's go then, Aidan. Come on, let's go.

479
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:58,796
That's it.

480
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:01,924
Come on, honey. Let's go, let's go.

481
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:04,384
That's it. That's it.

482
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,805
That's better, right?

483
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,891
See? It's nice and warm.

484
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,520
It's okay. Just relax.

485
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,569
Hello?

486
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:30,906
Officer Ray. How you doing?

487
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:34,284
Yeah, good, good. All right,
what do you got for me?

488
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:37,079
Mm-hmm. Right.

489
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,164
Yeah. Yeah.

490
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,626
Yeah, well, that all sounds like page 26.

491
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:44,912
You don't have any headlines?

492
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:47,756
No.

493
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:50,300
Well, business is business.

494
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,553
Yeah. No, no, I'm good, real good.

495
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,557
Hey, listen, could you
do me a little favor while I've got you?

496
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,535
Could you look into
your accident reports for today

497
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,437
and see if there was an accident
with a woman and her son?

498
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,398
K for Keller.

499
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:07,821
No, no, I'm just
trying to get a story straight.

500
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:11,655
Ray?

501
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,615
Ray, let me call you right back. Okay.

502
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,833
Everything okay in there?

503
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:32,509
Uh, Aidan, could you,
uh, unlock the door, please?

504
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,972
Aidan, can you hear me?

505
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,033
Aidan, please, unlock the door!

506
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,450
Aidan, open the door!

507
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,662
Aidan. Aidan, Aidan!

508
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,498
He's in the bath,
I don't know. It was open a second ago.

509
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:04,916
Aidan, open the door!

510
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:06,352
I'm gonna get something to break it.

511
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,212
Aidan, open up the door. I'm right here.

512
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,757
Honey, can you hear me? Please.

513
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,258
You need to open up the door.

514
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:15,176
Aidan!

515
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:19,930
Aidan.

516
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:21,432
Aidan.

517
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:26,687
Oh.

518
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:36,323
Aidan! Aidan.

519
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,076
Please, honey, open the...

520
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,125
Oh, my God.

521
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:55,716
Oh!

522
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:57,676
Aidan.

523
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,894
Aidan. Aidan. Look at me.

524
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:08,480
Aidan, look at me. Look at me.

525
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:37,926
Mommy!

526
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:51,314
Rachel, no!

527
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,281
Baby. Oh.

528
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:03,326
Oh, my God. Baby, I'm sorry.

529
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:08,206
It wasn't him. It wasn't him.

530
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,500
I was just trying to help.

531
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:13,795
Okay, Rachel,
let's just get him out of there.

532
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,388
Why is she doing this to me?

533
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,808
I'm here now, baby.

534
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:29,603
- Why is she doing this to me?
- It's okay, Aidan.

535
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,330
We're gonna get you better.
We're gonna get you to a hospital.

536
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,354
No!

537
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,774
They can't do anything.

538
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:36,836
You asked for my help,
you're gonna get my help

539
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,320
when he gets to a hospital, Rachel.

540
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,183
All right, everyone, we're back,

541
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,101
continuing with our outdoor theme.

542
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:12,437
I hope that you're
enjoying the show so far.

543
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,481
Summer finally seems to be here

544
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,650
and I know with Memorial approaching,

545
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,568
it's the official kick off of summer.

546
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,112
One thing we all love to do
throughout the summer months

547
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:24,574
is spend time outdoors
with our friends and our family.

548
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:27,118
We've offered you what I think...

549
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:28,954
is one of the most affordable sets.

550
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,708
This is a really great set because...

551
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,711
set for $1.32 a piece.

552
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:40,173
Don't hang up, we'll continue to...

553
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,931
is really very, very pretty.

554
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,308
Sorry, I'm starting to perspire a little.

555
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:52,310
But it's hot out here already in Florida.

556
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:59,693
I wonder how long it's been going on.

557
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,569
Those bruises.

558
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,740
Iced tea. If you wanted
to make one of those little drinks

559
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,200
that require an umbrella,

560
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,869
you could make it in bulk, if you will.

561
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,205
Put it in the pitcher and away you go.

562
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:13,456
This is a really great set

563
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:17,294
because you're getting them
with hibiscuses all over,

564
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:21,339
it's a hibiscus pitcher,
it's a 30 ounce pitcher, so...

565
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:22,674
It's his core temperature.

566
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,843
He was at 90 degrees when he came in.

567
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:28,805
- He wasn't outside overnight?
- No. He was at home with me.

568
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,268
A body doesn't develop
severe hypothermia on its own.

569
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:35,979
Whatever the cause, he's fighting it.

570
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,480
Seems like he's stabilizing.

571
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:39,941
- And he's just sleeping now?
- Right.

572
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,320
And having some kind of dream.

573
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,922
What's the story, Rachel?

574
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,969
They stabilized his temperature.

575
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,286
I mean the story with you and Aidan.

576
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:13,892
You seem awfully hard on him.

577
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:23,485
Look, I know
it's a stressful time for you.

578
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,780
Moving. It's a whole new life.

579
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,033
Maybe you should tell me.

580
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:39,000
All I ever tried to do
for him was the right thing.

581
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,504
It only ever made things worse.

582
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:44,714
Then it wasn't the right thing, was it?

583
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:04,483
What do you see?

584
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:10,448
Well, it's Aidan.

585
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,829
- Is that a girl there?
- Why is she in the picture?

586
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,207
- Why? How would I know?
- Why is she in all of them?

587
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:23,711
Her name's Samara.

588
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:27,924
She was murdered by her mother.

589
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,801
Left to die at the bottom of a well.

590
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,930
- Wait, she's... she's who?
- She didn't die.

591
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:39,102
At least, not her ghost.
I kept it alive for Aidan.

592
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:43,273
I let it out, it spread and then we ran.

593
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,375
What are you talking about?

594
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:46,776
Look, I know this sounds completely crazy,

595
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,822
but she's here now, she's found us.

596
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,992
And I thought it was just to hurt Aidan,

597
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:57,245
but it's more than that,
she wants to be him.

598
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,373
And she wants to live for real this time.

599
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:12,260
You tell me, who can help me?

600
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:14,471
Who?

601
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,639
Rachel, I'm sure there's
a rational ex plan a...

602
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:19,267
You take his picture
and tell me why she's in it.

603
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,728
- Rachel.
- You take his picture.

604
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,776
And it's proof that he's what, Rachel?
That he's got a ghost inside him?

605
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:28,485
No. The proof is what will happen.

606
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:45,460
Aidan, you said Samara
couldn't hear us when we sleep.

607
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,755
Well, you're sleeping now.

608
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,928
Tell me how to stop her, honey.

609
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:58,139
Tell me how to help you.

610
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,476
Just tell me, I'll do anything, I swear.

611
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:14,257
Aidan?

612
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,511
- Aidan?
- Ms. Keller?

613
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:23,766
Hello, I'm Dr. Emma Temple.

614
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:28,021
I'm a consulting physician
at County Child Services.

615
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:31,566
Well, I was hoping to speak
with Aidan when he wakes up.

616
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,738
Is everything all right in here?

617
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,158
Yeah, it's fine. Thank you.

618
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:42,285
I was hoping to speak with you as well.

619
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:46,414
It's Rachel, isn't it?
Yeah, about his situation.

620
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:51,502
I'm sorry, what kind of doctor
did you say you were again?

621
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:52,920
I'm a psychiatrist.

622
01:08:53,463 --> 01:09:00,261
Yeah. I spoke with
a Dr., um, Koji in Seattle.

623
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:01,553
Aidan's doctor.

624
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:03,723
Look, if we could maybe talk later.

625
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:09,687
Right, um, Dr. Koji mentioned
that you dealt with some PPD

626
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:11,189
when Aidan was born.

627
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:13,441
Postpartum depression.

628
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:15,610
That was the first month. That's all.

629
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,654
I understand. It's very common.

630
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:20,531
I mean, a lot of women have trouble

631
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,742
adapting to the stresses of motherhood.

632
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,995
What does this have to do with what's
going on with my son right now?

633
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,791
Have you been under stress lately?

634
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:33,169
Have you ever found that you were

635
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:37,340
unable to experience love for Aidan?

636
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:38,925
What?

637
01:09:39,384 --> 01:09:40,426
Have you hurt him,

638
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:42,845
however unintentionally?

639
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:46,182
Have you left him alone? Abandoned him?

640
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:49,185
I'd like to be with my son,
please, if you don't mind.

641
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:53,355
Yeah, of course.

642
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:57,110
I'm sorry, Rachel.

643
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:05,660
Until we can talk further,
I cannot let you be alone with him.

644
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:08,955
I'm his mother.

645
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,459
There are bruises on his body.

646
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,296
He was hypothermic and very near death.

647
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,715
That is not because of me.

648
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,097
He's gonna be all right, Rachel. He will.

649
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:28,057
But you need to leave.

650
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,060
Now, please.

651
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:39,944
You can't have him, Samara.

652
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:43,156
You're going back to where you came from.

653
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:51,789
We'll talk in here.

654
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:55,126
It really will help, Rachel.

655
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,004
Sharing one's troubles never hurt anybody.

656
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:02,091
- Now, are you a coffee drinker?
- Black.

657
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,010
Yeah, I imagined so.

658
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:29,702
Dr. Forrest, dial 118, please.

659
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:32,663
Dr. Forrest, please dial 118.

660
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,269
So, let's call the doctor in Seattle.

661
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,730
I want to know just
how bad her postpartum got.

662
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,106
- Yes.
- Thank you.

663
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,320
The mother is missing.

664
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,113
I want a watch on this room.

665
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:08,616
She returns, she is not allowed in.

666
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,451
Okay, Dr. Temple.

667
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:51,450
All I wanna know is what her history
was before the Morgans.

668
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:54,120
I'm sorry, but
the privacy laws still apply.

669
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,581
Well, was she really adopted?

670
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:58,374
Can you at least tell me that much?

671
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,959
Was their story true?

672
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,086
Samara Morgan was adopted, yes.

673
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:04,630
But you won't tell me from who?

674
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,090
I'd lose my job if I did.

675
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:10,303
Look, ma'am,
my son has a medical condition

676
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,946
that his doctors don't even understand.

677
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:14,140
This little girl had the same condition.

678
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,894
Now, if I knew what caused that,
it could save his life.

679
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:21,397
All I can say is
you should speak to the Morgans.

680
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:26,110
They're dead. They both killed themselves.

681
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:00,830
Whoa! Look out, early birds.

682
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:03,791
Marty Savide, Stevens Northwest Realty.

683
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,668
- Hi.
- Uh, come in.

684
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:09,630
I thought I put 12:30 on the ad.
For the open house.

685
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:12,008
- How'd you get around the gate?
- Well, I just...

686
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,634
Ah! Who cares? Come on.

687
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:17,471
Make me an offer
over asking and it's yours.

688
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,724
Okay, then, don't mind me.

689
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:24,353
My first try with these things,
took off flying.

690
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:27,356
There we go.

691
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:29,274
What do you think?

692
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:34,030
Um, a little color will
really turn the place around.

693
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,407
I tell you what,
it's got a wonderful history.

694
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,492
Working horse ranch. How about that?

695
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:41,037
And there's even this
cute little tree house thing

696
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,120
way up in the barn.

697
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:47,793
Um, is the place
being sold unfurnished or...

698
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,439
The previous owners
didn't leave anything behind?

699
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:54,508
Uh, well, there were
some things that were left,

700
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,428
after they... moved.

701
01:15:58,179 --> 01:16:00,460
We're storing all that
in the basement for the time being.

702
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,183
There's a basement?

703
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:06,771
Uh, well, you betcha. No extra charge.

704
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:07,854
Right this way.

705
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:21,619
Uh, if you don't mind,
I'm the welcome wagon.

706
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:23,263
Gotta open up the gate for everyone else.

707
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:25,790
So please, just make yourself at home.

708
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:29,376
Do you know what happened
to them? The previous owners?

709
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,797
I believe they bought a condo in Phoenix.

710
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,297
Really?

711
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:01,546
Her mother.

712
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:42,129
Oh, my. You're awake.

713
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,198
Hello, Aidan, I'm Dr. Temple.

714
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:11,533
How are you feeling?

715
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:16,454
Aidan?

716
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:22,378
You know, I'd really like to help you.

717
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:25,255
Can you tell me how you're feeling?

718
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:29,550
Where's my mommy?

719
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,472
Well, she'll be here soon.
She's on her way.

720
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:35,473
I want Mommy.

721
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:38,352
Yeah, I know you do.

722
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:41,188
Your mommy wants to be with you too.

723
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:43,022
So where is she?

724
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:46,151
She went home.

725
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:48,320
She didn't think that
you were gonna wake up so soon.

726
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:50,489
I wanna go home too.

727
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:52,741
Well, you will.

728
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:56,120
We just have to...
we just have to get you...

729
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,251
You're freezing.

730
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:06,380
I wanna go home to Mommy.

731
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:11,301
Well, we need to talk about her.

732
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:15,389
Can you tell me about Mommy a little bit?

733
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:18,308
She loves me.

734
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,311
I know that she does.

735
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:25,232
She went looking for me.
She tried to find me.

736
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:28,152
It means she loves me.

737
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:32,030
I don't understand.

738
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:37,035
Can I go home now?

739
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:42,708
No, honey, you're not well enough.

740
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,170
Can I go home?

741
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:49,505
No.

742
01:22:58,223 --> 01:22:59,223
I'm sorry.

743
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:10,277
Then I have to show you something.

744
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:10,587
It won't stop.

745
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:29,583
Hi, I'm Sister Diane, how can we help you?

746
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:32,419
Yeah, I need to know
about a child who was born here.

747
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,130
Is there anyone that can talk to me

748
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,965
who's been here more than 30 years?

749
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:39,509
Please, come in.

750
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:24,012
I remember this, yes.

751
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:27,557
A young girl made it. 16.

752
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:31,061
She was shy. Quiet.

753
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,188
Beautiful.

754
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:36,358
- She stayed here?
- Yes.

755
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,985
- Did she have her baby here?
- Yes.

756
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:41,238
And you arranged for the adoption?

757
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:42,321
That's right.

758
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:43,781
Who was she?

759
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:54,668
She was picked up
wandering the streets and brought to us.

760
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,922
She was from some little town
up in the mountains.

761
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:02,300
She said she'd been sent away

762
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:04,136
to live with relatives in the city.

763
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:07,055
But no relatives were ever found.

764
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:13,687
Her name was Evelyn.

765
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:18,567
She came to us eight months pregnant.

766
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:21,278
- And the father?
- There was none.

767
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:27,617
Half the mothers that come to us say that.

768
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,454
So, what did she think got her pregnant?

769
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:32,080
Evelyn wasn't well.

770
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:35,125
She had been having
problems during the pregnancy.

771
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:37,669
Hallucinations, visions.

772
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:41,256
She believed some
thing had come for her baby

773
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:44,092
from the waters of
the world beyond this one.

774
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:46,303
I'm sorry. Did you say water?

775
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:51,183
Well, we all envision
the afterlife differently.

776
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:54,978
For Evelyn, it's just what she believed.

777
01:27:56,396 --> 01:28:00,275
As you might imagine,
she suffered severe postpartum depression.

778
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:02,778
She blamed her troubles on her child.

779
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:05,155
So she tried to kill it.

780
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:14,080
All babies are a challenge.

781
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:18,877
But Samara, she never cried.

782
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:21,253
Never.

783
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:24,216
Except when
her mother would try to bathe her.

784
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:26,885
Then she'd scream like
it was the end of the world.

785
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,560
It was the screaming that woke us.

786
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:47,030
Evelyn, don't!

787
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:52,953
Evelyn!

788
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:55,705
Evelyn, stop!

789
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,054
She was trying to drown the baby.

790
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:14,015
The baby was taken from her, of course.

791
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:16,142
Evelyn was institutionalized.

792
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:19,354
And all those pictures
she'd been collecting,

793
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:20,814
they finally made sense.

794
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,279
Did she say why she did it?

795
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:31,366
She felt she had to
kill her baby to save it.

796
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:35,013
I'm here to see a patient.
Her name's Evelyn.

797
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:37,432
- I don't know her last name.
- Evelyn?

798
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:38,766
That's right.

799
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:43,271
Evelyn's expecting you.

800
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:46,316
Every few years,
one of you comes to see Evelyn.

801
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:48,818
She's like a freakin'
patron saint or something.

802
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:51,571
Got a problem with your kid, don't you?

803
01:30:58,703 --> 01:30:59,703
Something wrong?

804
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:03,041
That song. I know it.

805
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:05,126
Yeah. They all do.

806
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:13,468
Hey, Evelyn.

807
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,888
You were right as rain.
You got a visitor today.

808
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:20,392
Hope she's some help to your troubles.

809
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:22,394
10 minutes.

810
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:30,777
My name's Rachel.

811
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:33,530
But you know that.

812
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,871
Some days I sort of have a feeling.

813
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:45,625
A feeling?

814
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:48,670
This is about your child.

815
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:54,550
It's...

816
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:58,722
it's about yours.

817
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:00,723
Samara.

818
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:10,734
They don't dream, you know.

819
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:13,987
The dead don't dream.

820
01:32:18,992 --> 01:32:21,453
Look, something's happened to my son.

821
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:24,265
- You have to sleep to dream.
- And it has to do with your daughter.

822
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:25,415
And the dead never sleep.

823
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:27,708
They wait

824
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,046
and watch for a way back.

825
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:35,717
But they never sleep.

826
01:32:37,343 --> 01:32:38,636
That's why dreams are safe.

827
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,721
I'm sorry, I just,

828
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:43,683
I don't have a lot of time,
please, I need your help.

829
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:45,852
I have to know. Can you tell me?

830
01:32:48,021 --> 01:32:50,065
Why did you try to kill your baby?

831
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,400
Why?

832
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:57,238
Because my baby told me to.

833
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,742
Just like yours will tell you.

834
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:02,744
And you have to do it.

835
01:33:04,871 --> 01:33:06,164
You have to send it back.

836
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:07,623
What?

837
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:14,839
They stopped me.

838
01:33:17,133 --> 01:33:19,719
- Don't let them stop you.
- What?

839
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,640
Listen to the voices.

840
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:25,934
What are you talking about?

841
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:29,104
Because it's our fault. We did it.

842
01:33:29,187 --> 01:33:31,064
Yes. We did it, yes.

843
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:33,775
It was you. It was you, you did it!

844
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:34,901
What did I do?

845
01:33:37,821 --> 01:33:39,739
Evelyn, that's enough.

846
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:43,242
I love my son.

847
01:33:45,203 --> 01:33:47,288
Come on. It's all right.

848
01:33:48,665 --> 01:33:50,345
I'm sorry, ma'am, that's enough for today.

849
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,043
Let's go.

850
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:54,921
What did I do?

851
01:33:56,798 --> 01:33:58,258
You let the dead get in.

852
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:02,219
Let's go.

853
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:17,569
What should I do?

854
01:34:20,113 --> 01:34:21,698
Be a good mother.

855
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:25,535
Listen to your baby.

856
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,208
Listen to your baby.

857
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:41,176
Listen to your baby.

858
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,095
Listen to your baby.

859
01:34:45,763 --> 01:34:47,182
Listen to your baby.

860
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:32,101
Aidan?

861
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:37,439
Hey.

862
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:42,278
Shouldn't you, uh...

863
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:44,906
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

864
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:47,283
No. I'm here waiting for my mommy.

865
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:49,243
Okay.

866
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:54,249
Well, you can't really leave
till the hospital says it's okay.

867
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:57,418
You were very, very sick.

868
01:36:00,088 --> 01:36:01,172
You're all right now?

869
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:09,055
The cable setup at my house,

870
01:36:09,138 --> 01:36:11,015
the TV needs to be on channel three.

871
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:15,895
She loves me. She loves me not.

872
01:36:16,813 --> 01:36:19,399
- Thank you, Max.
- Sure.

873
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:24,320
She loves me!

874
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,197
Look, Mandy!

875
01:36:29,284 --> 01:36:30,702
! think I'm gonna puke.

876
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,663
Why don't you do something
productive with your life?

877
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:38,710
Say, Billy, if you like fish so much...

878
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:40,044
Your mom loves you, you know.

879
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:42,297
She loves you a lot.

880
01:36:47,343 --> 01:36:49,583
You'd tell someone if
you weren't sure about that, right?

881
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:53,099
Like, if she'd been hurting you somehow.

882
01:36:56,769 --> 01:36:59,022
Did she ever treat you
like you're someone else?

883
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:01,709
- I'm not somebody else.
- No, I know, I know.

884
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:02,567
I'm Aidan.

885
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,986
- Hey, I know.
- We don't need anyone else.

886
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:06,195
That's right.

887
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:11,034
We don't need you,
that doctor or anyone else.

888
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:12,868
Okay?

889
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:16,663
Okay.

890
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:31,595
What are you doing?

891
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:35,975
I was just gonna take a picture of you.

892
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:37,601
No.

893
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:43,107
- It'll be for your mom.
- No.

894
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:45,651
Why not? Why not? What's wrong
with taking your picture?

895
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:49,489
I'll tell you what's wrong
if you promise not to take it.

896
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:51,574
But that's only if you promise.

897
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:53,659
Fine. I promise.

898
01:38:03,503 --> 01:38:04,754

Are you here?

906
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:12,405
- You're home!
- Oh, God.

907
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:15,616
What are you doing here?
I thought you were at the hospital.

908
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:17,285
No. I'm here, Mommy.

909
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:20,996
What did you say?

910
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:22,915
I said I'm here.

But his coat.

914
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:44,562
He went away.
You wanna watch some TV with me?

915
01:39:45,605 --> 01:39:46,981
Uh.

01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:54,280
I, uh, I just have to get
something from the car. Okay?

Max?

920
01:41:35,131 --> 01:41:39,051
Goldfish must have
water in order to exist.

921
01:41:39,635 --> 01:41:42,179
But goldfish hate cats.

922
01:41:48,561 --> 01:41:51,814
While on the other hand, cats hate water.

923
01:42:26,724 --> 01:42:27,724
Rachel.

924
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:32,813
Are you sleeping, Rachel?

925
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:37,652
I am. She makes me sleep all the time now.

926
01:42:39,028 --> 01:42:40,279
Aidan.

927
01:42:40,738 --> 01:42:43,282
Shh. Just keep sleeping, Rachel.

928
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:46,994
So she can't hear us. It's the only way.

929
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:48,996
You know you have to show her, Rachel.

930
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:50,956
Show her she can't stay.

931
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:52,957
In you.

932
01:42:54,627 --> 01:42:56,921
How? How do I do that?

933
01:42:58,255 --> 01:42:59,840
Take me to where she's afraid of.

934
01:43:01,676 --> 01:43:02,968
You know where she's afraid of.

935
01:43:04,637 --> 01:43:05,721
Take me there

936
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:08,390
and kill me.

937
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:12,228
- Aidan, no.
- Shh. Rachel, keep sleeping.

938
01:43:12,311 --> 01:43:14,438
She won't stay if
she knows you'll kill me.

939
01:43:16,315 --> 01:43:20,152
- It's the only way.
- I can't do it. I can't.

940
01:43:25,491 --> 01:43:26,534
Then she stays.

941
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:30,996
She's heard us.

942
01:43:53,644 --> 01:43:54,644
Honey?

943
01:43:55,604 --> 01:43:57,440
I thought you were sleeping, Mommy.

944
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:02,570
I was, but I had a bad dream.

945
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:04,405
You must've had a nightmare.

946
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:07,783
It's all right. We all have them.

947
01:44:11,412 --> 01:44:12,705
Will you stay with me now?

948
01:44:14,039 --> 01:44:15,039
Stay?

949
01:44:15,583 --> 01:44:16,751
Stay for always.

950
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:22,047
Yeah. Yeah.

951
01:44:22,298 --> 01:44:24,967
Alrighty. Let's watch some TV together.

952
01:44:25,551 --> 01:44:26,594
Oh.

953
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,430
It's kind of late, honey.

954
01:44:32,016 --> 01:44:33,684
Don't you think you should sleep?

955
01:44:38,606 --> 01:44:39,648
I never sleep.

956
01:44:46,822 --> 01:44:48,866
Then let Mommy make you something.

957
01:46:08,904 --> 01:46:11,991
Something wrong? You seem sad.

958
01:46:14,368 --> 01:46:16,120
No, honey, I'm not sad.

959
01:46:17,997 --> 01:46:19,415
I'm just tired, that's all.

960
01:46:22,585 --> 01:46:24,545
Well, now you have me to protect you.

What are you doing?

I love you, Mommy.

1042
02:00:25,301 --> 02:00:26,678
Promise me something?

02:00:35,687 --> 02:00:36,896
At least for a while.
