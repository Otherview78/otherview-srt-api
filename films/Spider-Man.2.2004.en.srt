1
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,900
She looks at me every day.

2
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:05,860
Mary Jane Watson.

3
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,060
Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.

4
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,035
But she can never know.

5
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:15,643
I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.

6
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,108
A life she can never be a part of.

7
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,576
Who am I?

8
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:22,342
I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.

9
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:25,509
And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.

10
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:27,245
Parker. Parker!

11
00:03:27,722 --> 00:03:29,656
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

12
00:03:31,092 --> 00:03:33,754
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

13
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:36,863
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

14
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:39,295
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

15
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:42,265
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

16
00:03:42,437 --> 00:03:46,737
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

17
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:50,000
I told you,
I don't understand that language.

18
00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:52,112
- Speak English.
- You can't make pizza.

19
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,145
I can't?
I've been making pizza five years.

20
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:57,113
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

21
00:03:57,285 --> 00:04:00,220
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...

22
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:03,016
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

23
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:06,388
- Why didn't you send Saleem?
- Saleem was deported yesterday.

24
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:08,552
- Look... Smiley.
- What about my cheese pizza?

25
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,722
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

26
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,031
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

27
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:18,268
This is your last chance.

28
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:23,172
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.

29
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:26,746
Go!

30
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:50,393
Hey, what, are you stupid?

31
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:15,590
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!

32
00:05:24,305 --> 00:05:25,897
I'm gonna get it!

33
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:43,854
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

34
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:45,287
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

35
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:47,254
See you.

36
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:49,590
Way to go, Spidey!

37
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,733
Pizza time.

38
00:07:05,473 --> 00:07:07,065
You're late.

39
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:09,340
I'm not paying for those.

40
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:30,087
Elevator.

41
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:50,408
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

42
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:55,079
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

43
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:57,224
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

44
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:59,883
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.

45
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:02,586
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.

46
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:13,104
You're fired.

47
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:15,465
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?

48
00:08:15,643 --> 00:08:17,133
Dogs catching Frisbees?

49
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:19,609
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

50
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:21,009
- Boss.
- Not now.

51
00:08:21,182 --> 00:08:23,912
The Bugle could show another side
of New York for a change.

52
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:27,020
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

53
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:30,589
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you... Still not now!

54
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:33,352
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

55
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:35,257
He won't let me take
any more pictures.

56
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,022
You turned the whole city
against him.

57
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:38,688
A fact I'm very proud of.

58
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:42,632
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

59
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:46,171
- It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
- Thanks for the good news.

60
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,673
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I really need the money.

61
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:52,876
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.

62
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:54,742
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

63
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,612
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

64
00:08:57,785 --> 00:08:59,685
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

65
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:02,152
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous.

66
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:04,188
All right, Mr. Jameson.

67
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:08,054
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

68
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:09,856
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

69
00:09:10,031 --> 00:09:11,589
I told you, he's not a menace.

70
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,358
- I told you...
- I'll take care of it.

71
00:09:13,534 --> 00:09:15,161
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.

72
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,832
That's outrageous.

73
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:18,972
Done. Give this to the girl.

74
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,334
Thank you. Bye-bye.

75
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:22,298
Hi.

76
00:09:22,543 --> 00:09:23,976
Hey, Pete.

77
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:30,782
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

78
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:33,087
- Right.
- Sorry.

79
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:35,516
Hey.

80
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:37,581
Chin up, okay?

81
00:09:50,738 --> 00:09:52,171
Watch it, jerk!

82
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:04,818
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

83
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:06,510
Where were you headed, Parker?

84
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:07,982
To your class.

85
00:10:08,156 --> 00:10:09,987
My class is over.

86
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:12,353
See me standing here?

87
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:16,327
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.

88
00:10:16,497 --> 00:10:17,828
Then be here.

89
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,667
Look at you, Peter.

90
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:25,536
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

91
00:10:25,706 --> 00:10:28,607
You always appear exhausted.

92
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:32,103
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

93
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,443
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

94
00:10:35,616 --> 00:10:38,744
Planning is not a major
at this university.

95
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:44,080
Octavius is a friend of mine.

96
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:46,416
Better do your research, Parker.

97
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:49,924
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

98
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:13,446
Surprise!

99
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:15,555
Well, say something.

100
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:16,985
What's the occasion?

101
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:19,718
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!

102
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:23,059
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

103
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:26,730
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

104
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:28,835
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.

105
00:11:29,337 --> 00:11:30,702
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

106
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:32,099
Long time, no see.

107
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:36,135
So how's the play?
I read a great review.

108
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,005
It's going fine. It's going good.

109
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:39,441
She's brilliant in it.

110
00:11:39,614 --> 00:11:41,275
Harry sent me roses.

111
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:44,009
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

112
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:47,351
I've been busy.

113
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:51,082
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

114
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:53,227
The less you see of that man,
the better.

115
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:56,852
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

116
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:58,293
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

117
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:00,593
So how are things going at Oscorp?

118
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:03,635
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

119
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:06,034
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

120
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:10,303
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

121
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:11,775
Thank you.

122
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,945
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

123
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:18,551
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?

124
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,981
You'd introduce me?

125
00:12:20,154 --> 00:12:23,351
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...

126
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:25,549
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

127
00:12:25,726 --> 00:12:27,660
M.J., could you give me a hand?

128
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:31,623
She's waiting for you, pal.

129
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,561
What do you mean?

130
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:36,202
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

131
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:38,102
However you want to look at it.

132
00:12:38,472 --> 00:12:40,633
I don't have time for girls right now.

133
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:42,139
Why, are you dead?

134
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,902
I've been kind of busy.

135
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:45,670
Taking pictures of your friend?

136
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:48,672
Could we get off that subject?

137
00:12:49,183 --> 00:12:52,175
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

138
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:54,014
Then be honest with me.

139
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:57,151
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

140
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:04,328
Peter, don't you understand
how I feel?

141
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:06,432
I want this guy dead.

142
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,398
The same way you want the guy
who killed your Uncle Ben dead.

143
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:20,380
I'm sorry. I don't mean to
rag on you on your birthday.

144
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,575
You're my buddy, you know that.

145
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:27,884
You're family, Pete.

146
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:32,159
My father loved you.
You were like a son to him.

147
00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:39,966
Thank you, Harry.

148
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:15,258
May.

149
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:16,994
Oh, what, Ben?

150
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:20,273
Wait.

151
00:14:20,508 --> 00:14:21,907
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.

152
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:27,542
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

153
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,684
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

154
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,780
Did they have a good time?

155
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:35,550
I'm sure they did.

156
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:41,225
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.

157
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:46,994
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

158
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:48,962
I'm worried about you.

159
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:54,363
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

160
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:56,976
Oh, my. You did?

161
00:14:57,478 --> 00:14:58,809
Oh, well.

162
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,412
So?

163
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:02,642
I'm a little behind.

164
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:05,346
Everybody is.

165
00:15:06,053 --> 00:15:09,022
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

166
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,921
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

167
00:15:14,695 --> 00:15:17,220
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

168
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:19,190
You need it more than I do.

169
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:21,891
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!

170
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:24,094
You can take this money from me.

171
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:27,001
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

172
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:29,665
And don't you dare leave it here.

173
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:31,778
Oh, I'm sorry.

174
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,507
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.

175
00:15:38,652 --> 00:15:43,589
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

176
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:48,121
I think to myself at times...

177
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:53,596
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...

178
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:56,660
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

179
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,802
Now...

180
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:09,444
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.

181
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:25,688
Hey.

182
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:27,959
Hey. You're still here.

183
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:30,695
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

184
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:34,238
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

185
00:16:34,408 --> 00:16:38,367
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

186
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:39,945
The photographer liked my face.

187
00:16:40,114 --> 00:16:42,981
I was only supposed to be
in the catalogue.

188
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,642
Then I got the part in the play.
Everything at once.

189
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,811
Your dream came true.

190
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:51,151
How about yours?

191
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,252
I'm fine.

192
00:16:58,332 --> 00:17:00,698
I wish you'd come see the play.

193
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:03,063
You're the one who
always encouraged me.

194
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:05,804
I plan to.

195
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:13,176
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

196
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,179
Oh, boy, yeah.

197
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:20,753
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

198
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:26,920
Nothing.

199
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:33,132
Do you want to say something?

200
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:40,731
I...

201
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,942
...was...

202
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:52,214
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.

203
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:03,387
You're such a mystery.

204
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:15,438
Peter.

205
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:18,368
What?

206
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,079
Happy birthday.

207
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:35,922
I'm seeing somebody now.

208
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:40,024
- Therapy.
- No.

209
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:41,995
A person, a man.

210
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:44,535
You mean, like a boyfriend?

211
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:47,367
Well, like I like him.

212
00:18:50,577 --> 00:18:51,942
What?

213
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:54,304
Nothing.

214
00:18:55,182 --> 00:18:58,413
That's good, you know?
Companionship...

215
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,781
May be more than that.

216
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,414
More?

217
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:06,625
I don't know.

218
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:10,191
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.

219
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:16,202
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.

220
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:18,866
Don't disappoint me.

221
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:21,968
I won't.

222
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,714
Rent.

223
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:44,224
- Hi.
- Hi. What's "hi"?

224
00:19:44,398 --> 00:19:45,922
Can I spend it?

225
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,567
I have a paycheck due this week
and...

226
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:52,069
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as...

227
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:55,730
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

228
00:19:56,343 --> 00:20:00,803
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All I got
is this 20 for the rest of the week.

229
00:20:01,515 --> 00:20:03,073
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

230
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:08,085
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

231
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,657
- Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
- Hi, Pete.

232
00:21:06,513 --> 00:21:08,105
Hello?

233
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:17,184
Rent?

234
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:24,662
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

235
00:21:24,832 --> 00:21:28,825
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

236
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:30,629
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

237
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:32,601
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.

238
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:34,001
Who do we have here?

239
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:35,903
This is my good friend
I called you about.

240
00:21:36,076 --> 00:21:37,737
He got me through
high-school science.

241
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:40,971
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for...

242
00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:42,581
I know what you're doing here...

243
00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:44,944
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.

244
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,750
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...

245
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:50,253
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

246
00:21:50,424 --> 00:21:53,791
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

247
00:21:53,961 --> 00:21:58,557
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

248
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:02,758
Interesting fellow, your friend.

249
00:22:03,403 --> 00:22:05,098
I won't take much of your time.

250
00:22:05,272 --> 00:22:09,606
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

251
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,503
He also tells me you're lazy.

252
00:22:13,513 --> 00:22:14,741
I'm trying to do better.

253
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:18,510
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

254
00:22:18,852 --> 00:22:22,015
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

255
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:24,180
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

256
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:26,883
Otto, your lunch is ready.

257
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,823
- This is my wife, Rosie.
- Hello.

258
00:22:28,996 --> 00:22:32,488
This is Peter Parker. Connors' student.
The one who falls asleep in class.

259
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,726
I always fell asleep in physics class.

260
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:38,736
- Nice to meet you, Peter.
- Good to meet you.

261
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:40,806
Excuse me.

262
00:22:42,976 --> 00:22:44,204
Is that it?

263
00:22:44,378 --> 00:22:48,246
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

264
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:51,482
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

265
00:22:51,652 --> 00:22:53,017
Sympathetic frequencies.

266
00:22:53,186 --> 00:22:55,211
Harmonic reinforcement?

267
00:22:55,555 --> 00:22:57,284
Go on.

268
00:22:57,858 --> 00:23:01,385
An exponential increase
in energy output.

269
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:03,222
A huge amount of energy.

270
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:07,561
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

271
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:10,897
It's all so amazing. If it works,
it could change the way we live.

272
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:13,096
It is amazing, and it will work.

273
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:16,800
Are you sure you could stabilize
the fusion reaction?

274
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:20,640
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

275
00:23:20,814 --> 00:23:22,714
This is my life's work.

276
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:26,046
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

277
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:28,449
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to question you.

278
00:23:28,622 --> 00:23:32,023
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

279
00:23:32,192 --> 00:23:33,989
You can sleep soundly tonight.

280
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:35,890
Otto's done his homework.

281
00:23:36,063 --> 00:23:39,157
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

282
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:41,828
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

283
00:23:42,002 --> 00:23:44,197
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

284
00:23:44,638 --> 00:23:46,765
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

285
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,267
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the 5th?

286
00:23:49,443 --> 00:23:52,879
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

287
00:23:53,046 --> 00:23:55,412
Rosie, I love this boy.

288
00:23:55,582 --> 00:23:59,348
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

289
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,978
Well...

290
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,489
I don't really know.

291
00:24:04,658 --> 00:24:07,752
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

292
00:24:07,995 --> 00:24:10,964
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

293
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:13,156
Love should never be a secret.

294
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:16,564
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

295
00:24:17,204 --> 00:24:18,831
...gonna make you sick.

296
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:21,404
I finally got lucky in love.

297
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:22,906
We both did.

298
00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:26,773
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

299
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:30,644
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

300
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:34,082
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

301
00:24:34,254 --> 00:24:37,417
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

302
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:39,923
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

303
00:24:41,461 --> 00:24:43,895
Time present and time past

304
00:24:44,064 --> 00:24:46,089
- Are both perhaps present
- Perhaps present

305
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:48,564
- In time future
- In time future

306
00:24:48,735 --> 00:24:50,669
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

307
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:52,065
- Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.

308
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:55,766
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

309
00:24:56,343 --> 00:25:00,302
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

310
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:02,276
Poetry.

311
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,407
Never fails.

312
00:25:09,923 --> 00:25:12,858
A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie

313
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:15,392
Brightest green were all her garments

314
00:25:15,562 --> 00:25:17,928
And her hair was like the sunshine

315
00:25:18,331 --> 00:25:20,993
Day by day he gazed upon her

316
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:19,852
Rent!

317
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:23,456
Where is my money?!

318
00:26:49,122 --> 00:26:51,420
You seem jittery tonight.

319
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:53,252
You never know who's coming.

320
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:11,677
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

321
00:27:28,862 --> 00:27:30,193
How'd you do that?

322
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,566
Work out, plenty of rest.

323
00:27:35,735 --> 00:27:37,532
You know, eat your green vegetables.

324
00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:41,929
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

325
00:27:44,744 --> 00:27:46,109
Come on. Go.

326
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:50,448
Keep it steady.

327
00:28:12,973 --> 00:28:14,463
It's a web.

328
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:17,304
Go, Spidey, go!

329
00:28:25,318 --> 00:28:26,649
We got trouble!

330
00:28:45,272 --> 00:28:47,240
Get me down!

331
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,343
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

332
00:28:53,513 --> 00:28:56,812
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

333
00:28:56,983 --> 00:28:59,110
Then you think we should
forgive them?

334
00:29:01,988 --> 00:29:03,649
Yes.

335
00:29:04,157 --> 00:29:05,647
I mean, no.

336
00:29:09,963 --> 00:29:14,229
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

337
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:16,232
Whatever.

338
00:29:18,838 --> 00:29:20,430
Shoelace.

339
00:29:24,944 --> 00:29:26,571
You might want to...

340
00:29:31,985 --> 00:29:36,115
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I've come to see the show.

341
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:40,157
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

342
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:43,558
It helps maintain the illusion.

343
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:47,332
I understand.

344
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:51,737
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

345
00:29:51,905 --> 00:29:53,395
But not to come late.

346
00:29:55,842 --> 00:29:59,300
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the...

347
00:30:09,022 --> 00:30:10,580
Listen, can't you...?

348
00:30:25,205 --> 00:30:28,140
A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man

349
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:31,300
A-does whatever a spider can

350
00:30:31,478 --> 00:30:34,470
A-spins a web, any size

351
00:30:34,647 --> 00:30:37,013
Catches thieves a-just like flies

352
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:40,414
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man

353
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:58,829
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

354
00:30:59,005 --> 00:31:00,370
Yeah, I'm sure.

355
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,440
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.

356
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:04,338
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.

357
00:31:06,813 --> 00:31:09,407
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

358
00:31:10,717 --> 00:31:12,048
What are you doing here?

359
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,428
You hungry?

360
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:29,829
Starved.

361
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,388
What was that?

362
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,623
Okay.

363
00:33:04,163 --> 00:33:05,960
How you doing?

364
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:08,033
Good.

365
00:33:10,537 --> 00:33:14,132
I just wanna say,
I really like what you do.

366
00:33:14,807 --> 00:33:17,105
- Think it's great.
- Thanks.

367
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:21,441
I'm with Weisenhower,
Anderson, Nichols & Knudsen...

368
00:33:21,614 --> 00:33:23,309
...PR firm in the building...

369
00:33:23,483 --> 00:33:26,316
...and I just wanna say I think
the image you have is fantastic.

370
00:33:26,486 --> 00:33:29,319
It's really put together.
The costume. The... this thing.

371
00:33:29,489 --> 00:33:32,617
I mean, it's really put together.
It's great.

372
00:33:35,094 --> 00:33:37,028
I think you could do more
than print though.

373
00:33:37,196 --> 00:33:39,926
I think you might wanna try some TV,
you know?

374
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:42,260
Can I riff for you?
Come up with a couple ideas?

375
00:33:42,435 --> 00:33:45,199
Just what my company would do?
Let's see, what do I got?

376
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:48,101
How about a children's book?
You could...

377
00:33:48,274 --> 00:33:51,107
Like Charlotte's Web,
but without the pig. That kind of thing.

378
00:33:51,277 --> 00:33:53,643
How about a line of hammocks?

379
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:56,145
Because it's kind of a web thing.

380
00:33:56,316 --> 00:34:00,753
You could do a men's cologne
called Thwip.

381
00:34:01,888 --> 00:34:03,549
Let me give you a card.

382
00:34:03,723 --> 00:34:06,521
I don't have any pockets.

383
00:34:06,693 --> 00:34:08,126
Yeah.

384
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:12,990
Well, we're right in the building.

385
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,078
That doesn't help.
I do that all the time.

386
00:34:26,913 --> 00:34:28,938
- Slow elevator.
- Yeah.

387
00:34:51,537 --> 00:34:54,005
Thus, the second-order term...

388
00:34:54,173 --> 00:34:56,903
...in the expansion of
the exact order...

389
00:34:57,076 --> 00:35:00,409
...is identical to the second order...

390
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,072
...calculated from first-order
perturbation energy.

391
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,310
Since we are free to choose
an arbitrary origin for our energy...

392
00:35:30,743 --> 00:35:33,439
Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.

393
00:35:34,313 --> 00:35:35,541
Hi, M.J.

394
00:35:35,715 --> 00:35:37,012
This is Peter.

395
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,610
I was on my way to your show and...

396
00:35:41,921 --> 00:35:45,357
Well, I was on my bike...

397
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:49,885
Are you there?

398
00:35:52,532 --> 00:35:55,399
I really was planning on it all day.

399
00:35:56,669 --> 00:35:58,227
And...

400
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,971
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

401
00:36:02,308 --> 00:36:03,935
Bingo.

402
00:36:04,944 --> 00:36:06,639
It's amazing, isn't it?

403
00:36:07,547 --> 00:36:10,414
How complicated a simple thing...

404
00:36:11,617 --> 00:36:15,713
...like being someplace at 8:00
can become.

405
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:23,461
Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.

406
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,258
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

407
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:28,957
Your time has expired.

408
00:36:29,135 --> 00:36:33,401
Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.

409
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:45,175
I wanna tell you the truth.

410
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,753
Here it is.

411
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:51,416
I'm Spider-Man.

412
00:36:52,592 --> 00:36:53,957
Weird, huh?

413
00:36:55,828 --> 00:36:58,126
Now you know
why I can't be with you.

414
00:36:59,265 --> 00:37:03,929
If my enemies found out about you...

415
00:37:06,773 --> 00:37:10,004
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

416
00:37:15,882 --> 00:37:18,874
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

417
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:31,658
Ladies and gentlemen...

418
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:35,665
...my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

419
00:37:35,835 --> 00:37:37,496
But first, before we start...

420
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:42,039
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

421
00:37:42,475 --> 00:37:43,965
Because we found the rubber band.

422
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:50,081
It's a terrible joke.

423
00:37:50,249 --> 00:37:51,978
But thank you for coming.

424
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:53,546
Today...

425
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:58,247
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

426
00:37:58,558 --> 00:38:03,757
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.

427
00:38:05,097 --> 00:38:08,362
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

428
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:19,034
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...

429
00:38:19,212 --> 00:38:22,670
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

430
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:25,374
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

431
00:39:10,062 --> 00:39:14,829
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

432
00:39:15,434 --> 00:39:18,232
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...

433
00:39:18,404 --> 00:39:22,500
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...

434
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:25,508
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.

435
00:39:25,678 --> 00:39:28,112
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...

436
00:39:28,281 --> 00:39:30,078
...is as advanced as you suggest...

437
00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:32,274
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

438
00:39:32,451 --> 00:39:33,713
How right you are.

439
00:39:33,886 --> 00:39:35,945
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...

440
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:38,488
...to protect
my higher brain function.

441
00:39:38,658 --> 00:39:43,027
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

442
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,761
And now on to the main event.

443
00:39:45,932 --> 00:39:47,832
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

444
00:40:07,453 --> 00:40:11,287
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

445
00:40:11,457 --> 00:40:14,585
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

446
00:40:15,227 --> 00:40:19,493
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp Industries for providing it.

447
00:40:19,665 --> 00:40:21,394
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

448
00:40:35,348 --> 00:40:36,747
Ladies and gentlemen...

449
00:40:39,418 --> 00:40:41,249
...fasten your seat belts.

450
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:02,599
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

451
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,713
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

452
00:41:10,883 --> 00:41:12,111
Thank you.

453
00:41:12,284 --> 00:41:14,218
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

454
00:41:21,894 --> 00:41:23,725
The power of the sun...

455
00:41:24,363 --> 00:41:26,490
...in the palm of my hand.

456
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,680
Keep calm! It's only a spike!

457
00:41:50,856 --> 00:41:52,687
It’ll soon stabilize!

458
00:41:58,364 --> 00:42:01,265
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.

459
00:42:06,939 --> 00:42:08,270
We have a containment breach!

460
00:42:11,043 --> 00:42:13,102
Otto, please get back!

461
00:42:14,146 --> 00:42:16,944
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

462
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:19,943
It will stabilize! It's under control!

463
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:21,984
I'm in charge here!

464
00:42:22,154 --> 00:42:25,021
It's my money! I'm in con...

465
00:42:28,627 --> 00:42:30,652
This doesn't change anything.

466
00:42:33,966 --> 00:42:36,332
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.

467
00:42:36,769 --> 00:42:37,997
No!

468
00:42:56,956 --> 00:42:58,514
Rosie!

469
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:30,383
Watch it.

470
00:43:30,556 --> 00:43:31,784
That was too close.

471
00:43:31,957 --> 00:43:36,018
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

472
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:42,832
I'm ruined.

473
00:43:44,503 --> 00:43:46,994
I have nothing left,
except Spider-Man.

474
00:43:47,173 --> 00:43:48,834
He saved your life, sir.

475
00:43:49,275 --> 00:43:51,675
He humiliated me by touching me.

476
00:43:51,844 --> 00:43:54,438
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

477
00:43:54,613 --> 00:43:56,513
What was he doing here anyway?

478
00:44:12,965 --> 00:44:15,365
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...

479
00:44:15,534 --> 00:44:17,661
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...

480
00:44:17,836 --> 00:44:20,396
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

481
00:44:20,573 --> 00:44:22,734
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

482
00:44:22,908 --> 00:44:25,877
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...

483
00:44:26,045 --> 00:44:28,411
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...

484
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:31,846
...with posterior spinal fusion
from 7-T1 to T12.

485
00:44:32,117 --> 00:44:33,414
We're ready, doctor.

486
00:44:36,722 --> 00:44:38,553
Anybody here take shop class?

487
00:45:17,463 --> 00:45:19,124
No! No! No!

488
00:45:22,201 --> 00:45:24,533
Help me! Help me!

489
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:41,421
No!

490
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:35,851
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumors.

491
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:38,182
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

492
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,154
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

493
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:44,318
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

494
00:47:44,796 --> 00:47:49,460
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

495
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:50,862
Hoffman!

496
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:54,371
What are we gonna call this guy?

497
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,769
- "Dr. Octopus."
- That's crap.

498
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:58,499
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!

499
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,771
- "Dr. Strange."
- That's pretty good.

500
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:05,777
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

501
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,246
- I like it.
- Of course you do.

502
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:12,220
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

503
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,324
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?

504
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:16,153
Get out.

505
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:18,123
Chief, I found Parker.

506
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:20,491
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.

507
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:22,997
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

508
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:24,465
I heard Spider-Man was there.

509
00:48:25,637 --> 00:48:28,231
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

510
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,737
Chief, the planetarium party.

511
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:31,569
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

512
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,301
What do you know
about high society?

513
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:35,776
- Oh. Well, I...
- Don't answer that.

514
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:39,383
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

515
00:48:39,551 --> 00:48:42,520
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

516
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:44,450
Could you pay me in advance?

517
00:48:53,498 --> 00:48:55,966
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

518
00:48:56,134 --> 00:48:58,762
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.

519
00:49:13,852 --> 00:49:15,581
My Rosie's dead.

520
00:49:17,756 --> 00:49:19,519
My dream is dead.

521
00:49:23,228 --> 00:49:24,490
And these...

522
00:49:26,498 --> 00:49:29,990
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

523
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:34,236
...along with me.

524
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:44,808
Something...

525
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:47,774
...in my head.

526
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:53,014
Something talking.

527
00:49:57,061 --> 00:49:58,528
The inhibitor chip!

528
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:03,491
Gone.

529
00:50:08,273 --> 00:50:09,570
Rebuild.

530
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:14,638
No.

531
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:17,280
Peter was right.

532
00:50:19,617 --> 00:50:21,209
I miscalculated.

533
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:29,851
I couldn't have miscalculated.

534
00:50:30,962 --> 00:50:32,896
It was working, wasn't it?

535
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:39,201
Yes.

536
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:43,263
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

537
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:45,705
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

538
00:50:46,578 --> 00:50:48,409
But we need money.

539
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:51,512
Steal it?

540
00:50:51,683 --> 00:50:53,446
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

541
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,451
That's right.

542
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:02,588
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

543
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:07,858
We'll do it here.

544
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,899
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

545
00:51:12,203 --> 00:51:14,694
Nothing will stand in our way.

546
00:51:14,873 --> 00:51:16,204
Nothing!

547
00:51:21,613 --> 00:51:24,275
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.

548
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:26,212
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

549
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:28,648
Yes, but I'm afraid...

550
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:31,880
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

551
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:35,682
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.

552
00:51:35,894 --> 00:51:37,225
You are?

553
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,531
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...

554
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:48,297
...a new supersaver account
with us today.

555
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:49,735
But the fact is...

556
00:51:49,908 --> 00:51:54,242
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

557
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:56,437
Well...

558
00:51:58,216 --> 00:52:00,047
At least we get the toaster.

559
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:04,245
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.

560
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:08,422
Oh, yes, I see.

561
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:11,521
Okay.

562
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:16,692
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

563
00:52:34,018 --> 00:52:35,349
Peter?

564
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:39,156
Don't leave me.

565
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:42,392
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

566
00:52:42,894 --> 00:52:44,122
Hold it!

567
00:52:44,896 --> 00:52:47,558
Put your arms up! All of them!

568
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:12,219
Here's your change!

569
00:53:22,133 --> 00:53:23,657
Oh, no. Come on!

570
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:39,276
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.

571
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,042
Not anymore.

572
00:54:10,782 --> 00:54:12,579
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!

573
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:18,352
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.

574
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,023
Wait a second.

575
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:44,009
- Hand her over.
- Of course.

576
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,044
Easy, now.

577
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:49,447
Butterfingers.

578
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:02,994
Look out!

579
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:07,127
Help me!

580
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,834
- Help me!
- I'm coming!

581
00:55:17,081 --> 00:55:18,981
Hang on!

582
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:52,147
Help!

583
00:56:17,275 --> 00:56:18,936
Thank you.

584
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,511
Aunt May.

585
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:26,673
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

586
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:29,877
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

587
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:37,053
Come on.

588
00:56:41,032 --> 00:56:43,159
Shame on you.

589
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:17,093
There you go.

590
00:57:18,069 --> 00:57:21,402
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

591
00:57:21,572 --> 00:57:22,834
We sure showed him.

592
00:57:23,007 --> 00:57:24,804
What do you mean, "we"?

593
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:31,313
- Take me with you, Spider-Man.
- Take me.

594
00:57:58,843 --> 00:58:01,505
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.

595
00:58:02,513 --> 00:58:04,413
Penny! Over here!

596
00:58:09,787 --> 00:58:11,311
Leave it.

597
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,850
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

598
00:58:18,029 --> 00:58:19,360
Why? It's a party.

599
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:22,465
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...

600
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:25,966
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

601
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,997
Not to mention your friend the bug.

602
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:29,800
Not tonight, Harry.

603
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:33,501
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24-7.

604
00:58:33,978 --> 00:58:35,411
Parker!

605
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,308
Parker!

606
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,908
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

607
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:43,076
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?

608
00:58:43,254 --> 00:58:45,188
Get a shot of my wife
with the minister.

609
00:58:45,623 --> 00:58:46,885
Beautiful tie.

610
00:58:47,058 --> 00:58:49,322
Get a shot of us with the DA.

611
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,217
Beautiful dress.

612
00:58:51,662 --> 00:58:54,392
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

613
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:57,325
Wife.

614
00:58:59,303 --> 00:59:01,567
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

615
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:04,833
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...

616
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:07,204
...is pleased to present
our guest of honor.

617
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:11,144
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

618
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:15,412
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...

619
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:17,451
...Captain John Jameson.

620
01:00:02,133 --> 01:00:03,657
Hi.

621
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:09,337
- You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.

622
01:00:09,507 --> 01:00:11,737
But there was a disturbance.

623
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:13,206
I don't know you.

624
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:19,081
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

625
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:21,645
I've been reading poetry lately.

626
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:23,184
Whatever that means.

627
01:00:23,687 --> 01:00:27,179
Day by day he gazed upon her

628
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:30,458
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day...

629
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:32,493
Don't start.

630
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:35,761
Can I get you a drink?

631
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:37,662
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.

632
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:39,962
John.

633
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:44,039
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

634
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:47,177
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

635
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:49,835
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.

636
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:51,242
Even my father.

637
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:55,179
He came backstage to borrow cash.

638
01:00:56,821 --> 01:01:01,190
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...

639
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:03,519
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.

640
01:01:05,196 --> 01:01:06,788
After all these years...

641
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:10,692
...he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.

642
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:39,560
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

643
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:42,995
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.

644
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:45,226
- Take it easy.
- Don't push me.

645
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:47,199
Don't act like you're my friend.

646
01:01:47,972 --> 01:01:49,940
You stole M.J. from me.

647
01:01:50,341 --> 01:01:52,241
You stole my father's love.

648
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:57,904
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

649
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:01,379
Huh? Isn't that right?

650
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,349
Huh, brother?

651
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:17,061
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...

652
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:22,228
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.

653
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,217
What a surprise.

654
01:02:34,385 --> 01:02:37,320
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

655
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:06,713
Oh, no. No!

656
01:03:17,728 --> 01:03:19,889
Why is this happening to me?

657
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,774
You told him yes? Just that fast?

658
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:47,382
It felt right.

659
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:50,286
Well, you might congratulate me.

660
01:04:50,454 --> 01:04:52,354
Congratulations.

661
01:04:52,523 --> 01:04:54,616
Good luck in the world.

662
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:57,790
John loves me.

663
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:01,658
My father always said,
"You'll never be worth anything.

664
01:05:01,832 --> 01:05:03,424
No man will ever want you."

665
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,932
So, what, you're gonna spend
the rest of your life...

666
01:05:06,103 --> 01:05:09,334
...trying to prove something
to your father?

667
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:11,531
Do you really love this guy?

668
01:05:12,276 --> 01:05:14,836
- Very much.
- "Very much"?

669
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:16,502
That just doesn't fly.

670
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,114
I mean, if you really love the guy,
then the answer is:

671
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:21,183
"Do I love him? I adore him.

672
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:23,850
He's my comfortable afghan.

673
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:26,216
He's all I can think about.

674
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:30,451
Everything he is, everything he says,
everything he does...

675
01:05:30,627 --> 01:05:35,724
...to me, for me, with me,
is sweet kisses.

676
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:39,999
He makes up for all the grief
and pain I've ever had...

677
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:43,139
...and in the dark of the night,
he is there."

678
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:46,071
That's the answer I need.

679
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:49,076
Not just "I love him very much."

680
01:05:51,014 --> 01:05:53,574
You read too many love stories.

681
01:05:53,751 --> 01:05:56,049
What about that perfect kiss
you said you had once?

682
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,711
- The guy you believed in?
- That was a fantasy.

683
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:00,254
That's all he is.

684
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:02,915
But what's wrong with believing
in love stories?

685
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,438
You seem very okay to me.

686
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,505
My diagnosis?

687
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:19,475
It's up here.

688
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:26,206
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

689
01:06:27,384 --> 01:06:30,114
There is one dream where...

690
01:06:30,554 --> 01:06:32,021
...in my dream...

691
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,555
...I'm Spider-Man.

692
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:39,520
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

693
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,692
So you're Spider-Man.

694
01:06:44,868 --> 01:06:46,096
In my dream.

695
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:50,673
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

696
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:52,968
So it's somebody else's dream.

697
01:06:55,045 --> 01:06:58,037
- What's your major? Theater Arts?
- Science.

698
01:06:58,248 --> 01:06:59,476
Connors?

699
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,242
He flunking you?

700
01:07:01,418 --> 01:07:02,885
He says he might.

701
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:04,980
There you go.

702
01:07:13,664 --> 01:07:15,564
What about this friend?

703
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:19,599
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

704
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:24,039
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

705
01:07:24,675 --> 01:07:28,441
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

706
01:07:28,612 --> 01:07:30,375
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

707
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:34,208
I've been there. Who was I?

708
01:07:36,954 --> 01:07:39,514
Identity. Big one.

709
01:07:40,657 --> 01:07:42,989
Me, I go to my shrink.

710
01:07:44,595 --> 01:07:45,619
What does he tell you?

711
01:07:45,796 --> 01:07:50,426
She tells me I need some
strong focus on what I want.

712
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:55,204
And I have to find out
who won't let me have it, why...

713
01:07:56,106 --> 01:08:01,100
...and then I have to tackle that guy,
let him hear me...

714
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:05,112
And one more thing. I have to
make sure I'm right about what I want.

715
01:08:07,284 --> 01:08:08,774
Listen...

716
01:08:08,952 --> 01:08:13,218
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

717
01:08:13,624 --> 01:08:15,353
That's why you keep falling.

718
01:08:17,828 --> 01:08:19,762
You always have a choice, Peter.

719
01:08:21,999 --> 01:08:23,694
I have a choice.

720
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:35,801
All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...

721
01:08:36,914 --> 01:08:38,347
...make me sad.

722
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,784
Can't you understand?

723
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:44,680
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

724
01:08:44,855 --> 01:08:47,824
You know I understand.

725
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:52,593
But I thought you'd learned
the meaning of responsibility.

726
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:57,028
Oh, you don't know how it feels.

727
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:02,163
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...

728
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:06,367
...fairness, justice...

729
01:09:06,677 --> 01:09:11,410
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...

730
01:09:11,682 --> 01:09:15,516
...to take those dreams
out into the world.

731
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,180
I can't live your dreams anymore.

732
01:09:20,357 --> 01:09:22,188
I want a life of my own.

733
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:24,486
You've been given a gift, Peter.

734
01:09:24,795 --> 01:09:29,061
With great power
comes great responsibility.

735
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:35,298
Take my hand, son.

736
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:50,214
No, Uncle Ben.

737
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:54,552
I'm just Peter Parker.

738
01:09:56,326 --> 01:09:58,055
I'm Spider-Man...

739
01:09:58,929 --> 01:10:00,521
...no more.

740
01:10:01,631 --> 01:10:03,030
No more.

741
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:12,741
No more.

742
01:11:42,099 --> 01:11:44,033
- You punk!
- Sorry.

743
01:11:44,601 --> 01:11:46,466
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

744
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:55,138
Hurry up!

745
01:12:04,921 --> 01:12:08,618
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are?

746
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:10,657
Someone, please?

747
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:14,992
.23 electron volts.

748
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:23,137
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

749
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:33,817
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

750
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:36,650
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

751
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:39,653
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

752
01:12:39,823 --> 01:12:41,791
...in a very inexcusable manner.

753
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:44,119
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...

754
01:12:44,294 --> 01:12:47,491
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

755
01:12:47,664 --> 01:12:49,427
That would be hypocrisy.

756
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:52,867
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

757
01:12:58,675 --> 01:13:00,165
"I am glad."

758
01:13:01,011 --> 01:13:02,945
"I am glad."

759
01:13:03,346 --> 01:13:05,041
"I am glad."

760
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:09,077
Are you glad to hear it?

761
01:13:11,288 --> 01:13:13,620
I am glad...

762
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:15,223
...to hear it.

763
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:17,087
In fact, now you mention
the subject...

764
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:20,923
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.

765
01:13:22,866 --> 01:13:25,835
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

766
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:28,027
You could've told me
you were coming.

767
01:13:28,205 --> 01:13:30,537
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

768
01:13:34,277 --> 01:13:35,938
You look different.

769
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:41,617
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.

770
01:13:41,785 --> 01:13:43,650
I do my homework now.

771
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:47,620
You wanna get some chow mein?

772
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:49,190
Peter...

773
01:13:49,626 --> 01:13:51,218
...I'm getting married.

774
01:13:56,132 --> 01:13:58,965
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

775
01:13:59,336 --> 01:14:00,997
And who's the groom?

776
01:14:01,338 --> 01:14:03,033
You hadn't decided yet.

777
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:07,568
You think just because
you saw my play...

778
01:14:07,744 --> 01:14:10,144
...you can talk me out
of getting married?

779
01:14:10,413 --> 01:14:13,610
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

780
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:17,275
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

781
01:14:17,754 --> 01:14:19,312
You're too late.

782
01:14:20,423 --> 01:14:21,788
Will you think about it?

783
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,289
Think about what?

784
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,451
Picking up where we left off.

785
01:14:25,662 --> 01:14:26,959
Where was that?

786
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,621
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.

787
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,198
I don't think it's that simple.

788
01:14:31,368 --> 01:14:33,632
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

789
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,430
You don't understand.

790
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:38,373
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

791
01:14:38,942 --> 01:14:40,341
I'm different.

792
01:14:40,944 --> 01:14:42,935
Punch me, I bleed.

793
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:51,710
I have to go.

794
01:14:58,795 --> 01:15:01,025
I'm getting married in a church.

795
01:15:08,738 --> 01:15:10,330
You are different.

796
01:15:25,155 --> 01:15:28,420
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.

797
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:31,686
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?

798
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:34,887
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.

799
01:15:35,065 --> 01:15:38,228
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.

800
01:15:38,401 --> 01:15:42,098
Don’t tell me you have the head of an extraterrestrial in
there? Because if you do? You're the third guy this week.

801
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:46,472
Where the hell did you get that?

802
01:15:46,643 --> 01:15:48,167
In the garbage.

803
01:15:48,345 --> 01:15:49,778
In the garbage?

804
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:53,442
He must've given up.

805
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:58,583
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.

806
01:15:59,422 --> 01:16:02,550
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

807
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:07,527
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

808
01:16:07,697 --> 01:16:10,791
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.

809
01:16:10,967 --> 01:16:14,027
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.

810
01:16:14,838 --> 01:16:16,806
Your wife is still on that line.

811
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:19,971
Flowers? How much?

812
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:23,807
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

813
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,208
Get plastic.

814
01:16:26,349 --> 01:16:27,976
Gotta go, big story.

815
01:16:39,062 --> 01:16:42,327
Spider-Man
Spider-Man

816
01:16:42,499 --> 01:16:45,491
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

817
01:16:45,668 --> 01:16:49,069
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

818
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:23,202
Come on, man. Get the money.

819
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:26,705
Come on, come on.

820
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:30,568
Help!

821
01:17:34,517 --> 01:17:35,745
Come on!

822
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:44,555
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.

823
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:46,888
He was a peaceful man.

824
01:17:48,932 --> 01:17:51,162
And it was all my doing.

825
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,436
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.

826
01:18:27,604 --> 01:18:29,629
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

827
01:18:30,006 --> 01:18:33,203
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...

828
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:35,537
...and he wanted to drive you.

829
01:18:35,879 --> 01:18:38,404
If only I had stopped him.

830
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:42,045
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

831
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,324
I'm responsible.

832
01:19:03,139 --> 01:19:04,504
For what?

833
01:19:05,508 --> 01:19:07,703
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

834
01:19:07,877 --> 01:19:10,141
But you were at the library.

835
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:12,281
You were doing your homework.

836
01:19:12,448 --> 01:19:15,576
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

837
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:18,046
What do you mean?

838
01:19:18,788 --> 01:19:20,449
I went someplace else.

839
01:19:20,623 --> 01:19:23,615
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...

840
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:27,558
...to buy a car, because I wanted...

841
01:19:28,598 --> 01:19:30,725
...to impress Mary Jane.

842
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:34,894
It happened so fast.

843
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:39,907
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

844
01:19:41,411 --> 01:19:42,844
The thief...

845
01:19:43,846 --> 01:19:45,814
...was running towards me.

846
01:19:47,417 --> 01:19:50,215
I could've stopped him,
but I wanted...

847
01:19:50,954 --> 01:19:52,478
...revenge.

848
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:56,014
I let him go.

849
01:19:57,927 --> 01:20:00,862
I let him get away.

850
01:20:06,703 --> 01:20:08,500
He wanted a car.

851
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:10,935
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

852
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:15,439
Uncle Ben said no...

853
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:19,107
...and then he shot him.

854
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:26,382
Uncle Ben was killed that night...

855
01:20:28,024 --> 01:20:31,084
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.

856
01:20:34,297 --> 01:20:35,559
And I...

857
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:41,027
I held his hand...

858
01:20:41,638 --> 01:20:43,230
...when he died.

859
01:20:50,747 --> 01:20:53,773
I've tried to tell you so many times.

860
01:21:50,373 --> 01:21:52,432
Just one more little chore.

861
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:01,482
Where are you?

862
01:22:03,686 --> 01:22:07,520
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.

863
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:10,420
Your father only obsessed
over his work.

864
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:12,185
Good night, Bernard.

865
01:23:05,581 --> 01:23:06,809
Hello, Harry.

866
01:23:06,983 --> 01:23:09,213
Otto. What do you want?

867
01:23:09,819 --> 01:23:11,377
That precious tritium.

868
01:23:12,288 --> 01:23:13,949
But I need more of it this time.

869
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:19,684
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

870
01:23:23,599 --> 01:23:25,624
Hey! Hey!

871
01:23:25,802 --> 01:23:28,794
Stop! Stop! All right!

872
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:32,969
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

873
01:23:42,885 --> 01:23:46,082
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

874
01:23:46,989 --> 01:23:50,823
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.

875
01:23:50,993 --> 01:23:52,255
How do I find him?

876
01:23:53,563 --> 01:23:55,224
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?

877
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:57,662
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the Bugle.

878
01:23:57,834 --> 01:23:59,324
Make him tell you where he is.

879
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:06,403
Have it ready.

880
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:11,837
Don't hurt Peter!

881
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:27,495
Somebody, help!

882
01:24:28,431 --> 01:24:30,023
Fire!

883
01:24:38,207 --> 01:24:41,199
Alisa, the Chens can't find their
daughter. Have you seen her?

884
01:24:42,612 --> 01:24:45,206
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!

885
01:24:45,982 --> 01:24:48,280
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?

886
01:24:48,451 --> 01:24:51,045
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

887
01:24:51,287 --> 01:24:52,948
Hey, where you going?!

888
01:25:14,143 --> 01:25:15,542
I'm coming!

889
01:25:40,136 --> 01:25:42,934
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

890
01:25:43,105 --> 01:25:45,539
Come on. Come on.

891
01:26:45,801 --> 01:26:47,769
Mama.

892
01:26:59,782 --> 01:27:01,340
You got some guts, kid.

893
01:27:01,517 --> 01:27:06,113
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.

894
01:27:06,389 --> 01:27:07,856
Oh, man.

895
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:14,218
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

896
01:27:14,397 --> 01:27:18,265
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

897
01:27:23,973 --> 01:27:26,965
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?

898
01:27:27,977 --> 01:27:29,444
What I need?

899
01:27:31,781 --> 01:27:34,215
What am I supposed to do?

900
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:42,551
I shouldn't have without...

901
01:27:43,059 --> 01:27:44,321
...knocking.

902
01:27:48,898 --> 01:27:50,490
Come in.

903
01:27:53,569 --> 01:27:56,060
- Hi.
- Hi.

904
01:27:59,742 --> 01:28:02,336
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

905
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:05,779
Okay.

906
01:28:07,216 --> 01:28:09,275
And a glass of milk?

907
01:28:12,021 --> 01:28:13,613
That would be nice.

908
01:28:15,724 --> 01:28:17,851
Okay.

909
01:28:38,047 --> 01:28:39,878
Thank you.

910
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:46,211
You got a message.

911
01:28:47,389 --> 01:28:48,856
It's your aunt.

912
01:28:49,024 --> 01:28:50,787
Thanks.

913
01:29:06,742 --> 01:29:08,073
What's going on?

914
01:29:08,244 --> 01:29:12,044
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

915
01:29:12,214 --> 01:29:15,877
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

916
01:29:16,118 --> 01:29:17,517
Why didn't you tell me?

917
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:20,985
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

918
01:29:21,157 --> 01:29:24,558
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...

919
01:29:24,727 --> 01:29:26,217
...and I'm giving him $5.

920
01:29:26,395 --> 01:29:27,987
That's Henry Jackson?

921
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:30,757
Yes. It's funny what happens
in two years.

922
01:29:31,066 --> 01:29:34,502
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

923
01:29:36,172 --> 01:29:39,437
Listen, about my last visit...

924
01:29:39,608 --> 01:29:41,974
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

925
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:46,706
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

926
01:29:50,186 --> 01:29:53,986
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

927
01:29:54,223 --> 01:29:56,088
And I'm proud of you.

928
01:29:57,159 --> 01:29:59,559
And I thank you, and I...

929
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:03,161
I love you, Peter.

930
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,925
So very, very much.

931
01:30:26,388 --> 01:30:29,380
Hey. Where are all my comic books?

932
01:30:29,558 --> 01:30:32,425
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

933
01:30:35,497 --> 01:30:38,762
- I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you, Henry.

934
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:40,492
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.

935
01:30:40,669 --> 01:30:42,000
You're getting tall.

936
01:30:42,171 --> 01:30:46,267
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.

937
01:30:46,442 --> 01:30:49,468
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?

938
01:30:50,546 --> 01:30:51,843
I used to.

939
01:30:52,014 --> 01:30:53,242
Where is he?

940
01:30:53,415 --> 01:30:57,681
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

941
01:30:59,655 --> 01:31:01,179
He...

942
01:31:03,225 --> 01:31:05,716
...quit.
- Why?

943
01:31:06,635 --> 01:31:08,535
Wanted to try other things.

944
01:31:08,704 --> 01:31:10,296
He'll be back, right?

945
01:31:11,607 --> 01:31:12,869
I don't know.

946
01:31:14,309 --> 01:31:17,301
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.

947
01:31:17,713 --> 01:31:19,476
Spider-Man.

948
01:31:19,648 --> 01:31:23,550
- Why?
- He knows a hero when he sees one.

949
01:31:23,719 --> 01:31:27,450
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...

950
01:31:27,623 --> 01:31:29,682
...saving old girls like me.

951
01:31:29,858 --> 01:31:33,624
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

952
01:31:33,796 --> 01:31:36,663
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...

953
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:39,164
...setting examples for all of us.

954
01:31:39,635 --> 01:31:42,035
Everybody loves a hero.

955
01:31:42,337 --> 01:31:45,773
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

956
01:31:45,941 --> 01:31:50,105
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...

957
01:31:50,279 --> 01:31:51,974
...just to get a glimpse of the one...

958
01:31:52,147 --> 01:31:55,605
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

959
01:31:56,952 --> 01:32:00,183
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

960
01:32:00,956 --> 01:32:02,787
...that keeps us honest...

961
01:32:03,459 --> 01:32:05,120
...gives us strength...

962
01:32:05,461 --> 01:32:07,326
...makes us noble...

963
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:11,957
...and finally allows us to die
with pride.

964
01:32:13,135 --> 01:32:17,265
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...

965
01:32:17,439 --> 01:32:20,203
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

966
01:32:21,977 --> 01:32:23,877
Even our dreams.

967
01:32:25,781 --> 01:32:28,511
Spider-Man did that for Henry...

968
01:32:28,684 --> 01:32:31,118
...and he wonders where he's gone.

969
01:32:32,287 --> 01:32:34,187
He needs him.

970
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:43,293
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

971
01:32:43,732 --> 01:32:45,927
But don't strain yourself.

972
01:32:46,101 --> 01:32:47,728
Okay.

973
01:33:06,455 --> 01:33:08,685
Strong focus on what I want.

974
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,312
I'm back!

975
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:41,820
I'm back!

976
01:33:59,441 --> 01:34:00,840
My back.

977
01:34:01,777 --> 01:34:03,142
My back.

978
01:34:27,302 --> 01:34:31,636
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

979
01:34:32,207 --> 01:34:33,435
Peter Parker?

980
01:34:35,611 --> 01:34:36,839
Positive.

981
01:34:37,145 --> 01:34:38,305
Thought he was your pal.

982
01:34:38,647 --> 01:34:40,979
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.

983
01:34:41,883 --> 01:34:44,477
He's just a great big jerk.

984
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:46,617
The world's full of great big jerks.

985
01:34:48,123 --> 01:34:49,886
You're adorable.

986
01:34:50,292 --> 01:34:51,884
It's just the uniform.

987
01:34:55,197 --> 01:34:57,290
Lean your head back for me.

988
01:34:57,599 --> 01:35:00,033
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.

989
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:03,731
Just put my head back?

990
01:35:04,473 --> 01:35:06,065
Okay.

991
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:26,650
Wow.

992
01:35:27,429 --> 01:35:29,192
I'm back on the moon.

993
01:35:33,835 --> 01:35:35,325
You up there with me?

994
01:35:56,124 --> 01:35:58,285
- Hiya.
- Surprised?

995
01:35:58,460 --> 01:35:59,950
Very.

996
01:36:00,128 --> 01:36:01,686
Thanks for coming.

997
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:03,964
Everything okay?

998
01:36:04,966 --> 01:36:06,695
You might say so.

999
01:36:08,036 --> 01:36:11,802
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

1000
01:36:14,242 --> 01:36:16,904
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

1001
01:36:17,312 --> 01:36:21,214
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.

1002
01:36:22,818 --> 01:36:26,481
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...

1003
01:36:26,655 --> 01:36:30,250
...that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.

1004
01:36:31,093 --> 01:36:33,084
I was afraid to trust you.

1005
01:36:34,763 --> 01:36:37,789
But I've been thinking about it...

1006
01:36:37,966 --> 01:36:41,629
Listen, there's more for me to say.

1007
01:36:45,307 --> 01:36:49,505
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought...

1008
01:36:49,678 --> 01:36:52,306
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

1009
01:36:53,014 --> 01:36:54,811
I'm saying...

1010
01:37:00,989 --> 01:37:03,981
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...

1011
01:37:04,493 --> 01:37:05,983
...but I can't.

1012
01:37:09,431 --> 01:37:12,662
My mind was playing tricks too.

1013
01:37:17,372 --> 01:37:19,966
Do you love me, or not?

1014
01:37:27,015 --> 01:37:28,642
I...

1015
01:37:31,953 --> 01:37:33,181
...don't.

1016
01:37:38,026 --> 01:37:39,960
You don't.

1017
01:37:49,504 --> 01:37:50,732
Kiss me.

1018
01:37:52,941 --> 01:37:54,431
Kiss you?

1019
01:37:54,609 --> 01:37:56,509
I need to know something.

1020
01:37:59,047 --> 01:38:00,639
Just one kiss.

1021
01:38:47,996 --> 01:38:49,930
What's happening?

1022
01:39:00,175 --> 01:39:01,802
Peter Parker...

1023
01:39:02,677 --> 01:39:04,474
...and the girlfriend.

1024
01:39:04,779 --> 01:39:06,610
What do you want?

1025
01:39:09,451 --> 01:39:11,612
I want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.

1026
01:39:11,786 --> 01:39:14,448
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

1027
01:39:14,623 --> 01:39:16,784
I don't know where he is.

1028
01:39:18,326 --> 01:39:19,884
Find him.

1029
01:39:22,163 --> 01:39:24,996
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.

1030
01:39:25,166 --> 01:39:27,157
If you lay one finger on her...

1031
01:39:27,335 --> 01:39:28,666
You'll do what?

1032
01:40:42,410 --> 01:40:46,141
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiancée.

1033
01:40:46,314 --> 01:40:47,906
Sorry, Jonah.

1034
01:40:48,984 --> 01:40:50,474
It's all my fault.

1035
01:40:52,253 --> 01:40:54,585
I drove Spider-Man away.

1036
01:40:54,856 --> 01:40:58,019
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.

1037
01:40:59,527 --> 01:41:00,755
Yes.

1038
01:41:02,397 --> 01:41:05,730
Spider-Man was a hero.

1039
01:41:06,935 --> 01:41:08,903
I just couldn't see it.

1040
01:41:10,505 --> 01:41:11,938
He was a...

1041
01:41:12,107 --> 01:41:14,837
A thief! A criminal!

1042
01:41:16,344 --> 01:41:18,642
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

1043
01:41:18,813 --> 01:41:21,839
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

1044
01:41:22,017 --> 01:41:24,178
I want him strung up by his web!

1045
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:28,282
I want Spider-Man!

1046
01:41:56,751 --> 01:41:58,116
Where is she?

1047
01:41:58,286 --> 01:42:00,880
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.

1048
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:53,334
What the hell?

1049
01:45:45,446 --> 01:45:47,505
You have a train to catch.

1050
01:45:50,084 --> 01:45:51,915
Help!

1051
01:45:52,086 --> 01:45:56,455
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

1052
01:46:15,209 --> 01:46:17,769
- It's Spider-Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!

1053
01:46:17,945 --> 01:46:19,344
Tell everyone to hang on!

1054
01:46:19,514 --> 01:46:21,379
Brace yourselves!

1055
01:46:42,570 --> 01:46:44,902
Any more bright ideas?

1056
01:46:45,206 --> 01:46:47,606
I got a few, yeah!

1057
01:47:08,930 --> 01:47:10,761
Whoa, watch out!

1058
01:47:41,396 --> 01:47:42,658
We're slowing down.

1059
01:48:46,661 --> 01:48:48,629
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

1060
01:48:49,630 --> 01:48:51,120
Slower. Gently.

1061
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:57,701
Is he alive?

1062
01:49:01,375 --> 01:49:02,706
He's...

1063
01:49:02,877 --> 01:49:04,469
...just a kid.

1064
01:49:05,646 --> 01:49:07,477
No older than my son.

1065
01:49:26,834 --> 01:49:28,631
It's all right.

1066
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:34,871
We found something.

1067
01:49:44,151 --> 01:49:46,312
We won't tell nobody.

1068
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:02,496
It's good to have you back,
Spider-Man.

1069
01:50:22,323 --> 01:50:24,154
He's mine!

1070
01:50:24,959 --> 01:50:27,689
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

1071
01:50:28,029 --> 01:50:29,360
And me.

1072
01:50:29,964 --> 01:50:31,329
Me too.

1073
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:37,828
Very well.

1074
01:51:06,834 --> 01:51:08,802
Where do you want him?

1075
01:51:16,611 --> 01:51:18,101
And the tritium?

1076
01:51:32,627 --> 01:51:34,094
Yes.

1077
01:52:04,125 --> 01:52:07,253
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

1078
01:52:09,930 --> 01:52:12,421
First we'll see who's behind the mask.

1079
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:15,068
I can look into your eyes as you die.

1080
01:52:17,838 --> 01:52:19,362
Pete.

1081
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:21,435
No.

1082
01:52:22,043 --> 01:52:23,442
It can't be.

1083
01:52:30,017 --> 01:52:31,314
Harry.

1084
01:52:32,853 --> 01:52:36,289
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

1085
01:52:37,625 --> 01:52:41,584
- He's got M.J.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.

1086
01:52:42,363 --> 01:52:43,625
Tritium?

1087
01:52:45,633 --> 01:52:47,624
He's making the machine again.

1088
01:52:48,469 --> 01:52:52,701
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

1089
01:52:52,873 --> 01:52:55,637
- Now, where is he?
- Peter...

1090
01:52:56,811 --> 01:52:58,642
...you killed my father.

1091
01:53:03,818 --> 01:53:07,914
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

1092
01:53:08,656 --> 01:53:11,420
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.

1093
01:53:22,036 --> 01:53:23,731
Hey!

1094
01:53:24,805 --> 01:53:26,466
Hey!

1095
01:53:27,875 --> 01:53:29,638
I'm talking to you!

1096
01:53:29,977 --> 01:53:33,469
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.

1097
01:53:33,647 --> 01:53:35,512
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

1098
01:53:35,683 --> 01:53:38,243
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

1099
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:40,653
He's not dead.

1100
01:53:40,921 --> 01:53:43,549
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.

1101
01:54:01,308 --> 01:54:02,639
Surprise.

1102
01:54:07,081 --> 01:54:08,708
As soon as you get free...

1103
01:54:10,885 --> 01:54:14,844
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

1104
01:54:15,022 --> 01:54:18,116
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.

1105
01:54:18,292 --> 01:54:20,624
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.

1106
01:54:21,762 --> 01:54:23,627
Well, I'm not.

1107
01:54:56,163 --> 01:54:57,391
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1108
01:55:13,347 --> 01:55:14,575
Run!

1109
01:55:39,139 --> 01:55:41,471
Let's see you scurry out of this.

1110
01:56:05,332 --> 01:56:07,562
Now what?

1111
01:56:37,665 --> 01:56:39,792
Dr. Octavius.

1112
01:56:42,970 --> 01:56:44,198
We have to shut it down.

1113
01:56:45,072 --> 01:56:46,630
Please tell me how.

1114
01:56:46,807 --> 01:56:48,240
Peter Parker?

1115
01:56:51,812 --> 01:56:53,837
"Brilliant but lazy."

1116
01:56:54,181 --> 01:56:55,580
Look at what's happening.

1117
01:56:56,583 --> 01:56:58,517
We must destroy it.

1118
01:57:04,091 --> 01:57:05,683
I can't destroy it.

1119
01:57:10,965 --> 01:57:12,296
I won't.

1120
01:57:17,871 --> 01:57:19,998
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.

1121
01:57:21,942 --> 01:57:25,639
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1122
01:57:27,348 --> 01:57:28,747
A privilege.

1123
01:57:29,416 --> 01:57:32,476
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1124
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:35,385
Don't listen to them.

1125
01:57:41,261 --> 01:57:42,819
It was my dream.

1126
01:57:42,997 --> 01:57:47,491
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...

1127
01:57:47,668 --> 01:57:50,159
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

1128
01:57:51,005 --> 01:57:52,666
Even our dreams.

1129
01:57:58,679 --> 01:58:00,306
You're right.

1130
01:58:07,721 --> 01:58:09,586
He's right.

1131
01:58:11,325 --> 01:58:12,917
Listen.

1132
01:58:15,129 --> 01:58:17,393
Listen to me now.

1133
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:22,598
Listen to me now.

1134
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:29,309
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1135
01:58:30,411 --> 01:58:32,072
It can't be stopped.

1136
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:35,573
It's self-sustaining now.

1137
01:58:35,749 --> 01:58:37,808
- Think!
- Unless...

1138
01:58:39,386 --> 01:58:41,115
The river.

1139
01:58:42,489 --> 01:58:44,081
Drown it.

1140
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:47,391
I'll do it.

1141
01:59:32,706 --> 01:59:35,436
No!

1142
01:59:47,454 --> 01:59:49,046
Hi.

1143
01:59:49,723 --> 01:59:51,350
Hi.

1144
01:59:52,159 --> 01:59:53,524
This is really heavy.

1145
02:00:18,185 --> 02:00:20,153
M.J.

1146
02:00:21,021 --> 02:00:22,818
In case we die...

1147
02:00:22,990 --> 02:00:24,548
You do love me.

1148
02:00:25,125 --> 02:00:26,353
I do.

1149
02:00:27,327 --> 02:00:29,386
Even though you said you didn't.

1150
02:00:32,332 --> 02:00:34,800
I will not die a monster.

1151
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:42,159
I think I always knew...

1152
02:01:43,237 --> 02:01:44,864
...all this time...

1153
02:01:46,039 --> 02:01:47,836
...who you really were.

1154
02:01:48,442 --> 02:01:51,002
Then you know
why we can't be together.

1155
02:01:52,212 --> 02:01:55,181
Spider-Man will always have enemies.

1156
02:01:57,017 --> 02:01:59,713
I can't let you take that risk.

1157
02:02:04,424 --> 02:02:05,789
I will...

1158
02:02:07,461 --> 02:02:09,725
...always be Spider-Man.

1159
02:02:12,499 --> 02:02:14,967
You and I can never be.

1160
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:05,241
Mary Jane!

1161
02:04:08,348 --> 02:04:10,009
Hello?

1162
02:04:26,032 --> 02:04:27,363
Who's that?

1163
02:04:27,534 --> 02:04:29,468
Son.

1164
02:04:30,570 --> 02:04:32,094
I'm here.

1165
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:34,867
Dad?

1166
02:04:35,942 --> 02:04:38,137
- I thought you were...
- No.

1167
02:04:38,645 --> 02:04:40,738
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1168
02:04:40,914 --> 02:04:42,279
Now it's your turn.

1169
02:04:43,850 --> 02:04:46,512
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.

1170
02:04:46,887 --> 02:04:48,548
Now make him pay.

1171
02:04:48,855 --> 02:04:50,516
But Pete's my best friend.

1172
02:04:50,690 --> 02:04:52,282
And I'm your father.

1173
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:54,693
You're weak.

1174
02:04:55,695 --> 02:05:00,029
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

1175
02:05:01,101 --> 02:05:03,934
Now you know the truth about Peter.

1176
02:05:04,871 --> 02:05:06,361
Be strong, Harry.

1177
02:05:07,407 --> 02:05:08,806
Avenge me.

1178
02:05:11,611 --> 02:05:13,636
- Avenge me!
- No!

1179
02:07:38,325 --> 02:07:39,724
Call Deborah.

1180
02:07:39,893 --> 02:07:41,724
The caterer?

1181
02:07:42,729 --> 02:07:44,822
Tell her not to open the caviar.

1182
02:08:26,206 --> 02:08:28,367
Had to do what I had to do.

1183
02:08:30,043 --> 02:08:31,374
Mary Jane.

1184
02:08:32,545 --> 02:08:33,807
Peter.

1185
02:08:35,048 --> 02:08:37,482
I can't survive without you.

1186
02:08:47,494 --> 02:08:49,325
You shouldn't be here.

1187
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:53,490
I know you think we can't be together.

1188
02:08:54,567 --> 02:08:58,264
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1189
02:08:59,539 --> 02:09:01,268
I know there'll be risks.

1190
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:04,768
But I want to face them with you.

1191
02:09:05,945 --> 02:09:09,312
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...

1192
02:09:09,482 --> 02:09:11,245
...half of ourselves.

1193
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:15,312
I love you.

1194
02:09:17,590 --> 02:09:20,559
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.

1195
02:09:22,295 --> 02:09:25,389
I've always been
standing in your doorway.

1196
02:09:32,439 --> 02:09:35,966
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?

1197
02:09:41,915 --> 02:09:43,746
Well, say something.

1198
02:09:46,252 --> 02:09:48,743
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.

1199
02:10:04,938 --> 02:10:06,701
Go get them, tiger.
