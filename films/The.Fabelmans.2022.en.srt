1
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,175
Mommy and daddy will
be right next to you.

2
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,593
The lights will go down.

3
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:55,764
There may be some organ music as
the curtain opens. Don't be scared.

4
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,808
It'll be dark in
there, you said.

5
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,977
- I don't wanna go in.
- But it's fun.

6
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,313
All week you've been so
excited. Your first ever movie!

7
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,983
- And the people are gigantic.
- What people?

8
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,569
You said the people in
the movie are gigantic.

9
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:12,281
Oh, because of the big screen they're
on. But they're not real though, right?

10
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,284
- They're like dreams.
- Dreams are scary.

11
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,745
Some dreams are, but this
is gonna be a nice dream.

12
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,957
About a circus and clowns
and acrobats and...

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,667
You wanna know how it works?

14
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,713
There's a big machine called a projector.
Inside, there's a big bright light

15
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,757
and it projects photographs
of... Of clowns and acrobats.

16
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,820
- And elephants. Happy things.
- "Projecting" means it sends them out.

17
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,096
Happy things like light
from a huge flashlight.

18
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,932
But these photographs move
past the light really fast.

19
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,767
Twenty-four photos
in every second.

20
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:44,980
Now, in your brain, each photograph
stays for about a 15th of a second.

21
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,441
That's called
persistence of vision.

22
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,902
The photographs move past faster
than your brain can let go of them,

23
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,697
and that's how the movie
projector tricks us into believing

24
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,283
that motionless
pictures are moving.

25
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,201
A motion picture.

26
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:02,706
Movies are dreams, doll,
that you never forget.

27
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,042
You just wait and
see. When it's over,

28
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,919
you're gonna have the biggest,
sloppiest smile on your face.

29
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,421
They're letting us in.

30
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,869
Wait z'il/ the engines pass.

31
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,454
Unlock the door.

32
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,583
Pass it down.

33
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,422
- What's that?
- Second sect/on.

34
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,386
Angel. She's on that train.

35
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,530
So what? We got the dough.
Let's get out of here.

36
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,848
L/ghts. /must turn the
fights down the track.

37
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,600
You crazy /unkheao'.
Give me that wheel.

38
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,852
We are going to turn the lights!

39
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,315
Train! Stop the train!

40
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,359
Stop the train!

41
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,531
Stop! Can't you see
the //ghts? Stop!

42
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,493
First section! Hold it!

43
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,994
Angel!

44
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,913
Angel!

45
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,312
What was your favorite part?

46
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,652
Sammy, what do you
want for hanukkah?

47
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:01,700
I told you this wasn't a good idea,
what with all of his a-n-x-i-e-t-i-e-s.

48
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,994
Kids his age have big
i-m-a-g-i-n-a-t-i-o-n-s.

49
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,038
No fair spelling
out the long words.

50
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,045
The lights change how everything
looks. It's hard to find our house.

51
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,548
Ours is the dark
house with no lights.

52
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,060
That's what I want for hanukkah.

53
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,313
- What?
- Christmas lights!

54
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,065
Sorry, darling.

55
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,859
Jews don't get Christmas lights.

56
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,361
Eight nights of candlelight.

57
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,823
Who could ask for anything more?

58
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:46,203
J” who could ask
for anything more j”

59
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,164
can I sleep with
the oscilloscope?

60
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,941
Get going. We gotta burn rubber

61
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,282
- What's that?
- Second section.

62
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,058
Angel. She's on that train.

63
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,393
The lights. Lmust turn
the I/ghts down the track.

64
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,146
Stop the tram! Stop the train!

65
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:14,898
Angel!

66
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,445
Mommy! Mommy!

67
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:26,576
I know what I want for hanukkah!
I know what I want for hanukkah!

68
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,006
Hanukkah!

69
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,134
Thank you!

70
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,764
Sammy.

71
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,685
-[Gasps} -Oh, my god.
I want to try it on.

72
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,487
J“ down by the station

j” pufif put/5 toot,

80
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,019
okay. So, the outside grounds,
the middle conducts the power,

81
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,856
and these two metal wheels under
the engine complete the circuit.

82
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,109
So, new, Mr. Engineer?

83
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,528
Rca gave you a raise?

84
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,448
That is one expensive
trolley car.

85
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,450
It's not a trolley car.
It's a Lionel train.

86
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,411
No raises for the computer guys
this year. Next year, maybe.

87
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,081
Your moonlighting son is paying for it
by filling up my house with broken tvs.

88
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,458
Repair work, that's how.

89
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,629
Oy, careful he doesn't
electrocute himself.

90
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,466
- Hold on.
- You're okay.

91
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,552
You're not taking that fancy
train to Florida without me.

92
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,845
Hey, look.

93
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,014
She's down on the floor.

94
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,974
Who's gonna help her up?

95
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,726
Who says I'm getting up?

96
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,188
I'm going to Miami
on the Sammy limited.

97
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,148
Go ahead.

98
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,138
They're precisely
engineered toys.

99
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,866
You can play with them when you've
learned to treat them with respect.

100
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,059
I do respect them. I love them.

101
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,145
I know you do, but you
can't just love something.

102
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,313
You also have to take
care of it, right?

103
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,487
Maybe we can play together
with them this weekend.

104
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,457
But I need to see them crash.

105
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,756
I don't understand. Why does
he need to see them crash?

106
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,013
It's late. You don't
want to shut your light?

107
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,058
Mmm. In a minute.
I'm still wide-awake.

108
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:24,064
You see these descending notes?
That's called a lament bass.

109
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,652
You should play it on the
radio on that arts program.

110
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,505
- They keep asking you to go back.
- Oh.

111
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,323
I don't have time for that.

112
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,075
Well, we can hire a sitter.

113
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,701
Who can afford that? Forget it.

114
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,205
That was another life.
That was two kids ago.

115
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,289
All right.

116
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,880
Do you know what I miss
most about the piano?

117
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,344
Surrendering to the score.

118
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,807
Knowing bach is
gonna tell you how...

119
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,435
First this note,
then this chord,

120
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,064
then you open your hand, you
stretch down an octave...

121
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:19,119
Making a little world you
can be safe and happy in.

122
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,544
Thank you.

123
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,597
That's why he needs
to watch them crash.

124
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:45,186
He's trying to get some
kind of control over it.

125
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,111
Sammy.

126
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,365
We're going to use
daddy's camera to film it.

127
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,785
Only crash the train once, okay?

128
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,789
Then after we get the film developed,
you can watch it crash over and over

129
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,207
till it's not so scary anymore.

130
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,501
And your real train
won't ever get broken.

131
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,881
One more thing, darling.

132
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,633
Let's not tell your father.

133
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,679
It'll be our secret movie,
just yours and mine.

134
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,021
Sorry I'm late. I picked
up Ms. Moynahan's motorola.

135
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,464
There's no room left in the
workshop. Where should I put it?

136
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,317
- The living room, I guess?
- Okay.

137
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,069
Hey. Uh, sorry I'm late.

138
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,447
I picked up Mrs. Fabelman.
Where should I put her?

139
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,868
Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

140
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,704
- Did the mail come?
- It's on the table.

141
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,790
Cossack.

142
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,310
This is brisket?

143
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,811
My movie!

144
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,441
Uh-uh. After supper.

145
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,402
The amount of
magnetism is increased

146
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,905
by how magnetically permeable
the core material is.

147
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,157
The tricky thing is how
permeable we can make it.

148
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,743
Am I supposed to be
following any of this?

149
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,412
You know what a magnetic
field is, right?

150
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,289
Well, sure. I mean, it...

151
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,501
Sammy, do you know what
a magnetic field is?

152
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,169
- Can I be excused?
- Nope.

153
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,004
But I need to,
just for a minute.

154
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,547
What's so urgent?

155
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,591
Honey. This tastes funny, Burt.

156
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,803
- It tastes funny on a plastic fork.
- Ma.

157
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:46,057
Is she saving the silven/vare
for when the eisenhowers drop by?

158
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,851
The problem is we're using
vacuum tubes, not transistors,

159
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,438
- and magnetic cores to try to access...
- 35,000 magnetic cores.

160
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,316
Hey, Sam. You know on your father's
camera when the film runs out?

161
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,026
When that happens,
what do you do?

162
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,111
Load more film.

163
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,195
The same with computers.

164
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,614
You have to load more tape,
and that slows everything down.

165
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,841
Mitz, the chopped liver was...

166
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,635
We figured out how to take
tapes, load it with data,

167
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,744
and instead of changing
tapes every ten seconds,

168
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,413
this new machine
he's engineering...

169
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,124
- The bizmac!
- The bizmac!

170
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,043
It can search for information
through all these tapes at once.

171
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,046
You never need to change any of
them. It'll be ten times faster.

172
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,589
I love Burt's brain.

173
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,385
Especially when you're around
to explain what's in it.

174
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,891
Mom, I have to go upstairs now.

175
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,728
- Not until you've finished eating.
- He cleaned his plate.

176
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,604
No, he didn't.

177
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,481
Sammy.

178
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,245
I think there's something
under your plate.

179
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,335
- Sammy!
- No, there isn't.

180
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,945
Lift it up and check!
I saw it moving.

181
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,497
Licorice.

182
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,876
If there's anything I'm a
sucker for, it's licorice.

183
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,339
Uncle bennie, that
was so disgusting!

184
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,342
Natalie, he is not your uncle.

185
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,969
Also, he is not that funny.

186
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,888
"Uncle" is a term of affection.

187
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,849
Natalie, he's not related.

188
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:15,521
He's only always here
because he works for my son.

189
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,399
He's only always here
because he's my best friend.

190
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,862
And deep down inside you, Mrs.
Fabelman, admit it, I'm your friend too.

191
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:27,116
Deep down inside of me
is none of your business.

192
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,244
Sid Caesar's on
tonight. Help me.

193
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,747
Any more left to eat?

194
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,726
- Natalie, get that corner.
- Get the corner. Get the corner.

195
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,977
Can I help you take it out?

196
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,647
Sammy.

197
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,399
I had to crash it a whole lot of
times, but the train never got hurt.

198
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,026
Golly.

199
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,363
I thought that was the
greatest show on earth!

200
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,826
More, more, more, more, more!

201
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,871
Head back. Open.

202
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,706
- Ah.
- Candy corn in.

203
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,668
Say, "ah." Head back.

204
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,881
Ketchup. Okay.

205
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,632
Scream like it hurts.

206
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:07,800
Pull it!

207
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,066
Sammy!

208
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,276
Take off the blindfolds.

209
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,038
Sammy?

210
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,875
Reggie, Natalie, come
downstairs pronto.

211
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,919
Your father has an announcement.

212
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:32,301
General electric wants to hire me
because of what I did on bizmac.

213
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,264
They want to use my electronic
library system to...

214
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:39,892
Well, I... I don't think they have
any notion of what I can do with it.

215
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,477
And I'll make more money.

216
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,563
Is uncle bennie coming too?

217
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,023
Well, daddy and me
haven't had a chance to...

218
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,567
Bennie, no. He... he lives here.

219
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:51,946
Burt.

220
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,079
I'll miss your uncle bennie too,
but Phoenix is a real neat city.

221
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,247
It's on the rise.

222
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,041
They've only just hired me.
I've got no pull there yet.

223
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,253
I can't ask general electric to
hire somebody else on my say-so.

224
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,546
That's not how it works.

225
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,172
Don't ask them. Do it yourself.

226
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,217
They're hiring you to manage.
Managers hire. Hire bennie.

227
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,969
Who's watching... Sammy!

228
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,431
He's gotta make a name for
himself at rca. That's what I did.

229
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,434
He'll stay in New Jersey, get out
from under my shadow and then...

230
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,704
- He needs you, Burt.
- There's a tornado outside!

231
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,872
Yeah, well, there's
a bigger one in here.

232
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,316
Honestly. Honestly, Burt,
sometimes I wanna shake you.

233
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,152
You're gonna leave him
behind with just a shrug?

234
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,988
- Mommy! Mommy!
- "We'll see ya later."

235
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,991
And once we're gone, who will
he have left in New Jersey?

236
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,702
You have an opportunity
to help your best friend.

237
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,621
- Honestly, wake up.
- Mommy, look!

238
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,707
- What?
- There's a tornado outside. I'm scared.

239
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,833
Just go. I'm...

240
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,503
Wow!

241
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,259
Oh!

242
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,766
You weren't kidding!

243
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,893
How close is it?

244
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,565
Why does the sky look orange?

245
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,027
Come on! Come on!

246
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,153
Let's go see.

247
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,408
Mitz!

248
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,785
Where are you going?

249
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,413
Mitz, where are...

250
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,918
Where are you going?

251
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,172
Mitz!

252
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,009
Mitzi!

253
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,268
Where is it? I can't
see it anymore.

254
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,437
Up ahead somewhere.
We'll find it.

255
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,731
Mom, it's there. It's there!

256
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,363
Is this safe?

257
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,949
Of course it's safe.
I'm your mother.

258
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,286
- Stop!
- Mom, stop!

259
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,730
Everything happens for a reason.

260
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,107
Everything happens for a reason.

261
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,068
Everything happens for a reason.

262
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,488
Say it with me.

263
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,991
Everything happens for a reason.

264
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,077
Everything happens for a reason.

265
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,581
Everything happens for a reason.

266
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,126
Everything happens for a reason.

267
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,629
J” take me back
to dream again j”

268
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,383
j” by a campfire on the trail j”

269
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:06,849
j” by a campfire on the
trail when day is done... j”

270
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,478
I think there's something
dead in the road.

271
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:14,482
J” let me join my saddle pals j”

272
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,819
j” by a campfire on the
trail when day is done... j”

273
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,237
Reggie, wave in the camera.

274
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,534
J” let me smell
that chaparral j”

275
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,914
j” let me join my saddle pals j”

276
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:36,420
j” by a campfire on the
trail when day is done j”

277
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:40,549
j” ill make my bed and rest j”

278
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,178
j” beneath the western sky... j”

279
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,597
Ooh, look.

280
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,808
- There it is!
- There it is.

281
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,466
Let me out. I wanna take
a shot of him pulling in.

282
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,440
- No, I have to pee!
- Me too! Now! No!

283
00:21:56,524 --> 00:22:02,279
J” he and/ will always be by
a campfire on the trail... j”

284
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,865
No! I have to pee!

285
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,749
- Keep coming.
- No!

286
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,871
Keep coming, dad.
You're doing great.

287
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,211
And...

288
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,295
Stop.

289
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,631
Freeze.

290
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,225
- Where's the lunch box?
- Wow.

291
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,188
- Where's the lunch box? Hurry!
- Guys, look at the monster Sammy caught.

292
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,063
I got some babies.

293
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,065
- Sal found babies.
- Look at that.

294
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,818
Sammy, Dean, come on. There's
a huge nest right there.

295
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,695
- Come on, guys.
- A big one, Sammy.

296
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,697
Oh, god.

297
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,092
- It's a whole herd of 'em.
- Scorpions come in nests.

298
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,910
- It's a bed of scorpions.
- No, it's a nest.

299
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,415
Baby scorpions are called "scorplings."
They're twice as venomous.

300
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,143
- That's why the lab pays more.
- There's gotta be, like, 50 of 'em.

301
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,045
- How much is the laboratory gonna pay?
- Fifty cents per baby.

302
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,339
- That's 25 bucks!
- We're rich.

303
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,008
Well, what are we gonna buy?

304
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,554
Twelve dollars even.

305
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,766
Well, it's the merit badge
for photography, not movies.

306
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,170
The manual says you gotta tell
a story with still pictures.

307
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,729
But all a movie is
is still pictures.

308
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,814
You just put a bunch of
'em together and they move.

309
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,816
Okay, but what kind of
movie are we making?

310
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,737
Ooh, Sammy, look.
It's Janet Benedict.

311
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:30,618
- Go on and talk to her. I dare you.
- He already talked to her.

312
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,369
- No way!
- Like hell.

313
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,288
He actually spoke to her?

314
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,498
He did. He did. He
walked right up to her.

315
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,833
You went up to Janet Benedict?

316
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,376
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

317
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,062
Oh, come on. Tell 'em
what happened, Sammy.

318
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,087
Nothing happened.

319
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,214
Something happened. Come on.

320
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,592
Could be the same one.

321
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,387
Overland... Say, I think
it is the same one.

322
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,057
Well, ldeclare.

323
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,854
So, uh...

324
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:02,232
Sammy kinda sidewinds
his way in her direction.

325
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,442
And he's trying to, um...

326
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,528
He... he's trying to work up the nerve
to say something slick and smooth

327
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:10,074
- like, "hey, jan, baby."
- Hey, no, I wasn't. You're making this up.

328
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,701
But... but he sees that Janet's
got something on her nose.

329
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,625
So now he's thinking, "cool. Here's
my excuse to go up and talk to her."

330
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:19,291
So he goes and he says,
"hey, uh, sorry, Janet.

331
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,686
It... it looks like you have
a little smudge on your nose."

332
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,420
- Shut up, hark.
- But it wasn't a smudge.

333
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,315
- It looked like a smudge.
- And it wasn't little.

334
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,423
Hark, shut up!

335
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,593
It was a booger!

336
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:33,222
A big, fat, Janet
Benedict booger.

337
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,066
Hey, Sammy.

338
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,859
Stand and deliver

339
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,112
what kind of movie
are we gonna make?

340
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,199
Stand and deliver.

341
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,037
No, keep screaming.
Keep screaming.

342
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,209
I need more dust. Dad, can
you grab the sandwich board?

343
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,294
No, god, no more dust. No.

344
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:07,256
- Reggie, stop coughing!
- I'm coughing because there's dust.

345
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,526
- More dust, fellas.
- Natalie, say, "please don't kill me."

346
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,468
Reggie, stop coughing.
You're being dramatic.

347
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:14,263
Mr. Fabelman, you're getting
dirt inside my stagecoach.

348
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,741
- Don't you want me to be dramatic?
- Well, we'll clean it out.

349
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,560
Guys, stop looking into the
camera. I can't use any of this.

350
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:11,945
Fake.

351
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,908
Totally fake.

352
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,543
You hear it?

353
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,586
She has gotta cut those
goddamn fingernails

354
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,255
before she goes on
live television.

355
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,466
I have to perform this tomorrow.

356
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,594
It's a difficult piece.
It's a very big deal for me.

357
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,139
All I asked was for you to
keep your big traps shut

358
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,641
and listen to my
dress rehearsal.

359
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,184
Sorry, mitz. It's wonderful.

360
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:27,104
You hear how the rising
arpeggios lift up the sad notes?

361
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,982
It's in f minor, but your
mom makes it sound so alive.

362
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,776
She makes it sound like
she's playing a typewriter.

363
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,029
Oh, no. Not this again.

364
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,115
J” bada Dee, bada
Dee, bada... j”

365
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,033
tick, tick, tick. Ping!

366
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,078
Do you hear it? Am I clicking?

367
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,414
I concentrate on
your playing, but...

368
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,915
Oh, great. But what?

369
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,479
- People can hear it in Tucson.
- Maybe I've gotten used to it.

370
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,212
Maybe ge should make rubber
tips for fingernails.

371
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,674
All right, mitzi fabelman.
Time to face the music.

372
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,800
Oh, boy.

373
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,660
You stay away from me with those
things. No, no, no! Stop it!

374
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,881
It's Beethoven, damn it. It
is not morse code. Come on!

375
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,932
He has a point though,

376
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,656
especially with the polydirectional
ribbon microphones they have...

377
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,647
Come on. You married her.

378
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,107
Dad, don't.

379
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,442
Do it. Do it. Do it!

380
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,861
I will scratch you.
Don't think I won't!

381
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,104
Do you think artur
rubinstein had fingernails?

382
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:21,366
- Horowitz? Schnabel? Kempff?
- Think about it. No, no, no!

383
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,076
- Liberace!
- No, no, no, no!

384
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,494
Come on, fabelman.

385
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,178
Show her who's general electric's
product design manager.

386
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,666
I paid a buck 50 at the
beauty parlor for these.

387
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,835
Oh, no!

388
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,295
One,

389
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,755
two,

390
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,215
three.

391
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,636
Get off of me, Delilah.

392
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,762
Delilah?

393
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,264
Okay, the fun's over.
I'll do the rest myself.

394
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,776
Oh, great. Just great.

395
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,029
Well, that decides it. I'm gonna play
the program from memory tomorrow.

396
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,950
No sheet music, short nails,
like a real performing artist.

397
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,001
Did you drop your gun?

398
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,723
That's me.

399
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:12,894
Real scary, sheriff.

400
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,385
How'd you do that?

401
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,422
Go, Sammy!

402
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,721
It's kinda like what I do, isn't
it, what a movie director does?

403
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,306
It is?

404
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,809
I figure out what my
division needs to accomplish,

405
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,895
then I work out how my
guys are gonna get it done.

406
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,023
Yeah, it is. Yeah, sort of.

407
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,442
How'd you make it look like
the guns were really firing?

408
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,530
I did it with pins.

409
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,115
Pins.

410
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,367
Yeah, I poked holes
in the film with pins.

411
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,993
- Sammy.
- Yeah.

412
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:55,539
- Thinking like an engineer.
- Watch the road, dad.

413
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,458
Sammy, watch the road.

414
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,142
I can't edit without
an editing machine.

415
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,004
I have to be able to
cut and splice, and I...

416
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,507
Let's revisit it after
the camping trip.

417
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,884
It's three hours to
the national forest.

418
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,804
If you get your license, you
can help with the driving.

419
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,888
Okay.

420
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,184
"You are approaching
a railroad crossing

421
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,645
with no warning devices
and limited visibility.

422
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,063
The speed limit is"...

423
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:23,108
See, the thing is, though, about
my new movie, is that it's just...

424
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,986
It's about world
war ii, your war.

425
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,864
It's gonna be out of this world.
I'm shooting on a bolex h8.

426
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,615
Finally, I can use
double run film.

427
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,909
That's six minutes without
having to change the reel.

428
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,673
How much did you spend
to rent this camera?

429
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,164
Twenty bucks.

430
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,007
But I used my own money.
You don't have to...

431
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,293
And this movie
editor gizmo costs?

432
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:45,255
- It's a Mansfield 8 mm movie editor.
- How much?

433
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,008
- Eighty bucks.
- Doggone it, Sammy!

434
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,427
A hundred dollars for a hobby?

435
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,928
It's not a hobby, dad.

436
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,812
If you spent half the time on algebra
that you spend on these movies...

437
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,808
I hate algebra. Why are you...

438
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,269
It's completely pointless.

439
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,646
Not if you want to make
something, it's not pointless.

440
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,482
Gee, Sammy. When I was a boy,

441
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,401
I always used to think, "somebody
figured out how to make this."

442
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:10,655
This car, that rearview mirror,
that directional signal.

443
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,157
I wanna make movies though.

444
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,326
I mean something real,

445
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,579
not imaginary.

446
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,875
Something someone
can actually use,

447
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,670
like a driver's license.

448
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,674
I'm gonna vomit,
Sammy! I'm gonna vomit!

449
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,260
Sammy, please pull over.
She's gonna puke all over me.

450
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:36,223
Go slower. You are the worst
driver. You're gonna break the car.

451
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:39,893
We're on a back road going
three miles per hour. Calm down.

452
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,020
You're doing great, doll.
You're doing very well.

453
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,730
Okay, watch out.
Puddle up ahead.

454
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:55,867
So we've got three that are strong and
still green inside so they don't burn.

455
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,953
Bright green means that
they're still alive

456
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,746
and that they carry moisture.

457
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:03,250
And the reason that we use
the shape of the triangle

458
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,669
is that when these
three points connect,

459
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,421
if we find the center
of gravitational force,

460
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,674
it creates almost
perfect balance.

461
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,344
Because I'm tutti, and you're frutti.
So who else are you gonna listen to?

462
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,138
J” a wop bop b-luma
b-lop bam bom j”

463
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,056
okay.

464
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,326
The pyramids, right?

465
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,103
- I mean, the history behind this shape...
- Guys, come on!

466
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,022
Is pretty in...

467
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,024
Is pretty incredible.

468
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,651
Oh, hello!

469
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,903
One more time. One more time.

470
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,407
Wait. Let me try it like this.

471
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,827
Okay, one more time.
After one more time.

472
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,204
- Ready?
- Girls, I'm gonna start the fire.

473
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:44,416
- Three, two, one.
- Okay. Really big, really big!

474
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,793
Go! Whoa!

475
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,380
- I thought it was gonna break.
- It's happening!

476
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,591
- You almost broke the ash.
- Whoo!

488
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,660

they're gonna know that kind of fpu
is not for industrial process control,

498
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,634
and it will raise every red
flag there is. How many bits?

499
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:30,772
Float64.

500
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,608
64 bits? Sixty... you are nuts.

501
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,027
And time-sharing
for 11 operators?

502
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:38,530
They're gonna know this is a
business machine we're building,

503
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,615
and we're all gonna get fired.

504
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,909
-[Laughi ”9 -yes! I no.

505
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,829
Ge doesn't build business computers.
We do heavy industry processing.

506
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,915
You got that straight from the ceo.
Ralph cordiner is gonna skin you alive.

507
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:52,001
Once bank of america buys
in, this will be profitable,

508
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,504
and that's Mr. Cordiner's
job, making money.

509
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:58,133
My job is getting raytheon to
deliver 10,000 germanium transistors

510
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,634
that meet our
tolerance standards.

511
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:03,304
And your job is to get the
cabling diagrams to pitney bowes

512
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,349
so when the time comes, we have a
sorter to hook up to the mainframe.

513
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,953
Maybe pitney bowes will hire me
after you get us both canned from ge.

514
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,562
Isn't it worth getting canned

515
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,106
for the chance to build a
machine that can do all that?

516
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,441
It's worth it to you, maybe!

517
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,694
Sure as the lord made little green
apples, California, here you come.

518
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,862
IBM is waiting.

519
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,257
- Are we moving to California?
- You are, any day now.

520
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,466
- No, no.
- What?

521
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,826
IBM's asking, and
that's flattering.

522
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,494
Flattering? Flattering?

523
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,998
Every guy in computer would give
his matzo balls to get an offer.

524
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,709
You'll be in California building
double-precision auxiliary units

525
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,210
with an fp64.

526
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:37,130
I'm gonna be left schvitzing in
Arizona making 40-watt light bulbs.

527
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,298
Hold your horses.

528
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,967
I told your mom
it'll be up to her.

529
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,845
I'm not uprooting us
again unless she says yes.

530
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:49,100
Why would ll/lama/eh ever leave
all of this for California?

531
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,187
We have the Grand Canyon.

532
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,356
They have the San Andreas fault.

533
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,234
Il/lama/eh says,

534
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:03,156
I will never leave Arizona, and
Arizona will never leave me.

535
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,204
Kids, avert your eyes.

536
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,517
- Hey, man.
- Mmm?

537
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,227
Shouldn't you be filming this?

538
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,812
Not enough light.

539
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:44,364
Ge, living better electrically.

540
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,301
Mom?

541
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,179
Mom, everyone can see
through your dress. Um...

542
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,185
Reggie, get out of the way.

543
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,397
Dad, can you please stop this?

544
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,400
- Come. Sit.
- No.

545
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,738
Bennie, don't look!

546
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,658
Oh! You're all nuts!

547
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:29,052
My mama's such a good mama.

548
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,560
I love you so much.

549
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,401
I'm right here.

550
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,697
I'm right here with you.

551
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,908
I'm holding your hand.

552
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:55,495
Can you feel that, mama?
I just gave you a squeeze.

553
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,706
I love you, mama.

554
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,006
Mommy?

555
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,511
She opened her eyes.

556
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,262
Nurse.

557
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,265
Mommy, I'm here.
Here. I'm right here.

558
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,976
I'm right here, mama.

559
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,354
Mommy, look at me.

560
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,147
Mommy, can you hear?

561
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:04,647
It's a Mansfield 8 mm movie editor.
That's what you wanted, right?

562
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,487
Oh, my god.

563
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,707
Uh, now I need a
favor in return.

564
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:31,716
Okay, okay, okay.
Here's the favor.

565
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,800
Yeah.

566
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,809
Uh, I want you to make
a camping trip movie.

567
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,333
You can learn how the editing
machine works while you do this.

568
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,688
It'll make your mom feel better.

569
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:46,773
Yeah.

570
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:52,528
That last night when she danced in
the headlights, that'd be great.

571
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,740
Get to it tomorrow, okay?

572
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:01,746
Um, tomorrow's when
we start shooting.

573
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,644
Escape to nowhere. We're shooting
all weekend, dad. I can't.

574
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,087
Shoot it next weekend.

575
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,134
We've got, like, 40 guys
coming to be in the movie.

576
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:17,637
I'll... I'll work on all the
camping trip stuff on Monday.

577
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,348
I'm asking you to do this
now for your mom. She's...

578
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,226
Yeah, and I said that I will.
Just not tomorrow, please.

579
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,145
Don't be selfish. She
just lost her mother.

580
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,980
That's more important
than your hobby.

581
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,024
Dad, can you stop
calling it a hobby?

582
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,944
It'll cheer her up, watching this.
It's something we can do to...

583
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,197
Her mom just died. It's... How
is that gonna cheer her up?

584
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,658
Because you made it for her.

585
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,130
Uh, something's not right.

586
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,218
I don't know what else to do.

587
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,014
Can you help me?

588
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:22,827
Hello.

589
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,995
Mitzi

590
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:25,913
mitzi

591
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,419
mama?

592
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,588
Somebody's coming.

593
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,755
Mama?

594
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,218
Wha... uh...

595
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,720
M-Mama. What...

596
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,182
- You mustn't let him in.
- Mama.

597
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:47,560
- You mustn't let him in.
- Mama, I... I... I can't hear you.

598
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,188
I am scared.

599
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,481
You mustn't let
him in the house.

600
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,442
Mama, please. I...

601
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,943
Do not let him in.

602
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:59,780
- Do not let him in the house.
- What? No, I can't... who... who's coming?

603
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,282
Don't open the door.

604
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,783
Mama.

605
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:08,664
Mommy, don't go. Don't go yet.

606
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,462
You're having a bad dream.

607
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,274
This is a lot of food, mom.

608
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,944
Well, I'm upset.

609
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:43,699
Oh, that crazy dream, I
can't get it out of my head.

610
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:47,995
Last night, I dreamed I
got a call from my mama.

611
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,622
And she wanted to warn me.

612
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,291
- That's silly. Grandma died.
- About what?

613
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:55,878
Well, something's coming. She wants
me to batten down the hatches.

614
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,922
We're never going to be
able to eat all of this.

615
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,262
Who is that?

616
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,734
- It's uncle Boris.
- Hmm?

617
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:20,027
Uncle who?

618
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:22,738
Mom?

619
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,910
That's who she meant!

620
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,540
My... that's my...
my mama's brother!

621
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:42,383
Oh, he scared the crap out
of her when they were kids!

622
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:52,852
Don't let him in!

623
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,649
You were in the circus?

624
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,609
Mama said you were
the lion tamer.

625
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:05,865
No, not at first. At first it was,
"podgorny, pound in the tent pegs."

626
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,701
"Podgorny, muck out
the pachyderms."

627
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,745
And then one night,

628
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,914
the big cat act, he comes
down with the flu bug.

629
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:17,293
So it was, uh, "Boris
podgorny, in with the lions."

630
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,086
He's lying, right?

631
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,755
No, he's telling you a story.

632
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,798
Know what it's like, huh?

633
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,133
Pain in the ass, sisters.

634
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,135
That's rude.

635
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,095
- He said "ass."
- Shh. I know.

636
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,515
But when did you start
working in the movies?

637
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,684
1927.

638
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,562
1927, that was the jazz singer
that's the year that talkies started.

639
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:40,691
Yeah, sure, talkies. But me, no. I
started with, um, uncle Tom's cabin.

640
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,485
Nmawme

641
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,737
it was Harry pollard.

642
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,655
He acted for selig polyscope.

643
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:49,950
- He, uh, married Maggie what's-her-name.
- Mm-hmm.

644
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,494
He directed uncle Tom.

645
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,204
Lift up your plate.

646
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,540
So, pollard needed help
with the bloodhounds.

647
00:47:56,624 --> 00:48:00,044
So my pal fleischaker was
a big name in dog acts.

648
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,171
Poodles, mainly.

649
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,840
But, "sure," fleischaker
says to pollard.

650
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:08,135
"Yeah. Bloodhounds, poodles,
what's the difference?"

651
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,804
So, he went.

652
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,891
But, uh, by this time, uh,

653
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,852
fleischaker, he had it up
to here with the Jew-haters.

654
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,355
There was a lot of that
kind in the circuses.

655
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,233
Not many Jews,
lots of Jew-haters.

656
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,902
- Right.
- But the movies...

657
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:30,116
Fleischaker writes to me, "Boris,"
he writes. "Boris," he writes,

658
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,452
"Hollywood is heimish, imagine.

659
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:37,039
I'm in a minyan with Douglas
Fairbanks and Ricardo Cortez.

660
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:39,333
Come to Hollywood." So, I went.

661
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,547
Your wife, she don't
like doing the dishes?

662
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,841
Uh, piano hands.

663
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:54,014
So, you like the movies,
huh, Mr. Pitse/shas?

664
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,060
Okay, so the sergeant, he
comes over the hill here,

665
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:01,605
and I'm gonna go below him,
so we see him and the sky.

666
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,817
And so we don't see what he sees,
but we do see that he's really...

667
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,694
Okay, so he's almost
losing his mind, right?

668
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,113
'Cause what he is seeing
is totally terrible.

669
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,824
And then, I'm gonna turn the
camera so that we see it.

670
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,326
It's just in another
notebook. Hang on.

671
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,870
If that's the movie,

672
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,081
you could show me instead
of describing me to death.

673
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:22,126
No, that's just our stupid
camping trip. My dad's...

674
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:26,088
He wants me to put this camping
film together so it'll cheer up mom.

675
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:28,966
Because her heart is broken.

676
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,926
Because her mama iz toyt.

677
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,555
But you, Mr. Director,
you don't wanna do this,

678
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,973
what your daddy tells you,

679
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,267
because you want to make
your war picture, huh?

680
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,436
Yeah, yeah.

681
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,688
Believe me, Sammy boy, I get it.

682
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,982
Family, art.

683
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,901
It'll tear you in two.

684
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,655
You hear that?

685
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,159
Oh, yeah. My mom's
practicing. She's always...

686
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,785
Sha. You talk too much. Listen.

687
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,878
When she was a kid, already
she played like that.

688
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,716
She should have been a
concert piano player.

689
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:13,844
Little rubinstein, she was.

690
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,223
She could have played...

691
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,558
You name it, she could
have played there.

692
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:21,769
And she...

693
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:27,066
Once, I visited her and Tina
and menashe in Cincinnati,

694
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:31,028
and she says to me she wants
to be a great piano artist.

695
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,030
But she didn't do it.

696
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,532
Yeah, she's really good.

697
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:37,284
- You know, she played on TV.
- TV? Feh!

698
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:40,663
She could have played at
musikverein in Vienna.

699
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:45,834
You see, what she got in her
heart is what you got, what I got.

700
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,590
Like me. Like you, I think.

701
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:55,052
We're junkies, and
art is our drug.

702
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,804
Family, we love.

703
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,807
But art, we're meshuga for art.

704
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,185
You think I wanted to leave my
sisters, my mama and my papa,

705
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:06,021
and go stick my stupid
head in the mouth of lions?

706
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,233
Putting... putting your head
in a lion's mouth is art?

707
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:16,907
No. Sticking your head in the
mouths of lions was balls.

708
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:21,245
Making sure the lion don't
eat my head, that is art.

709
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,208
You see, Tina, she
didn't say to mitzi,

710
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,335
"go do what you gotta."

711
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:32,047
I mean, she was a good person,
my sister, but she was scared.

712
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:35,593
Scared for your mother. She
should have safety in the family.

713
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,761
So mitzi, she gave it all up.

714
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,766
I want you should
remember how that hurt.

715
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,144
Because when they say all this,

716
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,647
when they say, "what you do?
Oh, that's cute. It's a hobby.

717
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,608
It's like stamps or
butterfly collecting,"

718
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,651
you feel your face,
how it feels now.

719
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:53,986
Yeah, you almost pulled it off.

720
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,389
So you remember your uncle
Boris and what he's telling you.

721
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:59,241
Because you're going to
join the circus, I can tell.

722
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,784
You can't hardly wait.

723
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,369
You want to be in the big top.

724
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,663
You'll shovel elephant
shit until they say,

725
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:07,458
"okay, Sammy, now ride
the goddamn elephant."

726
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,335
Oh, you love those people, huh?

727
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:11,879
Your sisters, your mama,
your papa. Except...

728
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:14,798
Except this.

729
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:16,884
This, I think you
love a little more.

730
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,595
- No, I don't.
- Yeah.

731
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:24,808
Run all you want, boychik, but you
know I ain't whistling Dixie here.

732
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,812
You will make your movies,
and you will do your art.

733
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,981
And you'll remember how it hurt.

734
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,942
So you know what I'm saying?

735
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,738
Art will give you crowns in
heaven and laurels on earth.

736
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:39,740
But,

737
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,994
it'll tear your heart
out and leave you lonely.

738
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:46,372
You'll be a shanda
for your loved ones.

739
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:49,667
An exile in the desert. A gypsy.

740
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,003
Art is no game.

741
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:56,632
Art is dangerous as a lion's
mouth. It'll bite your head off.

742
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,010
Look at me.

743
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,098
Look at me.

744
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,810
Is it a wonder that Tina, she
wanted nothing to do with me?

745
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,187
With...

746
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:13,899
Oh, Tina. Oh, Tina!

747
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,235
Oh, Tina.

748
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,327
Stop, stop! Stop it!

749
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:28,288
What, you never saw
nobody grieving before?

750
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:35,003
Let's go to sleep, bubba/a.

751
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,723
You can sleep in the bed.
I have my sleeping bag.

752
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,183
I'm sitting Shiva for my
sister. I sleep on the floor.

753
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,227
You... you want to
sleep on the floor too?

754
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:54,273
She was your grandma. Tear your
clothes. Sleep on the floor.

755
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:57,443
Good night.

756
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:12,458
Say bye-bye.

757
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,001
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

758
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,840
I don't know what mama
was so worried about.

759
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,635
It was a nice visit.

760
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:03,952
Yuck.

761
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:16,756
Whoa.

762
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,847
Aw.

763
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,562
This is the life.

764
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:44,075
Only you can prevent
forest fires.

765
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:13,146
Mmm.

766
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,451
Oh.

767
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:32,832
It's so beautiful,
what you made, darling.

768
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:35,835
You really see me.

769
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,679
Hey, man. How about that, huh?

770
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,932
Hey, Sammy. That was real neat.

771
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,187
Die, amerikanei!

772
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,024
Move! Move! Fall backwards!

773
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,241
Attacke!

774
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:09,953
Cover!

775
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,337
Krauts, they're everywhere!

776
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,716
There's too many of them.

777
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,740
Turn.

778
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,491
Cut.

779
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,952
Great. Now, um...

780
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:53,913
Okay, come here.

781
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:59,252
Um, you're standing here a minute,
looking down at what just happened.

782
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,628
A whole minute?

783
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,964
I'll give you a signal when
I want you to start to move.

784
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:06,176
You mean I should count to 60? Like,
one Mississippi, two Mississippi...

785
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:10,972
No, no, no. No, don't. Don't
count to 60. You just gotta...

786
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:15,310
So... so you're all
like... Like, "oh, my god."

787
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:18,521
Like, "all my men,
they're all...

788
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:21,483
They're all dead. All my men."

789
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,735
So you want me to,
like, act and stuff.

790
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,321
Yeah.

791
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:29,949
Like I'm... I'm sort of sad or
something? Because my whole platoon...

792
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,369
Right, right, right.
Your platoon. Your...

793
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:36,873
Your men! They've
been wiped out.

794
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:39,793
These guys, they're your family.

795
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:45,215
Yourfamily's being,
like, murdered,

796
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,008
and it's your fault.

797
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,845
- You did this to them and...
- I thought it was the Nazis that...

798
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:55,058
Yeah, but it was you who gave the order
to go down into the valley of death. Okay?

799
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,851
You decided. Nobody else.

800
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:58,520
- You could've...
- Mm-hmm.

801
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,273
You could've
protected them. Okay?

802
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:04,442
'Cause they trusted you,

803
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:06,653
- and they loved you.
- Mm-hmm.

804
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:12,158
Now you're just
looking at this...

805
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:19,165
At this thing that
you've done and...

806
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,669
You can't save them anymore.

807
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,379
Because they're all dead.

808
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,800
- Wow, that's, uh...
- Yeah.

809
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,761
Real gung ho.

810
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,389
Okay.

811
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,598
Okay.

812
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:36,683
You good?

813
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,768
Lock and load. Yeah.
Lock and load. All right.

814
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:39,853
Good.

815
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,077
Uh, Sammy?

816
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,622
How far are you
gonna let him walk?

817
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,375
Cut!

818
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,716
Hey, that's a cut, Angelo.

819
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:53,801
- Angelo! Angelo!
- Angelo!

820
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:55,887
Come back! He said, "cut!"

821
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,222
Angelo, hey! Angelo!

822
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,521
- How about that kid?
- Bravo!

823
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:11,606
Bravo!

824
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,407
Sammy!

825
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:27,455
Darling!

826
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:31,292
You're not a civilian anymore.

827
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:35,004
That movie, my god! It was...

828
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:38,633
Hi, Mrs. Fabelman.

829
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:49,602
Mr. Demille! Come here.

830
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:53,398
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey.

831
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:54,708
Young man, congratulations.

832
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,776
I guess you based it on
your dad's war stories, huh?

833
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,579
Sort of. You know, but he doesn't
like to talk about it so...

834
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:01,823
- No, I understand.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

835
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:05,076
Dad, mom's getting a ride with
bennie. She'll see us at home.

836
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,763
- Hey, that last scene...
- Why do you like blood so much?

837
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:10,957
And are you ever gonna make a
movie with parts for girls again?

838
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:13,599
- What?
- With girls, you know.

839
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:16,421
'Cause all the men stare off
into the distance all the time,

840
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:18,089
maybe a girl could save the day.

841
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:22,802
Okay, what are the five steps
to save a drowning person?

842
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,722
One is you swim behind the
person so they don't grab you.

843
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:28,141
Two, you throw your
arm across his chest.

844
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,642
- Or her chest.
- Three.

845
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,811
Not Sammy. He's too
scared of girls' boobies.

846
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,355
Three, you swim on your back
with the victim on your chest,

847
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:35,999
using your free arm
to paddle yourself.

848
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:39,026
And speaking of boobies, if you
ever get any, we'll have a party.

849
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,279
And at the party, we'll
give her the booby prize.

850
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:43,823
Ha-ha. What's four?

851
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,538
- Crap.
- Bring the victim to land, dummy.

852
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,123
- Mmm.
- Then five?

853
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,585
Call the undertaker.

854
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:01,340
This is serious business.

855
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,801
I gotta know all of this to
get the lifesaving merit badge.

856
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:07,472
More kids die in swimming accidents
than in any other kind of accident.

857
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:08,681
Sorry. I'm sorry.

858
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:10,349
Not everything is a big joke.

859
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:12,852
Okay, okay. So what's
step number five?

860
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,646
You laugh at everything,
even when nothing's funny.

861
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,648
You always have to be
the center of attention.

862
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:19,066
Eat.

863
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,069
And don't talk with
your mouth full.

864
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:24,739
I'm not eating this crud
before a swimming test.

865
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,991
You can get cramps in the
water if you eat before,

866
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:28,785
and you can drown
from getting cramps!

867
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,036
Stop shouting at her!

868
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,622
Sammy fabelman, goddamn it!

869
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:35,917
For weeks now, it has been
nothing but disrespect from you!

870
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,251
Disrespect!

871
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:39,504
Why are you being such
a little shit to me?

872
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:41,005
Damn it to hell,
I am your mother!

873
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:43,132
I wish you weren't!

874
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,010
[Gasps}

875
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:09,784
Let me see.

876
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,328
Oh, my god.

877
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,746
Oh, what have I done?

878
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:20,795
Talk to me.

879
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:26,008
Sammy, please talk to me.
Tell me what's happening.

880
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:29,804
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

881
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,481
Don't go.

882
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:24,770
Mom.

883
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:27,231
Mom.

884
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:31,235
I won't tell.

885
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:35,406
I won't tell. I won't.

886
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:39,660
I won't tell.

887
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,078
I won't.

888
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:03,350
Sure about this?

889
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:06,312
Mm-hmm.

890
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:11,400
There you go.
Bought and paid for.

891
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:13,694
Oh, just a second.
It's in the back.

892
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:20,326
Stocking up on Kodak
before the big move?

893
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:21,243
No, I'm...

894
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:23,704
Smart. Film's cheaper
here than in California.

895
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:26,123
I bet everything's
more expensive there.

896
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:28,334
You're losing your
steadiest customer.

897
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:32,338
Him and his whole family,
they're moving west.

898
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,256
He just sold me his camera.

899
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:37,301
Oh, yeah? How come?

900
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:38,677
Says he's finished.

901
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:40,846
Sorry about the wait, Mr. Loewy.

902
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,765
We had to order it special.

903
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,266
You bought a camera?

904
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:50,022
It's for you!

905
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:52,399
I know how much you loved
using it for your war picture,

906
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:54,443
so I figured you ought
to have one of your own.

907
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:58,781
It's, um, a "bon voyage,"
"see you later, alligator,"

908
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,742
"I believe in you" present
from your uncle bennie.

909
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:14,380
Because it's from me?

910
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,884
This move? Huh?

911
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:22,429
This is your dad's
glory-hallelujah moment.

912
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:25,349
And oi va voi, Sammy, does
that guy ever deserve it.

913
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:27,768
All the way back
when, back at rca,

914
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:31,647
he knew what computing was gonna be about
before practically anybody else knew it.

915
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:34,733
And IBM?

916
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:37,069
That's where guys like Burt

917
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,655
are figuring out how to
use what he's made to...

918
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,408
They're gonna change
the whole goddamn world,

919
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,326
so this was the right decision.

920
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:50,124
For all sorts of reasons.

921
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,963
Yeah, so, I'm happy for you.

922
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,631
You know I am.

923
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,217
But I'm gonna miss you.

924
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:03,470
All of you, a lot.

925
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,189
You think whatever bad things
you want about me, kiddo.

926
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:16,192
But you stop making movies,
it'll break your mother's heart.

927
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:19,153
You will break her
heart. I mean it.

928
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:25,075
She doesn't deserve that. Not from
anybody, least of all from you.

929
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,674
I'll give you 35 bucks for it.

930
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,761
You drive a hard bargain, kid.

931
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,197
I'm still done making
movies, though.

932
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,700
Everybody makes
movies in California.

933
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:18,879
- Hey!
- Keep the change.

934
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:25,135
J” da doo Ron Ron
Ron da doo Ron Ron j”

935
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:28,180
j” somebody told me that
his name was bill j”

936
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,516
j” da doo Ron Ron Ron
da doo Ron Ron... j”

937
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:34,061
When will the new
house be finished?

938
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:36,188
A few months, in the spring.

939
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:38,816
Can I have my own room?

940
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:41,568
Everybody gets their own room.

941
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:42,987
- Yay!
- Yes.

942
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:52,621
I just remembered last
night, I had a funny dream.

943
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:53,998
What was it?

944
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:56,750
I... I can't believe
I dreamed this.

945
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:59,461
Uh... uh, bennie and me
were having an argument

946
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:02,673
and I hauled off and socked
him right in the nose!

947
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:06,552
J” yes, my oh myj”

948
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:09,847
j” and when he walked me home j”

949
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,473
j” da doo Ron Ron Ron j”

950
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,106
- What's wrong?
- Is mommy carsick?

951
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:21,191
Let's just give
her a little time.

952
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:46,925
Bennie and me, we never...

953
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:49,345
We never...

954
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:56,060
We never let it get as far
as I imagine you think.

955
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:59,188
Oh, I never imagined
any of that.

956
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,440
You think dad knows?

957
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:03,692
I don't... I don't mean...

958
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:06,028
I don't mean, "did you tell
him?" I know you didn't.

959
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:07,905
But...

960
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,746
But you think he has an inkling?

961
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:22,336
I've almost told
him so many times.

962
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:26,507
I'll say, "Burt, there's
something I've got to tell you."

963
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:30,177
Then he looks at me like he can't conceive
that anything could be wrong between us.

964
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:33,347
So instead I say,
"Burt, we got ants."

965
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,434
Or, "Burt, could you climb on
the roof and turn the antenna

966
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:40,562
so I can watch channel 5?"
Which, of course, he does.

967
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:48,612
I can't fight with your father.

968
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:53,450
He kills with such kindness.

969
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:58,163
I'm mean to him,
he buys me a dress.

970
01:21:58,247 --> 01:21:59,832
From saks.

971
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:06,463
Mom, when I showed you what I filmed, I
never meant for any of this to happen.

972
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:08,465
Oh... mmm.

973
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,929
Guilt is a wasted emotion.

974
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:22,563
What's gonna happen now?

975
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,277
I'm gonna be your mom.

976
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,779
I'm gonna be the girls' mom.

977
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:35,993
Despite my countless faults, I'm
not ruining everything for everyone.

978
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,828
I'm gonna not be selfish.

979
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:44,251
Burt fabelman is the
kindest, smartest, wisest,

980
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:48,839
most patient, most decent, most
understanding man there is,

981
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:51,175
and I'm gonna stay
married to him.

982
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:16,783
It's only a rental.

983
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:20,120
The new house will be ready faster
than you can say, "Jack Robinson."

984
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:22,080
Jack Robinson.

985
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,251
And we're still here.

986
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:30,315
Tell me if you're gonna mope
for the rest of your life,

987
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:31,779
or if it's something
you'll outgrow.

988
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,300
Bug off.

989
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:37,262
You're going for the misery merit
badge, you and mom with your long faces.

990
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,306
She can't even get out of
bed to make breakfast...

991
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:40,349
Okay, new rule, guys.

992
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:42,476
Um, when we walk to
school in the morning,

993
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:45,020
let's just leave all the
fabelman mishegoss behind us

994
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:46,855
in the fabelmans'
moldy old rental house.

995
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:48,190
So for eight hours a day,

996
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:51,527
let's be normal kids in an
ordinary, normal school, okay?

997
01:23:57,241 --> 01:24:02,538
It's like we got parachuted into the
land of the giant sequoia people.

998
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:04,248
All right.

999
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:08,502
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1000
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:13,423
Up over! Nice dig. Atta Johnson.

1001
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:23,016
Way to get up!

1002
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:25,394
Nice.

1003
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,731
Nice. Attababy, Logan.

1004
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,819
Do it again. Go again.

1005
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:38,282
Good work, guys.

1006
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:40,075
Keep the intensity. Keep moving.

1007
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:44,997
Rotate. Nice, Jake.
Good job, Chris.

1008
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:48,875
Fabelman, it won't hurt you.

1009
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:51,378
It's a volleyball,
not a cannonball.

1010
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:53,171
Let's go. Serve.

1011
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,882
Go! Attababy!

1012
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:58,468
That's good reactions.
Let's move. Let's...

1013
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:01,763
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

1014
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:03,265
I didn't... oh, my...

1015
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,767
- Come on.
- I'm gonna murder you, you piece of shit.

1016
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:07,019
Hey, Chad.

1017
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:10,355
Cool it.

1018
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:13,609
I... I did not mean to
do that. Are you okay?

1019
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:15,110
That really hurt, asshole.

1020
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:16,778
Watch your mouth, Logan.

1021
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:24,494
Go fetch the ball.

1022
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,080
Sure, yeah.

1023
01:25:28,582 --> 01:25:29,875
Let's go.

1024
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:35,005
Hey, new kid.

1025
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:36,840
What's your name?

1026
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:40,594
Sam.

1027
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:43,805
"Sam" what?

1028
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:48,185
Fabelman.

1029
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:52,689
Told you he's a kike.

1030
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:55,192
He doesn't like Jews.

1031
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:57,694
Nobody likes Jews.

1032
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:00,238
Except other Jews, right?

1033
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:04,326
Bagelman.

1034
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:07,245
No, that's not my name.
Don't call me that.

1035
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,665
So, you gave my best friend
a concussion, bagelman.

1036
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:11,083
No, I didn't. Leave me alone.

1037
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,501
Hey.

1038
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:14,419
Don't argue with me.

1039
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:16,213
A serious concussion.

1040
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,092
So, how do we make you pay?

1041
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,594
How about this?

1042
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:24,388
You're drinking
from the fountain.

1043
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:27,933
You never hear me come up
from behind you, and bam!

1044
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,477
I shatter your front
teeth all over the spigot.

1045
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,273
Hey, look at me.

1046
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:40,195
He's demented, like, medically.

1047
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:43,407
So watch out for yourself.

1048
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:09,057
Close the door!

1049
01:27:15,188 --> 01:27:16,606
Mom got a monkey.

1050
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:18,942
- Why'd you get a monkey?
- 'Cause I needed to laugh.

1051
01:27:23,196 --> 01:27:26,074
Oh, help me with this. The
directions don't make any sense.

1052
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:29,745
- Careful! Careful!
- Get down!

1053
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:31,913
I'll get a banana.

1054
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:35,542
Save the curtains.
They're rented.

1055
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,301
Oh!

1056
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:47,596
Uh, hello.

1057
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:50,307
- Who are you?
- He's mine.

1058
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:52,768
What are we gonna call him?

1059
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:56,521
Bennie. His name's bennie.

1060
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,739
I don't want to see
a psychiatrist, Burt.

1061
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:08,283
You're scaring the kids.
You're sleeping all day.

1062
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:10,952
Oh, I miss the desert.
I miss dry heat.

1063
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:13,246
You haven't even
unwrapped the piano.

1064
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:16,291
You aren't cooking or
shopping or unpacking.

1065
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:19,961
Psychiatrists help you know
why you're feeling something.

1066
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:22,130
They can't help you feel
something different.

1067
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:25,342
You're behaving like when your
mother died, like you're in mourning,

1068
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:26,968
but nobody's died.

1069
01:28:29,179 --> 01:28:30,430
Okay.

1070
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:34,476
So I'll call the
monkey some other name.

1071
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:50,867
IBM's out of his league, mitz.

1072
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:54,162
Bennie was... he...

1073
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:58,834
Is my best friend.

1074
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:00,919
But they don't need him.

1075
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:02,754
This is what I know.

1076
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,716
I don't need him either.

1077
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:11,513
Bennie wasn't your friend.

1078
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:14,891
But you knew he was mine.

1079
01:29:18,144 --> 01:29:19,312
What does that mean?

1080
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:19,289
Logan, I'm really,
really missing you.

1081
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,420
Hey! Who's there?

1082
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:27,964
Who's there?

1083
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:36,973
I heard that he had
such a crush on her.

1084
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:41,561
Bagelman, yo!

1085
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:56,826
I left you a little snack in
your locker. Did you like it?

1086
01:30:57,994 --> 01:30:59,162
Guess he wasn't hungry.

1087
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:01,081
He... he said it was...

1088
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:02,582
What'd you call it, Chad?

1089
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:03,667
Kosher!

1090
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,377
Knock it off, moron!

1091
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:08,129
We talked about this.

1092
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:12,342
Come on. We'll be
late for practice.

1093
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:17,055
So, what is this? You're Jewish?

1094
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:22,227
Well...

1095
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:25,730
Holy crap. He's got the hots so
bad, he can't even talk to her.

1096
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,440
No, I don't.

1097
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,568
Apologize to her.

1098
01:31:30,652 --> 01:31:32,737
For what?

1099
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:35,365
For making goo-goo eyes at
her, for drooling at her.

1100
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:37,784
I wasn't drooling at her.

1101
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:41,329
Then apologize to her
for killing Christ.

1102
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:43,748
Why are you encouraging him?

1103
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,209
Go on.

1104
01:31:46,292 --> 01:31:49,295
Apologize to her for
killing our lord.

1105
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:53,466
Don't go.

1106
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:56,136
- Come watch me run.
- No, thanks. I'm not in the mood now.

1107
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:57,655
Please. I run better
when you're there.

1108
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:00,849
Apologize to her, you
Christ-killing son of a bitch!

1109
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,267
I'm going home.

1110
01:32:04,978 --> 01:32:06,646
Go on and say sorry.

1111
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:08,815
You're getting me in
trouble with my girl.

1112
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:10,567
You know, obviously,

1113
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:13,319
since I'm not 2,000 years old
and have never been to Rome,

1114
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:14,738
I'm not apologizing.

1115
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,073
But hey, you know,

1116
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:19,284
maybe, uh, your boyfriend
should apologize to you

1117
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:22,620
for making out in the stainnell
half an hour ago with some redhead.

1118
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:26,124
He's lying. He's... I
didn't do that. I swear.

1119
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:28,334
You told me you were
finished with her.

1120
01:32:30,587 --> 01:32:33,173
Logan, you lied to me!

1121
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:36,593
Claudia.

1122
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:42,390
Om

1123
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:48,104
You made a mistake.

1124
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:50,440
Listen to me. You made a
mistake. You're gonna fix it.

1125
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:52,942
- Bash his head in!
- Shut up, Chad, goddamn it!

1126
01:32:53,026 --> 01:32:55,028
Tomorrow, you're gonna
find her first thing,

1127
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:56,751
and you're gonna tell
her you were lying.

1128
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:58,990
Say you were scared. Say
whatever you gotta say.

1129
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:02,869
But you tell her it wasn't true,
and you did not see me doing that.

1130
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:06,956
Or I swear, I will hurt you
worse than you've ever been hurt.

1131
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:10,085
You get me?

1132
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:12,962
Nod to show you dig
what I'm saying.

1133
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:27,435
He won't tell me who did this.

1134
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:29,312
Ask him who did this.

1135
01:33:30,355 --> 01:33:31,564
Tell your father who did this,

1136
01:33:31,648 --> 01:33:33,408
and he will drive to
that little shit's house

1137
01:33:33,483 --> 01:33:34,710
and he will beat
the crap out of him.

1138
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:35,735
Is your nose broken?

1139
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:38,499
Of course not. You think I'd be
sitting here if his nose was broken?

1140
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:40,740
- Who hit you?
- What do you care who it was?

1141
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:42,343
It's not like you'll
do anything about it.

1142
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:44,035
Tell me what happened first.

1143
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:46,121
What happened is I hate it here,

1144
01:33:46,204 --> 01:33:49,165
and what happened is you
brought us here because...

1145
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:51,501
Because I got a
betterjob, so we moved.

1146
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:53,670
You don't even
care where you are.

1147
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:56,881
You get to go to work, and
that could be in Iceland.

1148
01:33:56,965 --> 01:33:59,300
You're working with
your goddamn machines.

1149
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:02,720
So you get to be happy while
the rest of us are miser...

1150
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:03,805
Ma, don't!

1151
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:06,224
- You're bleeding on the carpet.
- It's a rental house!

1152
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:08,685
Do you even notice how
much we hate it here,

1153
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:11,855
where we're practically the
only Jewish people for miles

1154
01:34:11,938 --> 01:34:13,398
and everything is awful?

1155
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:18,069
Do you even care that
this is your fault?

1156
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:19,779
Everything that's happening now,

1157
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:23,074
just because you ran away from
home and took all of us with you!

1158
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:27,078
I came here so I could work ten times
harder with ten times the responsibility,

1159
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:29,164
which seems to have
escaped everybody.

1160
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:30,599
Could everyone settle?
I wanna say something.

1161
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:31,851
So I could build us a nice home.

1162
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:34,186
You didn't come here to build
houses or to work. You ran away!

1163
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:36,254
I think you have something
to say to me, Sammy!

1164
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:37,547
And if I'm right about that,

1165
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:39,674
then get it off your chest
and say it to my face!

1166
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:41,467
I started therapy!

1167
01:36:16,396 --> 01:36:17,480
Anyways,

1168
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:22,568
what I really wanted to say is that,
about yesterday, what I told you, is...

1169
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:24,487
It wasn't true, and I lied,

1170
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,781
and I'm sorry.

1171
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:28,783
But why?

1172
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:30,243
What did I ever do to you?

1173
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:31,828
Oh, no, no. It wasn't about you.

1174
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:34,289
Because that, like,
really, really wasn't cool.

1175
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:37,041
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Because I really love Logan.

1176
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:39,961
Yeah, she cried herself to sleep
thinking he cheated on her.

1177
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:42,422
You ought to be more considerate
of other people's feelings.

1178
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,345
Okay, but Logan told me
to say I killed Christ.

1179
01:36:44,424 --> 01:36:46,694
- That wasn't Logan. That was Chad.
- Why would he do that?

1180
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:49,053
Loganlaughed. He thought
it was hilarious.

1181
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:52,098
He's Jewish.

1182
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,434
You don't say.

1183
01:36:55,935 --> 01:36:58,187
Yeah, I mean, since the
day I was circumcised.

1184
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:07,780
So, how'd you know
she was a redhead?

1185
01:37:08,698 --> 01:37:10,616
- Oh, my god.
- Hmm?

1186
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:13,244
He was making out
with Renee Reynolds?

1187
01:37:15,872 --> 01:37:19,500
If you were lying, how'd
you know her hair color?

1188
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:31,971
Does it hurt?

1189
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:34,849
So, you don't believe in Jesus?

1190
01:37:34,932 --> 01:37:37,560
Monica's, like,
totally hot on Jesus.

1191
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:39,395
I can't imagine my
life without him.

1192
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:42,857
Well, we've managed
for, like, 5,000 years,

1193
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:45,068
so I guess it's possible.

1194
01:37:45,151 --> 01:37:46,191
Maybe we could...

1195
01:37:47,987 --> 01:37:51,240
I don't know, get
together and pray on it.

1196
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:55,661
What, like, you and me?

1197
01:37:55,745 --> 01:37:58,456
We can ask him to come
into your heart and...

1198
01:37:59,248 --> 01:38:01,918
You know, see what happens.

1199
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,255
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Sure. I mean...

1200
01:38:06,339 --> 01:38:09,050
That would be when? Like, today?

1201
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:15,723
It's a lot, huh?

1202
01:38:16,766 --> 01:38:19,644
It's sort of a shrine, almost.

1203
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:21,938
A shrine to guys.

1204
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,482
Lots of guys.

1205
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:25,733
They're sexy.

1206
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:28,528
I guess.

1207
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:34,367
I mean, not Jesus.

1208
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:36,202
Jesus is sexy.

1209
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:39,747
Isn't that, like,
a sin or something?

1210
01:38:39,831 --> 01:38:41,457
I don't know.

1211
01:38:41,541 --> 01:38:43,501
He came to us as a man,

1212
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:46,254
a handsome, young man.

1213
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:49,632
He could have come as
a girl, or an old man,

1214
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:51,384
or someone with leprosy, but...

1215
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:53,386
Nobody knows what he
really looked like.

1216
01:38:54,637 --> 01:38:57,098
Probably, he looked like you.

1217
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:59,058
Oh, because... because he was...

1218
01:38:59,142 --> 01:39:02,562
Jewish. A handsome Jewish boy.

1219
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:05,690
Just like you.

1220
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:23,708
Let's pray.

1221
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:31,632
Close your eyes.

1222
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:37,972
- Lord, I'm here with my friend Sammy...
- Sam.

1223
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:42,518
I'm here with my good
friend Sam, who's Jewish,

1224
01:39:42,602 --> 01:39:45,021
and he's a nice boy.

1225
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:49,525
Lord Jesus, he's good and brave,

1226
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:52,361
and he's funny, lord,

1227
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:56,199
and... and... I like him.

1228
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:01,829
Relax.

1229
01:40:07,251 --> 01:40:08,503
Ask.

1230
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:11,589
Ask him to come into you.

1231
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:13,090
Ask him to enter you.

1232
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:20,973
Hi there, Jesus.

1233
01:40:21,057 --> 01:40:23,893
It's me, Sam fabelman.

1234
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:27,438
If you're real,

1235
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:30,024
show me a sign or
something, and...

1236
01:40:30,107 --> 01:40:33,945
No, you can't ask Jesus to
do tricks to impress you.

1237
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:35,530
You have to be humble.

1238
01:40:35,613 --> 01:40:37,990
You have to beg
him to. I'll do it.

1239
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:42,203
I'm gonna beg the holy
spirit to come into me.

1240
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:45,039
I'm gonna draw the
spirit in with my breath.

1241
01:40:46,999 --> 01:40:49,669
Spirit, come into me!

1242
01:40:49,752 --> 01:40:51,212
Please, holy spirit!

1243
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:55,508
I'm begging you, sweet holy father,
for the sake of my friend Sammy.

1244
01:40:55,591 --> 01:40:56,801
Sam.

1245
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:58,553
Come into us, Jesus!

1246
01:40:58,636 --> 01:41:00,263
Hear our prayer!

1247
01:41:01,264 --> 01:41:02,265
Open your mouth.

1248
01:41:02,348 --> 01:41:05,851
Open your mouth and take the
spirit of Christ into you.

1249
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:35,482
Monica, Sammy, I
made you snacks.

1250
01:41:35,506 --> 01:41:36,507
We're coming.

1251
01:41:38,301 --> 01:41:41,220
Tomorrow after school, wanna meet
out back behind the bleachers?

1252
01:41:41,304 --> 01:41:42,888
- Yeah.
- Cool.

1253
01:41:42,972 --> 01:41:44,307
We can pray some more.

1254
01:41:55,067 --> 01:41:57,987
When I was a girl
and I felt sad,

1255
01:41:58,070 --> 01:42:00,448
I'd go to the zoo and
I'd watch the monkeys.

1256
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:01,866
They made you laugh?

1257
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:03,868
Yeah, yeah, the monkeyshines.

1258
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:07,913
But there was more to
it than that. It was...

1259
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:10,875
They understand what
we've done to them,

1260
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:13,252
with the cages and
the people pointing.

1261
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:16,881
We share that with them, the
truth of how cruel people are.

1262
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:18,549
But if you watch
them for long enough,

1263
01:42:18,633 --> 01:42:21,177
you can tell they know stuff
we can't begin to imagine.

1264
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:23,429
Important stuff.

1265
01:42:23,512 --> 01:42:27,475
And they're not gonna let us in
on it because it belongs to them.

1266
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:30,728
It's their own monkey business.
Theirs, it's not ours. It's...

1267
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:34,440
Oh, I don't know.

1268
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:36,942
Self-possession.

1269
01:42:37,026 --> 01:42:38,319
Right.

1270
01:42:40,237 --> 01:42:42,031
They belong to themselves.

1271
01:42:42,782 --> 01:42:45,201
If it belongs to itself,

1272
01:42:45,284 --> 01:42:47,370
let it go back to
where it came from.

1273
01:42:47,453 --> 01:42:49,538
Anyway, that's how
come I got a monkey.

1274
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:50,831
And a therapist.

1275
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:53,292
He throws his poop.

1276
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:55,044
The therapist?

1277
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:56,212
No, the monkey.

1278
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:58,089
That's why I'm
staying in a hotel.

1279
01:42:58,172 --> 01:43:00,466
You don't have to. We
have plenty of room.

1280
01:43:00,549 --> 01:43:04,261
My rabbi in New Jersey says a
monkey in the house isn't kosher.

1281
01:43:04,345 --> 01:43:05,930
That's why we're not
going to eat him.

1282
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:08,099
Did you schedule him
for his polio vaccine?

1283
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:09,451
- They can get polio?
- Pass the peas.

1284
01:43:09,475 --> 01:43:11,727
They're susceptible to
everything humans are, so yes.

1285
01:43:11,811 --> 01:43:13,104
He hates going to the vet.

1286
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:17,233
You see, Monica, in this family, it's
the scientists versus the artists.

1287
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:20,611
Sammy's on my team. Takes after
me, except he's got real talent.

1288
01:43:20,695 --> 01:43:21,821
Mom.

1289
01:43:21,904 --> 01:43:25,074
- And he's completely terrible at science.
- Mmm. And algebra.

1290
01:43:25,157 --> 01:43:26,242
And sports.

1291
01:43:26,325 --> 01:43:28,619
- Will you please stop?
- He showed me his camera.

1292
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:31,330
- Is he good at kissing?
- I'll tell you later.

1293
01:43:31,414 --> 01:43:32,415
Shut up.

1294
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:34,726
- He sleeps with a camera under his pillow.
- No, I don't.

1295
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:36,460
But he refuses to
actually shoot anything.

1296
01:43:36,544 --> 01:43:39,004
He should shoot ditch day!

1297
01:43:39,088 --> 01:43:41,757
They still don't have a
photographer. You could volunteer.

1298
01:43:41,841 --> 01:43:43,259
- What's ditch day?
- I'm not going.

1299
01:43:43,342 --> 01:43:45,028
Something seniors do
at the end of the year.

1300
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:46,892
They let us pretend like
we're ditching school,

1301
01:43:46,929 --> 01:43:48,806
and we all take buses to
Santa Cruz main beach.

1302
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:51,308
You have to go! Everyone goes.

1303
01:43:51,392 --> 01:43:53,144
My dad will lend you his camera.

1304
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:55,730
It's super fancy. Costs,
like, a thousand dollars.

1305
01:43:55,813 --> 01:43:58,733
It's called like a... An
"air" something. I forget.

1306
01:43:58,816 --> 01:44:00,568
- Wait. Not an arriflex?
- Right!

1307
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:03,487
Your dad owns a 16 mm arriflex?

1308
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:07,032
Wow. Wow, okay. So,
16 mm on stock...

1309
01:44:07,116 --> 01:44:10,202
Usually it's a teacher who shoots the
ditch day movie, and it's a big joke.

1310
01:44:10,286 --> 01:44:11,805
At ten bucks a roll
for a whole day...

1311
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:14,349
- I owe you a graduation check.
- That'd be insanely expensive.

1312
01:44:14,373 --> 01:44:15,933
My dad'll get the
school to pay for it.

1313
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,440
I have no idea how much renting
a 16 mm editing machine costs.

1314
01:44:18,502 --> 01:44:20,480
- It's not gonna work.
- My dad will rent one for you.

1315
01:44:20,504 --> 01:44:22,757
We can rent it whatever
it costs, right?

1316
01:44:23,883 --> 01:44:25,050
Bun?

1317
01:44:27,219 --> 01:44:29,263
Uh, what's wrong
with your bolex?

1318
01:44:29,346 --> 01:44:31,116
Oh, you could afford to
be a little encouraging.

1319
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:32,308
About what?

1320
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:34,769
About him making movies again.

1321
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:36,371
I didn't say that.
I'm just talking...

1322
01:44:36,395 --> 01:44:38,647
- Maybe he's moved on.
- On from what?

1323
01:44:38,731 --> 01:44:40,900
He hasn't picked up his
camera once since we got here.

1324
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:44,528
He'll be going to college this September.
Maybe his feelings about it have changed.

1325
01:44:44,612 --> 01:44:46,989
He's growing up. I'm
enthusiastic about that.

1326
01:44:47,072 --> 01:44:48,282
Filming is what he loves.

1327
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:50,510
- Oh, Jesus Christ. Sorry.
- He shouldn't abandon what he loves.

1328
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:52,203
Can we please just
stop talking about me?

1329
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:54,830
I'd think you more than anyone
should have some understanding...

1330
01:44:54,914 --> 01:44:56,624
Let's go to your
place or something.

1331
01:44:56,707 --> 01:44:58,959
Of what a vocation,
a calling is.

1332
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:01,128
All right. We'll rent
him the equipment.

1333
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:03,923
He hates the beach. That's why he
doesn't want to go to ditch day.

1334
01:45:04,006 --> 01:45:08,177
But it's not your calling. Is that
why you can't, uh, respect it?

1335
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:10,304
I have respect for everything
he works hard doing.

1336
01:45:10,387 --> 01:45:11,388
He's afraid.

1337
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:13,272
He's scared those guys
will beat him up again.

1338
01:45:13,349 --> 01:45:15,643
No, I'm not. I never said
that I was scared of them.

1339
01:45:15,726 --> 01:45:16,852
You got beat up?

1340
01:45:16,936 --> 01:45:19,063
You always dismiss what
he does, what anyone does,

1341
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:20,856
that's playful or imaginative

1342
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,983
as a pastime or a hobby.

1343
01:45:23,067 --> 01:45:24,527
You already won, mitz.

1344
01:45:25,277 --> 01:45:26,755
I surrendered. I'm
not taking the bait.

1345
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:29,031
Can you guys please cut it
out? You're embarrassing me.

1346
01:45:29,114 --> 01:45:31,593
I said I'd take him for his polio
shot the first five times you asked.

1347
01:45:31,617 --> 01:45:34,495
You say you will, but I
guess you don't mean it.

1348
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:37,164
- So I ask again and again.
- He's scared of shots!

1349
01:45:37,248 --> 01:45:38,999
He's scared of the doctor.

1350
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:43,921
I am taking the goddamn
monkey to the vet, okay?

1351
01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:46,757
Probably needs a tranquilizer
with all this yelling.

1352
01:45:46,841 --> 01:45:48,926
Can you ask your dad about
borrowing the camera?

1353
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:50,803
He'll say yes.

1354
01:45:50,886 --> 01:45:52,054
Thank you.

1355
01:45:52,847 --> 01:45:54,014
Filming ditch day.

1356
01:45:55,432 --> 01:45:57,309
I think it's a great idea.

1357

01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,360

j” and take a look at a fool j”

j” he has got a heart

1375

j” come on, everybody he

1376
01:46:59,204 --> 01:47:02,917
j” and no one could tell his

1377
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,252
j” well, the joke's on me j”

1378
01:47:05,336 --> 01:47:07,212
j” I'm off to join the circus j”

1379
01:47:07,922 --> 01:47:11,634
j” oh, ll/lr barnum,

1380
01:47:11,717 --> 01:47:15,804
j” shoot me out of a

01:47:21,518 --> 01:47:23,729

01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:35,741
j” goodbye, cruel worldj”

1387
01:47:38,035 --> 01:47:40,037
j” goodbye, cruel worldj”

1388
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:06,999
Don't be scared.

1389
01:49:13,464 --> 01:49:16,008
Your mom misses
Phoenix too much.

1390
01:49:17,301 --> 01:49:18,552
Tell them the truth.

1391
01:49:18,635 --> 01:49:22,181
And I can't leave. This
is where my work is.

1392
01:49:22,264 --> 01:49:23,265
I have to...

1393
01:49:23,348 --> 01:49:25,392
That's crazy. You don't...

1394
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:28,812
You can't ruin everything

1395
01:49:28,896 --> 01:49:32,483
because you miss one place and
you're stuck some place else.

1396
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:35,152
I miss bennie too much.

1397
01:49:35,235 --> 01:49:36,445
So?

1398
01:49:36,528 --> 01:49:38,113
We all miss him.

1399
01:49:38,947 --> 01:49:41,075
This is a different
kind of missing.

1400
01:49:41,909 --> 01:49:43,035
Because what?

1401
01:49:44,203 --> 01:49:45,871
You love bennie?

1402
01:49:45,954 --> 01:49:47,331
Don't you love daddy?

1403
01:49:47,414 --> 01:49:48,457
Sure she does.

1404
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:50,667
- Of course I love dad.
- And I love mom.

1405
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:52,920
Then why is this all
of a sudden happening?

1406
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:54,588
Stay together!

1407
01:49:54,671 --> 01:49:57,549
You love each other,
and you love us.

1408
01:49:57,633 --> 01:49:59,218
And we don't want this.

1409
01:49:59,301 --> 01:50:01,470
We don't want to have
to move back and forth

1410
01:50:01,553 --> 01:50:02,697
and not live with both of you.

1411
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:04,598
We can't! Dad, we can't!

1412
01:50:04,681 --> 01:50:06,558
You're always so mean to him!

1413
01:50:06,642 --> 01:50:08,435
That's why you're
getting divorced!

1414
01:50:08,519 --> 01:50:10,020
It's because of you!

1415
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:13,565
Don't blame your mom. This
wasn't her idea. It was mine.

1416
01:50:13,649 --> 01:50:14,733
Don't say that.

1417
01:50:14,817 --> 01:50:16,568
No, it wasn't.

1418
01:50:16,652 --> 01:50:19,113
She just said it was because
of bennie, so stop lying!

1419
01:50:19,196 --> 01:50:20,781
Both of you stop lying!

1420
01:50:20,864 --> 01:50:23,408
I'm giving your mom a chance

1421
01:50:23,492 --> 01:50:28,497
to go back to Phoenix to live...

1422
01:50:54,982 --> 01:50:58,819
I don't understand how you can go back
to your beach blanket movie after that.

1423
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:01,280
We're different, I guess.

1424
01:51:17,462 --> 01:51:19,381
Is she gonna marry bennie?

1425
01:51:20,465 --> 01:51:22,384
If she wants to, she will.

1426
01:51:24,052 --> 01:51:26,388
God, she's the most selfish
person in the world.

1427
01:51:26,471 --> 01:51:27,890
It must've been hard for her,

1428
01:51:27,973 --> 01:51:31,143
married to a... a genius.

1429
01:51:31,852 --> 01:51:33,770
Dad worships mom.

1430
01:51:33,854 --> 01:51:35,147
Okay.

1431
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:38,066
But maybe it's hard,

1432
01:51:39,151 --> 01:51:42,237
being worshipped by someone you
know you'll never be as good as,

1433
01:51:42,321 --> 01:51:44,990
or ever do anything
as good as. She...

1434
01:51:46,909 --> 01:51:48,744
She laughs at bennie's jokes...

1435
01:51:51,205 --> 01:51:53,874
But dad's always been
her best audience.

1436
01:51:53,957 --> 01:51:55,375
Come on.

1437
01:51:56,335 --> 01:51:57,961
She'll be fine.

1438
01:51:58,045 --> 01:52:00,964
She'll tell herself everything
happens for a reason.

1439
01:52:01,048 --> 01:52:03,508
She'll make excuses
like she always does.

1440
01:52:03,592 --> 01:52:05,177
You're way more
selfish than her.

1441
01:52:06,345 --> 01:52:08,972
That's why you're angry at her.

1442
01:52:09,056 --> 01:52:11,058
It's because she's scared,

1443
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:13,685
just like you, Sammy.

1444
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:19,191
Out of everyone in
this out of control,

1445
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:21,568
falling-apart family,

1446
01:52:22,653 --> 01:52:25,572
the one who's most
like mitzi is you.

1447
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:29,743
Wait.

1448
01:52:32,287 --> 01:52:35,874
Before I show this to the whole school,
could you please watch it with me?

1449
01:52:54,601 --> 01:52:57,980
J” also seems kinda shy j”

1450
01:52:58,063 --> 01:53:00,857
j” makes me wonder if I j”

1451
01:53:00,941 --> 01:53:04,653
j” should even give
him a try... j”

1452
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:10,909
J” he can't shy away forever!”

1453
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:13,745
J” and I'm gonna
make him mine... j”

1454
01:53:23,755 --> 01:53:25,090
Hold your breath!

1455
01:53:33,056 --> 01:53:34,308
Here.

1456
01:53:34,391 --> 01:53:36,601
Oh, wow!

1457
01:53:47,988 --> 01:53:50,157
Did you find Jesus?

1458
01:53:51,658 --> 01:53:53,327
In a jewelry store.

1459
01:54:05,339 --> 01:54:08,675
J” if you see me walking
down the street j”

1460
01:54:08,759 --> 01:54:13,055
j” and / start to ciy
each time we meetj”

1461
01:54:14,014 --> 01:54:16,850
j” walk on byj”

1462
01:54:18,810 --> 01:54:21,521
j” walk on byj”

1463
01:54:22,647 --> 01:54:26,818
j” make believe that you
don't see the tears j”

1464
01:54:26,902 --> 01:54:33,241
j” just let me grieve in private
'cause each time lsee you j”

1465
01:54:33,325 --> 01:54:35,035
so in September
when I move to la,

1466
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:37,287
I'm gonna try and get
work in a movie studio.

1467
01:54:37,788 --> 01:54:39,623
Thought you were
going to college.

1468
01:54:40,832 --> 01:54:41,917
Could you...

1469
01:54:43,919 --> 01:54:45,712
Would you ever consider
coming with me?

1470
01:54:45,796 --> 01:54:48,924
I'm going to Texas
a&m. You know that.

1471
01:54:49,508 --> 01:54:51,718
Yes, I do.

1472
01:54:51,802 --> 01:54:54,262
But I thought...

1473
01:54:56,264 --> 01:54:59,101
Maybe you should change
your mind, because“.

1474
01:55:02,813 --> 01:55:04,648
Because what?

1475
01:55:06,358 --> 01:55:07,859
Because I love you.

1476
01:55:08,443 --> 01:55:09,569
- Ow, Sammy!
- Sorry!

1477
01:55:09,653 --> 01:55:11,321
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

1478
01:55:12,697 --> 01:55:15,409
That's not possible.

1479
01:55:16,451 --> 01:55:18,995
What? No, it is.
Monica, I love you.

1480
01:55:20,372 --> 01:55:22,499
That's impossible. Sammy...

1481
01:55:22,582 --> 01:55:23,583
Sam.

1482
01:55:24,918 --> 01:55:26,962
We only started dating, like...

1483
01:55:29,756 --> 01:55:32,467
Everything was so normal
before. Why are you acting so...

1484
01:55:32,551 --> 01:55:34,678
No, because
nothing's normal now.

1485
01:55:34,761 --> 01:55:36,179
They're getting a divorce.

1486
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:39,975
What are you talking about?

1487
01:55:40,684 --> 01:55:42,644
My mom and dad,
they're splitting up.

1488
01:55:46,731 --> 01:55:49,401
Jesus Christ! This is prom!

1489
01:55:49,484 --> 01:55:52,070
You can't just blurt something
out like that at prom!

1490
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:53,905
Wait.

1491
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:56,158
J” don't stop j”

1492
01:55:56,241 --> 01:55:57,367
Monica!

1493
01:55:57,451 --> 01:55:59,661
Look, that's... that's got
nothing to do with us, okay?

1494
01:55:59,744 --> 01:56:02,330
That's not why I said that I
love you. I don't know why I...

1495
01:56:02,414 --> 01:56:05,125
I'm not gonna change my whole
life and move to Hollywood

1496
01:56:05,208 --> 01:56:08,503
because your parents are
having marital difficulties.

1497
01:56:24,561 --> 01:56:26,980
You can get a refund. I
hardly wore it at all.

1498
01:56:30,567 --> 01:56:32,986
Are you breaking up with me?

1499
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:37,199
Not at prom, but of
course, eventually.

1500
01:56:40,911 --> 01:56:42,245
I'm gonna pray on it.

1501
01:56:42,871 --> 01:56:46,750
And I'm gonna pray really,
really hard for you

1502
01:56:46,833 --> 01:56:49,878
because you're such a
fun boy to kiss, but...

1503
01:56:49,961 --> 01:56:52,464
Thank you. Thank you.

1504
01:56:52,547 --> 01:56:55,091
Wonderful. Wonderful.

1505
01:56:55,175 --> 01:56:58,553
Let's thank our band
for that great music.

1506
01:56:59,304 --> 01:57:01,723
Sometimes we just
can't fix things, Sam,

1507
01:57:03,183 --> 01:57:06,978
and all we can do is suffer.

1508
01:57:08,688 --> 01:57:11,733
Now we're gonna take a
little break from the dancing

1509
01:57:12,317 --> 01:57:15,737
for a very special moment
for the class of 1964.

1510
01:57:17,489 --> 01:57:20,825
Mr. Samuel fabelman,
where are you?

1511
01:57:21,535 --> 01:57:23,036
Where is he?

1512
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:24,412
Okay.

1513
01:57:25,205 --> 01:57:26,623
Bagelman!

1514
01:57:26,706 --> 01:57:29,376
Bagelman! Bagelman!

1515
01:57:29,459 --> 01:57:31,545
Okay, face this
way. Grab a chair.

1516
01:57:31,628 --> 01:57:33,672
Let's all get close
to the screen.

1517
01:57:34,923 --> 01:57:36,383
Right up front.

1518
01:57:36,466 --> 01:57:37,551
Very good.

1519
01:57:39,344 --> 01:57:42,722
Mr. Fabelman, this
is your big moment.

1520
01:57:44,015 --> 01:57:47,852
We're ready to watch your
technicolor masterpiece.

1521
01:57:48,979 --> 01:57:51,773
Ditch day 1964.

1522
01:57:56,903 --> 01:58:00,782
And as they say way down
south in hollywoodland,

1523
01:58:00,865 --> 01:58:02,325
"lights...

1524
01:58:02,409 --> 01:58:06,288
Lights, camera, action!"

1525
01:58:15,338 --> 01:58:17,966
J” if you wanna be happy
for the rest of your life j”

1526
01:58:18,049 --> 01:58:20,176
j” never make a pretty
woman your wife j”

1527

J” hey, let's do

j” la, la, la, la, la, la j”

1571
02:01:40,877 --> 02:01:42,712
Let's go! Come on!

1572
02:01:44,297 --> 02:01:46,424
No, no. No, no. No.

1573
02:01:48,927 --> 02:01:52,013
Logan, you were so
incredible up there.

1574
02:01:52,096 --> 02:01:53,389
It was amazing...

1575
02:02:26,756 --> 02:02:28,007
Why'd you do that?

1576
02:02:31,928 --> 02:02:32,929
What?

1577
02:02:33,012 --> 02:02:34,973
Why'd you make me
look like that?

1578
02:02:38,017 --> 02:02:40,186
- In the film?
- Yes, in the film!

1579
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:42,105
Oh, shit! Shit.

1580
02:02:44,107 --> 02:02:45,608
What's the matter with you?

1581
02:02:45,692 --> 02:02:48,695
I've been a... a total asshole
to you. I broke your nose.

1582
02:02:48,778 --> 02:02:49,946
You didn't break my nose.

1583
02:02:50,029 --> 02:02:52,574
Then you go and make me look
like that. What's wrong with you?

1584
02:02:52,657 --> 02:02:55,785
Logan, all I did was hold the
camera, and it saw what it saw.

1585
02:02:55,869 --> 02:02:56,703
Oh, bullshit!

1586
02:02:56,786 --> 02:02:58,955
Fabelman, you made
me look like...

1587
02:02:59,038 --> 02:03:02,000
- Like this golden kind of thing.
- Yeah.

1588
02:03:02,083 --> 02:03:04,186
And Claudia just kissed me
in front of the whole school.

1589
02:03:04,210 --> 02:03:05,211
Mazel tov.

1590
02:03:05,295 --> 02:03:07,773
- I treat her shittier than I treat you.
- You're welcome, man.

1591
02:03:07,797 --> 02:03:09,757
No, no. Don't go. Don't go.

1592
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,385
I wanna know why you did that.

1593
02:03:14,178 --> 02:03:16,180
I don't know. I ought to
have my head examined.

1594
02:03:16,264 --> 02:03:18,850
Am I supposed to feel bad now
about all that shit we did to you?

1595
02:03:18,933 --> 02:03:21,537
- Do you feel bad about all that...
- That's none of your business!

1596
02:03:21,561 --> 02:03:23,813
- Because you should feel bad...
- That's why you did it!

1597
02:03:23,897 --> 02:03:27,525
I wanted you to be nice
to me for five minutes!

1598
02:03:28,067 --> 02:03:31,571
Or I did it to make my movie
better. I don't know why.

1599
02:03:31,654 --> 02:03:35,617
You are the biggestjerk I've
ever met in my entire life!

1600
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:38,912
I have a monkey at home
that's smarter than you!

1601
02:03:38,995 --> 02:03:42,332
You dumb, anti-semitic asshole!

1602
02:03:43,291 --> 02:03:45,293
I made you look
like you could fly.

1603
02:03:46,544 --> 02:03:48,212
But I can't fly.

1604
02:03:48,296 --> 02:03:50,757
I can outrun any guy
in Santa Clara county,

1605
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:52,258
and I worked real
hard to do that.

1606
02:03:52,342 --> 02:03:56,012
But you... you make me feel like I'm
some kind of failure or a phony, or...

1607
02:03:56,095 --> 02:03:58,556
Or like I'm supposed to be
some guy I'm never gonna be,

1608
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:00,099
not even in my dreams.

1609
02:04:00,183 --> 02:04:02,560
You took that guy, whoever he
is, wherever you got him from,

1610
02:04:02,644 --> 02:04:05,647
and you put him up there on
that screen and told everyone...

1611
02:04:05,730 --> 02:04:09,067
Everyone that that's me. And
that's not me. That's... it's...

1612
02:04:10,985 --> 02:04:12,278
Goddamn it!

1613
02:04:12,362 --> 02:04:13,696
Goddamn it!

1614
02:04:17,951 --> 02:04:20,453
Jesus. It wasn't supposed
to make you upset.

1615
02:04:20,536 --> 02:04:21,996
I didn't mean to freak you out.

1616
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:24,499
Who cares what you meant?

1617
02:04:26,501 --> 02:04:27,835
Fabelman!

1618
02:04:29,462 --> 02:04:30,838
Oh, shit.

1619
02:04:30,922 --> 02:04:32,632
You liar! You backstabbing liar!

1620
02:04:32,715 --> 02:04:34,509
I'm gonna beat your... god...

1621
02:04:46,229 --> 02:04:49,941
You totally bought it, his whole
snow job. You ate it up. You moron.

1622
02:04:50,024 --> 02:04:52,902
Logan, you are so
conceited and dumb.

1623
02:05:18,928 --> 02:05:20,430
Is something about to happen?

1624
02:05:22,223 --> 02:05:24,183
You like living
dangerously, fabelman.

1625
02:05:24,267 --> 02:05:25,560
No, I really, really don't.

1626
02:05:25,643 --> 02:05:27,478
Yes, you do.

1627
02:05:27,562 --> 02:05:30,440
But you tell anybody
about me getting, um,

1628
02:05:31,357 --> 02:05:32,442
upset

1629
02:05:33,192 --> 02:05:34,569
that would be a mistake.

1630
02:05:37,113 --> 02:05:39,615
Our secret. Okay?

1631
02:05:40,575 --> 02:05:41,576
Definitely.

1632
02:05:45,913 --> 02:05:47,665
Unless I make a movie about it.

1633
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:51,502
Which I'm never ever gonna do.

1634
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:18,738
You never...

1635
02:06:20,656 --> 02:06:21,741
What's it like?

1636
02:06:24,327 --> 02:06:27,163
It kinda shows you how out
of control everything is,

1637
02:06:27,747 --> 02:06:31,709
and how you're... You're
not in charge of anything.

1638
02:06:34,670 --> 02:06:36,756
And... and how it
doesn't matter.

1639
02:06:36,839 --> 02:06:38,257
I better not.

1640
02:06:39,759 --> 02:06:42,261
In my head, everything's
already out of control.

1641
02:06:44,764 --> 02:06:47,100
You're full of shit.

1642
02:06:47,183 --> 02:06:49,477
I gotta split. Claudia's
waiting for me.

1643
02:06:55,274 --> 02:06:57,902
Life's nothing like
the movies, fabelman.

1644
02:06:58,945 --> 02:07:01,322
Maybe not. But hey, in the end,

1645
02:07:02,782 --> 02:07:04,117
you got the girl.

1646
02:07:27,932 --> 02:07:30,309
Must have been some night.

1647
02:07:33,896 --> 02:07:35,773
Did Monica like the corsage?

1648
02:07:35,857 --> 02:07:38,442
- Yeah.
- Well, I told you she would.

1649
02:07:47,034 --> 02:07:48,703
That time when I hit you...

1650
02:07:49,996 --> 02:07:51,664
In... in Phoenix, when I...

1651
02:07:52,248 --> 02:07:54,208
Oh, god. You remember.

1652
02:07:56,627 --> 02:07:57,837
Not really.

1653
02:07:58,921 --> 02:08:02,216
Oh, for the love of god. It's not like
I spent my whole life hitting you.

1654
02:08:02,884 --> 02:08:05,595
Once. I hit you once.

1655
02:08:05,678 --> 02:08:07,263
It should have been memorable.

1656
02:08:07,346 --> 02:08:08,514
Before the swimming test.

1657
02:08:08,598 --> 02:08:11,809
Yes, before the swimming
test. Yes. I... I...

1658
02:08:12,852 --> 02:08:16,147
I s... slapped you
on your back...

1659
02:08:17,899 --> 02:08:19,901
As hard as I could. I
screwed up your tryouts.

1660
02:08:19,984 --> 02:08:23,064
And you couldn't get your merit badge,
and then you couldn't make eagle scout.

1661
02:08:23,112 --> 02:08:25,281
Ma, I made eagle scout.
It wasn't a big deal.

1662
02:08:25,364 --> 02:08:29,160
And I left a goddamn Mark on your
skin in the sh-sh-shape of my hand.

1663
02:08:29,243 --> 02:08:32,163
And I need you to say you
forgive me for doing that.

1664
02:08:32,246 --> 02:08:35,333
- Well, okay. I forgive you.
- Because... because...

1665
02:08:36,459 --> 02:08:37,627
Because you're my kid.

1666
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:38,711
Mom, I forgive you.

1667
02:08:38,794 --> 02:08:42,506
And... and my kids mean more to me
than anything else on the earth.

1668
02:08:42,590 --> 02:08:44,258
Mom, I forgive
you. I forgive you.

1669
02:08:44,342 --> 02:08:47,053
Please, because how am I ever
gonna forgive myself? I can't.

1670
02:08:47,136 --> 02:08:48,387
Mom, I... I...

1671
02:08:48,930 --> 02:08:50,431
I forgive you.

1672
02:08:50,514 --> 02:08:52,308
The eggs are burning.

1673
02:08:52,391 --> 02:08:54,393
Oh, god.

1674
02:08:59,232 --> 02:09:01,817
I'm doing this thing.

1675
02:09:03,361 --> 02:09:06,197
And I... I don't know
if it's the right thing,

1676
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:10,284
but it's a life-and-death
thing for me, and I'm sorry,

1677
02:09:10,368 --> 02:09:13,204
but everybody else is gonna
have to hang on for dear life.

1678
02:09:13,287 --> 02:09:18,251
And somehow, we will
survive this, all of us.

1679
02:09:19,418 --> 02:09:22,088
Even your father, who I
adore with all my heart.

1680
02:09:22,171 --> 02:09:25,758
He deserves so much better
than what I'm doing, but...

1681
02:09:29,136 --> 02:09:30,888
But bennie needs me, Dolly.

1682
02:09:32,014 --> 02:09:33,266
And I need him.

1683
02:09:34,350 --> 02:09:37,645
So much so that without him, I'm
turning into someone I don't know,

1684
02:09:37,728 --> 02:09:39,814
and none of you will
know me anymore.

1685
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:44,610
I'll just be that hateful person who
did that terrible thing to your back.

1686
02:09:44,694 --> 02:09:48,781
And yes, this is the most
selfish thing I have ever done.

1687
02:09:48,864 --> 02:09:52,285
But I've gotta do this
now because, Sammy,

1688
02:09:53,786 --> 02:09:56,163
you do what your heart
says you have to,

1689
02:09:57,164 --> 02:09:59,458
because you don't
owe anyone your life.

1690
02:10:01,043 --> 02:10:02,420
Not even me.

1691
02:10:09,385 --> 02:10:13,222
Oh. Are they ruined? I...
I can make some more.

1692
02:10:14,098 --> 02:10:16,851
Oh, no, no. I like 'em burnt.

1693
02:10:21,522 --> 02:10:23,566
So Monica dumped me.

1694
02:10:23,649 --> 02:10:24,900
She did?

1695
02:10:25,609 --> 02:10:27,778
Yeah, after I told
her about the divorce.

1696
02:10:29,030 --> 02:10:30,031
Huh?

1697
02:10:31,741 --> 02:10:34,285
Probably shouldn't have
asked her to marry me.

1698
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:36,454
- You did not.
- All but...

1699
02:10:36,537 --> 02:10:38,372
You did?

1700
02:10:40,124 --> 02:10:42,960
- In so many words.
- Poor girl.

1701
02:11:04,774 --> 02:11:05,775
Dad?

1702
02:11:09,904 --> 02:11:11,989
Hey, dad, I'm home.

1703
02:11:23,751 --> 02:11:25,044
Sammy?

1704
02:11:31,384 --> 02:11:32,843
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

1705
02:11:39,725 --> 02:11:41,727
Come here.

1706
02:11:49,819 --> 02:11:51,946
It's a panic attack.
Your mother gets them.

1707
02:11:52,029 --> 02:11:54,174
- What did you do when she'd get them?
- I made her tea.

1708
02:11:54,198 --> 02:11:55,199
Okay.

1709
02:12:01,747 --> 02:12:03,666
Plus, you're exhausted.

1710
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:05,751
You don't sleep.

1711
02:12:06,502 --> 02:12:10,089
I hear you walking around all
night or typing those letters,

1712
02:12:10,172 --> 02:12:13,092
and the three hours' drive to
the college every day and back.

1713
02:12:13,175 --> 02:12:14,815
No, no, no. I can't
go back to that dorm.

1714
02:12:14,885 --> 02:12:16,345
Maybe your roommate
settled down.

1715
02:12:16,929 --> 02:12:18,806
He voted for goldwater.
I can't go back.

1716
02:12:19,849 --> 02:12:20,850
Dad...

1717
02:12:24,437 --> 02:12:25,729
I don't know...

1718
02:12:26,730 --> 02:12:28,232
What to do anymore.

1719
02:12:29,733 --> 02:12:31,652
I don't want to disappoint you,

1720
02:12:31,735 --> 02:12:33,737
and I promised that
I'd stick it out.

1721
02:12:35,239 --> 02:12:37,867
But two years is like
forever, and I hate school.

1722
02:12:37,950 --> 02:12:40,077
Like, a lot.

1723
02:12:40,161 --> 02:12:44,707
And I wanna get work on
a movie or a TV show,

1724
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:48,586
so I send out all those letters,
but nobody ever writes back.

1725
02:12:48,669 --> 02:12:53,174
And my life is just going by so
fast, but it's not getting anywhere.

1726
02:12:55,843 --> 02:12:58,053
Concentrate on sipping.
It'll calm you down.

1727
02:13:03,851 --> 02:13:05,519
Here. Uh...

1728
02:13:09,023 --> 02:13:11,525
You can go through the mail
while I get the soup on.

1729
02:13:33,964 --> 02:13:35,341
It's from mom.

1730
02:13:36,967 --> 02:13:40,304
It's just a bunch of goofy photos
from some kind of block party.

1731
02:14:27,101 --> 02:14:28,102
Dad?

1732
02:14:30,938 --> 02:14:31,939
Dad, what's...

1733
02:14:42,700 --> 02:14:44,285
Dad, I didn't mean to...

1734
02:14:44,368 --> 02:14:46,704
If you hate school
so much, don't go.

1735
02:14:47,955 --> 02:14:48,956
But...

1736
02:14:49,790 --> 02:14:50,791
Dad, you...

1737
02:14:50,874 --> 02:14:53,752
I would like you to because
this film thing, I don't know...

1738
02:14:53,836 --> 02:14:57,548
Maybe I should have put my foot
down about it years ago, but...

1739
02:15:00,676 --> 02:15:05,264
I know you're gonna work like the
dickens on whatever you wind up doing

1740
02:15:05,347 --> 02:15:07,850
because you're a chip
off the old block.

1741
02:15:13,522 --> 02:15:16,275
We're never not going to
know each other, Sammy.

1742
02:15:20,154 --> 02:15:21,614
How do you know that?

1743
02:15:22,906 --> 02:15:24,408
You and mom don't anymore.

1744
02:15:24,491 --> 02:15:25,743
Yes, we do.

1745
02:15:27,536 --> 02:15:29,038
We always will.

1746
02:15:30,539 --> 02:15:32,750
I know it because...

1747
02:15:35,169 --> 02:15:40,007
We've gone too far in our story
to actually say, "the end."

1748
02:15:50,225 --> 02:15:52,394
Uh, you missed
something in the mail.

1749
02:16:19,254 --> 02:16:20,589
Good news?

1750
02:16:24,051 --> 02:16:26,053
The y 've ordered 32 half hours,

1751
02:16:26,136 --> 02:16:29,765
Fridays at 8:30 pm. On CBS
starting September 17th.

1752
02:16:29,848 --> 02:16:31,328
We already have six
shows in the can.

1753
02:16:31,392 --> 02:16:35,354
It's like stalag 77 or the great
escape, except it's funnier.

1754
02:16:35,437 --> 02:16:37,022
And it's for television.

1755
02:16:37,106 --> 02:16:38,524
- And it's funny.
- Yeah.

1756
02:16:38,607 --> 02:16:40,168
Or at least, I pray to
god that it's funny.

1757
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:42,778
Hogan's heroes, that's the
title. What do you think?

1758
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:45,698
- Pretty catchy, right?
- Catchy, yeah.

1759
02:16:45,781 --> 02:16:47,324
And if all goes well,

1760
02:16:47,408 --> 02:16:51,245
I might be able to offer
you something next season.

1761
02:16:53,122 --> 02:16:55,416
Maybe assisting an
assistant to an assistant.

1762
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:02,631
You don't wanna be in TV anyway.

1763
02:17:02,715 --> 02:17:05,175
Um, your letter said as much.

1764
02:17:06,135 --> 02:17:08,178
By the way, I love this letter.

1765
02:17:09,138 --> 02:17:11,932
I used to write a whole bunch of
these letters when I was your age.

1766
02:17:12,015 --> 02:17:14,184
You wanna make
movies. Am I right?

1767
02:17:14,268 --> 02:17:16,520
Well, yeah. Yes, I do.

1768
02:17:16,603 --> 02:17:20,065
But look, I'm just happy to start
anywhere, and... and that doesn't...

1769
02:17:20,691 --> 02:17:22,025
You know who you need to meet?

1770
02:17:22,109 --> 02:17:24,528
I mean, not for a job,
because he doesn't do that.

1771
02:17:25,487 --> 02:17:28,824
How would you like to meet the
greatest film director who ever lived?

1772
02:17:29,700 --> 02:17:31,994
And he's right across the hall.

1773
02:17:34,163 --> 02:17:35,414
Come on.

1774
02:17:40,878 --> 02:17:42,212
Wait here a minute.

1775
02:17:52,097 --> 02:17:55,684
Uh, this is nona. Nona's
gonna look after you.

1776
02:17:55,768 --> 02:17:57,436
Uh, he's not here. He's...

1777
02:17:57,519 --> 02:17:58,705
- He's at lunch.
- Right.

1778
02:17:58,729 --> 02:18:00,522
- You wanna wait?
- Yeah, he'll wait.

1779
02:18:00,606 --> 02:18:01,607
Sit.

1780
02:18:03,442 --> 02:18:04,610
Good luck.

1781
02:18:10,824 --> 02:18:12,159
Could be hours.

1782
02:19:41,081 --> 02:19:43,041
All right, kid. You
got five minutes.

1783
02:19:44,167 --> 02:19:46,044
Probably one. Stand up.

1784
02:19:50,132 --> 02:19:53,468
Uh, lose the tie. You'll
stand a better chance.

1785
02:21:03,705 --> 02:21:06,249
They tell me you wanna
be a picturemaker.

1786
02:21:07,876 --> 02:21:09,795
Um, yes, sir. I do.

1787
02:21:09,878 --> 02:21:11,254
Why?

1788
02:21:11,838 --> 02:21:14,800
This business,
it'll rip you apart.

1789
02:21:14,883 --> 02:21:17,135
Well...

1790
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:19,554
Mr. Ford, I...

1791
02:21:19,638 --> 02:21:21,431
So, what do you
know about art, kid?

1792
02:21:24,142 --> 02:21:25,727
I love your movies so much.

1793
02:21:25,811 --> 02:21:27,729
No, art.

1794
02:21:28,313 --> 02:21:30,148
See that painting over there?

1795
02:21:32,401 --> 02:21:34,361
Uh, yeah. I mean, yes.

1796
02:21:34,444 --> 02:21:35,696
Yes, I do see it.

1797
02:21:35,779 --> 02:21:37,531
Walk over to it.

1798
02:21:43,954 --> 02:21:46,581
Well, what's in it? Describe it.

1799
02:21:46,665 --> 02:21:48,417
Oh, okay. Um...

1800
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:50,419
So there are two guys,

1801
02:21:50,502 --> 02:21:52,713
and they're on horseback,

1802
02:21:52,796 --> 02:21:55,716
and they're looking for
something, so maybe they're...

1803
02:21:55,799 --> 02:21:58,135
No. No.

1804
02:21:58,218 --> 02:21:59,886
Where's the horizon?

1805
02:21:59,970 --> 02:22:01,471
The... the horizon?

1806
02:22:02,222 --> 02:22:03,223
Where is it?

1807
02:22:03,306 --> 02:22:04,516
Uh, it's at the bottom.

1808
02:22:04,599 --> 02:22:07,644
That's right. Walk
over to this painting.

1809
02:22:15,027 --> 02:22:16,194
Well?

1810
02:22:18,071 --> 02:22:20,073
Right, okay. So there are
five cowboys. You know...

1811
02:22:20,157 --> 02:22:22,200
No, no, no, no, no!

1812
02:22:22,284 --> 02:22:24,036
Where's the goddamn horizon?

1813
02:22:24,119 --> 02:22:25,996
Um, it's... it's there.

1814
02:22:26,079 --> 02:22:27,557
- Where?
- At the top of the painting.

1815
02:22:27,581 --> 02:22:29,082
All right, get over here.

1816
02:22:31,793 --> 02:22:34,004
Now, remember this.

1817
02:22:34,087 --> 02:22:37,674
When the horizon's at the
bottom, it's interesting.

1818
02:22:38,425 --> 02:22:42,095
When the horizon's at the
top, it's interesting.

1819
02:22:42,846 --> 02:22:46,683
When the horizon's in the
middle, it's boring as shit.

1820
02:22:47,893 --> 02:22:50,520
Now, good luck to you.

1821
02:22:51,646 --> 02:22:54,066
And get the fuck
out of my office!

1822
02:22:54,149 --> 02:22:55,150
Okay.

1823
02:23:00,197 --> 02:23:01,198
Thank you.

1824
02:23:02,282 --> 02:23:03,575
My pleasure.
