1
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:44,920
<i>All units, all units.
Code 3 pursuit of 2-11.</i>

2
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:47,592
<i>White SUV heading east
on Alameda service road.</i>

3
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:49,159
<i>Suspects: three Asian males.</i>

4
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:52,889
<i>Be advised. Shots fired, shots fired.</i>

5
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:46,280
<i>Cheryl, can you see how many
suspects are in this car?</i>

6
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:50,890
<i>As far as I can see at this point,
there are three sus...</i>

7
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:52,752
<i>Oh, this is just coming in.</i>

8
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:55,084
Hancock!

9
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:05,465
What, boy?

10
00:02:06,507 --> 00:02:07,804
Bad guys.

11
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:10,442
<i>- -Trying to cut them off.
You can see them there.</i>

12
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:12,771
<i>They have their hands
outside the white SUV...</i>

13
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,541
<i>shooting randomly on the freeway.</i>

14
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,751
What, you want a cookie?
Get out of my face.

15
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:21,912
Asshole.

16
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:24,921
- What?
- You heard me.

17
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,465
<i>Please, stay off the freeway.</i>

18
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:37,263
<i>I understand that there are
three suspects in the white SUV...</i>

19
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:39,064
Asshole.

20
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:12,366
Watch out!

21
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:14,805
Damn!

22
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:17,374
Damn it!

23
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:51,511
Hancock!?!

24
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:54,549
Beat it, 'Soulja Boy!'

25
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:56,746
<i>Hancock is in the car...</i>

26
00:03:56,952 --> 00:03:59,420
<i>and he appears to be
negotiating with the gunmen.</i>

27
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:01,950
He smells like a bar!

28
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:05,460
You pay for new roof!

29
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:09,460
Fellas, hey. I don't give a shit
what you did. I don't care.

30
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:13,361
Three guys in the car,
no girls, rave music.

31
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,036
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.

32
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:19,697
But if you don't pull over
and give yourselves up quietly...

33
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:24,312
I swear to Christ, your head
is going up the driver's ass.

34
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:27,914
His head is going up your ass.
And you drew the short stick...

35
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:30,551
because your head
is going up my ass.

36
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:33,682
Shoot this asshole!

37
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:39,794
Stop!

38
00:04:40,796 --> 00:04:42,093
What the F%Ø♪K?

39
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:58,474
<i>The department is on their way.
There's just chaos here on the 105.</i>

40
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,193
What? I'm not Japanese, man!

41
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,421
Put us down!

42
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:18,866
Oh, now you "speaky Engly, " huh?
"Speaky Engly" now?

43
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,548
You broke my glasses.

44
00:05:32,782 --> 00:05:34,977
I'm sorry! Take my Ray-Bans!

45
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:38,276
- Put us down!
- You want down?

46
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:39,887
- Yes, please! Please!
- Help me!

47
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,526
I'm real good at down.
I'm real good at down.

48
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:45,024
All right? All right.

49
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:54,628
<i>This, Hancock's latest act
of so-called heroics...</i>

50
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:56,863
<i>took a hefty financial toll.</i>

51
00:05:57,073 --> 00:06:01,305
<i>Initial damage estimates
are said to top $9 million...</i>

52
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:02,671
<i>which, if accurate...</i>

53
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,013
<i>represents a personal record...</i>

54
00:06:05,215 --> 00:06:08,378
<i>for the notoriously publicity-shy
Hancock...</i>

55
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:12,419
<i>who, as usual,
can't be reached for comment.</i>

56
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:17,423
<i>With all the cracks to the concrete,
all the bullets, water damage, fires...</i>

57
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,187
<i>L.A. would be better off
if this guy would leave...</i>

58
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:22,024
<i>and let us get on with our jobs.</i>

59
00:06:22,232 --> 00:06:25,327
<i>He has never asked me for a badge
and has never worked with us...</i>

60
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:27,504
<i>in any capacity whatsoever. Zero.</i>

61
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:29,673
<i>Just do it somewhere else.
New York, maybe.</i>

62
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:32,900
<i>Let them suffer for a while.
What the hell's the crane doing there?</i>

63
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:35,712
<i>Move the...
The crane's not gonna help!</i>

64
00:06:36,347 --> 00:06:38,042
<i>How are we supposed to get down?</i>

65
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,548
I will break my foot off in your ass,
woman.

66
00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:44,946
<i>This Hancock guy is surely
on some kind of mission.</i>

67
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:50,458
<i>And he's using our city to beat himself
up for reasons known only to him.</i>

68
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,561
<i>We'll have shots later
from Chopper 1...</i>

69
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:55,698
<i>for the removal of the SUV
from the landmark needle.</i>

70
00:06:59,737 --> 00:07:01,432
Sir? Ray Embrey.

71
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,936
- Ray.
- Pleasure.

72
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:06,535
- So...
- Ray's like the Bono of P.R.

73
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:10,805
Well, actually I think Bono
is the Bono of P.R., but I do try.

74
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,642
Well, let's see it.

75
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:16,250
Okay. I'll get right into it.
Good morning, everyone.

76
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:19,946
I'm here to talk to you
about charitable giving.

77
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:22,324
Okay? And we all know
the way that works.

78
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:25,290
You give one, maybe two percent
of your net cash...

79
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:29,557
and you get an armband, or a ribbon
or whatever. It's nowhere near enough.

80
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:34,567
And that's why we at Embrey Publicity
would like to offer you...

81
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,739
the All Heart symbol.

82
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:42,503
Now, you would be among a very
select group of corporate giants...

83
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:46,074
to bear this logo on your product.

84
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:48,253
And what this would say
to the public...

85
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:50,318
is that your company,
Pharmatopsis...

86
00:07:50,522 --> 00:07:54,856
has made a radical contribution
to helping our world.

87
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,960
Here's all you need to do to qualify.

88
00:07:57,663 --> 00:08:01,030
Your new TB drug, Mycodin?

89
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:04,327
We would like for you to give
that product away for free.

90
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:09,600
- Did you say "free"?
- I did.

91
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:13,638
Only to those who need it.

92
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:17,212
Only to those who without it
would otherwise die.

93
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:21,350
As a concept, free is kind of up there
with, you know, lethal side effects.

94
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:24,021
- Mandatory product recall.
- Get indicted, go to jail.

95
00:08:24,222 --> 00:08:27,055
Get out, work at IHOP
for the rest of your career.

96
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:29,659
Understandable reaction.
It's a radical concept.

97
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:34,161
But it is the brand that represents
a fairer and better world.

98
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:35,628
The brand...

99
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:39,394
that everyone is talking about.

100
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:41,504
Who is "everyone"?

101
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:44,301
We do already have
a sports franchise.

102
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:47,501
- NFL? NBA? MLB?
- Soccer.

103
00:08:47,713 --> 00:08:50,079
MLS? Which team?

104
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:53,308
Well, it's a local team.
Encino Hurricanes.

105
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,948
It's my son's team.

106
00:08:56,488 --> 00:09:00,186
Anyway, we can save the world.

107
00:09:00,393 --> 00:09:03,692
All right?
Someone's just gotta go first.

108
00:09:04,297 --> 00:09:06,322
What do you say?

109
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:10,534
Are you a crackpot?

110
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:22,203
Hey, hon. You're probably at the store.
I am on my way.

111
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:25,714
I think I made a connection.

112
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:28,077
Not really.

113
00:09:28,287 --> 00:09:30,721
Listen, tell Aaron that I'm coming
and I... Damn it.

114
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:33,118
And I want some meatballs, okay?

115
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:37,023
I need some Spaghetti Madness.
I'll see you in about 20 minutes.

116
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,722
Hey! What is it, National Horn Day?

117
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,432
Idiot.

118
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,864
Hey.

119
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:50,769
Hey. Hey!

120
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:53,102
Move it. There's a train coming.

121
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:55,542
Do you not hear that horn?

122
00:09:55,782 --> 00:09:58,216
Let's go! I got a train!

123
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:00,147
Move it!

124
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:03,614
- Back your car up! There's a train!
- I can't go anywhere. Get out!

125
00:10:03,823 --> 00:10:05,290
Son of a bitch!

126
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:09,388
Fix the handle, Ray. Fix the handle.

127
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,526
Get out!

128
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:24,300
Get off the track! Move!

129
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:35,318
- Let's get him out.
- Get him out of there.

130
00:10:35,522 --> 00:10:37,683
- Somebody help him.
- You all right?

131
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:40,587
Please, that guy's still in there.

132
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:43,254
You sure?

133
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:46,091
Get him out of there!

134
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:54,173
Will you look at that?

135
00:11:15,562 --> 00:11:19,862
- Ah, shit.
- I'm all right. I'm okay.

136
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,329
All of you people...

137
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:24,694
blocking the intersection...

138
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:26,505
you're all idiots.

139
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:29,801
You threw the dude's car at her.
And what's with the train?

140
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,343
Why didn't you just go straight up
in the air with the car?

141
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:36,249
You've obviously injured
that poor woman.

142
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:40,478
- She's right. She should sue you.
- Yeah, she should sue you.

143
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:43,521
Well, you should sue McDonald's
because they fucked you up.

144
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:46,057
You're an asshole.

145
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:48,559
And I can smell
that liquor on your breath.

146
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:51,890
- Because I've been drinking, bitch.
- You're a drunk asshole!

147
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,900
- You think you're such a hero.
- Asshole!

148
00:11:56,871 --> 00:12:00,204
- You're nothing but an asshole.
- We don't need you in this city.

149
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:05,206
Some superhero you are! Fly off!

150
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:07,674
Shut up!

151
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:09,406
Don't you understand? I'm alive.

152
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:13,246
I get to go home and see my family.
I should be dead right now, right here.

153
00:12:13,454 --> 00:12:16,389
Yeah, he could've gone straight up.
Obviously, you should've.

154
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:20,459
You know, and I was upside down
for the train, but...

155
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:23,862
No. Thank you.

156
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:27,090
Thank you very much, Hancock.
Thank you.

157
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:29,532
Thank you, Hancock.

158
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:36,272
You're not flying by the Valley,
are you?

159
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:42,480
Throw the ball!

160
00:12:43,585 --> 00:12:46,554
Monte, one guy'll line up here,
all right? Hike the ball.

161
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:48,881
This guy'll be right here
and he says, "Hut!"

162
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,719
This guy'll drop back. Hut!
Drop back. Chuck it.

163
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:56,495
Great. Thank you.

164
00:12:56,865 --> 00:12:59,231
Nice aim. The driveway
would've been better, but...

165
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:01,232
- What's going on, Dad?
- Hey, buddy.

166
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:03,997
Daddy's had a little bit of a day.
Look at you, huh?

167
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,501
I want you to meet somebody.

168
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:09,074
This guy here, dragging
Daddy's car into the driveway.

169
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:11,678
- Who's this?
- Hancock.

170
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,110
That's right. Hancock,
this is my boy, Aaron.

171
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,944
- Ray, what happened to the car?
- Oh, boy.

172
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:18,809
You would not have believed it.

173
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:22,985
I came this close to getting hit
by a train. If it wasn't for that guy...

174
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:26,355
He saved my life. I mean...
Hancock, this is my wife, Mary.

175
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:28,291
Believe that? I almost kissed a train.

176
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:30,624
Saw my whole life
flash before my eyes.

177
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,324
- He saved your life?
- He sure did. Thank you.

178
00:13:33,535 --> 00:13:35,162
- Hey, you good?
- I am good, yeah.

179
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:39,671
- All right. Keep it off the tracks.
- I will, definitely.

180
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,437
Hang on a... One second.

181
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:49,015
- Hancock, you eat, yes? Human food?
- Yeah.

182
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:50,515
- You like meatballs?
- No.

183
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,710
Aaron, sweetheart,
he has to go and do...

184
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:53,921
I love meatballs.

185
00:13:54,123 --> 00:13:55,954
Who's so busy
they can't have a meal?

186
00:13:56,158 --> 00:13:57,625
And it's on us. Please.

187
00:13:57,826 --> 00:14:01,262
I'm not even gonna take no
for an answer. Get inside the house.

188
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:28,991
Why do you have an eagle
on your hat?

189
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,891
Do you like eagles?

190
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:34,255
This guy's like a little
talking machine, huh?

191
00:14:34,464 --> 00:14:36,398
We don't have a lot of guests
over here.

192
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:39,033
Look at that, huh?
Hon, is the heat on?

193
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:42,071
No? All right.

194
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:46,175
We started Spaghetti Madness
about two years ago.

195
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:50,039
We do it every Thursday, and we
have not missed a Thursday in...

196
00:14:50,246 --> 00:14:51,440
- Ever.
- Yeah.

197
00:14:51,648 --> 00:14:53,878
- Ever? That's a long time.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:14:54,084 --> 00:14:57,053
- A very long time.
- That's some good meatballs, boy.

199
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,546
Aaron.

200
00:14:58,755 --> 00:15:00,620
- Your mama's calling you.
- Yes, Mom?

201
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:03,121
No. His name is Aaron.

202
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:06,419
- Hey, Aaron, how was school today?
- Fine.

203
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:09,291
Yeah? No more problems
with that bully, Michael?

204
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:12,798
- Michel. But not like a girl's name.
- Michel. No, no, I know.

205
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:15,527
- It's French.
- Yeah. Michel, Hancock, is this...

206
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:19,073
Hancock? Michel
is this neighborhood bully.

207
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:21,402
We've been trying to teach Aaron
a little...

208
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:24,273
about conflict resolution.
You know what I mean?

209
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:28,144
- Yeah. Turn the other cheek, all that?
- That's exactly right.

210
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:31,717
Well, just never turn that one,
all right?

211
00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:33,253
Never let them punk you.

212
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:35,049
- Got it, Mr. Hancock.
- Aaron, eat.

213
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:38,725
The way you deal with bullies,
you take your right foot...

214
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:41,796
bring it right up and catch him
in his little piss pump.

215
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:44,331
You don't have to do that,
honey, okay? Seriously.

216
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:45,559
It's a good idea.

217
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,603
You aim straight and make sure
he can't use that thing...

218
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:51,900
for nothing but a flap to keep
the dust out of his butt crack.

219
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:53,508
Okay, please, just stop.

220
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:55,440
Michel is not a man, okay?

221
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:57,409
He's a little boy. And his parents...

222
00:15:57,615 --> 00:16:01,107
happen to be going through a bad
divorce. That's why he's acting up.

223
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:02,615
Maybe you don't know this...

224
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,914
but not everything in this world
gets resolved with force.

225
00:16:06,123 --> 00:16:08,114
- Not everything has to be bang...
- I'm set.

226
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:13,126
- Scream, blood, more blood.
- Baby, I got plenty. Angel! We're okay.

227
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,695
She watches so much news...

228
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,457
that sometimes
it gets to be a little too much.

229
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:21,100
- You got a toilet?
- Yep. Yeah, just past the fridge.

230
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:26,206
Are...?

231
00:16:28,345 --> 00:16:32,281
Did he just take the whiskey bottle
to the bathroom?

232
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:33,950
Do you want him to kill us all?

233
00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:36,114
Thanks for coming on in.
Good, right?

234
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,447
- Very, yeah.
- Wanna say goodbye to him?

235
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:40,920
- Bye, Hancock.
- Hey, all right, little buddy.

236
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:45,194
- Are you okay?
- It was a joke.

237
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:47,887
- Come on, Aaron.
- Hey, sorry. I was just trying to...

238
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:49,498
He got it. She didn't get it.

239
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:52,067
I owe you.
You gave me my life back today.

240
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,295
Hear me out.
I'd like to return the favor.

241
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:57,168
Do you know what I do?
I'm in public relations.

242
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,970
You know what that is? Of course
you do. We're image consultants.

243
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:04,512
We change the way people see
products, companies, people, that stuff.

244
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:07,685
Listen, I see you on the news
and I see you out there today...

245
00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:11,344
and it can't feel good that people,
you know, hate you.

246
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:13,581
- It's good to meet you, Ray.
- No, I'm sorry.

247
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:14,986
But hear me out.

248
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:18,822
People... Don't get me wrong, they
should love you. They really should.

249
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,828
I wanna deliver that for you.
It's the least that I can do.

250
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:23,398
You know, you're a superhero.

251
00:17:23,602 --> 00:17:25,593
Kids should ask you
for your autograph.

252
00:17:25,804 --> 00:17:27,601
People should cheer you
on the streets.

253
00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:29,671
What the hell are you pricks
looking at?

254
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,672
No, no, they're not... It's all right.

255
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:33,777
They're not pricks, they're just people.

256
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:37,448
But I want you to give me
one short pitch, you know?

257
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:40,277
That's all I ask. Okay?

258
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,281
You use...

259
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:44,521
Put it under here?

260
00:17:45,223 --> 00:17:47,054
Put it right there. Perfect.

261
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:50,092
E-mail me or whatever.
You just fly on over, I don't know.

262
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:51,694
I want you to think about it.

263
00:17:51,897 --> 00:17:54,388
Just be careful when you go.
Sleep on it, all right?

264
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,692
You get back to me?

265
00:17:57,068 --> 00:17:58,763
I'll be right here. All right.

266
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,407
Please don't stare, you guys.
He's kind of one of us.

267
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:10,442
What about All Heart?

268
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,915
It's a nonstarter, babe, you know?
I'm chasing windmills with that.

269
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,248
Maybe I can't change the world
but I can change this guy's life.

270
00:18:17,456 --> 00:18:21,085
- Think about all the good he can do.
- I think you're wasting your time.

271
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:22,985
You really hate him.

272
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:26,323
Hate? I don't hate him, Ray.
I don't even know the guy.

273
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:30,501
Just look at the news.
You can see what he does.

274
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:34,264
I think he just needs
people to care, you know?

275
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:37,976
You see the good in everybody, Ray.

276
00:18:38,177 --> 00:18:41,146
Even sometimes when it's not there.

277
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:46,415
I have a feeling about this.
Don't work with this guy.

278
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:51,985
I know this kind of guy.
He breaks things.

279
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:54,071
My bad. Everybody all right?

280
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:56,876
I'll go and get my mommy.

281
00:20:57,085 --> 00:20:59,417
He is an asshole.

282
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:08,920
- What's your name, boy?
- Michel.

283
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:12,589
Do you know Aaron?

284
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:21,231
Well, seems to be a pretty good kid.

285
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:23,774
Just wanna ask you
to lay off of him a little bit.

286
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,639
Why, asshole?

287
00:21:29,016 --> 00:21:31,507
- You're gonna stop calling me that.
- Asshole.

288
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:35,713
- That's not my name.
- Asshole.

289
00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:42,192
Call me a asshole...

290
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:43,727
one more time.

291
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:49,465
Asshole.

292
00:21:52,473 --> 00:21:54,600
How about you, thickness?

293
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:56,267
Goggles?

294
00:21:56,878 --> 00:22:00,370
Hancock! You son of a gun,
I knew you'd come.

295
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:01,946
Ask Mary. I had a feeling.

296
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,381
I said, he heard me
and he's ready for a change.

297
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:07,282
This is great. Did you do this?
You come in a little hot?

298
00:22:07,489 --> 00:22:08,956
I'll meet you in the house.

299
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:12,150
- I know you don't drive, but...
- Oh, damn it, Ray.

300
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:17,829
All right. You're all right.
You're all right. You're all right.

301
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:22,996
Oh, stop crying, punk-ass. Go ahead.

302
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:26,971
- Not okay. Okay?
- He all right.

303
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:30,378
Really not okay. This is some
of the stuff we're gonna work on.

304
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:33,639
How do you think that conversation's
gonna go down with his mom?

305
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:36,579
Landing like that in the street's
also on the uncool side.

306
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:40,015
No, that was already like that
when I got here, Ray.

307
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:42,348
I live here.
I know what the street's like.

308
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:44,388
We'll make those problems
of the past.

309
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:47,084
I'm gonna teach you
how to interface with the public.

310
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:50,423
- Where's the wife?
- Mary took Aaron to his soccer game.

311
00:22:50,632 --> 00:22:52,566
Hancock, pulled some stuff up
on YouTube.

312
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:57,034
Surprisingly large amount of not-great
stuff on you that's gonna be helpful.

313
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:58,501
What is this?

314
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:01,403
That's me trying to change the world.

315
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,510
Unfortunately, not doing real well.

316
00:23:03,745 --> 00:23:05,610
Come on. Let's get to you.

317
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:08,243
This stuff was on YouTube.

318
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,749
Everybody loves a Nutty Buddy,
I get it, but this doesn't work, sir.

319
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:12,621
<i>Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy.
Back up, back up.</i>

320
00:23:12,622 --> 00:23:15,715
<i>Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy.
Back up, back up.</i>

321
00:23:16,658 --> 00:23:20,253
<i>Mom! Mom! Mom!</i>

322
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:22,220
Those are children.

323
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:27,330
<i>- We've been waiting a long time...
- Get that camera out of my face.</i>

324
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:30,868
You ever put out
an apartment fire, Ray?

325
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:34,599
- No, I haven't done that. I'm in P.R.
- No. My ass was hot.

326
00:23:36,145 --> 00:23:39,046
All right. How about this?
This is Walter, the gray whale.

327
00:23:39,249 --> 00:23:41,979
Everybody remembers him
stuck on the beach north of Zuma.

328
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:43,209
Along comes Hancock.

329
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:47,585
<i>Hancock!</i>

330
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:59,658
- I don't even remember that.
- Yeah.

331
00:23:59,902 --> 00:24:02,962
Greenpeace does. Walter does.

332
00:24:03,773 --> 00:24:05,468
This gets redundant after a while...

333
00:24:05,675 --> 00:24:08,769
but my basic diagnosis
of your fundamental problem is...

334
00:24:08,978 --> 00:24:10,605
- Do you wanna hear it?
- No.

335
00:24:11,047 --> 00:24:12,105
You're an asshole.

336
00:24:12,715 --> 00:24:14,580
I know. I call it like I see it though.

337
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:17,753
It's not a crime to be an asshole
but it's counterproductive.

338
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:19,922
But you are an asshole,
don't you think?

339
00:24:20,123 --> 00:24:21,750
Be careful.

340
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:25,155
All right, how about this?
I've been thinking about something.

341
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:27,955
This kind of goes to
how you present yourself.

342
00:24:28,164 --> 00:24:31,429
Come on. Really? It's the middle
of the day. What springs to mind...

343
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:34,034
when you see this?

344
00:24:35,938 --> 00:24:36,962
Homo.

345
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,801
- What about that?
- Homo in red.

346
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:46,278
- Norwegian homo.
- I'll give you that.

347
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:49,782
Let's move past the comics. Let's
get into something a little deeper.

348
00:24:49,987 --> 00:24:55,152
I think that deep down you behave
badly because you're lonely.

349
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,226
I think deep down,
you want people's acceptance.

350
00:24:59,697 --> 00:25:01,961
Come on, now.
You save people's lives...

351
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:05,192
and they reject you,
and so you reject them back.

352
00:25:05,402 --> 00:25:08,200
And it's a...
And we're gonna switch that cycle.

353
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:10,168
We're gonna start fresh, start anew.

354
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:14,242
This is outstanding. If you turn
some of this power into willpower...

355
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:16,671
- Almost.
- And then he kicked it in.

356
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,814
Hey, Hancock! We almost won.

357
00:25:19,016 --> 00:25:22,247
Yeah, we did. Okay, upstairs.
I'm making lunch. Go change.

358
00:25:22,486 --> 00:25:23,851
Hey, sweetheart.

359
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:26,813
Have you been watching the news?

360
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:29,754
- No, we've been working on...
- Interfacing with the public.

361
00:25:29,993 --> 00:25:32,086
- This has been on all day.
- That's very good.

362
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:35,697
<i>The law is the law, Mr. Hancock,
and you are not above it.</i>

363
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:39,161
<i>Felony destruction of property...</i>

364
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,101
<i>amounting to tens of millions
of dollars, theft, and now this.</i>

365
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:47,744
<i>From where I sit,
I see a selfish, self-absorbed man...</i>

366
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:52,245
<i>with a lot of muscle, but no regard
for anyone but yourself.</i>

367
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:54,747
<i>Mr. Hancock, let me remind you.</i>

368
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:57,717
<i>You are not above the law.</i>

369
00:25:57,922 --> 00:26:02,791
<i>You have failed to show
at over 600 subpoenas in civil suits.</i>

370
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:06,622
<i>Anybody else would be held
in contempt. But, oh, no. Not you.</i>

371
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,924
<i>You may be a superhero,
but let me tell you this:</i>

372
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,969
<i>You're not nearly as strong
as the U.S. Constitution.</i>

373
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,639
<i>Bank on it, buddy.</i>

374
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,536
<i>We do not condone the t...</i>

375
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,743
Genius.

376
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:23,470
Things just got real.
This is exactly what we need.

377
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:26,650
There's a DA trying to figure out
how to put you in jail.

378
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,445
- Bitch can try.
- I say you go.

379
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,592
People take you for granted.
Make people miss you.

380
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,922
- People don't like you, Hancock.
- I do.

381
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,122
Two weeks, you know?
The public will be clamoring for you.

382
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,994
When they do, we'll be ready.

383
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:47,831
Worst-case scenario is I'm wrong and
you just, you know, fly out of there.

384
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,265
What do you got to lose?

385
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,757
"I apologize to the people
of Los Angeles.

386
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:15,455
My behavior has been improper
and I accept the consequences.

387
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,300
<i>I ask my fellow Angelenos...</i>

388
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,438
<i>for their patience
and understanding. "</i>

389
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,130
You're an asshole, Hancock!

390
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,366
Asshole!

391
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,645
"Life here can be difficult for me.

392
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,942
After all, I'm the only one of my kind.

393
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:36,153
<i>During my incarceration,
I will be participating...</i>

394
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,585
<i>in alcohol-
and anger-management treatment. "</i>

395
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:46,690
You're a drunk bum!

396
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:49,993
"You deserve better from me.
I can be better. I will be better."

397
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:52,033
All right.

398
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,207
Give me the hand, playboy.

399
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,158
I see you, punk!

400
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:43,585
Oh, I get it.

401
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,191
I put some... Most of you in here.

402
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:49,362
Yes, you did.

403
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,196
I can understand you feeling
some kind of way about that.

404
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,870
What?

405
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:03,208
So I'm gonna do me,
and I'm gonna let you do you.

406
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,538
I don't want no trouble.

407
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:08,041
All right?

408
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:10,216
I just wanna go to my cell.

409
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,215
- That ain't gonna happen.
- Nope.

410
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,688
Excuse me.

411
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:20,454
Excuse me, please.

412
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,898
Deadly.

413
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:30,293
If you don't move,
your head is going up his ass.

414
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:40,336
Y'all fellas sure you wanna
ride this train?

415
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,280
Choo, choo, asshole.

416
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,832
Get him out! Get him out!

417
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:11,372
Did you shove a man's head
up another man's ass?

418
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:20,650
We're gonna...
We're gonna circle back to that.

419
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:24,183
The DA's office wants your sentence
to run eight years.

420
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:27,486
It's a big number,
but not something we didn't anticipate.

421
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:29,720
You know, our plan is...
What are you doing?

422
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,990
Hey, hey, hey!

423
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:42,537
It sounded like you said they want me
to spend eight years in this shithole.

424
00:30:42,743 --> 00:30:45,371
Eight is more like four and a half
with good behavior.

425
00:30:45,746 --> 00:30:49,682
But it's irrelevant because
with you out of the picture...

426
00:30:49,884 --> 00:30:52,478
and with the crime rate
going up through the roof...

427
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:56,589
the DA and the cops, they're all
gonna call for your immediate release.

428
00:30:56,824 --> 00:30:59,384
They're gonna demand it.
Where are you going? Sit down.

429
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:02,187
Hey. Hey. Stop right there.

430
00:31:02,396 --> 00:31:03,556
- Stop it. Hancock.
- Move.

431
00:31:03,764 --> 00:31:05,254
- Hancock!
- Get back!

432
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:06,990
You're being a coward!

433
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:09,735
- Who you talking to?
- I'm talking to you.

434
00:31:09,937 --> 00:31:13,806
- Who are you talking to, Ray?
- Stop pretending that you do not care.

435
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:16,401
You have a calling.
You're a hero, Hancock.

436
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:20,411
You're gonna be miserable the rest
of your life until you accept that.

437
00:31:20,615 --> 00:31:24,915
Trust me. Trust this plan,
this process. Just stay in here.

438
00:31:25,454 --> 00:31:28,890
When they call, a hero's
what we're gonna give them.

439
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:32,753
How we gonna do that, Ray?

440
00:31:34,863 --> 00:31:36,922
All right, guys, let's start sharing.

441
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:39,032
- Don? You had something?
- Yeah.

442
00:31:39,968 --> 00:31:44,337
Yeah, I think I might've had
a little bit of a breakthrough.

443
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:46,129
Good for you.

444
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:51,107
Yeah, I mean, I realized
that breaking necks is... It's easy.

445
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:56,715
But I'm sitting there and I'm
staring at myself in the mirror...

446
00:31:56,918 --> 00:32:00,718
- and I thought, "This is tough."
- Yeah, it sounds tough.

447
00:32:01,957 --> 00:32:03,083
Why do you always laugh?

448
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:06,658
Picturing you looking at the mirror.
It would scare the shit out of me.

449
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:10,661
Every time I'm talking,
he completely ruins the cycle.

450
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:12,332
Now, let's watch the crosstalk.

451
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:14,968
I'm not gonna share anymore
if he keeps doing that.

452
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,398
No, no, no.

453
00:32:16,605 --> 00:32:18,630
- Keep sharing.
- Let's move on.

454
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,671
Mr. Hancock,
do you wanna share today?

455
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:23,869
Pass.

456
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:27,637
Your landing is your first impression.
It's your superhero handshake.

457
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:31,145
Don't come in too hot, okay?
Don't come in too boozy.

458
00:32:31,354 --> 00:32:33,754
And don't land on
a $100,000 Mercedes. All right?

459
00:32:33,956 --> 00:32:36,652
People have to be happy
that you've arrived.

460
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:38,789
Mr. Hancock, your share.

461
00:32:39,729 --> 00:32:40,957
Pass.

462
00:32:41,164 --> 00:32:43,860
So you've used the door
and the building's still intact.

463
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:46,534
People are happy that you've arrived.
They feel safe.

464
00:32:46,736 --> 00:32:48,966
There's an officer
and he's done a good job...

465
00:32:49,172 --> 00:32:50,867
so tell him he's done a good job.

466
00:32:51,073 --> 00:32:53,974
What the hell did I have to come for
if he's done a good job?

467
00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:06,013
Oh, man!

468

<i>KBLA radio, AM 850.</i>

469
00:33:10,393 --> 00:33:13,851
<i>Today's big story, no surprise here:
Hancock. What's your take?</i>

470
00:33:14,063 --> 00:33:15,894
<i>I, for one, have
had enough of this guy.</i>

471
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:19,795
<i>I'm glad he's doing time around bars
and I hope they don't let him off easy.</i>

"I see you don't wear
a bulletproof vest, security officer.

474
00:33:24,507 --> 00:33:25,667
I respect your courage...

475
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:29,311
because bullets don't bounce
off you, they bounce off me."

476

<i>This city is being run by gangs
and drug dealers.</i>

477

<i>Hancock makes them
shake in their boots.</i>

478
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:42,752
<i>He doesn't tie a pretty ribbon around it,
but he gets the job done.</i>

479
00:33:42,992 --> 00:33:44,152
<i>Besides, he's hot.</i>

480
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,559
Let me hear you say it.
Let me hear you say, "Good job."

G...

482
00:33:51,368 --> 00:33:52,528
Goo...

483
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:55,397
Mr. Hancock,
would you like to share?

484
00:33:55,606 --> 00:34:00,873
- Pass.
- Good.

485
00:34:01,144 --> 00:34:02,702
Good.

486
00:34:02,913 --> 00:34:06,440
Good j...

487
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,947
Good j...

488
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:12,110
Good job.

489
00:34:12,322 --> 00:34:13,880
Good job.

<i>Jail watch, day five, and true to his
word, Hancock remains incarcerated.</i>

491
00:34:18,462 --> 00:34:20,453
<i>Meanwhile, crime is still on the rise.</i>

492
00:34:20,664 --> 00:34:24,122

- Hancock! Hey, Hancock!
- Hey, little buddy.

495
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:39,046
- Hancock. We brought you something!
- Hey, hey.

496
00:34:39,783 --> 00:34:42,115
Hey, what's up, Hancock?

497
00:34:42,486 --> 00:34:43,919
Where's...? Where's Ray?

498
00:34:44,354 --> 00:34:46,584
No, it's just us. Ray's working.

499
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,758
Aaron really wanted
to come and see you...

500
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:52,122
so we just dropped by
with some Spaghetti Madness.

501
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:54,729
I should probably let the guard
check for keys...

502
00:34:54,965 --> 00:34:58,833
- No, no. Here.
- Okay. Here you go.

503
00:34:59,603 --> 00:35:02,231
Oh, you brought me meatballs, huh?

504
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:07,104
- Just dig in.
- Oh, man, look at that. Look at that.

505
00:35:11,282 --> 00:35:14,683
- That's a good meatball.
- Thanks, Hancock.

506
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:21,156
Ray is a good man.

507
00:35:30,368 --> 00:35:32,700
Whatever this is you're doing,
don't let him down.

508
00:35:33,871 --> 00:35:35,702
Okay?

509
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:40,442
Okay. Well, we should
probably go, buddy.

510
00:35:40,645 --> 00:35:43,546
- Already? I wanna stay with Hancock.
- Yeah. Sweetheart...

511
00:35:43,748 --> 00:35:46,546
we have to go.
Come on, say goodbye to Hancock.

512
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:49,948
Here, Hancock. It's my favorite one,
and I want you to have it.

513
00:35:50,254 --> 00:35:52,313
- That was very sweet.
- Thanks, Mom.

514
00:35:52,523 --> 00:35:54,081
Come here.

515
00:36:12,043 --> 00:36:14,739
Mr. Hancock,
would you like to share?

516
00:36:14,946 --> 00:36:16,538
Pass.

517
00:36:16,748 --> 00:36:18,978
All right. Phillip?

518
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:22,880
I love you guys, man.

519
00:36:23,087 --> 00:36:25,818
- We love you.
- We love you too, Phillip.

520
00:37:15,074 --> 00:37:16,166
For when they call.

521
00:37:22,314 --> 00:37:24,441
- I ain't wearing that, Ray.
- Yes, you are.

522
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,311
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- No, you are.

523
00:37:26,518 --> 00:37:27,712
Actually, I'm not, Ray.

524
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,649
You think you're not, but you are.

525
00:37:29,855 --> 00:37:34,724
I will fight crime butt-ass naked
before I fight it in that, Ray.

526
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:38,627
You know, you have fought naked.
We've got that. That's on YouTube.

527
00:37:38,831 --> 00:37:42,427
Hancock, this is a uniform.
A uniform represents purpose.

528
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,263
Doctors, policemen, firemen, right?

529
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,963
- It represents a calling.
- It's been two weeks.

530
00:37:48,174 --> 00:37:51,575
- Yeah?
- Nobody out there is missing me, Ray.

531
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:55,109
Just be patient.
You gotta trust me on this. All right?

532
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:24,532
Perimeter breach, perimeter breach.

533
00:38:26,379 --> 00:38:27,471
Asshole!

534
00:38:31,584 --> 00:38:33,779
You're still a fake-ass punk.

535
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:50,128
Damn!

536
00:38:50,336 --> 00:38:51,360
<i>Mr. Hancock?</i>

537
00:38:52,438 --> 00:38:54,463
It's your share.

538
00:38:56,075 --> 00:38:57,975
Pass.

539
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,642
- Come on, man, try it. Let it out.
- Come on, John.

540
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:05,079
I don't have nothing.

541
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:07,810
There's nothing on your mind?
Come on, John.

542
00:39:08,022 --> 00:39:09,250
- It's cool, man.
- Come on.

543
00:39:09,456 --> 00:39:10,684
- Come on.
- Do it.

544
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:12,188
First time for everything.

545
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:15,556
- Feels good to release, now.
- Let it heal. Come on, man, try it.

546
00:39:15,763 --> 00:39:19,199
Come in here all these days,
you don't have anything to share?

547
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:25,737
I'm Hancock, and I drink and stuff.

548
00:39:28,842 --> 00:39:30,241
All right. Thanks for sharing.

549
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:33,236
- Okay.
- Thank you.

550
00:39:33,547 --> 00:39:35,037
- All right.
- That's awesome.

551
00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:38,241
- That's a clap. Yeah.
- There you go. Good share.

552
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:56,065
Hey, Hancock.

553
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,135
Come on, get up.

554
00:39:58,372 --> 00:40:01,364
- You got a phone call.
- Take a message.

555
00:40:01,575 --> 00:40:03,736
It's the chief of police.

556
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:06,344
He says he needs your help.

557
00:40:31,673 --> 00:40:35,131
The trapped officer's husband
is Corporal Joseph Blake...

558
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:37,140
who was killed last year in Iraq...

559
00:40:37,345 --> 00:40:40,781
<i>leaving her two small children.
We are waiting for the latest news...</i>

560
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:43,507
<i>but apparently
there are three suspects and...</i>

561
00:40:43,718 --> 00:40:44,946
What's going on?

562
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:47,947
I'm out!

563
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:51,251
Stay down! Stay down!

564
00:40:51,459 --> 00:40:53,120
Stay down!

565
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:54,852
- Get out!
- Get down!

566
00:40:55,063 --> 00:40:56,189
Get it down!

567
00:41:01,636 --> 00:41:04,332
Let's go! Everybody's gotta get back!
Let's go!

568
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:06,803
Back! Move!

569
00:41:19,654 --> 00:41:23,181
We got perimeters set up
on the north, east and south sides.

570
00:41:23,391 --> 00:41:25,188
The west side is open.

571
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:36,428
Don't break the building,
don't break the building.

572
00:41:44,613 --> 00:41:46,240
What?

573
00:41:50,753 --> 00:41:52,380
It's a little tight. What you got?

574
00:41:52,588 --> 00:41:56,547
Bank job. I got at least eight hostages.
Four bad guys.

575
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:58,886
Officer pinned down.
We can't get to her.

576
00:41:59,095 --> 00:42:03,031
They been spraying
the hell out of us all morning. And...

577
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:06,599
They got some kind of heavy artillery.
Fifty caliber or bigger.

578
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:10,465
- I don't know if that matters to you.
- No, I'm good.

579
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:18,274
Good job.

580
00:42:20,649 --> 00:42:21,707
Good job.

581
00:42:22,051 --> 00:42:24,019
Really, good job.

582
00:42:31,894 --> 00:42:32,986
Get down!

583
00:43:02,692 --> 00:43:04,455
It's Hancock!

584
00:43:12,002 --> 00:43:13,094
Take him out!

585
00:43:17,707 --> 00:43:19,470
Good job!

586
00:43:19,676 --> 00:43:21,803
Do I have permission
to touch your body?

587
00:43:22,012 --> 00:43:23,536
Yes!

588
00:43:24,948 --> 00:43:27,075
It's not sexual.

589
00:43:28,618 --> 00:43:30,779
Not that you're not
an attractive woman.

590
00:43:30,987 --> 00:43:34,081
- You're a very attractive woman...
- Get me the hell out of here!

591
00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:41,190
He's on the move!

592
00:43:55,479 --> 00:43:57,504
He's moving, he's moving!

593
00:44:07,324 --> 00:44:08,348
Good job.

594
00:44:08,558 --> 00:44:09,991
- Are you hit anywhere?
- My leg!

595
00:44:10,193 --> 00:44:11,683
- Hancock!
- Good job.

596
00:44:11,895 --> 00:44:14,228
You said that.
I need you to end this now.

597
00:44:22,874 --> 00:44:24,466
Check the flanks.

598
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:27,903
Secure the perimeter.

599
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:33,373
Spread out!

600
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:35,609
They're gonna
come around the back.

601
00:44:48,766 --> 00:44:49,766
What happened to him?

602
00:44:51,669 --> 00:44:54,661
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

603
00:45:00,478 --> 00:45:03,345
What is happening?

604
00:45:18,062 --> 00:45:20,860
- I heard you was in the slammer.
- Out early.

605
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:23,693
- Why's that?
- Good behavior.

606
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:26,193
Do you know what this is?

607
00:45:29,507 --> 00:45:33,774
I'm guessing it's
some kind of detonator-type deal.

608
00:45:33,979 --> 00:45:37,312
There's 8 pounds of C-4 strapped
to each and every one of them.

609
00:45:37,516 --> 00:45:39,575
This is a spring-loaded
dead man's switch.

610
00:45:39,785 --> 00:45:41,377
If my thumb comes off it:

611
00:45:44,623 --> 00:45:47,888
And now, since we've had
a little change of plan...

612
00:45:48,093 --> 00:45:52,223
between the police showing up and
you sucking out all of my associates...

613
00:45:52,431 --> 00:45:54,558
I want you to break into the vault.

614
00:45:54,866 --> 00:45:57,960
You'll find three quarter-ton pallets
of small bills inside.

615
00:45:58,370 --> 00:45:59,735
Thirty million dollars.

616
00:46:00,806 --> 00:46:02,637
And you're gonna carry it for me.

617
00:46:02,841 --> 00:46:06,800
You are gonna get me safely
away from here with the money...

618
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:11,311
or else they'll be cleaning up
these hostages with a mop.

619
00:46:14,486 --> 00:46:16,317
I'm gonna have to say no to that.

620
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:21,426
I'm really trying
to turn over a new leaf.

621
00:46:21,627 --> 00:46:24,289
I will blow up this entire building,
you asshole.

622
00:46:27,466 --> 00:46:29,764
I really don't like that word.

623
00:46:29,968 --> 00:46:31,868
I will blow them sky-high...

624
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:34,766
and their blood
will be on your hands.

625
00:46:38,343 --> 00:46:40,436
Do you hear me, asshole?

626
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:51,623
Call me a asshole...

627
00:46:52,025 --> 00:46:53,492
one more time.

628
00:46:56,429 --> 00:46:58,260
Ass...

629
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:09,468
Keep your hand on that trigger.

630
00:47:10,176 --> 00:47:13,668
- Good job.
- No. You, good job.

631
00:47:16,015 --> 00:47:18,006
- Thank you.
- Good job.

632
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:22,085
Hancock!

633
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,411
Say hi to your fans.
Look what you got.

634
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,704
Here we go. This way.

635
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:25,442
- Hancock. At the bank today, intense.
- Thank you.

636
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,415
Smile.

637
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:28,712
Good job, Hancock!

638
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:33,282
Hey. Boy, they'll let anybody in here,
huh?

639
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:37,430
Hancock, meet these guys. This is
Mike Kilbourne and Jeremy Himmel.

640
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,098
Gigantic fans. Insane!

641
00:48:39,299 --> 00:48:41,494
These guys are partners
at the biggest ad firm.

642
00:48:41,702 --> 00:48:42,999
You never call, man.

643
00:48:43,203 --> 00:48:47,230
- I have called. A couple of times.
- Water under the bridge, man.

644
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:53,236
Could you guys
get used to this or what?

645
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,877
How'd you two meet?

646
00:48:58,786 --> 00:49:00,310
I was married once before.

647
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,580
First wife...

648
00:49:03,724 --> 00:49:06,522
she died giving birth to Aaron.

649
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:11,427
It's another dinner. But... But...

650
00:49:11,665 --> 00:49:14,156
So there I am, I'm with
this beautiful little baby.

651
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,131
I don't know what the hell to do.

652
00:49:16,336 --> 00:49:18,531
And I was in the supermarket...

653
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:21,171
and I'm in the baby aisle...

654
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,935
and I've got
a brand of diapers in each hand.

655
00:49:24,144 --> 00:49:28,047
I'm staring at them, but I don't know
how I'm gonna get through the day.

656
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:30,510
An angel...

657
00:49:31,953 --> 00:49:34,046
sees me.

658
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,688
She knew. She was...
She gave me this look.

659
00:49:40,261 --> 00:49:45,289
And even in the trance I was in,
I knew that somebody somewhere...

660
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,491
was throwing me a little rope.

661
00:49:48,269 --> 00:49:49,327
You know?

662
00:49:49,537 --> 00:49:53,496
Starting that day, you really
put my life back together. Right?

663
00:49:54,709 --> 00:49:58,645
- You're drunk.
- So? Come here.

664
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,476
What about you, buddy?

665
00:50:05,687 --> 00:50:07,587
You're from another planet,
aren't you?

666
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,921
No, man, I'm from Miami.

667
00:50:10,124 --> 00:50:12,490
You didn't come in on,
like, a meteor or...?

668
00:50:12,694 --> 00:50:15,219
Nope. Woke up in a hospital,
first thing I remember.

669
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:19,389
Government hospital, yes?
Experimenting on you and...

670
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:23,362
No, Ray. Regular old
Miami emergency room.

671
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,938
- Come on.
- My skull was fractured.

672
00:50:27,141 --> 00:50:30,736
They told me
I tried to stop a mugging.

673
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:35,177
- Somebody knocked you out.
- I guess I was a regular guy before...

674
00:50:35,383 --> 00:50:38,580
and when I woke up,
I was changed.

675
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:42,347
The hospital nurse tried
to put a needle in my arm...

676
00:50:42,557 --> 00:50:44,787
and it just broke against my skin.

677
00:50:45,026 --> 00:50:48,690
And then my skull healed
in, like, an hour.

678
00:50:48,898 --> 00:50:52,425
The doctors were astounded...

679
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:56,401
and they wanted to know my story.

680
00:50:56,605 --> 00:51:00,302
Just like you. But I couldn't tell them.
I don't know who I am.

681
00:51:01,243 --> 00:51:03,143
Amnesia.

682
00:51:03,612 --> 00:51:07,241
- You know, the blow to the head.
- Yeah, well, that's what they figured.

683
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:11,117
- You don't remember anything?
- No.

684
00:51:12,288 --> 00:51:15,086
Only thing I had in my pocket was...

685
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:17,225
bubble gum...

686
00:51:17,426 --> 00:51:19,485
two movie tickets.

687
00:51:19,695 --> 00:51:23,290
<i>Boris Karloff, Frankenstein.</i>

688
00:51:23,832 --> 00:51:26,733
But no ID, nothing.

689
00:51:26,936 --> 00:51:31,600
I went to sign out, the nurse
asked me for my John Hancock.

690
00:51:33,475 --> 00:51:35,238
I actually thought that's who I was.

691
00:51:36,445 --> 00:51:40,245
How come I didn't hear any of this,
didn't read about it in any newspapers?

692
00:51:40,449 --> 00:51:43,816
It was probably in the papers
80 years ago.

693
00:51:44,386 --> 00:51:45,853
Eighty years ago?

694
00:51:46,088 --> 00:51:48,283
Oh, I don't age. This is it.

695
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:51,323
- That's nice.
- Gotta wonder, though:

696
00:51:53,729 --> 00:51:56,960
What kind of bastard
must I have been...

697
00:52:00,636 --> 00:52:02,831
that nobody was there to claim me?

698
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:11,506
I mean, I'm not the most
charming guy in the world...

699
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:14,081
so I've been told, but...

700
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,150
nobody?

701
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:23,788
That didn't tire you out,
coming up the stairs?

702
00:52:23,994 --> 00:52:26,053
- Not really.
- I'm real spinny.

703
00:52:26,262 --> 00:52:29,163
Could've just flown me upstairs.

704
00:52:29,366 --> 00:52:31,994
- I could've done without that.
- Get your shoes off here.

705
00:52:32,202 --> 00:52:35,535
All right, that's all you're
getting off of me though.

706
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:41,506
You believe in me,
don't you, Hancock?

707
00:52:42,212 --> 00:52:44,806
- Of course, Ray. I believe in you.
- Help me up here.

708
00:52:48,151 --> 00:52:52,144
Listen. This is important because
I believe in you, you know, and...

709
00:52:55,158 --> 00:52:56,648
You're gonna do great.

710
00:52:59,195 --> 00:53:00,992
You're gonna fix everything.

711
00:53:05,235 --> 00:53:09,001
- You get some sleep, Ray.
- You sleep tight too.

712
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:12,241
Hancock tucking me in.

713
00:53:18,581 --> 00:53:20,879
All right, he's asleep.

714
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:23,920
The damn babysitter
never cleans up after herself.

715
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:39,231
You have a bruise on your hand.

716
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,602
You...

717
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,872
You should go.

718
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:53,473
Getting late.

719
00:54:18,943 --> 00:54:20,410
If Ray finds out about me...

720
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,645
you're dead.

721
00:55:11,029 --> 00:55:15,329
Joan, we're gonna take care
of that, okay? Don't you worry.

722
00:55:17,402 --> 00:55:19,165
Hi, honey.

723
00:55:19,371 --> 00:55:21,339
Breakfast?

724
00:55:21,873 --> 00:55:24,364
Hancock sneezed, huh?

725
00:55:24,576 --> 00:55:27,670
Can you believe it? It's amazing
that you slept through that.

726
00:55:27,879 --> 00:55:30,677
- You're a good sleeper.
- Holy shit.

727
00:55:31,049 --> 00:55:34,314
I'm not gonna say
I told you so, but...

728
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,582
You told me he was gonna sneeze
a hole through the house?

729
00:55:37,822 --> 00:55:39,221
I just said him being around...

730
00:55:39,424 --> 00:55:41,585
Oh, sweetheart, can you get that?
Thanks.

731
00:55:41,826 --> 00:55:44,226
- Oh, God, you strong man.
- I got it.

732
00:55:44,429 --> 00:55:46,659
But you don't worry about anything.

733
00:55:46,865 --> 00:55:50,164
I already apologized to the neighbors.
Called State Farm.

734
00:55:50,368 --> 00:55:51,801
Everything is taken care of.

735
00:55:52,537 --> 00:55:54,198
You just...

736
00:55:55,473 --> 00:55:58,306
enjoy that breakfast.

737
00:56:00,146 --> 00:56:02,876
What's this?
Are we going on vacation? Are we?

738
00:56:03,082 --> 00:56:04,276
Just the three of us.

739
00:56:04,483 --> 00:56:05,882
- End of the summer?
- Tonight.

740
00:56:06,152 --> 00:56:07,551
- Tonight?
- Let's go somewhere.

741
00:56:07,753 --> 00:56:09,550
Knock, knock.

742
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:12,921
Gesundheit.

743
00:56:13,659 --> 00:56:18,119
I was just telling Ray here,
I hope you're done sneezing...

744
00:56:18,364 --> 00:56:21,891
because I don't think our house
could take much more...

745
00:56:22,101 --> 00:56:23,591
of your sneezing.

746
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:33,868
Yeah, sometimes
I sneeze when there's dust...

747
00:56:36,415 --> 00:56:38,474
or if I get really surprised.

748
00:56:39,819 --> 00:56:42,845
That's unfortunate.
This is Kilbourne.

749
00:56:43,689 --> 00:56:46,089
Mike? How you doing?

750
00:56:46,792 --> 00:56:49,226
It was great to see you too.

751
00:56:49,428 --> 00:56:50,562
Yep. Well...

752
00:56:50,563 --> 00:56:52,588
Yep. Well...

753
00:56:52,832 --> 00:56:55,164
Right. Go ahead, shoot.

754
00:56:56,502 --> 00:56:59,403
Okay. I got a pen right here.

755
00:56:59,705 --> 00:57:02,401
Right. No, I know.

756
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,607
It's right here in my hand.

757
00:57:17,157 --> 00:57:19,182
I am warning you.

758
00:57:19,426 --> 00:57:20,620
All right, go ahead.

759
00:57:24,197 --> 00:57:25,289
Okay, good.

760
00:57:26,233 --> 00:57:30,829
Now... And that's still in 310, right?

761
00:57:31,038 --> 00:57:32,164
Hang on one second.

762
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,302
Do me a favor...?

763
00:57:35,242 --> 00:57:38,473
I'm sorry, Mike. Yeah.

764
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:40,510
We're gonna talk.

765
00:57:40,714 --> 00:57:43,615
Go away.

766
00:57:43,817 --> 00:57:47,685
Well, it is something
that I'm really excited about.

767
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:02,158
- I'm gonna do this all day.
- Shut... Shut up.

768
00:58:04,571 --> 00:58:06,038
L... l suppose...

769
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:08,537
- Fine. We'll talk, okay?
- We will.

770
00:58:08,775 --> 00:58:13,576
And when we're done talking, you go
away and you leave my family alone.

771
00:58:14,748 --> 00:58:17,808
- My place at 4:00.
- Whatever.

772
00:58:18,785 --> 00:58:22,186
It means... Well, I'd rather not
talk numbers now.

773
00:58:22,389 --> 00:58:25,415
I'd like to save them for the pitch.
So let's just set a time.

774
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:28,651
That's good with me.
I will see you then. All right.

775
00:58:28,862 --> 00:58:31,729
Yeah, 3:30. Great.

776
00:58:32,065 --> 00:58:34,499
Hon, is it hot in here?

777
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:58,918
He hurt you, didn't he?

778
00:58:59,927 --> 00:59:02,418
Come on, use your words.

779
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:05,121
How did it make you feel?

780
00:59:08,035 --> 00:59:09,195
Sore.

781
00:59:09,937 --> 00:59:10,995
Bad.

782
00:59:12,073 --> 00:59:13,097
Bad.

783
00:59:13,307 --> 00:59:17,505
It's because he took your power.
And you have to get your power back.

784
00:59:19,046 --> 00:59:23,415
And no one will give you your power
back. You have to go out and take it.

785
00:59:23,618 --> 00:59:25,711
You understand me?

786
00:59:27,422 --> 00:59:29,322
We're gonna go find Hancock...

787
00:59:30,925 --> 00:59:33,291
and get your power back.

788
01:00:14,169 --> 01:00:15,864
Ask.

789
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,501
- You and l.
- "You and I" what?

790
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:22,438
- We're the same.
- No.

791
01:00:23,312 --> 01:00:24,779
I'm stronger.

792
01:00:25,614 --> 01:00:26,979
Really?

793
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,510
Oh, yeah.

794
01:00:32,721 --> 01:00:34,382
Who are we?

795
01:00:34,623 --> 01:00:39,322
Gods, angels. Different cultures
call us by different names.

796
01:00:39,528 --> 01:00:42,520
Now all of a sudden, it's "superhero."

797
01:00:42,731 --> 01:00:46,326
- Are there more of us?
- There were.

798
01:00:46,702 --> 01:00:47,828
They all died.

799
01:00:49,905 --> 01:00:51,998
It's just the two of us.

800
01:01:01,049 --> 01:01:02,141
What is this?

801
01:01:06,188 --> 01:01:07,746
Who are we to each other?

802
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:10,925
- We're brother and sister.
- That's a lie.

803
01:01:12,428 --> 01:01:14,157
- No, I'm your sister.
- That is a lie.

804
01:01:14,364 --> 01:01:16,025
- I'm your sister.
- That is a lie.

805
01:01:16,232 --> 01:01:19,326
Sisters don't kiss brothers
the way you kissed me last night.

806
01:01:19,536 --> 01:01:20,833
You're lying, deal's off.

807
01:01:21,037 --> 01:01:23,096
Let's go see
how Ray feels about this.

808
01:01:23,306 --> 01:01:25,399
Get your ass back here!

809
01:01:25,608 --> 01:01:27,508
I'm telling!

810
01:01:32,882 --> 01:01:35,248
The All Heart symbol
will be known globally...

811
01:01:35,985 --> 01:01:37,452
as a symbol...

812
01:01:37,687 --> 01:01:42,522
that represents companies that
are committed to changing the world.

813
01:01:42,725 --> 01:01:45,125
They can give away
their sustenance goods, okay?

814
01:01:45,328 --> 01:01:47,592
Food, drugs, power, clothing,
for free.

815
01:01:47,797 --> 01:01:50,197
- We were talking about Hancock...
- Number two.

816
01:02:01,511 --> 01:02:03,274
You stay away
from me and my family.

817
01:02:03,479 --> 01:02:05,879
You are not gonna
do this to me again.

818
01:02:06,082 --> 01:02:09,074
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

819
01:02:09,285 --> 01:02:11,219
- Hey!
- I love you, Hancock!

820
01:02:11,421 --> 01:02:14,879
It can't work.
It always ends the same way.

821
01:02:15,091 --> 01:02:17,559
Persia. Greece. Brooklyn.

822
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,489
Brooklyn?
I've never been to Brooklyn.

823
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:22,389
I have put up with your bullshit
for 3000 years...

824
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:24,464
and I am done!
Done, you listening?

825
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:27,932
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- Finally, I am happy!

826
01:02:28,137 --> 01:02:31,733
- You are not gonna mess with that!
- I don't know what you're talking about!

827
01:02:31,942 --> 01:02:34,410
I hate to burst
your little crazy-lady bubble...

828
01:02:34,745 --> 01:02:39,239
but it must not have been all that
great because I don't remember you.

829
01:02:44,288 --> 01:02:46,620
Call me crazy...

830
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:49,990
one more time.

831
01:02:50,294 --> 01:02:51,591
Cuckoo.

832
01:03:00,904 --> 01:03:02,371
All right, hold it. All right.

833
01:03:02,973 --> 01:03:05,737
You better not hit me with that truck.

834
01:03:06,477 --> 01:03:10,208
For companies to qualify, they need to
prove they are a leader in the global...

835
01:03:10,414 --> 01:03:12,006
We wanna talk about Mr. Hancock.

836
01:03:12,216 --> 01:03:14,150
They're committed
to bettering the world.

837
01:03:14,351 --> 01:03:16,785
They can do this in four ways.
This is how they...

838
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:02,331
The most important thing
with All Heart is brand recognition.

839
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:04,434
I've mocked up
these examples here...

840
01:04:04,636 --> 01:04:06,604
in Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris.

841
01:04:18,383 --> 01:04:20,078
Oh, no.

842
01:04:20,652 --> 01:04:22,620
We need maximum exposure,
market penetra...

843
01:04:22,854 --> 01:04:23,854
Is it snowing?

844
01:04:38,737 --> 01:04:40,295
Get off!

845
01:04:40,505 --> 01:04:41,733
- Get off me!
- Listen to me!

846
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,374
- I hate you!
- I am sorry!

847
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:52,345
Whoever I am, whatever I did...
Look at me.

848
01:04:53,318 --> 01:04:55,286
I'm sorry.

849
01:05:31,223 --> 01:05:34,488
Why were you flying?
You were flying, Mary.

850
01:05:35,628 --> 01:05:38,426
- Yeah, she was definitely flying, Ray.
- Okay, I was flying.

851
01:05:39,565 --> 01:05:42,159
And I'm very strong as well.

852
01:05:42,368 --> 01:05:43,858
- It's just the way we are.
- "We"?

853
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:47,129
Me and him, it's just us now.
The others paired up and died.

854
01:05:47,339 --> 01:05:50,206
You didn't say anything
about pairing up at the trailer.

855
01:05:50,442 --> 01:05:53,002
- You were at his trailer.
- This is hard to explain.

856
01:05:53,212 --> 01:05:54,611
- Great, I'm all ears.
- Me too.

857
01:05:54,814 --> 01:05:57,544
Do me a favor, just give me
and my wife one moment.

858
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:00,184
- Don't bring it here, Ray.
- The adults are talking.

859
01:06:00,386 --> 01:06:02,013
Technically speaking...

860
01:06:03,956 --> 01:06:05,048
he's my husband.

861
01:06:06,258 --> 01:06:08,692
Holy shit.

862
01:06:09,161 --> 01:06:11,891
- What?
- We broke up decades ago.

863
01:06:12,097 --> 01:06:15,032
Long before you were born.
He just can't remember.

864
01:06:15,234 --> 01:06:18,328
But you can, right? You knew?

865
01:06:18,537 --> 01:06:21,005
That's something you bring up
on a first date, Mary.

866
01:06:21,207 --> 01:06:24,472
"I don't like to travel.
I'm allergic to cats. I'm immortal."

867
01:06:24,677 --> 01:06:27,044
Those are some things
you give a heads-up on.

868
01:06:27,247 --> 01:06:29,647
Whatever we are,
we were built in twos, okay?

869
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,147
We're drawn to each other.

870
01:06:31,351 --> 01:06:33,683
No matter how far I run,
he's always there.

871
01:06:33,887 --> 01:06:35,479
He finds me. It's physics.

872
01:06:35,689 --> 01:06:38,351
Are you saying that you two
are fated to be together?

873
01:06:38,558 --> 01:06:41,459
I've lived for a very long time, Ray.

874
01:06:41,895 --> 01:06:43,556
And the one thing I learned...

875
01:06:43,763 --> 01:06:46,527
fate doesn't decide everything.

876
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,499
People get to choose.

877
01:06:48,702 --> 01:06:50,932
And you chose...

878
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:54,470
to let me think I was here alone.

879
01:07:04,017 --> 01:07:06,542
I didn't think you'd miss
what you didn't remember.

880
01:07:08,154 --> 01:07:10,486
Great. Now what?

881
01:07:15,729 --> 01:07:18,095
I didn't plan for this.

882
01:07:40,987 --> 01:07:42,454
<i>Prison authorities confirmed...</i>

883
01:07:42,656 --> 01:07:46,320
<i>that the prisoner uprising was led
by Kenneth "Red" Parker, Jr...</i>

884
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,825
<i>who was also the leader of last
week's Spring Street bank robbery.</i>

885
01:07:50,064 --> 01:07:52,328
<i>At least eight prisoners
are not accounted for.</i>

886
01:07:52,566 --> 01:07:54,796
<i>More information
on the prison riot in Norwalk.</i>

887
01:07:55,002 --> 01:07:58,233
<i>Construction workers at the prison
were knocked unconscious.</i>

888
01:07:58,439 --> 01:08:00,430
<i>The prisoners stole
the workers' clothes...</i>

889
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:03,303
<i>and it's feared at least
some of them have escaped.</i>

890
01:08:03,511 --> 01:08:05,741
<i>Parker is considered
a criminal mastermind.</i>

891
01:08:05,947 --> 01:08:08,609
<i>He is very effective at
using psychological persuasion...</i>

892
01:08:08,816 --> 01:08:11,284
<i>to organize criminals
from different backgrounds.</i>

893
01:08:11,485 --> 01:08:14,420
<i>He is a former psychology professor
from Stanford University.</i>

894
01:08:14,622 --> 01:08:17,284
<i>While there, he organized
a notorious criminal network...</i>

895
01:08:17,491 --> 01:08:19,823
<i>comprised of graduate students
from diverse...</i>

896
01:08:20,027 --> 01:08:22,086
Ninety-one ten.

897
01:08:22,296 --> 01:08:24,594
Ninety-one ten?
You gotta be shitting me.

898
01:08:25,099 --> 01:08:26,464
Ninety-one ten.

899
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:29,067
Highway robbery.

900
01:08:52,927 --> 01:08:55,327
- What?
- I'm taking the money.

901
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:03,362
I can relate to that.

902
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:08,639
You know? If you want something...

903
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:12,604
nobody can stop you
from taking it...

904
01:09:13,715 --> 01:09:15,910
you just take it, right?

905
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:19,483
I like that.

906
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:21,849
But can you take it?

907
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,895
My Zagnut bar versus your gun.

908
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:36,401
Sorry about your window.

909
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,583
- I need Room 1020.
- Clear!

910
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:27,255
I need Room 1020.

911
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:34,654
I need IV line, blood quality,
CBC, electrolytes, a PT, and...

912
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:36,388
Where's his IV line?

913
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,892
- That's not gonna work.
- I'm in.

914
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:41,802
What's happening?

915
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,675
<i>This just in.
John Hancock has been rushed...</i>

916
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:49,606
<i>to Los Angeles General Hospital.</i>

917
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:52,975
<i>Hancock is in serious condition
with multiple gunshot wounds.</i>

918
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:55,309
<i>No story yet as to
how this happened to him...</i>

919
01:10:55,518 --> 01:10:59,477
<i>but we will continue to cover this
story live. Reporting live from L.A...</i>

920
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:08,695
- Any lead on the assailant?
- Mr. Embrey!

921
01:11:08,898 --> 01:11:12,857
- Just a couple of questions, sir, please.
- Can you describe how it happened?

922
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:16,436
From what I've heard,
he was trying to stop a robbery.

923
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:20,200
Do you know if special ammunition
was used in the gun that shot him?

924
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:21,535
Not that I'm aware of.

925
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,143
Could this have to do
with the mysterious woman?

926
01:11:24,347 --> 01:11:27,043
- He was seen battling her.
- I do not have that answer.

927
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:30,377
Could this woman
be more powerful than Hancock?

928
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:36,155
Here are the lab results for 209.

929
01:12:03,921 --> 01:12:05,718
You're becoming mortal.

930
01:12:07,391 --> 01:12:09,222
It's us...

931
01:12:09,726 --> 01:12:11,887
being close to each other.

932
01:12:12,696 --> 01:12:15,824
It's never happened this fast before.

933
01:12:18,435 --> 01:12:19,800
You have to leave.

934
01:12:21,138 --> 01:12:23,902
The further you get from me,
the better you're gonna feel.

935
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:26,701
You'll start getting
your powers back...

936
01:12:26,944 --> 01:12:29,742
and be flying and breaking things...

937
01:12:29,947 --> 01:12:32,541
and saving people
before you know it.

938
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:51,299
Well, it's like I said,
we were built in pairs.

939
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:56,438
And when we get close to
our opposites, we lose our power.

940
01:12:58,676 --> 01:13:03,204
- Why?
- So we can live human lives.

941
01:13:03,581 --> 01:13:06,243
Love, connect...

942
01:13:07,452 --> 01:13:11,388
grow old, die.

943
01:13:12,457 --> 01:13:15,255
What happened to us?

944
01:13:19,464 --> 01:13:21,557
Summer of 4 B.C.

945
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,628
We were becoming mortal, like now.

946
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,365
They came after me with swords.

947
01:13:31,809 --> 01:13:33,800
But you saved me.

948
01:13:37,482 --> 01:13:39,814
1850.

949
01:13:40,285 --> 01:13:42,185
They set our house on fire.

950
01:13:43,354 --> 01:13:46,255
You pulled me out of the flames.

951
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:50,657
Eighty years ago.

952
01:13:51,629 --> 01:13:53,756
What happened then?

953
01:13:54,332 --> 01:13:56,960
We were living in Miami...

954
01:13:57,502 --> 01:14:00,869
and a new movie
was playing in town.

955
01:14:01,072 --> 01:14:02,130
<i>Frankenstein.</i>

956
01:14:05,476 --> 01:14:07,535
And after...

957
01:14:08,046 --> 01:14:09,843
we walked down Flagler Street...

958
01:14:10,048 --> 01:14:13,984
and you took my hand,
and you held it so tight.

959
01:14:20,459 --> 01:14:23,360
And they attacked us in an alley.

960
01:14:27,032 --> 01:14:31,298
They hit you so hard.
There was so much blood.

961
01:14:32,371 --> 01:14:35,704
They wouldn't let me ride
in the ambulance with you.

962
01:14:36,675 --> 01:14:41,442
And by the time I got to the hospital,
you were awake.

963
01:14:45,551 --> 01:14:47,075
But you didn't know me.

964
01:14:49,621 --> 01:14:51,816
So I left.

965
01:14:52,991 --> 01:14:55,755
Every time we're together...

966
01:14:56,295 --> 01:14:58,729
they come after you through me.

967
01:15:12,444 --> 01:15:16,574
You're built to save people
more than the rest of us.

968
01:15:16,782 --> 01:15:19,683
That's who you are. You're a hero.

969
01:15:21,286 --> 01:15:23,982
The insurance policy of the gods.

970
01:15:24,523 --> 01:15:27,720
Keep one alive. You.

971
01:15:28,427 --> 01:15:31,191
To protect this world.

972
01:15:46,913 --> 01:15:47,913
Mary!

973
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:51,750
Mom!

974
01:15:51,951 --> 01:15:53,316
- Mary!
- Stay down!

975
01:15:53,753 --> 01:15:55,914
Okay.

976
01:16:06,366 --> 01:16:07,594
Mary?

977
01:16:20,814 --> 01:16:22,543
Stop.

978
01:16:25,084 --> 01:16:27,279
Oh, no! No! Please!

979
01:16:37,230 --> 01:16:38,754
Stay down.

980
01:16:50,543 --> 01:16:52,307
Hey! Mary!

981
01:16:52,513 --> 01:16:54,003
Let's go, get her up!

982
01:16:55,049 --> 01:16:57,677
Come on, Chuck. Let's go, let's go.

983
01:17:04,358 --> 01:17:06,724
- Morphine.
- Here. Help in here!

984
01:17:08,062 --> 01:17:09,654
Hold her down. Hold her down.

985
01:17:13,734 --> 01:17:14,734
Hold her down.

986
01:17:21,742 --> 01:17:23,505
Hold her down.

987
01:17:31,852 --> 01:17:34,013
- You want the monitor now?
- Stay calm.

988
01:17:50,971 --> 01:17:53,337
- Hold her, hold her, hold her.
- Need EKG leads.

989
01:18:27,742 --> 01:18:30,802
Upon us all, Hancock.

990
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,945
You're no different.

991
01:18:37,619 --> 01:18:40,952
Time to shut her down, Hancock.

992
01:18:41,156 --> 01:18:43,386
It's been a nice run.

993
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:15,756
Oh, we are all
sincerely gonna miss you.

994
01:19:17,626 --> 01:19:19,526
But it is time for you to move on.

995
01:19:23,398 --> 01:19:26,424
And maybe to a happier place.

996
01:19:28,471 --> 01:19:30,939
You can thank me if you want to...

997
01:19:32,141 --> 01:19:33,733
superhero.

998
01:19:44,153 --> 01:19:45,745
You didn't!

999
01:19:52,094 --> 01:19:53,186
Aaron!

1000
01:23:03,988 --> 01:23:08,516
- What about Attila the Hun?
- Completely cross-eyed.

1001
01:23:08,726 --> 01:23:09,750
- Cross-eyed?
- Yep.

1002
01:23:09,994 --> 01:23:12,724
All right,
what about Queen Elizabeth?

1003
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:16,559
- Needy.
- J.F.K.? What about him?

1004
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:19,601
Oh, yeah.

1005
01:23:20,605 --> 01:23:23,005
"Oh, yeah"? Anything more?

1006
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,904
Not like that. I was in Cuba
for the whole missile thing.

1007
01:23:26,111 --> 01:23:27,169
Yeah, hang on.

1008
01:23:29,248 --> 01:23:31,443
<i>- Hello?
- Ray.</i>

1009
01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:33,584
<i>Hey, I've been trying to call you.</i>

1010
01:23:33,785 --> 01:23:36,515
Yeah, I was out of cell range.

1011
01:23:37,389 --> 01:23:41,052
<i>- Are you outside?
- Yeah.</i>

1012
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:44,696
- Look up.
- All right, I'm looking up.

1013
01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:47,264
I'm looking up.

1014
01:23:52,671 --> 01:23:55,504
- Baby?
- What?

1015
01:24:02,948 --> 01:24:05,075
You're gonna change the world.

1016
01:24:05,284 --> 01:24:08,651
<i>- Good job, Ray.
- Oh, my God, Ray.</i>

1017
01:24:09,855 --> 01:24:12,380
Hey. Look up.

1018
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:14,558
Hancock.

1019
01:24:19,131 --> 01:24:20,894
I'm proud of you.

1020
01:24:21,099 --> 01:24:22,896
Thanks.

1021
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:27,470
Will I get in trouble for that?

1022
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:46,014
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

1023
01:25:46,219 --> 01:25:48,346
- Oh, my God! Sam! No!
- Drop your weapon, sir!

1024
01:25:48,554 --> 01:25:49,919
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1025
01:25:50,156 --> 01:25:52,590
- Drop it!
- Get back or I'll shoot! Get back!

1026
01:25:52,792 --> 01:25:54,384
Get back! I'm not playing.

1027
01:25:54,861 --> 01:25:57,625
Get back. Get back!

1028
01:25:58,064 --> 01:26:00,329
Damn, Handjob.
Where you come from?

1029
01:26:00,534 --> 01:26:02,661
All right, relax.
Just tell me what you need.

1030
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:05,168
Tell them cops to take
their guns off of me.

1031
01:26:05,372 --> 01:26:07,567
- All right.
- Tell them to take the guns off me.

1032
01:26:07,775 --> 01:26:09,572
Just take them off.
Lower your weapons.

1033
01:26:09,777 --> 01:26:14,077
You're gonna get us out of here
with that tight-ass Wolverine outfit on.

1034
01:26:14,548 --> 01:26:16,914
Now let's make it happen, asshole.
