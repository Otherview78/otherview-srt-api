1
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,759
<i>My husband used to tell me
I have an overactive imagination.</i>

2
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,060
<i>I can't help it.</i>

3
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,539
<i>I mean, haven't you ever been</i>

4
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,930
<i>on a train and wondered
about the lives</i>

5
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:15,510
<i>of the people
who live near the tracks?</i>

6
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,579
<i>The lives you've never lived.</i>

7
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,420
<i>These are things I want to know.</i>

8
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,250
<i>Twice a day, I sit in
the third car from the front</i>

9
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,710
<i>where I have the perfect view
into my favorite house.</i>

10
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,349
<i>Number 15 Beckett road.</i>

11
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,930
<i>I don't know when exactly.</i>

12
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,030
<i>I suppose I started
noticing her about a year ago,</i>

13
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,539
<i>and gradually,
as the months went past,</i>

14
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:52,379
<i>she became important to me.</i>

15
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,560
<i>I'm not the girl I used to be.</i>

16
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,889
<i>I think people can see it
on my face.</i>

17
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,819
<i>She's what I lost.</i>

18
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:40,550
<i>She's everything I want to be.</i>

19
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,789
<i>I imagine she's a painter.</i>

20
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,500
<i>She's creative.</i>

21
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,969
<i>He's a doctor or an architect.</i>

22
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,310
<i>He has a good laugh.</i>

23
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,579
<i>She can't cook.</i>

24
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,479
<i>I wonder what they say
to each other</i>

25
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,979
<i>before they go to sleep.</i>

26
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,900
<i>Today her name is Jess;
Tomorrow it could be...</i>

27
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,000
<i>Lisa or Amber.</i>

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
<i>It all depends on the day;
It depends on my mood.</i>

29
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,669
<i>The truth is,
I don't know her name.</i>

30
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,979
<i>I don't know if she paints or
whether he has a good laugh.</i>

31
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,150
<i>I just know they know love.</i>

32
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,120
<i>Sometimes I catch myself
trying to remember</i>

33
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,620
<i>the last time I had meaningful
contact with another person.</i>

34
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,899
<i>I used to live two doors down,
number 13 Beckett road.</i>

35
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:39,610
<i>- No.
- It was my first home.</i>

36
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,540
<i>We bought it together.</i>

37
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,269
<i>- It was ours. -You didn't
even like having him over.</i>

38
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,879
I hated it.

39
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,409
<i>Every day,
I tell myself not to look.</i>

40
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:55,459
<i>But then I look.</i>

41
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:04,290
<i>Are you alone?</i>

42
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:06,800
Yeah.

43
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,699
No, it's...
Come. It's all yours.

44
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,740
- Okay.
- Your baby's so cute.

45
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,899
- Oh, thank you.
- Hi, baby!

46
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,410
Is it a... is it a boy?

47
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,839
Yeah!

48
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,279
So sweet.
How ol... how old is he?

49
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,240
- Six months.
- Six months.

50
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:28,329
So sweet.

51
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,100
Shh.

52
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,699
Here.

53
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:09,829
<i>A teacher once told me I was</i>

54
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:11,660
<i>a mistress
of self-reinvention.</i>

55
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,500
Down the center line,

56
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,870
open, around and together...

57
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,470
<i>I wasn't really sure
what it meant at the time.</i>

58
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,399
Around and up.

59
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,009
<i>But since moving here,</i>

60
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:23,540
<i>I've come to understand it.</i>

61
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,810
<i>Ardsley-on-Hudson
is boring and routine.</i>

62
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,230
<i>It's a fucking baby factory.</i>

63
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:41,329
<i>I want to start my life
over again.</i>

64
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:45,790
<i>So far, I've been
a rebellious teenager...</i>

65
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:49,569
<i>lover...</i>

66
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,500
<i>Waitress...</i>

67
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,939
<i>Gallery director...</i>

68
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:56,939
<i>Nanny...</i>

69
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,909
<i>and...</i>

70
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,420
<i>A whore.</i>

71
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,689
<i>And not necessarily
in that order.</i>

72
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,389
<i>I can't just be a wife anymore.</i>

73
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,399
<i>That's why I...</i>

74
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,930
<i>Stay awake at night
staring at the ceiling.</i>

75
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,600
In fact, the only time
I feel like myself

76
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,879
is when I'm running.

77
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,050
You always felt that way?

78
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,639
Maybe since I was...

79
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,909
- About 17.
- Mm-hmm.

80
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,050
With Mac.

81
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,790
Mac? Who's Mac?

82
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,720
My brother's best friend.

83
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,699
My brother who died.

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,569
I tend to smile
when I'm nervous.

85
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,550
Sometimes I laugh.

86
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:14,889
For a year, Mac and I lived
in this hunting cabin.

87
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:19,490
We started fucking.

88
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:28,370
We were the saddest people
we knew.

89
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,950
But in a way,
that cabin made us happy.

90
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,269
No one could find us.

91
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,379
Everyone thought we were dead.

92
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:42,679
And if you were
to run away today,

93
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,320
right now, where would you go?

94
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,970
I read once that
when a train hits,

95
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,909
it can rip the clothes
right off of you.

96
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,649
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks

97
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:15,250
the nanny job is gonna
make me less restless.

98
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,149
Make me want to get pregnant.

99
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:19,950
And that's not the case?

100
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,549
When I finish work every night,

101
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,559
I run home
and I get in the shower

102
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,919
and I wash the smell
of that baby off of me

103
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:28,929
as fast as I can.

104
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,700
Ah.

105
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,909
When you woke up this morning,

106
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:46,610
I went and I brought you
back to bed with me.

107
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,389
And when I was feeding you,

108
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,450
we heard daddy singing
from the kitchen, didn't we?

109
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,940
Aw, daddy came upstairs
with a beautiful breakfast

110
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,210
that he made for mommy,
didn't he?

111
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,110
Yes, he did.

112
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,610
Thank you, Megan.

113
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,039
Oh.

114
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,909
Whew... ah...

115
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,909
- There.
- -There you go.

116
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,450
Come here.

117
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,450
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Oh.

118
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,220
Oh, hello.

119
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,169
I swear, I sometimes feel like
my heart is gonna explode.

120
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:39,730
- I mean, look at her.

121
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,340
Look at her.

122
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,970
You're not sleeping.

123
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,340
Hello? -:
You're not sleeping.

124
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,679
Hello?

125
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,679
- Hello?

126
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,610
- Is that another hang-up?
- Mm-hmm.

127
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,580
<i>And grab the corners.</i>

128
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,029
Mm.

129
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:07,799
And straight.

130
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,860
I got another job.

131
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,269
You what?

132
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:14,070
I'm really sorry, Anna.

133
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,480
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.

134
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,009
I am.

135
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,179
It's just, this isn't what I do.

136
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:26,480
Take care of children?

137
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,539
Or laundry.

138
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,460
Another gallery headhunted me.

139
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:36,889
That's great.

140
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:39,049
The thing is,
it starts tomorrow.

141
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:42,129
I'm out all day tomorrow.

142
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:44,690
- That is so uncool.
- I hate to leave you like this

143
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,700
without child care, but...
You don't have a job.

144
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:53,980
Okay, that sounded wrong.

145
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,879
I know that
you're busy volunteering.

146
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,909
It's not the volunteering.

147
00:11:57,909 --> 00:11:59,639
It's all the shopping,

148
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:02,090
it's spending hours
in the farmers' market...

149
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,710
It's finding
the right foods for her,

150
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,159
it's pureeing sweet potatoes,

151
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,649
and I do all of this
at the same time...

152
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,490
As I'm nursing.

153
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,190
Maybe you should go
back to work, too.

154
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,590
Mothers need to work.

155
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,240
It's actually better
for the kid.

156
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,830
And how would you know?

157
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,899
Your key.

158
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:30,909
There's no job more important
than raising a child.

159
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,190
Megan, please. I...

160
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:01,279
- Rachel. What are you doing?

161
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,580
Give me my baby.

162
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,779
Rachel, what are you doing?

163
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,919
Hello?

164
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,659
Oh.

165
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,399
- Thank you.
- Here.

166
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,039
Mm. Beautiful.

167
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,740
How many times
has she texted you today?

168
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,940
I don't know.

169
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,970
She called the landline
three times.

170
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,779
Oh.

171
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,820
- You have to talk to her.
- I know. I-I...

172
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,139
It's getting crazy.

173
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:42,850
I will. I know, I know, I know.

174
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,210
- Okay.
- It's gonna be fine.

175
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:48,179
Isn't it always fine?

176
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,190
Don't I always make
everything fine?

177
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,320
Stop.

178
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,100
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.

179
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,529
Are you sure you don't want me
to take you out tonight?

180
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:58,259
- No, I like it at home.
- Call Megan.

181
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:00,240
Ask her to come back.

182
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:05,100
She just quit.

183
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,509
She what?

184
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:08,350
She just told me
she got another job.

185
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,340
Oh.

186
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,889
Shame. Thought you guys were
kind of a good team together.

187
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,980
Mm.

188
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,450
So did I.

189
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,039
Hey, it's tom.
Sorry I missed you.

190
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,779
- I'll get right back to you.

191
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,710
Hey, tom. It's me.

192
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Uh, I just wanted
to wish mama a happy birthday.

193
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,320
- Happy birthday, mama.
- Rachel.

194
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,649
Jesus.

195
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,059
No, no, no, no, no.

196
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:07,720
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.

197
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,269
- Relax. Relax!
- Cathy, come on!

198
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,289
I just... I just need some
to go to sleep.

199
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:12,659
That's all.
I just need... I just...

200
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:14,570
I just need a little bit
to go to sleep.

201
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,039
What brought this on?

202
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,399
He posted another picture
of the baby.

203
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:24,269
- It was a cute picture.
- Yeah?

204
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,980
Yup.

205
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,179
Facebook and drunk ex-wives
do not make good friends.

206
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,919
I got it. I got it.

207
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:35,320
All right.
Let's get you to your room.

208
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:43,269
Rachel, you have to stop
calling them, okay?

209
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:49,799
I really appreciate this room.

210
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,970
I do.

211
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,700
I thought that
I would just be here for...

212
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,340
For a couple of weeks or months.

213
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,049
Yeah, that was two years ago.

214
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,460
Get some sleep.

215
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:38,380
I've rarely works
the first time.

216
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,130
Would you like a moment?

217
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:44,819
<i>It's okay, sweetie.</i>

218
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,559
We're gonna try again.

219
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,960
We can't afford to do it again.

220
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Well, when we can, we will.

221
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,430
<i>I wonder what she's looking at.</i>

222
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,380
<i>Or if she even sees
this train at all.</i>

223
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:20,829
<i>Who is that man?</i>

224
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:32,829
The next
station is Ardsley-on-Hudson.

225
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,839
<i>What is she doing?</i>

226
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,970
<i>She's throwing it all away.</i>

227
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:34,930
<i>Anna, I fell asleep last night</i>

228
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,160
<i>thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing</i>

229
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,539
<i>the inside of your thighs
and holding your breasts.</i>

230
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,559
<i>- -God, I wish</i>

231
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:43,500
<i>I was fucking you right now.</i>

232
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:46,869
<i>Anna, I love you.</i>

233
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,039
<i>I love you so much.</i>

234
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,069
<i>When it happened to me,</i>

235
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:53,509
<i>I found dozens of e-mails.</i>

236
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,250
<i>Tom told her that he never
felt like this before.</i>

237
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,910
<i>He said it wouldn't be
that much longer</i>

238
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,119
<i>-until they were together.</i>

239
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:04,420
I know what they say,

240
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,859
and you shouldn't check
his e-mail.

241
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:10,289
It was stupid.

242
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:12,400
But when I, um...

243
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,700
When I saw
it was from the realtor,

244
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,430
I thought that it was just spam.

245
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,650
And then I realized that
they were kisses, not X's,

246
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,369
and my husband was fucking
a century 21 agent.

247
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,210
That sucks.

248
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,279
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd,

249
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:29,539
and he was in love with her.

250
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,880
Come here for one second.

251
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,950
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd,"
but just yell it, all right?

252
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,599
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

253
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,759
That bitch is living
in my house.

254
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:47,569
I picked everything
in that house.

255
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:49,970
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table,

256
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,970
the kitchen table.

257
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,170
I wonder if she knows
that I fucked tom

258
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,579
on the same table
that her baby eats at.

259
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:58,519
I just want to tell her.

260
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:02,579
Oh, I wish I could tell her.

261
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:04,250
I picked everything
in that house.

262
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,079
I fucking picked
everything in that house.

263
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:14,200
I...

264
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,470
I could never find the words
to describe how I felt

265
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,099
when I read that e-mail.

266
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:23,930
But this morning, I did.

267
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,009
I did.

268
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:28,480
When I saw that woman...

269
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,650
Kissing someone else, just...

270
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,109
I... betraying her husband,

271
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,279
I felt... I felt it.

272
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,559
I felt pure rage.

273
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:46,359
It was like something
had been taken from me again,

274
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:49,660
and... just thought
if I could...

275
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,130
If I could,
I'd just go to her house

276
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,900
and I'd go and...

277
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,700
Find her sitting
at the kitchen table,

278
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,170
and I'd just...

279
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,799
I'd wrap my hand
in her long blond hair,

280
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:03,200
and I'd jerk her head back.

281
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,170
I'd just jerk it back.

282
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,380
And then I'd pull it down
to the ground,

283
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,809
and I would just...
Smash her head

284
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:13,630
all over the floor!

285
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,240
Move! Get out of my way!

286
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,920
Move! Move.

287
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,569
Hey!

288
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:09,829
Hey!

289
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:23,609
You whore!

290
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:58,750
Jesus Christ, Rachel.

291
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,579
Uh, what the hell
is wrong with you?

292
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,119
I spent the past hour
driving around looking for you.

293
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,170
You... you scared
the shit out of Anna.

294
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,660
- Do you know that?

295
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,730
She thought you were gonna...

296
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,339
She-she wanted to call
the police, so just...

297
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:22,680
- Leave us alone.

298
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,720
You can ruin your own life
if you want to,

299
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,210
but you're not
gonna destroy ours.

300
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,839
I'm not gonna
protect you anymore.

301
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,349
Oh, my god.

302
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,329
God.

303
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:39,019
God.

304
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:55,940
Rachel?

305
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,210
Open the door.

306
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,940
Cathy, I just...
I just need a sec.

307
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,950
Are you okay?

308
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,309
Rachel, open the door.

309
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,890
I have a stomach flu.

310
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,730
- Okay? I just...
- You don't have a flu.

311
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,150
What the fuck, Rachel?

312
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,430
I'm not stupid!

313
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,390
Rachel!

314
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,789
Cathy, just go away!

315
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,670
Come here for one second.

316
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,569
Just one second.

317
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:30,079
- Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."

318
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,519
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

319
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:41,420
- You whore!

320
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:26,970
No!

321
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,250
<i>Anyone counting days one to 90,</i>

322
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,220
who would like
to share a day count?

323
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,980
Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.

324
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,750
- Welcome, Jason.
- I've got 22 days back.

325
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:53,759
- Nice.
- There we go. -Good job.

326
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:57,529
Anyone else?

327
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,029
Hi. I'm-I'm Rachel and...

328
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,500
Welcome, Rachel.

329
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:09,349
- Hi, Rachel.
- And this... thank you.

330
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:11,740
This is day one, I-I suppose.

331
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,859
Um...

332
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:30,319
I'm here because I...

333
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:35,740
because I...

334
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,380
Because I woke up,
um, covered in blood.

335
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:44,819
And I had... I had bruises
all over my arm and, um...

336
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,150
It's usually from
when I've fallen

337
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,150
and someone's helped me up.

338
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,390
My husband...

339
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,690
He used to tell me
what I'd done the night before.

340
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,259
And I learned,
when you wake up like that,

341
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,799
you just say you're sorry.

342
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,329
You just say you're sorry
for what you did

343
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:14,470
and you're sorry
for who you are,

344
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,009
and you're never
gonna do it again.

345
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:19,369
But you do. You do it again.

346
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,150
And there's some time missing.

347
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,150
I need to remember.

348
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:32,490
I need to remember.

349
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,819
Okay.

350
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:35,529
Thank you, Rachel.

351
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,259
Am I... am I right?

352
00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:44,599
- Or am I nuts?
- No.

353
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,140
Make an effort!
You know, we all worked hard.

354
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,299
That was a charity event.

355
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:51,670
- You don't wear that.
- No, you don't.

356
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,650
Right? It was that,
um, the homeless thing.

357
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,890
I don't remember
what it was called.

358
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,309
Oh, oh, safe shelter.

359
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:59,650
Yeah.
That was a tube top, right?

360
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,849
Yup. It was.

361
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,160
I can't.

362
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,119
Why say, "yes, I'm gonna go,

363
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,630
"and I can't wait because

364
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,460
it's fun to dress up."
Then dress up.

365
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,960
<i>Do you like
devil's eggs, Martha?</i>

366
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,990
Deviled eggs? Yeah, I do.

367
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,299
- Deviled egg.
- Thank you for making them.

368
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,069
The classics. Do you want
to try one, anybody?

369
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:19,529
Uh, those go outside. I don't
want the eggs with the dessert.

370
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:21,140
It doesn't fucking matter
where they go, okay?

371
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,170
So do you want to put them
here? Do you want them

372
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,579
with your hot dogs
or you can put a couple

373
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:26,349
with your quinoa if you want to.

374
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:28,250
Do you want to put them with
your other salad and your corn?

375
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,920
- Rachel.
- Put a couple on the wall?

376
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,150
Rachel.

377
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,650
I'm fine, tom!

378
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,250
- Stop it.
- Come on.

379
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,089
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.

380
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:37,720
You never have my back.

381
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,589
- That's my boss's wife.

382
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:41,190
Probably got me fired
back there.

383
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,730
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.

384
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,660
- I'm your wife and you never...
- Rachel.

385
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,609
- You never fucking support me.
- Rachel, please stop it.

386
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:50,059
Hey, come on.
Need you to focus here.

387
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:51,230
<i>Don't fucking talk</i>

388
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,380
- to me like that!
- Relax!

389
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,599
Relax!

390
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,920
- Rachel.
- Hi, Cathy. I'm sorry.

391
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,349
- There you are.
- I need to get my shit together.

392
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,930
- I'm s...
- Shh.

393
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,690
You must be Ms. Watson.

394
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,259
I'm detective Riley.

395
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:18,259
This is detective Gaskill.

396
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,140
We need to ask you
a few questions.

397
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,029
What's this about?

398
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,869
Want to sit down?

399
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,470
Can you tell me
where you were Friday night?

400
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,690
I-I was at work
in the city, and then...

401
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,089
and then I went
to visit my husband.

402
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:45,789
You mean your ex-husband?

403
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:48,089
Yeah.

404
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,559
So I got off the train

405
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,930
at Ardsley-on-Hudson,

406
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,930
and then...

407
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,259
And then I decided
that it was a bad idea.

408
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:57,940
Around what time
did you reach that conclusion?

409
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,579
I was back here by 11:00.

410
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,640
Yeah. Yeah.

411
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,670
On your way back here,
did you stop anywhere?

412
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,779
No.

413
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,250
And what time did you
take the train there?

414
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:13,809
Um, 6:00. I...

415
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:15,420
So...

416
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,619
What'd you do
during those hours in Ardsley,

417
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,430
if you weren't seeing
your ex-husband?

418
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,170
Do you remember
seeing this woman?

419
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,930
She worked for your ex-husband.

420
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,769
She's gone missing.

421
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:37,210
What do you mean, she's missing?

422
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,210
Well, her husband said
she never came back home

423
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,079
the same night you got off
the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.

424
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,549
I was just... I was just...

425
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:46,980
Do you know Megan Hipwell?

426
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,460
- No!
- Did you see her?

427
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,960
No, I don't...
I don't think so.

428
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,230
Is that because
you were inebriated?

429
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:56,519
Just to clarify, you said
you were at work Friday?

430
00:33:56,529 --> 00:33:59,529
Are you referring to your job
in public relations?

431
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:00,960
Right.

432
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,369
It's my understanding
you were fired

433
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:03,859
from that job over a year ago

434
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:06,099
because of
your drinking problem.

435
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,659
Okay. That's enough for now.

436
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:27,019
If you're able
to remember anything else,

437
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,530
give us a call.

438
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,099
Did you really get fired?

439
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,699
Look, I didn't want you to worry

440
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,429
that I couldn't pay the rent.

441
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,210
If you don't have a job,
then what do you do every day?

442
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,039
I...

443
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:43,199
I-I ride the train.

444
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,909
You what?

445
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:48,079
I ride the train
to New York and back.

446
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,010
That's what
your alimony's paying for,

447
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:53,389
just tickets to nowhere?

448
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,389
That's really fucking weird,
Rachel.

449
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,429
O-okay, okay.

450
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,630
I just, I-I got on the train,

451
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,690
and then... and then I...
I got off the train.

452
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:07,929
I don't know.
It's-it's very unclear.

453
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,110
You don't remember anything,
do you?

454
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,809
You know, I read about this man
in long island...

455
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:16,780
Who blacked out.

456
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,809
He left a bar,

457
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:20,980
drove to the house
that he'd grown up in,

458
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,579
stabbed its occupants to death.

459
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,380
<i>He woke up the next morning,</i>

460
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,920
oblivious to what he did
until the police

461
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,380
<i>came to get him.</i>

462
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:29,829
- Rachel!
- What? What?

463
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:32,119
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.

464
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,059
- I'll give you a few weeks...
- Hold on.

465
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:37,289
Hold on.

466
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,829
Detective Riley!

467
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:41,760
- Yeah, I agree with you.
- Detective Riley!

468
00:35:41,769 --> 00:35:44,400
I saw someone
with Megan Hipwell,

469
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:45,980
but, uh, not on Friday night.

470
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,800
She...

471
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:50,610
She was having an affair,
she had a lover... that's what

472
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,239
- I'm trying to tell you.
- I thought you didn't know her.

473
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,989
No. But I s... but I saw her.

474
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:57,440
- You saw her where?
- I-I saw her from the train.

475
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,679
She was standing on-on the deck
with this man.

476
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,829
- With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
- No, it wasn't him.

477
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:03,780
This... man was different,

478
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:05,750
and th-they were...
They were kissing.

479
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,420
Wow. That's pretty
coincidental, isn't it?

480
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,699
You just happen to be on a train

481
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:13,699
at the same exact moment
that a woman you don't know,

482
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:15,659
but somehow recognize,
is cheating on her husband?

483
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,429
I-I know it sounds crazy.
Um...

484
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,210
Neighbors saw a drunk woman

485
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,480
in the vicinity of her house
Friday night.

486
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,519
Megan Hipwell does bear
a resemblance to Anna Watson.

487
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,179
Mrs. Watson reported

488
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:31,110
that you go to their house
sometimes uninvited,

489
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,019
and that on one occasion
you actually broke in

490
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:34,519
and took their child.

491
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,730
Let me give you some advice.

492
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,559
Don't go back to Beckett road.

493
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,820
Don't contact your ex-husband.

494
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:45,130
Don't go anywhere near
Anna Watson or her baby.

495
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,829
Are you listening to me?

496
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,130
Yes.

497
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:52,369
You don't live there anymore.

498
00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:54,369
Stay away.

499
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:05,320
<i>You know, I lie all the time.</i>

500
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,519
I lie to Scott.

501
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,889
I lie to you.

502
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:16,889
I mean, I know that's not
the point of therapy, but...

503
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,530
I have to keep things vague.

504
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,010
Jumble up all the men
and the exes, the lovers.

505
00:37:28,269 --> 00:37:30,199
It doesn't matter who they are.

506
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,769
It matters
how they make me feel.

507
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:43,349
Lying is like taking a trip.

508
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:53,070
It's like having a secret.

509
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,469
It's like touching yourself
and no one else knows.

510
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,409
Except you.

511
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:09,880
But you're just pretending.

512
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:16,389
You're just pretending
to touch yourself.

513
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,360
Scott's possessive, jealous.

514
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,730
He likes to own me.

515
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,840
He figures out all my passwords.

516
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,820
Which is kind of sexy.

517
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,119
So, when I came home last night,

518
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,599
Scott was on my laptop,
wondering why...

519
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,039
Scott's behavior is not normal.

520
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,199
It's a form of emotional abuse.

521
00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:07,699
Are you ever afraid of Scott?

522
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,480
It's not abuse.

523
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,050
Not if you don't care,
and I don't.

524
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:18,119
Maybe it's become
a normal state for you.

525
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,719
Is it normal I think about you
all the time?

526
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,329
<i>"Almost exactly a week ago,</i>

527
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,340
<i>"Megan Hipwell walked out
of number 15 Beckett road</i>

528
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,340
<i>"and disappeared.</i>

529
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,869
<i>"No one has seen her since.</i>

530
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,050
<i>"Neither her phone
nor her bank cards</i>

531
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,440

You Megan's friend?

539
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,460
Yes. Rachel.

540
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,760
Come in.

541
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,639
- Do you want a coffee?
- Uh, sure. Thank you.

542
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:46,969
Sorry it's a mess.

543
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:49,369
I've been hunting for her
social, her birth certificate.

544
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,880
And the cops need a lot.

545
00:40:54,449 --> 00:40:56,380
Have we met somewhere before?

546
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,610
I... I don't think so.

547
00:40:58,619 --> 00:40:59,920
And you know Megan from...?

548
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Uh, from the gallery.

549
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,119
Oh, you're an artist?

550
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,949
Uh, well, I like to think so.

551
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,760
So, you said on the phone

552
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:15,739
you wanted to tell me
something about Megan.

553
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:20,110
What did you want to tell me?

554
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,840
I saw your wife...

555
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,409
With someone...

556
00:41:25,409 --> 00:41:27,139
On Friday morning.

557
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,349
With who?

558
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:30,949
She was up there on your porch.

559
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:33,679
Um... I saw her from the train,

560
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,460
because I commute
to Manhattan every day

561
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,860
and I go straight past here.

562
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,869
She kissed him.

563
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,039
They were kissing.

564
00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:56,699
I'm sorry.

565
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,409
I know this is
a terrible thing to hear.

566
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,039
Yeah.

567
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,510
I know how it feels.

568
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,059
What did he look like?

569
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,059
He-he was...
He was average height.

570
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,639
He had dark hair.

571
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,309
And they were out there
on the porch?

572
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:25,070
Yes.

573
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,880
Fuck.

574
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,420
Fuck.

575
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,969
Oh, no, no, no. Thank you.

576
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:53,940
Okay, sure.

577
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:01,440
Uh, it could... I-I don't know.

578
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,840
Maybe it's a good thing.

579
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,539
Could mean she's all right.

580
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,179
She just ran off with someone.

581
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:11,179
Right.

582
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,590
Has she talked to you?

583
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,789
Oh, no, n...

584
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:22,420
Um, I haven't heard anything.

585
00:43:22,429 --> 00:43:25,369
But you know her well enough
to know where we live.

586
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,139
Megan doesn't have many friends.

587
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:32,309
Well, I used to live nearby,
and, um, she and I,

588
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:35,710
we took... we took yog...
We took Pilates... together.

589
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,539
I-I think I should go.

590
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:40,409
I feel like I've taken up
too much of your time, and...

591
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:43,110
So sorry
to have had to tell you...

592
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,619
Tell you that in that way and...

593
00:43:44,619 --> 00:43:47,389
Hey.

594
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:50,230
Do you think you'd recognize
him again if you saw him?

595
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,550
I don't know.

596
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:55,789
There's a guy. A therapist.

597
00:43:57,059 --> 00:43:59,289
His name's, um, ab...

598
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,670
Abdic... Abdic.

599
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,329
Uh, Kamal... Abdic.

600
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:12,739
Is that who you saw?

601
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,849
I don't know.

602
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:17,320
I really can't tell.

603
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,059
She spends a lot of
fucking time with her shrink.

604
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:34,630
<i>That's him.</i>

605
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:37,639
I remember. That's him.

606
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:39,179
I remember.
That's him.

607
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,679
I'm sorry.

608
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,519
<i>Where are you? Where are you?</i>

609
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:58,449
Where are you?

610
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,829
Where are you?

611
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,590
Stay away from me!

612
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,400
<i>This is so stupid.</i>

613
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,610
He makes every conversation
about getting pregnant.

614
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,039
And every time we go there...

615
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:46,739
Where?

616
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:49,170
To that subject.

617
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,309
What subject?

618
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:56,280
Megan.

619
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,940
What subject?

620
00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:17,110
It's okay.

621
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:22,139
- Megan.

622
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:24,400
No!

623
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,579
Megan.

624
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,610
All right, Megan.

625
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:38,630
We shouldn't.

626
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:41,389
No.

627
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,730
Megan.

628
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,659
Don't make it impossible
for us to work together.

629
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,269
Meg...

630
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,550
Megan, I could lose my practice.

631
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,010
I don't give a fuck!

632
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:04,010
I don't give a fuck
about your fucking practice!

633
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:06,610
I don't give a...

634
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:08,349
<i>¿Qué es lo Que tú quieres de mí?</i>

635
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,460
<i>¿Qué es lo Que tú
quieres de mí? Ah, ah, sí.</i>

636
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,599
<i>¿Qué es lo Que tú quieres
de mí? Me estás volviendo...</i>

637
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:15,019
<i>¡Me estás volviendo loco!
¡me estás volviendo loco!</i>

638
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,769
<i>Dr. Kamal Abdic...</i>

639
00:47:21,769 --> 00:47:23,809
<i>Dr. Kamal Abdic
has been brought in</i>

640
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:25,469
<i>for questioning
on the disappearance</i>

641
00:47:25,469 --> 00:47:27,800
<i>of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident
Megan Hipwell.</i>

642
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:32,280
<i>He was, according to sources,
Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.</i>

643
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:39,010
<i>For the first time in ages,
I have purpose.</i>

644
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,960
<i>Or at least
I have a distraction.</i>

645
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:48,150
<i>I want Megan to show up
safe and sound.</i>

646
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:50,190
<i>I do.</i>

647
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:52,139
Yeah!

648
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,730
<i>Just not quite yet.</i>

649
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:06,739
Hi.

650
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,179
What's wrong?

651
00:48:08,179 --> 00:48:10,179
Abdic's been released.

652
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,710
- What?
- There wasn't enough evidence.

653
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,159
And because I'm the one that
got him arrested, he talked.

654
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,159
A lot.

655
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:20,030
They'll... they'll build a case
against him.

656
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,829
It'll just take some time.

657
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:24,000
Are you totally sure he's
the guy you saw Megan with?

658
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,139
Yes.

659
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:28,070
You sure as fuck better be.

660
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:29,699
I don't understand.

661
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:31,530
- The police think I did it.
- Yeah, but he's...

662
00:48:31,539 --> 00:48:33,880
- He's the one...
- He told them Megan's miserable.

663
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,670
That I'm a jealous,
controlling husband.

664
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:41,219
I'm sure that they're just...
Trying to rule you out.

665
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:44,239
Abdic told them I'm abusive.

666
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:49,079
When she walked out,
I... I didn't go after her.

667
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:51,190
I never called to check on her.

668
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,429
I went to a sports bar,
for fuck's sake.

669
00:48:55,429 --> 00:48:56,699
Got drunk.

670
00:48:56,699 --> 00:48:58,599
No, we j...
We just need to find

671
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:00,099
more evidence on Abdic.

672
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:02,260
I've spent the whole day
going through her stuff.

673
00:49:02,269 --> 00:49:04,369
There's no e-mails.
There's nothing.

674
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:05,800
No letters, no e-mails.

675
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:07,440
Nothing.

676
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,000
For a second, I thought about
contacting Abdic myself.

677
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,039
- Fucking phone won't stop!

678
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,880
This is Scott.

679
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,090
Yeah, yeah.
H-hold on, hold on.

680
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,929
Do you mind?

681
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,739
Oh. Come here.

682
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:50,639
Oh, you're heavy. You're heavy.

683
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,809
- You're getting a little fatty.
- Rachel, no.

684
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,320
Anna, get in the house.

685
00:50:02,289 --> 00:50:05,960
Your-your... your wife hit me
on Friday night!

686
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,269
No. What are you talking about?

687
00:50:07,269 --> 00:50:09,139
Yes. Yes, yes, you did.
Yes, you did!

688
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:12,969
And then sh... and then she...
She-she got in your car.

689
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:15,440
No. She said you yelled at her
that night.

690
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,039
No, that is not what happened.

691
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:19,440
She was... she was in
the tunnel, and she-she hit me.

692
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,150
I don't want to argue
in the street.

693
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,889
The middle of the day
and you're drunk.

694
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:24,340
Look, I'm not drunk, tom.

695
00:50:27,889 --> 00:50:29,889
My wife is scared of you.

696
00:50:29,889 --> 00:50:31,619
Of what?

697
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:35,619
I don't even know
if that's a joke or not.

698
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,670
- Let's start with child abduction.
- That's bullshit.

699
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,190
You know that's not
how it happened.

700
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:41,909
You and I both know
what you're capable of.

701
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,309
Were you just
at Scott Hipwell's house?

702
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,010
Why are you at
Scott Hipwell's house?

703
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:56,590
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.

704
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,010
- How?
- To try and find Megan.

705
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:00,320
You don't even know Megan.

706
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,420
Rach...

707
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,420
I don't think
you're helping anybody.

708
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:12,199
<i>So you're here because you want</i>

709
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:14,070
to uncover lost memories.

710
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,510
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.

711
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,829
Pardon?

712
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,369
No, sorry, I-I, um,

713
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:22,070
wasn't expecting you
to have an accent.

714
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,949
Well, you have an accent.

715
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,579
Where are you from?

716
00:51:28,579 --> 00:51:30,710
I'm an American citizen.

717
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:33,019
But I guess you're not here
to talk about me.

718
00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:35,059
- Unless you are.
- No, no, I...

719
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:38,260
Sorry, I was just, uh, just
trying to make conversation.

720
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,460
The blackouts.

721
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,260
You're experiencing blackouts?

722
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,559
Mm-hmm.

723
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,659
Do you want to tell me
about them?

724
00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:50,929
Mm...

725
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,969
Well, when I...

726
00:51:53,969 --> 00:51:57,599
Wake up, and when someone
tells me what I've done...

727
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,650
it just doesn't feel like me

728
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:05,079
or like something
that I would do.

729
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:07,889
I feel bad about it, but, um...

730
00:52:07,889 --> 00:52:10,489
But it's like
it's so far removed,

731
00:52:10,489 --> 00:52:12,489
that I have a...

732
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:16,789
I just don't feel bad enough.

733
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,730
And you want to take
personal responsibility

734
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:20,730
for what you've done,
but you find it difficult

735
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:23,900
to feel accountable because
you can't even remember it.

736
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:28,570
Yeah?

737
00:52:29,909 --> 00:52:31,510
Yeah.

738
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:34,139
So, Rachel, besides drinking...

739
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:38,280
Because you clearly drink.

740
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,550
You've been drinking today,
haven't you?

741
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,420
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?

742
00:52:51,699 --> 00:52:54,030
I like to draw. Art.

743
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:55,860
I guess.

744
00:52:55,869 --> 00:52:57,309
Good. We can try to...

745
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:59,170
Regain some of your memories
by drawing them.

746
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:01,469
I've tried it. It doesn't work.

747
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,340
And have you ever tracked
all the way back

748
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:04,869
to when you started
drinking heavily?

749
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,539
When was that?

750
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,690
It was with tom.

751
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,489
When I couldn't get pregnant.

752
00:53:15,489 --> 00:53:17,489
Who's tom?

753
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:19,550
He's my ex-husband.

754
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:21,400
You want to talk about that?

755
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,429
I really wanted a baby.

756
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:37,150
And we tried everything,
and nothing worked.

757
00:53:40,809 --> 00:53:42,940
And it just absolutely...

758
00:53:55,389 --> 00:53:57,360
It just broke my...

759
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,429
My heart, and...

760
00:54:00,429 --> 00:54:02,760
So it got really sad.

761
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:04,670
And then, um...

762
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:10,349
and then the-the booze
just, uh, broke us.

763
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,110
Good.

764
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:15,480
Tell me more.

765
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:23,690
I used to watch
this perfect couple.

766
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,289
And they were just the...

767
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,730
Embodiment of...

768
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:33,389
True love.

769
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,610
It's like the kind of love
you always want.

770
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:42,840
And then she betrayed him.

771
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,679
And it sparked something in me.

772
00:54:55,389 --> 00:54:57,989
Why are you really here, Rachel?

773
00:54:57,989 --> 00:55:01,619
Because I'm afraid of myself.

774
00:55:10,469 --> 00:55:12,059
<i>July 5th.</i>

775
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:14,769
<i>1:33 and 1:34.</i>

776
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,900
<i>1:37.</i>

777
00:55:16,909 --> 00:55:18,269
She calls again 1:38.

778
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,980
And then she calls again
at 1:44, 1:45,

779
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,840
2:15 P.M.

780
00:55:22,849 --> 00:55:24,989
And July 6th.
You get the point.

781
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:28,820
She sometimes texted him
dozens of times a day.

782
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,320
But these are all
from an unknown number.

783
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,690
- Mm, and unknown is Rachel.
- You have a log

784
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:35,449
of the calls;
You don't have a log

785
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,019
of what they're saying
to each other.

786
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:41,789
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house

787
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,260
- since the incident with your child?
- Not that I know of.

788
00:55:44,269 --> 00:55:45,829
Well, then you may have a case

789
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,510
for harassment
in the second degree,

790
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,349
but these are texts,
they're not threats, so...

791
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,440
She has been hanging around
Scott Hipwell's house.

792
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:54,849
A lot.

793
00:55:54,849 --> 00:55:56,980
Yeah, I'm aware.

794
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,150
There are a lot
of loose ends here

795
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:01,610
that suggest something,
but they don't add up to much.

796
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:04,480
If you could bring me
something more solid...

797
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:06,690
What more do you need?

798
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,989
Evidence.

799
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,960
Real evidence.

800
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:16,699
You sure your husband

801
00:56:16,699 --> 00:56:18,900
doesn't want to stay in touch
with his ex-wife?

802
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:20,309
What? No.

803
00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:21,840
She's harassing us.

804
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,239
Is that what he calls it?

805
00:57:06,449 --> 00:57:08,650
Hi.

806
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,360
- Hey.
- Hi.

807
00:57:49,489 --> 00:57:50,889
Hi.

808
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,500
Reporters are in my yard.

809
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,900
They're everywhere.

810
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,929
I didn't know where else to go.

811
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,539
Come in.

812
00:58:08,949 --> 00:58:10,920
The detective just...

813
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:15,449
The detective
just told me something

814
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,860
I've wanted to hear
for a long time.

815
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:24,360
She's pregnant.

816
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:29,030
She told her shrink but not me.

817
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:34,869
I wanted a family.

818
00:58:34,869 --> 00:58:37,769
But she fought me
every step of the way.

819
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,449
We always fought about it.

820
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:46,389
Did Megan ever say anything
about me to you?

821
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:57,130
She loved you.

822
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,900
She loved you in ways

823
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,530
that people only dream
of being loved.

824
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,000
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

825
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,440
I just...

826
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,269
I need to tell someone.

827
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,210
Just once.

828
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:23,610
Just say it out loud.

829
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:25,349
I want to tell you.

830
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:31,380
And then I'll be gone.

831
01:00:31,389 --> 01:00:33,349
I swear.

832
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,639
I got pregnant.

833
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:47,469
I was 17.

834
01:00:47,469 --> 01:00:50,369
I had her by myself.

835
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,039
She had dark eyes
and blond hair.

836
01:01:03,789 --> 01:01:06,500
I expected it to be hard,
but it wasn't.

837
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,260
It was easy.

838
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:17,199
Because I loved her.

839
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:19,699
I loved her.

840
01:01:21,869 --> 01:01:25,269
We called her Elizabeth.

841
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,179
Libby.

842
01:01:28,849 --> 01:01:31,289
Libby.

843
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,619
It was December.

844
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:42,599
We had gotten in a fight,
me and Mac.

845
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,670
He'd gone off
and... and left.

846
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:52,800
<i>The roof was leaking.</i>

847
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:56,409
<i>It was freezing cold, so...</i>

848
01:01:56,409 --> 01:01:59,539
<i>I got in the tub.</i>

849
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:02,210
<i>I brought Libby in with me.</i>

850
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:05,480
<i>Put her on my chest.</i>

851
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,880
Her head just... under my chin.

852
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:19,170
I fell asleep.

853
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,929
<i>I let her go.</i>

854
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:30,000
<i>I let her go.</i>

855
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:33,079
I let her go.

856
01:02:34,579 --> 01:02:36,090
I let her go.

857
01:02:38,849 --> 01:02:40,849
<i>I...</i>

858
01:02:40,849 --> 01:02:42,309
<i>I couldn't look.</i>

859
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,619
<i>I didn't want to see it.</i>

860
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,000
<i>I didn't want to see it.</i>

861
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:54,389
I wrapped her in a blanket,

862
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,300
and I buried her.

863
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,610
And...

864
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,260
Mac went out that night...

865
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:25,159
and he never came back.

866
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,440
He never came back.

867
01:03:48,619 --> 01:03:50,980
I missed our home.

868
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:02,099
So one day, when I was drunk,

869
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:04,730
<i>I decided to go there.</i>

870
01:04:08,539 --> 01:04:12,269
<i>The front door was open;
It's not like I broke in.</i>

871
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,360
<i>And then I heard Evie.</i>

872
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:31,030
<i>Who's Evie?</i>

873
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:33,230
<i>Tom's baby.</i>

874
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:57,050
<i>And I know this sounds...</i>

875
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:00,159
<i>Insane...</i>

876
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:02,559
<i>But I just wanted to hold her.</i>

877
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,469
<i>Just for a moment.</i>

878
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:37,059
Rachel.

879
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:40,960
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

880
01:05:40,969 --> 01:05:42,809
Rachel...

881
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:54,739
Give her to me.

882
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,920
Shh, shh, shh.

883
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,750
Oh. Mommy's here.

884
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:02,079
- Shh. Oh.

885
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:04,489
Shh.

886
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,829
<i>I wasn't going to hurt her.</i>

887
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,869
<i>I would never hurt her.</i>

888
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:19,239
I just wanted to hold her.

889
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:45,989
<i>"Partially decomposed
body found.</i>

890
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,530
<i>"Female body found. Death a

899
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:09,420
- Mr. Hipwell!

900
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,769
What's wrong?

901
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:55,590
I'm sorry.

902
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:19,380
This reminds me of when I used
to watch you getting dressed

903
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:20,850
before going back to her.

904
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:29,130
Back to this house.

905
01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:35,239
I actually miss being
the other woman.

906
01:08:35,239 --> 01:08:37,239
Did you enjoy
cheating on Rachel?

907
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:40,140
Seriously?

908
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:42,680
Can we not fixate on her?

909
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:46,050
I saw her again today.

910
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:47,779
Where?

911
01:08:47,789 --> 01:08:49,890
This afternoon, when the police
brought Scott back home.

912
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:51,289
She was across the street.

913
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:58,260
And when she saw me,
she got aggressive.

914
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,390
Aggressive how?

915
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:03,069
What if Rachel killed Megan?

916
01:09:03,069 --> 01:09:05,000
Rachel did not kill Megan.

917
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,770
Then why is she creeping
around Scott's house?

918
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:08,829
- She's dangerous, and you know it.
- Anna, Anna.

919
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:12,470
Sweetheart...
Rachel is a sad person.

920
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:15,520
She's completely harmless.

921
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,140
What are you doing here?

922
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:46,170
How di... how did you get in?

923
01:09:50,449 --> 01:09:52,180
Come here.

924
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:53,850
Have a beer with me.

925
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:57,380
Uh, I'm-I'm not drinking
right now.

926
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:05,720
Detective Riley
came to see me last night.

927
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:10,800
It turns out,
I'm not the father.

928
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,470
Neither is the shrink.

929
01:10:15,239 --> 01:10:18,310
Did my wife confide in you
about a third man?

930
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:23,310
Sit down.

931
01:10:26,579 --> 01:10:29,449
Sit down!

932
01:10:31,989 --> 01:10:34,529
Look, I don't know, I don't
know what this is about...

933
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:35,829
Oh, come on.

934
01:10:35,829 --> 01:10:38,430
You and Megan
were such good friends.

935
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,229
You must've known.

936
01:10:43,699 --> 01:10:45,430
Admit it.

937
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:47,369
Admit what?

938
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:50,239
Admit that you never even
fucking met my wife.

939
01:10:53,609 --> 01:10:55,970
The detective said
you didn't even know Megan.

940
01:10:58,279 --> 01:11:00,680
She used other words, too.

941
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:02,890
Alcoholic.

942
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:04,430
Maybe even mentally unstable.

943
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:05,880
I am sorry.

944
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:07,619
I was honestly just
trying to help you.

945
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:12,090
You're tom's crazy ex.

946
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:14,539
When the fuck were you
gonna tell me that, huh?

947
01:11:14,539 --> 01:11:16,960
And now the detective
is asking if you and I are

948
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:18,069
in a relationship?

949
01:11:18,069 --> 01:11:19,560
You?

950
01:11:19,569 --> 01:11:23,270
I would never even
get near someone like you!

951
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,810
My wife is dead.

952
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:28,270
And you're lying to me!

953
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:30,479
What's wrong with you?

954
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:32,079
- Who does this?
- I needed to tell you

955
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:33,279
about Megan's affair,

956
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,560
and you wouldn't
have believed me

957
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,880
if I was just tom's ex!

958
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:37,760
Oh, well, thank you, you know?

959
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,390
For getting Abdic
to point the finger at me.

960
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:43,689
For getting the cops to say
that you and I are fucking!

961
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:52,130
How are they going, huh?

962
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,810
You know, the sessions.

963
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,300
With the doctor.

964
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,779
I wanted to know about Abdic.

965
01:12:03,779 --> 01:12:05,810
And I-I went to him
to help you...

966
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:09,310
You're just a sad liar
with no life.

967
01:12:10,619 --> 01:12:12,319
- You're all liars.
- Please...

968
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:34,039
I need to file a statement.

969
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:35,050
Name.

970
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,180
Rachel Watson.

971
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:38,539
Pete, I got this.

972
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:53,460
You wanted to file a statement?

973
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:55,229
I'm listening.

974
01:12:55,229 --> 01:12:57,899
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.

975
01:12:57,899 --> 01:13:01,399
You mean your new boyfriend,
Scott Hipwell?

976
01:13:01,409 --> 01:13:03,840
No, we-we were just friends.

977
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,640
But that's what you wanted,
isn't it?

978
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,510
I mean, you got him
to stay overnight

979
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:08,670
- at your apartment, right?
- No, you-you...

980
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,380
You need the context...

981
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,680
I know the context, but
what I'm trying to determine

982
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,350
is when your obsession
with Mr. Hipwell began.

983
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:18,180
Was it before or after
his pregnant wife was murdered?

984
01:13:18,189 --> 01:13:20,920
I mean, you were neighbors
at one point.

985
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,060
I met him after.

986
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:24,090
After being questioned by me,

987
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,699
you befriend another even more
obvious suspect than yourself,

988
01:13:26,699 --> 01:13:29,600
and then you manage to get him
to incriminate himself,

989
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,829
all the while
hoping he'll fuck you.

990
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,340
I came here trying to help you!

991
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:37,409
He just assaulted me
in my own house!

992
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,619
You were seen
in the area that night.

993
01:13:41,619 --> 01:13:44,079
There are several hours

994
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:46,380
that you say
you can't account for.

995
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:49,420
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.

996
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:51,449
No, he didn't.

997
01:13:53,689 --> 01:13:56,090
Surveillance footage
from a sports bar

998
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:59,489
accounts for Mr. Hipwell's
whereabouts that night.

999
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:04,510
You're lying. You're lying.

1000
01:14:08,869 --> 01:14:10,770
Tell me what happened.

1001
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:17,380
It's okay.

1002
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:19,710
Tell me.

1003
01:14:21,789 --> 01:14:23,960
I don't know.

1004
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,359
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?

1005
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,470
Hi.

1006
01:14:47,479 --> 01:14:49,579
I need to see you.

1007
01:14:49,579 --> 01:14:51,539
Can you please come over?

1008
01:15:04,359 --> 01:15:07,460
<i>I can still see her dark eyes.</i>

1009
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:09,770
<i>I can smell her skin.</i>

1010
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:13,409
<i>I can feel how cold she was.</i>

1011
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:16,329
Forgive yourself.

1012
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:30,529
You don't have to be afraid
of being alone.

1013
01:15:33,819 --> 01:15:35,789
You're not alone.

1014
01:15:50,369 --> 01:15:53,939
The next
station is Ardsley-on-Hudson.

1015
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:04,390
You'll be fine.

1016
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:06,289
You and your baby will be fine.

1017
01:16:47,529 --> 01:16:49,460
Why are you following me?

1018
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:51,939
Why are you here?

1019
01:16:51,939 --> 01:16:53,470
Uh...

1020
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:55,699
I could ask you
the same question.

1021
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:57,739
I saw you.

1022
01:16:57,739 --> 01:16:59,569
I saw you that night
in the tunnel.

1023
01:16:59,579 --> 01:17:01,050
I saw you there.

1024
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:03,380
- And I-I know I saw you there.
- All right.

1025
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:04,640
Lady, I live here.

1026
01:17:04,649 --> 01:17:07,279
I'm always in that tunnel.

1027
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,819
But-but what did you,
what did you see?

1028
01:17:09,819 --> 01:17:11,380
What happened that night?

1029
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:12,619
What did you see?

1030
01:17:12,619 --> 01:17:13,989
All right, you, uh...

1031
01:17:13,989 --> 01:17:15,289
You busted your ass.

1032
01:17:15,289 --> 01:17:16,750
You fell.

1033
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,260
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.

1034
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,789
You told me to fuck off,
so I fucked off.

1035
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,130
Was I with anyone?

1036
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:24,800
- Was I, was I alone?

1037
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,130
Was i... what happened?

1038
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,109
I don't know.

1039
01:17:28,109 --> 01:17:29,670
You were wasted.

1040
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:32,270
You're always wasted.

1041
01:17:32,279 --> 01:17:35,479
That's all I can tell you.

1042
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:37,010
Whoa, take it easy.

1043
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:41,850
I need you to tell me
the fucking truth.

1044
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:43,750
What did you see that night?

1045
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,489
What happened that night?

1046
01:17:47,489 --> 01:17:49,920
Uh... I don't know.

1047
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,729
I'm assuming it's the worst.

1048
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,770
God.

1049
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:05,539
Come here for one second.

1050
01:18:05,539 --> 01:18:07,310
Just one second.

1051
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:09,109
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."

1052
01:18:09,109 --> 01:18:11,479
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

1053
01:18:11,489 --> 01:18:14,010
I wonder if she knows
that I fucked tom on the...

1054
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:18,850
When I saw that woman

1055
01:18:18,859 --> 01:18:21,859
kissing someone else,
betraying her husband,

1056
01:18:21,859 --> 01:18:24,319
<i>I felt it.</i>

1057
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:26,229
<i>Pure rage.</i>

1058
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:29,130
<i>If I could, I'd go to her house,</i>

1059
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:31,060
<i>-I'd find her sitting and...</i>

1060
01:18:32,739 --> 01:18:34,039
<i>I'd smash her head</i>

1061
01:18:34,039 --> 01:18:37,279
all over the floor!

1062
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,750
<i>Cathy,</i>

1063
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:51,920
<i>thank you for all
you have done for me.</i>

1064
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:53,689
<i>I'm sorry to leave this way.</i>

1065
01:18:53,689 --> 01:18:55,689
<i>I'll send for my things later.</i>

1066
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:57,090
<i>Love, Rachel.</i>

1067
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:21,550
That's so true.

1068
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:23,619
It's the worst restaurant ever.

1069
01:19:23,619 --> 01:19:25,680
Why do we keep going back?

1070
01:19:25,689 --> 01:19:27,350
Martha.

1071
01:19:28,859 --> 01:19:29,859
Martha.

1072
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:33,729
Rachel?

1073
01:19:33,729 --> 01:19:35,729
Wow, I haven't seen you
in a million years.

1074
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,859
Um...

1075
01:19:37,869 --> 01:19:39,800
Yeah, I-I wanted to call you,

1076
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,770
um, but tom said I should
just leave it alone.

1077
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:44,470
- Oh.
- Um...

1078
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:47,479
I'm so sorry.

1079
01:19:47,479 --> 01:19:48,779
For what?

1080
01:19:48,779 --> 01:19:51,109
For the barbecue.

1081
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,449
And I just need you to know

1082
01:19:53,449 --> 01:19:56,380
that I-I don't remember
anything and, um,

1083
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:58,090
I just completely blacked out.

1084
01:19:58,090 --> 01:19:59,760
Everyone had a little
too much to drink,

1085
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,300
- so it's okay.
- I know, but, uh,

1086
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:04,090
with the eggs
and then I-I screamed at you.

1087
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:07,399
That I was that abusive,
I just feel...

1088
01:20:07,399 --> 01:20:10,329
I just feel so ashamed about it.

1089
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:11,569
Um...

1090
01:20:11,569 --> 01:20:14,239
I don't...

1091
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:18,079
Tom... tom said that, um...

1092
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:19,810
That I smashed your plate.

1093
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:21,239
I don't...

1094
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:24,020
Tom was fired...
Fired because of how I behaved.

1095
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:29,289
You felt sick and you took
a nap in our guest bedroom.

1096
01:20:29,289 --> 01:20:30,989
<i>You want to lie down?</i>

1097
01:20:30,989 --> 01:20:32,989
- Come with me.
- Okay.

1098
01:20:35,329 --> 01:20:36,630
Excuse us.

1099
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:38,699
Rachel, are you feeling better?

1100
01:20:38,699 --> 01:20:40,840
You guys can
stay tonight if you want.

1101
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,460
- No, no. That's fine, thanks.
- Okay.

1102
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:43,869
<i>I think I'd remember</i>

1103
01:20:43,869 --> 01:20:45,770
<i>if you caused a scene.</i>

1104
01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:47,829
I'm so sorry.

1105
01:20:49,869 --> 01:20:51,000
Get up.

1106
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:56,470
And then tom took you home.

1107
01:20:56,479 --> 01:20:58,840
- Sorry, tom...
- Stop fucking saying that!

1108
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:00,880
- I know you're sorry!
- Sorry.

1109
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:02,689
What's your fucking problem?
Can't even focus on me.

1110
01:21:02,689 --> 01:21:04,859
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?

1111
01:21:04,859 --> 01:21:05,859
Can you stand?

1112
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,199
Fucking disgusting.

1113
01:21:11,829 --> 01:21:12,859
<i>N-no.</i>

1114
01:21:12,859 --> 01:21:14,659
No.

1115
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:16,300
Yeah, tom got fired

1116
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:17,960
'cause he couldn't keep
his dick in his pants.

1117
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:20,170
You did nothing wrong.

1118
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:21,600
Nothing.

1119
01:21:29,979 --> 01:21:31,210
<i>Wake the fuck up, Rachel.</i>

1120
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,380
<i>Wake the fuck up!</i>

1121
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:33,949
- Wake up!

1122
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,720
You can sleep out here.

1123
01:21:42,729 --> 01:21:44,699
<i>We all felt so bad for you.</i>

1124
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:47,359
He's such a bad guy.

1125
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:49,369
Oh, god.

1126
01:21:49,369 --> 01:21:51,239
Are you okay?

1127
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:20,439
Hmm.

1128
01:22:57,770 --> 01:22:59,640
<i>I need to see you.</i>

1129
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,239
<i>Meet me at 3:00.</i>

1130
01:23:01,239 --> 01:23:04,069
<i>I'm here. Where are you?</i>

1131
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:06,310
<i>I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.</i>

1132
01:23:17,649 --> 01:23:20,619
What are you doing up?

1133
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:24,000
Picking up after Evie.

1134
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,239
You whore!

1135
01:24:02,699 --> 01:24:04,539
Leave us alone.

1136
01:24:40,439 --> 01:24:42,569
No new messages.

1137
01:24:42,569 --> 01:24:44,170
No saved messages.

- Leave a message.

1146
01:25:11,970 --> 01:25:14,739
You okay?

1147
01:25:14,739 --> 01:25:17,069
I thought I heard something.

1148
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:19,109
You should wake me up
if you heard something.

1149
01:25:19,109 --> 01:25:20,770
I just, I...

1150
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:25,390
Well, come back to bed.

1151
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:15,840
Whore!

1152
01:26:26,039 --> 01:26:27,510
Rachel's down there.

1153
01:26:35,489 --> 01:26:37,689
What the hell are you doing?

1154
01:26:37,689 --> 01:26:38,789
Come here.

1155
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,350
Hey, get the fuck
out of here, okay?

1156
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:45,020
Get the fuck out of here!

1157
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:46,550
You're okay.
Just need some help.

1158
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,760
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

1159
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,260
Just need to get
a little help up.

1160
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:51,289
- Just fuck off. Fuck off!
- Come on. Come on.

1161
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:27,569
You're heavy. Aw.

1162
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:36,439
Come here.

1163
01:28:36,439 --> 01:28:37,670
Anna?

1164
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,279
No.

1165
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:41,079
- Anna, please, please?
- No, go away.

1166
01:28:41,079 --> 01:28:42,250
- There's... okay.
- Go!

1167
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:44,010
I'm-I'm gonna stand right here.

1168
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:45,649
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.

1169
01:28:45,649 --> 01:28:47,649
I don't want to hear
anything you have to say.

1170
01:28:47,649 --> 01:28:49,079
Where's tom?

1171
01:28:57,289 --> 01:28:59,420
He's lying to you.

1172
01:28:59,430 --> 01:29:01,090
He-he always does.

1173
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:02,500
He's-he's a good liar...

1174
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:05,000
I know he's a good liar.

1175
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,430
We went behind your back
for months.

1176
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:09,340
He's just done it to you.

1177
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:10,699
I know he's cheating.

1178
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:14,770
I know.

1179
01:29:14,779 --> 01:29:17,510
Anna, he-he killed Megan...

1180
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,850
No, we don't,
we don't know that.

1181
01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:21,710
- He's dangerous.
- We don't know anything.

1182
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,689
- Anna, you-you need to leave.
- No. No.

1183
01:29:23,689 --> 01:29:25,619
You need to leave.
You need to take Evie

1184
01:29:25,619 --> 01:29:27,180
- and you need to leave, get out of here.
- No.

1185
01:29:27,189 --> 01:29:29,550
- It's not safe...
- I'm not leaving him.

1186
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:32,560
It's hardly the first time
he's had an affair.

1187
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,989
It's not about the affair.

1188
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,840
And you... you know that
deep down.

1189
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,359
Anna, please,

1190
01:29:38,369 --> 01:29:40,140
- just come with me.
- I'm not leaving him.

1191
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:41,239
Please come with me.

1192
01:29:43,409 --> 01:29:45,810
- Anna, don't, don't...
- Come in the house, honey.

1193
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:47,199
Please.

1194
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:51,979
I saw you, tom.
You motherfucker!

1195
01:29:51,979 --> 01:29:53,640
I saw you, you murderer!

1196
01:29:53,649 --> 01:29:55,579
You fucking murderer!

1197
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:57,729
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!

1198
01:29:57,729 --> 01:29:59,479
I know it!

1199
01:29:59,489 --> 01:30:01,350
Un-fucking-believable!

1200
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:02,689
Now, listen. Listen to me.

1201
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:03,850
Megan got into his car
that night.

1202
01:30:03,859 --> 01:30:05,319
You think I don't remember.

1203
01:30:05,329 --> 01:30:06,869
You thought I blacked out!
I saw you.

1204
01:30:06,869 --> 01:30:08,359
Why did Megan get in your car?

1205
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:10,270
- Did Megan get in your car?
- No!

1206
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:12,340
Yes, she did.

1207
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,399
Tell her the truth.

1208
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,210
Just tell her
the truth right now.

1209
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:18,750
You attacked me in that tunnel
because I saw her with you.

1210
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:19,770
I found Megan's phone.

1211
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:28,989
I found it.

1212
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:33,649
So, all those phone calls,
they weren't from Rachel.

1213
01:30:36,789 --> 01:30:41,029
So, were you fucking her
while she was here working?

1214
01:30:41,029 --> 01:30:43,529
While she was looking after
our daughter?

1215
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:48,979
You... you were
so tired all the time.

1216
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:02,119
It's all about Evie.

1217
01:31:02,119 --> 01:31:04,220
That's right.

1218
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:07,380
Your daddy loves you.

1219
01:31:07,390 --> 01:31:08,590
Tom?

1220
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:11,560
- Give her to me.
- That's right.

1221
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:13,220
Your daddy loves you.

1222
01:31:13,229 --> 01:31:16,090
Tom, give her to me, please?

1223
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:18,130
- Please give her to me.
- It's fine.

1224
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,140
I think she needs
changing, please.

1225
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,739
No, she's gonna be fine.

1226
01:31:20,739 --> 01:31:22,810
Please just give her to me.
Oh, okay. Shh, shh.

1227
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:24,579
- Let her go. You're going to hurt her.
- Change her here.

1228
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:25,640
- Change her here.
- You're... okay.

1229
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:26,670
I'll change her. Let her go.

1230
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,750
You're gonna hurt her.

1231
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,649
- Shh.

1232
01:31:29,649 --> 01:31:31,750
You're okay, you're okay.

1233
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:33,520
Shh, shh.

1234
01:31:34,619 --> 01:31:36,159
Shh.

1235
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,250
911, what's your...

1236
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:47,329
What's your emergency?

1237
01:31:58,779 --> 01:32:00,479
No, no. Stay.

1238
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:02,420
Stay.

1239
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:10,649
Do you need a drink?

1240
01:32:10,649 --> 01:32:12,619
No.

1241
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,369
Yeah, you do.

1242
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:35,520
All those things
that you said I did.

1243
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:41,119
Those terrible things...
I didn't do any of them.

1244
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:45,220
You just watched me suffer.

1245
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:47,989
You made me feel so worthless.

1246
01:32:49,529 --> 01:32:52,630
You made me think that
everything was my fault.

1247
01:33:02,039 --> 01:33:04,010
Drink it.

1248
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:13,619
You told me I got you fired.

1249
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:17,189
But I didn't.

1250
01:33:21,619 --> 01:33:23,789
You know, I saw Martha
on the train...

1251
01:33:23,789 --> 01:33:25,390
Drink it!

1252
01:33:32,569 --> 01:33:34,800
I saw Martha on the train.

1253
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:37,470
And she told me
that you were fired

1254
01:33:37,479 --> 01:33:40,680
because you were fucking
everyone in the office!

1255
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:05,270
Rachel's down there.

1256
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:07,640
Wait here.

1257
01:34:42,439 --> 01:34:45,939
You gonna get in the car?

1258
01:34:45,939 --> 01:34:47,470
What's going on?

1259
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:49,949
Don't worry about it.

1260
01:34:49,949 --> 01:34:52,350
Come on.

1261
01:35:11,069 --> 01:35:12,899
Okay, I'm here.

1262
01:35:12,899 --> 01:35:15,300
So, what is it?

1263
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:20,210
I just want to go to the woods.

1264
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:42,630
What is it with you crazy women?

1265
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,050
This what you want?

1266
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:13,159
No.

1267
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,010
Like this?

1268
01:36:23,539 --> 01:36:25,409
What?

1269
01:36:25,409 --> 01:36:28,149
I'm pregnant.

1270
01:36:31,649 --> 01:36:33,689
Congratulations.

1271
01:36:36,119 --> 01:36:38,819
I thought you should know.

1272
01:36:38,819 --> 01:36:40,720
You thought I should know?

1273
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,960
There's a chance
it could be yours.

1274
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,689
Then get an abortion.

1275
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:50,289
Or if it's Scott's,
do whatever you want.

1276
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:53,800
But if it's not,
then get rid of it.

1277
01:36:58,409 --> 01:37:01,680
You can be as involved
as you want.

1278
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:04,449
You were a shitty nanny.

1279
01:37:04,449 --> 01:37:06,449
What makes you think
you're gonna be a good mother?

1280
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:12,020
Why did you bring me there
in the first place?

1281
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:14,989
Because I thought it would be
fun to have you both around.

1282
01:37:18,189 --> 01:37:19,189
Come on.

1283
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,270
I played your game
so you could fuck me

1284
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:26,869
in between Evie's playdates.

1285
01:37:26,869 --> 01:37:29,100
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.

1286
01:37:29,109 --> 01:37:31,750
I took care of your kid
to be near you!

1287
01:37:33,939 --> 01:37:36,640
You fucked Anna 'cause you
couldn't fuck Rachel anymore,

1288
01:37:36,649 --> 01:37:38,689
and you fucked me 'cause
you couldn't fuck Anna!

1289
01:37:38,689 --> 01:37:41,680
Take us all away
and you're just a pathetic,

1290
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:43,119
impotent man!

1291
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:02,800
You're... you're not
gonna get rid of me.

1292
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:06,979
You're gonna pay for this child
for the rest of your life.

1293
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:15,550
I can just... yeah.

1294
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:12,680
You're like a dog.

1295
01:39:14,539 --> 01:39:17,439
Like one of those unwanted,

1296
01:39:17,449 --> 01:39:19,689
mistreated dogs.

1297
01:39:21,819 --> 01:39:23,560
And you can kick them.

1298
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:27,750
They keep coming back to you.

1299
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:30,159
Thinking that somehow
if they're good...

1300
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:32,590
You're not doing this again.

1301
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:35,060
You'll love them.

1302
01:39:35,069 --> 01:39:36,430
This is what you do.

1303
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:39,600
You're not doing this to me.

1304
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,630
You brought this
on yourself, Rachel.

1305
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:47,699
If you had just stayed away
that one night...

1306
01:39:49,909 --> 01:39:53,579
Just left us all alone.

1307
01:39:56,189 --> 01:39:59,359
You brought this on Megan.

1308
01:39:59,359 --> 01:40:01,960
In a way, you killed her.

1309
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:03,399
Mm-hmm.

1310
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:06,920
But I didn't.

1311
01:40:08,699 --> 01:40:10,500
You did.

1312
01:40:21,539 --> 01:40:23,170
No!

1313
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:25,779
No...

1314
01:40:28,649 --> 01:40:31,720
You did this to me
in our marriage.

1315
01:40:33,289 --> 01:40:36,229
You made me fucking crazy.

1316
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,069
Do you have any idea

1317
01:40:43,069 --> 01:40:45,340
what it's like to be
married to a fucking blur?

1318
01:43:33,569 --> 01:43:37,010
I had no choice. He was...

1319
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:40,840
He would've killed me.

1320
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:43,569
I never wanted to hurt him.

1321
01:43:47,850 --> 01:43:49,810
It was self-defense.

1322
01:43:54,359 --> 01:43:57,029
She had no choice.

1323
01:43:57,029 --> 01:43:59,000
Tom would've killed her.

1324
01:44:01,399 --> 01:44:03,399
I saw the whole thing.

1325
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:09,630
Rachel was right about Megan.

1326
01:44:11,739 --> 01:44:13,770
She was right about everything.

1327
01:44:58,890 --> 01:45:00,619
<i>We are tied forever now,</i>

1328
01:45:00,619 --> 01:45:02,020
<i>the three of us.</i>

1329
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:09,489
<i>Bound forever
by the story we share.</i>

1330
01:45:42,829 --> 01:45:45,960
<i>Today I sit in a different car.</i>

1331
01:45:45,970 --> 01:45:48,500
<i>And I look ahead.</i>

1332
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:50,640
<i>Anything is possible,</i>

1333
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:53,899
<i>because I am not the girl
I used to be.</i>
