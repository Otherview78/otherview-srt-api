1
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,699
<i>So you were raised in a zoo?</i>

2
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,076
<i>Born and raised.</i>

3
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:05,704
<i>In Pondicherry, in what was
the French part of India.</i>

4
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,748
<i>My father owned the zoo...</i>

5
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:11,210
<i>and I was delivered on short notice
by a herpetologist...</i>

6
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:14,880
<i>who was there to check
on the Bengal monitor lizard.</i>

7
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,425
<i>Mother and I were both healthy...</i>

8
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,218
<i>but the poor lizard escaped...</i>

9
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:22,430
<i>and was trampled
by a frightened cassowary.</i>

10
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,892
The way of karma.

11
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:29,437
The way of God.

12
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,148
That's quite a story.

13
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,526
I had assumed your father was a
mathematician because of your name.

14
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:38,779
Far from it,
I was named after a swimming pool.

15
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,782
There is a swimming pool named "Pi"?

16
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:47,455
You see, my uncle Francis was born
with too much water in his lungs.

17
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:52,084
They say the doctors swung Francis around
by the ankles to clear the water out...

18
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,920
and that's what gave him
the huge chest and skinny legs...

19
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,381
that made him such a great swimmer.

20
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,886
Is Francis actually your uncle?
He said he was friends with your father.

21
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,055
He's my honorary uncle,
I call him Mamaji.

22
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,975
My father's best friend,
my swimming guru.

23
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,729
<i>I trained with him three times
a week at the ashram.</i>

24
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:14,940
<i>His lessons would
save my life in the end.</i>

25
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:20,112
A mouthful of water will not harm you,
but panic will.

26
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:24,617
Remember to breathe now,
don't hold your breath.

27
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,452
Good boy.

28
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:31,624
I hope you don't mind vegetarian.

29
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,126
No, no. Not at all.

30
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,753
And your name?

31
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,423
You were going to tell me
how you got your name, I think.

32
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,594
Oh, yes. I got it from something
Mamaji once told my father.

33
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:47,181
You see, most travelers collect
postcards or teacups on their journeys...

34
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,349
but not Mamaji.

35
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,601
Mamaji collects swimming pools.

36
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,479
He swims in every pool he comes upon.

37
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:05,449
<i>One day, Mamaji said to my father that,
of all the pools in the world...</i>

38
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,953
<i>the most beautiful was
a public pool in Paris.</i>

39
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,704
<i>That the water there was so clear,</i>

40
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,998
<i>you could make your morning coffee
with it.</i>

41
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,502
<i>That a single swim there changed his life.</i>

42
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,142
<i>Before I was born, he said...</i>

43
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,895
<i>"if you want yours on
to have a clean soul...</i>

44
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:39,483
<i>"you must take him one day
to swim in the Piscine Molitor."</i>

45
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,487
<i>I never understood why my father
took this so much to heart.</i>

46
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:49,159
But he did, and I was named
"Piscine Molitor Patel."

47
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,371
<i>Imagine me trying to explain that name.</i>

48
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,207
<i>I barely made it to the age of 11 before...</i>

49
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,418
Hey, Piscine!

50
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,213
Are you pissing right now?

51
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,382
Look at him, he's pissing!

52
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:07,720
<i>With one word, my name went
from an elegant French swimming pool...</i>

53
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,680
<i>to a stinking Indian latrine.</i>

54
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,682
<i>I was "Pissing" everywhere.</i>

55
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,518
No Pissing in the schoolyard!

56
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,688
<i>Even the teachers started doing it.</i>

57
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,189
<i>Not deliberately, of course.</i>

58
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,235
So, then, what might occur
if we release gas too quickly?

59
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,528
Pissing?

60
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,239
He said "Pissing."

61
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,539
That's enough! Order! Order!

62
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,085
<i>When we returned the next year
for our first day of school, I was prepared.</i>

63
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,545
Present, sir.

64
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:44,131
Piscine Patel.

65
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:53,057
Good morning.
I am Piscine Molitor Patel.

66
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,225
Known to all as...

67
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,730
Pi, the sixteenth letter
of the Greek alphabet...

68
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,567
which is also used in mathematics
to represent the ratio...

69
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:07,237
of any circle's circumference
to its diameter.

70
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:11,659
An irrational number of infinite length,
usually rounded to three digits...

71
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:16,455
as 3.14.

72
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,083
Pi.

73
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:24,588
Very impressive, Pi.
Now, sit down.

74
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,760
<i>And from then on, you were "Pi"?</i>

75
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,471
<i>Well, no, not quite.</i>

76
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,432
Nice try, Pissing.

77
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,686
<i>But I still had the whole day
ahead of me.</i>

78
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,437
<i>French class was next.</i>

79
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:48,320
<i>Then, geography.</i>

80
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:52,116
These are the first
20 decimal places of pi.

81
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,285
<i>My last class of the day
was mathematics.</i>

82
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:59,873
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

83
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:11,301
Three. Seven. Five. Eight. Nine.

84
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:16,140
Eight. Five. Eight. Nine.

85
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,143
It's right. He's really doing this.

86
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,730
Pi! Pi! Pi!

87
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:27,818
<i>By the end of that day,
I was Pi Patel, school legend.</i>

88
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,489
Mamaji tells me you're
a legend among sailors, too.

89
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,866
Out there, all alone.

90
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,201
I don't even know how to sail.

91
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,496
And I wasn't alone out there.
Richard Parker was with me.

92
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,374
Richard Parker?

93
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,042
Mamaji didn't tell me everything.

94
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,045
He just said I should look you up
when I got back to Montreal.

95
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,047
So, what were you doing in Pondicherry?

96
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,342
Writing a novel.

97
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,344
By the way, I enjoyed your first book.

98
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,014
So, this new one, is it set in India?

99
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,684
No, Portugal, actually.
But it's cheaper living in India.

100
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,439
Well, I look forward to reading it.

101
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,565
You can't.

102
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,942
I threw it out.

103
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,861
Two years
trying to bring this thing to life...

104
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:14,948
and then one day,
it sputtered, coughed and died.

105
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,618
I'm sorry.

106
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,956
I was sitting in this coffee house in
Pondicherry one afternoon,

107
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,166
mourning my loss...

108
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:28,086
when this old man at the table next to me
struck up a conversation.

109
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,922
Yeah, Mamaji, he does that.

110
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,924
When I told him about my abandoned book,
he said...

111
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,053
"So, a Canadian who's come to
French India in search of a story.

112
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,264
"Well, my friend, I know an
Indian in French Canada...

113
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,226
"with the most incredible story to tell.

114
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:46,563
"It must be fate
that the two of you should meet."

115
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,111
I haven't spoken about
Richard Parker in so many years.

116
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,906
So, what has Mamaji already told you?

117
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:59,660
He said you had a story
that would make me believe in God.

118
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,247
He would say that about a nice meal.

119
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,251
As for God,
I can only tell you my story.

120
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,088
You will decide for yourself
what you believe.

121
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:12,923
Fair enough.

122
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,009
Let's see, then. Where to begin?

123
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,306
Pondicherry is the French Riviera of India.

124
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,396
<i>In the streets closest to the ocean,</i>

125
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,190
<i>you might think
you were in the south of France.</i>

126
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:35,779
<i>A few blocks inland, there's a canal.</i>

127
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,282
<i>Just beyond that is Indian Pondicherry.</i>

128
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:42,828
<i>And the Muslim quarter
is just to the west.</i>

129
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:46,456
When the French handed Pondicherry
back to us in 1954...

130
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:50,127
the town decided that
some sort of commemoration was in order.

131
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:54,131
<i>My father, who was a clever businessman,
came up with one.</i>

132
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:57,718
<i>He ran a hotel,
and he got the idea to open a zoo...</i>

133
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,679
<i>in the local botanical gardens instead.</i>

134
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:07,019
<i>As it also happened,
my mother was a botanist in the gardens.</i>

135
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:11,899
<i>They met, married, and a year later
my brother Ravi was born.</i>

136
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,234
<i>I came two years after that.</i>

137
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:18,405
It sounds magical, growing up in...

138
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,537
Amen.

139
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,165
Yeah, let's eat.

140
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,167
I didn't know Hindus said "amen."

141
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:31,668
Catholic Hindus do.

142
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:32,920
Catholic Hindus?

143
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:37,007
We get to feel guilty before
hundreds of gods, instead of just one.

144
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,427
But you're a Hindu first?

145
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,555
None of us knows God
until someone introduces us.

146
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,516
I was first introduced to God
as a Hindu.

147
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,269
There are 33 million gods
in the Hindu religion.

148
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,521
How can I not come to know
a few of them?

149
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,276
<i>I met Krishna first.</i>

150
00:12:56,443 --> 00:13:00,238
Yashoda once accused baby Krishna
of eating dirt.

151
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:05,035
"Tut, tut you naughty boy -
you shouldn't do that."

152
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,288
But he didn't!

153
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,874
That's what he told her.

154
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,918
"I didn't eat dirt."

155
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,713
Yashoda said, "No? well then..."

156
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,049
"Open your mouth."

157
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,969
So Krishna opened his mouth.

158
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,096
And what do you think Yashoda saw?

159
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,389
What?

160
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:33,772
She saw in Krishna's mouth
the whole entire universe.

161
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,136
<i>The gods were my superheroes growing up.</i>

162
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,596
<i>Hanuman, the monkey god...</i>

163
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:10,600
<i>lifting an entire mountain
to save his friend Lakshman.</i>

164
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,103
<i>Ganesh, the elephant-headed...</i>

165
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,524
<i>risking his life to defend the honor
of his mother, Parvati.</i>

166
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:22,779
<i>Vishnu, the supreme soul,
the source of all things.</i>

167
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,867
<i>Vishnu sleeps, floating
on the shore less cosmic ocean...</i>

168
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,953
<i>and we are the stuff of his dreaming.</i>

169
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,331
Spectacle.

170
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,794
Don't let these stories
and pretty lights fool you, boys.

171
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:42,049
Religion is darkness.

172
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,846
<i>My dear</i> appa <i>believed
himself part of the new India.</i>

173
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,974
<i>As a child, he had had polio.</i>

174
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:55,353
<i>He used to lie in bed racked with pain,
wondering where God was.</i>

175
00:14:56,188 --> 00:15:00,358
<i>In the end, God didn't save him,
Western medicine did.</i>

176
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,155
<i>My</i> amma <i>went to college...</i>

177
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,158
<i>and thought her family
was part of the new India as well...</i>

178
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,993
<i>until her parents cut her off..</i>

179
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,537
<i>Because they thought
she was marrying beneath her.</i>

180
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,417
<i>Her religion was the only link
she had to her past.</i>

181
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:30,722
<i>I met Christ in the mountains
when I was 12.</i>

182
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,601
<i>We were visiting relatives,
tea growers in Munnar.</i>

183
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:39,022
<i>It was our third day there.
Ravi and I were terribly bored.</i>

184
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:42,109
Challenge. I'll give you two rupees.

185
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,445
Run in to that church
and drink the holy water.

186
00:15:45,445 --> 00:16:15,445
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

187
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,194
You must be thirsty.

188
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,449
Here.

189
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,410
I brought you this.

190
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:51,469
Why would a god do that?

191
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,763
Why would He send His own son...

192
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,309
to suffer for the sins
of ordinary people?

193
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,436
Because He loves us.

194
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:05,609
God made Himself approachable to us,
human, so we could understand Him.

195
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,361
We can't understand God
in all His perfection.

196
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:13,867
But we can understand God's son
and His suffering as we would a brother's.

197
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,328
That made no sense.

198
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:20,957
Sacrificing the innocent
to atone for the sins of the guilty...

199
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,126
What kind of love is that?

200
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,631
<i>But this son...</i>

201
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,299
<i>I couldn't get him out of my head.</i>

202
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:35,472
<i>If God is so perfect and we are not...</i>

203
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,683
why would He want to create all this?

204
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,228
Why does He need us at all?

205
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,522
All you have to know
is that He loves us.

206
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,901
God so loved this world
that He gave His only son.

207
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,028
<i>The longer I listened to the priest...</i>

208
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,198
<i>the more I came to like this son of God.</i>

209
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:57,327
Thank you, Vishnu,
for introducing me to Christ.

210
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:09,506
<i>I came to faith through Hinduism
and I found God's love through Christ.</i>

211
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,175
<i>But God wasn't finished with me yet.</i>

212
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,854
<i>God works in mysterious ways.</i>

213
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,524
<i>And so it was,
He introduced Him self again.</i>

214
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,402
<i>This time by the name of Allah.</i>

215
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,549
<i>My Arabic was never very good...</i>

216
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:56,386
<i>but the sound and feel of the words
brought me closer to God.</i>

217
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:57,762
<i>In performing</i> Salah...

218
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,098
<i>the ground I touched
became holy ground...</i>

219
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:03,727
<i>and I found a feeling
of serenity and brotherhood.</i>

220
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:16,072
This lamb is exquisite.

221
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,783
It's the best dish on the table.

222
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,952
You're all missing out.

223
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,582
You only need to convert
to three more religions, Piscine...

224
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:28,251
and you will spend your life on holiday.

225
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,422
Are you going to Mecca this year,
Swami Jesus?

226
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:35,842
Or to Rome for your coronation
as Pope Pi-us?

227
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,761
You stay out of this, Ravi.

228
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,013
Just as you like cricket,
Pi has his own interests.

229
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,432
No, Gita, Ravi has a point.

230
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:47,145
You cannot follow three different religions
at the same time, Piscine.

231
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,605
Why not?

232
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:52,359
Because believing
in everything at the same time...

233
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,779
is the same as not believing
in anything at all.

234
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,115
He's young, Santosh.
He's still finding his way.

235
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:02,702
And how can he find his way
if he does not choose a path?

236
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:07,832
Listen, instead of leaping
from one religion to the next...

237
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,001
why not start with reason?

238
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,003
In a few hundred years...

239
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,881
science has taken us farther
in understanding the universe...

240
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,801
than religion has in 10,000.

241
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,346
That is true.

242
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:22,806
Your father is right.

243
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:26,518
Science can teach us
more about what is out there...

244
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,478
but not what is in here.

245
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:32,190
Some eat meat, some eat vegetable.

246
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,692
I do not expect us all
to agree about everything...

247
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,530
but I would much rather have you
believe in something I don't agree with...

248
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,491
than to accept everything blindly.

249
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:45,495
And that begins with
thinking rationally.

250
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,665
Do you understand?

251
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,544
Good.

252
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:00,427
I would like to be baptized.

253
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,436
So, you're a Christian and a Muslim?

254
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,020
And a Hindu, of course.

255
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,355
And a Jew, I suppose.

256
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:15,525
Well, I do teach a course on the
Kabbalah at the university.

257
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,361
And why not?
Faith is a house with many rooms.

258
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,113
But no room for doubt?

259
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,948
Plenty. On every floor.

260
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,533
Doubt is useful.

261
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,743
It keeps faith a living thing.

262
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,372
After all, you cannot know the strength
of your faith until it's been tested.

263
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,212
Where's Selvam?
We shouldn't be in here without him.

264
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,881
Stop worrying.

265
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,385
I have seen him do this
a thousand times.

266
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,765
I want to meet our new tiger.

267
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:49,809
Pi!

268
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,562
Hello? Richard Parker?

269
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,940
A tiger?
Richard Parker was a tiger?

270
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,943
Yeah, he got his name
through a clerical error.

271
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,113
A hunter caught him drinking
from a stream when he was a cub...

272
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,073
and named him Thirsty.

273
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,243
When Thirsty got too big,
the hunter sold him to our zoo...

274
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,246
but the names got switched
on the paperwork.

275
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:14,834
The hunter was listed as Thirsty,
and the tiger was called Richard Parker.

276
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,630
We laughed about it, and the name stuck.

277
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,507
Let's go...

278
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,468
before we get into trouble.

279
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,470
I want to see him close up.

280
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,096
You're not a zookeeper.

281
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,098
Come on!

282
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,619
That's it, Richard Parker.

283
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,496
It's for you.

284
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:21,985
No!

285
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,321
What are you thinking?

286
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,156
Are you out of your mind?

287
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,367
Who gave you permission
to come back here?

288
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:32,912
You have just ignored
everything I've ever taught you.

289
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:36,249
I just wanted to say hello to him.

290
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,501
You think that tiger is your friend?

291
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:41,004
He's an animal, not a playmate.

292
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,340
Animals have souls.

293
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,843
I have seen it in their eyes.

294
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,097
Find Selvam.

295
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,777
You're sure, sir? Pi's just a boy.

296
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,863
Do it. Go ahead!

297
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:10,533
Animals do not think like we do.

298
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,536
People who forget that
get themselves killed.

299
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:17,874
That tiger is not your friend.

300
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,542
When you look into his eyes...

301
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:23,129
you are seeing your own emotions
reflected back at you.

302
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,048
Nothing else.

303
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,133
Don't be stupid. Say you're sorry.

304
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,762
What have you done, Piscine?

305
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,222
You know what your father said
about coming back here.

306
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,226
I am sorry. I was...

307
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,145
What are you thinking?

308
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,230
This is between a father and his sons.

309
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,317
He said he's sorry.

310
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,943
You want to scar them for life?

311
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,072
Scar them? That boy almost lost his arm.

312
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,573
But he's still a boy.

313
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,450
He will be a man sooner than you think.

314
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:55,578
And this is a lesson
I do not want them ever to forget.

315
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,747
Selvam!

316
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:48,673
<i>...and so has placed the country
in a state of emergency.</i>

317
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,135
<i>Under the directive,
the states of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu...</i>

318
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,346
<i>will be placed under the direct authority
of the central government.</i>

319
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:57,223
<i>Police will be granted powers...</i>

320
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,519
<i>to arrest and indefinitely detain
citizens responsible for the uprising.</i>

321
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,819
<i>Things changed after the day
of</i> Appa's <i>lesson.</i>

322
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,655
<i>The world had lost
some of its enchantment.</i>

323
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:16,826
<i>School was a bore.
Nothing but facts, fractions and French.</i>

324
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:21,414
<i>Words and patterns that went on and on,
without end.</i>

325
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:24,083
<i>Just like my irrational nickname.</i>

326
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:34,260
<i>I grew restless searching for something
that might bring meaning back into my life.</i>

327
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:38,097
<i>And then, I met Anandi.</i>

328
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,858
<i>Mother made me study music.</i>

329
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:51,444
<i>And one day,
my teacher came down with the flu.</i>

330
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:55,615
<i>He asked if I could take his place,
playing rhythms for a dance class.</i>

331
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,090
No.

332
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,218
If you do not concentrate...

333
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,763
you cannot express
your love of God through dance.

334
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,057
Feel the ground beneath your feet.

335
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:23,726
Open your gaze out onto the horizon.

336
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:28,439
Let that spiritual energy
pulse through you and out into the world.

337
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,566
Through <i>abhinaya.</i>

338
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:33,820
Anandi, come to the front. Lead them.

339
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,616
Why are you following me?

340
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:21,868
What?

341
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:24,662
You were following me.

342
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,125
What does this mean?

343
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,212
In the dance, you went from <i>pataka...</i>

344
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,840
which means the forest.

345
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:38,801
And then you did...

346
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,345
<i>samputa...</i>

347
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:44,181
which means something that is hidden.

348
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,975
And after that, you did this.

349
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,187
And then you did <i>chatura.</i>

350
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,900
But at the very end, you did this.

351
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,320
None of the other dancers did that.

352
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,656
What did you mean?
The god of love is hiding in the forest?

353
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:03,659
No, that also means the lotus flower.

354
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,495
Lotus flower is hiding in the forest?

355
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,416
Why would a lotus flower
hide in the forest?

356
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,426
And this is Richard Parker.

357
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,513
He is the most magnificent creature
we've ever had here.

358
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,683
Look at the way he's turning his head.

359
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:32,897
Showing off. Like a dancer.

360
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:35,358
No, he heard something.

361
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,363
He's listening, you see?

362
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,874
We have talked about it for some time.

363
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,210
Do you understand what I'm saying?

364
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:55,711
Pi?

365
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,714
Sorry, you've been...

366
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,424
Worried.

367
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,385
For my family.

368
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,554
Our animals are worth far more abroad
than here in India.

369
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,723
And if the town council
stops supporting us...

370
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,725
I don't know where we will be.

371
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,269
So, it is what we have to do.

372
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:15,147
Do you understand?

373
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:19,235
I'm sorry, what are we talking about?

374
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,821
We are leaving India.

375
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,657
What?

376
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,244
We are selling the zoo.

377
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:32,123
The zoo was never ours to sell.
The land belongs to the town.

378
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,417
But the animals are ours
and if we sell them...

379
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,669
we will have enough to start a new life.

380
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:40,089
But where would we go?
Our life is here, <i>Appa.</i>

381
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:41,257
Canada.

382
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:44,093
I have some opportunities
for work in Winnipeg.

383
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,263
I'll be shipping most of the animals
for sale in North America.

384
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,974
We can get freighter passage
for the whole family.

385
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,600
So...

386
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,352
It is settled.

387
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,272
We will sail like Columbus.

388
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:59,525
But Columbus
was looking for India.

389
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:10,870
<i>It takes a lot of work to sell a zoo.</i>

390
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,955
<i>Before we left...</i>

391
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:16,792
<i>Anandi and I had time enough
to break each other's hearts.</i>

392
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:20,337
<i>Of course, I promised
I would come back one day.</i>

393
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:22,673
<i>It's funny.</i>

394
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,968
<i>I remember everything else
about our last day.</i>

395
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:29,221
<i>But I don't remember saying goodbye.</i>

396
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:41,192
Pi? They're serving dinner below.

397
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,998
Piscine...

398
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:58,667
you have a whole life ahead of you.

399
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,004
We are doing this for you and Ravi.

400
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,342
Come inside and have some dinner.

401
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:17,728
Vegetarian, please.

402
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:21,899
My sons and I are vegetarians.
Do you have anything--

403
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:25,194
No, no, no. Not more gravy.

404
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:26,904
You don't want gravy?

405
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,282
No, I want something vegetarian.

406
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:41,252
She asked if you have
something vegetarian.

407
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:46,048
The cow that produced this liver
was vegetarian,

408
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:49,135
the pigs that went into these sausages
were vegetarian.

409
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:50,594
Very funny.

410
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,056
But my wife doesn't eat liver.

411
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:02,481
Then she can eat the sausage,
the rice, and the gravy.

412
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:04,984
Or you can cook your own food.

413
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,820
How dare you talk to my wife like that?

414
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,281
Here's your rice.

415
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,076
I cook for sailors...

416
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,744
not curry-eaters.

417
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:17,413
What did you say?!

418
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:18,414
Let go of me!

419
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:22,084
Who do you think you are?
You're nothing but a servant!

420
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:24,795
I feed people! You feed monkeys!

421
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:34,930
Hello.

422
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,640
I am happy Buddhist.

423
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:40,603
So, I eat rice next to gravy.

424
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:44,315
On ship, gravy is not meat.

425
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,649
Is taste.

426
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,693
You try?

427
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,384
Don't worry.

428
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:17,806
We will have plenty of fresh supplies
after we stop in Manila.

429
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:23,145
Why give Orange Juice tranquilizers?

430
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:26,232
She's not going to cause any trouble.

431
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,360
The stress of traveling
is not good for the animals...

432
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,321
and it helps with the seasickness.

433
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:39,662
We don't want to be cleaning up
after a seasick orangutan...

434
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,497
do we?

435
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,549
<i>My father was a businessman.
He had never tended the animals himself</i>

436
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:55,427
I realized...

437
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,556
leaving India must have been
harder for him than it was for me.

438
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,772
So...

439
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:09,400
Have I forgotten anything?

440
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:10,693
I think you've set the stage.

441
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,238
So far, we have an Indian boy
named after a French swimming pool...

442
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:17,700
on a Japanese ship full of animals,
heading to Canada.

443
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,118
Yes.

444
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:23,038
Now, we have to send our boy
into the middle of the Pacific and--

445
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:26,292
And make me believe in God.

446
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,086
Yeah.

447
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:31,130
We'll get there.

448
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,762
It was four days out of Manila...

449
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:42,057
above the Mariana Trench,
the deepest spot on Earth.

450
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:51,817
<i>Our ship,</i> The Tsimtsum, <i>pushed on,
bullishly indifferent to its surroundings.</i>

451
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:57,156
<i>It moved with the slow,
massive confidence of a continent.</i>

452
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:34,818
Ravi?

453
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:36,945
Did you hear that, Ravi?

454
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,322
I'm sleeping.

455
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:40,491
It's a thunderstorm. Let's go watch.

456
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:41,950
Are you crazy?

457
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,203
We will get hit by lightning.

458
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:47,289
No, we won't.
It will hit the bridge first.

459
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:51,168
Don't tempt a storm, Pi.

460
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:58,944
More rain! More rain!

461
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,949
Lord of Storms!

462
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:07,995
Lightning!

463
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:49,077
<i>Amma!</i>

464
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:51,497
<i>Appa!</i>

465
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,793
Ravi! Get out! Get out!

466
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,416
Help me!

467
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,965
Help!

468
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,468
Get in the boat!

469
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:48,637
Please! Save my family!

470
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:50,597
Don't scare, okay? Wait, stay here!

471
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,349
You have to help them! Please!

472
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:53,809
Put this on.

473
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:56,395
No, no, my family! Please!

474
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,148
We have to help them!

475
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:02,609
- We don't have time.
- My family's back there!

476
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:05,028
We help! You must go!

477
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,363
Who let all the animals out?

478
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,781
You have to go now!

479
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:10,242
No, wait, my father! He can't swim!

480
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,368
Go!

481
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:17,249
Hang on to the boat! Hold, hold!

482
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,085
Bring it down!

483
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:31,013
Hey! You! What are you doing?

484
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,682
Jump!

485
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,059
Hey, hey!

486
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:43,460
Hey! Over here! Over here!

487
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,830
Richard Parker?

488
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,665
No! No!

489
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:25,752
No! Go away! Go away!

490
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,717
<i>Amma!</i>

491
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:41,847
<i>Appa!</i> Ravi.

492
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,226
I'm sorry.

493
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:51,857
I'm sorry!

494
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,294
Hari?

495
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:14,833
Looks as though
your drugs haven't worn off yet.

496
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:33,852
Orange Juice! Orange Juice!

497
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,367
Welcome to Pi's Ark.

498
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:16,478
Where is your boy, Orange Juice?

499
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:30,909
Don't worry,
I bet mother and father found him.

500
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:36,873
They'll all be here soon.

501
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:47,217
Hello!

502
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:53,014
Hello!

503
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:58,103
Anybody!

504
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,584
No!

505
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:07,964
Stop it! No!
Stop it! Stop it!

506
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:15,388
No! No!

507
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:02,560
I'm sorry, Orange Juice.

508
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:05,897
I don't have any
seasickness medicine for you.

509
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:10,109
Supplies. Supplies!

510
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:20,096
Yes! Yes!

511
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,733
No! No!

512
00:52:54,756 --> 00:52:57,133
Come on! Come on!

513
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,211
<i>My name is Pi Patel.</i>

514
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:47,214
<i>I have been in a shipwreck.</i>

515
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:50,551
<i>I am on a lifeboat alone...</i>

516
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,055
<i>with a tiger.</i>

517
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:58,059
<i>Please send help.</i>

518
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:49,879
God, I give myself to you.

519
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:52,923
I am your vessel.

520
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:58,554
Whatever comes, I want to know.

521
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,349
Show me.

522
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:14,737
There are no lines.

523
01:00:18,783 --> 01:00:23,037
<i>Set your house in order
and dig in for the battle to survive.</i>

524
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:28,375
<i>Establish a strict schedule for eating,
keeping watch and getting rest.</i>

525
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:32,296
<i>Do not drink urine or sea water.</i>

526
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:38,385
<i>Keep busy
but avoid unnecessary exertion.</i>

527
01:00:41,055 --> 01:00:43,724
<i>The mind can be kept occupied
by playing card games...</i>

528
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:47,228
<i>Twenty Questions, or I Spy.</i>

529
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:54,068
<i>Community singing is another
surefire way to lift the spirits.</i>

530
01:00:56,779 --> 01:00:59,824
<i>Telling stories is highly recommended.</i>

531
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:06,956
<i>Above all, don't lose hope.</i>

532
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:19,176
<i>Few things can sap the spirit faster
than seasickness.</i>

533
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:25,182
<i>Waves are most strongly felt
when a boat turns sideways to the current.</i>

534
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:29,979
<i>A sea anchor is used as a drag
to keep the boat's head to the wind.</i>

535
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:35,609
<i>Proper use of them can increase control
and reduce seasickness during rough seas.</i>

536
01:01:36,944 --> 01:01:39,738
<i>For cast a ways who must share their
lifeboats with large,</i>

537
01:01:39,822 --> 01:01:41,198
<i>dangerous carnivores...</i>

538
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:44,660
<i>it's advisable to establish
a territory as your own.</i>

539
01:01:44,827 --> 01:01:46,328
<i>Try this method.</i>

540
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:47,580
<i>Step one.</i>

541
01:01:47,663 --> 01:01:50,791
<i>Choose a day when
waves are moderate, but regular.</i>

542
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:54,169
<i>Step two.
With the lifeboat facing into the waves...</i>

543
01:01:54,295 --> 01:01:58,799
<i>making the ride as comfortable as possible,
blow your whistle soothingly.</i>

544
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:02,511
<i>Step three.
Turn the lifeboat sideways to the waves...</i>

545
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:05,848
<i>accompanied by harsh,
aggressive use of the whistle.</i>

546
01:02:06,015 --> 01:02:07,641
<i>With sufficient repetition...</i>

547
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:09,935
<i>the animal will associate
the sound of the whistle...</i>

548
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:12,563
<i>with the discomfort of sea sickness.</i>

549
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,400
<i>Similar methods have long
been used by circus trainers...</i>

550
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:19,653
<i>though they generally lack
access to rough seas.</i>

551
01:02:20,029 --> 01:02:22,823
Let the trumpets blare!

552
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:26,744
Let the drum rolls begin!

553
01:02:27,328 --> 01:02:30,164
Prepare to be amazed!

554
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:34,543
Here it is,
for your enjoyment and instruction!

555
01:02:35,169 --> 01:02:39,506
The show you've been waiting for
all your life...

556
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:42,676
will soon begin!

557
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,263
Are you ready for the miracle of it?

558
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:50,434
Well, then, I give to you...

559
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:55,022
the astounding Bengal tiger!

560
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:10,371
Hello, Richard Parker.
Sorry about the choppy ride.

561
01:03:44,405 --> 01:03:49,284
Mine! You understand? Yours, mine!

562
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,415
You understand?

563
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:08,095
<i>Step four.</i>

564
01:04:08,262 --> 01:04:11,849
<i>Disregard steps one through three.</i>

565
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:43,964
Here, Richard Parker.
I got some water for you.

566
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:02,316
<i>In the zoo, we fed our tigers
an average of five kilos of meat a day.</i>

567
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,028
<i>Richard Parker will be
getting hungry soon.</i>

568
01:05:08,072 --> 01:05:11,575
<i>Tigers are powerful swimmers,
and if he gets hungry enough...</i>

569
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:15,871
<i>I'm afraid the little bit of water
between us won't be any protection.</i>

570
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:18,540
<i>I need to find a way to feed him.</i>

571
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:22,252
<i>I can eat the biscuits
but God made tigers carnivores...</i>

572
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:24,505
<i>so I must learn to catch fish.</i>

573
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:29,676
<i>If I don't, I'm afraid his last meal
will be a skinny, vegetarian boy.</i>

574
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,563
Patience!

575
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:49,650
What am I doing?

576
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:10,212
Wait! I'm thinking.

577
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:42,804
Thirty-two cartons of biscuits.

578
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:47,601
Ninety-three cans of water.

579
01:10:59,548 --> 01:11:01,341
I'm sorry.

580
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:05,679
I'm sorry.

581
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:10,600
Thank you, Lord Vishnu.

582
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:14,896
Thank you for coming in the form of a fish
and saving our lives.

583
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:17,691
Thank you.

584
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:28,405
<i>Of course, I brought all the biscuits
and water</i>

585
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:31,074
<i>on the raft with me to keep them safe.</i>

586
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:33,493
<i>Idiot.</i>

587
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:41,167
<i>Hunger can change everything you
ever thought you knew about yourself</i>

588
01:14:30,592 --> 01:14:32,761
Here, it's yours!

589
01:15:41,705 --> 01:15:43,164
Mine! Mine!

590
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:53,693
<i>I can't risk my life every time I have
to climb onto the boat for supplies.</i>

591
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:56,029
<i>It's time to settle this.</i>

592
01:16:56,279 --> 01:17:00,700
<i>If we're going to live together,
we have to learn to communicate.</i>

593
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:06,539
<i>Maybe Richard Parker can't be tamed,
but with God's will, he can be trained.</i>

594
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:17,360
No!

595
01:18:25,994 --> 01:18:27,787
Good.

596
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:49,953
Go, Richard Parker. Go.

597
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:52,914
Go on home, I'll leave you alone.

598
01:19:53,081 --> 01:19:56,042
I'll respect that, I promise.

599
01:20:00,213 --> 01:20:02,715
Go. Come on.

600
01:20:11,099 --> 01:20:12,725
Yes!

601
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:51,806
<i>I never thought a small piece of shade
could bring me so much happiness.</i>

602
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:57,270
<i>That a pile of tools,
a bucket, a knife, a pencil...</i>

603
01:20:57,437 --> 01:20:59,480
<i>might become my greatest treasures.</i>

604
01:20:59,814 --> 01:21:03,776
<i>Or that knowing Richard Parker
was here might ever bring me peace.</i>

605
01:21:04,819 --> 01:21:06,279
<i>In times like these...</i>

606
01:21:06,446 --> 01:21:11,325
<i>I remember that he has as little
experience with the real world as I do.</i>

607
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:14,829
<i>We were both raised in a zoo
by the same master.</i>

608
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:19,959
<i>Now we've been orphaned,
left to face our ultimate master together.</i>

609
01:21:20,126 --> 01:21:23,671
<i>Without Richard Parker,
I would have died by now.</i>

610
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:26,174
<i>My fear of him keeps me alert.</i>

611
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,635
<i>Tending to his needs
gives my life purpose.</i>

612
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,059
Dolphins.

613
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:38,352
Hey, Richard Parker!

614
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,413
Hey!

615
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:53,719
<i>Above all, don't lose hope.</i>

616
01:23:25,585 --> 01:23:29,630
Eight, five, five,
zero, three, six, six...

617
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:32,300
zero, eight, zero, one...

618
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:37,263
three, six, zero, four,
six, six, eight...

619
01:23:45,104 --> 01:23:47,481
What are you looking at?

620
01:23:52,278 --> 01:23:54,030
Talk to me.

621
01:23:57,658 --> 01:23:59,869
Tell me what you see.

622
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:10,082
<i>Words are all I have left to hang on to.</i>

623
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:14,003
<i>Everything mixed up. Fragmented.</i>

624
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:19,759
<i>Can't tell daydreams, night dreams,
from reality anymo--...</i>

625
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,945
Storm, Richard Parker.

626
01:27:07,473 --> 01:27:08,808
No!

627
01:27:14,188 --> 01:27:15,564
No!

628
01:27:40,214 --> 01:27:42,383
Praise be to God!

629
01:27:43,092 --> 01:27:45,052
Lord of all worlds!

630
01:27:45,219 --> 01:27:48,848
The compassionate, the merciful!

631
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:57,189
Come out.

632
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:02,862
Richard Parker!
Come out, you have to see this!

633
01:28:03,863 --> 01:28:05,865
It's beautiful!

634
01:28:16,876 --> 01:28:21,046
Don't hide yourself! He's come to us!

635
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:22,882
It's a miracle!

636
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:40,065
Come out and see God, Richard Parker!

637
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:56,081
Why are you scaring him?

638
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:57,249
Oh, God!

639
01:28:57,416 --> 01:29:02,087
I've lost my family!
I've lost everything!

640
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:06,675
I surrender! What more do you want?

641
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:32,326
I'm sorry, Richard Parker.

642
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:42,933
We're dying, Richard Parker.

643
01:32:46,645 --> 01:32:49,148
I'm sorry.

644
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:25,851
<i>Amma, Appa,</i> Ravi...

645
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:31,190
I'm happy I'm going to see you soon.

646
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:42,993
Can you feel the rain?

647
01:34:01,512 --> 01:34:06,391
God, thank you for giving me my life.

648
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,562
I'm ready now.

649
01:34:41,677 --> 01:34:43,762
Richard Parker?

650
01:36:22,027 --> 01:36:24,196
Excuse me.

651
01:36:24,947 --> 01:36:26,657
Move.

652
01:36:27,366 --> 01:36:29,868
Move. Excuse me.

653
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:44,461
Hey! Hey!

654
01:38:45,337 --> 01:38:46,838
Hey, come on!

655
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:55,263
Hey, get away. This is my bed.

656
01:41:03,475 --> 01:41:05,894
<i>It was a human tooth?</i>

657
01:41:06,061 --> 01:41:09,147
Don't you see?
The island was carnivorous.

658
01:41:09,314 --> 01:41:12,150
Carnivorous? Like a Venus Flytrap?

659
01:41:12,317 --> 01:41:15,153
Yes, the whole island.

660
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:19,783
The plants, the water in those pools,
the very ground itself.

661
01:41:20,492 --> 01:41:23,453
During the day,
those pools held fresh water.

662
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:28,833
But at night, some chemical process
turned the water in those pools into acid...

663
01:41:29,793 --> 01:41:32,003
acid that dissolved those fish...

664
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:34,673
that sent the meerkats
scurrying into the trees,

665
01:41:34,756 --> 01:41:36,967
and Richard Parker running to the boat.

666
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:39,135
But where did the tooth come from?

667
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:42,097
Years ago, some poor fellow,
just like me...

668
01:41:42,264 --> 01:41:45,016
must have found himself
stranded on that island...

669
01:41:45,183 --> 01:41:48,520
and, like me,
thought he might stay there forever.

670
01:41:48,687 --> 01:41:53,525
But all that the island gave him by day,
it took away again by night.

671
01:41:55,026 --> 01:42:00,198
To think, how many hours spent
with only meerkats for company.

672
01:42:00,365 --> 01:42:02,784
How much loneliness taken on.

673
01:42:03,159 --> 01:42:07,455
All I know is that eventually he died
and the island digested him...

674
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:10,375
leaving behind only his teeth.

675
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:15,171
I saw how my life would end
if I stayed on that island.

676
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:17,048
Alone and forgotten.

677
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:22,554
I had to get back to the world,
or die trying.

678
01:42:26,391 --> 01:42:29,185
<i>I spent the next day preparing the boat.</i>

679
01:42:29,352 --> 01:42:31,396
<i>I filled my stores with fresh water...</i>

680
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:34,232
<i>ate seaweed until my stomach
could take no more...</i>

681
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:36,735
<i>and brought as many meerkats
as I could fit</i>

682
01:42:36,818 --> 01:42:39,904
<i>into the storage locker for Richard Parker.</i>

683
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:43,158
<i>I couldn't leave without him, of course.</i>

684
01:42:43,325 --> 01:42:45,160
<i>It would mean killing him.</i>

685
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:49,914
<i>And so, I waited for his return.</i>

686
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,918
<i>I knew he wouldn't be late.</i>

687
01:42:54,085 --> 01:42:57,589
Richard Parker!

688
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:12,437
<i>No one has seen that floating island since.</i>

689
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:15,899
<i>And you won't read about
those trees in any nature book.</i>

690
01:43:16,066 --> 01:43:20,111
<i>And yet, if I hadn't found those shores,
I would have died.</i>

691
01:43:20,278 --> 01:43:25,784
<i>If I hadn't discovered that tooth,
I would have been lost, alone forever.</i>

692
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:28,453
<i>Even when God seemed
to have abandoned me...</i>

693
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:30,121
<i>He was watching.</i>

694
01:43:30,288 --> 01:43:33,083
<i>Even when He seemed
indifferent to my suffering...</i>

695
01:43:33,249 --> 01:43:34,709
<i>He was watching.</i>

696
01:43:34,876 --> 01:43:38,713
<i>And when I was beyond all hope of saving,
He gave me rest...</i>

697
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,966
<i>then gave me a sign
to continue my journey.</i>

698
01:43:54,813 --> 01:44:00,235
<i>By the time we reached the Mexican shore,
I was afraid to let go of the boat.</i>

699
01:44:00,777 --> 01:44:04,155
<i>My strength was gone. I was so weak.</i>

700
01:44:04,322 --> 01:44:08,118
<i>I was afraid that in two feet of water,
so close to deliverance...</i>

701
01:44:08,284 --> 01:44:10,328
<i>I would drown.</i>

702
01:44:19,587 --> 01:44:23,591
<i>I struggled to shore
and fell upon the sand.</i>

703
01:44:23,758 --> 01:44:25,510
<i>It was warm and soft...</i>

704
01:44:25,677 --> 01:44:28,972
<i>like pressing my face
against the cheek of God.</i>

705
01:44:29,848 --> 01:44:34,352
<i>And somewhere,
two eyes were smiling at having me there.</i>

706
01:44:38,356 --> 01:44:42,110
<i>I was so spent, I could hardly move.</i>

707
01:44:48,116 --> 01:44:51,286
<i>And so, Richard Parker went ahead of me.</i>

708
01:44:52,662 --> 01:44:56,708
<i>He stretched his legs
and walked along the shore.</i>

709
01:45:00,462 --> 01:45:03,715
<i>At the edge of the jungle, he stopped.</i>

710
01:45:03,882 --> 01:45:06,342
<i>I was certain he was
going to look back at me...</i>

711
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:09,721
<i>flatten his ears to his head, growl.</i>

712
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:13,975
<i>That he would bring our relationship
to an end in some way.</i>

713
01:45:15,894 --> 01:45:19,063
<i>But he just stared ahead
into the jungle.</i>

714
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:25,236
And then, Richard Parker,
my fierce companion...

715
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:28,072
the terrible one who kept me alive...

716
01:45:30,867 --> 01:45:34,496
disappeared forever from my life.

717
01:45:40,502 --> 01:45:44,005
<i>After a few hours,
a member of my own species found me.</i>

718
01:45:44,506 --> 01:45:47,592
<i>He left and returned with a group
who carried me away.</i>

719
01:45:49,761 --> 01:45:52,055
<i>I wept like a child.</i>

720
01:45:52,222 --> 01:45:56,559
<i>Not because I was overwhelmed
at having survived, although I was.</i>

721
01:45:57,435 --> 01:46:03,608
<i>I was weeping because Richard Parker
left me so unceremoniously.</i>

722
01:46:05,068 --> 01:46:07,612
<i>It broke my heart.</i>

723
01:46:13,076 --> 01:46:15,954
You know, my father was right.

724
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,873
Richard Parker never saw me as his friend.

725
01:46:19,457 --> 01:46:23,378
After all we had been through,
he didn't even look back.

726
01:46:24,546 --> 01:46:26,422
But I have to believe there
was more in his eyes...

727
01:46:26,589 --> 01:46:29,592
than my own reflection staring back at me.

728
01:46:29,759 --> 01:46:32,053
I know it. I felt it.

729
01:46:32,929 --> 01:46:35,139
Even if I can't prove it.

730
01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:41,938
You know, I've left so much behind.

731
01:46:42,105 --> 01:46:45,483
My family, the zoo, India, Anandi.

732
01:46:45,817 --> 01:46:49,904
I suppose, in the end, the whole of life
becomes an act of letting go.

733
01:46:50,655 --> 01:46:53,491
But what always hurts the most...

734
01:46:53,658 --> 01:46:57,287
is not taking a moment to say goodbye.

735
01:46:58,997 --> 01:47:03,167
I was never able to thank my father
for all I learned from him.

736
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:06,337
To tell him, without his lessons...

737
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,173
I would never have survived.

738
01:47:11,301 --> 01:47:14,971
I know Richard Parker is a tiger,
but I wish I had said...

739
01:47:15,138 --> 01:47:17,807
"It's over. We survived.

740
01:47:17,974 --> 01:47:21,769
"Thank you for saving my life.
I love you, Richard Parker.

741
01:47:21,936 --> 01:47:24,647
"You will always be with me.

742
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:28,526
"May God be with you."

743
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:38,036
I don't know what to say.

744
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:46,961
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

745
01:47:49,964 --> 01:47:52,175
It is a lot to take in.

746
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:55,303
To figure out what it all means.

747
01:47:55,470 --> 01:47:59,307
If it happened, it happened.
Why should it have to mean anything?

748
01:48:00,850 --> 01:48:03,811
Some of it is pretty incredible.

749
01:48:03,978 --> 01:48:06,314
See, I was the only one
who survived the shipwreck.

750
01:48:06,898 --> 01:48:10,068
So the Japanese shipping company
sent two men to talk to me...

751
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:13,071
in the Mexican hospital
where I was recovering.

752
01:48:15,156 --> 01:48:17,075
I still have a copy of their report.

753
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:22,330
They had insurance claims to settle...

754
01:48:22,497 --> 01:48:25,416
and they wanted to find out
why the ship sank.

755
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:27,877
They didn't believe me, either.

756
01:48:31,172 --> 01:48:34,842
Thousands of meerkats
on a floating carnivorous island...

757
01:48:35,009 --> 01:48:36,928
and no one has ever seen it?

758
01:48:37,095 --> 01:48:39,889
Yes, just like I told you.

759
01:48:40,056 --> 01:48:41,766
Bananas don't float.

760
01:48:41,933 --> 01:48:43,434
Why are you talking about bananas?

761
01:48:43,601 --> 01:48:46,270
You said the orangutan
floated to you on a bundle of bananas.

762
01:48:46,437 --> 01:48:48,272
But bananas don't float.

763
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:49,774
Are you sure about that?

764
01:48:49,941 --> 01:48:52,443
Of course they do.
Try it for yourself.

765
01:48:53,403 --> 01:48:57,573
In any case, we are not here
to talk about bananas or meerkats.

766
01:48:57,740 --> 01:49:01,077
Look, I've just told you a long story
and I'm very tired.

767
01:49:01,244 --> 01:49:06,124
We are here because a Japanese
cargo ship sank in the Pacific.

768
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:08,751
Something I never forget.

769
01:49:09,919 --> 01:49:12,380
I lost my whole family.

770
01:49:17,135 --> 01:49:18,803
Get him some water.

771
01:49:21,264 --> 01:49:23,474
We don't mean to push you.

772
01:49:24,559 --> 01:49:27,437
And you have our deepest sympathies.

773
01:49:27,603 --> 01:49:29,605
But we have come a long way...

774
01:49:29,772 --> 01:49:32,942
and we are no closer
to understanding why the ship sank.

775
01:49:33,109 --> 01:49:35,236
Because I don't know.

776
01:49:35,403 --> 01:49:36,946
I was asleep. Something woke me up.

777
01:49:37,113 --> 01:49:39,657
It could have been an explosion,
I can't be sure.

778
01:49:39,824 --> 01:49:41,743
And then the ship sank.

779
01:49:42,285 --> 01:49:43,953
What else do you want from me?

780
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:46,414
A story that won't make us
look like fools.

781
01:49:46,581 --> 01:49:49,584
We need a simpler story for our report.

782
01:49:49,751 --> 01:49:51,919
One our company can understand.

783
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:54,672
A story we can all believe.

784
01:49:57,508 --> 01:50:00,511
So, a story without things
you've never seen before.

785
01:50:01,012 --> 01:50:02,346
That's right.

786
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:06,684
Without surprises.
Without animals or islands.

787
01:50:06,851 --> 01:50:09,520
Yes. The truth.

788
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:20,865
So, what did you do?

789
01:50:25,036 --> 01:50:27,371
I told them another story.

790
01:50:28,206 --> 01:50:29,373
Four of us survived.

791
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:32,794
The cook and the sailor
were already aboard.

792
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:34,921
The cook threw me a lifebuoy
and pulled me aboard...

793
01:50:35,087 --> 01:50:38,633
and Mother held on to some bananas
and made it to the lifeboat.

794
01:50:40,218 --> 01:50:43,221
The cook was a disgusting man.

795
01:50:43,387 --> 01:50:45,598
He ate a rat.

796
01:50:45,765 --> 01:50:48,893
We had food enough for weeks,
but he found the rat in the first few days...

797
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:52,730
and he killed it,
dried it in the sun and ate it.

798
01:50:52,897 --> 01:50:55,107
He was such a brute, that man.

799
01:50:56,901 --> 01:50:59,237
But he was resourceful.

800
01:50:59,946 --> 01:51:03,574
It was his idea to build
the raft to catch fish.

801
01:51:03,741 --> 01:51:06,953
We would have died in those
first few days without him.

802
01:51:09,247 --> 01:51:13,751
The sailor was the same man who
brought rice and gravy, the Buddhist.

803
01:51:13,918 --> 01:51:17,296
We didn't understand much of
what he said, only that he was suffering.

804
01:51:17,755 --> 01:51:19,924
He had broken his leg
horribly in the fall.

805
01:51:20,091 --> 01:51:23,177
We tried to set it as best we could,
but the leg became infected...

806
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:28,099
and the cook said that we had
to do something or he'd die.

807
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:29,642
The cook said he'd do it,

808
01:51:29,767 --> 01:51:32,103
but Mother and I had
to hold the man down.

809
01:51:32,186 --> 01:51:34,772
And I believed him, we needed to do it.

810
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:37,275
So...

811
01:51:38,943 --> 01:51:42,029
I kept saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

812
01:51:42,196 --> 01:51:46,033
And he just kept looking at me.
His eyes were so...

813
01:51:49,203 --> 01:51:52,665
I'll never understand the point
of that man's suffering.

814
01:51:53,833 --> 01:51:56,043
I can still hear him.

815
01:51:56,794 --> 01:52:00,464
The happy Buddhist,
he only ate rice and gravy.

816
01:52:05,678 --> 01:52:07,722
We didn't save him, of course.

817
01:52:07,889 --> 01:52:09,307
He died.

818
01:52:10,391 --> 01:52:12,476
The morning after,
the cook caught his first dorado...

819
01:52:12,643 --> 01:52:15,688
and I didn't understand
what he had done at first, but Mother did...

820
01:52:15,855 --> 01:52:18,816
and I had never seen Mother so angry.

821
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,569
"Stop whining and be happy," he said.

822
01:52:21,736 --> 01:52:24,572
"We need more food or we'll die.
That was the whole point."

823
01:52:24,739 --> 01:52:26,657
"What was the whole point?"
Mother asked.

824
01:52:26,824 --> 01:52:30,912
"You let that poor boy die in order
to get bait, you monster!"

825
01:52:32,413 --> 01:52:33,497
The cook got furious.

826
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:35,666
He started towards her
with his fist raised...

827
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:38,878
and Mother slapped him hard,
right across the face.

828
01:52:39,045 --> 01:52:40,922
I was stunned.

829
01:52:41,088 --> 01:52:43,549
I thought he was going
to kill her right then.

830
01:52:44,884 --> 01:52:46,761
But he didn't.

831
01:52:48,679 --> 01:52:51,390
The cook didn't stop at bait either, no.

832
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,185
The sailor...

833
01:52:55,937 --> 01:52:58,272
He went the same way the rat went.

834
01:53:01,025 --> 01:53:03,527
The cook was a resourceful man.

835
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:09,867
It was a week later that he...

836
01:53:11,577 --> 01:53:13,746
Because of me.

837
01:53:13,913 --> 01:53:16,874
Because I couldn't
hold on to a stupid turtle.

838
01:53:17,416 --> 01:53:19,919
It slipped out of my hands
and swam away.

839
01:53:20,086 --> 01:53:22,421
And the cook came up and he punched me
on the side of my head...

840
01:53:22,588 --> 01:53:24,799
and my teeth clacked and I saw stars.

841
01:53:24,966 --> 01:53:26,133
I thought he was going to hit me again...

842
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,260
but Mother started
pounding on him with her fists...

843
01:53:28,427 --> 01:53:30,221
screaming, "Monster, monster!"

844
01:53:30,388 --> 01:53:31,889
She yelled at me to go to the raft.

845
01:53:33,766 --> 01:53:36,560
I thought she was coming with me,
or I'd never have...

846
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:42,108
I don't know why
I didn't make her go first.

847
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:46,445
I think about that every day.

848
01:53:52,493 --> 01:53:56,163
I jumped over and turned back
just as the knife came out.

849
01:54:00,084 --> 01:54:02,586
There wasn't anything I could do.

850
01:54:04,422 --> 01:54:06,424
I couldn't look away.

851
01:54:10,636 --> 01:54:13,097
He threw her body overboard.

852
01:54:14,765 --> 01:54:18,602
And then the sharks came.
And I saw what they...

853
01:54:23,315 --> 01:54:24,942
I saw.

854
01:54:31,032 --> 01:54:33,617
The next day, I killed him.

855
01:54:34,785 --> 01:54:37,621
He didn't even fight back.
He knew he had gone too far...

856
01:54:37,788 --> 01:54:39,957
even by his own standards.

857
01:54:41,834 --> 01:54:46,630
He'd left the knife out on the bench,
and I did to him what he did to the sailor.

858
01:54:49,383 --> 01:54:52,636
He was such an evil man,
but worse still, he...

859
01:54:54,555 --> 01:54:57,349
He brought the evil out in me.

860
01:54:58,809 --> 01:55:01,187
And I have to live with that.

861
01:55:07,902 --> 01:55:10,654
I was alone in a lifeboat...

862
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:14,366
drifting across the Pacific Ocean.

863
01:55:15,076 --> 01:55:16,911
And I survived.

864
01:55:22,041 --> 01:55:25,336
After that, they had no more questions.

865
01:55:25,503 --> 01:55:29,173
The investigators didn't seem
to like the story, exactly.

866
01:55:30,007 --> 01:55:34,512
But they thanked me,
they wished me well, and they left.

867
01:55:41,185 --> 01:55:43,354
So the stories...

868
01:55:46,023 --> 01:55:48,400
both the zebra and the sailor...

869
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:50,778
broke their leg.

870
01:55:51,195 --> 01:55:54,406
And the hyena killed
the zebra and the orangutan.

871
01:55:54,865 --> 01:55:58,869
So... the hyena is the cook.

872
01:55:59,203 --> 01:56:01,539
The sailor is the zebra.

873
01:56:01,872 --> 01:56:04,583
Your mother is the orangutan.

874
01:56:04,917 --> 01:56:08,045
And you are...

875
01:56:08,879 --> 01:56:11,298
the tiger.

876
01:56:15,302 --> 01:56:17,096
Can I ask you something?

877
01:56:18,597 --> 01:56:20,432
Of course.

878
01:56:20,599 --> 01:56:24,436
I've told you two stories about
what happened out on the ocean.

879
01:56:24,603 --> 01:56:27,898
Neither explains what caused
the sinking of the ship...

880
01:56:28,065 --> 01:56:32,236
and no one can prove
which story is true and which is not.

881
01:56:32,403 --> 01:56:35,739
In both stories, the ship sinks...

882
01:56:35,906 --> 01:56:38,826
my family dies and I suffer.

883
01:56:39,285 --> 01:56:40,744
True.

884
01:56:43,289 --> 01:56:45,583
So, which story do you prefer?

885
01:56:53,090 --> 01:56:55,259
The one with the tiger.

886
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:58,512
That's the better story.

887
01:57:01,849 --> 01:57:03,601
Thank you.

888
01:57:04,185 --> 01:57:06,604
And so it goes with God.

889
01:57:18,324 --> 01:57:20,159
Mamaji was right.

890
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:23,454
It's an amazing story.

891
01:57:24,872 --> 01:57:26,790
Will you really let me write it?

892
01:57:26,957 --> 01:57:28,375
Of course.

893
01:57:28,542 --> 01:57:31,795
Isn't that why Mamaji sent you here,
after all?

894
01:57:35,799 --> 01:57:37,384
My wife is here.

895
01:57:37,551 --> 01:57:39,637
Do you want to stay for dinner?
She's an incredible cook.

896
01:57:39,803 --> 01:57:40,971
I didn't know you had a wife.

897
01:57:41,138 --> 01:57:43,349
And a cat and two children.

898
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:46,352
So, your story does have a happy ending.

899
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:49,480
Well, that's up to you.

900
01:57:49,813 --> 01:57:52,149
The story is yours now.

901
01:58:09,541 --> 01:58:13,754
"Mr. Patel's is an astounding story
of courage and endurance...

902
01:58:13,921 --> 01:58:16,882
"unparalleled in the history of shipwrecks.

903
01:58:17,049 --> 01:58:21,345
"Very few castaways can claim
to have survived so long at sea...

904
01:58:21,512 --> 01:58:24,056
"and none in the company...

905
01:58:24,223 --> 01:58:26,892
"of an adult Bengal tiger."

906
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:33,732
We have a guest. Let me introduce you.

907
01:58:34,608 --> 01:58:35,734
- Hi.
- Hi.

908
01:58:36,026 --> 01:58:37,278
Nice to meet you.

909
01:58:37,444 --> 01:58:38,696
Adita.

910
01:58:39,697 --> 01:58:40,906
Ravi.
