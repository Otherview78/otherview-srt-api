1
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:28,656
Everybody, heads up! Keep it clear, now.

2
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:30,111
Keep it clear!

3
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:33,035
Stand back!

4
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,038
Bring it forward, come on!

5
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:46,382
Slow it down!

6
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:59,231
Pushing team, move in there. Move in.

7
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:03,654
On your ready. I want Tasers on full charge.

8
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:08,154
Steady! Go on. Step back in.

9
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:10,076
Ready. Move it.

10
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:12,745
And push.

11
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:22,164
Locked. Loading team, step away.

12
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:23,506
Move it.

13
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,137
Jophery, raise the gate.

14
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:53,490
Block the opening! Don't let her get out!

15
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,289
Somebody help him!

16
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,382
Work her back!

17
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:19,220
Shoot her!

18
00:03:58,136 --> 00:04:00,116
What's this I hear at the airport, Hammond's not even here.

19
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:01,485
He sends his apologies.

20
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:04,499
We are facing a $20 million lawsuit by the family of that worker

21
00:04:04,524 --> 00:04:06,798
and you're telling me that Hammond can't see me?

22
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:10,147
He had to leave early, he wants to be with his daughter, she's getting a divorce.

23
00:04:10,172 --> 00:04:13,334
I understand that, but we've been advised to deal with the situation now.

24
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:15,708
-The insurance company... -You okay?

25
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:20,388
The underwriters feel that the accident has raised some

26
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:22,757
very serious safety questions about the park.

27
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:25,245
That makes the investors very, very anxious.

28
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:29,101
I had to promise to conduct a very thorough, on-site inspection.

29
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:33,329
Hammond hates inspections. They slow everything down.

30
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,082
I need to or they'll pull the funding.

31
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,016
That'll slow him down even more.

32
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:44,000
Watch your head.

33
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:47,730
If two experts sign off on the island,

34
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,490
the insurance guys will back off.

35
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:52,818
I've already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.

36
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,646
-They want Alan Grant. -Grant?

37
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:56,818
You'll never get him out of Montana.

38
00:04:57,538 --> 00:04:58,824
Why not?

39
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,081
Why not?

40
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,504
Because Grant's like me.

41
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:09,905
He's a digger.

42
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:57,212
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler, we're ready to try again.

43
00:05:58,696 --> 00:06:00,278
I hate computers.

44
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:02,058
The feeling's mutual.

45
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:18,240
Take a look.

46
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:22,369
Did it work?

47
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:23,946
How long does this take?

48
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,531
Should bring an immediate return.

49
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:27,082
You shoot the radar into the ground,

50
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:29,706
and the bone bounces the image back.

51
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:31,871
Bounces it back...

52
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:36,005
This new program IS incredible.

53
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:40,047
A few more years' development, and we won't even have to dig anymore.

54
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:41,848
Where's the fun in that?

55
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,928
It's a little distorted, but I don't think it's the computer.

56
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,148
Post-mortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.

57
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:51,808
Velociraptor?

58
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:53,438
Yes. Good shape, too.

59
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:56,939
It's five, six feet high. I'm guessing nine feet long.

60
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:58,364
Look... What'd you do?

61
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,782
He touched it.

62
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:01,951
Dr. Grant's not machine-compatible.

63
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:03,824
Hell, they've got it in for me.

64
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,407
And look at the half-moon shaped bones in the wrists.

65
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:10,163
It's no wonder these guys learned how to fly.

66
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:13,379
No, seriously.

67
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:20,304
Maybe dinosaurs have more In common with present-day birds than with reptiles.

68
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,882
Look at the pubic bone, turned backward, just like a bird.

69
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:28,265
Look at the vertebrae, full of air sacs and hollows, like a bird.

70
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:31,477
And even the word "Raptor" means "bird of prey."

71
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:33,854
That doesn't look very scary.

72
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,146
More like a 6-foot turkey.

73
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,991
A turkey?

74
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:46,825
Imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period.

75
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,122
Here we go.

76
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:52,373
You'd get your first look at this 6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

77
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,668
He moves like a bird, lightly bobbing his head.

78
00:07:55,758 --> 00:08:00,173
You keep still because you think maybe his visual acuity IS based on movement,

79
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:03,004
like T-Rex and he'll lose you if you don't move.

80
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:05,215
But no, not Velociraptor.

81
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:09,636
You stare at him and he just stares right back.

82
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:11,809
And that's when the attack comes.

83
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:14,982
Not from the front, but from the side.

84
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:19,403
From the other two Raptors you didn't even know were there.

85
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:22,903
Because Velociraptor's a pack hunter.

86
00:08:22,993 --> 00:08:25,610
He uses coordinated attack patterns

87
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,117
and he is out in force today.

88
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,620
And he slashes at you with this,

89
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:36,213
a 6-inch retractable claw, like a razor, on the middle toe.

90
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:40,338
He doesn't bother to bite your jugular like a lion. No.

91
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,552
He slashes at you

92
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:45,221
here or here...

93
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:46,677
Alan.

94
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:51,015
Or maybe across the belly, spilling your intestines.

95
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:57,268
The point is, you are alive when they start to eat you.

96
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:02,276
So, you know, try to show a little respect.

97
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,194
Okay.

98
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:14,204
Alan, if you wanted to scare the kid,

99
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:16,377
you could've pulled a gun on him.

100
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,956
Yeah, I know. Kids.

101
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,791
You want to have one of those?

102
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:23,585
I don't want that kid,

103
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,842
but a breed of the child could be intriguing.

104
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:29,598
I mean, what's so wrong with kids?

105
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:34,100
They're noisy, they're messy, they're expensive.

106
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,680
Cheap, cheap.

107
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,186
They smell.

108
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,937
They don't smell! Some smell.

109
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:41,315
Give me a break! Babies smell.

110
00:09:48,913 --> 00:09:50,950
Cover the site! Cover up the dig!

111
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,280
Tell them to shut down!

112
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:53,614
Cut the machine!

113
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,291
Cover it all up. Pull it over.

114
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,714
Just cut it, will you? Shut it down!

115
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:03,545
What?

116
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,359
What the hell do you think you're doing in here?

117
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,565
We were saving that.

118
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:26,564
For today, I guarantee it.

119
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:29,988
Who in God's name do you think you are?

120
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,160
John Hammond.

121
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:34,615
And I'm delighted to meet you finally in person, Dr. Grant.

122
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:40,671
So, I can see that my $50,000 a year has been well spent.

123
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:42,588
Who's the jerk?

124
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,791
This is our paleobotanist, Dr...

125
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:46,091
Sattler.

126
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:48,469
Ellie, this is Mr. Hammond.

127
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:51,927
I'm sorry about the dramatic entrance, Dr. Sattler, but...

128
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:54,008
Did I say "jerk"? ...we're in a hurry.

129
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:57,516
Will you have a drink? We won't let it get warm. Sit down.

130
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,353
Let me have this. I'll just get a glass or two. I can do it.

131
00:11:01,443 --> 00:11:02,979
There's samples all over here.

132
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,686
I know my way around the kitchen.

133
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,942
Now, I'll get right to the point.

134
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,866
I like you. Both of you.

135
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:14,530
I can tell instantly about people. It's a gift.

136
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:20,785
I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica.

137
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:24,876
I've leased it from the government and during the last five years,

138
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:27,459
I've been setting up a biological preserve.

139
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,920
Really spectacular. Spared no expense.

140
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:33,473
Make the one I've got down in Kenya look like a petting zoo.

141
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,723
And there's no doubt our attractions will drive kids out of their minds.

142
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:39,303
And what are those?

143
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,184
Small versions of adults, honey.

144
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:43,186
And not just kids, everyone.

145
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:46,611
We're going to open next year, If the lawyers don't kill me first.

146
00:11:46,697 --> 00:11:49,189
I don't care for lawyers, do you?

147
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:52,616
I don't really know any. Don't really know any.

148
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:57,789
I do, there's a particular pebble in my shoe, who represents my investors.

149
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:00,875
Says that they insist on outside opinions.

150
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:02,577
What kind of opinions?

151
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:05,705
Well, your kind, not to put too fine a point on it.

152
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,884
Let's face it, In your particular fields, you're the top minds.

153
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,427
And if I could just persuade you

154
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:16,053
to sign off on the park, give it your endorsement,

155
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:20,558
maybe even pen a wee testimonial, I could get back on schedule.

156
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:24,106
Why would they care what we think?

157
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:25,775
What kind of park is this?

158
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:30,029
It's right up your alley.

159
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:36,111
Why don't you come down, just the pair of you, for the weekend?

160
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:39,368
I'd love to have an opinion of a paleobotanist as well.

161
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,367
I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.

162
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:46,670
I'm sorry. This isn't possible.

163
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:49,124
We just dug up a new skeleton...

164
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:53,303
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig...

165
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:56,389
This is a very unusual time. The timing is...

166
00:12:56,517 --> 00:12:58,849
...for a further three years.

167
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:05,313
Where's the plane?

168
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:07,809
Okay. Three years.

169
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:09,189
Cheers.

170
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:52,733
Dodgson!

171
00:14:00,914 --> 00:14:02,700
You shouldn't use my name.

172
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,542
Dodgson. We've got Dodgson here.

173
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:10,371
See, nobody cares. Nice hat.

174
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:13,799
What're you trying to look like, a secret agent?

175
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:15,626
Well? $750,000.

176
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:18,633
On delivery, $50,000 more for each viable embryo.

177
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:21,804
That's $1.5 million if you get all 15 species off the island.

178
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:22,975
I'll get them all.

179
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:26,971
Remember, viable embryos. They're no use to us if they don't survive.

180
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:29,314
How am I supposed to transport them?

181
00:14:33,113 --> 00:14:34,820
The bottom screws open.

182
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:38,152
That's great. Oh, my God.

183
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:40,735
It's cooled and compartmentalized inside.

184
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:42,365
You guys. That's great.

185
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:44,096
Customs can even check it if they want to.

186
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,656
Let me see. Go on.

187
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:48,375
There's enough coolant for 36 hours.

188
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:49,623
No menthol?

189
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:52,751
The embryos have to be back here in San José by then.

190
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:54,582
That's up to your guy on the boat.

191
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:58,340
7:00 tomorrow night on the East Dock. Make sure he gets it right.

192
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,421
How are you planning to beat security?

193
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:02,632
I've got an 18-minute window.

194
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,678
Eighteen minutes and your company catches up on 10 years of research.

195
00:15:10,818 --> 00:15:12,809
Don't get cheap on me, Dodgson.

196
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:17,355
That was Hammond's mistake.

197
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:34,038
So you two dig up dinosaurs?

198
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:38,463
Well... We try to.

199
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:47,393
You'll have to get used to Dr. Malcolm.

200
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:50,309
He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality,

201
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,889
especially for a mathematician.

202
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,850
Chaotician. Chaotician, actually.

203
00:15:53,944 --> 00:15:55,730
John doesn't subscribe to chaos,

204
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,313
particularly what it says about his science project.

205
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:02,116
Ian, you've never been able to sufficiently explain your concerns...

206
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:05,069
Because of the behavior of the system in phase space?

207
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,407
A load, if I may say so, of fashionable number crunching...

208
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,748
Don't.

209
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:12,915
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant, you've heard of Chaos Theory?

210
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:14,213
No.

211
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:15,584
No? Non-linear equations?

212
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:18,415
Strange attractors?

213
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:25,173
I refuse to believe that you aren't familiar with the concept of attraction.

214
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:32,559
I bring scientists. You bring a rock star.

215
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,110
There it is.

216
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:08,181
Bad wind shears. We have to drop pretty fast.

217
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:10,726
Hold on, this will be thrilling.

218
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:41,169
But you need that piece over here, and that piece...

219
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:44,009
We'll have landed by the time you get it right.

220
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:46,219
Great.

221
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:07,168
The full 50 miles of perimeter fence are in place?

222
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:10,471
And the concrete moats, and the motion-sensor tracking systems.

223
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:13,762
Donald, dear boy, relax. Try and enjoy yourself.

224
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:16,928
Let's get this straight. This is not a weekend excursion.

225
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:20,102
This is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.

226
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:23,066
Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.

227
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:26,646
Forty-eight hours from now, if they're not convinced, I'm not convinced.

228
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:28,489
I'll shut you down, John.

229
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:33,111
In 48 hours, I'll be accepting your apologies.

230
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:44,918
All right, slow down. Slow. Stop!

231
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:48,796
This shouldn't be here.

232
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:11,445
Alan, this species of Veriforman has been extinct

233
00:20:11,535 --> 00:20:14,277
since the Cretaceous Period. I mean, this thing...

234
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:15,702
What?

235
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,646
Look at that.

236
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:52,022
It's a dinosaur.

237
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:59,705
You did it. Crazy son of a bitch, you did it.

238
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:04,706
We could tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply.

239
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,128
They're wrong. This is a warm-blooded creature.

240
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:08,705
This thing doesn't live in a swamp.

241
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,916
This thing's got a 25, 27-foot neck?

242
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:12,422
The Brachiosaurus? 30.

243
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:13,547
Thirty feet.

244
00:21:30,113 --> 00:21:32,730
We're gonna make a fortune with this place.

245
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:39,069
How fast are they?

246
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:42,415
Well, we clocked the T-Rex at 32 miles an hour.

247
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:45,617
T-Rex?

248
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:48,712
You said you've got a T-Rex?

249
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:50,873
Say again.

250
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:53,417
We have a T-Rex.

251
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:57,467
Put your head between your knees.

252
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:59,139
Dr. Grant,

253
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:01,558
my dear Dr. Sattler,

254
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:05,146
welcome to Jurassic Park.

255
00:22:28,797 --> 00:22:30,538
They're moving in herds.

256
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:34,383
They do move in herds.

257
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:44,059
How did you do this?

258
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:48,187
I'll show you.

259
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,332
Good day.

260
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,752
The most advanced amusement park in the entire world,

261
00:23:19,472 --> 00:23:21,634
incorporating all the latest technologies.

262
00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:25,013
And I'm not talking just about rides. Everybody has rides.

263
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:29,347
No, we've made living biological attractions so astounding

264
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:33,017
that they'll capture the imagination of the entire planet.

265
00:23:33,403 --> 00:23:35,189
So, what are you thinking?

266
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,779
That we're out of a job.

267
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:39,527
Don't you mean "extinct"?

268
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:48,253
Why don't you all sit down? Donald, sit down.

269
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:52,236
Why don't you all sit down? Donald, sit down.

270
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,418
Here he comes. Well, here I come.

271
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:01,302
Hello.

272
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:03,463
Say hello.

273
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:04,719
Hello.

274
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:07,055
Hello, John.

275
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:09,515
Yes, I've got lines.

276
00:24:09,606 --> 00:24:13,065
Well, fine, I guess. But, how did I get here?

277
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:18,062
Well, let me show you. First, I'll need a drop of blood.

278
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:19,897
Your blood.

279
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,231
Right.

280
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:24,067
That hurt.

281
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,579
Relax, John. It's all part of the miracle of cloning.

282
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,748
Hello, John.

283
00:24:31,753 --> 00:24:32,993
Cloned from what?

284
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:35,796
Loy extractions never recreated an intact DNA strand.

285
00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:37,961
Not without massive sequence gaps.

286
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:39,959
Paleo-DNA, from what source?

287
00:24:40,637 --> 00:24:44,096
Where do you get 100 million-year-old dinosaur blood?

288
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,101
What? What?

289
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:53,813
Well, Mr. DNA, where did you come from?

290
00:24:53,983 --> 00:24:55,269
From your blood.

291
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,649
Just one drop of your blood contains billions of strands of DNA,

292
00:24:59,989 --> 00:25:02,276
the building blocks of life.

293
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:07,657
A DNA strand like me is a blueprint for building a living thing.

294
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:13,000
And sometimes animals that went extinct millions of years ago, like dinosaurs,

295
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:18,339
left their blueprints behind for us to find. We just had to know where to look.

296
00:25:18,508 --> 00:25:23,344
A hundred million years ago, there were mosquitoes just like today.

297
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:26,805
And just like today, they fed on the blood of animals.

298
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:31,643
Even dinosaurs. Sometimes, after biting a dinosaur,

299
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,474
mosquitoes would land on the branch of a tree and get stuck in the sap.

300
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:41,688
After a long time, the tree sap would get hard and become fossilized,

301
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:46,693
just like a dinosaur bone, preserving the mosquito inside.

302
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:50,996
This fossilised tree sap, which we call amber,

303
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:55,576
waited for millions of years with the mosquito inside

304
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,746
until Jurassic Park scientists came along.

305
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:01,790
Using sophisticated techniques,

306
00:26:01,885 --> 00:26:03,967
they extract the preserved blood

307
00:26:04,053 --> 00:26:08,388
from the mosquito, and bingo: dino DNA!

308
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:13,723
A full DNA strand contains three billion genetic codes.

309
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:18,440
If we looked at screens like these once a second for eight hours a day,

310
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:22,690
it'd take two years to look at the entire DNA strand.

311
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:27,446
It's that long. Since it's so old, it's full of holes.

312
00:26:28,077 --> 00:26:30,739
Now that's where our geneticists take over.

313
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:34,907
Thinking machine super-computers and gene sequencers

314
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:37,163
break down the strand in minutes.

315
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:39,290
And virtual-reality displays

316
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,543
show our geneticists the gaps in the DNA sequence.

317
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,626
We used the complete DNA of a frog

318
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,634
to fill in the holes and complete the code.

319
00:26:50,225 --> 00:26:54,389
Whew! And now, we can make a baby dinosaur.

320
00:26:57,565 --> 00:26:59,476
This score IS only temporary.

321
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,604
It all has very dramatic music, of course.

322
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:04,774
A march or something. It hasn't been written yet.

323
00:27:04,906 --> 00:27:06,772
And then, the tour moves on.

324
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:21,041
Well, look here. Those hard-working cowpokes you see behind us...

325
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,497
This is overwhelming, John.

326
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:27,839
Are these characters autoerotica?

327
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:30,591
No, we have no animatronics here.

328
00:27:30,723 --> 00:27:34,057
Those people are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.

329
00:27:34,143 --> 00:27:37,352
...in unfertilized emu or ostrich eggs.

330
00:27:38,147 --> 00:27:41,105
Wait a minute. How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?

331
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:42,682
Can't we see the unfertilized eggs?

332
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:43,892
Shortly.

333
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:48,943
Now a whole team of genetic engineers goes to work on...

334
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:50,239
Can't you stop these things?

335
00:27:50,326 --> 00:27:52,408
I'm sorry. It's kind of a ride.

336
00:27:52,495 --> 00:27:54,452
One, two, three.

337
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:58,247
-You can't do that. -What?

338
00:27:58,334 --> 00:27:59,790
Can they do that?

339
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,496
The boat for the mainland

340
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:06,707
will be leaving at 1900.

341
00:28:06,801 --> 00:28:11,716
All personnel be at the dock no later than 1845. No exceptions.

342
00:28:12,515 --> 00:28:14,222
Good day, Henry.

343
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:15,640
Good day, sir.

344
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:31,281
It's turning the eggs.

345
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:38,990
Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd hatch before I had to go to the boat.

346
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,541
Henry, why didn't you tell me?

347
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:45,667
I insist on being here when they're born.

348
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,791
Come on.

349
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:52,006
Come on, little one.

350
00:28:58,353 --> 00:28:59,718
Come on, then.

351
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:04,898
Very good. Push.

352
00:29:06,861 --> 00:29:09,023
-Very good. -God.

353
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:11,525
Push. Come on.

354
00:29:12,116 --> 00:29:15,029
Come on. Come on, then.

355
00:29:15,328 --> 00:29:18,161
There you are.

356
00:29:23,211 --> 00:29:26,579
They imprint on the first creature they come in contact with.

357
00:29:26,673 --> 00:29:29,586
That's it. Helps them to trust me.

358
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:35,221
I've been present for the birth of every little creature on this island.

359
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,516
Surely not the ones that have bred in the wild?

360
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:41,927
Actually they can't breed in the wild.

361
00:29:42,021 --> 00:29:44,854
Population control is one of our security precautions.

362
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:47,899
There's no unauthorized breeding in Jurassic Park.

363
00:29:49,153 --> 00:29:51,315
How do you know they can't breed?

364
00:29:52,532 --> 00:29:55,900
Because all the animals in Jurassic Park are female.

365
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,361
We've engineered them that way.

366
00:29:58,538 --> 00:30:00,074
There you are.

367
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:05,117
Oh, my God. Look at that.

368
00:30:05,545 --> 00:30:08,833
Blood temperature seems like about high 80s, maybe.

369
00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:10,038
Wu?

370
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:11,419
Ninety-one.

371
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,625
Homoeothermic? It holds that temperature?

372
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,801
Yes.

373
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:22,301
But, again, how do you know they're all female?

374
00:30:22,395 --> 00:30:26,480
What, does somebody go out In the park and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?

375
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:30,025
We control their chromosomes. It's really not that difficult.

376
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:32,694
All vertebrate embryos are inherently female, anyway.

377
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,444
They just require an extra hormone given at the right developmental stage

378
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:37,649
to make them male.

379
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:39,200
We simply deny them that.

380
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:40,618
Deny them that?

381
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:44,406
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.

382
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,458
If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us,

383
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,252
it's that life will not be contained.

384
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:52,000
Life breaks free. Expands to new territories

385
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:55,675
and it crashes through barriers, painfully, maybe even dangerously,

386
00:30:55,762 --> 00:30:58,470
but there it is.

387
00:31:00,016 --> 00:31:01,472
There it is.

388
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,975
You're implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will breed?

389
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:11,480
No, I'm simply saying that life finds a way.

390
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,570
What species is this?

391
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:24,238
It's a Velociraptor.

392
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:29,909
You bred Raptors?

393
00:31:44,227 --> 00:31:48,812
Dr. Grant! As I was saying, we laid on lunch for you before you go into the park.

394
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,978
Our gourmet chef, Alejandro... What are they doing?

395
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,946
Feeding them.

396
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:08,958
Alejandro's prepared a delightful menu for us. Chilean sea bass, I believe.

397
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:11,500
Shall we?

398
00:32:51,252 --> 00:32:53,493
They should all be destroyed.

399
00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:56,580
Robert Muldoon. My game warden from Kenya.

400
00:32:56,716 --> 00:32:59,674
Bit of an alarmist, but knows more about Raptors than anyone.

401
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,671
What's their growth rate?

402
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:04,379
They're lethal at eight months, and I do mean lethal.

403
00:33:04,473 --> 00:33:07,966
I've hunted most things that can hunt you, but the way these move...

404
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,051
Fast for a biped? Cheetah speed.

405
00:33:10,646 --> 00:33:13,183
Fifty, sixty miles per hour If they ever got out in the open.

406
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:15,015
And they're astonishing jumpers.

407
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:18,397
Yes. That's why we're taking extreme precautions.

408
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:22,189
Do they show intelligence? Was their brain cavity...

409
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:23,990
They show extreme intelligence.

410
00:33:24,076 --> 00:33:26,534
Even problem-solving intelligence.

411
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:28,203
Especially the big one.

412
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:30,701
We bred eight originally, but when she came In,

413
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:34,204
she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.

414
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:39,923
That one, when she looks at you, you can see she's working things out.

415
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,467
That's why we have to feed them like this.

416
00:33:43,596 --> 00:33:46,554
She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.

417
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:48,473
The fences are electrified, right?

418
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,722
That's right, but they never attack the same place twice.

419
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:55,476
They were testing the fences for weaknesses, systematically.

420
00:33:56,943 --> 00:33:58,433
They remember.

421
00:34:09,664 --> 00:34:12,497
Yes. Well, who's hungry?

422
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:14,870
More adventurous guests, of course,

423
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:16,577
can opt for our jungle river cruise

424
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:19,083
or for a close-up look at our majestic...

425
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:22,416
None of these attractions are ready yet, but the park will open

426
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,845
with the basic tour you are about to take, and then other rides will come on-line

427
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:28,304
six or twelve months after that.

428
00:34:28,391 --> 00:34:30,598
Absolutely spectacular designs.

429
00:34:30,685 --> 00:34:31,891
Spared no expense.

430
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:33,935
And we can charge anything we want.

431
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:36,763
$2,000 a day, $10,000 a day, and people will pay it.

432
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:38,518
And there's the merchandise...

433
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:39,690
Donald.

434
00:34:40,194 --> 00:34:43,437
This park was not built to cater only for the super rich.

435
00:34:43,531 --> 00:34:46,523
Everyone in the world has the right to enjoy these animals.

436
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:51,199
Sure. They will. We'll have a coupon day or something.

437
00:34:56,127 --> 00:35:00,997
The lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here staggers me.

438
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:05,463
Thank you. But things are a little different than you and I had feared.

439
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:06,964
I know. They're a lot worse.

440
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:10,297
Now, wait a second, we haven't even seen the park yet...

441
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:15,306
Donald, let him talk. There's no reason, I want to hear every viewpoint.

442
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:20,641
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?

443
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:23,318
Genetic power's the most awesome force the planet's ever seen

444
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:26,237
but you wield it like a kid that's found his dad's gun.

445
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:28,481
It's hardly appropriate to start hurling...

446
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:29,862
If I may.

447
00:35:30,036 --> 00:35:33,654
I'll tell you the problem with the scientific power you're using here.

448
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:36,740
It didn't require any discipline to attain it.

449
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:41,377
You read what others had done, and you took the next step.

450
00:35:41,464 --> 00:35:43,796
You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves

451
00:35:43,883 --> 00:35:46,921
so you don't take any responsibility for it.

452
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:50,174
You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish

453
00:35:50,264 --> 00:35:51,504
something as fast as you could.

454
00:35:51,557 --> 00:35:55,846
Before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it

455
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:59,019
and slapped it on a plastic lunch box, now you're selling it.

456
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:00,847
You're going to sell it.

457
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,608
I don't think you're giving us our due credit.

458
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:07,107
Our scientists have done things which nobody has ever done before.

459
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:10,441
But your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could,

460
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:12,775
they didn't stop to think if they should.

461
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,784
Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction.

462
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,743
If I was to create a flock of condors on this island,

463
00:36:20,836 --> 00:36:22,372
you wouldn't have anything to say.

464
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:25,205
Hold on, this isn't some species that was obliterated

465
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:28,462
by deforestation or the building of a dam.

466
00:36:28,594 --> 00:36:33,430
Dinosaurs had their shot and nature selected them for extinction.

467
00:36:35,434 --> 00:36:39,644
I don't understand this Luddite attitude. Especially from a scientist.

468
00:36:39,772 --> 00:36:44,642
How can we stand in the light of discovery and not act?

469
00:36:44,777 --> 00:36:46,188
What's so great about discovery?

470
00:36:46,278 --> 00:36:48,394
It's a violent, penetrative act,

471
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:52,107
that scars what it explores. What you call discovery,

472
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,902
I call the rape of the natural world.

473
00:36:56,789 --> 00:37:00,578
The question is, how can you know anything about an extinct eco-system?

474
00:37:00,668 --> 00:37:03,831
And therefore, how could you ever assume that you can control it?

475
00:37:03,963 --> 00:37:06,921
You have poisonous plants in this building.

476
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,527
You picked them because they look good.

477
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:12,636
But these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're in

478
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:15,884
and they'll defend themselves. Violently, if necessary.

479
00:37:18,227 --> 00:37:21,094
Dr. Grant, if there's one person here

480
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:23,054
who could appreciate what I am trying to do...

481
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:29,735
The world has just changed so radically and we're all running to catch up.

482
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:35,029
I don't want to jump to any conclusions, but dinosaurs and man,

483
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:39,280
two species separated by 65 million years of evolution

484
00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:42,832
have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together.

485
00:37:42,918 --> 00:37:47,333
How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?

486
00:37:48,424 --> 00:37:50,631
I don't believe it.

487
00:37:50,718 --> 00:37:54,006
You're meant to come here and defend me against these characters

488
00:37:54,096 --> 00:37:57,760
and the only one I've got on my side is the blood-sucking lawyer.

489
00:37:58,392 --> 00:37:59,553
Thank you.

490
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:07,728
They're here.

491
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:11,524
You four are gonna have a spot of company out in the park.

492
00:38:11,614 --> 00:38:14,402
Spend a little time with our target audience.

493
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:17,070
Grandpa! Kids!

494
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,741
Wait! Careful with me.

495
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:22,832
We missed you.

496
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,078
Me, too.

497
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,668
We loved the presents. They were great.

498
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:27,914
Did you enjoy the helicopter?

499
00:38:27,963 --> 00:38:30,625
Yeah, it went down and we all went right up.

500
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:37,091
Now, kids, come away. Not too close to the cars.

501
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:41,637
Aren't they lovely? Aren't they glorious, though?

502
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:44,227
These will be your transports for the afternoon.

503
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:45,348
No drivers?

504
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:47,350
No. No drivers. They're electric.

505
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:50,183
They run on this track In the middle of the roadway here.

506
00:38:50,277 --> 00:38:53,360
Totally non-polluting. Top of the line. Spared no expense.

507
00:38:53,447 --> 00:38:55,188
It's an interactive CD-ROM!

508
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:59,116
You touch the right part of the screen and it talks about whatever you want.

509
00:38:59,245 --> 00:39:02,283
Lex, you're all right in there. Dr. Sattler, come with me.

510
00:39:02,414 --> 00:39:04,280
Dr. Grant, come in the second car.

511
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:06,953
I'm gonna ride with Dr. Sattler.

512
00:39:18,514 --> 00:39:20,175
I read your book.

513
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:22,973
That's great.

514
00:39:23,978 --> 00:39:28,142
Do you really think dinosaurs turned into birds and that's where they went?

515
00:39:29,108 --> 00:39:31,975
A few species may have evolved along those lines.

516
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:39,824
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.

517
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:43,494
I heard that there was this meteor,

518
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:47,874
hit the earth someplace down in Mexico, and made this big crater.

519
00:39:48,002 --> 00:39:49,913
Listen...

520
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:51,119
Tim.

521
00:39:51,714 --> 00:39:54,376
Tim, which car were you planning on?

522
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:57,962
Whichever one you are.

523
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:05,559
Then I heard about this thing in Omni about this meteor making all this heat.

524
00:40:05,811 --> 00:40:08,473
It made diamond dust and that changed the weather.

525
00:40:08,564 --> 00:40:10,100
They died because of the weather.

526
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:14,525
My teacher tells me about this book by a guy named Bakker. He says...

527
00:40:16,363 --> 00:40:19,822
She said I should ride with you 'cause it'd be good for you.

528
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,907
The boat is now loading.

529
00:40:22,036 --> 00:40:26,701
Everyone must be on the dock for the 1900 departure.

530
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:31,041
National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm

531
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,411
about 75 miles west of us.

532
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:36,000
Why didn't I build in Orlando?

533
00:40:36,091 --> 00:40:39,880
I'll keep an eye on it. Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.

534
00:40:44,224 --> 00:40:46,181
Ray, start the tour program.

535
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:57,568
Hold onto your butts.

536
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:09,864
And why did they put the fiberglass thing?

537
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,245
I know.

538
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:22,923
You want to join the future, right?

539
00:41:23,138 --> 00:41:25,425
God help us when the hands of engineers...

540
00:41:25,557 --> 00:41:26,843
During your tour,

541
00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:28,390
the appropriate information will be

542
00:41:28,477 --> 00:41:30,764
automatically selected and displayed for you.

543
00:41:30,896 --> 00:41:31,896
Look!

544
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,938
Touch the area of the screen displaying the appropriate icon.

545
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,265
Are we gonna hit that?

546
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,442
Welcome to Jurassic Park.

547
00:41:42,574 --> 00:41:44,941
What have they got in there, King Kong?

548
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:01,211
The voice you're now hearing is Richard Kiley.

549
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:02,875
We spared no expense.

550
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,301
If you look to the right,

551
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:09,303
you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.

552
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:11,384
Dilophosaurus!

553
00:42:11,478 --> 00:42:12,559
Shit!

554
00:42:12,646 --> 00:42:14,478
One of the earliest carnivores,

555
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,899
we now know Dilophosaurus is actually poisonous

556
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:22,980
Spitting its venom at its prey, causing blindness and paralysis,

557
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:26,156
allowing the carnivore to eat at its leisure.

558
00:42:26,827 --> 00:42:30,491
This makes Dilophosaurus a beautiful but deadly addition

559
00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:32,496
to Jurassic Park.

560
00:42:39,673 --> 00:42:41,163
Alan?

561
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,420
Where?

562
00:42:47,306 --> 00:42:48,467
Damn.

563
00:42:53,145 --> 00:42:55,432
Vehicle headlights are on and not responding.

564
00:42:55,522 --> 00:42:58,014
Those shouldn't be running off of car batteries.

565
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,687
Item 151 on today's glitch list.

566
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:03,937
We have all the problems of a major theme park and a major zoo

567
00:43:04,031 --> 00:43:07,023
and the computers aren't even on their feet yet.

568
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:12,695
Dennis, our lives are in your hands and you have butterfingers?

569
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,867
I am totally unappreciated in my time.

570
00:43:17,002 --> 00:43:20,791
You can run this park from this room with minimal staff for up to three days.

571
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:24,875
You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap?

572
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:27,756
You know anybody who can network eight machines

573
00:43:27,846 --> 00:43:31,635
and de-bug two million lines of code on my salary? If so, I want to see them.

574
00:43:31,725 --> 00:43:36,140
Sorry about your financial problems, I really am. But they are your problems.

575
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,063
You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.

576
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:43,393
I will not be drawn into another financial debate with you.

577
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,648
I really will not.

578
00:43:44,738 --> 00:43:46,775
There's been hardly any debate at all.

579
00:43:46,865 --> 00:43:49,732
I don't blame people for their mistakes.

580
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:52,576
But I do ask that they pay for them.

581
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,036
Thanks, Dad.

582
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:56,326
The headlights.

583
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:58,999
I'll debug the tour program when they get back, okay?

584
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:01,327
It'll eat a lot of compute cycles.

585
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:02,621
We'll lose part of the system.

586
00:44:02,645 --> 00:44:05,666
There's a finite amount of memory, you can't use it for everything.

587
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,841
Are you gonna compile for a half an hour...

588
00:44:07,928 --> 00:44:09,384
Quiet, all of you!

589
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:12,756
They're approaching the Tyrannosaur paddock.

590
00:45:03,775 --> 00:45:07,313
God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs.

591
00:45:07,779 --> 00:45:12,569
God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs.

592
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,324
Dinosaurs eat man.

593
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,827
Woman inherits the earth.

594
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:31,676
We'll try to tempt the Rex now. Keep watching the fence.

595
00:45:41,813 --> 00:45:44,020
What's going to happen to the goat?

596
00:45:48,028 --> 00:45:49,860
He's going to eat the goat?

597
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,441
Excellent.

598
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:55,775
What's the matter, kid? You never had lamb chops?

599
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,657
I happen to be a vegetarian.

600
00:46:07,005 --> 00:46:10,214
T-Rex doesn't want to be fed. He wants to hunt.

601
00:46:11,134 --> 00:46:15,879
You can't just suppress 65 million years of gut instinct.

602
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:42,743
Eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?

603
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,752
Hello. Yes?

604
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,330
I really hate that man.

605
00:46:56,555 --> 00:47:01,345
The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey any set patterns or park schedules.

606
00:47:01,435 --> 00:47:03,597
The essence of chaos.

607
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:06,762
I'm still not clear on chaos.

608
00:47:08,442 --> 00:47:12,356
It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.

609
00:47:13,905 --> 00:47:15,862
The shorthand is the Butterfly Effect.

610
00:47:15,949 --> 00:47:18,190
A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking

611
00:47:18,285 --> 00:47:21,368
and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.

612
00:47:23,582 --> 00:47:25,448
Was I going too fast? I missed it.

613
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:26,699
I did a fly-by.

614
00:47:26,793 --> 00:47:29,535
Give me that glass of water. We'll conduct an experiment.

615
00:47:29,629 --> 00:47:31,370
We should be still. The car's bouncing.

616
00:47:31,465 --> 00:47:33,297
That's okay. It's just an example.

617
00:47:33,425 --> 00:47:35,792
Put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic.

618
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,297
A drop of water falls on your hand.

619
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,130
Which way will the drop roll off? Which finger?

620
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:42,889
Thumb, I'd say.

621
00:47:45,604 --> 00:47:47,641
Freeze your hand. Don't move.

622
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:50,644
I'll do the same thing, start with the same place again.

623
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,145
Which way, now?

624
00:47:52,277 --> 00:47:55,235
Let's say back the same way.

625
00:47:57,616 --> 00:47:59,983
It changed. Why?

626
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,447
Because tiny variations,

627
00:48:02,996 --> 00:48:05,408
the orientation of the hairs on your hands...

628
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:06,830
Alan, look at this.

629
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:10,581
...the amount of blood distending your vessels, imperfections in the skin...

630
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,206
"Imperfections in the skin"?

631
00:48:12,297 --> 00:48:13,583
...just microscopic,

632
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:16,586
never repeat and vastly affect the outcome.

633
00:48:16,676 --> 00:48:17,791
That's what?

634
00:48:17,886 --> 00:48:19,001
Unpredictability.

635
00:48:21,848 --> 00:48:25,011
There. Look at this. See? I'm right again.

636
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:29,517
Nobody could predict that Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle.

637
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:34,103
And there's another example.

638
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:40,027
See, here I am now by myself, talking to myself. That's Chaos Theory.

639
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:44,364
Stop the program.

640
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:50,745
I told you, how many times, we needed locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.

641
00:48:50,836 --> 00:48:53,453
Stopping park vehicles and rebooting program.

642
00:48:53,547 --> 00:48:55,834
We're on. Will notify for resume.

643
00:48:58,218 --> 00:49:00,300
I'll switch it over to TelePrompTer.

644
00:49:00,387 --> 00:49:01,877
What about the circuit integrities?

645
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,054
Screen says faulty sensor.

646
00:49:06,393 --> 00:49:07,474
I'll call security.

647
00:49:07,561 --> 00:49:09,893
We're at full go on that and it looks good.

648
00:49:10,188 --> 00:49:13,681
Like I said, there's this other book by a guy named Bakker

649
00:49:13,775 --> 00:49:16,016
and he says dinosaurs died from diseases.

650
00:49:16,111 --> 00:49:17,317
Where are we going?

651
00:49:17,404 --> 00:49:19,111
He didn't say they turned into birds.

652
00:49:19,197 --> 00:49:21,404
Anyone else think we shouldn't be out here?

653
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:24,654
And his book was a lot fatter than yours. Like this.

654
00:49:24,744 --> 00:49:27,486
Really? Yours was fully illustrated.

655
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,871
You okay?

656
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,367
Look at this. Wait. Watch.

657
00:49:33,086 --> 00:49:34,918
Come on. Watch this.

658
00:49:36,965 --> 00:49:38,455
Whoa.

659
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:42,213
Everybody stay here.

660
00:49:57,444 --> 00:49:58,605
Wow.

661
00:50:00,447 --> 00:50:01,447
Okay?

662
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:02,612
Of course.

663
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,526
Don't be scared. Come on, it's okay.

664
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:09,362
Muldoon tranquillized her for me.

665
00:50:09,456 --> 00:50:10,787
She's sick.

666
00:50:19,633 --> 00:50:21,089
Oh, my God.

667
00:50:36,608 --> 00:50:38,144
Hey, baby.

668
00:50:43,657 --> 00:50:46,149
She was always my favorite when I was a kid

669
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:49,611
and now I see she's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

670
00:50:53,959 --> 00:50:55,324
It's okay.

671
00:50:58,463 --> 00:51:01,000
Microvesicles. That's interesting.

672
00:51:03,009 --> 00:51:05,341
Thanks. What are her symptoms?

673
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,671
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.

674
00:51:08,848 --> 00:51:11,010
It seems to happen every six weeks or so.

675
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:12,466
Six weeks.

676
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:27,698
These are dilated. They are?

677
00:51:27,826 --> 00:51:29,567
Take a look.

678
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:30,776
I'll be damned.

679
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:35,031
That's pharmacological. From local plant life.

680
00:51:42,465 --> 00:51:44,581
Is this West Indian lilac?

681
00:51:45,051 --> 00:51:48,589
Yes. We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.

682
00:51:53,018 --> 00:51:54,725
Are you sure?

683
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:55,846
Pretty sure.

684
00:51:57,355 --> 00:51:59,596
There's only one way to be positive.

685
00:52:00,275 --> 00:52:02,812
I'd have to see the dinosaur's droppings.

686
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:07,105
Dino droppings? Droppings?

687
00:52:12,912 --> 00:52:15,153
Yeah, I got that.

688
00:52:16,374 --> 00:52:19,492
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course.

689
00:52:19,627 --> 00:52:22,085
We're gonna have to cut the tour short.

690
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:23,958
We'll pick it up again tomorrow.

691
00:52:24,049 --> 00:52:25,335
Are you sure we have to?

692
00:52:25,425 --> 00:52:27,291
It's not worth taking the chance.

693
00:52:27,385 --> 00:52:28,625
Sustained winds at 45 knots.

694
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,007
Tell them when they get back in the cars.

695
00:52:31,097 --> 00:52:35,762
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle leaving for the dock leaves in five minutes.

696
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,184
Drop what you're doing and leave now.

697
00:52:40,315 --> 00:52:41,601
Damn!

698
00:52:49,282 --> 00:52:51,193
That is one big pile of shit.

699
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:01,158
You're right. There's no trace of lilac berries.

700
00:53:01,252 --> 00:53:03,289
That's so odd, though.

701
00:53:03,755 --> 00:53:07,373
All right, she's suffering from Melia toxicity

702
00:53:09,094 --> 00:53:11,381
every six weeks.

703
00:53:13,014 --> 00:53:16,552
Let's see, rats.

704
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,682
She's tenacious.

705
00:53:21,606 --> 00:53:23,313
You have no idea.

706
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:29,270
You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?

707
00:53:41,543 --> 00:53:45,457
Doctors, if you please, I have to insist that we get moving.

708
00:53:47,882 --> 00:53:51,466
I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish up with the Trike.

709
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,006
Sure. I'm in a gas-powered jeep.

710
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,839
I'll drop her off at the center before I make the boat.

711
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:59,641
Great. Then I'll catch up with you later.

712
00:53:59,727 --> 00:54:00,842
You sure?

713
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:03,679
Yeah, I want to stay with her a little longer.

714
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,184
Okay, then.

715
00:54:19,998 --> 00:54:24,287
There's nothing I can do. The captain says we got to go, we got to go.

716
00:54:24,377 --> 00:54:26,084
You've got to give me the time.

717
00:54:26,171 --> 00:54:29,630
I did a test run, it took me 20 minutes. I think I can push it to 18

718
00:54:29,716 --> 00:54:32,048
but you've got to give me at least 15 minutes.

719
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:33,466
No promises.

720
00:54:41,227 --> 00:54:43,935
Visitor vehicles are returning to the garage.

721
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:51,152
So much for our first tour. Two no-shows and one sick Triceratops.

722
00:54:52,572 --> 00:54:54,279
It could've been worse.

723
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:56,732
A lot worse.

724
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,995
Anybody want a soda or something? I'm going up to the machine.

725
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,242
I thought maybe I'd get somebody something.

726
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:07,076
I've had only sweets and I'm gonna get something salty.

727
00:55:07,921 --> 00:55:10,333
I finished debugging the phones.

728
00:55:11,424 --> 00:55:13,506
I was going to, so I did.

729
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,752
So I debugged the phones. And I thought maybe

730
00:55:16,888 --> 00:55:19,596
I should tell you the system will be compiling

731
00:55:19,724 --> 00:55:22,591
for 18 to 20 minutes, so some of the minor systems,

732
00:55:22,685 --> 00:55:26,599
they might go on and off for a while, but it's nothing to worry about.

733
00:55:48,795 --> 00:55:50,206
Do you got any kids?

734
00:55:50,296 --> 00:55:53,209
Me? Hell, yeah. Three. I love kids.

735
00:55:55,009 --> 00:55:57,376
Anything at all can and does happen.

736
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:00,379
Same with wives, for that matter.

737
00:56:00,807 --> 00:56:02,013
You're married?

738
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,261
Occasionally.

739
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:09,680
I'm always on the lookout for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

740
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:26,489
Five, four, three,

741
00:56:28,459 --> 00:56:29,494
two, one.

742
00:56:37,844 --> 00:56:40,085
-That's odd. -What?

743
00:56:40,346 --> 00:56:42,758
Door security systems are shutting down.

744
00:56:42,849 --> 00:56:46,092
Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?

745
00:57:42,241 --> 00:57:44,357
By the way, Dr. Sattler,

746
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:47,485
she's not available, is she?

747
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,661
Why?

748
00:57:51,584 --> 00:57:53,700
I'm sorry. You two are...

749
00:57:53,795 --> 00:57:54,830
Yeah.

750
00:57:57,757 --> 00:57:59,168
What'd I touch?

751
00:57:59,258 --> 00:58:01,499
You didn't touch anything. We stopped.

752
00:58:10,603 --> 00:58:12,093
What the hell?

753
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:13,188
What now?

754
00:58:13,272 --> 00:58:15,183
Fences are failing all over the park.

755
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:17,770
Find Nedry. Check the vending machines.

756
00:58:49,976 --> 00:58:51,717
Just look at this work station.

757
00:58:51,811 --> 00:58:53,051
What a complete slob.

758
00:58:53,146 --> 00:58:55,433
The Raptor fences aren't out, are they?

759
00:59:02,321 --> 00:59:04,107
No, no. They're still on.

760
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:09,280
Why the hell would he turn the other ones off?

761
00:59:49,368 --> 00:59:51,029
Access main program.

762
00:59:51,871 --> 00:59:53,532
Access main security.

763
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,372
Access main program grid.

764
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:07,216
You didn't say the magic word.

765
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:11,175
Please! God damn it. I hate this hacker crap.

766
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:14,720
Phone Nedry's people in Cambridge.

767
01:00:16,979 --> 01:00:18,515
Phones are out, too.

768
01:00:22,068 --> 01:00:23,979
Where did the vehicles stop?

769
01:00:44,882 --> 01:00:46,589
Their radio's out, too.

770
01:00:46,926 --> 01:00:49,258
Gennaro said to stay put. Kids okay?

771
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:51,461
I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?

772
01:00:51,597 --> 01:00:53,258
Kids get scared. What's scary?

773
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:56,509
It's just a little hiccup in the power. I'm not scared.

774
01:00:56,602 --> 01:00:57,762
I didn't say you were scared.

775
01:00:57,786 --> 01:00:59,072
I know.

776
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,020
Boo!

777
01:01:02,275 --> 01:01:04,607
Hey, where did you find those?

778
01:01:04,777 --> 01:01:06,063
In the box, under my seat.

779
01:01:06,153 --> 01:01:07,439
Are they heavy?

780
01:01:07,655 --> 01:01:10,317
Yeah. Then they're expensive. Put them back.

781
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,122
Don't scare me.

782
01:01:30,678 --> 01:01:32,464
Cool. Night vision.

783
01:01:57,955 --> 01:01:59,366
Did you feel that?

784
01:02:33,366 --> 01:02:35,983
Maybe it's the power trying to come back on.

785
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:39,865
What is that?

786
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,171
Where's the goat?

787
01:03:21,455 --> 01:03:22,695
Jesus!

788
01:03:27,378 --> 01:03:29,164
He left us.

789
01:03:40,641 --> 01:03:43,178
Where does he think he's going?

790
01:03:43,269 --> 01:03:44,976
When you got to go, you got to go.

791
01:04:03,122 --> 01:04:04,408
Dr. Grant.

792
01:04:17,303 --> 01:04:19,419
I hate being right all the time.

793
01:04:28,481 --> 01:04:32,645
Keep absolutely still. Its vision is based on movement.

794
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:48,623
Turn the light off.

795
01:04:53,506 --> 01:04:54,996
Turn the light off!

796
01:05:50,855 --> 01:05:52,311
Hurry! Turn it off!

797
01:05:52,398 --> 01:05:53,729
I'm sorry!

798
01:05:57,903 --> 01:05:59,894
You're the one who turned it...

799
01:07:18,692 --> 01:07:20,023
Ian, freeze!

800
01:07:20,527 --> 01:07:21,983
Get the kids!

801
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:23,905
Get rid of the flare!

802
01:07:23,989 --> 01:07:25,229
Get the kids!

803
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,824
Get rid of the flare!

804
01:07:30,829 --> 01:07:32,319
Hail Mary, full of grace...

805
01:07:50,015 --> 01:07:51,176
No!

806
01:07:55,062 --> 01:07:56,348
Dr. Grant!

807
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:03,526
I'm stuck. The seat's got my feet.

808
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:05,899
I'll get you next. You're okay.

809
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:08,694
You're all right.

810
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:11,026
Tim!

811
01:08:14,707 --> 01:08:17,620
Don't move. He can't see us if we don't move.

812
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:25,107
Lex, you're choking me.

813
01:09:27,946 --> 01:09:29,186
Grab the wire.

814
01:09:48,967 --> 01:09:52,835
"Keycheck space minus 0. Keychecks off, safety space minus 0."

815
01:09:52,971 --> 01:09:56,134
He's turning the safety systems off. Doesn't want anybody to see.

816
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:59,513
Look at this next entry. It's the kicker. "White rabbit object.”

817
01:09:59,645 --> 01:10:01,852
It did it all. With the keychecks off,

818
01:10:01,939 --> 01:10:03,555
the computer didn't file the keystrokes.

819
01:10:03,649 --> 01:10:07,392
The way to find them is to check the computer's lines of code one by one.

820
01:10:07,486 --> 01:10:09,068
How many lines of code are there?

821
01:10:09,154 --> 01:10:10,644
About two million.

822
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,396
Two million? Yeah.

823
01:10:15,327 --> 01:10:19,992
Robert, I wonder if perhaps you would be good enough to take a gas jeep

824
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:23,824
and bring back my grandchildren.

825
01:10:24,711 --> 01:10:25,872
Sure.

826
01:10:28,674 --> 01:10:30,164
I'm going with him.

827
01:10:33,512 --> 01:10:34,673
John.

828
01:10:40,519 --> 01:10:44,228
I can't get Jurassic Park back online without Dennis Nedry.

829
01:10:47,151 --> 01:10:48,767
Should have been there by now.

830
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:05,373
Damn it!

831
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,461
There's the road!

832
01:11:20,058 --> 01:11:24,052
Winch this sucker off the thing and then I tie it to that thing there.

833
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:27,559
I'll pull down this thing here, and pull it back up again.

834
01:11:35,908 --> 01:11:39,321
My glasses. I can afford more glasses!

835
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:11,858
You've got time. You can do it. Do it. Come on, Dennis.

836
01:12:19,284 --> 01:12:20,490
Hello.

837
01:12:25,457 --> 01:12:28,245
Yeah, that's nice. I've got to go.

838
01:12:39,471 --> 01:12:40,802
Nice boy.

839
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:44,507
Nice dinosaur.

840
01:12:45,352 --> 01:12:48,765
Thought you were one of your big brothers. You're not so bad.

841
01:12:48,855 --> 01:12:52,769
What do you want? A little food? Look at me. I just fell down a hill.

842
01:12:52,859 --> 01:12:56,352
I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food. I have nothing on me.

843
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:00,152
Go on. Play fetch?

844
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:03,325
Look, stick.

845
01:13:04,997 --> 01:13:07,159
Look at stick.

846
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:10,996
Stick, stupid. Fetch the stick, boy. Look at the stick.

847
01:13:11,503 --> 01:13:13,835
You like the stick? Go on and get it.

848
01:13:14,006 --> 01:13:15,838
No wonder you're extinct.

849
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:19,754
I'm gonna run you over when I come back down.

850
01:14:35,796 --> 01:14:37,378
Timmy!

851
01:14:41,468 --> 01:14:43,505
Now, Lex. Listen.

852
01:14:44,221 --> 01:14:45,882
Lex, I'm right here.

853
01:14:46,556 --> 01:14:49,048
I'll look after you. I have to help your brother.

854
01:14:49,142 --> 01:14:51,349
Stay right here and wait for me.

855
01:14:51,728 --> 01:14:54,060
He left us.

856
01:14:54,564 --> 01:14:57,056
But that's not what I'm going to do.

857
01:14:59,111 --> 01:15:00,272
Okay?

858
01:15:02,739 --> 01:15:03,854
Stay here.

859
01:15:31,101 --> 01:15:33,012
You hear me? I'm coming up.

860
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:37,688
I hate climbing. I hate trees, way too high.

861
01:16:05,969 --> 01:16:07,050
You okay?

862
01:16:10,056 --> 01:16:11,296
I threw up.

863
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:15,642
That's okay.

864
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:18,312
Just give me your hand.

865
01:16:22,486 --> 01:16:26,525
Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up. Just give me your hand.

866
01:16:35,582 --> 01:16:37,072
Here, I've got you.

867
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:39,871
Okay.

868
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:42,878
That's good. Over the rail.

869
01:16:42,964 --> 01:16:44,125
Don't pull me too hard.

870
01:16:48,678 --> 01:16:50,919
Stand on the door. Hang on to me.

871
01:16:54,559 --> 01:16:57,267
That's not too bad, right, Timmy? Yes, it is.

872
01:16:57,354 --> 01:17:00,062
It's like a tree house. Your dad ever build you one?

873
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:01,684
Yeah, me, too.

874
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,148
The thing about climbing is, you never look down.

875
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:07,820
This is impossible.

876
01:17:08,114 --> 01:17:09,674
How am I going to do this? It's about...

877
01:17:09,698 --> 01:17:12,781
I'm going to help you with your footing.

878
01:17:16,456 --> 01:17:17,571
Oh, no.

879
01:17:18,124 --> 01:17:19,410
Tim, go.

880
01:17:41,773 --> 01:17:43,229
Go, Tim, go!

881
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:52,739
Faster, Tim!

882
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:00,572
Tim, jump!

883
01:18:04,588 --> 01:18:05,669
Go, Tim.

884
01:18:14,139 --> 01:18:16,551
We're back in the car again.

885
01:18:18,768 --> 01:18:20,850
At least you're out of the tree.

886
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:28,692
Where's the other car?

887
01:18:31,114 --> 01:18:32,275
Alan!

888
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:34,648
Dr. Grant!

889
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,837
I think this was Gennaro.

890
01:18:52,928 --> 01:18:54,214
I think this was, too.

891
01:18:57,807 --> 01:18:58,807
I think it's ahead of us.

892
01:18:58,892 --> 01:19:00,348
It could be anywhere.

893
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:03,644
With fences down, it can wander in and out of any paddock it likes.

894
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:12,811
He's put a tourniquet on. Ian.

895
01:19:14,532 --> 01:19:17,240
Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend.

896
01:19:22,248 --> 01:19:23,989
Can we chance moving him?

897
01:19:25,335 --> 01:19:26,791
Please chance it.

898
01:19:35,345 --> 01:19:36,927
Ellie, come on!

899
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:45,719
It's the other car!

900
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:47,554
Dr. Grant?

901
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:53,560
They're not here.

902
01:20:22,934 --> 01:20:24,424
Anybody hear that?

903
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:30,435
It's an impact tremor, is what it is.

904
01:20:31,317 --> 01:20:33,103
I'm fairly alarmed here.

905
01:20:34,571 --> 01:20:38,280
Come on. We've got to get out of here. Now! Right now!

906
01:20:39,075 --> 01:20:40,156
Let's go.

907
01:20:51,629 --> 01:20:52,915
Must go faster.

908
01:20:55,592 --> 01:20:58,425
Here it comes! Stand on it! Fifth gear!

909
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,509
Get off the stick! Bloody move!

910
01:21:06,603 --> 01:21:07,889
Look out!

911
01:21:35,006 --> 01:21:37,338
Think they'll have that on the tour?

912
01:21:45,517 --> 01:21:47,099
Are you hearing this?

913
01:21:53,691 --> 01:21:55,853
Come on, Tim. Hurry up.

914
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:58,527
Let's get up this tree.

915
01:22:01,491 --> 01:22:04,233
Come on, Tim, it's okay. Listen. Try up here.

916
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:07,319
Oh, man.

917
01:22:08,581 --> 01:22:09,912
I hate trees.

918
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:11,789
They don't bother me.

919
01:22:11,876 --> 01:22:14,083
Yeah? Well, you weren't in the last one.

920
01:22:28,726 --> 01:22:32,264
Look at the Brontosauruses. I mean, Brachiosaurus.

921
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:35,226
They're singing.

922
01:23:04,262 --> 01:23:06,299
Don't let the monsters come over here.

923
01:23:06,389 --> 01:23:09,802
They're not monsters, they're animals. These are herbivores.

924
01:23:10,059 --> 01:23:13,427
They only eat vegetables. For you, I think they'd make an exception.

925
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:15,182
I hate the other kind.

926
01:23:17,275 --> 01:23:20,063
They just do what they do.

927
01:23:40,173 --> 01:23:41,379
What's that?

928
01:23:46,596 --> 01:23:50,555
What are you and Ellie going to do now, if you don't dig up bones anymore?

929
01:23:51,976 --> 01:23:53,216
I don't know.

930
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:56,891
I guess we'll just have to evolve, too.

931
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:02,775
What do you call a blind dinosaur?

932
01:24:04,781 --> 01:24:06,988
What do you call a blind dinosaur?

933
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:08,782
"Do-you-think-he-saurus."

934
01:24:12,497 --> 01:24:14,989
What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?

935
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:17,164
You got me.

936
01:24:17,335 --> 01:24:19,417
A "Do-you-think -he-saurus rex."

937
01:24:21,881 --> 01:24:22,916
Alan?

938
01:24:23,007 --> 01:24:24,168
Yeah?

939
01:24:24,842 --> 01:24:28,005
What if the dinosaurs come back while we're all asleep?

940
01:24:30,348 --> 01:24:32,510
I'll stay awake. All night?

941
01:24:35,144 --> 01:24:36,259
All night.

942
01:25:26,529 --> 01:25:28,145
They were all melting.

943
01:25:31,868 --> 01:25:34,986
Malcolm's okay for now. I gave him a shot of morphine.

944
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:40,411
They'll be fine.

945
01:25:41,419 --> 01:25:45,708
Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

946
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:51,919
You know, the first

947
01:25:53,222 --> 01:25:56,681
attraction I ever built when I came down from Scotland

948
01:25:58,353 --> 01:26:00,845
was a flea circus, Petticoat Lane.

949
01:26:02,231 --> 01:26:04,017
Really quite wonderful.

950
01:26:04,609 --> 01:26:07,852
I had a wee trapeze and a

951
01:26:11,074 --> 01:26:12,280
carousel

952
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:17,615
and a seesaw.

953
01:26:18,748 --> 01:26:20,955
They all move motorized, of course.

954
01:26:21,292 --> 01:26:23,954
People said they saw the fleas. "I can see the fleas.

955
01:26:24,087 --> 01:26:25,794
"Can't you see the fleas?"

956
01:26:26,589 --> 01:26:30,878
Clown fleas, high-wire fleas, and fleas on parade.

957
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,556
With this place,

958
01:26:40,645 --> 01:26:44,058
I wanted to show them something that wasn't an illusion.

959
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:48,149
Something that was real. Something that they could

960
01:26:51,322 --> 01:26:52,778
see and touch.

961
01:26:57,495 --> 01:26:59,953
An aim not devoid of merit.

962
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:08,078
But you can't think through this one, John. You have to feel it.

963
01:27:10,299 --> 01:27:12,006
You're absolutely right.

964
01:27:13,845 --> 01:27:16,177
Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.

965
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:18,926
We're over-dependent on automation, I can see that now.

966
01:27:19,016 --> 01:27:21,678
Next time, everything's correctable.

967
01:27:22,478 --> 01:27:25,687
Creation is an act of sheer will.

968
01:27:28,025 --> 01:27:29,982
Next time, it'll be flawless.

969
01:27:30,528 --> 01:27:33,862
It's still the flea circus. It's all an illusion.

970
01:27:34,031 --> 01:27:35,521
When we have control...

971
01:27:35,616 --> 01:27:38,278
You've never had control! That's the illusion.

972
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:41,115
I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.

973
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,951
I made a mistake, too.

974
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:47,875
I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.

975
01:27:50,506 --> 01:27:53,669
The only thing that matters now are the people we love.

976
01:27:55,845 --> 01:27:57,961
Alan and Lex and Tim.

977
01:27:59,557 --> 01:28:02,720
John, they're out there, where people are dying.

978
01:28:19,744 --> 01:28:20,905
It's good.

979
01:28:24,874 --> 01:28:26,330
Spared no expense.

980
01:28:53,694 --> 01:28:54,694
Go away!

981
01:28:54,779 --> 01:28:56,861
It's okay. It's a Brachiosaurus.

982
01:28:57,532 --> 01:29:00,194
It's a "Veggie-saurus", Lex. "Veggie-saurus."

983
01:29:00,743 --> 01:29:01,949
Veggie.

984
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:04,611
Come on. Come on, girl.

985
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:10,241
Come on, baby.

986
01:29:13,714 --> 01:29:15,125
Go.

987
01:29:16,634 --> 01:29:18,124
I'm not letting go.

988
01:29:30,106 --> 01:29:31,226
It looks like it has a cold.

989
01:29:31,315 --> 01:29:32,931
Yeah. Maybe.

990
01:29:33,317 --> 01:29:34,933
Can I touch it? Sure.

991
01:29:35,278 --> 01:29:38,316
Just think of it as kind of a big cow.

992
01:29:41,659 --> 01:29:42,899
I like cows.

993
01:29:52,962 --> 01:29:55,294
Come on, girl. Come on up here, girl.

994
01:30:02,722 --> 01:30:04,008
God bless you.

995
01:30:09,353 --> 01:30:11,344
Yuck. Great.

996
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:13,396
Now she'll never try anything new.

997
01:30:13,858 --> 01:30:16,850
She'll sit in her room, never come out, play on her computer.

998
01:30:16,986 --> 01:30:17,986
I'm a hacker.

999
01:30:18,029 --> 01:30:19,736
That's what I said. You're a nerd.

1000
01:30:19,864 --> 01:30:21,354
I am not a computer nerd.

1001
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:23,065
I prefer to be called a hacker.

1002
01:30:23,326 --> 01:30:24,532
God.

1003
01:30:29,373 --> 01:30:31,034
You know what this is?

1004
01:30:32,918 --> 01:30:34,909
It's a dinosaur egg.

1005
01:30:35,671 --> 01:30:38,880
The dinosaurs are breeding.

1006
01:30:42,053 --> 01:30:46,092
But my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.

1007
01:30:47,516 --> 01:30:49,723
Amphibian DNA. What's that?

1008
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,557
Well, on the tour,

1009
01:30:53,773 --> 01:30:58,563
the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.

1010
01:30:58,736 --> 01:31:02,070
They mutated the dinosaur genetic code

1011
01:31:03,074 --> 01:31:05,361
and blended it with that of frogs.

1012
01:31:08,245 --> 01:31:12,705
Some West African frogs have been known to change sex from male to female

1013
01:31:12,792 --> 01:31:14,874
in a single sex environment.

1014
01:31:16,754 --> 01:31:18,244
Malcolm was right.

1015
01:31:19,799 --> 01:31:20,960
Look.

1016
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,307
Life found a way.

1017
01:31:33,646 --> 01:31:36,229
No. That's crazy. You're out of your mind.

1018
01:31:36,315 --> 01:31:38,272
He's absolutely out of his mind.

1019
01:31:38,943 --> 01:31:41,105
Wait. What exactly would this mean?

1020
01:31:41,237 --> 01:31:43,228
We're talking about a calculated risk,

1021
01:31:43,322 --> 01:31:45,063
which is the only option left to us.

1022
01:31:45,157 --> 01:31:49,617
We'll never find the command Nedry used. He's covered his tracks far too well.

1023
01:31:50,121 --> 01:31:52,954
I think it's obvious now that he's not coming back.

1024
01:31:53,082 --> 01:31:55,540
So, shutting down the entire system...

1025
01:31:55,626 --> 01:31:57,583
Get somebody else. I won't do it.

1026
01:31:57,670 --> 01:32:02,665
Shutting down the system is the only way to wipe out everything he did.

1027
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:07,586
Now, as I understand it, all the systems will then come back

1028
01:32:07,763 --> 01:32:10,471
on their original start-up mode. Correct?

1029
01:32:10,683 --> 01:32:13,971
Theoretically, yes. We've never shut down the entire system before.

1030
01:32:14,103 --> 01:32:15,309
It may not come back on.

1031
01:32:15,396 --> 01:32:17,057
Would we get the phones back?

1032
01:32:17,148 --> 01:32:18,809
Yes, again, in theory.

1033
01:32:19,442 --> 01:32:21,274
What about the lysine contingency?

1034
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:22,816
We could put that into effect.

1035
01:32:22,945 --> 01:32:23,945
What's that?

1036
01:32:23,988 --> 01:32:25,729
That's absolutely out of the question.

1037
01:32:25,823 --> 01:32:28,656
The lysine contingency prevents the spread of animals,

1038
01:32:28,784 --> 01:32:30,616
if they ever get off the island.

1039
01:32:30,703 --> 01:32:34,367
Wu inserted a gene that creates a faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.

1040
01:32:34,498 --> 01:32:37,365
The animals can't manufacture the amino acid, lysine.

1041
01:32:37,501 --> 01:32:41,210
Unless they're supplied with lysine by us, they slip into a coma and die.

1042
01:32:41,338 --> 01:32:43,796
People are dying.

1043
01:32:48,012 --> 01:32:50,344
Will you please shut down the system?

1044
01:33:12,369 --> 01:33:14,030
Hold on to your butts.

1045
01:33:33,891 --> 01:33:35,006
It's okay.

1046
01:33:35,142 --> 01:33:37,804
Look, see that? It's on. It worked.

1047
01:33:40,314 --> 01:33:42,681
What do you mean it worked? Everything's off.

1048
01:33:42,775 --> 01:33:44,391
Shutdown tripped the circuit breakers.

1049
01:33:44,485 --> 01:33:46,897
Turn them back on, reboot a few systems:

1050
01:33:46,987 --> 01:33:50,355
telephones, security doors, half dozen others, but it worked.

1051
01:33:50,449 --> 01:33:52,531
System's ready. Where are the breakers?

1052
01:33:52,618 --> 01:33:54,655
Maintenance shed at the end of the compound.

1053
01:33:54,745 --> 01:33:57,487
Three minutes, I'll have the power back on in the park.

1054
01:33:57,581 --> 01:34:00,664
Just to be safe, I want everybody in the emergency bunker

1055
01:34:00,751 --> 01:34:04,085
until Mr. Arnold returns, and the whole system's running again.

1056
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:04,664
I'm tired. I'm dirty.

1057
01:34:04,672 --> 01:34:05,833
I'm tired. I'm dirty.

1058
01:34:05,923 --> 01:34:07,288
I'm hot.

1059
01:34:07,508 --> 01:34:11,251
Looking at the map, I'd say the visitor's center is just a mile

1060
01:34:11,929 --> 01:34:15,217
over that rise there. Just keep...

1061
01:34:18,102 --> 01:34:19,592
What is that?

1062
01:34:21,897 --> 01:34:24,104
Tim, can you tell me what they are?

1063
01:34:25,484 --> 01:34:26,815
They are

1064
01:34:31,156 --> 01:34:32,396
Gallimimus.

1065
01:34:32,491 --> 01:34:34,983
Are those meat-eating?

1066
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:38,031
"Meat-asauruses"?

1067
01:34:42,918 --> 01:34:45,376
Look at the wheeling. Uniform direction changes.

1068
01:34:45,462 --> 01:34:48,124
Just like a flock of birds evading a predator.

1069
01:34:49,633 --> 01:34:52,796
They're flocking this way.

1070
01:35:35,763 --> 01:35:36,763
I want to go now.

1071
01:35:36,847 --> 01:35:37,928
Just look how it eats.

1072
01:35:38,015 --> 01:35:39,301
Please.

1073
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:42,175
I bet you'll never look at birds the same way again.

1074
01:35:42,269 --> 01:35:44,351
Yes. Go now.

1075
01:35:46,190 --> 01:35:48,852
Okay. Keep low and follow me.

1076
01:35:51,278 --> 01:35:53,019
Look how much blood.

1077
01:35:55,282 --> 01:35:57,364
God. Something went wrong.

1078
01:35:58,285 --> 01:36:01,823
Something's happened. Something's wrong.

1079
01:36:04,541 --> 01:36:06,123
This is just a delay.

1080
01:36:06,210 --> 01:36:09,293
That's all it is. All major theme parks have delays.

1081
01:36:09,546 --> 01:36:13,881
When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked.

1082
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:16,633
If the Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down,

1083
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:17,960
the pirates don't eat tourists.

1084
01:36:18,055 --> 01:36:21,514
I can't wait any more. Something's wrong.

1085
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:22,965
I'm gonna go get the power back on.

1086
01:36:23,227 --> 01:36:26,345
You can't just stroll down the road, you know?

1087
01:36:26,522 --> 01:36:29,810
Don't let's be too hasty. I mean, it's only been gone...

1088
01:36:32,486 --> 01:36:34,523
I'm going with you. Okay.

1089
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:51,376
Sorry.

1090
01:36:55,217 --> 01:36:59,427
Now, this isn't going to be just like switching on the kitchen light.

1091
01:36:59,596 --> 01:37:02,930
But I think I can follow this and then talk you through it.

1092
01:37:07,396 --> 01:37:08,602
Right.

1093
01:37:14,611 --> 01:37:16,602
But it ought to be me, really, going.

1094
01:37:16,739 --> 01:37:17,739
Why?

1095
01:37:17,781 --> 01:37:19,613
I'm a... And you're a...

1096
01:37:21,076 --> 01:37:23,363
Look. Come on, let's go.

1097
01:37:23,454 --> 01:37:26,697
We can discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.

1098
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:30,454
You just take me through this step by step. I'm on Channel 2.

1099
01:37:30,544 --> 01:37:31,579
Right.

1100
01:38:07,456 --> 01:38:10,164
The shutdown must've turned off all the fences.

1101
01:38:10,834 --> 01:38:14,498
Damn it, even Nedry knew better than to mess with the Raptor pen.

1102
01:38:20,177 --> 01:38:21,417
Come on, this way.

1103
01:38:29,144 --> 01:38:31,101
I can see the shed from here.

1104
01:38:31,313 --> 01:38:33,020
We can make it if we run.

1105
01:38:33,357 --> 01:38:35,940
No. We can't.

1106
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:38,146
Why not?

1107
01:38:38,654 --> 01:38:40,565
Because we're being hunted.

1108
01:38:41,907 --> 01:38:43,898
In the bushes, straight ahead.

1109
01:38:46,537 --> 01:38:47,868
It's all right.

1110
01:38:48,413 --> 01:38:49,824
Like hell it is.

1111
01:38:51,166 --> 01:38:54,329
Run. Towards the shed.

1112
01:38:56,547 --> 01:38:58,003
I've got her.

1113
01:38:58,924 --> 01:39:00,414
Go. Now!

1114
01:39:19,611 --> 01:39:21,022
Mr. Arnold?

1115
01:39:26,368 --> 01:39:27,574
John, I'm in.

1116
01:39:28,203 --> 01:39:29,409
Great.

1117
01:39:30,706 --> 01:39:34,199
Ahead of you is a metal staircase. Go down it.

1118
01:39:35,252 --> 01:39:37,539
Okay. Going down.

1119
01:39:38,422 --> 01:39:42,165
After 20 or 30 feet you come to a T-junction. Take a left.

1120
01:39:42,259 --> 01:39:43,499
Have her follow the main cable.

1121
01:39:43,523 --> 01:39:45,434
I know how to read a schematic.

1122
01:40:15,751 --> 01:40:17,958
I guess that means the power's off.

1123
01:40:31,183 --> 01:40:32,548
That's not funny.

1124
01:40:32,643 --> 01:40:33,804
That was great.

1125
01:40:36,313 --> 01:40:38,270
Well, maybe we, we could...

1126
01:40:56,124 --> 01:40:58,616
Damn it. Dead end.

1127
01:40:59,002 --> 01:41:00,208
Wait a minute.

1128
01:41:01,797 --> 01:41:05,040
There should have been a right turn back there somewhere.

1129
01:41:06,009 --> 01:41:07,625
Look above you.

1130
01:41:08,512 --> 01:41:12,346
There should be a bundle of cable and pipes all heading in the same direction.

1131
01:41:12,474 --> 01:41:13,635
Follow that.

1132
01:41:14,309 --> 01:41:16,471
Okay. Following the piping.

1133
01:41:19,147 --> 01:41:23,562
I bet I could climb over to the other side before you could even get to the top.

1134
01:41:23,694 --> 01:41:24,934
What would you give me?

1135
01:41:25,028 --> 01:41:26,063
Respect.

1136
01:41:26,989 --> 01:41:29,026
Come on, guys, it's not a race.

1137
01:41:30,701 --> 01:41:31,907
I see the box.

1138
01:41:33,704 --> 01:41:36,696
It says, "High Voltage." Yeah.

1139
01:41:39,751 --> 01:41:40,912
Okay.

1140
01:41:44,881 --> 01:41:47,543
Good. Here we go.

1141
01:41:48,218 --> 01:41:49,379
Over the top.

1142
01:41:50,053 --> 01:41:51,669
Take your time.

1143
01:41:52,681 --> 01:41:54,217
Good. Come on.

1144
01:41:54,391 --> 01:41:56,348
Find your footing.

1145
01:41:58,562 --> 01:42:01,270
You can't throw the main switch by hand.

1146
01:42:01,398 --> 01:42:04,766
You've got to pump up the primer handle in order to get the charge.

1147
01:42:04,901 --> 01:42:07,233
It's large, flat, and gray.

1148
01:42:08,030 --> 01:42:09,896
All right, here I go. Okay?

1149
01:42:11,491 --> 01:42:16,577
One, two, three, four.

1150
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:18,621
Okay, charged.

1151
01:42:19,374 --> 01:42:23,117
Under the words "Contact Position," there's a round green button

1152
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:25,752
which says "Push to Close."

1153
01:42:26,298 --> 01:42:28,130
Push to close.

1154
01:42:31,636 --> 01:42:32,922
Push it.

1155
01:42:47,861 --> 01:42:51,820
The red buttons turn on the individual park systems.

1156
01:42:52,699 --> 01:42:53,985
Switch them on.

1157
01:43:05,504 --> 01:43:06,504
Get down now!

1158
01:43:06,588 --> 01:43:07,703
You're gonna have to jump.

1159
01:43:07,798 --> 01:43:09,630
You crazy? I'm not gonna jump.

1160
01:43:09,716 --> 01:43:10,956
Do what Dr. Grant says!

1161
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:12,337
Let go. I'll count to three.

1162
01:43:12,469 --> 01:43:14,836
One, two, three!

1163
01:43:15,806 --> 01:43:18,173
Four. Five.

1164
01:43:18,975 --> 01:43:20,682
I'm coming up to get you.

1165
01:43:20,811 --> 01:43:22,301
I've got to get Tim.

1166
01:43:22,479 --> 01:43:24,140
Okay. I'm gonna count to three.

1167
01:43:27,025 --> 01:43:28,231
One,

1168
01:43:29,986 --> 01:43:31,067
two...

1169
01:43:42,165 --> 01:43:43,655
He's not breathing.

1170
01:43:48,588 --> 01:43:51,000
I think we're back in business!

1171
01:43:59,224 --> 01:44:00,680
No!

1172
01:45:30,774 --> 01:45:32,014
Clever girl.

1173
01:45:56,341 --> 01:45:57,627
No, Tim!

1174
01:46:00,387 --> 01:46:02,298
Good boy.

1175
01:46:06,851 --> 01:46:08,057
Three.

1176
01:46:13,233 --> 01:46:14,314
Hello?

1177
01:46:24,494 --> 01:46:27,907
Okay. I'm gonna have to find the others.

1178
01:46:28,999 --> 01:46:31,741
Get you to a doctor.

1179
01:46:33,795 --> 01:46:36,082
Lex, you look after Tim. Yeah.

1180
01:46:37,382 --> 01:46:39,339
Your hair is all sticking up.

1181
01:46:41,344 --> 01:46:43,631
Big Tim, the human piece of toast.

1182
01:46:47,934 --> 01:46:50,096
I'll be back soon. I promise.

1183
01:47:17,422 --> 01:47:18,537
Run.

1184
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:36,952
Just the two Raptors, right?

1185
01:48:38,461 --> 01:48:40,327
You sure the third one's contained?

1186
01:48:40,422 --> 01:48:44,006
Yes, unless they figure out how to open doors.

1187
01:49:10,618 --> 01:49:12,450
What is it?

1188
01:49:12,537 --> 01:49:13,902
It's a Velociraptor.

1189
01:49:16,583 --> 01:49:18,073
It's inside.

1190
01:49:43,651 --> 01:49:44,732
Follow me.

1191
01:52:20,308 --> 01:52:21,548
It's in there.

1192
01:52:22,435 --> 01:52:23,675
Control room.

1193
01:52:30,088 --> 01:52:31,169
We can call for help?

1194
01:52:31,194 --> 01:52:33,526
We've got to reboot the system first.

1195
01:52:36,470 --> 01:52:37,756
The door locks!

1196
01:52:38,701 --> 01:52:40,738
Ellie, boot up the door locks!

1197
01:52:49,921 --> 01:52:51,753
No, boot up the door locks!

1198
01:52:52,799 --> 01:52:54,978
Get back! Boot up the door locks.

1199
01:52:55,003 --> 01:52:56,744
You can't hold it by yourself!

1200
01:53:05,394 --> 01:53:08,554
It's a UNIX system. I know this.

1201
01:53:09,315 --> 01:53:11,397
It's all the files of the whole park.

1202
01:53:11,484 --> 01:53:15,230
It tells you everything. I've got to find the right file.

1203
01:53:15,787 --> 01:53:17,369
Try to reach the gun.

1204
01:53:25,847 --> 01:53:27,804
I can't get it unless I move.

1205
01:53:43,266 --> 01:53:45,679
This is it. This might be the right file.

1206
01:54:01,777 --> 01:54:03,158
-You got it! -Yes!

1207
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:09,721
Yes! Yes!

1208
01:54:09,952 --> 01:54:11,053
This is it!

1209
01:54:13,946 --> 01:54:14,981
What works?

1210
01:54:15,006 --> 01:54:18,186
All security systems are enabled. We got it.

1211
01:54:27,988 --> 01:54:29,194
Grant.

1212
01:54:29,228 --> 01:54:32,318
Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.

1213
01:54:32,427 --> 01:54:33,808
The children all right?

1214
01:54:34,155 --> 01:54:35,486
The children are fine.

1215
01:54:35,824 --> 01:54:39,658
Call the mainland. Tell them to send the damn helicopters.

1216
01:54:40,114 --> 01:54:42,276
It's gonna cut through the glass!

1217
01:55:34,001 --> 01:55:35,162
Move!

1218
01:56:20,715 --> 01:56:23,252
Tim, let go. Yeah!

1219
01:57:40,628 --> 01:57:44,917
After careful consideration, I've decided not to endorse your park.

1220
01:57:45,675 --> 01:57:47,086
So have I.

1221
01:58:34,682 --> 01:58:35,717
Come on.
