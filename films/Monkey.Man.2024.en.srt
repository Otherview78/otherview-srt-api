1
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:10,734
Do you know the
story of Hanuman?

2
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:11,872
Mm-mm.

3
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:13,150
No?

4
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:15,290
Look at this.

5
00:01:16,947 --> 00:01:18,569
Look.

6
00:01:18,707 --> 00:01:20,399
The story goes...

7
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:22,608
When Hanuman was little...

8
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:24,023
Very little...

9
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:26,612
He was very hungry.

10
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,200
So hungry.

11
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,338
Just like you!

12
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:35,207
He could have eaten any
fruit in the forest.

13
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,382
But something cast
a spell on him.

14
00:01:40,212 --> 00:01:41,937
High above the trees.

15
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:45,078
It was a big juicy mango.

16
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:46,804
So shiny.

17
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:49,462
Look at this.

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,015
Do you know what he did?

19
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:57,263
Hanuman took to the skies.

20
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:01,888
Straight towards that fruit.

21
00:02:03,096 --> 00:02:05,306
That juicy mango.

22
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,756
So shiny.

23
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,899
Only to discover

24
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:14,832
that it wasn"t a mango

25
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:20,183
but the burning, hot sun.

26
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,875
The gods heard of this,

27
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:25,291
and gathered to punish him.

28
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:29,571
They taught him a lesson,

29
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:34,749
and stripped young
Hanuman of his powers.

30
00:02:37,165 --> 00:02:39,236
And then what happened, Ma?

31
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:47,382
There are no fucking rules!

32
00:02:48,072 --> 00:02:50,213
Fight!

33
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,755
Sir, Tiger, sir.

34
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,450
CROWD [chanting]: King Kobra!
King Kobra! King Kobra!

35
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:59,316
Tiger, I love you!

36
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:00,983
CROWD [chanting]: King
Kobra! King Kobra!

37
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:05,702
King Kobra! King Kobra!
King Kobra! King Kobra!

38
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,393
Whoo!

39
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:09,464
Good evening.

40
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:11,742
That "s what I" m talking about.

41
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,986
Welcome to Tiger"s Temple.

42
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:16,678
This is a sacred space.

43
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:19,302
Because some of us
here are Muslim.

44
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,889
Some of us are Hindu.

45
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,581
Fuck, maybe there"s
a closet Christian

46
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:24,859
hiding somewhere there
under the rafters.

47
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:31,831
But we here all worship one god:

48
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:33,799
The Indian rupee!

49
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:44,775
The winner, the
killer of the beast,

50
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:48,952
King Kobra!

51
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,851
Look at this maderchod.
Look at this.

52
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:55,061
That"s the smell of
victory right there.

53
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,478
Do you smell it?

54
00:04:57,616 --> 00:04:59,928
"Cause I fucking smell it!"

55
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,034
This is a champion. This is...

56
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:18,835
Fucking hell, guys.
What a night, eh?

57
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:23,080
You hear that? They
fucking hate you.

58
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:25,358
It"s incredible.

59
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:26,808
What a night.

60
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:28,707
Sarishan, what"s
this fucking stomach?

61
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:30,536
Too many samosas.
You"re the Lizard King,

62
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:32,573
not the fucking
Samosa King, okay?

63
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:34,229
This fucking tap!

64
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:36,956
Aziz, the fucking tap came
off in my hands again, man.

65
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:37,854
Come here.

66
00:06:37,992 --> 00:06:39,683
Look here. What"s that?

67
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:41,834
That fucking stays on. You know
what my water bill is for that?

68
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:42,978
Fix the fucking tap. Please.

69
00:06:43,031 --> 00:06:44,688
Aziz, just fix it,
brother. Please.

70
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:46,355
I ask just for a little
bit of fucking cleanliness.

71
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,209
A little bit of personal
hygiene. Yes, what?

72
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:51,177
Yeah. All right.

73
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:54,318
Don"t spend it all at once, eh?

74
00:06:55,078 --> 00:06:57,494
Tiger. Tiger, this is half.

75
00:06:57,632 --> 00:06:59,082
What? That"s what
you got last time.

76
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,498
What, are you saving for
a better place to live?

77
00:07:01,636 --> 00:07:02,982
You want another 50%, you bleed.

78
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,571
That "s why it" s
called the bleed bonus.

79
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:09,126
I need that money.

80
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:12,958
Then dance.

81
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:15,270
Don"t look at me like that.

82
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:16,582
You chose the name.

83
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,040
You"re like those
little monkeys,

84
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:19,723
you know, in the
marketplace that go

85
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:21,345
with a little pink skirt.

86
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:22,761
That"s you.

87
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:24,072
Put on a show, get the money.

88
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,610
There"s hundreds
of folks out there

89
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,144
that"ll do this, eh... hundreds

90
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:31,079
waiting to take your place
if this isn"t for you.

91
00:07:33,323 --> 00:07:36,982
To live eternal, and
gain immortality.

92
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,984
A sacred gift of the
Gods, from Baba Shakti.

93
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:41,055
REPORTER [over TV, in
English]: <i>Baba Shakti.</i>

94
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:44,092
<i>"Guru, man of peace,
the nation" s lion.</i>

95
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,819
<i>Born to poverty but
not held captive by it.</i>

96
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:49,408
<i>Indeed, Baba Shakti is
now likely to be seen</i>

97
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:50,961
<i>in the temples of the elite</i>

98
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:52,791
<i>than at the temples of the gods,</i>

99
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:55,034
<i>rubbing shoulders with
the rich and powerful.</i>

100
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:57,796
<i>Are these the simple actions
of a man made good...</i>

101
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:00,108
I leave politics
to the politicians.

102
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,248
<i>Or the start of a push
for political power</i>

103
00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:04,146
<i>through his endorsement
of the controversial.</i>

104
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,424
<i>Sovereign Party?</i>

105
00:08:05,562 --> 00:08:07,426
If I see a God-fearing man

106
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:10,118
who is doing good for
India, I will support him.

107
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,707
<i>He has dismissed rumors
that his factory...</i>

108
00:08:12,845 --> 00:08:14,433
Lucky, how"s things?

109
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:16,573
First class, bro.

110
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:18,886
Boss, get him a Mango Frooti.

111
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:21,060
Eh! Make it a double.

112
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,615
So?

113
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:33,659
Lucky, Lucky, Lucky.

114
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:41,633
This is who you want.

115
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,532
Queenie Kapoor,
the queen of Kings.

116
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,846
Friday afternoon,
she had a massage

117
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:50,745
and pedicure at Body Tonic.

118
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:52,229
Most of the mornings,

119
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,784
she stops at a Café
d"Italia for coffee.

120
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:56,509
- D"Italia?
- Yeah.

121
00:08:56,648 --> 00:08:59,029
She"ll be there tomorrow.

122
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:01,514
But good luck getting
anything out of her.

123
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:02,930
She"s a real hard-ass.

124
00:09:07,072 --> 00:09:08,314
Ayurvedic wisdom - Okay.

125
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:10,972
- Is thousands of years old.
- Good job.

126
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,251
Who are we to question the gods?

127
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:20,361
Vishnu, Lakshmi, Shiva!
For fifty rupees.

128
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:23,364
QUEENIE [in English]: Yes. On
the dinner table, it was like

129
00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:25,055
a verbal contract.

130
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,473
I don"t have any mail.

131
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,752
Please, madam, I haven"t
eaten in two days.

132
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,339
Please, please, madam.

133
00:09:33,477 --> 00:09:36,342
Please, please, madam.

134
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,448
I"m... Ow!

135
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:42,003
Oh, my God. How can you
allow these guys here?

136
00:09:42,141 --> 00:09:44,005

Yeah?

164
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:42,261
Where did you find this?

165
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,576
Some men were fighting over
it next to, uh, JV Road

166
00:11:46,714 --> 00:11:48,371
near Café d"Italia.

167
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:51,892
I tried to rush in, and, uh, um

168
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,135
they fought back and, uh...

169
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:55,758
- Take this.
- I-I...

170
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:57,967
I don "t... I don"
t want charity.

171
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:01,902
Wh-What I need is a... is a job.

172
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,317
This is Kings.

173
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,146
We just don"t hire
off the street.

174
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:06,527
Where"s your references?

175
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:10,255
Your CV? Hmm?

176
00:12:10,393 --> 00:12:12,602
Look, I don"t have
time for all this.

177
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,397
Take it and go.

178
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:17,503
This.

179
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,783
There"s my CV.

180
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:22,301
That"s bleach.

181
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,339
Chemical, oil.

182
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,101
Give me the job no
one wants to do.

183
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:31,724
I"ll do it.

184
00:12:31,863 --> 00:12:33,968
No complaint.

185
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:37,075
This is all I know.

186
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:52,987
Yeah.

187
00:12:53,746 --> 00:12:54,989
No. Uh, no, no. Listen.

188
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:58,061
I actually liked this
one from Indonesia.

189
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:00,512
Is she broken in?

190
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,895
No, th-that"s fine, but I
just want to know if, uh...

191
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,620
How quickly can
we get her papers?

192
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,933
Hmm?

193
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,917
Anyone who talks
outside these walls,

194
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,471
anyone who forgets their place,

195
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:31,060
it doesn"t turn
out well for them.

196
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,270
Understood?

197
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,480
Understood.

198
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:52,081
Once more.

199
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:55,291
Oh God, I worship you.

200
00:13:56,223 --> 00:13:58,777
I only worship you.

201
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:01,504
You are the most powerful one.

202
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:04,024
You are my saviour.

203
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,959
I only worship you.

204
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:14,310
You make us smile and
fill our hearts with love.

205
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:17,209
With our eyes, with our ears.

206
00:14:17,347 --> 00:14:20,247
On our lips, we say your name.

207
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:25,114
I sing your praise,
day and night.

208
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:29,842
I worship you.

209
00:14:47,515 --> 00:14:49,517
New guy, huh?

210
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:52,555
What"s your name?

211
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:56,869
Bobby.

212
00:14:57,008 --> 00:14:58,216
Hmm.

213
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:08,191
Wear your cap properly.

214
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:11,229
We don"t want one of your
pubes in the curry...

215
00:15:13,196 --> 00:15:14,853
Bobby.

216
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:16,613
I think we met before, right?

217
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:18,995
I-I don"t think so.

218
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:22,378
You like tequila, huh, Bobby?

219
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:27,072
Patrón, Don Julio, the one with
George Clooney in the photo?

220
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,901
I just want to clean
the dishes, okay?

221
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,627
Coke? Morphine? MDMA?

222
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:33,630
Oi, Alphonso, eh, I"ve
told you many times

223
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:34,977
to stop hassling my staff.

224
00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:37,220
Quality control, man.

225
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:40,154
You"re gonna thank
me for this one day.

226
00:15:42,122 --> 00:15:44,262
Stay cool, Bobby.

227
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,540
Stay cool, hmm?

228
00:15:48,818 --> 00:15:50,993
Watch my fucking leg, man.

229
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:24,302
One regular paan.

230
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:38,557
And a Raju Special.

231
00:16:44,943 --> 00:16:46,151
Lion!

232
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,772
Yes.

233
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:49,706
Take him.

234
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:51,156
Can I go on his shoulders?

235
00:16:51,294 --> 00:16:53,538
How about a rickshaw,
little bastard? Take him!

236
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:56,748
Solid.

237
00:16:56,886 --> 00:16:58,508
Come.

238
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:22,394
What you got?

239
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:25,225
Paan.

240
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:27,191
Get inside.

241
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:42,276
Is this all you got?

242
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:45,037
Yeah.

243
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,666
Are you sure?

244
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:56,842
"Cause I got an answer
to every prayer.

245
00:17:58,223 --> 00:18:00,846
You like <i>John Wick?</i>
"Cause this just came in."

246
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:04,126
Yeah.

247
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:06,128
The TTI.

248
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:08,233
Same gun from the movie.

249
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:10,684
But made in China.

250
00:18:12,996 --> 00:18:14,377
Boom.

251
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,864
I want something
small but effective.

252
00:18:19,658 --> 00:18:21,281
38 caliber revolver.

253
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:25,008
It"s a little bit heavy,
but it"s got a lot of thump.

254
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,287
You need to be pretty close.

255
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:30,635
Close is good.

256
00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:36,227
I"ll take it.

257
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:41,611
Staff entrance. Copy.

258
00:18:41,749 --> 00:18:43,924
MAN [over radio]: Copy.
Staff entrance secured.

259
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:51,483
Huh?

260
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:53,278
You want to go back
to selling your ass

261
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,797
on the street for 500 rupees?

262
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:57,179
I brought you in, and
this is how you repay me?

263
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:58,628
Huh?

264
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:00,492
Okay, okay. Don"t cry.

265
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,149
Don"t cry.

266
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:05,635
As soon as Dr. Irani"s
back, we"ll take care of it.

267
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:06,878
Yeah?

268
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:09,605
You"re fucking
killing me, Rahul.

269
00:19:09,743 --> 00:19:12,021
No, no, no. Uh-uh.

270
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:13,471
Listen to me...

271
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:15,921
You call Evgeni and
tell that motherfucker

272
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:18,545
to find another source.

273
00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:20,616
I made you!

274
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:22,456
Now you think you can sit on my
shoulders and piss in my ear?

275
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,895
They"re fuck all. Fuck all.

276
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:25,862
Fuck all. You
understand "fuck all"?

277
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,727
No, no, no. No,
no. Listen, listen.

278
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:31,109
I have a reputation to
protect, understand?

279
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:32,455
What the fuck is your problem?

280
00:19:32,593 --> 00:19:34,043
How many times do
I have to tell you

281
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:36,252
fucking knock on the
door and enter...

282
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,710
Sorry. Nishit said
you needed me.

283
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,393
I need you to
learn some manners,

284
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:40,981
you inbred little goat fucker.

285
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,915
Rahul, I"ll have
to call you back.

286
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:45,537
Listen, go to Naqeeb

287
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:47,032
and pick up some
Kashmiri snowflake.

288
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:49,679
Good stuff, okay? None
of that cheap shit.

289
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,977
But the problem is, uh,
quality control, it"s no good.

290
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:53,856
Naqeeb has some issue
with me, you know?

291
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:55,765
I don "t know whether it" s
the Christian-Muslim thing

292
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:57,169
- or what, but...
- Hey.

293
00:19:57,308 --> 00:20:00,276
You. Face the wall.

294
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:06,627
What the fuck are
you talking about?

295
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:08,560
Tell Naqeeb, if
the maal is good,

296
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:11,391
we"ll buy some more
for Chief Rana.

297
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,186
Get it sorted by the weekend.

298
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:16,396
He is coming with his boys.

299
00:20:16,534 --> 00:20:18,087
- Hey, Alphonso.
- Hmm?

300
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:20,262
Only the best to serve the VIPs.

301
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,540
Yeah. Got it.

302
00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:26,302
Alphonso. Alphonso.

303
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,961
Hey, uh, good job with Queenie,
huh? She really respects you.

304
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:31,099
What do you want?

305
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:34,586
Um, look, if you... if you...

306
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:36,392
Look, if you need any
help with the VIPs...

307
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,934
Hey, new guy...

308
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:40,282
You know what happens
to earwigs around here?

309
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,052
You hear nothing, you
see nothing. Got it?

310
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:44,251
Look, I"m just saying, if
you need someone to go in

311
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:45,677
- and do the job...
- Does it look like

312
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:47,126
I need some help from
someone like you?

313
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,186
- Hey.
- Is there so...

314
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:49,325
What the fuck, man?

315
00:20:49,463 --> 00:20:50,740
Okay, okay. I"m sorry.

316
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:53,847
Look, you want to
make some money?

317
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:56,263
Guaranteed?

318
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:57,954
- Go on.
- Okay.

319
00:20:59,128 --> 00:21:00,543
Uh.

320
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:03,166
Come to this place tonight.

321
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,620
Bet on Khan. You"ll
make a killing.

322
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:14,488
How the fuck do you know?

323
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,733
I-I"ll be fighting him.

324
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:25,361
Fuck off.

325
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:27,915
The monkey will win
the first two rounds

326
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,504
and go down in the third.

327
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:32,368
What"s in it for you?

328
00:21:32,506 --> 00:21:33,852

00:22:54,795 --> 00:22:57,039
Guys, get the monkey off here.

358
00:22:57,177 --> 00:23:01,561

704
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,218

as a member of staff.

705

A citywide manhunt is
underway for the terrorist

706
00:59:20,979 --> 00:59:23,430
and his known associates.

707
00:59:23,568 --> 00:59:26,260

But...

715
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:55,487
And that is why she ran
away with the priest.

716
01:01:07,879 --> 01:01:09,778

Her scream.

722
01:01:51,889 --> 01:01:54,132
It"s been inside
me my whole life.

723
01:01:58,861 --> 01:02:00,898
Come with me.

724
01:02:31,445 --> 01:02:35,553
We were warriors before they
drove us into exile here.

725
01:02:37,555 --> 01:02:40,213
The Vedas speak of a tree

726
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:43,354
that was supposedly
planted by Lord Shiva,

727
01:02:45,114 --> 01:02:47,841
the destroyer of worlds.

728
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:11,969
I was once like you.

729
01:03:13,073 --> 01:03:14,557
A broken man.

730
01:03:16,387 --> 01:03:19,286
A slave to childhood terrors.

731
01:03:21,633 --> 01:03:25,568
I learned that you need to
destroy in order to grow.

732
01:03:26,707 --> 01:03:29,089
To create space for new life.

733
01:03:36,648 --> 01:03:39,168
Mm. Here we go.

734
01:03:39,306 --> 01:03:43,379
Within its root
lies a potent toxin.

735
01:03:43,517 --> 01:03:47,211
We call it Trishul
after Shiva"s trident.

736
01:03:48,626 --> 01:03:51,042
It will cut you open.

737
01:03:52,526 --> 01:03:58,015
Only a weakened man
can benefit from this.

738
01:03:59,154 --> 01:04:02,605
Only a strong man
can survive it.

739
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:07,231
Are you ready?

740
01:04:08,715 --> 01:04:10,372
Yes.

741
01:04:28,045 --> 01:04:29,287
The pain...

742
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:34,292
It will leave you once
it"s finished teaching you.

743
01:06:59,713 --> 01:07:02,958
Brothers and Sisters!

744
01:07:03,096 --> 01:07:05,340
Welcome to the tale
of the Ramayana.

745
01:07:05,478 --> 01:07:07,687
In each generation, the
story repeats itself.

746
01:07:12,174 --> 01:07:13,589
The captive Princess...

747
01:07:13,727 --> 01:07:16,282
And her fight with
the Demon King.

748
01:07:18,007 --> 01:07:19,216
I"m Ravan!

749
01:07:19,354 --> 01:07:22,943
Evil King, please let me go.

750
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:24,531
Nobody says no to me!

751
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:30,261
But then!

752
01:07:30,399 --> 01:07:31,711
And then came the mighty one!

753
01:07:31,849 --> 01:07:33,885
- Mum, that"s Hanuman!
- Yes, it is.

754
01:07:34,023 --> 01:07:35,956
Take the first blow of my club.

755
01:07:48,003 --> 01:07:50,212
Feel my monkey strength!

756
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:52,663
I"m Hanuman!

757
01:08:01,879 --> 01:08:03,294
Speak.

758
01:08:04,226 --> 01:08:06,884
Go Rana, go.

759
01:08:07,574 --> 01:08:10,336
Time to do God"s work.

760
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:25,351
They"re back. The
Police are back.

761
01:08:25,489 --> 01:08:27,801
Get up. Run, everyone.

762
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:30,183
Hurry, hurry.

763
01:08:30,321 --> 01:08:32,565
Run! We must evacuate.
It"s the Police.

764
01:09:05,598 --> 01:09:06,978
Listen to me.

765
01:09:07,116 --> 01:09:10,119
You go upstairs and hide.
And don"t make a sound.

766
01:09:10,258 --> 01:09:12,191
No, no, listen to
me. Listen to me.

767
01:09:12,329 --> 01:09:15,194
Go upstairs and hide. And
don"t even make a slight sound.

768
01:09:15,332 --> 01:09:16,540
But what about you?

769
01:09:16,678 --> 01:09:18,127
Nothing will happen to me.

770
01:09:18,266 --> 01:09:19,646
Like how a mouse hides?

771
01:09:19,784 --> 01:09:22,339
You hide like a mouse
and make no sound.

772
01:09:22,477 --> 01:09:23,650
Do you trust Mum?

773
01:09:23,788 --> 01:09:25,204
Do you trust me?

774
01:09:25,342 --> 01:09:26,688
Nothing will happen.

775
01:09:26,826 --> 01:09:29,277
Nothing will happen.
Don"t lose heart.

776
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,899
Don"t lose heart.

777
01:09:31,037 --> 01:09:32,556
You are my Hanuman.

778
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:35,766
Quickly.

779
01:09:40,219 --> 01:09:41,910
Quickly, quickly.

780
01:10:05,036 --> 01:10:06,866
You"ve built a sweet home.

781
01:10:09,213 --> 01:10:11,008
What were you saying outside?

782
01:10:13,148 --> 01:10:14,563
Huh?

783
01:10:14,701 --> 01:10:17,117
Shove those papers up your ass.

784
01:10:17,256 --> 01:10:18,360
Is that right?

785
01:10:41,176 --> 01:10:42,764
Bloody whore!

786
01:10:44,869 --> 01:10:46,940
You"ll shove it up my ass, huh?

787
01:10:48,873 --> 01:10:50,289
I"ll show you.

788
01:10:50,427 --> 01:10:51,635
Get up, bitch.

789
01:13:06,045 --> 01:13:07,909
I failed her.

790
01:13:10,532 --> 01:13:12,223
No.

791
01:13:13,846 --> 01:13:16,089
You tried to save her.

792
01:13:20,128 --> 01:13:22,026
You see scars.

793
01:13:24,132 --> 01:13:28,654
I see the courage of a child
fighting to save his mother.

794
01:13:29,896 --> 01:13:33,762
These are the hands of a warrior

795
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,386
who"s destined to
challenge the gods.

796
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:42,391
All your life, you"ve been
fighting to feel pain.

797
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:46,016
You need to fight for a purpose.

798
01:13:46,706 --> 01:13:51,435
Fight... for all of us.

799
01:13:52,298 --> 01:13:56,613
It"s time to
remember who you are.

800
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:05,898
<i>As the Sovereign Party</i>

801
01:14:06,036 --> 01:14:08,245
<i>climbs in the polls,
allegations have surfaced</i>

802
01:14:08,383 --> 01:14:10,937
<i>that you destroyed 200
acres of forestland</i>

803
01:14:11,075 --> 01:14:13,284
<i>to build your mega factory.</i>

804
01:14:13,422 --> 01:14:14,734
It"s not a factory.

805
01:14:14,872 --> 01:14:16,149
It"s a commune.

806
01:14:16,287 --> 01:14:17,944
<i>And what about the farmers</i>

807
01:14:18,082 --> 01:14:19,946
<i>that have been displaced?</i>

808
01:14:20,084 --> 01:14:21,638
<i>Ah.</i>

809
01:14:21,776 --> 01:14:24,295
<i>The land was barren and empty.</i>

810
01:14:24,433 --> 01:14:28,127
Few families who lived
there have joined the cause.

811
01:14:28,265 --> 01:14:30,405
<i>And workers who complain</i>

812
01:14:30,543 --> 01:14:32,303
<i>of horrible working conditions?</i>

813
01:14:32,441 --> 01:14:34,374
<i>"They aren" t workers.</i>

814
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:36,653
<i>They are my disciples.</i>

815
01:16:19,687 --> 01:16:21,999
Yeah.

816
01:16:40,673 --> 01:16:41,743
Hmm.

817
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:50,821
Ah.

818
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:21,403
Get up.

819
01:17:25,269 --> 01:17:28,169
A surge of sectarian violence
has exploded around the country

820
01:17:28,307 --> 01:17:31,793
<i>after divisive remarks
made by Adesh Joshi.</i>

821
01:17:31,931 --> 01:17:35,038
<i>International leaders have
condemned the violence</i>

822
01:17:35,176 --> 01:17:37,696
<i>against minorities
but have stopped short</i>

823
01:17:37,834 --> 01:17:41,803
<i>of criticizing the candidate
as he climbs in the polls.</i>

824
01:18:13,248 --> 01:18:15,699
<i>Close your eyes,</i>

825
01:18:15,837 --> 01:18:19,013
<i>and you will find yourself</i>

826
01:18:19,151 --> 01:18:22,602
<i>sitting atop a mighty tree.</i>

827
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:25,744
<i>This is your home.</i>

828
01:18:25,882 --> 01:18:28,367
<i>You are a beast.</i>

829
01:18:29,092 --> 01:18:32,026
<i>Look beneath the surface,</i>

830
01:18:32,164 --> 01:18:36,202
<i>and you will see roots
deep under the soil,</i>

831
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:38,342
<i>reaching far and wide.</i>

832
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,725
<i>These are the roots
of your ancestors,</i>

833
01:18:41,863 --> 01:18:43,727
<i>the soul of your mother.</i>

834
01:18:43,865 --> 01:18:45,867
<i>Listen to her.</i>

835
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:48,697
<i>You have nothing to fear.</i>

836
01:18:48,836 --> 01:18:51,459
<i>"You" ve been here for time.</i>

837
01:19:04,921 --> 01:19:07,026
People of Yatana.

838
01:19:08,372 --> 01:19:09,926
Baba Shakti!

839
01:19:10,064 --> 01:19:12,100
CROWD [chanting]:
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

840
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:15,552
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

841
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:18,106
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

842
01:19:18,244 --> 01:19:20,591
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

843
01:19:20,729 --> 01:19:22,421
I am nobody.

844
01:19:23,077 --> 01:19:24,733
I am nothing.

845
01:19:24,872 --> 01:19:26,459
I didn"t choose this path.

846
01:19:26,597 --> 01:19:29,946
You chose it for me.

847
01:19:30,084 --> 01:19:33,259
Change never comes
without a fight.

848
01:19:34,467 --> 01:19:39,576
I want you to choose
another of God"s men.

849
01:19:40,646 --> 01:19:44,719
He"s one of us.
He is Adesh Joshi,

850
01:19:44,857 --> 01:19:47,964
leader of Sovereign Party.

851
01:19:48,102 --> 01:19:53,832
He will fight with
us, for us, for you.

852
01:19:55,005 --> 01:19:59,699
The working man,
the poor, the sick.

853
01:19:59,838 --> 01:20:02,599
<i>Shower him with your love</i>

854
01:20:02,737 --> 01:20:05,567
<i>and let our voice be heard</i>

855
01:20:05,705 --> 01:20:08,087
<i>throughout the nation.</i>

856
01:20:14,231 --> 01:20:15,715
<i>They have destroyed</i>

857
01:20:15,854 --> 01:20:18,132
<i>our sacred values.</i>

858
01:20:18,891 --> 01:20:21,411
<i>They have stolen our homes,</i>

859
01:20:21,549 --> 01:20:24,310
<i>"poisoned our children" s minds.</i>

860
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:28,521
<i>They have polluted us
with their symbols,</i>

861
01:20:28,659 --> 01:20:31,214
<i>their false idols.</i>

862
01:20:31,352 --> 01:20:33,526
<i>We have been blinded.</i>

863
01:20:34,217 --> 01:20:36,322
<i>Will you stand with us?</i>

864
01:20:37,013 --> 01:20:38,911
<i>Will you bleed with us?</i>

865
01:20:39,912 --> 01:20:42,018
<i>Will you?</i>

866
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:43,604
<i>Will you?</i>

867
01:20:47,057 --> 01:20:49,163
Victory for Mother India.

868
01:20:55,065 --> 01:20:58,034
Victory for Mother India!

869
01:21:21,091 --> 01:21:22,575
Lakshmi!

870
01:21:25,509 --> 01:21:27,580
Tell me what
happened to Lakshmi.

871
01:21:27,718 --> 01:21:29,410
- Lakshmi!
- Lakshmi!

872
01:21:29,548 --> 01:21:31,412
- Lakshmi.
- Are you okay, Lakshmi?

873
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:32,931
What happened? What happened?

874
01:21:33,069 --> 01:21:35,416
These men put a
notice on the door.

875
01:21:35,554 --> 01:21:37,901
She tried to take it
down, but they beat her.

876
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:40,421
She"s not breathing.
Breathe, Lakshmi, breathe.

877
01:21:40,559 --> 01:21:42,043
Did you see? Did
you see who it was?

878
01:21:42,181 --> 01:21:43,493
Shakti"s men.

879
01:21:43,631 --> 01:21:46,082
They said the temple
never belonged to us.

880
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:48,532
Alpha, where will we go?

881
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:51,363
If we don"t have money,
they will keep doing this.

882
01:21:51,501 --> 01:21:55,022
We cannot pay off some thugs.

883
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:57,748
We all must pray.

884
01:21:57,886 --> 01:21:59,578
Lakshmi!

885
01:22:00,199 --> 01:22:01,649
God has a plan.

886
01:22:55,944 --> 01:22:57,843
We have the election
results due to break

887
01:22:57,981 --> 01:22:59,362
during Diwali festival.

888
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,236
Sovereign Party supporters
are flooding the streets

889
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:04,125
with the party expecting
a landslide victory.

890
01:23:07,611 --> 01:23:09,820
- Baba!
- Shakti!

891
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:11,788

892
01:23:11,926 --> 01:23:15,654

Anger will not quiet
your soul, my son.

1082
01:49:53,906 --> 01:49:56,046
Don"t call me "son."

1083
01:50:02,259 --> 01:50:06,332
These were carved
by a devout follower

1084
01:50:07,505 --> 01:50:09,646
who wore them to
prevent his feet

1085
01:50:09,784 --> 01:50:12,407
from harming any small creature.

1086
01:50:12,545 --> 01:50:16,825
On the side here,
there"s an old prayer:

1087
01:50:16,963 --> 01:50:20,933
"Forgive me, Mother Earth,
for the sin of injury

1088
01:50:21,071 --> 01:50:24,591
which I inflict with each step."

1089
01:50:27,525 --> 01:50:29,458
My chariot is here.

1090
01:51:19,681 --> 01:51:23,443
You can"t. These people need me.

1091
01:51:23,581 --> 01:51:24,721
Please.

1092
01:51:24,859 --> 01:51:27,102
I"ll give you what you want.

1093
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:29,622
I"ll do anything.

1094
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,072
Forgive me.

1095
01:51:31,210 --> 01:51:34,696
Ha-Ha-Have mercy, please.

1096
01:51:34,834 --> 01:51:37,457
Only God can forgive you now.

1097
01:52:20,673 --> 01:52:23,918
Oh God, I worship you.

1098
01:52:24,539 --> 01:52:26,886
I only worship you.

1099
01:52:27,611 --> 01:52:30,338
You are the most powerful one.

1100
01:52:31,857 --> 01:52:34,238
You are my saviour.

1101
01:52:36,137 --> 01:52:38,001
You make us smile.

1102
01:52:38,139 --> 01:52:41,280
And fill our hearts with love.

1103
01:52:41,418 --> 01:52:44,870
All around the
world. In my heart.

1104
01:52:45,698 --> 01:52:49,150
In my home. You are everywhere.

1105
01:52:49,288 --> 01:52:53,982
In every root, and
every drop of water.

1106
01:52:55,328 --> 01:52:59,056
With our eyes. With our ears.

1107
01:52:59,194 --> 01:53:01,818
On our lips. We say your name.

1108
01:53:03,267 --> 01:53:07,927
I sing your praise,
day and night.

1109
01:53:20,077 --> 01:53:22,977
Oh God, I worship you.

1110
01:53:42,755 --> 01:53:46,517
