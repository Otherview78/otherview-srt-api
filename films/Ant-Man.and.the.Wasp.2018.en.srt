1
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:05,631
I still think about the night

2
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:07,466
your mother and I had to leave you.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,307
Hopefully, it's not for long,

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,309
but I'll call you when we get settled.

5
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,311
When I have a better indication of what's going on.

6
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,353
Mommy?

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,066
Jellybean.

8
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:28,654
Daddy and I have a last-minute business trip...

9
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:31,073
so Rose is gonna stay with you for a few days.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,367
No. I don't want you to go.

11
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:36,579
Ugh. It's gonna be so boring.

12
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,247
I won't be able to keep my...

13
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:39,832
eyes...

14
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:46,088
Goodbye, sweetheart. All right, we'll see you soon.

15
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:47,840
Okay.

16
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,383
Janet, we gotta go.

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,764
I wish we could have put down our bags...

18
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:57,016
tucked you back into your bed...

19
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:00,436
but too many lives were at stake.

20
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:05,650
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,443
They've already launched.

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,736
We have to stop it.

23
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:09,904
Come on.

24
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,874
To disarm the missile, we had to get inside it...

25
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,835
but the plating was too thick.

26
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,922
The only way in was to shrink between the molecules.

27
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:32,843
I can't get through.

28
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,179
Hank.

29
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,350
We both knew that if you go that small...

30
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:40,601
there is no coming back.

31
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:45,690
It should have been me, but my regulator was damaged.

32
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,859
Your mother's wasn't.

33
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,988
Tell Hope I love her.

34
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,447
She turned it off

35
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:54,949
Janet. No!

36
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,535
She went subatomic to deactivate the bomb.

37
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,419
Your mother saved thousands of lives that day

38
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:10,047
knowing she'd be lost in the quantum realm.

39
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:12,300
Alone.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,676
Afraid.

41
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,429
Gone forever.

42
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:34,155
Telling you that she wasn't coming home...

43
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,616
was the hardest thing that I ever had to do.

44
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,247
But then Scott showed up.

45
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,876
Or should I say, broke into our house.

46
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:49,920
And when he went to the quantum realm...

47
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:54,592
and came back.

48
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:57,011
Everything changed.

49
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,890
I started to wonder...

50
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,642
could your mother still be alive?

51
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:08,272
So, I dusted off some old plans.

52
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,992
Dad, what are you saying?

53
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:24,663
I think it's possible to bring her back.

54
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,663
Okay. We're in.

55
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,960
Oh, this place is a maze.

56
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,003
Where's that map?

57
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,591
We're definitely close.

58
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,552
- You ready? - I'm ready, Daddy.

59
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,429
Are you sure? 'Cause once we're inside,

60
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,722
you show any hesitation or fear, we're done.

61
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,850
I eat fear for breakfast.

62
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,477
Wow. That is super cool.

63
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:29,728
Come on.

64
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,153
Look! It's Anton. He'll show us the way.

65
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,196
Anton, which way do we go?

66
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,868
Anton, which way do we go?

67
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,002
Thanks, Anton!

68
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,631
Look, the ants have burrowed into the tech facility.

69
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,508
Oh no, lasers!

70
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,679
Oh! I think I got lased!

71
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,142
The secret vault.

72
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,103
Tell me you brought the contact lens.

73
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,938
Yup.

74
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,984
Perfect! Right there.

75
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,365
There! It's the micro-treasure!

76
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,159
My trophy?

77
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:26,827
It looks like treasure.

78
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,287
Oh, it is to me.

79
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:29,830
I want to take it to show-and-tell.

80
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,040
Oh, no, you can't do that.

81
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:34,335
You can't. It never leaves the house. It's too important.

82
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,545
This is the best birthday present you ever got me.

83
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:37,713
I'm so touched you think

84
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,632
I'm the world's greatest grandma.

85
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,133
It was the only one they had.

86
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,010
It makes me want to knit you a sweater.

87
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,472
Oh, no, the fuzz!

88
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,473
Hey, Scotty...

89
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,682
I was looking at the schematics

90
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,184
for the Karapetyan buildings...

91
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:51,435
and I think we have

92
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,811
way too many security cameras, don't we?

93
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,188
No, no, not at all.

94
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,773
I mean, 'cause it's a lot of security cameras.

95
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,066
I know what he needs.

96
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,943
Who's the security expert in our business?

97
00:05:59,109 --> 00:05:59,902
You are, but I'm running the company, right?

98
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:00,945
And if we over quote him...

99
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,112
he's gonna go somewhere else.

100
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:02,905
I mean, we gotta land this bird.

101
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,281
He ain't goin' anywhere.

102
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,533
And the expression is "land this fish."

103
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,117
No, it's "land the bird."

104
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,369
Just like you land the plane.

105
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,537
You gotta land the plane to be in business.

106
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,996
I know it's silly to get hung up

107
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,581
on these kinds of things, but I do.

108
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:13,916
How am I gonna land a fish?

109
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,960
It can't walk. And if it swam up on shore...

110
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:18,295
and it battled a hawk, who's gonna win?

111
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,465
You've really turned me around on this thing.

112
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,551
It's okay. We're gonna land Karapetyan.

113
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,969
Now, if you just excuse me...

114
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:25,719
I'm in the middle of trying to

115
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:26,470
steal something with my daughter.

116
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:27,680
I'm gonna go recheck it.

117
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:30,391
To the escape ant!

118
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:34,311
Let's bounce before the po-po come back!

119
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,398
The po-po? How do you even know that?

120
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,567
Let's fly, Antoinette! Let's fly!

121
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,787
Crash landing!

122
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,497
Whoo!

123
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,251
I wish we could shrink for real.

124
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:58,919
Oh. That is pretty cool.

125
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:00,629
Hey, I'm headed to the office, Scotty.

126
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:02,464
And sorry about freaking out earlier, you know.

127
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:03,716
But I feel like I'm way better.

128
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,010
My heart is definitely beating way too hard and stuff.

129
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,219
And my hands are shaking.

130
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:08,345
But I think it's unrelated, you know?

131
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:09,847
It's gonna be great, Luis!

132
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,056
You got nothing to worry about!

133
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,726
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss. I'm the boss.

134
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,060
I'm the boss. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

135
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,645
Daddy!

136
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,820
Come on, Woo! I've got three days left.

137
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,113
Why would I try to escape?

138
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,990
Sorry, Scott, but rules are rules.

139
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:29,658
You trip the perimeter alarm, we search the place.

140
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,493
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

141
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,245
Thank you.

142
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,497
It was an accident. My foot went through the fence.

143
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,957
Our flying ant crashed.

144
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,335
Hey, you try and entertain a 10-year-old

145
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,419
when you can't leave the house.

146
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,880
You know the lengths that I've gone to?

147
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,716
Close-up magic.

148
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:49,803
I learned that.

149
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,348
Why can't you just leave my daddy alone?

150
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,517
Oh, Cassie.

151
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,895
This must all seem like a bunch of confusing

152
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,480
grown-up stuff to you, huh?

153
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,315
Well, think of it this way.

154
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,192
Your school has rules, right?

155
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,194
Like, you can't draw on the walls.

156
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:07,279
Well, your daddy went to Germany

157
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:09,323
and drew on the walls with Captain America.

158
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,825
And that was a violation of Article 16,

159
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,036
Paragraph Three of the Sokovia Accords.

160
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,954
Now, as a part of his joint plea deal...

161
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,374
with Homeland Security and the German government...

162
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,250
he was allowed to return to the U.S...

163
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,711
provided he serve two years under house arrest...

164
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,588
followed by three years of probation.

165
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:27,549
And avoid any unauthorized activities, technology...

166
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,843
or contact with any former associates who were...

167
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,222
or currently are in violation of said Accords.

168
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:34,807
Or any related statutes.

169
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,225
Okay, sweetie?

170
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,728
Wow. You're really great with kids.

171
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,772
Thanks. I'm also a youth pastor.

172
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,525
Anyway, not to be a Johnny ask-a-lot...

173
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:45,984
but you haven't had any contact

174
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,736
with Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

175
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,363
- No. - You sure?

176
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,407
Because it's only a matter of time before we get 'em.

177
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,076
It was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too.

178
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:57,079
And associating with them breaks your deal.

179
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,373
And, uh, I don't need to remind you...

180
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,250
that any violation of your agreement

181
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,043
means 20 years in prison. Minimum.

182
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,671
I haven't talked to Hank or Hope in forever.

183
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:06,964
They hate his guts.

184
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:07,840
Thanks, peanut.

185
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,968
How'd you do it, Scott?

186
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:12,720
Do what?

187
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,848
The card trick.

188
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,474
Seriously?

189
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,643
Oh, my God!

190
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,104
You people can't just show up here

191
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,772
whenever you want and search the place.

192
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:24,940
Actually, they can.

193
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:25,899
You need a warrant.

194
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,109
Actually, they don't.

195
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,777
Really? Wow.

196
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,029
Did you pack your soccer shoes?

197
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,323
- Yeah. - All right.

198
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:36,201
Next time I see you will be on the outside.

199
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,953
All right.

200
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,038
Oh, get on the inside of this.

201
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,833
Hey, three days. Seriously...

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,126
- I'm proud of you, bud. - Thank you.

203
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,627
You know what? Give me another one.

204
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,880
Me too! Gosh! Freedom!

205
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,632
New business! I am sensing greatness.

206
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,384
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

207
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,470
Me too, peanut. But just wait till next weekend.

208
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,637
Once I'm outta here,

209
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:56,930
you and I are gonna go paint this town red.

210
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,350
We'll have so much ice cream, we'll never stop puking.

211
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,234
You're gettin' good at that.

212
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,444
How'd you do that?

213
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,487
- Bye, Daddy. - Bye.

214
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,032
- Bye. - Bye.

215
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,162
Three days.

216
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,080
Easy-peasy.

217
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,175
Snap your fingers. That gets them to look over there.

218
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,177
And that is misdirection.

219
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,265
We had a dream

220
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,975
We'd go travelin' together

221
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,187
We'd spread a little lovin' then we'd keep movin' on

222
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,302
Easy-peasy.

223
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,853
Where are you?

224
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,530
Everything that you know...

225
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,535
Lost...

226
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,079
in the quantum realm.

227
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,796
What?

228
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,257
I'm gonna find you, Jellybean.

229
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,389
I found you!

230
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,017
You always find me, Mommy.

231
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,394
What the hell?

232
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,453
Hey, Hank! It's been a while.

233
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,082
Um, I don't even know if this is your number anymore.

234
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,584
And I'm probably the last person

235
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,252
you wanna hear from.

236
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,547
But I just had a really weird dream.

237
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:36,840
And I know that doesn't

238
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,091
sound like an emergency or anything...

239
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,387
but it just felt very real.

240
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,058
I was back in the quantum realm...

241
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,227
and I think I saw your wife.

242
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,355
And then I was your wife.

243
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,358
I mean, not in a weird way or anything.

244
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,862
You know, hearing this out loud,

245
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,323
I'm thinking, uh, it's not an emergency.

246
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,492
I'm sorry to bother you.

247
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,120
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

248
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,383
That means, one tiny atom in my fingernail could be...

249
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,805
Could be one, little, tiny universe.

250
00:13:58,714 --> 00:13:59,548
Hope?

251
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,343
Is this another dream?

252
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,553
Do you think it was a dream...

253
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,305
or is it possible that you really saw my mom down there?

254
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,474
I'm not sure.

255
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,271
I can't be here!

256
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,064
I can't be here! I'm under house arrest!

257
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,067
They won't open while the system's engaged, Scott.

258
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,673
You have to take me home. They could show up any second!

259
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,966
Relax. As far as your nanny cops know,

260
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,176
you're still at home.

261
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,309
Whoa!

262
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,149
Scotty?

263
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,151
He's programmed to replicate your daily routine.

264
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,694
Nine hours in bed.

265
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:03,987
Five hours in front of the TV.

266
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,281
Two hours in the bathroom, whatever that's about.

267
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,866
That's totally inaccurate.

268
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,659
And how do you know about my daily routine?

269
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:10,786
Are you spying on me?

270
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,621
We keep tabs on all security threats, all right?

271
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:14,831
And so far the biggest one we've had is you.

272
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,295
I'm sorry about Germany. They just showed up.

273
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:22,339
They said it was a matter of national security.

274
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,673
That Cap needed help, so...

275
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,092
Cap?

276
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,970
Tain America. Captain. Cap.

277
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,931
It's what we call him.

278
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,557
If you're a friend.

279
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:33,850
I'm not saying I'm a friend of... A little, I know him.

280
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,060
He's nice. Whatever.

281
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,188
I'm sorry! All right? I didn't think I'd get caught.

282
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,856
You didn't think about a lot of things.

283
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:42,484
How's Hank?

284
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,653
We're still running. The house is gone, so is our freedom.

285
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,029
How do you think he is?

286
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,031
I'm sorry. I know you're mad.

287
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,658
I'm not looking for an apology, Scott.

288
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,451
The only reason why we're even talking is...

289
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,203
because we need what's in your head.

290
00:15:53,203 --> 00:16:23,203
Subtitle www.movieddl.me

291
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,952
Is this where you're living?

292
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,373
If you need help or money or something, maybe I can...

293
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,875
We're fine.

294
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,184
Hey, Hank. Look, I just wanna...

295
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,186
Save it!

296
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,732
- Can we start? - Yeah.

297
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,236
So, while you were relaxing at home...

298
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,780
we were building this.

299
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,741
It's a tunnel. To the quantum realm.

300
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,035
To my mom.

301
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,328
We think she might still be down there.

302
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,412
We just don't know where.

303
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,372
What?

304
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,083
If we can pinpoint my mom's location...

305
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,168
then the pod can take me down to get her.

306
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,586
You built all this and you don't even know

307
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,879
if she's alive?

308
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,965
It's called a hypothesis.

309
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,842
Last night, we powered up the tunnel for the first time.

310
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,136
It was overloaded and it shut down.

311
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,888
But for a split second,

312
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,933
the doorway to the quantum realm was opened.

313
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:21,893
And?

314
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,146
And five minutes later, you called, talking about Mom.

315
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,065
We think when you were down there,

316
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,525
you may have entangled with her.

317
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,735
Hank, I would never do that. I respect you too much.

318
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,071
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

319
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,489
We think she might have put

320
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,782
some kind of a message in your head.

321
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,742
Hopefully, a location.

322
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,536
And opening the tunnel triggered it.

323
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,288
Your mom put a message in my head?

324
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,998
Come on. That's insane.

325
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,207
No, Scott.

326
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,710
Insane is going to Germany

327
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,170
without telling us, and fighting the Avengers.

328
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,424
Just tell me you weren't lying about the suit you took.

329
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,385
Tell me you really destroyed it.

330
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,762
I did, I destroyed it, I swear.

331
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,806
I can't believe you destroyed my suit!

332
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,309
That was my life's work!

333
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,727
What was I supposed to do?

334
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,646
You were supposed to not take my suit!

335
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,814
I'm sorry, Hank!

336
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,357
I'm sorry I took the suit.

337
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,651
I'm sorry that I called last night.

338
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,653
I don't remember seeing Janet down there.

339
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,030
I wish that I did.

340
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,114
I just had a dream about her

341
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,782
playing hide-and-seek with a little girl.

342
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,078
What?

343
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,291
I had a dream.

344
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,085
She was playing hide-and-seek with a little girl.

345
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,046
Cassie and I do it all the time.

346
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,380
Doesn't mean anything.

347
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,507
But was it Cassie in the dream?

348
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,759
No.

349
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,052
Where was she hiding?

350
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,553
- What? - The little girl.

351
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,764
Where was she hiding? Was it in a wardrobe?

352
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,059
No, it was in a tall dresser.

353
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,352
You mean a wardrobe.

354
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,644
Is that what that's called?

355
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,480
What color was it?

356
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,106
Red.

357
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,818
Were there horses on it?

358
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,487
Oh, boy.

359
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,532
It's where I hid every time that we played.

360
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,201
It doesn't sound like

361
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,328
you really got the gist of the game.

362
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,539
She's alive.

363
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,918
I knew it.

364
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,212
I knew it!

365
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,131
We need to get that part.

366
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,466
Okay.

367
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,761
The sooner we get the tunnel working...

368
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,388
the sooner we can get this message out of his head.

369
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,555
Does Burch have it?

370
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,057
- Yeah. Let's go. - What part?

371
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,351
Who's Burch? Wait. What's happening?

372
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,312
We need a component to stop the tunnel

373
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,939
from overloading again.

374
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,691
I grabbed your clothes. You might want to change.

375
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,120
Look, I'd really like to help you...

376
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,288
but if I'm not at home when they come

377
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:48,415
to take off my ankle monitor...

378
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,041
then I'm going away forever.

379
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,168
Once we get the component and power up the tunnel...

380
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,170
we'll get the message, and have you home by lunch.

381
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,506
We have to hurry. The entanglement won't last.

382
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:57,674
You owe us.

383
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,176
All right, fine. But can I just wait inside?

384
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,678
Because I'm not supposed to be out here.

385
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,314
Let's go.

386
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,333
- We good? - Yeah.

387
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,043
I'll be right back.

388
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,678
- Can I have one of these? - No.

389
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:01,112
Ah. Susan! Welcome to Oui!

390
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,906
Sonny!

391
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,908
Oui is French for "yes."

392
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,243
As in "yes" to farm-to-table, "yes" to locally sourced...

393
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,996
and "yes" to planet before profit.

394
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,749
Well, let's hope it also means "yes"

395
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,459
to "Do you have the component I ordered?"

396
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,130
You know, I have always loved your sense of humor, Susan.

397
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:20,340
Have a seat.

398
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:21,382
No, I'm good. Thank you.

399
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,842
Who is this guy?

400
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,054
Sonny Burch. He traffics in black market technology.

401
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,765
He's been getting us what we need to build the tunnel.

402
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,393
Could I just have one...

403
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,561
No.

404
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,649
You know, I have a special friend at the FBI.

405
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:38,900
And I say "special"...

406
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,861
because, well, he tells me things

407
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,613
that I didn't previously know.

408
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,865
For example...

409
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,825
your name isn't Susan.

410
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,245
It's Hope Van Dyne.

411
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:53,665
And your unseen associate, that's your father, Hank Pym.

412
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,959
- That's not good, Hank. - No shit.

413
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,552
What do you want?

414
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,887
Relationships are built on trust, Hope.

415
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,473
And I want our relationship to have a strong foundation.

416
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,724
Our relationship?

417
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,644
My business landscape has been shifting, Hope.

418
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,604
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA don't even exist anymore...

419
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:18,690
but now, Hank Pym...

420
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,192
Hank Pym is a real opportunity.

421
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,443
Do you have a point?

422
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,778
Oh, you think that I don't know

423
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,239
what you've been building with all this?

424
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,408
Quantum technology.

425
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,452
Now, you can forget nanotech, forget AI,

426
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:32,704
forget cryptocurrency.

427
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,455
Quantum energy is the future.

428
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,332
It's the next gold rush.

429
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:37,458
Is that so?

430
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,043
I want in, Hope.

431
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,671
So, as a gesture of good will, I have taken the liberty...

432
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,923
of arranging some buyers for your lab.

433
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:45,675
Starting bid...

434
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:49,429
one billion dollars.

435
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,180
Thank you, Sonny, really.

436
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,557
But my father and I have something

437
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,059
slightly more pressing than starting a business.

438
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:58,354
So I'll just take the component as arranged.

439
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,732
My buyers don't take no for an answer.

440
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,651
So, we are either in business together...

441
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,613
or we aren't in business together.

442
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,451
Then I guess we aren't.

443
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,453
You can go.

444
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,372
But I'm afraid your money's gonna have to remain.

445
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:19,459
Let's call it compensation for my injured feelings.

446
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,586
Listen, Sonny.

447
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:24,505
This is gonna be so much easier on everybody

448
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,132
if you just give me that component.

449
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,176
Darlin', the only thing you're takin' from here...

450
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:31,971
is my heart, but it will mend in time.

451
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:34,766
Okay.

452
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,692
So, now what?

453
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:45,943
You'll see.

454
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,613
She said her and her daddy had something pressing.

455
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,864
- Mmm-hmm. - I want to know what it is

456
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,032
because if they're not working with us...

457
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,659
they're working with somebody. So find out.

458
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:53,951
I want some names...

459
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:00,416
Hold on, you gave her wings?

460
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:07,632
Get her.

461
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,566
Not my turn-of-the-century chandelier!

462
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,739
Stop firing! Stop!

463
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:37,829
All right, take this. Go. Go, go, go!

464
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:39,455
Go!

465
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,603
Wings and blasters.

466
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,646
So I take it you didn't have that tech available for me.

467
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:46,647
No, I did.

468
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:51,068
It was a pleasure doing business with you, Sonny.

469
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,738
Oh, our business isn't finished yet, Hope.

470
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,573
I can assure you of that!

471
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:04,874
What in the hell is that?

472
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,181
Dad, are you seeing this?

473
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,265
Hope, get out of there!

474
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:31,567
- I gotta do something. - Wait!

475
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:40,201
It is still a work in progress.

476
00:27:58,845 --> 00:27:59,971
You taught me that kick. Remember?

477
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,305
Yeah, great form.

478
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,266
Those were the days. Whatever happened to us?

479
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,559
Not the time, Scott.

480
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,060
Damn it, where'd it go?

481
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:10,064
I've lost it.

482
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,941
I'm not seeing anything on the ant cams.

483
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,818
Try looking...

484
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,027
Dad?

485
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,288
Give me that.

486
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,330
Now.

487
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:32,086
- Are you okay? - No!

488
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:33,296
He got the lab.

489
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,213
No.

490
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:35,423
Come on!

491
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:38,968
What was that?

492
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,428
I don't know.

493
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,430
But we need to find somewhere to regroup

494
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,348
and figure out where the lab is.

495
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,309
So, where to now?

496
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,311
How about my house? Hmm?

497
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,562
I'm supposed to be there anyway,

498
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:50,688
and Woo could walk in any second.

499
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:53,065
Exactly why we're not going to your house.

500
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,442
What about your house?

501
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,320
Sorry.

502
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:00,197
Well, there is one place I can think of.

503
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,116
No.

504
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,994
No, no, no, no!

505
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:07,580
No!

506
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,335
Wow, Dr. Pym...

507
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,836
who would've thought that,

508
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,212
once again, in your hour of need...

509
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,381
that you would turn to us, you know?

510
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,507
Not me.

511
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,885
Mmm. Help yourself.

512
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:22,178
Hey, what's up with the fancy pastry?

513
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:23,679
We gotta keep the food budget down.

514
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,556
Well, what are we supposed to have for breakfast?

515
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:26,807
The oatmeal packets.

516
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,517
Oatmeal packets.

517
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,269
- It's insult. - Why is it an insult?

518
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:31,520
Because it tastes like sand.

519
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:32,939
You know why? 'Cause it's organic.

520
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,315
It's not organic, it's sand.

521
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,608
It's the most important meal of the day.

522
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:36,567
You know what, you can get creative with it.

523
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:37,693
Break teeth.

524
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:38,986
Put a little brown sugar on it. You can put some cinnamon.

525
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:40,154
Put a little honey. Whatever you want...

526
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:43,240
Guys, guys, guys. Come on, man.

527
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,034
We got bigger fish to fry.

528
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,661
Is that my desk?

529
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,412
- Yeah. - What?

530
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:49,997
Why do I have such a small desk?

531
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:51,624
Because you weren't there when we were choosing desks.

532
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:52,792
You snooze, you lose.

533
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,793
Well, I was under house arrest.

534
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:54,627
Yeah.

535
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,878
You know what, this isn't even a desk.

536
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:56,879
This is garbage.

537
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,674
You found this outside amongst garbage.

538
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,008
I got it at a rummage sale.

539
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:02,635
So, you save money on my desk?

540
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:03,678
Guys.

541
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,930
Hope, please, we need to focus, all right?

542
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:08,265
We gotta find that lab already. Jeez.

543
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,810
Oh, you know what? I heard stories,

544
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:11,811
like what happened to you.

545
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,021
This crazy, creepy cat, who walks through walls and stuff.

546
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:15,898
Like a ghost.

547
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,566
Like Baba Yaga.

548
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:23,197
Baba Yaga, the witch.

549
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,075
They tell stories to children to frighten them.

550
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,661
You know Baba Yaga?

551
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:31,080
Whoever stole it...

552
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,665
we need to find it.

553
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:36,293
Oh, you don't find someone like that. They find you.

554
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,212
Like Baba Yaga.

555
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:41,090
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest genius I know.

556
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,592
Didn't you put some kind of LoJack on your lab?

557
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:44,885
Because if you didn't,

558
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:46,929
we have a variety of affordable options.

559
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:50,474
Of course I did, Luis. It was disabled.

560
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,102
Whoever stole the lab knew exactly what they were doing.

561
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,229
They also looked like they were phasing.

562
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:56,439
Phasing?

563
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,149
Quantum phasing. When an object moves

564
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,483
through different states of matter.

565
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,485
Oh, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

566
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,695
The lab emits radiation.

567
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:05,448
Can we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it?

568
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,200
That could work, yes, but all my equipment is in the lab.

569
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,327
Where else can we find that equipment?

570
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,081
Well, there is one person.

571
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:16,459
Bill Foster.

572
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,626
Great!

573
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,211
Who's Bill Foster?

574
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,464
He's an old colleague of my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.

575
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,340
They had a falling out years ago.

576
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,217
You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people.

577
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,386
It's probably just a waste of time.

578
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,513
Hey, I'm risking everything by being here.

579
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:30,890
Don't you think we should check?

580
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,350
We need to find out who took the lab.

581
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:27,363
Guys, it's not a good idea

582
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,864
to be out in the open like this.

583
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,867
Relax, no one's gonna recognize us.

584
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:34,411
What, because of hats and sunglasses?

585
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,038
That's not a disguise, Hank.

586
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:38,332
We look like ourselves at a baseball game.

587
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,376
In an isolated system...

588
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:45,089
particles co-exist in a stable phase relationship.

589
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,424
If the system is interfered with,

590
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:50,719
that stability becomes chaos.

591
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:52,680
Unpredictable.

592
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:55,224
Dangerous. Beautiful.

593
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,768
Isolated completely, a quantum system

594
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:00,187
would revert back to separate states of matter...

595
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:03,983
each entangled with a distinct state of its environment.

596
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:06,694
In other words, the object in question

597
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,445
would be both in and out of phase...

598
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,824
with multiple parallel realities.

599
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,374
Speaking of being out of phase with reality.

600
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,294
I am noticing an unusually high number

601
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,671
of glazed eyes out there among you.

602
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:29,717
So, why don't we call it a few minutes early?

603
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:31,051
That'll be enough for today.

604
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,887
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you may go.

605
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:37,641
It's incredible. You're linked to Janet.

606
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:40,769
It's quantum entanglement between the quantum states of

607
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:42,646
Posner molecules in your brains.

608
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,231
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

609
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:46,400
Do you guys just put the word "quantum"

610
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,359
in front of everything?

611
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,236
Doctor, we need to find our lab.

612
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:50,779
Hope, I'd love to help you...

613
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:51,572
but I don't have anything

614
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:52,406
like the equipment you're describing.

615
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:54,658
I told you this is a waste of time. Come on, let's go.

616
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:55,910
Don't condescend, Hank.

617
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:58,120
You're the one who's on the run from the FBI.

618
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:00,122
All because you had to grow to a size

619
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,916
that finally fit your ego.

620
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:05,419
That wasn't me in Germany. It was this idiot.

621
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:06,462
Really?

622
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,174
Going that big, it must've been exhausting.

623
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:12,593
I slept for three days straight. You have no idea.

624
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:13,844
Actually, I do.

625
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,721
Back in the day, I was Hank's partner

626
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,556
on a project called Goliath.

627
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,099
Excuse me? You were my partner?

628
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:21,185
The only thing more tiring than going that big

629
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,187
is putting up with Hank's bullshit.

630
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:24,688
Right...

631
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:28,943
I don't know. How big did you get?

632
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,862
My record? 21 feet.

633
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,447
- Not bad. - You?

634
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:34,448
I don't...

635
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:35,574
No, really, I'm curious.

636
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,244
- 65 feet. Yeah. - Whoa!

637
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,079
- Huge. - 65.

638
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:42,623
If you two are finished comparing sizes...

639
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,959
we need to figure out a way to track down the lab.

640
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:48,128
And the great Hank Pym hasn't figured that one out yet?

641
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:49,964
Strange.

642
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,882
You had all the answers back in the day.

643
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,384
That's why I left the project.

644
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,511
Left? I fired you.

645
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:56,845
Best decision I ever made.

646
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,139
Hank was a terrible partner. Temperamental...

647
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,350
stubborn, impatient.

648
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,477
Sooner or later, he just pushed everyone away.

649
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:05,020
Just the mediocrities.

650
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,231
Janet was the only one who could endure him

651
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,399
and chose to stick it out.

652
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:09,483
Watch it, Bill.

653
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,068
She paid the price, though, didn't she?

654
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:12,361
You son of a bitch.

655
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,697
I didn't come here to listen to you two squabble.

656
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,282
I'm trying to save my mother.

657
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,285
Now, which office would you say?

658
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:20,286
Oh, it's Woo.

659
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,663
Someone must have seen me.

660
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,039
Relax. If this is about you,

661
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:25,916
they'd be in your house by now.

662
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:29,503
What are you, 15?

663
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,713
Come on. We gotta go right now.

664
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,882
Wait. You might be able to improvise that tracker...

665
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:35,467
if you modify the diffraction units

666
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:36,635
on one of your regulators.

667
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,096
- That could work. - I don't know what that means.

668
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:41,265
Thank you. Thank you.

669
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:54,153
But, Doctor, campus police says

670
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:56,030
they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne.

671
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:57,489
I don't know what to tell you, Agent.

672
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,533
I haven't talked to Hank in 30 years.

673
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:00,743
I can assure you I'm the last person

674
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:01,869
he would want to visit.

675
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,120
Oh, come on, you expect us to...

676
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:03,787
Hey, hey.

677
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:05,539
Why is that?

678
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:08,876
Simple. We hate each other's guts.

679
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,378
So I'm a terrible partner?

680
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:13,922
Foster, he hasn't had one good idea

681
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,174
in his unremarkable career.

682
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,301
But his idea about the diffractors could work, right?

683
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,261
Fine, one decent idea.

684
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,305
Except, I eliminated the diffractors

685
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,265
when I upgraded the suits.

686
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,895
So, if we had an old suit,

687
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,064
we might be able to track down the lab?

688
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,565
Yes, but we don't.

689
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,694
- What if we did? - What do you mean?

690
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:38,197
I mean...

691
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,449
life's funny.

692
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:42,576
Oh, my God. You didn't destroy the suit.

693
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:43,577
What?

694
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,954
Well, it was your life's work, Hank.

695
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,581
I couldn't destroy that.

696
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,167
Before I turned myself in,

697
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,418
I shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis.

698
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,921
You sent my suit through the mail?

699
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:56,090
Hey, the postal service is very reliable.

700
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:59,468
You know, they do tracking numbers now. Like UPS.

701
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:00,677
Where is it?

702
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,222
It's in a very safe place, all right? Don't worry.

703
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,100
What, the trophy? No, it's not here.

704
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:07,601
What do you mean it's not there? Where could it be?

705
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,186
I looked everywhere. It's not here.

706
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,562
Hey, get away from the plant.

707
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,689
But I put it back after Cassie and I...

708
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,359
Show-and-tell.

709
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:16,485
Scotty?

710
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:19,613
No, stop!

711
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,491
Well, the good news is I know where it is.

712
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:30,124
Whenever you go back to school...

713
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,000
isn't everything supposed to look so much smaller?

714
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,627
This place seems huge.

715
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,837
What is it?

716
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,004
It's the new regulator.

717
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,048
Hank, what's going on with this suit?

718
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:39,758
How much of a work in progress is this?

719
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,388
Uh-oh. No, no, no.

720
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:53,772
Oh.

721
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,610
What are you, laughing? Please, could you just...

722
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,237
Okay, okay.

723
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:04,658
What do you see?

724
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,910
The sizing coils are malfunctioning.

725
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,412
Just let me...

726
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:10,289
Ow!

727
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,250
- Sorry. - It's all right.

728
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:18,255
Okay. All right.

729
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,174
Try that.

730
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:25,304
Sorry.

731
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,306
What?

732
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:32,144
Awesome.

733
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:34,271
If only Cap could see you now.

734
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:36,440
Hilarious. What are we gonna do?

735
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:48,660
Hey!

736
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:49,953
Where's your hall pass?

737
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,457
Hey, I'm talking to you.

738
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,168
Hey!

739
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,171
Hey. Eh...

740
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:25,697
You can do it.

741
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,950
You almost got it.

742
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,880
Oh, peanut.

743
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:55,852
Okay, let's go.

744
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:14,037
Hiya, champ, how was school today?

745
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:17,541
All right, get your jokes out now. Can you fix the suit?

746
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,167
So cranky.

747
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,920
You want a juice box and some string cheese?

748
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:24,047
Do you really have that?

749
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,267
Let's see if Foster was right.

750
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,240
This has gotta be the lab.

751
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,203
Let's go get it.

752
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:56,288
Yeah.

753
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,299
This seems right.

754
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:11,678
Look at us, teaming up twice in one day.

755
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:13,305
Makes you think, huh?

756
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,514
About what?

757
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,350
Germany.

758
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,392
What do you mean?

759
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:20,228
We were working together, training together...

760
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,856
and other stuffing together.

761
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,359
If I had asked you, would you have come?

762
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,069
I guess we'll never know.

763
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,779
But I do know one thing.

764
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:29,863
What?

765
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,783
If I had, you'd have never been caught.

766
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:41,958
Hey, Scott.

767
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,378
You think you can stop daydreaming about my daughter

768
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:45,962
long enough to get my lab?

769
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,964
- Yes, sir. - Thank you.

770
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:55,138
Okay, you're transmitting.

771
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:56,390
What took you so long?

772
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,934
Sorry, I had to come up with a name for my ant.

773
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:01,395
I'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

774
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:02,854
You like it?

775
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,189
Hilarious.

776
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,983
I'm not getting anything on the monitors.

777
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,319
There's some kind of electronic disturbance.

778
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:10,445
Be careful.

779
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,114
You know me, Hank. I'm always careful... Whoa!

780
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:14,991
It's okay. It's just the suit.

781
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:16,743
- How do you know? - Look.

782
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,707
That's Ghost?

783
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,166
What is she doing?

784
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,418
Do you think that suit is how

785
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:26,294
she goes through walls and stuff?

786
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,338
Let's just get outta here before she wakes up.

787
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,674
Hope, look! There's the lab.

788
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,348
Now, we're sure this is our shrunken building

789
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:39,391
and not somebody else's, right?

790
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,685
Just take it, Scott. Come on, we gotta be fast.

791
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:43,895
I'll get it.

792
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:46,982
Oh, shit...

793
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:02,038
Hope. Hope! Hank.

794
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:03,957
Guys.

795
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:06,334
I don't think they can hear you.

796
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:10,172
Hi.

797
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,257
I'm Ava.

798
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:13,925
Scott.

799
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:17,929
So, you don't need the suit...

800
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,808
to go through things.

801
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:23,602
No.

802
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:27,481
It just helps me control it.

803
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:32,736
And the pain, supposedly.

804
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:38,533
You're not gonna reach into my chest

805
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:39,951
and crush my heart, are you?

806
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:45,165
You're funny.

807
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:51,046
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott, unless I have to.

808
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,467
I need...

809
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:58,637
what's in your head.

810
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:13,985
Let's wake up the rest of the gang

811
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:15,320
and get this over with, shall we?

812
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:19,366
Get up!

813
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,159
Come on!

814
00:44:23,954 --> 00:44:25,038
Dad?

815
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,292
Don't ever touch him again.

816
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:30,836
Now, now, Hope...

817
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:33,421
I think I'm being rather gentle with your father,

818
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:34,714
all things considered.

819
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:37,425
What the hell are you talking about?

820
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:41,638
Another casualty of Hank Pym's ego.

821
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,015
Bill.

822
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:47,185
What have you done?

823
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:50,188
It's what you've done, Dr. Pym.

824
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:52,065
You're with her?

825
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:54,484
Oh, man. I thought you were cool.

826
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:56,236
What the hell is going on here?

827
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:58,864
I doubt Hank has ever mentioned my father.

828
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,324
Why would he?

829
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,577
Elihas Starr.

830
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:06,913
They were colleagues at S.H.I.E.L.D.

831
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,415
Quantum research.

832
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:13,169
Until my father dare disagree with the great Hank Pym.

833
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:15,005
You had him fired.

834
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,257
Oh, and discredited for good measure.

835
00:45:20,594 --> 00:45:24,723
My father tried to continue his research on his own.

836
00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:28,977
Desperate to restore his name, so he took risks.

837
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:30,145
No, no, no!

838
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:32,188
Too many.

839
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,358
Until something went wrong.

840
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:37,861
He told us to run.

841
00:45:38,028 --> 00:45:38,862
Elihas, what's happening?

842
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:40,447
Just go. Go!

843
00:45:40,614 --> 00:45:42,824
Daddy! Daddy!

844
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,284
I could tell he was scared.

845
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:50,707
Daddy!

846
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:51,958
Ava, no!

847
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,005
I didn't want him to be alone.

848
00:45:58,465 --> 00:45:59,758
No! No!

849
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,768
When I woke up, my parents were dead.

850
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:14,230
I wasn't so lucky.

851
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:22,030
They call it "molecular disequilibrium."

852
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,075
A rather dull name, I think.

853
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:28,119
Doesn't quite do justice to what it means.

854
00:46:28,662 --> 00:46:32,374
Every cell in my body is torn apart...

855
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,084
and stitched back together.

856
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,586
Over and over.

857
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:38,380
Every day.

858
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:41,800
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D. when I got the call

859
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:44,594
about a quantum anomaly in Argentina.

860
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:48,765
Hello, Ava.

861
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:51,518
My name's Bill.

862
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,145
I was a friend of your father's.

863
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,607
I brought you something.

864
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:04,280
It's all right. Try again.

865
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:07,075
That's it.

866
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,120
Dr. Foster did his best to keep me safe.

867
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:12,288
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.

868
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:15,000
saw an opportunity in my affliction.

869
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:19,838
They built me a containment suit,

870
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,464
so I could control my phasing.

871
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:23,967
And trained me to be a stealth operative.

872
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:26,344
They weaponized me.

873
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:29,264
I stole for them. Spied for them.

874
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:32,392
Killed for them.

875
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,978
And in exchange for my soul...

876
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,022
they were going to cure me.

877
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,110
They lied.

878
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:45,655
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed, I took Ava in.

879
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:47,824
I built the chamber to slow her decay,

880
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,075
but her condition was progressive.

881
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:50,869
I didn't know how to cure it.

882
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:54,706
She wanted to kill you, Hank, but I told her no...

883
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:56,082
and that she should watch you instead.

884
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:57,709
And sure enough, she discovered

885
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:59,044
that you were building the tunnel.

886
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:03,173
Then, she told me about Lang.

887
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:05,800
And the message from Janet inside his head,

888
00:48:05,884 --> 00:48:07,260
that's when I...

889
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:08,428
Christ's sake!

890
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:09,971
That's me. I'm sorry.

891
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,639
Look, can you tell me who's texting me?

892
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:14,392
"Cassie, 911 ."

893
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,478
That's my daughter. I need to text her back.

894
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:17,896
No, that's not happening.

895
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:19,939
What, it's 911. That means it's an emergency.

896
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,775
You're not making demands here, Lang.

897
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,902
You're not appreciating the gravity of the...

898
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:26,696
Okay, look, she's trying to video chat me now.

899
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:29,657
Something might be wrong. Let me talk to her. Please.

900
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,037
Cassie, are you okay? What's the emergency?

901
00:48:34,204 --> 00:48:35,914
I can't find my soccer shoes.

902
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:37,040
What?

903
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:38,291
I have a game tomorrow.

904
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:39,501
Hey, Scott, I know that they're there.

905
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,044
Can you just walk the phone around the house?

906
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:42,587
No, I can't do that right now.

907
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,506
- Why not? - Because I'm sick.

908
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:45,715
Hey, can you just maybe look around

909
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:46,716
later then and call me back?

910
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,218
Please? Thank you.

911
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:49,594
Bye, Daddy!

912
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,513
- Bye, peanut! - Feel better!

913
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:52,680
Feel better, buddy!

914
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:55,558
I'm sorry. It said emergency.

915
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,560
Ava, I want to help you.

916
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,729
She doesn't need your help. I know how to save her.

917
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:01,106
Oh, really? How?

918
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,273
Janet.

919
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:03,900
For the last 30 years, she's been down there

920
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:04,984
absorbing quantum energy.

921
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,528
We can extract that energy.

922
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,988
We can use it to repair Ava's molecular structure...

923
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:09,989
Extract it?

924
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,241
- Yes. - Are you insane?

925
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:12,992
That would rip Janet apart.

926
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,995
You don't know that. I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

927
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,455
When Janet's location

928
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:18,873
pops into Lang's head, he's gonna give it to me...

929
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,834
or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI.

930
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,668
What?

931
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:23,586
You are gonna stay here...

932
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:25,755
just in case I need your help.

933
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,091
Like hell I would help you!

934
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:29,425
You'll do whatever I say.

935
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:30,635
You're gonna kill Janet!

936
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,637
I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank.

937
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:35,265
Goddamn it, Bill!

938
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,183
- Dad? - Calm down, Hank.

939
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,060
So help me God...

940
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:40,770
The pills.

941
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:42,438
It's his heart! He needs his pills.

942
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:45,483
Please, Dr. Foster. They're in the tin. Please.

943
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:48,236
He could die!

944
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:49,445
Come on!

945
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:50,446
Help him!

946
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:52,198
Dad, just hang on, all right?

947
00:49:52,282 --> 00:49:53,575
Just keep breathing. Stay calm.

948
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,034
Help him, man! Come on!

949
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,077
The Altoid tin!

950
00:49:58,371 --> 00:49:59,247
Wait!

951
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:04,502
Thanks, guys.

952
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,462
Hank!

953
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,977
Bill is filling that girl's head with lies.

954
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:24,355
Elihas Starr was a traitor. He stole my plans.

955
00:50:24,606 --> 00:50:26,900
Now, bring it down. All right, lock it in.

956
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,611
No, no, no. The bolt is on the other side.

957
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,530
Tighten that one down, then bring it down one notch.

958
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:33,656
Good job.

959
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:35,074
It'll work.

960
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,243
Foster, he could have fried the entire system.

961
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:38,578
Look, we'll adjust the relays

962
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,455
while you go reprogram the settings, all right?

963
00:50:40,622 --> 00:50:42,248
It's going to be fine.

964
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:49,130
So, this is it.

965
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:51,257
Yeah. You'd think with all this time

966
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:52,884
to prepare I'd be more ready.

967
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:55,970
Oh, going subatomic isn't something you can prepare for.

968
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,514
It kind of melts your mind.

969
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,516
I mean seeing my mom again.

970
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:01,851
Oh.

971
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:05,730
What if she's a completely different person?

972
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:08,316
Yeah, like, uh, George Washington.

973
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:09,859
I'm serious, Scott.

974
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,070
Or George Jefferson.

975
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,949
What if she's forgotten about me?

976
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,160
When I was in prison...

977
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:21,871
the only thing that got me through was Cassie.

978
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:23,289
I could have been locked up for 100 years...

979
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:24,791
I never would have forgotten her.

980
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:29,087
I know your mom is counting the minutes

981
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,130
until she can see you again.

982
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:33,883
Thank you.

983
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,225
Hey.

984
00:51:42,392 --> 00:51:43,726
We got a big problem.

985
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:44,811
You forgot the motion sensor lights

986
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:45,687
on the back of the building.

987
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,313
Oh, no.

988
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,982
And they're on the proposal,

989
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:50,566
and Karapetyan asked for them specifically.

990
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:54,112
Uh, yeah, look, it's been a little crazy.

991
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:56,823
Look, maybe I could stop by tomorrow, take a look at it.

992
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,865
No. No, no, no, no.

993
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,200
The meeting is first thing in the morning.

994
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:00,451
You gotta come right now and fix it.

995
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,870
I can't. I wish I could, but I can't leave.

996
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,038
You know what, I'm coming to you.

997
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:06,624
I'll just bring the plans. They're on the laptop.

998
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,084
And you can fix them there.

999
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,460
Just tell me where you are, okay?

1000
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:10,545
It's complicated.

1001
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:12,005
What do you mean it's complicated?

1002
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:18,136
As you can see, sir,

1003
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,263
this system is state of the art.

1004
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:22,682
Security of tomorrow, today.

1005
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:24,017
Oh, that's so good!

1006
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,685
And I love the lean-in, bro. Keep practicin'.

1007
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:26,811
Hey, I just gotta drive up to Scotty's,

1008
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:27,812
so we can fix the plans.

1009
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:29,397
But don't worry, I'll be back in plenty of time.

1010
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:31,858
- As you can see... - Oh, oh, oh!

1011
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,319
Tell me you got the van washed for tomorrow morning.

1012
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:36,029
Down to the undercarriage, baby.

1013
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:37,530
You sprung for the undercarriage wash?

1014
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:38,906
Well, you said get the works.

1015
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,159
That's a scam, bro. We live in California, not Minnesota.

1016
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:42,493
He's right.

1017
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:45,371
The undercarriage wash,

1018
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:46,956
that's for cleaning off road salt...

1019
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:50,335
laid down in our more snow-laden sister states.

1020
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,669
Who are you, and why do you know so much

1021
00:52:51,753 --> 00:52:52,962
about car wash protocol?

1022
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,465
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

1023
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:58,134
And I do my research, Luis.

1024
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:02,680
To wit, I have learned from a friend of mine...

1025
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,474
at the FBI that you are

1026
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:06,184
a known associate of Scott Lang...

1027
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:09,312
a known associate of Hank Pym, who I've also learned...

1028
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:12,106
has a portable shrinking laboratory...

1029
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,650
filled with all kinds of juicy tech.

1030
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:17,487
And you're gonna tell me where it is.

1031
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:19,155
Well, I hate to break it to you,

1032
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:21,366
but I don't know what you're talking about.

1033
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:24,452
Well, I sense a resistance in you, Luis.

1034
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:27,497
And I have promised results to some dangerous people.

1035
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:31,501
So, I'm gonna introduce you to my good friend, Uzman.

1036
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,045
Now...

1037
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:36,047
Uzman is a master

1038
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,174
at extracting information from the unwilling...

1039
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:39,801
through psychoactive means.

1040
00:53:41,803 --> 00:53:43,137
Oh, is that truth serum?

1041
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,723
There's no such thing as truth serum.

1042
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,225
That's just nonsense from TV.

1043
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:49,018
Well, what is it then?

1044
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:50,770
It's a little concoction

1045
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:53,564
that he's been perfecting since his days with the S.I.S.

1046
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:56,609
It makes you suggestible and highly responsive.

1047
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:57,819
Well, dude, that's truth serum.

1048
00:53:57,902 --> 00:53:58,653
No, it's not.

1049
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,823
No offensing, but they sound like truth serum to me.

1050
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:04,033
- Right? - It's not a truth serum.

1051
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,535
Okay. Hey, I believe you.

1052
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:06,911
It's not a truth serum.

1053
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:10,373
I mean, if it walk like duck and talk like ducks...

1054
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,582
The truth serum.

1055
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,501
Well, I have a lot of allergies...

1056
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:15,503
so you might wanna think about that.

1057
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,133
We've got to get that lab back.

1058
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:22,385
What?

1059
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:25,721
The chamber and the suit are barely helping anymore.

1060
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,100
How long have I got?

1061
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:33,980
A couple of weeks, maybe.

1062
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:38,568
Well, then we'll make them bring the lab back.

1063
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:39,694
How?

1064
00:54:40,862 --> 00:54:43,114
Lang. He has a daughter, right?

1065
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:44,323
You can't mean that.

1066
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,867
Ava!

1067
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:49,662
I tolerate a lot of the things you do out there...

1068
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:51,664
but I won't be a part of anything like that.

1069
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,374
You're not the one who's about

1070
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:55,209
to fade away into nothing, Bill.

1071
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:56,419
I am!

1072
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:59,088
You said you could fix me!

1073
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,426
You promised.

1074
00:55:03,593 --> 00:55:05,428
I know. I will.

1075
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:06,888
But not like that.

1076
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:11,476
You lay one finger on that little girl...

1077
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:14,437
I won't help you. And we're done.

1078
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:21,694
Fine.

1079
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,655
There are other options.

1080
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:40,671
You know what? You're right. This isn't truth serum.

1081
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,048
Because I don't feel anything.

1082
00:55:42,215 --> 00:55:43,925
That was a lie. I do feel something.

1083
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:44,967
This is truth serum!

1084
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:46,093
There's no such thing!

1085
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,803
Okay.

1086
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,139
Okay, okay.

1087
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:52,600
Now, I'm gonna make this real easy for you, Luis.

1088
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:54,185
Okay.

1089
00:55:56,229 --> 00:55:59,315
Where is Scott Lang?

1090
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:00,858
Well, see, that's complicated.

1091
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,818
Because when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place.

1092
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,445
And I'm not talkin' about cell block D.

1093
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:06,113
His wife had just filed for divorce, and I was, like...

1094
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,199
"Damn, homie. She dumped you when you're on lockup?"

1095
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:09,325
And he was, like, "Yeah, I know.

1096
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:10,326
"I thought I was gonna be with her forever...

1097
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:11,452
"but now I'm all alone."

1098
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:12,662
And I was, like, "Damn, homie. You know what?

1099
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,080
"You gotta chin up, because you'll find a new partner.

1100
00:56:14,247 --> 00:56:15,498
"But you know what? I'm Luis."

1101
00:56:15,665 --> 00:56:16,749
And he says, "You know what? I'm Scotty,

1102
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:17,875
"and we're gonna be best friends."

1103
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:18,918
Okay, hold on, hold on.

1104
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:20,628
I like a good story as much as the next person...

1105
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:21,963
but what in the hell does this have to do

1106
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:23,214
with where Scott Lang is?

1107
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:24,215
I'm getting there. I'm getting there.

1108
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:25,633
You put a dime in him,

1109
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:26,926
you gotta let the whole song play out.

1110
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:28,803
He like human jukebox.

1111
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:30,638
Oh, my abuelita had a jukebox in the restaurant!

1112
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:33,015
Yeah, only played Morrissey.

1113
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:34,642
And if anybody ever complained, she'd be like...

1114
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,311
You know, Chicanos, we call him "Moz."

1115
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:38,437
Then, ¡adios!

1116
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:39,981
What can I say? We relate to his

1117
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,399
melancholy ballads, you know?

1118
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:42,817
- Lang! - Right, right, right.

1119
00:56:42,984 --> 00:56:44,026
So, anyway, Scotty gets out of jail,

1120
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,069
and he starts working for Hank.

1121
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:46,404
That's when he met Hope. And Hope's all, like...

1122
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:47,905
"I want nothing to do with you.

1123
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:49,615
"Look at my hairdo, I'm all business."

1124
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:50,741
And then Scotty's, like,

1125
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:51,826
"You know what, girl? My heart is all broken.

1126
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:53,035
"And I'll probably never find love again,

1127
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,245
"but damn if I want to kiss you!"

1128
00:56:54,412 --> 00:56:55,371
But then you fast forward

1129
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:56,414
and they're all into each other, right?

1130
00:56:56,581 --> 00:56:57,456
And then Scotty's, like,

1131
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,791
"You know what? I can't tell you this...

1132
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:00,876
"but I'm gonna go trash an airport with Captain America."

1133
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:02,628
And then she said, "I can't believe you split like that!

1134
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,255
"Smell you later, dummy."

1135
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:05,464
So, Scotty goes on house arrest.

1136
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,133
And he won't admit it, but his heart is all, like...

1137
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,718
"Damn! I thought Hope could a been

1138
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:10,553
"my new true partner, but I blew it!"

1139
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,721
But fate brought 'em back together.

1140
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:12,847
And then Hope's heart is all...

1141
00:57:13,014 --> 00:57:14,599
"I'm worried that I can't trust him...

1142
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,350
"and he's gonna screw up again, and ruin everything!"

1143
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:17,727
And then my heart is all, like...

1144
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,645
"That fancy raspberry filling represents the company's red

1145
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:21,522
"and we're days away from going out of business. Oh!"

1146
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:22,523
"Out of business"?

1147
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,566
"Days away"?

1148
00:57:23,733 --> 00:57:24,692
Damn truth serum!

1149
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:26,902
I was trying to protect you guys. I swear to God.

1150
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,946
I was trying to be a good boss, but we're broke!

1151
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:29,947
And the Karapetyan's our last hope.

1152
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:30,948
And if we don't show up, we're done!

1153
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:32,241
That's terrible bossing!

1154
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:33,284
Damn, bro!

1155
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:34,452
- That's on me! That's on me! - Hey!

1156
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:37,204
Enough.

1157
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,375
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

1158
00:57:42,585 --> 00:57:44,045
Where is Scott Lang?

1159
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,171
I've been trying to tell you,

1160
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:46,213
he's in a tricky spot, emotionally speaking.

1161
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,715
Emotionally speaking.

1162
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:50,926
Well, where is Scott Lang, literally speaking!

1163
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:52,345
Oh! The woods.

1164
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:53,554
The woods?

1165
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,264
Baba Yaga!

1166
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:57,975
What do you mean, "the woods"?

1167
00:57:58,142 --> 00:57:59,226
The Muir Woods, the second fire road

1168
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:00,436
off the Panoramic Highway!

1169
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:01,729
For God's sake!

1170
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,399
Baba Yaga, come at night

1171
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,818
Little children, sleepy tight

1172
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,739
Damn it!

1173
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:14,784
If that freak gets Pym's tech...

1174
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,494
I'm never gonna see it.

1175
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:17,703
So, what do we do now?

1176
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:20,748
It's easier to steal it from the Feds

1177
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,166
than from the boogeyman.

1178
00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:27,755
Hey, it's me. How'd you like to get a promotion?

1179
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:31,634
I got the location on Pym, Van Dyne and Lang.

1180
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:33,052
But you gonna have to take 'em down now,

1181
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:34,887
because they ain't gonna be there for long.

1182
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:37,098
And when you do, you gonna get me that lab.

1183
00:58:37,807 --> 00:58:39,392
Understood.

1184
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:42,186
Good news, gentlemen.

1185
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:44,563
Feds are gonna do the hard work for us.

1186
00:58:45,231 --> 00:58:47,108
What are you lookin' at? Change my tires!

1187
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:48,109
Right.

1188
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,697
- Sir. - Can you knock?

1189
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:55,908
Sorry, sir. Uh, but I just got a lead.

1190
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,869
Ooh, I love leads.

1191
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:06,836
System's in the green.

1192
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:08,587
Priming the coils.

1193
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:12,007
Full charge.

1194
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:13,175
As soon as the tunnel's open...

1195
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:14,427
let us know if you get anything

1196
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:15,469
that could be a part of her message.

1197
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:16,971
Yeah, yeah. I will.

1198
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,641
Okay, then.

1199
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:24,270
Here it goes.

1200
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:39,744
We did it!

1201
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:41,787
You got anything?

1202
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:45,916
Nothin'.

1203
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,794
Well, just give it a minute, because it could...

1204
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:51,464
No.

1205
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,215
No, no, no, no!

1206
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:54,258
What's happening?

1207
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:56,135
It's shutting down. Maybe our vectors are off.

1208
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:58,596
We've gone over them a million times, I know they're right!

1209
00:59:58,763 --> 00:59:59,680
Then what else could it be?

1210
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,640
I don't know!

1211
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,064
- Scott, what are you doing? - Scott, get away from that!

1212
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:10,107
Scott, you can't...

1213
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:11,942
I'm sorry, I don't know how much time I have.

1214
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,319
I need to fix the algorithm.

1215
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:17,865
Trust me, after 30 years down here...

1216
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:19,700
I've thought about it a lot.

1217
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,206
Janet?

1218
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:29,460
Hi, honey.

1219
01:00:32,922 --> 01:00:34,381
Jellybean.

1220
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,175
Mom?

1221
01:00:37,176 --> 01:00:38,803
It's not the reunion I'd imagined.

1222
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,721
It's all so rushed.

1223
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:43,182
You two have done such great work.

1224
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:45,309
You just need a little...

1225
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:47,019
nudge.

1226
01:01:02,243 --> 01:01:04,745
Janet, how is this possible?

1227
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:07,706
It wasn't a message you put

1228
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,124
in Scott's head. It was an antenna.

1229
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:10,835
Clever girl.

1230
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:13,337
I'm so proud of you.

1231
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,214
Honey, tell us where you are.

1232
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:16,966
Tell us how to find you.

1233
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:18,968
No, the probability fields are too complex.

1234
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:20,469
That's why I needed to talk to you.

1235
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:22,054
You have to follow my voice.

1236
01:01:22,471 --> 01:01:23,556
Of course!

1237
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:25,599
Like tracing a call back to its source!

1238
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:33,691
I'm tracking your signal using subatomic frequencies...

1239
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:36,110
between point two and point nine.

1240
01:01:36,277 --> 01:01:37,820
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1241
01:01:37,987 --> 01:01:39,113
That's too tight. We could miss you.

1242
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,865
Look at us squabbling again.

1243
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:44,451
Fine. All right, between three and seven.

1244
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:47,997
Our first fight in decades, and it's over just like that.

1245
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,138
Bullseye.

1246
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:05,890
Source lock.

1247
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:07,558
It's you.

1248
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:09,768
We got it!

1249
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:12,479
You have to meet me at these exact coordinates.

1250
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,149
In the wasteland, beyond the quantum void.

1251
01:02:15,316 --> 01:02:16,483
It's very dangerous,

1252
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,611
especially on the human mind, so be careful.

1253
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:21,322
Time and space work very differently down here.

1254
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:22,865
You have two hours.

1255
01:02:23,032 --> 01:02:24,700
After that, the probability fields will shift...

1256
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:25,826
and it'll be another century

1257
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,369
before they align like this again.

1258
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:29,538
We'll find you.

1259
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:38,380
I know you will, Jellybean.

1260
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,428
Nope.

1261
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:46,430
Nothing. I got nothing. No sign of Janet.

1262
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:47,640
Perfect.

1263
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:51,101
How did we get up here?

1264
01:02:56,023 --> 01:02:57,691
All right, first you're gonna see all kinds of lights...

1265
01:02:57,858 --> 01:02:58,984
and it's gonna get really trippy...

1266
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:01,862
but then it's gonna turn black and silent. Really silent.

1267
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:03,489
Scott, I'll be fine.

1268
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:05,157
I'm just saying because I've been down there.

1269
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:06,659
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

1270
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:11,705
Um, sorry. I have to take this.

1271
01:03:12,957 --> 01:03:14,291
Hey, man, you coming?

1272
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:16,043
No, I'm not, but you know what? Ghost is.

1273
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:18,295
And you know what? The Feds, they know where you are.

1274
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:19,713
- What? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1275
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:21,131
Uh, they gave me some truth serum.

1276
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:22,091
And then all of a sudden

1277
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:23,342
I started talkin' all honestly.

1278
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:25,135
Like, I hate the way that you load the dishwasher.

1279
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:26,428
I hate it, I hate it.

1280
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:27,429
- Uh... - But you need to go home...

1281
01:03:27,596 --> 01:03:29,056
because the Feds are probably going there now!

1282
01:03:29,223 --> 01:03:30,099
And by the way...

1283
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:32,893
who puts the plates on the top rack? They don't go there!

1284
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:43,904
I feel like such a jerk.

1285
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:46,407
You're gonna be really mad. We gotta go now.

1286
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,491
What?

1287
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:49,702
Ghost knows where we are. So does the FBI.

1288
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:50,953
How?

1289
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,038
- I told Luis where we are. - You what?

1290
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:54,206
I told him to come here so I could help him

1291
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:55,416
with the Karapetyan proposal.

1292
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:56,667
Oh, my God!

1293
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,836
Look, we need to land that account.

1294
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,129
Otherwise, we lose the business!

1295
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:01,171
Do you know hard it is for ex-cons

1296
01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:02,089
to find work these days?

1297
01:04:02,256 --> 01:04:03,632
Jesus, Scott!

1298
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:14,768
90 seconds to close the aperture!

1299
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:16,687
You have to depolarize the coils first!

1300
01:04:16,854 --> 01:04:17,563
I know!

1301
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,189
I'm really sorry...

1302
01:04:19,982 --> 01:04:22,526
but the, um, FBI is coming to my place so...

1303
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:24,153
I have to go.

1304
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:27,614
Can I borrow the suit?

1305
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:30,492
Gyroscopic stabilizers.

1306
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:32,369
Powering on.

1307
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:34,455
I'm just gonna borrow the suit.

1308
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:36,874
I'll come back. Just tell me where you'll be.

1309
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:38,584
- Don't bother. - What?

1310
01:04:38,751 --> 01:04:39,835
We'll come and get the suit from you,

1311
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:41,003
as soon as we've found my mom.

1312
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:43,338
- Hope... - Scott, just go!

1313
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:02,524
- Scott? - Daddy?

1314
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:03,776
It's us, buddy!

1315
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:06,153
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

1316
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,696
He must be resting.

1317
01:05:07,863 --> 01:05:08,947
Honey, why don't you go upstairs

1318
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:10,115
and look under your bed?

1319
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:12,451
Daddy, you upstairs?

1320
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:15,037
Daddy?

1321
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:17,247
What the...

1322
01:05:18,499 --> 01:05:21,001
He really lives like a pig these days.

1323
01:05:24,213 --> 01:05:25,380
Daddy?

1324
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:34,640
Spread out!

1325
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:35,891
Again?

1326
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:37,351
You people have no shame!

1327
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:39,353
The monitor says that he's in the bathroom.

1328
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,479
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

1329
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,192
Cassie, let the man get by!

1330
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:46,902
But Daddy's super sick!

1331
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:48,278
I'll see about that!

1332
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,322
He says he doesn't want anyone else to get sick!

1333
01:05:50,489 --> 01:05:51,740
I'll take my chances, sweetie.

1334
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:54,118
He barfed. Like, a lot.

1335
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:55,744
Young lady, I'm a federal agent.

1336
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:57,913
I've seen worse things than vomit.

1337
01:05:58,705 --> 01:05:59,706
Like, "a lot" a lot?

1338
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,583
- Yes! - Forget it, move aside!

1339
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:03,001
No!

1340
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,507
Woo!

1341
01:06:10,217 --> 01:06:12,261
- What are you doing here? - Scott.

1342
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,431
I'm sorry, I'm just really sick.

1343
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,724
I told you.

1344
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:19,184
Excuse me.

1345
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:21,854
Sometimes you gotta just get it out. You know?

1346
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,313
Sorry.

1347
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:31,530
I'll start the van.

1348
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:33,866
You get the lab.

1349
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,203
Freeze! You're surrounded!

1350
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:53,719
Hank Pym...

1351
01:06:53,886 --> 01:06:55,304
Hope Van Dyne...

1352
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,638
you're under arrest.

1353
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,516
This is harassment!

1354
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:00,809
Actually, it's not.

1355
01:07:00,976 --> 01:07:02,436
What does the FBI even stand for...

1356
01:07:02,603 --> 01:07:04,980
"Forever Bothering Individuals"?

1357
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,483
- His monitor check out? - Of course it does.

1358
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:10,360
Damn it!

1359
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,905
Looks like I just got fed a bowl of malarkey.

1360
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:15,157
We got 'em sir. Pym and Van Dyne are in custody.

1361
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:17,492
Seriously? Yes!

1362
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:20,537
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

1363
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:22,331
They're your friends. That's insensitive.

1364
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:24,750
I just really needed a win, you know?

1365
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,418
Anyway, I'll be back later

1366
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:27,794
for the official end of your sentence!

1367
01:07:28,337 --> 01:07:29,880
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

1368
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:32,090
You should feel great about yourself!

1369
01:07:55,948 --> 01:07:56,949
What is it?

1370
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:58,075
We have a man down.

1371
01:07:58,242 --> 01:07:59,993
And Pym's lab is gone.

1372
01:08:08,252 --> 01:08:09,253
Hey.

1373
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:12,839
Thanks for covering for me.

1374
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:14,049
Sure.

1375
01:08:16,802 --> 01:08:18,095
So...

1376
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:21,348
how long have you been Ant-Man again?

1377
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,603
Not long.

1378
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,438
It just sort of happened.

1379
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,274
I'm sorry for lying to you...

1380
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,150
and I'm sorry for risking everything.

1381
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:33,235
Daddy, it's okay.

1382
01:08:33,402 --> 01:08:34,528
It's not.

1383
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,947
I do some dumb things...

1384
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:39,408
and the people that I love the most pay the price.

1385
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:40,575
Mainly you.

1386
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:42,995
Trying to help people isn't dumb.

1387
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,457
I screw it up just about every time.

1388
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:50,836
So, maybe you just need someone watching your back...

1389
01:08:51,003 --> 01:08:52,254
like a partner.

1390
01:08:52,421 --> 01:08:53,338
Well, she's made it clear

1391
01:08:53,422 --> 01:08:54,756
that's about the last thing she wants.

1392
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:56,049
Who?

1393
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:57,509
Hope.

1394
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:01,263
Wait, who did you think?

1395
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:02,306
Me.

1396
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:03,890
You?

1397
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,559
Don't laugh.

1398
01:09:06,018 --> 01:09:07,394
I'd be a great partner.

1399
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:09,271
Aw, peanut.

1400
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:13,650
Aw. You would be awesome. And if I let you...

1401
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:16,028
I would be a terrible dad.

1402
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:17,696
Fine.

1403
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:20,574
Then have Hope be your partner. She's smart.

1404
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:23,785
She reminds me of you.

1405
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,455
You gonna go help her?

1406
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,623
I think you should help her.

1407
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,792
I wish I could...

1408
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:34,504
but I don't know how I could help her without hurting you.

1409
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:39,384
You can do it.

1410
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,803
You can do anything.

1411
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:45,015
You are the world's greatest grandma.

1412
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,524
Agent Woo will see you in an hour.

1413
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:56,651
An hour? We don't have an hour.

1414
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:59,071
Oh, you got somewhere else to be?

1415
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:08,955
Oh, now, that's my girl.

1416
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,506
All right, what's our plan?

1417
01:10:19,174 --> 01:10:20,884
To shrink that wall.

1418
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:22,260
It looks load-bearing.

1419
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:23,595
The ceiling could collapse.

1420
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:25,263
Then we run like hell.

1421
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,599
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents on the floor.

1422
01:10:27,766 --> 01:10:29,601
Roughly five times that in the building at large.

1423
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:31,061
They're all heavily armed.

1424
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:32,354
Not great odds.

1425
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:34,189
You got any better ideas?

1426
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:35,357
Nope.

1427
01:10:36,191 --> 01:10:38,110
And I'm not giving up on Mom.

1428
01:10:38,485 --> 01:10:40,237
She'd be so proud of you.

1429
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:46,660
Okay.

1430
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:48,954
One...

1431
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:50,622
two...

1432
01:10:55,836 --> 01:10:56,795
Scott?

1433
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,588
What're you two just standing around for?

1434
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,215
We gotta go find that lab.

1435
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:02,175
What about me?

1436
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:04,719
Perfect.

1437
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,638
Hurry up and get dressed. We don't have much time.

1438
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:21,445
Okay, now what?

1439
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:23,155
You're asking me?

1440
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:26,950
Get in!

1441
01:11:32,414 --> 01:11:33,290
Hi.

1442
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:34,875
Hi.

1443
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:40,672
Uh, excuse me. Are we planning on leaving soon...

1444
01:11:40,839 --> 01:11:42,591
or are you two gonna keep staring at each other...

1445
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:44,676
until they start shooting at us?

1446
01:11:45,177 --> 01:11:46,595
Yeah.

1447
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,684
- Hey, Burch. - Yeah.

1448
01:11:52,851 --> 01:11:53,768
Yeah, they're out.

1449
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:55,270
I'm on my way.

1450
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,485
Her suit is missing, and so is the van.

1451
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:02,819
How could this happen?

1452
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:04,696
I mean, what the dickens?

1453
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,492
Thank you.

1454
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:10,494
You're welcome.

1455
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:14,581
So, uh, how do we find the lab?

1456
01:12:14,748 --> 01:12:15,999
After we lost it the first time...

1457
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:18,960
I put on a new tracker...

1458
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:20,795
of sorts.

1459
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:31,223
That'll work.

1460
01:12:58,041 --> 01:12:59,751
Is it ready or not?

1461
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,796
We can begin the extraction process.

1462
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,881
Listen, Ava.

1463
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:06,758
This whole thing could be very dangerous.

1464
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:08,760
Maybe we should...

1465
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:11,471
Maybe we should what? Wait?

1466
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:13,765
I've got days until I'm dead.

1467
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:17,435
We're doing this, Bill. Now.

1468
01:13:20,522 --> 01:13:23,608
Energy readings show they have not used the tunnel yet.

1469
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:24,943
We don't have much time before

1470
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:26,152
Mom's location shifts, and we lose her.

1471
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,154
Yeah, and we have a lot to do before then.

1472
01:13:28,822 --> 01:13:30,240
You know, my pep-pep always said,

1473
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:32,158
"if you want to do something right, you make a list."

1474
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:33,493
So, we should do that.

1475
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,787
One, we have to break into that lab.

1476
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:38,415
Two, we have to kick out Foster and Ghost.

1477
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:40,709
Three, we're gonna have to fight Ghost.

1478
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:43,295
That seems like it should be part of two. 2-A, all right?

1479
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,005
Let's call it 2-A.

1480
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:46,506
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1481
01:13:46,673 --> 01:13:48,216
Oh, also, we have to make sure that the lab

1482
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:49,593
is fully grown for you to come back.

1483
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:50,760
Otherwise, we're screwed.

1484
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:51,636
Scott!

1485
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:52,679
You want me to start again? I'll start again...

1486
01:13:52,846 --> 01:13:54,556
I'm going to dive.

1487
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:58,476
The only chance we got is if the two of you are out here...

1488
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:01,771
together, protecting the tunnel.

1489
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:04,774
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

1490
01:14:06,234 --> 01:14:08,320
Let me get her.

1491
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:11,615
I think he's right.

1492
01:14:18,747 --> 01:14:20,915
"Whassup?"

1493
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:25,629
You don't remember, uh, that beloved commercial?

1494
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:27,714
"Whassup?"

1495
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:30,550
I had him follow us.

1496
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:33,595
I thought we could use some help.

1497
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,389
All right. I'm in position.

1498
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:37,599
The ants are headed in.

1499
01:14:37,766 --> 01:14:38,975
Copy that.

1500
01:14:39,059 --> 01:14:40,226
Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.

1501
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,229
- Do you want Pez? - No.

1502
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:45,482
Cassie gave me this for my birthday.

1503
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:48,068
By the way, I love that suit!

1504
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:50,195
Thanks, man.

1505
01:14:50,779 --> 01:14:53,281
I wish I had a suit.

1506
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:57,577
I would even like a suit with minimal powers, you know?

1507
01:14:57,744 --> 01:15:01,414
Or maybe even just a suit, with no powers.

1508
01:15:16,346 --> 01:15:17,222
What is it?

1509
01:15:18,098 --> 01:15:20,058
Don't know.

1510
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:25,063
It's them!

1511
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:29,067
They can't be far.

1512
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:52,841
All right, Hank. Hank?

1513
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,678
Dad, what's your status?

1514
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:58,763
Foster's taken care of.

1515
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:00,473
Suiting up now.

1516
01:16:04,978 --> 01:16:06,646
I just wanted to save Ava.

1517
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:09,441
She's facing death or something far more terrible.

1518
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:10,650
She's afraid.

1519
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:14,571
I'll help you find a cure when I get back.

1520
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:16,322
I promise.

1521
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,992
Together, we'll figure something out.

1522
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,704
Good luck, Hank.

1523
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:24,831
Thanks, Bill.

1524
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:28,209
Now, I'm gonna need you to step back.

1525
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:48,730
Time remaining, 15 minutes.

1526
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,691
Hank's in, Scott.

1527
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:52,776
Any sign of her?

1528
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:54,068
No, nothing yet.

1529
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:01,242
Ava!

1530
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:06,122
Call off the ants, Scott.

1531
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:07,457
Oh, boy!

1532
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:32,148
Can I get a status report?

1533
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:33,817
'Cause I got some serious Ghost problems here!

1534
01:17:37,362 --> 01:17:38,446
Ready to dive.

1535
01:17:45,203 --> 01:17:47,205
- In case I don't make it... - Don't.

1536
01:17:47,539 --> 01:17:48,957
Don't say that.

1537
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:51,334
I can't lose you, too.

1538
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:52,794
I love you, Hope.

1539
01:17:54,546 --> 01:17:56,631
Guys, everything's bad over here.

1540
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:13,857
Now.

1541
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:24,993
Misdirection.

1542
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:26,661
One of the first things they teach you

1543
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:29,122
at Online Close-up Magic University.

1544
01:18:31,082 --> 01:18:31,916
No!

1545
01:18:35,503 --> 01:18:36,963
Plan worked. We got it, Scotty!

1546
01:18:38,006 --> 01:18:39,090
Meet us at the rendezvous point.

1547
01:18:39,257 --> 01:18:40,550
Okay, on my way!

1548
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:41,634
Oh, no.

1549
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:47,849
Really? This guy again?

1550
01:18:48,016 --> 01:18:49,100
Who?

1551
01:18:49,267 --> 01:18:51,269
I told you our business wasn't over.

1552
01:18:53,313 --> 01:18:54,564
Change of plans.

1553
01:18:58,192 --> 01:18:58,985
Hang on.

1554
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:10,371
I want that lab, boys, whatever it takes.

1555
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:21,007
Hold on.

1556
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:36,648
That undercarriage is filthy!

1557
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:38,232
Oh, they got bigger problems.

1558
01:19:43,613 --> 01:19:44,656
Hope, what're you doing?

1559
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:46,074
You're heading away from the rendezvous point!

1560
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,325
Don't worry,

1561
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:48,493
I'm taking these guys on the scenic route.

1562
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,703
Wait, what're you... Oh.

1563
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:12,350
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! We're gonna die!

1564
01:20:13,101 --> 01:20:14,644
We're gonna die!

1565
01:20:26,614 --> 01:20:28,574
Signal lost.

1566
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:31,077
What the hell are they doing up there?

1567
01:20:33,705 --> 01:20:35,081
Recalibrating.

1568
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:52,181
Recalibrating.

1569
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:57,145
You never said it was so beautiful, Scott.

1570
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:03,901
Recalibrating.

1571
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:09,741
Okay, any time now.

1572
01:21:10,116 --> 01:21:12,160
Recalibrating.

1573
01:21:14,954 --> 01:21:16,664
- Recalibrating. - Come on.

1574
01:21:17,415 --> 01:21:19,792
Signal restored.

1575
01:21:32,597 --> 01:21:34,140
Bikes, it's all you.

1576
01:21:37,894 --> 01:21:39,479
- Take the wheel. - What? Wait! Whoa.

1577
01:21:48,738 --> 01:21:52,617
Well, the 60's were fun, but now I'm paying for it.

1578
01:21:52,784 --> 01:21:54,243
Be careful up there!

1579
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,496
Hey, give me a break! I haven't driven in two years!

1580
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:27,693
Oh, you got pezed!

1581
01:22:30,071 --> 01:22:30,863
Up here!

1582
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:35,284
Oh, that's not good.

1583
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:40,414
Hope!

1584
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,879
- No! - No!

1585
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:53,386
There it is, right there. Get the lab!

1586
01:22:53,553 --> 01:22:54,595
Get the lab!

1587
01:23:03,771 --> 01:23:05,940
I've got her. Westbound on Fremont.

1588
01:23:08,526 --> 01:23:10,778
Hope! Wait!

1589
01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:12,446
Hey, what about me?

1590
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:22,540
We got you now, Ava!

1591
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:25,251
Whoa! Oh!

1592
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,318
Not again!

1593
01:23:51,986 --> 01:23:53,404
Piece of junk!

1594
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:58,284
Ah! Yes!

1595
01:24:00,578 --> 01:24:02,246
Go, go, go, go, go!

1596
01:24:04,081 --> 01:24:06,125
Burch got the lab.

1597
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,419
I'm going after him.

1598
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:18,930
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1599
01:24:22,016 --> 01:24:23,643
Work in progress, my ass...

1600
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:40,159
Scott, where are you?

1601
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:41,744
I've got Burch in my sights. Hurry!

1602
01:24:41,911 --> 01:24:42,995
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming!

1603
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:44,705
We're running out of time.

1604
01:24:47,917 --> 01:24:50,503
Warning, approaching quantum void.

1605
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:17,947
I'm coming to you, honey.

1606
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:06,078
Guys.

1607
01:26:06,245 --> 01:26:09,248
Don't you need the remote to the lab? I just found it.

1608
01:26:09,457 --> 01:26:10,583
We can't grow the lab without it.

1609
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:11,834
Get it to us fast.

1610
01:26:12,001 --> 01:26:13,085
Yeah, but the van is busted.

1611
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:14,670
Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.

1612
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:18,591
What?

1613
01:26:24,013 --> 01:26:25,973
I love you, Dr. Pym.

1614
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:27,350
The remote! We're missing the remote!

1615
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:28,476
You gotta check the van!

1616
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:33,064
Huh?

1617
01:26:37,068 --> 01:26:38,027
Awesome!

1618
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:06,180
Hey, I'm going down Pacific.

1619
01:27:06,347 --> 01:27:07,556
Burch's boys are all over me.

1620
01:27:07,723 --> 01:27:08,808
I'm on my way.

1621
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:11,018
Right. I'll get the lab.

1622
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,481
Hi.

1623
01:27:17,024 --> 01:27:18,150
Oh, that's badass!

1624
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:28,202
Nice.

1625
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:38,295
Doink!

1626
01:27:44,218 --> 01:27:45,719
Come here, you little weasel!

1627
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:47,596
No, you don't!

1628
01:27:50,558 --> 01:27:52,643
I guess maybe you do.

1629
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:54,895
Come on!

1630
01:28:06,282 --> 01:28:09,368
Anyone see a Southern gentleman carrying a building?

1631
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:16,000
How'd he even have time to buy a ticket?

1632
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:19,128
Would you just one time,

1633
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:20,588
please work!

1634
01:28:21,672 --> 01:28:22,548
Yes!

1635
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:24,175
All right, I need help.

1636
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:26,427
Yes!

1637
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:29,680
Oh. Sorry. Ah...

1638
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:31,515
Somebody!

1639
01:28:31,682 --> 01:28:33,184
Hey! Come on, man!

1640
01:28:34,393 --> 01:28:35,728
Not cool!

1641
01:28:35,895 --> 01:28:37,062
Murderers!

1642
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,733
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1643
01:28:41,942 --> 01:28:44,904
I'm gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas!

1644
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,405
You're a badass!

1645
01:28:46,864 --> 01:28:48,365
Yes!

1646
01:28:50,618 --> 01:28:51,869
No, no, no!

1647
01:28:52,036 --> 01:28:53,621
Ant-onio!

1648
01:28:55,998 --> 01:28:57,583
Our friends, the humpbacks,

1649
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,543
dip in here to the San Francisco Bay...

1650
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:01,754
for a little leisure and a little breeding.

1651
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:03,130
Listen, Uzman...

1652
01:29:03,297 --> 01:29:05,424
And perhaps they're down below as we speak, doing the nasty.

1653
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:07,259
Just meet me at the waterfront.

1654
01:29:07,343 --> 01:29:08,469
In three hours.

1655
01:29:08,636 --> 01:29:09,803
Oh, folks. We've barely left the dock...

1656
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:11,764
but it looks like we got some company.

1657
01:29:14,725 --> 01:29:15,893
Look. Right there. Do you see it, folks?

1658
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,229
There it is. There's a breach.

1659
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,773
What the...?

1660
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:28,614
Hi. Sorry. Hi.

1661
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:30,991
It's okay. It's okay!

1662
01:29:31,158 --> 01:29:33,744
Sorry, I know I'm not a whale. This will just take a second.

1663
01:29:33,911 --> 01:29:35,996
Hey! That doesn't belong to you!

1664
01:29:36,163 --> 01:29:37,623
No, no! No, no!

1665
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:38,749
You're embarrassing yourself now.

1666
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:41,835
Come on. Let go.

1667
01:29:41,919 --> 01:29:42,920
Thank you.

1668
01:29:45,381 --> 01:29:47,132
I'll take this now.

1669
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:04,316
It melts your mind.

1670
01:30:06,193 --> 01:30:07,695
A message in your head.

1671
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:11,198
I had a dream.

1672
01:30:11,365 --> 01:30:13,033
Daddy? Where's Mommy?

1673
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,618
It's where I hid every time that we played.

1674
01:30:14,785 --> 01:30:15,828
I love you, Hank.

1675
01:30:32,428 --> 01:30:33,637
Daddy?

1676
01:30:38,142 --> 01:30:39,435
Daddy?

1677
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:45,274
Dad? What's going on?

1678
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:46,609
Why haven't you found Mom?

1679
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:51,530
You look lost, Hank. Are you all right?

1680
01:30:53,616 --> 01:30:55,909
Still think you have all the answers, Hank?

1681
01:31:51,799 --> 01:31:53,592
It's me.

1682
01:32:07,064 --> 01:32:09,024
I'm so sorry...

1683
01:32:11,318 --> 01:32:12,569
it took so long.

1684
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:13,987
No.

1685
01:32:15,698 --> 01:32:16,782
No.

1686
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:19,034
You're here now.

1687
01:32:20,494 --> 01:32:21,787
Let's go home.

1688
01:32:24,081 --> 01:32:25,499
I thought I was gone.

1689
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:29,253
But that energy from your hands...

1690
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:30,838
how did you do that?

1691
01:32:33,674 --> 01:32:36,635
I'm not the same woman I was 30 years ago, Henry.

1692
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:38,262
This place...

1693
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:41,265
it changes you.

1694
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:46,270
Adaptation is part of it, but some of it is...

1695
01:32:46,437 --> 01:32:47,646
evolution.

1696
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:52,192
Lab coordinates not found.

1697
01:32:52,526 --> 01:32:53,736
Do not ascend.

1698
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:56,113
I should probably tell you

1699
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:58,115
what we're dealing with up there.

1700
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:02,619
I got the lab. I got the lab.

1701
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:05,080
Move. Move.

1702
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:07,708
Move!

1703
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:10,043
Get out of the way.

1704
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:16,800
Let's go.

1705
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:22,097
No one here appears to be sure what this is.

1706
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:25,100
It's gotta be 80-85 feet tall.

1707
01:33:30,022 --> 01:33:32,024
Get out of the way!

1708
01:33:32,983 --> 01:33:36,069
I got the lab.

1709
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:39,156
The air feels chunky.

1710
01:33:39,323 --> 01:33:40,866
Oh, no. He's too big.

1711
01:33:44,828 --> 01:33:45,788
Scotty!

1712
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:46,830
Scott!

1713
01:33:46,997 --> 01:33:48,832
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1714
01:33:48,999 --> 01:33:51,877
I'm just gonna go to sleep now for five minutes.

1715
01:33:52,044 --> 01:33:53,545
I just need five minutes.

1716
01:33:54,922 --> 01:33:56,048
Five minutes!

1717
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:04,431
You get the lab somewhere safe.

1718
01:34:04,598 --> 01:34:07,184
- Scott's air won't last. - Okay.

1719
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:22,950
Move!

1720
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:25,911
Move! Move!

1721
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:28,872
No, wait!

1722
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:41,969
Lab at full scale.

1723
01:34:42,261 --> 01:34:43,220
They did it.

1724
01:34:43,387 --> 01:34:44,638
Ready to ascend.

1725
01:34:44,805 --> 01:34:46,431
Let's go see our daughter.

1726
01:35:08,871 --> 01:35:09,913
Scott!

1727
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:12,791
Scott!

1728
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:15,002
Scott, come on, wake up!

1729
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:31,643
Come on. Come on, where are you, Scott?

1730
01:35:33,604 --> 01:35:35,105
Gotcha.

1731
01:35:39,276 --> 01:35:40,444
Scott?

1732
01:35:46,825 --> 01:35:47,701
Hey.

1733
01:35:47,868 --> 01:35:48,702
Hey.

1734
01:35:51,163 --> 01:35:53,624
Hey, Scotty! Hope, come in.

1735
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:55,626
Did you get crushed by the building?

1736
01:35:58,921 --> 01:36:00,255
Where's the remote, Luis?

1737
01:36:00,881 --> 01:36:02,549
It's probably in there.

1738
01:36:03,383 --> 01:36:04,676
I don't have it. I don't have it.

1739
01:36:04,927 --> 01:36:06,637
I guess this is where we say...

1740
01:36:07,304 --> 01:36:08,764
Adiós, amigo.

1741
01:36:09,222 --> 01:36:10,849
No, no, no, no!

1742
01:36:14,019 --> 01:36:14,978
Thanks, guys.

1743
01:36:21,735 --> 01:36:22,736
Ava?

1744
01:36:23,403 --> 01:36:24,863
Ava!

1745
01:36:28,241 --> 01:36:29,242
Ava!

1746
01:36:29,409 --> 01:36:30,744
Almost ready for extraction.

1747
01:36:30,911 --> 01:36:33,163
Please, stop! People are getting hurt!

1748
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:35,832
Everything hurts. Don't talk to me about pain!

1749
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:37,584
What if Hank is right?

1750
01:36:37,751 --> 01:36:39,419
What if this process kills Janet?

1751
01:36:39,586 --> 01:36:40,837
What, you're worried about her?

1752
01:36:41,004 --> 01:36:42,923
All I'm saying is that she is a brilliant scientist.

1753
01:36:43,090 --> 01:36:44,299
She may be able to help.

1754
01:36:44,466 --> 01:36:46,927
Oh, she will help. Right now!

1755
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:48,929
And if she dies, she dies!

1756
01:36:49,096 --> 01:36:51,807
No, no. I'm sorry, we can't do this.

1757
01:36:51,974 --> 01:36:53,976
We have to find another way.

1758
01:36:57,104 --> 01:36:59,106
This is the way.

1759
01:37:20,252 --> 01:37:21,503
Janet!

1760
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:33,640
She started the extraction.

1761
01:37:33,807 --> 01:37:35,809
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

1762
01:37:44,943 --> 01:37:45,944
No!

1763
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:21,396
Hope!

1764
01:38:38,455 --> 01:38:39,539
Are you okay?

1765
01:38:54,429 --> 01:38:56,223
Mom?

1766
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:05,774
Oh, my God.

1767
01:39:10,695 --> 01:39:12,280
We found you.

1768
01:39:16,118 --> 01:39:17,869
I missed you so much.

1769
01:39:18,537 --> 01:39:20,789
I missed you too, Jellybean.

1770
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,501
It's okay.

1771
01:39:24,668 --> 01:39:27,671
I'm here now. We have time.

1772
01:39:29,548 --> 01:39:31,716
No more last-minute business trips, okay?

1773
01:39:32,217 --> 01:39:34,136
I promise.

1774
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:35,303
No, it's okay!

1775
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:37,222
It's all right. Just don't worry about me.

1776
01:39:37,389 --> 01:39:39,141
- I'll be fine. - Dad.

1777
01:39:44,312 --> 01:39:45,897
Scott.

1778
01:39:46,064 --> 01:39:47,732
Miss Van Dyne.

1779
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:50,902
It's nice to...

1780
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:52,529
Well, I guess we've already met.

1781
01:39:52,696 --> 01:39:55,073
Yeah. I guess we have.

1782
01:39:58,285 --> 01:39:59,119
Wait.

1783
01:40:07,627 --> 01:40:09,004
Your pain.

1784
01:40:10,881 --> 01:40:12,215
I can feel it.

1785
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:16,052
It hurts.

1786
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:20,056
It always hurts.

1787
01:40:22,976 --> 01:40:24,477
I'm sorry.

1788
01:40:27,606 --> 01:40:29,691
I think I can help you.

1789
01:41:03,975 --> 01:41:05,936
Did you know she could do that?

1790
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:10,774
It's okay.

1791
01:41:13,276 --> 01:41:14,611
Guys, the cops are coming!

1792
01:41:14,945 --> 01:41:15,946
Whoa.

1793
01:41:18,031 --> 01:41:20,867
The cops are coming. Like, all of 'em!

1794
01:41:21,326 --> 01:41:23,161
- I gotta go. - We gotta go!

1795
01:41:24,287 --> 01:41:25,538
What about them?

1796
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:30,335
Hands in the air!

1797
01:41:30,502 --> 01:41:32,712
- No! We are going to our jobs. - No.

1798
01:41:32,879 --> 01:41:34,923
You see, we see these guys. They trying to shoot people.

1799
01:41:35,090 --> 01:41:38,301
So we apprehended them. For you. You're welcome.

1800
01:41:38,468 --> 01:41:40,470
We traffic in stolen technology.

1801
01:41:40,637 --> 01:41:42,514
And we have killed many, many people.

1802
01:41:42,681 --> 01:41:44,140
Uh, he's in charge.

1803
01:41:44,307 --> 01:41:45,308
That's true, I am.

1804
01:41:46,142 --> 01:41:47,227
I've also committed

1805
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:49,521
numerous health code violations in my restaurant.

1806
01:41:49,688 --> 01:41:51,898
Some of them would shock you.

1807
01:41:54,818 --> 01:41:57,195
It is truth serum.

1808
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:02,784
We gotta get outta here.

1809
01:42:02,951 --> 01:42:04,536
Fast.

1810
01:42:05,704 --> 01:42:07,205
I have an idea.

1811
01:42:07,664 --> 01:42:08,957
Giant figure, now spotted

1812
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,333
at the intersection of Broadway and Laguna.

1813
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,543
All units move in.

1814
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:13,086
Go, go!

1815
01:42:16,172 --> 01:42:17,590
There he is!

1816
01:42:22,804 --> 01:42:24,264
It's over, Scotty!

1817
01:42:24,431 --> 01:42:26,558
I'm sorry, but we got you, man!

1818
01:42:27,392 --> 01:42:29,227
Come on. It's the end of the line, pal.

1819
01:42:29,394 --> 01:42:30,729
There's nowhere to hide.

1820
01:42:32,522 --> 01:42:35,650
Just pull off that Band-Aid! You lost! It's okay!

1821
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,821
Damn it, Scotty, reduce yourself!

1822
01:42:45,952 --> 01:42:47,537
Magic.

1823
01:42:49,706 --> 01:42:50,707
Damn it!

1824
01:42:50,874 --> 01:42:52,625
Get to Lang's, now!

1825
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:01,009
Well done, honey.

1826
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:02,635
Let's go!

1827
01:43:10,769 --> 01:43:11,770
Leave me here.

1828
01:43:11,936 --> 01:43:13,021
We can make it.

1829
01:43:13,188 --> 01:43:14,272
You said it yourself.

1830
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:17,692
I've hurt people.

1831
01:43:17,859 --> 01:43:19,527
But you haven't.

1832
01:43:19,694 --> 01:43:21,237
Go. Please!

1833
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:22,697
We can make it, Ava.

1834
01:43:23,198 --> 01:43:24,616
Bill...

1835
01:43:25,283 --> 01:43:26,826
I'm not leaving you.

1836
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:12,080
Oh, hey, guys.

1837
01:44:12,455 --> 01:44:14,374
Are my two years up already?

1838
01:44:21,172 --> 01:44:23,049
What's it like out there?

1839
01:44:23,216 --> 01:44:26,261
Huh? I mean, do people still dance?

1840
01:44:26,428 --> 01:44:28,513
Are food trucks still a thing?

1841
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,473
Well, you got away with it this time, Scott...

1842
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:33,852
but, uh, I'll be seeing you again.

1843
01:44:34,269 --> 01:44:35,103
Where?

1844
01:44:36,187 --> 01:44:37,021
Huh?

1845
01:44:37,105 --> 01:44:38,731
Where will you be seeing me again?

1846
01:44:39,732 --> 01:44:43,027
Like, in general...

1847
01:44:43,194 --> 01:44:45,029
The next time you do something bad,

1848
01:44:45,113 --> 01:44:46,573
- I'll be there to catch you... - Oh.

1849
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:48,658
You'll be watching...

1850
01:44:48,825 --> 01:44:51,244
I thought you were inviting me somewhere.

1851
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:53,621
Why would I do that?

1852
01:44:53,913 --> 01:44:56,291
That's what I was wondering, why would you do that?

1853
01:44:56,458 --> 01:44:57,959
Like a party, or like, dinner or something?

1854
01:44:58,126 --> 01:45:00,044
I don't know. I thought you planned the evening.

1855
01:45:00,211 --> 01:45:01,463
I meant, "I'll arrest you later, again."

1856
01:45:01,546 --> 01:45:02,755
Of course, that would be strange.

1857
01:45:02,922 --> 01:45:04,716
- Take it easy, Jimmy. - Okay.

1858
01:45:05,717 --> 01:45:07,177
Did you want to grab dinner, or something?

1859
01:45:07,343 --> 01:45:09,512
I mean, because I'm free...

1860
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,014
Yeah. Come on.

1861
01:45:20,523 --> 01:45:21,357
You ready?

1862
01:45:21,524 --> 01:45:22,525
Yeah!

1863
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:26,196
- Hi. - Hi. Hi.

1864
01:45:27,405 --> 01:45:28,615
Oh!

1865
01:45:29,365 --> 01:45:31,743
Yes, that was us. How can I help you?

1866
01:45:32,410 --> 01:45:33,411
X-Con Security.

1867
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:35,914
Mr. Karapetyan?

1868
01:45:36,748 --> 01:45:37,749
Yeah, you saw that?

1869
01:45:38,708 --> 01:45:42,712
It would be an honor to be in business with you as well.

1870
01:45:42,879 --> 01:45:44,380
I'll see you Thursday, 9:00 AM. Okay.

1871
01:45:45,215 --> 01:45:46,216
Yeah!

1872
01:45:46,633 --> 01:45:49,260
That's how you close a deal!

1873
01:46:17,413 --> 01:46:19,123
This is awesome.

1874
01:46:19,916 --> 01:46:21,251
So, Cassie...

1875
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:23,002
what do you want to be when you grow up?

1876
01:46:23,419 --> 01:46:25,255
I wanna help people...

1877
01:46:25,421 --> 01:46:26,548
like my dad.

1878
01:46:27,549 --> 01:46:28,550
Really?

1879
01:46:29,926 --> 01:46:31,553
I wanted to be his partner.

1880
01:46:31,761 --> 01:46:33,304
But he said he wants you.

1881
01:46:34,305 --> 01:46:35,515
Is that so?

1882
01:46:40,186 --> 01:46:41,563
Daddy!

1883
01:46:42,397 --> 01:46:44,065
Whoa! Hold on.

1884
01:46:44,274 --> 01:46:46,150
Move, get outta here!

1885
01:46:46,359 --> 01:46:48,069
Scott, don't, don't, don't!

1886
01:46:48,361 --> 01:46:50,530
Ow.

1887
01:46:50,655 --> 01:46:52,407
Oh, gross!

1888
01:46:52,532 --> 01:46:54,784
Ugh. I hate that moth dust!

1889
01:46:55,159 --> 01:46:58,913
Go! Shoo! Shoo!

1890
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,167
I used to be a respected scientist.

1891
01:49:08,376 --> 01:49:11,295
I had my name on the sides of buildings.

1892
01:49:11,796 --> 01:49:12,839
Now, I got this.

1893
01:49:13,589 --> 01:49:16,551
Well, you wanted a smaller quantum tunnel.

1894
01:49:16,718 --> 01:49:19,303
This is... smaller.

1895
01:49:20,722 --> 01:49:24,016
Oh. Sorry. My bad.

1896
01:49:24,142 --> 01:49:26,018
Ah, I think it has flair.

1897
01:49:27,562 --> 01:49:29,439
All right. Control's online.

1898
01:49:32,817 --> 01:49:34,944
The collection unit activates when you decouple it.

1899
01:49:35,153 --> 01:49:36,946
It should automatically start absorbing

1900
01:49:37,029 --> 01:49:38,322
quantum healing particles.

1901
01:49:38,781 --> 01:49:41,451
Also, make sure you stay out of the tardigrade fields.

1902
01:49:41,576 --> 01:49:42,952
They're cute, but they'll eat you.

1903
01:49:43,077 --> 01:49:45,079
And don't get sucked into a time vortex.

1904
01:49:45,163 --> 01:49:46,330
We won't be able to save you.

1905
01:49:49,417 --> 01:49:50,710
Okay.

1906
01:49:51,794 --> 01:49:53,171
Going subatomic in five...

1907
01:49:54,464 --> 01:49:55,465
four...

1908
01:49:56,048 --> 01:49:56,966
three...

1909
01:49:57,467 --> 01:49:58,468
two...

1910
01:49:58,718 --> 01:49:59,552
one.

1911
01:50:03,222 --> 01:50:05,808
All right, Scott, this is a mic check.

1912
01:50:10,813 --> 01:50:12,815
Mic check, one, two. One, two.

1913
01:50:12,982 --> 01:50:15,485
How's everybody doing tonight in the quantum realm?

1914
01:50:15,735 --> 01:50:16,778
Scott, we read you.

1915
01:50:16,944 --> 01:50:18,529
I just wanna make sure.

1916
01:50:24,118 --> 01:50:25,161
Okay.

1917
01:50:25,328 --> 01:50:28,080
Healing particles secured for our new Ghost friend.

1918
01:50:28,247 --> 01:50:29,207
Great.

1919
01:50:29,373 --> 01:50:31,000
Preparing for re-entry in...

1920
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:33,753
five, four, three...

1921
01:50:37,256 --> 01:50:38,633
Hello?

1922
01:50:39,759 --> 01:50:41,719
Ha, ha. Very funny.

1923
01:50:41,886 --> 01:50:43,221
Hank, quit screwing around.

1924
01:50:43,387 --> 01:50:45,765
You told me yourself not to screw around.

1925
01:50:46,599 --> 01:50:47,600
Hank?

1926
01:50:49,143 --> 01:50:50,269
Hope?

1927
01:50:50,895 --> 01:50:51,896
Janet.

1928
01:50:53,105 --> 01:50:54,106
Guys.

1929
01:50:55,358 --> 01:50:56,901
Guys.

1930
01:50:57,527 --> 01:50:58,986
Okay, seriously, don't joke around.

1931
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:00,279
Bring me up, let's go.

1932
01:51:00,738 --> 01:51:01,405
Guys!
