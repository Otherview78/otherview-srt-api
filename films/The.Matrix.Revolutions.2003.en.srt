1
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:24,711
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:26,421
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:28,256
Should we try to contact them?

4
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:30,383
Won't matter.
My gut says they're down.

5
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,636
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.

6
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:35,263
I was afraid you'd say that.

7
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,099
Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

8
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,727
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

9
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:44,606
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- Then the sooner we find them the better.

10
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,781
Thought you could use
something to eat.

11
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,657
Thank you.

12
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:57,368
Any change?

13
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,246
No.

14
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:05,126
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

15
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,921
At least until he wakes up.

16
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:12,258
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.

17
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:14,594
He'd better have some good answers.

18
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:17,931
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

19
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:22,185
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

20
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:25,647
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

21
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:31,986
Roland, I'd like to run
another search through the Matrix.

22
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,405
- For what?
- For Neo.

23
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:37,784
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

24
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,285
Please, for me.

25
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,507
This is what keeps bothering me.

26
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:54,676
What?

27
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:58,555
His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

28
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:01,641
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

29
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:05,144
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

30
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:20,159
The big <i>bupkes. Nada.</i>
He's not in there.

31
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:22,537
- Sir, I got the projections.
- How long?

32
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:27,250
Based on point of entry and past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

33
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,044
Jesus H. Christ.

34
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:34,841
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

35
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,177
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.

36
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,471
Make sure we're running
on as few pads as possible.

37
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,515
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

38
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:45,810
- Hey! You got a call.
- What?

39
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,355
Operator.

40
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,108
It's Seraph.

41
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:56,529
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

42
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,002
Good morning.

43
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:15,757
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

44
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:20,011
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

45
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,181
Are you lost, Neo?

46
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:30,396
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

47
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:36,486
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

48
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:39,948
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

49
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:44,077
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

50
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:48,790
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

51
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:52,293
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

52
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,381
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

53
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:15,608
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

54
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,569
One thing I've learned in all my years...

55
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:21,823
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

56
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:25,076
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.

57
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:32,083
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

58
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,128
I'm sorry this had to happen.

59
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,881
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

60
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,968
- ...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?

61
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:47,098
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

62
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,641
What choice?

63
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,936
To help you, to guide Neo.

64
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:57,025
Now, since the real test for any choice is
having to make the same choice again...

65
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:01,029
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

66
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,781
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

67
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:08,244
...because here I am, at it again.

68
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:12,290
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.

69
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:17,170
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

70
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:21,674
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

71
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:26,387
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

72
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:29,724
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

73
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:33,352
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

74
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,689
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.

75
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,691
The Merovingian.

76
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,404
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

77
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:48,159
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

78
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:52,080
For years he has protected me.

79
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,749
I hope he can do the same for you.

80
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,586
Please, follow me.

81
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,218
Oracle....

82
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,595
I know, Morpheus.

83
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:11,516
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

84
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:16,312
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

85
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,231
I don't.

86
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,067
I expect just what I've always expected:

87
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:25,530
For you to make up your own
damn mind. Believe me or don't.

88
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:31,119
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

89
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,705
He needs all our help.

90
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:37,792
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

91
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,293
No.

92
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,381
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

93
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:47,552
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

94
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,472
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

95
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,141
Yes, Papa.

96
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,649
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

97
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,611
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

98
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:10,491
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

99
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,660
We are most honored to meet you.

100
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:15,454
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

101
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:20,084
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

102
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:24,338
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

103
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,008
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

104
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:32,096
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

105
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,849
It's okay.

106
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:36,684
I don't have an answer.

107
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:40,396
- I don't even know where "here" is.
- This place is nowhere.

108
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,357
It is between your world and our world.

109
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:47,862
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

110
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:50,239
Why did I know
you were going to say that?

111
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:54,368
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

112
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,413
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

113
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,542
I know if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

114
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,962
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

115
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,756
Is that what you're doing here?

116
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:10,885
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

117
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:13,638
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

118
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,848
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:19,310
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.

120
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:22,230
The answer is simple.

121
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,196
I love my daughter very much.

122
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:33,908
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

123
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:36,786
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

124
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:39,622
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

125
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,167
If it does not, it is deleted.

126
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:47,004
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

127
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,926
- You do not understand.
- I just have never--

128
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:54,470
Heard a program speak of love.

129
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:59,600
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

130
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:04,146
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

131
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:09,568
I see that you are in love.

132
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:14,115
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

133
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:15,616
Anything.

134
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,785
Then perhaps the reason you are here...

135
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:21,247
...is not so different
than the reason I am here.

136
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,881
That's him.

137
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,885
- Get away! Get away from me!
- We don't want trouble.

138
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,972
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.

139
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,726
I can't help you!
No one can help you!

140
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,195
Oh, no!

141
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,167
Damn it!

142
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:55,216
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.

143
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:57,593
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

144
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,221
You think it has something
to do with me?

145
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:01,722
I cannot say.

146
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,725
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

147
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,770
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

148
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,689
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.

149
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,401
She promised she'd look after Sati
after we said goodbye.

150
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,569
Goodbye?

151
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,406
- You're not staying with her?
- It is not possible.

152
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:22,618
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

153
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:26,247
- My wife and I must return to our world.
- Why?

154
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:29,458
- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?

155
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,837
Karma is a word, like love.

156
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,797
A way of saying:

157
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,216
"What I am here to do."

158
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:41,011
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.

159
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,640
Grateful for my wonderful wife,
for my beautiful daughter.

160
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:48,936
They are gifts, and so I do
what I must do to honor them.

161
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,983
- Papa, the train!
- Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.

162
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,946
Can I carry that for you?

163
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:02,158
All right.

164
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:08,873
Hurry it up, I'm late!

165
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,254
Who are you?

166
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:17,214
- He is a friend.
- Rama!

167
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,801
I know you.

168
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:24,680
- So that's what they wanted.
- I need to get back.

169
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:28,225
I'll pay you whatever you want.

170
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,853
One way or another,
I'm getting on this train.

171
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,730
Oh, no, no, no.

172
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:35,816
You'll stay right here until
the Merovingian says different.

173
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,485
If I know him...

174
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:41,155
...you're gonna be here
for a long, long time.

175
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:45,409
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You don't get it.

176
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,162
I built this place.

177
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:52,666
Down here, I make the rules.
Down here, I make the threats.

178
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,175
Down here, I'm God.

179
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:07,348
Get on the train
or you'll stay here with him.

180
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:26,116
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.

181
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:29,036
No. We know what has to be done.

182
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,136
Shit.

183
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,875
You gotta be kidding.

184
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,086
Holy shit, it's wingless.

185
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,422
I get it.

186
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,425
You must be ready to die.

187
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,260
I need to speak with him.

188
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:31,098
Only way you're getting through
this door is over my big, dead ass.

189
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,225
So be it.

190
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:58,876
There are no weapons allowed
in the club.

191
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:02,463
At the bottom of this elevator,
there is a coat-check girl...

192
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,841
...and if we are lucky,
one man for checking weapons.

193
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,177
And if we're unlucky?

194
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:10,220
There will be many men.

195
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,725
Can I take your--? Oh, my God.

196
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,952
What in the hell?

197
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,540
I don't believe this.

198
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:52,382
Hey! Hey!

199
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,138
The prodigal child returns.

200
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:04,394
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?

201
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:09,316
Tell me, how many bullets
are there in those guns?

202
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,653
I don't know, but I don't think
you have enough.

203
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,656
- We only want to talk.
- Oh, yes.

204
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:21,203
I'm sure you do. You have fought
through Hel to do so. Yes?

205
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,580
I'll tell you what I will do.

206
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:27,709
Put down the guns, and I will promise
you a safe passage out of here.

207
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,504
- All three of us?
- Oh, yes, yes.

208
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,423
Of course.

209
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:05,205
Who could have guessed we'd see each
other so soon after our last meeting?

210
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,458
The Fates are too kind, eh?

211
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,129
And since you, my little Judas,
have brought them here...

212
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:17,134
...I can only surmise the fortuneteller
has found herself another shell?

213
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:20,554
Disappointing, but not unexpected.

214
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:24,224
I do hope, however, she has the good
manners to learn her lesson...

215
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,728
...and to remember that there is
no action without consequence.

216
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:32,983
And if you take something from me,
you will pay the price.

217
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,986
You know why we are here?

218
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,740
Come now, what kind of question
is this? Of course I know.

219
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,992
It is my business to know.

220
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,412
Some might think this is a strange
coincidence, but I do not.

221
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:52,127
I am curious, though,
as to how it actually happened.

222
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,421
- Do you know?
- No.

223
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,340
No?

224
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,675
I did not think so.

225
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,762
But it is always best to ask, huh?

226
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,014
We want to make a deal.

227
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:09,978
Always straight to business,
huh, Morpheus?

228
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:14,483
Okay. I have something you want.

229
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,610
To make a deal...

230
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:22,324
...you must have something
I want, yes?

231
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:26,787
And it so happens
there is something I want.

232
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:31,333
Something I have wanted
ever since I first came here.

233
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,294
It is said they cannot be taken...

234
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,047
...they can only be given.

235
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:38,548
What?

236
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,553
The eyes of the Oracle.

237
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:50,894
I told you before, there is no escaping
the nature of the universe.

238
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:53,814
It is that nature
that has again brought you to me.

239
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:57,651
Where some see coincidence,
I see consequence.

240
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:00,112
Where others see chance...

241
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:03,824
...I see cost.

242
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:09,287
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle...

243
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:12,749
...and I will give you back your savior.

244
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:17,671
It seems a perfectly fair
and reasonable deal to me.

245
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:19,756
Yes? No?

246
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:23,927
I don't have time for this shit.

247
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:58,420
You wanna make a deal?
How about this?

248
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:02,674
You give me Neo, or we all die,
right here, right now.

249
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:06,553
Interesting deal.

250
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:13,560
You are really ready to die
for this man?

251
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,314
- Believe it.
- She'll do it.

252
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:20,692
If she has to,
she'll kill every one of us.

253
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,360
She's in love.

254
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:28,575
It is remarkable how similar the pattern
of love is to the pattern of insanity.

255
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,368
Time's up.

256
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,079
What's it gonna be, Merv?

257
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,587
Okay. You got yourself in here...

258
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:43,340
...you can get yourself out.

259
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,347
Are you ready for us?

260
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,475
Almost, sir. They got
some pretty ancient hacks here.

261
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,811
- But you found Neo?
- Can't you see him?

262
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,897
No, sir. We were reading something,
but I couldn't tell what.

263
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,987
I can't leave yet.

264
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,325
I have to see her.

265
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:55,245
Now?

266
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,747
It's my last chance.

267
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,711
That's it. That's the secret.

268
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:05,046
- You've got to use your hands.
- Why?

269
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:08,175
Cookies need love like everything does.

270
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:11,428
Neo!

271
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:16,683
I was hoping to have these done
before you got here. Oh, well.

272
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,812
Sati, honey, I think it's time
for a tasting.

273
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,982
Take the bowl to Seraph
and find out if they're ready.

274
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:26,276
Okay.

275
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:29,404
- I'm glad you got out.
- Me too.

276
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:36,661
So do you recognize me?

277
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:40,040
- A part of you.
- Yeah, that's how it works.

278
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:43,043
Some bits you lose,
some bits you keep.

279
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,047
I don't yet recognize my face
in the mirror...

280
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:50,550
...but I still love candy.

281
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:54,387
No, thank you.

282
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:57,724
Remember what you were like
when you first walked through my door?

283
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:02,979
Jittery as a June bug.
And now, just look at you.

284
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:06,399
You sure did surprise me, Neo,
and you still do.

285
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:09,861
You gave me a few surprises too.

286
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:12,322
I hope I helped.

287
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:15,909
You helped me to get here,
but my question is, why?

288
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,869
Where is this going?

289
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:20,580
- Where does it end?
- I don't know.

290
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:24,251
- You don't know or you won't tell me?
- I told you before...

291
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:29,756
...no one can see beyond a choice they
don't understand, and I mean no one.

292
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:34,261
- What choice?
- It doesn't matter. It's my choice.

293
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,930
I have mine to make,
same as you have yours.

294
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:40,100
Does that include what things
to tell me and what not to?

295
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:41,518
Of course not.

296
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:43,895
Then why didn't you tell me
about the Architect?

297
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:48,275
About Zion and the ones before me?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

298
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:53,113
- Because it wasn't time for you to know.
- Who decided it wasn't time?

299
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:56,199
You know who.

300
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:05,125
I did.

301
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:08,962
Then I think it's time for me to know
a few more things.

302
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:10,880
So do I.

303
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:14,968
Tell me how I separated my mind
from my body without jacking in.

304
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,887
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels
by thinking it.

305
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:22,142
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.

306
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:27,814
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

307
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:31,526
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.

308
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,945
- Where?
- The source.

309
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:38,783
That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready.

310
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:44,914
You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.

311
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,669
The Architect told me that
if I didn't return to the source...

312
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,671
...Zion would be destroyed tonight.

313
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:56,176
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...

314
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:59,095
...but that man can't see
past any choice.

315
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:03,350
- Why not?
- He doesn't understand them. He can't.

316
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,186
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

317
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:10,398
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.

318
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:14,277
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

319
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,821
What's your purpose?

320
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:19,032
To unbalance it.

321
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,284
Why? What do you want?

322
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:25,372
I want the same thing you want, Neo.

323
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:28,458
And I'm willing to go
as far as you are to get it.

324
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,461
The end of the war.

325
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:33,505
Is it going to end?

326
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,383
One way or another.

327
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:40,345
Can Zion be saved?

328
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,558
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer
to that question, but....

329
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:51,272
If there is an answer, there's only
one place you're going to find it.

330
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:54,150
- Where?
- You know where.

331
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:59,239
And if you can't find the answer...

332
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:02,909
...then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

333
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:07,247
What does that mean?

334
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:14,879
Everything that has a beginning...

335
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:17,507
...has an end.

336
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:20,593
I see the end coming.

337
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,680
I see the darkness spreading.

338
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:25,265
I see death.

339
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:29,561
And you are all that stands in his way.

340
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:31,062
Smith.

341
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:36,359
Very soon, he is going to have the power
to destroy this world.

342
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:39,279
But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.

343
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:42,532
He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.

344
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,200
What is he?

345
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,286
He is you.

346
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:48,913
Your opposite, your negative.

347
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,667
The result of the equation
trying to balance itself out.

348
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:56,880
- And if I can't stop him?
- One way or another, Neo...

349
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,925
...this war is going to end.

350
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:05,972
Tonight, the future of both worlds
will be in your hands...

351
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:07,932
...or in his.

352
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:27,076
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

353
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,503
I need time.

354
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:44,761
- That figures.
- Captain Roland.

355
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:47,263
- What's up, Maggie?
- Bane is. He's conscious.

356
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,599
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.

357
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:59,609
I love that smell.

358
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:03,696
I sure am going to miss it.

359
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:07,408
- Oracle.
- I know.

360
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:08,910
I know.

361
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,788
Sati, honey.

362
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:15,208
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph.

363
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:18,169
Can I come back?
I would like to come back.

364
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:21,714
- I would like that too.
- Then I'll see you tomorrow.

365
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,886
I hope so, hon, I hope so.

366
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,910
I'm scared, Seraph.

367
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:54,455
Come.

368
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,335
He's following us.

369
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:48,301
Well, well, it's been a long time.

370
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:52,847
I remember chasing you
was like chasing a ghost.

371
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:54,974
I have beaten you before.

372
00:32:55,475 --> 00:33:00,938
Yes, true, but as you can see,
things are a little different now.

373
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:04,859
And you must be the last exile.

374
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:09,030
- The Oracle told me about you.
- Really?

375
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,115
What did she say about me?

376
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,242
That you were a bad man.

377
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:18,247
Oh, I'm not so bad,
once you get to know me.

378
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:51,447
The great and powerful Oracle,
we meet at last.

379
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:58,705
I suppose you've been
expecting me, right?

380
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:01,290
The all-knowing Oracle
is never surprised.

381
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:04,627
How can she be? She knows everything.

382
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:09,507
But if that's true, then why is she here
if she knew I was coming?

383
00:34:09,674 --> 00:34:11,718
Why wouldn't she leave?

384
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,726
Maybe you knew I would do that,
maybe you didn't.

385
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:23,479
If you did, that means you baked those
cookies and set that plate there...

386
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:25,356
...deliberately, purposefully...

387
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:29,569
...which means that you're sitting there
also deliberately, purposefully.

388
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,447
What did you do with Sati?

389
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:37,744
"Cookies need love
like everything does."

390
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:41,247
You are a bastard.

391
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,417
You would know, Mom.

392
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:50,590
Do what you're here to do.

393
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,092
Yes, ma'am.

394
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:42,308
I really wish I could help, but I just....
I don't remember any of it.

395
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:47,897
What about the cuts on your arms?
Those cuts are more than one day old.

396
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:51,108
Yeah, definitely.

397
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:53,569
You're right about that, sir.

398
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,406
They look like they
might be self-inflicted.

399
00:35:57,573 --> 00:36:01,828
But why would I do something
like that to myself?

400
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:06,833
Unless, of course, I wasn't myself.

401
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:11,671
But if I'm not me, then who am I?

402
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:20,555
- Has this man been tested for VDTs?
- Yes, sir. It was negative.

403
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:24,433
But he is showing a lot
of unusual neural activity.

404
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,937
Some cross-synaptic firing,
as well as signs of recent trauma...

405
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:31,941
...with fresh fibrotic scarring
throughout the cortex.

406
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:36,946
I want the truth. I don't care
what it takes. Make him remember.

407
00:36:58,384 --> 00:36:59,719
Sir, we found her.

408
00:36:59,886 --> 00:37:01,220
- The <i>Logos</i>?
- Yes, sir.

409
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,472
About time we had
some goddamn good news.

410
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:36,589
Are the thermals picking up
any signs of life?

411
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,258
No, sir. Nothing yet.

412
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:43,054
- What about the ship?
- Holographic says the hull's intact.

413
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,265
- Drop down and keep a man in the turret.
- Yes, sir.

414
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:00,529
Get a full diagnostic on that ship
as fast as humanly possible.

415
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:19,632
Careful, sir.

416
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:24,303
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.

417
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,831
What was that?

418
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:57,003
You can put that shit away,
boys. All she needs is a jump.

419
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:01,674
- Niobe.
- Morpheus.

420
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:08,014
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

421
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,017
We didn't know what happened after....

422
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:15,980
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

423
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:18,190
I'm happy to see you too.

424
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:20,943
- Did you get Neo out?
- Yes.

425
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,279
- How did you know about that?
- The Oracle.

426
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:26,032
- You saw her?
- Just before the sentinels found us.

427
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:30,703
- What did she tell you?
- The same thing she always does.

428
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:34,707
Exactly what I needed to hear.

429
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:39,211
In 12 hours, the machines
will breach the dock walls.

430
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:43,883
Every simulation we've run, we've seen
that once the machines are inside...

431
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,719
...the odds of our survival
decrease dramatically.

432
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:48,888
Thus, our primary objective must be...

433
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:52,516
...to destroy or disable the diggers
inside the dock.

434
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:56,896
If we can do that, perhaps we can
prevent them from reaching the city.

435
00:39:57,063 --> 00:40:00,232
If not, the only place we will be able
to mount a defense...

436
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,568
...will be at the entrance of the temple.

437
00:40:02,735 --> 00:40:05,488
It is small and will force
them into a bottleneck...

438
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:08,741
...allowing us to concentrate
the remainder of our defense.

439
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:12,119
We understand that you've requested
additional volunteers.

440
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:14,789
- That is correct.
- Precisely what size force...

441
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:18,209
...are you planning to commit
to the primary dock objective?

442
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,921
Right now, the entire APU Corps
and half the infantry.

443
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:25,091
- Half the infantry?
- If it were up to me, councillor...

444
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:28,552
...I'd take every man, woman and child,
put a gun in their hand...

445
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,596
...and march them into that dock.

446
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:33,516
Perhaps it is best
that it is not up to you.

447
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,684
Time will tell, councillor.

448
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:38,604
Commander, just one more question.

449
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:41,065
Has there been word
from the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>?

450
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:44,693
None, and at this point there's no reason
to expect there will be.

451
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,862
Perhaps.

452
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,447
But we can hope.

453
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:52,034
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.

454
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:06,882
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.

455
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:09,718
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

456
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:12,221
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

457
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,891
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

458
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,981
Kids, you stay here.

459
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:26,318
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

460
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,487
- I have to.
- Why?

461
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:30,823
Because I love him.

462
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,868
I love him the same as he loves me.

463
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:37,371
And if I were out there and he
were here, I know what he'd do.

464
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:41,834
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.

465
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:47,173
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...

466
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:51,218
...and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...

467
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:53,512
...what would you do?

468
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,561
Make shells.

469
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:14,200
What the shit is going on over here?

470
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:17,912
An accident, sir. I didn't see--

471
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:20,206
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?

472
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,666
A unit volunteer, sir.

473
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:27,046
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?

474
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:31,217
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

475
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:34,678
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.

476
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:37,973
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.

477
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:39,558
Okay, I'm 16.

478
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:43,312
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.

479
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:48,317
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.

480
00:42:48,943 --> 00:42:50,819
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

481
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,615
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

482
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:56,700
You do...

483
00:42:56,909 --> 00:43:00,496
...and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.

484
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:16,095
Okay, charge the igniter.

485
00:43:22,268 --> 00:43:24,144
She lives again.

486
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:27,606
Want us to patch an uplink to reload
the operations software, Sparky?

487
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:31,110
That'd be swell. Could you clean
the windshield while you're at it?

488
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:38,534
Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.

489
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:41,453
Looking good, except, uh....

490
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:45,332
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

491
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:48,711
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.

492
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:52,381
<i>- What's going on in there?</i>
- Whatever it is, it can't be good.

493
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:55,384
The machines have taken Junction 21.

494
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:59,430
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...

495
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:02,224
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.

496
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:06,979
We'll go first, hammer as deep
as we can, then blow our EMP.

497
00:44:07,146 --> 00:44:11,150
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

498
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:17,489
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

499
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:19,158
No, it's not.

500
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:22,411
There's another way. A support line.

501
00:44:22,578 --> 00:44:26,332
It drops down right here,
1000 meters short of 21.

502
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:30,544
If we're lucky, we may be able to
slip down without them ever knowing.

503
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:33,130
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

504
00:44:33,297 --> 00:44:35,341
- No one can pilot mechanical.
- I can.

505
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:37,509
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.

506
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:40,929
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.

507
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:45,726
So what? You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.

508
00:44:48,187 --> 00:44:49,813
Hi.

509
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,028
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.

510
00:44:56,195 --> 00:44:59,990
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

511
00:45:00,157 --> 00:45:02,284
- I know what I have to do.
- What?

512
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:05,704
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

513
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:08,540
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?

514
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,459
To go where?

515
00:45:11,377 --> 00:45:12,753
To the machine city.

516
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:19,551
I know it's difficult to understand.

517
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:22,262
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

518
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:23,889
I still have to go.

519
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:27,267
In 100 years, no ship has been
within 100 kilometers of it.

520
00:45:27,476 --> 00:45:30,145
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.

521
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:33,315
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
- No.

522
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:36,819
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...

523
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:39,071
...but do it without
wasting our ships.

524
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:42,199
- You have to believe me. I have to go.
- Bullshit!

525
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:45,577
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

526
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:49,581
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.

527
00:45:53,252 --> 00:45:57,256
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.

528
00:45:58,257 --> 00:46:01,218
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...

529
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:03,679
...with my ship
after that little speech.

530
00:46:03,846 --> 00:46:08,267
- But for chrissake, Niobe--
- I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

531
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:12,438
If we leave inside the hour,
we'll reach Zion as the machines do.

532
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:15,149
That's as good a plan as any.

533
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:19,069
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

534
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:27,786
Two ships, two directions.

535
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:31,123
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

536
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:34,960
- You've never believed in the One.
- I still don't.

537
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:36,837
Then why are you doing this?

538
00:46:38,422 --> 00:46:40,048
I believe in him.

539
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:43,886
Thank you.

540
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:51,810
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.

541
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:54,813
To make it easier for you to remember.

542
00:46:55,481 --> 00:46:57,649
What if I don't want to remember?

543
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,736
Why would you want that?

544
00:47:00,903 --> 00:47:03,989
What if I blew that EMP?

545
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:06,992
What if I did destroy those ships...

546
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:11,955
...and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?

547
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:17,002
If I did that...

548
00:47:17,169 --> 00:47:20,923
...it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

549
00:47:30,766 --> 00:47:35,020
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

550
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:45,030
I'm ready.

551
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:48,116
Trinity...

552
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:51,703
...there's something I have to say.

553
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,626
Something you need to understand.

554
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:01,672
I know I'm supposed to go.

555
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:04,132
But beyond that...

556
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,553
...I don't know. I....

557
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:11,640
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

558
00:48:13,392 --> 00:48:18,272
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.

559
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:21,108
Just like you knew the moment
you looked at me...

560
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:23,652
...that I was coming with you.

561
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:27,489
I'm scared, Trin.

562
00:48:27,823 --> 00:48:29,783
So am I.

563
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:34,246
It took me 10 minutes
to buckle up one boot.

564
00:48:35,247 --> 00:48:37,332
But I'll tell you something.

565
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:40,419
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...

566
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:43,589
...I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

567
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:48,719
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

568
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:50,429
No.

569
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:52,306
Nothing.

570
00:49:05,694 --> 00:49:07,988
<i>- Finished loading ammunition?</i>
- Just about.

571
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:10,490
Let's move it. We are out of time.

572
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:12,951
You're not leaving them anything?

573
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:15,287
He said he didn't need it.

574
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:22,628
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.

575
00:49:23,045 --> 00:49:24,880
Thank you.

576
00:49:29,718 --> 00:49:32,638
I can only hope you know
what you're doing.

577
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:34,222
Me too.

578
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:39,978
It was an honor, sir.

579
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:46,318
No, the honor is still mine.

580
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:03,251
<i>- We're ready, sir.</i>
- About damn time.

581
00:50:04,461 --> 00:50:08,048
We're already late, captain,
so let's hit it and hit it hard.

582
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,679
Bye, baby.

583
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:15,681
Take good care of them.

584
00:50:37,494 --> 00:50:39,287
Ready?

585
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:49,089
Engine's still firing.

586
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:51,883
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.

587
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:08,191
I should've known he'd
send his bitch first.

588
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:09,693
Bane.

589
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,988
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

590
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:15,157
Every time, I thought it was the last.

591
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:19,161
Every time, I was sure we had you,
but you'd slip through our fingers.

592
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:23,915
I really can't express
just how aggravating that can be.

593
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:27,252
What are you talking about?

594
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:32,674
I think I might enjoy killing you
as much as killing him.

595
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,777
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!

596
00:51:52,611 --> 00:51:55,197
You're gonna pay for that.

597
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:59,284
- Twenty-seven kilometers to go.
<i>- We got an emergency.</i>

598
00:51:59,451 --> 00:52:01,953
- What is it, AK?
<i>- It's Maggie, sir.</i>

599
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,331
<i>She's dead, murdered.
I think it was Bane.</i>

600
00:52:04,498 --> 00:52:07,000
Goddamn it.

601
00:52:08,919 --> 00:52:12,339
I knew it. I knew he was
out of his goddamn mind.

602
00:52:12,506 --> 00:52:14,299
He fired that EMP.

603
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:18,136
Goddamn it, I should have
beaten it out of him.

604
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,223
We searched the whole ship, captain.
He ain't here.

605
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:25,227
- I know where he is.
- The <i>Logos.</i>

606
00:52:26,895 --> 00:52:28,647
- We gotta go back.
- Too late.

607
00:52:28,814 --> 00:52:31,733
- What if they need our help?
- It's too dangerous.

608
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,819
- Why?
- Because if he's killed them...

609
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:35,570
...he'll control another EMP.

610
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:40,909
At this point, they're on their own.
Just like us.

611
00:52:42,494 --> 00:52:44,162
Mr. Anderson.

612
00:52:45,038 --> 00:52:49,000
I see you are as predictable in this world
as you are in the other.

613
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:51,002
- What?
- He's out of his mind.

614
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:54,130
It might appear that way.
But Mr. Anderson and I know...

615
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:57,175
...that appearances can be deceiving.

616
00:52:57,342 --> 00:53:01,179
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It'll all become clear in a moment.

617
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:04,599
Thank you for bringing me the gun.
You can set it down there.

618
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:06,852
Don't do it.

619
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:11,231
- Shoot. Shoot now.
- Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive.

620
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:14,693
Do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both.

621
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:19,865
Look at him. He knows
he should do it, but he won't.

622
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:23,034
- He can't.
- Do it.

623
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:34,045
Back away from the gun
and turn around.

624
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:42,387
Let her go.

625
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:58,612
Somehow familiar, isn't it?

626
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:02,949
We've been here before,
you and I, remember?

627
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:06,745
I do. I think of nothing else.

628
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:14,419
- Who are you?
- Still don't recognize me?

629
00:54:15,587 --> 00:54:20,091
I admit, it is difficult to even think
encased in this rotting piece of meat.

630
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:26,598
The stink of it filling every breath,
a suffocating cloud you can't escape.

631
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:30,685
Disgusting.

632
00:54:30,852 --> 00:54:36,608
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.

633
00:54:41,947 --> 00:54:45,283
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.

634
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:52,749
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.

635
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:54,876
Look past the flesh.

636
00:54:55,043 --> 00:55:00,382
Look through the soft gelatin of these
dull cow eyes and see your enemy.

637
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:05,470
- No.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.

638
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:08,765
- It can't be.
- There's nowhere I can't go.

639
00:55:08,932 --> 00:55:11,810
There is nowhere I won't find you.

640
00:55:11,977 --> 00:55:16,064
- It's impossible.
- Not impossible.

641
00:55:16,648 --> 00:55:18,149
Inevitable.

642
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:21,987
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

643
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:23,822
This is it. It's gotta be.

644
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:10,535
Oh, no.

645
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,640
I wish you could see yourself,
Mr. Anderson.

646
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:39,314
Blind messiah.

647
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:46,905
You're a symbol for all of your kind,
Mr. Anderson.

648
00:56:49,741 --> 00:56:51,910
Helpless.

649
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:56,456
Pathetic.

650
00:56:59,334 --> 00:57:03,671
Just waiting to be put out
of your misery.

651
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:10,428
I can see you.

652
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,107
It's not over, Mr. Anderson.

653
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:24,192
It's not over.

654
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,000
- Trinity!
- Neo.

655
00:57:42,544 --> 00:57:44,003
Neo.

656
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:50,135
Oh, no. Your eyes.

657
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:52,470
I'll be okay.

658
00:57:53,805 --> 00:57:55,974
It's all right, Trin.

659
00:57:57,725 --> 00:58:00,645
But I think you're gonna have to drive.

660
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:10,363
Seismic's projecting
22 minutes to breach.

661
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:14,200
They can't know we don't have an EMP.
They'll have to attack in waves.

662
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:19,038
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.
Order the APUs into position.

663
00:58:19,247 --> 00:58:20,748
Yes, sir.

664
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:53,281
Come on, move.

665
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:27,065
All right!

666
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:29,067
This is it.

667
00:59:29,234 --> 00:59:34,322
Now, you all know me,
so I'll just say this as simple as I can.

668
00:59:35,073 --> 00:59:38,910
If it's our time to die, it's our time.

669
00:59:39,077 --> 00:59:44,582
All I ask is, if we have
to give these bastards our lives...

670
00:59:44,749 --> 00:59:47,585
...we give them hell before we do!

671
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:49,754
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

672
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,438
- You scared, Charra?
- Shit, yeah.

673
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:10,024
But I'll make you a deal.

674
01:00:10,692 --> 01:00:13,736
You keep loading, I keep shooting.

675
01:00:15,947 --> 01:00:17,865
Deal.

676
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:30,295
- Holy Christ, would you look at that.
- Quiet.

677
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:33,673
- How far to the opening?
- 1.4 kilometers.

678
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:38,553
- We're still generating too hot a field.
- Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.

679
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,473
- Full manual. Drop down four pads.
- It'll bottom out.

680
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:55,820
- Easy, baby.
- Seven hundred meters.

681
01:00:58,323 --> 01:01:01,034
If we can just get close enough....

682
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:06,914
Six hundred meters.

683
01:01:07,999 --> 01:01:09,667
There.

684
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:18,843
Shit!

685
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:23,598
- Jig's up, here they come.
- Give me full power.

686
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:26,559
Man the gun turrets,
every goddamn one of them. Go!

687
01:01:26,726 --> 01:01:30,438
Ghost, you're the best gunner we have,
go with them. Morpheus, take his place.

688
01:01:47,747 --> 01:01:50,208
I'm coming, baby.

689
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:01,052
Here they come.

690
01:02:05,348 --> 01:02:09,477
<i>- Slow down, this ain't the</i> Logos.
- Hang on to your lunch, here we go.

691
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:21,280
Holy Christ, I didn't know
this ship could do that.

692
01:03:13,124 --> 01:03:14,667
Breach! The dock is breached!

693
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,648
Knuckle up!

694
01:03:50,912 --> 01:03:52,580
For Zion!

695
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:02,460
Shit.

696
01:06:07,256 --> 01:06:09,425
Come on, let's go.

697
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:16,557
Knuckle up!

698
01:06:31,656 --> 01:06:33,032
Reload!

699
01:06:34,742 --> 01:06:36,661
Reload nine!

700
01:06:43,334 --> 01:06:44,669
Go, go! Move, move!

701
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:58,683
Watch your left!

702
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:02,019
Don't let them through!

703
01:07:05,022 --> 01:07:06,565
Zuka!

704
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:45,312
Oh, my God.

705
01:07:58,826 --> 01:08:02,496
Where the hell's my infantry? I want
that goddamn machine taken down!

706
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:37,782
Dig this!

707
01:08:41,952 --> 01:08:43,287
Oh, shit!

708
01:09:03,015 --> 01:09:04,892
- Yeah!
- Bogey two at the breach point!

709
01:09:05,059 --> 01:09:06,310
Goddamn it!

710
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:34,505
Shit, she's got a fat ass.

711
01:09:43,806 --> 01:09:47,268
- Keep them off me!
- Christ, there's a shitstorm of them.

712
01:10:19,133 --> 01:10:21,802
- Captain, you see that?
- They're after the radio. Stop them!

713
01:10:29,602 --> 01:10:30,895
Damn it!

714
01:10:55,753 --> 01:10:57,212
Yeah.

715
01:11:08,933 --> 01:11:10,809
Grab my belt.

716
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:22,696
Just give me one clean shot.

717
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:31,288
Damn it!

718
01:11:53,477 --> 01:11:55,062
Charra!

719
01:11:59,984 --> 01:12:02,695
- I got incoming!
- We got a dock full of incoming!

720
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:05,322
- Yes, sir. But this is different, sir.
- What?

721
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:07,700
I think it's one of ours, sir.

722
01:12:07,866 --> 01:12:10,828
- That's impossible.
- Holographics are trying to confirm.

723
01:12:10,995 --> 01:12:12,746
Contact them.
I want access codes.

724
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:15,457
We're trying, sir.
There's no response.

725
01:12:16,792 --> 01:12:19,503
It's a trick. That's not one of ours,
it can't be.

726
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:23,507
That's a mechanical line.
No one can pilot mechanical.

727
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:37,021
- Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.
- Thirty degrees, 80.

728
01:12:40,024 --> 01:12:43,110
- Lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent.
- Sixty degrees.

729
01:12:45,946 --> 01:12:48,949
- Shit! Come on, keep up!
- I'm trying!

730
01:13:08,886 --> 01:13:11,638
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the <i>Hammer</i>, sir.

731
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:13,474
How can that be?

732
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,642
It's under attack, sustaining damage.

733
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:18,604
At present velocity,
it'll reach Gate Three in 12 minutes.

734
01:13:18,771 --> 01:13:21,148
Their EMP could take out every sentinel.

735
01:13:21,982 --> 01:13:25,402
It'd take out more than that.
It'll wipe out our defense system.

736
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:27,821
We blow an EMP inside,
we lose the dock.

737
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:30,282
Sir, we already lost the dock.

738
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:35,788
Open the gate.

739
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:41,835
Gate Three is not responding!
We've taken critical damage, sir!

740
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:44,254
We've lost control!
We can't open it!

741
01:13:54,014 --> 01:13:55,349
There's the exit.

742
01:13:55,516 --> 01:13:58,977
On my mark, give me full power
90 degrees to lower-left starboard.

743
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:01,230
Full power...

744
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,815
...ninety degrees.

745
01:14:09,113 --> 01:14:10,447
Now!

746
01:14:17,913 --> 01:14:19,957
Hold on, baby.

747
01:14:24,628 --> 01:14:26,463
Goddamn, woman, you can drive.

748
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,632
We ain't home yet.
What about the gate?

749
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,761
Sentinels are inside the dock.

750
01:14:34,138 --> 01:14:35,430
Are we too late?

751
01:15:05,002 --> 01:15:07,754
- How many APUs are operational?
- Thirteen, sir.

752
01:15:07,921 --> 01:15:09,923
Get me the one closest to Gate Three.

753
01:15:38,285 --> 01:15:39,578
Reload!

754
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:41,079
He's pissing metal.

755
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:46,084
Go!

756
01:16:00,599 --> 01:16:01,934
Go!

757
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,624
Heads up! They're coming around!

758
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:40,180
Behind you!

759
01:16:53,694 --> 01:16:55,570
It's jammed!

760
01:17:01,285 --> 01:17:04,037
Forget it, kid! Get out of here!

761
01:17:05,122 --> 01:17:06,790
Got it!

762
01:17:35,319 --> 01:17:37,154
Captain Mifune.

763
01:17:40,282 --> 01:17:42,200
Oh, no.

764
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:44,036
They're coming.

765
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:47,998
They're coming.

766
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:50,584
The <i>Hammer.</i>

767
01:17:51,126 --> 01:17:52,502
What?

768
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:55,714
You have to open that gate.

769
01:17:56,465 --> 01:17:58,175
Cut the counterweights.

770
01:18:00,344 --> 01:18:01,678
You can do it.

771
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:05,223
Hurry. There's no time.

772
01:18:06,433 --> 01:18:08,018
Captain...

773
01:18:08,185 --> 01:18:10,562
...I didn't finish the training program.

774
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,567
Neither did I.

775
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:40,050
- Lock that down!
- Kill the feeder!

776
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:43,595
We won't make it.
We gotta blow the EMP now.

777
01:18:43,762 --> 01:18:46,890
Come on, someone, please.

778
01:19:01,613 --> 01:19:03,490
Keep the weight forward.

779
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:07,244
Light as a feather.
Light as a feather.

780
01:19:11,623 --> 01:19:15,627
Holographic reports Captain Mifune's
APU is up and moving to Gate Three.

781
01:19:21,633 --> 01:19:23,718
Don't over-squeeze the trigger.

782
01:19:34,438 --> 01:19:36,440
Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three.

783
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:39,401
- How much time?
- Two minutes to impact.

784
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:43,905
- Captain Mifune, do you copy?
- I think his radio is down, sir.

785
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:45,532
Mifune...

786
01:19:45,699 --> 01:19:47,325
...this is Lock.

787
01:19:47,534 --> 01:19:50,412
I don't know if you can hear me,
but if you can...

788
01:19:50,579 --> 01:19:52,914
<i>...the</i> Hammer's<i> two minutes away.</i>

789
01:19:53,457 --> 01:19:57,669
<i>You've got two minutes, captain,
to get that gate open.</i>

790
01:19:59,296 --> 01:20:00,714
Link.

791
01:20:01,214 --> 01:20:03,467
Get to the main deck!
Charge the EMP!

792
01:20:40,086 --> 01:20:41,755
Do it, kid.

793
01:20:45,759 --> 01:20:48,678
Neo. I believe.

794
01:20:57,729 --> 01:20:59,773
- Yes!
- Can we make it?

795
01:21:01,107 --> 01:21:03,193
We ain't come this far.

796
01:21:15,372 --> 01:21:17,624
Almost home, almost home.

797
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,645
Burn it, Link!

798
01:22:02,794 --> 01:22:05,755
- You did it.
- No.

799
01:22:06,089 --> 01:22:07,757
We did it.

800
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,176
You're a hell of a pilot.

801
01:22:12,804 --> 01:22:16,099
Some things in this world never change.

802
01:22:16,391 --> 01:22:17,809
But some things do?

803
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:21,062
Luckily...

804
01:22:21,271 --> 01:22:23,189
...some things do.

805
01:22:34,784 --> 01:22:36,119
Link!

806
01:22:36,828 --> 01:22:38,455
- Zee? Zee!
- Link!

807
01:22:45,462 --> 01:22:48,298
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

808
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:50,967
I made a promise.

809
01:22:59,768 --> 01:23:01,144
You did wear it.

810
01:23:03,063 --> 01:23:06,483
Are you kidding?
I'm never gonna take it off.

811
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:18,203
Three captains, one ship.

812
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:22,374
I'll assume the other ships were lost
under equally pointless circumstances.

813
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,167
Good to see you too, Jason.

814
01:23:24,334 --> 01:23:26,670
The Council's waiting to hear
your explanation.

815
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:31,007
Forgive me for not attending,
but I have to try to salvage this debacle.

816
01:23:31,758 --> 01:23:34,344
Did I miss something?
I thought we saved the dock.

817
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:36,346
That's the problem with you people.

818
01:23:36,513 --> 01:23:39,099
You can't think but five minutes
in front of you.

819
01:23:39,391 --> 01:23:42,977
That EMP knocked out almost every
piece of hardware and every APU.

820
01:23:43,144 --> 01:23:46,106
If I were the machines,
I'd send every sentinel here now.

821
01:23:46,398 --> 01:23:50,026
Save the dock, captain?
You handed it to them on a silver platter.

822
01:23:55,782 --> 01:23:57,784
Come on, get it cut.

823
01:23:59,369 --> 01:24:00,704
The bridge is clear.

824
01:24:03,289 --> 01:24:05,208
Do you hear that?

825
01:24:07,544 --> 01:24:09,087
Get that cable run!

826
01:24:09,295 --> 01:24:13,091
- I want the system back online!
- It's the dock. They've got incoming.

827
01:24:14,384 --> 01:24:16,761
Order everyone to fall back.

828
01:24:16,928 --> 01:24:19,639
Seal the shaft. Now.

829
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:22,058
Move it!

830
01:24:25,437 --> 01:24:27,063
Oh, my God.

831
01:24:35,238 --> 01:24:37,407
- All clear.
- Do it.

832
01:24:37,574 --> 01:24:39,743
- Go! Come on! Run!
- Go!

833
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,635
Your move.

834
01:24:58,762 --> 01:25:00,472
So you gave them your ship?

835
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:05,101
- That is correct, councillor, I did.
- Knowing what he planned to do with it?

836
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:08,605
The Oracle said nothing of this?

837
01:25:09,606 --> 01:25:14,110
She told me Neo would need my help,
and I would choose to help him or not.

838
01:25:14,486 --> 01:25:18,948
But what hope can a single vessel have
against their entire defense system?

839
01:25:19,115 --> 01:25:22,327
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.

840
01:25:22,494 --> 01:25:26,790
He wouldn't even take any ammunition.
He was totally out of his goddamn mind.

841
01:25:26,956 --> 01:25:29,793
No, he wasn't.

842
01:25:31,628 --> 01:25:34,297
Neo is doing what he believes
he must do.

843
01:25:35,673 --> 01:25:38,927
I don't know if what he's doing is right.
I don't know...

844
01:25:39,093 --> 01:25:41,721
...if he'll reach the machine city.

845
01:25:41,888 --> 01:25:45,141
And if he does, I don't know
what he can do to save us.

846
01:25:46,476 --> 01:25:51,189
But I do know that as long as there is
a single breath in his body...

847
01:25:52,649 --> 01:25:54,692
...he will not give up.

848
01:25:55,985 --> 01:25:57,487
And neither can we.

849
01:26:03,952 --> 01:26:05,328
Temperature's dropping.

850
01:26:08,832 --> 01:26:10,166
Here we go.

851
01:26:49,706 --> 01:26:51,457
We're over the fields, aren't we?

852
01:26:52,876 --> 01:26:54,210
How do you know that?

853
01:26:54,961 --> 01:26:56,838
I can feel them.

854
01:27:05,597 --> 01:27:07,223
Over there.

855
01:27:08,057 --> 01:27:11,895
There's our path. Can you see it?
Three lines.

856
01:27:12,061 --> 01:27:13,396
Power lines.

857
01:27:14,397 --> 01:27:16,149
Follow them.

858
01:27:33,082 --> 01:27:34,959
What are they doing?

859
01:27:35,126 --> 01:27:36,836
I don't know.

860
01:27:37,754 --> 01:27:39,631
Lieutenant?

861
01:27:54,771 --> 01:27:56,105
Goddamn it.

862
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:57,774
What do we do now?

863
01:28:02,445 --> 01:28:04,572
It is now a matter of time.

864
01:28:05,323 --> 01:28:07,825
The machines will breach
the walls of this city.

865
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:13,623
I recommend that the Council join the
non-military personnel inside the temple.

866
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:15,667
How long do we have?

867
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:18,836
Two hours. Maybe less.

868
01:28:20,588 --> 01:28:24,801
My men have fortified the entrance with
enough artillery to make our last stand.

869
01:28:26,678 --> 01:28:29,180
Beyond that, there isn't anything more
I can do.

870
01:28:29,681 --> 01:28:33,142
Commander, do you think that
we have any chance of surviving?

871
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:37,313
If I were you, I wouldn't
ask me that question.

872
01:28:38,481 --> 01:28:39,816
I would ask him.

873
01:28:40,692 --> 01:28:44,362
- Why?
- He's the one who believes in miracles.

874
01:28:51,619 --> 01:28:54,163
There. Those mountains.

875
01:28:55,081 --> 01:28:56,916
That's it.

876
01:29:00,253 --> 01:29:02,171
- Do you see what's out there?
- Yes.

877
01:29:02,672 --> 01:29:05,341
If you tell me we'll make it,
I'll believe you.

878
01:29:05,508 --> 01:29:07,176
We'll make it.

879
01:29:10,179 --> 01:29:11,889
We have to.

880
01:30:25,171 --> 01:30:26,881
Sentinels.

881
01:30:38,267 --> 01:30:39,602
There's too many!

882
01:30:56,285 --> 01:30:57,620
Gotcha!

883
01:30:58,329 --> 01:31:00,498
- I need help here!
- I can't beat them.

884
01:31:00,706 --> 01:31:03,126
- What do we do?
- Go up, over them.

885
01:31:03,376 --> 01:31:06,379
- What?
- The sky! It's the only way.

886
01:31:08,339 --> 01:31:10,091
Then up we go.

887
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:47,170
Beautiful.

888
01:32:09,066 --> 01:32:11,694
Pump the igniter. The ship will start.

889
01:32:19,118 --> 01:32:21,579
Again. Slowly.

890
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,042
Now!

891
01:32:51,567 --> 01:32:53,069
Trin?

892
01:32:55,112 --> 01:32:56,906
Trinity?

893
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:59,659
Trinity?

894
01:33:00,826 --> 01:33:02,912
- I'm here.
- Where?

895
01:33:03,079 --> 01:33:04,413
Here.

896
01:33:14,757 --> 01:33:16,092
We made it.

897
01:33:17,843 --> 01:33:19,679
You said we would.

898
01:33:21,973 --> 01:33:24,433
It's unbelievable, Trin.

899
01:33:25,434 --> 01:33:27,103
Light everywhere.

900
01:33:27,436 --> 01:33:30,273
Like the whole thing was built of light.

901
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:33,109
I wish you could see what I see.

902
01:33:34,777 --> 01:33:36,779
You've already shown me so much.

903
01:33:39,031 --> 01:33:42,368
What is it, Trinity?
What's wrong?

904
01:33:43,744 --> 01:33:46,247
I can't go with you, Neo.

905
01:33:47,915 --> 01:33:49,709
I've gone as far as I can.

906
01:33:50,001 --> 01:33:51,377
What?

907
01:33:54,297 --> 01:33:55,798
Oh, no.

908
01:33:56,632 --> 01:33:58,384
Oh, no. No, no.

909
01:33:59,135 --> 01:34:00,803
It's all right.

910
01:34:02,179 --> 01:34:03,806
It's time.

911
01:34:05,391 --> 01:34:07,893
I've done all that I could do.

912
01:34:09,103 --> 01:34:11,480
Now you have to do the rest.

913
01:34:12,231 --> 01:34:14,317
You have to finish it.

914
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:16,819
You have to save Zion.

915
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:18,988
I can't.

916
01:34:19,447 --> 01:34:22,783
- Not without you.
- Yes, you can.

917
01:34:23,326 --> 01:34:24,994
You will.

918
01:34:26,037 --> 01:34:29,165
I believe it. I always have.

919
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:33,294
Trinity.

920
01:34:35,546 --> 01:34:39,008
Trinity, you can't die.

921
01:34:41,052 --> 01:34:43,137
You can't.

922
01:34:43,429 --> 01:34:45,014
You can't.

923
01:34:45,181 --> 01:34:47,350
Yes, I can.

924
01:34:50,519 --> 01:34:52,938
You brought me back once.

925
01:34:55,149 --> 01:34:57,234
But not this time.

926
01:35:03,115 --> 01:35:05,034
Do you remember...

927
01:35:06,827 --> 01:35:09,747
...on that roof, after you caught me...

928
01:35:11,332 --> 01:35:13,125
...the last thing I said to you?

929
01:35:15,878 --> 01:35:17,380
You said, "I'm sorry."

930
01:35:18,714 --> 01:35:20,841
I wish I hadn't.

931
01:35:23,886 --> 01:35:26,180
That was my last thought.

932
01:35:28,599 --> 01:35:31,394
I wished I had one more chance...

933
01:35:32,311 --> 01:35:34,563
...to say what really mattered.

934
01:35:37,149 --> 01:35:39,985
To say how much I loved you.

935
01:35:42,363 --> 01:35:45,741
How grateful I was for every moment
I was with you.

936
01:35:48,577 --> 01:35:53,499
But by the time I knew how to say
what I wanted to, it was too late.

937
01:35:59,547 --> 01:36:02,091
But you brought me back.

938
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:07,263
You gave me my wish.

939
01:36:10,558 --> 01:36:14,603
One more chance to say
what I really wanted to say.

940
01:36:19,275 --> 01:36:21,152
Kiss me.

941
01:36:24,113 --> 01:36:25,906
Once more...

942
01:36:27,616 --> 01:36:29,034
...kiss me.

943
01:36:56,395 --> 01:36:58,481
Get that ammunition where it belongs!

944
01:36:58,647 --> 01:37:00,483
You got one chance to get this right.

945
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:02,985
Get that damn thing mounted!

946
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:10,576
- Hurry.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

947
01:37:25,424 --> 01:37:26,800
Neo...

948
01:37:27,092 --> 01:37:29,512
...if you're gonna do something,
do it quick.

949
01:39:38,307 --> 01:39:40,392
I only ask to say
what I've come to say.

950
01:39:40,559 --> 01:39:44,396
After that, do what you want,
and I won't try and stop you.

951
01:39:48,525 --> 01:39:49,860
Speak.

952
01:39:50,611 --> 01:39:53,572
The program Smith has grown
beyond your control.

953
01:39:53,739 --> 01:39:57,159
Soon he will spread through this city
as he spread through the Matrix.

954
01:39:57,326 --> 01:39:58,661
You cannot stop him.

955
01:40:00,746 --> 01:40:03,082
- But I can.
- We don't need you!

956
01:40:04,083 --> 01:40:06,418
We need nothing!

957
01:40:07,503 --> 01:40:11,423
If that's true, then I've made a mistake,
and you should kill me now.

958
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:18,389
What do you want?

959
01:40:19,765 --> 01:40:21,058
Peace.

960
01:40:46,875 --> 01:40:48,794
What are they doing?

961
01:40:54,383 --> 01:40:56,385
What are you doing?

962
01:40:59,555 --> 01:41:01,473
Morpheus!

963
01:41:25,831 --> 01:41:27,833
And if you fail?

964
01:41:30,085 --> 01:41:32,087
I won't.

965
01:41:53,525 --> 01:41:55,110
Neo.

966
01:41:55,277 --> 01:41:56,904
He fights for us.

967
01:42:38,654 --> 01:42:41,573
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

968
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:43,909
We missed you.

969
01:42:47,996 --> 01:42:50,916
You like what I've done with the place?

970
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,210
It ends tonight.

971
01:42:54,169 --> 01:42:57,172
I know it does. I've seen it.

972
01:42:57,339 --> 01:43:01,093
That's why the rest of me
is just going to enjoy the show...

973
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:04,930
...because we already know
that I'm the one that beats you.

974
01:44:57,209 --> 01:45:00,128
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson...

975
01:45:00,295 --> 01:45:02,714
...closing in on you?

976
01:45:02,881 --> 01:45:05,050
Oh, I can.

977
01:45:06,385 --> 01:45:10,514
I really should thank you for it.
After all, it was your life...

978
01:45:10,681 --> 01:45:14,309
...that taught me the purpose of all life.

979
01:45:14,726 --> 01:45:18,230
The purpose of life is to end.

980
01:48:54,112 --> 01:48:56,031
Why, Mr. Anderson?

981
01:48:56,198 --> 01:49:00,035
Why, why, why?

982
01:49:00,202 --> 01:49:01,536
Why do you do it?

983
01:49:02,287 --> 01:49:04,289
Why? Why get up?

984
01:49:04,456 --> 01:49:06,291
Why keep fighting?

985
01:49:07,792 --> 01:49:10,295
Do you believe you're fighting
for something?

986
01:49:10,462 --> 01:49:13,131
For more than your survival?

987
01:49:13,298 --> 01:49:16,593
Can you tell me what it is?
Do you even know?

988
01:49:20,055 --> 01:49:21,806
Is it freedom or truth?

989
01:49:21,973 --> 01:49:24,351
Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?

990
01:49:24,517 --> 01:49:27,896
Illusions, Mr. Anderson.
Vagaries of perception.

991
01:49:28,313 --> 01:49:31,399
Temporary constructs
of a feeble human intellect...

992
01:49:31,566 --> 01:49:34,194
...trying desperately
to justify an existence...

993
01:49:34,361 --> 01:49:36,446
...that is without meaning or purpose!

994
01:49:36,613 --> 01:49:40,033
And all of them as artificial
as the Matrix itself...

995
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:46,331
...although only a human mind could
invent something as insipid as love.

996
01:49:48,833 --> 01:49:50,961
You must be able to see it,
Mr. Anderson.

997
01:49:51,127 --> 01:49:55,674
You must know it by now. You can't
win. It's pointless to keep fighting.

998
01:49:58,426 --> 01:50:01,680
Why, Mr. Anderson, why?
Why do you persist?

999
01:50:04,933 --> 01:50:07,185
Because I choose to.

1000
01:51:12,125 --> 01:51:15,211
This is my world! My world!

1001
01:51:39,861 --> 01:51:41,613
Wait.

1002
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:43,948
I've seen this.

1003
01:51:45,116 --> 01:51:47,452
This is it. This is the end.

1004
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:53,041
Yes. You were laying right there,
just like that.

1005
01:51:53,208 --> 01:51:55,543
And I.... I....

1006
01:51:55,710 --> 01:52:01,549
I stand here, right here,
and I'm supposed to say something.

1007
01:52:01,716 --> 01:52:03,385
I say:

1008
01:52:03,551 --> 01:52:07,055
"Everything that has a beginning
has an end, Neo."

1009
01:52:15,814 --> 01:52:19,567
What? What did I just say?

1010
01:52:24,906 --> 01:52:28,743
No, no. This isn't right.
This can't be right.

1011
01:52:36,251 --> 01:52:37,919
Get away from me!

1012
01:52:38,086 --> 01:52:39,504
What are you afraid of?

1013
01:52:40,255 --> 01:52:41,589
It's a trick.

1014
01:52:42,257 --> 01:52:44,509
You were right, Smith.

1015
01:52:45,427 --> 01:52:47,262
You were always right.

1016
01:52:50,598 --> 01:52:52,267
It was inevitable.

1017
01:53:24,048 --> 01:53:25,633
Is it over?

1018
01:53:56,664 --> 01:53:59,042
Oh, no, no, no.

1019
01:53:59,209 --> 01:54:00,752
No, it's not fair.

1020
01:54:55,056 --> 01:54:57,392
It is done.

1021
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:31,676
It doesn't make sense.

1022
01:55:35,597 --> 01:55:37,265
He did it.

1023
01:55:38,016 --> 01:55:40,268
He saved us.

1024
01:55:40,518 --> 01:55:42,687
He saved us.

1025
01:55:43,271 --> 01:55:46,524
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1026
01:55:46,774 --> 01:55:48,109
He did it! It's over!

1027
01:55:48,276 --> 01:55:50,778
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1028
01:55:50,945 --> 01:55:54,449
- What is it? What happened?
- Sir, he did it, sir. Neo, he did it.

1029
01:55:54,616 --> 01:55:56,117
- Did what?
- He ended the war.

1030
01:55:56,284 --> 01:55:58,202
The machines, they're gone.

1031
01:55:58,369 --> 01:56:01,706
The war is over, sir. The war is over.

1032
01:56:03,291 --> 01:56:06,711
Zion! Zion!

1033
01:56:06,878 --> 01:56:08,630
Zion, it's over!

1034
01:56:08,963 --> 01:56:10,465
It's over!

1035
01:56:10,632 --> 01:56:13,301
The war is over!

1036
01:56:13,468 --> 01:56:16,304
The war is over!

1037
01:56:16,471 --> 01:56:18,973
Whoo!

1038
01:56:37,659 --> 01:56:40,578
I have imagined this moment...

1039
01:56:41,079 --> 01:56:43,373
...for so long.

1040
01:56:47,251 --> 01:56:49,045
Is this real?

1041
01:56:57,845 --> 01:57:00,682
Neo, wherever you are...

1042
01:57:01,683 --> 01:57:03,768
...thank you.

1043
01:57:47,562 --> 01:57:48,896
Good morning.

1044
01:58:10,168 --> 01:58:14,088
Well, now. Ain't this a surprise.

1045
01:58:14,505 --> 01:58:16,674
You played a very dangerous game.

1046
01:58:16,841 --> 01:58:19,093
Change always is.

1047
01:58:19,677 --> 01:58:23,014
Just how long do you think
this peace is going to last?

1048
01:58:24,348 --> 01:58:26,601
As long as it can.

1049
01:58:29,854 --> 01:58:31,856
What about the others?

1050
01:58:33,524 --> 01:58:34,942
What others?

1051
01:58:35,109 --> 01:58:36,778
The ones that want out.

1052
01:58:37,528 --> 01:58:39,614
Obviously, they will be freed.

1053
01:58:40,198 --> 01:58:41,866
I have your word?

1054
01:58:42,033 --> 01:58:45,787
What do you think I am? Human?

1055
01:58:59,801 --> 01:59:01,385
Oracle!

1056
01:59:08,226 --> 01:59:10,394
We were afraid we might not find you.

1057
01:59:10,561 --> 01:59:13,231
Everything's okay now.

1058
01:59:13,731 --> 01:59:15,483
Look, look.

1059
01:59:16,067 --> 01:59:18,486
Just look at that.

1060
01:59:19,153 --> 01:59:21,823
Beautiful.

1061
01:59:22,740 --> 01:59:25,159
Did you do that?

1062
01:59:25,493 --> 01:59:27,662
For Neo.

1063
01:59:27,995 --> 01:59:29,997
That's nice.

1064
01:59:30,164 --> 01:59:31,833
I know he'd love it.

1065
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:34,502
Will we ever see him again?

1066
01:59:35,086 --> 01:59:37,839
I suspect so.

1067
01:59:38,005 --> 01:59:39,715
Someday.

1068
01:59:44,512 --> 01:59:46,305
Did you always know?

1069
01:59:46,472 --> 01:59:49,767
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

1070
01:59:50,268 --> 01:59:52,854
But I believed.

1071
01:59:53,771 --> 01:59:56,190
I believed.
