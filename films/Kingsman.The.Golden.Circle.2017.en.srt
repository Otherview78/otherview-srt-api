1
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,030
Eggy.

2
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,630
You mind if I share your cab?

3
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,740
Charlie?

4
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,950
It's ironic, isn't it?

5
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,150
You look like a gentleman,
I look like a pleb.

6
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,320
If I was you, I'd unlock your cab.

7
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,280
Pete, get us out of here!

8
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,630
You think that shit's
gonna work this time?

9
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,200
You're way out of your depth.

10
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
Fuck!

11
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,120
Take him out!

12
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,590
Merlin! We've got a Code Purple.
My driver's down.

13
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,630
Permission to blow these fuckers away.

14
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,960
<i>Denied.</i>

15
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,270
Cannot be contained.

16
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,740
Head south, I'm clearing the route.

17
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,250
Shit!

18
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,150
Merlin, I'm entering Hyde Park.

19
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,660
Can I get on with it?

20
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,530
Merlin!

21
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,560
<i>Dark zone confirmed.
Permission to fire.</i>

22
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,960
Oh, thank fuck for that!

23
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,280
<i>No time to relax.
Police are right behind you.</i>

24
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,620
You have 30 seconds before
they reach your position.

25
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,650
Go directly to Rendez-vous Swan.

26
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,170
Merlin, you do realize
I haven't even got a windscreen right now?

27
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,640
<i>I seem to remember
from your training</i>

28
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,390
<i>you were rather good
at holding your breath.</i>

29
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,639
<i>It wasn't a revenge mission.</i>

30
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,440
<i>Charlie could've just
killed you immediately.</i>

31
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,470
Not boasting,
but I trained him well enough

32
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,910
that even he wouldn't mess that up.

33
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,280
<i>Merlin, I'm sorry,</i>

34
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:29,520
<i>we're gonna have to do
the debrief tomorrow.</i>

35
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,860
I've got to get to a dinner tonight

36
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,360
and if I miss it, let's just say
Charlie might as well have killed me.

37
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,549
<i>Well, if you can't wait for
the police to clear the park,</i>

38
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,050
<i>there's another way out in the corner.</i>

39
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,630
Fuck!

40
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,270
How important is that dinner?

41
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,310
Let me show you.

42
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,150
For fuck's sake!

43
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,490
Babe.

44
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,030
I'm home!

45
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,100
I'm here.

46
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,340
What the hell happened?

47
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,740
It's a long story that deserves a kiss.

48
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Not even JB would kiss you right now.

49
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,750
If you really love me, just one little kiss.

50
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,420
You were really gonna do it?

51
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,550
Yeah.

52
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,120
Now, that is true love right there.

53
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Amazing. I'm gonna go get changed.

54
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,530
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪</i>

55
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,340
And Tilde made that for you herself, bruv.

56
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,440
The royal baker's not available.

57
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,680
Shut up Brandon.

58
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,180
Especially if you want some of this...

59
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,580
Wait. Is that that Swedish stuff right there?

60
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,028
Yes.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

61
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:49,679
I aingt drinking none of that.
Last time here, I was wrecked, man.

62
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,400
Yeah, but that's 'cause you
were a lightweight, Jamal.

63
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,520
No, no, babe, I'm good.
Not for me, thank you.

64
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,860
Oh, what?
What's going on, man?

65
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,330
I'm meeting her parents
for the first time tomorrow night.

66
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,400
I wanna make a good
impression, so what?

67
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,070
Oh, yeah, Jamal,
are you free to dogsit JB

68
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,440
tomorrow night while we're there?

69
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,640
Sorry bruv, I've got
to look after my nan tomorrow.

70
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,870
But Liam's free, though.

71
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,910
Yeah?

72
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,080
I can't, mate.
I'm allergic to dogs.

73
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,110
Bullshit.

74
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,440
Dogshit, actually.

75
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,620
That leaves you, Brandon.
What you doing tomorrow night?

76
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,320
Yeah, I'll look after your dog, mate,
but I got one condition.

77
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,650
What's that?

78
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,090
You have a drink with us.
Yeah.

79
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,520
Got to do it, babe.

80
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,350
Got to do it.

81
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,160
Brandon, happy birthday!

82
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,990
Happy birthday.

83
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,530
Yeah.
Cheers.

84
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,260
Shit.

85
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,970
<i>My drugs are everywhere.</i>

86
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,940
<i>They were never my thing
but here I am,</i>

87
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,180
<i>running the biggest
drug cartel in the world.</i>

88
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,580
<i>The only downside is having to
live in the middle of nowhere.</i>

89
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,590
<i>You know, these ruins
are technically undiscovered.</i>

90
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,890
<i>I just added a few touches
to remind me of home.</i>

91
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:08,130
<i>I grew up on all that
awesome 50s nostalgia.</i>

92
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,600
<i>Grease. American Graffiti.
Happy Days.</i>

93
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,140
<i>But I digress.</i>

94
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,240
<i>The thing you need to understand,</i>

95
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,340
<i>is the hard work and ingenuity,</i>

96
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,710
<i>it took to achieve a global monopoly,</i>

97
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,610
on the drug trade.

98
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,015
And that's all on me.

99
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:27,380
Not to toot my own horn,

100
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,720
I just think it's really important
for new recruits to understand,

101
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,860
the history of The Golden Circle.

102
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,700
So. Lifelong friends.

103
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,370
Charles, do you think your buddy here
is worthy of joining us?

104
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,299
Ms. Poppy, I would not have brought him

105
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,839
all the way to see you
if I didn't think so.

106
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,770
Excellent.
Well, you hungry?

107
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,810
Starving.

108
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,722
Wonderful!

109
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:54,180
Right this way.

110
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,910
Make yourselves at home.

111
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,055
So..

112
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,530
Fellas...

113
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,370
I have a couple of things
that I wanna clarify.

114
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,790
You understand,

115
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:10,060
that in The Golden Circle my authority
is never to be questioned, right?

116
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,060
And the importance of following orders?

117
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,430
Do you understand that?

118
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,130
And the value of loyalty?

119
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,930
It's easy to nod, isn't it?

120
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,213
I don't like easy.

121
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:24,564
I like proof.

122
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,686
What's your name?

123
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:32,150
Angel, ma'am.

124
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,880
Angel, baby.

125
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,020
Hey.

126
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,220
Your old pal, Charles, has messed up.

127
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,750
That's all I'm gonna tell you,

128
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,930
because that's all you need to know.

129
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,460
So put him in the mincer, Ok?

130
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,050
No, Miss Poppy!

131
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,470
Good job!

132
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,840
See my salon across the way?

133
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
Head there for your makeover.

134
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,230
Eggsy, I hope you're hungry.

135
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,589
Oh, babe,

136
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,494
I was gonna grab breakfast at work.

137
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,780
This looks lovely, but I'm running late.

138
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,640
I just thought maybe we could practice?

139
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,070
For tonight.

140
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,410
Practice?

141
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Eating?

142
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,450
You said you've never
eaten at a palace before.

143
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,423
And...

144
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,451
Pappa is sort of picky
about table manners.

145
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,293
Well, as it happens babe,

146
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:52,920
I've got this shit on lock.

147
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,960
I know what every single one
of them knives and forks is for.

148
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,730
This is a butter knife.

149
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,340
It's the only one you need to remember,
the rest of the cutlery is easy.

150
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,470
You start from the outside,

151
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,700
and you work your way in with each course.

152
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,640
And never let anyone
describe you as H.K.L.P.

153
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,770
What's that?

154
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,370
Holds knife like pen.

155
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,710
A habit erroneously believed
to be upper class dining etiquette.

156
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,810
It is quite the opposite.

157
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,090
White wine, pudding wine,
red wine, water and pop.

158
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,290
Or whatever tipple takes your fancy.

159
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,830
Am I supposed to wait for everyone else
to be served before I start eating?

160
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,670
Only if the dish being served is cold.

161
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,177
Or if the Queen is present.

162
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:35,524
Otherwise tuck in.

163
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,400
Got to be honest,

164
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,800
never really thought
the royalty bit would be relevant.

165
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,210
Harry would've been chuffed.

166
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,280
I wish I could've met him.

167
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,550
You miss him too, don't you Mr. Pickle?

168
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,430
Mr. Pickle says, Yeah.

169
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,800
Hey, no, no, sit down, I'm fine.

170
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,540
I'm fine. Have a good day.

171
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,570
Ok.

172
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,349
Galahad!

173
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:46,169
You're late.

174
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,175
We were wondering,

175
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,800
if you'd had a second
encounter with Charlie.

176
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,948
I wish.

177
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:52,895
I'm looking forward to finishing him off.

178
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,550
All right, gents.

179
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,080
Merlin, come in.

180
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,050
Galahad and Lancelot,

181
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,220
please remain for Merlings debrief.

182
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,532
Everyone else,

183
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:08,544
reconvene at 1900 hours.

184
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,090
So...

185
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,370
the man who attacked Galahad in the taxi
was Charlie Hesketh.

186
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,570
Rejected Kingsman applicant turned bad.

187
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,100
We last saw him back
at Richmond Valentine's HQ.

188
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,240
<i>I've caught a fucking spy!</i>

189
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,210
Like everyone else there,

190
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,350
Charlie had a security implant
in his neck.

191
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,920
A weakness we had no choice
but to exploit.

192
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,460
Hey, Merlin.

193
00:19:37,485 --> 00:19:40,444
Still fucking spectacular, eh?

194
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,455
Come on guys, loosen up.

195
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,784
We saved the world.

196
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,090
Yeah.

197
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,858
Unfortunately Galahad,

198
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,670
you also saved Charlie.

199
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,885
When you electrocuted him,

200
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,370
you damaged his implant.

201
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,240
Instead of his head exploding,

202
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,540
he only lost an arm and his vocal chords.

203
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,879
Fucker should be thanking me.

204
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,410
And now he's back for revenge?

205
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,950
We don't think so, sir.

206
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,710
We believe he's being recruited
by an unknown organization.

207
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,850
Lancelot?

208
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,380
Got the police autopsy reports

209
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,850
from Charlie's colleagues in the SUVs.

210
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,860
They're not just goons for hire.

211
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,990
Fingerprints removed.

212
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,130
Teeth filed smooth.

213
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,874
I did a face recognition.

214
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:19,700
Nothing.

215
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,700
And that thing?

216
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,370
A cosmetic tattoo made of 24-carat gold.

217
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,230
They all had them.

218
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:30,070
Seems like we're looking
at some kind of underworld organization.

219
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,640
Senora Poppy has sent me
for my makeover.

220
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,780
<i>Follow me.</i>

221
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,720
<i>Please take your shirt off.</i>

222
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,930
It's beautiful, isn't it?

223
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,300
Not that.

224
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,630
This.

225
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,470
Bon appetit.

226
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,110
How is it?

227
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,150
It's delicious.

228
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,490
Welcome to Golden Circle.

229
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,760
<i>♪ Raining in my heart ♪</i>

230
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,870
I think we should do you the favor

231
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,180
of conversing in English, yes.

232
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,280
So, tell me,

233
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,510
what do you do?

234
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,120
I work for Kingsman,
the tailors, Your Highness.

235
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,350
You may address my daughter
as Your Highness.

236
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,890
Please address the Queen and
myself with Your Majesty.

237
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,290
Pappa, this is a family dinner,

238
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,530
not some state function.

239
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,200
Well then, Eggsy.

240
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,970
What do you make of the current situation

241
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,070
in the Indian financial markets?

242
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,700
Pappa!

243
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,340
Well...

244
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,980
I don't think we can
underestimate the impact

245
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,750
of ECB's quantitative easing measures and

246
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,019
of course, the liquidity wave

247
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,719
from the US Federal Reserve rate hike

248
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,890
getting pushed back.

249
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,130
Frida Kahlo.

250
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,370
Well,

251
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,970
other than the 1939
acquisition by the Louvre,

252
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,939
she wasn't really acknowledged

253
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,040
until the new Mexicanisimo art
movementof the late 1970s.

254
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,310
Moorish revival.

255
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,520
The Palazzo Sammezzano.

256
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,650
In Tuscany.

257
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,620
Beautiful.

258
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,760
Bluetooth technology.

259
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,420
Which of course, got its name,

260
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,230
from the legendary Danish king,

261
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,200
Harald Blatand,

262
00:24:12,225 --> 00:24:15,660
whose name translates
to Bluetooth in English.

263
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,300
And the Bluetooth logo is his initials
in Norse runic symbols.

264
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,300
And, as I'm sure you know,

265
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,700
the Bluetooth logo is his initials,

266
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,410
in Norse runic symbols.

267
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,240
<i>Oh, my God, Eggsy.</i>

268
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,110
<i>Why isn't he eating his fucking pudding?</i>

269
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,080
I need to research this gold tattoo.

270
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,920
I found records of other people
with the same body modifications.

271
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,960
All of them have high level involvement

272
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,090
with crime and international drug trafficking.

273
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,190
And there's rumors of something
called The Golden Circle.

274
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,200
Best agent or best friend?

275
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,280
Come on, JB.
Give it a rest, mate.

276
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,365
Stop scratching the door.

277
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,810
I'm gonna get the blame now.

278
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,650
There you are. Happy?

279
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,060
With the decks and all that.

280
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,640
Shit, boy!

281
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,940
What the...

282
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,910
Do you reckon, JB...

283
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,020
model material?

284
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,090
<i>I must say, you're really
not as I expected.</i>

285
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,160
Well, thank you very much...

286
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,530
Your Majesty.

287
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,890
<i>Eggsy?
Is that you, mate?</i>

288
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,860
<i>What the fuck is going on here?</i>

289
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,260
<i>You a gangster now or something?</i>

290
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,870
Fucking hell is that?
Tilde's mom and dad's house?

291
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,780
Tell you what.
Whatever you're doing, I want in.

292
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,670
Put it down!

293
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,910
Why?

294
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,540
I said, put it down now!

295
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,780
What's wrong with it?

296
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,280
Shut it! Fucking shut it!

297
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,950
Eggsy.
I beg your pardon?

298
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,750
<i>Shut it! Shut it now!</i>

299
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,020
All right, mate.
Chill your boots.

300
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,820
Eggsy, what...

301
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,960
Oh, no. Oh, my God, no.
I'm so sorry.

302
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,020
You shut up and all.
You got me in enough trouble.

303
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,460
The next order of business...

304
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,360
Agent Percival.

305
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,170
<i>Arthur.</i>

306
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,970
Oh, fuck.

307
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,410
Yep.

308
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,450
Kingsman is crumpets.

309
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,908
Like toast,

310
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,021
but British.

311
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,120
And to say thank you...

312
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,630
I got you a present, Charlie.

313
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,400
My guys made you this.

314
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,500
Bigger, badder, better.
I call it...

315
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,170
ARMageddon.

316
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,230
Let's see if your game improves.

317
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,080
Someone decides to wipe out

318
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,920
every Kingsman property,

319
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,303
every agent,

320
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:05,620
and somehow,

321
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,720
conveniently, you weren't at home.

322
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,920
I could say the same thing about you.

323
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,930
What, you think I'd kill Roxy?

324
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,100
And my mate, Brandon,
and my fucking dog?

325
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,230
No.

326
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,800
You think I would?

327
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,110
This thing...

328
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,310
hacked us.

329
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,710
Clearly, this arm can be remotely controlled.

330
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,220
I'm only alive because my address

331
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,450
wasn't on the database with the agents.

332
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,920
Whoever Charlie's working with,

333
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,038
doesn't think that mere staff,

334
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:44,214
are missile-worthy.

335
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,730
This aingt funny.

336
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,760
Roxy is dead!

337
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,269
Everyone's dead! Gone!
Do you even care?

338
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,600
Pull yourself together.

339
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,270
Remember your training.

340
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,400
There's no time for emotion in this scenario.

341
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,540
Now,

342
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,840
as all surviving agents are present,

343
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,050
we follow the doomsday protocol.

344
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,680
When that's done,

345
00:30:07,905 --> 00:30:09,404
and only then...

346
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,590
you may shed a tear in private.

347
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,690
Ok.

348
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,230
What's the doomsday protocol?

349
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,100
We go shopping.

350
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,039
We're from Kingsman.

351
00:30:39,264 --> 00:30:40,610
We'd like to buy some wine.

352
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,350
And use tasting room
number three, please.

353
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,160
Not one of my predecessors

354
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,390
has ever been in this situation before.

355
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,700
Thank God.

356
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,870
Remember this?

357
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,270
Yeah, how could I forget?

358
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,420
Whatever's in that safe
is the answer to all our problems.

359
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,070
Is that it?

360
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,200
I suppose that must be
upper-class humor.

361
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,270
I don't get it.

362
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,250
Me neither. What the fuck
are we supposed to do now?

363
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,380
I think we should drink a toast
to our fallen comrades.

364
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,820
To Roxy.

365
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:53,850
Roxy.

366
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,349
To Arthur.

367
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:04,554
Arthur.

368
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,600
Should we do one for JB?

369
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,910
I think we should.

370
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,490
I should have seen it coming.

371
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,890
Charlie, the taxi.

372
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,260
It's all my fault.

373
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,501
No, that's bullshit.

374
00:32:32,726 --> 00:32:35,124
Bullshit Merlin. It aingt,
aingt all your fault.

375
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,400
You're the best, bruv.

376
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,530
Honestly, without you I...

377
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,570
I'd have lost it a long time ago.

378
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,210
I think we should drink to Scotland.

379
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,940
I think we've probably
had enough, to be honest.

380
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,450
You're probably right.

381
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,045
Merlin.

382
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,270
Aye?

383
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,520
I think we're going to Kentucky.

384
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,930
Fried Chicken?

385
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,830
I love fried chicken.

386
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,700
No, proper Kentucky. Look.

387
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,830
You know what else I love?

388
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,930
Country and western music.

389
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,800
<i>♪ Country roads ♪</i>

390
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
<i>♪ Take me home ♪</i>

391
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:24,680
<i>♪ To the place I belong ♪</i>

392
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,200
Oh! Here's where we leave
the casks to age.

393
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,430
Unfortunately, we can't go in,

394
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,800
as it's a temperature-controlled
environment.

395
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,770
So let's move on
to our world class stud farm,

396
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,710
and meet three of
our Kentucky Derby winners.

397
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,220
Biometric security scanner just to protect
a few old barrels of whiskey?

398
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,450
Pull the other one, love.

399
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,650
Got it.

400
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,400
Are you getting anything?

401
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,500
Not yet.

402
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,500
Fucking hell.

403
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,140
It's a shame it's not scotch.

404
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,670
Hang on.

405
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,809
According to this, there's a huge

406
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:29,740
underground structure right beneath us.

407
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,810
And if my calculations are correct...

408
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
This...

409
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,350
is the way in.

410
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,990
Fucking hell, Merlin.
Shit.

411
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,360
You know, my mama...

412
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,860
she always told me...

413
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,630
us southerners get our good
manners from the British.

414
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,338
I was thinking,

415
00:34:52,563 --> 00:34:54,070
aingt that a pity.

416
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,170
Y'all didn't keep nothing for yourselves.

417
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,680
Y'all aingt never heard of
knocking before you enter?

418
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,150
Well, actually we had an invitation.
Didn't we?

419
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,320
Yeah.
Oh, did you now?

420
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,390
Yeah. Yeah.
It came in the shape of a bottle.

421
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,719
We're from the Kingsman
tailor shop in London.

422
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,860
Maybe you've heard of us?

423
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,190
The Kingsman.
Yeah.

424
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,929
That's where y'all got them fine suits

425
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,530
and them fancy spectacles y'all got on?

426
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,900
Exactly.
That's right.

427
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,270
Y'all look damn sharp.

428
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,550
Let me see if I got it right, here.

429
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,876
You want me to believe that,

430
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:31,340
it's normal for a tailor,

431
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,080
to hack through an advanced
biometric security system,

432
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,550
with nothing but a little bitty old watch on?

433
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,420
I can promise you...

434
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,050
that dog don't hunt.

435
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,730
So why don't you go on and get down
on your knees,

436
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,520
and tell me who you really work for.

437
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,900
That's 1963 Statesman Reserve.

438
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,610
You just made it personal.

439
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,090
Who the fuck are you?

440
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,040
A bottle in a secret wall.

441
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,080
You really expect me to take that seriously?

442
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,450
See, I think your story's horse shit.

443
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,420
Y'all just trying to cover
for a failed rescue mission.

444
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:53,190
You here for the lepidopterist,
aingt you?

445
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,830
Ok, so your mystery bottle?

446
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,140
Look anything like that, right there?

447
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,430
Yes. Same brand, much older.

448
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:07,970
All right.

449
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,570
Let's see here.

450
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,340
You know why the measurement

451
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,010
of alcohol content's called proof?

452
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,810
Fuck off!

453
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,080
For Pete's sake.

454
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,550
See, comes from back in the old days,

455
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,120
when pirates wanted to test
the strength of their rum.

456
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,450
They used to pour a little bit out
on gunpowder.

457
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,330
That'll make you wanna slap
your mama right there, boy.

458
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:35,830
And if the gunpowder,

459
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,500
if it burnt when they set it alight,

460
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,130
they considered it proof...

461
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,470
that their rum was good and strong.

462
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,840
But see, I aingt got no gunpowder on me, do I?

463
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,190
But I'm pretty sure you boys'll make

464
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,040
just as impressive of a sound,

465
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,580
when I set your balls on fire.

466
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,220
Or you could just tell me who the fuck
y'all really are,

467
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,760
and how the hell y'all found us.
Look, for the last time,

468
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,360
we have nothing to protect but our honor.

469
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,430
So you can take your cheap horse piss
that you call whiskey,

470
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,010
which, by the way, is spelled without an e,

471
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,570
and is nothing compared
to a single malt scotch,

472
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,970
and you can go fuck yourself.

473
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,640
What about you?

474
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,010
Me?
Yeah.

475
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,940
No, I love a Jack and Coke, bruv.

476
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,150
But I do agree with the part
where you go fuck yourself.

477
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,550
All right.

478
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,920
Y'all aingt got nothing to protect
other than your honor.

479
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,860
Let's see what happens
when we change things up.

480
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,900
Fuck me.
Harry?

481
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,970
Y'all got three seconds
to tell me the truth.

482
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,100
Wait. No.

483
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,300
No!
Harry!

484
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,240
He can't hear you.
But I can, so talk.

485
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,370
No!
Get down, Harry!

486
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,240
Harry! Harry!
That's two.

487
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,540
Harry!
Harry!

488
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,150
Harry!
Three.

489
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,180
Stop!

490
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,050
Their story checked out.

491
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,520
I opened our doomsday scenario locker

492
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,050
and that umbrella was in it.

493
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,413
Kingsman.

494
00:39:07,938 --> 00:39:09,414
It's got our logo on it.

495
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,190
I'm really sorry.

496
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,260
My apologies, boys.

497
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,060
I hope there aingt no hard feelings.
I was just doing my job.

498
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,400
Welcome to the Statesman,

499
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,200
independent intelligence agency.

500
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,940
Just like y'all, I reckon.

501
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,140
But our founders went
into the booze business.

502
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,250
Thank the sweet Lord above.

503
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,140
This is Ginger Ale.

504
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,910
She's our strategy executive.

505
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,850
Hello.

506
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,910
I'm Agent Tequila.

507
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,780
This is the part where you untie us.

508
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,360
Thank you.

509
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:48,930
Harry.

510
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,530
Hello.
Hello, mate.

511
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,370
<i>Harry.</i>

512
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,070
<i>How do you do?</i>

513
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,410
Have we met before?

514
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,140
Harry,

515
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:04,440
it's Ok. It's fine.
They know that we know you.

516
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,280
I think there must be some mistake.

517
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,920
It's been such a long time, Harry.

518
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,690
I need to get my brogues resoled.

519
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,260
Yeah, and my oxfords are done in as well.

520
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,490
Why are you telling me
about your shoes?

521
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,230
I'm a lepidopterist.

522
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,270
You're a what?

523
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,740
I study butterflies.

524
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,880
Well, you wanted to be before
you joined the army, but...

525
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,680
Harry, look at me.

526
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,820
<i>It's good to see you.</i>

527
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,120
<i>We'll be back soon.</i>

528
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,547
These fellas right here,

529
00:40:51,672 --> 00:40:53,190
are our doomsday protocol?

530
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,200
Turns out, our founder's
tailor was Kingsman.

531
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,410
What the fuck have you done to him?

532
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,400
Nothing. Only tried to help him.

533
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,040
He's got retrograde amnesia.

534
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,310
Now, we knew from his eyeglasses

535
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,370
that he was intelligence.

536
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,640
We just didn't know whose.

537
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,040
How did he get here?

538
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,550
What the hell?

539
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,855
Tequila,

540
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,180
I'm getting a crazy spike,

541
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,850
of extreme low frequency waves
11 miles from here.

542
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,750
I'm gonna need you to escort me
there immediately.

543
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,250
I need your alpha gel.

544
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,390
I'll go check the church.

545
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,610
<i>We developed our alpha gel
technology for our own agents,</i>

546
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,510
<i>in the event of a head shot.</i>

547
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,080
<i>The gel protects the brain.</i>

548
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,534
<i>Then in the lab,</i>

549
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:18,810
<i>we use nanites,</i>

550
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,350
<i>micro-bots, to repair tissue damage.</i>

551
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,390
<i>There are side effects.</i>

552
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,720
<i>Partial amnesia,</i>

553
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,760
<i>regression to the younger self.</i>

554
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,015
<i>With no idea who he was,</i>

555
00:42:35,016 --> 00:42:36,684
<i>there was nothing we could do.</i>

556
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,470
But now you guys are here,

557
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,800
there's a good chance
we can bring him back.

558
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,600
You're late.

559
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,270
Why are you still wearing that?

560
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,796
Until you get rid,

561
00:43:15,121 --> 00:43:16,500
of the perimeter landmines.

562
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,840
I'll keep wearing the suit,
thank you very much.

563
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,470
Scaredy-cat.

564
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,810
Shut up and sit down.

565
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,080
Let's go!

566
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,420
Crocodile Rock, please.

567
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,850
<i>Fuck you!</i>

568
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:37,490
<i>Hey, hey, Elton, language.</i>

569
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,860
<i>Ok, as fabulous as your catalogue is...</i>

570
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,630
<i>I think I want to hear some Gershwin.</i>

571
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,070
I still can't believe...

572
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,939
you got away with kidnapping Elton John.

573
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:50,748
I know!

574
00:43:50,773 --> 00:43:53,171
But with Valentine abducting
those celebrities,

575
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,510
it seemed silly not to take
advantage of the confusion.

576
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,510
Shit. Has Elton got the blue rash?

577
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:03,680
<i>Lights.</i>

578
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,190
<i>Hey, Elton.</i>

579
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,620
<i>Have you been a bad boy again?</i>

580
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,864
<i>You're lying.</i>

581
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:13,714
<i>Look at your hands.</i>

582
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,060
What is it?

583
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,730
<i>It's proof that my plan is gonna work.</i>

584
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:25,200
<i>It's also the first sign
of a slow and horrible death.</i>

585
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:29,240
<i>Don't worry, I can fix it.</i>

586
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,210
<i>Tell me who you partied with.</i>

587
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,050
It was Angel.

588
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,250
<i>Not very angelic.</i>

589
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,720
<i>Gonna have to clip his wings.</i>

590
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:20,960
Close the door behind you.

591
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,069
At what point are you
going to start behaving

592
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,740
like a Statesman, Tequila?

593
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,310
You wanna go back
to being a rodeo clown?

594
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,280
No sir. I apologize sir.

595
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:41,950
I'm Champagne.

596
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,950
But anyone who knows
what's good for him...

597
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:47,890
calls me Champ.

598
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,390
Sorry for your troubles.

599
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,890
As your American cousins,

600
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:58,230
I'm placing all of Statesman's considerably
larger resources at your disposal.

601
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:03,300
Can you imagine us
in the clothing business?

602
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:07,948
Now,

603
00:46:07,948 --> 00:46:09,381
how can I help you?

604
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,710
First of all, I've got to thank you
for saving Agent Galahad.

605
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:13,950
Wait.

606
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:15,810
You said that you were Galahad.

607
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,350
Oh no, he's talking about...

608
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:18,589
the butterfly guy.

609
00:46:18,613 --> 00:46:19,750
That used to be his handle.

610
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:24,120
Galahad always said you've got to look at the
bigger picture ask why as well as who.

611
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,489
So if someone wanted to take out Kingsman,

612
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,760
then they've got to be
planning something major.

613
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:29,960
So what do you know?

614
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,299
They're a drug cartel, we think.

615
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,570
The name Golden Circle
keeps coming up.

616
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,130
We'll look into them.
What else?

617
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,540
One of our former trainees
is working with them.

618
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,057
Charlie Hesketh.

619
00:46:40,182 --> 00:46:41,370
Total prick.

620
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,180
You got any promising leads on him?

621
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:44,840
His ex-girlfriend.

622
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,250
I've been tracking her through social media.

623
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,350
We believe she's still in contact with him.

624
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,520
And she's going
to Glastonbury Music Festival.

625
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,420
Oh, good.

626
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,490
Agent Tequila,
break out your dancing shoes.

627
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:01,760
You have a new mission.

628
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,800
Yes, sir.

629
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,870
Hold up.

630
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,669
You feeling Ok?

631
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,670
I'm a little tired, but fine thanks.

632
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,640
Galahad, you ready?

633
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:13,770
Your face...

634
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,180
You got...

635
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:18,950
What the...

636
00:47:19,374 --> 00:47:20,179
fuck?

637
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,410
Oh, shit.

638
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,320
Head to the sick bay.

639
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,050
Have Ginger check you out.

640
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:29,990
Give him your glasses.

641
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,730
You're in luck, kid.
Put them on.

642
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,800
You get our finest senior agent
to join you instead.

643
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,500
Right now, he's in our New York office.

644
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,240
Galahad, meet Agent Whiskey.

645
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,780
<i>Kid,</i>

646
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:53,180
looks like we're hooking up
with a chick at a rock concert.

647
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,780
My favorite kind of mission.

648
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,350
I'm sending my jet to pick you up.

649
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,870
We've dealt with this kind of amnesia before.

650
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,080
Harry's like a computer,

651
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:15,864
that needs to be rebooted.

652
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:20,840
We need to recreate a shock
or trauma from his past,

653
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:22,640
to trigger his memory.

654
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,410
I hope you're right.

655
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:36,720
<i>Excuse me.</i>

656
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,730
<i>There seems to be
some sort of a problem here.</i>

657
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,140
<i>Help!</i>

658
00:48:40,665 --> 00:48:41,700
<i>Somebody!</i>

659
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,381
What the hell is going on?

660
00:48:44,206 --> 00:48:45,054
Help me!

661
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:48,970
Help!

662
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,040
Oh, God!

663
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,070
Stop!

664
00:48:53,127 --> 00:48:54,127
Fuck!

665
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,560
Get him out now.

666
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,730
No, no, wait. His instincts are gonna kick in.

667
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,550
No. I'm sorry to do this.

668
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,509
Are you Ok?

669
00:49:54,834 --> 00:49:55,834
What happened?

670
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,940
Harry, you've forgotten who you are.

671
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,370
We thought this might jog your memory.

672
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,780
Look, when you were young,
you had a choice.

673
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:07,850
To either be a lepidopterist
or to join the army.

674
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,671
You chose the army.

675
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:10,880
That led to Kingsman.

676
00:50:10,904 --> 00:50:13,190
You became a Kingsman agent.

677
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,970
I doubt whether I'd work for anyone
who drowns their employees.

678
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,260
I want to go home.

679
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,990
I want my butterfly collection.

680
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:22,730
I want to see Mother.

681
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,400
<i>There's nothing more we can do.</i>

682
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,270
It's time to let him go.

683
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,979
Babe, I wish I could stay longer,

684
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,520
but I've got to go on with this mission.

685
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:43,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

686
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,397
Before you go,

687
00:50:46,522 --> 00:50:47,914
I wanna show you something.

688
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,330
I know he could never replace JB but...

689
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,360
Oh, my days.

690
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,630
I hoped he might make you happy.

691
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,240
And give you another reason
to come back home soon.

692
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:09,210
I love him.

693
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,440
But I don't need another
reason to come home.

694
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,716
I apologize.

695
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:21,860
Just waiting for my friend.

696
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:24,090
I'll be back as soon as I can, I promise.

697
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,530
Got to go save the world?
Yep.

698
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,760
Well, if you save the world...

699
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,430
you know what that means.

700
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:34,100
Yeah, all right.

701
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:38,770
Bye, buddy.

702
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,710
Got the passes from my contact.

703
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,350
You're gonna love Glastonbury.

704
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,280
Well, that's the easy part, kid.

705
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,220
Take a look in the glove box.

706
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,360
Fucking hell, bruv.

707
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,530
Thought everything
was supposed to be bigger in America.

708
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,260
Is this why you overcompensate
with these massive cars?

709
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,770
Goes on your finger.

710
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,480
The surveillance tracker is in the tip.

711
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,670
Apply light pressure for three
seconds to release it.

712
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:20,310
Ok, so according to her Instagram feed,

713
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:23,320
Charlie's ex-girlfriend
is up ahead at the VIP bar.

714
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,180
Which one of us is gonna
plant the tracker?

715
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,550
Bands, boys.

716
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,520
Yeah, that's fine.

717
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,460
I say we both make an approach,

718
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,790
whoever gets on best, goes for it.

719
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,640
Well, it doesn't have
to be a competition, bruv.

720
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,030
Why don't we just go up to her,

721
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,340
shake her hand, pat her on the back,

722
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,700
whatever, you know.
Job done.

723
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:43,000
The hand is not
a mucous membrane, Eggsy.

724
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,070
Neither is the back.

725
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,510
They teach you anything at Kingsman?

726
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,780
What are you talking about?

727
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,710
Our trackers are designed
to enter the bloodstream.

728
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,880
They circulate harmlessly,
providing full audio and GPS.

729
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,280
Mucus membrane.

730
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,980
That's like up the nose, isn't it?

731
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,950
What the fuck am I gonna do?
Stick my finger...

732
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,030
It's not just inside the nose, is it?

733
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,160
No, Eggsy, it aingt.
Fuck.

734
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,930
All right, I'll take the first crack.

735
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,370
Watch and learn, buddy.

736
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:16,740
Good luck.

737
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,440
Here you go, ma'am.
Thank you.

738
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,110
Miss, I beg your pardon.

739
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:27,710
Now, I don't wanna pester to you but,

740
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,950
I just have to know,
what time are you playing?

741
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,520
I'm not in a band.

742
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,120
Oh, God.
Who did you think I was?

743
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:35,989
Please don't say someone ghastly.

744
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:37,960
God damn it, now I feel like a fool.

745
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,368
I just assumed that a woman with your...

746
00:53:41,393 --> 00:53:42,393
charisma...

747
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,530
well she just had to be somebody.

748
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,860
Right.

749
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:47,600
Thank you.

750
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:50,440
No, it's Ok. I know you didn't mean
to make me feel like a dumb-ass.

751
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:53,370
So I'll let you make it up to me
by letting me buy you a drink.

752
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,470
Follow my finger.

753
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,710
What are we doing?

754
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,780
Swiping to the left.

755
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,320
What, you don't do Tinder in America?

756
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:07,490
Tinder what?

757
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,420
Do you know, I think it's
probably a generational thing.

758
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,730
It translates as "Go away, old man".

759
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,360
Be good, be cool.

760
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,870
Bye.

761
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,740
Thank you for that.

762
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:24,700
I'm Clara.
River.

763
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,910
Bloody hell, is that the time?

764
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,210
You know what, I'm so jetlagged
I don't know if I'm coming or going.

765
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,010
Where've you been?
Anywhere nice?

766
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:34,398
South America.

767
00:54:34,623 --> 00:54:36,320
Been spending a bit of time out there.

768
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:37,580
Training with the shaman,

769
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,650
and trying to really connect
with my spirit animal.

770
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,020
Yeah.
I'm a crow.

771
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,360
And, hang on, let me guess...

772
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:44,890
No.
Jaguar.

773
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,324
What?
No!

774
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:47,530
Oh, my God!

775
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,630
Yes?
How did you even know that?

776
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,030
Look, it totally is.
Check it out.

777
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,970
Oh. Ino Moxo.
Black jaguar. Very nice.

778
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,210
You know what?

779
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,795
I wanna buy you a drink.

780
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,820
Eggsy sent this from Glastonbury.

781
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,520
♪ Bluerash is trending on Twitter.

782
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:16,760
Have you found any correlation
between these cases?

783
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,890
Only recreational drug use.

784
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,000
I know. Not very Statesman-like.

785
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:25,230
Tequila here...

786
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:28,270
he is our resident bad boy.

787
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,699
You don't think this could be related

788
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,470
to The Golden Circle, do you?

789
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,610
A drug cartel poisoning its customers?

790
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,840
Doesn't make sense.

791
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,920
Poppy, would you pass the sugar, please?

792
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:49,020
Ok.

793
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:52,360
But it's really bad for you.

794
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:55,930
Eight times more addictive than cocaine.

795
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,600
Five times more likely to cause death.

796
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,270
But it's legal so,

797
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,200
you know, you go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

798
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,240
Don't get me started
on tobacco and alcohol.

799
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:09,480
Peddle that stuff and you're in Fortune 500.

800
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:10,940
But me? No!

801
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,580
I'm out here hiding

802
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,080
in the middle of nowhere. Homesick.

803
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,680
Because I sell drugs.

804
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:17,688
Oh, Pops.

805
00:56:18,013 --> 00:56:20,121
You're doing this because you're homesick?

806
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,250
Yes.

807
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:23,660
I want freedom.

808
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:25,990
I want fame.

809
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:29,829
Our profits were 250
billion dollars last year.

810
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:33,270
I am the most successful businesswoman
in the world, but nobody knows who I am.

811
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,430
Pops, Pops.

812
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:35,900
It's not long now?

813
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,770
You're right, thank you.

814
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,770
Sorry to interrupt you.

815
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,140
You wanted to see me, Madam Poppy?

816
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:43,799
Yes, Angel.

817
00:56:44,224 --> 00:56:47,710
In The Golden Circle
we do not sample the merchandise,

818
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,879
and we do not break the rules.

819
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,420
Which is why I have invested in robots,

820
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:56,319
because they are so much more reliable

821
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,220
and trustworthy than human beings.

822
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,820
Oh! Oh, no.

823
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,870
Sorry we never found your friends.

824
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:51,610
Well, we all go on our separate journeys,

825
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,480
but ultimately we'll all arrive
at the same destination.

826
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,230
Shall we check my tent?

827
00:57:56,455 --> 00:57:57,750
See if they're there?

828
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,550
Yeah.
Oh, come on.

829
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,290
This is amazing.

830
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:10,960
Come on.

831
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,930
You know what, I'm busting
for a pee actually.

832
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:15,870
You could do it on me if you want.

833
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,070
Maybe in a bit.

834
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:22,270
Give me a sec, yeah?

835
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:25,010
Ok, but hurry up, River.

836
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,110
Been waiting all night for you
to at least kiss me.

837
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:35,860
Hey!

838
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:38,360
<i>Hi, babe.
Bit of a nightmare.</i>

839
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,359
<i>I've got to sleep with a target,</i>

840
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,760
<i>but I won't do it,
unless you agree that it's all right.</i>

841
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,930
You've got to be fucking kidding.

842
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,370
What was I, target practice?

843
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,100
<i>Babe, surely it's better that
I'm honest with you,</i>

844
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,650
<i>rather than me doing it and not telling you.</i>

845
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:54,510
<i>Kind of got a bit of
a save the world situation here.</i>

846
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,740
How the fuck is screwing someone
gonna save the world?

847
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,509
Well, it's a bit complicated but

848
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:03,150
trust me, I would not be
doing it if I didn't have to.

849
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:08,720
Babe, please believe me.
I love you.

850
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:11,060
You are the person I wanna spend
the rest of my life with.

851
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:14,360
Is that a proposal?

852
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,460
<i>Because I think I'd give you
my permission.</i>

853
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,400
<i>Having that security, knowing
that we were committed,</i>

854
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,300
<i>In that context, yeah.
Yeah, I'd feel different.</i>

855
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:28,940
Right. Well, I mean...

856
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,839
I want to be with you,

857
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,210
but being a public figure babe,
like a prince...

858
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:36,920
It's a bit of a factor, you know
what with my job and stuff.

859
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,320
Oh, no, no, no, come on. Ok.

860
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,019
Look, we need to talk about this properly.

861
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,620
Just give me five minutes, Ok?

862
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,830
<i>Don't put yourself down, Eggsy.</i>

863
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,400
<i>I'm sure you can last longer than that.</i>

864
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,436
What's the matter?

865
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:19,590
Nothing.

866
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:22,830
I just feel that our spirit animals
need more time to get in sync...

867
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:26,230
and find a harmonious bond
on the spiritual plane.

868
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,470
Totally.

869
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,500
Yeah?

870
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,400
Or we could just...

871
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:33,770
fuck?

872
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,450
Clara, I don't think I can.

873
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:51,990
Do you know what?

874
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,390
My crow is looking for a place to nest.

875
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,770
Good work, Eggsy!

876
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:42,670
Tracker fully functional.

877
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,650
Don't worry, I've been
through this with Whiskey before.

878
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:50,320
Nice to be working with an agent
who knows what he's doing.

879
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,420
<i>Wow, Mr. Crow. My turn.</i>

880
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,620
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't.

881
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:58,920
I'm in a relationship.

882
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,075
That's adorable.

883
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,654
Listen, so am I.

884
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,200
What happens at Glasto, stays in Glasto.

885
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:06,830
I can't.

886
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,470
Bye, Clara.

887
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,469
<i>This is Princess T,</i>

888
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:16,780
<i>please leave a message.</i>

889
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:20,020
<i>Motor Manor Hotel...</i>

890
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:22,050
Yeah, can you put me through
to Princess Tilde, please.

891
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,419
Actually sir, I'm just looking at my computer,

892
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:28,089
and I'm afraid that the princess
is already checked out.

893
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:29,090
<i>Thank you.</i>

894
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,620
Fuck!

895
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,280
Harry.

896
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:04,032
What's going on?

897
01:03:04,057 --> 01:03:05,320
I was just packing.

898
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,760
Look at these lovely toiletries Merlin
very kindly gave me as a leaving present.

899
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:10,230
Here, try this aftershave.

900
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,400
Yeah, I know Harry.
I'm wearing it.

901
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,570
Listen, you can't just give up.

902
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:19,640
Give up?

903
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:22,180
No, on the contrary.
I'm about to achieve my dream.

904
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:26,310
Researching rare butterflies alongside
some of the finest minds in entomology.

905
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,860
You know, you may as well
have me stuck up on this wall.

906
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:43,000
'Cause you're never gonna find a butterfly
more interesting than me.

907
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:44,530
Sorry?

908
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,729
When you and I first met,

909
01:03:47,754 --> 01:03:49,230
I was just like a maggot.

910
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:50,540
Maggots turn into flies.

911
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:52,140
Perhaps you mean larva.

912
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:55,810
Larva, yeah, Ok. Whatever. The point is,
everyone wanted to squash me.

913
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,710
But not you.

914
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,910
You helped me to become a caterpillar.

915
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:03,550
And now I've got wings.

916
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,550
I'm flying higher than I ever dreamed.

917
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:08,190
And that is all thanks to you.

918
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,660
I hate to seem rude, but I need to
finish packing and get some sleep.

919
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:13,190
Harry, you can't just walk away.

920
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:14,790
Kingsman needs you.

921
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:16,930
The whole world needs you.

922
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:21,100
I need you.

923
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:23,270
Eggy,

924
01:04:23,553 --> 01:04:26,640
whoever the Harry was that you knew,
he's gone, I'm afraid.

925
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,400
Goodbye.

926
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:08,910
That's not a martini.

927
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,880
It is in Kentucky.

928
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,320
Fair enough.

929
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:21,860
<i>Here's to you, Eggsy.</i>

930
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:24,060
You're exactly what Kingsman needs.

931
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:36,170
<i>This is Princess T.</i>

932
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:37,640
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

933
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:42,980
Can I have another Martini, please?

934
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,420
Sure.

935
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,490
Thanks.

936
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,600
Give up.

937
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:37,600
You know what?

938
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,340
That was the best Martini I've ever had.

939
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:42,840
Keep the change.

940
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:44,040
Thanks.

941
01:06:58,660 --> 01:06:59,930
It's all right.
Don't panic.

942
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,700
Just thought I'd bring you
a little leaving present.

943
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:09,870
What do you think?
He's lovely, isn't he?

944
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,440
Would you like to hold him?

945
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:16,510
Hello.

946
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,420
Do you think I should shoot him?

947
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:28,838
Are you quite mad?

948
01:07:28,963 --> 01:07:30,220
What? What's the problem?

949
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,860
No! You can't!
What?

950
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:34,590
No, you'll have to shoot me!
What shoot you?

951
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:35,730
Well, I will shoot him.

952
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,559
No. No one's sick enough
to shoot a puppy!

953
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,640
Well, what about you, Harry?
You were sick enough to shoot a puppy!

954
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:40,670
Do you remember?

955
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:05,220
<i>You were sick enough to shoot a puppy!</i>

956
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,050
It was a blank.
Yes, Harry. Yes!

957
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:36,150
It was a fucking blank!

958
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:37,230
That's right. It was a blank!

959
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,520
I would never hurt Mr. Pickle!

960
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,560
Yes, Harry!

961
01:08:39,584 --> 01:08:41,990
He lived to a ripe old age!
He died of pancreatitis!

962
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:49,570
You're not Mr. Pickle.

963
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:57,980
Eggsy.

964
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:00,940
Hello Harry.

965
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:14,930
Eggsy.

966
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:22,170
Valentine has to be stopped.
No, I know.

967
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,410
He has a device.
It's all right.

968
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:24,900
It's sorted. Don't worry.

969
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:27,240
We got a lot of catching up to do.

970
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:29,410
Well, well.

971
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,580
I suppose I should cancel that taxi.

972
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,280
Yes.

973
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,920
If you don't mind...

974
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:38,750
Merlin.

975
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:41,950
Welcome back...

976
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:44,090
Galahad.

977
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:50,770
Now that we've finished the debrief Harry,

978
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:52,560
here's a couple of welcome back gifts.

979
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:53,830
First up,

980
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,230
a brand-new Kingsman watch.

981
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:59,500
Advanced software it can hack
into anything with a microchip.

982
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:00,800
It is the bollocks.

983
01:10:00,824 --> 01:10:02,210
And Merlin...

984
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,640
I made you these.

985
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:29,000
Thank you, Merlin, Eggsy.

986
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:31,240
How do I look?
You look...

987
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:35,270
Like some faggot looking for an eye fucking.

988
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:37,910
Now...

989
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,950
why don't you get out of our bar...

990
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:43,880
before I take out your other one?

991
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,050
Now, is that any way to welcome a visitor
from out of town, moonshine?

992
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:49,490
Ok.

993
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:53,290
Suck my southern dick,

994
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,760
bitch.

995
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:57,330
No, I don't think that'll be necessary.

996
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,030
Good day, sir.

997
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,700
Well...

998
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,370
What are you ladies waiting for?

999
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,740
Manners...

1000
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:12,680
maketh...

1001
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:16,420
man.

1002
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,780
Do you know what that means?

1003
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:23,720
Then let me teach you a lesson.

1004
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,470
Are we going to stand around here all day?

1005
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,600
Or are we going to...

1006
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,570
You big...

1007
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,290
Well pick him up.

1008
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:04,300
Now, that is not what I call
a Kentucky welcome.

1009
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:10,170
Manners maketh man.

1010
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,800
Let me translate that for you.

1011
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,590
What's wrong with me, Merlin?

1012
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:34,960
I thought you fixed me?

1013
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:37,160
Well, we rebuilt your neural pathways.

1014
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,600
But it'll take time to get
your coordination back.

1015
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,820
And the phantom butterflies?

1016
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:03,590
You will experience episodes,

1017
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:04,860
lapses of clarity.

1018
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:06,960
You'll be back to normal soon.

1019
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:26,610
I feel like a tornado in a trailer park.

1020
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,350
<i>♪ Golden Circle proudly presents. ♪</i>

1021
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:34,550
<i>Mr. President, my name is Poppy Adams.</i>

<i>And I invite you to begin negotiations...</i>

1026
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:46,600
on the largest scale
hostage situation in history.

1027
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:48,769
A few weeks ago,

1028
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:50,570
an engineered virus was released,

1029
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,200
contained in all varieties of my product.

1030
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:57,810
<i>Cannabis, cocaine, heroin,
opium, ecstasy...</i>

1031
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,240
<i>and crystal meth.</i>

1032
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:03,050
<i>Some of you are already infected.</i>

1033
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:05,220
<i>And this is what you can expect</i>

1034
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:06,750
<i>in the coming days.</i>

1035
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:10,461
<i>After a brief incubation period
victims present</i>

1036
01:14:10,486 --> 01:14:12,038
with stage one symptoms.

1037
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:14,760
A blue rash.

1038
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:16,690
Next.

1039
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:18,730
Second stage symptoms appear.

1040
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:20,530
Mania.

1041
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,400
As the virus enters the brain.

1042
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:25,070
<i>Very distressing to the victim</i>

1043
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,740
<i>and those around them.</i>

1044
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:28,810
<i>Stage three.</i>

1045
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:31,210
Paralysis.

1046
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,310
Muscles enter a state
of catastrophic seizure.

1047
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:36,910
And once the muscles of
the thorax become affected...

1048
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:39,620
breathing becomes impossible,

1049
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:43,990
leading to a very nasty death
within 12 hours.

1050
01:14:45,291 --> 01:14:46,291
But...

1051
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:48,061
I have good news,

1052
01:14:48,086 --> 01:14:50,800
to the millions already affected.

1053
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:52,760
It doesn't have to be this way.

1054
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,270
I have an antidote.

1055
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:14,090
What have you done to me,
you fucking bitch?

1056
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:17,720
100% effective,

1057
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,590
and ready to ship out worldwide

1058
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:21,230
at a moment's notice.

1059
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,360
Get out of my room!
You have my word.

1060
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:25,060
Get out!
I will do this...

1061
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:28,670
if the following conditions are met.

1062
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,370
Get out of my fucking room!

1063
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,440
<i>First, you agree to end the war on drugs,</i>

1064
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:36,870

1065
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:39,610
<i>All classes of substance are legalized,</i>

1066
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,610
<i>paving the way to a new marketplace</i>

1067
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:44,720
<i>in which sales
are regulated and taxed...</i>

1068
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:46,250
<i>as per alcohol.</i>

1069
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:50,990
<i>And second, my colleagues
and I receive full legal immunity.</i>

1070
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,957
<i>Meet my terms</i>

1071
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:55,660
<i>and I look forward to helping you
keep our beloved country great...</i>

1072
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,330
<i>boosting our ailing economy,</i>

1073
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,500
<i>and easing spending on law enforcement.</i>

Or continue this blinkered, outmoded,

1075
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:06,340
and frankly disastrous
exercise in prohibition...

1076
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:09,140
and live with blood on your hands.

1077
01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:12,740
<i>Save lives. Legalize.</i>

1078
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,390
I told you that shit was no good for you.

<i>Adams was briefly held</i>

1082
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:36,800
<i>for serious mental health issues,</i>

1083
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:38,970
<i>before disappearing without a trace.</i>

1084
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,670
<i>Intelligent, ambitious, ruthless,</i>

1085
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,410
<i>lacks empathy, superficial charm.</i>

1086
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:48,150
<i>All the elements of a great CEO.</i>

1087
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:50,420
<i>Or a psychopath.</i>

1088
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,679
<i>Following the broadcast</i>

1089
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,250
<i>of Adams's message to the president...</i>

1090
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:56,350
<i>there were scenes of chaos today,</i>

1091
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:59,590
<i>at medical centers across the country
and around the world.</i>

1092
01:16:59,614 --> 01:17:02,830
We have no more beds available.
The hospital is at full capacity.

1093
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,330
<i>The blue rash is now being renamed
The Dancing Disease,</i>

1094
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:09,270
<i>as victims begin to exhibit
stage two symptoms.</i>

1095
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:16,840
Let's prep the cryo unit.

1096
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:18,380
You want to freeze him?

1097
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:19,780
Exactly.

1098
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:21,010
<i>Victims of the virus</i>

1099
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:23,580
<i>caused by contaminated
recreational drugs,</i>

1100
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:27,650
<i>flooded hospitals and clinics
in fear for their lives.</i>

1101
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:32,419
<i>Curfews and no travel orders</i>

1102
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:35,830
<i>are being considered as authorities
assess the scale of the disaster.</i>

1103
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:37,300
Close it.

1104
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,800
<i>But there has still been</i>

1105
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:42,830
<i>no official response from the president,</i>

1106
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:45,600
<i>who remains locked in emergency talks.</i>

1107
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,470
Prepare a presidential decree.

1108
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:52,640
Tell intelligence and law enforcement
to stand down.

1109
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,580
We're gonna dance to this lady's tune.

1110
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:55,810
Good.

1111
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:57,480
We can make this work.

1112
01:17:57,481 --> 01:18:00,049
We... We spin it that it's not a matter

1113
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,750
of negotiation with terrorists.
No, what I'm proposing...

1114
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:05,660
is we appear to agree to her demands,

1115
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:08,465
to prevent global panic and then...

1116
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:12,124
let the junkie scum go down in flames.

1117
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,500
Yeah.

1118
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:20,140
Take Poppy Adams and her so-called
Golden Circle down with them.

1119
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:24,540
No drug users, no drug trade.
It's a win-win situation here.

1120
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:28,750
But sir, we're not talking about
a handful of hostages.

1121
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,279
We could be looking at the deaths

1122
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,120
of hundreds of millions worldwide.

1123
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:34,890
Hundreds of millions of criminals,
burdens to society.

1124
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,220
Am I right, McCoy?

1125
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:38,390
Absolutely, sir.

1126
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,620
But sir that's...

1127
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,990
What about people who were
just experimenting?

1128
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:44,660
Folks who self-medicate?

1129
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,675
Functioning professionals?

1130
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:47,800
Kids?

1131
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:49,370
Spare me the crap, Fox.

1132
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,000
The fact is,

1133
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:54,170
this presidency has just
won the war on drugs.

1134
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,540
Congratulations, sir.

1135
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:56,940
Thank you.

1136
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:02,210
And that deserves a toast.

1137
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:05,550
This is totally unethical, sir.

1138
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,280
Fox, shut up!

1139
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:10,120
McCoy, declare martial law.

1140
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:12,860
<i>We need to keep control,
commandeer stadiums,</i>

1141
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:14,790
<i>schools, civic centers,</i>

1142
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:16,659
<i>order a press blackout.</i>

1143
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:19,970
<i>And put the military on standby
to round these junkies up.</i>

1144
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,870
Whether they broke the law or not,

1145
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,170
those victims are human beings.

1146
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,440
Tequila.

1147
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,080
He's a great guy.

1148
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:34,040
And a great agent.

1149
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,623
Right now...

1150
01:19:36,248 --> 01:19:38,651
he's lying in deep freeze
waiting on our help.

1151
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,480
We can't make this personal, sir.

1152
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:41,990
Personal?

1153
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,820
Agent, we can't stand by
and let folks like him die.

1154
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,490
These people, we're their only hope.

1155
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:51,100
Now, we have to find that antidote.

1156
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:53,930
Poppy's stockpiles, well,
they could be anywhere.

1157
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:55,500
She must have some on hand.

1158
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:57,200
Locate Poppy...

1159
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,770
and obtain a sample for analysis.

1160
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:03,070
Maybe it can be replicated.

1161
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:04,570
<i>Sorry to cut in, guys.</i>

1162
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:06,350
<i>But Charlie is on the phone
with his girlfriend.</i>

1163
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:07,610
<i>Looping you in now.</i>

1164
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,010
<i>Don't worry. I'm on a payphone,</i>

1165
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,550
covered in a fucking blue rash.

1166
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:13,980
Why didn't you tell me?

1167
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:16,290
<i>All you said was,
don't take any drugs.</i>

1168
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:19,020
<i>It was a music festival for fuck's sake.</i>

1169
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:21,413
Fuck. Shit. Shit!

1170
01:20:22,138 --> 01:20:23,155
Ok.

1171
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:26,330
Listen. You need to get to the lab in Italy.

1172
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,070
<i>Do you remember where we went skiing?</i>

1173
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,870
Yes. Yes, I remember.

1174
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,740
Yeah. Meet me there

1175
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:33,270
and I'll give you the antidote.

1176
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:35,840
Ok.

1177
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:41,810
All right. Jet's ready.

1178
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:44,380
Whiskey, Galahad, get to Italy.

1179
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,250
You two need to fix this code name thing.

1180
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:51,820
And with all due respect, sir.

1181
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:54,830
I don't think Galahad senior
is ready to return to fieldwork.

1182
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:58,100
I did actually mean...
Of course.

1183
01:20:58,230 --> 01:20:59,900
And with all disrespect...

1184
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,600
I'm not going anywhere without him.

1185
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:06,370
Brains, skills...

1186
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:08,870
skipping rope?

1187
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,940
It's a lasso.
Whatever.

1188
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,640
Come on.

1189
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:18,380
Go on. Vamoose.

1190
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:19,820
Yes, sir.

1191
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,870
Drink it.

1192
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:47,480
<i>It's working already.</i>

1193
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:49,710
<i>Thank God.</i>

1194
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:51,250
Agent Whiskey.

1195
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,750
<i>Antidote confirmed at the target's location.</i>

1196
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:54,920
<i>Good luck.</i>

1197
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:05,960
Hold up.
We need you down here, Galahad.

1198
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,600
To secure the control room.

1199
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:09,270
Probably a good idea, Harry.

1200
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,470
Call you from the top, yeah?

1201
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:21,850
Buongiorno!

1202
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,680
Buongiorno.

1203
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:37,930
Hey!

1204
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:40,410
So sorry about this.

1205
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:48,170
At the controls. In position.

1206
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:09,360
Keep this cable car here till we get back.

1207
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:10,860
<i>Roger that, Eggsy.</i>

1208
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,930
Clara's definitely here.

1209
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,260
We're getting warmer.

1210
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:22,570
Harry Hart, Harry Hart,
super spy, super spy.

1211
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,080
Looks like we've got a door.

1212
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:27,410
Yep.

1213
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,080
There you go.

1214
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,890
I'll cover.

1215
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:43,530
Hi, there.

1216
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,330
Sorry I'm late.

1217
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:49,070
You guys did not make this place easy to find.

1218
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,430
Who are you?

1219
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:52,900
I'm here to collect this antidote.

1220
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:54,940
For Singapore?

1221
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:56,780
Yeah.

1222
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:03,680
You are Wu Ting Feng?

1223
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:08,650
Yes.

1224
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:12,420
Hey, how are you still alive?

1225
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:14,660
River, what are you doing here?

1226
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:15,790
River?

1227
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:17,030
Hi, Clara.

1228
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,070
What happens at Glasto, stays in Glasto.

1229
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:24,800
You motherfucker!
Bye, Charlie.

1230
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:26,240
Sound the alarm!

1231
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:28,470
You fucking cockroach!

1232
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:30,310
Jam the door!
Give...

1233
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:39,150
Fuck!

1234
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:41,050
Galahad, we're coming.

1235
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:42,790
<i>All clear at the bottom?</i>

1236
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,290
<i>Galahad, come in!</i>

1237
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:48,020
Open the fucking door.
They've locked.

1238
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:49,290
Open the door!

1239
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,370
Harry, come on, we're in.
Let's go.

1240
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,930
Away, butterflies.

1241
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,330
Butterfly? No, Harry.
You've got to shut the doors, please.

1242
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:58,240
<i>Come on.
We've gotta go now. Please!</i>

1243
01:24:58,370 --> 01:25:00,100
Shut the fucking door, Harry!

1244
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,840
<i>Harry, are you there?</i>

1245
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:05,640
Well done, Harry.
Good. Thanks, man.

1246
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,740
Come on. Now!

1247
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:10,420
It's done.
Thank you.

1248
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:35,970
You all good down there, Harry?

1249
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:37,140
All clear.

1250
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,910
<i>Hello, Eggsy.</i>

1251
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:46,550
<i>Enjoy the ride,</i>

1252
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:47,774
bruv.

1253
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:57,460
Oh, shit.

1254
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,410
All the buttons are dead.
Controls gone.

1255
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:10,680
Everything's in shutdown.
You're on your own, Eggsy.

1256
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:57,950
What the fuck is that?

1257
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,910
Oh, my God.

1258
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:50,840
You've gotta be fucking kidding!

1259
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:11,700
Jesus fucking Christ!
What the fuck is that?

1260
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:13,730
What the hell is that?

1261
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:14,900
Shit!

1262
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:44,830
That's the first decent shit
I've had in three weeks.

1263
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:51,940
Harry, meet us at the
emergency rendezvous point.

1264
01:28:51,970 --> 01:28:53,140
Roger that.

1265
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,140
Got you on the GPS.

1266
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:26,840
So weird to think this tiny thing
could save the world.

1267
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:28,740
Let me have a look.

1268
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:33,910
Harry.

1269
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:39,720
Am I late?

1270
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,350
You found the antidote.

1271
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:45,990
Get down!

1272
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:04,440
You fucking dickhead!

1273
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:06,279
Fuck you! I just
saved your life!

1274
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:08,180
Yeah, and cost millions of people theirs!

1275
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:23,060
All right,

1276
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:24,659
they're going for cover and reloading.

1277
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,100
I'll fix their wagons.
Cover me, boys!

1278
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:31,030
Wait.

1279
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,470
Eggsy, I think he could be
working for the other side.

1280
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:35,540
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1281
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:37,610
You're having a brain fart! Look!

1282
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:40,480
Does that look like he's working with them?

1283
01:30:41,710 --> 01:30:42,645
Harry...

1284
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:44,950
are you seeing butterflies again?

1285
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,480
I know what I'm seeing.

1286
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:39,740
Good job he didn't need our help.

1287
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:43,010
Thank fucking Christ
I didn't need any backup!

1288
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:52,120
I'm out of ammo!
Troop carrier coming in.

1289
01:31:52,150 --> 01:31:53,250
What've you got?

1290
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:56,120
Fuck!

1291
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:01,990
Shit! There's a fuck ton of 'em!

1292
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:06,860
What is this?

1293
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,970
Looks like you packed for
a fucking slumber party, not a mission!

1294
01:32:11,070 --> 01:32:13,440
And they've got fucking Gatling guns!

1295
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:17,170
You have 10 seconds
to surrender before we open fire!

1296
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:18,440
Guys, hurry up!

1297
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:19,510
10!

1298
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:20,540
Hey!

1299
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:23,010
9!
Butterfly guy!

1300
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:25,580
8!

1301
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,520
You don't look like
Ginger fixed you right.

1302
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:28,550
7!

1303
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:29,820
I said I'm empty!

1304
01:32:29,850 --> 01:32:31,360
6!
Give me yours.

1305
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,860
5!

1306
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:34,220
Harry, give him the fucking gun!

1307
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:35,290
4!

1308
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:39,160
Harry, no!

1309
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:44,740
Oh, fuck it! Fire!

1310
01:32:45,170 --> 01:32:46,400
Harry, get down!

1311
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:56,680
I mean, honestly Harry,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

1312
01:32:56,710 --> 01:32:58,180
He broke the vial on purpose!

1313
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:01,220
You're a fucking idiot!
You're out of control, Harry!

1314
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:03,330
If we made it out of here,
he was gonna kill us both!

1315
01:33:08,190 --> 01:33:10,730
For fuck's sake, it looks like he wouldn't
have fucking had to!

1316
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:12,200
Oh, ye of little faith.

1317
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:36,250
This does not mean
you're off the fucking hook!

1318
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:38,490
We need to go dark.

1319
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,660
We don't know who else at Statesman
could be working against us.

1320
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:43,590
Shit! This is all my fault.

1321
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:45,800
You weren't ready for the field
and I pushed for it!

1322
01:33:45,830 --> 01:33:46,900
He showed his hand.

1323
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:48,930
You think he'd have let us live?

1324
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:50,770
You should be thanking me
for saving our arses!

1325
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:53,540
Saving our arses?
Try saying that to fucking Whiskey!

1326
01:34:03,650 --> 01:34:05,450
You are unbelievable!

1327
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,850
Merlin, can you hear me?
<i>Yes, Eggsy.</i>

1328
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:09,290
Whiskey's down.
He's been shot.

1329
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:11,190
What happened?

1330
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:20,230
He got caught in the crossfire.

1331
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,000
<i>I've applied the alpha gel.
We'll bring him in.</i>

1332
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:26,300
But first, I've gotta find a way to get back
up to that lab and retrieve more antidote.

1333
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:32,310
<i>Charlie, what's happening?
Where are you?</i>

1334
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:34,140
<i>Everything's under control.</i>

1335
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:36,880
I'm sorry, Charlie.
I'm so sorry.

1336
01:34:37,010 --> 01:34:39,280
<i>Please don't tell Poppy
it was me they followed.</i>

1337
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:40,780
<i>Don't worry, darling.</i>

1338
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,420
<i>What happens in Italy...</i>

1339
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:46,560
<i>stays in Italy.</i>

1340
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:48,860
Thank you.

1341
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:03,904
Merlin, change of plans.

1342
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:06,480
Wu Ting Feng, Singapore.

1343
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:07,840
Who?
<i>Exactly.</i>

1344
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:09,250
It's the only lead we've got.

1345
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:11,450
So I suggest you find out who he is.

1346
01:35:13,150 --> 01:35:14,180
Come on.

1347
01:35:18,190 --> 01:35:19,180
Wu Ting Feng,

1348
01:35:19,181 --> 01:35:20,760
he's an assistant at a law firm.

1349
01:35:20,990 --> 01:35:22,630
Let's get through their firewall.

1350
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:23,860
Yep.

1351
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:25,830
Merlin...

1352
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:28,330
have you ever wanted
to do more than this?

1353
01:35:29,530 --> 01:35:31,130
Are you serious?
Yeah.

1354
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:32,300
This is vital.

1355
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:33,900
Without us, they'd be lost.

1356
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:35,840
I know, but you know what I mean.

1357
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:37,570
Get out there in the field.

1358
01:35:38,610 --> 01:35:39,780
Well, have you ever asked?

1359
01:35:39,810 --> 01:35:41,050
Of course I have.

1360
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:43,510
But every time an agent's
position has come up...

1361
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:46,250
Whiskey has voted against me.

1362
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:47,880
No.
Yeah.

1363
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,090
Wait, wait, wait.
Look, check it out.

1364
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:53,590
Email in from Poppy,
from a senior partner at the firm.

1365
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:56,560
They're coordinates.

1366
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,400
Cambodia?

1367
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:04,930
You have any reconnaissance
drones down in Asia?

1368
01:36:04,970 --> 01:36:06,650
Sure do.
Sending them in right now.

1369
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:14,990
<i>The government today urged</i>

1370
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:16,180
<i>Golden Circle victims</i>

1371
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:18,150
<i>to report to the temporary field hospitals</i>

1372
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:20,850
<i>now set up across the country.</i>

1373
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:22,890
<i>The president's handling of the crisis</i>

1374
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,690
<i>has been commended
by other world leaders.</i>

1375
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:28,360
Damn. Politics has never been so easy.

1376
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:29,730
Oh, Jesus.

1377
01:36:29,954 --> 01:36:30,959
Fox.

1378
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:31,960
What?

1379
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:40,970
Oh, God.

1380
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:47,180
Like I said, sir...

1381
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:50,110
this affects all people from all backgrounds.

1382
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:51,950
I'm disappointed, Fox.

1383
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,650
Disappointed and disgusted.

1384
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:55,139
Mr. President,

1385
01:36:55,564 --> 01:36:59,160
I routinely work a 20 hour
day for you, 7 days a week.

1386
01:36:59,490 --> 01:37:01,930
Maybe some can do that
without chemical help.

1387
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:04,900
Countless people are going to die.

1388
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:07,160
You can save them, sir.

1389
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:09,770
Innocent people like me.

1390
01:37:12,030 --> 01:37:13,640
Not that innocent.

1391
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:45,570
He looks great.

1392
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:46,600
Good.

1393
01:37:51,970 --> 01:37:53,340
Good news, gentlemen.

1394
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:54,980
He'll be back on his feet in no time.

1395
01:37:55,010 --> 01:37:56,980
I'm not certain that's a good idea.

1396
01:37:57,010 --> 01:37:58,110
What do you mean?

1397
01:37:58,150 --> 01:38:00,180
I shot Agent Whiskey.
Deliberately.

1398
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:01,720
What, why?

1399
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,050
He was working against us.

1400
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:05,490
And until we find out why,
I say we trust no one.

1401
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:07,260
Merlin, Harry's sick.

1402
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:09,160
This whole thing is my fault.

1403
01:38:09,190 --> 01:38:10,690
I thought he was ready.

1404
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,070
I'm sorry, I've got to take this.

1405
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,900
Listen to me.

1406
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,869
This is not about my mental health.

1407
01:38:21,870 --> 01:38:24,470
If there's a chance there's
a double agent in our midst,

1408
01:38:24,610 --> 01:38:25,610
or worse,

1409
01:38:25,803 --> 01:38:28,481
if Statesman itself has a dark agenda...

1410
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:30,680
we have to safeguard this mission.

1411
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:34,150
We both know the president
wants these victims dead.

1412
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:36,250
Hey, baby.

1413
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:39,260
<i>Hey.</i>

1414
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:42,520
Fuck.

1415
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:44,367
Look, Harry, I trust you.

1416
01:38:44,492 --> 01:38:45,560
I always have.

1417
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:47,421
But it's about this situation.

1418
01:38:47,846 --> 01:38:50,000
We need Statesman's resources.

1419
01:38:50,030 --> 01:38:52,100
And I need to know
that you are fit for work.

1420
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,870
Babe, why didn't you call me?

1421
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,539
<i>Are you the banana man?</i>

1422
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:57,475
Listen, we're on the verge of finding
an antidote.

1423
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:58,570
It's gonna be all right.

1424
01:38:58,610 --> 01:38:59,509
Now, look left for me.

1425
01:38:59,510 --> 01:39:00,790
There's nothing wrong with my brain.

1426
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:01,880
Look right.

1427
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:03,909
Can you remember the headline

1428
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:05,679
when you uncovered that
spy ring in the Pentagon?

1429
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:07,820
The football.
England beat Germany, 5-1.

1430
01:39:07,950 --> 01:39:09,350
Thatcher's assassination attempt.

1431
01:39:09,390 --> 01:39:10,450
Charles and Di's wedding.

1432
01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:12,060
<i>Hey, Bjorn Borg.</i>

1433
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:24,000
Babe, if you can hear me,

1434
01:39:24,730 --> 01:39:26,300
I want you to know that I love you.

1435
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:28,480
<i>And if we get through this,
and you'll have me back,</i>

1436
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,840
<i>I wanna be with you.
No matter what.</i>

1437
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:33,780
I promise I won't let you down.
It's all gonna be all right.

1438
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:35,310
My favorite singer.

1439
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,480
I don't bloody know.
How would I know that?

1440
01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:39,420
It's John Denver.
Merlin!

1441
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:42,050
Have you got eyes on that location yet?

1442
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:44,489
Soon. The reconnaissance
drone's about an hour away.

1443
01:39:44,490 --> 01:39:45,530
Which gives us time to sort out...

1444
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:47,060
Bollocks, we haven't time for anything.

1445
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:49,190
I'm leaving now.
With or without you.

1446
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:08,710
Hello!

1447
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:10,710
Identify yourself.

1448
01:40:11,150 --> 01:40:12,781
My name is Stacey Prewitt.

1449
01:40:12,806 --> 01:40:14,580
I'm Ms. Poppy Adams' attorney.

1450
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:17,390
Poppy, you expecting a lawyer tonight?

1451
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:19,660
Oh, yes. Please send him in.

1452
01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:22,090
<i>But don't forget to reactivate the landmines.</i>

1453
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:29,460
Good evening, Ms. Adams.

1454
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:34,270
<i>My lawyer is bringing you
the document right now.</i>

1455
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:35,870
<i>Hurry up.</i>

1456
01:40:36,310 --> 01:40:37,939
<i>And once you countersign,</i>

1457
01:40:37,940 --> 01:40:39,910
<i>it becomes an executive decree
and you can't back out,</i>

1458
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:41,240
<i>and then I release the antidote.</i>

1459
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:44,710
Can you give me any assurance
you can get it out there in time?

1460
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:47,319
<i>And where's it gonna come from?
How long it'll take to distribute?</i>

1461
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:49,520
I wouldn't worry about that.
I have secure stockpiles,

1462
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:52,590
hidden in every major city worldwide.

1463
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:55,030
And when I enter the access code,

1464
01:40:55,060 --> 01:40:56,460
my fleet of drones

1465
01:40:56,490 --> 01:40:59,360
will distribute the antidote immediately.

1466
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:01,900
So don't dilly-dally signing that document

1467
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,800
'cause time is running out.

1468
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:08,070
You dumb bitch!

1469
01:41:17,850 --> 01:41:18,880
You all right?

1470
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:22,790
What was that phone call you got?

1471
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:24,790
Let's not, Harry.

1472
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:26,659
I don't think you'd sympathize

1473
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:29,020
and I'm not really in the mood for a lecture.

1474
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:33,860
All right.

1475
01:41:36,730 --> 01:41:38,330
How about a martini?

1476
01:41:38,855 --> 01:41:40,094
For old times' sake?

1477
01:41:41,770 --> 01:41:42,810
Yeah, all right.

1478
01:41:55,950 --> 01:41:57,320
I had a girlfriend.

1479
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:01,760
I lost her.

1480
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:04,130
And it broke me.

1481
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,130
And now, if this mission fails...

1482
01:42:10,070 --> 01:42:11,500
she's gonna die.

1483
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:15,710
I know it's against Kingsman rules,

1484
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,270
having a relationship.

1485
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:23,180
When I was shot...

1486
01:42:23,610 --> 01:42:26,680
can you guess what the last thing
was that flashed through my mind?

1487
01:42:29,150 --> 01:42:31,209
It was absolutely...

1488
01:42:32,334 --> 01:42:33,384
nothing.

1489
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:36,830
I had no ties.

1490
01:42:37,530 --> 01:42:39,500
No bittersweet memories.

1491
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:42,100
I was leaving nothing behind.

1492
01:42:44,570 --> 01:42:46,640
Never experienced companionship...

1493
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,170
never been in love...

1494
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:52,010
and in that moment...

1495
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:53,896
all I felt...

1496
01:42:54,021 --> 01:42:55,750
was loneliness...

1497
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:57,510
and regret.

1498
01:42:59,050 --> 01:43:00,280
I'm sorry.

1499
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:01,650
Don't be.

1500
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:06,190
Just know that having something to lose...

1501
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:10,290
is what makes life worth living.

1502
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,860
Now, let's go and save your girl.

1503
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,800
I missed you, Harry.

1504
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:23,210
Gentlemen.

1505
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:25,240
I hate to break up a party.

1506
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:26,739
We're nearly there,

1507
01:43:26,964 --> 01:43:28,734
so I suggest we get ready.

1508
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:31,050
Follow me.

1509
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,830
Oh, yes.

1510
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:53,900
Hello, gorgeous.

1511
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:55,070
I'm Jack. What's your name?

1512
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,410
How would you like to ride
home on a real cowboy?

1513
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,010
I got a six pack of cold ones on ice

1514
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,210
and my roomie's out all night.

1515
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:03,480
So you can scream my name
as loud as you need to, sugar.

1516
01:44:03,510 --> 01:44:05,880
I hate to do this to you, Jack.

1517
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:07,420
Who's this pretty lady?

1518
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:08,850
She's dead.

1519
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:11,490
Cops said wrong place, wrong time.

1520
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,660
<i>Hey, honey. I'm heading
to the grocery store.</i>

1521
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:20,000
<i>My name is Poppy Adams.</i>

1522
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:37,950
Ginger.

1523
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:41,350
Goddamn butterfly guy shot me
in the fucking head.

1524
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:42,850
Why would he do that?

1525
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,660
Well, I'm guessing you didn't fix him right.

1526
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,490
And where the hell is he?

1527
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:51,622
He's on his way to Cambodia,

1528
01:44:51,647 --> 01:44:53,330
with Eggsy and Merlin.

1529
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,400
That's where Poppy's base is.

1530
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:57,130
Eggsy's gonna need backup.

1531
01:44:57,170 --> 01:44:58,400
Yes, he is.

1532
01:44:58,430 --> 01:44:59,870
Get the Silver Pony on the runway

1533
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:01,100
and ready to take off.

1534
01:45:11,850 --> 01:45:13,150
Hey, hey.

1535
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:15,750
Looking good, Merlin.

1536
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:18,090
Feeling good, Eggsy.

1537
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:23,590
Right. This is yours.

1538
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,130
That's for you.

1539
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:40,640
Press the S.

1540
01:45:41,410 --> 01:45:42,880
Minesweeper.

01:45:43,010 --> 01:45:44,480
Courtesy of Statesman.

1542
01:45:45,010 --> 01:45:47,250
And what about these?
Careful.

1543
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:48,550
Those are hand grenades.

1544
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:52,290
As discussed,

1545
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:54,090
this is for the endgame.

1546
01:45:55,090 --> 01:45:56,630
I'm entrusting it to you.

1547
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:05,770
And I'm entrusting, this...

1548
01:46:08,710 --> 01:46:09,770
to me.

1549
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:35,600
<i>Millions of Golden Circle victims worldwide,</i>

1550
01:46:35,730 --> 01:46:38,740
<i>are now entering stage three paralysis.</i>

1551
01:46:41,470 --> 01:46:42,580
<i>In his latest statement...</i>

1552
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:44,170
<i>the president promised he was doing</i>

1553
01:46:44,210 --> 01:46:45,570
<i>everything in his power</i>

1554
01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:48,750
<i>to speed up negotiations and save lives.</i>

1555
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,450
<i>But fears are growing that for many,</i>

1556
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,250
<i>it may soon be too late.</i>

1557
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:54,750
<i>Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims.</i>

1558
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:56,750
<i>God help us all.</i>

1559
01:47:39,930 --> 01:47:41,970
Right.
This is where we split up.

1560
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,400
Pincer movement.

1561
01:47:43,530 --> 01:47:44,670
Merlin, you're with me.

1562
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:47,000
Eggsy, you signal when we're in position.

1563
01:47:55,210 --> 01:47:57,280
Don't move.

1564
01:47:58,310 --> 01:48:01,020
You move, we die.

1565
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:11,630
Luckily, I have this.

1566
01:48:19,970 --> 01:48:23,740
This spray will freeze the trigger mechanism...

1567
01:48:23,770 --> 01:48:26,840
give us a split second.

1568
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:29,350
So on the count of three...

1569
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:31,450
what I want you to...

1570
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:32,720
Merlin!

1571
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:50,170
Merlin, what the fuck have you done?

1572
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:53,270
Our journey together
began many years ago...

1573
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:56,640
when your father
did the same thing for us.

1574
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:59,070
Our journey began with a mistake I made.

1575
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:00,780
Give me the can.

1576
01:49:01,381 --> 01:49:03,210
That's an order.
Can's empty.

1577
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:05,350
Split second's over.

1578
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:07,320
You two need to get going.

1579
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:09,050
No, no, no, no.
There's got to be another way.

1580
01:49:09,090 --> 01:49:10,090
He's right.

1581
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:11,620
Mission comes first.

1582
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:12,990
Bollocks, mission comes first!
This is bull...

1583
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:14,090
Eggsy!

1584
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:16,760
This is no time for emotion.
Remember your training.

1585
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:18,230
Or we all die.

1586
01:49:20,530 --> 01:49:21,730
Now get on with it.

1587
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:24,370
Do as you're told.
Move it!

1588
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:33,310
Go.

1589
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:43,390
It's been an honor.

1590
01:49:45,650 --> 01:49:46,860

He stepped on a land mine.

Can we get somebody out there
to clean that up?

1622

Hello?

Crap. We're under attack.

1625

You two, off your fucking asses.

1626
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:12,200
Guard the door.

1627
01:52:12,230 --> 01:52:14,240
Sir Elton, stay here.
We're under attack.

1628
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:19,170
Is it a rescue attempt?

1629
01:52:19,394 --> 01:52:20,379
Might be.

1630
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,480

What day is it today?

1638
01:52:35,614 --> 01:52:36,219
Wednesday.

1639
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:37,390
Exactly!

1640
01:53:18,130 --> 01:53:20,370
Elton, just calm down.
Fuck you!

1641
01:53:32,150 --> 01:53:33,450
Stay there, Elton.

1642
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:34,580
Fuck off!

1643
01:53:34,620 --> 01:53:36,620
Or I'll fuck you up.

1644
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:12,520
Fuck me.

1645
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:14,320
Holy cow.
Get this out of here. Go!

1646
01:55:16,150 --> 01:55:17,650
Eggsy, get the case.

1647
01:55:22,190 --> 01:55:23,860
You are going to tell me...

1648
01:55:24,190 --> 01:55:25,530
what the access code is.

1649
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:58,450
Come on, Jet. Good girl.

1650
01:57:04,030 --> 01:57:05,690
Motherfucker!

1651
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:39,630
Get out of the way, Elton.

1652
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:42,230
Stay down.
It's not allowed to hurt me.

1653
01:57:42,470 --> 01:57:43,470
Thank you.

1654
01:58:21,770 --> 01:58:23,340
<i>Fuck you, Poppy!</i>

1655
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:25,270
<i>Fuck you, Poppy!</i>

1656
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,640
Fuck you, Elton.

1657
01:58:29,050 --> 01:58:31,710
Kill Elton John.

1658
01:58:34,850 --> 01:58:35,850
Fuck!

1659
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:39,520
Elton, take the ball.

1660
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:50,430
Thank you.

1661
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:53,170
Now, go off and save the world.

1662
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:55,900
If I save the world, can I have
two tickets to your next concert?

1663
01:58:55,940 --> 01:58:57,910
Darling, if you save the world,

1664
01:58:58,040 --> 01:58:59,840
you can have a backstage pass.

1665
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:09,750
Fuck you.

1666
01:59:12,750 --> 01:59:14,060
Time's up.

1667
01:59:14,090 --> 01:59:15,360
Fuck!

1668
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:22,160
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie!

1669
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:23,600
Get them!

1670
01:59:23,630 --> 01:59:24,700
Got it.

1671
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:27,200
Kill him, Bennie!

1672
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:29,540
Here, heel! Heel! Good boy!

1673
01:59:29,570 --> 01:59:30,610
Come on!

1674
01:59:37,050 --> 01:59:38,280
Give me the code.

1675
01:59:38,310 --> 01:59:39,650
No. We're not done yet.

1676
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:47,590
Lucky for you Charlie,

1677
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:50,320
one of us understands
what it means to be a gentleman.

1678
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:57,030
Let's make this fair.

1679
02:00:43,780 --> 02:00:45,050
Give me the code!

1680
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:46,220
I can't.

1681
02:00:47,050 --> 02:00:48,820
Only Poppy knows it.

1682
02:00:48,950 --> 02:00:50,750
Well, then you're no use to me, are you?

1683
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:52,450
For the record Charlie,

1684
02:00:52,490 --> 02:00:54,820
I'm more of a gentleman
than you'll ever be.

1685
02:00:55,860 --> 02:00:58,330
But right now, it's time
to drop the gentle bit.

1686
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:01,060
This is for Kingsman.

1687
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:03,670
For my mate Brandon.

1688
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:05,830
For Roxy.

1689
02:01:06,270 --> 02:01:07,800
For JB.

1690
02:01:10,100 --> 02:01:11,470
And for Merlin.

1691
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:14,640
Good night, bruv.

1692
02:01:41,370 --> 02:01:42,940
Hey, fellas.

1693
02:01:43,570 --> 02:01:45,140
You're going to give us the code.

1694
02:01:47,110 --> 02:01:48,380
Or what?

1695
02:01:48,810 --> 02:01:53,450
'Cause you don't seem like the kind
of gentleman who would hurt a lady.

1696
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:57,167
Perhaps not.

1697
02:01:57,592 --> 02:01:58,890
Call me old-fashioned.

1698
02:01:59,020 --> 02:02:01,420
I don't consider genocide
especially ladylike.

1699
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:03,590
Right. Enough small talk.

1700
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:07,360
Give us the code.

1701
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:08,660
Sure.

1702
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:11,000
No. I don't think so.

1703
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:22,240
Heroin.

1704
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:23,950
You know, where I come from,

1705
02:02:23,974 --> 02:02:26,140
this shit you've been peddling's
ruined a lot of lives.

1706
02:02:27,310 --> 02:02:28,950
But yours is even more deadly.

1707
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:32,990
But it feels so nice, it's gonna
make you lower your guard.

1708
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:34,863
Our colleague Merlin,

1709
02:02:35,088 --> 02:02:36,930
may he rest in peace,

1710
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:39,560
managed to synthesize your
horrible little formula...

1711
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:41,000
and speed up its effects.

1712
02:02:41,230 --> 02:02:43,969
So I would say you have
just under eight minutes

1713
02:02:43,970 --> 02:02:46,870
before paralysis sets in
and your breathing stops.

1714
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,000
But of course...

1715
02:02:48,705 --> 02:02:49,800
you know all about that.

1716
02:02:49,824 --> 02:02:50,881
So here's the deal.

1717
02:02:50,906 --> 02:02:52,669
You release the antidote worldwide,

1718
02:02:52,670 --> 02:02:54,180
and we make sure you get a dose.

1719
02:02:54,310 --> 02:02:56,410
I have to give you the code to live?

1720
02:02:56,440 --> 02:02:59,680
Honey, you're so smart.
You should work for me.

1721
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:01,080
Right. Give us the code.

1722
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:05,990
Why not? The decree's getting
signed soon...

1723
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:07,490
anyhoo.

1724
02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:11,290
It's Viva las vegan.

1725
02:03:12,090 --> 02:03:13,190
Get it?

1726
02:03:13,860 --> 02:03:16,330
Viva las...

1727
02:03:18,730 --> 02:03:20,800
Come snuggle with me.

1728
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:23,670
I like you.

1729
02:03:25,670 --> 02:03:27,780
I don't think that's terribly likely.

1730
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:51,230
She's OD'd.

1731
02:03:51,370 --> 02:03:52,540
You gave her too much.

1732
02:03:52,870 --> 02:03:53,900
Did I?

1733
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:57,169
You know, I really don't have as much
experience with all this drug stuff,

1734
02:03:57,170 --> 02:03:58,170
as people think.

1735
02:03:58,740 --> 02:03:59,970
Better be the right code.

1736
02:04:03,910 --> 02:04:07,380
Viva las...

1737
02:04:07,420 --> 02:04:08,520
So?

1738
02:04:12,290 --> 02:04:13,520
Don't move, kid.

1739
02:04:13,650 --> 02:04:14,860
You try anything funny,

1740
02:04:14,890 --> 02:04:16,210
and I'll turn this thing electric.

1741
02:04:17,690 --> 02:04:20,330
Now give up your guns fellas.
Slide 'em over.

1742
02:04:26,030 --> 02:04:26,930
Whiskey.

1743
02:04:27,270 --> 02:04:28,840
We are all on the same side here.

1744
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:29,970
You've had a head injury.

1745
02:04:30,010 --> 02:04:31,770
The exact same thing happened to Harry.

1746
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:34,280
You're having some sort of brain glitch.

1747
02:04:34,310 --> 02:04:37,180
Nope. My braings all good, kid.

1748
02:04:37,710 --> 02:04:39,150
And you know what?

1749
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:42,750
I reckon the same was true
for your friend Harry over here.

1750
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:45,590
Real fine instincts, I'll give him that.

1751
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:47,120
So stay still...

1752
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:48,570
or I'll dice him up so small,

1753
02:04:48,590 --> 02:04:49,700
you can take him home in a bucket

1754
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:51,090
and still have room for what's left

1755
02:04:51,130 --> 02:04:52,360
of your buddy, Merlin.

1756
02:04:53,700 --> 02:04:55,360
Well, that's just fucking great.

1757
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:56,970
You're working for the president?

1758
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,230
That asshole?

1759
02:04:59,370 --> 02:05:03,110
Hell no. It's a matter
of personal principle, agent.

1760
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:05,140
No more drug users.

1761
02:05:06,070 --> 02:05:08,840
And the Statesman share price rockets.

1762
02:05:10,610 --> 02:05:12,092
So those are your principles?

1763
02:05:12,517 --> 02:05:13,620
Making money?

1764
02:05:13,950 --> 02:05:16,250
Our agencies were
founded to uphold peace.

1765
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:17,490
To protect the innocent.

1766
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:19,490
Do you wanna know who was innocent?

1767
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:21,930
My high school sweetheart.

1768
02:05:23,090 --> 02:05:24,730
Love of my life.

1769
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:26,860
Pregnant with my little boy.

1770
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:29,430
He'd be about your age now,

1771
02:05:29,770 --> 02:05:31,730
if his mama hadn't got caught
in the crossfire

1772
02:05:31,770 --> 02:05:32,870
when two meth head freaks

1773
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:35,840
decided to rob a fucking convenience store.

1774
02:05:38,170 --> 02:05:40,140
A world without those people in it...

1775
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:43,650
sure smells like peace to me.

1776
02:05:44,910 --> 02:05:46,480
You break the law...

1777
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:48,580
you pay the price.

1778
02:05:49,650 --> 02:05:51,190
Good riddance...

1779
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:53,290
to all of them.

1780
02:05:58,730 --> 02:06:01,200
That's why I got to destroy that case.

1781
02:06:02,030 --> 02:06:05,030
Now slide it over, Agent Galahad.

1782
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:11,810
Thank you.

1783
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:13,710
Do you know what, Harry?

1784
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:15,310
I think he's got a point.

1785
02:06:17,950 --> 02:06:19,950
I think it sounds like a bright idea.

1786
02:08:37,990 --> 02:08:39,688
Put alpha gel on that,

1787
02:08:40,413 --> 02:08:41,584
dickhead.

1788
02:08:51,970 --> 02:08:53,570
Viva las vegan.

1789
02:08:55,770 --> 02:08:57,090
This one's for you, Merlin.

1790
02:09:11,690 --> 02:09:12,800
<i>It's a day of worldwide celebration</i>

1791
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:15,220
<i>as millions rejoice...</i>

1792
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:18,630
<i>after they or their loved ones
were saved from death.</i>

1793
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:33,539
<i>Distribution of The Golden
Circle antidote continues,</i>

1794
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:35,240
<i>and field hospitals are emptying</i>

1795
02:09:35,380 --> 02:09:38,710
<i>as victims return
to their homes tonight, cured.</i>

1796
02:09:59,770 --> 02:10:02,000
Come on, Liam. Man, come on.

1797
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:04,310
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1798
02:10:10,110 --> 02:10:11,750
I love you, man!
I love you!

1799
02:10:11,780 --> 02:10:13,720
I'm never touching that shit again!

1800
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:18,320
What happened?

1801
02:10:19,850 --> 02:10:22,090
Did I miss something?
You sure did.

1802
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:25,930
From now on, Tequila,
I suggest you stick to booze.

1803
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:30,430
<i>The president actively sanctioned</i>

1804
02:10:30,470 --> 02:10:33,700
<i>the deaths of hundreds
of millions of people,</i>

1805
02:10:34,570 --> 02:10:36,170
<i>and lied to the public.</i>

1806
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:40,070
<i>I am proud to be responsible
for his impeachment,</i>

1807
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:42,110
<i>and I will do everything I can</i>

1808
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:44,610
<i>to ensure a smooth transition of power.</i>

1809
02:10:45,610 --> 02:10:48,380
In honor of this historic occasion,

1810
02:10:48,520 --> 02:10:49,850
we have purchased...

1811
02:10:50,990 --> 02:10:52,720
a distillery in Scotland.

1812
02:10:54,460 --> 02:10:55,659
This shows the world,

1813
02:10:55,660 --> 02:11:00,530
that Kingsman is now
joining the liquor business.

1814
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:02,800
Before we were cousins.

1815
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:06,640
Now we're brothers,
working side-by-side.

1816
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:10,810
All our resources are now yours.

1817
02:11:11,140 --> 02:11:12,780
You can rebuild.

1818
02:11:13,410 --> 02:11:15,340
Yeah, y'all shitting in high cotton now.

1819
02:11:16,540 --> 02:11:17,936
Agent Tequila,

1820
02:11:18,037 --> 02:11:20,750
this is a formal occasion
where's your tie and jacket?

1821
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:21,820
Sorry, sir.

1822
02:11:21,950 --> 02:11:25,190
Maybe the Kingsman boys
can dress you properly.

1823
02:11:26,790 --> 02:11:28,060
To our union!

1824
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:30,430
To our union!

1825
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:35,860
Final order of business...

1826
02:11:37,060 --> 02:11:38,400
we would be honored...

1827
02:11:38,530 --> 02:11:41,570
if one of you would be
our new Agent Whiskey.

1828
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:46,580
Yeah, this two Galahad thing
is just fucking confusing.

1829
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:49,610
Well, I'm very honored...

1830
02:11:51,910 --> 02:11:53,010
Champ...

1831
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:57,120
I'd like to throw my hat in the ring.

1832
02:12:01,390 --> 02:12:02,460
All right!

1833
02:12:03,690 --> 02:12:05,030
Statesmen, the vote.

1834
02:12:08,030 --> 02:12:10,000
Looks like she's in.

1835
02:12:10,030 --> 02:12:11,330
Have a seat.

1836
02:12:15,870 --> 02:12:17,440
To Agent Whiskey!

1837
02:12:17,670 --> 02:12:18,810
Agent Whiskey!

1838
02:12:26,410 --> 02:12:27,410
Cheers!

1839
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:34,220
Are you sure I don't look like a dick?

1840
02:12:37,630 --> 02:12:38,690
Look in the mirror.

1841
02:12:44,730 --> 02:12:46,000
What do you see?

1842
02:12:46,130 --> 02:12:49,340
Someone who can't believe
what the fuck is going on.

1843
02:12:50,940 --> 02:12:52,570
I see a man who is honorable...

1844
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:56,040
brave...

1845
02:12:56,840 --> 02:12:58,010
loyal...

1846
02:12:58,550 --> 02:13:00,620
who's fulfilled his huge potential.

1847
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:04,850
A man who's done
something good with his life.

1848
02:13:06,150 --> 02:13:07,990
I owe you everything, Harry.

1849
02:13:09,660 --> 02:13:10,760
Thank you.

1850
02:13:11,090 --> 02:13:12,390
Don't mention it.

1851
02:13:13,660 --> 02:13:14,660
You ready?

1852
02:13:17,630 --> 02:13:19,270
Not a doubt in my mind.
