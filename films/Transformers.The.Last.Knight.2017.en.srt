1
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:36,140
Where in hell is your so-called magician?

2
00:01:36,307 --> 00:01:37,933
He will be here, Lancelot.

3
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,560
He swore it.

4
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:47,193
They're preparing for a second wave.

5
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,787
Charge!

6
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:09,840
This... This is what the end looks like.

7
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:35,616
Your so-called magician, Merlin, cannot help us.

8
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:37,409
We're outnumbered, 100 to 1.

9
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:38,911
How are we gonna get out of this?

10
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:40,430
He promised a weapon, one of great power.

11
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:41,747
Arthur, you are my king.

12
00:02:41,914 --> 00:02:43,058
I will lay down my life for you,

13
00:02:43,082 --> 00:02:45,751
but this Merlin is no wizard.

14
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,129
He's a worthless drunkard!

15
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:53,634
Oh, God, I'm sozzled!

16
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:55,678
One last nip.

17
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:12,069
Magic does exist.

18
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:14,905
It was found, long ago,

19
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:18,576
inside a crashed alien ship.

20
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:24,665
Hello?

21
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,084
Hello!

22
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:28,919
It is I,

23
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:34,008
conjurer of spirits, master of the dark arts!

24
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:36,218
Is anyone there?

25
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:40,097
It is I, Merlin.

26
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:41,932
The wizard?

27
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:44,101
Remember me?

28
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:52,985
No! I kept your secret! I did! Just as I promised!

29
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:56,071
I told no one of your existence. No one!

30
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:59,491
But you have to understand, we Britons

31
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,619
are in a desperate fight.

32
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:04,079
End-of-times sort of thing. I mean it.

33
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:06,165
It's happening down there now as we speak.

34
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:07,833
It's awful!

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,879
Big personalities just sort of clashing and bloody.

36
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:17,051
I hate to ask... But we need your help.

37
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:19,386
There are no spells. There is no magic.

38
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:21,881
We retreat. Live to fight another day.

39
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:22,348
No!

40
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:26,393
Without sacrifice... There can be no victory.

41
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,020
This is madness!

42
00:04:28,187 --> 00:04:29,521
He will be here.

43
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:31,857
All right, I am what they say!

44
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:35,694
I'm a liar, I'm a charlatan. I've deceived my whole life.

45
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,239
But if I could, for one moment,

46
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:40,199
change this world for the better,

47
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,534
I would give up everything. Everything!

48
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:45,537
I'd give up drink, money, wom...

49
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:47,373
Drink and money.

50
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:49,291
Look.

51
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,211
Good men will die without your help.

52
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:54,213
Women. Children.

53
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:58,342
I know your world was destroyed. I'm sorry.

54
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:01,387
But please don't let ours die, too.

55
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,974
I beg of you.

56
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:08,471
Guardian Knights, transform.

57
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:11,432
Dragon is yours to command.

58
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:14,525
Oh. Yes.

59
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:17,152
That would be just the thing.

60
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:22,449
Protect this staff.

61
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:26,578
One day a great evil will come for it.

62
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:55,149
Oh, yes!

63
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:06,744
Charge!

64
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,475
It has been said through the ages,

65
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:30,934
without sacrifice,

66
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,479
there can be no victory.

67
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:41,028
There are mysteries to the universe

68
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:43,614
we were never meant to solve.

69
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:46,950
I am Optimus Prime

70
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:50,287
and this message is to my creators:

71
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:53,207
Leave planet Earth alone.

72
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:55,292
'Cause I'm coming

73
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:56,794
for you.

74
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:02,466
These are troubled times.

75
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:11,642
Optimus Prime has left us to find his makers.

76
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:14,478
Some say he will never return.

77
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:18,482
His sworn enemy, Megatron... Vanished.

78
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:21,693
Without leaders, chaos reigns.

79
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,695
Two species at war.

80
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:25,531
One flesh, one metal.

81
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:30,327
Transformers are declared illegal on Earth.

82
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:33,539
The world has set up a new paramilitary force.

83
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:35,666
The TRF.

84
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:36,959
Except in Cuba,

85
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:39,545
Castro lets them sun on his beaches.

86
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:41,755
Hola, amigo! Come on! Vamonos!

87
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,133
- No, he's busy. - He's always busy.

88
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:48,929
A mojito needs ice.

89
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:50,597
Ice!

90
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:52,349
We are not animals.

91
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,228
But these alien beings keep arriving.

92
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:57,688
Endless waves of them.

93
00:07:58,188 --> 00:07:59,857
Too many to count.

94
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:03,527
We look to the skies with dread and we wonder.

95
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:06,447
This is the jam! Ooh, I like this.

96
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:08,699
Good choice. Good choice.

97
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:11,410
Get it off my desk.

98
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:13,829
No way!

99
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:14,996
Where'd you get that?

100
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:16,623
How much of our time remains?

101
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,879
One hundred billion trillion planets in the cosmos...

102
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:25,132
No, get the Director on the phone. Go, go, go!

103
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,968
And they choose Earth.

104
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:29,386
Why?

105
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:33,849
Y'all want to see some dead robots?

106
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:40,230
You crazy? This is an alien No-Go Zone.

107
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:43,609
Government doesn't want us to go in here.

108
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:56,725
We're not supposed to be here.

109
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,583
We're kids, man. We get away with anything.

110
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,168
Nah, man.

111
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:03,420
I'm getting me a souvenir.

112
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,594
Whoa, this is the real deal.

113
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:12,554
There's a dead one over there.

114
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,781
- Cool! - Not cool.

115
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:15,349
TRF shot 'em down.

116
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:18,769
Whatever. My dad says shoot 'em all and let God sort 'em out.

117
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:21,605
Chihuahua.

118
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:23,941
- Bro, what is that? - Dude.

119
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:25,234
It's a robot!

120
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:26,377
Dude, I think it's dead.

121
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:27,528
Nah, bro.

122
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:28,862
Yeah, it's totally dead.

123
00:09:28,946 --> 00:09:30,381
He's definitely, definitely dead.

124
00:09:30,405 --> 00:09:31,405
I know, right?

125
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:33,909
Wait, guys. I think it's moving.

126
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:50,133
Warning! Unauthorized trespassing.

127
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:50,979
Shit.

128
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,654
This is the Department of Homeland Security.

129
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:55,639
You are trespassing in an alien contamination zone.

130
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:59,810
Please step forward calmly and surrender.

131
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:01,812
Hey!

132
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:05,148
Mira, puto!

133
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:22,332
Sqweeks! Do it!

134
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:30,090
Follow me!

135
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:44,688
Come on, get up!

136
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:50,360
Hey, sir. This area is active.

137
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:52,195
We just had two Sentinels go down.

138
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:53,363
What have you got?

139
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:55,449
Never look back!

140
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:00,584
- It's coming! - All right, go in there.

141
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:18,180
Damn. I almost had a heart attack!

142
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:20,015
Relax. We're covered.

143
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:22,142
Sqweeks!

144
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:23,477
What's that?

145
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,728
What the...

146
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:27,519
What happened to your arm?

147
00:11:27,648 --> 00:11:29,149
Shot you?

148
00:11:29,524 --> 00:11:30,525
Damn it!

149
00:11:32,152 --> 00:11:33,487
He can't transform.

150
00:11:33,862 --> 00:11:34,988
I'm trying to fix him.

151
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:37,074
But you're being a baby about it, Sqweeks.

152
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:40,744
It's all right. You did good.

153
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:43,413
Wow. You have a big heart...

154
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:45,916
That seems to be working.

155
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,585
What's your workout routine?

156
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,225
Whoa!

157
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:05,519
It's all right. It's all right. I told you.

158
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,522
"Covered." It's Canopy.

159
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:13,819
Cyclops, zoom in on target.

160
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:17,280
Unable PID. Visual on five little feathers.

161
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:18,782
Kids. Shit.

162
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:20,951
Cannot confirm Decepticon.

163
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:22,703
No badge. I got kids in danger.

164
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:24,972
- Canopy thing's pretty crazy. - It's none of your business.

165
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:25,997
Stop flirting.

166
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:29,251
Request immediate air support. Danger close. Do not fire.

167
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:32,963
- Who is he? - Let's go.

168
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:34,756
Far as you're concerned, my boyfriend.

169
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,884
How long's that been going on?

170
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:42,878
You kids gotta get out of here.

171
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:44,641
"Kids"? You're here.

172
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:45,934
I live here.

173
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:47,561
This is my home.

174
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,313
What's this? The living room or the dining room?

175
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,023
Someone's gotta take care of 'em.

176
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:53,608
I don't think so.

177
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:55,736
- They're scared. They're lost. - Hurry.

178
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:58,339
I've got a heat signature. Hostile intent is displayed.

179
00:12:58,363 --> 00:12:59,406
Tango is armed.

180
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:01,634
On location 30 seconds. Am I cleared to fire?

181
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:03,994
No, place, no home, no family. Do you know how that feels?

182
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:06,455
No, 'cause your asses got big old houses to go home to.

183
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:08,457
- We got a condo. - Shh!

184
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:10,375
I love her.

185
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,728
Viper Flight. We need a clearance.

186
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:13,754
No badge, armed and hostile. I got kids in danger.

187
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,981
Hostile intent. Hostile intent.

188
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:16,506
- Alien has a weapon. - Fire!

189
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,315
He's down. Bravo team, extract those kids.

190
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:34,441
We're moving out!

191
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:40,614
- Get up. - I can't.

192
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:42,449
No, no, no, look at me.

193
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:45,535
Wake up, Canopy! You're gonna be okay.

194
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:53,335
I want to thank you.

195
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:56,069
Wake up, look at me. Wake up, Canopy.

196
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:57,464
I'm not leaving you.

197
00:13:57,714 --> 00:13:58,924
You're all I have left!

198
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:02,552
No, no, no.

199
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:10,569
Hey! It's all I got in my bag of tricks, so you might want to hop in.

200
00:14:21,947 --> 00:14:23,365
Hey! Where are the keys?

201
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:24,658
Where are the keys?

202
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:26,185
I'm just gonna hotwire this bitch.

203
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:41,716
- I'm tired of people messing with me. - It's over.

204
00:14:41,883 --> 00:14:43,844
No! I can fix him.

205
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,345
Nobody can fix him, he's dead.

206
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:47,889
Hey, look at me. Would he want you to die, too?

207
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:49,391
Let's go, now.

208
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:55,438
Come on, come on!

209
00:14:59,109 --> 00:15:01,528
Come on. Come on, no time, let's go.

210
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:03,196
What? Hey, you're that guy.

211
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,406
No, I'm not that guy.

212
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:05,716
The one who saves Transformers.

213
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,884
I thought you were just a legend.

214
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:07,951
Some legend.

215
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:09,202
- You were too late! - Go. Go.

216
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:11,055
Hey, you know there's a reward for turning you in.

217
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:12,079
- Really? - Yeah.

218
00:15:12,122 --> 00:15:14,522
Cool. You want to get punched in the face, like, really hard?

219
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,001
No.

220
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,836
- Good. Go. - Okay.

221
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:19,087
You're such an idiot.

222
00:15:19,254 --> 00:15:21,548
See ya around, "legend."

223
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:22,883
Sqweeks.

224
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:37,564
Oh!

225
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:39,983
Easy. Easy, all right?

226
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,068
I'm just here to help you.

227
00:15:46,156 --> 00:15:48,617
Easy, buddy. Yeah.

228
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:52,954
You're hurt really bad. All right?

229
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,336
Protect from Quin...

230
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:02,380
I'm sorry.

231
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:07,344
Take the...

232
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:11,514
The talisman will protect you.

233
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:12,974
Oh, you don't owe me anything.

234
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:15,268
Seglass Ni Tonday.

235
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:17,479
I can't. You keep it.

236
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:19,105
Quin... Quin...

237
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:26,446
He didn't make it, Bee. I'm coming out solo.

238
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:30,533
This is turning into one shitty-ass day.

239
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:05,628
Cyclops, eyeball Kingfish.

240
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:07,028
Flip IR to EO.

241
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:12,409
He's a positive match, sir. It's Cade Yeager.

242
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,329
It's over. Help yourself out here.

243
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:21,251
Where are the others? The ones you're hiding.

244
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:23,712
I don't sell out friends.

245
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:25,171
"Friends."

246
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:26,756
This is an invasion.

247
00:17:26,923 --> 00:17:29,926
One day we wake up... They're in charge.

248
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:32,095
You see anybody in charge?

249
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:34,723
They just keep falling out of the sky.

250
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:35,825
Something's coming,

251
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,434
and you can't shoot your way out of it.

252
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:05,754
What was that?

253
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:07,213
That was a mistake.

254
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:28,526
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

255
00:18:49,506 --> 00:18:50,548
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

256
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:52,842
Next time you shoot somebody,

257
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:55,428
don't go near 'em till you're sure they're dead.

258
00:18:55,512 --> 00:18:57,347
Put the weapon down, trust me!

259
00:18:57,514 --> 00:18:59,057
Easy, Bee. Easy.

260
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:04,020
I'll burn you so bad you'll wish you'd died as a child.

261
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:05,187
Shoot him!

262
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:07,232
You're dead before I hit the ground.

263
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:09,400
- I said stand down. - Shoot! Shoot!

264
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:12,654
Take the shot! Shoot!

265
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:14,364
Don't do it, Bee!

266
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:17,200
Hold your fire! Hold it!

267
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:18,868
You! Drop it!

268
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:21,287
I'm not dropping shit.

269
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,123
Hey.

270
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:24,966
The military doesn't want it this way,

271
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,292
Bee, you gotta believe that.

272
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:29,688
It's a new world order now and these guys are calling the shots.

273
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:31,548
All they want is a home, and you know it.

274
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:34,300
You push them, and they push right back.

275
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:37,220
Hound's in town.

276
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:39,264
Love starting the day off with a gunfight.

277
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:42,350
Sorry I'm late. My invitation to this ass-kicking

278
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:44,435
must've got lost in the mail!

279
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:46,813
Me and my crew are rolling out of here.

280
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,065
- Call off your birds. - Let's go.

281
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:50,733
They're not gonna touch us.

282
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,581
All right, Star 1, abort.

283
00:19:52,611 --> 00:19:54,028
Negative Decepticon activity.

284
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:57,115
TRF, stand fast. Drop your guns.

285
00:19:57,407 --> 00:19:59,173
You sure you don't want to shoot?

286
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:00,326
I'm a big ol' target.

287
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,203
Wusses.

288
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:04,372
Whose side are you on?

289
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:05,539
They're all bad.

290
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:07,625
No, they're not.

291
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:10,378
Eagle Eye, tag him.

292
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:17,051
I've never seen one like it, General.

293
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:21,055
This one's older, older than Optimus Prime.

294
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:24,601
Decepticon Barricade was spotted at that same location.

295
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:32,233
CIA's had him under Pred surveillance for a while now.

296
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:42,368
Yeah, he's been keeping some interesting company.

297
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,264
The staff is hidden on Earth.

298
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:47,624
A weapon of ultimate power.

299
00:20:47,957 --> 00:20:49,876
We'll find this staff.

300
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,377
That voice.

301
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:53,504
I can hear it in my nightmares.

302
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:55,232
- Megatron. - Waiting for authentication.

303
00:20:55,256 --> 00:20:56,257
It's him.

304
00:20:56,424 --> 00:20:58,384
Lord Megatron.

305
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:01,137
Get that out of my face.

306
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:02,764
Report.

307
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:05,391
Tell me you have found the talisman.

308
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:08,478
I saw it. A dying knight gave it to a human.

309
00:21:08,645 --> 00:21:11,272
But there was too much TRF firepower.

310
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:13,900
You let the talisman get away!

311
00:21:15,443 --> 00:21:17,612
We must have it!

312
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:20,823
Without the talisman, we cannot find the staff!

313
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,034
I know who can lead us to it.

314
00:21:23,993 --> 00:21:25,828
The TRF.

315
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:28,331
Commander in Chief wants that weapon,

316
00:21:28,498 --> 00:21:32,585
or "staff" as he calls it, secured at all cost.

317
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:35,421
Maintain your covert embed with TRF.

318
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:37,799
Sir... They just don't get it.

319
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:40,510
Our history with Bee and the Autobots.

320
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:45,556
Oh, what we would all give to have Prime back right now.

321
00:21:46,474 --> 00:21:48,309
Optimus Prime.

322
00:21:48,977 --> 00:21:51,771
Re-entry Cybertron.

323
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:16,337
My world!

324
00:22:16,838 --> 00:22:20,174
What has happened to my world?

325
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:22,802
Your world is dying.

326
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:27,890
I've been waiting for you, Optimus.

327
00:22:28,057 --> 00:22:29,851
Come meet your maker.

328
00:22:31,144 --> 00:22:33,730
You are my creator?

329
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,151
I am Quintessa, the Prime of Life.

330
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,281
What have you done to my home?

331
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:50,580
I will kill you!

332
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:55,251
You dare to strike your god?

333
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,423
Your war doomed Cybertron.

334
00:23:01,257 --> 00:23:03,593
Megatron started the war!

335
00:23:05,386 --> 00:23:08,097
You destroyed your world, you fool.

336
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,102
My perfect creation.

337
00:23:13,603 --> 00:23:15,438
You're going to fix it,

338
00:23:15,772 --> 00:23:19,317
or the race of Transformers dies forever.

339
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:23,946
I made you.

340
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:26,949
You are mine to command.

341
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:38,586
How did you get in here?

342
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,059
My lord, that weird thing

343
00:23:53,142 --> 00:23:56,020
we've been waiting for 1,600 years to happen...

344
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:58,773
I think it's really happening this time!

345
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:09,283
The knight has arrived.

346
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,495
The talisman has been bestowed.

347
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:18,334
At last, Cogman. It begins.

348
00:24:39,856 --> 00:24:41,357
Mine!

349
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,367
Yes!

350
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:56,497
Okay. Thanks.

351
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:58,082
Whew!

352
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:01,377
Wembly! I was quite open.

353
00:25:01,544 --> 00:25:03,504
There's a reason why you're always open.

354
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:05,191
There's a reason you're always single.

355
00:25:05,548 --> 00:25:06,883
- What? - What?

356
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:09,385
Idiot.

357
00:25:26,486 --> 00:25:28,237
Oh, God. Okay.

358
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:30,531
So late, so late, so late.

359
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:37,872
484 CE. A desperate last stand between civilization and barbarism.

360
00:25:38,414 --> 00:25:40,416
Two worlds colliding.

361
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,335
Only one survives.

362
00:25:42,502 --> 00:25:44,337
Lancelot. Percival.

363
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:45,671
King Arthur.

364
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:47,256
Honorable men.

365
00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:50,176
Brave, muscles sinewed,

366
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:53,012
sweat glistening off their bodies.

367
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:56,933
A few brave men who were willing to sacrifice all for victory.

368
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:59,352
Sound too good to be true, Poppy?

369
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,728
Because it's horseshit.

370
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:03,523
Arthur.

371
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:07,401
A likely composite of a Roman general and a Celtic king.

372
00:26:07,485 --> 00:26:09,487
Our dragon.

373
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:11,864
Just a medieval catapult.

374
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:14,283
And then we have Merlin,

375
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,035
our Kingmaker.

376
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:18,287
Probably never existed.

377
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:20,456
The question is,

378
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:24,252
why? Why do we tell ourselves these stories?

379
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:26,796
Other than the fact that dragons are wicked.

380
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:30,883
It's because we want to believe.

381
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:33,970
Believe that we can be heroes in our own lives.

382
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:36,472
When all seems lost,

383
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:38,891
a few brave souls, us,

384
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:41,143
can save everything we've ever known.

385
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:44,368
Or is it just the dragons?

386
00:26:58,995 --> 00:27:00,162
Well,

387
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,416
it won't be much longer now, old friend.

388
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,252
Signs of the end are all around us.

389
00:27:07,003 --> 00:27:09,380
You know what to do, don't you?

390
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:14,343
We must rebuild my home.

391
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:18,681
There is a way to heal your world.

392
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:22,351
My power of creation, the staff,

393
00:27:22,685 --> 00:27:26,772
was stolen from me by my 12 guardian knights.

394
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:30,985
They betrayed me and hid it on Earth.

395
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:33,904
Gave it to your precious humans.

396
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:39,368
The staff is the only way to bring life back to Cybertron.

397
00:27:39,452 --> 00:27:42,663
You are going to find it for me.

398
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:46,000
Do you seek redemption, Prime?

399
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:48,544
Do you?

400
00:27:48,711 --> 00:27:50,338
My maker,

401
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:52,506
I do.

402
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:59,305
No fear. No hate. No anger.

403
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:05,144
No fear. No hate. No anger.

404
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:08,189
Get off, you maggot!

405
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:12,318
I will kill you, flying rat!

406
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:17,490
He's very little. Very tiring.

407
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:19,825
Losing our heads sitting around here.

408
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:21,911
So tired of hiding.

409
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:35,091
Oh, hey, Chief! Wow, nice... Ow.

410
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:36,384
God!

411
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,219
Nice horse you got there.

412
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:40,627
You're really getting into this whole Indian thing, huh?

413
00:28:41,097 --> 00:28:44,100
Don't call me Chief. My name is Sherman.

414
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,744
Aren't you the tribal chief?

415
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:47,853
Yeah. But from you it sounds...

416
00:28:47,937 --> 00:28:49,855
I don't know, vaguely racist.

417
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,109
- My cruiser got stolen. - What?

418
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:55,444
- Again. - That's terrible!

419
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:56,570
You know what?

420
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:57,923
Shit's getting out of control.

421
00:28:57,947 --> 00:28:59,448
There's crime going on everywhere!

422
00:28:59,532 --> 00:29:00,866
A bunch of my stuff got stolen.

423
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,619
Cut the shit, Cade... And get me my car back.

424
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:16,132
Is this an Autobot hookup site?

425
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:17,633
Nah, I just go here to dream.

426
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:19,802
Check out that classy chassis.

427
00:29:20,428 --> 00:29:23,139
Whoa! Look at the junk in her trunk, eh?

428
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:26,183
Booyah! Big time.

429
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:29,228
I should not have eaten all of that Tijuana street machinery.

430
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:31,564
Damn, forgot about that cluster bomb.

431
00:29:31,731 --> 00:29:32,815
Yo!

432
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,260
What's your problem, dude?

433
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:35,568
Sqweeks!

434
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:38,487
Next time, ease on the brakes!

435
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:41,866
That's the way I roll. I like to make a statement when I arrive.

436
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:43,993
Well, you're getting dust all over the campus!

437
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:45,619
This ain't no campus. It's a junkyard!

438
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:47,830
Come on, hustle. Andale, andale!

439
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:51,417
Jimmy!

440
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:53,836
Hey, don't take any aggression out on me.

441
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,505
Damn it, Grimlock! We're guests here!

442
00:29:57,465 --> 00:29:59,008
You got in some shit, huh?

443
00:29:59,175 --> 00:30:00,342
Yeah, neck deep!

444
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:04,138
Cade, that's what you get for taking the yellow bugger.

445
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:06,932
You need a leader out there... Like me.

446
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:09,185
Shut up. Before I do some damage

447
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:10,686
you won't walk away from.

448
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,521
You will never be Optimus Prime.

449
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:13,981
You talk too much.

450
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:15,667
Come on, man. Million-year-old legendary warrior

451
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:17,735
and you act like a bunch of junkyard dogs!

452
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:19,278
You're starting to piss me off!

453
00:30:23,783 --> 00:30:25,534
Ay, chihuahua!

454
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:27,536
Come back here, Grimlock!

455
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:29,622
Turn around. What do you got in your mouth?

456
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,835
I swear, I am wasting my time protecting you.

457
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:36,420
Drop the cruiser right now!

458
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:38,964
I know you got Chief Sherman's cruiser.

459
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:40,216
Drop it!

460
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,803
Serves you right. Spit it out! Spit it!

461
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:45,137
Wow!

462
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:58,067
Don't eat cars. Don't eat cars.

463
00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:01,821
You get back in your hole and think about what you did.

464
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:05,032
It's like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade out here, Jimmy J.

465
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:08,869
You hired me from a want ad in the Dakota Penny Ledger.

466
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:11,330
Think that comes with a superpower?

467
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:15,000
That is a dinosaur! An alien dinosaur!

468
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:17,503
That was not in the ad!

469
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,129
It tried to eat me yesterday.

470
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:21,409
You want to go to federal prison?

471
00:31:21,674 --> 00:31:23,342
No, no, I don't want to go to any prison.

472
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:24,569
Well, that's where you're gonna go, okay?

473
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:25,953
'Cause you're aiding and abetting.

474
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,051
I'm a fugitive, all right?

475
00:31:27,096 --> 00:31:28,365
I'm the big boss, you're my little crimey.

476
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:29,390
When you leave,

477
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:31,767
it becomes the Wild Kingdom out here.

478
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,102
I don't know what to do.

479
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:34,509
I told you, this is a junkyard.

480
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:36,202
They blend in with other junk. That's it.

481
00:31:36,272 --> 00:31:39,024
You hired me to be senior vice president of worldwide operations.

482
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:41,002
- Did I tell you that? - Yes, that's what you said.

483
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:41,997
I made that shit up.

484
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:43,946
Do not take this title away from me, Cade.

485
00:31:44,113 --> 00:31:46,091
This is not a startup, okay? I don't do this shit for money.

486
00:31:46,115 --> 00:31:47,155
It's for the higher cause.

487
00:31:47,283 --> 00:31:48,552
You don't do this shit for the money?

488
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:50,202
What's wrong with you? How you gonna eat?

489
00:31:50,286 --> 00:31:51,871
What's he doing here?

490
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:56,625
Daytrader's here.

491
00:31:56,792 --> 00:32:00,296
Ugh! Here comes the most irritating, annoying Transformer on Earth.

492
00:32:00,713 --> 00:32:02,274
What did he give you to get past the gate?

493
00:32:02,298 --> 00:32:05,384
- Nothing! - Hey, Cade. He gave him this.

494
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:07,595
I've never seen that before in my life.

495
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:10,472
Come on, say it! You wanted the alien blaster.

496
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:12,391
You said a big gun makes a big man.

497
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:14,578
Hey, you know human beings lose their temper, right?

498
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:16,562
- Don't you dare! Hey, hey! - Come here!

499
00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:17,789
The worst senior vice president...

500
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:18,784
Stop it! Stop it!

501
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:21,150
Yeah, you're real tough! What, you been working out?

502
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:23,569
- Should I frag him? - Yes, definitely frag him.

503
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:24,904
I heard that, Hound.

504
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:25,988
Easy!

505
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,325
Oh, God. You always resort to violence right off the bat.

506
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:30,491
I love violence.

507
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:32,828
Daytrader! The hell are you doing here?

508
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:34,246
You find our spaceship yet?

509
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,473
I'm getting tired of hanging around here,

510
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:36,749
waiting to catch a bullet.

511
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:39,668
Carbon monoxide, and perhaps a small gasoline drinking problem

512
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:42,463
are gonna kill you long before a bullet, my corpulent comrade.

513
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:44,316
- Back off! Get out of my face. - Watch it! Guys, stop!

514
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,358
You want to throw down with Hound?

515
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:46,967
Tough guy, huh? Rude.

516
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:49,511
How about you trying to carry all this stuff?

517
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:57,019
Oh, that's where that's been.

518
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:58,145
Come on!

519
00:32:58,938 --> 00:33:00,105
Look what I found in Buffalo.

520
00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:02,566
Starscream's head, ladies and gentlemen.

521
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,610
Look what I got. New voice box for Bee.

522
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:05,861
Is it gonna work this time?

523
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:07,672
I only got the good stuff, Cade. Come on.

524
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:10,282
You hear that, Bee? You're gonna talk, buddy!

525
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:11,843
Can't touch this!

526
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:13,160
Get down, Bee!

527
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:14,536
Too hype, can't touch this!

528
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:16,288
All right, what else you got?

529
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:18,916
Where'd you get that piece of junk?

530
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:21,919
A Knight of lacon talisman in this dump?

531
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:24,838
Nah, it's not real. Is it? No, definitely not.

532
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:26,191
Hey, give it to me, I'll take it off you.

533
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:28,485
You think I don't know what the hell this is? How valuable?

534
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,153
But I know it's something, because it's got you

535
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:31,377
licking your chops, you skank.

536
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:33,055
Words hurt, Cade.

537
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:34,658
There are exactly seven... Count them.

538
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:36,392
Seven signs of the apocalypse.

539
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:39,061
And that talisman showing up here is numero uno.

540
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:40,771
If that fancy pancake was real,

541
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:43,774
I'd grab the spaceship and blow this dirtball planet.

542
00:33:43,983 --> 00:33:46,276
All right, I'm gonna go slather myself in oil.

543
00:33:46,402 --> 00:33:48,654
Turn your back, Drift, if it offends your sensibilities.

544
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,864
Now that is something you can't unsee.

545
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:52,676
I barely understand what's coming out of your mouth.

546
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,701
Hey, mister!

547
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:55,285
Oh, this isn't happening.

548
00:33:55,411 --> 00:33:58,080
You cannot stay here, kid. I got enough strays.

549
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:00,833
I'm not a kid! I'm useful. I fix shit.

550
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:03,002
- Yeah, good for you. - Better than anyone.

551
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:04,378
And I have a name, you know.

552
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:06,088
It's Izabella. Izabella with a Z.

553
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,382
I don't care if it's a Z, an emoji, or a dollar sign,

554
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,759
all right? This is no place for... Just go home. Please.

555
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,220
I don't got a home.

556
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:15,931
And they...

557
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:18,350
They just killed

558
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:21,228
the last thing that I called family.

559
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:23,981
So no,

560
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:27,568
I'm not going anywhere.

561
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:32,573
I want to stay and I want to fight them.

562
00:34:33,157 --> 00:34:35,075
You can't fight them, and you can't beat them.

563
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:38,245
All right? They have the support of the entire world.

564
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:39,830
You, you're a kid.

565
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:46,128
Why are you still following me?

566
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:50,883
T!

567
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:55,095
First flames, dude! Whoa!

568
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:57,181
Hey! Mister! Your trailer's on fire.

569
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,308
Whoa. Hey, corner.

570
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:02,019
- Oh, my God. - Buddy! Oh, I'm proud of you.

571
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:03,944
I know, but you gotta do it outside now, okay?

572
00:35:04,063 --> 00:35:05,856
You could burn this whole place down.

573
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,959
I know, but you're coming into your power now, all right?

574
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:09,568
So you gotta blow the flames... Ah! No.

575
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:15,324
Terry, get me a beer, will ya?

576
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,326
Hey, guys, you gotta cut the crap.

577
00:35:17,493 --> 00:35:18,869
You're tearing everything apart.

578
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,334
Perfect delivery, buddy. You gotta work on the pickup.

579
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:27,127
I still got him in training.

580
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:30,672
What happened to your family?

581
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:36,345
You first.

582
00:35:36,512 --> 00:35:38,847
Oh, wife passed away. Daughter's at college.

583
00:35:39,098 --> 00:35:40,682
She might as well be on the moon.

584
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:42,476
At least she's still here, bro.

585
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:43,995
I go and visit her, we both get arrested.

586
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:45,687
Is that bad enough for you, "bro"?

587
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:47,991
Your turn, unless you're too tough to share.

588
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:51,276
Decepticon fired a rocket.

589
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,154
Parents were home, I wasn't.

590
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:56,657
No way I was going to foster.

591
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,370
Hey, little guy.

592
00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:03,455
You're heavy!

593
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:06,041
You gotta go. You can't stay here.

594
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,126
I'm sorry.

595
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:13,382
Fine.

596
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,551
Fine.

597
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:18,720
I'll bounce in the morning.

598
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:21,199
Great. Look, if you're hungry, I got some frozen pizza burritos.

599
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:23,308
There might be some Smucker's in the fridge.

600
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,060
And tell everyone where you are.

601
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:27,146
Hey, am I being blackmailed by a 12-year-old?

602
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,231
Fourteen.

603
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:31,209
You know, you're really missing out.

604
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:32,913
'Cause it's okay to be a kid, Little J-Lo.

605
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:35,404
You think you're a bad-ass, huh?

606
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:37,382
All right, tough guy, I got a pop quiz for you.

607
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:39,825
Say you got an inline Energon leak on a Slant-6.

608
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:42,077
Don't get it fixed, Autobot's about to bleed out.

609
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:44,161
You got 30 seconds. Now, what are you gonna do? Go.

610
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,832
All right. First of all, Transformers don't have a Slant-6.

611
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:49,918
That's a Chrysler engine, like way back in ancient history.

612
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:51,354
The late '60s are not ancient history.

613
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:52,939
Yeah, but if I was fixing an Energon leak,

614
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:56,008
I'd cauterize the artery and re-channel the central flow into the... The...

615
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,759
The whatchamacallit, the tube with the...

616
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,928
- The doohickey thing. - Yeah.

617
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,138
Not bad.

618
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:02,931
Watch your mouth.

619
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:19,406
How long has this been here?

620
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:28,624
It's growing. Yeah.

621
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:30,292
Three meters a day.

622
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,263
Six horns.

623
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:47,309
Six horns, six locations.

624
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:50,157
And they're growing at an exponential rate.

625
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:52,689
Alien... Whatever they are.

626
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:55,609
Chinese call them "Horns from Hell."

627
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:57,319
Oh, my God.

628
00:37:58,028 --> 00:37:59,404
Cybertron is coming.

629
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:00,656
What?

630
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:04,594
I'll have 17 minutes to brief the President.

631
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:05,661
What do you got for me?

632
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:07,621
It's an unmodeled perturbation mass...

633
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:10,832
Look at this. It's amazing this thing flies at all.

634
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:12,764
Is it some kind of neck cancer?

635
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,671
No. It's much worse than that.

636
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:19,675
It's a gravitational anomaly caused by a planet-sized object

637
00:38:19,841 --> 00:38:22,094
with a current velocity of 1/10th light speed.

638
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:24,972
Hmm. That's some geek stuff. Is it a threat?

639
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:26,723
If you just give me...

640
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:28,642
No, I got a lunch. No.

641
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:31,478
No, it's not a threat.

642
00:38:32,562 --> 00:38:34,231
A threat might kill you.

643
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:38,026
This will kill you in three days.

644
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:44,491
How much do you weigh?

645
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,327
Are you technically considered overweight?

646
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:48,870
No. It's just all my gear.

647
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:52,207
It's like somebody packed 10 pounds of shit in a five-pound sack.

648
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,875
No, he's a chunky Autobot.

649
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:55,210
Ow! You wanna stop that?

650
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,421
Hound, pull up the sat phone.

651
00:38:57,921 --> 00:39:01,883
I'm bouncing a signal through Portugal, Istanbul and Katmandu.

652
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:04,594
You got 20 seconds, chief.

653
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:08,557
- Whoops. - Really?

654
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:10,559
Infestation of puppy transformers.

655
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:13,353
This here's a big boy zone.

656
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:15,063
Hello?

657
00:39:15,564 --> 00:39:17,065
Hello? Dad?

658
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:21,111
Look, I know... I know you can't talk to me

659
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:23,280
or say anything back.

660
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:25,615
But you can listen.

661
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:30,954
I'm gonna say what I always say until you hear me.

662
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:34,207
You don't need to save the world.

663
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:37,085
You need a frigging girlfriend.

664
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:41,256
Wherever you are, I don't want you to die alone.

665
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:45,260
And I know you only got five seconds left, so...

666
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:48,430
I'm fine, I'm safe.

667
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:50,974
And I love...

668
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:58,273
Any longer, they'd have snagged our location.

669
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:02,069
You're a hell of a father, Cade. Don't forget it.

670
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:04,321
Hell, my dad never called me.

671
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:14,456
We call it the Tank.

672
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,458
He likes it down here.

673
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:19,086
This is where I deal with the dark shit.

674
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:24,466
Decepticons seem just as interested in these structures as we are.

675
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:26,968
Pred snapped this in Siberia.

676
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:30,889
He's been seen at all six horn locations around the world.

677
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:33,975
ID confirmed. Megatron.

678
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,146
And get this. He made contact with TRF.

679
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:41,817
Snatched up two CIA case officers. Said he wants to negotiate.

680
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:44,277
With him? What the hell does he want?

681
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:47,531
Certain alien associates of his released.

682
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:50,826
Scheduled contact is ID'd and cleared.

683
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:53,662
Confirmation. Hostages are clear.

684
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:55,598
The Department of Justice has okayed it

685
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:58,375
so long as the US military watches his every move.

686
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:01,878
You're gonna be on point, because he is not our friend.

687
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,175
You know who they always kill first?

688
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:12,681
Lawyers.

689
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:16,268
We've made deals with the devil before during times of crisis.

690
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:18,061
If we're gonna get through this,

691
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,855
we have got to open the door

692
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:21,565
and let the monsters inside.

693
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,652
There is a weapon out there of unimaginable power.

694
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:28,196
A threat to our very existence.

695
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:30,323
And Megatron can lead us to it.

696
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:34,536
Do I know you, human?

697
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,539
- I want my crew! - Give me names!

698
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:40,709
- Mohawk. - Mohawk?

699
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:46,047
What up, fellas? Man, I want to kill you right now.

700
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:50,927
But I'ma kill you later.

701
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:52,972
Definitely gonna kill y'all mofos later.

702
00:41:54,055 --> 00:41:56,224
- He's cleared! - All right.

703
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,019
Dreadbot.

704
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,982
Dreadbot. In for bank robbery.

705
00:42:05,942 --> 00:42:07,819
Aggravated assault. Murder.

706
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:09,571
Double murder. Triple murder. Nine dead.

707
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:11,406
Didn't even take the money. No.

708
00:42:11,573 --> 00:42:12,908
We're not letting him out, no.

709
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:17,412
What?

710
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,664
I mean, but we can be flexible.

711
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:21,267
If he wears a GPS tracker, it's fine.

712
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:22,292
Okay, okay.

713
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:23,919
Okay.

714
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,171
Nitro Zeus.

715
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:27,589
Baby, free at last!

716
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:30,133
Thank Megatron, I'm free at last!

717
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:34,471
Thank you. Gonna miss you, Tim.

718
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:36,932
Thank you for your hospitality, Brad.

719
00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:39,184
I know where you live, Enrique.

720
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:41,686
Say hello to your wife for me.

721
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:44,940
But the government requests that he does not leave the county.

722
00:42:45,106 --> 00:42:47,275
- And we're serious about that. - Okay.

723
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,027
Okay.

724
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:53,240
And last but not least, Berserker.

725
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:55,825
I'll suck your brains!

726
00:42:57,869 --> 00:42:59,788
- Absolutely not. - Yeah. No.

727
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:02,374
No. No. There are limits. Pick again.

728
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,667
Onslaught.

729
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,835
You need a bigger door!

730
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:09,130
Uh...

731
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:11,341
Let me run that up the flag pole real quick.

732
00:43:11,424 --> 00:43:12,842
I just got to call someone.

733
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:15,387
Great, thank you. Yes. Yes!

734
00:43:15,595 --> 00:43:16,805
Go. Go.

735
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:19,599
What do you really want, Megatron?

736
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:22,394
What anyone wants, human.

737
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:24,145
To go home.

738
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:26,039
Yeah, that'd be all right with me, too.

739
00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:28,817
Megatron, he's after something Yeager has.

740
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:31,695
Something they need to help find this weapon.

741
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:34,447
We're gonna let those Decepticons do our dirty work.

742
00:43:34,614 --> 00:43:37,617
On my go, they'll be given Yeager's hideout coordinates.

743
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:40,328
You track Megatron every step.

744
00:43:40,954 --> 00:43:42,122
Take the weapon.

745
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:44,666
And then I'm taking his ass out.

746
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:49,212
No fear. No hate. No anger.

747
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:00,515
Hey, guys.

748
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:04,019
Rise and shine. Top of the morning!

749
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,399
Broke our asses bagging these Decepticons.

750
00:44:09,524 --> 00:44:10,525
Now they let them out?

751
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,599
What's really going on, Lennox?

752
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:13,737
Classified.

753
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:15,739
Just run your team.

754
00:44:23,371 --> 00:44:24,998
Today,

755
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,500
we hunt.

756
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:30,754
Another glorious, boring day.

757
00:44:35,842 --> 00:44:37,194
Air's gonna be on station.

758
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:40,055
We're gonna have all EOIR sensors on these guys as they move.

759
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:42,766
Flight, push tactical when airborne.

760
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:44,869
I want air ops locking down this transport.

761
00:44:44,893 --> 00:44:46,895
Decepticons in sight 100%.

762
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:49,564
Decepticons have just been given Yeager's location.

763
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:54,778
Cyclops.

764
00:44:54,861 --> 00:44:56,696
Decepticons approaching junkyard target.

765
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:01,534
You strapping on a Decepticon arm?

766
00:45:03,244 --> 00:45:04,579
Perfecto.

767
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,624
Well, he was an ugly little robot.

768
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:09,751
You look like a warrior, Sqweeks.

769
00:45:09,834 --> 00:45:11,194
Muy guapo.

770
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,254
Here goes, Bee.

771
00:45:13,421 --> 00:45:15,548
Just do whatever you want.

772
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:17,884
Hey, Z, come on over here and work on a real bot.

773
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:19,636
Doc, come in, Doc.

774
00:45:24,432 --> 00:45:25,433
Oh, that's it.

775
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:27,602
No, third one on your left.

776
00:45:28,144 --> 00:45:29,729
No. Wait. Your left. Right here.

777
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:32,565
I know what I'm doing. Don't rush me.

778
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:34,526
Hey, calm the temper, okay?

779
00:45:34,734 --> 00:45:35,944
Think he likes this?

780
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:38,029
It's like being in a dentist's chair.

781
00:45:38,196 --> 00:45:40,281
Do you like the dentist? No.

782
00:45:41,616 --> 00:45:43,743
Hound said you can only listen to her.

783
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,080
Your daughter. You can't talk back.

784
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:48,998
He's got a big mouth.

785
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:51,876
Said if you do, they can voice match you

786
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,337
from some computer somewhere and track you down.

787
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:56,506
Well, that's the world we live in.

788
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:00,841
What would you say to her?

789
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,639
Brush your teeth, work hard.

790
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:07,934
Stay away from any boy in a band, especially a drummer.

791
00:46:08,017 --> 00:46:10,729
Yeah, drummers are the worst, not to mention stupid!

792
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:12,522
And DJs? Real dickheads.

793
00:46:12,605 --> 00:46:14,065
Come on.

794
00:46:16,317 --> 00:46:18,486
We had a thing. All right? A saying, back and forth.

795
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:20,853
She'd always ask me, "Dad, what are you doing tomorrow?"

796
00:46:20,947 --> 00:46:23,158
And I'd say, "I'll figure it out tomorrow."

797
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:27,746
Looks to me like you're running out of tomorrows, Yeager.

798
00:46:29,205 --> 00:46:31,499
That's just what she'd say.

799
00:46:33,793 --> 00:46:34,794
Okay, Bee.

800
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:36,171
Done.

801
00:46:38,214 --> 00:46:40,091
Come on, buddy, sit up. Let's hear it.

802
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:41,509
Come on.

803
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:45,138
Your real voice. For the first time, buddy. Belt it out.

804
00:46:45,221 --> 00:46:46,765
This is so exciting.

805
00:46:46,848 --> 00:46:49,476
Oh, no. This isn't my damn voice.

806
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:50,977
I'm gonna kill him, Bee.

807
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,312
This is such bullshit.

808
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:53,664
Okay, you know what? I'm not giving up.

809
00:46:53,688 --> 00:46:55,291
All right? You're gonna speak with your own voice one day.

810
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:57,734
Daytrader is a punk-ass bitch.

811
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,578
Cade. Uh, that thingy... Uh, that code.

812
00:47:08,828 --> 00:47:10,789
It's a red thingy. There's somebody coming.

813
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:12,874
Shit!

814
00:47:17,587 --> 00:47:19,881
Reaper has eyes on junkyard.

815
00:47:20,715 --> 00:47:22,509
We have PID on Kingfish.

816
00:47:25,136 --> 00:47:27,388
Halt! This is protected land!

817
00:47:29,557 --> 00:47:31,434
Sixty seconds to evac! Let's move!

818
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:36,791
Cyclops, it appears Kingfish is on the move.

819
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:37,982
They know.

820
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:39,984
We're blown, guys! We gotta roll out now!

821
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:41,039
Hey, those are the Feds.

822
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:43,321
I know the government when I see the government.

823
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:45,573
Grab as many weapons as you can.

824
00:47:45,907 --> 00:47:47,867
I'm not going to jail. I can't go to jail, man.

825
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:49,754
Hey! This is the real world. Okay? Let's go!

826
00:47:49,911 --> 00:47:52,711
I can't go to jail. I'm too skinny for jail. I can't even lift weights.

827
00:47:57,293 --> 00:47:58,503
Bee, let's move!

828
00:47:58,586 --> 00:48:00,231
Give me this one. You definitely gimme this one.

829
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,857
This will mess somebody up good.

830
00:48:01,881 --> 00:48:03,901
Roll out of here, Cade. I'm gonna buy you some time.

831
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:05,725
Don't be a hero, Hound. We're out of here now!

832
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:07,846
- Wait! Wait! - Hell, I was born a hero.

833
00:48:07,929 --> 00:48:08,930
You're not leaving me!

834
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:10,682
You leave me, they take Sqweeks.

835
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:12,600
Leave Sqweeks! He's a survivor.

836
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,238
Megatron, they got up out of here.

837
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:27,907
I kicked more ass in prison.

838
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,287
The end is near, my old treacherous friend.

839
00:48:32,453 --> 00:48:33,556
Oh, she's coming!

840
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,458
What a shame you'll be unable to see it.

841
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:43,756
Come and get some, you little bitch!

842
00:48:58,313 --> 00:48:59,456
Coming your way, Lennox.

843
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,292
We box these things in, they will protect themselves.

844
00:49:01,316 --> 00:49:02,901
Yeah, we'll see.

845
00:49:06,779 --> 00:49:08,406
Tactical positions, let's go!

846
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:17,158
You, too, knuckle-dragger. Stay out of sight. Come on.

847
00:49:18,207 --> 00:49:20,001
Decepticons are coming.

848
00:49:20,084 --> 00:49:23,338
All right. We all know our hiding places.

849
00:49:23,421 --> 00:49:25,882
What's this? The tracker brought them right to us.

850
00:49:26,007 --> 00:49:28,009
- When are you going to grow up? - Dang it.

851
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:30,720
Target is four klicks away.

852
00:49:30,803 --> 00:49:32,722
They just entered an abandoned town.

853
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:54,869
Let's go. Out! Out! Out! Out!

854
00:50:07,048 --> 00:50:08,091
Hey!

855
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:10,426
Yeager's got vital intel. Detain only.

856
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:13,304
TRF operation. Stay out of my way.

857
00:50:13,388 --> 00:50:15,515
Those were my men.

858
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:18,559
Hey, there is some scary shit going on out there.

859
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:20,269
I'd like to at least keep my blaster.

860
00:50:20,353 --> 00:50:22,063
Not today. We're sticking to the plan.

861
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:23,856
The whole town is wired and rigged.

862
00:50:24,023 --> 00:50:26,442
You! Sit down. Now. Stay put.

863
00:50:43,334 --> 00:50:45,837
Just a heads up. We're probably going to jail,

864
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,256
so try getting used to that.

865
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:52,593
Here they come.

866
00:50:56,764 --> 00:50:58,099
Autobots, get ready.

867
00:50:58,266 --> 00:51:00,268
Hey, Cade, you mind if I bail?

868
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:01,894
Don't attack until I say.

869
00:51:03,104 --> 00:51:05,690
Aw, yeah, Decepticons is in the streets.

870
00:51:05,857 --> 00:51:08,276
- Oh, I feel a fight coming. - I'ma kill y'all right now.

871
00:51:08,484 --> 00:51:09,944
Search this town.

872
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:12,530
He's here.

873
00:51:12,613 --> 00:51:15,158
I'm letting y'all know what we came to do.

874
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:20,121
Get over here!

875
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:24,125
Look at that little blue beetle-looking mofo.

876
00:51:26,085 --> 00:51:27,688
Look at this little ugly dude.

877
00:51:27,712 --> 00:51:32,175
You are awash in their repulsive scent. Disgusting.

878
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:34,927
- Hey! - Bee, stop her.

879
00:51:35,094 --> 00:51:37,055
Put him down!

880
00:51:37,221 --> 00:51:38,264
No. No, no, no, no.

881
00:51:38,347 --> 00:51:40,892
Here she go. Look at her, walking all strong with pigtails.

882
00:51:40,975 --> 00:51:42,310
Go to hell!

883
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:44,187
This planet is hell.

884
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:46,773
Ooh, what's that on your arm?

885
00:51:46,939 --> 00:51:49,233
- Put him down! - Shit!

886
00:51:49,317 --> 00:51:50,985
You think I'm afraid of you, cabron?

887
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,071
- Hey, stop! - Cade Yeager.

888
00:51:53,154 --> 00:51:55,198
I need that talisman!

889
00:52:03,623 --> 00:52:05,333
We don't do this kamikaze shit.

890
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,436
You wanna go out there and start screaming at a Decepticon?

891
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,753
Get those vile beings.

892
00:52:08,836 --> 00:52:10,546
I'm on 'em!

893
00:52:25,561 --> 00:52:26,896
Freeze!

894
00:52:34,946 --> 00:52:36,697
I got the leg!

895
00:52:37,031 --> 00:52:38,324
Gotcha!

896
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,244
And his fat head.

897
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:42,954
Don't get any better than that.

898
00:52:43,204 --> 00:52:44,413
Drift, now!

899
00:52:44,914 --> 00:52:47,416
Decepticons, retreat!

900
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:48,543
Chickens!

901
00:52:50,878 --> 00:52:52,547
That plan went to shit.

902
00:52:56,425 --> 00:52:57,635
That's the only plan you got?

903
00:52:58,386 --> 00:52:59,720
Get down, get down, get down!

904
00:53:03,224 --> 00:53:05,268
- What are those? - TRF.

905
00:53:05,434 --> 00:53:08,437
- Whoa. - We gotta get inside. Come on. Run.

906
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:10,201
This is supposed to hunt terrorists,

907
00:53:10,273 --> 00:53:11,732
not tax-paying Americans!

908
00:53:11,816 --> 00:53:13,151
Not that I pay taxes, but...

909
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,237
Yo, Meg! M-tron!

910
00:53:16,529 --> 00:53:19,073
Stop playing. Come on. Am I the only one in here?

911
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,161
Ow!

912
00:53:23,911 --> 00:53:25,580
Oh, this ain't right.

913
00:53:32,503 --> 00:53:33,504
We're safe in here.

914
00:53:33,588 --> 00:53:35,107
There's always one in charge.

915
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:37,049
Just like back in Chicago, like a mother.

916
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:56,777
Go, go, go!

917
00:53:57,612 --> 00:53:58,779
Run!

918
00:53:58,946 --> 00:53:59,989
Move, move, move!

919
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:08,580
Hide in that room!

920
00:54:08,664 --> 00:54:10,104
Come on, come on, come on!

921
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:15,856
I left the 'hood to not get shot

922
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,215
and now I'm getting shot.

923
00:54:17,381 --> 00:54:19,217
This is the worst job ever.

924
00:54:19,383 --> 00:54:20,783
Does this job even have healthcare?

925
00:54:20,843 --> 00:54:22,136
It doesn't, do it?

926
00:54:22,303 --> 00:54:24,023
You try treating a bullet wound by yourself.

927
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,057
Watch out!

928
00:54:29,101 --> 00:54:30,269
Run! Run!

929
00:54:39,278 --> 00:54:40,696
Hide! Hide!

930
00:54:53,042 --> 00:54:54,962
Facial mapping engaged.

931
00:54:55,002 --> 00:54:56,170
You're a dead man.

932
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:13,020
Oh, shit. There's another one.

933
00:55:14,814 --> 00:55:17,400
- I got this. - What are you doing?

934
00:55:17,525 --> 00:55:18,943
It's using facial recognition.

935
00:55:20,194 --> 00:55:21,914
Are you crazy?

936
00:55:22,488 --> 00:55:23,614
- Stay behind me. - What?

937
00:55:23,823 --> 00:55:25,425
- Jimmy J, don't! - I got this. Get behind me.

938
00:55:25,449 --> 00:55:26,659
- Don't do it. - Get behind me.

939
00:55:26,742 --> 00:55:27,742
It's a bad idea!

940
00:55:27,785 --> 00:55:28,785
Oh!

941
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,413
Shit.

942
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,550
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

943
00:55:39,255 --> 00:55:42,216
Cade, I just want to tell you, I love you, man.

944
00:55:42,758 --> 00:55:43,759
What?

945
00:55:43,884 --> 00:55:45,862
This job wasn't what I thought, but I appreciate everything.

946
00:55:45,886 --> 00:55:47,888
- What are you doing? - I'm dying!

947
00:55:48,764 --> 00:55:49,890
It was only a beanbag, dude.

948
00:55:51,684 --> 00:55:52,727
There's no hole?

949
00:55:52,893 --> 00:55:54,371
There's no hole, there's no blood, no nothing.

950
00:55:54,395 --> 00:55:55,855
- There's no hole. - Will you get up?

951
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,207
Stop trying to act like a hero.

952
00:55:57,231 --> 00:55:59,817
It was a beanbag? That shit hurt like a bullet, man!

953
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:00,901
I felt it go through me!

954
00:56:01,485 --> 00:56:03,237
Come on, that building right there!

955
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:10,512
There's always one in charge!

956
00:56:10,536 --> 00:56:13,136
All right, we take out the big one, we're gonna take them all out.

957
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:18,836
Come on, come on, come on. Hurry, hurry, they're coming.

958
00:56:22,256 --> 00:56:24,717
- Oh, my God! A leprechaun. - Who the hell are you?

959
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:27,511
Leprechauns are tiny, green and Irish,

960
00:56:27,595 --> 00:56:29,013
and that is offensive.

961
00:56:29,096 --> 00:56:30,973
What are you looking at, little girl?

962
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,059
What are you looking at?

963
00:56:33,225 --> 00:56:36,187
Hello. Master Cade, I have been sent to collect you.

964
00:56:36,354 --> 00:56:37,581
- Collect me? - That is correct.

965
00:56:37,605 --> 00:56:38,939
Oh, you're not collecting shit.

966
00:56:43,277 --> 00:56:45,696
- Whoa, man! Slow down! - So, you want to play rough.

967
00:56:51,035 --> 00:56:52,355
- Oh! Oh! - No! No! Cade!

968
00:56:52,995 --> 00:56:54,121
Oh, shit!

969
00:56:54,663 --> 00:56:56,165
- Cade! Cade! - Hold on!

970
00:57:01,295 --> 00:57:02,615
Did you see that? Hang on!

971
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:04,423
Oh, I am so clumsy!

972
00:57:04,632 --> 00:57:06,384
- Is he still alive? - Hold on!

973
00:57:06,467 --> 00:57:07,968
Is he still living?

974
00:57:08,177 --> 00:57:09,970
No, he's going to die!

975
00:57:14,517 --> 00:57:15,851
My lord, this is not my fault,

976
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:17,478
but he just burst out of the elevator.

977
00:57:17,978 --> 00:57:18,979
Ten stories.

978
00:57:19,063 --> 00:57:20,064
Oh, my God.

979
00:57:20,147 --> 00:57:21,458
Did you have a backup plan, sir?

980
00:57:21,482 --> 00:57:23,818
- Did he live? - I don't know! He just flew!

981
00:57:36,288 --> 00:57:38,082
My lord, rip an arm off a human

982
00:57:38,165 --> 00:57:39,476
and they'll go wherever you want.

983
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,644
What's the matter with you?

984
00:58:02,648 --> 00:58:04,984
Whoa!

985
00:58:17,288 --> 00:58:18,622
Eh, you little gnats.

986
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:22,042
Oh, there you are. Good to find you alive!

987
00:58:22,168 --> 00:58:23,752
Just like nothing happened.

988
00:58:23,878 --> 00:58:26,380
- Let's make you presentable. - Hey! Come on!

989
00:58:26,547 --> 00:58:28,215
Shiny, spic and span.

990
00:58:28,382 --> 00:58:29,550
- Back off, Jeeves! - There.

991
00:58:29,717 --> 00:58:31,635
- You look better already, sir. - Who are you?

992
00:58:31,802 --> 00:58:34,805
My name is Cogman, sir. And I am here because of that.

993
00:58:35,014 --> 00:58:37,391
And that is here because of you.

994
00:58:37,725 --> 00:58:41,270
It will not leave you until your quest is fulfilled.

995
00:58:42,646 --> 00:58:44,732
You have been chosen.

996
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:47,443
What do you mean, "chosen"?

997
00:58:47,526 --> 00:58:49,778
I will explain everything if you'll kindly come with me.

998
00:58:49,945 --> 00:58:52,323
Eh, Cade, what's with this C-3PO rip-off?

999
00:58:52,406 --> 00:58:53,657
Don't kill the messenger

1000
00:58:53,741 --> 00:58:55,743
or the messenger will kill you.

1001
00:58:57,661 --> 00:58:59,330
Ouch!

1002
00:58:59,997 --> 00:59:02,583
Now then, I'm afraid all this ballyhoo is on your account.

1003
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:06,045
If you want to save your friends, you will leave them.

1004
00:59:06,212 --> 00:59:07,397
Hey, don't talk to that leprechaun!

1005
00:59:07,421 --> 00:59:09,261
What, and run off with some crazy ninja butler?

1006
00:59:09,423 --> 00:59:11,425
Your friends will be safe in your absence.

1007
00:59:11,592 --> 00:59:13,928
In your presence, unsafe.

1008
00:59:14,053 --> 00:59:17,932
You are more important than you can possibly imagine.

1009
00:59:18,432 --> 00:59:20,434
You are needed, sir.

1010
00:59:20,768 --> 00:59:21,769
Urgently.

1011
00:59:22,436 --> 00:59:24,230
My master is fond of saying

1012
00:59:24,396 --> 00:59:26,023
that all the important decisions in life

1013
00:59:26,106 --> 00:59:30,444
often come down to just one moment.

1014
00:59:39,286 --> 00:59:41,705
You're gonna be all right. You're family now.

1015
00:59:41,789 --> 00:59:43,958
They're gonna take care of you, I promise.

1016
00:59:44,124 --> 00:59:46,585
The plane is waiting. We are going to England.

1017
00:59:46,794 --> 00:59:47,795
Bee?

1018
00:59:49,129 --> 00:59:52,591
Listen up, Little Miss Sunshine, I'm in charge now.

1019
00:59:53,259 --> 00:59:56,178
Just don't expect any bedtime stories.

1020
01:00:03,852 --> 01:00:05,121
Welcome to Air Folgan.

1021
01:00:05,145 --> 01:00:07,189
Please strap in. Turbulence can kill.

1022
01:00:07,356 --> 01:00:09,156
There will be no snack service on this flight,

1023
01:00:09,191 --> 01:00:10,818
no drinks, no fun.

1024
01:00:10,985 --> 01:00:13,654
Tracking Yeager. He's over the pond right now.

1025
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:16,031
It took some finding, but sats have him.

1026
01:00:16,198 --> 01:00:17,958
Megatron and crew are bearing down on the UK.

1027
01:00:17,992 --> 01:00:20,411
So is Yeager. It's no coincidence.

1028
01:00:21,161 --> 01:00:24,832
I want you airborne with your team to the UK ASAP.

1029
01:00:28,502 --> 01:00:30,421
Pick up. Pick up.

1030
01:00:30,629 --> 01:00:32,506
Yeah?

1031
01:00:32,673 --> 01:00:33,984
- Don't hang up! - Ah, it's you again.

1032
01:00:34,008 --> 01:00:36,510
I've told you, you have nothing to offer. Get lost.

1033
01:00:36,677 --> 01:00:39,138
I need a favor, Folgers. I'd do it myself, but I can't.

1034
01:00:39,221 --> 01:00:40,365
You ever fly a Cuban airplane?

1035
01:00:40,389 --> 01:00:42,433
They're from the 1940s. So are the pilots.

1036
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,143
Book of Cyber-Kells.

1037
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,729
- I found it. - The ancient book? Impossible.

1038
01:00:46,812 --> 01:00:49,106
Not when you know the right janitor. And I know many.

1039
01:00:49,273 --> 01:00:51,525
The book exists. Unseen for centuries.

1040
01:00:51,734 --> 01:00:54,278
Pages that literally dissolve at room temperature,

1041
01:00:54,361 --> 01:00:57,781
made from some old kind of goat scrotum or something.

1042
01:00:57,865 --> 01:01:00,492
Trinity Library. Today, 4:00 p.m.

1043
01:01:00,576 --> 01:01:02,661
Be there if you want to know how it all ends.

1044
01:01:08,876 --> 01:01:12,880
Object confirmed as exoplanet Cybertron.

1045
01:01:13,797 --> 01:01:16,759
Two days, seven hours to impact.

1046
01:01:21,722 --> 01:01:24,850
Optimus, it is time you knew the truth.

1047
01:01:25,392 --> 01:01:26,935
The place you call Earth

1048
01:01:27,728 --> 01:01:31,065
has another name. Unicron.

1049
01:01:32,274 --> 01:01:34,902
Earth... Unicron?

1050
01:01:35,569 --> 01:01:38,739
Cybertron's ancient enemy.

1051
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:40,574
Yes.

1052
01:01:40,783 --> 01:01:42,868
You are going to kill him.

1053
01:01:43,452 --> 01:01:47,539
With my staff, we will drain the very life from Unicron.

1054
01:01:48,207 --> 01:01:51,210
- Earth will die... - Yes.

1055
01:01:51,293 --> 01:01:54,088
And your world will be reborn,

1056
01:01:54,254 --> 01:01:56,632
Nemesis Prime.

1057
01:01:57,966 --> 01:02:02,721
I will fight anyone who stands in my way.

1058
01:02:04,682 --> 01:02:06,326
The alien horns are still growing,

1059
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,852
some of them reaching 400 meters.

1060
01:02:08,936 --> 01:02:11,563
More alien rubbish.

1061
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,732
Have you found a man yet, Viviane?

1062
01:02:13,899 --> 01:02:15,609
- No. - So sad.

1063
01:02:15,776 --> 01:02:17,016
You should really look in here.

1064
01:02:17,069 --> 01:02:19,947
I mean, there are lots of adverts, some of them very tempting.

1065
01:02:20,114 --> 01:02:22,616
This one's looking for a BBW. I don't know what that is.

1066
01:02:22,783 --> 01:02:24,118
- It's a car, dear. - Right.

1067
01:02:24,284 --> 01:02:25,452
Big Beautiful Woman.

1068
01:02:25,661 --> 01:02:27,246
Is it? Who knew?

1069
01:02:27,413 --> 01:02:29,081
Looking at the classifieds!

1070
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:31,291
Oh, this one's got its own dungeon.

1071
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:33,627
Great! I love dungeons!

1072
01:02:33,794 --> 01:02:35,587
See, that's perfect for you, isn't it?

1073
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:37,464
All that old stuff, you'd love that.

1074
01:02:37,631 --> 01:02:39,991
History is being rewritten and you want to talk about a man.

1075
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:41,301
Or a woman.

1076
01:02:41,468 --> 01:02:42,803
Aunt Helen.

1077
01:02:43,011 --> 01:02:44,388
"Women Seeking Women." Here we go.

1078
01:02:45,973 --> 01:02:47,725
You could ask me about my work.

1079
01:02:47,933 --> 01:02:49,226
Why would we do that?

1080
01:02:49,309 --> 01:02:51,729
I mean, it's just dusty old books.

1081
01:02:51,895 --> 01:02:53,397
Now I welcome the end of days!

1082
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,916
What's so terrible about me wanting you

1083
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,734
to have what I had with your father?

1084
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,110
He was an ass.

1085
01:02:58,277 --> 01:02:59,796
Do you know what Father didn't have?

1086
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,965
The one thing that his beloved Knights of the Round Table

1087
01:03:01,989 --> 01:03:03,991
had in spades and he was utterly lacking?

1088
01:03:04,867 --> 01:03:05,868
Honor.

1089
01:03:05,951 --> 01:03:07,494
You can say that again.

1090
01:03:07,578 --> 01:03:10,456
If you can stop loathing a dead man long enough,

1091
01:03:10,539 --> 01:03:12,058
you might want to have a look in his study.

1092
01:03:12,082 --> 01:03:13,167
All that rubbish.

1093
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:14,973
There might be something you want to keep.

1094
01:03:39,693 --> 01:03:41,403
Do not touch that!

1095
01:03:42,362 --> 01:03:43,947
Sorry, Daddy.

1096
01:03:46,325 --> 01:03:47,534
I don't want anything.

1097
01:03:47,618 --> 01:03:49,453
Tell the university to take the lot.

1098
01:03:58,587 --> 01:04:00,130
"The 12th Earl of Folgan

1099
01:04:00,297 --> 01:04:02,382
"urgently requests your presence at High Tea

1100
01:04:02,549 --> 01:04:03,550
"this very moment."

1101
01:04:11,517 --> 01:04:12,726
Uh... Stop!

1102
01:04:20,734 --> 01:04:22,402
Move! Move!

1103
01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:24,530
God! Sorry!

1104
01:04:26,824 --> 01:04:28,116
Okay, okay.

1105
01:04:33,038 --> 01:04:34,808
Oh, please, mademoiselle, don't do that.

1106
01:04:34,832 --> 01:04:36,667
- What? - Je m'appelle Hot Rod.

1107
01:04:36,834 --> 01:04:38,502
Christ alive, you're one of them!

1108
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:41,004
Back! Be quiet! Do not hit me again!

1109
01:04:49,179 --> 01:04:51,014
So, which bloody bot are you, then?

1110
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:53,016
Soundwave? Shockwave?

1111
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:56,270
At least tell me that I've been abducted by one of the famous ones.

1112
01:04:56,436 --> 01:04:58,438
I am so much better than all of them!

1113
01:04:58,522 --> 01:05:00,190
Oh! Help! I'm being kidnapped!

1114
01:05:00,274 --> 01:05:02,609
Mademoiselle, sit down!

1115
01:05:03,777 --> 01:05:05,320
Oh, help! Yes, yes, hello!

1116
01:05:05,529 --> 01:05:06,905
Hello, Lamborghini!

1117
01:05:07,614 --> 01:05:09,241
Would you help?

1118
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,180
Sorry, I've just been kidnap... Nuts!

1119
01:05:17,124 --> 01:05:19,251
Wow!

1120
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,660
Wow, I love this car!

1121
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:39,479
Ah, the White Cliffs of Dover.

1122
01:05:50,824 --> 01:05:53,118
That's a good girl. Good girl.

1123
01:05:58,165 --> 01:06:01,168
Good girl. Come on. There's a good girl.

1124
01:06:19,686 --> 01:06:20,938
We have guests!

1125
01:06:21,146 --> 01:06:22,790
What's the matter with you?

1126
01:06:22,814 --> 01:06:24,650
Oh, shit! My bits are falling off.

1127
01:06:24,816 --> 01:06:25,859
Idiot!

1128
01:06:26,526 --> 01:06:28,362
Hello there!

1129
01:06:28,862 --> 01:06:30,697
What the hell?

1130
01:06:31,782 --> 01:06:32,783
Good girl.

1131
01:06:32,866 --> 01:06:33,885
Master, he's a complete knucklehead.

1132
01:06:33,909 --> 01:06:36,536
I'm awfully sorry about that, but, um, you see,

1133
01:06:36,912 --> 01:06:41,166
he thinks it's still the year 1918 or 1914. Something like that.

1134
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:42,333
So sad.

1135
01:06:42,376 --> 01:06:43,961
World War I and all that stuff.

1136
01:06:44,753 --> 01:06:46,689
I mean... Battle of the Marne, Battle of the Somme,

1137
01:06:46,713 --> 01:06:48,358
Battle of the Marne, Battle of Passchendaele.

1138
01:06:48,382 --> 01:06:50,801
Trenches and mud and death

1139
01:06:50,968 --> 01:06:52,678
and gore and all that. It's terribly sad.

1140
01:06:52,844 --> 01:06:55,222
"It's a long way to Tipperary, it's a long way to go."

1141
01:06:55,389 --> 01:06:57,766
Yeah, but it's, um... It's terrible!

1142
01:06:57,933 --> 01:07:00,602
I mean, so sad, you know? But then, I mean...

1143
01:07:00,811 --> 01:07:03,397
Isn't it? I mean, this late onset of, um, well...

1144
01:07:04,398 --> 01:07:06,024
Robot dementia.

1145
01:07:06,191 --> 01:07:07,734
It's not at all pretty.

1146
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:11,738
Ah, I don't know what you're smoking in that pipe, man, but...

1147
01:07:11,947 --> 01:07:13,699
What's going on here?

1148
01:07:13,782 --> 01:07:14,783
Did you drag me to some.

1149
01:07:14,866 --> 01:07:16,052
- Transformer retirement home? - Mmm-hmm.

1150
01:07:16,076 --> 01:07:18,054
Look, somebody better start talking, or I'm outta here.

1151
01:07:18,078 --> 01:07:19,663
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

1152
01:07:19,746 --> 01:07:20,747
Um, Bumblebee?

1153
01:07:21,248 --> 01:07:23,101
We only met when I was a little boy in short pants.

1154
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:24,376
I must have been that tall.

1155
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:27,087
Maybe taller. Or maybe shorter, I can't remember.

1156
01:07:27,254 --> 01:07:28,254
But never forget a face.

1157
01:07:28,296 --> 01:07:29,589
Bee, you know this guy?

1158
01:07:29,756 --> 01:07:31,800
- I don't... with you. - Oh, yes.

1159
01:07:31,883 --> 01:07:33,468
Let's have a look at this thing.

1160
01:07:33,552 --> 01:07:35,095
Please. Very interesting.

1161
01:07:36,263 --> 01:07:37,305
Yes.

1162
01:07:38,682 --> 01:07:41,768
You keep a secret for so long, knowing it to be true,

1163
01:07:41,935 --> 01:07:43,687
and yet, deep down inside,

1164
01:07:44,229 --> 01:07:46,106
you begin to wonder,

1165
01:07:46,773 --> 01:07:48,900
"Has my life been wasted?"

1166
01:07:49,735 --> 01:07:51,778
Have you ever felt like that, Mr. Cade?

1167
01:07:53,822 --> 01:07:55,323
It's just Cade.

1168
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:58,251
Look, old timer, I don't have a ton of patience for riddles right now.

1169
01:07:58,869 --> 01:08:01,496
Yes, but you want to know, don't you, "dude,"

1170
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:03,957
why they keep coming here.

1171
01:08:04,708 --> 01:08:07,419
To Earth. Right?

1172
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:13,175
Ah! I do so love perfect timing.

1173
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:18,263
What a bitchin' car she is!

1174
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:28,291
No, no, no, little lady.

1175
01:08:28,315 --> 01:08:30,776
Why do you have to be like that? Pourquoi?

1176
01:08:32,652 --> 01:08:34,446
So, is this a kidnapping sort of situation

1177
01:08:34,529 --> 01:08:36,656
or her first Transformer experience?

1178
01:08:36,823 --> 01:08:37,824
It's both, really.

1179
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:39,826
Do not hit me again!

1180
01:08:39,993 --> 01:08:43,580
But she does have a rather nice fight-or-flight response.

1181
01:08:44,331 --> 01:08:46,833
She's very difficult.

1182
01:08:48,335 --> 01:08:51,004
My name is Edmond Burton, 12th Earl of Folgan.

1183
01:08:51,129 --> 01:08:54,216
Last surviving member of the Order of the Witwiccans.

1184
01:08:54,466 --> 01:08:55,967
Wow.

1185
01:08:56,468 --> 01:08:57,469
What's up?

1186
01:09:04,559 --> 01:09:06,228
Does he have to loom like that?

1187
01:09:10,690 --> 01:09:11,733
"Ut" what?

1188
01:09:13,193 --> 01:09:14,193
"Ut rut"?

1189
01:09:15,403 --> 01:09:17,239
- Hot Rod. - Mmm-hmm.

1190
01:09:17,364 --> 01:09:18,365
It's his French accent.

1191
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:19,741
Is he French?

1192
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:21,493
No, he just likes the accent.

1193
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:24,955
No, no, no! I hate the accent! But I can't get rid of it.

1194
01:09:25,038 --> 01:09:26,957
I'm stuck with the accent. Ugh.

1195
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,375
He's a soldier, Miss Viviane.

1196
01:09:28,542 --> 01:09:31,419
He swore an oath to your father to protect you.

1197
01:09:31,503 --> 01:09:33,713
- Huh. - Some dad you got there.

1198
01:09:34,214 --> 01:09:35,691
That is a nice ride. I mean, you can roll right up

1199
01:09:35,715 --> 01:09:36,859
to Buckingham Palace in that thing.

1200
01:09:36,883 --> 01:09:39,344
Okay, you, American man, shut it.

1201
01:09:41,012 --> 01:09:42,055
What am I doing here?

1202
01:09:42,222 --> 01:09:44,474
- Yeah, why is she here? - Introductions.

1203
01:09:45,559 --> 01:09:47,370
Miss Viviane Wembly. Master of History, Oxford.

1204
01:09:47,394 --> 01:09:49,062
Doctor of Philosophy, also Oxford.

1205
01:09:49,229 --> 01:09:51,982
And Doctor of Letters, again Oxford, I think. Anything else?

1206
01:09:52,065 --> 01:09:53,608
Anyway, meet Cade.

1207
01:09:54,401 --> 01:09:55,402
Yeager.

1208
01:09:56,069 --> 01:09:57,863
Cade Yeager. I'm an inventor.

1209
01:09:58,029 --> 01:09:59,406
Oh, you're an inventor.

1210
01:09:59,573 --> 01:10:01,241
- Yes, I am. - What have you invented?

1211
01:10:01,408 --> 01:10:03,326
- A lot of things. - Like?

1212
01:10:04,244 --> 01:10:05,912
Like a lot of things. Like...

1213
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,914
- Things that you've heard of. - Like?

1214
01:10:08,081 --> 01:10:09,392
Well, things that you will have heard of, okay?

1215
01:10:09,416 --> 01:10:10,542
Patents are pending.

1216
01:10:12,043 --> 01:10:13,086
Ah.

1217
01:10:13,587 --> 01:10:14,754
"Ah"?

1218
01:10:15,172 --> 01:10:16,756
Don't say that. What's "ah"?

1219
01:10:16,923 --> 01:10:18,401
You know, I could do that, too. "Oh, I'm English,

1220
01:10:18,425 --> 01:10:19,705
"and I'm too cool for feelings."

1221
01:10:19,759 --> 01:10:21,261
What, I've come here to be insulted

1222
01:10:21,428 --> 01:10:24,222
by some over-educated ivory-tower princess in a stripper dress?

1223
01:10:24,639 --> 01:10:25,640
Stripper?

1224
01:10:25,807 --> 01:10:28,518
Well, only in America is a finer education an insult.

1225
01:10:28,685 --> 01:10:30,445
And if my dress makes you feel uncomfortable,

1226
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,022
then maybe I could take it off.

1227
01:10:32,731 --> 01:10:33,773
Okay.

1228
01:10:33,982 --> 01:10:35,942
That's enough!

1229
01:10:36,735 --> 01:10:38,778
- What's your problem? - No, no, no!

1230
01:10:39,487 --> 01:10:40,488
Cogman?

1231
01:10:41,406 --> 01:10:43,033
Shall I take his head off, madam?

1232
01:10:43,116 --> 01:10:46,411
Tempting, but, um, I can defend my own honor.

1233
01:10:46,578 --> 01:10:49,956
But I do so very much want to crush his windpipe.

1234
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:53,710
Control, Cogman. You must learn to control that impulse.

1235
01:10:53,793 --> 01:10:55,837
Channel it into other things.

1236
01:10:56,796 --> 01:10:58,131
Yes, my lord.

1237
01:10:58,465 --> 01:11:01,927
Like making beds or cooking food.

1238
01:11:02,469 --> 01:11:06,806
Polishing the silver. I am trying, my lord.

1239
01:11:06,973 --> 01:11:09,768
He is a "Headmaster." A very rare breed.

1240
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:11,728
That dude is disturbed, yeah?

1241
01:11:11,811 --> 01:11:14,147
Like, seriously evil. Like, split personality.

1242
01:11:14,481 --> 01:11:15,482
Good.

1243
01:11:16,233 --> 01:11:20,070
Cogman? Glass 17C is missing. Did you break it?

1244
01:11:20,278 --> 01:11:22,656
I've been a butler for the aristocracy for 700 years.

1245
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:25,075
You are the worst I've ever worked for!

1246
01:11:25,408 --> 01:11:26,886
Ah, these were all my predecessors.

1247
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:29,454
They're all Folgans. And that was my aunt there.

1248
01:11:29,621 --> 01:11:31,248
My great-great-great-great aunt.

1249
01:11:31,414 --> 01:11:33,142
She poisoned my great-great-great uncle for some reason.

1250
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:35,043
She was barking mad, she was an absolute bitch.

1251
01:11:35,126 --> 01:11:37,337
There's my grandfather over there, Aloysius.

1252
01:11:37,504 --> 01:11:39,130
And that's Arnold, my third cousin.

1253
01:11:39,297 --> 01:11:41,675
He drunk sewage water, committed suicide. He was quite mad.

1254
01:11:41,841 --> 01:11:43,593
They were all mad, really.

1255
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,053
There's bullet holes.

1256
01:11:47,013 --> 01:11:49,015
Uh-uh. No, no. Nasty critter.

1257
01:11:49,182 --> 01:11:50,850
No, no, no, no, no.

1258
01:11:51,476 --> 01:11:54,145
That's the watch that killed Hitler. Don't screw with it.

1259
01:11:55,188 --> 01:11:57,941
These are all the Witwiccans.

1260
01:11:58,149 --> 01:12:00,068
In our halcyon days we were quite the club.

1261
01:12:00,151 --> 01:12:03,363
Brilliant minds, explorers, scientists, artists, world leaders.

1262
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:04,823
Renaissance thrill seekers.

1263
01:12:04,906 --> 01:12:07,066
People like Catherine the Great, Empress of all Russia,

1264
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,594
General Washington, William Shakespeare,

1265
01:12:08,618 --> 01:12:09,506
Queen Elizabeth of England,

1266
01:12:09,536 --> 01:12:10,680
Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass,

1267
01:12:10,704 --> 01:12:12,144
Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers,

1268
01:12:12,289 --> 01:12:14,141
Giotto, Michelangelo, Darwin, Churchill, Einstein,

1269
01:12:14,165 --> 01:12:16,501
Stephen Hawking, Henry V, Leonardo da Vinci,

1270
01:12:16,668 --> 01:12:18,548
Newton, de Lavoisier, Mozart, Beethoven, Mahler,

1271
01:12:18,712 --> 01:12:21,172
Edmund Hillary, Teddy Roosevelt, Copernicus,

1272
01:12:21,339 --> 01:12:23,174
Tesla, Galileo.

1273
01:12:23,341 --> 01:12:25,468
They all belonged to a secret society, you see.

1274
01:12:25,635 --> 01:12:26,886
All united in one cause.

1275
01:12:27,053 --> 01:12:30,056
To protect the secret history of Transformers.

1276
01:12:30,807 --> 01:12:33,059
Here. On Earth.

1277
01:12:33,893 --> 01:12:36,104
Now, this is the Witwiccan family tree.

1278
01:12:36,813 --> 01:12:38,857
Merlin, Viviana.

1279
01:12:39,024 --> 01:12:41,026
Goes back 40 generations.

1280
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:43,653
Go over to that desk. There's a photograph there.

1281
01:12:43,737 --> 01:12:45,739
Your father was a member.

1282
01:12:46,448 --> 01:12:48,742
He very much wanted to tell you that.

1283
01:12:50,577 --> 01:12:52,954
And my own family had some...

1284
01:12:55,623 --> 01:12:57,625
Small part in all this.

1285
01:12:58,752 --> 01:13:00,170
ZB-7.

1286
01:13:00,295 --> 01:13:01,629
That looks just like Bee.

1287
01:13:01,713 --> 01:13:04,257
It is. He was attached to the Devil's Brigade.

1288
01:13:04,341 --> 01:13:06,426
Pretty vicious military unit.

1289
01:13:06,634 --> 01:13:08,595
Helped turn the tide of war, you know?

1290
01:13:19,856 --> 01:13:21,191
We're not invited.

1291
01:13:49,803 --> 01:13:50,929
- Bee? - Yeah.

1292
01:13:51,012 --> 01:13:52,013
But he's so nice.

1293
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,515
Behind the lines, during the war,

1294
01:13:53,598 --> 01:13:55,308
they called him many things.

1295
01:13:55,392 --> 01:13:57,435
"Nice" was never one of them.

1296
01:13:57,977 --> 01:14:00,105
It all began in 484 AD,

1297
01:14:00,188 --> 01:14:03,108
when King Arthur and his wizard, Merlin,

1298
01:14:03,316 --> 01:14:06,403
stared down and vanquished the Saxon hordes at Mount Badon.

1299
01:14:06,486 --> 01:14:09,114
That's his sword and his mace there.

1300
01:14:09,697 --> 01:14:10,990
It's a myth.

1301
01:14:11,157 --> 01:14:12,635
Yeah, every legend, every myth,

1302
01:14:12,659 --> 01:14:15,120
every story whispered around the campfire

1303
01:14:15,286 --> 01:14:16,830
has a logical explanation.

1304
01:14:16,913 --> 01:14:18,641
Oh, with that I agree wholeheartedly,

1305
01:14:18,665 --> 01:14:19,945
but logic has left the building.

1306
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:21,543
You're talking about magic.

1307
01:14:21,709 --> 01:14:24,045
What, like your walking, talking Lamborghini?

1308
01:14:24,212 --> 01:14:25,755
"Any sufficiently advanced technology

1309
01:14:25,839 --> 01:14:27,382
"is indistinguishable from magic."

1310
01:14:27,549 --> 01:14:29,426
Arthur C. Clarke. Impressive.

1311
01:14:29,592 --> 01:14:31,636
Yeah. And count 'em, zero student loans,

1312
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:34,514
Doctor, or Professor, Philosopher, whatever you call yourself.

1313
01:14:35,056 --> 01:14:37,016
It's all of the above.

1314
01:14:42,188 --> 01:14:43,606
Now, this place was built

1315
01:14:44,691 --> 01:14:47,193
around the original Round Table.

1316
01:14:47,277 --> 01:14:50,822
Percival, Gawain, Tristan, Lancelot.

1317
01:14:54,576 --> 01:14:56,411
They sat right here.

1318
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,373
Twelve in all.

1319
01:15:01,082 --> 01:15:05,211
And behind them sat the 12 who came from Cybertron.

1320
01:15:10,884 --> 01:15:12,594
We fight for honor.

1321
01:15:13,553 --> 01:15:15,930
We fight for the human race.

1322
01:15:16,014 --> 01:15:18,099
For all that is good in mankind.

1323
01:15:18,725 --> 01:15:21,644
To brothers old and brothers new!

1324
01:15:22,145 --> 01:15:25,273
To brothers old and brothers new!

1325
01:15:33,281 --> 01:15:36,451
No sacrifice, no victory!

1326
01:15:36,784 --> 01:15:40,205
Twelve alien knights who saw in Camelot

1327
01:15:40,288 --> 01:15:42,874
what the human race could be at its finest.

1328
01:15:43,374 --> 01:15:44,751
A race of honor.

1329
01:15:54,928 --> 01:15:55,929
- Cogman? - Hmm?

1330
01:15:56,137 --> 01:15:58,223
You ruined the moment again!

1331
01:15:58,431 --> 01:16:00,934
I was making the moment more epic.

1332
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,352
Just be quiet.

1333
01:16:02,519 --> 01:16:04,187
What's the matter with you?

1334
01:16:04,354 --> 01:16:06,074
If I could find his neck, I'd strangle him.

1335
01:16:06,773 --> 01:16:09,025
This belonged to King Arthur himself.

1336
01:16:10,193 --> 01:16:13,446
Now, legend held that one last knight would someday be chosen

1337
01:16:14,113 --> 01:16:16,824
and the struggle to save the world would begin.

1338
01:16:17,033 --> 01:16:19,077
It would appear, Mr. Cade,

1339
01:16:19,994 --> 01:16:22,705
that that last knight is you.

1340
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:26,292
What?

1341
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:28,604
You're saying he traveled the whole universe to find me?

1342
01:16:28,628 --> 01:16:30,356
No, not you specifically.

1343
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:32,820
Not a failed inventor from the state of Texas. No, God forbid.

1344
01:16:34,634 --> 01:16:35,634
Stop it!

1345
01:16:36,135 --> 01:16:37,720
What?

1346
01:16:38,638 --> 01:16:40,032
You know, if you don't stop it,

1347
01:16:40,056 --> 01:16:42,684
I will send you back to Cybertron in a little tiny box.

1348
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:43,780
Oh, scary.

1349
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:45,353
I am not a failed inventor.

1350
01:16:45,436 --> 01:16:48,481
No, he meant the qualities of a knight, Mr. Cade.

1351
01:16:49,315 --> 01:16:51,651
Miss Viviane, the qualities of a knight, if you please?

1352
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,712
Qualities of a knight, purity of heart,

1353
01:16:53,736 --> 01:16:55,989
valor, honor, virtue, integrity.

1354
01:16:56,155 --> 01:16:57,155
I have those.

1355
01:16:57,198 --> 01:16:58,384
Oh, and most importantly...

1356
01:16:58,408 --> 01:17:00,451
- Is he chaste? - Chased?

1357
01:17:00,618 --> 01:17:02,304
Dude, I was getting chased when your little weirdo buddy

1358
01:17:02,328 --> 01:17:03,688
brought me over here on the plane.

1359
01:17:04,038 --> 01:17:05,039
"Chaste."

1360
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:06,666
C-H-A-S-T-E.

1361
01:17:06,874 --> 01:17:07,917
"T."

1362
01:17:08,126 --> 01:17:09,126
Celibate?

1363
01:17:09,168 --> 01:17:10,608
Yeah, I know... I was making a joke.

1364
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:12,106
You don't think I know how to spell?

1365
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:13,881
- I know what he meant. - Sure you were.

1366
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:15,592
No whoopee, Mr. Cade?

1367
01:17:16,718 --> 01:17:18,303
It's been a while.

1368
01:17:18,469 --> 01:17:21,139
Well, how long's "a while"? A week? A month? A year?

1369
01:17:21,306 --> 01:17:22,682
None of your business.

1370
01:17:22,849 --> 01:17:24,369
Well, we need to ask you the question.

1371
01:17:25,268 --> 01:17:26,269
A while!

1372
01:17:26,436 --> 01:17:27,645
- Huh. - Hmm.

1373
01:17:28,396 --> 01:17:29,397
"Huh"? What is this?

1374
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:30,624
Is that, like, another English thing?

1375
01:17:30,648 --> 01:17:32,984
No, no. Just a curious thing.

1376
01:17:33,151 --> 01:17:34,360
Well, maybe I'm saving myself.

1377
01:17:34,527 --> 01:17:36,195
What are you saving yourself for, old age?

1378
01:17:36,362 --> 01:17:37,739
You, English lady, shut it.

1379
01:17:40,074 --> 01:17:42,327
What is this? Some sort of a map?

1380
01:17:42,869 --> 01:17:44,469
Oh, this table is from Cybertron.

1381
01:17:44,537 --> 01:17:47,624
It's a puzzle I've been working on for some time.

1382
01:17:47,707 --> 01:17:48,791
My entire life, actually.

1383
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,669
And what do these glyphs say about it?

1384
01:17:51,836 --> 01:17:53,196
They're Olde Cybertronian.

1385
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,716
A mantra whispered through the cosmos.

1386
01:17:57,675 --> 01:17:59,302
"Seglass Ni Tonday."

1387
01:17:59,802 --> 01:18:01,346
Wait a minute.

1388
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:02,889
I heard that before.

1389
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:07,060
A knight on a ship. What does it mean?

1390
01:18:07,226 --> 01:18:10,104
"With your dying breath, protect the staff."

1391
01:18:11,356 --> 01:18:13,274
Okay, this is ridiculous.

1392
01:18:18,905 --> 01:18:20,073
They had their name for it.

1393
01:18:20,782 --> 01:18:22,033
We have ours.

1394
01:18:22,867 --> 01:18:24,327
The staff of Merlin.

1395
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:28,831
Bequeathed to him by an alien race. Fused with his DNA.

1396
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:32,627
So that only he would have the key to unlock its alien power.

1397
01:18:33,753 --> 01:18:36,047
Or as they knew it in those days,

1398
01:18:36,589 --> 01:18:37,924
magic.

1399
01:18:40,051 --> 01:18:43,513
The staff was buried with Merlin's body.

1400
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,057
A thousand years we've kept it hidden.

1401
01:18:46,599 --> 01:18:49,018
If it ever fell into the wrong hands, it would mean

1402
01:18:49,227 --> 01:18:53,523
the imminent destruction of everything we know and love.

1403
01:18:53,773 --> 01:18:57,860
The 12 Guardian Knights combined into a mighty dragon to protect it.

1404
01:18:57,944 --> 01:19:00,113
And now it is in great danger.

1405
01:19:00,279 --> 01:19:02,824
Megatron. He was after this.

1406
01:19:02,907 --> 01:19:04,492
So the battle is upon us.

1407
01:19:04,617 --> 01:19:06,428
It is why they're here, why they keep coming to Earth.

1408
01:19:06,452 --> 01:19:08,996
And we must claim the staff before it is too late.

1409
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,623
Wait. We what?

1410
01:19:10,707 --> 01:19:13,751
Only a direct descendant of Merlin himself

1411
01:19:14,293 --> 01:19:17,296
can wield this instrument of absolute power.

1412
01:19:17,922 --> 01:19:20,383
And you, Miss Viviane,

1413
01:19:20,466 --> 01:19:23,594
are Merlin's last descendant here on Earth, and as such,

1414
01:19:23,761 --> 01:19:25,596
you are our last hope.

1415
01:19:25,763 --> 01:19:27,348
Okay, wait. Go back.

1416
01:19:27,432 --> 01:19:29,851
You're saying that I'm related to the wizard Merlin?

1417
01:19:33,479 --> 01:19:35,148
Oh. Oh.

1418
01:19:36,232 --> 01:19:37,316
Bit of a shock, isn't it?

1419
01:19:38,317 --> 01:19:40,319
Only you know the staff's location,

1420
01:19:40,403 --> 01:19:42,113
imparted to you by your father.

1421
01:19:42,822 --> 01:19:45,158
He had to leave a clue, didn't he?

1422
01:19:45,658 --> 01:19:46,784
Are you sure?

1423
01:19:46,868 --> 01:19:49,012
She doesn't have that "I know where the staff is" look.

1424
01:19:49,036 --> 01:19:51,789
Listen, the only thing that my father imparted to me

1425
01:19:51,873 --> 01:19:53,416
was to get out of his study.

1426
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:55,877
"Two worlds colliding, only one survives."

1427
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:59,046
Your words exactly. Only lecture time is over.

1428
01:19:59,255 --> 01:20:01,632
You were born for this.

1429
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,594
This is the latest image of their world coming here.

1430
01:20:04,802 --> 01:20:07,096
And you're all that stand in its way.

1431
01:20:07,263 --> 01:20:09,974
So you'd better find that staff quickly. Now!

1432
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:11,952
TRF.

1433
01:20:11,976 --> 01:20:13,478
Surround the castle and lock it down.

1434
01:20:16,898 --> 01:20:19,317
MI6 and TRF are here!

1435
01:20:19,484 --> 01:20:21,194
Move it! Go!

1436
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,362
Cogman, get me to London, okay?

1437
01:20:26,908 --> 01:20:28,788
- The decoy car is ready? - Hurry along.

1438
01:20:31,496 --> 01:20:33,372
Whoa! I got 'em boys!

1439
01:20:37,293 --> 01:20:39,837
Hurry, move! Quick, quick, quick!

1440
01:20:40,546 --> 01:20:42,746
Get us out of here, Bee.

1441
01:20:43,007 --> 01:20:46,219
Get out of here! My weapon will stop the time!

1442
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:02,568
Oh! Einstein would've been tickled pink. Foo-Foo!

1443
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:07,657
Quick, this way, this way! Hurry!

1444
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:10,076
Shotgun. I call shotgun.

1445
01:21:18,584 --> 01:21:20,624
Inbound helos, you are clear to land.

1446
01:21:22,088 --> 01:21:24,008
Colonel Lennox just hit the deck.

1447
01:21:25,466 --> 01:21:27,760
This is Santos, Team Leader USA. What you got?

1448
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:33,474
TRF airship on the way.

1449
01:21:41,065 --> 01:21:42,191
Meet me around back, Bee.

1450
01:21:44,485 --> 01:21:45,945
I suck at this game!

1451
01:21:46,112 --> 01:21:48,090
When you bite your nails, you give everything away.

1452
01:21:48,114 --> 01:21:49,615
Mum?

1453
01:21:50,575 --> 01:21:52,785
Everybody, this is Cade.

1454
01:21:52,869 --> 01:21:55,288
Cade, this is my family.

1455
01:21:55,454 --> 01:21:56,455
Hello!

1456
01:21:56,622 --> 01:21:58,040
- Hi. - Cade?

1457
01:21:58,207 --> 01:21:59,584
Hello. I'm Marie.

1458
01:21:59,667 --> 01:22:00,947
Do you have a dungeon?

1459
01:22:01,002 --> 01:22:03,129
Oh, my goodness! Hands like rough old maple.

1460
01:22:03,254 --> 01:22:04,630
He looks hard as wood.

1461
01:22:04,797 --> 01:22:07,091
Don't touch him. Um, I'm gonna go and get changed.

1462
01:22:07,258 --> 01:22:10,511
I got a call from a very irate janitor at Trinity Library.

1463
01:22:11,178 --> 01:22:12,471
You're late.

1464
01:22:12,638 --> 01:22:14,199
We are, as they say, in a bit of a pickle.

1465
01:22:14,223 --> 01:22:15,725
Do not mess with me at this moment!

1466
01:22:15,808 --> 01:22:18,269
It's hot, and I am on a short fuse.

1467
01:22:21,647 --> 01:22:23,007
Quick! Get to the library!

1468
01:22:23,149 --> 01:22:24,650
This chasing is stressing me out.

1469
01:22:28,654 --> 01:22:31,240
MI6 and TRF are gonna find us. We got to hurry.

1470
01:22:31,324 --> 01:22:33,117
My dad had a lot of stuff.

1471
01:22:34,869 --> 01:22:36,454
So, finding the staff's location...

1472
01:22:36,621 --> 01:22:38,223
What does that mean? We're looking for, like, what?

1473
01:22:38,247 --> 01:22:39,999
Like, a map, or a letter, or books, or...

1474
01:22:40,082 --> 01:22:42,835
Holy shit! It'll take a year to find something in here.

1475
01:22:43,002 --> 01:22:45,379
I don't know where to find this bloody staff.

1476
01:22:45,463 --> 01:22:46,797
Look at this little fake horse.

1477
01:22:46,881 --> 01:22:48,150
Probably stuffed in its butt or something.

1478
01:22:48,174 --> 01:22:49,414
Guys do stupid stuff like that.

1479
01:22:51,302 --> 01:22:52,762
What is going on up there?

1480
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:55,700
You checking behind pictures?

1481
01:22:55,848 --> 01:22:57,128
Just rip it. Rip it apart!

1482
01:22:57,683 --> 01:22:59,602
Just grab it. Hurry, let's make this quick.

1483
01:22:59,685 --> 01:23:00,829
Oh! This is exciting.

1484
01:23:00,853 --> 01:23:03,356
- I can't get it out. - Oh, wow. Great.

1485
01:23:03,522 --> 01:23:06,525
Oh, my God. Such a hoarder.

1486
01:23:08,444 --> 01:23:10,863
It's like having Tarzan in the house.

1487
01:23:10,988 --> 01:23:12,281
Slow down.

1488
01:23:13,866 --> 01:23:15,368
- I'm gonna take a peek. - No!

1489
01:23:16,202 --> 01:23:17,202
Come on, come on.

1490
01:23:17,244 --> 01:23:18,430
Answer me, come on!

1491
01:23:20,873 --> 01:23:22,351
Damn you, tell me where it is!

1492
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:25,544
Not so fast. I want in.

1493
01:23:26,545 --> 01:23:28,547
To be a Witwiccan, you have to be a special person.

1494
01:23:28,631 --> 01:23:30,049
You, sir, are not.

1495
01:23:30,132 --> 01:23:32,718
Read me into the club and I'll tell you. Right here, now.

1496
01:23:32,885 --> 01:23:35,888
Over the phone? That is absolutely barbaric.

1497
01:23:36,055 --> 01:23:37,890
Over the phone. Do it, Englishman!

1498
01:23:38,057 --> 01:23:41,394
As the 12th Earl of Folgan, by the power imbued

1499
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,603
by His Majesty King Arthur

1500
01:23:42,687 --> 01:23:44,563
and his League of Knights of the Round Table,

1501
01:23:44,647 --> 01:23:46,857
I now grant you, Seymour Rutherford Simmons...

1502
01:23:47,024 --> 01:23:49,402
- Entrance into... - "Admittance," not "entrance"!

1503
01:23:49,485 --> 01:23:50,963
Don't try to snooker me. Get it right.

1504
01:23:50,987 --> 01:23:53,656
Enough, enough, enough. Just tell me! Now!

1505
01:23:53,739 --> 01:23:54,824
Shh! Hush!

1506
01:23:54,991 --> 01:23:57,201
Shut up! "Shh" yourselves.

1507
01:23:58,077 --> 01:23:59,537
What's the matter with you all?

1508
01:23:59,704 --> 01:24:00,704
Stack six, row C.

1509
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,416
Hurry, man, they're dissolving scrotums. Let's go.

1510
01:24:03,582 --> 01:24:05,519
I'm going! I'm going! It's very confusing talking to you.

1511
01:24:05,543 --> 01:24:06,561
Come on, old man, get there!

1512
01:24:06,585 --> 01:24:08,185
Come on, Simmons, you said no work today.

1513
01:24:08,254 --> 01:24:10,673
Let's get your pale-ass legs and go to the beach.

1514
01:24:10,756 --> 01:24:13,259
I'm working here, all right? Five minutes, I swear!

1515
01:24:13,426 --> 01:24:15,761
You always say five minutes. That means no.

1516
01:24:15,928 --> 01:24:18,514
Just go get Rodrigo and Julio and get the game started.

1517
01:24:18,681 --> 01:24:19,849
I hate Rodrigo.

1518
01:24:20,016 --> 01:24:21,368
I'll set and bump with you in 10 minutes.

1519
01:24:21,392 --> 01:24:23,192
Okay, come on, I'm in the middle of something.

1520
01:24:23,222 --> 01:24:24,031
Okay, back.

1521
01:24:24,061 --> 01:24:27,565
They knew way back in the Dark Ages where the end would begin.

1522
01:24:27,773 --> 01:24:29,942
There is Cybertron and there is Earth.

1523
01:24:30,026 --> 01:24:31,753
Only they don't call it Earth at all, they never did.

1524
01:24:31,777 --> 01:24:32,963
They called it something else.

1525
01:24:32,987 --> 01:24:35,322
One will suck the other dry,

1526
01:24:35,489 --> 01:24:38,409
a giant succubus, until only one remains.

1527
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,785
Wow.

1528
01:24:40,953 --> 01:24:42,288
Earth is Unicron.

1529
01:24:42,788 --> 01:24:46,167
One day his horns will rise to fight the mad goddess Quintessa.

1530
01:24:47,835 --> 01:24:50,296
She will end our planet to resurrect her own.

1531
01:24:51,589 --> 01:24:52,590
Let's go. Hurry!

1532
01:24:52,757 --> 01:24:53,883
- Oh, my lord. - Cogman, go!

1533
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:55,342
Tell me where it goes down.

1534
01:24:55,426 --> 01:24:56,719
I just Dropped it to you.

1535
01:24:56,802 --> 01:24:58,804
The horns are the key to the location.

1536
01:24:58,971 --> 01:25:00,532
Why are they spread out all over the Earth

1537
01:25:00,556 --> 01:25:01,950
in a jumble? The answer, they aren't.

1538
01:25:01,974 --> 01:25:04,602
Time and Mother Nature pulled them apart.

1539
01:25:04,769 --> 01:25:06,246
That's Pangaea. The supercontinent.

1540
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:07,830
It's the same shape on the Round Table.

1541
01:25:08,064 --> 01:25:09,148
Take a gander, Folgers,

1542
01:25:09,231 --> 01:25:12,318
at what's smack in the center of that perfect circle.

1543
01:25:12,485 --> 01:25:14,487
- Genius! - That's Stonehenge!

1544
01:25:14,570 --> 01:25:16,405
One of the greatest mysteries of the ages.

1545
01:25:16,489 --> 01:25:18,115
No one understood its purpose until now.

1546
01:25:18,324 --> 01:25:21,077
- No one. Except me. - That's where it all begins.

1547
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,120
You're the man behind the man. Do something.

1548
01:25:23,204 --> 01:25:25,122
I'll handle it, Brother Simmons, fear not.

1549
01:25:25,206 --> 01:25:26,248
I never had a brother.

1550
01:25:28,167 --> 01:25:29,502
Feels nice.

1551
01:25:29,668 --> 01:25:31,170
Beach time! Ready? Whoo!

1552
01:25:36,092 --> 01:25:37,843
"Viviane followed Merlin."

1553
01:25:38,928 --> 01:25:40,262
What does that mean?

1554
01:25:40,429 --> 01:25:41,722
My secret cupboard!

1555
01:25:46,977 --> 01:25:48,437
Okay, okay.

1556
01:25:48,521 --> 01:25:49,855
"Viviane followed Merlin."

1557
01:25:50,064 --> 01:25:53,025
Only Merlin could wield the magic staff.

1558
01:25:54,026 --> 01:25:55,861
Merlin and little girls, of course.

1559
01:26:00,574 --> 01:26:02,734
Navy Museum, that's got to be where the staff is.

1560
01:26:02,827 --> 01:26:04,620
Oh, my God, It was in my hands all along.

1561
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:09,708
Alpha team, go, go, go.

1562
01:26:11,043 --> 01:26:13,087
- British TRF! - Come on!

1563
01:26:14,547 --> 01:26:15,673
I surrender.

1564
01:26:17,007 --> 01:26:19,635
My lord, TRF is on our tail.

1565
01:26:19,844 --> 01:26:21,764
Why'd you park the decoy car so far away?

1566
01:26:21,846 --> 01:26:23,055
Oh, you are a fusspot!

1567
01:26:24,473 --> 01:26:26,392
Good. Don't let us get caught, Cogman.

1568
01:26:27,685 --> 01:26:29,228
My speciality, my lord.

1569
01:26:47,538 --> 01:26:49,206
Damn! You don't have to kill people.

1570
01:26:56,046 --> 01:26:57,715
Get out of the way!

1571
01:27:00,426 --> 01:27:02,178
Which reminds me, Agnes called.

1572
01:27:02,344 --> 01:27:05,139
Wondered if you're available for a bit of a snuggle this evening.

1573
01:27:05,806 --> 01:27:07,966
Oh, I'd love a snuggle with Agnes. Do I look available?

1574
01:27:18,986 --> 01:27:20,797
- Move, bitch! Get out of my way! - Kamikaze pilot!

1575
01:27:20,821 --> 01:27:22,990
Move, bitch! Get out of my way!

1576
01:27:23,949 --> 01:27:25,618
- Hello. Yes. - Navy Museum.

1577
01:27:27,745 --> 01:27:29,288
Royal Navy Museum. I knew it!

1578
01:27:34,877 --> 01:27:36,437
Bee, I'm gonna divert the cops!

1579
01:27:39,965 --> 01:27:41,318
A Decepticon has been seen...

1580
01:27:41,342 --> 01:27:42,551
What do you mean, Decepticon?

1581
01:27:44,303 --> 01:27:46,143
- Here's where it gets intense. - More intense?

1582
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,400
Bee?

1583
01:28:06,325 --> 01:28:07,805
Goddamn, they're all around us

1584
01:28:07,952 --> 01:28:09,620
and I just have so much road rage!

1585
01:28:09,828 --> 01:28:11,538
Actualize the rage. That's it!

1586
01:28:13,457 --> 01:28:15,084
Oh, you want some?

1587
01:28:17,503 --> 01:28:19,630
Cogman, blast them!

1588
01:28:31,684 --> 01:28:33,477
Good boy.

1589
01:28:35,396 --> 01:28:36,998
It's a one-way street!

1590
01:28:37,022 --> 01:28:38,482
I'm not driving. He's driving.

1591
01:28:40,859 --> 01:28:42,486
No!

1592
01:28:47,157 --> 01:28:48,534
- Bee, head right, haul ass! - Go!

1593
01:28:54,832 --> 01:28:56,041
Whoa!

1594
01:29:03,757 --> 01:29:05,677
That's how you get to the big leagues.

1595
01:29:08,387 --> 01:29:09,930
Oh, that hurt.

1596
01:29:10,556 --> 01:29:13,183
What the hell? You are out of your mind!

1597
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:19,291
- Did we lose them? - Hey, stop!

1598
01:29:19,315 --> 01:29:20,691
- You didn't pay! - Sorry.

1599
01:29:20,858 --> 01:29:23,235
It's all right, I've got them! They just love submarines.

1600
01:29:25,696 --> 01:29:26,696
They're a bit rude.

1601
01:29:26,822 --> 01:29:29,050
Yes, they are, aren't they? That's the modern generation.

1602
01:29:29,074 --> 01:29:32,369
And this museum is closed for eternity.

1603
01:29:32,536 --> 01:29:34,580
All you boys and girls, off the sub now!

1604
01:29:34,747 --> 01:29:37,458
Off the sub now! Move, move, move!

1605
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:39,835
Go on, push! Move your fat ass! Push! Squeeze!

1606
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:40,960
Go, go, go!

1607
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,589
This thing isn't gonna run.

1608
01:29:43,756 --> 01:29:48,010
The mission's in deep, unexplored waters.

1609
01:29:48,093 --> 01:29:49,720
It's wonderful!

1610
01:29:49,887 --> 01:29:52,598
And the sour-sweet musk of men in close quarters.

1611
01:29:52,723 --> 01:29:54,558
It's quite disgusting, really.

1612
01:29:54,725 --> 01:29:56,060
But now this,

1613
01:29:56,226 --> 01:29:58,228
the greatest mission of them all,

1614
01:29:58,312 --> 01:30:00,731
one that I have longed for my entire life...

1615
01:30:01,398 --> 01:30:05,611
To help turn the tide of human history, you know?

1616
01:30:07,738 --> 01:30:10,115
Now, alas,

1617
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:13,118
I can no longer join you.

1618
01:30:14,453 --> 01:30:17,539
But, my lord, you have been waiting for this moment for 71 years.

1619
01:30:17,623 --> 01:30:20,626
I know, I know, but I'm not knighthood material, I'm afraid.

1620
01:30:21,335 --> 01:30:22,335
And, uh...

1621
01:30:22,961 --> 01:30:24,439
You have your mission, and I have mine.

1622
01:30:24,463 --> 01:30:27,091
Oh, no, no. You are not leaving us in this tin can

1623
01:30:27,174 --> 01:30:29,385
with that four-foot mental psychopath. I don't think so.

1624
01:30:29,468 --> 01:30:31,470
I prefer the word "sociopath."

1625
01:30:31,637 --> 01:30:33,597
Mr. Cade, everything you've done in your life,

1626
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:35,766
your pain and your suffering,

1627
01:30:35,849 --> 01:30:38,227
the loss of your wife, separation from your daughter,

1628
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:39,686
your financial difficulties,

1629
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:43,816
it's all just been a journey to this very moment.

1630
01:30:46,402 --> 01:30:47,861
You talk a lot.

1631
01:30:49,238 --> 01:30:51,323
Yeah, I suppose I do.

1632
01:30:52,282 --> 01:30:53,325
Um, my dear,

1633
01:30:54,243 --> 01:30:57,496
uh, your father left the Alliance to you,

1634
01:30:57,579 --> 01:30:58,789
for you alone.

1635
01:30:58,956 --> 01:31:00,833
She knows the way to the staff.

1636
01:31:00,999 --> 01:31:03,001
Good luck to both of you.

1637
01:31:04,336 --> 01:31:06,338
It won't be the strangest thing I've done today.

1638
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,216
Oh...

1639
01:31:10,384 --> 01:31:12,024
Hope the old girl's still got it.

1640
01:31:19,184 --> 01:31:20,352
Good luck!

1641
01:31:20,519 --> 01:31:21,520
Whoa.

1642
01:31:22,646 --> 01:31:23,647
Oh, sh...

1643
01:31:23,856 --> 01:31:24,857
Whoa.

1644
01:31:25,149 --> 01:31:26,942
Okay. I didn't do that.

1645
01:31:28,152 --> 01:31:29,254
Jumped? What do you mean, jumped?

1646
01:31:29,278 --> 01:31:31,530
The old World War II sub jumped its moorings.

1647
01:31:31,697 --> 01:31:33,031
They're in a Transformer.

1648
01:31:42,875 --> 01:31:44,355
- Can I get a look? - No, I'm looking.

1649
01:31:44,501 --> 01:31:46,128
Will you move?

1650
01:31:46,211 --> 01:31:48,005
God, get out of the way, man! Is that water?

1651
01:31:48,088 --> 01:31:50,591
- No shit, Sherlock. - Obviously, it's water.

1652
01:31:50,728 --> 01:31:51,728
Do you know how to operate it?

1653
01:31:51,758 --> 01:31:52,902
You know how to operate it, right?

1654
01:31:52,926 --> 01:31:54,779
He says you're in charge of this now.

1655
01:31:54,803 --> 01:31:56,723
- Let me see. Let me see. - Don't touch me again!

1656
01:31:56,763 --> 01:31:58,140
Don't freak me out.

1657
01:31:58,223 --> 01:32:00,434
What happens in the alien ship stays in the alien ship.

1658
01:32:00,726 --> 01:32:02,644
I will eff you up!

1659
01:32:04,229 --> 01:32:06,356
Surface, I have positive surface contact.

1660
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:07,858
Track number 5205.

1661
01:32:08,275 --> 01:32:09,377
The sub must be heading for open water,

1662
01:32:09,401 --> 01:32:10,761
directly towards our strike group.

1663
01:32:10,861 --> 01:32:11,880
Okay, we have to cut 'em off. Stop 'em.

1664
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,030
Use whatever assets we have.

1665
01:32:13,155 --> 01:32:14,239
Contact the Zulu module.

1666
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:16,384
Have all our subs converge on that chokepoint.

1667
01:32:16,408 --> 01:32:18,243
Helm, all ahead flank.

1668
01:32:20,162 --> 01:32:21,556
Conn, Sonar. Alien contact,

1669
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:23,499
bearing 150, range 1,000 yards.

1670
01:32:23,665 --> 01:32:25,417
Contact bearing 150.

1671
01:32:31,089 --> 01:32:33,800
We need to get SEAL teams in DSVs. We need to chase 'em.

1672
01:32:37,971 --> 01:32:39,282
Control. Ace One, going to the bay.

1673
01:32:39,306 --> 01:32:40,474
Ace One, going to the bay.

1674
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:54,797
Cogman? Is that normal?

1675
01:32:54,821 --> 01:32:56,073
Perfectly normal, ma'am.

1676
01:32:56,156 --> 01:32:57,759
A nuclear-class attack submarine is on our stern.

1677
01:32:57,783 --> 01:32:58,784
What?

1678
01:32:58,909 --> 01:33:00,494
Quick, follow me. Quick.

1679
01:33:00,661 --> 01:33:01,954
It's your sub, not mine.

1680
01:33:02,371 --> 01:33:05,707
My sub? Seven hours ago, I was just a professor.

1681
01:33:09,878 --> 01:33:11,078
All right, uncoupling.

1682
01:33:20,472 --> 01:33:23,100
All right, let's move. Let's move. Put it in high gear.

1683
01:33:27,145 --> 01:33:28,480
DSV-2, stay on our tail.

1684
01:33:29,731 --> 01:33:32,401
Conn, Sonar. Alien contact, 1,000 yards and closing.

1685
01:33:32,526 --> 01:33:34,069
An alarm on a sub is not a good thing.

1686
01:33:34,152 --> 01:33:35,463
Why did he send us up here?

1687
01:33:35,487 --> 01:33:36,947
He got us up front so we die first.

1688
01:33:37,072 --> 01:33:38,091
Let's let them know we're here.

1689
01:33:38,115 --> 01:33:40,075
Warning shot. Make tube one ready in all respects.

1690
01:33:40,158 --> 01:33:41,243
Shoot tube one.

1691
01:33:50,127 --> 01:33:52,212
Conn, Sonar. Alien contact going vertical.

1692
01:34:02,806 --> 01:34:03,932
Hold on!

1693
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:13,668
Conn, Sonar. It's coming back around.

1694
01:34:13,692 --> 01:34:15,319
- It's gonna hit us! - Brace for impact!

1695
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:17,863
Hold on!

1696
01:34:25,037 --> 01:34:26,538
Conn, Sonar. He's going deep!

1697
01:34:26,747 --> 01:34:28,874
We're clear for now.

1698
01:34:29,166 --> 01:34:32,169
Hands off! There is a time and a place for everything.

1699
01:34:32,377 --> 01:34:34,796
This is not the time nor the place.

1700
01:34:35,213 --> 01:34:36,548
- Hey! - Not now!

1701
01:34:36,715 --> 01:34:38,884
- Where are you going? - Away from here.

1702
01:34:42,804 --> 01:34:45,140
That little sicko just shot himself out like a torpedo!

1703
01:34:45,307 --> 01:34:46,850
I know! I saw it!

1704
01:34:47,017 --> 01:34:48,352
Those are your peoples.

1705
01:34:56,068 --> 01:34:59,404
Good afternoon. Is the, uh, Prime Minister in?

1706
01:34:59,488 --> 01:35:00,489
Who?

1707
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:03,033
The Prime Minister, who else? It's very urgent.

1708
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,744
Oh, it's urgent, is it? Why didn't you say so?

1709
01:35:06,745 --> 01:35:08,080
Oh. Thank you. Dickhead.

1710
01:35:08,246 --> 01:35:10,082
I'll use the old entrance. Good afternoon.

1711
01:35:10,582 --> 01:35:11,917
Get in there.

1712
01:35:22,594 --> 01:35:23,845
Oh, my... Sorry.

1713
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:25,690
Oh, I just got this thing that was on my arm

1714
01:35:25,722 --> 01:35:27,241
and it's, like, just moving all around.

1715
01:35:27,265 --> 01:35:31,269
Yeah. It seems to not be, um... If you'd...

1716
01:35:31,853 --> 01:35:34,022
It's just sort of slithery...

1717
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:36,274
Slipping from the arm to the...

1718
01:35:36,525 --> 01:35:38,544
- Yeah, it's coming down. - It's going down your pants there.

1719
01:35:38,568 --> 01:35:39,861
- Careful. - Oh...

1720
01:35:40,445 --> 01:35:42,197
And is it tight or gripping on?

1721
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:43,758
It doesn't hurt, but I don't know what it does.

1722
01:35:43,782 --> 01:35:45,450
It's like some worthless alien junk.

1723
01:35:45,617 --> 01:35:47,095
I think the purpose... I think the...

1724
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:48,620
We'll find out what the purpose is.

1725
01:35:48,787 --> 01:35:50,414
If... If you want to.

1726
01:35:52,874 --> 01:35:55,460
Cogman! What is... What is all this?

1727
01:35:55,627 --> 01:35:56,753
End of the world.

1728
01:35:56,837 --> 01:35:59,798
I thought a meal, a last meal, would be in order.

1729
01:36:00,090 --> 01:36:02,342
- Great. I'm starving. - No canoodling.

1730
01:36:02,759 --> 01:36:03,760
Wait, Cogman?

1731
01:36:07,097 --> 01:36:08,449
- Yep. My daughter would... - So my grandma said...

1732
01:36:08,473 --> 01:36:10,016
My daughter would love this.

1733
01:36:10,046 --> 01:36:11,029
My grandma would absolutely...

1734
01:36:11,059 --> 01:36:12,161
She keeps saying I've got to move on.

1735
01:36:12,185 --> 01:36:13,621
Yeah, I was about to say. She would love it.

1736
01:36:13,645 --> 01:36:15,063
- Really? - Yes, all the time!

1737
01:36:15,188 --> 01:36:17,348
- What does she say? - "Go on a date, get a boyfriend."

1738
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:18,734
Is this a date?

1739
01:36:19,401 --> 01:36:22,028
- No. God, it's not a date. No. - It's just that...

1740
01:36:22,112 --> 01:36:23,572
It's romantic.

1741
01:36:25,073 --> 01:36:27,159
Sushi a la Cogman!

1742
01:36:27,534 --> 01:36:28,702
Wow! Looks great.

1743
01:36:36,084 --> 01:36:37,669
No sacrifice,

1744
01:36:37,794 --> 01:36:38,837
no victory.

1745
01:36:42,758 --> 01:36:44,843
Is the President in his bunker?

1746
01:36:45,427 --> 01:36:46,511
He is.

1747
01:36:46,845 --> 01:36:48,346
How about Putin?

1748
01:36:49,639 --> 01:36:50,974
Son of a bitch.

1749
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:56,438
Are you the new Prime Minister?

1750
01:36:56,605 --> 01:36:58,523
Security, my office, now!

1751
01:36:58,690 --> 01:37:00,650
Oh, I'm sorry. Well, I used the old entrance.

1752
01:37:01,109 --> 01:37:03,153
That door is used for extraordinary circumstances,

1753
01:37:03,236 --> 01:37:05,280
and these circumstances are quite extraordinary.

1754
01:37:05,781 --> 01:37:07,574
I will keep this very simple.

1755
01:37:08,033 --> 01:37:09,393
Nasty little fellow.

1756
01:37:09,451 --> 01:37:12,204
I let him out, we all die terrible deaths.

1757
01:37:12,370 --> 01:37:13,622
Do you understand?

1758
01:37:14,998 --> 01:37:16,124
Thank you.

1759
01:37:16,374 --> 01:37:18,210
Now, my name is Sir Edmond Burton,

1760
01:37:18,376 --> 01:37:20,754
Her Majesty's Royal Navy, Order of the Witwiccans,

1761
01:37:20,879 --> 01:37:23,548
keeper of the secret history of Transformers here on Earth...

1762
01:37:23,715 --> 01:37:25,550
- Witwiccans? - Witwiccans, yes.

1763
01:37:27,761 --> 01:37:29,638
But erm, they all died out.

1764
01:37:30,013 --> 01:37:33,266
Not all of them. Not yet, anyway.

1765
01:37:33,433 --> 01:37:35,560
But I do need you to marshal all your resources...

1766
01:37:35,727 --> 01:37:37,407
- Hold on. You have just... - Best shut up.

1767
01:37:37,479 --> 01:37:39,457
- Emerged from the wall and now... - Let me finish. Let me...

1768
01:37:39,481 --> 01:37:40,774
Shut up!

1769
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:46,279
Shut up.

1770
01:37:47,989 --> 01:37:50,075
Okay. As I said, I need you to marshal

1771
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:52,327
all your resources, all your military assets.

1772
01:37:52,661 --> 01:37:55,038
Because as you no doubt have surmised,

1773
01:37:55,121 --> 01:37:56,581
the world is going to end,

1774
01:37:56,957 --> 01:37:59,292
and I know where. And when.

1775
01:38:06,258 --> 01:38:10,011
You are the first to see this ship since the Dark Ages.

1776
01:38:10,345 --> 01:38:14,850
Your talisman is the key to unlocking this ship.

1777
01:38:28,697 --> 01:38:30,448
Sonar has about 800 meters.

1778
01:38:33,034 --> 01:38:35,412
I think I got a bogey at four o'clock.

1779
01:38:35,745 --> 01:38:37,831
We're starting to see it through the murk.

1780
01:38:39,666 --> 01:38:41,334
There's lights down here.

1781
01:38:42,794 --> 01:38:45,630
Oh, my God. Look at that. It's a big alien ship.

1782
01:38:46,214 --> 01:38:49,134
Topside, are you catching this? It's massive.

1783
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:56,224
The ship knows we're here.

1784
01:39:12,782 --> 01:39:13,783
Stay on his tail.

1785
01:39:18,830 --> 01:39:19,831
Oh, shit.

1786
01:39:25,003 --> 01:39:26,838
The door just sealed.

1787
01:39:27,672 --> 01:39:29,466
Try those tubes.

1788
01:39:30,383 --> 01:39:32,302
DSV-2, stay close. Stay close.

1789
01:39:32,844 --> 01:39:34,179
Topside, we're going in.

1790
01:39:34,971 --> 01:39:36,681
We're gonna lose radio contact.

1791
01:39:47,705 --> 01:39:48,705
We're in a current!

1792
01:39:48,735 --> 01:39:50,735
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Steady, steady, steady!

1793
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,572
Use the arms to keep us...

1794
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:56,761
- Keep control! - Stay off the wall!

1795
01:39:56,785 --> 01:39:57,985
- Hold it! - Stay off the wall!

1796
01:40:20,016 --> 01:40:21,017
What now?

1797
01:40:21,476 --> 01:40:22,686
You're the last knight.

1798
01:40:22,769 --> 01:40:26,731
You're the Earl's special guy. You figure it out.

1799
01:40:27,565 --> 01:40:29,192
Let's go.

1800
01:40:29,985 --> 01:40:31,528
I'm not going in that water.

1801
01:40:31,611 --> 01:40:34,698
My gears would be sucked into my main shaft.

1802
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:40,412
Now you're both on my shit list.

1803
01:41:06,855 --> 01:41:08,398
We were blinded.

1804
01:41:08,773 --> 01:41:10,275
Blinded by the sun.

1805
01:41:11,067 --> 01:41:13,319
The planet hid its approach behind our star.

1806
01:41:13,778 --> 01:41:17,115
It seems to be acting deliberately.

1807
01:41:41,181 --> 01:41:43,224
Dozens of strikes currently modeled.

1808
01:41:44,142 --> 01:41:46,895
First impact will be Alpha Station.

1809
01:41:46,978 --> 01:41:47,979
There is no escape pod.

1810
01:41:49,147 --> 01:41:51,066
Earth will follow two hours later.

1811
01:41:51,357 --> 01:41:54,444
Dominic modeled potential casualties in the tens of millions.

1812
01:41:57,030 --> 01:41:58,156
There's two moons!

1813
01:41:58,281 --> 01:41:59,949
There's two moons!

1814
01:42:00,450 --> 01:42:02,160
The world is ending?

1815
01:42:03,203 --> 01:42:05,097
Some are saying that it's going to be a global killer.

1816
01:42:05,121 --> 01:42:06,515
Human civilization as we know it

1817
01:42:06,539 --> 01:42:08,166
will change in 12 hours.

1818
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,919
The destruction, we're told by experts, will be immense.

1819
01:42:28,019 --> 01:42:29,163
This is unbelievable.

1820
01:42:29,187 --> 01:42:30,427
Yeah, it is unbelievable.

1821
01:42:30,563 --> 01:42:32,003
What does the old man want us to do?

1822
01:42:33,858 --> 01:42:35,276
Whoa!

1823
01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:39,572
Whoa.

1824
01:42:39,948 --> 01:42:41,588
Bee, go around, find another way! Come on!

1825
01:42:41,616 --> 01:42:42,843
What? Are you serious?

1826
01:42:42,867 --> 01:42:44,911
Think I like winding up in a place like this?

1827
01:42:51,292 --> 01:42:53,211
It wants us to go this way.

1828
01:42:54,671 --> 01:42:55,672
Whoa.

1829
01:42:56,131 --> 01:42:58,758
Daytrader! Son of a bitch actually came through with our ship!

1830
01:42:58,925 --> 01:43:01,469
Excellent. We are going to England.

1831
01:43:01,553 --> 01:43:03,680
Things are likely to get nasty. Real nasty.

1832
01:43:03,763 --> 01:43:06,224
Hey, can I come? He might need me.

1833
01:43:06,683 --> 01:43:10,103
Oh, little lady, hell, I ain't no Earth parent. Hop aboard.

1834
01:43:10,186 --> 01:43:12,063
Take a field trip to the front lines.

1835
01:43:12,230 --> 01:43:13,356
Let's go make some noise.

1836
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:15,066
Let's give 'em hell.

1837
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,901
I'm driving.

1838
01:43:17,777 --> 01:43:20,363
Hey, Cade, I'm reluctant to say this to you, but.

1839
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:23,616
I think that you're quite, you know, brave.

1840
01:43:23,908 --> 01:43:25,243
Is that a compliment?

1841
01:43:26,161 --> 01:43:27,996
You could throw one back my way.

1842
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:29,914
Well, that's got to happen organically.

1843
01:43:30,915 --> 01:43:32,458
I was the first off the sub.

1844
01:43:39,215 --> 01:43:40,842
Hold it! Hold.

1845
01:43:41,676 --> 01:43:42,886
I think it's here!

1846
01:44:17,170 --> 01:44:18,171
It's a tomb.

1847
01:44:20,256 --> 01:44:21,442
Station, Houston.

1848
01:44:21,466 --> 01:44:24,636
Page five of the safe zone config procedure.

1849
01:44:25,136 --> 01:44:27,096
Take thrusters to auto.

1850
01:44:28,973 --> 01:44:30,475
It's happening.

1851
01:44:31,142 --> 01:44:32,769
It's in our atmosphere now.

1852
01:44:32,977 --> 01:44:34,354
ISS is our first hit.

1853
01:44:34,812 --> 01:44:36,606
Progress manifolds both failed.

1854
01:44:36,814 --> 01:44:38,399
No thrusters available.

1855
01:44:39,192 --> 01:44:41,152
Conjunction is imminent.

1856
01:44:41,694 --> 01:44:44,364
Good luck and Godspeed.

1857
01:44:53,414 --> 01:44:55,014
Move in, move in, check up.

1858
01:45:03,466 --> 01:45:04,884
Formality.

1859
01:45:06,094 --> 01:45:08,096
Knights are always guarding something.

1860
01:45:11,015 --> 01:45:12,183
Hang on. Look at this.

1861
01:45:12,976 --> 01:45:14,018
It's Celtic.

1862
01:45:35,039 --> 01:45:36,541
It's Merlin.

1863
01:45:37,292 --> 01:45:38,376
It's real.

1864
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,086
All of it!

1865
01:45:40,420 --> 01:45:41,921
Wait, what does this say?

1866
01:45:44,757 --> 01:45:46,259
It means, "No one shall have it."

1867
01:45:46,884 --> 01:45:49,846
Wait a minute. We came all the way down here, all this,

1868
01:45:50,638 --> 01:45:52,181
and you're not gonna open it?

1869
01:45:53,224 --> 01:45:54,464
Of course I'm going to open it.

1870
01:45:55,101 --> 01:45:56,561
Good. Let's go.

1871
01:45:57,103 --> 01:45:59,063
Ready? Let's do this.

1872
01:46:12,243 --> 01:46:13,244
You got to be kidding me.

1873
01:46:17,081 --> 01:46:19,042
We've come all this way for this?

1874
01:46:19,584 --> 01:46:21,224
For your ugly great-great granddad's bones

1875
01:46:21,252 --> 01:46:23,338
in a box and some stupid stick?

1876
01:46:23,671 --> 01:46:24,672
You got to be kidding me.

1877
01:46:24,756 --> 01:46:26,396
How are we gonna save the world with this?

1878
01:46:26,424 --> 01:46:29,093
I could've cut an oak tree down at my house and...

1879
01:46:29,552 --> 01:46:30,970
Don't say a word. Okay?

1880
01:46:31,054 --> 01:46:33,765
The smooth little romantic accent's not gonna work right now.

1881
01:46:34,557 --> 01:46:36,559
- I'm speechless. - Thank God.

1882
01:46:36,726 --> 01:46:38,102
Maybe someone stole it?

1883
01:46:38,603 --> 01:46:40,884
No, there's something else. It's got to be here somewhere.

1884
01:46:41,814 --> 01:46:43,816
I didn't come all this way for nothing.

1885
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:46,152
The whole world's at stake.

1886
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:56,454
Guys, the meters are freaking.

1887
01:46:57,205 --> 01:46:59,957
I got thermals everywhere. These things, they...

1888
01:47:01,209 --> 01:47:02,877
They could still be alive.

1889
01:47:05,046 --> 01:47:07,048
The hell happened to you?

1890
01:47:14,972 --> 01:47:17,725
Who has come for the staff?

1891
01:47:19,811 --> 01:47:21,145
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1892
01:47:25,358 --> 01:47:27,402
- Move! - Get out!

1893
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:32,782
I'm going to distract him. Get out of here.

1894
01:47:35,368 --> 01:47:37,578
- I have the staff! - Hit it!

1895
01:47:45,962 --> 01:47:47,964
Protect the staff.

1896
01:47:53,678 --> 01:47:54,971
Take his eyes out!

1897
01:48:26,419 --> 01:48:28,179
Whoa, who, whoa, this thing's moving.

1898
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:30,548
Corner her!

1899
01:48:30,715 --> 01:48:31,883
Hey.

1900
01:48:32,216 --> 01:48:33,593
Drop the weapon.

1901
01:48:35,928 --> 01:48:36,928
Do it!

1902
01:48:40,308 --> 01:48:41,976
You drop it, or I will.

1903
01:48:45,104 --> 01:48:46,498
You don't know what you're doing, Lennox. Stop!

1904
01:48:46,522 --> 01:48:47,607
All I want is that weapon!

1905
01:48:47,732 --> 01:48:49,025
- Go ahead, shoot me! - No!

1906
01:48:49,567 --> 01:48:51,235
Only I can wield it.

1907
01:48:51,527 --> 01:48:52,570
Go on!

1908
01:48:53,654 --> 01:48:54,906
Do it!

1909
01:48:55,573 --> 01:48:57,033
Shoot me!

1910
01:48:57,241 --> 01:48:58,841
You don't know what you're doing, Lennox.

1911
01:49:00,411 --> 01:49:01,537
Don't.

1912
01:49:03,539 --> 01:49:05,124
Protect the staff.

1913
01:49:22,683 --> 01:49:25,520
I've come for that staff.

1914
01:49:32,068 --> 01:49:34,445
Optimus... What are you doing?

1915
01:49:34,987 --> 01:49:36,239
Give it to me.

1916
01:49:36,572 --> 01:49:38,950
It's me, Cade. We fought together.

1917
01:49:39,033 --> 01:49:43,329
I fight for my own kind! My own planet!

1918
01:49:43,996 --> 01:49:45,665
- Cade? - This isn't you, Prime.

1919
01:49:45,831 --> 01:49:48,292
Give me the staff, human.

1920
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:49,961
Cade?

1921
01:49:50,753 --> 01:49:52,630
I will kill you.

1922
01:49:52,713 --> 01:49:53,714
Give it to him.

1923
01:49:59,845 --> 01:50:00,845
Now.

1924
01:50:14,986 --> 01:50:17,488
Who dares to challenge me?

1925
01:50:26,163 --> 01:50:27,331
It's all wrong, Bee.

1926
01:50:27,498 --> 01:50:29,058
Something happened. That is not Optimus.

1927
01:50:29,125 --> 01:50:31,335
You got to find him, Bee. Remember ZB-7?

1928
01:50:31,502 --> 01:50:33,337
You got to be that Autobot again.

1929
01:50:33,588 --> 01:50:35,524
Look you got to get back to the sub, all right? Get out of here.

1930
01:50:35,548 --> 01:50:36,674
Wait, what about you?

1931
01:50:36,757 --> 01:50:39,093
Bee's always had my back. It's my turn to have his. Go.

1932
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:40,654
All right, get back to the DSV.

1933
01:50:40,678 --> 01:50:43,014
Let them know up top that we lost control of the weapon.

1934
01:50:43,139 --> 01:50:44,473
Roger that, sir.

1935
01:50:44,682 --> 01:50:46,517
You heard him. Back to the sub!

1936
01:50:46,642 --> 01:50:48,144
We're gonna find him.

1937
01:51:42,281 --> 01:51:43,921
Come on, we got to get to the top!

1938
01:51:46,827 --> 01:51:49,163
Holy shit. Holy shit.

1939
01:51:50,414 --> 01:51:52,041
We can make it! Come on!

1940
01:52:06,597 --> 01:52:08,599
Watch out, big wave coming!

1941
01:52:08,849 --> 01:52:09,934
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1942
01:52:27,493 --> 01:52:29,870
I am Nemesis Prime.

1943
01:52:31,163 --> 01:52:33,332
You are nothing!

1944
01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:40,631
Move it!

1945
01:52:41,507 --> 01:52:43,507
Air's gonna be on station 14 to 16.

1946
01:52:43,634 --> 01:52:46,470
TOC, it looks like we have a surfaced alien ship.

1947
01:52:47,513 --> 01:52:49,932
Lightning 4 has visual on Optimus.

1948
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:56,188
Prime! Prime, stop!

1949
01:52:56,522 --> 01:52:59,483
Prime, you got to stop! Please! Don't do this!

1950
01:53:00,067 --> 01:53:01,152
Look at me, Prime.

1951
01:53:01,485 --> 01:53:03,738
What are you doing? It's Bee!

1952
01:53:03,988 --> 01:53:06,073
Prime! You can't do this.

1953
01:53:41,609 --> 01:53:43,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1954
01:53:50,785 --> 01:53:51,869
Prime!

1955
01:53:53,704 --> 01:53:55,206
Stop! No!

1956
01:53:56,081 --> 01:54:00,544
I am Bumblebee, your oldest friend.

1957
01:54:01,128 --> 01:54:02,463
Optimus,

1958
01:54:03,214 --> 01:54:06,300
I would lay down my life for you.

1959
01:54:14,517 --> 01:54:17,686
Bumblebee. Your voice.

1960
01:54:18,229 --> 01:54:19,730
I have not heard it

1961
01:54:20,272 --> 01:54:22,566
since Cybertron fell.

1962
01:54:36,455 --> 01:54:39,458
What have I done?

1963
01:54:50,469 --> 01:54:53,305
You blew your chance to kill Unicron.

1964
01:54:54,098 --> 01:54:56,600
I knew you couldn't do it.

1965
01:54:57,101 --> 01:54:59,895
Your time is over, Prime.

1966
01:55:00,271 --> 01:55:02,356
You failed.

1967
01:55:02,439 --> 01:55:05,651
You turned your back on Cybertron.

1968
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:08,904
Now you will watch Earth die.

1969
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:12,241
No!

1970
01:55:18,956 --> 01:55:20,666
Not going so well.

1971
01:55:32,303 --> 01:55:33,304
Cade!

1972
01:55:38,809 --> 01:55:41,562
You betrayed your own kind.

1973
01:55:41,812 --> 01:55:43,147
No, Prime, get up!

1974
01:55:43,314 --> 01:55:45,816
You chose the wrong side.

1975
01:55:45,983 --> 01:55:50,613
The Guardian Knights are going to kill me.

1976
01:55:50,821 --> 01:55:53,282
Quintessa is the great deceiver!

1977
01:56:00,706 --> 01:56:03,918
The judgment is death.

1978
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:38,077
Seglass Ni Tonday.

1979
01:56:38,827 --> 01:56:41,163
Seglass Ni Tonday.

1980
01:56:41,246 --> 01:56:44,833
Seglass Ni Tonday.

1981
01:56:58,138 --> 01:57:01,308
Cade, I have failed you.

1982
01:57:03,978 --> 01:57:06,021
I have doomed Earth.

1983
01:57:07,731 --> 01:57:11,318
Earth, the only place in the universe

1984
01:57:12,069 --> 01:57:15,072
whose people let me call it

1985
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:17,741
home.

1986
01:57:22,037 --> 01:57:24,039
Only you can make it right, Prime.

1987
01:57:25,666 --> 01:57:27,334
I can't do it without you.

1988
01:57:28,502 --> 01:57:30,504
One moment, that's all we got.

1989
01:57:31,630 --> 01:57:33,298
It's up to you, Prime.

1990
01:57:33,716 --> 01:57:34,800
Because without you,

1991
01:57:35,718 --> 01:57:37,052
we all die.

1992
01:57:40,139 --> 01:57:41,598
It's now or never.

1993
01:57:42,641 --> 01:57:44,143
My brothers,

1994
01:57:44,643 --> 01:57:48,480
I will never betray you again.

1995
01:57:49,481 --> 01:57:52,234
I am Optimus Prime.

1996
01:57:52,317 --> 01:57:56,155
To save Earth, we must go to Cybertron

1997
01:57:56,447 --> 01:57:59,116
and destroy Quintessa.

1998
01:58:22,347 --> 01:58:24,183
The ship is coming.

1999
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:26,143
It is beautiful.

2000
01:58:38,447 --> 01:58:40,574
Optimus Prime gave us the coordinates for the endgame.

2001
01:58:40,657 --> 01:58:41,867
It's an ignition chamber.

2002
01:58:42,159 --> 01:58:43,535
The weapon's going up there.

2003
01:58:43,994 --> 01:58:45,314
Get Preds and satellites eyes on.

2004
01:58:45,454 --> 01:58:47,873
Find it and prepare to engage.

2005
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:50,852
Cyclops, 21,000 feet.

2006
01:58:50,876 --> 01:58:52,836
Eyeball target, ignition chamber. We found it.

2007
01:58:53,003 --> 01:58:54,481
Prime's coordinates are good.

2008
01:58:54,505 --> 01:58:56,825
Contact, ignition chamber. Target in sight.

2009
01:58:58,050 --> 01:58:59,593
Ignition chamber, ignition chamber.

2010
01:58:59,676 --> 01:59:01,720
We've got to figure out what makes it tick.

2011
01:59:02,096 --> 01:59:03,764
We've got to shut it down!

2012
01:59:04,932 --> 01:59:06,391
Come on, come on, come on!

2013
01:59:07,267 --> 01:59:08,602
Good to see you.

2014
01:59:08,685 --> 01:59:10,270
Let's get out of here! Let's go!

2015
01:59:13,398 --> 01:59:14,900
General, we're gonna prep a HALO jump

2016
01:59:14,983 --> 01:59:16,026
on that ignition chamber.

2017
01:59:16,568 --> 01:59:18,208
Planes will never nav through those vines.

2018
01:59:18,445 --> 01:59:21,073
Lennox, trust me. That's our ride right there.

2019
01:59:21,865 --> 01:59:24,159
Our Autobot ship. Put the Ospreys in that.

2020
01:59:24,243 --> 01:59:25,536
It'll get us up there.

2021
01:59:25,702 --> 01:59:27,454
Autobot ship's gonna drop the Ospreys.

2022
01:59:27,538 --> 01:59:29,858
They'll virtually glide to the LZ. It's gonna be high-risk.

2023
01:59:29,915 --> 01:59:32,417
They want to do what at 20,000 feet?

2024
01:59:32,626 --> 01:59:34,795
Sir, there's this girl. Woman, actually. Teacher.

2025
01:59:34,878 --> 01:59:36,880
- Oxford. - She plays a little polo.

2026
01:59:37,965 --> 01:59:40,050
Well, that's fantastic.

2027
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:41,903
They're gonna break her into the chamber

2028
01:59:41,927 --> 01:59:43,053
to steal the staff.

2029
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:46,849
Okay, that is the dumbest idea you could possibly have!

2030
01:59:47,057 --> 01:59:49,309
Personally, I'm gonna rely on physics and mathematics

2031
01:59:49,393 --> 01:59:50,394
to save the planet,

2032
01:59:50,477 --> 01:59:52,980
not mysticism, fairies, and some hobgoblins.

2033
02:00:10,581 --> 02:00:12,166
I've lived for this.

2034
02:00:12,249 --> 02:00:14,626
I've lived to kill a planet!

2035
02:00:15,627 --> 02:00:18,755
For our world, I activate this portal!

2036
02:00:35,522 --> 02:00:36,648
Fire!

2037
02:00:59,129 --> 02:01:01,548
You wretched human!

2038
02:01:20,609 --> 02:01:21,610
Hey!

2039
02:01:26,323 --> 02:01:27,658
Hey.

2040
02:01:29,326 --> 02:01:31,245
You got my message. You brought everyone here.

2041
02:01:31,328 --> 02:01:32,454
Come on.

2042
02:01:34,873 --> 02:01:35,874
Hey!

2043
02:01:36,375 --> 02:01:38,543
I just found Optimus Prime!

2044
02:01:39,670 --> 02:01:41,672
He's gonna deal with all this shit!

2045
02:01:42,172 --> 02:01:44,174
He's gonna save our asses!

2046
02:01:45,342 --> 02:01:47,803
I brought the troops, man. I brought the troops.

2047
02:01:48,679 --> 02:01:50,555
Knights, Autobots,

2048
02:01:50,889 --> 02:01:54,559
this cannot and will not be the end.

2049
02:01:56,186 --> 02:01:58,897
To save Earth and her people,

2050
02:01:59,189 --> 02:02:02,359
we are going to steal Quintessa's staff.

2051
02:02:02,985 --> 02:02:05,988
Only you, Viviane, can take it back.

2052
02:02:07,864 --> 02:02:10,367
I will lead the way into her chamber.

2053
02:02:12,202 --> 02:02:16,248
And when the account of the ages is etched into the cosmos,

2054
02:02:16,581 --> 02:02:20,335
let those who exist long after us know

2055
02:02:20,919 --> 02:02:24,464
that this was our finest hour.

2056
02:02:30,345 --> 02:02:33,223
Love that guy. Goosebumps every time.

2057
02:02:33,557 --> 02:02:34,850
I never got to say hi.

2058
02:02:37,728 --> 02:02:39,229
Here they come.

2059
02:02:39,521 --> 02:02:41,064
You think there's enough?

2060
02:02:41,148 --> 02:02:42,566
No, not even close.

2061
02:02:45,068 --> 02:02:46,862
My lord! Lord Folgan!

2062
02:02:56,955 --> 02:02:58,623
I had it, Cogman.

2063
02:03:00,751 --> 02:03:02,252
I had my moment.

2064
02:03:04,212 --> 02:03:05,881
You did, my lord.

2065
02:03:07,507 --> 02:03:09,343
This is the hardest part of my job.

2066
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:12,471
Watching Folgans die.

2067
02:03:13,638 --> 02:03:15,599
Thank you, Cogman.

2068
02:03:16,141 --> 02:03:17,476
Carry on.

2069
02:03:22,105 --> 02:03:25,609
Of all the earls I have had the pleasure to serve,

2070
02:03:26,109 --> 02:03:28,362
you were by far the coolest.

2071
02:03:41,458 --> 02:03:43,794
I have found your staff of power.

2072
02:03:45,128 --> 02:03:47,339
There is only one who can hurt us.

2073
02:03:47,798 --> 02:03:51,009
I felt her. She must not enter.

2074
02:03:51,385 --> 02:03:53,428
My army will stop them.

2075
02:03:54,513 --> 02:03:58,809
Watch as our world heals and theirs dies.

2076
02:03:59,810 --> 02:04:01,812
A world reborn!

2077
02:04:27,671 --> 02:04:29,005
It's coming.

2078
02:04:43,937 --> 02:04:45,480
It's gonna crush us.

2079
02:04:45,647 --> 02:04:47,315
Get that ship clear of the crush zone now!

2080
02:04:47,441 --> 02:04:49,484
- We got to bail! - Move to the Ospreys!

2081
02:04:59,202 --> 02:05:01,538
Move, move, move! To the Ospreys!

2082
02:05:01,830 --> 02:05:03,590
That thing's gonna roll right over us!

2083
02:05:12,382 --> 02:05:13,383
Move!

2084
02:05:25,270 --> 02:05:26,831
Preliminary numbers

2085
02:05:26,855 --> 02:05:28,190
are starting to come in.

2086
02:05:28,273 --> 02:05:32,319
Literally scraping away cities. Millions will die.

2087
02:05:46,082 --> 02:05:47,918
It's using Earth's geothermal energy

2088
02:05:48,084 --> 02:05:49,884
to reconstitute, to rebuild itself, all right?

2089
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:53,089
If our core cools, which is rapidly cooling right now,

2090
02:05:53,256 --> 02:05:55,258
the magnetic field dissolves, exposing us

2091
02:05:55,592 --> 02:05:57,344
to high levels of cosmic radiation.

2092
02:05:58,220 --> 02:05:59,721
Maybe you'll understand this.

2093
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:01,598
The Earth becomes a microwave.

2094
02:06:01,890 --> 02:06:04,392
We're the popcorn. Jiffy Pop bag goes

2095
02:06:04,601 --> 02:06:05,852
boom.

2096
02:06:06,478 --> 02:06:08,480
We fry.

2097
02:06:21,701 --> 02:06:23,286
Very mean looking.

2098
02:06:23,620 --> 02:06:26,164
Oh, they look like wusses to me.

2099
02:06:26,748 --> 02:06:28,458
No, they all messed up.

2100
02:06:29,292 --> 02:06:31,169
Two minutes! Hey, two minutes!

2101
02:06:31,962 --> 02:06:33,755
- That thing kill Decepticons? - No.

2102
02:06:34,839 --> 02:06:36,174
We do.

2103
02:06:38,385 --> 02:06:41,721
"A few brave warriors willing to sacrifice all."

2104
02:06:42,472 --> 02:06:44,975
I told my students that was bullshit.

2105
02:06:45,308 --> 02:06:46,810
Load out, let's go!

2106
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:49,640
What are you doing tomorrow?

2107
02:06:49,813 --> 02:06:51,189
Are you asking me that now?

2108
02:06:51,273 --> 02:06:52,399
Yeah, I am.

2109
02:06:52,607 --> 02:06:54,943
No plans? Good.

2110
02:06:55,819 --> 02:06:56,987
Get in the plane.

2111
02:06:57,779 --> 02:06:59,614
- Let's go, let's go! - Let's step it up!

2112
02:06:59,823 --> 02:07:02,023
Strap in. It's gonna be a rough ride.

2113
02:07:02,284 --> 02:07:03,636
- Tighter. - I'm gonna hook you up.

2114
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:05,300
Pull it down tight, right? Just this one?

2115
02:07:05,412 --> 02:07:06,413
You jump...

2116
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:08,307
- Then pull this, right? - This is the one I pull, right?

2117
02:07:08,331 --> 02:07:10,531
Pull? Just pull it? You just pull it as hard as you can?

2118
02:07:10,875 --> 02:07:11,960
Are you all right?

2119
02:07:12,544 --> 02:07:15,255
Can I borrow your cell phone? I've got to text my daughter.

2120
02:07:15,463 --> 02:07:16,464
Thanks.

2121
02:07:24,389 --> 02:07:25,390
All right.

2122
02:07:25,849 --> 02:07:27,183
Thank you.

2123
02:07:38,236 --> 02:07:39,571
Target in sight.

2124
02:07:41,239 --> 02:07:42,532
Contact, ignition chamber.

2125
02:07:42,699 --> 02:07:44,242
Strike package. Execute. Execute.

2126
02:07:44,367 --> 02:07:46,137
Fight's on, fight's on, fight's on.

2127
02:07:56,379 --> 02:07:58,214
Bogeys inbound. Bogeys inbound.

2128
02:07:58,548 --> 02:08:01,051
Bee, get to your ship. Good luck.

2129
02:08:01,718 --> 02:08:03,053
Thirty seconds to drop!

2130
02:08:03,845 --> 02:08:05,722
Those birds better be softening our target.

2131
02:08:05,805 --> 02:08:07,925
You're not giving me that warm, fuzzy feeling, Lennox.

2132
02:08:08,141 --> 02:08:09,535
The Osprey's flight ceiling is 12,000 feet.

2133
02:08:09,559 --> 02:08:10,852
We're double that.

2134
02:08:10,977 --> 02:08:12,937
The air's too thin, the rotor's got no grab.

2135
02:08:13,063 --> 02:08:14,481
We're gonna be coming in hard.

2136
02:08:14,939 --> 02:08:17,025
- It's all bad news. - Oh, yeah.

2137
02:08:19,694 --> 02:08:20,779
All good, Yeager?

2138
02:08:21,237 --> 02:08:22,656
You got something to say?

2139
02:08:23,156 --> 02:08:24,908
You and your guys never stopped hunting me.

2140
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:27,202
Orders. You were with them.

2141
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:28,453
With "them"?

2142
02:08:28,953 --> 02:08:30,664
I believed in one of the great ones.

2143
02:08:30,747 --> 02:08:33,124
Optimus Prime. And his crew. I never lost faith.

2144
02:08:33,917 --> 02:08:35,919
You did. The whole world did.

2145
02:08:36,252 --> 02:08:37,712
Now you want to fly with me.

2146
02:08:40,006 --> 02:08:42,967
Well, I appreciate you guys making the trip. Thank you.

2147
02:08:49,099 --> 02:08:50,266
Get that staff,

2148
02:08:51,476 --> 02:08:52,977
we all go home.

2149
02:08:59,609 --> 02:09:01,736
Lennox, your team is to hold.

2150
02:09:01,820 --> 02:09:03,405
Strike fighters are getting shot down.

2151
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:07,158
Oh. no, it's now or never. Pilots, go now! Go!

2152
02:09:07,325 --> 02:09:08,576
Hang on!

2153
02:09:09,202 --> 02:09:10,202
Chihuahua.

2154
02:09:10,245 --> 02:09:12,664
- What are you doing here? - I don't know.

2155
02:09:13,081 --> 02:09:14,708
But you said we were family.

2156
02:09:15,291 --> 02:09:17,460
No, I didn't mean... We got to get her off here now.

2157
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:19,629
It was probably a bad idea.

2158
02:09:25,969 --> 02:09:27,609
Six birds out of the nest.

2159
02:09:27,721 --> 02:09:29,139
Whoo-hoo!

2160
02:09:34,352 --> 02:09:35,413
All Ospreys clear.

2161
02:09:35,437 --> 02:09:36,980
Push the target, push the target.

2162
02:09:40,567 --> 02:09:41,609
Hang on!

2163
02:09:42,152 --> 02:09:44,237
- Chihuahua. - It's okay. It's okay.

2164
02:09:54,330 --> 02:09:56,410
All fast movers, distract, distract.

2165
02:09:56,499 --> 02:09:58,477
Keep those enemies away from the Ospreys!

2166
02:09:58,501 --> 02:10:00,128
Bogeys dead ahead!

2167
02:10:05,175 --> 02:10:07,677
Control, spread it out, spread it out.

2168
02:10:14,225 --> 02:10:16,465
Those fighters better distract those enemy ships!

2169
02:10:19,022 --> 02:10:21,262
I got bogeys coming in hot, one o'clock.

2170
02:10:26,070 --> 02:10:27,470
I got three bogeys.

2171
02:10:30,658 --> 02:10:32,058
Watch the rotor!

2172
02:10:35,205 --> 02:10:36,706
Sir, bird three just went down!

2173
02:10:57,060 --> 02:10:58,895
There's our landing zone.

2174
02:11:01,397 --> 02:11:02,774
Take that big gun out.

2175
02:11:04,567 --> 02:11:06,569
Viper Flight, focus on that gun.

2176
02:11:13,618 --> 02:11:15,245
Hold on, we're going down!

2177
02:11:15,370 --> 02:11:16,514
It's gonna be a hard hit.

2178
02:11:16,538 --> 02:11:17,723
Don't slide off the edge!

2179
02:11:17,747 --> 02:11:19,187
Brace, brace, brace!

2180
02:11:20,542 --> 02:11:22,210
Two's down, two's down.

2181
02:11:32,178 --> 02:11:33,263
Brace for impact!

2182
02:11:41,980 --> 02:11:44,482
- Out of the bird! - Grab a buddy!

2183
02:11:47,277 --> 02:11:48,557
Get out of the bird! Go!

2184
02:11:49,237 --> 02:11:50,780
Back up. Hurry up, back up.

2185
02:11:54,993 --> 02:11:55,993
Enemy fighters!

2186
02:12:32,655 --> 02:12:34,908
That gun emplacement is tearing us apart!

2187
02:12:39,329 --> 02:12:42,123
There's the ignition chamber, dead ahead!

2188
02:12:46,753 --> 02:12:48,593
Air cover not coming. Unable.

2189
02:12:51,674 --> 02:12:52,800
Whoo-hoo!

2190
02:12:52,884 --> 02:12:54,218
Let's ride, Bee!

2191
02:12:54,344 --> 02:12:55,511
Let's kick ass!

2192
02:13:02,685 --> 02:13:04,687
Push right to the crater! Let's go!

2193
02:13:15,615 --> 02:13:17,659
Pinned down with the Hound!

2194
02:13:19,869 --> 02:13:21,704
No way. Where's Optimus?

2195
02:13:21,788 --> 02:13:23,706
They said he never made it.

2196
02:13:24,207 --> 02:13:25,583
We got the big gun on us!

2197
02:13:25,833 --> 02:13:27,377
We're pinned down!

2198
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:31,005
Negative to target. Unable to advance.

2199
02:13:33,675 --> 02:13:35,510
- Get back here, Izzy! - Izzy!

2200
02:13:35,593 --> 02:13:36,753
I'll be right back!

2201
02:13:36,844 --> 02:13:39,347
It's just a cluster effin' thingamabob!

2202
02:13:45,269 --> 02:13:47,063
Sqweeks! Hey, hey...

2203
02:13:47,563 --> 02:13:49,440
Look, I need you to blow that gun up!

2204
02:13:51,818 --> 02:13:52,986
Mommy.

2205
02:13:53,069 --> 02:13:55,429
You're small and you're ugly. No one's gonna see you coming.

2206
02:13:56,906 --> 02:13:58,491
Blow it up!

2207
02:14:04,872 --> 02:14:06,541
Infernocus,

2208
02:14:06,749 --> 02:14:09,168
transform. Kill them!

2209
02:14:14,716 --> 02:14:16,634
I don't have enough ammo for that thing.

2210
02:14:16,926 --> 02:14:18,261
I got him!

2211
02:14:35,653 --> 02:14:37,864
Bee and Hot Rod are down! Autobots down!

2212
02:14:37,947 --> 02:14:39,115
Where's Prime?

2213
02:14:39,198 --> 02:14:40,366
Ay, chihuahua.

2214
02:14:40,533 --> 02:14:42,386
It's a no-go, General. We're pinned down!

2215
02:14:42,410 --> 02:14:44,787
Yeah, well, that hobgoblin stuff didn't work, did it?

2216
02:14:44,912 --> 02:14:47,123
I got a Hail Mary. How about physics?

2217
02:14:47,498 --> 02:14:48,767
Okay, I just did the simulation.

2218
02:14:48,791 --> 02:14:50,602
It's like if Tiger Woods was making a big divot

2219
02:14:50,626 --> 02:14:51,669
with his nine-iron.

2220
02:14:51,753 --> 02:14:52,962
Stu, out! Come on, man.

2221
02:14:53,629 --> 02:14:55,899
All right, there's a chunk right here that's held up by thin vines.

2222
02:14:55,923 --> 02:14:57,818
You gotta blow up those vines, use tactical nukes to blow out

2223
02:14:57,842 --> 02:14:59,135
the vines and let it swing.

2224
02:14:59,302 --> 02:15:00,320
Okay, you let gravity do the rest.

2225
02:15:00,344 --> 02:15:01,554
The chamber comes down,

2226
02:15:01,721 --> 02:15:03,157
the energy transfer stops, and the Earth is saved.

2227
02:15:03,181 --> 02:15:04,181
You're welcome.

2228
02:15:04,891 --> 02:15:06,768
I need tac-nuke authority.

2229
02:15:06,893 --> 02:15:09,288
Lennox team, we are pulling you out. Mission's over.

2230
02:15:09,312 --> 02:15:11,105
Laze targets for incoming strike fighters.

2231
02:15:11,230 --> 02:15:12,482
Then I'm ordering you to bail.

2232
02:15:12,565 --> 02:15:13,733
Roger that. Picture's up.

2233
02:15:14,192 --> 02:15:15,943
I see it, I see it.

2234
02:15:16,444 --> 02:15:19,280
We got a new target! Three o'clock high!

2235
02:15:19,697 --> 02:15:22,158
Laze the new target for incoming birds.

2236
02:15:22,325 --> 02:15:24,136
They're gonna bring that whole thing down on us.

2237
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:25,179
Hey! We're not giving up on Prime, okay?

2238
02:15:25,203 --> 02:15:26,204
He's gonna be here!

2239
02:15:26,496 --> 02:15:28,790
They just changed the whole plan. We can't get inside.

2240
02:15:28,915 --> 02:15:30,750
- What? - The operation is over.

2241
02:15:30,833 --> 02:15:31,834
We stay, we're dead.

2242
02:15:32,168 --> 02:15:33,312
I have to get in there!

2243
02:15:33,336 --> 02:15:35,088
Everybody, grab your chutes, we're bailing!

2244
02:15:39,175 --> 02:15:40,510
you.

2245
02:15:48,184 --> 02:15:49,286
Fight, fight, fight.

2246
02:15:49,310 --> 02:15:50,430
Fight's on.

2247
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:58,152
Good job, little friend.

2248
02:15:58,361 --> 02:16:00,780
- Laze the target! - Move, move, move!

2249
02:16:02,156 --> 02:16:03,156
Let's move!

2250
02:16:03,199 --> 02:16:05,868
Let's move out! We got you covered! Move!

2251
02:16:10,915 --> 02:16:12,333
Optimus.

2252
02:16:15,044 --> 02:16:16,044
Yeah!

2253
02:16:35,064 --> 02:16:37,358
You ugly mess!

2254
02:16:40,736 --> 02:16:43,823
Did you forget who I am?

2255
02:16:54,542 --> 02:16:57,378
I am Optimus Prime.

2256
02:16:57,753 --> 02:17:00,423
Autobots, attack!

2257
02:17:08,931 --> 02:17:09,932
Laze the target!

2258
02:17:10,808 --> 02:17:12,727
Laze it, laze it, laze it.

2259
02:17:13,198 --> 02:17:14,198
Laser paint confirmed.

2260
02:17:14,228 --> 02:17:15,074
Laser paint confirmed on target.

2261
02:17:15,104 --> 02:17:16,230
Come on!

2262
02:17:16,314 --> 02:17:17,794
Silver arrows, fire.

2263
02:17:18,232 --> 02:17:19,775
Missiles away, missiles away.

2264
02:17:19,984 --> 02:17:21,319
Go, go!

2265
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:23,779
Go!

2266
02:17:25,198 --> 02:17:27,700
- Come on, let's go. - I don't think I can do this.

2267
02:17:28,910 --> 02:17:29,910
Nine seconds.

2268
02:17:29,952 --> 02:17:30,953
We're going home, Izzy.

2269
02:17:33,414 --> 02:17:35,249
Mademoiselle, don't go!

2270
02:17:35,833 --> 02:17:37,210
Where is Viviane?

2271
02:17:37,293 --> 02:17:39,712
She's gone, boss. They're all chickening out.

2272
02:17:39,921 --> 02:17:42,149
What if you're wrong, Lennox? What if it doesn't work?

2273
02:17:42,173 --> 02:17:43,173
It's gonna work!

2274
02:17:43,633 --> 02:17:45,343
Look, we're doing this together, okay?

2275
02:17:45,551 --> 02:17:48,012
- Here we go. - Hit it, hit it, hit it...

2276
02:17:56,145 --> 02:17:59,232
We got to go! We're bailing.

2277
02:17:59,440 --> 02:18:01,567
- What are you doing? - It's just dusty old books.

2278
02:18:01,651 --> 02:18:02,777
What?

2279
02:18:05,238 --> 02:18:06,489
Wait!

2280
02:18:06,656 --> 02:18:08,532
She's got to be kidding me. Shit!

2281
02:18:24,799 --> 02:18:27,009
Viviane! Get in here!

2282
02:18:27,343 --> 02:18:28,844
Yes! My little lady.

2283
02:18:43,276 --> 02:18:44,694
Aah! Wait!

2284
02:18:49,115 --> 02:18:50,616
Cade!

2285
02:18:57,957 --> 02:19:00,835
Command, be advised, ignition chamber is tumbling.

2286
02:19:01,085 --> 02:19:03,254
I repeat, chamber is broke loose. It is falling.

2287
02:19:13,097 --> 02:19:15,433
The energy transfer is still continuing.

2288
02:19:15,516 --> 02:19:17,643
T-minus 55 minutes and counting.

2289
02:19:17,727 --> 02:19:19,145
I can't believe it didn't work.

2290
02:19:19,228 --> 02:19:20,455
General, I'm in my chute.

2291
02:19:20,479 --> 02:19:21,856
The chamber is still arcing power.

2292
02:19:21,981 --> 02:19:22,982
I don't think it worked.

2293
02:19:23,983 --> 02:19:25,026
- No! - Hold on!

2294
02:19:42,418 --> 02:19:44,503
Follow me. I'm gonna lead the way.

2295
02:19:48,966 --> 02:19:50,593
Okay, there it is.

2296
02:19:50,718 --> 02:19:52,887
Grab the staff, Viviane!

2297
02:19:53,262 --> 02:19:54,597
All right, go!

2298
02:20:07,068 --> 02:20:08,069
Watch out, watch out!

2299
02:20:12,740 --> 02:20:14,408
Stop the time!

2300
02:20:14,617 --> 02:20:16,118
Gonna blow your head off, Megatron!

2301
02:20:16,952 --> 02:20:18,621
Sayonara, bubblehead!

2302
02:20:35,554 --> 02:20:37,264
Megatron, kill her!

2303
02:20:50,736 --> 02:20:52,988
We were brothers once.

2304
02:20:53,114 --> 02:20:54,198
Once.

2305
02:21:21,517 --> 02:21:23,853
Oh, we're going weightless. Weightless!

2306
02:21:28,858 --> 02:21:30,526
- Grab my hand. - Yes!

2307
02:21:40,786 --> 02:21:42,246
Don't let it go!

2308
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:50,796
Quintessa, get off our planet!

2309
02:21:51,547 --> 02:21:53,382
You traitor!

2310
02:21:56,552 --> 02:21:58,762
Say hello to my friend,

2311
02:21:59,430 --> 02:22:01,390
Bumblebee.

2312
02:22:07,313 --> 02:22:09,565
Sting like a bee.

2313
02:22:27,333 --> 02:22:28,959
I'll save you!

2314
02:22:35,090 --> 02:22:36,425
I stop the time.

2315
02:23:44,868 --> 02:23:46,704
Is it tomorrow yet?

2316
02:23:51,458 --> 02:23:53,961
At the heart of every legend,

2317
02:23:54,420 --> 02:23:56,088
there is truth.

2318
02:23:58,007 --> 02:24:00,509
A few brave souls unite

2319
02:24:01,427 --> 02:24:03,512
to save their worlds.

2320
02:24:04,471 --> 02:24:06,932
We can be heroes in our own lives,

2321
02:24:08,684 --> 02:24:09,977
every one of us,

2322
02:24:10,352 --> 02:24:14,440
if we only have the courage to try.

2323
02:24:15,190 --> 02:24:17,234
You saved Prime.

2324
02:24:18,527 --> 02:24:21,739
Our fates were always intertwined.

2325
02:24:22,197 --> 02:24:26,702
But now our worlds are joined as one.

2326
02:24:27,494 --> 02:24:29,747
We need to repair our planets.

2327
02:24:30,623 --> 02:24:32,207
Work together...

2328
02:24:32,291 --> 02:24:34,918
If we wish to survive.

2329
02:24:36,003 --> 02:24:37,713
Crazy family, huh?

2330
02:24:39,882 --> 02:24:42,384
You did good, bro. Real good.

2331
02:24:44,928 --> 02:24:49,308
A dangerous secret is buried deep inside the Earth.

2332
02:24:50,184 --> 02:24:54,229
There is more to this planet than meets the eye.

2333
02:24:55,356 --> 02:24:57,650
I am Optimus Prime,

2334
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:00,903
calling all Autobots.

2335
02:25:01,904 --> 02:25:03,739
It is time

2336
02:25:04,448 --> 02:25:06,450
to come home.

2337
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:58,210
Are you lost?

2338
02:26:01,630 --> 02:26:03,298
I wouldn't do that.

2339
02:26:04,174 --> 02:26:05,968
Don't touch him.

2340
02:26:07,136 --> 02:26:08,804
He doesn't like it.

2341
02:26:09,513 --> 02:26:11,140
Who doesn't like what?

2342
02:26:12,558 --> 02:26:14,143
Unicron.

2343
02:26:15,310 --> 02:26:17,479
But I could show you how to kill him.

2344
02:26:20,509 --> 02:26:36,509
