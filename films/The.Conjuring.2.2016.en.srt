1
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,338
<i>After everything we've seen,</i>

2
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,800
<i>there isn't much that rattles
either of us anymore.</i>

3
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:54,180
<i>But this one...</i>

4
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,475
<i>This one still haunts me.</i>

5
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:14,158
<i>Two months prior to our involvement,</i>

6
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:17,536
<i>the Lutz family had fled their home
in the middle of the night,</i>

7
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:20,414
<i>claiming that the house was haunted.</i>

8
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,170
<i>The Church had reached out to us for help.</i>

9
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,797
<i>They wanted to see</i>

10
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:31,592
<i>if we could confirm the activity
that had been reported by the Lutzes.</i>

11
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,512
Mm-hmm.

12
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,306
Okay. We ready?

13
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,226
Then let's get started.

14
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,072
I'd like you to sit quietly
and close your eyes.

15
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,203
Envision yourself in a halo
of glowing white light.

16
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,331
It will protect you.

17
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,627
<i>The year before
the Lutzes moved in,</i>

18
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,796
<i>a young man named Ronny DeFeo</i>

19
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:12,299
<i>had brutally murdered his
entire family in this house.</i>

20
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,468
<i>We'd hoped to discover</i>

21
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,680
<i>if the killings had been
motivated purely by anger</i>

22
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,223
<i>or if,</i>

23
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,725
<i>as Ronny DeFeo testified in court,</i>

24
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:26,021
<i>he had been under the influence
of something demonic.</i>

25
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:08,898
<i>Stay here. Stay.</i>

26
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:36,217
<i>Kill her. Kill her.</i>

27
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,887
<i>Shoot them.</i>

28
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,680
<i>Shoot them!</i>

29
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:42,848
<i>Shoot her!</i>

30
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,800
What did you do?

31
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,644
What did you do?

32
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,103
<i>Shoot her. Kill her.</i>

33
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,480
<i>Shoot her!</i>

34
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:05,371
<i>Shoot them all.</i>

35
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,164
<i>Shoot!</i>

36
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:14,672
<i>Kill!</i>

37
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,278
<i>Kill her. Shoot her.</i>

38
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:41,156
<i>Kill her. Shoot her.</i>

39
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,253
Honey, you okay? What are you seeing?

40
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,204
Lorraine.

41
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,165
Lorraine, what is happening?

42
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,584
I have to see.

43
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,419
We're through. We're through.
It's time to come back.

44
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,675
What is happening?

45
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,599
It wants to show me.

46
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:11,682
Lorraine!

47
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,100
Lorraine!

48
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,061
Oh, God! Oh!

49
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,271
Honey.

50
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:18,856
Honey.

51
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,694
It's okay.

52
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,578
It's okay.

53
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,499
Ed.

54
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,045
This is as close to hell
as I ever wanna get.

55
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,870
- Damn kids!
- Really.

56
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,080
Yeah.

57
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,125
Oh, my gosh.

58
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,671
Keith and I are going to sneak
out tonight with his friend, Michael,

59
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,506
who wants to meet you, by the way.

60
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:11,260
No way.
If my mum ever found out, I'd be dead.

61
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,970
So don't get caught, you priss.

62
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,263
Here, hold this.

63
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,849
Gotta give you back
the spirit board that we made.

64
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,606
I think I'll let Keith French kiss me.

65
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,650
What? No way!

66
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:27,818
What you two doing?

67
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,904
Janet, give that to me.

68
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,823
And get inside, both of you.

69
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,491
Go.

70
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,718
M-M-M-M-Margaret.

71
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,469
Margaret! Johnny!

72
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,804
Janet! Billy!

73
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,392
Hello. How was your day?

74
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:01,727
Not good.

75
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:02,978
Why? What happened?

76
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,105
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

77
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,356
All right, then.

78
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:08,692
W-w-what's up?

79
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,569
B-B-B-B-Billy?

80
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,945
Shut up, Peter.

81
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,113
Lesbo!

82
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,865
What, are you talking about your mum?

83
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,450
Oh.

84
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,951
Thank you, Camilla.

85
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,286
No problem!

86
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,872
He's just a wanker. Ignore him.

87
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:24,666
Okay.

88
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,130
Mum's gonna kill me.
What did you do now?

89
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,965
It wasn't me,
it was Camilla.

90
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,675
What did you do with Camilla?

91
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,135
It's a long story.

92
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,054
Boys!
Watch the road!

93
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,684
- Janet!
- Up you go, Billy.

94
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,645
Ow!

95
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,104
Come on.

96
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,234
I'm saying I won't be able
to pay my rent this month.

97
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,447
No. I talked to them,
and they put me through to you.

98
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,324
<i>Please keep calm...</i>

99
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,242
I am being calm.

100
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:02,245
Well, I don't understand
why you can't help me.

101
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,706
No.

102
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,292
No. He hasn't paid a penny
of child maintenance for three months.

103
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,253
- We're home!
- I see. That's bloody brilliant.

104
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,798
- Hi, Mum!
- You have a good afternoon as well.

105
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,096
Janet.

106
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,555
Are things not bad enough around here,

107
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,599
that I've got to get a call
from your headmistress

108
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,434
who says that you was caught smoking?

109
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,978
I wasn't! I wasn't smoking. I promise.

110
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,064
- Did you get the biscuits?
- Did you just not hear me?

111
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:30,607
I talked to Mrs. More on the telephone.

112
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,234
How can you stand there
and lie to me like that?

113
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,402
I'm not lying!

114
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,737
Yes, she is! It's all over the school.

115
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:36,905
She was smoking with Camilla.

116
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,032
Shut up! You are such a liar, Johnny!

117
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,785
Mum! You said
we would get me some...

118
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,662
No, Billy. I didn't get
any bloody biscuits

119
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,706
because we don't have any bloody money!

120
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,625
<i>... and he walked a crooked mile.</i>
<i>He found a crooked sixpence upon ...</i>

121
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:58,927
Mum's coming.

122
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,221
You better quit messing with that
and brush your teeth!

123
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,014
All right.

124
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,689
Sounds like the whole city's
burning down in here.

125
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:11,940
Look what I found!

126
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,400
Biscuits!

127
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,112
But you said we
don't have any money.

128
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,489
Well, I've been meaning
to quit smoking anyway.

129
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,324
- Margaret?
- Yes?

130
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,910
Have you got your
school uniform for tomorrow?

131
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,537
Yes, Mum. I'm getting it.

132
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,330
Johnny, did you brush your teeth?

133
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,665
I did it already.

134
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,834
Come on, Billy.
Time for bed.

135
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:32,753
Coming, Mum.

136
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,839
Put that down, Johnny.
Come on. Time for bed.

137
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,934
Oh, where'd that come from?

138
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,395
Camilla and I made it at school.

139
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,856
Ugh. That doesn't look right.

140
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,692
It really works, I swear.

141
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,028
We already asked it all sorts of stuff.

142
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,863
Come on, I'll show you.

143
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,200
All right.

144
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,743
What should I ask?

145
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,162
I don't know. Whatever you want.

146
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:08,330
Okay.

147
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,502
My sister and I want to know...

148
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,714
Are there any spirits here
that want to communicate with us?

149
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,560
Is Dad ever coming home?

150
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,571
Are there any spirits here
who can answer my question?

151
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,042
Don't worry about it.

152
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,961
It's just a stupid game.

153
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,128
It isn't real.

154
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,383
Why're you pounding on the door?

155
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,301
I'm not.

156
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,844
You're barmy.

157
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,558
You know, she's
pushing the boundary, isn't it?

158
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:16,977
She says she wasn't smoking.

159
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,437
I don't think you should
agonize over it, Peg.

160
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,482
God knows I had my share
of fags at school, didn't you?

161
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,650
Oh, lots.

162
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,443
But it's not what she did that bothers me.

163
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,321
It's that, she don't listen
to what I say anymore, Pegs.

164
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,615
Just a phase, isn't it?

165
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,784
I mean, I can punish her,
but then I feel guilty

166
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,869
because I know it's not really her fault.

167
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,372
She loves her dad

168
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,417
and she took it very hard
when he left. Poor thing.

169
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,753
But I can't just let it go either, can I?

170
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,215
I'm loath to ask, but have you
told Richard about it?

171
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,925
I would, if I ever saw him.

172
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,468
Sod.

173
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,345
Now, it's like I'm having to do both jobs.

174
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:56,057
I'm half the mum I was before.
I'm just rubbish, Peggy.

175
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,601
You are not, Peggy.
You're too hard on yourself.

176
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,109
- Ooh!
- Oh!

177
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,821
- This sodding house!
- Oh!

178
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,536
<i>We are back with real life ghost hunters,</i>

179
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,163
<i>Ed and Lorraine Warren,</i>

180
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,666
talking about their experiences
at the Amityville house.

181
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,127
And now we're gonna talk to my next guest,

182
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,920
Dr. Steven Kaplan,

183
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,840
<i>who says that
the investigations the Warrens conducted</i>

184
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,385
<i>into the Amityville haunting
is a load of hogwash.</i>

185
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,012
Why is that?

186
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,058
Well, it's been well established
that Amityville was a blatant hoax.

187
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,642
- But that hasn't stopped--
- That's never been proven.

188
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:40,852
Yes, it has.

189
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,395
The Lutz family made everything up

190
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,522
so they could profit off
of all the publicity.

191
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,107
<i>That's just not true.</i>

192
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,942
<i>Look, we see this all the time.</i>

193
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:51,362
It's very easy to sit on the outside
and pick apart their story.

194
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,906
But it's something very different

195
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,158
to have been there and
experienced it for yourself.

196
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,493
I don't need to go to the moon

197
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,120
to know that it's not
made out of green cheese.

198
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:03,166
Listen, Ed Warren's never seen a house
that he didn't think was haunted.

199
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,795
<i>And by the time his wife is done
blowing smoke and ringing bells</i>

200
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,506
they've got everybody else
believing in ghosts, too.

201
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,341
What exactly are you a doctor of, anyway?

202
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,802
Come on, Warren.
Try and show a little class, will you?

203
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,136
I'm not gonna show class to somebody

204
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,679
who's sitting here telling
lies about my wife and me.

205
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,057
- Be careful who you call a liar.
- What are you gonna do about it?

206
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,687
We go on these shows to inform people.

207
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,357
But every time I open my mouth,
another one of these little--

208
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,025
- Ed.
- Ass...

209
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,652
Academics...

210
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,529
Pops up.

211
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,322
Tries to undo everything we've done.

212
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,616
- Could you please take a breath?
- I know. I know. I know.

213
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,910
I'm counting to 10. I'm counting to 10!

214
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,125
<i>All right, Billy.</i>

215
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,876
You ready to do a speech?

216
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,799
There was a crooked man
and he walked a crooked mile.

217
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,250
He found a crooked sixp...

218
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,647
It's all right. We'll just try again.

219
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,023
You ready?

220
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,527
He found a crooked sixpence
upon a crooked stile.

221
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,227
He bought a crooked cat
which caught a crooked mouse.

222
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,527
And they all lived together
in a little crooked house.

223
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,832
Good boy!

224
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,626
You're getting so good.
Now you may have a biscuit.

225
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,044
Biscuit!

226
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,380
All right. Come on. Off to bed with you.

227
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,175
- Night, Mom.
- Good night, darling.

228
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,305
Now, don't eat too many of those

229
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,640
or you'll wake up thirsty
in the middle of the night. All right?

230
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,142
I won't.

231
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:45,393
You promise?

232
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,647
- Night, boys.
- Night, Mom.

233
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,104
No.

234
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:12,897
Help.

235
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,650
Stop it.

236
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,237
No.

237
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,531
Janet?

238
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,491
- Please.
- Janet?

239
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,119
Janet, wake up! You're dreaming.

240
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,216
This is my house.

241
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:42,427
No. No, it's not.

242
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,053
Go away.

243
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,973
Who are you? What are you doing here?

244
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,517
Playing a game with Billy.

245
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:51,144
Leave Billy alone.

246
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,895
Janet, who are you talking to?

247
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,605
You have to go away.

248
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,066
You're the one trespassing.

249
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,318
Janet, wake up.

250
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,695
I'll tell my mum if you don't stop.

251
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,280
I'll break her neck.

252
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,115
No, please.

253
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,326
Dying with Billy.

254
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,493
No.

255
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:09,829
Janet.

256
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,205
Janet, it's all right.

257
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,124
It's all right, come on.

258
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,879
Go back to sleep.

259
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:52,705
Stay away from Billy!

260
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,248
Leave us alone. You hear me?

261
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,834
Janet, what are you doing?
There's no one here.

262
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,295
<i>This is my house.</i>

263
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,961
Mum! Mum!

264
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,755
Mum! Mum!

265
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,382
Billy? What's wrong?

266
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:33,593
There's someone in my tent!

267
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:34,844
What?

268
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,513
There's someone in my tent!

269
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,229
Mummy.

270
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,542
See? Nothing.

271
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,003
You just had a bad dream. That's all.

272
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,595
Go to your room.

273
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:42,745
Oh, my God.

274
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:43,996
Janet!

275
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,041
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
What're you doing down here?

276
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,587
I think I've been sleepwalking again.

277
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,673
What do you mean "again"?

278
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:55,424
You all right?

279
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:59,345
You're burning up. Come on.

280
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,722
Come on, let's get you back upstairs, eh?

281
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,768
Think you better stay home
from school tomorrow.

282
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,897
Come on. Let's get you back into bed, eh?

283
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:27,081
<i>You know I want to be a hair
artiste and become a credible painter.</i>

284
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,294
<i>Don't give me any of your
brute hype and airy-fairy hair...</i>

285
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,472
<i>-...back 30 years. -</i>

286
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:47,143
<i>Now, I've gone back to the age of 10.</i>

287
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,019
<i>Everything is shot in soft focus.</i>

288
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,147
<i>Some bogus excuses.</i>

289
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,898
<i>When're you gonna leave
that posh school, eh?</i>

290
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,984
<i>And get yourself a proper
man's job down--</i>

291
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:08,831
<i>Yes, a Christmas carol.</i>

292
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,207
- <i>Which one?</i>
- <i>All of them.</i>

293
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:20,009
<i>And within minutes--</i>

294
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:25,264
<i>Mr. Chairman, Mr. President,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

295
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,101
<i>I stand before you tonight,</i>

296
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,272
<i>in my Red Star chiffon evening gown.</i>

297
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,087
Hodgson residence.

298
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,508
Oh. Hi, Mum.

299
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,928
Yeah, a little.

300
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,890
I just ate, so I'm not really that hungry.

301
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:27,368
Yeah. I'm here.

302
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:31,247
Do you know when you'll be home?

303
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,124
All right.

304
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:35,960
Bye, Mum.

305
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,518
<i>Yes, I am an iron lady.</i>

306
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:56,397
<i>The Iron Lady of the Western world.</i>

307
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,486
<i>No, no. You are a bad one, you know, you.</i>

308
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,905
<i>Mother dearest, I'm sorry I am late.</i>

309
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:07,867
<i>But I had to stop off
to get you a health-giving brown loaf.</i>

310
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,620
<i>I do not wish to hear
about that sort of thing.</i>

311
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:12,830
<i>I want you to come over here,</i>

312
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:15,249
<i>if you don't mind me, and let your old mum</i>

313
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:17,209
<i>scrape the fluff out of your belly button.</i>

314
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:22,214
<i>Nice and clean for the big parade
and very good on Sunday.</i>

315
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,425
<i>I shall be there, you know, watching you.</i>

316
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,212
My house!

317
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:29,490
You're up early.

318
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,701
Hey. Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

319
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:34,370
You get inspired?

320
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,455
I don't know if I'd call it that.

321
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,582
I had this crazy dream.

322
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,334
Saw this thing.

323
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:41,961
When I woke up...

324
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,672
Couldn't get it out of my head.

325
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,049
So, thought maybe this might help.

326
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:07,486
Hey, I know I'm no Picasso,
but I didn't think it was that bad.

327
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,708
We need to stop.

328
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:26,755
We could still do the lectures,
but no new cases.

329
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,799
At least not for a little while.

330
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,385
All right. Uh...

331
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:33,971
Could I ask why?

332
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:39,518
Because if it's the TV shows and publicity
then we won't do that.

333
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,187
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

334
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:43,731
Morning.

335
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:52,990
Do you trust me?

336
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,576
You know I do.

337
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:57,578
Then please trust me now.

338
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,331
Okay.

339
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,686
Oh. What are you doing that for?

340
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:25,439
In case I go sleep walking again.

341
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:52,568
Mum?

342
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:59,241
Johnny?

343
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:55,208
Janet! What's wrong? What is it?

344
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,252
There's someone in the room!

345
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,422
There's no one! What you talking about?

346
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,850
- There's someone in our room!
- What!

347
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:13,393
Our beds are shaking up and down!

348
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,644
Janet, I swear to God
if you're making it up--

349
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,772
I got bit. I'm not lying! He bit me! Look!

350
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,191
Oh, my God.

351
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,216
Have you two been playing with this?

352
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:46,593
Taking turns scaring the wits
out of each other?

353
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,387
No wonder I can't get
a good night's sleep!

354
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,806
- But, Mum--
- No! I don't wanna hear another word.

355
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,766
Now get back to bed, the lot of you!

356
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:04,778
Help us!

357
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:06,947
- Please help!
- Help!

358
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,616
Peggy! Vic, open the door!

359
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:10,909
Open the door!

360
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,994
I've seen it with my own eyes.

361
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,122
The bloody thing
went clear across the room.

362
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,331
But--

363
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,459
- Well, then...
- What? Well?

364
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:21,545
It's cold.
Well, I've been through the house.

365
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,964
Top to bottom. There's no one there.

366
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,882
What about Margaret
and Janet's room? Did you--

367
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,551
No, no. I looked there,
every room.

368
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,386
Even went down the basement.
There's no one there.

369
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:30,887
What's he doing?

370
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,349
We've taught him to ring the bell
when he wants to go.

371
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,934
Do you wanna let him out, Billy?

372
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:48,280
Look!
The police are at our house!

373
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,282
Now, what they doing here?

374
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,284
- Oh, I called them.
- What?

375
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,162
Well, I mean, it's got to be somebody
playing a joke on you, right?

376
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:56,830
It's got to be. Yeah.

377
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,903
So, ma'am. You didn't actually
see the man yourself?

378
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,362
No.

379
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:32,699
But I don't think she's making it up.
Not anymore.

380
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:36,077
Well, look.
There has to be some sort of explanation.

381
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,580
Sir, that's why we're here, okay?

382
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:01,478
Bring me a chair from the kitchen.

383
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:24,459
It's coming from inside the wall.

384
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,963
Then what? Mice, maybe?

385
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,881
Big bloody mouse.

386
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,771
Well, there's nothing
we can do about that.

387
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:47,774
We can file an incident report
and we'll stand by it if anyone asks.

388
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:48,942
But that's about all.

389
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:51,069
A report? Oh. That's brilliant.

390
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,738
Every problem I have,
there's another bloody form to fill out!

391
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,240
Oh, for God's sake.

392
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:57,993
Listen.

393
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:00,870
I think this is a bit beyond us.

394
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,498
The priest at our church
is a family friend.

395
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,166
I'll ask him to call on you.

396
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,338
<i>...to us and tell us that...</i>

397
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:14,968
<i>There are still some honest
people left in the world.</i>

398
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:19,389
<i>And she said, what happened was,
that she was at the grocery store.</i>

399
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:22,017
<i>She left her wallet there,
at the grocery store.</i>

400
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:25,854
<i>It had money in it, a lot of money.</i>

401
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,189
<i>And she thought, "Well,
that's that. It's gone."</i>

402
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:29,858
<i>She thought someone
was just gonna pick it up.</i>

403
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,443
<i>That's it, that's that.</i>

404
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,945
<i>But just to see what she could do,</i>

405
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,531
<i>she went back to the
grocery store and sure enough.</i>

406
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:42,329
<i>Some honest woman had picked up the wallet
and returned it to the manager there.</i>

407
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,456
<i>She got everything back.
She got her money.</i>

408
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:47,042
<i>She got everything that was in the purse.</i>

409
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:04,726
Judy?

410
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:15,695
Honey...

411
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:19,032
What's wrong?

412
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:20,700
Mom.

413
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,371
Who's that?

414
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:34,714
Go back.

415
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:03,256
Who are you?

416
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:09,721
Tell me who you are!

417
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:11,806
- Mom! Mom. Mom! Wake up!
- No!

418
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:13,057
What do you want?

419
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:22,150
I'm sorry, Lorraine.

420
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,492
Are you okay?

421
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:34,662
I'm okay.

422
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:52,513
Mrs. Hodgson.

423
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:54,057
Yes?

424
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,266
My name's Kent Allen.

425
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,936
We're with the television
news program <i>Wide Angle</i>.

426
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,687
I was hoping to have a word with you

427
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,440
about the disturbance
at your home last week.

428
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:04,525
How'd you find out about that?

429
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:07,403
The police constables filed
an incident report. It's...

430
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:09,697
Well, it's raised a few eyebrows.

431
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,536
I'd rather not have my business
spread all over the telly,

432
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,038
if you don't mind. Good day!

433
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:20,375
Is it still happening? Because if it is
getting your side of the story out

434
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:22,502
might be your best chance of finding help.

435
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,590
<i>This thing on? Okay.</i>

436
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,635
<i>Behind the doors of this
seemingly normal house</i>

437
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,220
<i>in Ponders End, North London,</i>

438
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:34,472
<i>is a family living in a nightmare.</i>

439
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:38,726
<i>I look up, and through the window,
plain as day, I see the younger girl,</i>

440
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:42,063
<i>Janet, being thrown around in the air
like she was floating.</i>

441
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:44,941
<i>So we run back inside and sure enough</i>

442
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:46,943
<i>there's little toy LEGO bricks
flying all around the room.</i>

443
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,612
<i>One of them hit me right in the face
so hard it drew blood.</i>

444
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:52,407
<i>I saw the chair slide by itself,</i>

445
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:55,243
<i>across the floor,
a distance of several feet.</i>

446
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,788
<i>I checked the chair for wires,
but could find nothing to explain it.</i>

447
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:01,249
<i>Maurice Grosse is an
engineering consultant</i>

448
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:04,252
<i>and has been investigating these claims
for the Society of Psychical Research.</i>

449
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:07,088
<i>Well, I don't think there's
any doubt about it at all.</i>

450
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:10,133
<i>The sheer number of documented
incidents in this case</i>

451
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,051
<i>is absolutely staggering.</i>

452
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:13,928
<i>But, Anita Gregory,</i>

453
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:16,597
<i>a parapsychologist and lecturer
at the Polytechnic of North London,</i>

454
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:17,932
<i>is not convinced.</i>

455
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:20,768
<i>Our principal characters here
are all children.</i>

456
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,770
<i>And children can be
very ingenious pranksters.</i>

457
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:24,605
<i>At the center of these
frightening activities</i>

458
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,357
<i>is 11-year-old Janet Hodgson.</i>

459
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:29,610
<i>I recently interviewed Janet
and her 14-year-old sister, Margaret.</i>

460
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:32,530
<i>What happened next will astonish you.</i>

461
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:36,117
<i>How does it feel
living in a haunted house?</i>

462
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:38,786
I don't know.

463
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,788
You don't get used to it.

464
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:44,292
You see, we was just a normal family
before all this.

465
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,045
It's been getting worse
since Mr. Grosse started talking to it.

466
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:49,797
How do you mean?

467
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:52,383
Like, asking it questions.

468
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,802
Saying knock twice for "yes"
and one for "no."

469
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:56,345
That sort of thing.

470
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:59,140
I wonder what would happen
if we tried talking to it now?

471
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,143
Is anybody there?

472
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,689
Is anybody there
who wishes to communicate?

473
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:15,948
I say again, is anybody there?

474
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:21,829
Nothing.

475
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,748
Well, it isn't a jukebox, is it?

476
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:44,936
Janet, are you all right?

477
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,321
Janet?

478
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,038
Mmm.

479
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:05,706
Janet.

480
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,461
Janet, are you feeling all right?

481
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:14,048
Stop calling me Janet!

482
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:16,884
Isn't that your name?

483
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:20,138
Janet's asleep...

484
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:24,100
And I'm talking.

485
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,440
Well, what should I call you?

486
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:46,122
What is your name?

487
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,835
You don't belong here.

488
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:55,131
My name is Maurice Grosse.

489
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,591
Who are you?

490
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:01,304
This is my home.

491
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,431
Get out now!

492
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:07,852
No. This is not your house.
Now, what's your name?

493
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:11,105
Knock, knock.

494
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:14,942
Very well.

495
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:17,653
Who's there?

496
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,782
Bill. Bill.

497
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,784
Bill. Bill.

498
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:26,204
Bill who?

499
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:35,129
My name is Bill Wilkins
and I'm 72 years old.

500
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,549
Where do you come from?

501
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:44,180
I come from the grave.

502
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:46,974
How did you die?

503
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:52,897
I went blind and had a hemorrhage.

504
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:57,485
And I fell asleep
and I died in the chair in the corner.

505
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:02,490
Why have you come here?

506
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:07,245
I like to hear them scream.

507
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:13,501
Why don't you just leave us alone?

508
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:15,044
Shut up, you old cow!

509
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,015
Janet, darling.

510
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:29,767
Darling, are you all right?

511
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,018
I'm sorry.

512
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:32,561
Janet.

513
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:45,366
<i>Peggy, what am I gonna do?</i>

514
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:46,575
Oh...

515
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:49,120
You don't need to think about it tonight.

516
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:51,706
And you and the kids can stay here
as long as you like.

517
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,291
Mum.

518
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,627
Billy, aren't you supposed
to be getting ready for bed?

519
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,880
I thought you might like some biscuits.

520
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:05,386
Oh...

521
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,891
Oh, thank you!

522
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,500
<i>There was a crooked man</i>
<i>and he walked a crooked mile.</i>

523
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,400
<i>He found a crooked sixpence</i>
<i>upon a crooked stile.</i>

524
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,300
<i>He bought a crooked cat</i>
<i>which caught a crooked mouse...</i>

525
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,814
Baron?

526
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:58,707
Baron?

527
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:34,205
There was a crooked man

528
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,805
and he walked a crooked mile.

529
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,585
Mum! Mum!

530
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:44,545
Mum! Mum!

531
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:47,256
- What happened? What is it?
- The Crooked Man!

532
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:49,216
What? Crooked what?
What are you talking about, darling?

533
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:50,718
- The Crooked Man!
- Calm down!

534
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:52,219
Just tell me what happened.

535
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:53,554
- What?
- What is it?

536
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:55,222
I don't know.
I think he's been walking around--

537
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:01,480
The crooked man stepped forth
and rang the crooked bell.

538
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:06,080
And thus his crooked soul
spiralled into a crooked hell.

539
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,500
Murdered his crooked family
and laughed a crooked laugh.

540
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:30,966
Janet!

541
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:33,135
Janet?

542
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:36,138
Oh, my God! No!

543
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,849
Someone get an ambulance!

544
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:43,687
<i>This is my home.</i>

545
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,648
<i>Get out now.</i>

546
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:49,902
<i>No. This is not your house.
Now, what's your name?</i>

547
00:58:50,653 --> 00:58:52,112
<i>Knock, knock.</i>

548
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:55,115
<i>Very well. Who's there?</i>

549
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,370
<i>Bill. Bill.</i>

550
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,455
<i>Bill. Bill.</i>

551
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:03,958
<i>Bill who?</i>

552
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:11,423
<i>My name is Bill Wilkins
and I'm 72 years old.</i>

553
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:15,469
What do you make of that voice?

554
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:18,180
He sounds confused.

555
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:20,266
Is he senile?

556
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:23,561
The voice on this tape

557
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:26,981
is coming from an 11-year-old girl.

558
00:59:34,697 --> 00:59:36,991
The family's reached out
to the Church for help?

559
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:38,200
Yes.

560
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:41,745
But truthfully, we've been
reluctant to get involved.

561
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:44,164
The case has turned into
a media circus over there.

562
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:46,166
They're calling it "England's Amityville."

563
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,501
Great.

564
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:49,003
You're afraid it's a hoax.

565
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:53,424
The Church's ability to help people
depends on its reputation.

566
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:56,176
So, what do you want us to do?

567
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,137
We'd like you to fly to London

568
00:59:58,554 --> 01:00:02,600
for three days to act
as our unofficial eyes and ears.

569
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,019
Now, you don't have to do anything.

570
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:08,022
If it is a hoax, you just
turn around and leave.

571
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,607
But if it's not...

572
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:14,445
Then there is a family in London
that desperately needs our help.

573
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:20,034
Thank you for your faith in us.

574
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:21,910
- All right. Well, just let me know.
- Okay.

575
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,709
I told him we'd talk about it.

576
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:31,795
There's nothing to talk about.

577
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,088
Honey, you heard him.

578
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:34,590
They don't want us to get involved.

579
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:36,216
Just observe and report back.

580
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,137
There have always been cases
we've turned down.

581
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:42,598
There has never been a family
that we've refused to help.

582
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,560
I had a vision in Amityville.

583
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:51,065
It was the same one I had seven years ago.

584
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:58,072
I had a premonition of your death.

585
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:03,952
Wait. That's why you locked
yourself away for eight days?

586
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,245
You saw my death?

587
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,997
You've seen it, too.

588
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,167
The demon in your painting is real.

589
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:13,170
We have both seen the same inhuman spirit.

590
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:15,923
It's a warning. If we keep doing this,

591
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,675
you are going to die.

592
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,763
Your visions are a gift from God.

593
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:26,433
And if God is showing you my death,
then he's doing it for a reason.

594
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,770
Maybe you're meant
to prevent it from happening.

595
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,272
Come on.

596
01:01:32,648 --> 01:01:34,775
We don't run from fights.

597
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,285
If we go...

598
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,079
If we do this...

599
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:50,666
You have to promise me
that we're just there to observe.

600
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:53,836
If anything turns out
dangerous in any way,

601
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:57,131
we're gonna tell the Church,
and we're gonna get out.

602
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:58,507
Promise me.

603
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:02,469
Promise me, Ed.

604
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:06,306
I promise.

605
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:17,192
Mr. and Mrs. Warren, I'm Maurice Grosse.

606
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,194
Thank you so much for coming.

607
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:23,031
I believe you're gonna be staying
at the Hodgsons' house. Is that right?

608
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:24,700
Always better to be in the mix.

609
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:26,326
Oh, yeah. I agree.

610
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:30,956
You didn't have to do this.

611
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:33,000
- So kind of you.
- It was a complimentary...

612
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,710
This is it.

613
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:35,919
Thank you very much.

614
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,756
- How you doing? You all right?
- I'm all right. How are the kids?

615
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:39,965
Yeah. They're fine.

616
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:41,508
Here we are.

617
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:44,720
There we go.

618
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,765
Ed, we've managed to capture
some amazing things.

619
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,933
I think you'll be very
impressed when you see.

620
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,061
Great. I'd like to listen
to those tapes again, too.

621
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:55,022
You've got some really
interesting stuff in there.

622
01:02:57,357 --> 01:03:00,027
Vic Nottingham.
Hi, Vic.

623
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:01,278
How are you? Ed Warren.

624
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:02,905
Hello, Ed.

625
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:05,365
How are you?
And this is Peggy, Peggy Hodgson.

626
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,075
- Nice to meet you. Ed Warren.
- How do you do?

627
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:08,577
- This is my wife, Lorraine.
- How do you do?

628
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:10,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

629
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,371
Well, I'll be off then, Peg.

630
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:12,748
Will you tell the kids I said hello?

631
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:14,374
Yeah. Of course, I will. Nice to meet you.

632
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,542
- Nice meeting you.
- You too, hon.

633
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:18,212
- So, here we are, Peggy.
- All right. Do come in.

634
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,422
It's just me and Janet here now.

635
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:22,299
My other kids are staying with them.

636
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:25,594
This is where the girls used to sleep,
but we don't use it anymore.

637
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:26,762
Why not?

638
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,056
Well, most of the activity
centered in this room.

639
01:03:29,223 --> 01:03:31,391
We were quite afraid
that someone might get hurt,

640
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,060
which is why we keep it locked.

641
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:35,062
I understand that Janet has levitated.

642
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:36,271
Did that happen in here as well?

643
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:37,648
- Yeah, more than once.
- Yeah.

644
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:39,274
We've got photographs of that as well.

645
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:42,486
I'd like to hear Mrs. Hodgson's story
from her, if you don't mind.

646
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:52,621
The neighbors donated them
and I hung them up,

647
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:55,082
hoping they'd keep things
from moving around.

648
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:00,587
Has it worked?

649
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:03,340
No. We can hear it all night.

650
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:26,864
Hi, there. I'm Lorraine.

651
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:31,785
Mind if I have a seat?

652
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:42,963
Do you know why I'm here?

653
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,426
Well, your mom has told me
about what's been going on

654
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,803
and I'm here to help, if I can.

655
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:51,430
Would you like to talk about it?

656
01:04:56,184 --> 01:05:00,564
You know, when I was about your age,
um, I was visiting my mom at a hospital

657
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:03,066
and I saw an angel.

658
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:06,403
Yeah.

659
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:11,199
It was standing next to
a little boy's bed.

660
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:15,370
It was just gently touching his cheek
and then it stopped.

661
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,164
And it looked right at me.

662
01:05:17,331 --> 01:05:20,334
Of course, my mom and the nurses
did not believe me,

663
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,085
but I knew it was real.

664
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:28,842
Look, I know how it is.

665
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:33,013
I know what it's like to lose your friends
because you're different.

666
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:39,770
But I also know that
one person can change everything.

667
01:05:39,937 --> 01:05:42,689
And you just have to open up to them.

668
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:53,700
How did you know you could trust
the people you opened up to?

669
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:55,494
I didn't.

670
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,496
Sometimes I got hurt.

671
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:02,876
And it took a long time,

672
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:06,380
but I finally found someone
who believed me.

673
01:06:09,925 --> 01:06:11,885
What did you do then?

674
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:15,472
I married him.

675
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:29,736
I'm just so tired.

676
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:34,408
I can't sleep here.

677
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:41,915
I used to go to the medical room at school
and they let me sleep there

678
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,584
because I was so worn out.

679
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,630
But now I can't even do that.

680
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:56,304
Everyone's afraid of me.

681
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,476
I got no friends.

682
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,688
No place I can go to.

683
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:11,611
It makes me feel like I'm not normal.

684
01:07:12,446 --> 01:07:16,950
You know, whatever is doing this to you
wants you to feel this way.

685
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,119
But why?

686
01:07:19,286 --> 01:07:22,330
Because that's what makes it stronger.

687
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,375
Around the time this all started,

688
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,462
Janet started waking up here
in the middle of the night.

689
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:33,133
This is the spot that Janet said
Bill Wilkins died, right here.

690
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,469
Where'd you get it from?

691
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:37,387
Uh...

692
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:40,974
My ex-husband bought all the furniture
with the house when we moved in.

693
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:43,018
If you don't mind me asking...

694
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:45,187
Uh, is your ex-husband
still in the picture?

695
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:46,354
Nope.

696
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:48,899
I'm sorry to hear that.

697
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:52,903
Any chance of reconciliation?

698
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,989
He had twins with a woman
from round the corner.

699
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,326
So I'm gonna take that as a "no."

700
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:04,039
- Yeah, it's been a lot to deal with.
- Hmm.

701
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:07,167
He took all the music the day he left.

702
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:08,835
I know it must feel like that sometimes--

703
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,171
No. I mean, literally.
He took all the records.

704
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:14,424
My kids used to love listening
to his Elvis collection.

705
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,843
- They've been through so much.
- Hmm.

706
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:19,179
And now, all this is happening on top.

707
01:08:19,346 --> 01:08:20,847
Yeah. The timing isn't a coincidence.

708
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:23,350
Negative entities often
feed off emotional distress.

709
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,019
They like to kick you when you're down.

710
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,688
That hardly seems fair.

711
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:30,899
No, it really isn't.

712
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:33,527
Do you know when
the voice is gonna speak?

713
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:37,114
Sometimes.

714
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,698
And when it does,

715
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:41,201
does it feel like
it's coming from inside you?

716
01:08:44,955 --> 01:08:45,956
No.

717
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:49,543
More like it's coming from behind me.

718
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,462
Like I'm being used.

719
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:57,134
Does it ever say things just to you?

720
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,302
That only you can hear?

721
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:06,059
What does it say?

722
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,898
It said it wants to hurt you.

723
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,235
When did it say that?

724
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,410
Right now.

725
01:09:33,545 --> 01:09:35,297
Do we really need that?

726
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:37,465
We'd like to be
able to prove to the Church

727
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:39,134
that she's not making the voice herself.

728
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:40,594
So, by holding the water in her mouth,

729
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,805
we'll be able to show
that it's not some form of ventriloquism.

730
01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:46,141
Does she have to be in the chair?

731
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:47,392
Just...

732
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:49,603
It makes me sick to see her
sitting there like that.

733
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,606
We know it's hard, but the spirit
has shown an attachment to this spot.

734
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:55,775
It'll be easier for Ed to contact it
if she's sitting there.

735
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,280
You'll be all right.

736
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,203
You ready for this?

737
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,121
I guess so.

738
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:14,044
It's December the 21st, 1977.

739
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:17,631
This is Ed and Lorraine Warren,
sitting with Peggy and Janet Hodgson.

740
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,008
Also present is Maurice Grosse.

741
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:22,344
All right. Let's get started.

742
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:37,400
If there's something here that would
like to communicate with us,

743
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,653
we're all ears. Speak up.

744
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:50,830
What do you want
with this girl and her family?

745
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:07,389
It says it won't talk with you
all looking at me like this.

746
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:09,224
Strange! I wonder why not?

747
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:12,018
It's not been shy about
talking up until now.

748
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:14,729
How about if we all turn our backs?

749
01:11:15,063 --> 01:11:16,273
Think it'll speak if we do that?

750
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:18,608
Maybe.

751
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:20,860
Well...

752
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:23,905
Let's try this again.

753
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:44,968
So what do you think, Bill?

754
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:46,678
We've given you your privacy.

755
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,596
Now come on out and talk to us.

756
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:10,243
<i>Here I come.</i>

757
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,915
Am I talking to the spirit
that's oppressing this family?

758
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,589
<i>Is that what I am?</i>

759
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:25,800
<i>Is that what I'm doing?</i>

760
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:27,510
Yes.

761
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,929
And I have come to put a stop to it.

762
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,599
Do you know who I am?

763
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:36,269
<i>Ed.</i>

764
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:38,938
<i>Eddie.</i>

765
01:12:40,315 --> 01:12:41,524
<i>Edward.</i>

766
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:45,362
Ed is fine.

767
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:50,950
<i>Your father called you Edward.</i>

768
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:53,536
Not true.

769
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,955
My father called me Ed,
just like everybody else.

770
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:03,797
Come on, Bill.
You're not a psychiatrist

771
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:05,548
and I'm not here to talk about my father.

772
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,884
Let's get down to business,
what do you say?

773
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:09,052
Hmm?

774
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,515
Why don't you
just leave these people alone?

775
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,813
Because this is my house!

776
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,982
It's not your house.

777
01:13:25,235 --> 01:13:26,861
Yes, it is.

778
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:29,989
I come here to see my family,

779
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:32,826
but they're not here now.

780
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,828
That's because you're dead.

781
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:37,831
If your family did live here,
they're long gone now.

782
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:44,879
Where are they?

783
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:49,843
I don't know.
If I did, maybe I could help you.

784
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:52,846
I don't need your help.

785
01:13:53,847 --> 01:13:56,015
Then why don't you just move on?

786
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:02,105
I don't believe in that.

787
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:06,067
Why not, hmm?

788
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:09,195
What would be so wrong
with going to heaven?

789
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,702
I

790
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:17,078
am not

791
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:18,746
a heaven man!

792
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,294
Well, I got news for you, Bill.

793
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:26,713
You see, I don't care what you believe in.

794
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:29,549
You see this?

795
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:42,312
Help... it... let... go.

796
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:47,734
Help... It... Let... Go!

797
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:23,478
<i>Are you sensing a presence?</i>

798
01:15:23,645 --> 01:15:24,938
<i>No, just the opposite.</i>

799
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:26,147
<i>I'm not sensing anything.</i>

800
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:31,110
We could be looking
at hysterical neurosis.

801
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:33,863
That would explain
the multiple personalities

802
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,490
and hallucinations.

803
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:38,451
That doesn't feel right, either.

804
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:39,786
Well...

805
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:43,122
I can't explain it.
My heart is telling me to believe them.

806
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,708
I heard that voice with my own ears,

807
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:48,711
but all I can sense is their own fear.

808
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,130
I can't seem to see beyond that.

809
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:11,484
I don't think I can sleep
this far away from you.

810
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:13,403
Well, you're gonna.

811
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:16,990
It'll give you something
to look forward to when we get home.

812
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:33,006
Oh, love. I wish you wouldn't do that.

813
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,924
It helps me sleep.

814
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,010
At least I know I'm not going anywhere.

815
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:58,031
I didn't smoke, Mum.

816
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,240
Eh?

817
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:05,413
That day with Camilla at school.

818
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,290
I was holding the cigarette,

819
01:17:07,457 --> 01:17:09,626
but I wasn't going to take
a puff. I swear.

820
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:14,464
I just wanted to look cool
in front of her.

821
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:16,090
It was stupid.

822
01:17:17,592 --> 01:17:18,801
Oh, love.

823
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:22,930
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

824
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:26,643
Oh, darling.

825
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:16,192
Help!

826
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:19,654
Help!

827
01:18:28,246 --> 01:18:29,247
Hmm.

828
01:20:23,069 --> 01:20:24,111
Janet!

829
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:25,822
Ah!

830
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:29,700
Janet?

831
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:31,035
Oh, my God.

832
01:20:31,202 --> 01:20:32,537
Janet?

833
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:34,831
Janet?

834
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:36,082
- Help!
- Janet?

835
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:37,583
Janet!

836
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:40,086
Please help me!

837
01:20:40,253 --> 01:20:41,420
Mum!

838
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:44,423
Please! Mum!

839
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:46,634
- Janet!
- Help! Get me out!

840
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:47,885
There's somebody in here!

841
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,220
I can't open it!

842
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:50,638
Mum!

843
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:52,890
Help me!

844
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,063
Janet!

845
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:01,941
Janet!

846
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:04,694
- What's going on?
- There's someone in there with Janet!

847
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:07,864
I can't get it open!

848
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,740
Get the key. Go get the key now!

849
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:15,955
Janet! Hold on! We're coming!

850
01:21:17,874 --> 01:21:19,876
I got the key! I got the key!

851
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:21,127
Okay. Okay.

852
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:22,795
Come on.

853
01:21:26,674 --> 01:21:27,800
Janet, we're coming!

854
01:21:30,428 --> 01:21:31,429
Janet.

855
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:33,890
Get it off her! Please get it off her!

856
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:37,977
What was that?

857
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:39,812
There was someone in here!

858
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,315
I saw him with me own eyes.

859
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:43,941
He did this to my girl.

860
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:01,834
<i>This is the bite wound
Janet received the first night.</i>

861
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:04,503
It's faded a bit here,
but you can still make it out.

862
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:08,132
Wow. That's pretty distinctive.

863
01:22:08,341 --> 01:22:09,467
Two missing teeth.

864
01:22:09,634 --> 01:22:11,677
That's right. And it's too big
for one of the children.

865
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:14,263
You think this was the spirit?
This Bill Wilkins?

866
01:22:14,472 --> 01:22:15,890
I tracked down the home owner.

867
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,434
And it turns out,
the owner's father lived there.

868
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:19,810
His name was William Wilkins

869
01:22:20,019 --> 01:22:22,939
and he died of a hemorrhage
in the brain in that chair.

870
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:25,858
Everything she said is true.

871
01:22:26,025 --> 01:22:27,485
All public information, by the way.

872
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:29,528
She could have heard
the whole story from a neighbor.

873
01:22:30,321 --> 01:22:31,656
And what about the claims

874
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:33,115
that Janet has been
teleporting around the house

875
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:34,367
in her sleep?

876
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:37,495
About as valid as their claims
of her levitating off the bed.

877
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,830
Were any of you there when it happened?

878
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:42,083
No. But I have pictures of that too.

879
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:43,751
Yeah. There you go.

880
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:46,045
I set my camera up in the girls' room

881
01:22:46,212 --> 01:22:48,339
and then waited downstairs
with the remote control.

882
01:22:48,506 --> 01:22:50,716
And fired it off whenever
I heard any commotion.

883
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:53,469
I have to admit.

884
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:56,806
The way her knees are bent,
the upright position of her body.

885
01:22:56,973 --> 01:22:58,182
It looks like she's just jumping.

886
01:22:58,349 --> 01:23:00,226
What are you saying?
I mean, you were there last night.

887
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:01,519
You saw it with your own eyes.

888
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:05,189
Well, Peggy was the one who
saw someone attacking Janet.

889
01:23:05,356 --> 01:23:07,692
But she teleported herself into a room

890
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:10,027
locked from the outside,
for goodness' sake.

891
01:23:10,236 --> 01:23:11,821
And what about her voice?

892
01:23:11,988 --> 01:23:13,364
How do we explain that?

893
01:23:13,531 --> 01:23:16,200
I think the first time
she was making that voice

894
01:23:16,409 --> 01:23:18,285
it was in front of television cameras.

895
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:20,079
And she couldn't do it
with water in her mouth

896
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:21,497
until you looked away.

897
01:23:21,706 --> 01:23:23,374
So she could have spit it out,

898
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:25,376
taken another sip before you turned back.

899
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:29,839
Last year, I was conned by a Welsh family
pretending to be possessed by demons.

900
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:32,049
Honestly,
I don't know what was worse,

901
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:36,554
the demons or the people who prey
on our willingness to believe in them.

902
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:39,807
The demons are worse.

903
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,437
But you must admit, it is suspicious.

904
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:48,024
You sincerely believe
that she's faking everything?

905
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:49,233
And what about Peggy?

906
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:51,444
She's just using the whole
thing as an excuse

907
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:53,362
to get better housing from the council.

908
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,072
She's already applied!

909
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:57,199
Look, I'm not saying it's a hoax.

910
01:23:57,366 --> 01:24:00,119
Sometimes, what we do
requires a leap of faith.

911
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:01,954
To believe when nobody else will.

912
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,582
So you really do believe them?

913
01:24:06,459 --> 01:24:08,502
Yes. We do.

914
01:24:08,753 --> 01:24:10,629
But the Church can't do
anything without proof.

915
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:11,797
That's what we need.

916
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:13,841
Right, listen. I'll make
some telephone calls,

917
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:16,552
see if I can get hold of some
video recording equipment.

918
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:18,429
In the meantime,
Ed and I can be spending time

919
01:24:18,596 --> 01:24:19,638
with Peggy and the kids,

920
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:21,932
because they need to be a family again.

921
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:24,268
Hi, Mom! We're back!

922
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:25,561
What are you doing back?

923
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,979
What's all this, then?

924
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:28,355
Mr. and Mrs. Warren bought us some vinyls.

925
01:24:28,522 --> 01:24:29,565
They got us an Elvis record!

926
01:24:29,732 --> 01:24:31,067
Oh, <i>Blue Hawaii.</i>

927
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:33,402
Hope you don't mind.
A little American culture.

928
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:34,570
Not at all!

929
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:36,280
Janet!
Billy.

930
01:24:37,073 --> 01:24:38,491
I missed you.

931
01:24:39,784 --> 01:24:42,119
Hey, guys, I missed you.

932
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:46,207
So, have any of you ever been
bothered by a bully?

933
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:49,502
Pete, at school.

934
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:51,504
He's always picking on Billy.

935
01:24:52,088 --> 01:24:54,173
And, dear, tell me, what do
you do when that happens?

936
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:57,218
They stick up for me.

937
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:58,886
Good, because the spirit in this house

938
01:24:59,095 --> 01:25:00,846
- is a lot like that bully.
- Yes.

939
01:25:01,055 --> 01:25:02,431
And he's got it in for Janet.

940
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:05,851
So you guys gotta stick up for her,
the same way they stick up for you.

941
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:07,394
Family sticks together.

942
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:10,022
This, on the other hand, is a lost cause.

943
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,440
Oh, bloody hell.

944
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:13,109
We've had all sorts of things stop working

945
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:14,777
- for no reason at all.
- Mmm.

946
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:18,030
We're gonna have music in here
one way or another.

947
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:20,366
Whose guitar is that?

948
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:23,160
Oh, it was Dad's,
but he said I could have it.

949
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:24,328
Yeah, do you mind?

950
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:26,205
No.

951
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,878
I'm a little rusty,
so you gotta promise not to laugh.

952
01:25:36,215 --> 01:25:37,383
Especially you.

953
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:55,002
Wise men say
only fools rush in

954
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:57,069
Thank you.

955
01:25:57,403 --> 01:25:58,571
Hey, don't laugh now.

956
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,900
But I can't help

957
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:10,900
falling in love with you.

958
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:16,500
Shall I stay?

959
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:22,000
Would it be a sin

960
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:33,000
if I can't help
falling in love with you?

961
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:40,000
<i>Like a river flows</i>
<i>surely to the sea,</i>

962
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:49,000
<i>darling so it goes,</i>
<i>some things are meant to be.</i>

963
01:26:50,289 --> 01:26:52,249
Everybody now.

964
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:57,400
Take my hand,

965
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:04,000
take my whole life too,

966
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:15,500
for I can't help
falling in love with you.

967
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:30,000
For I can't help
falling in love with you.

968
01:27:31,914 --> 01:27:33,123
Thank you very much.

969
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:45,678
It's so small and light.

970
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:49,765
Why do you do this?

971
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:52,184
Help people like us?

972
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:55,354
When you were little, did you ever
worry that there might be something

973
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:56,522
hiding under your bed at night?

974
01:27:57,356 --> 01:27:59,275
Yeah? Well...

975
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:04,029
My bed actually had something under it.

976
01:28:05,281 --> 01:28:06,323
Yeah.

977
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:09,159
Something grabbed my hand
and yanked me right to the floor.

978
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:11,203
It was too dark to see under there,

979
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:13,497
but let me tell you,
I ran out of there so fast.

980
01:28:13,664 --> 01:28:14,873
You know what my dad did?

981
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:19,211
He dragged me right back into the room
and told me I had to face my fears.

982
01:28:19,962 --> 01:28:22,172
And I was scared to death.

983
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:26,719
But then I remembered
what this nun had told me in catechism.

984
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:30,097
"God will be there for all who need."

985
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:36,562
So, I grabbed this crucifix
out from my nightstand, right?

986
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:39,231
And I tell whatever's under there

987
01:28:39,398 --> 01:28:42,651
that it better leave,
or God was gonna kick its butt.

988
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:48,574
Best thing my dad ever did for me.

989
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:52,703
Of course he only did it
because he really didn't believe me.

990
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:55,080
It took me years
to finally find someone who did.

991
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:56,874
And you know what I did then?

992
01:28:57,333 --> 01:28:58,584
You married her?

993
01:29:03,172 --> 01:29:04,757
So you've heard this story before?

994
01:29:08,052 --> 01:29:09,261
All right.

995
01:29:12,056 --> 01:29:13,724
How you getting on in here?

996
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:15,934
Hey. We're done here.

997
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:18,062
Fixed the closet door, too.

998
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:20,439
And if you'd like, I could take a look
at the washing machine.

999
01:29:20,606 --> 01:29:22,441
No, I couldn't ask you to do that.

1000
01:29:22,608 --> 01:29:24,109
It's a disaster down there.

1001
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:25,944
Come on. How bad can it be?

1002
01:29:27,738 --> 01:29:28,739
Oh.

1003
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:30,449
Bloody hell.

1004
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:33,243
Everything still quiet in there?

1005
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,621
Yes. Thank goodness. Yes.

1006
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:38,207
It would be something though, wouldn't it?

1007
01:29:38,374 --> 01:29:41,126
If we were able to prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt

1008
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:44,380
that there is a life beyond this?

1009
01:29:46,215 --> 01:29:48,634
It would be historic.

1010
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:50,719
Is that why you're doing this?

1011
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:52,721
Because you want to be a part
of something historic?

1012
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:56,892
This isn't a laboratory,
this is someone's house.

1013
01:29:57,059 --> 01:30:00,062
And I think helping that family
is the only thing that matters.

1014
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:02,106
No, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

1015
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:06,610
My daughter died in a car
crash several years ago.

1016
01:30:07,945 --> 01:30:11,615
Afterwards, I started
to experience things.

1017
01:30:11,782 --> 01:30:14,743
I think she wanted to communicate with me.

1018
01:30:15,244 --> 01:30:17,913
And, yes, it would help
if I knew that she was...

1019
01:30:18,831 --> 01:30:20,124
I don't know.

1020
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:24,002
Somewhere.

1021
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:37,516
That's not it.

1022
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:46,316
Oh, great.

1023
01:30:48,986 --> 01:30:50,237
Think I found it.

1024
01:31:06,712 --> 01:31:08,172
All right.

1025
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:22,811
It's right here.

1026
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:26,773
Come and get it. Margaret!

1027
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,484
Johnny, come and get it.

1028
01:31:42,456 --> 01:31:44,541
Okay.

1029
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:51,256
Think I got it.

1030
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:55,511
All right.

1031
01:31:58,055 --> 01:31:59,306
There we go.

1032
01:32:20,911 --> 01:32:22,204
What's that?

1033
01:32:44,226 --> 01:32:47,145
Ed? There's...
There's something behind you.

1034
01:33:05,247 --> 01:33:06,373
What is it?

1035
01:33:07,249 --> 01:33:08,834
Oh, Jesus!

1036
01:33:09,585 --> 01:33:10,586
Whoa!

1037
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:11,837
Peggy!

1038
01:33:12,129 --> 01:33:13,255
Peggy!

1039
01:33:15,007 --> 01:33:16,341
He grabbed me.

1040
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:19,011
It was him. He tried to pull me under.

1041
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:23,348
Oh, my God! Look!

1042
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:25,183
Oh God, you're scratched.

1043
01:33:25,434 --> 01:33:26,685
That's not a scratch, that's a bite mark.

1044
01:33:26,852 --> 01:33:29,021
He bit me. Just like he did Janet.

1045
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:26,036
Aw.

1046
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:28,413
Hey, Janet, can you get me another one?

1047
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:29,581
Yeah.

1048
01:34:48,433 --> 01:34:50,018
Janet?

1049
01:34:50,227 --> 01:34:51,603
What's wrong?

1050
01:34:53,355 --> 01:34:55,107
Don't you see it?

1051
01:34:56,108 --> 01:34:57,317
See what?

1052
01:35:00,779 --> 01:35:02,280
In the kitchen.

1053
01:35:05,242 --> 01:35:06,952
Tell me what you see.

1054
01:35:09,121 --> 01:35:11,665
It's playing with the knives,

1055
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:15,127
hiding in the dark.

1056
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:28,974
Johnny! Johnny, what you doing?

1057
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:35,605
Johnny, no! Johnny, don't go!

1058
01:35:35,856 --> 01:35:37,357
Remember what Mr. Warren said?

1059
01:35:37,607 --> 01:35:39,234
We can't let it bully us.

1060
01:35:40,235 --> 01:35:42,112
This is our house.

1061
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:46,158
Johnny. Johnny, please come back.

1062
01:36:03,842 --> 01:36:05,302
What's the matter? What's happened?

1063
01:36:05,552 --> 01:36:08,346
Janet's gone! She was just right here!

1064
01:36:11,558 --> 01:36:12,559
Come on.

1065
01:36:20,066 --> 01:36:21,067
No!

1066
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:23,195
- Mum!
- Johnny!

1067
01:36:26,573 --> 01:36:28,200
Ed? What's going on?

1068
01:36:28,492 --> 01:36:29,493
Mum.

1069
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:32,204
Mum, Johnny's in there!

1070
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:33,830
No!

1071
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:36,208
Johnny!

1072
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,210
Johnny!

1073
01:36:38,877 --> 01:36:39,878
Step back.

1074
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:43,548
Come on.

1075
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:55,393
Where are they?
Where are they? Johnny?

1076
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:57,521
Johnny?

1077
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:02,400
Darling!

1078
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:05,195
Oh, darling, come here.

1079
01:37:06,404 --> 01:37:07,739
Are you all right?

1080
01:37:09,658 --> 01:37:10,951
It's all right, darling.

1081
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:16,540
It's all right.

1082
01:37:16,915 --> 01:37:17,999
Where's Janet?

1083
01:37:21,878 --> 01:37:23,171
Where's Janet?

1084
01:37:24,339 --> 01:37:25,549
Janet!

1085
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:46,278
Guys, I'm picking up something in here.

1086
01:37:53,451 --> 01:37:54,452
Ed, watch the...

1087
01:38:08,967 --> 01:38:10,886
Me... Won't...

1088
01:38:11,261 --> 01:38:13,221
Me... Won't...

1089
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:14,681
Me...

1090
01:38:25,191 --> 01:38:26,192
Janet.

1091
01:38:26,735 --> 01:38:30,322
It's okay. It's okay.
Come on. Come on.

1092
01:38:31,156 --> 01:38:32,657
Come on, now.

1093
01:38:32,908 --> 01:38:34,784
It's okay. Watch out. Look out.

1094
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:36,661
- Slowly!
- Okay.

1095
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:38,163
Darling, it's all right.

1096
01:38:38,455 --> 01:38:41,499
It's all right, Mum's here.
Mum's here, darling.

1097
01:38:43,752 --> 01:38:45,503
How did she get in there?

1098
01:38:54,012 --> 01:38:57,182
It's all right, darling. What's that?

1099
01:39:01,728 --> 01:39:02,896
It's fine.

1100
01:39:07,692 --> 01:39:08,902
Can I, uh...

1101
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:14,407
What is it?

1102
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:16,868
She's faking it.

1103
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:18,828
What?

1104
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:20,872
I have proof.

1105
01:40:04,249 --> 01:40:05,834
So much for your leap of faith.

1106
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:12,340
What?

1107
01:40:13,008 --> 01:40:15,760
My girl didn't make this up.
I've seen things.

1108
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:17,804
She was caught red-handed faking an event.

1109
01:40:18,054 --> 01:40:20,557
No, it's not possible.
Have you seen it in there?

1110
01:40:20,849 --> 01:40:23,351
How could a 12-year-old girl
throw a table across the room?

1111
01:40:23,601 --> 01:40:25,353
It's over. Do you understand?

1112
01:40:25,812 --> 01:40:28,982
For the sake of your daughter,
don't make this harder than it already is.

1113
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,610
She couldn't have pulled this off alone.

1114
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:34,946
Oh, how dare you.

1115
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:36,948
What, you think I put her up to this?

1116
01:40:37,365 --> 01:40:39,409
What about the police?
Are they in on this, too?

1117
01:40:39,701 --> 01:40:40,744
No, it's all right.

1118
01:40:40,952 --> 01:40:42,412
What about you two?

1119
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:46,458
You believe us, don't you?

1120
01:40:50,462 --> 01:40:51,838
We wanna help.

1121
01:40:52,172 --> 01:40:54,883
But the Church will take one look at
that video and that'll be the end of it.

1122
01:40:56,593 --> 01:41:00,013
They'll wanna distance themselves from
anything that remotely resembles a hoax.

1123
01:41:04,726 --> 01:41:06,686
I'd like you to leave, please.

1124
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:09,898
Now, go on, get out.

1125
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:12,317
Get out, the lot of you!

1126
01:41:13,276 --> 01:41:14,444
Get out!

1127
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:29,834
Perhaps, you could somehow
reach out to the spirit.

1128
01:41:30,126 --> 01:41:32,295
You know, make contact with it yourself.

1129
01:41:32,545 --> 01:41:34,506
I can't. Believe me, I've tried.

1130
01:41:35,173 --> 01:41:37,217
I'm sorry, I'm just not
sensing anything here.

1131
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:38,635
So, that's it, then?

1132
01:41:38,885 --> 01:41:41,304
You hold out a lifeline to them
and then you just throw it away?

1133
01:41:41,638 --> 01:41:43,473
We don't like this any more than you do.

1134
01:41:43,765 --> 01:41:45,767
We'll tell the Church
about everything we've seen.

1135
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:48,353
But, the only piece
of concrete evidence we've got,

1136
01:41:48,645 --> 01:41:50,105
is a video of Janet faking an incident.

1137
01:41:50,355 --> 01:41:54,025
Yeah, but there have been literally
dozens of genuine incidents.

1138
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,401
You might want this.

1139
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:58,738
And, just because she faked it this once,
doesn't change the fact that--

1140
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:00,031
No, it changes everything.

1141
01:42:01,282 --> 01:42:02,742
We're agents of the Church here.

1142
01:42:03,076 --> 01:42:06,663
They'd be calling us home
even if Peggy hadn't asked us to leave.

1143
01:42:08,706 --> 01:42:10,917
You've done really
good work here, Maurice.

1144
01:42:11,209 --> 01:42:13,211
You were here for them
when no one else was.

1145
01:42:18,716 --> 01:42:20,510
Uh, thank you.

1146
01:42:22,971 --> 01:42:25,890
But, sometimes you need to
make a leap of faith.

1147
01:42:26,683 --> 01:42:29,227
Believe when nobody else will.

1148
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:08,391
This doesn't feel right.

1149
01:43:09,809 --> 01:43:10,810
I know.

1150
01:43:13,605 --> 01:43:14,606
Have a safe trip.

1151
01:43:52,894 --> 01:43:54,479
Did you really do it?

1152
01:43:54,979 --> 01:43:56,773
Wreck the kitchen and all that?

1153
01:44:00,151 --> 01:44:01,861
But, why?

1154
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:05,657
It said it would kill you,

1155
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:09,452
if I didn't make them leave.

1156
01:44:11,537 --> 01:44:13,206
Don't you think it's a little convenient

1157
01:44:13,414 --> 01:44:15,083
that she just happened to fake an incident

1158
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:18,253
in the one room of the house
that had a video camera pointing at it?

1159
01:44:18,461 --> 01:44:19,462
Yeah.

1160
01:44:20,463 --> 01:44:21,547
No.

1161
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:24,968
Oh, damn it.

1162
01:44:39,607 --> 01:44:40,692
Lorraine.

1163
01:44:41,567 --> 01:44:42,777
Help me set up these tape recorders.

1164
01:44:56,165 --> 01:44:57,875
Thread it through
and start it from the top.

1165
01:45:03,756 --> 01:45:04,757
All right.

1166
01:45:05,008 --> 01:45:07,093
Remember those strange,
garbled messages we got from Janet?

1167
01:45:07,802 --> 01:45:10,430
- You know, from Bill?
- Yes.

1168
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:11,973
There were two of them, right?

1169
01:45:12,265 --> 01:45:13,433
Here's the first one.

1170
01:45:15,476 --> 01:45:17,562
<i>Help! It...</i>

1171
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:20,898
<i>Let go!</i>

1172
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:24,193
<i>Help! It... Let...</i>

1173
01:45:25,278 --> 01:45:27,488
<i>Go!</i>

1174
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,742
We thought
he was referring to himself, right?

1175
01:45:31,034 --> 01:45:33,411
- Yes.
- Listen to the second one.

1176
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:37,999
<i>Me... Won't...</i>

1177
01:45:38,583 --> 01:45:40,460
<i>Me... Won't...</i>

1178
01:45:40,877 --> 01:45:42,003
<i>Me...</i>

1179
01:45:53,848 --> 01:45:55,433
If I'm right about this...

1180
01:46:01,189 --> 01:46:05,818
<i>Help me! It won't let me go!</i>

1181
01:46:06,069 --> 01:46:10,281
<i>Help me! It won't let me go!</i>

1182
01:46:49,654 --> 01:46:52,990
I come here to see my family.

1183
01:46:53,699 --> 01:46:55,827
But they're not here now.

1184
01:46:58,496 --> 01:46:59,997
I think,

1185
01:47:01,624 --> 01:47:03,251
I'd like to go now.

1186
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:07,088
- But I can't.
- Why not?

1187
01:47:08,047 --> 01:47:11,092
It wants her. So badly.

1188
01:47:11,884 --> 01:47:13,678
It almost has her.

1189
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:15,763
Tell me how to stop it.

1190
01:47:19,517 --> 01:47:23,312
I'm given and I'm taken.

1191
01:47:23,729 --> 01:47:26,149
I was there at your first breath.

1192
01:47:26,691 --> 01:47:28,109
You didn't ask for me.

1193
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:33,072
But I'll follow you till death.

1194
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:36,117
Wait. I don't understand.

1195
01:47:36,451 --> 01:47:37,452
Please...

1196
01:47:41,372 --> 01:47:42,373
Oh, God!

1197
01:47:42,707 --> 01:47:43,749
You're bleeding!

1198
01:47:45,334 --> 01:47:46,711
What is happening?

1199
01:47:52,341 --> 01:47:55,928
The old man's spirit is just a pawn.

1200
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:59,223
He's been enslaved
to where he's to weaken Janet's will.

1201
01:47:59,474 --> 01:48:00,725
Enslaved? Enslaved by who?

1202
01:48:01,017 --> 01:48:02,185
Something inhuman.

1203
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:05,396
Something that's taken
a blasphemous form to attack my faith.

1204
01:48:05,771 --> 01:48:07,982
There is a demonic presence in that house.

1205
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:11,569
You need to get Vic before he leaves.
We need to go back.

1206
01:48:11,903 --> 01:48:12,904
Okay.

1207
01:48:33,591 --> 01:48:35,885
Mom, help me, please! Mom!

1208
01:48:36,093 --> 01:48:38,679
Please, Mom, help me! Help!

1209
01:48:40,556 --> 01:48:43,267
For God's sake, leave us alone!

1210
01:48:46,395 --> 01:48:47,480
Margaret!

1211
01:48:51,776 --> 01:48:53,528
Margaret, no!

1212
01:48:55,947 --> 01:48:58,491
Come on, let's get out of here!

1213
01:49:00,076 --> 01:49:01,327
Come on, let's get out!

1214
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:07,124
- Go to Peggy's house!
- What, you're not coming?

1215
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:08,501
I can't leave Janet!

1216
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:12,046
- No! Janet!
- Mum!

1217
01:49:13,089 --> 01:49:14,090
Janet!

1218
01:49:14,423 --> 01:49:15,466
Well, I don't understand it.

1219
01:49:15,716 --> 01:49:17,635
I mean, first you say it's not real,
now it is.

1220
01:49:17,969 --> 01:49:20,137
Her sight was being blocked
by the inhuman spirit.

1221
01:49:20,388 --> 01:49:21,597
The old man's spirit

1222
01:49:21,806 --> 01:49:24,183
couldn't break through
until we left that house.

1223
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:27,270
Everything they've experienced
has been a manifestation of the demonic.

1224
01:49:27,562 --> 01:49:29,397
The Old Man, the Crooked Man,
they're just a facade,

1225
01:49:29,647 --> 01:49:31,315
trying to keep us from seeing
the real evil in that house.

1226
01:49:31,566 --> 01:49:33,734
In my vision, he wanted to help me,
but he was too afraid.

1227
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:36,070
And he kept speaking in a kind of riddle.

1228
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:43,494
Something like, uh,
"I am given and I am taken.

1229
01:49:43,744 --> 01:49:45,496
"I was there at your first breath.

1230
01:49:45,746 --> 01:49:47,123
"You didn't ask for me.

1231
01:49:48,666 --> 01:49:51,210
"But I will follow you until your death."

1232
01:49:56,382 --> 01:49:58,968
Your name. You didn't ask for it.
It was given, when you were born.

1233
01:49:59,218 --> 01:50:00,386
That's it! Knowing the demon's name

1234
01:50:00,678 --> 01:50:02,346
gives us power over it
and we can cast it out.

1235
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,682
Yeah, sure, but we don't know its name.

1236
01:50:04,932 --> 01:50:05,975
But, maybe we do.

1237
01:50:06,183 --> 01:50:07,184
Huh?

1238
01:50:07,351 --> 01:50:09,103
Why else would he give us that clue?

1239
01:50:09,353 --> 01:50:11,230
He must think that we know it somehow.

1240
01:50:11,564 --> 01:50:13,065
So, what do you do now?

1241
01:50:13,316 --> 01:50:15,526
An inhuman spirit powerful enough
to cloud Lorraine's sight

1242
01:50:15,735 --> 01:50:16,736
is more than a match for me.

1243
01:50:17,111 --> 01:50:19,113
We need to get Janet to the Church
before it kills her.

1244
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:23,909
Janet!

1245
01:50:24,577 --> 01:50:25,703
What happened?

1246
01:50:31,208 --> 01:50:32,209
Janet!

1247
01:50:34,712 --> 01:50:35,838
Janet!

1248
01:50:37,089 --> 01:50:38,215
Thank God you're here.

1249
01:50:38,424 --> 01:50:39,925
- Janet's in there!
- Come on!

1250
01:50:42,762 --> 01:50:43,763
Damn it.

1251
01:51:04,075 --> 01:51:06,035
Huh?

1252
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:09,830
- Ed! Are you okay?
- Yeah!

1253
01:51:11,374 --> 01:51:12,458
I'm gonna go around back!

1254
01:51:12,708 --> 01:51:14,418
No! Ed! No!

1255
01:51:15,169 --> 01:51:16,337
Ed, no, no, no.

1256
01:51:16,796 --> 01:51:18,255
I'm gonna come with you!

1257
01:51:20,758 --> 01:51:21,967
- Peggy, stay here.
- Janet!

1258
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:24,470
- Wait in the car with the kids! Wait!
- Janet!

1259
01:51:24,679 --> 01:51:25,680
Janet!

1260
01:51:28,557 --> 01:51:29,558
Get in the car.

1261
01:51:29,809 --> 01:51:32,311
Go in, go on. You, too, Peggy. Come on!

1262
01:51:38,901 --> 01:51:39,902
Ed?

1263
01:51:43,489 --> 01:51:44,490
Ed?

1264
01:51:51,956 --> 01:51:53,499
Ed?

1265
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:56,377
No! Come on!

1266
01:51:58,087 --> 01:51:59,213
Ed!

1267
01:52:00,631 --> 01:52:01,966
It won't open!

1268
01:52:03,509 --> 01:52:04,719
Let me try.

1269
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:08,305
- We need to break it down!
- All right.

1270
01:52:08,556 --> 01:52:09,807
- Wait here.
- Break it!

1271
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:12,685
Ed, hon, wait right there.

1272
01:52:13,144 --> 01:52:14,353
Wait. Vic'll be right back.

1273
01:52:14,562 --> 01:52:16,647
I can't wait. I'm going on ahead.

1274
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:18,774
No, Ed, don't! Stop!

1275
01:52:19,066 --> 01:52:20,526
You can't fight this alone.

1276
01:52:23,571 --> 01:52:24,905
She needs our help!

1277
01:52:25,489 --> 01:52:28,826
Ed, please. Please, just wait for me.

1278
01:52:29,452 --> 01:52:30,953
Please wait for me.

1279
01:52:38,753 --> 01:52:43,132
I can't lose you. I am so scared.

1280
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,136
I know.

1281
01:52:48,804 --> 01:52:49,972
Me, too.

1282
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:52,308
But I have to help her.

1283
01:52:54,018 --> 01:52:55,770
But, what about my vision?

1284
01:52:58,022 --> 01:53:00,441
I know I made a promise to you, hon,

1285
01:53:02,443 --> 01:53:04,028
but I have to do this.

1286
01:53:06,739 --> 01:53:08,032
I love you, Lorraine.

1287
01:53:08,365 --> 01:53:10,868
Ed, no! No!

1288
01:53:11,577 --> 01:53:13,037
Stop! Don't!

1289
01:53:14,747 --> 01:53:16,332
Ed!

1290
01:53:17,374 --> 01:53:18,793
No!

1291
01:53:20,586 --> 01:53:23,047
No. Stop.

1292
01:53:25,341 --> 01:53:27,927
Ed! Someone! Help!

1293
01:54:37,913 --> 01:54:38,914
Move.

1294
01:54:59,059 --> 01:55:00,144
Oh, God.

1295
01:55:05,024 --> 01:55:06,775
Janet, where are you?

1296
01:55:07,318 --> 01:55:08,402
Come on!

1297
01:56:22,559 --> 01:56:23,602
Help!

1298
01:56:24,186 --> 01:56:25,354
Janet!

1299
01:56:25,771 --> 01:56:26,772
Janet!

1300
01:56:27,064 --> 01:56:28,107
Help me!

1301
01:56:28,482 --> 01:56:29,566
Janet!

1302
01:56:36,156 --> 01:56:39,368
In the name of the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

1303
01:57:02,224 --> 01:57:03,350
What's your name?

1304
01:57:04,268 --> 01:57:05,269
What's your...

1305
01:57:06,186 --> 01:57:08,272
What's your name?

1306
01:57:19,074 --> 01:57:20,492
I do know your name.

1307
01:57:20,993 --> 01:57:22,119
I asked you.

1308
01:57:22,453 --> 01:57:23,746
Tell me who you are!

1309
01:57:23,912 --> 01:57:25,122
And you told me.

1310
01:57:25,998 --> 01:57:27,541
You told me your name.

1311
01:57:30,461 --> 01:57:31,628
And I wrote it down.

1312
01:57:37,885 --> 01:57:38,886
I need my Bible!

1313
01:57:39,136 --> 01:57:40,345
Why? What's happening?

1314
01:57:40,846 --> 01:57:41,847
What...

1315
01:57:55,027 --> 01:57:56,653
The demon's name gives us power over it.

1316
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:01,116
V.

1317
01:58:01,325 --> 01:58:03,285
A. L.

1318
01:58:03,577 --> 01:58:05,287
A. K.

1319
01:58:08,082 --> 01:58:09,249
Valak.

1320
01:58:35,901 --> 01:58:37,111
Janet!

1321
01:58:48,539 --> 01:58:49,748
Janet?

1322
01:58:58,757 --> 01:59:03,554
<i>There was a crooked man</i>
<i>and he walked a crooked mile.</i>

1323
01:59:04,179 --> 01:59:09,226
<i>He found a crooked sixpence</i>
<i>upon a crooked stile.</i>

1324
01:59:09,685 --> 01:59:14,731
<i>He bought a crooked cat</i>
<i>which caught a crooked mouse.</i>

1325
01:59:15,232 --> 01:59:19,236
<i>And they all lived together in a little...</i>

1326
01:59:46,013 --> 01:59:48,515
Vic! Vic! Let me through.

1327
01:59:48,807 --> 01:59:50,767
- No, wait, Lorraine, let me try.
- I'm going! No!

1328
01:59:51,018 --> 01:59:52,311
Let me go in. Lorraine!

1329
01:59:52,603 --> 01:59:53,604
Ed!

1330
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:55,480
Lorraine!

1331
01:59:57,357 --> 01:59:58,609
Lorraine!

1332
02:00:04,114 --> 02:00:05,115
Ed!

1333
02:00:18,128 --> 02:00:19,129
Janet?

1334
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:43,654
Janet! No! No!

1335
02:00:49,201 --> 02:00:50,202
I got you.

1336
02:00:50,452 --> 02:00:52,412
Come on.

1337
02:00:52,704 --> 02:00:53,747
No!

1338
02:00:53,997 --> 02:00:55,457
Janet.

1339
02:00:55,666 --> 02:00:57,668
Ed! Ed!

1340
02:00:58,001 --> 02:00:59,795
Ah!

1341
02:01:05,092 --> 02:01:06,218
Ed!

1342
02:01:13,183 --> 02:01:14,268
Lorraine!

1343
02:01:31,076 --> 02:01:32,202
Ed!

1344
02:01:36,581 --> 02:01:39,209
Your name gives me dominion
over you, demon.

1345
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:41,378
And I do know your name!

1346
02:01:44,006 --> 02:01:45,590
You are Valak!

1347
02:01:46,216 --> 02:01:47,551
The defiler.

1348
02:01:47,884 --> 02:01:51,346
The profane, the marquis of snakes!

1349
02:01:52,306 --> 02:01:56,184
In the name of the Father
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

1350
02:01:56,727 --> 02:01:59,396
I condemn you back to hell!

1351
02:02:12,159 --> 02:02:13,160
No!

1352
02:02:13,994 --> 02:02:14,995
Ed!

1353
02:02:17,956 --> 02:02:18,957
Come on!

1354
02:02:19,541 --> 02:02:20,542
Ed!

1355
02:02:22,753 --> 02:02:25,464
Okay. We're good. Okay.

1356
02:02:26,465 --> 02:02:29,009
- Ed, are you okay?
- No, check on her.

1357
02:02:29,384 --> 02:02:30,427
Janet?

1358
02:02:31,011 --> 02:02:32,888
Oh, my God! Is she all right?

1359
02:02:33,263 --> 02:02:34,598
I'll call an ambulance.

1360
02:02:34,765 --> 02:02:37,309
Janet, sit up, darling. Sit up.

1361
02:02:37,768 --> 02:02:38,935
Here you go now.

1362
02:02:39,436 --> 02:02:40,937
Take a big, deep breath.

1363
02:02:41,229 --> 02:02:43,440
Big, deep breath. There you go.

1364
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:56,787
You all right?

1365
02:03:22,813 --> 02:03:24,231
He'll be fine.

1366
02:03:36,076 --> 02:03:37,994
- Does she look all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

1367
02:03:38,703 --> 02:03:40,372
You saved her.

1368
02:03:41,498 --> 02:03:42,499
No.

1369
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:45,001
You saved us.

1370
02:03:47,254 --> 02:03:49,339
Didn't I tell you it was meant to be?

1371
02:03:51,883 --> 02:03:53,760
But you believed in me.

1372
02:04:01,017 --> 02:04:03,395
I couldn't have done it without you.

1373
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:12,612
Thanks for coming back for us.

1374
02:04:12,863 --> 02:04:14,489
Oh.

1375
02:04:14,698 --> 02:04:15,699
Aw.

1376
02:04:17,325 --> 02:04:19,494
Here, sit down. Sit down.

1377
02:04:25,375 --> 02:04:26,460
You know...

1378
02:04:28,462 --> 02:04:33,049
This has kept me safe since I was a kid.

1379
02:04:34,676 --> 02:04:36,219
I want you to have it.

1380
02:04:41,892 --> 02:04:43,185
And, when you grow up,

1381
02:04:44,186 --> 02:04:47,189
you find someone who needs it,
you give it to them.

1382
02:04:48,482 --> 02:04:49,733
Deal?

1383
02:04:54,321 --> 02:04:55,989
I'm so lucky.

1384
02:04:59,701 --> 02:05:02,871
You said one person
could change everything.

1385
02:05:03,955 --> 02:05:04,956
But...

1386
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,585
I've got two.

1387
02:06:05,850 --> 02:06:08,311
Oh.

1388
02:06:18,238 --> 02:06:19,281
Okay.

1389
02:07:49,037 --> 02:07:52,332
<i>Tell me about the beginning,
the first night of your happening.</i>

1390
02:07:52,624 --> 02:07:54,751
- <i>What was your brother doing?</i>
- <i>Brothers playing</i>

1391
02:07:54,918 --> 02:07:55,919
<i>and fooling about.</i>

1392
02:07:56,252 --> 02:07:57,462
<i>I wasn't quite sure, no.</i>

1393
02:07:57,754 --> 02:08:00,256
- <i>They were scared?</i>
- <i>Yeah, petrified.</i>

1394
02:08:00,465 --> 02:08:01,591
<i>Janet? What about Janet?</i>

1395
02:08:03,259 --> 02:08:06,596
<i>When it comes from your area, Janet,
do you feel anything in your throat?</i>

1396
02:08:06,888 --> 02:08:08,765
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>You just don't feel anything?</i>

1397
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:10,558
<i>Now, I'm looking at Janet.</i>

1398
02:08:10,892 --> 02:08:12,018
<i>Don't fight in here.</i>

1399
02:08:12,352 --> 02:08:13,478
<i>And the voice comes from her,</i>

1400
02:08:13,770 --> 02:08:15,313
<i>but her mouth doesn't move
and nothing moves.</i>

1401
02:08:15,563 --> 02:08:16,564
<i>Turn it off!</i>

1402
02:08:16,940 --> 02:08:17,982
<i>I know--</i>

1403
02:08:18,274 --> 02:08:20,985
<i>Janet, can you tell when
the voice is gonna come through you?</i>

1404
02:08:21,277 --> 02:08:23,196
<i>No. No, I don't ever.</i>

1405
02:08:23,488 --> 02:08:24,989
<i>You know who I am?
Do you know what my name is?</i>

1406
02:08:25,323 --> 02:08:27,367
<i>Yeah. Ed. Ed!</i>

1407
02:08:32,038 --> 02:08:33,873
<i>Were you a Christian?</i>

1408
02:08:34,249 --> 02:08:36,376
<i>No! You know it!</i>

1409
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:38,169
<i>What year did you die?
Do you remember?</i>

1410
02:08:38,545 --> 02:08:41,798
<i>Yeah. I'm dead. Sixty-one.</i>

1411
02:08:42,757 --> 02:08:44,134
<i>Nineteen sixty-one.</i>
