1
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:34,284
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.

2
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,078
Excuse me. Coming through.

3
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,873
Tonight, so-called magician Lionel Shrike

4
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,459
is making another sad attempt for attention

5
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,879
by performing what he calls an impossible feat.

6
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,257
The safe is made of the strongest iron.

7
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,553
It can't be sawed through or pried.

8
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:56,932
Yet, Lionel Shrike thinks he's able to escape.

9
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,850
Dad! Dad!

10
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,689
Hey, buddy. You made it, huh?

11
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:07,150
Now, see that seat there?

12
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,735
It's the best seat in the house.

13
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,031
Is Lionel Shrike the kind of magician who can pull this off?

14
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,993
Or is he actually in over his head?

15
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,661
We'll see about that.

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,080
- What's the matter? - I don't want you to go.

17
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,332
Dylan, come on. We talked about this.

18
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,710
Remember? This is what I do.

19
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,296
I got to prove all those naysayers wrong.

20
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,173
Okay? Besides...

21
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,302
I always keep something up my sleeve.

22
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,470
Now, got your watch like your dad's?

23
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,016
- Okay. How many seconds? - Three hundred.

24
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,768
Three hundred. Maybe a few less.

25
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,982
I love you so much.

26
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,695
Okay. See you later, big man.

27
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:56,408
Ladies and gentlemen, Lionel Shrike!

28
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,953
Will he be able to hold his breath?

29
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,707
Will he be able to somehow escape the safe?

30
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,504
Three, two, one...

31
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,345
Two, three,

32
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:21,016
four, five, six, seven, eight...

33
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:28,899
296... 297, 298, 299, 300.

34
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:35,113
303, 304...

35
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,866
It's five minutes now,

36
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:43,330
and we have not seen or heard anything from Lionel Shrike yet.

37
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,539
Move!

38
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,000
Dad!

39
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,754
Dad! Dad!

40
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,091
Let go of me!

41
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,093
Dad!

42
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,221
No! Dad!

43
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,391
Dad! Let go!

44
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,768
Find him!

45
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,164
The Eye.

46
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,875
It may not lie...

47
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,462
But don't think for a moment that it can't be lied to.

48
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:37,092
Seeing is believing.

49
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,094
But is it truth?

50
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,889
People see the Horsemen as noble Robin Hoods. Are they?

51
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,435
Or are they common thieves?

52
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,812
Depends on your point of view.

53
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,022
Here's what you know.

54
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,693
They robbed a bank in Paris from a stage in Las Vegas.

55
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,403
They fleeced an insurance magnate

56
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,029
of hundreds of millions of dollars

57
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,741
and disappeared from a roof in New York.

58
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:05,078
Always showering their devoted fans with money.

59
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,038
Here's what you don't know.

60
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,249
They left one man behind.

61
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,753
Framed. Holding the bag. Me.

62
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,715
Are you listening, Horsemen?

63
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,968
When you emerge, and you will,

64
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,097
I will be there waiting.

65
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:29,394
Because mark my words, you will get what's coming to you.

66
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,855
In ways you can't expect.

67
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,858
But very much deserve.

68
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:41,740
Because one thing I believe in is an eye for an eye.

69
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,027
Welcome, Daniel Atlas.

70
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,446
Who am I speaking to?

71
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,908
I asked to see the face behind all of this.

72
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:12,289
You've asked many questions. And registered many complaints.

73
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,291
You can rest assured that we've heard you.

74
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,876
Have you? Because I don't...

75
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,294
- Trust? - No.

76
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,088
Your leader? Your fellow Horsemen?

77
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,631
Perhaps even us?

78
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,677
I don't like that we've been living in hiding for a year.

79
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,971
I don't like that every message I get from Dylan is,

80
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,682
"Wait. Be patient. The Eye has a plan."

81
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,143
Wait. Be patient.

82
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,436
The Eye has a plan.

83
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,480
This is games and it's not working for me.

84
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,485
You feel it is you who should be leading the Horsemen, not Dylan.

85
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:48,033
If that is what you desire, stay the course.

86
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,118
Trust that your unique talents

87
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,997
and remarkable mind will not go unrecognized.

88
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,666
We have a new mission for the Horsemen.

89
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,836
Dylan has a plan and will gather you together soon.

90
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,714
Now leave!

91
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,522
...North Carolina, Florida, Maryland, Maine.

92
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,483
We're talking the entire eastern seaboard.

93
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,485
I need to see some results.

94
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,362
Oh, hey. Oh, sorry.

95
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,489
Just real quick. Can I have you for a couple of minutes?

96
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,199
I'm right in the middle of something, Dylan.

97
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,618
No, I know. It's okay. Hey. Hey, everybody. Sorry. Sorry about that.

98
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,287
Call the mayor.

99
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,748
Thanks a lot. Twins, huh? Good.

100
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,000
Is he coming?

101
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,169
Look, I wouldn't have brought you out of that meeting

102
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,712
unless it was something important.

103
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,173
It's about the Horsemen.

104
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,385
Something's happening here and it's happening now.

105
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,179
Message boards. Elite magic society.

106
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,682
There is chatter going on about the Horsemen

107
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:57,018
and something happening with Octa, the giant software company.

108
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,103
I know what Octa is.

109
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,854
I'm sorry, ma'am, but two months ago

110
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,898
we sent men to Philadelphia because he knew...

111
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,275
- And I said that I was wrong. - He knew that the Horsemen

112
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,944
were going to hit the Euro-Atlantic Banking Summit.

113
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,028
- I have proof. - Let him talk.

114
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,322
Thank you. Communications.

115
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,410
Contact between who I think might be Daniel Atlas

116
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,162
and who may be Merritt McKinney.

117
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,582
And what do you have? Emails? Cell phones? Any transcripts?

118
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,835
- Pigeons. - What?

119
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,212
I'm sorry, you mean stool pigeons?

120
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,923
No, I mean actual pigeon pigeons. Like carrier pigeons.

121
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,968
- Okay? Magicians work with pigeons. - Doves.

122
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,470
Stay with me.

123
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,765
This pigeon, right here...

124
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,435
There's Daniel Atlas. Same pigeon.

125
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,602
East Village.

126
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,271
Same pigeon, West Village.

127
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,107
42nd Street, pigeon. 65th Street.

128
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,068
All the way up to the George Washington Bridge

129
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:51,740
on a sail boat with a guy that looks just like Merritt McKinney.

130
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,241
And what does this all mean?

131
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,744
I know what it means. It means nothing. It's bullshit.

132
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,537
- Could you sing a new song? - No.

133
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,039
How is it that two years ago you were so close...

134
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,333
You think I went out of my way to screw up my own investigation?

135
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,585
You think I'm that big of an idiot?

136
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,170
You know what I think now? I think you're smart,

137
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,421
but you want everybody else to think that you're an idiot.

138
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,465
Okay, stop.

139
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,593
Cowan, I know I'm new here, but as far as I can tell,

140
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,928
people who don't even know you, think you're an asshole.

141
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,306
- And you? - Ma'am.

142
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,310
You don't know me, but my first year in the Academy, you gave a talk.

143
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,814
The "long game" you called it. You talked about a moral compass.

144
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,067
About how you believed in yours immutably.

145
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:34,240
And I thought to myself, "That guy. One day, I want to be that guy."

146
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,411
And now... A pigeon?

147
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,663
Technically, it was a few pigeons, but I hear what you're saying.

148
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,290
Okay. So here's what I'm going to do.

149
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,376
You want to take a vacation day? Go on your own? Fine.

150
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,755
But I'm not going to devote resources to another snipe hunt.

151
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,966
I came to clean this mess up, not add to it. I'm sorry.

152
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,512
Boss, thank you. I promise you, it won't be a snipe hunt.

153
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,639
We're gonna get those Horsemen.

154
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,140
She's great.

155
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,393
The problem is when you're two people at the same time,

156
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,937
one of them is bound to trip the other.

157
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,232
And when that happens, I will be there.

158
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,067
Duly noted.

159
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,090
- Oh. Hi! - Who are you?

160
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,842
- What are you doing in my... - It's actually a funny story.

161
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,510
How did you get into my apartment? Whoa!

162
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,887
I think it's funny. It's not like funny "ha ha."

163
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,098
Or you might not think that it's funny "ha ha."

164
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,433
I think it's funny. I guess it's all kind of relative.

165
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,435
I was actually... No, that's not...

166
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,064
I made myself in the neighborhood and now I'm here, and maybe...

167
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,068
Okay.

168
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,361
Seriously, how did you get in here?

169
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,822
Are you some kind of crazed fan or something?

170
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,824
Oh, my God. No, no, no, I recognize you.

171
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,077
You did that B-grade "geek magic" thing, didn't you? You pulled a...

172
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,370
Pulled a hat out of the rabbit.

173
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,663
A hat out of the rabbit, that's right.

174
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,831
I know that it didn't work.

175
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,999
No, it was actually kind of disgusting.

176
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,500
It was way worse for the rabbit.

177
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:11,004
Well, your drop was obvious and your body shell is flimsy.

178
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,424
So if you wouldn't mind crawling out from under my couch and...

179
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,722
Ta-da! Now I'm sitting over here. Crazy!

180
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,475
By the way, that rabbit thing? That was eight years ago, okay?

181
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,227
I've gotten so much better since then.

182
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,645
- Have you? - Yeah.

183
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,230
Okay, come here. What is it that you want?

184
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,940
I wanted to meet you. Everybody, really.

185
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,650
I want to be a part of the Eye, okay?

186
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,403
I said it. I do. And I want to use my magic for good,

187
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:39,157
like you and Merritt and Jack especially.

188
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,242
Oh, that's right. I know that Jack is alive.

189
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,577
I know that he faked his own death.

190
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,538
I am a huge fan of faking deaths. That was crazy!

191
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,165
What is this? A trucker's hitch?

192
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,000
- Yeah. - It's terrible.

193
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,169
- Embarrassing. - Okay.

194
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,214
By the way, I am so sorry that Henley left you.

195
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,090
- God! - Sorry.

196
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,760
That's actually a little better. You know what I heard?

197
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,969
- What? - About Henley?

198
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,555
I heard that she got tired of waiting around.

199
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,141
She lost faith and so she asked for an out,

200
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,101
and the Eye gave it to her.

201
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,436
But who knows, right?

202
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,480
In matters of the heart, so difficult to tell.

203
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,024
I mean, maybe she got sick of you. You ever think about that?

204
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,442
Control issues?

205
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,277
Maybe you just didn't tie her up tight enough. Ow!

206
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,737
Here's what's going to happen.

207
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,114
You're going to stay here and stop talking,

208
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,658
and I'm going to make a phone call,

209
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,077
and in about five minutes, some people are going...

210
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,460
It's all in the wrist.

211
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,880
Let the momentum of the card do the work for you.

212
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,967
This last one I call the Stall.

213
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,346
Not bad.

214
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,014
Now you want to see a thing of beauty?

215
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,808
- I do indeed. - Here you go.

216
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,102
And bingo bango bongo.

217
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,815
That's good. No, no, no, it's good to be positive

218
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,400
despite making zero progress in a year.

219
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,526
Yeah.

220
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,528
Whereas when it comes to hypnotism,

221
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,030
the student has almost become the master.

222
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:05,702
I like your confidence, but you might say that you have the better teacher.

223
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,869
Yeah.

224
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,162
You're right. You're right.

225
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,498
Your teacher definitely doesn't know what he's doing.

226
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,500
By the way, was this your card yesterday?

227
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,961
- In fact it was. - I thought so.

228
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,587
That's not bad.

229
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,095
If I can hypnotize Danny before you hit him with a card,

230
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,471
I get top bunk for a week.

231
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,473
Okay, that's a deal.

232
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,975
- Danny, what's up, man? - Hey.

233
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,019
Stare at the palm of your hand and as your eyes change focus,

234
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,437
you will begin to notice...

235
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,521
Everything, because I'm not hypnotized.

236
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,649
It's not working. Please don't become him.

237
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,401
I didn't know you guys did party tricks

238
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,153
when there weren't floozies around to impress.

239
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:44,699
Uh, I think we stopped trying to impress floozies in, like, 1937.

240
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,826
Okay, somebody broke into my apartment, all right?

241
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,661
Some amateur who knew everything about me,

242
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,289
everything about Henley leaving, and everything about us.

243
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,042
- That's her. - Hey!

244
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,377
- Hi. - You met Lula.

245
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,963
I've met her. What is she doing here?

246
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:04,135
I'm the new Horseman! I'm the girl Horseman.

247
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,888
Yeah!

248
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,516
Nobody. No excitement. Jack? Anything?

249
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,560
Dylan, tell me what's going on here.

250
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:17,231
Well, Lula's been on the underground scene for the last decade,

251
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,941
and I think she has some real talent,

252
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,027
and I'd like to try her on stage

253
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,237
- to balance out the duo. - What?

254
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,655
No, are you serious, man?

255
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,699
After Henley left, you said I could get back on stage again.

256
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,201
Not someone who just showed up.

257
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,119
I told you I'd think about it, and I have,

258
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,413
and I really need you behind the scenes with me for a little while longer.

259
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,665
Dylan, come on. I've been behind the scenes my whole life.

260
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,503
Which is a crime, might I add. Have you seen that man's face?

261
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,382
Much as I appreciate the addition of some femininity to the group,

262
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,717
over and above what Atlas provides,

263
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,136
I think the real issue is we've been in this...

264
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,555
Yeah, the issue is that we have been rehearsing for months

265
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,308
for something... We don't even know what it is.

266
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,768
And you're going to keep working until...

267
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,812
Until we work as a single organism. I know, I've heard you say that.

268
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,063
The thing is, when you say that,

269
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,649
I think what you're referring to is us, not you.

270
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,110
Listen, I'm getting my orders directly from the Eye.

271
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,653
Okay? And then I give them to you.

272
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,238
Now, if you don't like that, you're welcome to go.

273
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,032
No, I'm not going anywhere. But I'm... Mmm. I'm taking care of myself.

274
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,450
Guys, can I just weigh in here really quickly?

275
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,993
Because I think I see what's going on here.

276
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,913
You guys are this amazing, tight-knit family unit.

277
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,332
- I'm a new person... - We are anything but a family.

278
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:20,420
Okay, well, my mother literally knifed my father in the neck one time.

279
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,463
So you are actually a little bit like my family unit.

280
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,798
- Literally? - But, yeah.

281
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,800
It was an accident, I think.

282
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,928
Okay. So, does this mean we're actually going to do something?

283
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,097
Yes.

284
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,601
You've all heard of Octa and their playboy CEO, Owen Case.

285
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,229
His partner, Walter Mabry, died about a year ago.

286
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,022
You wanna know what all this has been leading to?

287
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,149
Yeah.

288
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,609
Octa's hosting the launch of the next-gen cell phone.

289
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,153
Once these phones hit the streets,

290
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,072
they'll siphon their users' information to the black market.

291
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,826
Meaning Octa's selling privacy to up their profit.

292
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,829
So, the Eye has decided to expose them for it.

293
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,998
Our mission is to hijack the show.

294
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,750
Rehearsal's over, guys.

295
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,502
This is what we've been waiting for.

296
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,045
Now it's time to get to work.

297
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:14,140
Welcome, Octa insiders, bloggers and journalists.

298
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,518
We're delighted that you've joined us to participate in our special event.

299
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:21,606
Today marks the beginning of a bright new journey in social networking.

300
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,316
Our latest product, Octa 8...

301
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,152
Keys, cell phones, iPads, in the bin.

302
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,112
Thank you, sir.

303
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:32,658
Can't have you texting, tweeting, recording, or eating.

304
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,411
Sorry, we will take very good care of it for you.

305
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,164
Oh, by the way.

306
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,916
Security memo from Case himself.

307
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,461
Couple of surprise guests. Just follow his lead, yeah?

308
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,463
We're all good. I'm heading to the control room.

309
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,048
All right. Thanks, Jack.

310
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,511
- Atlas, go. - No, Dylan, I can't...

311
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,930
- What? What's the problem? - No, there's too many people...

312
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,307
Atlas, I got Owen landing now.

313
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,808
Okay, I'm going now.

314
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,519
- Stop. - Oh.

315
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,396
- Okay. - Thanks.

316
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,774
Pascal, we need you in the kitchen.

317
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,710
Look, the speech is about freedom, okay?

318
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,420
That's what we're trying to sell here, is freedom.

319
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,880
Which part of that do you not understand?

320
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,382
- I know, I'm sorry. - For goodness sake!

321
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,093
Mr. Case, John from legal. Just need your signature for release.

322
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,803
Thank you so much.

323
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,972
Just get it done and get it back to me.

324
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,564
Hey there, buddy! Smile!

325
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,482
- Who are you? What the hell? - Who am I?

326
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,901
It is picture day. Did Julie not tell you it's picture day?

327
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,736
- Picture day? What are you... - Company-wide policy.

328
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,572
- Look, I got a job to do. - I have a job to do, too.

329
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,823
Hold on a second. What is that?

330
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,949
I'm going to need some backup here.

331
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,158
Who are you calling? Hey! That's my ID.

332
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,326
Security, my name is...

333
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,869
- Bo Walsh, thank you. - Hey, I'm Bo Walsh!

334
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,329
Not this guy. He's not Bo Walsh.

335
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,414
Calm down, please.

336
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,040
Hey! Hey, what's going on?

337
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,625
This guy just came and put a flashlight in my eyes.

338
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,919
I'm trying to do my job. This guy, check his badge.

339
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,629
- Who is this guy? - I'm Bo Walsh, not him.

340
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,715
It says here, "Evans Mental Facility."

341
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,216
- "Mark D. Stooge." - Hold on a second.

342
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,301
I've never seen this before in my life.

343
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,594
I'm sorry, Mr. Walsh.

344
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:15,928
- Come on, Mr. Stooge. - Hold on. He's not Mr. Walsh!

345
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,805
- Come on. Let's go. - What's going on here?

346
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,640
I'm Bo Walsh, not him!

347
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,978
God, you cannot trust anybody in this city anymore, can you?

348
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,813
Get off me! Look, I want to make a phone call.

349
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,773
- I want to call my boss! - Hey, hey! What's going on?

350
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,817
I want to call my boss, and this jackass...

351
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,777
Hey! Make your phone call. That's your right, sir.

352
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,071
That's my right.

353
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,990
- What the hell? - You're crazy. Let's go.

354
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,700
This isn't my... Where's my phone?

355
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,493
Where's my phone?

356
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,329
Atlas, Stooge has left the building.

357
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,663
Okay.

358
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,416
The circuit board is ours. I am leaving backstage.

359
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,129
Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Case.

360
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,798
All right. Lula, show these guys what you're made of.

361
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,558
I can take over from here. Clark says you're on break.

362
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,934
What break? Who's Clark?

363
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,645
"Who's Clark?" That's funny.

364
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,064
Imagine if I told Roger that, he'd freak out.

365
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,066
- Don't do that! - What?

366
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,484
Who the hell is Roger?

367
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,069
Does Lisa know that you don't know Roger?

368
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,445
- I don't know who Lisa is. - Are you kidding again?

369
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,489
- You don't know who Lisa is now? - No, I don't. Just get away.

370
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,741
- That is a dangerous... - You're ruining the meat.

371
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,368
Don't make me have to go to Brian!

372
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,952
- I don't know who Brian is! - Why are you acting like this?

373
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,412
- I'll go straight to him. - Give me...

374
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,457
Oh, my God!

375
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,836
What are you doing to me?

376
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,297
- Help me! - Help her. Go!

377
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,176
Have some water.

378
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,970
I feel from your face you're freaked by the flow of blood,

379
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,681
which is fully fixable in a snap

380
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,267
by focusing and following the flow of my words

381
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,645
as you're flowing and floating,

382
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,648
which is why you're focusing on my commands.

383
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,108
You got this far in life

384
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,819
by listening to one voice, the voice in your head.

385
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,779
This is that voice.

386
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,658
Look at the light.

387
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,577
Listen to your own voice.

388
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,709
Oh, my God.

389
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,132
Wow. What is that? Is that a miracle towel?

390
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,883
Thank you so much. Do you know what?

391
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,387
You have taught me that I'm not cut out for this kind of work.

392
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,097
I quit!

393
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,890
Get another towel.

394
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,309
Thank you, and goodbye.

395
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,353
Oh, God.

396
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,733
Welcome everybody!

397
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,736
And now, the moment that you've all been waiting for...

398
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,905
- Nice work, lady. - Thanks.

399
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,033
Revolutionized music with Octa 2.

400
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,705
I'm actually nervous, and I'm not even going onstage.

401
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,999
You know, I've heard that if you're nervous,

402
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,085
it can be really helpful to picture each other naked.

403
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,920
It's actually picture the audience naked.

404
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,672
No, this is new. This is a new science.

405
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,090
So, I don't know.

406
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,343
- Do you want... We should try it. - Not the right mood.

407
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,053
Guess that leaves you and me, old buddy.

408
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,931
What? Picture each other... No. No, thank you.

409
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,976
I mean, I admit, from the neck up there are issues.

410
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,146
But from the neck down, the David.

411
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,689
Owen Case.

412
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,067
Good morning, Octa-lites.

413
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,153
Good morning, Octa-lites.

414
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,697
Now, I've made the claim...

415
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,533
Now, I've made the claim that Octa 8 is pure magic.

416
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,620
But the truth is, that's just one of those things I say...

417
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,123
You know, the truth is, that's just one of those things I say...

418
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,459
...when in fact I mean something else.

419
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,713
...when in fact I mean something else.

420
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,089
What else do I mean?

421
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:45,429
Well, here to fill you in on some of my fabulous lies and hypocrisy,

422
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:49,475
and to perform some of the most dazzling feats of magic you have ever seen...

423
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,144
- They are the world's... - ...greatest magicians.

424
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,980
Here to expose me for the fraud I truly am.

425
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:59,401
Ladies and gentlemen, here are the Horsemen.

426
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,000
Hello, New York!

427
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,002
Thank you so much.

428
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,838
Hey, it's great to be back.

429
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,216
And have you met our newest Horseman, Lula?

430
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:29,265
- Feels good, right? - Pretty good. Pretty good.

431
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,477
Thank you, thank you. Um, okay.

432
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,312
We want to talk to you about your privacy.

433
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,398
What does your privacy mean to you?

434
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,234
Because apparently to Owen Case, it means absolutely nothing.

435
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,778
No, actually it means less than absolutely nothing.

436
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,906
You see, he's mocked your privacy. He's scorned it.

437
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,993
Right, and we're not just talking about the things that you already agreed to

438
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,287
when you signed, probably without reading

439
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,540
the terms and conditions of Octas 1 through 7.

440
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,130
Dylan, the FBI is here.

441
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,507
All right. Don't worry about it.

442
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,593
All right, go to plan C-4.

443
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,721
Lock the doors.

444
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,389
Hey, boss, I'm glad you're here.

445
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,891
Don't.

446
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,060
Guys, look. We got to move around, get in through the back.

447
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,437
These Horsemen are tricky, okay?

448
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,607
They got backup plans on top of backup plans.

449
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,734
Hey, sorry, don't mean to gloat, but I told you so.

450
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,985
Cut the bullshit, Rhodes.

451
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,237
We got an anonymous phone call an hour ago.

452
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,989
Confirms everything I've been telling her.

453
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,073
What are you talking about?

454
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,491
You sent agents to Detroit and Philadelphia.

455
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,827
You've been crying wolf so we wouldn't send them here.

456
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,538
- Boss, please. - Keep working on the doors.

457
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,542
Please tell me that you haven't bought into Cowan's crazy, paranoid fantasia.

458
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,210
Before we start the show...

459
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:44,006
We had Owen agree to a few terms and conditions of our own.

460
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,092
So, everything that he had once considered private...

461
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,722
That he thinks is really private...

462
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,768
Yeah, everything that he once considered private is now...

463
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,186
Oh, my.

464
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,986
As the Horsemen like to say, magic is about controlling perception.

465
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,115
You see them as champions of the truth, but are they?

466
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,118
Or is that just another one of their illusions?

467
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,746
- What's going on, Rhodes? - This is crazy.

468
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,289
We got to get everyone to the other exits.

469
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,959
- Let's go, to the back. - No. You stay here.

470
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,252
So, since they clearly love secrets...

471
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,838
Let's reveal some of theirs.

472
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,632
Danny, everyone, get off the stage.

473
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,925
Abort.

474
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,512
Jack, go with them. I'll see you at the meet-up point.

475
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,596
Let's go.

476
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,807
Do you recall the death of Jack Wilder?

477
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:40,312
What if I told you he's not just alive, but he's actually right here.

478
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,155
And do you know who else is here? The FBI.

479
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,449
Let's let them in, shall we?

480
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,661
And now, for the big reveal.

481
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,414
Go! Go! To the stage.

482
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,541
There's a fifth Horseman,

483
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,419
and he's the biggest criminal of them all.

484
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,130
FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes.

485
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,383
- I knew it. - What?

486
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,511
This is so much deeper than you know, boss.

487
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,763
You think you're looking at one thing, but you have no idea.

488
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,266
- Who are you? - The same man I've always been.

489
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,184
Boys, I'm sorry.

490
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,486
You gotta be kidding me.

491
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,613
We've gotta get to the chute. Go!

492
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,450
- Who are those guys? - Who cares? Come on!

493
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,701
- Hurry, hurry! - Keep going!

494
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,785
How the hell could this happen?

495
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,537
I thought Dylan had everything under control.

496
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,414
Yeah. Apparently he didn't.

497
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,542
Maybe you're the leak, Dan. Where you been sneaking off to?

498
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,127
Don't you dare for a second insinuate that I had...

499
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,589
- I'm not insinuating. That's your... - Let's get to the truck, come on!

500
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,841
- Stay together! - Move! Move!

501
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:51,967
Lula, come on!

502
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,969
Coming! Whoa!

503
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:06,273
Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.

504
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,243
What the hell is going on?

505
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,621
- Wasn't there supposed to be a truck? - Where the hell are we?

506
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,124
Come on!

507
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,085
Hey, hey! Wait, did you mis-run the tube?

508
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,795
No, I put it in the truck. I know I did!

509
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,421
Because we're really not in the truck right now.

510
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,839
Somebody must have moved the tube.

511
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,382
Were we above a Chinese restaurant? Give me that!

512
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,510
- I'm moving! Relax! - There's something very wrong.

513
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,598
Okay. Why are we here?

514
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,642
Why am I frickin' starving?

515
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,852
Yeah, I'm weirdly starving, too.

516
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,188
This makes no sense.

517
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,505
Okay, sorry.

518
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,175
At least, and I know this isn't much consolation,

519
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,970
but apparently we're now surrounded by Chinese food.

520
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,305
- Right? - Guys...

521
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,976
I think where we are right now, they don't refer to it as "Chinese food."

522
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,770
It's just called "food."

523
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,735
Wait, what are you saying? How is this possible?

524
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:41,577
I believe in your particular parlance, the word is "magic."

525
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,163
That guy looks exactly like you.

526
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:47,291
He looks exactly like you. Are you seeing this right now?

527
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,500
Chase.

528
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:52,546
Must confess, it's like what I heard about meeting the Rolling Stones.

529
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,548
They're a lot shorter in person.

530
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,467
Remember I told you about the guy who screwed me out of everything?

531
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,846
This is my twin brother, Chase.

532
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,723
Wait, did you do this?

533
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,854
As you can see, my boss don't mess around.

534
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,607
I do not understand what is going on right now. At all.

535
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,775
Okay, let me break it down for you.

536
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:17,863
You jumped off a rooftop in New York and you landed in Macau.

537
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,491
AKA the Vegas of China.

538
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,869
And presto-changeo.

539
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,120
Don't you just love it?

540
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,289
The "greatest magicians in the world"

541
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,833
are the object of someone else's magic trick?

542
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,085
Isn't that poetic?

543
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:37,758
No? You know what, I'm not gonna let you guys yuck my yum.

544
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,260
Shoo-shoo. Or mu-shu. Whatever.

545
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:46,350
Oh, and you know what they say, "What happens in Macau..."

546
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,686
Well, I don't know the rest of it, 'cause it's in Chinese...

547
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,480
Hey, thanks, guys!

548
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,543
Reports are coming in that the infamous Horsemen

549
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,587
hijacked the Octa product launch today.

550
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,297
The trick was on them, however,

551
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,717
as we learned of the miraculous resurrection of Jack Wilder.

552
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,845
And the stunning revelation that FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes

553
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,348
has been working as a mole within the Bureau.

554
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,810
Questions abound today as an international manhunt is underway

555
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,605
for Dylan Rhodes and his elusive and criminal band of illusionists.

556
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,359
Hey, seriously, where are you guys?

557
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,278
I'm at the meetup. I've been leaving you messages.

558
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,697
I haven't heard from anyone. Please, call me!

559
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,906
And the stock market

560
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,701
saw big gains and modest losses on Thursday.

561
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,745
Hey, tell me you're safe. Where are you?

562
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:53,166
Right where you left me, 18 months ago, Agent Rhodes.

563
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,418
Thaddeus?

564
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,378
How does it feel to lose everything?

565
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:00,382
Your job. Your identity. Your reason for living.

566
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,593
How does it feel to be out of control, perhaps for the first time?

567
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,180
What do you want?

568
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,308
You're a fool, Agent Rhodes. You always have been.

569
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,353
- Where are they? - I'm not telling you on the phone!

570
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,438
Where are they?

571
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:18,525
And if you're wondering if I was behind the Horsemen's recent debacle,

572
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,360
I'll let you work that out for yourself.

573
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,447
Hey, I burned you once, I'll burn you again. I'm not playing, Thaddeus.

574
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,199
It's not my game, Agent Rhodes. It's yours.

575
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,744
You started it when you locked me in a cell.

576
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,537
This is simply my move.

577
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,581
Next one is yours.

578
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,252
No!

579
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,629
Let go!

580
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:43,925
Dad! Help me! Dad!

581
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,678
Dad!

582
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,031
It's all about blind spots.

583
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:10,952
When you're staring straight at something, and not see it. Why?

584
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,413
Blind spots.

585
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,707
We learned that together, didn't we, bro?

586
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,627
Did he tell you that we were partners once?

587
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,880
No? I didn't think so. The "Mini-McKinneys."

588
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,299
Chasey and a Mer-Bear.

589
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,385
Gonna make you scare-bear.

590
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:29,805
Ma-ma-magic McKinneys.

591
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,890
Cool.

592
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:38,563
And then, one day, we were 12 and Virginia von Welsheim

593
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,525
had a very nice party down the street.

594
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,902
I had a little tum-tum, couldn't go.

595
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:49,533
Mer-Bear did it on his own, and got a taste of the solo thing, and uh...

596
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,204
- ...and kicked me to the curb. - Oh, God.

597
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:58,750
Chase, you win! I concede. Just tell me how you did it.

598
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:05,006
Delivery guy came to your door about a month ago, little za.

599
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,174
Za?

600
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,218
Pizza, huh?

601
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:13,598
- Is this apartment d3375? - Not even close.

602
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,187
Sleep!

603
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,858
Relaxing, floating, drifting, dreaming...

604
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,943
Falling.

605
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,612
So, what he did, my little womb-mate,

606
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:31,616
is he downloaded all your private information,

607
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,870
and my employer had all he needed.

608
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,329
Thanks.

609
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,207
How did you know how to find him?

610
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,461
- That's a very good question, Atlas. - Okay.

611
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,523
Just follow the guards. They'll take you to my boss.

612
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:10,697
Been fun playing this cat-and-mouse with you, broski.

613
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,616
Meow.

614
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,037
Have fun at the Sands.

615
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:23,376
- I am so, so, so sorry. - Yeah, you should be.

616
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,630
Don't ever accuse me of betraying us again, okay?

617
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,770
Do you guys ever think that the Eye is watching this?

618
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,314
You know, that maybe this is even what they want?

619
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,026
And at the exact right moment,

620
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,362
they're gonna swoop in, and we'll be like,

621
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,280
"Yes! Thank God you're here!

622
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,824
Thank God! Just in the nick of time, Eye!"

623
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:58,912
And then we'll just celebrate, and it was all worth it in the end?

624
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,168
I don't even really think that, either, so...

625
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,545
It's cool.

626
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,275
So happy to be working with you.

627
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,985
Please, come in. Come in.

628
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,613
Wait, sorry, how are you working with us?

629
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:36,616
Oh, well, as much as a magician who pulls a rabbit from a hat

630
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,536
is working with that rabbit.

631
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,164
We'll be working together. Yes. Allow me to introduce myself.

632
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,750
Yeah, you're Walter Mabry. You died a year ago.

633
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,711
Yes. An idea I got from you, Mr. Wilder.

634
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,713
Fake your death, the world puts its guard down.

635
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,798
I'm able to control quite a few companies,

636
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,383
including my old partner, Owen's,

637
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,595
as a consortium of so-called anonymous shareholders.

638
00:34:56,678 --> 00:35:00,390
- And that violates how many SEC laws? - I believe it breaks all of them.

639
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,850
All of them.

640
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,811
You see, you all want an audience.

641
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:08,315
Need one, desperately. It's quite sad, really.

642
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:10,483
Hence, my ability to nab you.

643
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,361
L, on the other hand, want the opposite of that.

644
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:17,824
I just want to be, and I am 100 percent off the grid.

645
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,200
You know why?

646
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,786
Yeah, because the grid is for actual human beings.

647
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,205
No, because in a world of total surveillance,

648
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,417
the only true freedom lies in not being seen.

649
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,753
You can't control the grid from within the grid.

650
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,713
- Follow me. - Yeah.

651
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,590
- Follow me. - Okay. All right.

652
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,967
You pulled a hat out of a rabbit. That was very colorful.

653
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:39,554
Almost eight and a half years ago. So, no need to bring that up.

654
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,265
We can't all be held accountable for our adolescent personas.

655
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,476
Can we, Magicolio?

656
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,895
Magicolio, that was 15 years ago.

657
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,855
Don't get me wrong, I love magic.

658
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,106
Like you, and many others who,

659
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,234
I suppose, were not getting any sex in high school, I dabbled with it.

660
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:58,698
But, unlike you, I was able to transition upward towards actual magic.

661
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,909
Science, you may have heard it called.

662
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:07,791
So, would you like to know, my friends, just how I got you here?

663
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,209
We know how you did it.

664
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,293
No, you don't.

665
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:13,088
Yeah, you stole our files for the show, then obviously hypnotized us.

666
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,589
Stop. No. Seriously, stop.

667
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,008
The strobe was a combo of binaural beats, as well as...

668
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,427
I said stop!

669
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,013
You might not be having fun, but I am.

670
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:25,225
You have an unusual way of showing it.

671
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:26,893
So...

672
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,521
How did I do it?

673
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:34,150
Easy. You see, magicians like to control other people's perceptions.

674
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,527
In your heightened state of agitation,

675
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,946
you saw the simplest cues. Black tube, roof.

676
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,448
And your minds filled in the rest.

677
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,368
But the tube you meant to go down was 20 feet to your right.

678
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,453
Go on, sit down. There's no one standing in your way.

679
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,996
Don't mind if I do.

680
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,042
Anyway, once in the tube, yes, you're right...

681
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:54,921
Blah, blah, blah, the strobe contained UV letters pulsing the word "sleep."

682
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:00,802
And that, combined with the sound, put you into an instant alpha pattern.

683
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,680
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

684
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,432
And from then on, it really was just fun.

685
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,560
And I can assure you, you don't know what happened.

686
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,609
That's really creepy. Really, really creepy.

687
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,697
That's not cool.

688
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,907
Yep, easy stuff, magic,

689
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,034
if you put your mind to it.

690
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,078
All right, that's enough. So why are we here, then?

691
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,873
Besides you getting to show off how adorably clever you are.

692
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,751
Well, to start with, the man you stole from last year,

693
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,587
turns out I had invested quite a lot of money in some of his companies,

694
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,882
so a lot of what you stole was, in fact, mine.

695
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,718
Good news is, it's very easy for you to pay me back.

696
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,512
I just need your skills.

697
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,474
Owen and I were like the Beatles, if the Beatles had been...

698
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,600
Elfin?

699
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,018
...geniuses.

700
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,728
Pretty sure the Beatles were geniuses.

701
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,105
And like them, we had a dream.

702
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,693
Could we create actual, genuine magic?

703
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:02,155
And I'm guessing one of you achieved that dream, and it wasn't you?

704
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,366
That is what he would like you to think.

705
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:10,538
My vision was a perfect blend of elegance and technology.

706
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,957
But Owen wanted it for himself so he humiliated me

707
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:16,211
by exposing my private files to the board of directors

708
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,712
and convinced them that I am unstable.

709
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,964
Did you take a picture of him while he was sleeping?

710
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,382
He had me kicked out of my own company,

711
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,843
and now he goes around taking credit for a chip

712
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,678
that's not just the key to one computer,

713
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,765
but every computer system on the planet.

714
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,935
It can un-encrypt anything, crack the defense firewall,

715
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,771
manipulate markets, and spy on anyone.

716
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,606
And now it's being sold to the highest bidder.

717
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,316
If you're so rich, why don't you just buy it?

718
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,818
So he gets the money?

719
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,070
And the pleasure? No.

720
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,406
No, no, no. Besides, why would I buy it when I could have you steal it for me?

721
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,658
Oh!

722
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,660
It's being previewed tomorrow to the various suitors,

723
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,413
which will include your targets, a crew lead by a South African gangster.

724
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,957
South African gangster.

725
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,750
Yes. How your team gets past security, that's up to you.

726
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:59,087
But once you do, you just need to inspect it and steal it.

727
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,171
That's it?

728
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,048
Come on, this is perfect for you, isn't it?

729
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,216
You're magicians and thieves.

730
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,885
What makes you think we would even consider doing this?

731
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:09,305
Oh, wait, I had a reason. What was it? Oh, yes.

732
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,974
You see, back home, you're wanted criminals.

733
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,310
But here, I control the police, the casinos, the media.

734
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,605
I can give you a new life, out of hiding.

735
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,067
And if you don't, I'll have you killed.

736
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,738
You know what? I'm not stealing a thing for you.

737
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,909
- Not unless Dylan tells me it's okay. - Really? Dylan is where, exactly?

738
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,871
It doesn't matter. Yeah, I'm with him. So you can go ahead and kill us

739
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,956
because I'm not gonna steal anything for you either.

740
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,626
Strikes me that a consensus seems to be forming, Walter,

741
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,253
and we're calling your bluff.

742
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,007
- Actually, we'll do it. - What?

743
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,843
We're in Macau. The oldest magic store in the world is here.

744
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,263
We'll get the supplies we need, and we'll do it.

745
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,807
Thank you.

746
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,350
It should be fun.

747
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:57,437
Chase will take you to the magic shop in the morning.

748
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:03,568
Badge.

749
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,448
Really?

750
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:11,951
Thanks.

751
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:16,497
Agent Cowan. Your ID.

752
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,999
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

753
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,547
It appears Mr. Bradley's still at dinner.

754
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,342
Yeah? Tell him recess is over.

755
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,267
What?

756
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,787
All right, so I made my move.

757
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,039
Where are they? I don't have time for bullshit.

758
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,625
Oh, I have all the time in the world, thanks to you.

759
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,128
And I didn't get to finish my lobster, which makes me very grumpy.

760
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,965
Okay, let's cut the crap. What do you want?

761
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,218
You can dispense with the tough guy act to begin with.

762
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,845
You're too desperate for it to be believable.

763
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,558
I said, what do you want?

764
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:21,229
You used a form 219 warrant to search my room.

765
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,982
You found a connection between me and the Four Horsemen.

766
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:29,195
Which means you can take me out of here on a 24-hour leave.

767
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:33,491
- You want me to break you out? - I want you to take me out.

768
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,119
All you need is an extradition order,

769
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,913
which you'll find in that tray by my printer.

770
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:45,169
Dylan, I had nothing to do with the Horsemen's disappearance.

771
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,714
You were lured into a trap.

772
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,842
And like Dorothy did when she landed in Oz,

773
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:57,140
you're beginning to realize that the only way out is through.

774
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,226
And I'm the only one who can get you there.

775
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,520
You got this place wired.

776
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:06,733
You don't need me to get out of here. This is all about payback.

777
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:10,611
- I believe in an eye for an eye. - So you're out to destroy me?

778
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,863
Oh, absolutely.

779
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,197
You think I'm still gonna play your little game?

780
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:14,949
I know you will.

781
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:19,037
Because no matter how hard you try to find a culprit behind all this,

782
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,497
you're going to blame only yourself.

783
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:26,044
When your little vendetta ended with you putting me in jail 18 months ago,

784
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:30,006
you got tired, you got sloppy. You stopped paying attention.

785
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,133
And that's where you lost.

786
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,806
So, you can save yourself,

787
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:45,021
or you can make a deal with me, and save the Four Horsemen,

788
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,399
and stop wasting both of our time.

789
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:55,990
Steal something for this narcissistic little man boy? I don't like it.

790
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,201
But what I like less is you deciding for us.

791
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,828
Yeah? Do you like that we're the laughing stocks of the magic world,

792
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,747
and the fugitives of the actual world?

793
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,540
Walter is right. We have nowhere to go.

794
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:05,875
But we can fix that.

795
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,168
- We can fix it? - Yeah.

796
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,753
So you're officially part of the team now?

797
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,630
- Excuse me? - I'm sure this is what Dylan

798
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,799
meant when he said we should all work as a single organism.

799
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:16,135
Yeah, that is a fairy tale that Dylan tells himself, and tells us.

800
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,846
Look, even if we get this stick, he'll never let us go.

801
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,017
We can't trust Walter, okay? The Eye has a history in Macau.

802
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,435
They're the only ones we can trust.

803
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,520
Now, if we can get it to them,

804
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,897
they can clear our names and get us the hell out of here.

805
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,482
It's a bad plan, man.

806
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,157
Hey.

807
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,451
Hi, how are you?

808
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,495
We need some things custom-made.

809
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,163
Actually, by tomorrow. We're kind of in a rush.

810
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,915
And...

811
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,209
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?

812
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,426
Welcome to long's. My name's Li. Not Bruce Lee.

813
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,761
- What? - Got you.

814
00:43:58,845 --> 00:43:59,887
- Okay. - Look.

815
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:02,932
Where'd it go?

816
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,353
Oh! And now it's by my head. How fun.

817
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,980
- $20. - $20?

818
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,940
No, thank you. We're kind of in a rush.

819
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,276
- $10. - No.

820
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,652
- Two for one. - No.

821
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,279
Okay, all right. Just give us the thumbs. Yeah?

822
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,614
Okay. Thanks a lot, Jack. Please take these.

823
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,325
So, we need a Keplinger holdout,

824
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:25,413
and we also need roughing fluid, a Sanada gimmick, sleeves, tracks.

825
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,415
This is all in plastic, though, if you can.

826
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,004
What?

827
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:36,757
Is there a problem?

828
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:40,011
My grandmother wants to know why plastic? Plastic is cheap.

829
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,346
Sorry. Yeah, we need plastic because we're...

830
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:46,017
We're going through a very sensitive metal detector, okay?

831
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,811
So plastic, nothing. Metal...

832
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,064
It detects.

833
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,529
What did she say?

834
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,949
She said just because you're talking slowly and moving your hands

835
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,035
doesn't mean she can suddenly understand English.

836
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,871
Oh, yeah. So sorry. He's racist.

837
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:11,167
Hey, bro. Listen, I know that the only thing that we agree on

838
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,836
is that our mom and dad had one too many children.

839
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,216
So why don't we just let the kids play with their toys

840
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,759
and go get a little drinkey-poo?

841
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:25,181
- If it's free, it's me. - Great. Guys, we'll be right back.

842
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,893
Okay, kiddies, the chaperones are watching you.

843
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,229
Don't do anything I wouldn't enjoy.

844
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,357
Okay. Have fun, you two.

845
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:40,154
Hey. Can I use your phone? It's kind of important.

846
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,614
Sure.

847
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,075
- On the house. - Thanks.

848
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,827
Who are you calling?

849
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,371
I'm arranging to hand over the stick.

850
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,206
So that's how we've been contacting the Eye?

851
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,540
You've been doing it on your own?

852
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:52,750
Maybe.

853
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,253
Oh, God. Dylan's not gonna like this.

854
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,380
I'm not really concerned with what Dylan likes. Okay?

855
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,714
I'm doing this for us.

856
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,637
- What is wrong with this thing? - Hey, relax, it's just a kid's toy.

857
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,055
Yeah, that's what I thought.

858
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,473
Okay. Let me just...

859
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,934
Sorry, sorry. Jesus.

860
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,397
Hey, can you get this?

861
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,945
It's like birth, you know.

862
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:24,490
One person enters the hospital, two people come out.

863
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,992
Walk and talk.

864
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,411
I'll tell you on the plane.

865
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,579
What plane?

866
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:33,624
My sources tell me your Horsemen are in Macau.

867
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,669
- What's the look? - It's none of your business.

868
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,962
Who are your sources?

869
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,717
Just some old friends.

870
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,643
When we have the card, where do I go?

871
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,812
And 0 for 52.

872
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:58,149
Well, it's perfect. It's a perfect score.

873
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,069
Then what about girls?

874
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,988
Like, relationships?

875
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,197
What?

876
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:12,621
Look, it's not something I'm proud of,

877
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:18,753
but every girl I get close to, I end up taking their trust.

878
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,339
And then their wallet.

879
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,049
So...

880
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,054
- You take their wallets? - Yeah.

881
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,391
You ever take their belts?

882
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:38,272
Or how about some peanuts from the hotel bar?

883
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,317
Not sure why you took those.

884
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,487
I'm sorry, did you think that I was like those other girls?

885
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,823
Oh, Jack.

886
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,748
Okay. So there's a marketplace down the street.

887
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,958
And I'm meeting a man with a blue hat.

888
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,753
He'll get the stick to the right people and get us home.

889
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,880
You go grab Merritt, okay? We got a lot to do.

890
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,673
And, hey, put your belt on.

891
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,426
Oh, no, it's not... She took it off me and...

892
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:11,514
You know, the most heartbreaking moment of my life

893
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:16,310
was when I discovered that you had stolen all my money and split.

894
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,479
I didn't realize until now

895
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,023
how much of that money you put into your face.

896
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:25,694
Seriously, is it weird to have more hair in your nose than on your head?

897
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,322
Speaking of, next time you get a hair transplant,

898
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:34,036
you might wanna consider requesting something other than old man pubes.

899
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,165
You know what? You are such a buffoon, Mer-Bear.

900
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,167
And this little ploy you have

901
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:44,338
of stalling me while your friends screw over my employer?

902
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,048
Not gonna work.

903
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:52,638
Chase! As you stare into my eyes, you will find that you wanna sleep.

904
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,349
When you wake, you will beg for Merritt's forgiveness

905
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:58,602
and realize that you will never be half the man that he is.

906
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:07,319
Merritt, I am so, so very, very sorry

907
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:10,114
about how pathetic your pupil is.

908
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,367
Hey, a little hint on your technique of surprise.

909
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:17,746
It lacks that all-essential little element of surprise.

910
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:22,626
Hey, this has been fun, Mer-Bear. Let's do it again sometime.

911
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:31,010
Well, I've had ample time to do some research, and you know,

912
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,136
I was wrong.

913
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:35,806
I think the Eye might actually be real.

914
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,349
Thought you didn't buy into all that.

915
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,435
I'd be lying if I said I didn't think

916
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,855
that this road would lead to the great wizard behind the curtain

917
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,483
and, in the end, I might get to see his face.

918
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,775
That ain't gonna happen.

919
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,402
Even if the fate of the Horsemen depends on it?

920
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,155
Listen to me. I broke you out of there. We're not changing the terms now.

921
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,949
- You put me there! - Yeah, because you deserve to be there.

922
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:57,578
- Listen, I did not kill your father. - What?

923
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,581
All right, all right, let's just cut the bullshit.

924
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,251
I know who you are, Shrike.

925
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,588
I know you blame me for your father's death.

926
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:11,634
I know you think I goaded him into performing a trick he couldn't pull off.

927
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:16,555
I know the time in jail was a result of a 30-year revenge plot against me.

928
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,849
Supposing that's all true, you think I'd tell you now?

929
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,100
Man...

930
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,479
Thirty years.

931
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:29,151
Thirty years, and the greatest long game magic trick ever created.

932
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:33,030
Just to put me behind bars. Okay.

933
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,492
So how did it feel, seeing me there?

934
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,286
Was it all you hoped?

935
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,788
I don't know what you're talking about.

936
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,959
You're lying. It was an empty experience.

937
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,086
And you wanna know how I know?

938
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,881
I know because you know.

939
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:56,804
There's always, always more than what's on the surface.

940
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,265
So what, the past didn't happen, and you're not who I think you are?

941
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:00,474
Now, don't tell me in 30 years

942
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,394
that's the first time you've asked yourself that question.

943
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,398
I am not my father. You're not getting in my head, okay?

944
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,984
You think you're luring me into a trap? You're not.

945
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,695
Now, I am desperate, which means I'm dangerous.

946
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:16,240
My only concern is the health and well-being of the Horsemen.

947
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,785
And you're gonna lead me to them. And if you don't, I promise you,

948
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,747
you're gonna end up far worse than in some cushy jail cell somewhere.

949
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:40,764
What if the Horsemen don't actually need you to save them?

950
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:48,105
All right. So the lab is made up of two distinct layers,

951
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:51,233
the security perimeter and the clean room.

952
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:53,319
The stick we're looking for should be in this core.

953
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:55,446
So we're gonna have to get underneath, extract it,

954
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,239
and replace it with a decoy.

955
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:58,657
Now, we're about to get to the chip.

956
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,326
This is the thing about the chip, it's very thin.

957
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:03,287
Luckily, it's similar in weight and size to a playing card,

958
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,247
so we're gonna have to brush up on our card-is try.

959
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:13,964
That's no good.

960
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,684
So how do we get in? Hannes Pike.

961
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:27,561
He's the son of a South African gangster.

962
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,313
He's RSVP'd with what looks like

963
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,357
a couple of members of his security detail.

964
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,443
A doctor, to vet it, I guess, and somebody named Buffy.

965
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:38,197
Yeah, apparently, he travels with a different bimbo every week. Hmm.

966
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,908
I wonder which one of us gets to play the bimbo.

967
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,377
Hey, can I get in?

968
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,630
At the soothing sound of the slots

969
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:58,092
you slip into a serene state of slumber and sleep.

970
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,136
Jack, for a moment,

971
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,931
they will think you're Hannes, so lead them out and keep them busy.

972
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,183
You trust your people implicitly.

973
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,310
You will have them take care of everything,

974
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,812
and you will wait in the car.

975
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:13,440
And eyes open, wide awake. Go.

976
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,317
Excuse me. These people are following me.

977
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:16,652
You might wanna check their pockets.

978
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,033
Then our time is ticking to infiltrate the lab

979
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,202
and get the card to the market, where I'll hand it off to the Eye,

980
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,787
so we can all get the hell home.

981
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:49,101
Hannes, my old friend. So glad you could make it.

982
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,271
I knew you had a soft spot for an old-school bidding war.

983
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,439
How have you been?

984
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:57,151
I trust my people implicitly. What they say goes.

985
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,320
Certainly. But I'm sure you'd like to see it for yourself.

986
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,198
Hold it in your hands, check the build quality.

987
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,203
Qr not. Also fine.

988
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:10,289
Well, if you'd like to follow me.

989
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:18,213
You'll have to remove all your metal. Watches, rings, etc.

990
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,632
- Yeah, of course. - Excuse me for asking...

991
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,551
Where might I have seen you before?

992
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,305
I don't know, probably one of my many symposiums.

993
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,473
The book jacket!

994
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:30,392
I have to say, Dr. Michaelakis, I'm a huge fan.

995
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:32,311
Oh, thank you so much.

996
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,897
Which book? There have been so many...

997
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,776
Does Hannes' chippy always talk for you, Doctor?

998
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,612
Doctor?

999
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:48,076
Sorry, when you say "chippy," you are referring to Buffy here, yeah?

1000
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,328
Of course.

1001
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:55,626
Hannes prefers the term "floozy" for all his boy toys.

1002
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,754
- Yeah. He does. That's good. - Noted.

1003
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,881
By the way, I got your email, Dr. Michaelakis.

1004
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,466
You had a query about our ability

1005
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,635
to maintain quantum coherence at room temperature

1006
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:09,264
without the use of dilution, refrigerators, or error correction.

1007
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:10,974
Do you care to elucidate?

1008
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,392
- Right. - Yeah.

1009
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,436
Yes, I did send that email.

1010
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,481
- The other day, I saw you. - I did, I sent it. So what gives?

1011
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:18,982
I'm sorry, what gives...

1012
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,609
I think what she's trying to say...

1013
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,653
Actually, the grown-ups are having a meeting, Buffy.

1014
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:23,987
Okay.

1015
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:25,322
If you'll hold on to that.

1016
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,115
- Yeah, sure, Doctor. - Thank you.

1017
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,660
Now, every seventh grader, even the dumb ones,

1018
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,787
know the second law of thermodynamics.

1019
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,582
"All ordered systems tend toward disorder." Disorder!

1020
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:40,295
So I'm going to ask you one more time, sir, what gives?

1021
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:49,137
Well, it's actually topological quantum order.

1022
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:52,266
The emergence of quantum effects on a macroscopic level.

1023
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,227
So that is, in fact, what gives.

1024
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:01,358
Thank you.

1025
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:11,952
You know, Buffy is not a bad name for you.

1026
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:15,622
You know, buff, firm, taut.

1027
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,499
That's good. Did you just find a thesaurus somewhere?

1028
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:18,876
Nubile.

1029
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:22,087
- That's good. Thank you. Okay. - There we go.

1030
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,099
Sorry, sorry.

1031
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,400
The stick's metal. How are we going to get it out?

1032
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:44,693
Yeah. I don't know.

1033
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,696
This is the housing.

1034
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:52,326
820 million qubit miles of digi-synaptic resonance.

1035
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:00,125
But of course, what sets us apart from anything else on the planet

1036
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:04,922
is the processor, which we playfully refer to as the Magic Broomstick.

1037
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,006
The Broomstick?

1038
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,801
Has the power to clear the contents of any computing system on the planet

1039
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:12,512
and then magically sweep them into your bin.

1040
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,223
Oh! Broomstick. That's funny.

1041
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:18,060
Take a look, vet it however you'd like,

1042
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,479
and tell Hannes we'll be taking bids on Monday.

1043
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,772
Thank you.

1044
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,526
Oh, my God. I must be allergic to something in here.

1045
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,528
What could you possibly be allergic to in here?

1046
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,782
- This room is hermetically sealed. - That's it.

1047
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,700
I'm allergic to hermetic seals.

1048
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,494
If we could get him away from the computer, please.

1049
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,246
- That's the one thing. - Just until he's recovered.

1050
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,873
We're gonna need some anti-bac...

1051
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,793
Do we have alcohol wipes?

1052
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,212
Your hands need to be sterile if you intend to get any closer.

1053
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,464
Do I make myself clear?

1054
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,969
- Sorry. We couldn't... - No, I'm fine.

1055
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,261
...take his medicine into the country.

1056
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:54,513
Yeah...

1057
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:00,352
Can't risk any contamination.

1058
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,188
You're gonna have to stay away from the inner workings.

1059
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,648
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1060
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,316
- All right. If you're done... - Oh. Here you go.

1061
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,110
Sorry about this. Okay. I'm okay.

1062
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,320
This happens to him sometimes. It'll pass.

1063
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,280
Allergies. Nothing you can do.

1064
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:14,366
Well, something you could do, Doctor.

1065
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,721
Okay?

1066
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,478
Search him, please.

1067
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:44,980
Didn't we just do that?

1068
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,398
Are you serious?

1069
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,442
Okay. I wanna run full diagnostics on the system.

1070
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,237
This is completely unnecessary.

1071
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,018
Up, up.

1072
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,227
Okay.

1073
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,792
Hey! I can walk on my own.

1074
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:58,637
Sorry.

1075
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:17,489
Hey!

1076
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,449
I can do that myself.

1077
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,785
We just met, man.

1078
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,245
Handsy, handsy, handsy.

1079
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,466
Hey!

1080
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,137
My eyes are up here, man.

1081
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,638
How do you like it?

1082
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,287
Hey, I'm good.

1083
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:07,998
Turn around.

1084
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,392
Do you have anything?

1085
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,144
I don't know. Can't trust anybody.

1086
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,898
- I'm good. - They're clean.

1087
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,276
Do your final checks and get them out of here.

1088
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,695
Oh, we're walking this way again. Yay.

1089
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:47,787
I don't speak the language.

1090
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,587
See?

1091
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,464
What did I tell you, man? We didn't have anything.

1092
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,092
Thanks, pal. Appreciate that.

1093
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:20,779
Something about a big white dance floor, makes me wanna boogie.

1094
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,114
Hey, thanks for having us.

1095
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,617
That's great stuff.

1096
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,958
Okay.

1097
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,502
You guys are pretty serious about your security, huh?

1098
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:40,548
Okay.

1099
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:44,094
Do I have all my things? I feel like I came in with more stuff.

1100
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,805
Did I come in with more stuff?

1101
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,057
You don't think so?

1102
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,770
Sir, I think you still have my wallet.

1103
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,481
Remember, I, uh, gave it to you when I came in?

1104
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,733
It would be nice to leave with it.

1105
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:04,572
Wallet coming through.

1106
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,040
Sorry, my belt.

1107
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:23,341
I guess that's everything, right?

1108
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:24,509
Thank you.

1109
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:27,137
- That is not a toy, Buffy. - Sorry.

1110
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,935
Go, go, go!

1111
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,319
All right. Drop me off at the market

1112
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,154
so I can get this to the Eye.

1113
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,447
You asked me to call you when they started

1114
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,615
running around like headless chickens.

1115
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,035
Well, that's what's happening.

1116
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,469
This is where your sources told you they'd be?

1117
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:11,348
No, this is where my sources said we might find an answer.

1118
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,277
She must be familiar with your work.

1119
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:25,779
Excuse me.

1120
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,032
Miss, have you seen these people?

1121
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:42,128
She says her grandson spoke to their leader.

1122
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:43,380
He's in the back.

1123
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:45,256
What?

1124
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,217
No "Wow, you speak Mandarin"?

1125
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:21,042
The Coffin to the Beyond.

1126
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:27,048
It was always a flap, or a trap or mirrors.

1127
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:31,678
The audience thought he'd just disappeared.

1128
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,640
But he was always hidden somewhere inside.

1129
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:52,031
I believe that's the prototype for the one your father had made.

1130
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:55,452
He, like many others over the years, ordered his supplies from here.

1131
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,372
Of course.

1132
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:03,168
That's why you gave me the look when I said they were in Macau.

1133
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,420
Your father used to come here when you were young.

1134
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,255
Can I please get some space here?

1135
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:16,514
If you think you're the only one who'd wondered for 30 years what happened...

1136
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,600
...you're not.

1137
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:21,019
Lionel was a master magician.

1138
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,604
Either he gamed the hinges,

1139
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:26,191
so he could kick the door and they would pop out,

1140
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:30,111
or he had access to the lock from the inside so he could pick it.

1141
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:34,866
Word is the safe was made from cheap metal, and it bowed.

1142
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:40,580
Still, he always had something up his sleeve.

1143
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:47,295
Unless he'd reached the limit of his capabilities and his clock ran out.

1144
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:56,596
Excuse me. My grandmother has something you might want.

1145
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,602
This was your father's.

1146
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,896
He had several of these made.

1147
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,917
And the Horsemen?

1148
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,962
I overheard them talking.

1149
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:33,508
One of them, Atlas, he's meeting someone at the market nearby.

1150
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,360
As for former Agent Rhodes,

1151
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:55,029
his location is now your number one priority.

1152
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,282
We're putting out an international APB.

1153
01:07:57,365 --> 01:08:00,118
We have Interpol, including cooperation from local authorities.

1154
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,452
Agent Cowan.

1155
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:05,123
I'm assuming it was actually not you who walked into Newburgh Federal Prison,

1156
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:08,126
then walked out 30 minutes later with Thaddeus Bradley?

1157
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,128
- What? - He used your ID.

1158
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,175
What are you doing, Rhodes?

1159
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,663
- Atlas, hey. - Dylan.

1160
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:47,290
- I blew it, I'm sorry. - What are you doing here?

1161
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:48,583
I'm here to help now.

1162
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:49,959
Okay, we definitely don't need your help.

1163
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:51,336
I know I messed up, all right?

1164
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:52,920
Yeah, you put everybody's lives in danger.

1165
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:55,340
- Where is everybody? - Where is everybody?

1166
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,091
I can't be seen with you, actually, right now.

1167
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:59,135
I got it now, okay? I appreciate you taking

1168
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,762
the time to take control for a little while.

1169
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,513
- Hey, I'm actually... Yeah? - Yeah, but I got it now, all right?

1170
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:03,640
- You do? - Yeah.

1171
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,058
You look like you can get some rest, buddy.

1172
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,644
- Who you meeting here? - I'm not meeting anybody.

1173
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:09,187
They told me at long's you were meeting somebody.

1174
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,189
At long's?

1175
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:14,067
Okay, yeah, no, I am...

1176
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,569
I'm meeting somebody from the Eye.

1177
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:17,862
Yeah, no, they agreed to meet me

1178
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:20,948
to exchange this computer chip for our lives back.

1179
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:22,283
So that's what it's come to now.

1180
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,160
I hope you're happy with the situation you've put us in.

1181
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,745
You're talking to the Eye?

1182
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:26,913
Yeah.

1183
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,831
Why are you talking to the Eye?

1184
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,794
Atlas. Atlas, give me the stick.

1185
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,171
Dylan, you're not our leader anymore, okay?

1186
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,882
You're not our hero. You're not FBI.

1187
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:40,927
You're not a magician. You're not really anything.

1188
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,846
And we trusted you for a year.

1189
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,307
So if you really wanna help us... If you really...

1190
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:49,018
if you really wanna help us, you would leave.

1191
01:09:57,443 --> 01:10:00,738
I get it. Cool. Bye.

1192
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,590
Hello, hello!

1193
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:22,468
Yeah, that was me you called at the magic shop.

1194
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,930
So much fun though, knowing you'd be scurrying away from me at the lab

1195
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,432
just to bring it to me here.

1196
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:29,142
Did you actually think I'd let you go?

1197
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,936
- How did you do that? - Everyone has their button.

1198
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:35,982
You push it and they go blind. And yours, obviously, is ego.

1199
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,567
"Stay the course.

1200
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,403
Great changes are in store.

1201
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,989
Trust that your unique talents

1202
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,657
will not go unrecognized."

1203
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,368
- That was you. - Yeah.

1204
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:48,953
Merritt downloaded all the files,

1205
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,748
but how do you think we were able to find him?

1206
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:52,915
Your phone.

1207
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,794
I asked to see the face behind all of this.

1208
01:10:56,878 --> 01:11:00,047
What you actually put your phone on was a bi-wave siphon pad.

1209
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:05,762
Once again, science beats magic.

1210
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,514
- So, the stick? - No.

1211
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:12,643
I got it!

1212
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:14,145
I got it. I got it.

1213
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,065
- Fuck, Dylan! - Wait, leave them!

1214
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:19,609
You really think I'm gonna walk away from you?

1215
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,152
Give me the stick!

1216
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:22,945
Give me it!

1217
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,990
All right. Don't ever question me again. Beat it!

1218
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:39,337
- So, the stick. - Go to hell.

1219
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:41,172
Boys.

1220
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,561
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1221
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,287
There's like 10 of you.

1222
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,164
Come on, he's just doing tricks.

1223
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:17,124
He's there! Go!

1224
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:45,463
Dylan, watch the pretty birdies fly. And sleep.

1225
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:49,133
- Doesn't work on me. - Not even as a distraction?

1226
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:54,430
- Good job. - Nice to be involved.

1227
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,774
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

1228
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,485
- I just saw Dylan, something happened. - What do you mean you just saw Dylan?

1229
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,612
Dylan's here? What happened?

1230
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:12,156
- Atlas. - I don't know.

1231
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,162
What are they doing?

1232
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:20,665
Those are Walter's men.

1233
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,500
This is what they want.

1234
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:26,087
What the hell? How do you still have that?

1235
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,843
That's Lionel Shrike's safe.

1236
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:35,429
What the hell do they want with that?

1237
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:37,264
Okay, we gotta follow that truck.

1238
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:40,685
They must have Dylan. We don't have much time.

1239
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,315
What do you want?

1240
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:51,028
You to understand something very important.

1241
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:54,365
We are mirror images.

1242
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,741
You see, because like you,

1243
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,077
I share a very deep connection with my father.

1244
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:04,417
And like you, I'll stop at nothing to avenge any wrongs done to him.

1245
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:12,633
You know the only difference between your father and mine?

1246
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:14,593
Mine's still alive.

1247
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:16,512
Get him up.

1248
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:34,363
So, this is the man

1249
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:37,533
who spent a lifetime plotting against me.

1250
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,829
I wouldn't have known your face

1251
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:45,416
if it had been on a billboard outside my bedroom window.

1252
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:49,170
But you have spent, what, 30 years thinking about mine?

1253
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:50,504
When my father died,

1254
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:52,715
your insurance company denied my mother her claims.

1255
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,133
- I wouldn't even have known... - She died a pauper!

1256
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,052
...who your mother was.

1257
01:15:56,135 --> 01:16:00,723
She was a digit, a nanobyte in a stream of data.

1258
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,767
Because nothing is personal to you

1259
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:05,102
and everyone and everything is just a number, isn't that so?

1260
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:07,813
That is where you are wrong, Mr. Rhodes.

1261
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:12,818
Once you made yourself known it became very personal.

1262
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,905
- My son... - Yeah, the sociopath.

1263
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:20,576
Funny thing is, I have seven so-called legitimate children.

1264
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:23,662
Sniveling, snobbish, stupid runts.

1265
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:27,708
I have one illegitimate child who is a lot like me.

1266
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:30,169
The point is, he wants something,

1267
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:35,382
and like any good parent, I will stop at nothing to get it for him.

1268
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:37,218
Your Horsemen have it.

1269
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:41,597
You will turn it and them over to us, now.

1270
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,765
No.

1271
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:49,271
Dylan, I would like you to really take this moment in

1272
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:52,775
because this is the consequence of your personal vendetta come to life

1273
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,610
and staring you in the face.

1274
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,445
I want you to know that when you're gone,

1275
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:57,571
we're not going to stop.

1276
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,740
We're gonna destroy everything you believe in,

1277
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:02,034
starting with the Horsemen, and ending with the Eye.

1278
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,994
Now then, cast your mind back

1279
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:07,206
to standing by the banks of the river watching your father descend,

1280
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,291
disgraced and discredited.

1281
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:12,128
The horrid psychic pain as you have relived for years.

1282
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:16,173
I felt that same thing two years ago

1283
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:19,343
as you drained not just my father's fortune, but his dignity!

1284
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:21,929
And yet you took pleasure from it.

1285
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:27,351
This should bring back some childhood memories.

1286
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:56,589
- Would you like some tea? - Oh. Thank you.

1287
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:14,607
- You ready? - Over to you.

1288
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:22,656
Splash!

1289
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,578
Job done!

1290
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:46,597
Hell is going to seem like a day at the spa

1291
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,141
by the time we're through with these Horsemen.

1292
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,894
- Wouldn't you say? - You had me at "hell."

1293
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:11,163
I love you so much.

1294
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,168
Always keep something up my sleeve.

1295
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:38,000
I wish I could dredge from the muck of my soul

1296
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:42,171
one speck of remorse, but I can't.

1297
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:48,677
So I'll stick to the business at hand and try not to smile too broadly.

1298
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:54,099
And thank you for delivering Mr. Dylan Rhodes.

1299
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:56,602
I take it it's done.

1300
01:20:57,936 --> 01:20:59,897
Literally hit the bottom.

1301
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:06,236
- Now, where are the Horsemen? - They're performers.

1302
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:11,867
Their pride, their ego, their need to be adored are all too powerful

1303
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,827
to keep them out of the limelight for long.

1304
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:19,416
If they don't make themselves known, you will find yourself

1305
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,462
in a very similar position to Mr. Rhodes.

1306
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:27,383
- Are we clear about that? - As clear as the water he's under.

1307
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,435
You'll have the rest when I have the Horsemen.

1308
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:11,760
Dylan!

1309
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,556
Dylan, come on, buddy, breathe!

1310
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:16,849
- Dylan. - Dylan?

1311
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:19,017
Dylan, come on!

1312
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:24,648
You're okay.

1313
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:28,777
Jesus! You scared the hell out of us, man.

1314
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:32,489
- Are you all right, bro? - Okay!

1315
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,533
- Thank you! - This is the least I could do.

1316
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,535
No. There's a hell of a lot less you could've done.

1317
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:37,911
That was not an option.

1318
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:39,872
You took a bullet for us, it was huge.

1319
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,790
You really did, man.

1320
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:46,295
Thanks for pulling me out. Seriously.

1321
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:48,589
Yeah.

1322
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:50,799
You got yourself out. We did the easy part.

1323
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:53,135
Literally, in my case, I was just standing on the shore

1324
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,511
while Atlas jumped down and got you.

1325
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:56,138
I'm serious.

1326
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:58,599
Hey, you guys. Something's not right.

1327
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,392
- What's wrong? - What?

1328
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:04,313
- It's fake. - What?

1329
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,608
No, I had the stick.

1330
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:10,319
The actual stick. I swear, it was in my hand,

1331
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:12,905
in the lab, and then I put it in the little case thing.

1332
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,115
- And I gave it to Atlas. - Right, which I then gave to Dylan.

1333
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,701
Is there any chance you've possibly misplaced it at any point?

1334
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:21,163
No, I took it from you and then slipped it back in your coat

1335
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,998
when I pushed you out.

1336
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:26,293
Either way, we're left holding a whole sack full of NADA.

1337
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:28,962
Yeah, but they're gonna come after us as if we do have something.

1338
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:32,382
No. Okay. I agree that somebody got the better of us. Okay? Somehow.

1339
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:34,885
But I don't agree that we have a sack full of NADA.

1340
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:38,138
Because we're all here. That's a sack full of something.

1341
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:45,812
Listen, we all know that Walter is not going to stop until he gets that chip.

1342
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:49,441
And we're the only ones that even know that he's alive.

1343
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:54,112
We can't just walk away. That's not what the Horsemen do.

1344
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:58,700
There's a quote.

1345
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:00,202
It's actually by the magician

1346
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:02,037
that made me wanna do this in the first place.

1347
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,039
It's...

1348
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:10,796
"A magician's greatest power lies forever shrouded in his empty fist."

1349
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,215
"And the very idea that he can convince the world

1350
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:16,426
that he is, in fact, carrying with him a secret."

1351
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:19,346
- That's Lionel Shrike. - Right.

1352
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:21,682
So what are you saying?

1353
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,977
That we should pretend like we have something we don't?

1354
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:31,441
- What is Walter's greatest fear? - Being seen.

1355
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:35,529
- And what does the stick do? - The stick can unencode anything.

1356
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:40,534
It can open up a back door into any computer on the planet.

1357
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:42,619
- Including his. - Yeah.

1358
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,665
Right, we not only make him think that we have it,

1359
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:50,836
but that we're going to use it to expose and destroy him.

1360
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:54,298
We need a plan. But we don't have time.

1361
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:57,843
We have each other and there are five of us.

1362
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,846
But we also need supplies, right? And resources.

1363
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:04,182
And probably more than five people.

1364
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:08,145
Do you really think you don't have help?

1365
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:10,981
Oh, she speaks English. Of course. Yeah.

1366
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:16,486
Do you know why the Fool is the most powerful card in the tarot?

1367
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:20,198
Not because the person who draws him is a fool.

1368
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:24,703
He's a fool because he's a clean slate,

1369
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:28,707
and, therefore, can become anything.

1370
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,083
You were chosen.

1371
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,669
All of you.

1372
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:37,966
Not because of who you are, but because of who you might become.

1373
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:43,430
When you say "chosen"... Are you part of the Eye?

1374
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:47,559
Yes. We are part of the Eye.

1375
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:50,854
You've each doubted our existence.

1376
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:55,984
Wondering if we, indeed, were watching.

1377
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:03,241
We are. We always have been.

1378
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:05,827
This is the best magic shop in the world.

1379
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:08,121
- You know what she's saying, right? - Yes.

1380
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:10,582
That now we have resources and help.

1381
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,752
Thank you.

1382
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:17,923
So, who's in?

1383
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:24,304
- I'm in. - Yeah, I'm in.

1384
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,141
Let's do this.

1385
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,577
No, no, no.

1386
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,332
Not long ago, we were tricked.

1387
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,335
I was exposed and brought back from the dead.

1388
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:58,255
So we thought it was only fitting that we do the same thing

1389
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:02,676
- to the person who did it to us. - Midnight, New Year's Eve. London.

1390
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:06,012
We will be performing a series of shows that all connect to our big finale,

1391
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:08,223
so pay close attention to each trick.

1392
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:09,391
Get my father.

1393
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,644
Run!

1394
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:15,897
I want Interpol, Scotland Yard, whoever we have in London.

1395
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:17,232
What do we know about Rhodes?

1396
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:19,151
Wherever the Horsemen are, that's where he is.

1397
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,360
Let's get to the airport.

1398
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:22,779
So leave your kiddies at home and get ready for a wild night,

1399
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:25,907
because we, too, will bring someone back from the dead.

1400
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,868
Let's move, everyone!

1401
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:29,828
In front of the largest stage in the world...

1402
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,830
The actual world.

1403
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:35,667
You know they're playing you, right? Leading you into a trap?

1404
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,419
Yeah, but the threat is real.

1405
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:40,172
This card can hack into any system on the planet, including ours.

1406
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,466
They have it, why wouldn't they use it to expose us?

1407
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:44,050
Me. Everything we've done.

1408
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:46,178
Is it real, Mr. McKinney?

1409
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,811
The threat is real.

1410
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:57,147
So, how do we stay ahead of them?

1411
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:59,608
We need to get to London by midnight.

1412
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:09,826
We are here in London

1413
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:12,412
on this New Year's Eve, and the crowds are out in force.

1414
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:13,955
Locals and tourists alike

1415
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:16,166
getting ready for the party of the year.

1416
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:18,168
A video gone viral from the infamous.

1417
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:20,086
Horsemen magicians has surfaced.

1418
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:21,838
They promise to make a grand reappearance.

1419
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:25,008
But will it end in their arrest on national television?

1420
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:26,760
Or some sort of vindication?

1421
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:28,929
Who knows where they'll show up...

1422
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,180
But we do know, wherever,

1423
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:33,600
whenever that is, people will be watching.

1424
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,229
Yeah, texts, tweets, Instagrams.

1425
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:40,273
Anything that says "Horsemen," brags about seeing the Horsemen,

1426
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,025
tag them and bundle them.

1427
01:28:42,108 --> 01:28:44,486
Dad, who do we have security-wise on this? Your guys?

1428
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:45,737
Whoever you want.

1429
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,697
Well, we want all of them and all their friends.

1430
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:49,825
Anyone who wants to work stationed throughout the city,

1431
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,701
so they can be anywhere in 60 seconds.

1432
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:08,802
Hello! Hey!

1433
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,013
My name's Jack Wilder.

1434
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,808
Goddamn, it feels good to be back.

1435
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:18,478
All right, gather around. Indulge me.

1436
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:20,772
I wanna talk to you about something real quick.

1437
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:24,734
You all know Three Card Monte, also known as "Find the Lady"?

1438
01:29:24,818 --> 01:29:29,114
Trick performed by street hustlers all over the world. And why street hustlers?

1439
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:32,075
Because as soon as you walk up to the table, you lose.

1440
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:34,119
Every time. Let me demonstrate.

1441
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:40,709
While we're at it, let's find ourselves a life-sized Queen.

1442
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:42,711
Ma'am, would you mind being my Queen?

1443
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:48,383
Don't worry. I promise you there's a 50 percent chance

1444
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:49,759
you'll get her back after the show.

1445
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:51,636
Head over there. Thank you very much.

1446
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,223
All right. Let's find ourselves some Jacks to serve our Queen!

1447
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:56,600
Trust me, gentlemen.

1448
01:29:56,683 --> 01:30:00,437
I know how these guys work now. They're gonna start with a tease.

1449
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,480
A few little pop-ups.

1450
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:05,442
Something to lure you in. Like...

1451
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:09,654
Well, you know, like Three Card Monte, where the guy goes,

1452
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:12,282
"Looky here, but no, no, looky here!"

1453
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:16,286
Except when all these little tricks are done,

1454
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:18,455
the only thing you're gonna be looking at

1455
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:22,500
is the inside of your own colon, with the words.

1456
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:25,503
"Horsemen" written all over it.

1457
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,797
In blood.

1458
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:31,343
We get the picture, Mr. McKinney.

1459
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,470
And get out of my chair.

1460
01:30:33,553 --> 01:30:35,764
Hello, everybody!

1461
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:37,807
Come close, come on!

1462
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:39,809
All right, all right, so listen.

1463
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:45,357
Tonight, I am going to make something fly using actual magic.

1464
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,192
- Are you ready? - Yeah!

1465
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:50,320
I'm going to take a very large vessel,

1466
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:54,741
I'm gonna make it fly over there and land on the Thames.

1467
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:56,660
Can you handle that?

1468
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:58,286
Same rules apply as before.

1469
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,455
All you need to do is keep your eye on the Queen.

1470
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:01,873
It's as simple as that.

1471
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:03,667
- Are you guys ready? - Yeah!

1472
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,210
Dad, look at this.

1473
01:31:06,544 --> 01:31:07,879
Tag this one. Where does it come from?

1474
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:10,090
Near the river. Looks like the shows are starting.

1475
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:11,675
But we're not the only ones who found them.

1476
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:13,343
- What do you mean? - It's on Channel One.

1477
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:22,852
- Let's go to 2. - Here we go.

1478
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:25,522
Got him. We have a location.

1479
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:27,565
It's Jack Wilder. Here come the Horsemen.

1480
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:29,609
Okay, we're moving. Let's go, let's go.

1481
01:31:29,693 --> 01:31:31,403
Typing in grid coordinates now.

1482
01:31:33,196 --> 01:31:35,824
Turn around. Hide yourselves with the cards.

1483
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:39,661
And here we go. Switch!

1484
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:43,289
You guys still have your eye on her? You want me to go back and do it?

1485
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:46,459
Okay, all right. I'm moving on. And switch.

1486
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,462
Where is she?

1487
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,882
Down at the end? You sure?

1488
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:55,760
All right, can I get a drumroll from my man in the back?

1489
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:57,762
Thank you very much.

1490
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:05,770
There's my girl.

1491
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:08,857
Not my girl, 100 percent your girl.

1492
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:10,275
But just in this situation.

1493
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:12,986
Okay, but I gotta warm up a little bit first. Okay?

1494
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:16,948
So, let me just make something small fly, like...

1495
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:19,159
Fly, fly, fly!

1496
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:22,620
Wow, right? Look at that! Come on, people.

1497
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:25,623
Tough crowd. You, fly!

1498
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:26,833
- Me? - Check your fly.

1499
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:31,963
You like that?

1500
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:33,923
You support that relationship?

1501
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:36,885
That guy had a bird in his pants. That's disgusting.

1502
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,599
Copy that. We've got two sightings reported.

1503
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:45,602
- Heading to Greenwich Market. - Get me Thaddeus.

1504
01:32:45,685 --> 01:32:47,979
Thaddeus, the FBI are here. They're moving.

1505
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:51,149
Let 'em move. That's what the Horsemen want.

1506
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:52,901
Well, what if they get there first? That can't happen.

1507
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:55,111
I guarantee you, they won't.

1508
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:56,404
Find the pattern.

1509
01:32:57,363 --> 01:33:00,325
You do that, and you'll be able to cut them off

1510
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,786
before they get to their final trick.

1511
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:06,581
If it makes you feel better, I'll take care of the FBI.

1512
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:22,305
OK, well, I guess you found me!

1513
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:23,973
We've got a third spot.

1514
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:26,559
Okay, everybody, we're getting a pattern.

1515
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:33,983
Give me two, 13 and 21.

1516
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:37,946
What the hell is that? Freeze that and zoom in.

1517
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:42,826
How the hell did this happen?

1518
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:46,079
He's dead. We watched him drown. How the hell did this happen?

1519
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:48,665
Given that it did happen, the pertinent question is,

1520
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:49,749
what are we gonna do about it?

1521
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:51,584
We're gonna stop him, Dad. We'll stop him.

1522
01:33:51,668 --> 01:33:52,752
Where's my coat?

1523
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:55,547
Walter, for the record, I never loved the safe idea.

1524
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,173
Oh, I know where they're going.

1525
01:33:57,257 --> 01:33:59,843
The next show is Merritt's and it's by the river.

1526
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:01,302
Chase, you need to get to him

1527
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,388
so we can find the Horsemen's entry point for the finale.

1528
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:12,897
I have a confession to make. I've been told I have some control issues.

1529
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:16,317
I've learned that it's really, really hard to control people,

1530
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:20,321
so I'm gonna try to control something that's a lot easier than people.

1531
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:21,781
I'm gonna try to control the weather.

1532
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,741
Yeah, rain...

1533
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:27,787
It'd be a little difficult to make it rain, right?

1534
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:30,623
That would be something that only God can do, right?

1535
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:33,001
I'm gonna do something that God can't do.

1536
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:35,962
I'm not just gonna make it clear up. No, no, no.

1537
01:34:36,045 --> 01:34:38,131
I'm gonna make it actually stop.

1538
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:54,647
And can God do that? No, I don't think so.

1539
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:57,066
Or what about make it go up?

1540
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:06,743
Are you still with me?

1541
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:09,871
Watch the Queen on the left. Let's do it. Turn around.

1542
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:14,375
Switch!

1543
01:35:18,087 --> 01:35:19,255
Show me the lady.

1544
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:22,133
Show me the lady!

1545
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:23,384
The end? End?

1546
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:27,889
You know what? I'm actually starting to feel kinda bad.

1547
01:35:29,015 --> 01:35:32,101
It's just because I can actually feel that you guys are paying attention.

1548
01:35:32,185 --> 01:35:33,811
It's just that...

1549
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:37,315
You know, it's unfortunate that it's the wrong kind of attention.

1550
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:41,027
Yeah, we need a fresher bird.

1551
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:45,323
He's so cute. He's so cute!

1552
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:47,116
Let's kill him, right?

1553
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:52,205
- Merritt, move into position. - Got it, Dylan.

1554
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:53,957
I'm on my way. I'll see you there.

1555
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,417
Lula, stand by, all right?

1556
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:58,836
Or, what about just go, I don't know, just go insane?

1557
01:36:08,388 --> 01:36:10,848
Reports are coming in from all over London

1558
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:14,519
as the Horsemen appear to have taken over the whole city for their show.

1559
01:36:17,563 --> 01:36:21,234
Hey, broski-whaddya-knowski? Where you headed?

1560
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:22,610
- Please, bro, don't do this. - Where are you headed?

1561
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:24,487
North, south, east?

1562
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:26,864
East. Tower of London?

1563
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:29,701
Tower Bridge? Near Tower Bridge? The Thames!

1564
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:34,330
You're going to the Thamesy-Whemsy! You're so easy!

1565
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:37,041
Bro, if there's any chance of us ever having a relationship...

1566
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:39,502
There's not. Where's your entry?

1567
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:43,381
South Bank? Greenwich? Greenwich.

1568
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:47,093
I know where you're going. I know where...

1569
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:49,804
Watch it, hobo.

1570
01:36:52,724 --> 01:36:55,226
Hey, Merritt. Oh, come on. Tell me you're kidding. How?

1571
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:58,396
When?

1572
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:01,107
Shit. All right. All right, I got it.

1573
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:03,234
Don't worry about it. I'll warn the others.

1574
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:07,864
Sorry. Just...

1575
01:37:10,533 --> 01:37:11,617
What? I just told you...

1576
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:12,702
Phone call.

1577
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,204
- Hello? - Lula.

1578
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:18,624
Dylan. Yeah, kind of in the middle of something right now.

1579
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:21,294
Wrap it up. Meet me at the rendezvous point now.

1580
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:22,628
- What? - Now!

1581
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,298
Was that an act of God?

1582
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:28,468
No. No, no, no, that was an act of me

1583
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:31,721
and the strobe lights and rain machines.

1584
01:37:31,804 --> 01:37:33,723
And I hope you guys were paying attention.

1585
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,975
Because you're gonna need to know all of that for the final.

1586
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:42,648
So how did I do it? Did I use a Barry Trap?

1587
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:45,026
Maybe some switches or a few duplicates?

1588
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:46,152
Jack, go now!

1589
01:37:46,235 --> 01:37:47,278
You know what? I hate to say it.

1590
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:49,113
You're gonna have to wait to find out. I know.

1591
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,616
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I love you all.

1592
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:56,120
Lula, go!

1593
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:58,289
I have to go.

1594
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:21,354
Out of the way, FBI! Move, move, move! Go!

1595
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:23,147
Get some men in that park!

1596
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:24,357
Men in the park, now!

1597
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,567
You gonna fill up on appetizers?

1598
01:38:26,651 --> 01:38:29,278
Or save room for the main course?

1599
01:38:29,362 --> 01:38:31,155
Where the hell are the Horsemen?

1600
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:32,490
You can chase them all you want,

1601
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:35,034
you're just gonna wind up holding your own tails.

1602
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:38,830
Or, you can let them come to you.

1603
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:40,498
So, what's it gonna be?

1604
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:41,707
Chase them?

1605
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:44,085
Or make a deal with me?

1606
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:52,343
Again? How did we get found out again?

1607
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:54,178
It's fine, it's fine. We'll just cut to the finale.

1608
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:55,763
- Where's Merritt? - Fine. I don't know.

1609
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:56,848
I'm here.

1610
01:38:56,931 --> 01:38:58,724
- Where's Lula? - I'm right here!

1611
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:00,685
What the hell happened?

1612
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:02,645
- My goddamn brother happened. - Don't worry about it.

1613
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:04,188
We just gotta get to the destination.

1614
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:06,190
- Lula, can you handle that thing? - I can ride it.

1615
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,276
Have you asked the guys that question, or just me?

1616
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:09,610
- Yeah, good point. - Let's go!

1617
01:39:09,694 --> 01:39:10,778
No, Jack.

1618
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:16,451
Shit!

1619
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:20,830
Jack's down. We gotta get him.

1620
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:25,251
Come on, move!

1621
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:32,967
- Jack! Go, go! - That's the brake.

1622
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:34,635
That's the gas. You'll figure it out.

1623
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,387
Come on, follow me!

1624
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,681
That's it?

1625
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:56,908
- Hey, ready? - Yeah!

1626
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:05,082
Get on.

1627
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,047
- Yeah! - Okay, guys, I'm coming!

1628
01:40:12,131 --> 01:40:13,424
Jesus!

1629
01:40:14,884 --> 01:40:16,636
I'm coming!

1630
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:26,604
- Get up! Come on! - Okay.

1631
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:29,190
You got me.

1632
01:40:29,273 --> 01:40:31,442
Those things are really dangerous!

1633
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:35,404
- Come on! - Go!

1634
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:39,367
Get him in! Move it!

1635
01:40:43,788 --> 01:40:45,456
What is happening?

1636
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,792
Where are they?

1637
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:49,877
They should be arriving any second.

1638
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:53,589
That is, if they're gonna get here by midnight.

1639
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:08,271
Okay, feeling fear.

1640
01:41:08,646 --> 01:41:11,315
Fear. Anger, anger.

1641
01:41:12,024 --> 01:41:15,027
- Oh, full house! - That's enough.

1642
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:18,030
I was done.

1643
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:23,077
So nice to see you all again.

1644
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:28,666
But since we're such old friends, let's skip the formalities.

1645
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:34,422
One of you has something we require.

1646
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:37,717
So give it over.

1647
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:48,185
Nothing at all?

1648
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:50,605
Really?

1649
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:55,067
Sit down!

1650
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:03,701
Let's go, let's go!

1651
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:06,287
Let's go, let's go!

1652
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:08,956
Hurry up and move them quickly before they can do anything.

1653
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,207
Get those lights off me!

1654
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:17,548
Get on the plane!

1655
01:42:20,509 --> 01:42:21,761
Hey!

1656
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:25,389
Get on the plane!

1657
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:36,275
- Hey! - Hey!

1658
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:38,235
Yeah, take off immediately.

1659
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:44,283
You know, you make it almost too easy?

1660
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:48,037
I mean, even your hilarious attempts to make yourselves unpredictable,

1661
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,955
just follow the same pattern each time.

1662
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:52,041
Set up, set up, set up.

1663
01:42:52,124 --> 01:42:53,376
Big reveal.

1664
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:55,836
Which tonight was going to be stroke of midnight,

1665
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,631
middle of the Thames? Tell me if I'm warm.

1666
01:43:03,552 --> 01:43:07,348
Well, there will be a big reveal, and it will come now.

1667
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:12,186
The stick, dear boy.

1668
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:14,021
- No. - Fine.

1669
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:16,816
Start with her.

1670
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:19,193
Hey, hey, hey!

1671
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:24,782
- Give it to him. - Danny, give him the card.

1672
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:26,701
- Just give it to him. - Danny, come on.

1673
01:43:36,752 --> 01:43:37,878
We'll have a closer look.

1674
01:43:46,345 --> 01:43:48,305
Okay, I owe you an apology.

1675
01:43:48,389 --> 01:43:50,683
Leader, you should have planned an escape, okay?

1676
01:43:50,766 --> 01:43:52,351
- This is the both of us. - Okay, it's the both of us.

1677
01:43:52,435 --> 01:43:53,936
- Guys, come on! - Come on, stop!

1678
01:43:54,019 --> 01:43:56,814
- You, to save your little girlfriend! - To save my...

1679
01:43:56,897 --> 01:43:59,150
- He had a knife to her head! - I'm a Horseman, you dick!

1680
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:00,693
All right, you know what? This is not the time!

1681
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:02,194
And you, what's your deal, man?

1682
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:04,405
Look, they're not gonna get blood all over the seats.

1683
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:06,115
They're probably gonna throw us out of the plane.

1684
01:44:06,198 --> 01:44:07,491
- Really? - I'm sorry to interrupt,

1685
01:44:07,575 --> 01:44:09,660
but I just have to say congratulations.

1686
01:44:09,744 --> 01:44:10,953
And thank you!

1687
01:44:12,538 --> 01:44:13,748
It's real.

1688
01:44:13,831 --> 01:44:15,249
What?

1689
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:16,834
It's real?

1690
01:44:18,544 --> 01:44:19,587
Bring them through.

1691
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:20,755
Did you say it's real?

1692
01:44:20,838 --> 01:44:21,839
What is he talking about?

1693
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:23,132
Move!

1694
01:44:23,215 --> 01:44:24,717
Well done, my boy.

1695
01:44:28,596 --> 01:44:31,015
Cote Du Marisule champagne.

1696
01:44:31,098 --> 01:44:35,186
It's the most expensive bottle on Earth.

1697
01:44:36,103 --> 01:44:38,230
$1.2 million.

1698
01:44:38,314 --> 01:44:42,318
And I saved it just for this occasion.

1699
01:44:42,401 --> 01:44:46,655
Honestly, same bottle, Liquor Shack, 700K.

1700
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:49,825
Hey. You got what you wanted.

1701
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:52,453
So, does this mean you're letting us go?

1702
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:55,456
Knowing what you know about us? No.

1703
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:59,210
- You sure? - Chase, what shall we do?

1704
01:45:01,003 --> 01:45:03,172
Toss them out.

1705
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:05,800
Get your last words in quickly, everybody!

1706
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,180
- No! Come on! No! - Farewell.

1707
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:13,766
Oh, God! No!

1708
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:17,436
Wait! I just wanna say...

1709
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,772
I came into the world with the wrong family,

1710
01:45:19,855 --> 01:45:21,816
but I'm leaving with the right one.

1711
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:23,442
I love you guys!

1712
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:24,568
- No! - No, no, no!

1713
01:45:26,403 --> 01:45:28,823
This is how I kicked you out of the womb.

1714
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:29,990
No!

1715
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:32,868
Who's next?

1716
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:40,876
No, wait! Let me go!

1717
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:43,295
Let go of me!

1718
01:45:43,379 --> 01:45:45,673
No, no, no!

1719
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:47,424
- Let me go! - Toss her!

1720
01:45:50,886 --> 01:45:52,763
Oh, God!

1721
01:45:52,847 --> 01:45:55,850
Hurry up and shut that door! It's getting cold in here.

1722
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:57,852
Okay, hit the road, Jack!

1723
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:04,608
No, no, no!

1724
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:08,279
A lot of brain, but not enough brawn.

1725
01:46:12,074 --> 01:46:13,075
Oh, that was fun!

1726
01:46:15,953 --> 01:46:18,956
Cheers! Well done, my boy.

1727
01:46:24,879 --> 01:46:27,047
No, is it supposed to taste like that?

1728
01:46:27,172 --> 01:46:28,632
No, it is not.

1729
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:50,029
What the hell is going on?

1730
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:02,291
Okay, come pick them up!

1731
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,710
- Come on. - Come on out.

1732
01:47:18,015 --> 01:47:21,852
Ladies and gentlemen... The Horsemen!

1733
01:47:42,206 --> 01:47:44,458
No, you should feel pretty good about yourself, man.

1734
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:48,087
You predicted it correctly. The Thames, stroke of midnight.

1735
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:49,964
New Year's Eve. Happy New Year!

1736
01:47:57,012 --> 01:47:58,263
Unbelievable!

1737
01:47:58,347 --> 01:47:59,682
- We are moving now. - The whole thing just changed.

1738
01:47:59,765 --> 01:48:02,518
- All backup into position stat! - We're on the move.

1739
01:48:04,019 --> 01:48:06,230
- You're staying here! - Of course.

1740
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:15,447
Move! Move! Out of the way!

1741
01:48:15,531 --> 01:48:17,741
Wow! Thank you very much, London!

1742
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:22,121
We would like to acknowledge not just our old friend, Arthur Tressler.

1743
01:48:22,204 --> 01:48:24,748
But his young and very brilliant son, Walter Mabry.

1744
01:48:24,832 --> 01:48:27,251
Who has performed one of the greatest feats of illusion

1745
01:48:27,334 --> 01:48:28,961
even we have ever seen.

1746
01:48:29,044 --> 01:48:33,257
He has, amazingly, brought himself back from the dead!

1747
01:48:34,216 --> 01:48:37,386
But before he did that, he revealed someone.

1748
01:48:37,469 --> 01:48:42,599
And we think it only right to give him a proper introduction.

1749
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:46,687
He is our friend and he is our leader. Dylan Shrike!

1750
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:48,772
- Get over here! - Yeah!

1751
01:48:54,653 --> 01:49:01,493
So, normally only the magician, his assistant, and a few trusted stage hands

1752
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:03,787
know the secret of a trick.

1753
01:49:03,871 --> 01:49:06,874
But tonight, however, in this effect,

1754
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:10,044
all of you people around the Thames here.

1755
01:49:10,127 --> 01:49:14,757
And since we're streaming live, everyone around the world

1756
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:17,342
already knows everything.

1757
01:49:17,426 --> 01:49:21,513
And only these fellows here are the ones left in the dark.

1758
01:49:21,597 --> 01:49:24,516
So let's see how closely you were watching our shows.

1759
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:28,312
Remember when we were playing "Find the Lady," and I said

1760
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:30,314
that we used a Barry Trap.

1761
01:49:31,106 --> 01:49:34,693
Some classic switches and a few duplicates?

1762
01:49:34,777 --> 01:49:38,280
Well, that's how we switched the driver of the truck.

1763
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:43,619
Which took us to a duplicate hangar

1764
01:49:43,702 --> 01:49:46,246
where we used your need to rush,

1765
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:49,333
and your fear of being seen let you do the work for us.

1766
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:51,210
Get those lights off me!

1767
01:49:52,503 --> 01:49:56,757
So, the airplane. How did we get it to fly?

1768
01:49:57,841 --> 01:50:02,638
Well, we used fans, and lights and rain machines.

1769
01:50:07,893 --> 01:50:12,523
Obviously, all of this was reliant on us getting caught.

1770
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:13,899
But we needed to make sure

1771
01:50:13,982 --> 01:50:16,068
that you would do exactly what we needed you to do

1772
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:17,653
once you did catch us.

1773
01:50:17,736 --> 01:50:23,784
My brother Chase, who was technical adviser to the losing team.

1774
01:50:23,867 --> 01:50:26,537
He taught us that it's all about blind spots.

1775
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:28,288
I know where you're going!

1776
01:50:28,372 --> 01:50:31,834
And... surprises.

1777
01:50:33,669 --> 01:50:35,212
Watch it, hobo.

1778
01:50:35,295 --> 01:50:36,964
Why don't you watch the watch I'm wearing,

1779
01:50:37,047 --> 01:50:39,675
the where of where you're watching, and sleep!

1780
01:50:39,758 --> 01:50:43,095
It's going to be your idea to throw the Horsemen out of the plane.

1781
01:50:43,178 --> 01:50:45,639
If all of this is kind of confusing to you,

1782
01:50:45,722 --> 01:50:47,683
I can maybe catch you up on it later.

1783
01:50:47,766 --> 01:50:50,185
Probably see you what, three to five?

1784
01:50:51,353 --> 01:50:55,732
Come on, put it there. Hey! Tit for tat, bro!

1785
01:50:56,275 --> 01:50:59,236
Basically, we showed them everything.

1786
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:04,616
How you kidnapped us to steal the very thing that is in your pocket right now.

1787
01:51:06,827 --> 01:51:08,203
Whoops!

1788
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:14,293
You know, this thing here,

1789
01:51:14,376 --> 01:51:17,838
which you said you could use to adjust markets,

1790
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:21,592
manipulate governments, and spy on whomever you choose.

1791
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:23,510
Also, you could, as you said,

1792
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:26,763
control the public from outside the grid.

1793
01:51:27,681 --> 01:51:32,978
These men destroy people's lives.

1794
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:37,107
Spying on the world, robbing you of your right to privacy.

1795
01:51:37,191 --> 01:51:40,444
And they do that by hiding in the dark.

1796
01:51:40,527 --> 01:51:45,073
So, in the Horsemen tradition, we're here to expose them.

1797
01:51:45,157 --> 01:51:50,204
Tonight, they, like all of us,

1798
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:53,457
are finally stepping into the light.

1799
01:51:57,419 --> 01:51:58,587
Thank you, everybody!

1800
01:51:58,670 --> 01:52:01,298
We are the Horsemen and we will be back very soon!

1801
01:52:03,592 --> 01:52:07,596
Five, four, three, two, one!

1802
01:52:24,446 --> 01:52:27,032
- Hey, we're on the clock. - Get a move on.

1803
01:52:30,118 --> 01:52:31,245
There they are!

1804
01:52:31,328 --> 01:52:33,372
- There's more inside. - Don't you bloody touch me!

1805
01:52:33,455 --> 01:52:35,123
The Horsemen are over on the...

1806
01:52:37,918 --> 01:52:39,378
Oh, shit!

1807
01:52:40,045 --> 01:52:41,838
Stay with them!

1808
01:52:41,922 --> 01:52:43,924
Everybody spread out!

1809
01:52:44,007 --> 01:52:45,842
Nobody leaves this barge!

1810
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:50,847
Rhodes, hold it right there! Do not move!

1811
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,188
This contains everything.

1812
01:52:58,272 --> 01:53:01,358
Not just Walter and Tressler, but all their dealings.

1813
01:53:01,441 --> 01:53:04,444
All their contacts, the entire network.

1814
01:53:04,528 --> 01:53:06,738
And why on Earth would I believe you?

1815
01:53:06,822 --> 01:53:10,492
I told you. I'm the same man I've always been.

1816
01:53:10,575 --> 01:53:13,036
Move it! Come on! Let's go, go, go!

1817
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:15,914
I'm not part of this organization! I'm Merritt.

1818
01:53:15,998 --> 01:53:19,209
I'm a patsy! I'm a patsy!

1819
01:53:20,127 --> 01:53:22,004
Ten minutes.

1820
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:25,841
Now you're playing the long game.

1821
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:41,940
Dad, I promise you I will fix this.

1822
01:53:42,024 --> 01:53:44,401
You can't. Stop calling me dad.

1823
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:48,405
There were so many women, I have no idea whose bastard you are.

1824
01:53:48,488 --> 01:53:49,614
What?

1825
01:53:49,698 --> 01:53:52,034
- What happened? - Thin air, gone. Come with me.

1826
01:53:52,117 --> 01:53:55,746
What're you talking about, gone? People don't just disappear.

1827
01:53:55,829 --> 01:53:58,540
You realize that he doesn't actually have magical powers!

1828
01:54:38,246 --> 01:54:39,664
- Hey, guys. - Hey!

1829
01:54:39,748 --> 01:54:42,167
- Good to see you all. - Good to see you, Li.

1830
01:54:43,293 --> 01:54:44,419
Come on in.

1831
01:54:47,672 --> 01:54:50,509
Good morning. Welcome.

1832
01:54:52,969 --> 01:54:56,515
I'm proud of you. All of you.

1833
01:54:56,598 --> 01:55:00,102
I have a lot to show you. Come.

1834
01:55:01,353 --> 01:55:02,604
Come.

1835
01:55:13,949 --> 01:55:15,158
Dad.

1836
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:34,219
Yes.

1837
01:55:34,302 --> 01:55:37,055
Your father and I were partners.

1838
01:55:37,139 --> 01:55:40,267
Our act was that of rivals.

1839
01:55:41,476 --> 01:55:47,107
I was the hard-eyed realist. He was the dreamy-eyed idealist.

1840
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:49,901
We thought it was the perfect misdirect.

1841
01:55:50,986 --> 01:55:54,656
Yes, in public, I did goad him.

1842
01:55:54,739 --> 01:55:59,578
The only thing we didn't count on was it going so wrong.

1843
01:56:03,582 --> 01:56:05,417
Why?

1844
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:07,252
Why didn't you ever say anything to me?

1845
01:56:07,335 --> 01:56:08,837
I don't know.

1846
01:56:10,005 --> 01:56:11,298
Give it a name.

1847
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:14,801
Shame, guilt. Regret.

1848
01:56:18,555 --> 01:56:21,516
Hey, guys, you might wanna come take a look at this.

1849
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:26,938
Look.

1850
01:56:27,022 --> 01:56:28,815
I put you in jail, man.

1851
01:56:28,899 --> 01:56:31,234
Why didn't you say something then?

1852
01:56:31,318 --> 01:56:34,321
Well, you know, I was going to.

1853
01:56:34,404 --> 01:56:39,034
But then, you were so quick to show your personal motivations that...

1854
01:56:40,327 --> 01:56:43,705
Well, quite frankly it spoiled the trick for me.

1855
01:56:43,788 --> 01:56:45,081
I showed my weakness.

1856
01:56:45,165 --> 01:56:47,959
Well, it showed you weren't ready.

1857
01:56:48,043 --> 01:56:50,670
But when you came back to my cell,

1858
01:56:50,754 --> 01:56:55,175
you had let go of your 30-year vendetta against me...

1859
01:56:56,176 --> 01:56:57,636
...for your Horsemen.

1860
01:56:59,221 --> 01:57:03,934
And I said to myself, "That's Lionel's boy."

1861
01:57:04,809 --> 01:57:08,188
And I knew it was my job to see to it

1862
01:57:08,271 --> 01:57:11,983
that he became the magician he was born to be.

1863
01:57:12,067 --> 01:57:14,402
All that was left then was...

1864
01:57:16,154 --> 01:57:17,489
For me to hit bottom.

1865
01:57:18,281 --> 01:57:23,119
So the safe, my father's wristwatch, that was all you?

1866
01:57:25,914 --> 01:57:29,251
Walter and Tressler, were they in on it too?

1867
01:57:29,334 --> 01:57:32,170
Oh, we knew Walter was in hiding.

1868
01:57:32,254 --> 01:57:35,966
The Octa show was a setup to expose him to the public.

1869
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:41,137
And you were right about the Horsemen.

1870
01:57:41,221 --> 01:57:46,268
They needed to learn to work together like a single organism.

1871
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:56,570
Now I know why you look so familiar.

1872
01:57:56,653 --> 01:57:58,238
You're the Horsemen, aren't you?

1873
01:58:05,954 --> 01:58:07,372
Okay.

1874
01:58:07,455 --> 01:58:09,499
But that can't be what all this is about.

1875
01:58:09,583 --> 01:58:14,087
You know, the best tricks work on many levels.

1876
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:18,133
And the deepest one, for me, at least,

1877
01:58:18,216 --> 01:58:21,011
is this moment right here.

1878
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:26,141
I'm sorry, Dylan.

1879
01:58:26,808 --> 01:58:29,311
I miss your father.

1880
01:58:29,394 --> 01:58:32,897
Thirty years is a long time to drag something around, isn't it?

1881
01:58:32,981 --> 01:58:34,649
Yes, it is.

1882
01:58:44,618 --> 01:58:45,869
So, now what?

1883
01:58:48,330 --> 01:58:51,207
- Now I'm about out of moves. - Oh...

1884
01:58:51,291 --> 01:58:52,626
And I'm tired.

1885
01:58:52,709 --> 01:58:55,045
Come on, you're the one who said that you believe that this road

1886
01:58:55,128 --> 01:58:57,088
led to the great wizard behind the curtain.

1887
01:58:57,172 --> 01:58:58,214
I did.

1888
01:58:58,298 --> 01:59:00,425
And that you'd finally get to look him in the eyes.

1889
01:59:01,843 --> 01:59:03,511
I am.

1890
01:59:09,309 --> 01:59:11,770
It's your game now.

1891
01:59:11,853 --> 01:59:14,439
You play it however you see fit.

1892
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:21,529
My suggestion, however, is that you find yourself a successor.

1893
01:59:21,613 --> 01:59:23,490
Hi. Okay, so...

1894
01:59:23,573 --> 01:59:26,868
Well, obviously, we have a few questions. Right?

1895
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:29,454
Uh... By "a few," I think he means, like, five million.

1896
01:59:29,537 --> 01:59:31,081
- Yeah. - Well.

1897
01:59:31,164 --> 01:59:32,999
Good luck to you all.

1898
01:59:33,083 --> 01:59:34,709
- Okay. See, that's not fair. - What!

1899
01:59:34,793 --> 01:59:35,877
- Come on. - That's not right.

1900
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:37,253
That's gonna make me really angry!

1901
01:59:37,337 --> 01:59:38,505
Not right now.

1902
01:59:38,588 --> 01:59:40,215
Oh, by the way...

1903
01:59:42,425 --> 01:59:44,928
Pay no attention to the curtain.

1904
01:59:47,847 --> 01:59:49,182
There is a curtain.

1905
01:59:49,265 --> 01:59:50,600
Go, go, go.

1906
01:59:59,984 --> 02:00:04,447
Seeing is believing. But is it truth?

1907
02:00:04,531 --> 02:00:07,158
Depends on your point of view.

1908
02:00:07,242 --> 02:00:09,744
Are you listening, Horsemen?

1909
02:00:09,828 --> 02:00:14,165
When you emerge, and you will,

1910
02:00:14,249 --> 02:00:17,377
I will be there waiting.

1911
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:23,049
Because mark my words, you will get what's coming to you

1912
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:25,760
in ways you can't expect.

1913
02:00:26,636 --> 02:00:29,305
But very much deserve.

1914
02:00:29,389 --> 02:00:32,517
Because one thing I believe in

1915
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:36,479
is an eye for an eye.
