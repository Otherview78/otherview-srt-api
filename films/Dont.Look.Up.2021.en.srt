<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the...
- I don't know.</font>

3
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:10,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said the driver
ran in front of her.</font>

4
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:12,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing she could have
done to avoid hitting him.</font>

5
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:14,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was he running away from?</font>

6
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:25,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just one last question
and then you're free to go.</font>

7
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:28,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">After the accident, did
you notice anyone else?</font>

8
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chasing the driver, or—</font>

9
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:34,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie?</font>

10
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:36,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see anything?</font>

11
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey hun, how was your day?</font>

12
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:30,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good idea.</font>

13
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, boy.</font>

14
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:35,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a day.</font>

15
00:06:35,503 --> 00:06:36,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope yours was better.</font>

16
00:06:38,072 --> 00:06:41,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you get a lot
of studying done?</font>

17
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:45,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumb question.</font>

18
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your exam's only a few days
away, of course you did.</font>

19
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:50,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be able to relax soon.</font>

20
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:54,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because once you pass
your LSAT, we're home free.</font>

21
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:57,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">You at law school, me teaching
at the Junior College.</font>

22
00:06:57,991 --> 00:07:01,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the time you graduate,
I'll have my PhD.</font>

23
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:06,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, it's off
to San Francisco.</font>

24
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:09,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">City of brotherly love.</font>

25
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:13,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can get a house, and a
dog, all those other things,</font>

26
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,009

27
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:17,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too bad I can't
meet your parents, but...</font>

28
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:23,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">after that, that's the next
five years all mapped out.</font>

wanted, isn't it, Frankie?</font>

30
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:01,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

31
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:07,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

32
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:09,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

33
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:12,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">That crate needs to be
recovered immediately.</font>

34
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Insurance?</font>

35
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:17,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't give a damn
about the insurance!</font>

36
00:08:18,072 --> 00:08:20,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't cover
the cost of another life.</font>

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,829

by later on to tow your car</font>

44
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,935

50
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:30,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna need the keys.</font>

51
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:33,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the car?</font>

52
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:34,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, right, let me just...</font>

53
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:45,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

54
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, I'll have
the car back to you—</font>

55
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:19,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie?</font>

56
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:20,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it, what's wrong?</font>

57
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, the guy's truck
gets jacked, he runs,</font>

58
00:14:05,452 --> 00:14:06,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you hit him.</font>

59
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:08,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you even doing here?</font>

60
00:14:08,323 --> 00:14:09,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be at home resting?</font>

61
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:11,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Steve had a thesis
meeting with his PhD</font>

62
00:14:12,093 --> 00:14:13,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">advisor and I just—</font>

63
00:14:13,427 --> 00:14:15,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, were you on your phone?</font>

64
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:16,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, when you
killed the guy?</font>

65
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you texting someone,
or distracted?</font>

66
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:19,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that's enough.</font>

67
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:21,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, the guy's ghost
could be haunting her right</font>

68
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:23,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">- now, you don't know.
- Lewis!</font>

69
00:14:23,104 --> 00:14:24,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

70
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is why you'll always
be single.</font>

71
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's get another round
of birthday</font>

72
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:29,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">shots for the birthday douche.</font>

73
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, boy!</font>

74
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:33,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, shots, shots, shots,
shots, shots, shots, shots,</font>

75
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:34,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">shots.</font>

76
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:53,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was someone in the house.</font>

77
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:56,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or something.</font>

78
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:00,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't believe me.</font>

79
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:13,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, it's still fresh.</font>

80
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure once the shock
wears off everything will—</font>

81
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:17,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, go right back to normal?</font>

82
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:30,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey you,
do you want to dance?</font>

83
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:32,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ew.</font>

84
00:15:36,843 --> 00:15:38,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Lewis got himself
kicked out.</font>

85
00:15:39,013 --> 00:15:39,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're heading
back to the house.</font>

86
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:45,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Frankie!</font>

87
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:48,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">See that guy over there?</font>

88
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:50,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's gonna make
a move really, really soon.</font>

89
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you stay with me?</font>

90
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:53,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, 30 minutes max, please?</font>

91
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll catch up
with you guys in a bit!</font>

92
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:02,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

93
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Helps chase it down.</font>

94
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:05,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chase what down?</font>

95
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">The answer to all your problems.</font>

96
00:16:10,244 --> 00:16:12,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Molly,
but one pill</font>

97
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:14,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">isn't going to magically make
everything better.</font>

98
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:15,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what if it does?</font>

99
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:20,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not feeling well.</font>

100
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:24,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm gonna be sick.</font>

101
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:40,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what's your name?</font>

102
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:44,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to dance?</font>

103
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:44,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Molly?</font>

104
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:46,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Molly, is that you?</font>

105
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:53,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Molly?</font>

106
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:23,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

107
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Molly!</font>

108
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:50,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Molly, please help!</font>

109
00:20:42,383 --> 00:20:43,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your birthday's
always the worst.</font>

110
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:46,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd Frankie
and Molly get off to?</font>

111
00:20:46,354 --> 00:20:48,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're smart, probably bailed.</font>

112
00:20:48,556 --> 00:20:49,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie
wouldn't do that.</font>

113
00:20:49,523 --> 00:20:50,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to Jonah!</font>

114
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:53,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would she, lover boy?</font>

115
00:20:53,893 --> 00:20:56,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie's got a boyfriend,
Steve, remember?</font>

116
00:20:56,997 --> 00:21:00,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, I could never—</font>

117
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:03,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Frankie, we were
just talking about you.</font>

118
00:21:04,838 --> 00:21:06,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything alright?</font>

119
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:16,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you said
the killer was a mannequin?</font>

120
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a Bloomingdale's
mannequin?</font>

121
00:21:19,353 --> 00:21:20,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is this happening?</font>

122
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:21,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">What exactly did happen?</font>

123
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:23,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie said Molly's
throat was slit, but—</font>

124
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you actually believe her?</font>

125
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:28,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drake,
can you shut him up for us?</font>

126
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:31,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, people have been
dying around her,</font>

127
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:32,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">two nights in a row.</font>

128
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:34,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen
her like this before.</font>

129
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:35,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even when
her parents died.</font>

130
00:21:35,703 --> 00:21:37,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean with what she's been
through in the past 24 hours,</font>

131
00:21:37,971 --> 00:21:38,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's enough to make anyone—</font>

132
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:40,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">See a mannequin?</font>

133
00:21:43,943 --> 00:21:46,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, Jonah,
you alright, man?</font>

134
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm calling it a night.</font>

135
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's go.</font>

136
00:23:17,138 --> 00:23:20,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I got your dog!</font>

137
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:29,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me,
I said I got your dog!</font>

138
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I help you with something?</font>

139
00:26:22,156 --> 00:26:23,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-mm.</font>

140
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:33,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

141
00:26:34,568 --> 00:26:37,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">The police are gonna
catch whoever did this.</font>

142
00:26:37,271 --> 00:26:40,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's their job.</font>

143
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:42,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">No they won't.</font>

144
00:26:42,543 --> 00:26:44,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't believe me,
they think I'm crazy.</font>

145
00:26:44,778 --> 00:26:48,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are not... crazy.</font>

146
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:55,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something did happen last
night, something awful.</font>

147
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:58,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there's an
explanation for it.</font>

148
00:26:58,225 --> 00:26:59,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">A gas leak?</font>

149
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:01,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bad drugs?</font>

150
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:03,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, but whatever
it is, it isn't a...</font>

151
00:27:10,938 --> 00:27:12,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go talk to my advisor.</font>

152
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him I need
a few days off.</font>

153
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:21,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">That way I can
be there for you.</font>

154
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:26,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help you through this.</font>

155
00:27:26,654 --> 00:27:27,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sound good?</font>

156
00:27:31,825 --> 00:27:33,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

157
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:49,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve?</font>

158
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes?</font>

159
00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:55,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need
you to believe me.</font>

160
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:17,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ran all night.</font>

161
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:21,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter where I went,
it was there.</font>

162
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:24,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know
why it didn't kill me.</font>

163
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:27,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it was just
toying with me.</font>

164
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:28,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever it is—</font>

165
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:30,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">It kills.</font>

166
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:32,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't sure at first,
but I saw it the night</font>

167
00:28:32,386 --> 00:28:33,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hit the driver.</font>

168
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:35,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then at the club.</font>

169
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Molly, and now you.</font>

170
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's coming or us.</font>

171
00:28:39,893 --> 00:28:41,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of us.</font>

172
00:28:41,495 --> 00:28:42,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is ridiculous.</font>

173
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:45,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're talking like this is one
of those Reddit Creepypasta</font>

174
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:47,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">things, like Slenderman.</font>

175
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:49,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if it is?</font>

176
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:04,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

177
00:29:14,495 --> 00:29:17,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lost...</font>

178
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:18,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">anywhere.</font>

179
00:29:18,699 --> 00:29:21,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's killed—
I know— I'm so tired!</font>

180
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:29,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter what I do,
he finds me.</font>

181
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:30,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Police didn't believe us.</font>

182
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:31,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one did.</font>

183
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:32,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what
to do anymore.</font>

184
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:35,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've tried everything,
but it can't be stopped.</font>

185
00:29:35,216 --> 00:29:38,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that this sounds crazy,
but if you think you're being</font>

186
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">stalked by a mannequin,
don't—</font>

187
00:29:44,192 --> 00:29:46,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't, don't what?</font>

188
00:29:46,261 --> 00:29:46,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">No idea.</font>

189
00:29:47,095 --> 00:29:48,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">The video just ends there.</font>

190
00:29:51,765 --> 00:29:53,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

191
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:56,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a joke, right Jonah?</font>

192
00:29:58,239 --> 00:29:59,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jonah?</font>

193
00:30:00,808 --> 00:30:03,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, guys, it's just
some crappy viral video.</font>

194
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably a marketing gimmick
for a new horror movie.</font>

195
00:30:06,047 --> 00:30:07,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">They do it all the time.</font>

196
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:08,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, like what they
did for <i>Blair Witch Project</i> ,</font>

197
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:09,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">or <i>Selfie From Hell</i> .</font>

198
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, what she
said in that video was exactly</font>

199
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:13,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">like what's happening to us.</font>

200
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:15,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie, we love you, but—</font>

201
00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:17,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does it kill?</font>

202
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">This Mannequin?</font>

203
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does it kill?</font>

204
00:30:21,262 --> 00:30:24,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can do things.</font>

205
00:30:24,464 --> 00:30:26,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">It moves without moving.</font>

206
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">One minute it's there,
the next—</font>

207
00:30:29,103 --> 00:30:31,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">It follows.</font>

208
00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:36,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">And even if you can't see it,
you feel it.</font>

209
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:40,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's everywhere.</font>

210
00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:44,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">And nowhere at the same time.</font>

211
00:30:44,484 --> 00:30:47,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watching, waiting, until...</font>

212
00:31:01,635 --> 00:31:03,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, cut it out.</font>

213
00:31:03,204 --> 00:31:04,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too far, seriously.</font>

214
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Way too far.</font>

215
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:07,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, I got to hand it
to you two.</font>

216
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:09,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is really good.</font>

217
00:31:09,443 --> 00:31:12,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is sick,
like seriously poor taste.</font>

218
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:13,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Molly died yesterday.</font>

219
00:31:13,814 --> 00:31:15,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've had enough, I want to go.</font>

220
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:16,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please,
you have to believe us.</font>

221
00:31:22,456 --> 00:31:25,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">We tried to tell you.</font>

222
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was right there,
how could it just disappear?</font>

223
00:31:31,565 --> 00:31:33,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

224
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.</font>

225
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:49,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve, look, it's back.</font>

226
00:31:50,484 --> 00:31:56,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, Frankie,
we went over this.</font>

227
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:59,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it was right there.</font>

228
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:02,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I'm so sorry, everyone,</font>

229
00:32:02,729 --> 00:32:05,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.</font>

230
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie and I need to talk.</font>

231
00:32:16,277 --> 00:32:17,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve, she's not—</font>

232
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:20,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really disappointed
in you, Jonah.</font>

233
00:32:20,747 --> 00:32:22,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you
had better sense.</font>

234
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:39,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's mass hysteria.</font>

235
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie saw it at the window,
puts the idea in our minds,</font>

236
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then our imagination
takes over.</font>

237
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:47,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet the mannequin looked
different to all of us.</font>

238
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:50,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arms at its side,
sunken eyes, creepy smile?</font>

239
00:32:50,644 --> 00:32:51,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the same one I saw.</font>

240
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:53,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me too.</font>

241
00:32:58,219 --> 00:33:00,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drake?</font>

242
00:33:00,388 --> 00:33:02,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, looked the same to me.</font>

243
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:14,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if there was someone else
inside the house</font>

244
00:33:14,935 --> 00:33:16,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they planted
a second mannequin</font>

245
00:33:17,071 --> 00:33:18,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">when we weren't looking?</font>

246
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:19,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, and then somehow
managed to make it</font>

247
00:33:19,573 --> 00:33:21,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">disappear in the blink
of an eye?</font>

248
00:33:21,242 --> 00:33:22,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if it's not a mannequin?</font>

249
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if it's a person
in a mannequin costume?</font>

250
00:33:24,945 --> 00:33:26,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">They waited until we weren't
looking, and ran off,</font>

251
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:28,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">snuck in through the back.</font>

252
00:33:28,582 --> 00:33:29,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that makes a lot of sense.</font>

253
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:32,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes a lot more sense than some
supernatural mannequin.</font>

254
00:33:32,686 --> 00:33:34,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lewis, you saw it
with your own eyes.</font>

255
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:35,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jonah, come on, man.</font>

256
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:37,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a scientist.</font>

257
00:33:37,191 --> 00:33:40,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe in logic and...</font>

258
00:33:41,962 --> 00:33:43,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, can we just talk
about this later?</font>

259
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta move.</font>

260
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear my head a little.</font>

261
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:58,645
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>My grandmother and</i>
<i>I could hold conversations</i></font>

262
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:03,650
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>entirely without ever</i>
<i>opening our mouths.</i></font>

263
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,886
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She called it 'shining'.</i></font>

264
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:55,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">blood, blood,
blood, there was blood—</font>

265
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve?</font>

266
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:24,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you talking to?</font>

267
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is everything alright?</font>

268
00:37:54,115 --> 00:37:59,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">I uh— I had the most
terrible nightmare.</font>

269
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:08,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was the most...
horrible dream I ever had.</font>

270
00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:15,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dreamed that...</font>

271
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:18,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">You became so obsessed
with the mannequin that...</font>

272
00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:23,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you left me.</font>

273
00:38:23,877 --> 00:38:29,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I got so jealous
that I, uh...</font>

274
00:38:29,717 --> 00:38:34,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">I strangled you until you
were dead, and butchered you.</font>

275
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:40,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cut you up into little
pieces, and I, my work,</font>

276
00:38:40,328 --> 00:38:42,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's starting
to drive me out of my mind.</font>

277
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:52,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve.</font>

278
00:38:52,906 --> 00:38:54,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you happy?</font>

279
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:01,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will be, when
all this is behind us.</font>

280
00:39:01,915 --> 00:39:03,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if it never is?</font>

281
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:06,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if it follows
me wherever we go?</font>

282
00:39:17,765 --> 00:39:19,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did Jonah put that idea
in your head?</font>

283
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:22,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

284
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:26,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not lying to me,
are you, Frankie?</font>

285
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Steve.</font>

286
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:33,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

287
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:38,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I love you.</font>

288
00:39:42,857 --> 00:39:45,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you so much.</font>

289
00:39:48,028 --> 00:39:55,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you more than anything
in the whole wide world.</font>

290
00:39:55,736 --> 00:39:58,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'd never let
anything hurt you.</font>

291
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:01,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that, right?</font>

292
00:40:04,378 --> 00:40:05,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

293
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

294
00:40:37,378 --> 00:40:39,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay, baby.</font>

295
00:40:39,547 --> 00:40:43,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm scared too.</font>

296
00:40:43,284 --> 00:40:44,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it.</font>

297
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:46,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just in case.</font>

298
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?</font>

299
00:40:55,596 --> 00:40:57,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you.</font>

300
00:40:57,231 --> 00:40:58,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me know if
you need anything.</font>

301
00:40:58,732 --> 00:40:59,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

302
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is this?</font>

303
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:46,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me and do exactly
as I say.</font>

304
00:42:44,138 --> 00:42:45,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone responded to my post.</font>

305
00:42:45,472 --> 00:42:46,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Post?</font>

306
00:42:46,407 --> 00:42:47,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

307
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:50,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">That girl's video,
I commented asking if anyone</font>

308
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:51,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">could help,
and someone responded.</font>

309
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:53,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy, Victor Malick,
he said he was having the</font>

310
00:42:53,314 --> 00:42:54,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">mannequin shipped to himself.</font>

311
00:42:54,815 --> 00:42:56,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can it be stopped?</font>

312
00:42:56,183 --> 00:42:58,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Malick's on the next flight out.</font>

313
00:42:58,218 --> 00:42:59,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can explain
everything then.</font>

314
00:42:59,553 --> 00:43:01,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now we need to get
everyone back to your place</font>

315
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:02,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">or more people are gonna die.</font>

316
00:43:18,238 --> 00:43:18,973
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hello?</i></font>

317
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:20,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank God you're alright.</font>

318
00:43:20,174 --> 00:43:20,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, I'm getting
another call from Lucy,</font>

319
00:43:20,975 --> 00:43:22,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">can you hold on a sec?</font>

320
00:43:22,176 --> 00:43:23,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you need to patch
her through right now.</font>

321
00:43:23,344 --> 00:43:24,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">This concerns all of us.</font>

322
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:32,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you two right now?</font>

323
00:43:32,953 --> 00:43:33,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Government and Yates.</font>

324
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:34,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in Trounce Alley.</font>

325
00:43:35,056 --> 00:43:36,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we're close.</font>

326
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:38,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's meet at Washington Plaza.</font>

327
00:43:40,928 --> 00:43:41,695
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Drake.</i></font>

328
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:43,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, you gotta grab
Madison and get to</font>

329
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie's house right away.</font>

330
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:45,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you going on about,
Jonah?</font>

331
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:47,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our lives are in danger!</font>

332
00:43:47,201 --> 00:43:48,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, enough with this mannequin!</font>

333
00:43:48,268 --> 00:43:50,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're freaking everyone out.</font>

334
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:59,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me, Drake, or this
thing'll get you and Madison.</font>

335
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:01,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Jonah,
mind your own business.</font>

336
00:44:01,215 --> 00:44:03,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Madison and I are
gonna be just fine.</font>

337
00:44:49,263 --> 00:44:51,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just what I needed.</font>

338
00:44:55,003 --> 00:44:56,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do love her.</font>

339
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">My girlfriend.</font>

340
00:44:58,472 --> 00:45:01,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd do anything to
make that woman happy.</font>

341
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:04,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">I try to make her happy.</font>

342
00:45:04,311 --> 00:45:07,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">But lately...</font>

343
00:45:07,915 --> 00:45:12,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not so sure.</font>

344
00:45:12,286 --> 00:45:17,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Recent events have
complicated things.</font>

345
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isabelle?</font>

346
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:27,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

347
00:46:27,394 --> 00:46:31,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really needed this.</font>

348
00:46:31,365 --> 00:46:33,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, it's time for me
to get back</font>

349
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:35,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the old ball and chain.</font>

350
00:46:35,435 --> 00:46:37,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll be wondering
where I am.</font>

351
00:46:37,371 --> 00:46:40,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or uh...</font>

352
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:41,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe she won't be.</font>

353
00:46:42,043 --> 00:46:43,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

354
00:46:44,378 --> 00:46:45,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, can I have another one?</font>

355
00:46:46,947 --> 00:46:47,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

356
00:46:50,751 --> 00:46:52,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Madison's not answering.</font>

357
00:46:52,253 --> 00:46:53,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same with Drake and Lewis.</font>

358
00:46:53,654 --> 00:46:54,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">When's Malick getting here?</font>

359
00:46:54,888 --> 00:46:55,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

360
00:46:55,923 --> 00:46:57,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said to just stay put
and make sure none of us—</font>

361
00:46:58,725 --> 00:47:00,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">You!</font>

362
00:47:00,928 --> 00:47:01,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jonah, don't!</font>

363
00:47:01,995 --> 00:47:02,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back off, man!</font>

364
00:47:02,796 --> 00:47:04,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not fair,
we didn't do anything!</font>

365
00:47:04,265 --> 00:47:05,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was her,</font>

366
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:06,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie's the one who brought
things thing into our lives!</font>

367
00:47:07,068 --> 00:47:10,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened, where's Madison?</font>

368
00:47:13,308 --> 00:47:16,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry, Drake.</font>

369
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:17,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me everything you know.</font>

370
00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:18,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this thing?</font>

371
00:47:18,146 --> 00:47:19,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is it after us?</font>

372
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:20,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause we've all seen it.</font>

373
00:47:20,315 --> 00:47:21,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why isn't Frankie dead yet?</font>

374
00:47:21,415 --> 00:47:22,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Drake!
- Seriously, she saw it first!</font>

375
00:47:22,749 --> 00:47:23,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't mean anything!</font>

376
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:25,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucy, he's right.</font>

377
00:47:25,919 --> 00:47:30,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">It had plenty of chances
to kill me but it didn't.</font>

378
00:47:31,092 --> 00:47:33,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else did Malick tell you?</font>

379
00:47:36,197 --> 00:47:37,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we're screwed, right?</font>

380
00:47:40,268 --> 00:47:42,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, I'm not waiting around
for some freak you met online</font>

381
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:44,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">to show and do what exactly?</font>

382
00:47:44,972 --> 00:47:46,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perform an exorcism?</font>

383
00:47:46,773 --> 00:47:47,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pft.</font>

384
00:47:49,143 --> 00:47:50,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, man.</font>

385
00:47:50,477 --> 00:47:52,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drake, you can't leave.</font>

386
00:47:52,146 --> 00:47:53,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look bro, if I'm gonna die,</font>

387
00:47:53,314 --> 00:47:56,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna die
on my own terms, you dig?</font>

388
00:47:57,352 --> 00:47:58,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't touch me!</font>

389
00:47:58,619 --> 00:47:59,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you go out there,
you bring it with you wherever</font>

390
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">you go, and whoever sees
it it'll follow them too.</font>

391
00:48:02,456 --> 00:48:04,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why Malick told me
to get everyone together.</font>

392
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:07,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to stay here or we'll
be exposing more people to it</font>

393
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:09,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this'll never stop.</font>

394
00:48:09,496 --> 00:48:11,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that's why
it hasn't killed me.</font>

395
00:48:11,798 --> 00:48:15,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl in that video,
she was trying to warn others.</font>

396
00:48:16,004 --> 00:48:21,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">She knew the mannequin needed
people to see it, and I...</font>

397
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:26,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

398
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:28,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did exactly what it wanted.</font>

399
00:48:28,316 --> 00:48:30,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not your fault,
you didn't know.</font>

400
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:33,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's right, Frankie, you can't
put all this on yourself.</font>

401
00:48:41,495 --> 00:48:43,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey guys.</font>

402
00:48:43,197 --> 00:48:44,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up?</font>

403
00:48:44,232 --> 00:48:45,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">People are dying, Steve.</font>

404
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:51,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">It got Madison, and Isabelle,
and we think Lewis, too.</font>

405
00:48:51,272 --> 00:48:52,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's coming for us.</font>

406
00:48:58,512 --> 00:49:00,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you don't believe us
but if you'd seen</font>

407
00:49:00,114 --> 00:49:00,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">what we've seen—</font>

408
00:49:00,948 --> 00:49:01,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jonah!</font>

409
00:49:01,815 --> 00:49:03,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so good to see you, buddy.</font>

410
00:49:03,217 --> 00:49:05,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen a lot more of you
these days since Frankie</font>

411
00:49:05,585 --> 00:49:07,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">started spending all
of her time with you!</font>

412
00:49:07,188 --> 00:49:09,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really happy.</font>

413
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:10,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I didn't want
to believe this either,</font>

414
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:12,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's real, bro.</font>

415
00:49:12,293 --> 00:49:15,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's real, bro?</font>

416
00:49:15,529 --> 00:49:17,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, bro.</font>

417
00:49:17,432 --> 00:49:20,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's so crazy, bro.</font>

418
00:49:24,272 --> 00:49:26,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, whatever you think is
happening between me and Jonah,</font>

419
00:49:26,974 --> 00:49:28,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's not.</font>

420
00:49:28,209 --> 00:49:30,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing that's going
on right now is that that—</font>

421
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:33,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">thing is out there somewhere
and it's coming for us.</font>

422
00:49:34,315 --> 00:49:35,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't.</font>

423
00:49:37,452 --> 00:49:39,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not like you, Steve.</font>

424
00:49:39,387 --> 00:49:46,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what is... like me,
Frankie? Hmm?</font>

425
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:50,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's what I thought.</font>

426
00:49:51,432 --> 00:49:55,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

427
00:49:55,203 --> 00:49:56,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like your mother.</font>

428
00:49:57,637 --> 00:49:59,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys?</font>

429
00:50:08,882 --> 00:50:09,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve, no!</font>

430
00:50:14,521 --> 00:50:15,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't go near it!</font>

431
00:50:15,356 --> 00:50:15,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to her, man!</font>

432
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:16,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve, please!</font>

433
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:34,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you.</font>

434
00:50:34,475 --> 00:50:36,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing
to worry about.</font>

435
00:50:36,277 --> 00:50:37,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing to worry about—
argh!</font>

436
00:50:39,514 --> 00:50:40,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve!</font>

437
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Idiot.</font>

438
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:50,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a fuckin' mannequin.</font>

439
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:58,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check this out.</font>

440
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and?</font>

441
00:51:01,069 --> 00:51:02,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about it.</font>

442
00:51:02,736 --> 00:51:04,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time we look away
it seems to disappear,</font>

443
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:07,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">but for some reason
it's still there.</font>

444
00:51:07,908 --> 00:51:11,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not everyone looked away.</font>

445
00:51:13,147 --> 00:51:14,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's get this
somewhere safe before</font>

446
00:51:14,415 --> 00:51:15,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">anyone else sees it.</font>

447
00:51:15,749 --> 00:51:19,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no way
I'm touching that.</font>

448
00:51:19,554 --> 00:51:20,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do it.</font>

449
00:51:28,262 --> 00:51:29,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think the mannequin's
only able to move</font>

450
00:51:29,763 --> 00:51:30,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">when we're not looking at it.</font>

451
00:51:30,897 --> 00:51:32,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">So as long as you
don't take your eyes off it</font>

452
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:33,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">it won't be able to kill anyone?</font>

453
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:35,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't watch it forever.</font>

454
00:51:35,669 --> 00:51:37,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna need
to sleep eventually.</font>

455
00:51:41,342 --> 00:51:43,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">We watch in shifts.</font>

456
00:52:21,249 --> 00:52:22,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve?</font>

457
00:52:24,985 --> 00:52:27,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... wanted to check in
and see—</font>

458
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:30,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why I'm such a jerk?</font>

459
00:52:45,805 --> 00:52:48,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we're both under a lot
of stress with</font>

460
00:52:48,209 --> 00:52:51,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">everything that's
going on right now.</font>

461
00:52:51,245 --> 00:52:57,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, your thesis,
the accident, the deaths.</font>

462
00:52:57,751 --> 00:52:59,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mannequin.</font>

463
00:53:00,754 --> 00:53:04,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you believe me?</font>

464
00:53:07,628 --> 00:53:10,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, why don't I come back later
with some coffee, and maybe—</font>

465
00:53:10,964 --> 00:53:12,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to finish my work.</font>

466
00:53:16,237 --> 00:53:18,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

467
00:53:50,137 --> 00:53:51,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is probably the first time
we've stayed up late</font>

468
00:53:51,672 --> 00:53:54,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">like this since senior year.</font>

469
00:53:54,475 --> 00:53:58,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, we grew up.</font>

470
00:53:58,279 --> 00:54:00,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">And real life began.</font>

471
00:54:00,914 --> 00:54:05,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you started seeing
Steve, and...</font>

472
00:54:05,453 --> 00:54:06,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">would have been weird anyway.</font>

473
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would have been weird?</font>

474
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:12,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, us three going
to the movies together.</font>

475
00:54:12,193 --> 00:54:16,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve sitting right there
while I'm just finger blasting</font>

476
00:54:16,697 --> 00:54:18,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">you through your jeans.</font>

477
00:54:18,466 --> 00:54:19,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jonah!</font>

478
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:24,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I remember why we stopped
hanging out so much.</font>

479
00:55:44,918 --> 00:55:47,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, remember sophomore year
when we had that history sub</font>

480
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">for like, three months?</font>

481
00:55:48,823 --> 00:55:49,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ms Corbis?</font>

482
00:55:49,923 --> 00:55:52,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

483
00:55:52,226 --> 00:55:53,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember her face
when you asked her when</font>

484
00:55:53,828 --> 00:55:55,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">she was expecting?</font>

485
00:55:55,162 --> 00:55:57,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we all thought
she was pregnant,</font>

486
00:55:57,997 --> 00:55:59,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">you more so than anyone.</font>

487
00:55:59,767 --> 00:56:01,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well she
really did look pregnant.</font>

488
00:56:01,335 --> 00:56:02,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and it was driving
you crazy,</font>

489
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:06,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you know, I had to ask.</font>

490
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">No harm in asking, right?</font>

491
00:56:08,942 --> 00:56:15,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, why didn't
you ever ask me to—</font>

492
00:56:15,783 --> 00:56:22,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">The coffee should be
ready by now.</font>

493
00:57:30,825 --> 00:57:32,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful, Frankie.</font>

494
00:57:48,042 --> 00:57:49,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve, no!</font>

495
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:54,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's over, Frankie,
it's all over.</font>

496
00:57:54,148 --> 00:57:55,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know what you've done.</font>

497
00:57:55,783 --> 00:57:57,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't know what I've done?</font>

498
00:57:57,351 --> 00:57:59,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a PhD candidate, Jonah.</font>

499
00:57:59,286 --> 00:58:02,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know things you couldn't
even begin to comprehend.</font>

500
00:58:02,289 --> 00:58:04,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw your thesis, Steve.</font>

501
00:58:04,492 --> 00:58:05,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need help.</font>

502
00:58:05,493 --> 00:58:10,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what about you, Frankie?
Hmm?</font>

503
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:13,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you?</font>

504
00:58:14,068 --> 00:58:16,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has it ever occurred
to you that I'm in a highly</font>

505
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:18,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">competitive academic program?</font>

506
00:58:18,873 --> 00:58:21,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it even matter to you
that my advisor and colleagues</font>

507
00:58:22,076 --> 00:58:23,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">rely on me?</font>

508
00:58:23,577 --> 00:58:26,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have the slightest
ideal what a moral and ethical</font>

509
00:58:26,447 --> 00:58:27,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">principal is?</font>

510
00:58:27,515 --> 00:58:29,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you?</font>

511
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:33,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know
who you are anymore.</font>

512
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never did.</font>

513
00:58:39,793 --> 00:58:40,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happening?</font>

514
00:58:40,895 --> 00:58:42,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you do,
don't look away.</font>

515
00:58:42,863 --> 00:58:44,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to Jonah, Frankie, go on.</font>

516
00:58:44,465 --> 00:58:45,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're so good at
listening to him.</font>

517
00:59:14,728 --> 00:59:19,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I tell you?</font>

518
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a mannequin.</font>

519
00:59:21,036 --> 00:59:23,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, was...</font>

520
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:25,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">just a mannequin.</font>

521
00:59:27,174 --> 00:59:29,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should get back
to my thesis.</font>

522
00:59:37,685 --> 00:59:43,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Frankie, thanks
for the inspiration.</font>

523
00:59:49,863 --> 00:59:51,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always knew that guy was nuts.</font>

524
01:00:42,249 --> 01:00:43,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does anyone see it?</font>

525
01:00:43,283 --> 01:00:46,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but it's here,
I can feel it.</font>

526
01:00:46,186 --> 01:00:47,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to call the police.</font>

527
01:00:47,621 --> 01:00:48,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">And bring more people
to the house,</font>

528
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:50,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">more people who might
see the mannequin?</font>

529
01:00:50,724 --> 01:00:51,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't take that risk.</font>

530
01:00:51,925 --> 01:00:53,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where the hell is it?</font>

531
01:00:53,128 --> 01:00:54,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hiding.</font>

532
01:00:54,728 --> 01:00:55,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know its weakness.</font>

533
01:00:55,229 --> 01:00:56,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weakness?</font>

534
01:00:56,163 --> 01:00:57,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">That thing's unstoppable.</font>

535
01:00:57,598 --> 01:00:59,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we do know how to stop it
and it knows that.</font>

536
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:01,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to find
it, and remember,</font>

537
01:01:01,869 --> 01:01:05,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">as soon as you set your eyes
on it, do not look away.</font>

538
01:01:05,372 --> 01:01:06,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if it doesn't show?</font>

539
01:01:06,707 --> 01:01:08,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">It disappears and
reappears anytime it wants.</font>

540
01:01:08,475 --> 01:01:09,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've stayed alive this long.</font>

541
01:01:09,977 --> 01:01:11,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it let us.</font>

542
01:01:11,412 --> 01:01:13,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like Frankie said before, it
needed more people to see but</font>

543
01:01:13,148 --> 01:01:14,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">now that we know its secret—</font>

544
01:01:14,548 --> 01:01:16,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't need us anymore.</font>

545
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:17,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's split up.</font>

546
01:01:17,484 --> 01:01:18,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't Scooby-Doo, Jonah!</font>

547
01:01:23,323 --> 01:01:25,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Use your phones.</font>

548
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">There, I saw it!</font>

549
01:01:27,828 --> 01:01:28,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?</font>

550
01:01:28,629 --> 01:01:30,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could be anywhere!</font>

551
01:01:34,169 --> 01:01:35,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">My phone's about to die!</font>

552
01:01:35,136 --> 01:01:36,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do this much longer.</font>

553
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:37,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie,
where's the fuse box?</font>

554
01:01:37,805 --> 01:01:38,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">The basement!</font>

555
01:01:38,505 --> 01:01:40,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jonah,
I'm coming with you.</font>

556
01:01:56,657 --> 01:01:58,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down here, come on.</font>

557
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:10,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, man, we gotta go.</font>

558
01:02:24,018 --> 01:02:25,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Drake,
give me a hand here.</font>

559
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:28,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold this.</font>

560
01:02:28,322 --> 01:02:29,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting dizzy.</font>

561
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:31,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, come
up against the wall.</font>

562
01:02:39,234 --> 01:02:40,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, man, hurry it up.</font>

563
01:02:43,204 --> 01:02:44,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Higher!</font>

564
01:02:52,613 --> 01:02:53,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn, Jonah,
that was close.</font>

565
01:02:53,547 --> 01:02:57,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">What took you so long?</font>

566
01:03:03,357 --> 01:03:06,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank
God you're okay.</font>

567
01:03:06,261 --> 01:03:07,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Drake?</font>

568
01:03:07,262 --> 01:03:08,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just gearing up.</font>

569
01:03:08,595 --> 01:03:08,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drake!</font>

570
01:03:56,211 --> 01:03:57,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

571
01:03:58,313 --> 01:03:59,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

572
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:13,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Mr Malick—</font>

573
01:04:13,127 --> 01:04:14,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Victor.</font>

574
01:04:14,428 --> 01:04:15,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call me Victor.</font>

575
01:04:16,064 --> 01:04:17,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, Victor.</font>

576
01:04:17,232 --> 01:04:19,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did this thing come from?</font>

577
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:21,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mannequin?</font>

578
01:04:21,435 --> 01:04:23,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only the Devil himself knows.</font>

579
01:04:23,137 --> 01:04:27,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it can be stopped, right?</font>

580
01:04:27,474 --> 01:04:29,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did it before.</font>

581
01:04:29,443 --> 01:04:31,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do it again.</font>

582
01:04:31,645 --> 01:04:37,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">That thing, what you call
a mannequin has tormented me</font>

583
01:04:37,484 --> 01:04:41,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">for 30 years.</font>

584
01:04:41,889 --> 01:04:45,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">My daughter was the first
to see it.</font>

585
01:04:45,926 --> 01:04:47,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then my wife.</font>

586
01:04:47,728 --> 01:04:50,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon others from our circle
began to see it too.</font>

587
01:04:50,131 --> 01:04:53,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the same fate befell
them and their friends,</font>

588
01:04:53,734 --> 01:04:55,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">and every other poor soul
who happened to set their eyes</font>

589
01:04:55,969 --> 01:04:58,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">upon it.</font>

590
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:00,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fortunately I couldn't.</font>

591
01:05:00,474 --> 01:05:02,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there was no
mistaking its presence.</font>

592
01:05:02,609 --> 01:05:05,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Darkness unlike
anything I'd ever felt.</font>

593
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:14,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tracked it as far as Moscow.</font>

594
01:05:14,355 --> 01:05:16,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it kept evading me.</font>

595
01:05:16,224 --> 01:05:17,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until a week ago.</font>

596
01:05:17,925 --> 01:05:20,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found it not
too far from here.</font>

597
01:05:20,761 --> 01:05:23,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was having it shipped to
my estate where I can bury it</font>

598
01:05:23,231 --> 01:05:26,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">away forever, spare others
from suffering the same tragic</font>

599
01:05:26,566 --> 01:05:28,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">demise as my loved ones.</font>

600
01:05:28,902 --> 01:05:31,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swore on their graves I
would put an end to this and</font>

601
01:05:31,872 --> 01:05:34,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">by God I will!</font>

602
01:05:34,108 --> 01:05:36,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to.</font>

603
01:05:44,518 --> 01:05:46,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good coffee.</font>

604
01:05:46,787 --> 01:05:48,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd kill for some more.</font>

605
01:06:01,768 --> 01:06:05,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Victor, when do we start?</font>

606
01:06:05,373 --> 01:06:06,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">When it returns.</font>

607
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:08,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if it doesn't?</font>

608
01:06:09,043 --> 01:06:12,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the only ones
who've seen it?</font>

609
01:06:12,546 --> 01:06:16,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only ones still alive, yes.</font>

610
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:18,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then it'll only be a matter
of time.</font>

611
01:06:18,885 --> 01:06:22,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can't resist its urge
to kill.</font>

612
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:24,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need something to drink.</font>

613
01:06:24,624 --> 01:06:26,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucy, want anything?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

629
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:31,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happening in there?</font>

630
01:08:38,025 --> 01:08:40,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jonah? Lucy? What's going on?</font>

631
01:08:45,133 --> 01:08:45,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jonah?</font>

634
01:08:54,609 --> 01:08:56,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have your eyes on it?</font>

635
01:08:56,444 --> 01:08:58,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

636

exactly?</font>

639
01:09:06,786 --> 01:09:10,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ending this,
once and for all.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could.</font>

643
01:09:18,633 --> 01:09:21,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately,</font>

644
01:09:21,102 --> 01:09:22,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">the moment you and your friends
laid eyes on it,</font>

645
01:09:22,869 --> 01:09:23,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were cursed.</font>

646
01:09:23,904 --> 01:09:25,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was no saving you.</font>

647
01:09:25,739 --> 01:09:27,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you can help me
save others.</font>

648
01:09:28,009 --> 01:09:31,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the last one who's
seen it, and once you're dead,</font>

01:09:31,145 --> 01:09:34,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">its powers will be lost,
unless someone else sees it.</font>

650
01:09:34,981 --> 01:09:37,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm not gonna
let that happen.</font>

651
01:09:37,652 --> 01:09:39,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not again.</font>

652
01:09:39,953 --> 01:09:41,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you do this?</font>

653
01:09:41,422 --> 01:09:42,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone has to.</font>

654
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:45,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Argh!</font>

to a hospital.</font>

662
01:12:21,782 --> 01:12:23,917

663
01:12:46,307 --> 01:12:48,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Jonah,
it could be anywhere!</font>

664
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:53,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jonah?</font>

665
01:12:55,316 --> 01:12:57,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no,
Jonah, hey, hey, hey.</font>

666
01:12:57,651 --> 01:12:58,786

01:16:50,184 --> 01:16:51,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your LSAT?</font>

you moving to Stanford—</font>

this is your dream.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is it?</font>

692
01:18:01,022 --> 01:18:01,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful with that.</font>

693
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:03,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody paid the big bucks

<font color="#FFFFFF">Great, that's the third one
this month.</font>

697
01:18:12,566 --> 01:18:15,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, at least it's insured.</font>
