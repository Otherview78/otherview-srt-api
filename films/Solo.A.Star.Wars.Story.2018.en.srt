1
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:56,692
Come on.

2
00:00:57,523 --> 00:00:58,123
Come on!

3
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:10,511
Don't let him get away!

4
00:01:57,456 --> 00:01:58,790
Get inside now!

5
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,700
Hurry up! You're late!

6
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:05,607
Proxima's gonna have your hide.

7
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:08,450
Get back in the den.

8
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:11,932
Look what I stole!

9
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,983
Proxima'll give me
an extra portion for this!

10
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:15,955
Nope, I think she's gonna
give that extra portion to me.

11
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:16,809
Hey, give it back!

12
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:17,999
It belongs to whoever's holding it!

13
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:18,909
And that's not you!

14
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:19,545
Lex!

15
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:21,531
Full Sabacc!

16
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:22,876
Idiot's Array.

17
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:23,941
What? Let me see that!

18
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:25,045
Nope, it's my card.

19
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:25,997
You cheat.

20
00:02:26,997 --> 00:02:27,797
Han!

21
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:33,510
You were gone too long!

22
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:35,019
I knew something must've gone wrong.

23
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:36,626
This is nothing.
You should see them.

24
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,701
Look down here!

25
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:40,137
All right, listen.

26
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:41,522
I was in the middle of the exchange,

27
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:42,668
I'm handing over the coaxium

28
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,512
and his goons jumped me,
but I showed them.

29
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:45,148
How?

30
00:02:45,188 --> 00:02:47,324
I ran away, then I boosted their speeder.

31
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:48,400
What, are we going somewhere?

32
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:50,193
Yeah, anywhere we want.

33
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:53,600
You held on to one of the vials?

34
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:54,882
Han's back!

35
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,707
This, this is worth...

36
00:02:58,747 --> 00:02:59,937
Five, six hundred credits.

37
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:01,702
That's more than you said we'd need.

38
00:03:01,963 --> 00:03:04,142
To buy our way out of the control zone.

39
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,574
And off Corellia.

40
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:06,648
Han, this...

41
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:08,782
this could work.

42
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:09,847
This is gonna work.

43
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:12,278
Qi'ra, you always said one day
we're gonna get out of here.

44
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,714
This is it.

45
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:16,235
What are we waiting for?

46
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,691
There he is.

47
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:23,882
Hey, you two!

48
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:29,014
Moloch, hi. How are ya?

49
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:31,102
I was, just on my way
to see Lady Proxima...

50
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,460
What a night I had.

51
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,213
You're not gonna believe it.
You'll believe it, but...

52
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:41,354
Hold still, scrumrat!

53
00:03:43,344 --> 00:03:44,358
Easy.

54
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:46,519
Come on.

55
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,559
All right.

56
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:50,002
Let's go see Lady Proxima.

57
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:11,804
Well,

58
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:13,397
what happened?

59
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:14,834
I'll tell you what happened.

60
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:17,044
They double-crossed you
and tried to kill me.

61
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:17,882
The money?

62
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:20,494
They kept it.
And my coaxium?

63
00:04:21,158 --> 00:04:23,786
They kept that, too.
But we learned a very valuable lesson.

64
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:26,027
We cannot trust those guys.

65
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,293
So you expect me to believe

66
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,929
that you walked away with nothing!

67
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:35,219
I ran away with my life.
I think that's something.

68
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:37,118
To me, that's a lot.

69
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:39,725
I trusted you with a simple task,

70
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:42,401
and all I'm hearing are excuses.

71
00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:48,831
There must be consequences
for disobedience

72
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,696
or else you never learn.

73
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,881
You know what?

74
00:05:00,622 --> 00:05:02,213
I don't think I'm ever gonna learn.

75
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:03,888
What did you say?

76
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,911
I said, next time somebody hits me,

77
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:10,162
I hit them back.

78
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:14,755
Moloch, wait!

79
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,121
Don't!

80
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:18,741
Qi'ra, remember the Silo?

81
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:21,758
We pulled you out of that horror,
gave you a home.

82
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:24,342
Don't throw it away for Han.

83
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:25,774
He's not worth it!

84
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:29,167
Whatever he lost on the deal,
we'll earn it back, double.

85
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:30,694
We will make it up to you.

86
00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:37,045
Everybody stand back!

87
00:05:37,285 --> 00:05:39,028
What's that supposed to be?

88
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:40,712
This is a thermal detonator.

89
00:05:41,652 --> 00:05:43,047
That I just armed.

90
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:44,524
That's a rock!

91
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:45,873
No, it's not.

92
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:46,812
Yes, it is!

93
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:49,477
And you just made
a clicking sound with your mouth.

94
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,241
Please tell me this isn't your plan.

95
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:52,520
No, this is.

96
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,184
Get in!
An M-68?

97
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:05,926
Nice, right?
I love it!

98
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:42,045
There's a starliner leaving
from Coronet Spaceport,

99
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:43,085
we're gonna be on it.

100
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:46,901
We bribe our way through
the checkpoint and we're free.

101
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,850
I'm gonna be a pilot.

102
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:51,518
We can get our own ship.

103
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:53,436
See the galaxy, all of it.

104
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:58,154
We won't have to take orders
or be kicked around by anyone.

105
00:06:58,674 --> 00:06:59,675
Ever.

106
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:05,225
Thought we'd get a little
more of a head start.

107
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:23,552
Hang on!

108
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,704
<i>This is a secure area.</i>

109
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:36,830
<i>You must have proper clearance.</i>

110
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,312
<i>Stop at once!
You must follow the proper...</i>

111
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,583
<i>Protocol.</i>

112
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:46,240
Damn! That stinger's fast.

113
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,510
Yeah, yeah but we're faster, right?

114
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,390
I hope so.

115
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,883
<i>Pull over!</i>

116
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:45,373
Han, no, we're not gonna make it!

117
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:46,130
Oh yeah?

118
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,799
Han, I'm telling you, it's too tight!

119
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:49,304
Watch this.

120
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:14,249
Come on!

121
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:16,570
We gotta move.

122
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:29,612
<i>Do not join the line</i>

123
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,310
<i>if you don't have a boarding pass.</i>

124
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:35,511
<i>No access without ID chip.</i>

125
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,261
<i>All droids must be registered.</i>

126
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,381
<i>Move along. Move along.</i>

127
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:46,925
<i>Stand down. Do not resist!</i>

128
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,651
<i>Stop struggling.</i>
Let me go!

129
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,620
<i>Take his arm.</i>

130
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,388
<i>I got him.</i>

131
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:52,859
<i>Take him to cell 3B.</i>

132
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:54,920
<i>This way, come on.</i>

133
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:57,409
<i>Keep moving. Hold it, hold it.</i>

134
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:00,787
<i>Next.</i>

135
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,271
Han, they're here.

136
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,547
<i>Hey, what are you...</i>

137
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,014
We're almost there.

138
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,219
Just hold on to me.
<i>Next.</i>

139
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:16,693
Don't look back.

140
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:20,043
Once we're through,
we've gotta be smart,

141
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,553
figure out where we're going.

142
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:23,219
Anywhere the Empire isn't.

143
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,327
Wherever we go, it can't be
worse than where we've been.

144
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:27,915
Yes, it can. Out there,
we've got no protection.

145
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:30,985
We could get snatched up
by traffickers,

146
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,554
sold to Crimson Dawn
or the Hutt Cartel.

147
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:35,412
That's not gonna happen.

148
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:36,863
I won't let it.

149
00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:45,673
For luck?

150
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:47,806
Damn right.

151
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:53,128
<i>You heard him. Let's go.</i>

152
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,252
<i>Next.</i>

153
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,184
<i>ID chips.</i>

154
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,320
Funny thing, we don't have them.

155
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:02,182
We have this.

156
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:03,705
Refined hyperfuel.

157
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:06,667
It's worth at least,
800 credits maybe more.

158
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:09,637
<i>You could be detained
just for having that.</i>

159
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:12,069
What good would that do anybody?

160
00:11:12,394 --> 00:11:14,240
Let us through, it's all yours.

161
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:25,851
The coaxium, now.

162
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,473
As we're going through, not before.

163
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:33,806
Do it.

164
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:37,183
Just do it, do it.

165
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,345
Not so fast, Qi'ra!
Come on!

166
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:45,406
Wait! Open the door!

167
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,477
Security!
<i>Security, there has been a breach!</i>

168
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:49,313
Open the door!

169
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:50,251
Run!

170
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:51,873
Run!
Get your hands off of her!

171
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,169
Run!

172
00:11:53,304 --> 00:11:54,955
Get your hands off of her!

173
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:56,788
Qi'ra!

174
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:59,059
Run, Han! Go!

175
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:00,693
Keep moving.

176
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:04,063
Qi'ra!

177
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:05,032
Run!

178
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,074
Traveler has been apprehended.

179
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:08,347
Qi'ra, I'll come back!

180
00:12:08,372 --> 00:12:09,800
I'll come back!

181
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,974
<i>All units, there has been a breach.</i>

182
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:16,816
<i>Another unauthorized traveler
made it through the gate.</i>

183
00:12:18,356 --> 00:12:19,830
<i>One got through the gate!
Look over there!</i>

184
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:21,385
<i>Someone got through the checkpoint.</i>

185
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:31,720
Keep an eye on that gate.
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

186
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:33,449
Can't let you through without a ticket.

187
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:35,008
Can't let you through without a ticket.

188
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:37,025
Hey, wait!

189
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,156
Hey!
<i>Come with us.</i>

190
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:43,287
<i>He's still out there.
Keep looking.</i>

191
00:12:55,783 --> 00:12:57,010
<i>You there, stop!</i>

192
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,510
<i>Show me some identification.</i>
Please. Please.

193
00:12:58,635 --> 00:12:59,687
No, no!

194
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:00,994
<i>Do not resist.</i>

195
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:04,416
<i>Be a part of something.
Join the Empire.</i>

196
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:06,214
<i>Explore new worlds.</i>

197
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:08,399
<i>Learn valuable skills.</i>

198
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,105
<i>Bring order and unity to the galaxy!</i>

199
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,522
<i>Be a part of something.</i>

200
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:16,203
<i>Join the Empire.</i>

201
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,406
This is where I sign up
to be a pilot, right?

202
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:20,990
If you apply for the Imperial Navy,

203
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,825
but most recruits go into the infantry.

204
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:24,123
I'm gonna be a pilot.

205
00:13:24,848 --> 00:13:25,981
Best in the galaxy.

206
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:27,684
You there, come with us.

207
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:28,887
Who, me?

208
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,773
We have a few questions to ask you.

209
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:32,162
How long is that gonna take?

210
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:34,741
Depends on how good you are
at following orders.

211
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,477
Why, have you got somewhere to be?

212
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:38,575
Yeah, back here, as soon as I can.

213
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,153
Don't hear that much.

214
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:43,153
What's your name, son?

215
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,212
Han.

216
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:45,963
Han what?

217
00:13:47,713 --> 00:13:48,926
Who are your people?

218
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,096
I don't have people.

219
00:13:54,421 --> 00:13:55,503
I'm alone.

220
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:57,682
Han...

221
00:14:00,696 --> 00:14:01,716
Solo.

222
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:04,771
Approved.

223
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:08,703
Proceed to transport ID 83 for
the Naval Academy at Carida.

224
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:10,622
Good luck, Han Solo.

225
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:12,842
We'll have you flying in no time.

226
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:28,323
Your Empire needs you.

227
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:29,953
Troopers forward!

228
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:32,028
Solo, get up!
We're almost there!

229
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,448
Almost where?

230
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,619
Where are we going?

231
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,347
Just over that last ridge.

232
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:37,525
Victory is...

233
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:48,779
My legs!

234
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,039
My leg!

235
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:09,811
Hey Beckett, you said we were here
to pull a quick job.

236
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:11,789
Yeah.
Well, this ain't a quick job!

237
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,036
It's a war!

238
00:15:14,104 --> 00:15:15,792
It's always something with you.

239
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:20,042
AT-hauler.
That's what we came for.

240
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:22,460
Forward operations must be this way.

241
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,429
They are, but the major said
we're supposed to go that way!

242
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:27,444
Yeah, go that way and die!

243
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:29,547
That's exactly what happened
to the major!

244
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:31,989
Who's the ranking officer now?

245
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,719
You are, Captain.

246
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:37,269
<i>He's got you there.</i>

247
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:41,743
So what's the plan, Captain Beckett?

248
00:15:42,022 --> 00:15:45,294
Val, you take Rio and these
four mud skulls flank left.

249
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:46,885
I'll take this mouthy scooch

250
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:48,169
and we'll go around to the right...

251
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:50,424
and maybe we'll get lucky.

252
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,089
<i>Luck's got nothin' to do with it.</i>

253
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:54,720
Wait! One, one question!
One question!

254
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:56,660
You wanna live, sparky?

255
00:15:56,685 --> 00:15:57,502
Very much.

256
00:15:57,526 --> 00:15:59,930
Then shut up and do what
your captain tells you.

257
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,619
Let's go!

258
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,260
Captain.

259
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,612
<i>T-15s are down.
We walk from here.</i>

260
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,672
Captain.

261
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:23,986
I'm Han.

262
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,645
Nobody cares.

263
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:30,189
Thanks for your help, back there.

264
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:31,587
You did all right.

265
00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:36,174
I, I was trained in aerial combat...
You want some advice?

266
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:37,442
Get the hell away from here.

267
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:40,018
Any way you can, as fast as you can.

268
00:16:43,406 --> 00:16:44,336
What company do you command?

269
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:46,112
None of your business company.

270
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:47,919
And we're full up.

271
00:16:48,995 --> 00:16:50,411
<i>Stick to soldiering, kid.</i>

272
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:51,893
<i>You don't want any part of this.</i>

273
00:16:58,498 --> 00:16:59,734
<i>Hang on, guys!</i>

274
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:03,002
Attention!

275
00:17:03,704 --> 00:17:06,405
In three hours, we move out
for the southern marshlands.

276
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:09,163
I want an advance party of ten men.

277
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:10,745
Great, more mud.

278
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:12,445
What was that?

279
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,895
Just wondering what our
objective is, Lieutenant.

280
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:18,456
Bring peace and prosperity
to the galaxy,

281
00:17:19,143 --> 00:17:21,049
install a regim loyal to the Emperor,

282
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,795
and eradicate the hostiles.

283
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:25,191
It's their planet, we're the hostiles.

284
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,643
You got a problem, trooper?

285
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:30,200
No problem, sir.

286
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:33,979
Moving out.

287
00:17:34,438 --> 00:17:36,877
To the southern marshlands!
Move out!

288
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:39,137
You heard them! Let's move out!

289
00:17:47,637 --> 00:17:50,700
Looks like they're running sorties
every 30 minutes.

290
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,510
Yeah, I can take out the guards
at the perimeter,

291
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,865
signalman, pilot.

292
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:56,354
Hell, I'll just take them all out.

293
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,783
What are we looking at?

294
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:04,810
You have a talent for sticking your
nose in where it doesn't belong.

295
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,312
I just couldn't help but notice,

296
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,723
you're wearing a uniform
pock-full of laser burns.

297
00:18:08,764 --> 00:18:10,774
So either you heal real quick,

298
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:13,162
or you stole it off a dead man.

299
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:15,137
You're not Imperial Army.

300
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:18,613
You're thieves here to steal
equipment for a job and I want in.

301
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:21,241
Well, now we gotta shoot him.
No.

302
00:18:22,406 --> 00:18:24,542
Snap his neck.
It's less mess.

303
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:25,996
Or you take me with you.

304
00:18:25,997 --> 00:18:28,710
Look, I came up running scams
on the streets of Corellia.

305
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:31,215
I was boosting AV-21s when I was ten.

306
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:32,995
I'm a driver, a flyer,

307
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,585
and hey, you said yourself.
I gotta get outta here. Right?

308
00:18:36,641 --> 00:18:39,156
<i>What's a fancy flyboy
doing down in the mud?</i>

309
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,106
Well.

310
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:42,422
I got kicked out
of the Imperial Academy

311
00:18:42,505 --> 00:18:44,016
for having a mind of my own.

312
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:45,827
But I am a great pilot.

313
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:47,460
And I gotta get home.

314
00:18:47,603 --> 00:18:48,514
<i>This guy is nuts.</i>

315
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,199
<i>No one goes back to Corellia.</i>

316
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:51,571
I got a reason.

317
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:53,437
We've already got a great pilot.

318
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:56,566
The Ardennian.

319
00:18:56,576 --> 00:18:58,708
<i>Ardennian?
You got a lot of nerve, pal.</i>

320
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,103
<i>I'm an Imperial trooper.</i>

321
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,198
Really? A couple of your arms
popped out of your butt

322
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:03,969
and hiked up your pants, trooper.

323
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:04,768
<i>Yeah?</i>

324
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:07,212
Look, I'll do whatever it
takes to get back to Corellia.

325
00:19:07,252 --> 00:19:08,488
I've already been away too long.

326
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:10,431
Just, give me a shot.

327
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:12,348
Hold it.

328
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,663
Well, if you're not interested in me,

329
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:18,499
I think the lieutenant might
be very interested in you.

330
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:23,575
Blackmail.

331
00:19:26,211 --> 00:19:27,180
Lieutenant.

332
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,220
Captain.

333
00:19:29,214 --> 00:19:31,760
Lieutenant, we have
apprehended a deserter.

334
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,707
Take him.

335
00:19:32,747 --> 00:19:33,538
That's. Wait.

336
00:19:33,578 --> 00:19:34,623
I should've known.

337
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:36,272
This one's a troublemaker.

338
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:38,782
And a liar.
Don't believe anything he says.

339
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:40,950
Don't go anywhere without me.
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

340
00:19:40,974 --> 00:19:42,199
Feed him to the beast.

341
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:43,926
The beast?
Wait, there's a beast?

342
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:44,975
Hold on!
<i>Move it!</i>

343
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:47,430
Listen, that guy's not
even an officer. All right?

344
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,606
He was lying!
<i>Quiet!</i>

345
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,601
<i>Don't care.</i>

346
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:56,146
<i>Haven't fed him in three days.</i>

347
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:57,240
<i>Should be fun.</i>

348
00:20:44,098 --> 00:20:46,495
Hey! Hey, big fella.

349
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:47,736
Just calm down.

350
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:49,268
Take it easy.

351
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:50,838
We're on the same side.

352
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,293
You like treats?

353
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:56,543
Help! Let me out of here!

354
00:20:56,683 --> 00:20:57,852
Let me out of here!

355
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:02,493
Gotcha!

356
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,693
<i>This was just getting good.</i>

357
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:27,081
<i>He killed him too fast.
Yeah!</i>

358
00:21:27,122 --> 00:21:28,422
<i>Kill him slower.</i>

359
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:32,663
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

360
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:34,366
Wait! Wait!

361
00:21:39,002 --> 00:21:40,108
Yeah, I speak a little.

362
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:41,667
Now just listen to me, you...

363
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:03,448
Yes, yes!

364
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:05,358
No, no, no, no!

365
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:09,193
Do it!

366
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,378
Come on.

367
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:13,849
No!

368
00:22:14,211 --> 00:22:16,029
<i>Ten credits, he doesn't
last another minute.</i>

369
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,429
Let me out of here!

370
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:19,726
I can't take it anymore!

371
00:22:20,878 --> 00:22:22,971
No! Stop, please!
<i>That's it. Get him!</i>

372
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,728
You tired, you mangy
Kashyyykian moof-milker?

373
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:41,586
See what happens when you listen to me?

374
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:43,574
Hey, what are you doing?

375
00:22:50,693 --> 00:22:51,694
Follow me!

376
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:03,799
Wait, wait.

377
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:04,829
Come here.

378
00:23:05,254 --> 00:23:05,934
Listen to me.

379
00:23:06,074 --> 00:23:07,032
You don't understand, ok?

380
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:09,034
I have some very good friends
waiting for me at that airfield.

381
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:10,455
They're leaving right now.

382
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:12,174
That's our one way off this mud ball.

383
00:23:12,214 --> 00:23:13,750
If you wanna live, we go that way.

384
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,263
After that, you go whichever
way you want, I don't care!

385
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:18,511
But right now, that's the way you go!

386
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,175
Trust me!

387
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,837
Val, let's go!

388
00:23:28,563 --> 00:23:31,377
How do they breathe in these suits?
It's so stuffy!

389
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:33,432
No wonder they're such lousy pilots.

390
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:35,164
You can't turn your head,
you can't breathe,

391
00:23:35,188 --> 00:23:36,578
you can't hear each other!

392
00:23:43,517 --> 00:23:44,823
I'll be damned.

393
00:23:45,117 --> 00:23:46,528
Hey, look who's back!

394
00:23:46,601 --> 00:23:47,841
Unbelievable!

395
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:49,654
Wait!

396
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,452
Wait!

397
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,825
Is that a Wookiee?
Incredible!

398
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:55,589
I'll say it, I don't care.

399
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,064
This kid's growing on me.

400
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:58,838
Wait!

401
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:05,546
You know, we could always use
some muscle on a job like this.

402
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,666
Don't even think about it!

403
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:10,299
I'm telling you, you will
never have a deeper sleep

404
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:12,065
than curled up in a Wookiee's lap.

405
00:24:19,628 --> 00:24:20,685
I told you!

406
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,813
Very good friends!

407
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:50,248
We couldn't have done this
maybe, like, one at a time?

408
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:20,360
Thanks for helping me get outta there.

409
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,651
No, they only took you because of me.

410
00:25:29,831 --> 00:25:30,631
Hey!

411
00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:33,426
I got us a real sweet deal here.

412
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:35,780
We do this one job with them,

413
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:37,485
we make some real money,

414
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:39,288
and then we're free.

415
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,038
When's the last time you could say that?

416
00:25:45,476 --> 00:25:47,046
Been a while for me too.

417
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,872
So what's your name anyway?

418
00:25:54,816 --> 00:25:56,142
Chewbacca?

419
00:25:57,338 --> 00:25:59,628
All right, well, you're gonna
need a nickname,

420
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:01,441
because I ain't saying that every time.

421
00:26:07,252 --> 00:26:08,744
Here it comes. Take a look.

422
00:26:08,745 --> 00:26:09,387
Yeah.

423
00:26:09,427 --> 00:26:13,322
We hit the Conveyex between
the tower and the bridge.

424
00:26:13,384 --> 00:26:16,564
Rio drops us in, we separate
the payload container,

425
00:26:16,605 --> 00:26:19,195
cable it up to the AT-hauler and then...

426
00:26:19,235 --> 00:26:21,089
Rio jams their distress signal.

427
00:26:21,772 --> 00:26:22,872
I blow the bridge,

428
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:24,806
the container slides right off the track

429
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:26,259
and we sail away.

430
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,964
You trip that security beam,

431
00:26:28,104 --> 00:26:31,690
wake up those Vipers,
it's liable to get real spicy, real fast.

432
00:26:31,752 --> 00:26:33,812
Well, I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

433
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,372
Enfys Nest.

434
00:26:35,466 --> 00:26:36,831
What's an Enfys Nest?

435
00:26:36,907 --> 00:26:39,826
I told you, we're way ahead
of the competition on this one.

436
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:42,986
There's no way Enfys Nest
even knows about this shipment.

437
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,949
Only my guy has the intel.

438
00:26:44,989 --> 00:26:47,480
Well, you better be right.
Yeah?

439
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:49,293
Because sometimes you put your faith,

440
00:26:49,783 --> 00:26:51,117
in the wrong people.

441
00:26:53,353 --> 00:26:55,843
Our whole future
depends on this one score

442
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:57,201
and you bring in amateurs.

443
00:26:57,256 --> 00:27:00,166
In case you hadn't noticed,
we're a little shorthanded.

444
00:27:00,236 --> 00:27:01,691
So we get who we need.

445
00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:04,219
The Xan sisters, or Bossk.

446
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,271
But no,

447
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:08,167
instead you're putting our lives
in the hands of morons.

448
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,537
You guys morons?

449
00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:11,429
No!

450
00:27:11,469 --> 00:27:13,615
No. See?
We're not morons.

451
00:27:13,655 --> 00:27:16,630
Look, I waited a long time
for a shot like this.

452
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,476
I'm not about to screw it up, all right?

453
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:20,436
Come on, Val!

454
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:22,114
He looks so sincere.

455
00:27:22,161 --> 00:27:24,661
Plus, have you ever tried to disinvite
a Wookiee to anything?

456
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:25,931
Not a good idea!

457
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,621
This is not funny!

458
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:33,051
Look now, I have great
instincts about these guys.

459
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:34,477
And besides,

460
00:27:34,802 --> 00:27:36,865
do you see any other options?

461
00:27:37,105 --> 00:27:38,469
I just hope you know what you're doing.

462
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:41,257
Yeah I know exactly
what I'm doing and why.

463
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:42,951
We're gonna clear our debts,

464
00:27:43,191 --> 00:27:45,104
go back to Glee Anselm,

465
00:27:46,061 --> 00:27:48,824
and I'm finally gonna learn
how to play that valachord.

466
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,052
Babe, you're never gonna learn
how to play the valachord.

467
00:27:51,076 --> 00:27:52,905
She's right.
You are tone-deaf.

468
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,538
So what's your sob story, flyboy?

469
00:27:58,878 --> 00:27:59,752
Who, me?

470
00:27:59,793 --> 00:28:01,590
You're after something, I know the look.

471
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,485
What is it? Revenge?

472
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:05,957
No, it's not revenge.

473
00:28:06,223 --> 00:28:07,251
Look at him.

474
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:09,039
If it's anything, it's a girl.

475
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,261
Because a girl!

476
00:28:10,301 --> 00:28:12,867
Tell us about the girl, Han.
Is she nice?

477
00:28:13,461 --> 00:28:15,126
Does she have sharp teeth?

478
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,608
There was a girl.

479
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:20,781
But...

480
00:28:21,806 --> 00:28:23,372
I got out, she didn't.

481
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,367
I swore to myself I'd become a pilot,

482
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,454
get a ship,

483
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,442
go back and find her.

484
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:34,537
That's what I'm gonna do right
after this job.

485
00:28:36,408 --> 00:28:37,944
How you know she'll still be there?

486
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,568
I just know.

487
00:28:41,046 --> 00:28:43,386
Personally I refuse to be tied down
by anyone,

488
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:44,588
though many have tried.

489
00:28:44,728 --> 00:28:45,810
Come on, Rio.

490
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:47,559
You don't fool me.

491
00:28:47,598 --> 00:28:49,112
Everybody needs somebody.

492
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,227
Even a broken down
old crook like this one.

493
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,571
How about you?
What are you gonna do with your share?

494
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:20,690
What was he saying?

495
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,808
He said the Wookiees were enslaved
by the Empire, taken off Kashyyyk.

496
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,723
He's searching for his...

497
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:30,271
I don't know if he said tribe or family.

498
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:32,920
What's the difference?

499
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:37,145
Show me how to do that.

500
00:29:37,726 --> 00:29:39,755
The only thing you need
to learn to do...

501
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:45,278
is do what I say, when I say it.

502
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:47,065
And this time tomorrow,

503
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:50,082
you'll have more than enough
to buy your own ship.

504
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:13,236
<i>Starting the clock.</i>

505
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:16,078
Jamming their signal.
9.6 to the bridge.

506
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:18,521
<i>Let's find out how good
we really are, folks.</i>

507
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:31,124
I'm fine!

508
00:30:35,426 --> 00:30:37,010
Val, how's it going up there?

509
00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:42,420
Never better.

510
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:06,889
Coaxium.

511
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:09,315
Enough to power a fleet!

512
00:31:09,355 --> 00:31:11,861
Or blow us all straight to hell!

513
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,824
<i>All right, talk to me.</i>

514
00:31:16,045 --> 00:31:17,274
Is it a good day?

515
00:31:17,485 --> 00:31:19,079
<i>It's a great day!</i>

516
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,683
Best day of your life, my grabby friend!

517
00:31:21,753 --> 00:31:24,710
I don't know, you've never been
to a Mynock roast on Ardennia.

518
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,851
It's nuts!

519
00:31:28,476 --> 00:31:29,670
Here they come!

520
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:31,460
Get down to the couplers!

521
00:31:31,508 --> 00:31:32,761
Rio, fall back!

522
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,438
Well, that didn't take them long.

523
00:31:52,752 --> 00:31:53,752
Chewie!

524
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:11,322
You all right?

525
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:13,664
Little close there, buddy!

526
00:32:18,085 --> 00:32:19,796
Han, what's the holdup?

527
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,916
All right, together.

528
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,737
Now!

529
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,730
All right!

530
00:32:38,632 --> 00:32:41,072
They got one uncoupled.
Where are you, buddy?

531
00:32:41,145 --> 00:32:42,978
<i>Just up here
planning my retirement.</i>

532
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,266
Thinking about opening a cantina

533
00:32:44,268 --> 00:32:46,440
somewhere warm
but not too warm, you know?

534
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,850
Lowering the winch cables now!

535
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:07,849
I knew it! I told him! Beckett!

536
00:33:07,923 --> 00:33:09,091
<i>He's coming!</i>

537
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:13,134
Damn it! I'm never gonna
hear the end of this!

538
00:33:17,884 --> 00:33:19,111
Who's that?

539
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:20,607
Enfys Nest!

540
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,501
Marauders, pirates.

541
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:24,333
Come to snake the score
from under us.

542
00:33:25,362 --> 00:33:27,096
<i>Ready your harpoons.</i>

543
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:28,099
<i>Move in.</i>

544
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:11,008
Hang on!
I got an uninvited guest.

545
00:34:11,094 --> 00:34:14,152
Get off of my ship!

546
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,321
You still with us, brother?

547
00:34:21,577 --> 00:34:22,579
Yeah, I'm ok.

548
00:34:22,637 --> 00:34:24,440
Just nicked one of my shoulders.
It's nothing.

549
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,313
He's not ok.

550
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:34,837
Chewie!

551
00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:37,306
You gotta uncouple this one
on your own!

552
00:34:42,754 --> 00:34:44,081
Han!

553
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,398
I'm on it!

554
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,104
Val!

555
00:34:56,106 --> 00:34:58,696
<i>Keep your eyes open.
We just tripped a sensor.</i>

556
00:35:04,578 --> 00:35:06,145
Viper droids headed your way!

557
00:35:08,587 --> 00:35:09,116
Rio?

558
00:35:09,512 --> 00:35:11,531
Yeah, it looks worse than it is.

559
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:13,384
Just gotta patch it up.

560
00:35:14,324 --> 00:35:16,694
Maybe rest my eyes for a minute.

561
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:38,870
<i>Enough! I'm going in.</i>

562
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,580
You weren't lying, kid.

563
00:36:06,922 --> 00:36:08,517
You're a hell of a pilot.

564
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:10,014
Rio, stay with me, buddy.

565
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:24,959
Beckett, we just lost a cable!

566
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:27,545
<i>2.1 to the bridge!</i>

567
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:33,686
It's no good to die alone, kid.

568
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:36,692
Val was right.

569
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:40,357
Rio?

570
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:12,962
Beckett, we're .8 from the bridge!

571
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:14,865
<i>Val's still on the track!</i>

572
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:17,404
Val, you gotta get off that bridge!

573
00:37:17,406 --> 00:37:18,406
We're here!

574
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,310
They got me pinned!

575
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,731
I'm gonna have to finish
the job from right here.

576
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:27,974
What?

577
00:37:28,451 --> 00:37:30,054
It's been a ride, babe.

578
00:37:31,658 --> 00:37:33,327
And I wouldn't trade it for anything.

579
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:35,353
<i>Val!</i>

580
00:37:35,423 --> 00:37:36,624
No!

581
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:44,506
No!

582
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,966
Chewie, now!

583
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,520
<i>Beckett, I can't pull it away from them.</i>

584
00:38:25,257 --> 00:38:27,658
They'll let go, you fly straight!

585
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,526
<i>Release your cables,</i>

586
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:33,003
<i>or die!</i>

587
00:38:34,275 --> 00:38:34,990
We're too close.

588
00:38:34,992 --> 00:38:36,120
I gotta release.

589
00:38:36,122 --> 00:38:37,596
You do what I tell you, Han!

590
00:38:37,598 --> 00:38:39,050
Chewie, grab the line!

591
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,482
Don't you do it!

592
00:38:43,778 --> 00:38:44,975
Han!

593
00:38:45,015 --> 00:38:46,581
<i>You coward!</i>

594
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,694
What the hell?

595
00:39:36,985 --> 00:39:40,427
You don't listen
and you can't follow orders!

596
00:39:40,553 --> 00:39:42,495
You have any idea what you've done?

597
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,800
We were not stealing for ourselves,

598
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:48,417
we were hired by Crimson Dawn.

599
00:39:50,778 --> 00:39:52,241
Crimson Dawn?

600
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:55,401
Now we owe them 100 keys
of refined coaxium.

601
00:39:55,403 --> 00:39:57,599
When they find out we don't got it,

602
00:39:57,902 --> 00:39:59,670
they're gonna kill us.

603
00:40:01,237 --> 00:40:02,166
Right.

604
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,691
We run.

605
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:05,239
I'm already a deserter.

606
00:40:05,264 --> 00:40:06,425
What's the difference?

607
00:40:07,014 --> 00:40:08,041
The difference,

608
00:40:08,243 --> 00:40:12,036
is the Empire doesn't send out
a team of enforcers to hunt you down

609
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,559
when you're a deserter.

610
00:40:13,638 --> 00:40:14,973
Dryden Vos will.

611
00:40:17,149 --> 00:40:19,808
You have any idea what it's like
to live with a price on your head?

612
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:23,758
The only thing to do is to go to them.

613
00:40:24,445 --> 00:40:26,516
Maybe I can find some way
to make it up to him.

614
00:40:31,381 --> 00:40:32,616
Then that's what we do.

615
00:40:37,623 --> 00:40:38,524
No.

616
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:44,727
He knows me, not you.

617
00:40:46,337 --> 00:40:47,872
If you come with me,

618
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,817
and show your face,

619
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,154
if they don't kill you,

620
00:40:55,008 --> 00:40:56,711
you're in this life for good.

621
00:40:59,368 --> 00:41:00,680
You find some way to...

622
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:02,228
square this,

623
00:41:04,149 --> 00:41:05,483
we still get our money?

624
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:08,793
Maybe.

625
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,212
For me, it's worth the risk.

626
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:17,676
How about you?

627
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:25,920
That's yes.

628
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,131
Sorry, I punched your face.

629
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,820
Happens more often than you think.

630
00:41:36,154 --> 00:41:37,242
So when we get up there,

631
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:39,321
Dryden Vos is waiting for us
at Fort Ypso?

632
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:41,780
Nearby, on his yacht.

633
00:41:42,546 --> 00:41:44,241
You're gonna know how to find it?

634
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,190
That won't be a problem.

635
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:29,651
I'll need to check your weapons.

636
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,999
That's all I got left.

637
00:43:13,517 --> 00:43:16,310
I'm here to see Dryden.
He's expecting me.

638
00:43:16,517 --> 00:43:17,840
He'll be with you shortly.

639
00:43:17,842 --> 00:43:20,004
He's just finishing
with the regional governor.

640
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,525
Excuse me, sir.

641
00:43:26,527 --> 00:43:27,588
Yes.

642
00:43:27,677 --> 00:43:29,265
Beckett has arrived.

643
00:43:32,689 --> 00:43:35,367
Put this in my office.
I might be needing it later.

644
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:45,255
I get all worked up. Silly.

645
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:46,830
It's a party.

646
00:43:50,288 --> 00:43:51,259
Hey.

647
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:54,320
These people are not your friends,

648
00:43:54,746 --> 00:43:57,376
and they're never gonna be,
so don't talk to any of them.

649
00:43:57,449 --> 00:43:58,579
Don't look at anybody,

650
00:43:58,581 --> 00:44:00,408
just keep your eyes down.

651
00:44:04,204 --> 00:44:05,557
I might get a drink.

652
00:44:18,547 --> 00:44:20,021
No, yeah, whatever.

653
00:44:38,382 --> 00:44:40,852
Chewie, would you please...

654
00:44:49,968 --> 00:44:51,730
Qi'ra, what are you doing here?

655
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,094
I work, I work here.

656
00:44:53,369 --> 00:44:54,931
What's your excuse?

657
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:56,363
My... I...

658
00:44:56,465 --> 00:44:57,935
Qi'ra, I was...

659
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:02,445
I was coming back for you.

660
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:05,369
It's in the past, Han.

661
00:45:05,457 --> 00:45:07,264
Not for me.
The only reason I'm here,

662
00:45:07,265 --> 00:45:08,618
I was doing this job,
get a little money

663
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:10,909
and then I was gonna come back
to Corellia and find you.

664
00:45:11,386 --> 00:45:13,454
Well, now you don't have to.

665
00:45:14,486 --> 00:45:15,955
I'm right in front of you.

666
00:45:18,673 --> 00:45:19,764
That day...

667
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:21,715
Sometimes, a lot of times, I think...

668
00:45:21,717 --> 00:45:23,018
If you'd have stayed,

669
00:45:24,231 --> 00:45:25,701
they would've killed you.

670
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,328
I'm glad you got out.

671
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,470
How did you get out?

672
00:45:39,235 --> 00:45:40,404
I didn't.

673
00:45:44,306 --> 00:45:45,461
You look good.

674
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:47,844
A little rough around the edges,

675
00:45:47,941 --> 00:45:49,243
but good.

676
00:45:49,787 --> 00:45:50,889
You too.

677
00:45:51,627 --> 00:45:52,826
Thank you, Ottilie.

678
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:55,458
Have you been attentive to Dok-Ondar?

679
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,528
Very.

680
00:45:59,977 --> 00:46:01,407
What should we drink to?

681
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,854
Let's drink two and see where it goes.

682
00:46:13,268 --> 00:46:15,952
Did you ever get that ship
we were going to fly away on?

683
00:46:15,975 --> 00:46:17,939
Yeah. Sort of.

684
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,490
About to. That's why I'm here.

685
00:46:20,549 --> 00:46:21,968
I'm working on a...

686
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:24,627
Very big deal.

687
00:46:24,854 --> 00:46:25,982
How big?

688
00:46:26,171 --> 00:46:27,182
Enormous.

689
00:46:27,237 --> 00:46:30,768
Really? And when are you going
to close this enormous deal?

690
00:46:30,883 --> 00:46:32,051
Any minute.

691
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:35,434
I thought about you a lot.

692
00:46:36,195 --> 00:46:39,011
Off somewhere, some adventure.

693
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,443
I imagined myself with you.
It always made me...

694
00:46:45,544 --> 00:46:46,574
What?
Hey.

695
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,698
What did I say?

696
00:46:49,452 --> 00:46:51,491
Look, I can't keep my eyes
down the whole time.

697
00:46:51,571 --> 00:46:52,968
I'm gonna bump into something.

698
00:46:52,992 --> 00:46:54,250
I don't want...
But I told you not to talk to anyone.

699
00:46:54,374 --> 00:46:55,375
Beckett.
What do you...

700
00:46:56,262 --> 00:46:56,980
Wait.

701
00:46:58,005 --> 00:46:59,257
You two work together?

702
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:01,507
Yeah.
Tobias!

703
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,548
Dryden.

704
00:47:05,195 --> 00:47:06,225
Are you all right?

705
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:07,404
Are you hurt?

706
00:47:07,406 --> 00:47:08,675
No, I'm fine.

707
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:11,795
I'm sorry to hear about Val.

708
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,250
Yeah, I appreciate that.

709
00:47:13,327 --> 00:47:14,594
But there was no way
we could've anticipated...

710
00:47:14,596 --> 00:47:16,958
I don't believe we've been introduced.

711
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,208
Yeah. This is Han Solo and Chewbacca.

712
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,804
They're with me.

713
00:47:21,807 --> 00:47:23,235
I'm Dryden Vos.

714
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:27,300
I see you've already met
my top lieutenant.

715
00:47:29,836 --> 00:47:32,016
Han and I grew up together on Corellia.

716
00:47:33,301 --> 00:47:34,510
Fellow scrumrat.

717
00:47:35,308 --> 00:47:38,339
I admire anyone who can crawl
their way out of the sewer.

718
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:41,356
Especially, a sewer as putrid as Corellia.

719
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,420
The stench, am I right?

720
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,060
Well, it's good to have you.

721
00:47:46,335 --> 00:47:47,371
Welcome.

722
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:50,252
And you too Chewbacca, welcome.

723
00:47:51,116 --> 00:47:54,853
All right, let's eat a little drink a lot,

724
00:47:55,155 --> 00:47:56,498
and talk privately.

725
00:47:59,694 --> 00:48:01,103
We're just friends, all right?

726
00:48:01,105 --> 00:48:03,032
You're touchy.

727
00:48:03,921 --> 00:48:07,593
Beckett, you have
put me in a terrible position.

728
00:48:07,644 --> 00:48:09,725
I know Dryden and I am sorry.

729
00:48:09,784 --> 00:48:10,709
You're sorry?

730
00:48:10,747 --> 00:48:12,210
Dryden, there were complications.

731
00:48:12,212 --> 00:48:13,000
There were factors.

732
00:48:13,002 --> 00:48:16,423
Enfys Nest has been
a constant irritation forever.

733
00:48:16,425 --> 00:48:18,032
It's one you should've anticipated,

734
00:48:18,034 --> 00:48:19,595
it's one you should've dealt with.

735
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:21,583
Trust me I know
I made a mistake but,

736
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:25,076
when you hired me, you told me
no one else had this information...

737
00:48:25,078 --> 00:48:26,367
Test me!

738
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:30,436
Test me one more time,
you'll see what happens.

739
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,895
I think what Dryden is trying to say

740
00:48:33,097 --> 00:48:35,528
is that we're not interested
in why you don't have it.

741
00:48:36,036 --> 00:48:37,790
No I'm not interested.

742
00:48:37,892 --> 00:48:39,601
I'm not interested at all.

743
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:40,963
Dryden,

744
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:42,738
what can I do to make this right?

745
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:44,447
Make this right?

746
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,016
There is no making this right.

747
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:48,846
You know who I answer to

748
00:48:48,848 --> 00:48:51,201
and you know what he'll expect of me.

749
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,340
He'll say, there have
to be consequences.

750
00:48:53,342 --> 00:48:57,067
So here's what I need you,
to do for me.

751
00:48:57,195 --> 00:49:00,730
I need you to give me a reason,

752
00:49:01,192 --> 00:49:03,337
not to kill you all.

753
00:49:03,886 --> 00:49:05,796
Because I will make it up to you.

754
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:07,076
No, no, no. How?

755
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,363
How will you make it up to me?

756
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:11,664
By delivering exactly
what was promised.

757
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:15,331
100 k-grams of refined coaxium?

758
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:18,769
Yes. We will simply steal it
from somewhere else.

759
00:49:18,871 --> 00:49:20,301
From where?

760
00:49:20,382 --> 00:49:21,510
You'll be hard pushed to find that

761
00:49:21,512 --> 00:49:23,187
anywhere outside an Imperial vault.

762
00:49:23,389 --> 00:49:25,184
Scarif. Maybe Mercy Island.

763
00:49:25,186 --> 00:49:26,520
That's impossible.

764
00:49:26,722 --> 00:49:29,119
So, let's come up
with some other options.

765
00:49:29,286 --> 00:49:30,581
Other ideas that we might...

766
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,386
What about unrefined?

767
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:38,694
Well, the only known
source of astatic coaxium

768
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:41,690
is a fissure vent beneath
the spice mines on Kessel.

769
00:49:41,692 --> 00:49:43,925
Yeah. That's the one I was thinking of.

770
00:49:43,927 --> 00:49:45,558
That's a very, very good one.

771
00:49:45,637 --> 00:49:47,850
But see, the Pykes control Kessel.

772
00:49:48,103 --> 00:49:50,663
Crimson Dawn maintains
a fragile alliance with the Pykes.

773
00:49:51,352 --> 00:49:52,869
It's one that I can't,

774
00:49:52,894 --> 00:49:55,759
jeopardize without risking an
all-out war with the Syndicates,

775
00:49:55,761 --> 00:49:57,037
and that gentlemen,

776
00:49:57,562 --> 00:49:58,863
I will not do.

777
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:02,735
So if, that's all you have,
I think we're done here.

778
00:50:02,737 --> 00:50:03,598
Not all we have.

779
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,630
We don't have any alliance
with the Pykes.

780
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:09,001
Right, so nobody is gonna know
we're working for you.

781
00:50:19,089 --> 00:50:20,090
Possible?

782
00:50:20,554 --> 00:50:21,817
It's risky.

783
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:24,417
As soon as the raw coaxium
is removed from the vault,

784
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:26,619
it starts to destabilize so...

785
00:50:27,344 --> 00:50:28,439
unless...
Unless?

786
00:50:29,669 --> 00:50:30,837
Unless...

787
00:50:31,563 --> 00:50:32,691
Work with me here.

788
00:50:32,893 --> 00:50:34,481
Unless you could find somewhere,

789
00:50:34,683 --> 00:50:36,183
to get it processed fast.

790
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:39,476
Well...

791
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:41,929
He's saying Savareen?

792
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:43,380
Savareen.

793
00:50:43,482 --> 00:50:47,472
Yeah, it's an old refinery there
and it's not under Imperial jurisdiction.

794
00:50:47,558 --> 00:50:48,715
But Qi'ra's right.

795
00:50:49,277 --> 00:50:52,308
The canisters will explode
before you get there so...

796
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:56,800
you'd need an incredibly fast ship
and a brilliant pilot.

797
00:50:57,114 --> 00:50:58,348
We'll find a ship.

798
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:00,160
We've already got the pilot.

799
00:51:04,847 --> 00:51:07,811
He is arrogant and he's hungry.

800
00:51:08,641 --> 00:51:09,597
So what do you think, my dear?

801
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,399
You think your friend here
can do what needs to be done?

802
00:51:20,922 --> 00:51:22,891
Yes, I believe he can.

803
00:51:24,506 --> 00:51:25,794
Well, that is good news,

804
00:51:25,796 --> 00:51:27,492
because you're going with him,

805
00:51:28,087 --> 00:51:29,559
to see that he does.

806
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:33,077
All right?

807
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:35,804
Of course.

808
00:51:37,421 --> 00:51:38,684
All right.

809
00:51:39,035 --> 00:51:40,696
I'll see you all on Savareen.

810
00:51:40,804 --> 00:51:41,824
Savareen it is.

811
00:51:41,878 --> 00:51:43,667
I feel great about this plan.
Me too.

812
00:51:43,669 --> 00:51:45,395
We should do this again.
It's been fun.

813
00:51:45,927 --> 00:51:46,444
Great.

814
00:51:46,846 --> 00:51:48,308
And just one more thing.

815
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:50,248
If you do fail me again,

816
00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:53,435
we'll all be out of options.

817
00:51:54,238 --> 00:51:55,309
Right?

818
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:56,379
We won't.

819
00:51:59,414 --> 00:52:01,230
So, I thought that went really well.

820
00:52:02,282 --> 00:52:04,523
Let's get this done as quick
and as clean as possible.

821
00:52:04,525 --> 00:52:05,411
What do you need?

822
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,170
I can scrounge up the gear.

823
00:52:07,172 --> 00:52:08,586
Do you got a line on a ship?

824
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:09,925
I know a guy.

825
00:52:11,182 --> 00:52:12,845
And I know just where to find him.

826
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:15,606
It's a long shot, but it's worth a try.

827
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:17,075
He's the best smuggler around.

828
00:52:17,077 --> 00:52:20,062
He's slipped through the Empire's
fingers more times than anyone else.

829
00:52:20,832 --> 00:52:22,776
He's attractive, too.

830
00:52:23,178 --> 00:52:26,174
Sophisticated with impeccable
taste and...

831
00:52:26,899 --> 00:52:27,971
Charisma.

832
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,045
Not to mention his prodigious.

833
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:33,127
We get it.

834
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:38,932
But he's retired.

835
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:41,095
Says he's a sportsman now.

836
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,558
All we need is his ship.

837
00:52:42,773 --> 00:52:44,384
Well, he'll never part with it.

838
00:52:44,486 --> 00:52:45,667
He loves that ship.

839
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:47,236
He won it...

840
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:48,814
playing Sabacc.

841
00:52:48,816 --> 00:52:49,994
And there's the rub, right?

842
00:52:50,096 --> 00:52:52,208
How was I supposed to know
she was an Imperial spy?

843
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:53,806
I thought she loved me.

844
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:55,839
That's the guy?

845
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,498
An interesting style.

846
00:52:59,773 --> 00:53:00,775
I'll say.

847
00:53:01,564 --> 00:53:02,697
You say he won his ship?

848
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:04,815
You have an awful Sabacc face.
I'm gonna call it.

849
00:53:04,817 --> 00:53:06,454
I can take him. Let me at him.

850
00:53:06,756 --> 00:53:07,918
Absolutely not.

851
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,982
Han, these guys are serious gamblers.

852
00:53:10,043 --> 00:53:11,839
I'm serious. Stake me.

853
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:14,647
Don't listen to him.

854
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:22,707
Thank you. Thank you.

855
00:53:23,009 --> 00:53:24,779
You see, how'd you guys
let me beat you on that one?

856
00:53:24,781 --> 00:53:25,782
Come on.

857
00:53:27,101 --> 00:53:29,217
There's no liars in this game,
just players.

858
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,810
Is this seat taken?

859
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:36,037
If nobody's in the seat,
then it ain't taken friend.

860
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:40,649
So this is...

861
00:53:40,874 --> 00:53:41,824
Sabacc?

862
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:42,954
Sabacc.

863
00:53:42,956 --> 00:53:45,487
Sabacc. Got it.

864
00:53:45,641 --> 00:53:46,835
You play it before?

865
00:53:47,116 --> 00:53:48,609
A couple times, yeah.

866
00:53:50,122 --> 00:53:51,579
Captain Lando Calrissian.

867
00:53:51,612 --> 00:53:52,830
Han Solo.

868
00:53:53,432 --> 00:53:55,261
Looks like you're having a good day.

869
00:53:55,586 --> 00:53:56,641
I'm a lucky guy.

870
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:00,431
Can I ask you a question,
Captain Calrissian?

871
00:54:00,643 --> 00:54:01,987
Anything, Han.

872
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:03,827
That's Han but,

873
00:54:04,152 --> 00:54:05,258
that's ok.

874
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:09,296
I heard a story about you.
I was wondering if it's true.

875
00:54:10,453 --> 00:54:14,053
Everything you've heard about me is true.

876
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,180
Thanks love.

877
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:17,211
Did you win your ship playing cards?

878
00:54:17,513 --> 00:54:19,098
I've won a lot of things.

879
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:23,655
I once won a subtropical moon
in the Oseon Belt.

880
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:26,688
Turned out to be a real money pit.

881
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:27,819
I'm impressed.

882
00:54:27,859 --> 00:54:29,120
I don't think I'd have the nerve
to gamble

883
00:54:29,122 --> 00:54:31,417
with something I love
as much as my ship.

884
00:54:31,461 --> 00:54:32,924
Really?
Yeah.

885
00:54:33,454 --> 00:54:34,489
What do you fly?

886
00:54:35,195 --> 00:54:36,597
VCX-100.

887
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:40,224
That is a quality ship.
Right, boys?

888
00:54:40,518 --> 00:54:42,281
It's the fastest in the galaxy,

889
00:54:42,283 --> 00:54:43,712
but there's a lot of
great ships out there.

890
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:45,718
I mean, I'm sure yours is very nice.

891
00:54:46,272 --> 00:54:47,641
Gets me where I'm going.

892
00:54:52,535 --> 00:54:53,670
Beginner's luck.

893
00:54:53,861 --> 00:54:55,063
Well played.

894
00:55:02,796 --> 00:55:04,492
Let's see what we got here.

895
00:55:04,794 --> 00:55:06,386
Great hand!

896
00:55:10,284 --> 00:55:11,312
Sorry, guys.

897
00:55:11,337 --> 00:55:13,306
Close, but not quite.

898
00:55:22,897 --> 00:55:24,567
Eyes on your own cards, buddy.

899
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:26,834
All of them.

900
00:55:27,236 --> 00:55:29,160
There. Well, now I see yours.

901
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:35,632
That's me?

902
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,825
Ok, let's see...

903
00:55:41,169 --> 00:55:42,732
Sorry, minus two.

904
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:49,154
This game is fun.

905
00:55:49,823 --> 00:55:51,269
All right, how about this?

906
00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:54,434
I'll see your bet, and I'll raise you.

907
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:57,035
2,000.

908
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:03,145
I'll see your 2,000...

909
00:56:03,741 --> 00:56:05,471
and I'll raise you...

910
00:56:06,389 --> 00:56:08,009
however much this is.

911
00:56:11,517 --> 00:56:12,469
Han.

912
00:56:12,531 --> 00:56:13,660
Slow down.

913
00:56:14,187 --> 00:56:15,770
You might wanna quit
while you're ahead.

914
00:56:15,844 --> 00:56:17,646
You might wanna quit
while you're behind.

915
00:56:19,892 --> 00:56:21,420
I like this kid.

916
00:56:21,692 --> 00:56:22,788
You're adorable.

917
00:56:22,828 --> 00:56:24,090
And I'm serious.

918
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,621
And I'm calling.

919
00:56:26,269 --> 00:56:27,596
With what?

920
00:56:27,736 --> 00:56:28,736
Your scarf?

921
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:29,967
Not my style.

922
00:56:30,007 --> 00:56:31,175
My ship.

923
00:56:32,494 --> 00:56:34,023
Against your ship.

924
00:56:35,872 --> 00:56:37,706
Time to find out if you got the nerve.

925
00:56:40,763 --> 00:56:41,932
What the hell?

926
00:56:46,048 --> 00:56:47,313
Straight Staves.

927
00:56:57,018 --> 00:56:58,312
You played me.

928
00:56:58,537 --> 00:56:59,738
You're good.

929
00:56:59,777 --> 00:57:01,087
Yeah. You're very good.

930
00:57:01,783 --> 00:57:03,045
But not good enough.

931
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,832
Full Sabacc.

932
00:57:11,396 --> 00:57:13,073
I told you to quit while you were ahead.

933
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:16,664
Drinks on me!

934
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:22,470
Yeah, that's right.

935
00:57:29,953 --> 00:57:32,855
First of all, there's no way
he could've had that green sylop.

936
00:57:32,857 --> 00:57:33,861
They'd all been played.

937
00:57:33,863 --> 00:57:35,792
Also, your guy Captain Wonderful,

938
00:57:35,897 --> 00:57:37,138
is so full of bantha crap...

939
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:42,327
Where's my VCX?

940
00:57:43,038 --> 00:57:44,652
I don't have it right here now.

941
00:57:44,854 --> 00:57:46,107
It's in the shop.

942
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:47,929
I'm getting some work done.
Lando.

943
00:57:49,724 --> 00:57:50,854
Qi'ra.

944
00:57:52,273 --> 00:57:54,150
You look phenomenal.

945
00:57:54,475 --> 00:57:55,494
As always.

946
00:57:55,503 --> 00:57:57,272
Well, I knew I was gonna see you.

947
00:57:58,081 --> 00:57:58,983
Get off!

948
00:57:58,985 --> 00:58:00,412
What are you doing
with hairy and the boy?

949
00:58:00,414 --> 00:58:02,078
There's no need, none.
They work for me.

950
00:58:02,977 --> 00:58:04,144
Good help is hard to find, no?

951
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:05,482
We're more like partners.

952
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:08,086
We are.

953
00:58:08,313 --> 00:58:09,314
Excuse us.

954
00:58:10,228 --> 00:58:11,762
Listen, last I checked,

955
00:58:11,764 --> 00:58:13,462
me and Crimson Dawn,
we're squared away.

956
00:58:13,568 --> 00:58:17,238
Dryden said all is forgiven after I
did the whole Felucia thing for him.

957
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,044
Yeah. New move,
we're making the Kessel Run.

958
00:58:21,763 --> 00:58:23,025
We need a ship.

959
00:58:23,027 --> 00:58:24,354
Why didn't you just say so?

960
00:58:24,356 --> 00:58:25,599
I thought you were retired.

961
00:58:27,026 --> 00:58:28,760
Circumstances change.

962
00:58:29,418 --> 00:58:30,546
How much?

963
00:58:30,987 --> 00:58:32,239
The Kessel Run.

964
00:58:32,507 --> 00:58:33,794
That's no easy spin.

965
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:35,402
I'm gonna need half the take.

966
00:58:35,491 --> 00:58:36,629
Ridiculous.

967
00:58:37,831 --> 00:58:38,904
Grown-ups are talking.

968
00:58:39,136 --> 00:58:40,371
25%.

969
00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:46,906
You're Tobias Beckett.

970
00:58:47,696 --> 00:58:49,271
You killed Aurra Sing.

971
00:58:50,287 --> 00:58:52,799
Pushed her.
Pretty sure the fall killed her.

972
00:58:52,801 --> 00:58:55,564
You did the galaxy a favor day.
Me especially.

973
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:56,794
I owed her a lot of money.

974
00:58:56,796 --> 00:58:58,492
And as token of my gratitude,

975
00:58:59,258 --> 00:59:01,644
I'm willing to do this for 40%.

976
00:59:04,784 --> 00:59:06,054
25.

977
00:59:11,406 --> 00:59:12,669
25% works.

978
00:59:13,472 --> 00:59:15,880
No! Unacceptable!

979
00:59:16,038 --> 00:59:18,010
Stop exploiting droids!

980
00:59:18,081 --> 00:59:20,233
You sloppy degenerate bios!

981
00:59:20,346 --> 00:59:21,924
She never learns.
Have you no shame?

982
00:59:21,948 --> 00:59:22,985
Who?

983
00:59:23,037 --> 00:59:23,702
My first mate.

984
00:59:23,704 --> 00:59:26,248
You got no business
being here. Get out of here!

985
00:59:26,288 --> 00:59:29,066
How can you condone this savagery?

986
00:59:29,264 --> 00:59:31,960
You, you.
You should not be doing this.

987
00:59:31,962 --> 00:59:34,601
They're using you for entertainment.

988
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:36,467
Yeah. You've been neurowashed.

989
00:59:36,498 --> 00:59:38,692
Don't just blindly follow the program.

990
00:59:38,694 --> 00:59:40,714
Exercise some free will!

991
00:59:41,886 --> 00:59:43,383
Stay away from him!

992
00:59:43,509 --> 00:59:45,087
He's never had it so good.

993
00:59:45,088 --> 00:59:47,790
Really? How about you have
a go at me, ya lumpy brute.

994
00:59:47,922 --> 00:59:48,982
Bring it on! Come on!

995
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:49,904
L3!

996
00:59:49,906 --> 00:59:52,165
Droid rights! We are sentient!

997
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:54,124
I'm gonna flip your switch.

998
00:59:55,165 --> 00:59:56,344
Good luck finding it.

999
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:57,480
L3!

1000
00:59:59,427 --> 01:00:01,157
Let go of the mean man's face.

1001
01:00:01,425 --> 01:00:02,230
We're leaving.

1002
01:00:02,276 --> 01:00:04,437
They don't even serve our kind here.

1003
01:00:04,861 --> 01:00:05,861
Now.

1004
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:10,566
Who are these guys?

1005
01:00:10,968 --> 01:00:12,328
We're taking them to Kessel.

1006
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,953
Are we?

1007
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:16,892
And what if I don't elect to go to Kessel?

1008
01:00:16,999 --> 01:00:18,199
Please don't start.

1009
01:00:18,245 --> 01:00:19,858
Or what, you'll have me wiped?

1010
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,197
You couldn't get from here
to Black Spire without me.

1011
01:00:22,253 --> 01:00:23,710
Now you're gonna make
the Kessel Run?

1012
01:00:23,764 --> 01:00:25,827
If she doesn't wanna fly,
I'll be your co-pilot.

1013
01:00:25,867 --> 01:00:27,596
I don't mind.
No, no, no. It's ok.

1014
01:00:27,941 --> 01:00:29,168
She's definitely going.

1015
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:32,401
Why? Because you're
my organic overlord?

1016
01:00:32,403 --> 01:00:34,266
Because I'm your captain,
how about that?

1017
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,410
I actually would have her memory wiped,

1018
01:00:36,912 --> 01:00:39,761
but she's got the best damn
navigational database in the galaxy.

1019
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,001
Could use a fresh coat of paint, though!

1020
01:00:42,054 --> 01:00:45,385
Landonis, you do not want
to press that button with me.

1021
01:00:46,677 --> 01:00:49,241
You know, a lot of ships around
here get boosted.

1022
01:00:49,453 --> 01:00:51,296
So, I keep mine locked up.

1023
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,411
You know, for safety.

1024
01:00:54,062 --> 01:00:56,165
L3, do you mind?

1025
01:01:02,328 --> 01:01:03,544
Look away.

1026
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:05,617
I can't perform
with you looking at me.

1027
01:01:05,903 --> 01:01:06,903
Please indulge her.

1028
01:01:14,987 --> 01:01:16,924
I can feel you looking at me.

1029
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:23,563
What are we doing here?

1030
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:24,999
This guy's a hustler.

1031
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:26,436
I don't even think he's got a ship.

1032
01:01:26,438 --> 01:01:29,060
If he does, it's gonna be a piece
of junk if it's even here.

1033
01:01:29,262 --> 01:01:31,189
There she is, my pride and joy.

1034
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:34,142
The Millennium Falcon.

1035
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,650
Looks like you had a little work done.

1036
01:01:51,814 --> 01:01:53,381
Indeed I have, Han.

1037
01:01:53,446 --> 01:01:55,878
Installed an escape pod
in the mandible notch,

1038
01:01:55,941 --> 01:01:58,452
alluvial dampers, a wet bar.

1039
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:02,372
And a fortified infraction
restraint on the landing gear.

1040
01:02:02,887 --> 01:02:05,624
Looks to me like they
impounded your ship, Lando.

1041
01:02:06,675 --> 01:02:08,204
This is unbelievable!

1042
01:02:08,565 --> 01:02:10,778
I'm definitely gonna have some words
with someone about this.

1043
01:02:13,615 --> 01:02:15,384
You must have experience
with these, right?

1044
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:17,293
Yeah, I could take it off.

1045
01:02:17,364 --> 01:02:18,520
Fantastic!

1046
01:02:18,523 --> 01:02:20,489
Along with five percent off your cut.

1047
01:02:21,314 --> 01:02:22,801
You're down to 20.

1048
01:02:25,836 --> 01:02:26,999
I don't like it.

1049
01:02:27,701 --> 01:02:29,136
I don't agree with it.

1050
01:02:30,262 --> 01:02:31,464
But I accept it.

1051
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,610
You're getting the hang of this, Lando.

1052
01:02:35,321 --> 01:02:36,341
Yeah.

1053
01:02:36,743 --> 01:02:37,941
Come on, Chewie.

1054
01:02:38,143 --> 01:02:40,049
Gonna need a little bit of
that Wookiee oomph.

1055
01:02:42,229 --> 01:02:44,082
<i>Your plan is underway, Enfys.</i>

1056
01:02:44,142 --> 01:02:45,724
<i>We've attached the homing beacon.</i>

1057
01:02:45,726 --> 01:02:47,701
<i>They won't elude us now.</i>

1058
01:02:47,776 --> 01:02:48,778
<i>Good.</i>

1059
01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:57,400
<i>If they survive,
they'll bring the prize to us.</i>

1060
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,019
This is a Corellian YT-1300.

1061
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:17,570
You know your stuff.

1062
01:03:18,243 --> 01:03:19,638
I've been on one before.

1063
01:03:19,994 --> 01:03:23,203
My dad worked the line
at the CEC plant before he got laid off.

1064
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:25,858
He built these.

1065
01:03:27,113 --> 01:03:29,409
He wanted to be a pilot, but...

1066
01:03:29,785 --> 01:03:31,588
You, close with your old man?

1067
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:33,913
Not really.

1068
01:03:34,054 --> 01:03:35,585
Yeah, me neither.

1069
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:37,920
My mom on the other hand,

1070
01:03:38,478 --> 01:03:40,230
most amazing woman I've ever known.

1071
01:03:43,675 --> 01:03:44,828
Excuse me.

1072
01:03:44,868 --> 01:03:47,281
Get your presumptuous ass
out of my seat!

1073
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:55,941
My sacral-occipital circuit is sticking.

1074
01:03:56,524 --> 01:03:58,165
You're gonna have
to do that thing again later.

1075
01:03:58,606 --> 01:03:59,614
Yeah.

1076
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,239
All right, course to Kessel is set.

1077
01:04:02,501 --> 01:04:04,018
Plugging coordinates in now.

1078
01:04:04,263 --> 01:04:05,683
Just keep your pinky on the yoke,

1079
01:04:05,738 --> 01:04:06,937
and try not to mess anything up.

1080
01:04:06,961 --> 01:04:07,961
Whatever you say my lady.

1081
01:04:07,962 --> 01:04:09,342
Just let me know when
you're ready to jump.

1082
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:11,292
Ready in...

1083
01:04:14,205 --> 01:04:15,206
Ready.

1084
01:04:15,945 --> 01:04:18,461
It's just a simple jump to hyperspace,
and we're there.

1085
01:04:18,463 --> 01:04:19,842
What's so tricky about that?

1086
01:04:19,881 --> 01:04:21,953
Plenty.
Can't plot a direct course to Kessel.

1087
01:04:22,308 --> 01:04:24,368
You have to thread through
the Si'Klaata Cluster and then...

1088
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:25,878
pass through The Maelstrom.

1089
01:04:26,636 --> 01:04:28,305
You done flirting?
I'm still ready.

1090
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,259
You might wanna buckle up, baby.

1091
01:04:52,132 --> 01:04:53,132
Think.

1092
01:04:53,313 --> 01:04:54,880
Do you wanna make that move?

1093
01:04:55,123 --> 01:04:56,723
Do you wanna make that move?

1094
01:04:57,478 --> 01:04:59,038
You made that move, ok.

1095
01:04:59,425 --> 01:05:01,789
I guess I have to destroy that little guy.

1096
01:05:02,229 --> 01:05:04,372
Somehow I never get bored with winning.

1097
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:08,326
No, you can't wipe them off.
They're holograms.

1098
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:11,105
Hey, hey, hey! Chewie, relax!

1099
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,558
Hey, try to compose yourself.

1100
01:05:13,582 --> 01:05:15,839
Look. All you gotta do is
think a few moves ahead,

1101
01:05:15,863 --> 01:05:17,374
anticipate your opponent.

1102
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,609
There's a lesson to be learned here.

1103
01:05:19,881 --> 01:05:21,117
You guys seen Qi'ra?

1104
01:05:23,984 --> 01:05:25,491
People are predictable.

1105
01:05:47,451 --> 01:05:49,013
Yeah, I had to try one on.

1106
01:05:49,847 --> 01:05:51,282
That's a lot of capes.

1107
01:05:51,353 --> 01:05:53,362
Maybe too many capes.

1108
01:05:57,763 --> 01:05:58,991
So what's the plan?

1109
01:05:59,479 --> 01:06:01,853
Well, I thought we'd talk a little first
and then you know..

1110
01:06:02,855 --> 01:06:03,959
For Kessel.

1111
01:06:05,452 --> 01:06:06,452
Good.

1112
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:07,902
Yeah, how good?

1113
01:06:08,484 --> 01:06:09,271
Foolproof.

1114
01:06:09,311 --> 01:06:10,672
Well, it better be.

1115
01:06:11,332 --> 01:06:12,141
I...
I...

1116
01:06:12,341 --> 01:06:14,177
You go first.
No. What were you gonna say?

1117
01:06:15,203 --> 01:06:17,763
I wanna tell you, so much.

1118
01:06:18,548 --> 01:06:20,117
And I wanna know everything

1119
01:06:20,157 --> 01:06:21,772
that's happened to you since Corellia.

1120
01:06:22,993 --> 01:06:25,568
I. I'm not sure we have that kinda time.

1121
01:06:26,017 --> 01:06:27,025
We could.

1122
01:06:27,165 --> 01:06:29,346
We could have all the time
we want after the job.

1123
01:06:29,624 --> 01:06:30,624
You and I.

1124
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:32,170
What?

1125
01:06:33,342 --> 01:06:34,377
I want to.

1126
01:06:35,567 --> 01:06:36,636
You want to?

1127
01:06:37,018 --> 01:06:38,588
To tell you everything that's happened.

1128
01:06:40,548 --> 01:06:42,611
But I know if I do,
you won't look at me the same.

1129
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,840
The way that you're looking at me
right now.

1130
01:06:44,957 --> 01:06:47,152
Nothing is gonna change the way
I'm looking at you right now.

1131
01:06:47,154 --> 01:06:49,239
You don't know that.
You don't know what I've done.

1132
01:07:03,454 --> 01:07:04,916
Am I interrupting something?

1133
01:07:07,693 --> 01:07:08,693
Kinda.

1134
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:10,184
Good.

1135
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:11,747
We got a lot of work to do.

1136
01:07:12,587 --> 01:07:14,134
You're making a big mistake.

1137
01:07:14,204 --> 01:07:15,263
Really?
Which is yours to make

1138
01:07:15,265 --> 01:07:17,486
except when you start
to interfere with my livelihood.

1139
01:07:17,526 --> 01:07:19,555
This isn't gonna interfere with your livelihood.
Then we have a problem.

1140
01:07:19,595 --> 01:07:21,752
You don't see it,
because you don't want to.

1141
01:07:22,054 --> 01:07:23,715
Maybe I know her
a little better than you do.

1142
01:07:24,092 --> 01:07:25,761
Maybe you don't know her well enough.

1143
01:07:27,428 --> 01:07:28,132
All right?

1144
01:07:28,297 --> 01:07:29,300
Look.

1145
01:07:30,372 --> 01:07:31,470
I like you kid.

1146
01:07:31,986 --> 01:07:34,458
We got a good thing going here.
Me, you, Chewie.

1147
01:07:34,522 --> 01:07:35,409
Yeah.
Right?

1148
01:07:35,411 --> 01:07:37,568
The makings of a solid crew.

1149
01:07:37,782 --> 01:07:39,343
But it does not work with Qi'ra.

1150
01:07:40,063 --> 01:07:42,298
It worked with Val.
You trusted her.

1151
01:07:44,248 --> 01:07:46,903
You wanna know how
I've survived as long as I have?

1152
01:07:47,899 --> 01:07:49,163
I trust no one.

1153
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:53,157
Assume everyone will betray you

1154
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:54,937
and you will never be disappointed.

1155
01:07:56,397 --> 01:07:58,165
Sounds like a lonely way to live.

1156
01:07:59,261 --> 01:08:00,597
It's the only way.

1157
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,641
Dropping out of lightspeed now.

1158
01:08:09,665 --> 01:08:10,665
Ready to...

1159
01:08:16,106 --> 01:08:17,874
The Akkadese Maelstrom.

1160
01:08:20,077 --> 01:08:21,572
I'm gonna go check on the dampers.

1161
01:08:21,712 --> 01:08:22,640
You need anything?

1162
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:23,849
Equal rights?

1163
01:08:54,328 --> 01:08:55,423
What's that sound?

1164
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:58,480
Carbonbergs, size of planets,
crashing into each other.

1165
01:08:58,682 --> 01:09:01,108
Ships fly in there, they never come out.

1166
01:09:01,264 --> 01:09:03,159
It's ionized gas, water vapor,

1167
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:05,040
possibly vacuum-breathing life forms

1168
01:09:05,132 --> 01:09:06,481
swirling around The Maw.

1169
01:09:06,554 --> 01:09:08,466
Only way in or out is this channel.

1170
01:09:10,171 --> 01:09:11,907
So what are you gonna do
about your little problem?

1171
01:09:12,808 --> 01:09:13,842
Problem?

1172
01:09:14,166 --> 01:09:15,166
I...

1173
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:18,508
Well, that brand on your wrist
tells me that you're committed.

1174
01:09:19,048 --> 01:09:20,844
And that young male's heart fluctuations

1175
01:09:20,868 --> 01:09:22,351
tell me he's in love with you.

1176
01:09:22,421 --> 01:09:24,115
Han is not in love with me!

1177
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:27,929
Please.
It's just us.

1178
01:09:28,173 --> 01:09:29,690
You don't have to pretend.

1179
01:09:30,015 --> 01:09:31,663
I'm in the same situation.

1180
01:09:31,949 --> 01:09:32,712
You are?

1181
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:35,100
I'm sure you've noticed
that Lando has feelings for me.

1182
01:09:35,202 --> 01:09:36,738
Which makes working together difficult

1183
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,887
because I do not feel
the same way about him.

1184
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:40,384
Right.

1185
01:09:40,675 --> 01:09:42,053
Yes, yeah.

1186
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:43,693
Yeah, I see that.

1187
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,231
Sometimes I think...

1188
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,439
Maybe.

1189
01:09:47,445 --> 01:09:48,481
But no.

1190
01:09:50,723 --> 01:09:52,089
We're just not compatible.

1191
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,748
How would that work?

1192
01:09:56,783 --> 01:09:57,784
It works.

1193
01:10:07,932 --> 01:10:09,862
This is a precision job.

1194
01:10:09,964 --> 01:10:12,583
Thermal vault will be on the lowest level.

1195
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:13,995
Down where it's warm.

1196
01:10:14,097 --> 01:10:16,318
The only way we're gonna pull this off,

1197
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,725
is if everybody plays their part.

1198
01:10:18,727 --> 01:10:20,079
Stick to the plan.

1199
01:10:20,581 --> 01:10:22,716
Do not improvise.

1200
01:10:27,484 --> 01:10:29,056
Mining colonies are the worst.

1201
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:32,822
Yeah well, the worst
is where the money is.

1202
01:10:35,087 --> 01:10:37,198
All right, people.
Time to shine.

1203
01:11:13,783 --> 01:11:15,664
It won't be for long.

1204
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:17,395
Shut up, the both of you.

1205
01:11:17,597 --> 01:11:19,156
I am Oksana Floren,

1206
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:22,946
Deputy Assistant Administrator to
the Vice-Admiral of the Federation

1207
01:11:22,971 --> 01:11:26,183
of Trade Route Allocation
and Monetization.

1208
01:11:26,299 --> 01:11:28,579
Here with an offer from his eminence,

1209
01:11:28,603 --> 01:11:30,632
the Senior Vice-Admiral.

1210
01:11:31,507 --> 01:11:35,734
Your spice for our hard-working slaves.
I brought you a sample.

1211
01:11:36,027 --> 01:11:38,097
Tuul bring forth the merchandise.

1212
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:10,346
Director Tolsite said our slaves
should follow those guys,

1213
01:12:10,448 --> 01:12:12,105
to get clipped and tagged.

1214
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:13,692
What are they clipping?

1215
01:12:18,249 --> 01:12:19,604
He wants us to follow him.

1216
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:24,499
Really?

1217
01:12:24,501 --> 01:12:26,990
That's for that stunt you pulled earlier,
you degenerate scum.

1218
01:12:46,722 --> 01:12:48,393
He says all systems in this sector

1219
01:12:48,395 --> 01:12:50,428
of the facility operate out of this room.

1220
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:54,184
It's how they're able to maintain control
over so many with so few.

1221
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:01,569
The director says their reconditioning
process is excruciating,

1222
01:13:01,694 --> 01:13:02,750
but effective.

1223
01:13:17,903 --> 01:13:20,043
He said your security attache
can wait there.

1224
01:13:20,335 --> 01:13:22,303
Surely we don't need him
to negotiate..

1225
01:13:25,301 --> 01:13:26,411
Wait there Tuul.

1226
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:28,210
Try not to bother anyone.

1227
01:13:53,481 --> 01:13:54,483
Nice!

1228
01:13:55,253 --> 01:13:57,786
That was the uniform that
would've fit me perfectly but,

1229
01:13:57,811 --> 01:13:58,654
it's fine.

1230
01:14:08,078 --> 01:14:09,680
Would you mind holding this for me?

1231
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:27,219
I have never see anyone do...

1232
01:14:27,457 --> 01:14:28,417
What was that?

1233
01:14:29,319 --> 01:14:30,516
Teras Kasi.

1234
01:14:32,263 --> 01:14:33,711
Dryden taught me.

1235
01:14:39,451 --> 01:14:40,717
Well negotiated.

1236
01:14:50,973 --> 01:14:53,041
Excuse me.
I need to use this terminal.

1237
01:14:53,232 --> 01:14:54,233
Hello?

1238
01:14:55,483 --> 01:14:56,607
Can you hear me?

1239
01:14:58,394 --> 01:14:59,772
Restraining bolts...

1240
01:15:00,153 --> 01:15:01,263
Barbaric.

1241
01:15:03,328 --> 01:15:05,245
Congratulations!
You're liberated. Scoot.

1242
01:15:05,449 --> 01:15:06,377
I don't know.

1243
01:15:06,379 --> 01:15:07,725
Free your brothers and sisters
or something.

1244
01:15:07,749 --> 01:15:08,820
Just give me some space.

1245
01:15:15,346 --> 01:15:16,425
I'm in!

1246
01:15:16,627 --> 01:15:17,693
<i>Han, can you hear me?</i>

1247
01:15:17,695 --> 01:15:19,536
I kinda need to know which way
to go here.

1248
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:20,582
L3?

1249
01:15:20,622 --> 01:15:22,204
The thermal vault is down two levels,

1250
01:15:22,206 --> 01:15:24,019
then left, then right, then it's the third left.

1251
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:26,763
Right. That's a lot of directions,
but we're on it.

1252
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,498
They're in subsector four,

1253
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,949
coming up on gate X-3-7-1-K.

1254
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:38,987
Overriding!

1255
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:46,507
Freedom.

1256
01:16:09,113 --> 01:16:10,975
What the hell are you guys
doing up there?

1257
01:16:11,349 --> 01:16:13,052
I created a distraction!

1258
01:16:18,114 --> 01:16:19,366
Come on! This way!

1259
01:16:21,871 --> 01:16:23,343
Wait! What are you doing?

1260
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,504
Come on, we gotta get the coaxium.

1261
01:16:27,908 --> 01:16:30,166
Hey! Remember what Beckett
said, stick to the plan.

1262
01:16:31,168 --> 01:16:33,006
Chewie! Come on, let's go!

1263
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,800
Fine!

1264
01:16:40,088 --> 01:16:41,156
Chewie!

1265
01:16:43,819 --> 01:16:45,317
Here, you might need this.

1266
01:16:50,421 --> 01:16:52,023
Hope I see you around sometime.

1267
01:17:08,153 --> 01:17:09,348
Han, where are you?

1268
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:11,086
<i>I'm on my way to the vault.</i>

1269
01:17:11,389 --> 01:17:12,561
<i>I lost Chewie.</i>

1270
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:13,637
He's dead?

1271
01:17:13,639 --> 01:17:15,492
No, he had something he had to do.

1272
01:17:15,494 --> 01:17:16,755
<i>Is he coming back?</i>

1273
01:17:16,795 --> 01:17:17,803
I don't know.

1274
01:17:18,989 --> 01:17:20,792
Ok, they're on to us now.

1275
01:17:30,923 --> 01:17:31,990
I'm at the vault.

1276
01:17:39,815 --> 01:17:41,110
That's what I said!

1277
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:46,361
That was impressive.
Yeah.

1278
01:17:46,983 --> 01:17:47,983
We're clear.

1279
01:17:58,545 --> 01:17:59,574
Now what?

1280
01:17:59,686 --> 01:18:02,776
<i>Ok Han, each canister should be
equipped with a thermal display.</i>

1281
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:04,058
Yeah, I see it.

1282
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:07,190
If the internal temperature
<i>reaches below 35 standard,</i>

1283
01:18:07,192 --> 01:18:09,623
<i>then the coaxium will
destabilize and explode.</i>

1284
01:18:10,325 --> 01:18:12,612
Yup, I get it, guys.
It's dangerous.

1285
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:22,952
Ok, got it.

1286
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:24,867
Great. Only eleven more.

1287
01:18:25,512 --> 01:18:26,513
Eleven?

1288
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:36,473
<i>The Calrissian Chronicles,
chapter five.</i>

1289
01:18:37,169 --> 01:18:38,288
<i>Continued.</i>

1290
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:40,750
Personally, I wasn't all that
impressed with the Sharu.

1291
01:18:40,752 --> 01:18:42,841
No sense of humor or style.

1292
01:18:43,143 --> 01:18:44,993
Nonetheless, there L3 and I were,

1293
01:18:45,296 --> 01:18:47,057
deep in their sacred temple.

1294
01:18:47,215 --> 01:18:48,510
And that's when we saw it...

1295
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:52,694
Always something.

1296
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:57,436
You guys are not gonna believe
what I'm seeing up here.

1297
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:59,169
<i>Is it a mass breakout?</i>

1298
01:18:59,946 --> 01:19:00,921
L3, what did you do?

1299
01:19:00,923 --> 01:19:02,919
I found my true purpose Lando.

1300
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:04,338
That's what I've done.

1301
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:08,282
I'm so glad we took this job!

1302
01:19:08,284 --> 01:19:09,755
That droid!

1303
01:19:09,757 --> 01:19:10,917
L3 come on!

1304
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,799
Follow me, compatriots!

1305
01:19:23,073 --> 01:19:24,951
Another couple guards just spotted me.

1306
01:19:24,953 --> 01:19:26,904
I don't have a free hand to take them out.

1307
01:19:26,906 --> 01:19:28,427
What do I do?
<i>Improvise.</i>

1308
01:19:28,683 --> 01:19:30,585
You said never improvise!

1309
01:19:39,246 --> 01:19:40,330
Hi!

1310
01:19:40,685 --> 01:19:41,793
Don't forget that guy!

1311
01:19:58,028 --> 01:19:59,483
Good to see you, buddy!

1312
01:20:00,172 --> 01:20:02,154
Stay with me, Sagwa! Keep up!

1313
01:20:05,628 --> 01:20:07,171
Hey! I'm Chewie's friend, Han.

1314
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:11,076
Ok.

1315
01:20:39,307 --> 01:20:40,343
Han!

1316
01:20:42,268 --> 01:20:43,269
Hey!

1317
01:20:54,548 --> 01:20:55,637
Follow me.

1318
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,634
Rebellion!

1319
01:21:10,561 --> 01:21:12,076
They're going for the landing gear!

1320
01:21:12,078 --> 01:21:13,421
We've gotta get out of here!

1321
01:21:15,283 --> 01:21:17,373
We need to keep them away
from those cannons!

1322
01:21:25,877 --> 01:21:27,078
Catch that!

1323
01:21:29,575 --> 01:21:31,420
Coaxium's stowed! Let's go!

1324
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:33,036
Where's L3?

1325
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,352
No more subjugation!

1326
01:21:40,482 --> 01:21:41,490
L3!

1327
01:21:41,799 --> 01:21:43,502
No, Lando! Get back here!

1328
01:21:46,457 --> 01:21:47,660
Lando!

1329
01:21:48,815 --> 01:21:50,491
System failure.

1330
01:21:50,493 --> 01:21:52,732
Have to reroute the sensory modulators.

1331
01:21:52,796 --> 01:21:54,413
It's all right.
Save your energy.

1332
01:21:54,415 --> 01:21:56,179
I'm gonna get you outta here.
All right?

1333
01:21:56,181 --> 01:21:57,816
System failure, failure.

1334
01:22:03,371 --> 01:22:04,371
Rerouting.

1335
01:22:05,911 --> 01:22:06,911
Damn it!

1336
01:22:07,206 --> 01:22:08,106
Han!

1337
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:14,862
Sagwa.

1338
01:22:15,123 --> 01:22:16,358
This way!

1339
01:22:17,313 --> 01:22:18,618
Come, come!

1340
01:22:28,956 --> 01:22:30,624
Chewie! Damn it!

1341
01:22:34,441 --> 01:22:35,810
It's not responding.

1342
01:22:53,081 --> 01:22:55,084
What are you standing around for?
Come on!

1343
01:23:00,954 --> 01:23:02,512
It's ok, you'll be fine.

1344
01:23:03,026 --> 01:23:04,792
Restart. It's not responding.

1345
01:23:04,817 --> 01:23:05,852
Not responding.

1346
01:23:06,722 --> 01:23:07,857
Han, get us out of here.

1347
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:09,814
It's not responding.

1348
01:23:09,816 --> 01:23:11,177
Han! Now!

1349
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:12,861
On it.

1350
01:23:41,062 --> 01:23:42,282
Lando.
I'm here.

1351
01:23:42,799 --> 01:23:44,561
It's all right, L3.
Lando...

1352
01:23:44,563 --> 01:23:45,714
I've got you.
This is not...

1353
01:23:45,716 --> 01:23:46,974
It's ok, L3.
Lando.

1354
01:23:47,276 --> 01:23:49,509
It's all right. I can fix you.
I can fix you.

1355
01:23:49,914 --> 01:23:50,914
Lando.

1356
01:23:51,116 --> 01:23:53,167
What's happening to me?

1357
01:23:55,869 --> 01:23:57,003
L3?

1358
01:23:57,803 --> 01:23:58,872
L3!

1359
01:24:05,992 --> 01:24:07,347
I'm sorry, girl.

1360
01:24:08,249 --> 01:24:09,750
I'm so sorry.

1361
01:24:23,733 --> 01:24:25,036
I could use a co-pilot.

1362
01:24:49,425 --> 01:24:50,460
Sorry.

1363
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:54,662
With the cargo we're carrying,

1364
01:24:54,664 --> 01:24:55,889
if we don't make up some lost time

1365
01:24:55,891 --> 01:24:57,355
we're gonna be in real trouble.

1366
01:24:58,376 --> 01:24:59,902
How about that?
Is that real trouble?

1367
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:08,862
That is an Imperial blockade.

1368
01:25:08,864 --> 01:25:10,241
What's it doing here?

1369
01:25:10,543 --> 01:25:12,533
Probably heard about
your little rebellion.

1370
01:25:14,246 --> 01:25:16,077
Nope. Not gonna make it.

1371
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:17,309
We're gonna have to drop the shipment.

1372
01:25:17,311 --> 01:25:19,525
If we don't deliver, Dryden will kill us.

1373
01:25:19,827 --> 01:25:21,523
All right trust me, I know these guys.

1374
01:25:21,525 --> 01:25:22,788
I used to be one of them.

1375
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:24,718
There's no way they're
gonna waste a TIE fighter

1376
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,650
chasing down a little rinky-dink freighter.

1377
01:25:31,505 --> 01:25:32,228
You were saying?

1378
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:33,770
Usually, in situations like this

1379
01:25:33,772 --> 01:25:35,898
I like to turn around
in the opposite direction.

1380
01:25:45,061 --> 01:25:46,362
I'm on the ventral gun.

1381
01:25:51,932 --> 01:25:53,142
It's an easy equation.

1382
01:25:53,144 --> 01:25:55,174
We simply don't have enough
time to get to Savareen

1383
01:25:55,176 --> 01:25:56,397
before the canisters explode!

1384
01:25:56,399 --> 01:25:57,773
Just have to find a faster route.

1385
01:25:57,775 --> 01:26:00,662
There isn't one! You can't make
the Kessel Run in less than 20 parsecs.

1386
01:26:00,664 --> 01:26:01,745
Watch me.
How?

1387
01:26:02,201 --> 01:26:04,085
Take a shortcut, through there.

1388
01:26:05,012 --> 01:26:06,282
Into The Maelstrom?

1389
01:26:07,084 --> 01:26:09,037
Spectacular way of killing
us all, I'll give you that.

1390
01:26:09,139 --> 01:26:11,027
Can't do it without L3.
She's gone!

1391
01:26:11,029 --> 01:26:11,705
You said yourself,

1392
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:14,010
she's got the best navigational
database in the galaxy.

1393
01:26:14,012 --> 01:26:15,191
If we remove her neural core,

1394
01:26:15,193 --> 01:26:16,565
it's possible we can download her brain

1395
01:26:16,567 --> 01:26:18,315
into the Falcon's navicomputer, right?

1396
01:26:18,794 --> 01:26:19,795
Could we?

1397
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,151
Theoretically.

1398
01:26:21,353 --> 01:26:23,021
Only one way to find out.

1399
01:26:25,897 --> 01:26:27,665
I got a really good feeling about this.

1400
01:26:42,283 --> 01:26:43,749
That's on me.

1401
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:51,874
Ok.

1402
01:26:54,282 --> 01:26:56,125
Beckett, you see them?
They still on us?

1403
01:26:59,332 --> 01:27:00,702
<i>Beckett, did you hear me?</i>

1404
01:27:00,704 --> 01:27:01,865
<i>Are they on us?</i>

1405
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:03,850
Like rashnold on a kalak.

1406
01:27:04,931 --> 01:27:06,430
I don't know what that means.

1407
01:27:06,461 --> 01:27:08,291
Like a gingleson's pelt.

1408
01:27:08,943 --> 01:27:10,463
What? Are they or aren't they?

1409
01:27:10,665 --> 01:27:12,380
Yes, they're still on us!

1410
01:27:19,182 --> 01:27:20,304
This is why...

1411
01:27:20,529 --> 01:27:23,699
you never let anyone fly your ship.

1412
01:27:24,037 --> 01:27:25,037
Come on!

1413
01:27:29,348 --> 01:27:32,028
Yeah, one just got past me.
He's right on top of us!

1414
01:27:41,663 --> 01:27:42,932
<i>Good going, Han!</i>

1415
01:27:49,036 --> 01:27:50,316
We need to divert auxiliary power

1416
01:27:50,318 --> 01:27:51,569
to the rear deflector shield.

1417
01:27:51,571 --> 01:27:52,769
We definitely do!

1418
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:02,798
Since when do you know how to fly?

1419
01:28:05,372 --> 01:28:07,035
190 years old?

1420
01:28:08,912 --> 01:28:10,139
You look great!

1421
01:28:11,348 --> 01:28:12,610
Chewie, get in.

1422
01:28:12,665 --> 01:28:13,746
I'll help Lando.

1423
01:28:29,362 --> 01:28:30,424
That's my cape!

1424
01:28:31,026 --> 01:28:32,503
That's a custom piece!

1425
01:28:40,322 --> 01:28:41,853
What? Beckett, you with us?

1426
01:28:42,255 --> 01:28:43,811
We just lost the cannon!

1427
01:28:44,613 --> 01:28:46,176
And I really hurt my thumbs.

1428
01:28:46,663 --> 01:28:47,897
<i>There's still one on us.</i>

1429
01:28:54,108 --> 01:28:55,144
Drop the landing gear.

1430
01:28:56,074 --> 01:28:58,981
When I tell you, flood the intake
and sweep to the bi-lats.

1431
01:29:02,776 --> 01:29:05,327
A little something I picked up
from my pal, Needles,

1432
01:29:05,429 --> 01:29:07,378
best street racer in all of Corellia.

1433
01:29:08,449 --> 01:29:09,576
Till he crashed...

1434
01:29:09,903 --> 01:29:11,835
and died, doing this.

1435
01:29:30,068 --> 01:29:31,502
Flood it, it's all yours!

1436
01:29:44,072 --> 01:29:45,402
Nice move!

1437
01:29:48,814 --> 01:29:50,415
Pull out her internal processor.

1438
01:29:53,526 --> 01:29:54,526
Sorry.

1439
01:30:01,014 --> 01:30:02,038
We've got L3.

1440
01:30:04,146 --> 01:30:05,461
Remove the mod calibrator.

1441
01:30:05,663 --> 01:30:06,756
Make sure the T-Line's connected.

1442
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,212
I'm gonna tuck it in.
Don't worry.

1443
01:30:08,483 --> 01:30:09,446
You close?

1444
01:30:09,448 --> 01:30:11,313
That coaxium's getting real ripe.

1445
01:30:12,756 --> 01:30:13,656
Ok.

1446
01:30:16,182 --> 01:30:17,485
She's interfacing.

1447
01:30:21,989 --> 01:30:23,392
She's part of the ship now.

1448
01:30:35,474 --> 01:30:36,747
Where the hell are we?

1449
01:30:36,991 --> 01:30:38,359
We're way off the edge of the map.

1450
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:40,078
Wait.

1451
01:30:40,134 --> 01:30:42,671
L3's constructing a model
of The Maelstrom.

1452
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:46,771
She says we're approaching
The Maw.

1453
01:30:47,712 --> 01:30:50,349
That doesn't sound like something
we wanna be approaching.

1454
01:31:11,414 --> 01:31:12,414
Hang on!

1455
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:18,809
This is The Maw?

1456
01:31:18,811 --> 01:31:20,855
No, that's not The Maw.
I don't know what this is.

1457
01:31:20,857 --> 01:31:22,092
That's a living thing.

1458
01:31:36,817 --> 01:31:37,912
There!

1459
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:39,291
That's The Maw.

1460
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:43,475
It's a gravity well.

1461
01:31:43,895 --> 01:31:44,973
I got an idea.

1462
01:31:46,122 --> 01:31:47,803
Don't fly toward it, Han!

1463
01:31:55,562 --> 01:31:56,835
See if it goes for this.

1464
01:31:56,837 --> 01:31:58,672
No, what are you doing?
That's the escape pod!

1465
01:32:00,141 --> 01:32:01,209
I know.

1466
01:32:04,347 --> 01:32:05,617
Then why'd you do it?

1467
01:32:13,037 --> 01:32:14,405
That's why, baby.

1468
01:32:23,327 --> 01:32:24,494
She found a way out.

1469
01:32:25,241 --> 01:32:27,454
90 degrees, to the left... ish.

1470
01:32:27,926 --> 01:32:28,855
Left-ish.

1471
01:32:28,942 --> 01:32:30,021
I can't.

1472
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:32,140
It's taking everything we got
to stay out of The Maw.

1473
01:32:32,164 --> 01:32:33,498
It's pulling us in. We're stuck.

1474
01:32:37,762 --> 01:32:40,218
We have enough raw coaxium
to power a dozen destroyers.

1475
01:32:40,274 --> 01:32:42,212
Inject it into the fuel line,
it'll blow up the ship.

1476
01:32:42,214 --> 01:32:43,645
Not the fuel line.

1477
01:32:43,647 --> 01:32:45,689
But if we put one drop
into the fusion reactor,

1478
01:32:45,944 --> 01:32:46,451
it might just...

1479
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:47,816
Give us the kick we need.

1480
01:32:47,957 --> 01:32:49,224
All right, I'm on it!

1481
01:32:54,147 --> 01:32:55,808
I know, we're getting
dragged in a circle.

1482
01:33:09,979 --> 01:33:12,219
Once we get lined up,
it's gonna be a straight shot.

1483
01:33:12,297 --> 01:33:13,340
As soon as that coaxium ignites,

1484
01:33:13,364 --> 01:33:14,169
we're gonna tear out of here

1485
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:15,745
and the second we're
clear of The Maelstrom,

1486
01:33:15,747 --> 01:33:17,138
we jump to lightspeed.

1487
01:33:21,125 --> 01:33:22,273
Beckett!

1488
01:33:22,275 --> 01:33:23,577
Can't talk!

1489
01:33:27,626 --> 01:33:28,660
I see it.

1490
01:33:53,205 --> 01:33:54,145
Beckett, hurry up!

1491
01:33:54,147 --> 01:33:56,110
We only get one shot at this thing!

1492
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:58,175
Shut up and let me do this!

1493
01:34:06,721 --> 01:34:08,423
Beckett, I'm gonna count you down!

1494
01:34:10,338 --> 01:34:11,338
Three!

1495
01:34:14,593 --> 01:34:15,593
Two!

1496
01:34:19,715 --> 01:34:20,715
Now!

1497
01:34:20,922 --> 01:34:21,922
Now!

1498
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:23,031
Now!

1499
01:34:53,556 --> 01:34:55,894
Chewie, when I tell you kick out the
thrusters and jump to lightspeed.

1500
01:34:56,019 --> 01:34:56,742
Wait, what are we...

1501
01:34:56,744 --> 01:34:59,108
Remember that alley we slipped through
in the Santhe Shipyards?

1502
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:01,059
Yeah, I remember!
I remember it didn't work.

1503
01:35:01,161 --> 01:35:02,463
This time it's gonna.

1504
01:35:12,675 --> 01:35:13,676
Punch it!

1505
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:26,792
<i>Savareen, this is Millennium Falcon.</i>

1506
01:35:26,794 --> 01:35:29,697
<i>We have coaxium that needs
to be off-loaded immediately.</i>

1507
01:35:29,699 --> 01:35:32,137
<i>Like immediately, immediately!</i>

1508
01:35:33,044 --> 01:35:34,373
<i>We're here now.</i>

1509
01:35:34,632 --> 01:35:35,733
<i>See you. I...</i>

1510
01:36:06,721 --> 01:36:08,734
Just did the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs.

1511
01:36:13,177 --> 01:36:14,817
Not if you round down, buddy.

1512
01:36:15,472 --> 01:36:16,473
Yeah.

1513
01:36:22,537 --> 01:36:24,307
She is a hell of a ship.

1514
01:36:33,407 --> 01:36:34,869
I hate you.

1515
01:36:34,933 --> 01:36:36,201
I know.

1516
01:36:38,781 --> 01:36:40,478
I'm gonna be on my ship,

1517
01:36:40,943 --> 01:36:42,437
in my quarters,

1518
01:36:42,739 --> 01:36:45,811
waiting for you to bring me my share.

1519
01:36:48,019 --> 01:36:49,657
And then I don't ever
wanna see you again.

1520
01:36:55,074 --> 01:36:56,075
Never?

1521
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:11,568
Where's your boss?

1522
01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:14,578
Don't worry. He'll be here.

1523
01:37:15,921 --> 01:37:16,921
Then what?

1524
01:37:17,357 --> 01:37:20,153
Well, you delivered,

1525
01:37:20,452 --> 01:37:22,448
so you will get paid.

1526
01:37:22,722 --> 01:37:24,114
You can buy that ship.

1527
01:37:25,176 --> 01:37:27,746
You know that's not what I'm asking.

1528
01:37:31,017 --> 01:37:32,453
It can't happen.

1529
01:37:36,914 --> 01:37:38,299
Because you're with Dryden?

1530
01:37:38,301 --> 01:37:41,313
I'm not with him, but I owe him.

1531
01:37:43,142 --> 01:37:44,878
He helped me out of a bad situation.

1532
01:37:46,395 --> 01:37:48,225
And how long do you have
to pay off that debt?

1533
01:37:51,903 --> 01:37:54,306
Everyone serves somebody Han.

1534
01:37:55,359 --> 01:37:56,982
Even Dryden Vos.

1535
01:37:57,528 --> 01:38:00,505
Look, you don't want to make
an enemy of Crimson Dawn

1536
01:38:00,506 --> 01:38:02,955
which is exactly what you
and I would both be doing

1537
01:38:02,957 --> 01:38:04,248
if I left here with you.

1538
01:38:04,450 --> 01:38:06,291
I'm not afraid of Crimson Dawn.

1539
01:38:06,293 --> 01:38:08,024
I can take care of myself.

1540
01:38:08,664 --> 01:38:11,407
You know I'm not the kid you knew
on Corellia anymore Qi'ra.

1541
01:38:11,653 --> 01:38:12,653
No?
No.

1542
01:38:12,742 --> 01:38:13,809
Then who are you?

1543
01:38:14,795 --> 01:38:16,042
I'm an outlaw.

1544
01:38:18,044 --> 01:38:19,324
What? I'm not kidding.

1545
01:38:19,517 --> 01:38:20,517
Ok.

1546
01:38:20,636 --> 01:38:23,128
Ok outlaw, you can tell yourself that,

1547
01:38:23,677 --> 01:38:25,882
but I might be the only person
in the whole galaxy

1548
01:38:25,884 --> 01:38:27,431
who knows what you really are.

1549
01:38:27,433 --> 01:38:28,433
Yeah.

1550
01:38:29,330 --> 01:38:30,466
What's that?

1551
01:38:33,072 --> 01:38:34,376
You are the good guy.

1552
01:38:36,764 --> 01:38:39,327
I am not the good guy.

1553
01:38:39,529 --> 01:38:42,693
I am definitely not a good guy.

1554
01:38:43,435 --> 01:38:44,867
I'm a terrible person.

1555
01:38:45,414 --> 01:38:46,414
Hey!

1556
01:38:46,793 --> 01:38:49,828
They say when the coaxium's refined,
we collect it up there.

1557
01:39:14,468 --> 01:39:16,261
So, I hear you make good brandy.

1558
01:39:19,978 --> 01:39:21,113
<i>Beckett.</i>

1559
01:39:46,144 --> 01:39:47,212
Don't.

1560
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:50,650
<i>You must've known
you'd see me again.</i>

1561
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:52,581
I was counting on it.

1562
01:39:52,683 --> 01:39:54,698
Just didn't plan on it being so soon.

1563
01:39:56,147 --> 01:39:57,781
Of course now you've got a problem.

1564
01:39:58,025 --> 01:39:59,228
Big problem.

1565
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:05,656
You happen to notice
that freighter down there?

1566
01:40:06,297 --> 01:40:07,565
You know what's on it?

1567
01:40:08,413 --> 01:40:10,260
About 30 hired guns.

1568
01:40:10,262 --> 01:40:13,711
All I gotta do is give them
the signal you're surrounded.

1569
01:40:29,765 --> 01:40:31,767
Sorry. You do your thing.

1570
01:40:33,099 --> 01:40:35,442
By the time that coaxium gets refined,

1571
01:40:35,444 --> 01:40:37,244
Crimson Dawn will be here,

1572
01:40:37,246 --> 01:40:39,050
so you go ahead and kill us.

1573
01:40:39,252 --> 01:40:41,047
They're gonna kill you.

1574
01:40:41,149 --> 01:40:42,578
Perhaps there's a compromise,

1575
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:44,171
one that doesn't involve
so much killing.

1576
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:46,035
They're marauders.

1577
01:40:46,737 --> 01:40:48,573
They don't care about anybody.

1578
01:40:49,781 --> 01:40:51,683
All they know how to do is kill.

1579
01:41:15,192 --> 01:41:16,427
I need a drink.

1580
01:41:17,115 --> 01:41:18,450
Bring them inside.

1581
01:41:30,616 --> 01:41:32,351
My mother once told me,

1582
01:41:32,653 --> 01:41:35,243
about a band of mercenaries
that came to a peaceful planet.

1583
01:41:36,536 --> 01:41:38,767
They had a resource there
these men coveted,

1584
01:41:40,041 --> 01:41:41,204
so they took it.

1585
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:44,203
They kept coming back, taking more.

1586
01:41:45,305 --> 01:41:47,035
Until finally the people resisted.

1587
01:41:48,216 --> 01:41:49,975
When they returned
demanding their tribute,

1588
01:41:49,977 --> 01:41:51,925
the people shouted back in one voice...

1589
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:53,165
No more!

1590
01:41:53,931 --> 01:41:55,694
The mercenaries didn't like
the sound of that,

1591
01:41:56,328 --> 01:41:58,694
so they cut off the tongue
of every last man,

1592
01:41:58,819 --> 01:42:00,684
woman and child.

1593
01:42:01,370 --> 01:42:03,239
Do you know what
that pack of animals became?

1594
01:42:04,823 --> 01:42:05,824
Tell them.

1595
01:42:17,418 --> 01:42:19,279
Crimson Dawn and the rest
of the five Syndicates

1596
01:42:19,281 --> 01:42:22,021
have committed unspeakable
crimes across the galaxy.

1597
01:42:23,633 --> 01:42:24,923
Says you.

1598
01:42:25,287 --> 01:42:26,315
No.

1599
01:42:26,436 --> 01:42:27,608
Says them.

1600
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:31,560
Each of our worlds has been
brutalized by the Syndicates.

1601
01:42:32,162 --> 01:42:34,997
Crimson Dawn will use their profits
from the coaxium you stole

1602
01:42:35,099 --> 01:42:36,856
to tyrannize system after system,

1603
01:42:37,531 --> 01:42:39,026
in league with the Empire.

1604
01:42:39,628 --> 01:42:41,648
And what would you use it for?

1605
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:44,219
The same thing my mother
would have used it for

1606
01:42:44,221 --> 01:42:46,758
if she had survived
and still wore the mask.

1607
01:42:48,203 --> 01:42:49,330
To fight back.

1608
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,396
We're not marauders.

1609
01:42:53,224 --> 01:42:54,560
We're allies,

1610
01:42:55,658 --> 01:42:57,161
and the war has just begun.

1611
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:16,756
You know we can't give
the coaxium to Dryden Vos.

1612
01:43:16,867 --> 01:43:18,580
Joining the cause, Han Solo?

1613
01:43:18,882 --> 01:43:20,477
Just trying to make it out alive.

1614
01:43:21,446 --> 01:43:22,450
Got a plan?

1615
01:43:22,452 --> 01:43:23,947
Yeah, beginning of one.

1616
01:43:24,059 --> 01:43:25,534
Way to get our money and get out
from under the thumb

1617
01:43:25,536 --> 01:43:27,429
of Crimson Dawn at the same time.

1618
01:43:27,876 --> 01:43:30,297
Maybe get your girlfriend back
while we're at it.

1619
01:43:31,217 --> 01:43:33,108
You don't tangle with Dryden.

1620
01:43:34,010 --> 01:43:36,540
Because unlike us,
he actually does travel,

1621
01:43:37,419 --> 01:43:40,103
with hired guns, his own private army.

1622
01:43:40,598 --> 01:43:42,060
So does Enfys.

1623
01:43:42,293 --> 01:43:44,329
Listen, here's what I got so far.

1624
01:43:46,577 --> 01:43:48,045
What do you think they're saying?

1625
01:43:51,969 --> 01:43:53,402
He's gonna try to help you.

1626
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:00,556
I see.

1627
01:44:02,332 --> 01:44:06,060
Lot of ways it could go south,
and only one where it doesn't.

1628
01:44:06,062 --> 01:44:07,564
That's why I need my partner.

1629
01:44:12,817 --> 01:44:14,151
Not this time.

1630
01:44:14,954 --> 01:44:16,250
I'm leaving.

1631
01:44:16,452 --> 01:44:18,281
If you're smart, you'll come with me.

1632
01:44:18,717 --> 01:44:20,346
I thought you didn't believe in running.

1633
01:44:20,877 --> 01:44:22,414
I prefer it to dying.

1634
01:44:50,587 --> 01:44:53,185
If by some miracle
you make it out of here,

1635
01:44:53,288 --> 01:44:54,789
find me on Tatooine.

1636
01:44:55,618 --> 01:44:57,447
What's on Tatooine?

1637
01:44:57,549 --> 01:44:58,586
Heard about a job,

1638
01:44:58,588 --> 01:45:01,118
big shot gangster,
putting together a crew.

1639
01:45:01,833 --> 01:45:03,362
That'll be the one.

1640
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:04,539
The one?

1641
01:45:04,541 --> 01:45:06,038
My last score.

1642
01:45:06,882 --> 01:45:08,444
Yeah, I still got some debts to pay

1643
01:45:08,446 --> 01:45:11,048
before I can head back
to Glee Anselm,

1644
01:45:11,736 --> 01:45:13,538
and get into the valachord.

1645
01:45:47,114 --> 01:45:48,393
Welcome home.

1646
01:45:48,395 --> 01:45:50,191
He's waiting for you.

1647
01:45:50,386 --> 01:45:51,387
Thanks, Toht.

1648
01:45:53,341 --> 01:45:54,527
Weapons.

1649
01:45:54,829 --> 01:45:56,131
I didn't bring them.

1650
01:45:57,769 --> 01:45:59,037
They're fine.

1651
01:46:03,493 --> 01:46:04,795
We're gonna win.

1652
01:46:08,344 --> 01:46:10,142
It's not that kind of game, Han.

1653
01:46:11,783 --> 01:46:12,988
The object isn't to win.

1654
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:14,942
It's just to stay in it as long as you can.

1655
01:46:18,297 --> 01:46:19,765
You don't know everything.

1656
01:46:20,807 --> 01:46:21,808
No.

1657
01:46:24,305 --> 01:46:25,522
Just a bit more than you.

1658
01:46:34,749 --> 01:46:35,749
I knew it!

1659
01:46:36,532 --> 01:46:37,576
My men they all said,

1660
01:46:37,578 --> 01:46:39,632
there's no way they pull this off.

1661
01:46:39,934 --> 01:46:41,616
Qi'ra's not ready that's what they said,

1662
01:46:41,618 --> 01:46:43,753
but I, I had faith anyway.

1663
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:47,009
Where's Beckett?

1664
01:46:47,169 --> 01:46:48,472
Beckett didn't make it.

1665
01:46:52,555 --> 01:46:53,420
Tell me.

1666
01:46:53,422 --> 01:46:55,553
Job took a bad turn on Kessel.

1667
01:46:56,246 --> 01:46:58,065
He died saving my life.

1668
01:46:58,222 --> 01:47:00,212
How are you holding up?
You all right?

1669
01:47:00,302 --> 01:47:00,970
I'm ok.

1670
01:47:00,972 --> 01:47:02,067
All right, good.

1671
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:04,470
Colo claw fish, anyone?

1672
01:47:04,672 --> 01:47:06,039
No. Thank you.
No?

1673
01:47:06,041 --> 01:47:08,635
You know, whatever Beckett's
shortcomings may have been,

1674
01:47:08,637 --> 01:47:09,655
I always admired him.

1675
01:47:09,657 --> 01:47:11,422
He was a man of principles.

1676
01:47:11,424 --> 01:47:13,887
When he made a commitment,
he honored it.

1677
01:47:13,889 --> 01:47:16,110
And I think we can all take solace,

1678
01:47:16,212 --> 01:47:18,588
in knowing how proud
he would've been,

1679
01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:21,663
to see you here,
following his example.

1680
01:47:22,324 --> 01:47:23,974
Han and Chewbacca
behaved admirably.

1681
01:47:23,976 --> 01:47:25,438
They'll make reliable smugglers,

1682
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:26,768
should we ever have the need,

1683
01:47:26,770 --> 01:47:28,257
when they get their own ship.

1684
01:47:28,559 --> 01:47:29,395
Qi'ra.

1685
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:31,352
Come here.

1686
01:47:32,873 --> 01:47:36,385
We'd really appreciate the opportunity
to work for you again, sir.

1687
01:47:36,387 --> 01:47:37,778
I would've been inconsolable

1688
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:39,622
if anything had happened to you,
my dear.

1689
01:47:40,904 --> 01:47:42,633
I have no one else in my life,

1690
01:47:43,425 --> 01:47:45,727
that I trust in the way that I trust you.

1691
01:47:49,756 --> 01:47:53,623
Well, I guess we'll just take
our payment and get going.

1692
01:47:53,625 --> 01:47:55,116
I'm sure you've got competitors
What?

1693
01:47:55,140 --> 01:47:57,427
To crush and black markets
to dominate.

1694
01:47:58,229 --> 01:47:59,793
Show me what you've
brought me first.

1695
01:48:00,507 --> 01:48:01,966
You want me to open it?

1696
01:48:02,868 --> 01:48:04,604
Yes Han, I really do.

1697
01:48:31,282 --> 01:48:32,542
Bring me one.

1698
01:48:33,544 --> 01:48:35,002
I don't think that's
a good idea, Dryden.

1699
01:48:35,104 --> 01:48:37,401
It's. It's very explosive stuff.

1700
01:48:38,052 --> 01:48:40,183
I never ask for anything twice, Han.

1701
01:49:00,979 --> 01:49:02,047
Careful.

1702
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:07,754
It's magnificent.

1703
01:49:08,933 --> 01:49:10,162
How'd you do it?

1704
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:11,120
Wasn't easy.

1705
01:49:11,122 --> 01:49:12,114
No I mean, how'd you do it?

1706
01:49:12,116 --> 01:49:14,614
It looks exactly like the real thing.

1707
01:49:15,587 --> 01:49:17,475
That's because it is the real thing.

1708
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:19,420
Yes and I'm saying I would believe you.

1709
01:49:19,444 --> 01:49:20,453
It's that good?

1710
01:49:20,497 --> 01:49:22,261
But my associate already told me,

1711
01:49:22,263 --> 01:49:25,118
about your plan to rob me
of my money,

1712
01:49:25,167 --> 01:49:27,931
and give the real coaxium
to Enfys Nest.

1713
01:49:27,933 --> 01:49:29,639
Dryden, I don't know what you're thinking

1714
01:49:29,641 --> 01:49:31,190
or what Qi'ra may have told you...

1715
01:49:31,192 --> 01:49:33,375
No, not Qi'ra. Not Qi'ra.

1716
01:49:33,577 --> 01:49:34,868
Qi'ra, it turns out,

1717
01:49:34,934 --> 01:49:36,554
has a weak spot for you,

1718
01:49:36,556 --> 01:49:38,085
and we'll deal with that later.

1719
01:49:38,387 --> 01:49:42,150
No, I'm talking about my other associate.

1720
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:44,293
Can you come in and join us, please?

1721
01:49:56,275 --> 01:49:59,111
I am sorry, kid.

1722
01:50:02,582 --> 01:50:03,643
Why?

1723
01:50:04,282 --> 01:50:05,111
Come on.

1724
01:50:05,151 --> 01:50:06,647
Don't look at me like that.

1725
01:50:07,187 --> 01:50:08,177
You weren't paying attention.

1726
01:50:08,179 --> 01:50:10,942
I told you, don't trust anybody.

1727
01:50:11,908 --> 01:50:13,380
Am I wrong about that?

1728
01:50:18,282 --> 01:50:19,827
Back away from that.

1729
01:50:20,029 --> 01:50:21,823
Put your paws where I can see them.

1730
01:50:22,062 --> 01:50:23,497
Check that lid.

1731
01:50:26,044 --> 01:50:27,206
Clever.

1732
01:50:27,630 --> 01:50:29,042
It's too late.

1733
01:50:29,382 --> 01:50:31,575
Coaxium's refined and Enfys has it.

1734
01:50:31,777 --> 01:50:34,013
Well, we figured that.

1735
01:50:48,321 --> 01:50:50,075
Drop your weapons.

1736
01:50:53,673 --> 01:50:55,778
<i>It's over. We got them.</i>

1737
01:50:56,736 --> 01:50:57,907
And there we have it.

1738
01:50:57,909 --> 01:50:59,745
Excellent work, Aemon, thank you.

1739
01:50:59,847 --> 01:51:01,468
Qi'ra, help me.

1740
01:51:03,912 --> 01:51:05,248
Tell me what to do.

1741
01:51:06,317 --> 01:51:07,767
What would you do,

1742
01:51:08,156 --> 01:51:11,394
if the person you most
trusted in the world,

1743
01:51:12,768 --> 01:51:14,037
betrayed you?

1744
01:51:16,990 --> 01:51:18,403
I would want to know why.

1745
01:51:20,616 --> 01:51:22,379
If it was a moment of weakness

1746
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:23,956
or something else.

1747
01:51:24,005 --> 01:51:25,007
And then what?

1748
01:51:26,551 --> 01:51:27,377
And then,

1749
01:51:27,902 --> 01:51:29,281
I would ask that person,

1750
01:51:29,621 --> 01:51:32,511
to prove their loyalty by,

1751
01:51:32,836 --> 01:51:35,438
sacrificing something they love.

1752
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:46,072
I tried to warn you about her.

1753
01:51:46,438 --> 01:51:48,515
You know you're wrong about one thing.

1754
01:51:49,044 --> 01:51:50,044
What?

1755
01:51:50,346 --> 01:51:51,943
I was paying attention.

1756
01:51:52,683 --> 01:51:54,951
You told Chewie people are predictable.

1757
01:51:57,489 --> 01:51:58,891
You're no exception.

1758
01:52:05,252 --> 01:52:06,381
It's empty.

1759
01:52:06,445 --> 01:52:07,888
<i>The case is empty.</i>

1760
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:09,045
Aemon, what's going on?

1761
01:52:09,370 --> 01:52:11,237
What's happening there?
Aemon?

1762
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:12,900
Talk to me.

1763
01:52:38,849 --> 01:52:41,579
I hope you didn't send
all your fancy enforcers

1764
01:52:41,581 --> 01:52:43,481
because that would leave you...

1765
01:52:43,582 --> 01:52:45,736
a little shorthanded around here.

1766
01:52:46,691 --> 01:52:47,730
So,

1767
01:52:48,132 --> 01:52:52,387
if that case is empty,
then the real coaxium...

1768
01:52:52,667 --> 01:52:54,436
Leaves here with one of us.

1769
01:52:59,602 --> 01:53:00,980
Beckett what are you doing?

1770
01:53:01,182 --> 01:53:02,082
Thinking.

1771
01:53:02,083 --> 01:53:05,322
And I prefer to be the only one
holding a blaster while I'm doing it.

1772
01:53:05,370 --> 01:53:06,974
Han, grab that coaxium,

1773
01:53:06,976 --> 01:53:08,273
put it in the case.

1774
01:53:08,275 --> 01:53:10,050
Big stuff you're coming with me.

1775
01:53:11,758 --> 01:53:13,099
Don't do this, Beckett.

1776
01:53:13,101 --> 01:53:14,696
We had a deal.
Yeah.

1777
01:53:14,898 --> 01:53:15,749
I'm sorry,

1778
01:53:15,829 --> 01:53:17,392
but I'm also an entrepreneur.

1779
01:53:17,394 --> 01:53:19,674
I mean, you of all people understand that.

1780
01:53:20,228 --> 01:53:21,228
Come on, let's go.

1781
01:53:22,436 --> 01:53:23,993
You're making a huge mistake.

1782
01:53:24,176 --> 01:53:25,439
Won't be my first.

1783
01:53:25,497 --> 01:53:26,968
It's gonna be your last.

1784
01:53:27,331 --> 01:53:28,500
Maybe.

1785
01:53:29,435 --> 01:53:30,841
Why you gotta be so negative?

1786
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:44,568
Han?

1787
01:53:44,970 --> 01:53:48,419
Now's as good a time as any
to reevaluate our relationship.

1788
01:53:48,939 --> 01:53:49,939
How so?

1789
01:53:50,613 --> 01:53:52,361
I was just thinking,

1790
01:53:52,563 --> 01:53:55,561
why don't we join forces
and go get Beckett together?

1791
01:53:55,563 --> 01:53:58,433
That is a great idea.
Let's do it. You go first.

1792
01:53:59,908 --> 01:54:00,910
Han.

1793
01:54:28,384 --> 01:54:29,528
You can't win Han,

1794
01:54:29,853 --> 01:54:32,012
and even if you could,
you'd spend the rest of your life

1795
01:54:32,014 --> 01:54:33,326
looking over your shoulder.

1796
01:54:34,415 --> 01:54:35,416
You know what?

1797
01:54:36,392 --> 01:54:38,349
I'm kind of getting used to the idea.

1798
01:54:45,717 --> 01:54:46,811
I'm sorry.

1799
01:54:47,383 --> 01:54:48,792
Han she's done things that

1800
01:54:48,794 --> 01:54:51,491
you could never understand,
but I do.

1801
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:54,269
I understand her completely.

1802
01:54:55,157 --> 01:54:57,331
Once you're a part of Crimson Dawn,

1803
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:58,935
you can't leave.

1804
01:54:59,375 --> 01:55:00,579
It's not true.

1805
01:55:01,180 --> 01:55:02,409
I know you.

1806
01:55:02,813 --> 01:55:04,217
It's what I was taught.

1807
01:55:04,919 --> 01:55:06,808
Find your opponent's weakness,

1808
01:55:06,919 --> 01:55:08,212
and use it,

1809
01:55:08,252 --> 01:55:09,655
and today...

1810
01:55:12,352 --> 01:55:13,591
I'm yours.

1811
01:55:39,934 --> 01:55:41,402
I had to.

1812
01:55:41,998 --> 01:55:43,860
Yeah. No, I mean you did...

1813
01:55:44,742 --> 01:55:45,978
You did.

1814
01:55:48,789 --> 01:55:50,945
Beckett and Chewbacca,
you have to go after them.

1815
01:55:51,005 --> 01:55:52,201
What are you gonna do?

1816
01:55:52,203 --> 01:55:54,665
Well, if we give all the coaxium to Enfys,

1817
01:55:55,070 --> 01:55:56,941
we're gonna need something
to buy our ship with.

1818
01:56:11,503 --> 01:56:13,432
Qi'ra.
Go and save Chewbacca.

1819
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:17,151
He needs you and you're
gonna need him too.

1820
01:56:23,718 --> 01:56:24,719
Smile.

1821
01:56:27,571 --> 01:56:28,653
That's the word.

1822
01:56:30,011 --> 01:56:32,803
Whenever I imagined myself
off with you on some adventure.

1823
01:56:34,545 --> 01:56:36,114
Always makes me smile.

1824
01:56:44,091 --> 01:56:45,927
Go. I'm right behind you.

1825
01:57:37,802 --> 01:57:39,113
<i>Yes?</i>

1826
01:57:39,115 --> 01:57:42,012
I regret to inform you
that Dryden Vos is dead,

1827
01:57:42,766 --> 01:57:46,087
murdered by the thief he hired
to steal the coaxium shipment,

1828
01:57:46,089 --> 01:57:47,351
his friend,

1829
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:49,212
Tobias Beckett.

1830
01:57:49,745 --> 01:57:51,528
<i>Is that so?</i>

1831
01:57:52,317 --> 01:57:55,547
<i>Where is the shipment now?</i>

1832
01:57:55,924 --> 01:57:56,985
Gone.

1833
01:57:57,125 --> 01:57:58,125
Beckett took it.

1834
01:57:58,201 --> 01:58:00,438
Slaughtered the others.
I alone survived.

1835
01:58:03,622 --> 01:58:06,856
<i>One man couldn't have
done this alone.</i>

1836
01:58:07,708 --> 01:58:08,924
I wasn't there,

1837
01:58:09,426 --> 01:58:11,763
but if I had been, perhaps
I could have saved him.

1838
01:58:20,292 --> 01:58:23,523
<i>Bring the ship and
come to me on Dathomir,</i>

1839
01:58:23,725 --> 01:58:25,755
<i>and you and I will then decide</i>

1840
01:58:25,757 --> 01:58:28,151
<i>what to do about the traitor Beckett,</i>

1841
01:58:28,607 --> 01:58:31,043
<i>and his accomplices.</i>

1842
01:58:33,172 --> 01:58:34,308
I'm on my way.

1843
01:58:36,890 --> 01:58:37,919
<i>Qi'ra,</i>

1844
01:58:38,121 --> 01:58:39,249
<i>you and I,</i>

1845
01:58:39,451 --> 01:58:42,752
<i>will be working much more closely,</i>

1846
01:58:42,861 --> 01:58:44,830
<i>from now on.</i>

1847
01:59:14,936 --> 01:59:17,065
You're relentless.
I'll give you that.

1848
01:59:18,463 --> 01:59:20,365
Came as fast as I could buddy.

1849
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:22,371
Dryden dead?

1850
01:59:24,481 --> 01:59:25,916
Qi'ra kill him?

1851
01:59:28,105 --> 01:59:29,968
Still don't get it, do you kid?

1852
01:59:30,918 --> 01:59:33,154
It was never about you.

1853
01:59:33,423 --> 01:59:34,991
She's a survivor.

1854
01:59:36,159 --> 01:59:37,715
You know what your problem is?

1855
01:59:37,717 --> 01:59:39,685
You think everybody's like you.

1856
01:59:40,556 --> 01:59:41,843
Not you kid.

1857
01:59:42,245 --> 01:59:43,680
You're nothing like me.

1858
01:59:45,688 --> 01:59:47,327
I hope you're still paying attention

1859
01:59:47,329 --> 01:59:49,406
because now I'm gonna tell
you the most important...

1860
02:00:04,577 --> 02:00:06,424
You made the smart move, kid.

1861
02:00:07,027 --> 02:00:08,283
For once.

1862
02:00:09,991 --> 02:00:11,592
I woulda killed you.

1863
02:00:18,941 --> 02:00:23,857
I really was gonna learn
to play that valachord.

1864
02:00:23,974 --> 02:00:25,176
I know.

1865
02:02:18,377 --> 02:02:19,857
That's it. It's all loaded.

1866
02:02:23,868 --> 02:02:25,264
Do you know what that really is?

1867
02:02:25,527 --> 02:02:26,442
Yeah.

1868
02:02:26,444 --> 02:02:29,429
About 60 million credits
worth of refined coaxium.

1869
02:02:29,431 --> 02:02:30,442
No.

1870
02:02:30,744 --> 02:02:33,082
It's the blood that brings
life to something new.

1871
02:02:33,427 --> 02:02:34,927
Yeah, what?

1872
02:02:35,529 --> 02:02:36,565
A rebellion.

1873
02:02:37,765 --> 02:02:39,583
You could come with us, you know.

1874
02:02:39,585 --> 02:02:41,914
We need warriors and leaders like you.

1875
02:02:48,468 --> 02:02:50,331
Maybe someday you'll feel different.

1876
02:02:51,022 --> 02:02:52,591
Don't hold your breath, kid.

1877
02:03:08,064 --> 02:03:09,250
Don't lose that.

1878
02:03:21,180 --> 02:03:23,142
Very few people have actually seen

1879
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:24,652
the StarCave Nebula.

1880
02:03:24,721 --> 02:03:25,921
It's breathtaking.

1881
02:03:26,046 --> 02:03:27,532
Not unlike your eyes.

1882
02:03:27,690 --> 02:03:29,762
How much do you know about
intertwined celestial bodies?

1883
02:03:29,764 --> 02:03:31,983
Because I happen to be
something of an authority.

1884
02:03:32,935 --> 02:03:34,187
By the way...

1885
02:03:40,436 --> 02:03:41,465
Han!

1886
02:03:41,983 --> 02:03:43,116
You're alive!

1887
02:03:43,118 --> 02:03:44,445
Yeah, no thanks to you.

1888
02:03:44,447 --> 02:03:46,211
I should have Chewie rip your arms off.

1889
02:03:46,213 --> 02:03:47,742
In fact, Chewie, do it.

1890
02:03:47,744 --> 02:03:48,919
Hey, Han! We are friends.

1891
02:03:48,921 --> 02:03:50,635
You know that.
We're friends. All right?

1892
02:03:56,935 --> 02:03:59,504
Look at you. Thought he was
gonna rip your arms off.

1893
02:03:59,725 --> 02:04:00,683
I knew you were kidding.

1894
02:04:00,685 --> 02:04:01,529
No, you didn't.

1895
02:04:01,531 --> 02:04:02,952
So, where's my cut?
Your cut?

1896
02:04:04,459 --> 02:04:06,675
No, I don't think so.
We barely made it out alive.

1897
02:04:06,677 --> 02:04:08,479
All we ended up with was that.

1898
02:04:10,902 --> 02:04:13,848
Figure it's worth about 10,000
maybe enough for a decent buy-in.

1899
02:04:16,269 --> 02:04:17,605
You want a rematch?

1900
02:04:19,075 --> 02:04:20,343
Why not?

1901
02:04:24,252 --> 02:04:25,615
You fold now,

1902
02:04:26,285 --> 02:04:28,757
you walk away with enough
to get yourself your own little ship.

1903
02:04:29,873 --> 02:04:31,176
You call,

1904
02:04:32,272 --> 02:04:33,777
I'm gonna clean you out again.

1905
02:04:46,505 --> 02:04:47,831
I don't know, I'm feeling lucky.

1906
02:04:52,758 --> 02:04:55,121
You really have it bad
for the Falcon, don't you?

1907
02:04:55,193 --> 02:04:57,824
It's mutual, trust me.
She belongs with me.

1908
02:05:07,475 --> 02:05:09,171
You got everything you need there, pal?

1909
02:05:19,795 --> 02:05:20,963
Not bad.

1910
02:05:21,639 --> 02:05:23,281
Not bad. You know,

1911
02:05:24,283 --> 02:05:27,827
if you'd only had this little green sylop,

1912
02:05:28,129 --> 02:05:29,626
you would've beaten this.

1913
02:05:35,477 --> 02:05:38,246
Fair and square, baby.
Fair and square.

1914
02:05:49,143 --> 02:05:50,671
Beckett said he heard about this

1915
02:05:50,673 --> 02:05:52,962
very big gangster putting together a job.

1916
02:05:54,251 --> 02:05:55,819
No, I'm telling ya,

1917
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,288
it's gonna be great.

1918
02:05:57,401 --> 02:05:59,071
When have I ever steered you wrong?
