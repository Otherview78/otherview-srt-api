1
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,728
Boys, let's go.

2
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,147
Come on, tighten up.

3
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,901
Single file, gentlemen.

4
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,778
Center of the hall.

5
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,530
- Come on, tighten it up.
<i>- Condition unit one!</i>

6
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,156
Condition unit one, copy that.

7
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,742
On the ground. Show me hands, let's go.

8
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,035
Hands!

9
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,746
<i>Code blue! Fight in progress!</i>

10
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,647
Come on, let's fight, man! Let him go!

11
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,567
At least let me get my shoes.

12
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,165
Mary Anne.

13
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,333
Hello.

14
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,460
Thank you.

15
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,131
Adonis got into a fight today,

16
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,674
and he's in holding.

17
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,719
If you wanna see him,
we're gonna have to go up there.

18
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,305
He's a good kid, he just--

19
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,223
Fights.

20
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,101
All the time.

21
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,696
- Johnson?
- Yeah.

22
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,281
- Right this way.
- Thanks.

23
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,547
<i>Johnson, got a visitor.</i>

24
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,053
Adonis.

25
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,018
Come on in.

26
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,605
I'd like you to meet Mrs--

27
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,857
Uh...

28
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,777
Could we have a moment, please?

29
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,571
Sure.

30
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,657
I'll be right outside.

31
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,753
Why were you fighting?

32
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,924
I'm not going to another group home.

33
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,052
I'm not from a group home.

34
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,722
You a social worker?

35
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,348
No.

36
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,476
I am not a social worker.

37
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,569
Nigga said something
about my ma so I beat his ass.

38
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,906
I'm sorry about your mother.

39
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,578
I know what it's like to lose someone.

40
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,459
When your father died,
I was angry for so long.

41
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,004
<i>I hurt myself, pushed family away.</i>

42
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,714
I don't have no father.

43
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,841
What did you say?

44
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,051
I said I don't have no father.

45
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,095
<i>That's not true.</i>

46
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,185
He passed before you were born,
but you had a father.

47
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,355
You knew him?

48
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,819
He was my husband.

49
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:44,326
Adonis, I would like it very much
if you would come and stay with me.

50
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,457
<i>Do you think you'd wanna do that?</i>

51
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,679
What was his name?

52
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:34,679

53
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,311
Hey, James.

54
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,397
Don, sit down.

55
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,903
What you got there?

56
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,285
You're joking, right?

57
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,329
You get a promotion and you're quitting?

58
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,291
Look, this career just ain't for me.

59
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,085
What are you gonna do?

60
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,090
Hey, man, thanks for everything.

61
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,026
<i>Just wanna
talk to you about my job.</i>

62
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,778
- You see your new office?
- <i>Hmm.</i>

63
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,114
<i>Yeah. But, um...</i>

64
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,949
Well, what's it like?

65
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,618
This is a big deal, this promotion.

66
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,538
Did they hire your assistant?

67
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,501
Thank you.

68
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,296
Very proud of you.

69
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,856
<i>Superfight Two
with Rocky Balboa, the challenger</i>

70
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,984
<i>and, of course, Apollo Creed,
the world champion.</i>

71
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,444
<i>And there's the bell.</i>

72
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,737
<i>Comes over in a hurry now.</i>

73
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,739
<i>He throws a couple of
rights and lefts out there.</i>

74
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,824
<i>He starts to take command early here</i>

75
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,994
<i>and now he kinda moves his feet
along the side of the ring.</i>

76
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,537
<i>A good right hand thrown at him.</i>

77
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,040
<i>Another right and another right
thrown by the champion.</i>

78
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,500
<i>Creed is going for the knockout.</i>

79
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,919
<i>Just holding that right hand
and he's just waiting for that</i>

80
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,170
<i>precise moment that he wants--</i>

81
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,673
<i>There it is! He unloaded that.
But here comes Balboa!</i>

82
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,675
<i>Got him in that corner,
and there's lefts and rights.</i>

83
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,260
<i>Here comes Balboa coming back out.</i>

84
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,678
<i>A left and a right to the head.</i>

85
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,514
<i>But now it is Creed coming back.</i>

86
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,265
<i>Creed with the left hand.</i>

87
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,352
<i>Balboa appears to be getting hit often.</i>

88
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,697
<i>Take it to him. Take it to the body.</i>

89
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,407
There you go!

90
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,785
Make your time count, baby.

91
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,122
You know what's coming up. There you go.

92
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,541
Check it out.

93
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,210
<i>What you doing here, man?</i>

94
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,462
15 and 0, 15 knockouts.

95
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,966
In Tijuana? No, bro.

96
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,801
That's barroom brawling.

97
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,594
Well, I'm all in anyway.

98
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,888
So I figure we start out local,
just to get our momentum going,

99
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,223
then we can move wherever we wanna move.

100
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,891
- "We"?
- I was figuring...

101
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,436
Adonis, these boys come in here,
this how they survive.

102
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,980
They gotta fight for life.

103
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,649
Kill or be killed. People die in there.

104
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,777
Your daddy died in the ring.
This ain't no joke.

105
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,070
I don't know him.

106
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,072
Ain't got nothing to do with me.

107
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,408
- Okay, you real tough now.
- Yup.

108
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,619
Nah, I ain't training you.

109
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,788
You know I ain't training you.
Nobody training you.

110
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,165
I'm gonna make sure about that.

111
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,378
We making champs
in the Delphi Gym!

112
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,673
We not dancing!
We not singing! We fighting!

113
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,342
<i>You struggle every day,
you fight for something.</i>

114
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,677
You damn right!

115
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,264
Hey, listen up!

116
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,600
<i>Adonis.</i>

117
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,477
These the keys to my 'Stang right here.

118
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,812
Adonis, get out the ring!

119
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,522
All you gotta do
is land one clean head shot.

120
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,773
What I gotta put up for it?

121
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,489
Put up your hands. You a pro, right?

122
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,366
No, no, no.

123
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,327
You gonna get the shit knocked out of you.

124
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,245
<i>You ain't gotta prove nothing to me.</i>

125
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,705
<i>Better listen to your family, boy.</i>

126
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,792
Oh, my God.

127
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,961
<i>At least put on your head gear.</i>

128
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,546
- No head gear?
- Mmm-hmm.

129
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,714
It's on you.

130
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,385
Killer, right?

131
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,888
He a killer, right, Lil Duke?

132
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,432
Where were you at when
I was in group homes, huh?

133
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,892
You miss a meal?

134
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,101
<i>Nah!</i>

135
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,561
Which one of your killers in here next?

136
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,813
You pick him! You pick who's next!

137
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,315
I'm next.

138
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,703
<i>Hey, I just need one round, bro.</i>

139
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,497
All right, you wanna warm up?

140
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,540
I don't need no warm-up. Get my stuff.

141
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,338
<i>I see you got
your head gear on. Good job.</i>

142
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,761
Nah.

143
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,519
Don't run.

144
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,215
<i>Told you I'd win, man.</i>

145
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,883
I told you.

146
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,218
<i>I tried to tell you something, bro.</i>

147
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,636
<i>You don't wanna listen.</i>

148
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,305
<i>You don't wanna listen.</i>

149
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,932
You wanna learn things
the hard way, huh?

150
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,738
- Hey.
- Hey.

151
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,698
How you doing?

152
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,199
<i>Doing good.</i>

153
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,077
I just came home, I wanted to talk to you.

154
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,329
Yeah?

155
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,581
I quit my job.

156
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,584
Yeah. No...

157
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,591
Where did you get this? Mexico?

158
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,259
It's not that bad.

159
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,261
"It's not that bad."

160
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,598
I ought to knock you out myself.

161
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,225
You know how many times I had to
carry your father up these stairs

162
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,603
- because he couldn't walk?
- Yes.

163
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,189
How many times I had to wipe his ass
because he couldn't use his hands?

164
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,650
Is that what you want? No.

165
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,236
You want brain damage. Yeah, you do.

166
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,447
You want to be so brain-damaged,
you can't form a sentence.

167
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:25,740
I can get hurt doing anything.

168
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,617
Apollo didn't get hurt, he got killed!

169
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:28,910
People get killed!

170
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,497
I didn't take you in
for you to go backwards.

171
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,457
You're better than this.

172
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,875
I'm leaving soon.

173
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,424
I'm gonna be fighting full-time now.

174
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,885
So I wanted to tell you face-to-face.

175
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,306
You are your father's son

176
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,767
and you're part of him.

177
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,647
But it doesn't mean you have to be him.

178
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,234
I'm gonna call you.

179
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,281
Listen, you want to be
in somebody's ring...

180
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,536
You don't have to call me.

181
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,498
<i>All right, smile!</i>

182
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,083
How you doing?

183
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,795
This was taken from the 10th round
of the first fight, right?

184
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,590
Good call.

185
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,425
How'd you know that?

186
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,554
I heard about a third fight
between you and Apollo,

187
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,431
behind closed doors.

188
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,225
That true?

189
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,101
How'd you hear about that?

190
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:00,937
Who won?

191
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,525
It's kind of a secret.
What'd you say your name was?

192
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,443
Donnie.

193
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,695
The girl said you wanted
to talk about something.

194
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,489
Yeah, I want to talk to you
about training me.

195
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,783
Training you.

196
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,369
I don't do that stuff no more.
Sorry about that.

197
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,079
Listen, it's getting kind of late, kid.

198
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,456
So I'm gonna close up.

199
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:21,791
How good was he?

200
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,628
Who? Apollo? Yeah, he was great.

201
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,130
He's a perfect fighter.
Ain't nobody ever better.

202
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,632
So how'd you beat him?

203
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,883
Time beat him.

204
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,428
Time, you know, takes
everybody out, it's undefeated.

205
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,805
Anyway, I gotta lock up.

206
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,765
When Mickey died, he came
and talked to you, right?

207
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,226
<i>Talked you out of quitting?</i>

208
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,645
<i>Took you to L.A., trained you.</i>

209
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,772
Brought you back.

210
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,488
How do you know all this?

211
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,991
How do you think?

212
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,746
What are you, like a cousin?

213
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:02,915
He's my father.

214
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,794
No, he isn't. I don't believe you.

215
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:07,962
Call Mary Anne.

216
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,338
Mary Anne. His wife.

217
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,673
The house number still works.

218
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,176
Oh, that's right.

219
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,095
You haven't talked to her
since the funeral.

220
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,514
She said you gave a nice speech, though.

221
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,111
Yeah.

222
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,697
Nice speech.

223
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,700
I want you to train me.

224
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,953
All right? I need somebody solid
and who else better to go to?

225
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,164
You at least owe me that.

226
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,003
I can tell the way you talk,
you been to school.

227
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,714
So I figure you got some brains.

228
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,508
Why would you want
to pick a fighter's life

229
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,801
when you don't have to?

230
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,554
If Apollo was around,
he would tell you that, too.

231
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,014
Well, he ain't around.

232
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,808
I been fighting my whole life.
I ain't got a choice.

233
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,686
It's always about a choice.

234
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,480
I was in the ring.

235
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,814
I saw how it went down.

236
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,399
That fight should've been stopped.

237
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,068
I should have stopped it.

238
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,694
Maybe he wanted to go out like a fighter.

239
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,906
Maybe, you did exactly what he wanted.

240
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,285
I think he'd rather be here,
talking with you.

241
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,718
There is a resemblance.

242
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,602
I'm usually here all the time,

243
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,562
so if you're ever in
the neighborhood, come by,

244
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,897
<i>if you need something.</i>

245
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,732
I'll be at Mickey's Gym tomorrow.

246
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,443
I don't go there.
I haven't been there in a long time.

247
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,615
Since we're pretty much like family

248
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,867
who won the third fight?

249
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,872
He did.

250
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,652
<i>In boxing...</i>

251
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,612
<i>fighters' origins can endure</i>

252
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,948
<i>as the most sacred element
of their identity,</i>

253
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,661
<i>shaping choices that can
change their lives forever.</i>

254
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,498
<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan is a faithful son
of Liver pool, England,</i>

255
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,836
<i>a place where people find hope
in the tales of their heroes.</i>

256
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:58,299
<i>But for the undefeated best
pound-for-pound boxer in the world,</i>

257
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,718
<i>the future is filled with uncertainty,</i>

258
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,472
<i>with a seven-year
prison sentence looming.</i>

259
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,767
I didn't plan on spending me
prime years in a prison cell.

260
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,436
<i>I hate letting me family down.</i>

261
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,106
<i>Now what could be his
final bout awaits him at home,</i>

262
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,943
<i>in one of his city's most
hallowed sporting temples.</i>

263
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,031
<i>Here, he'll welcome an opponent
who's also never been beaten</i>

264
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,784
<i>and who's boxed his way
from California streets</i>

265
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,244
<i>to American stardom.</i>

266
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,789
<i>Fighting out of the famed

00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,464
<i>believes he's the sport's future.</i>

270
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,091
Conlan's going away for a long time.

271
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,384
Now it's my turn.

272
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,719
I've never lost.

273
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,138
I've never even been knocked down,
and that's not gonna change.

274
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,392
<i>A champion in a dark
and extraordinary predicament.</i>

275
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,063
<i>A challenger uninterested

276
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,568
<i>This is</i> 24/7: Conlan/Wheeler.

277
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,639
Kick this dude ass.

278
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,147
No respect, man.

279
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,714
I'm Donnie.

280
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,799
Yeah?

281
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,135
And I just moved in upstairs.

282
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,137
Okay. What do you want, Donnie? It's late.

283
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,471
I can hear your music.

284
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,099
Yeah? I didn't know it was that loud.

285
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,267
Well, it is, all right?

286
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,560
I gotta wake up early and work out.

287
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,062
Oh. Oh, got you.

288
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,983
You gotta wake up early
and do your, uh, jawns.

289
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,277
Keep your body tight. Cool.

290
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:24,945
I'll turn my music down.
You won't hear a peep.

291
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,113
Thanks...

292
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,837
<i>Snap it back!</i>

293
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,055
Breathe, Leo, breathe.

294
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,723
Good boy.

295
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,442
Hey.

296
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,070
Can I help you?

297
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,363
Looking to sign up.

298
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,074
- Where you from?
- L.A.

299
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,367
Hollywood!

300
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,077
Which gym? I know all those guys.

301
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,830
Don't have one. I'm more self-taught.

302
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,249
Self-taught?

303
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,918
You know Balboa?

304
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,211
Yes, we grew up together.

305
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,047
<i>Most members just work themselves out.</i>

306
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,799
For an extra $20 a month,

307
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,136
I can give you drills,
check in on you when I can.

308
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,804
Yeah, that works.

309
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,688
Double jab.

310
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,899
<i>Move your head, babe.</i>

311
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,606
<i>Boxing fans have been
waiting years</i>

312
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:48,941
for the Superfight between
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan

313
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,359
and Danny Wheeler.

314
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,487
But we guess the fighters
couldn't wait another 24 hours.

315
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,447
<i>Conlan punched Wheeler</i>

316
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,658
<i>after words were exchanged
during the face-off.</i>

317
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,868
Wheeler suffered a broken jaw

318
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,037
<i>and has already announced plans</i>

319
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,998
<i>to sue Conlan and the WBC.</i>

320
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,382
Hey, Unc!

321
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,717
Unc!

322
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,011
How you doing?

323
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,055
Did you call me "Unc"?

324
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,391
Yeah, it was either that or O.G.

325
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,351
What's an "O.G."?

326
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,353
Old-ass gangster.

327
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,230
"Unc" is good.

328
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,731
I can do that.

329
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,483
It's all good.

330
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,819
So why'd you come by? You hungry?

331
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,737
No, I just wrapped up at the gym.

332
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,072
Figured I'd stop by.

333
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,240
Okay.

334
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,201
Maybe ask you a question.

335
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,745
Sure. I can do all this.

336
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,290
Uh...

337
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,168
What are some drills I can do
to get my hand speed up?

338
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,086
Some guys up there,
I bet they can help you.

339
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,546
There's a guy there named Pete.

340
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,256
He's a pretty good trainer.

341
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:57,176
Yeah, but he's with
his fighter most of the time.

342
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,428
I mostly just train myself.

343
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,098
They know you're a Creed?

344
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,892
I don't go by that.

345
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,102
I'm trying to make it on my own.

346
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,395
Name's Johnson.

347
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,230
- Who's Johnson?
- Mom's name.

348
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,275
Plus, just makes life easier.

349
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,485
Uh-huh.

350
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,242
Plus, you know, if you train me
ain't nobody around here knows me.

351
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,535
We could fly under the radar.

352
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,955
- They'd never know.
- Yeah.

353
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,291
I told you before,

354
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,627
I just don't wanna do it, kid.

355
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,131
That's cool, but maybe you could just

356
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,133
give me some drills.

357
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,136
- Drills?
- Yeah, things I could do on my own.

358
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,933
You don't stop, do you?
You're like a woodpecker.

359
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,768
My God.

360
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,486
All right. I got a few.

361
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,488
But that's it. Okay?

362
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:00,656
Of course.

363
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,743
Five rounds of jumping rope.

364
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,248
Three rounds
on each of the bags...

365
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,125
When you get to the heavy bag,
just don't keep throwing your hands

366
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,752
because you can hurt them.

367
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,588
It's also about using
your legs, all right?

368
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,801
And then five rounds of...

369
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,178
Shadow...

370
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,346
O-W.

371
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,515
- There's a "W." Boxing.
- Boxing, yeah.

372
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,517
And that's it.

373
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,936
- All right?
- Yeah.

374
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,813
Okay, here you go.

375
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,981
Oh, that is perfect.

376
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,774
Good luck with that.

377
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,612
All right, got it. Hold that real quick.

378
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,206
All right, man.

379
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,125
Wait, don't you want this?

380
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,376
I got it right here.

381
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,295
What if you lose that thing or it breaks?

382
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,547
It's already up in the cloud.

383
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,845
What cloud? What cloud?

384
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,890
Hey, Ma, it's me.

385
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,810
I was just calling to let you know
I'm doing good

386
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,729
and I got an apartment.

387
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,356
<i>It ain't much but I'm trying
to make it into something.</i>

388
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,400
<i>I miss you.</i>

389
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,193
<i>I wanna hear from you,</i>

390
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,863
so call me back when
you get a chance. All right.

391
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,760
What, it's too loud?

392
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,430
No, I just heard you down here working.

393
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,682
Figured you'd wanna take a break.

394
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,559
Maybe get some food?

395
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:53,852
Where you from, Donnie?

396
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,270
I'm from L.A.

397
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,773
So is this how y'all
ask females out in L.A.?

398
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,067
Just wanted to know if you were hungry.

399
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,276
Not a date.

400
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,444
Right.

401
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,074
You know what? It's all good.

402
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,950
It's okay.

403
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,786
Hey, yo.

404
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,954
I am hungry.

405
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,421
I only have an hour.
Do you know where you wanna go?

406
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,465
I was hoping you could tell me.

407
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:24,883
You're from Philly, right?

408
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,971
Okay.

409
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,561
Good luck, man.

410
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,326
So where are we?

411
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:52,828
North Philly.

412
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,162
So this is Max's.

413
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,790
Hey, superstar! What's going on?

414
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,333
I'm well, thanks. How you doing?

415
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,918
<i>You looking wonderful as always.</i>

416
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,336
Thank you.

417
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,796
<i>How you doing there, my friend?</i>

418
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:05,090
This my neighbor and
he's a West Coast boy.

419
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,341
Ain't never had a steak before.

420
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,343
Listen, I'm gonna treat him
like he was my neighbor.

421
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,095
<i>That's how good we gonna take care of you.</i>

422
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,638
<i>- You like pickles?</i>
<i>- Nah.</i>

423
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:12,848
<i>Okay, mayonnaise.</i>

424
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,308
Put extra peppers
on that jawn, both kinds.

425
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,310
<i>Ketchup, extra cheese.</i>

426
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,479
- How much I owe you?
<i>- $9.95.</i>

427
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,022
No, let me get these.

428
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,191
That's cool. I asked you out, right?

429
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,527
You said it wasn't a date, though.

430
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,112
It's not.

431
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,114
Where we eating at?

432
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,407
Right there.

433
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,742
<i>So I heard you back there,
"jawn" this, "jawn" that.</i>

434
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:33,910
<i>What's a "jawn"?</i>

435
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,537
It's a noun.

436
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,123
See, these is jawns.

437
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,292
This is a jawn.

438
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,377
This restaurant we're sitting
in is a jawn. You're a jawn.

439
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,129
You got a jawn?

440
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,422
Like, a dude?

441
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,798
No.

442
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,468
I got too much going on right now.

443
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,802
Shows and stuff?

444
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,220
Yeah.

445
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,389
I'm opening at
Electric Factory next month.

446
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:55,557
What's that?

447
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,017
It's a big venue out here.

448
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,560
A lot of people got their start.

449
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,395
Jill, Legend, the Roots.

450
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,856
That's wassup.

451
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,487
- Can I ask you something personal?
- <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

452
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,076
I got progressive hearing loss.

453
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,330
<i>Just started wearing these this past year.</i>

454
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,082
But I only need them in places
with a lot of background noise.

455
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,250
For now.

456
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,921
So it's progressive, so eventually...

457
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,589
Yeah.

458
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,509
<i>Yeah.</i>

459
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,177
I'm just getting ready for it.

460
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,013
Like I'm getting used to these,
I'm learning sign language and stuff.

461
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,852
But I really can only
remember bad words.

462
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,188
Ones that aren't that useful like...

463
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,943
The fuck's that?

464
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,696
You can't tell?
This is the bull, the horns, this is--

465
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,616
Yeah, this is bullshit.

466
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,618
- That's your favorite?
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

467
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,121
You don't really seem like a boxer to me.

468
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,581
I mean, you're in shape and all but...

469
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,626
I don't know. Aren't most boxers like...

470
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,545
- Like what?
- Like street.

471
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,630
I'm not saying you're
a square or anything,

472
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,799
but I'm just curious,
what made you wanna fight?

473
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,717
My pop was a fighter.

474
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,803
Oh, right. That makes sense.

475
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,096
Did he fight pro?

476
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,265
Something like that.

477
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,101
Does he train you?

478
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,103
My pop died before I was born.

479
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,817
I'm sorry to hear that.

480
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,988
So what made you wanna sing?

481
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:40,704
Uh...

482
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,998
It makes me feel alive.

483
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,919
Where's your next show?

484
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,673
That place that you saw me at,
Johnny Brenda's.

485
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,927
I got a residency there
so we're back on Friday.

486
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,807
Can I roll with you?

487
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,019
I wanna show up, you know.
Show some love.

488
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,024
Let me think on it.

489
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,673
Okay.

490
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,051
Here we go, Paulie.

491
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,888
Happy birthday, my friend.

492
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,558
I didn't forget ya.

493
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,144
Your favorite.

494
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,813
Miss ya, pal.

495
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,484
Yo, Adrian, my darling.

496
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,363
The best of the best.

497
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,659
I'll tell you, Adrian, God.

498
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,413
It's getting harder to walk up this hill.
What does that mean?

499
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,333
Anyway, it's a good day today.

500
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,710
It's a good day, got no problems.

501
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,337
Bills are paid.

502
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,506
Only thing is, it's tough to

503
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,883
sleep at night sometimes. My back.

504
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,844
No matter what you do,
it catches up to you.

505
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:25,100
Anyway, shall we see
what's new in the world today?

506
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,266
Whoa.

507
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:07,684
Hey, Rocky!

508
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:08,852
Hey, how you doing?

509
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,770
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

510
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,731
Hey, Rock!
Long time no see, brother.

511
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,482
- Still here? Good to see you.
- Yeah.

512
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,985
- Hey, the Italian Stallion's back.
- How you doing?

513
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,778
- It's like a party here with everyone.
- Yeah, right.

514
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,030
- Welcome back, man. It's been a while.
- Yeah, thank you very much.

515
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,240
- How do you feel?
- Good.

516
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,950
- What, are you making a comeback?
- No.

517
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,952
- Hey, champ.
- Hey, Pete. What's up?

518
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,204
- Didn't know you were coming by.
- I didn't either.

519
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,373
I was just in the neighborhood.
You've done nice here.

520
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,500
Place is looking good,
new paint and everything.

521
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,960
- Very good, very nice.
- I do what I can.

522
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,545
- Remember my son, Leo?
- Of course I do.

523
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,005
A lot bigger since you last seen him.

524
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,048
- Yeah, very big.
- Rocky,

525
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,759
he's 17 and 0.

526
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,719
Things are really opening up for us.

527
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,054
Leo! Come.

528
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:49,768
Rocky, option's still open
if you wanna get involved.

529
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,728
Little training, little motivation.

530
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,271
Let me think about it.

531
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,398
- Sure, sure.
- How you doing, kid?

532
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:56,608
It's an honor to meet you, champ.

533
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,485
<i>Nice to meet you, too.
17 and 0, very good.</i>

534
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,570
<i>Yeah, I was supposed to fight
on the Ricky Conlan's card--</i>

535
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,655
- Hey, Unc!
- But it got canceled.

536
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,825
Unc.

537
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,827
- He talking to you?
- Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

538
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,287
- You made it.
- Yeah.

539
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,414
Just walked by. Here I am.

540
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,792
How you know Hollywood?

541
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,252
Uh, we met at the restaurant.

542
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,171
That's it.

543
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,718
Okay, Rock. Okay.

544
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,429
You need anything, you let me know.

545
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,348
Okay. Good luck, kid. Seriously.

546
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:29,516
Thanks.

547
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:33,436
17 and 0. Kid's got a future. Tough.

548
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,522
Can I talk to you a minute?

549
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:46,074
I don't really know what I'm doing here
because I got other plans for my life

550
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,700
and this wasn't part of it.

551
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,410
Your father was special.

552
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,038
Tell you the truth,
I don't know if you're special.

553
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,499
Only you gonna know that
when the time is right.

554
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,167
It ain't gonna come overnight.

555
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,794
You're gonna take a beating,
you're gonna take this,

556
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,754
you're gonna get knocked down,
you're gonna get up

557
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,923
and you're gonna see
if you got the right thing.

558
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,884
But, you gotta work hard.

559
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,303
I swear to God, if you're not gonna do it,

560
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,638
I'm out.

561
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,600
Rock, every punch I've ever
thrown has been on my own.

562
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,103
Nobody showed me how to do this.

563
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,939
I'm ready.

564
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,277
Come on. Let's do this.

565
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,154
Step into my office.

566
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,614
You serious?

567
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,491
I am serious. This is old school.

568
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,243
<i>You should be able to grab
one of these birds.</i>

569
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,411
30 seconds?

570
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,371
Yeah, in your dreams.

571
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,916
Come on! You call that fast?

572
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,010
No! Again.

573
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,636
I thought you were fast.

574
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,680
Come here!

575
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,849
<i>Get them legs moving!</i>

576
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,268
Little harder, little faster!

577
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,646
<i>Keep up the pace! Keep going!</i>

578
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:11,117
Control your tempo then build slowly.

579
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,369
More.

580
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,538
Build, build, build.

581
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:16,706
Go!

582
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,679
That bell don't mean school's out, Donnie.

583
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,931
Keep going.

584
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,600
That bell means hell.

585
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,686
<i>Just go get the chicken.
It's not that big a deal.</i>

586
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,979
Come here! God damn it!

587
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,982
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

588
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,569
That's pretty good.
Chickens are slowing down.

589
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,573
All right. Donnie, get into your stance.

590
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,202
Make a small target, turn sideways. Okay.

591
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,871
You see this guy here staring back at you?

592
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,039
Yeah.

593
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,749
That's your toughest opponent.

594
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:03,461
Every time you get into the ring,
that's who you're going against.

595
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:07,840
I believe that in boxing
and I do believe that in life, okay?

596
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,926
Now throw a jab in the jaw.

597
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,594
All right, one to the gut.

598
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,597
Now, every time you punch this guy,
what's he doing?

599
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,099
- He's throwing one back at me.
- That's right.

600
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:19,852
So either you block it, slip it
or get out of the way. Go.

601
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,901
I'll leave you two alone for a while.

602
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,779
Good luck.

603
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,331
- Hey.
- Yo.

604
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,709
What's up? Is it cool?

605
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,460
<i>Yes.</i>

606
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,337
Smells good in here.

607
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,299
<i>I don't even
know what fighters drink.</i>

608
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,010
Do you drink tea?

609
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,012
Yeah, tea's good. Thank you.

610
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,221
<i>Yeah.</i>

611
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,974
So this is the house.

612
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,559
<i>This is it.</i>

613
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:02,645
What you working on?

614
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:03,980
<i>Uh...</i>

615
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,029
Uh, uh, uh...

616
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,007
- Where the beat go?
- Sorry.

617
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,514
<i>Hey, check you out.</i>

618
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:43,853
Whoo.

619
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,855
Yeah!

620
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,847
<i>One, two, three.</i>

621
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:23,142
<i>I like that. Very good.</i>

622
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,898
Keep that balance going. Way to go.

623
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,859
Donnie, get up. You gotta keep moving.

624
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,363
It's tough but you gotta do it.

625
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,823
You get a "B" in tough.

626
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,699
Kid's looking good, champ!

627
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,702
Yeah, he's getting there.

628
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,998
Hey, Hollywood,
what do you weigh right now?

629
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,293
I don't know, probably like 180.

630
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,420
Why?

631
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,635
Get down to a buck 75,

632
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,387
<i>we'll make something happen,
if you're interested.</i>

633
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:00,638
- Hell, yeah, I'm interested.
- No.

634
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,974
I do the talking, okay?
You do the fighting.

635
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,478
175? That's your boy's weight.
How you doing, Leo?

636
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,188
- What's up, Rock?
- Yeah.

637
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,815
He could use a fight to keep warm.

638
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,441
- Warm?
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

639
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,861
People will come out to see you
in the corner again, champ.

640
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,905
We'll make it like the old days.
Get the whole city there.

641
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,783
- Make a few bucks for everybody.
- No, I understand that.

642
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,994
But I'm just getting
used to this kid right now,

643
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,163
and, you know, he's
getting better every day

644
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,956
but he's gonna take a while.

645
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,166
He's hungry.

646
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,376
You gotta feed him every now and again.
You know that.

647
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,172
Thanks. I appreciate it, chef.
We'll be okay. Thanks.

648
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,340
- Think about it.
- I'll think about it.

649
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,468
Rock, what we training for?

650
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,803
Yeah, what are we training for?

651
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,514
We're training to win, not get killed.
You're not ready yet.

652
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,391
I can lose five pounds.
I can lose five pounds like that.

653
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:46,893
It's nothing, it's easy.

654
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,728
Hit the bag.

655
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,148
Come on.

656
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,484
This kid's like
a tough Philadelphia fighter.

657
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,486
I ain't never even seen you battle before.

658
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,531
Yeah, but I've been watching him,
and I'm pretty sure he'd catch my fade.

659
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,658
- What's a fade?
- I could take him out.

660
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,869
- Oh, okay.
- All right, listen.

661
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,330
Let me make you an offer you can't refuse.

662
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,539
Are you crazy?

663
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,249
No, I'm serious, man.
Look, we take the match.

664
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,668
- Right.
- I got six weeks to get in shape.

665
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,296
Six weeks, I'll do whatever it takes.
At the end of the six weeks,

666
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,632
- you don't think it's right, call it off.
- Really?

667
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,550
Look, this is what
I'm here for, all right?

668
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,385
I'll go 24-7 with this shit.

669
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,971
Matter of fact, we can go
get my stuff right now.

670
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,057
- For what?
- So I can move into your spot.

671
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,559
Start training camp. Old school, remember?

672
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,394
No, no one's been in my house
in a long time

673
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,146
and I don't think
you'd be comfortable there.

674
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,814
What, you walk around naked?

675
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,483
No.

676
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:36,901
We're good then.

677
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:52,375
You better not walk around naked either.

678
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,001
That's for sure.

679
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,013
<i>- Last one?</i>
<i>- Yeah, that's all of it.</i>

680
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,181
Hey!

681
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,683
Hey!

682
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,184
You're moving?

683
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,852
Yeah, today's been crazy.

684
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,854
I didn't get a chance to tell you,

685
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,523
but I'm gonna be living
with my uncle for a while,

686
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,732
training for the next fight.

687
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:17,942
That's your uncle?

688
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:19,235
He's white.

689
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,529
Yeah, a long time.

690
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,283
He's gonna be staying with me,
and when we ain't training

691
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,201
you're welcome to come on over.

692
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,745
Cool, thank you. It's nice to meet you.

693
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,876
Why you giving me that look?

694
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,629
When were you gonna tell me
that your uncle's Rocky Balboa?

695
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:41,549
I'm gonna call you.

696
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:43,718
All right, I'm not gonna hold my breath.

697
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,935
<i>That Bianca
girl looks kind of nice.</i>

698
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,145
<i>You like her?</i>

699
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,730
Yeah, she cool. What, this one?

700
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:56,981
Yeah.

701
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,233
Women weaken legs.
You know what I mean?

702
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,485
My legs work just fine.
Whose room was this?

703
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,529
- This is Paulie's room.
- Paulie.

704
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,198
Paulie was my best friend even
though he wasn't so friendly.

705
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,576
<i>What happened to him?</i>

706
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,578
- Passed away.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

707
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,121
Kind of a mess.
We'll straighten it up later.

708
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,081
<i>It'll be comfortable.</i>

709
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:18,085
Oh, man, this is a dope pic!
That's your boy?

710
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,338
Yeah, that's my kid, Robert.

711
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,593
Did you train him, too?

712
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,555
I tried, but he just didn't like fighting,
didn't take to it.

713
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:32,975
He still around here?

714
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,937
No, he moved to a place called Vancouver
with his girlfriend.

715
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,774
And I think they're having
a great old time up there

716
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,984
and, you know, I hear
from him now and then,

717
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:45,196
but it was tough for him
to live in Philadelphia.

718
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:48,324
<i>Me and all that stuff...
You know, Rocky's son.</i>

719
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,911
<i>He's happy. I'm happy for him.</i>

720
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,001
Why don't you unpack, all right?

721
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:00,669
Make yourself comfortable.

722
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,714
And I'm gonna go to the restaurant
and I'll be back.

723
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,217
Then we start first thing
in the morning, all right?

724
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:07,635
<i>You got it.</i>

725
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,695
All right, Paulie!

726
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:29,907
Ooh.

727
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,477
Hey, it's time to train.
This is how you start.

728
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,021
<i>Get your engine going.</i>

729
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:12,950
I'm gonna take you to this place called
the Front Street Gym up in North Philly.

730
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,410
- It's pretty good.
- Okay.

731
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:15,828
You're gonna train there,
because I don't want you

732
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,204
to train in the same place

733
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,582
as the guy that you're
gonna be fighting, right?

734
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,791
Yeah, that makes sense.

735
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,377
Don, don't get in.
I want you to run alongside.

736
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,045
- I'm kinda antique, right?
- Yeah.

737
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,465
So I'll drive and you try to keep up.

738
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,757
How close is it?

739
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,384
It's close enough.

740
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,303
All right.

741
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,892
Hey, wait!
Let me warm up real quick.

742
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:59,121
You made it. Hey.

743
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:00,748
I thought you said it was close.

744
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,249
Not that close.

745
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,919
This is Frankford. Tough place.

746
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,798
You wanna be a Philly fighter,
this is the place to go.

747
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,759
Philly fighters, you know,

748
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,303
I think they're the toughest
guys in the world.

749
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,679
In a lot of ways.

750
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:19,433
Maybe it's in the water, I don't know,
but great place though.

751
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:20,935
What's up with all these bikes?

752
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,269
It's a Philly thing.

753
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,979
These guys are popping
wheelies and making noise,

754
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,523
going up and down the street.

755
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,815
Do you ride?

756
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,986
No. I had a Harley once but I fell off,
so I decided to use my feet.

757
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,989
Now, this kid, Sporino,
he got something special.

758
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,451
He's no pushover, so you're gonna
have to work, you know what I mean?

759
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,037
What do you think?

760
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:41,872
Not bad, huh?

761
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,207
Not bad at all.

762
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:47,878
Yeah. This'll get the job done.
Really will.

763
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,296
<i>Uh...</i>

764
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,048
<i>Look at these guys!</i>

765
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:53,842
Hey! The gang's all here!

766
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,971
Donnie, look at this.

767
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,973
This is a crew if I ever saw one.

768
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,391
Hey, Padman. Good to see you.

769
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:01,809
Hey, champ. How you doing, bro?

770
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,645
This guy is so good with the mitts,
he's gonna teach you a lot of stuff.

771
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:08,190
He's got a lot of knowledge.
And Stitch, best cut man in Philadelphia.

772
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:09,400
Hope we don't need him.

773
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:10,818
- What's going on?
- Welcome to Philly, brother.

774
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:11,986
- Pleasure.
- Glad to work with you.

775
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,320
And over here is Elvis Grant.

776
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,531
- He makes the best gloves in the world.
- Uh-huh.

777
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:18,200
And as my present to you,
starting out on the right foot--

778
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,451
- Nice to meet you, man.
- Nice to meet you too.

779
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:20,828
He's gonna make you a pair of gloves

780
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:22,621
so that your hands don't get so bad as me.

781
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,081
What? Is that coffee I smell in there?

782
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,374
Yeah, that's coffee.

783
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,917
All right, you guys
get to know each other.

784
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,168
- Amir.
- All right, Unc.

785
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,712
- Come here.
- Man, I could use some coffee.

786
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,006
Let me introduce you to my son.
This is my son, Amir.

787
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,173
That's the one you're
gonna be sparring with.

788
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:34,800
- Amir.
- Donnie. Nice to meet you.

789
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,099
Mmm-hmm.

790
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,184
Right hand fast.

791
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,020
Let it go, let it go.

792
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,398
<i>Push off that back foot.</i>

793
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,233
<i>Come on, Donnie, a little quicker.</i>

794
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,526
<i>Come on, Donnie. Back it up.</i>

795
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,445
<i>No, just like he's doing. Yeah.</i>

796
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:56,447
- I can't pivot fast enough.
- Yeah, just turn it.

797
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:57,781
That's your power.

798
00:51:58,699 --> 00:51:59,867
Fast, pop it fast.

799
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,035
I'm popping as fast as I can.

800
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,620
I'm trying to push off my
back foot like you told me.

801
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,788
Hey, Donnie. Come here.

802
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:07,750
I came out here to work with you, though.

803
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,209
This is how I work, okay?

804
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,588
There's some things I can't do.
I can't do this anymore.

805
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,256
I can never hold the pads like that.

806
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,383
But I'm looking at you.
I'm working with you.

807
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,843
I'm working with this.

808
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,637
<i>Lighten it up.</i>

809
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,055
Am I still taking them real shots?

810
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,557
Slow it down. Hey, hey!

811
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,976
That's it. Hey, hey, hey!

812
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:27,978
This easy work, Pop.

813
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:32,024
<i>Gotta keep moving. That's it.</i>

814
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:34,902
- <i>Time! Bell! Bell.</i>
- Huh!

815
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,070
Taking real shots though!

816
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,113
- What you mean?
- Cut it out!

817
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,406
Take those gloves off right now!

818
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,574
- This my gym!
- Take the glove off right now!

819
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:41,909
<i>Take your soft ass back to L.A.!</i>

820
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:44,286
<i>You ain't ready yet! This my gym!</i>

821
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:46,455
Fuck this gym!

822
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:48,248
- Called a learning curve...
- Ain't no learning.

823
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,417
Hey, hey, hey! You know what?

824
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,127
You can't learn anything
when you're talking.

825
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,295
That's a fact of life.

826
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:55,381
As long as you're talking,
you're not listening.

827
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:59,176
<i>Go apologize. You guys are
on the same damn team, okay?</i>

828
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:02,680
- <i>There you go. Good.</i>
- You good. It's okay.

829
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,099
<i>All right. Now let's go to work!</i>

830
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,017
Double jab. Yup.

831
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,769
Go ahead over the top.

832
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,646
Right hook here. Over here.

833
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,775
One step at a time, one punch at a time,

834
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:16,276
<i>one round at a time.</i>

835
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,195
<i>One step at a time,
one punch at a time,</i>

836
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:19,988
<i>one round at a time. Turn right.</i>

837
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,118
Come on, let's go.

838
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,786
Fast, pop it fast.

839
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,830
Right upper cut. Right up top.

840
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,333
Boom. Boom.

841
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:34,712
Good.

842
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,797
I want you to let it all out.

843
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:38,799
Now go right here.

844
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:40,968
Everyone's ever disrespected you,
see them.

845
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,053
Anything you ever wanted

846
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:45,681
go after it.

847
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,893
Now's your time! Make a statement!

848
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,605
One step!

849
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,150
One punch!

850
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,069
One round at a time!

851
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,704
There it is.

852
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:11,165
Ah! You cheated!

853
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:24,219
Rock.

854
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:26,180
Hey, how you doing, Pete?

855
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,019
Something wrong?

856
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,605
Rock, I knew.

857
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,899
I knew there was something with this kid.

858
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:40,027
Rocky, I have been trying for years
to get you to come work with us.

859
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,236
Aw. It's okay.

860
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,947
All of a sudden, this kid from Hollywood
gets you out of the shadows.

861
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,616
No. No shadows.

862
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,202
I just didn't want to do
nothing in the gym, that's all.

863
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,913
Rocky, I made calls to L.A.

864
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,956
Kid's name is Adonis.

865
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,208
Kid has Creed's blood.

866
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,336
Now this fight just got big time.

867
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,547
I apologize.

868
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,218
Do me a favor.
Can we keep this between ourselves?

869
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,385
- Oh, come on.
- No.

870
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:09,056
I'm asking you as a favor.
I want him to make a name on his own.

871
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,894
Come on, Pete.

872
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,441
Yeah. Secret's safe with me, Rock.

873
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,362
I appreciate it.

874
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,914
Keep going. You're looking good.

875
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,333
Go on, get moving.

876
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,771
Hey. So how's everybody feeling tonight?

877
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:01,275
I'm about to go over the ABC rules
and the rules governed by the state.

878
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,027
No three knockdown rule.
No standing eight-count.

879
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,154
A fighter cannot be saved by the bell.

880
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,783
What we mean by "no three knockdown rule"
is basically whatever the referee

881
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,952
sees fit for competition...

882
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,711
- Unc, cut my gloves off.
- What's wrong?

883
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:21,962
My gloves, just cut 'em off!

884
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:23,463
I can't cut 'em off,
you're ready to go fight.

885
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,631
Are they too tight?

886
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,842
I'm freaking out right now!
I gotta take a shit!

887
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,303
Somebody gonna
wipe my ass for me?

888
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,346
- Shit!
- Cut my gloves off, Unc!

889
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,056
All right, relax.

890
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,892
I'll cut you out of
these gloves. It happens.

891
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,727
Hey, ref, I'm gonna need some help here.

892
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,270
D, I'm gonna be right outside.

893
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:39,938
That's right.

894
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,523
Can you just stall
for 10 minutes or something?

895
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:42,900
I gotta put the gloves back on.

896
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,234
All right, I'll step on outside, Rock.

897
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,444
I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

898
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,487
- It ain't no problem. You got 10 minutes.
- First for me, man.

899
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,281
All right, come on. It'll be all right.

900
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:50,449
Yeah.

901
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,825
A little nervous?

902
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,536
- Nerves?
- Hurry up!

903
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,876
Blue corner, red corner.

904
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:03,003
All right, fellas,

905
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,880
y'all had your instructions
in the dressing room.

906
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:08,300
Obey my commands at all times,
protect yourself at all times.

907
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:09,927
Any questions from the blue corner?

908
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,553
Questions from the red corner?

909
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,680
Touch them up. Be ready on seconds out.

910
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,350
- Right. It's about you.
- Yep. Yep.

911
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,810
It's all about you. Now, you wanted this.

912
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,812
- Let's go, Coach.
- I want you to make it happen.

913
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:21,980
- Can you do it?
- Let's do it.

914
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,649
- All right. Come on.
- Let's make it happen.

915
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,609
Let's go, Unc.

916
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,821
<i>It's all about today!</i>

917
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,824
<i>There is no tomorrow! Let's go!</i>

918
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,077
<i>Nice!</i>

919
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,497
<i>Move and target, move and target!</i>

920
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,041
<i>Jab! It's the jab!</i>

921
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,586
<i>His face is right there!
Come on! Where's the jab?</i>

922
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,259
<i>Hands up. Hands up, kid.</i>

923
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,602
<i>Breathe, kid, breathe!</i>

924
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,276
Let's go, boy! Let's go, boy!

925
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,195
<i>Way to get out of there.</i>

926
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:12,406
<i>Keep moving, Donnie!</i>

927
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,033
<i>Move your head! That's it.</i>

928
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,493
<i>Get on him! Get on him!</i>

929
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,833
Break! My break!

930
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,876
Let's go, boy!

931
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:28,171
<i>There you go! There you go! Good.</i>

932
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,381
<i>Back off.</i>

933
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,925
Leo! Leo! Leo!

934
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,219
<i>One punch on top.</i>

935
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,518
<i>Keep moving. That's right.
Block left. Block left.</i>

936
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:48,817
<i>Relax.</i>

937
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,028
Let's go, boy! Come
get this shit! Come get it!

938
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,612
<i>You're doing good, kid!</i>

939
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:53,822
<i>Keep the pressure up!</i>

940
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,495
Break!

941
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:01,830
<i>Let's go, Leo!</i>

942
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:02,998
<i>Come on!</i>

943
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,249
Let's go.

944
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:05,834
<i>Keep moving! Keep coming forward!</i>

945
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,711
<i>Great shot!</i>

946
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:11,089
Come on, Donnie!

947
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:15,385
<i>What are you doing?</i>

948
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,306
- Time!
- Yeah.

949
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,143
Okay! All right.

950
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:25,979
It's okay. Take a deep breath.

951
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,023
Through your lungs.
Deep breath. Deep breath.

952
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,441
Look at me.

953
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,193
I like what you're doing
out there, all right?

954
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,360
You're a little tight.

955
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,612
You're gonna loosen up, all right?

956
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:34,988
Here's what I want you to do.

957
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,907
I want you to throw your
left under the radar.

958
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,950
- That's it.
- Then come up with a shovel hook.

959
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,118
You're gonna see an opening,

960
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,329
put it right on his chin,
that'll drop him--

961
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:44,664
Mouthpiece in, seconds out!

962
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,000
<i>Your old man
did that to me. It worked.</i>

963
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,877
Mouthpiece in, seconds out!

964
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:53,298
Leo! Leo! Leo!

965
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:03,892
Come on!

966
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:15,862
Come on!

967
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,335
<i>Tie him up! That's it.
Good boy! Tie him up!</i>

968
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:31,545
<i>Break!</i>

969
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,172
Come on!

970
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,344
Kid, seize it now! Now! Now!

971
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,142
- Get up! Get up!
- Come on, kid! Come on!

972
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,935
- One! Two!
- Get up and get some!

973
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:48,228
<i>Three! Four!</i>

974
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:49,396
We got him, Rock!

975
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,189
<i>Five! Six!</i>

976
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,899
Seven! Eight!

977
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,818
- I'm good.
- Nine! Ten!

978
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:55,986
<i>That's it, baby!</i>

979
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,196
We got one, Rock! Whoo!

980
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,658
- We got one! Yeah, we got one!
- Unbelievable!

981
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,201
- It's because of you!
- No, you did it.

982
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,370
Come on, man! You did it.

983
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:07,873
You okay?

984
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,040
Give him some room.
Rock. Rock. Rock.

985
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,375
<i>Lucky shot.</i>

986
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,752
Come on in! Bianca! Bianca! Come in!

987
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:15,672
Sorry! Sorry!

988
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:16,923
I'm all good.

989
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,384
You didn't say you had hands like that!

990
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:21,803
Why didn't you say you had
hands like that, though?

991
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:24,890
Well, but girl, I'm square though.
I'm square though.

992
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,683
You good? What we doing after this?

993
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:27,851
Let's go for it.

994
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,394
- Let's go tear the city up!
- Okay.

995
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:00,592
- Hey.
- Hmm.

996
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:02,594
<i>I made something for you.</i>

997
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:17,150
- Keep 'em closed.
- Mmm-hmm.

998
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:46,429
Come listen with me.

999
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:19,754
- What about your uncle?
- Huh.

1000
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,131
He's asleep.

1001
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:24,217
He old, man.

1002
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,339
There he is.

1003
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,715
- What's up, Unc?
- Hey, how you feeling?

1004
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:07,427
I'm good. I'm a little sore,
but I'm all right.

1005
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,888
- You want some toast?
- Okay.

1006
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:13,224
So you cooking or you watching?

1007
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,392
No, I'm looking you up.

1008
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,894
- You're doing what?
- I'm looking you up.

1009
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:17,687
No, don't do that. I'm right here.

1010
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:24,569
Mmm.

1011
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,574
What's up?

1012
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,743
You got something you wanna tell me?

1013
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,298
I didn't lie.

1014
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:46,508
You might as well have.

1015
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:47,801
You told me that your dad
was some fighter.

1016
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,844
You didn't say he was the most
famous fighter to ever live.

1017
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,805
People look at me differently
when they know.

1018
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,139
They look at Apollo differently, too.

1019
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,058
Yeah, Donnie, but I'm not people.

1020
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:56,434
I don't care about that shit.

1021
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,020
I do care about you keeping it
100 with me, though.

1022
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,689
Well, listen. You're right, okay?

1023
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,150
No, seriously, look. You...

1024
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,571
100% honesty from here on out.

1025
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:13,993
All right. So his...
His wife, that's not your mom?

1026
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,081
Apollo had an affair with my mom.

1027
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,625
All right? She died when I was young.

1028
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,920
I bounced around foster care
for a couple years.

1029
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,297
In and out of juvie.

1030
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,134
Then Mary Anne tracked me down
and took me in.

1031
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:32,011
Anything else?

1032
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,890
Ask me.

1033
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,435
How many females have you
been with before me?

1034
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,603
Anything else?

1035
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:43,231
Look, Bianca, come on now, you different.

1036
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:44,441
How?

1037
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,776
When I'm around you I feel
like I know you my whole life.

1038
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,069
Mmm-hmm.

1039
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,863
Tell me you don't feel
the same way about me.

1040
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,115
Whatever. That's passion.
That's infatuation. That fades.

1041
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:53,450
I can't see that happening.

1042
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,410
- Why not?
- You motivate me.

1043
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:56,744
Okay, so I'm just motivation to you?

1044
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,204
Are you gonna find a problem
with everything I say?

1045
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,290
No, I'm gonna find the real
in what you're saying.

1046
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:03,877
Don't worry, it's cool.

1047
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:06,254
Maybe you're just
motivation to me, too.

1048
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:07,755
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1049
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,133
I don't mind that.

1050
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,095
What?

1051
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:17,724
You do look like him, though.

1052
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:19,517
Oh, my God. I hate that!

1053
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,978
Just to get on my nerves!

1054
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,650
<i>Welcome to</i> PTI, <i>boys and girls.</i>

1055
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,486
<i>We begin today with the boxing world.</i>

1056
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:33,615
<i>Adonis Johnson, a little-known boxer being
trained by Rocky Balboa</i>

1057
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:36,659
<i>handed light heavyweight
title contender Leo Sporino</i>

1058
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:40,079
<i>a second-round TKO defeat
in Philadelphia last night.</i>

1059
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,749
<i>An anonymous source confirmed
to ESPN that Johnson</i>

1060
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:46,544
<i>is the youngest biological son
of Apollo Creed.</i>

1061
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,630
<i>A fact that was kept under
wraps because Johnson</i>

1062
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,632
<i>was the product of Creed's infidelity.</i>

1063
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:53,343
<i>The boxing world is excited to
have another Creed in the ring</i>

1064
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:57,722
<i>but, Wilbon, does knowledge of this affair
damage Apollo Creed's legacy?</i>

1065
01:06:57,889 --> 01:06:59,516
<i>Damage his legacy?
Let's go back for a second.</i>

1066
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,392
<i>A little history on Apollo Creed.</i>

1067
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,812
<i>I certainly have him right up there
as maybe the best of all time.</i>

1068
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:05,980
<i>End of discussion.</i>

1069
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:07,690
<i>He slipped. He made a mistake,
like a lot of people.</i>

1070
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,901
<i>This isn't gonna be the first,
particularly in the boxing world!</i>

1071
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,110
<i>Yeah.</i>

1072
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:12,946
<i>But I'm not gonna say
it's gonna kill his legacy.</i>

1073
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,822
<i>I think it's an embarrassment</i>

1074
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:17,367
<i>and I think the family must
have felt this embarrassment</i>

1075
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,035
<i>because they kept it
under wraps for so long.</i>

1076
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,412
- <i>But I really have one question.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

1077
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,915
<i>Can the kid fight as well as the old man?</i>

1078
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:25,124
<i>That's a stretch.</i>

1079
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,879
<i>I found us our next payday.</i>

1080
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:33,633
<i>Check it out.</i>

1081
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,262
- Creed's son?
- Yeah.

1082
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:38,888
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

1083
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,265
He's got one fight under his belt.

1084
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:42,225
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know.

1085
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,269
But he's got Balboa in his corner.

1086
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:47,438
No one cares about Balboa anymore.

1087
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,149
<i>Kid's here because of a name alone.</i>

1088
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,651
You're gonna do it.

1089
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:53,319
This guy doesn't even deserve a shot.

1090
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,989
Listen to me.
This is not a negotiation, all right?

1091
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,616
<i>You're the idiot that ran
around Toxteth with a gun.</i>

1092
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,243
<i>Do you remember that?</i>

1093
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:04,330
<i>And you are the clown who couldn't
control himself at a weigh-in</i>

1094
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,165
and lost us millions in
the process. Millions, okay?

1095
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,584
So look at it again.

1096
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,172
I don't wanna be remembered like this.

1097
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,008
I don't care how you're remembered.

1098
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:18,803
I care about your kids having a roof
over their head when you're done.

1099
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,346
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1100
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:30,523
Hello?

1101
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:33,610
It's Tommy Holiday.
I look after Ricky Conlan.

1102
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:37,822
- Yeah, how you doing?
- <i>Listen.</i>

1103
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,491
Is it true about the kid?

1104
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,370
About the kid?

1105
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,291
Uh...

1106
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,294
Think you and the kid have got 30 minutes
for a business meeting?

1107
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:55,465
All right, I'll tell you what.

1108
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:57,383
Yeah, if you can get over here, sure.

1109
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:00,136
We'll talk with you,
but it's gotta be fast

1110
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:02,055
because we're training.

1111
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,473
<i>I can be there. Couple of days.</i>

1112
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,891
- Yeah.
- <i>I'll be in touch.</i>

1113
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,643
Okay.

1114
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:13,399
Oh, man.

1115
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,736
<i>Thanks for taking the time.
I'll get right to it.</i>

1116
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:20,114
My guy needs to fight
in the next six months

1117
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,825
and we've beaten everybody.

1118
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,703
You want me to fight Conlan?

1119
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:27,872
I think it would be a very wise move.

1120
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,416
You've been down in
Mexico doing pro fights, eh?

1121
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,752
I've got you as 15-0 down there.

1122
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:35,254
And with the Sporino fight,
that makes you 16-0.

1123
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,590
Now, nobody needs to know these fights

1124
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:40,593
were in some hole in the wall,
do they, eh?

1125
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,765
You think I'm ready?

1126
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:48,559
Donnie, this man came here because
he knows you're a sure thing.

1127
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:49,769
Right? It's a sure victory.

1128
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:51,437
That is not true.

1129
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:54,941
Yeah, it is.

1130
01:09:58,111 --> 01:09:59,112
Okay, listen.

1131
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:00,613
All right.

1132
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:04,242
This could be my guy's last fight.

1133
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,452
And I wanna make it count.

1134
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:07,954
Now, on that note,

1135
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:10,456
we would need you to change
your name to Creed.

1136
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:11,958
It's just a formality.

1137
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:19,132
And what if I say no?

1138
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:23,302
Well, then there's no fight.

1139
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,762
Without the name, there's no fight.

1140
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,389
It's a non-starter.

1141
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,475
Okay. Okay.

1142
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:33,062
Why don't you both take a day,
talk about it

1143
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:36,065
and we'll, uh, see what you say, okay?

1144
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,943
It's a good deal.

1145
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,570
Can't do it.

1146
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:41,988
Nah, it's not my name.

1147
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:46,492
And plus, I wanna make it
on my own merit anyway.

1148
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,494
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1149
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,788
You got a funny way of showing it.

1150
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:52,665
What's that supposed to mean?

1151
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:55,001
I mean, weren't Apollo and Rocky
like best friends?

1152
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:58,629
It feels like you're trying to tap into
whatever it is he left behind.

1153
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:01,758
I don't think that's anything
to be ashamed of, you know?

1154
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,134
What are you afraid of?

1155
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,178
Uh, what are you afraid of?

1156
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,013
I don't know.

1157
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,515
I mean, this hearing shit don't scare you?

1158
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:10,850
Uh...

1159
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:14,103
I always knew it would happen eventually

1160
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:17,273
so my plan has always just been

1161
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:20,276
to do what I love for as long as I can.

1162
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:24,864
I think that's all we ever do. You know?

1163
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:29,035
So, what are you afraid of?

1164
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:33,706
I'm afraid of taking on
the name and losing.

1165
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:37,126
They'll call me a fraud. Fake Creed.

1166
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,504
Why don't you think about what's true?

1167
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:42,298
You love to fight, right?

1168
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:45,718
Yeah, it makes you happy, right?

1169
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:46,969
Yeah.

1170
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:50,681
Yeah, and you are
Apollo Creed's son, right?

1171
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:53,643
Yes.

1172
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,686
So then use the name.

1173
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:58,481
It's yours.

1174
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:14,580
Hey, Unc, you down there?

1175
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,040
Yeah.

1176
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,761
I know you don't want me
to do this, right?

1177
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:32,265
I can think of
better things to do, Donnie.

1178
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,183
But if we did do it

1179
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,270
how we get it done?

1180
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:43,150
Mmm.

1181
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:47,446
Well...

1182
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:55,621
He's taller than you.
He has a reach on you.

1183
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,749
Definitely has a lot more
experience than you.

1184
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,085
<i>And he's faster than you are.</i>

1185
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:02,587
He's the champion.

1186
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:05,214
And since he's the champion,

1187
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,301
you gotta bring
the fight to him, like I did.

1188
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:12,305
You gotta go to the body. Dig.
And in doing that

1189
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,474
you're in a very dangerous place

1190
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,310
<i>because you can get laid out.</i>

1191
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,980
It ain't easy for me to be
in your corner, kid.

1192
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:23,983
I don't know if you're ready for it.

1193
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,985
I don't know if I'm ready for it.

1194
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,906
But I'll do what you wanna do.

1195
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,783
If it was anybody else in my corner

1196
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,327
I wouldn't do it.

1197
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,788
But I got you.

1198
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,002
So make the call.

1199
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:46,672
All right.

1200
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,350
I'm fighting Ricky Conlan.

1201
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:05,024
I'm fighting
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!

1202
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:13,032
Don't work him too hard, Rock.

1203
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,492
- Yeah.
- He's still a puppy.

1204
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,452
Come on, come on.

1205
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:18,746
Close the distance. That's it.

1206
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:21,457
Yeah. One, two.

1207
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:22,708
Good.

1208
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,961
Come on. Body, come here.

1209
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,629
Oh, yeah. Got a good hit.

1210
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:30,257
Okay.

1211
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:31,968
Come on.

1212
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:36,097
Dig deep. Body, body, body. Good.

1213
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,226
You up to moving around?

1214
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:42,979
Take a break.

1215
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,153
Oh. Hey, Unc, you all right?

1216
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,446
- I'm all right.
- You okay?

1217
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:53,614
I'm all right. It's out.

1218
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,449
- I'm all right.
- All right.

1219
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,034
Just let me walk.

1220
01:14:57,785 --> 01:14:59,036
Just... I'm good.

1221
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:00,204
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1222
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:03,749
Hey. What's wrong with you?

1223
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,543
I don't know. I don't know.

1224
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:06,752
Come here.

1225
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:08,212
Just let me walk.

1226
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:11,716
No, we got to call someone
and get you to the doctor, okay?

1227
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:12,925
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

1228
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:14,135
- Off the rope.
- Easy.

1229
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,512
Come on, I got you. Hey, Stitch!

1230
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,055
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. What?

1231
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:20,099
- No, I'm really...
- Hey, somebody help!

1232
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,191
Hi.

1233
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:30,526
- Hi.
- Donnie.

1234
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,111
Dr. Kathari.

1235
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,655
Mr. Balboa, how you feeling?

1236
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:36,824
I'm feeling good, real good.
I could go now.

1237
01:15:36,991 --> 01:15:39,118
Heard you fell down.
Was that the first time you've fallen?

1238
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:40,995
Well, without being punched.

1239
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:43,456
<i>I'm gonna give you some more fluids.
That should help you feel better.</i>

1240
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:44,790
And we're gonna run
some tests in the morning

1241
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:46,459
- and get you out of here.
- Can you do this fast?

1242
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,002
Because we got a lot of stuff to do.

1243
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:50,838
Just relax. All right? Go to sleep.

1244
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:53,132
- I'll check on you later.
- Thank you.

1245
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:55,384
Gotta do it fast. We have to--

1246
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,386
Donnie, we gotta train.

1247
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,055
Yeah, go to sleep.

1248
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,106
<i>You guys need any more help?</i>

1249
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:10,941
- No! We're good.
- No, we're good, thank you!

1250
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:12,109
- You got it? What you need?
- Nothing.

1251
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:13,277
<i>Thought you got lost for a minute.</i>

1252
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:18,240
<i>I have not seen food
that look like this in this house ever.</i>

1253
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:19,533
Yeah?

1254
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:23,913
Yes. You know, usually everything
I have has sauce or something on it.

1255
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:25,414
Get some of these collard greens.

1256
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:26,832
All right. You just...

1257
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,459
- Just a little bit?
- Yeah, a little bit.

1258
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:31,045
Bianca, you're beautiful

1259
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:33,464
and I think you'll be a great singer.

1260
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:36,509
I think you're gonna be a
great champ, like your father.

1261
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,135
Maybe even better.

1262
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:41,764
And for me, who's lucky enough
to be knowing both of you guys.

1263
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:44,683
Here we go. <i>Cent'anni.</i> 100 years.

1264
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,018
I'm honored.

1265
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:47,311
Lucky me.

1266
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,315
Keep working on that shovel hook.

1267
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:52,566
Ah.

1268
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:53,984
Right, that's it.

1269
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:56,487
Now, I wanna throw the hook
on the same side.

1270
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:59,156
So you come up on the right,
you throw on the right.

1271
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,491
Very good.

1272
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,620
A little more vicious than that,
little more power.

1273
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:07,957
Overdo it. Yeah! Very good.

1274
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:09,250
Hey, Rock.

1275
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,127
Yeah.

1276
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,711
Good. You're looking good.

1277
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,004
<i>Are you getting jealous?</i>

1278
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,132
Yeah, a little.

1279
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:20,386
- It's for you.
- Thanks.

1280
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:23,180
Hello? Yeah?

1281
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,473
Yeah.

1282
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,437
Yeah, okay.

1283
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:32,481
All right, thanks.

1284
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:40,906
<i>Mr. Balboa.</i>

1285
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,620
Thanks for coming in on such short notice.

1286
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:51,959
Well, we went through your test results

1287
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:54,044
and your biopsy came back showing signs

1288
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:57,339
of large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

1289
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:00,301
What's that do?

1290
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:03,262
Well, it's a form of cancer.

1291
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:13,856
I know that sounds scary,

1292
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:16,150
but the good news is we caught it early.

1293
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:18,736
However, we will have to
remove the tumor in

1294
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:21,572
your lymph nodes and start
chemotherapy immediately.

1295
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,826
My wife tried that.

1296
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,913
Mr. Balboa, as far as
options for treatment,

1297
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,706
this is the best plan of action.

1298
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:33,167
No, I understand, but my wife tried that,

1299
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:36,045
and I don't think I wanna do it.

1300
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:38,339
Didn't turn out so good. But it's okay.

1301
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:41,091
With treatment, you'll still have
a very good chance of recovery.

1302
01:18:42,176 --> 01:18:43,510
Without it...

1303
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,932
I'm okay with it, really.

1304
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,100
Well, at least take these.

1305
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:54,271
It has information on your diagnosis
and options for treatment.

1306
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,649
- We can start--
- Thank you very much.

1307
01:18:57,233 --> 01:19:00,819
Listen, I'd appreciate if you wouldn't
say nothing to nobody, okay?

1308
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:10,329
Oh, man! There's so much traffic,
you wouldn't believe it.

1309
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:12,248
That senior bus was running late, huh?

1310
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,500
Hey, that's a cheap shot.

1311
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:16,335
- It's the truth.
- Get in the ring.

1312
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,254
- Hurry up and get ready.
- I've been ready.

1313
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,589
- Good.
- I've been waiting on you.

1314
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:24,802
Oh, come on, just put your gloves on
and stop talking so much.

1315
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:37,690
We got a few things to do.

1316
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:40,276
- It's all about you.
- Mmm-hmm.

1317
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:42,903
I already had my career. I did okay.

1318
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:45,406
What's your excuse? You got no excuse.

1319
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:49,285
Now is the time for you to
rise to the occasion there.

1320
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:50,703
- Just gonna put my--
- I can do it.

1321
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,830
Okay, all right.

1322
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:54,999
Now...

1323
01:19:56,250 --> 01:20:00,087
I want you to always, always, always
pay attention to yourself first.

1324
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:01,297
Right.

1325
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,799
If I'm not here to start with,
just start moving around.

1326
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:05,092
All right. Mouthpiece.

1327
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,635
Know what I'm saying?

1328
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,222
Too many punches to the head, huh?

1329
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:11,390
Yeah, whatever, coach.

1330
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:13,017
All right, get going there, champ.

1331
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:14,476
Bell.

1332
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:15,978
<i>Come on, Creed!</i>

1333
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:26,864
Be first, Donnie. Come on!

1334
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,035
All right, Amir.

1335
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,162
<i>All right, champ.
Don't work too hard.</i>

1336
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:55,642
This shit for real?

1337
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:00,689
Doesn't matter.

1338
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,651
What you should be thinking
about is that fight coming up.

1339
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:07,237
That's the only thing that should
be on your mind, nothing else.

1340
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:09,615
What you mean, don't think about this?
When you starting treatment?

1341
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:14,703
I'm not doing no chemotherapy. No.

1342
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:17,247
If you don't jump on this quick,
you're gonna end up dying.

1343
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,209
I know.

1344
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,169
And you're all right with that?

1345
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,005
I am.

1346
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,841
Man, you sound crazy, man.
Give me the keys.

1347
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:29,093
I'll take you to the hospital right now.

1348
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:30,344
I'm not crazy at all.

1349
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:32,638
If I could take everything that was good

1350
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:35,391
and put it into a bowl or something

1351
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:37,226
and say, "Hey! Here. I'd like to

1352
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,561
"buy one more day with my wife,"

1353
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:41,397
I'd do it.

1354
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,566
I would die a happy man, right then.

1355
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:46,860
Not gonna happen.

1356
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:55,577
So, everything I got has
moved on and I'm here.

1357
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,373
But you know what? It's okay.

1358
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:01,458
Because I said to myself,

1359
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:04,002
"if I break, if I'm hurt, whatever.

1360
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:06,296
"I ain't gonna fix it. Why bother?"

1361
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,132
And I'm just some bum
just living in your crib,

1362
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:09,508
just nothing.

1363
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:11,510
You're a good kid, a good fighter.

1364
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:14,263
But you got your
whole future ahead of you.

1365
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:15,597
Mine?

1366
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:21,145
Back there, like
all them guys on that wall.

1367
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:24,356
In the back, in the past.

1368
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,525
We're going nowhere.

1369
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:29,445
I am to you just an old trainer.

1370
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:32,531
That's what brought us together. You know?

1371
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,700
We're not a real family.

1372
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,707
That was just in our heads, kid.

1373
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:54,511
Oh, what'd you do? What'd you do?

1374
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,230
Why'd you say that?

1375
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:26,752
Hey, what's up, Lil Creed?

1376
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:28,712
It's good.

1377
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:34,885
- Oh, hey!
- What's up, bro?

1378
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:36,178
- Hey!
- What up?

1379
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:37,429
Hi!

1380
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:40,182
You okay?

1381
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:43,143
Yeah. How you doing? You good?

1382
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:45,270
Yeah, I'm good. I'm a little nervous.

1383
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,731
There's just a lot of people here,
not really my crowd, you know?

1384
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:48,899
Yeah, I can see.

1385
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:50,734
Look, it's the boxing boy,
Lil Apollo Creed.

1386
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:52,528
I know his girl.

1387
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:53,737
What's up, Bianca?

1388
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:56,073
- Hey.
- You don't know nobody no more?

1389
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,282
Nah, I said hello to you
when I walked past.

1390
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:58,534
You didn't say nothing to me.

1391
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,452
<i>Yeah, I bet you did.
Stop acting light-skinned.</i>

1392
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:02,204
<i>Hey, man, why don't you come
over here and grab this pic</i>

1393
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:03,497
<i>with me real quick for the 'Gram?</i>

1394
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:04,873
Yeah, that's cool.

1395
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:07,543
Come on, man. You know he busy, man.

1396
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,086
Welcome to my city, champ.

1397
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,131
- There it is, Abbie.
- Believe dat.

1398
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:14,883
Hey, good looking, Baby Creed.

1399
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,301
Don't call me that.

1400
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:17,970
Don't call you that?
Don't call you what?

1401
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:20,722
You just called me "Baby Creed."
I said, don't call me that.

1402
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:23,225
Hey, fam, dig this.
I was showing you love, man.

1403
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:24,560
You ain't got to come off like that.

1404
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,103
Yeah, that's cool, that's cool,
that's all love.

1405
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:28,480
I know it's cool.
You definitely know it's cool.

1406
01:24:28,647 --> 01:24:30,941
When you talking to me,
you talking real tough, you feel me?

1407
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:32,526
Better talk to your little
pretty boy boyfriend, man.

1408
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:35,153
Get a VIP pass next to your
pop, talking to me like that.

1409
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,614
- No!
- Hold up, nigga!

1410
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:40,325
Donnie! Donnie! Donnie!

1411
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:44,329
Donnie! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

1412
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:45,581
I'll kill your ass!

1413
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:46,748
Donnie! Donnie!

1414
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:48,917
<i>How's he doing?</i>

1415
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,085
He's all right now.

1416
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:51,753
- You know what happened?
- We had to separate him.

1417
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,255
He was fighting with the other inmates.

1418
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:54,631
Oh, no. Anybody get hurt?

1419
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:56,091
Nah, nothing life-threatening.

1420
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,135
- All right, thank you.
- No problem, champ.

1421
01:24:58,302 --> 01:24:59,303
Yeah.

1422
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:01,513
Hey, Donnie.

1423
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:08,186
How you doing, son?

1424
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,940
I know a lot of cops and they said,

1425
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,483
"Your friend's locked up."

1426
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:16,528
Friends?
You're just a trainer to me, right?

1427
01:25:19,156 --> 01:25:21,658
I'm sorry about what I said
to you, back at the gym.

1428
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:23,327
That was just me talking.
I didn't mean it.

1429
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:24,995
You just stay away from me.

1430
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:27,623
Listen, Donnie--

1431
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,499
- Man, don't touch me.
- Come on, what--

1432
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,627
Get your hands off me, old man!

1433
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,171
Get your sick ass out of here!

1434
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:37,049
Leave!

1435
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:40,218
You here talking like you my family!
You got my real family killed!

1436
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:52,564
I ain't leaving

1437
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:55,359
till I tell you what's on my mind.

1438
01:25:56,526 --> 01:25:58,570
You hate me, that's what it is.

1439
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:00,572
Or maybe you're mad with somebody

1440
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:04,201
who ain't here, Donnie,
who can't defend himself.

1441
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,662
You know?

1442
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,914
Now, I understand what you're
going through, young man.

1443
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:10,082
I've been there.

1444
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:12,584
And I know what it's like
to feel abandoned,

1445
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:14,670
and be mad at everything.

1446
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,880
And you're a better person than that.

1447
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:21,760
Forgive him. Because there's
nothing you can do about it.

1448
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:23,512
It's taking a toll on you.

1449
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:29,685
You're still caught in his shadow.

1450
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:33,438
You got to move, Donnie.

1451
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:35,440
Just leave, man.

1452
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,822
<i>Let's go, Johnson.</i>

1453
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:51,099
<i>Bianca!</i>

1454
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,644
Yo! Stop knocking on my door
like the police.

1455
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:55,854
Can you at least let me apologize?

1456
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:57,189
No, it doesn't work like that.

1457
01:27:57,355 --> 01:27:59,149
You apologize when you spill
a drink on someone's shirt.

1458
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:01,359
<i>But you assaulted
the headliner to my show,</i>

1459
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:03,528
<i>a show I worked really hard to get.</i>

1460
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:05,864
<i>What if I came to your fight
acting like an ass?</i>

1461
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:07,491
Would that be cool with you?

1462
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:09,493
Nah, I didn't think so.

1463
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:14,331
How'd you do though? You kill it?

1464
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:16,625
Yeah, we did good.

1465
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,169
I messed that up and I gotta
live with that, all right?

1466
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:20,545
But I never meant to let you down.

1467
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,339
Then what did you mean to do, D?

1468
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:24,716
Just have a little ego contest?

1469
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,057
Rocky's sick.

1470
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:44,569
He's got cancer.

1471
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:46,905
I ain't trying to make excuses
for anything that I did,

1472
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:49,157
but I found out right before your show.

1473
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:50,408
How bad is it?

1474
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:54,329
They want him to start chemo
but, you know, he's too macho to do that.

1475
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:57,707
Jesus.

1476
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:04,589
Well, maybe you can talk
some sense into him.

1477
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,260
I don't think he'd wanna hear
anything I got to say.

1478
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:14,266
Yeah, well, give him my love.

1479
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:17,435
Hey, Bianca, don't close me out right now.

1480
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:22,774
Look, we both got a lot going on right now
so I think you should focus on yours

1481
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:24,192
and I'm gonna focus on mine.

1482
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:25,443
I'm sorry.

1483
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:27,779
What's that mean?

1484
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:30,699
<i>I get it, I messed up.</i>

1485
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:35,579
<i>I trusted you!
Can you please not shut me out?</i>

1486
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,417
<i>I'm sorry, okay?</i>

1487
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:44,045
I need you right now.

1488
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:20,832
Nigga, what's up?

1489
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:22,292
What's up?

1490
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:25,420
Hey, I heard you Apollo Creed's son.

1491
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:30,008
Yeah.

1492
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:33,261
That's what's up.

1493
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:20,850
Look like you lost five pounds.
You ought to sit down and eat.

1494
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:36,533
I mean, what I look like?

1495
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,411
Letting you train me
while you sit around and die?

1496
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,543
Just like any other fight.

1497
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:50,922
This fight? I seen it before.

1498
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:54,926
It gets as bad as it can get

1499
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:58,763
and most of the time, you don't win it.

1500
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:00,098
Yeah, but I don't care.

1501
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:02,600
I ain't training if you
don't get the treatment.

1502
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:05,103
So if I fight, you fight.

1503
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:39,512
- Hey.
- What's up?

1504
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,097
You been to the gym?

1505
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:42,724
Nah, I've been here.

1506
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:45,727
Okay. Here you go. Remember this?

1507
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:47,479
Get up.

1508
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:49,522
- Ready?
- What's--

1509
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:51,107
<i>I want you to shadow box.</i>

1510
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:53,443
This is a nice room,
let's see you move around.

1511
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:54,611
<i>You're serious?</i>

1512
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:56,529
- Want me to do it for you?
- No. It's all good.

1513
01:32:56,696 --> 01:32:58,490
- Yeah, ready?
- Come on.

1514
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:00,325
Time!

1515
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,285
There you go.

1516
01:33:09,709 --> 01:33:11,127
We used to do that with one hand.

1517
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:14,839
I don't wanna say anything
though.

1518
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:16,382
Two...

1519
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:21,096
Don't hit the lady.

1520
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:23,014
She'll probably drop you.

1521
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:36,194
All right. Come on, almost there.

1522
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:38,238
Come on, Unc.

1523
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:45,411
Oh, God.

1524
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:20,280
Come on, let's go.

1525
01:34:24,492 --> 01:34:25,535
Yeah, yes!

1526
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,745
That's your thing, yes! More! Yes!

1527
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,459
- One. Two? The deal was two!
- I can't, no.

1528
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:34,919
<i>I'm dizzy.</i>

1529
01:34:45,763 --> 01:34:46,890
Double jab.

1530
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:48,183
Step on right under there.

1531
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:56,733
Good.

1532
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:58,610
At least we got the speed.

1533
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:02,447
We just need him to sit down
so when he hits something, he breaks it.

1534
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:06,910
Good.

1535
01:35:07,243 --> 01:35:09,329
Step with it, you gotta step
with it. Come on!

1536
01:35:10,955 --> 01:35:12,081
Little bit more.

1537
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:14,083
Little bit more, dig down. Good.

1538
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:15,627
Good. Keep it right.

1539
01:35:16,211 --> 01:35:17,212
Yes!

1540
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:19,672
Look, he's doing the same thing.

1541
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:21,299
Yeah, he does, it looks that way.

1542
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:24,177
But I think he's got something
up his sleeve for you.

1543
01:35:37,607 --> 01:35:38,650
Wow, beautiful.

1544
01:35:39,901 --> 01:35:41,444
Yo, you going to see Rock?

1545
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:43,571
Yeah, let's go!
We got you! Let's go!

1546
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:45,490
<i>Make history, Creed! Let's go!</i>

1547
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:51,788
What up? Come on, y'all!
Let's ride! Come on!

1548
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:53,581
That's what I like, man!

1549
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:56,584
Let's go see Rock
on Front Street! Ride with me!

1550
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:47,236
You wanna say hello?

1551
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,782
Place looks like a church.

1552
01:37:50,948 --> 01:37:52,408
<i>Yeah, feel like an art museum.</i>

1553
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:53,785
<i>Yeah, beautiful.</i>

1554
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:56,871
The fight starts in about two minutes.

1555
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:59,082
As soon as he shows up,
he's gonna start on you.

1556
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:00,375
Okay.

1557
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:16,766
Don't let him get to you.

1558
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:18,810
Okay, great.
Thank you all for coming.

1559
01:38:18,976 --> 01:38:20,812
Let's get straight into questions.

1560
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:23,481
Uh, young lady to the left.

1561
01:38:23,815 --> 01:38:26,651
Conlan, can we expect
any more fireworks at the weigh-in?

1562
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:28,361
I've been doing some
anger management classes

1563
01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:30,488
and trying to control that temper of mine.

1564
01:38:30,655 --> 01:38:32,907
I just gotta make sure he forgets it all
by Saturday night.

1565
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:36,994
<i>Okay, next question.</i>

1566
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:38,496
<i>Young man in the glasses.</i>

1567
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:40,748
What about the contrast between you two?

1568
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:44,168
You, the overnight success versus
Conlan's rags to riches background.

1569
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:45,670
Nothing happened overnight.

1570
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:47,171
I've been fighting for some time now--

1571
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:48,673
<i>That's exactly
how it happened for this guy.</i>

1572
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:51,509
He's an overnight success,
never had a damn fight in his life.

1573
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:54,512
He's got this shot because
he found that name last night.

1574
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:57,348
<i>One more. There's a lot
of talk about legacy in this fight.</i>

1575
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:58,850
<i>Johnson, can you speak to that?</i>

1576
01:38:59,016 --> 01:39:00,977
Yeah, I've been working on
trying to build my own legacy.

1577
01:39:01,227 --> 01:39:03,646
Legacy? Are we
at some kind of comedy club?

1578
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:04,856
The guy next to him,

1579
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:06,858
now that's what
we're talking about legacy.

1580
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:08,359
- And I'm cut from that cloth.
- Don't fall for it.

1581
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:10,069
My father worked on the docks.

1582
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:12,405
His father was heavyweight
champion of the world.

1583
01:39:12,572 --> 01:39:14,282
People like Silver Spoon over there--

1584
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:16,659
- You don't know nothing about me.
- I know enough about you.

1585
01:39:16,826 --> 01:39:18,119
- I'm here now though.
- You found yourself here.

1586
01:39:18,286 --> 01:39:19,287
- I'm here now.
- You a false Creed.

1587
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:20,955
All right, I'll show you right now.
My pops ain't here.

1588
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:22,123
Sit down!

1589
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:23,499
You wanna fight here?
I'll do it right now!

1590
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:25,835
I can do it right now, bitch!
We can do it right now!

1591
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:29,589
- "Creed" my asshole!
- Keep it down!

1592
01:39:29,755 --> 01:39:32,008
- Yo, you okay? Good?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1593
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:33,759
Okay, we'll see what's up.

1594
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,804
<i>I'm gonna knock
that smile off your face.</i>

1595
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,188
<i>Yo, Donnie, it's Rock.</i>

1596
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:50,902
Unc, you okay?

1597
01:39:51,068 --> 01:39:53,321
Yeah, I'm good. Just couldn't sleep.

1598
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:55,781
- Yeah, me either.
- Is it okay I sit down?

1599
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:56,949
Course.

1600
01:39:58,242 --> 01:39:59,368
Donnie...

1601
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:03,372
I'd like you to do me a favor
when all this is over.

1602
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:05,041
- Yeah, anything.
- Okay, good.

1603
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:08,669
It's not important but just...
I wanna lock it in, okay?

1604
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:10,213
Yeah, you got it.

1605
01:40:10,379 --> 01:40:11,714
There you go.

1606
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:16,344
You okay, huh?

1607
01:40:16,511 --> 01:40:17,762
Yeah, why?

1608
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:21,057
No, you keep looking at the door.

1609
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:22,266
No!

1610
01:40:23,726 --> 01:40:25,144
Mmm-mmm.

1611
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:29,607
Do you hear something?

1612
01:40:30,191 --> 01:40:31,192
No.

1613
01:40:33,945 --> 01:40:35,446
Who is that?

1614
01:40:35,613 --> 01:40:37,031
I don't know.

1615
01:40:43,371 --> 01:40:45,915
<i>How you doing, Bianca?
What are you doing here?</i>

1616
01:40:46,082 --> 01:40:47,291
<i>Y'all two are killing me.</i>

1617
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:53,464
Oh, and listen.
Would you guys just keep--

1618
01:40:53,631 --> 01:40:54,757
We know.

1619
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:56,008
- Leg thing.
- Yeah.

1620
01:40:56,175 --> 01:40:57,510
- The legs, yeah.
- It's important.

1621
01:40:57,677 --> 01:40:58,761
Got you.

1622
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:05,017
You wanna come in?

1623
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:07,019
<i>Yeah.</i>

1624
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:08,604
Please.

1625
01:41:23,953 --> 01:41:24,996
- I got it.
- Good.

1626
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:26,664
All right.

1627
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:29,458
All right.

1628
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:35,006
<i>A lot of room.</i>

1629
01:41:35,756 --> 01:41:37,800
Didn't we have enough
surprises for one weekend?

1630
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:40,094
That's not me.

1631
01:42:12,168 --> 01:42:14,045
Very nice colors.

1632
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:18,424
Why don't you take 'em into the other room
and see how well they fit.

1633
01:42:21,427 --> 01:42:22,428
Yeah.

1634
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:25,931
Hey, champ.

1635
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:28,601
All right, Donnie. I'm proud of you.

1636
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:30,770
That's gonna bring him luck.

1637
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:56,128
You never been in front of
this many people before, right?

1638
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:57,588
That don't matter.

1639
01:42:57,755 --> 01:42:59,882
You've never been this
far away from home.

1640
01:43:00,049 --> 01:43:01,300
That don't matter.

1641
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:04,553
What matters is
what you leave in that ring

1642
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,597
and what you take back with you.

1643
01:43:06,889 --> 01:43:08,224
You know what that is?

1644
01:43:08,516 --> 01:43:11,352
Pride. And knowing that you did your best.

1645
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:13,270
And you're doing it for yourself.

1646
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:17,775
Not for me, not your father's memory,
but for you.

1647
01:43:18,109 --> 01:43:19,985
I can see in your eyes

1648
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:21,654
you're gonna do it.

1649
01:43:23,614 --> 01:43:24,740
Let's go now.

1650
01:43:24,907 --> 01:43:26,117
Padman.

1651
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:31,622
Fight's right here.

1652
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:35,793
Let's go.

1653
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:40,798
Yeah.

1654
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:42,591
Left hook combination.

1655
01:43:45,136 --> 01:43:46,429
- Yeah.
- Come on, man. There you go!

1656
01:43:46,595 --> 01:43:47,596
Go up top.

1657
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:51,016
All right, guys, it's time.

1658
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:52,935
Let's go win a championship!

1659
01:43:53,102 --> 01:43:55,146
- It's time, baby.
- Let's go, guys.

1660
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:00,359
Come on, man.

1661
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:07,992
Let's go.

1662
01:44:25,843 --> 01:44:27,887
I'd always get nervous during
times like this,

1663
01:44:28,053 --> 01:44:31,140
but that's normal,
and it's gonna give you energy.

1664
01:44:31,307 --> 01:44:33,434
Pretty normal. Very normal.

1665
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,207
Go up there
and show him who you are!

1666
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:44,547
Conlan!

1667
01:46:03,566 --> 01:46:06,110
This is what you wanted,
and what you got.

1668
01:46:06,277 --> 01:46:08,904
And I want you to enjoy it, okay? Do that.

1669
01:46:12,324 --> 01:46:17,246
Conlan! Conlan!

1670
01:47:26,815 --> 01:47:29,777
<i>Hello again. I'm Jim Lampley.
Here comes Ricky Conlan.</i>

1671
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:33,364
<i>100,000 on their feet
for what may conceivably be</i>

1672
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:36,158
<i>his last walk to the ring
for a professional fight.</i>

1673
01:47:36,325 --> 01:47:39,995
<i>Max Kellerman, what chance
does the young American have?</i>

1674
01:47:40,162 --> 01:47:42,539
<i>He's got the name.
That's why he's here tonight.</i>

1675
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:44,291
<i>Does he have the game?</i>

1676
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:47,503
<i>He's Apollo Creed's son,
he's got Rocky Balboa in his corner.</i>

1677
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:49,338
<i>But all the legends in the world</i>

1678
01:47:49,505 --> 01:47:52,299
<i>can't help him tonight if he can't fight.</i>

1679
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:55,886
<i>The question is, can he fight?</i>

1680
01:48:19,076 --> 01:48:21,912
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Goodison Park</i>

1681
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:24,415
<i>here in Liverpool, England,</i>

1682
01:48:24,581 --> 01:48:27,459
<i>where tonight this is the main event.</i>

1683
01:48:27,626 --> 01:48:29,586
<i>Twelve rounds of boxing</i>

1684
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:33,090
<i>for the light heavyweight
championship of the world.</i>

1685
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:35,551
<i>For the thousands in attendance</i>

1686
01:48:35,718 --> 01:48:38,303
<i>and the millions
watching around the world,</i>

1687
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:39,722
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1688
01:48:39,888 --> 01:48:42,349
<i>let's get ready to rumble!</i>

1689
01:48:46,937 --> 01:48:49,857
<i>In the red corner, wearing
the stars and stripes,</i>

1690
01:48:50,024 --> 01:48:54,194
<i>his professional record,
16 fights 16 victories.</i>

1691
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:55,571
<i>The challenger,</i>

1692
01:48:55,738 --> 01:49:01,535
<i>Adonis "Hollywood" Creed!</i>

1693
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:03,871
<i>And fighting out of the blue corner,</i>

1694
01:49:04,038 --> 01:49:05,622
<i>wearing black with blue</i>

1695
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:07,041
<i>with 36 fights,</i>

1696
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:08,876
<i>28 KOs,</i>

1697
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:12,504
<i>he's the light heavyweight
champion of the world,</i>

1698
01:49:12,671 --> 01:49:19,261
<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!</i>

1699
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:27,019
- Okay, let's go.
- Mmm-hmm.

1700
01:49:32,858 --> 01:49:34,777
<i>How you doing, lads?
You know what I expect of you both.</i>

1701
01:49:34,943 --> 01:49:36,278
<i>We talked about it in the locker rooms.</i>

1702
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:39,198
<i>I want you to protect yourselves
and obey my commands at all times.</i>

1703
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:43,410
<i>No low blows, no silly business.
Keep it clean, will you? Understand?</i>

1704
01:49:43,744 --> 01:49:44,912
<i>Touch gloves.</i>

1705
01:49:45,579 --> 01:49:46,872
Nice shorts, boy.

1706
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:49,291
Too bad your daddy ain't here
to fight in them.

1707
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:52,211
You know what?

1708
01:49:52,377 --> 01:49:55,089
You're gonna close his big mouth, okay?

1709
01:49:58,258 --> 01:49:59,676
- You know what to do.
- Mmm-hmm.

1710
01:49:59,843 --> 01:50:02,221
One step, one punch,
one round at a time.

1711
01:50:02,763 --> 01:50:03,889
You got this.

1712
01:50:16,485 --> 01:50:17,945
<i>Round one begins.</i>

1713
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,572
<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan in the black trunks,</i>

1714
01:50:20,739 --> 01:50:23,951
<i>and Adonis Creed
in the red, white and blue.</i>

1715
01:50:24,118 --> 01:50:26,829
<i>Conlan is significantly taller</i>

1716
01:50:26,995 --> 01:50:29,456
<i>and thinks it will be easy to use his jab</i>

1717
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:31,458
<i>to keep young Creed at bay.</i>

1718
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:32,626
<i>You can see right away, Jim,</i>

1719
01:50:32,793 --> 01:50:35,212
<i>how much more relaxed Conlan is.
He's been there before.</i>

1720
01:50:35,379 --> 01:50:36,380
Move your head!

1721
01:50:36,547 --> 01:50:37,589
Keep your left up!

1722
01:50:37,756 --> 01:50:40,551
<i>That kind of nervous energy
can wear you out as the fight goes on.</i>

1723
01:50:40,759 --> 01:50:42,845
<i>Hard left hook by Conlan.
Creed backs off.</i>

1724
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:45,722
<i>It's not easy to just jump
right into the major leagues like this,</i>

1725
01:50:45,931 --> 01:50:47,599
<i>having never fought
an opponent like Conlan.</i>

1726
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:50,185
<i>Of course, there aren't
many fighters like Conlan.</i>

1727
01:50:50,352 --> 01:50:52,855
<i>Creed trying to get
close to Conlan, against the ropes.</i>

1728
01:50:53,147 --> 01:50:55,607
<i>Conlan easily puts distance
between them again.</i>

1729
01:50:56,358 --> 01:50:58,193
<i>Creed lands a jab,
Conlan grins at it.</i>

1730
01:50:58,777 --> 01:51:01,947
<i>Conlan fires a hard body punch,
hits him hard with a right cross</i>

1731
01:51:02,114 --> 01:51:03,740
<i>and backs Creed into the ropes.</i>

1732
01:51:03,907 --> 01:51:05,367
- Break!
- Ref, come on!

1733
01:51:05,617 --> 01:51:06,618
Keep it clean!

1734
01:51:06,785 --> 01:51:08,203
<i>And he gets
a warning from the referee.</i>

1735
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:09,955
<i>Creed kinda
woke him up with that shot</i>

1736
01:51:10,164 --> 01:51:11,790
<i>and Conlan really made him pay for it.</i>

1737
01:51:12,624 --> 01:51:14,251
<i>Creed ready to let his hands go.</i>

1738
01:51:15,627 --> 01:51:17,379
<i>Creed misses and gets hit in return.</i>

1739
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:19,506
To your corner! One!

1740
01:51:19,715 --> 01:51:20,924
<i>Perfect uppercut on the inside.</i>

1741
01:51:21,091 --> 01:51:22,217
- <i>Down goes Creed.</i>
- Two!

1742
01:51:22,384 --> 01:51:23,677
- Three! Four!
- I'm good. I'm good!

1743
01:51:23,844 --> 01:51:24,928
- Five! Six!
- I'm good!

1744
01:51:25,345 --> 01:51:26,346
Shake it off!

1745
01:51:26,555 --> 01:51:28,515
<i>But already
a knockdown for Ricky Conlan.</i>

1746
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:29,808
- Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1747
01:51:29,975 --> 01:51:31,059
- Are you sure?
- I'm good!

1748
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:32,352
Fight!

1749
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:39,026
<i>Conlan lands a shot after the
bell, and round one was all Ricky Conlan.</i>

1750
01:51:39,193 --> 01:51:42,029
Real for you now, boy?
Real for you now?

1751
01:51:45,657 --> 01:51:47,117
- How's the eye?
<i>- Little bloody.</i>

1752
01:51:47,284 --> 01:51:48,869
All right, look. Don't get rattled.

1753
01:51:49,036 --> 01:51:50,120
I'm gonna knock his ass out.

1754
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:51,747
Do it in the next round. Don't wait.

1755
01:51:51,997 --> 01:51:53,373
You keep making mistakes like that,

1756
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:55,334
we're gonna pick you up
with a vacuum cleaner, okay?

1757
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:57,878
<i>Adonis was lucky there wasn't
another 30 seconds in that round.</i>

1758
01:52:00,047 --> 01:52:01,882
Come on, baby. What you doing?

1759
01:52:02,216 --> 01:52:03,717
Here's what I want you to do.

1760
01:52:03,884 --> 01:52:05,844
He's gonna jab and throw the right.

1761
01:52:06,011 --> 01:52:08,722
When he leaves it out there,
drop that right hook and smash him, okay?

1762
01:52:08,889 --> 01:52:10,182
Stay focused.

1763
01:52:10,349 --> 01:52:13,393
<i>So round one was a forbidding
experience for young Adonis Creed.</i>

1764
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:16,480
<i>And now, after a discussion
with Rocky Balboa between rounds,</i>

1765
01:52:16,647 --> 01:52:18,023
<i>he comes in for more.</i>

1766
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:21,568
<i>Conlan showed his power
with the uppercut at the end of round one,</i>

1767
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:24,196
<i>goes back to boxing to begin the second.</i>

1768
01:52:24,363 --> 01:52:26,365
- Be first!
- Keep the pressure on, Rick!

1769
01:52:26,531 --> 01:52:30,702
<i>Logic says Creed needs to find
a way to get inside of Conlan's long arms</i>

1770
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:32,746
<i>and create pressure on the inside.</i>

1771
01:52:32,913 --> 01:52:33,914
Come on! Come on!

1772
01:52:34,081 --> 01:52:36,166
<i>So far, it's still
mostly Ricky Conlan.</i>

1773
01:52:37,542 --> 01:52:39,169
<i>Hard left hook for Conlan, uppercut.</i>

1774
01:52:39,336 --> 01:52:40,420
Keep your hands up!

1775
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:41,755
<i>Drives Creed into the corner again.</i>

1776
01:52:41,922 --> 01:52:43,257
Tie him up!

1777
01:52:44,216 --> 01:52:47,511
<i>Creed wraps him up and
pulls him in to stop the onslaught.</i>

1778
01:52:47,678 --> 01:52:49,429
You the champ, right, huh?

1779
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:50,847
You the champ?

1780
01:52:51,014 --> 01:52:52,391
Show me. Come on!

1781
01:52:54,518 --> 01:52:56,853
<i>There's a perfect
right-hand shot by Creed!</i>

1782
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:58,397
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1783
01:53:01,358 --> 01:53:04,403
<i>Creed misses wildly,
and they are going toe-to-toe.</i>

1784
01:53:04,569 --> 01:53:06,280
<i>Rapidly becoming
a phone booth fight!</i>

1785
01:53:06,446 --> 01:53:07,572
Go! Go!

1786
01:53:07,739 --> 01:53:09,616
<i>Trading punches,
right hand, left hand!</i>

1787
01:53:09,783 --> 01:53:10,867
<i>Both guys landing!</i>

1788
01:53:11,034 --> 01:53:12,536
<i>This is unbelievable action!</i>

1789
01:53:12,703 --> 01:53:13,704
Double hook! Come on!

1790
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:16,081
<i>Hard right hand by Creed.</i>

1791
01:53:16,248 --> 01:53:18,583
- You bleed just like me!
- Go to your corners! Come on!

1792
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:19,751
You bleed just like me!

1793
01:53:19,918 --> 01:53:22,045
Man! That ain't shit!

1794
01:53:22,212 --> 01:53:25,966
<i>He loves it! If Conlan thought
he had a pushover, he knows better now!</i>

1795
01:53:26,133 --> 01:53:27,217
He bleed like me!

1796
01:53:27,384 --> 01:53:28,385
You belong in here!

1797
01:53:28,552 --> 01:53:30,220
They don't know
what you've been through

1798
01:53:30,387 --> 01:53:32,055
and they sure don't know
what we've been through.

1799
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:33,598
I don't want you trading blows with him.

1800
01:53:33,765 --> 01:53:35,559
I want you to protect yourself.

1801
01:53:35,726 --> 01:53:36,768
Keep your distance!

1802
01:53:36,935 --> 01:53:38,228
I'm gonna smash this kid to bits.

1803
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:40,230
Now he knows you're for real.

1804
01:53:40,397 --> 01:53:41,565
You gotta believe you can do it.

1805
01:53:41,732 --> 01:53:43,734
<i>That was such a big round for Creed.</i>

1806
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:46,611
<i>Not just on the scorecards
but psychologically going forward, Jim.</i>

1807
01:53:46,778 --> 01:53:48,238
<i>You woke up a sleeping giant.</i>

1808
01:53:48,405 --> 01:53:50,282
He's gonna come after you
with everything he's got.

1809
01:53:50,449 --> 01:53:52,909
<i>Adonis, looking more
and more comfortable against the champ</i>

1810
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:55,078
<i>seems to have found his rhythm.</i>

1811
01:53:56,455 --> 01:53:57,581
Go finish him off.

1812
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:02,294
<i>This has
devolved into a slugfest!</i>

1813
01:54:02,461 --> 01:54:04,588
- One punch at a time!
- Come on, D!

1814
01:54:05,088 --> 01:54:07,424
<i>Conlan trying to
punish Creed at short range.</i>

1815
01:54:07,591 --> 01:54:08,759
<i>Finish him now!</i>

1816
01:54:08,925 --> 01:54:11,470
<i>Big combination
to end the third by Conlan</i>

1817
01:54:11,636 --> 01:54:13,096
<i>and Creed does not know where he is,</i>

1818
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:14,931
<i>walking to the wrong corner there.</i>

1819
01:54:15,098 --> 01:54:16,099
His arm is long.

1820
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:18,435
Because you're playing his game, Donnie.

1821
01:54:18,602 --> 01:54:19,603
Be patient.

1822
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:21,480
One step, one punch.

1823
01:54:21,646 --> 01:54:23,106
- One round at a time.
- There you go.

1824
01:54:23,273 --> 01:54:25,525
<i>One step, one punch,</i>

1825
01:54:25,776 --> 01:54:26,985
<i>one round at a time.</i>

1826
01:54:27,152 --> 01:54:29,780
<i>Round five of a scheduled 12
and already it's a far different fight</i>

1827
01:54:29,946 --> 01:54:31,114
<i>than most experts expected.</i>

1828
01:54:31,281 --> 01:54:32,282
He's just a pretender.

1829
01:54:32,449 --> 01:54:34,284
He's lucky to be in the same
ring with you hitting him.

1830
01:54:34,451 --> 01:54:35,452
Remember that.

1831
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:36,912
<i>Adonis Creed has succeeded in</i>

1832
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:39,748
<i>pressuring Ricky Conlan
and making him fight.</i>

1833
01:55:03,063 --> 01:55:04,898
<i>Creed has
proven plenty in this fight.</i>

1834
01:55:05,065 --> 01:55:06,900
<i>He's taken it, he's given it back.</i>

1835
01:55:07,067 --> 01:55:08,819
<i>But he does not look like a match</i>

1836
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:10,821
<i>for the best pound-for-pound
fighter in the world.</i>

1837
01:55:10,987 --> 01:55:13,281
You're going through hell out there
but you're hurting him, too.

1838
01:55:13,448 --> 01:55:14,658
I can see it in his eyes.

1839
01:55:14,825 --> 01:55:16,326
<i>You're not as far behind as you think.</i>

1840
01:55:16,535 --> 01:55:18,495
Shorten that jab, shorten the distance,

1841
01:55:18,662 --> 01:55:20,705
get underneath him,
and you'll be able to rip him.

1842
01:55:20,872 --> 01:55:22,165
<i>You gotta push him back.</i>

1843
01:55:22,332 --> 01:55:25,001
<i>Most critics didn't think
Creed could make it this far.</i>

1844
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:26,294
Donnie, step under!

1845
01:55:28,422 --> 01:55:30,006
- Yes!
- Come on, Ricky!

1846
01:55:30,173 --> 01:55:32,592
<i>There are moments
when Creed is assertively taking over.</i>

1847
01:55:32,759 --> 01:55:35,846
<i>But there's a hard counter right,
drives Creed back into the corner.</i>

1848
01:55:36,012 --> 01:55:38,014
<i>Just when it appears Creed
might be taking control</i>

1849
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:40,100
<i>Conlan comes close to knocking him down.</i>

1850
01:55:40,267 --> 01:55:41,351
Use that pressure.

1851
01:55:41,518 --> 01:55:42,561
You are the one
that's in the driving seat.

1852
01:55:42,727 --> 01:55:44,104
He's not used to this level, all right?

1853
01:55:44,271 --> 01:55:45,689
Get 'em on the rope.

1854
01:55:45,856 --> 01:55:47,399
Get 'em on the rope! Deep breath.

1855
01:55:47,566 --> 01:55:48,608
Boy's fast.

1856
01:55:48,775 --> 01:55:50,902
Hey! It's you against you.

1857
01:55:51,153 --> 01:55:52,529
- Me against me.
- That's right.

1858
01:55:52,696 --> 01:55:53,905
- He's just in your way.
- Got it.

1859
01:55:54,072 --> 01:55:55,407
Get him out of the way!
Let's go!

1860
01:55:55,574 --> 01:55:58,952
<i>Not only is young
Adonis Creed still in the ring,</i>

1861
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:01,121
<i>he may be in the fight.</i>

1862
01:56:02,998 --> 01:56:05,125
<i>Hard left hand by Creed.</i>

1863
01:56:05,417 --> 01:56:07,711
<i>Conlan was an overwhelmingly
heavy favorite</i>

1864
01:56:07,878 --> 01:56:11,715
<i>pounding young Creed with right hands
as you saw right there.</i>

1865
01:56:14,759 --> 01:56:16,386
Bring back everything
that's ever hurt you.

1866
01:56:16,553 --> 01:56:19,639
<i>All the pain you had inside,
everything that held you back.</i>

1867
01:56:19,806 --> 01:56:23,810
<i>Put it in both fists, and I want you
to drive it through his body</i>

1868
01:56:23,977 --> 01:56:26,229
and I promise you, his head will fall.

1869
01:56:26,563 --> 01:56:27,606
<i>We're
into the part of the fight</i>

1870
01:56:27,814 --> 01:56:29,816
<i>where all your instincts come into play.</i>

1871
01:56:30,025 --> 01:56:34,070
<i>Most experts expected that Conlan
would avoid trading shots with Creed</i>

1872
01:56:34,404 --> 01:56:36,323
<i>but he's trading willingly.</i>

1873
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:37,908
<i>Creed fires a hard body punch.</i>

1874
01:56:38,074 --> 01:56:39,493
<i>Conlan in trouble!</i>

1875
01:56:39,951 --> 01:56:41,620
- <i>Hard left hand to the body.</i>
- Oh, yeah!

1876
01:56:42,412 --> 01:56:44,122
<i>The champ is in bad shape, Jim.</i>

1877
01:56:44,289 --> 01:56:46,249
<i>Creed realized
he has a better chance</i>

1878
01:56:46,416 --> 01:56:48,585
<i>of hurting Conlan to the
body than to the head!</i>

1879
01:56:49,628 --> 01:56:50,670
<i>- What an uppercut!</i>
- No!

1880
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:53,340
<i>And Creed staggers back.</i>

1881
01:56:53,673 --> 01:56:54,674
Body! Body!

1882
01:56:55,509 --> 01:56:57,344
<i>To the body, trading shots!</i>

1883
01:56:57,511 --> 01:56:58,512
<i>Pawing with his jab,</i>

1884
01:56:58,678 --> 01:56:59,763
<i>Creed looks to land one big shot.</i>

1885
01:56:59,930 --> 01:57:01,264
<i>Move your legs!</i>

1886
01:57:27,832 --> 01:57:29,125
Donnie, get up!

1887
01:57:31,211 --> 01:57:32,379
Get up, D!

1888
01:57:34,214 --> 01:57:35,215
Come on, baby.

1889
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:44,224
<i>Stitch!</i>

1890
01:57:51,856 --> 01:57:53,400
<i>Creed just got up</i>

1891
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:54,734
- <i>like a man possessed.</i>
- You okay? Look at me!

1892
01:57:54,901 --> 01:57:55,986
<i>- He was out!</i>
- Donnie!

1893
01:57:56,152 --> 01:57:58,697
<i>Down but not out.
Conlan thinks he's celebrating a knockout.</i>

1894
01:57:58,947 --> 01:58:00,323
Get down! He's getting up!

1895
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:02,492
<i>But the referee
is dusting Creed's gloves.</i>

1896
01:58:02,659 --> 01:58:03,702
You're good.

1897
01:58:03,868 --> 01:58:07,289
<i>Creed beats the count
and the action begins again.</i>

1898
01:58:07,455 --> 01:58:08,873
<i>That's the heart of a champion.</i>

1899
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,625
<i>He has his daddy's heart,
I'll tell you that much.</i>

1900
01:58:10,875 --> 01:58:12,002
Donnie, be ready!

1901
01:58:12,168 --> 01:58:15,213
<i>More work to do for
Conlan. Body shot. Body shot.</i>

1902
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:17,048
<i>Trying to set Creed up one more time.</i>

1903
01:58:17,215 --> 01:58:18,550
<i>Tie him up, for Christ's sake!</i>

1904
01:58:21,886 --> 01:58:24,514
<i>Stitch has done
a great job over that right eye</i>

1905
01:58:24,681 --> 01:58:26,891
<i>but now the left eye
looks like it's almost shut.</i>

1906
01:58:27,058 --> 01:58:28,226
<i>Closing up.</i>

1907
01:58:28,893 --> 01:58:30,270
- Rock, is he okay?
- You have to go back to...

1908
01:58:30,437 --> 01:58:31,855
Stay there, Bianca, it's okay.

1909
01:58:32,022 --> 01:58:33,690
I'm cool, man, I'm cool!

1910
01:58:34,107 --> 01:58:35,191
I'm good.

1911
01:58:35,358 --> 01:58:36,359
- You're good?
- Yeah, man, all right?

1912
01:58:36,526 --> 01:58:37,611
- You sure about that?
- I am. I'm good.

1913
01:58:37,777 --> 01:58:40,196
<i>He's taken a lot of punishment
to both the body and the head.</i>

1914
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:41,906
<i>Left eye completely closed.</i>

1915
01:58:42,073 --> 01:58:43,366
- I'm gonna stop this thing.
- No!

1916
01:58:43,533 --> 01:58:44,868
Let me see the eye.

1917
01:58:45,201 --> 01:58:47,162
Time! Doc, give him a look!

1918
01:58:47,787 --> 01:58:49,706
All right. Show me your eye.

1919
01:58:49,873 --> 01:58:51,541
Show me your eye, Adonis!

1920
01:58:51,708 --> 01:58:53,043
How many fingers?

1921
01:58:53,418 --> 01:58:54,419
How many fingers?

1922
01:58:55,128 --> 01:58:56,296
How many, Adonis?

1923
01:58:56,463 --> 01:58:58,131
- Four.
- And again.

1924
01:58:59,257 --> 01:59:00,383
Two.

1925
01:59:01,134 --> 01:59:02,177
<i>Time in!</i>

1926
01:59:02,385 --> 01:59:03,970
All right. Breathe through your mouth.

1927
01:59:04,137 --> 01:59:06,056
Deep breaths, kid, deep.

1928
01:59:06,222 --> 01:59:07,557
You are up on the cards,
you're winning this.

1929
01:59:07,724 --> 01:59:08,725
You are gonna win this!

1930
01:59:08,892 --> 01:59:10,393
But just keep smart
and keep away from him.

1931
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,729
He's going to sleep this time.
He's going out this round.

1932
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:14,230
I should've stopped
the fight with your father.

1933
01:59:14,397 --> 01:59:15,607
I'm stopping this one now.

1934
01:59:15,774 --> 01:59:17,400
Don't, okay? Let me finish.

1935
01:59:18,068 --> 01:59:19,903
- I gotta prove it.
- Prove what?

1936
01:59:20,904 --> 01:59:22,155
I'm not a mistake.

1937
01:59:26,576 --> 01:59:28,912
Look at me. I never got a chance
to thank Apollo

1938
01:59:29,079 --> 01:59:31,289
for helping me out after Mickey died.

1939
01:59:31,456 --> 01:59:33,583
But it's nothing compared
to what you've done.

1940
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:35,251
You taught me how to fight again

1941
01:59:35,418 --> 01:59:37,170
and I'm gonna go home
and I'm gonna fight this thing.

1942
01:59:37,337 --> 01:59:39,297
But if I fight, I want you to fight, too.

1943
01:59:39,464 --> 01:59:41,257
I want you to go across this ring

1944
01:59:41,424 --> 01:59:44,094
and knock that son of a bitch down.
Can you do it?

1945
01:59:44,803 --> 01:59:45,845
Say it.

1946
01:59:46,012 --> 01:59:47,514
I'm gonna knock that son of a bitch down.

1947
01:59:47,681 --> 01:59:48,932
I know you are. You know why?

1948
01:59:49,099 --> 01:59:50,934
Because you're a Creed
and I love you, kid.

1949
01:59:51,101 --> 01:59:52,102
- I love you too.
- Go on.

1950
01:59:52,268 --> 01:59:53,520
All right, baby, let's go.

1951
01:59:57,023 --> 01:59:58,441
<i>Go get him, Donnie!</i>

1952
02:00:02,153 --> 02:00:03,988
<i>Round 12 begins.</i>

1953
02:00:04,155 --> 02:00:07,951
<i>Virtually no one outside of Adonis Creed's
family and group of friends</i>

1954
02:00:08,118 --> 02:00:09,869
<i>would ever have expected to see him</i>

1955
02:00:10,036 --> 02:00:12,622
<i>in a 12th round against
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan</i>

1956
02:00:12,789 --> 02:00:15,166
<i>and trading shots as they come
to these last three minutes.</i>

1957
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:18,628
<i>And there's
a hard left hook upstairs.</i>

1958
02:00:19,129 --> 02:00:20,130
Yeah!

1959
02:00:20,463 --> 02:00:22,966
<i>Every time you wanna say
it's the beginning of the end</i>

1960
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:26,469
<i>the other guy comes through
with a shot you can't believe.</i>

1961
02:00:27,137 --> 02:00:28,513
<i>Hard right hand by Conlan.</i>

1962
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:30,056
Come on! Don't sit there!

1963
02:00:30,724 --> 02:00:34,227
<i>They're trading shots
in the kind of back and forth action</i>

1964
02:00:34,519 --> 02:00:36,980
<i>that most of us
didn't expect to see.</i>

1965
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:40,191
<i>Creed getting hit</i>

1966
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:42,861
<i>with some hard shots
but landing some of his own,</i>

1967
02:00:43,027 --> 02:00:44,738
<i>and Adonis is firing back!</i>

1968
02:00:45,196 --> 02:00:47,031
<i>Another pitched battle
between the two warriors.</i>

1969
02:00:47,198 --> 02:00:48,992
- Ricky, nail him!
- Come on, kid!

1970
02:00:51,161 --> 02:00:53,371
<i>Creed spins,
puts the champ in the corner!</i>

1971
02:00:53,538 --> 02:00:54,664
Body! Body!

1972
02:00:55,206 --> 02:00:57,834
<i>Throwing body shots
like he's Rocky Balboa!</i>

1973
02:00:58,168 --> 02:01:00,253
<i>Going upstairs like he's Apollo Creed!</i>

1974
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:01,504
Knock his ass out!

1975
02:01:01,671 --> 02:01:03,506
<i>Closing seconds of the fight!</i>

1976
02:01:04,048 --> 02:01:05,091
<i>Ricky!</i>

1977
02:01:06,551 --> 02:01:07,552
That's what I'm talking about!

1978
02:01:08,094 --> 02:01:09,512
<i>Conlan is down!</i>

1979
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:13,099
<i>That is the first time in his career
he's been on the canvas.</i>

1980
02:01:13,266 --> 02:01:16,936
<i>You cannot be saved by the bell
in the 12th and final round.</i>

1981
02:01:17,604 --> 02:01:19,272
- Ricky, get up!
- Stay down!

1982
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:21,024
- Stay down!
- Six!

1983
02:01:21,191 --> 02:01:22,692
<i>- Dramatic count in Liverpool.</i>
- Seven! Eight!

1984
02:01:22,859 --> 02:01:25,028
<i>He must get up
to preserve his chance to win the fight.</i>

1985
02:01:25,195 --> 02:01:26,196
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

1986
02:01:26,362 --> 02:01:27,530
- Look at me!
- I'm all right!

1987
02:01:27,697 --> 02:01:28,698
- He's up!
- What?

1988
02:01:28,865 --> 02:01:29,866
<i>The bell sounds,</i>

1989
02:01:30,033 --> 02:01:32,202
<i>so Conlan survives the 12th round!</i>

1990
02:01:32,368 --> 02:01:33,787
<i>What a finish!</i>

1991
02:01:33,953 --> 02:01:37,373
<i>If that round goes another 30 seconds,
we may have a new champion.</i>

1992
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:40,710
<i>An unforgettable fight
on an unforgettable night!</i>

1993
02:01:40,877 --> 02:01:43,505
<i>He's no longer just the namesake
of Apollo Creed,</i>

1994
02:01:43,671 --> 02:01:45,381
<i>he's the living embodiment.</i>

1995
02:01:45,548 --> 02:01:46,549
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1996
02:01:46,716 --> 02:01:50,720
<i>a round of applause for
these two warriors in the ring!</i>

1997
02:01:51,721 --> 02:01:54,057
<i>To the winner by split decision</i>

1998
02:01:56,142 --> 02:01:58,978
<i>and still the undefeated
champion of the world...</i>

1999
02:01:59,145 --> 02:02:00,563
You did great, kid.

2000
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:02,273
<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!</i>

2001
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:03,566
Donnie, you were robbed.

2002
02:02:03,733 --> 02:02:06,277
If this fight had been
10 seconds longer--

2003
02:02:06,569 --> 02:02:07,821
10 seconds longer--

2004
02:02:07,987 --> 02:02:08,988
<i>Creed.</i>

2005
02:02:12,909 --> 02:02:14,244
You go and get it, chum.

2006
02:02:14,410 --> 02:02:15,745
You the future of this division.

2007
02:02:15,912 --> 02:02:17,288
You wear that name with pride.

2008
02:02:17,747 --> 02:02:18,915
Respect.

2009
02:02:19,666 --> 02:02:22,544
Congratulations, Adonis,
on a sensational effort.

2010
02:02:22,752 --> 02:02:25,588
I just wanna thank my mom.
She's at home. I love you.

2011
02:02:25,755 --> 02:02:27,257
Even though I know she's
mad at me for doing this.

2012
02:02:27,465 --> 02:02:28,925
<i>Hopefully I made her proud.</i>

2013
02:02:29,092 --> 02:02:31,594
You almost gave me a heart
attack but I'm proud of you.

2014
02:02:31,761 --> 02:02:32,929
I got my family right here.

2015
02:02:33,096 --> 02:02:35,098
Without them,
none of this would've been possible.

2016
02:02:36,307 --> 02:02:40,186
Rocky, Apollo Creed's son
looks at you and says family.

2017
02:02:40,353 --> 02:02:41,354
What does that mean to you?

2018
02:02:41,521 --> 02:02:44,607
It means I'm a lucky guy.
What can I say, right, kid?

2019
02:02:44,941 --> 02:02:48,945
He's a real fighter,
and he's helping me fight a few things,

2020
02:02:49,112 --> 02:02:50,864
so I appreciate it. I really do.

2021
02:02:51,531 --> 02:02:54,367
Adonis, I know you never met your father.

2022
02:02:54,534 --> 02:02:57,120
But if he was here tonight,
what would you wanna say to him?

2023
02:03:01,374 --> 02:03:03,585
I'll just tell him that I love him

2024
02:03:04,294 --> 02:03:06,629
and I know he didn't leave me on purpose.

2025
02:03:07,463 --> 02:03:10,466
And I'm proud to be a Creed.

2026
02:03:12,468 --> 02:03:16,681
Thanks, Adonis, and congratulations
on a sensational performance. Jim.

2027
02:03:16,890 --> 02:03:20,143
Creed! Creed! Creed!

2028
02:03:24,397 --> 02:03:25,398
Go on.

2029
02:03:25,815 --> 02:03:28,151
Talk to them. Go on!

2030
02:03:50,006 --> 02:03:52,175
<i>This crowd is up on its feet.</i>

2031
02:03:52,342 --> 02:03:54,344
<i>No one wants to leave the arena.</i>

2032
02:03:54,510 --> 02:03:57,639
<i>Everyone in here knows
they've seen something special.</i>

2033
02:03:57,805 --> 02:03:59,390
<i>A fight they'll never forget.</i>

2034
02:03:59,766 --> 02:04:01,893
<i>Ricky Conlan wins the fight.</i>

2035
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:04,604
<i>Adonis Creed wins the night.</i>

2036
02:04:24,707 --> 02:04:26,042
This is it?

2037
02:04:26,918 --> 02:04:27,961
Yeah.

2038
02:04:31,839 --> 02:04:34,050
I just wanna see
if I can get up these steps.

2039
02:04:34,467 --> 02:04:35,885
When's the
first time you came here?

2040
02:04:36,177 --> 02:04:37,720
I was 12.

2041
02:04:39,097 --> 02:04:41,557
I think it's my favorite place.

2042
02:04:47,397 --> 02:04:49,273
When you get to the top

2043
02:04:50,566 --> 02:04:52,235
you think you can fly.

2044
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:12,255
Almost there.

2045
02:05:13,256 --> 02:05:14,757
You got this.

2046
02:05:22,015 --> 02:05:23,266
Come on, young man.

2047
02:05:23,433 --> 02:05:24,517
Just let me catch my breath.

2048
02:05:24,684 --> 02:05:26,686
Come on, no breaks.
We rest at the top.

2049
02:05:26,853 --> 02:05:28,187
Just a minute.

2050
02:05:28,771 --> 02:05:30,690
Nah, this is what you asked for, right?

2051
02:05:30,857 --> 02:05:32,775
Let's go. One step at a time.

2052
02:05:34,152 --> 02:05:35,361
Yeah.

2053
02:05:36,696 --> 02:05:37,864
Come on.

2054
02:05:39,866 --> 02:05:43,369
One step at a time. Who told you that?

2055
02:05:43,786 --> 02:05:44,954
Some old guy.

2056
02:05:45,121 --> 02:05:47,540
You know I meant that for you, not for me.

2057
02:05:50,626 --> 02:05:53,463
I think they
added a few more steps.

2058
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:56,340
- I don't know.
- Almost there.

2059
02:05:56,507 --> 02:05:57,967
I'm gonna take these last two.

2060
02:05:58,134 --> 02:05:59,677
One more step.

2061
02:05:59,886 --> 02:06:00,928
How you feeling?

2062
02:06:01,137 --> 02:06:03,639
Oh, good. Really good.

2063
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:10,646
You all right there, old man?

2064
02:06:10,813 --> 02:06:11,981
Yeah.

2065
02:06:12,982 --> 02:06:14,484
Nice view.

2066
02:06:18,654 --> 02:06:22,658
If you look hard enough,
you can see your whole life from up here.

2067
02:06:22,825 --> 02:06:24,327
How does it look?

2068
02:06:24,494 --> 02:06:27,830
Not bad at all. And you?

2069
02:06:27,997 --> 02:06:29,665
Not bad at all.

2070
02:11:53,989 --> 02:11:56,325
<i>You see this guy here
staring back at you?</i>

2071
02:11:56,992 --> 02:11:58,661
<i>That's your toughest opponent.</i>

2072
02:12:00,371 --> 02:12:01,997
<i>Every time
you get into the ring,</i>

2073
02:12:02,164 --> 02:12:03,916
<i>that's who
you're going against.</i>

2074
02:12:04,750 --> 02:12:06,502
<i>I believe that in boxing</i>

2075
02:12:06,669 --> 02:12:08,754
<i>and I do believe that
in life, okay?</i>

2076
02:12:10,673 --> 02:12:12,383
<i>Nobody showed me
how to do this.</i>

2077
02:12:12,550 --> 02:12:13,843
<i>I'm ready.</i>
