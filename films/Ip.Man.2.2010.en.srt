1
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:06,527
Thanks to Zhou Qingquan,
the wounded Ip Man and his wife

2
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,090
managed to escape from Foshan

3
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,565
Hong Kong, 1950
Here we are, Brother Ip.

4
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,102
Sorry for all the hassle.

5
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,300
Not at all.
We're from the same village.

6
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,239
It's been vacated for
a few months only.

7
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,404
I talked to the neighbors.
They're very nice.

8
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,137
Thanks so much, Kan.

9
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,085
See if it's suitable for
your martial club.

10
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,988
It's pretty spacious.
Is it big enough?

11
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,324
Enough.

12
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,499
It's very spacious.

13
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,228
Day 8

14
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,846
Master Ip.

15
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,543
You haven't recruited
any pupils today?

16
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,512
What's the matter, Auntie?

17
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:48,391
It's a big space.
Can I dry my clothes here?

18
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,685
Please go ahead.

19
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,041
Wing Sing!

20
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:41,278
I told you to leave the
heavy stuff to me!

21
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,145
You're pregnant!
You shouldn't do that!

22
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,179
There'd be no more water
had I waited for you.

23
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,050
Next time I'll be back sooner,
all right?

24
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,787
I told you not to
exhaust yourself.

25
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,189
Are you all right?
Feeling better?

26
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,161
Mom, I need to pay my school
fees in two days.

27
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,199
Wait.

28
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,774
Who is it?

29
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,905
Time to pay your rent!
Mr Ip! Mrs Ip!

30
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,883
I don't have the cash.
Don't open the door!

31
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,383
Mr Ip! Mrs Ip!

32
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:42,736
Day 9

33
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,723
No pupils yet today,
Master Ip?

34
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,928
I'll dry my clothes then.

35
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,267
Auntie.

36
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,004
Let me help you.

37
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,567
You help me?

38
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,664
It's no big deal.

39
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,403
Thanks.

40
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,794
Hello!

41
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,392
You teach Wing Chun?

42
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,599
Master! Someone wants
to learn martial arts!

43
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,343
You want to learn
martial arts?

44
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,782
Just checking out.

45
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,576
I don't know what
Wing Chun is.

46
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,654
Let me give you
an introduction.

47
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,053
As a matter of fact,
Wing Chun...

48
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,647
is a close combat style
from the South...

49
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,488
No need to tell me
all these.

50
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,525
Let's fight. I'll pay you
school fees if I lose.

51
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,032
OK.

52
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,946
I'm Ip Man of Wing Chun.

53
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,695
So?

54
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,995
You haven't beaten
me yet.

55
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,563
Are you ready to
accept defeat?

56
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,066
Ready for what?

57
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,726
I've no idea what
you're doing.

58
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,177
Do you have some
idea now?

59
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:49,793
Master Ip, I never knew
you're so great!

60
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,329
Incredible!

61
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,891
Young man, hurry and
accept him as your master!

62
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,000
You can pay me the school
fees now, right?

63
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,647
Why are you leaving,
young man?

64
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,411
What to do now, Master Ip?

65
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,043
You finally got
a potential pupil

66
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,521
but now he's gone!

67
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,232
That's him.

68
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,377
Can this uncle be that
good in martial arts?

69
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,641
Are you kidding me?

70
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,309
He looks totally harmless.

71
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,319
He actually resembles
a laundryman.

72
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,415
You're not really here
to learn martial arts.

73
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,689
Go away!

74
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,759
OK! We're challenging
you to a fight!

75
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,865
No need to take it off.

76
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,591
What are you
talking about?

77
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,329
Nothing.

78
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,471
Asking Hand.

79
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,161
I told you not to take
your clothes off.

80
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,897
Master!

81
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,697
Please accept me, Wong Leung,
as your pupil!

82
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,078
In that case...

83
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:50,877
Master!

84
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,848
I'm Tsui Sai-cheung.

85
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,316
Ngai Kwok-hing.
Wong Kwun.

86
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,910
Please accept us as your pupils!

87
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,713
I'm his first pupil.
You call me Big Bro.

88
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,149
Pour some tea
for the Master.

89
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,128
Forget the ceremony!

90
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,289
Pay your school fees first.

91
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,399
Pay your school fees first.

92
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:16,404
Wing Chun combines
defense and attack.

93
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,872
You attack and fight

94
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:22,243
to beat your opponent
as quickly as possible.

95
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,208
Look! This is "Dispersing Hand."

96
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,749
Dispersing Hand.

97
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,481
Simultaneous defense and attack.

98
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,354
Got it?

99
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,525
Who is Master Ip?

100
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,029
Master!
Master!

101
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,830
Leung! Did you ask
them to come?

102
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,587
Master, can you beat ten men
at the same time?

103
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,065
It's better not to fight.

104
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,095
Continue your practice.

105
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,732
What if so many men really
come with weapons?

106
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,569
Flee.

107
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,044
You should collect school
fees from them.

108
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,051
I know.

109
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,055
You say that
all the time.

110
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,891
I'll collect them later.

111
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,022
Everyone, stop for a minute.

112
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,758
What's the matter?

113
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,766
Master.
Master.

114
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,166
It's time to pay
your school fees.

115
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,833
What is it?

116
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,669
Time to pay your
school fees.

117
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,675
Whoever with cash
can pay me first.

118
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,112
Master...
Master...

119
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,573
Master, I'll pay
2 dollars first.

120
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,550
My mom is... short of cash.

121
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,450
So I'll pay the
rest next time.

122
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,887
Next time, then...

123
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,048
Master, I only have
this much...

124
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,421
Next time, then!

125
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,688
Go home and eat!

126
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,224
Thank you, Master!

127
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,693
So little!
What should we do?

128
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,893
I can't help it!

129
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,806
You know the
economy is bad.

130
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,503
When my pupils
ask me to help out,

131
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,806
as their master,
I can only agree.

132
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,338
We better ask the landlady
to cut us some slack.

133
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,315
Sure, ask her to cut
us some slack.

134
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,646
I accommodate you;
you accommodate me.

135
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,152
Everything will be OK, right?

136
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,021
Excuse me, two pieces of cake,
please.

137
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,483
You want an egg tart?

138
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,062
No thanks.

139
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,760
Don't run!
Stop!

140
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,134
You dared to steal
a roast duck?

141
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,466
You asshole!

142
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,436
Stop eating!
Give it back to me!

143
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,168
Stop beating him...
Pay up!

144
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,372
I don't have the money.

145
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,910
I'll take your dad
if you don't pay up.

146
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,412
No, please let him go.

147
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,846
Give me!
No!

148
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:11,883
Stop it! Stop it!

149
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,511
Stop beating him!
What's the matter?

150
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,581
He stole our roast duck!

151
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:17,883
I'll pay for him!

152
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,788
Give it back!
I'll pay for him.

153
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,487
Let's go.

154
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,721
Quan!

155
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,559
Uncle Man, I know
where my dad is.

156
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,962
Take me to him!

157
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,167
He's here.

158
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:54,856
Quan.

159
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,021
He can't recognize anyone,
Uncle Man.

160
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,827
The Japanese had put
a bullet in his head.

161
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,931
He can't recognize
who you are.

162
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,041
Quan.

163
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,646
Quan, I'm Ip Man. Quan!

164
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,142
Scram, you Jap!
Quan...

165
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,621
Scram, you Jap! Scram!

166
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,439
Let's go, Uncle Man.

167
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,646
It's my fault.

168
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,815
It's not your fault, Uncle Man.
It's my fault.

169
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,692
Let's go.

170
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,160
He rather be homeless
than comes with me.

171
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,500
So I stay here to keep
him company.

172
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:21,306
When I manage to work
at a restaurant,

173
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,613
I can give him some
leftovers to eat.

174
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:28,050
Otherwise, he would
have to starve.

175
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,918
Don't worry, Yau.

176
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,687
We'll take care of
your dad together.

177
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,032
I'll employ anyone
recommended by Ip.

178
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,163
If you can write for me
for half the wages,

179
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,137
you can start right away.

180
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,341
No problem.

181
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,876
Sit. I'll find someone
to give you some work.

182
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,676
Please stay, Ip.

183
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,077
Let's have some tea later.

184
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,439
Thank you!

185
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,506
You're welcome.
Take a seat.

186
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,543
All right.

187
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,177
Thank you, Uncle Man.

188
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:05,485
You better work hard, Yau!

189
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:06,888
I will.

190
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,450
World Boxing Championship
Tournament in Hong Kong

191
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,397
Wanna learn martial arts?
I take you there later.

192
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,372
I practice Hung Kuen.
Learning from you?

193
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:31,409
If not, then why did you
tear off my bill?

194
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,417
I don't care who you are.

195
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,943
Your bill was on
top of my poster.

196
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,060
Want to know what
Wing Chun is?

197
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,959
You want me to beat
you up?

198
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,972
One on one.
I'm not going to bully you.

199
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,097
You guys don't interfere.

200
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:55,873
OK!

201
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,341
And no eyes or throat!

202
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,343
Cut the bullshit.
I'm in a hurry.

203
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:49,794
Do you accept defeat?

204
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,727
No!

205
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,195
No?

206
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,561
Do you accept defeat?

207
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,098
The Dispersing Hands should stay
in the center.

208
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,436
Relax.

209
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,372
Relax more.

210
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,085
Who is Ip Man?

211
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,650
What's the matter?

212
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,349
Your pupil Wong Leung
has injured our man.

213
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,447
He's in our hands.

214
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,459
Go pay your ransom in the
fish market Lee Hung Kee.

215
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,360
Let's go!

216
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,105
Lee Hung Kee

217
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,286
Kei!

218
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,189
You are his master?

219
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,790
Correct.

220
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,237
Mr...

221
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,199
I think it's just
a misunderstanding.

222
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,234
Let's talk.

223
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,141
Can you release
my pupil first?

224
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,513
Release him!

225
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,755
Leung, are you all right?

226
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:36,958
I'm fine.

227
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,690
Why did you
injure him?

228
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,323
He wanted to fight but
wasn't as good as me.

229
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,000
I couldn't really help it,
could I?

230
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,491
What did you say?
I'm not as good as you?

231
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,127
Take it easy!

232
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,640
You're both young men.

233
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:52,237
Injuries are inevitable
in friendly fights.

234
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:56,375
I'll visit your master
and explain to him.

235
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,006
May I know
who your master is?

236
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,984
Doesn't matter.
He's better than you anyway.

237
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,681
By the way, did you
bring the ransom?

238
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,058
No.

239
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,088
Take it easy.

240
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,425
Beat him up!

241
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:25,668
Master! Watch out
for your back!

242
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,285
Strike him down.

243
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,076
Master.

244
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,274
Come!

245
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,467
Leung!

246
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,565
Master! I'm here!

247
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:52,815
So you really can fight
ten men at once.

248
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,154
Wait till we have
escaped first.

249
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,201
Follow me closely.

250
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,400
Follow me closely!

251
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,205
Leung, let's go!

252
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,075
Go!

253
00:25:58,623 --> 00:25:59,920
Jin Shanzhau?

254
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,231
Don't move!

255
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,797
What are you doing?

256
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,412
Master Ip,

257
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,005
you guys go!

258
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,425
Thank you!

259
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,628
Screw you!

260
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,189
What's going on?

261
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,741
Master!

262
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,005
Have you caused
trouble again?

263
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,414
No, Master!

264
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,883
We were fighting...

265
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,613
and he brought
his Master.

266
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:07,755
Jin Shanzhau!

267
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,189
You think you're in
charge here?

268
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,694
Not at all.

269
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:15,062
Mr Hung, let's talk.

270
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,766
You're armed but you
want to talk?

271
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,098
It's not that.

272
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,830
This asshole stirred things
up on my turf.

273
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,464
That's why I...

274
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,572
Where's your turf?

275
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,937
This road is mine,
so is that piece of dump.

276
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,614
Come, say it again.

277
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,445
Whose turf is this?

278
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,617
It's all Mr Hung's!

279
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,653
Get lost!
None of your business here!

280
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,165
Which school are you from?

281
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,340
How are you,
Mr Hung?

282
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,811
I'm Ip Man...

283
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,245
from Foshan Wing Chun.

284
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:06,149
That's how it happened...

285
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,208
Your pupil and mine
had a friendly fight.

286
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:11,653
My pupil was too strong
and injured yours,

287
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:12,553
but he...

288
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,091
You mean Wing Chun is
better than Hung Kuen?

289
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,719
I didn't mean that,
Master Hung.

290
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,692
Who permitted you to teach
martial arts?

291
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,127
Do you know the rules?

292
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,756
I really don't know
the rules.

293
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,666
You don't know?
Let me tell you then.

294
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,796
You are to be open to
anyone's challenge.

295
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,067
If you aren't beaten when
the incense burns out,

296
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,904
then you are qualified
to teach.

297
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,080
Those are the rules of the
martial clubs.

298
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,279
You got it now?

299
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,026
Cut the speech.

300
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,256
Martial clubs have rules,
so do police stations.

301
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,296
I'm arresting you for inflicting
injuries to others.

302
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:57,425
One, two.

303
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,333
Cuff these two bums and
take them back.

304
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,304
I have another pair here.
Take him too.

305
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,236
Me?

306
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,205
Master!

307
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,037
Go!
Go!

308
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,410
Go!

309
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,181
Take your stuff.
The foreigner is waiting.

310
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:23,756
Sir!

311
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,358
My friends!

312
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,365
Welcome! Have a seat!

313
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,827
You have a little something
for me?

314
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,905
Your money stinks.

315
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,002
But I like it.

316
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,407
So how is the boxing
competition going?

317
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,276
We sold a lot of ticket.

318
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:48,852
It sells very well,
no problem.

319
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,046
Well Done!

320
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,215
What about manpower
and security?

321
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,925
He asked you about manpower
and security.

322
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,929
All taken care of.
No problem.

323
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,932
Great! Thank you!

324
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,265
What will be my cut
in this competition?

325
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,735
Leave us first.

326
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,511
Let me handle it.
I know how to negotiate.

327
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,421
How much should we
give him, boss?

328
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,482
You tell me.
I'll tell Master Hung.

329
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,323
I'm not gonna talk about
that now, thank you.

330
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,656
You've done well,
that's all.

331
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:48,445
Don't worry. The cops are
just showing off.

332
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,208
Everything will be fine
after the bail.

333
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:57,816
Master Jin, so sorry to have
involved you today.

334
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,985
So sorry to have involved
you today.

335
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,026
Wait.

336
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:04,459
This ear has been deaf
since it's hit by your rod.

337
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,461
What did you say?

338
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,693
I said so sorry to have
involved you today.

339
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,466
That's all right.

340
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,628
If you hadn't hit me
with a rod

341
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,228
at the cotton mill that year,

342
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,034
who knows what I'd be doing
in Hong Kong.

343
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,442
Police! Open up!

344
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,504
Open up!

345
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,316
What's the matter?

346
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,579
May I speak to
Ip Man's family?

347
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,245
I am his wife.

348
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,222
Your husband's arrested
for injuring others.

349
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,952
Please bail him out
as soon as possible.

350
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,866
Mr Leung!

351
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:48,537
Mr Leung!

352
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,073
What is it?

353
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,836
You have to save
my husband.

354
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,471
I'm short of cash... to bail
him out.

355
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,706
Wait for me.

356
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,684
It's a pain to open martial
clubs in Hong Kong!

357
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:07,722
Too many schools,
masters, and rules.

358
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,054
And then there's this Mr Hung.

359
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:12,324
He has too many men,
pupils, and money!

360
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,832
So what?
You wait and see.

361
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,062
I'll have my revenge.

362
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,637
When I'm out,
I'll smash his fish stalls

363
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,803
and poison all his fish.

364
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,775
Don't you see...

365
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,834
you sound exactly like them?

366
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,402
Kid

367
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,881
You were quite fierce
when you fought.

368
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,314
Who's the kid?

369
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,149
What make you think I'm a kid?
Leung!

370
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,483
Watch your attitude!

371
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,251
Master Jin is your senior.

372
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,520
That's OK.
He's a young man after all.

373
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,990
Look at him.
He's just like me in the past.

374
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:49,294
If you want him to be good,
find him a wife.

375
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,857
Like me,

376
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:53,199
a family with a wife and kids

377
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:54,795
will make one down to earth.

378
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,509
I want to bail my husband out.

379
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,071
Who's your husband?

380
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,514
Ip Man.

381
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,241
Do you have the money
with you?

382
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,650
Yes.

383
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,116
Ip Man.

384
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,190
You can go now.

385
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,189
Hurry up!

386
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,618
I'm here to bail out
Jin Shanzhau.

387
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,779
Honey!

388
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,221
Brother, open the door
for me, please.

389
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,484
Hurry up!

390
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,018
My wife.

391
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,637
Leung,

392
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,608
is your family going to
bail you out?

393
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,003
No.

394
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,213
Don't worry, Master.

395
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,647
They will release me
in a couple of days.

396
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,087
Go first. Go.

397
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,084
I won't see you off.

398
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,130
Kan,

399
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,176
I need to bother
you again.

400
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,972
I want to bail
my pupil out.

401
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,142
Is that all right with you?

402
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,818
Brother Man, I... don't have
enough money.

403
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,553
Master Ip!

404
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,922
Wait, Master Ip!

405
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,116
Honey, do you have cash?

406
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,221
What do you need
cash for?

407
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,121
It's emergency.

408
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,131
You're always like that. No!

409
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,926
Help me, Honey!

410
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:06,799
Come on...

411
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,361
Last time!

412
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,168
You're the best, Mommy...

413
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,339
Take the cash, Master Ip.

414
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,344
I'll pay you back as soon as
I can. Thank you.

415
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,312
Don't worry!

416
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:31,486
It's such a pain to open a martial club
in Hong Kong, let's forget about it.

417
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,907
Just visiting other masters.
No big deal.

418
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:49,171
I don't wanna fret over you,
like before.

419
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,019
We've gone through everything
during the war.

420
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,551
There's nothing to worry
about, right?

421
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:08,298
Don't worry too much.
You had a busy day.

422
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,330
Go to bed now.

423
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:31,284
I fought in similar arenas
many times before.

424
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,913
But it wasn't stools
underneath.

425
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,254
It was all knives!

426
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,157
Ip Man.

427
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,855
Have you heard
of him before?

428
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,057
The name sounds so lame.

429
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,698
No, I haven't.

430
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,763
Who can be better than
Master Law?

431
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,964
You're being modest,
Master Cheng.

432
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,241
Are you going up
later on?

433
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,209
If you'll go, I'll go.

434
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,676
Let's stop talking

435
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:55,905
and have some tea.

436
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,447
Thanks.
Thanks.

437
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,218
Master.

438
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,125
He has arrived.

439
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,934
Masters...

440
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,738
this is Ip Man.

441
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,170
He wants to teach martial arts
in Hong Kong.

442
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:30,446
So here he is to welcome
to your challenge.

443
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:31,910
Ip Man.

444
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:36,212
If you surrender or fall off
the desk, you lose.

445
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,719
If you can stay put when
the incense burns out,

446
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,723
I'll call you Master Ip.

447
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,427
If there's no question,
let's start.

448
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,611
No way, walking up like that?

449
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,306
No style at all.

450
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:23,189
Hello, masters! I'm Ip Man...

451
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:26,327
of Foshan Wing Chun,
pupil of Chen Huashun.

452
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,970
I'm honored to meet you!

453
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,474
Which master wants to play?

454
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,702
Master Law, what are you
waiting for?

455
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,378
Let's see who wants
to go first.

456
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,689
OK, I'll go first.

457
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,708
Please!

458
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,377
Please!

459
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,880
Be careful, brother!

460
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,204
Master Law, are you all right?

461
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,339
I'm fine.
Master...

462
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,470
If it were knives,
it would have been death.

463
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,672
One shouldn't fight like that.

464
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,013
Go away!

465
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,550
That desk is very
slippery indeed.

466
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,483
Thank you for
letting me win!

467
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,789
Come on! Don't let it stop!

468
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,757
Master Cheng, your turn.

469
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:31,458
Please!

470
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,053
Master Cheng, going up.

471
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,597
Go.

472
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:46,607
Master Cheng,
the desk is very slippery.

473
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,181
Please!

474
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:58,614
Please!

475
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:11,654
Good!

476
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:22,895
Thanks for sparing me.

477
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,035
Thanks for letting
me win!

478
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:28,004
Who else is interested?

479
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,189
Please!

480
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,462
Please!

481
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:17,914
Master Ip!

482
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:19,706
Master Hung!

483
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,852
Welcome to the martial
arts society.

484
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,415
Don't forget to pay
your monthly fees.

485
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:28,522
What monthly fees?

486
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:31,425
It's a rule.
Everyone has to pay.

487
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:34,555
$100 a month.
It saves all the trouble.

488
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,205
If anyone still thinks
I'm not qualified,

489
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,336
I'm ready to accept
more challenges.

490
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,111
But if it's only to satisfy
your personal gain,

491
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,643
I cannot accept it.

492
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:55,876
It's up to you.

493
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,452
Don't look me up when
you have trouble.

494
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,586
You can leave now.

495
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:17,037
Medicine.

496
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,347
Master, medicine.

497
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,521
You wanna die?
Drawing on my newspaper?

498
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:43,291
I just want the readers
to know the content better.

499
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,126
Has the response been bad?

500
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,670
Everyone in Hong Kong is talking
about Wing Chun Vs Hung Kuen.

501
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,498
That's awesome!

502
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,873
Keep writing in this style.

503
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,502
My paper depends on you.

504
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:56,910
Get to work.

505
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,073
Awesome, Yau!

506
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,343
Incredible!

507
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:06,687
Wing Chun Vs Hung Kuen:
No Clear Winner Yet

508
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:14,028
Don't do your homework.
Eat first.

509
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:15,724
Let's eat.

510
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,664
Please give me some congee,
Honey.

511
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:22,700
You've been eating less lately.
Come and eat.

512
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,333
Eat.

513
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,438
Where're you going?

514
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,808
Didn't you see?

515
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,841
I'm going upstairs to wash
the tablecloth.

516
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,282
You're really going to wash
the tablecloth?

517
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,284
Of course, why else
this big bowl?

518
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,478
You think I'm washing
my hair?

519
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,521
151, 152...

520
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:40,056
Where are you going?

521
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,655
To learn Wing Chun.

522
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:44,122
Wing Chun?
There's nothing here!

523
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,456
Not according to the newspaper.

524
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,656
Nothing! Scram!

525
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:48,755
You better learn Hung Kuen.

526
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,864
The scumbags won't let others
learn Wing Chun?

527
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,268
Scumbags, I dare you
to come down!

528
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,029
What are you doing?

529
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,940
Didn't you hear?
Come down!

530
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,110
Come down if you have guts!

531
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,720
Come down if you dare!

532
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,621
Are you crazy?
You wanna die?

533
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:16,821
No guts?

534
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:17,952
They want to learn
Wing Chun.

535
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:18,892
What are you doing?

536
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:19,758
Beat him up!

537
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:24,797
They've come down.

538
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,062
Take your weapons.
Hurry up!

539
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,229
Come out!

540
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,677
This incident affected
our neighborhood.

541
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:18,721
I understand.

542
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,622
We've decided not to
lend you the rooftop.

543
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:22,124
I understand.

544
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:22,921
I'm sorry.

545
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:25,461
Sorry, I got to go.

546
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,100
Farewell.

547
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,829
Bye, Kan.

548
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:02,597
Master.

549
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:05,899
Master.

550
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,000
I guess you know already?

551
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,608
We can't practice
here anymore.

552
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,045
Master, it's not our fault.

553
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,347
They started it!

554
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,479
They provoked us to go down.

555
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:26,681
Let's go and reason with him!

556
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,156
Good!

557
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,619
Master...

558
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:33,119
Tidy up the place
before you go.

559
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,925
Move the wooden stakes
to my place.

560
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:37,762
Master...
Master...

561
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:55,584
Kei.

562
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,287
Everyone's worked hard
for the competition.

563
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,755
Share this with everyone.

564
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,416
Thank you, Master!

565
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,022
For you.
Thanks.

566
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:08,954
Thanks for your hard work.

567
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,024
How dare you come here?

568
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:21,440
I'm here for your master.

569
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:22,910
Kei.

570
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,407
Take a break.

571
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:37,350
What is it?

572
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,555
Trouble at the martial club?

573
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:43,958
I'm here to tell you
though I've lost my club,

574
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:46,160
I will continue to teach
martial arts.

575
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,136
I'm not doing to
pay a penny to you!

576
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:49,929
Don't harass my pupils

577
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,997
or cause others trouble!

578
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,938
It's you who's causing
me trouble now!

579
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:55,906
You don't follow the rules!

580
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:58,209
Without me as the go-between
with the expats,

581
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,876
how can martial clubs
here exist in peace?

582
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,284
You choose to compromise
with the expats.

583
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:05,787
Ip Man,

584
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,787
you only care
about yourself.

585
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:10,557
You don't have 200 men
to feed.

586
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:14,256
You can ignore the expats
and play noble.

587
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,835
I know your feelings.
We're trying to survive.

588
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,104
But as masters,

589
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,971
we should teach
our pupils well.

590
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,572
My conscience is clear!

591
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,671
At any rate...

592
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:35,215
if you got any complaints,
come to me directly!

593
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:35,951
So long!

594
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:37,180
Stand there!

595
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:39,518
You think you can
leave just like this?

596
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,147
Then what do you want?

597
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:43,986
We were not done last time.
Let's carry on.

598
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,362
Be careful!

599
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,477
Honey, we've been waiting
here for a while.

600
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,038
The kids are hungry.

601
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:08,050
Are you guys done
with your discussion?

602
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,432
Master Hung,

603
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,627
is it more important to win

604
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:28,431
than to have dinner
with your family?

605
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,069
What do you want to eat?

606
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:37,807
We want ice cream!

607
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,882
I'll buy you ice cream
after dinner.

608
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,682
I won't hold you anymore,
Master Hung.

609
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:52,027
Farewell.

610
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:13,037
Master.

611
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:14,310
Come in.

612
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,215
Come in.

613
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,554
Put them there.

614
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:20,985
Come, put them there.

615
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:22,991
Why did you bring the
wooden stakes back?

616
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,587
They've rented the rooftop
to someone else.

617
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:29,962
So I'm storing them
here for the time being.

618
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,073
OK,

619
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,133
go back and rest.

620
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,144
Come here to practice
tomorrow morning.

621
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:43,236
Come here to practice?

622
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:45,508
Yes! Come earlier tomorrow.

623
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:49,414
Goodbye, Master.

624
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:59,518
Master,

625
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,763
can I have a word
with you?

626
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:11,867
Leung, have a cup of tea first.

627
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:14,201
Come.

628
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,471
Have a seat.

629
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:28,420
Master, my impulsiveness

630
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,221
has cost you your martial club.
I'm sorry.

631
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,625
Come.

632
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,857
Get up. Come.

633
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:36,759
Get up.

634
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,760
Sit down and we'll talk. Come.

635
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:50,310
Leung,

636
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:52,706
how's my martial arts?

637
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,014
Of course it's great.

638
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,651
You can beat so many people
by yourself.

639
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,881
What about twenty years later?

640
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:03,057
In twenty years,
you can beat me easily.

641
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,488
Everyone will get old.

642
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:10,288
No one can remain No. 1 forever!

643
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:13,863
Leung, you have
great potential...

644
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,263
for martial arts.

645
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:18,765
But you only focus on...

646
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:21,333
techniques.

647
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:24,471
I want you to learn Chinese
martial arts,

648
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:29,048
because they incorporate
the Chinese spirit

649
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,916
as well as self-cultivation.

650
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:36,956
It's important to be neutral,
striving not to strive.

651
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,028
Do you understand?

652
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,470
I'm thinking.

653
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,976
You want to hear a story?

654
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:02,879
That Jin Shanzhao,
Master Jin...

655
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:04,718
Once upon a time...

656
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:08,224
I whipped his ass
with a broomstick.

657
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:12,954
He came to my house in Foshan
to challenge me to a duel.

658
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,860
And he broke everything,

659
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,866
making my wife really mad.

660
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:35,714
Look, martial arts!

661
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:36,945
Yes.

662
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,418
Play over there, kiddies.

663
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:42,949
Let's go.

664
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:56,699
Master.

665
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:03,272
Carry on!

666
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:13,513
What a coincidence!

667
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:16,015
I just happened to pass by.

668
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,022
What do you want,
Master Hung?

669
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:23,889
I have extra tickets.

670
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:26,168
You want to go?

671
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:27,931
It's western boxing.

672
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,377
Goodbye.

673
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:37,878
My Hung.

674
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:42,414
Your eyes are red... Are you OK?

675
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,346
They've been like that
since I woke up.

676
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:48,754
Perhaps it's the heat.
I'll drink some cool tea.

677
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,193
It's not bad to teach
martial arts here.

678
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,363
Move them over here
in three rows.

679
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,230
And three rows over
there as well.

680
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:06,669
Hurry up.

681
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:14,647
So here we are!

682
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:17,916
Master Hung, come say hi.

683
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:19,716
I'll introduce you to the
boxing champion.

684
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,620
Mr Twister.

685
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,393
He's Chinese kung-fu master,
Master Hung.

686
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,984
How are you?

687
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,499
The foreigner is throwing things.
Ignore him.

688
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,467
How's your talk with
the foreigner?

689
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:37,472
When are we getting
our money?

690
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:40,940
He glared whenever I touched
on money.

691
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,602
Then it won't lead to anywhere.

692
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:44,779
He asked to do a pro bono
this time.

693
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,280
Pro bono?

694
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:49,284
We closed our fish stalls
to work here.

695
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:50,182
Don't be mad.

696
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,777
We can't afford to
piss him off.

697
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:53,549
Just treat this as a diet and
lose some weight.

698
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,551
That's not his first time.

699
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:00,485
Master Hung.

700
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,998
Sir.

701
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:05,992
You can refuse to pay,

702
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,196
but my men need to eat,
so you better pay.

703
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,130
Don't discuss money
with me now.

704
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:13,072
What else can I discuss
with you? Love?

705
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:14,439
Who do you think you are?

706
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,070
You collect money for me,
you don't share it!

707
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,238
Do as I say,

708
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:20,441
you are not qualified to make
deals with me!

709
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:22,074
Come!

710
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:25,687
Sorry, so I'll have judges...

711
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,023
Stop it. The foreigner devil
is pissed off.

712
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,524
If he doesn't pay,
we'll just quit!

713
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:32,857
If you quit, you quit that
fish business too!

714
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,954
I can get anybody
to take care of it!

715
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:36,794
OK! No problem!

716
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,989
If you quit,

717
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,058
he'd take away your fish stalls.
Just hang in there.

718
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,127
No way! I've tolerated
him too often!

719
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:46,608
Will somebody get this yellow piece
of fat out of here!

720
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:48,109
You're making too much noise!

721
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:49,838
Are you speaking the
Devil's tongue?

722
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:51,402
You! Get out!

723
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,210
OK! We go!

724
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:59,248
I can't hear the Devil's squeal.
Let's go!

725
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,254
We're quitting. Let's go.

726
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,024
Let's go!

727
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,615
Wait!

728
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,323
Look, many lives
depend on you.

729
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,028
Stay and work.

730
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,895
Come,

731
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,372
let's go!

732
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:26,080
Don't be mad.
Let's wait and see

733
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:27,912
where that asshole
will end up.

734
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:56,406
Master Ip.
Master Hung.

735
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:58,003
Thanks for your tickets.

736
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,777
The other schools will have
demos later.

737
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,045
Ask your pupils to demonstrate
their kung fu

738
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,054
so more people will know
about Wing Chun.

739
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,285
Sure.

740
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,987
I won't be holding you.

741
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,122
Hi, fellas!

742
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:17,257
Hello there, Taylor.

743
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:19,661
Congratulations!
Barely broke into a sweat!

744
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,998
I thank you!

745
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:27,467
Go get ready.
Go get ready.

746
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,768
You go too, both of you.

747
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,749
Go up and demonstrate
Shaking Hands.

748
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:35,814
Together.

749
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:38,577
It's quite good.

750
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:41,521
Suffer some losses to publicize
martial arts.

751
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,692
What's all this,
some pantomime?

752
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:50,827
Why are they dancing
and screaming?

753
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,198
It's not pantomime, Taylor.

754
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,100
This is Chinese boxing.

755
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:58,630
They believe the screaming
gives them strength.

756
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:03,702
Oh, yeah?

757
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,248
Well let's go and give them something
to scream about, ain't I?

758
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:07,646
Go for it.

759
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:11,314
Chinese boxing...

760
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:28,028
Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like Twister
wants to get in on the action.

761
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:31,801
Boxing Champion
Vs Chinese Kung-fu is cool!

762
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:42,774
Thank you! Thank you...

763
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,653
Very nice!

764
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:49,390
Punch me.

765
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,395
Punch... me.

766
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:05,967
Hit me!

767
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,844
More power! Come on!

768
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,181
Come on! Come on!

769
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:28,221
Come on!

770
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:42,166
Now that is power!

771
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:43,735
Bloody Foreign Devil!

772
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,279
What's the matter?

773
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:57,915
So this is Chinese boxing?

774
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,629
You should stick to dancing.

775
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:03,295
The Champion said Chinese
Kung-fu was useless.

776
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:04,697
Go back to dancing.

777
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,997
What did you say?
What did you say?

778
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,803
Come on!

779
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:34,821
Come on!

780
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,134
Stop beating him! Stop it!

781
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:52,577
Carry him out!
Stop fighting! Stop it!

782
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:54,639
Stop fighting! Stop it!

783
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,118
What should we do?

784
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:01,552
Relax Fatso! Enjoy the show!

785
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,460
Stop fighting! Stop it!

786
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:06,552
Stop fighting!

787
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,233
Stop fighting!
Stop fighting!

788
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,395
Come on!

789
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:17,632
Back off!
Everybody, stop it!

790
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,369
Stop it! Stop fighting!

791
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,939
Stop it! Stop fighting!

792
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:32,981
Leung...

793
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:34,044
Master

794
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:35,420
Carry him down first.

795
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:36,958
Help me, Cham.

796
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:38,557
Slowly... slowly...

797
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:41,221
Excuse me...
Slowly!

798
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,662
Let us pass!

799
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,239
Master of Ceremony!
Come here!

800
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,372
We were demonstrating
Chinese martial arts.

801
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:59,209
If you didn't like it,
you could have left.

802
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:02,341
But you should apologize
for injuring us!

803
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,448
He wants you to apologize.

804
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,988
What? Apologize?

805
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:10,082
What is this some stupid
Chinese tradition,

806
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:13,260
that winners have to
apologize to the losers?

807
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:17,091
If I have to do that,
I'd be apologizing everyday!

808
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:24,296
You want an apology
from me, old man?

809
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:28,402
Then you beat me
in a fight right now,

810
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:31,371
then I'll apologize.

811
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:34,677
He said, if Master Hung
can beat him,

812
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,012
then he'll apologize.

813
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:37,279
Let me fight with him!

814
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,654
I'll beat him till he
apologizes to me!

815
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,246
Slay that Foreign Devil!

816
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:44,588
Masters, let me handle this.

817
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:47,628
Please get down
for the moment.

818
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:51,063
OK! Let's get down!

819
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,446
Fight!

820
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:36,741
Good!

821
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:44,212
Right! Fight like that!

822
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:07,173
Stop! To your corner!

823
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:09,143
Break! Break!

824
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,150
Very well.

825
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,943
Master Ip. Leung is all right.
He's resting inside.

826
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:20,247
Thanks!

827
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:28,261
Master Hung!

828
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:30,121
Are you all right?

829
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,925
I'm fine.

830
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:36,668
In the next round,
Master Hung,

831
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:39,708
instead of combating with him,
test his midrib.

832
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:44,645
It's not that easy.

833
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:52,317
OK. Go for it.

834
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:54,083
Fight!

835
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:05,363
Kick the Foreign Devil down!

836
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:29,881
Break! Break!

837
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:35,261
One, two,

838
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:37,993
three, four,

839
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,761
five, six,

840
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:43,728
seven, eight,

841
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,003
nine...

842
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,904
Are you OK?
Look at me.

843
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:51,310
Are you OK?

844
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:54,075
Me? Yeah!

845
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:55,548
Fight!

846
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,635
Break!

847
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,068
Fight!

848
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:29,049
One, two, three,

849
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,678
four, five

850
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:37,024
Are you alright?

851
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:38,586
Fight!

852
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,396
Shit! Master is out
of breath.

853
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:11,453
Master, sit down and
rest a bit.

854
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,560
Good.

855
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:25,268
He's just getting tired. OK.

856
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,865
Stop fighting,
Master Hung!

857
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:32,174
I can't let the Foreign Devil
look down on us.

858
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:34,215
Don't get hurt
for your ego!

859
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,515
I can abide in order
to survive,

860
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,419
but I can't let him insult
Chinese martial arts!

861
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:51,297
Fight!

862
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:08,978
Master! Master...

863
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:12,612
One, two, three,

864
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:15,019
four,

865
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:18,722
five, six,

866
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,487
seven,

867
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:22,791
eight,

868
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:24,830
nine!

869
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,460
Master!

870
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,234
Master!

871
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:31,004
Are you OK?

872
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,238
Fight!

873
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:28,426
Let go!
Master...

874
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,089
Let go!

875
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:34,332
Master...

876
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:41,696
Go home, boys!

877
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:52,863
Master Hung,

878
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:58,846
you're my most
respected master.

879
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,294
Hung Kuen Grandmaster Died in
Western Boxing Match

880
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:26,364
Hung Kuen Grandmaster Died
For His Country.

881
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:29,968
Western Boxing Champion
Was a Bully.

882
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:34,072
Wallace! You've seen what the local
newspapers saying about us?

883
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:38,709
I ask you to organize one,
one boxing competition.

884
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:41,221
And look at the trouble
you got us in!

885
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:42,916
I'm sorry, Sir.
I know what to do.

886
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:44,458
I'll take care of it.

887
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:45,493
You'll take care of it?

888
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,289
You'd better take care of it.

889
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:52,026
I do not want to be in the newspaper
once more for bullying the Chinese!

890
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:54,361
It's alright, sir.

891
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:57,764
I promise. We will have no further
trouble from now.

892
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:05,304
What's going on?
Sit tight!

893
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:08,372
None of your business.
Sit down.

894
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:17,184
Who's the editor-in-chief?

895
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:20,994
What's the matter?

896
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:22,189
Take him back.

897
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:23,561
Sir!

898
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:28,467
Open up.

899
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:35,633
You'd better remember that this is what
happens to people who mess with me.

900
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:40,343
Hold his hands!

901
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:46,676
No...

902
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:49,947
Hold him tight!

903
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:55,390
Sir...

904
01:18:57,332 --> 01:19:00,699
It's not wise to beat him like that.
He will write a scathing report on us.

905
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:03,364
We better waste him.

906
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:04,962
I know what to do.
Let me handle it.

907
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:09,800
Fatso! You take care of him!

908
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:11,072
OK.

909
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:50,607
There had been a lot of rumor
in Hong Kong recently.

910
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:54,883
This is due to a boxing competition
that had been arranged.

911
01:19:55,757 --> 01:20:01,195
Unfortunately, a Chinese boxer
rather over-estimated himself

912
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:04,357
and challenged our champion.

913
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:08,428
Twister reluctantly accepted
the challenge,

914
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:12,166
and although he held back
during the fight.

915
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:16,006
Unfortunately the Chinese boxer
was so weak

916
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:19,240
that he couldn't stand up
to Twister's fists.

917
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:24,115
And after a few punches,
he tragically died.

918
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:28,555
We are sorry for this
regrettable accident.

919
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:33,394
To quell this riot and
give Twister justice,

920
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:40,492
I have decided to organize a
Chinese-western boxing competition.

921
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:45,168
Twister will fight the Chinese people

922
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,970
in a fair manner on the stage.

923
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:53,013
In order to protect my name
and reputation,

924
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:58,616
I've agreed to fight
any Chinese person.

925
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:02,013
Now from what I hear,

926
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:06,526
the Chinese like to use this!

927
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:11,456
And I would like to
stick to that tradition.

928
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:17,738
So I've agreed to fight
any challenger

929
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:21,173
for as long as
this thing burns!

930
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:24,036
And this is a pretty
big joss stick,

931
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:28,048
so it's gonna give plenty of opportunity
for any challenger to come forward.

932
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:30,575
But be warned!

933
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:33,417
I would not hold back!

934
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:37,222
By the time this thing
has burnt to the end,

935
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:42,025
there will be no more Chinese boxer,
because I'd have kill them all!

936
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:44,691
In fact I don't even think
that we're gonna use this thing

937
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:48,702
because I doubt that there
is any Chinese fella

938
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:52,001
that has the guts to get
in the ring with me!

939
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,909
Chinese burns incense not
only to tell the time!

940
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:05,643
Besides telling the time,
what's important

941
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,654
about the Chinese tradition
of incense burning

942
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,256
is that it represents
our modesty

943
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:13,691
which is inherent to the
Chinese culture.

944
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:17,989
Mr Miller,

945
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:21,465
I'm challenging you
to a fight!

946
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:27,869
You're making a big mistake!

947
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,205
Zhun, hurry up.

948
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:01,174
Don't let the Landlady
wait too long.

949
01:23:02,544 --> 01:23:04,535
I'll take you
there in a moment.

950
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:31,937
Mom, why are we staying
with the landlady?

951
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:35,236
Dad's practice will affect
your brother.

952
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:40,948
Come, let me.

953
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:42,246
I'm so sorry for the hassle,
Landlady.

954
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:43,716
Don't worry. Come.
Thanks.

955
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:45,150
Let Zhun carry the small one.

956
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:46,710
Zhun.
Let Zhun carry this.

957
01:23:46,888 --> 01:23:49,652
Mr Ip, you must defeat
the Foreign Devil.

958
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:51,419
I'll carry it up first.

959
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:11,574
Don't worry and
practice well.

960
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:14,509
But don't practice
till too late.

961
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:16,711
You have to win.

962
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:24,314
We have to go.

963
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:26,860
Go back.

964
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:42,239
I live by myself.

965
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:43,834
Make yourselves at home.

966
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:46,705
You can sleep here.

967
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:04,764
Don't be scared.
Keep writing.

968
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:08,367
Keep writing!
I'll still publish it tomorrow!

969
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:15,840
What's the matter?

970
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:17,341
Cops!

971
01:25:19,814 --> 01:25:21,304
What are you writing?

972
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,440
Still writing?

973
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:25,312
You're not afraid to die?

974
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:30,522
Undaunted by Western Boxer,
Wing Chun Expert...

975
01:25:30,592 --> 01:25:32,150
Entered Chinese-Western Boxing Competition

976
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:33,590
Is that good?

977
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:36,987
Why not "Western Dog
Will Be Demolished"?

978
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:46,630
Defend news with blood,
expose truth with conscience.

979
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:48,938
You have conscience,
but do you have the truth?

980
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:50,500
I do!

981
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:54,909
You've guts? I tell you the truth.
You ruin him!

982
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:57,441
Good!
Come.

983
01:25:57,919 --> 01:25:59,352
This Foreign Devil...

984
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,786
detests and despises Chinese.

985
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,420
I give you the materials. You report them.
I guarantee he'll be over.

986
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:32,183
What's the matter?

987
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:33,481
Mrs Ip, what's the matter?

988
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:34,544
You're in labor!

989
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:35,850
Zhun, call your dad
right away!

990
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:36,686
Zhun...

991
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:38,783
Don't distract him.

992
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:40,488
I'll ask Auntie to come then.

993
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:42,257
Zhun, watch over your mom.

994
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,775
Master Cheng, this way.

995
01:27:04,852 --> 01:27:06,149
Let's start!

996
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:13,584
The Chinese-Western Boxing Match
is about to commence!

997
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:16,357
The hall is packed with
locals and expats.

998
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:18,058
It's bustling with excitement.

999
01:27:18,132 --> 01:27:21,260
There are both Chinese and
Western umpires.

1000
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:23,304
I believe the match
will be fair,

1001
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:24,861
just and open.

1002
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:26,634
Ladies and gentlemen,
do not leave your radio!

1003
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:28,801
Ip Man, knock him down
in 3 punches.

1004
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:31,208
No, knock the Foreign Devil
down in 3 punches!

1005
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:34,472
Master Ip, your opponent
is a boxing champion.

1006
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:36,414
Are you convinced your
Wing Chun will prevail?

1007
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:38,843
Master Ip, all Hong Kong
citizens are behind you.

1008
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:41,552
Master Ip, are you fighting
for yourself...

1009
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:42,612
or in defense of Chinese
martial arts?

1010
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:44,590
Ladies and gentlemen...

1011
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:47,321
The most awaited Chinese-Western
Boxing Match

1012
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:50,057
has officially commenced!

1013
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:52,330
Ladies and gentlemen!

1014
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:57,201
And now, for the long-awaited
Chinese-western boxing tournament,

1015
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:02,835
please, give a roaring welcome to the
undisputed champion of the world!

1016
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:06,038
The Twister!

1017
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:11,584
Let's welcome the boxing
champion, Twister!

1018
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:13,883
Twister has come on stage.

1019
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,990
You are the best.

1020
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,331
Excuse me, sir, to your corner.

1021
01:29:07,408 --> 01:29:10,571
Here, to your corner, please.

1022
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,408
To your corner!

1023
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,783
Ip Man was eager to knock
him down. Good!

1024
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:26,891
Master.

1025
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:32,528
Twister.

1026
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:40,865
Gentlemen, I want a clean fight.

1027
01:29:40,942 --> 01:29:42,409
I want a clean fight.

1028
01:29:42,477 --> 01:29:43,808
When I say "fight", fight.

1029
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:44,970
When I say "fight", fight.

1030
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,206
When I say "break", break.

1031
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,679
When I say "break", break.

1032
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:50,980
You have to follow my instructions
at all time, is that clear?

1033
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,077
You have to follow my instructions
at all time, is that clear?

1034
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:57,051
I can finish you off
in two punches!

1035
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:58,883
Return to your corners!

1036
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:03,056
This should be a piece
of cake, mate.

1037
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:04,962
You just go up there
and get him slaughtered.

1038
01:30:17,512 --> 01:30:18,342
Fight!

1039
01:30:24,352 --> 01:30:27,617
Master Ip, punch him like you
punched me.

1040
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,450
It's too easy to punch you.

1041
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:30,752
What did you say?

1042
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:36,589
They keep testing each other.

1043
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:41,662
Come on!

1044
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:33,209
To your corner!
To your corner!

1045
01:31:33,287 --> 01:31:34,219
Master!

1046
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:36,722
Master Ip was knocked down!
The umpire's counting!

1047
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:38,122
Master!

1048
01:31:39,193 --> 01:31:41,161
One, two, three...
Get up! Master Ip!

1049
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:42,321
Looks like this punch
was too strong.

1050
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:43,556
Can Master Ip stand up?

1051
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:46,031
Four, five...

1052
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:49,269
six, seven...

1053
01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:52,531
eight, nine...

1054
01:31:54,909 --> 01:31:56,706
Master Ip is OK!
He's stood up!

1055
01:31:56,777 --> 01:31:57,869
Good!

1056
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:02,511
Good!

1057
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:10,250
Fight!

1058
01:32:31,412 --> 01:32:34,381
Master Ip has kicked
the Twister down!

1059
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:39,945
One, two...

1060
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:43,084
three, four...

1061
01:32:43,157 --> 01:32:45,887
five, six...

1062
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,222
seven...

1063
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:51,188
Are you OK?

1064
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:23,795
OK?

1065
01:33:23,864 --> 01:33:25,388
Fight!

1066
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:29,300
Get back! Back to your corner!
To your corner!

1067
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:36,709
He's over.
You can surely beat him.

1068
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:38,244
Master! Good fight!

1069
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:39,336
That Foreign Devil
has stamina.

1070
01:33:39,413 --> 01:33:41,711
He's endured many of the
Master's punches.

1071
01:33:47,221 --> 01:33:48,449
Fight!

1072
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:07,133
Master Ip attacked with
a volley of punches.

1073
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:13,979
Master Ip! Master Ip...

1074
01:34:43,077 --> 01:34:44,101
Master!

1075
01:34:44,178 --> 01:34:45,543
Foreign Devil!
Still hitting after time's up?

1076
01:34:45,613 --> 01:34:47,342
To your corner!

1077
01:34:48,816 --> 01:34:51,216
That's unfair!
He kept hitting after time's up!

1078
01:34:53,988 --> 01:34:56,013
Come on,
give me some water.

1079
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:59,150
Master! Master...

1080
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:03,020
Talk about it.
What's going on?

1081
01:35:03,597 --> 01:35:05,258
OK. Give me one moment.

1082
01:35:05,332 --> 01:35:07,664
Brad, please,
could you come?

1083
01:35:25,519 --> 01:35:28,716
Please tell the Chinese guy,
no more kicks like these.

1084
01:35:43,971 --> 01:35:46,166
According to the decisions
by the judges,

1085
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:48,765
kicking is prohibited
in this match.

1086
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:50,708
According to the decisions
by the judges,

1087
01:35:50,778 --> 01:35:52,507
kicking is prohibited
in this match.

1088
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,140
If you don't agree,
you forfeit the match.

1089
01:35:55,216 --> 01:35:58,310
And Twister will be announced
the winner. Is that clear?

1090
01:35:58,385 --> 01:36:00,546
If you don't agree,
you forfeit the match.

1091
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:03,886
And Twister will be announced
the winner. Is that clear?

1092
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:07,823
Are you kidding?
No kicking?

1093
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:19,166
Fight!

1094
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:28,047
Wait! Wait! Wait!

1095
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:30,083
One more kick,
you'll be disqualified!

1096
01:36:30,151 --> 01:36:31,243
Understand?

1097
01:36:31,652 --> 01:36:32,550
Fight!

1098
01:36:44,598 --> 01:36:48,659
Master Ip was felled by
Twister's right punch!

1099
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:51,137
Master!

1100
01:36:51,205 --> 01:36:56,336
Get up! Get up!
Get up!

1101
01:36:56,410 --> 01:36:58,105
Stand up! Master!

1102
01:36:58,612 --> 01:37:01,547
I can't let the Foreign Devil
despise us!

1103
01:37:02,082 --> 01:37:04,243
I can abide in order
to survive,

1104
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:06,817
but I can't tolerate insults to
Chinese martial arts!

1105
01:37:07,021 --> 01:37:10,513
...three, four...

1106
01:37:10,591 --> 01:37:13,151
five, six...

1107
01:37:13,227 --> 01:37:14,159
Master!

1108
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:15,661
Seven...

1109
01:37:17,598 --> 01:37:19,259
Are you OK?

1110
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:21,496
Are you OK?

1111
01:37:23,637 --> 01:37:24,934
Come on!

1112
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:26,399
Fight!

1113
01:37:31,745 --> 01:37:33,042
Come on, man!

1114
01:37:34,882 --> 01:37:36,873
Instead of combating
with him,

1115
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:38,282
test his midrib.

1116
01:37:38,352 --> 01:37:39,717
It's not that easy.

1117
01:38:52,092 --> 01:38:53,389
One!

1118
01:38:54,361 --> 01:38:55,988
Two!

1119
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:57,690
Three!

1120
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,323
Four!

1121
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:00,924
Five!

1122
01:39:01,001 --> 01:39:02,229
Six!

1123
01:39:02,303 --> 01:39:03,497
Seven!

1124
01:39:03,570 --> 01:39:04,434
Eight!
Get up!

1125
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:06,939
Nine! Ten!

1126
01:39:15,849 --> 01:39:17,680
Dad has won!
Dad has won!

1127
01:39:17,751 --> 01:39:18,945
Fantastic!

1128
01:39:53,721 --> 01:39:55,348
I know Master Ip!

1129
01:39:55,422 --> 01:39:56,650
Who doesn't here?

1130
01:39:56,724 --> 01:39:59,488
Fok Yuen Kap, Wong Fei Hung,
Ip Man and I!

1131
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:00,925
We're the Four Dragons
in Foshan!

1132
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:11,398
Stop.

1133
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:15,868
Fatso has told
me everything.

1134
01:40:15,943 --> 01:40:20,312
Your actions embarrassed the entire
Hong Kong Police Force!

1135
01:40:20,981 --> 01:40:22,346
Arrest him!

1136
01:40:38,932 --> 01:40:40,490
Hello!

1137
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:42,969
He says "Hello".

1138
01:40:45,973 --> 01:40:47,770
By fighting this match,

1139
01:40:49,376 --> 01:40:52,106
I'm not trying to prove
Chinese martial arts

1140
01:40:52,946 --> 01:40:55,244
are better than
Western boxing.

1141
01:40:58,152 --> 01:41:00,086
What I really
want to say is...

1142
01:41:01,855 --> 01:41:06,349
though people have different
statuses in life,

1143
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:14,430
everybody's dignity is the same.

1144
01:41:16,303 --> 01:41:20,034
I hope that from
this moment on,

1145
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:26,812
we can start to respect
each other.

1146
01:41:29,249 --> 01:41:32,548
He says he didn't come here today
to prove which is better,

1147
01:41:32,619 --> 01:41:34,712
Chinese or western boxing.

1148
01:41:34,788 --> 01:41:37,621
Although people have different
status in life,

1149
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:42,685
he doesn't believe that one person's
integrity is worth more than another's.

1150
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:46,725
He hopes that we could start
to respect each other.

1151
01:41:51,672 --> 01:41:54,197
That's all.
Thank you!

1152
01:41:54,842 --> 01:41:56,901
That's all,
Thank you!

1153
01:42:15,996 --> 01:42:17,930
Master Ip! Master Ip...

1154
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:20,664
What would you want to
do most right now?

1155
01:42:23,203 --> 01:42:25,330
I want to go home.

1156
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:11,245
He takes after you.

1157
01:43:14,087 --> 01:43:15,748
Name him.

1158
01:43:15,889 --> 01:43:17,481
How about Ip Ching?

1159
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:20,023
I want him to become
a righteous man.

1160
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:21,491
Good!

1161
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,329
He looks just like you!

1162
01:43:32,439 --> 01:43:35,203
Congratulations, Master Ip!
You won!

1163
01:43:51,892 --> 01:43:54,588
Uncle Man, I just made
a new friend.

1164
01:43:54,661 --> 01:43:57,186
He wants to learn kung fu,
so I brought him.

1165
01:43:57,264 --> 01:43:58,788
Come in.

1166
01:44:03,737 --> 01:44:06,171
How much to learn
martial arts from you?

1167
01:44:15,182 --> 01:44:16,410
What's your name?

1168
01:44:16,483 --> 01:44:18,075
Bruce Lee!

1169
01:44:19,686 --> 01:44:21,654
Why do you want to
learn martial arts?

1170
01:44:21,722 --> 01:44:24,350
I wanna beat up people
I don't fancy!

1171
01:44:26,693 --> 01:44:28,285
How presumptuous!

1172
01:44:30,664 --> 01:44:33,724
Come back when
you've grown up.

1173
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:52,609
In 1956

1174
01:44:52,686 --> 01:44:56,247
16-year-old Bruce Lee
became Ip Man's pupil

1175
01:44:57,257 --> 01:45:00,158
Bruce Lee was
deeply inspired

1176
01:45:00,227 --> 01:45:02,889
and based his martial arts
on Wing Chun theories.

1177
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:06,156
In 22 years' time,
Ip Man

1178
01:45:06,233 --> 01:45:09,896
had spread Wing Chun
all over the world,

1179
01:45:10,837 --> 01:45:13,670
helping Chinese martial arts

1180
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:17,005
to flourish everywhere.
