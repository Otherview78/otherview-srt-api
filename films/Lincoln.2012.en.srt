1
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,920
<i>Some of us was
in the Second Kansas Colored.</i>

2
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,423
<i>We fought the Rebs at
Jenkins' Ferry last April...</i>

3
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,594
<i>...just after they killed every Negro soldier
captured at Poison Springs.</i>

4
00:02:57,011 --> 00:03:01,349
So at Jenkins' Ferry, we decided
warn't takin' no Reb prisoners.

5
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,851
And we didn't leave
a one of 'em alive.

6
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:09,523
The ones of us that didn't die that day, we
joined up with the 116th U.S. Colored, sir...

7
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:12,026
...from Camp Nelson, Kentucky.

8
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,362
What's your name, soldier?

9
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,198
Private...Harold Green, sir.

10
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:22,036
I'm Corporal Ira Clark, sir.
Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry.

11
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,038
We're waiting over there.

12
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,875
We're leaving our horses,
shipping out with the 24th Infantry...

13
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,378
...for the assault next week
on Wilmington.

14
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,049
How long have you
been a soldier?

15
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,385
Two year, sir.

16
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:42,390
The Second Kansas Colored Infantry
fought bravely at Jenkins' Ferry.

17
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,808
That's right, sir.

18
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:47,478
They killed a thousand Rebel soldiers, sir.
They were very brave.

19
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,065
And making $3 less each month
than white soldiers.

20
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:52,316
Us Second Kansas boys--

21
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,903
Another $3 subtracted
from our pay for our uniforms.

22
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,488
That was true, but--

23
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,408
Equal pay now, but still no
commissioned Negro officers.

24
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,660
I'm aware of that,
Corporal Clark.

25
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,995
That's good
that you're aware, sir, but...

26
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:06,247
Will the Wilmington attack--

27
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:10,835
...now that white people are accustomed
to seeing Negro men with guns...

28
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:15,423
...fighting on their behalf, and they tolerate
Negro soldiers getting equal pay...

29
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:20,428
...maybe in a few years, they can abide the
idea of Negro lieutenants and captains.

30
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:23,848
In fifty years,
maybe a Negro colonel.

31
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:27,101
In a hundred years...the vote.

32
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:33,774
What will you do
after the war, Corporal Clark?

33
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:36,360
Work, sir.

34
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,779
Perhaps you'll hire me.

35
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,448
Perhaps I will.

36
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:44,952
But you should know, sir,
I get sick at the smell of boot black...

37
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,871
...and I cannot cut hair.

38
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:51,292
I've yet to find a man could cut mine
so that it'd make any difference.

39
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,462
- You got springy hair for a white man.
- Yes, I do.

40
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:57,047
My last barber hanged himself.

41
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:03,137
And the one before that.
Left me his scissors in his will.

42
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,309
- President Lincoln, sir.
- Good evening, boys.

43
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:09,810
We saw you, and...

44
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,729
- We were at--
- We was at Gettysburg.

45
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,564
You boys fight at Gettysburg?

46
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,900
No, we just signed up last month.

47
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,152
We saw him
at the cemetery dedication.

48
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,990
We heard you speak... Goddamn.
How tall are you, anyway?

49
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,575
Aw, jeez, shut up.

50
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,328
- Could you hear what I said?
- Not much, sir.

51
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:32,166
"Four score and seven years ago, our
fathers brought forth from this continent...

52
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,959
...a new nation,
conceived in liberty and dedicated

53
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,670
to the proposition
that all men are created equal."

54
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,422
That's good. Thank you.

55
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,343
"Now we are engaged in a great civil war,
testing whether that nation or any nation...

56
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,929
...so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure.

57
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,098
We are met on a great
battlefield of that war."

58
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,350
That's good, thank you.

59
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,852
"We come to dedicate
a portion of that field...

60
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,856
...as a final resting place for those who here
gave their lives that the nation might live."

61
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,692
His uncles died
on the second day of fighting.

62
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,361
I know the last part.

63
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,530
Company up! Moving out!

64
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,033
You boys best go and find your company.
And thank you.

65
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,077
Thank you, sir. God bless you.

66
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,871
God bless you, too. God bless you.

67
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:28,722
"That we here highly resolve that these
dead shall not have died in vain.

68
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:34,728
That this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom...

69
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:40,067
...and that government of the people,
by the people, for the people...

70
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,070
...shall not perish
from the earth."

71
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,600
<i>It's nighttime.</i>

72
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,104
<i>Ship's moved
by some terrible power...</i>

73
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,607
<i>...at a terrific speed.</i>

74
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,276
<i>And though it's
imperceptible in the darkness,</i>

75
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,279
<i>I have an intuition
that we're headed towards a shore.</i>

76
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,198
<i>No one else seems to be
aboard the vessel.</i>

77
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:32,953
<i>I'm very keenly aware
of my...aloneness.</i>

78
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:38,792
"I could be bounded in a nutshell
and count myself a king of infinite space...

79
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,794
...were it not that I have
bad dreams."

80
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:48,469
I reckon it's the speed that's strange to me.
I'm used to going at a deliberate pace.

81
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:54,141
I should spare you, Molly.
I shouldn't tell you my dreams.

82
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:58,979
I don't want to be spared if you aren't.
And you spare me nothing.

83
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,816
Perhaps it's...

84
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,904
...it's the assault
on Wilmington Port.

85
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,157
You dream about the ship
before a battle, usually.

86
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,326
How's the coconut?

87
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,329
Beyond description.

88
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,500
Almost two years,
nothing mends.

89
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,586
Another casualty of the war.

90
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:28,926
Who wants to listen to a useless woman
grouse about her carriage accident?

91
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,345
- I do.
- Stuff.

92
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,683
You tell me dreams, that's all.
I'm your soothsayer.

93
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,520
That's all I am to you anymore.
I'm not to be trusted...

94
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,607
...even if it was not
a carriage accident.

95
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:47,611
- Even if it was an attempted assassination.
- It was most probably an accident.

96
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:52,032
It was an assassin
whose intended target was you.

97
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,704
How are the plans coming along
for the big shindy?

98
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:01,041
I don't want to talk about parties.
You don't care about parties.

99
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,962
Not much, but they're
a necessary hindrance.

100
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,385
I know.

101
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,013
I know what it's about,
the ship.

102
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:21,562
It's not Wilmington Port.
It's not a military campaign.

103
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,066
It's the amendment
to abolish slavery.

104
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:30,070
Why else would you force me
to invite demented radicals into my home?

105
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:37,244
You're going to try to get the amendment
passed in the House of Representatives...

106
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,247
...before the term ends?
Before the Inauguration?

107
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,916
Don't spend too much money
on the flubdubs.

108
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,921
No one is loved
as much as you.

109
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:51,759
No one's ever been loved
so much by the people.

110
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,844
You might do anything now.

111
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:58,599
Don't waste that power
on an amendment that's sure of defeat.

112
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,689
Did you remember Robert's
coming home for the reception?

113
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,695
I knew you'd forget.

114
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:21,455
That's the ship you're sailing on--
the Thirteenth Amendment.

115
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,625
You needn't tell me I'm right.
I know I am.

116
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,129
It's late, Mrs. Keckley.

117
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,799
She needs this for the grand reception.

118
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,472
It's slow work.

119
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,974
Good night.

120
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,813
Did you tell her a dream?

121
00:10:45,813 --> 00:11:15,813
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

122
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,074
Papa.

123
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,744
Papa, I want to see Willie.

124
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,163
Me, too, Taddie, but we can't.

125
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,581
Why not?

126
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:31,251
Willie's gone.
It's three years now he's gone.

127
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,785
The part assigned to me
is to raise the flag.

128
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:10,457
Which, if there be no fault
in the machinery, I will do.

129
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,126
And when up...

130
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,630
...it'll be for the people
to keep it up.

131
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,304
That's my speech.

132
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,309
<i>We are coming,
Father Abraham</i>

133
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,812
<i>Three hundred thousand more</i>

134
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:36,483
<i>From Mississippi's winding stream
And from New England's shore</i>

135
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,903
<i>We leave our plow and workshops
Our wives--</i>

136
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,991
Even if every Republican
in the House votes yes--

137
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:49,329
- -Far from guaranteed, since when has our
party unanimously supported anything?

138
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:53,166
But say all our fellow
Republicans vote for it.

139
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,919
We'd still be twenty votes short.

140
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,005
- Only twenty?
- "Only twenty"?

141
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,756
We can find twenty votes.

142
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:03,677
Twenty House Democrats who'll vote to
abolish slavery? In my opinion--

143
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,929
To which I always listen.

144
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,349
- Or pretend to.
- With all three of my ears.

145
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,854
We'll win the war soon.
It's inevitable, isn't it?

146
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,356
Well, it ain't won yet.

147
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,277
You'll begin your second term
with semi-divine stature.

148
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,946
Imagine the possibilities
peace will bring.

149
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:28,076
Why tarnish your invaluable luster with
a battle in the House? It's a rat's nest.

150
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,871
It's the same gang
of talentless hicks and hacks

151
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,290
who rejected the amendment
10 months ago.

152
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:34,916
We'll lose.

153
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,962
I like our chances now.

154
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,300
Well, consider the obstacles
that we'd face.

155
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:47,637
The two-thirds majority
needed to pass an amendment.

156
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,099
We have a Republican majority,
but barely more than 50%.

157
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,809
Fifty-six.

158
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,522
We need Democratic support.
There's none to be had.

159
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,817
Since the House last voted on it,
there's been an election.

160
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,863
Sixty-four Democrats
lost their House seats in November.

161
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:08,033
That's 64 Democrats looking for work
come March.

162
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,661
They're not worried about re-election.
They can vote however it suits them.

163
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,708
But we can't buy the vote for the
amendment. It's too important.

164
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:21,379
I said nothing of buying anything.
We need 20 votes was all I said.

165
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:25,383
Start of my second term,
plenty of positions to fill.

166
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,724
Mr. President, may I present
Mr. and Mrs. Jolly from Missouri--

167
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,018
From Jeff City, President.

168
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,728
Mr. Jolly.

169
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,563
Ma'am.

170
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,900
And this here by the fire
is Secretary of State Seward.

171
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,404
Jeff City?

172
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:53,578
I heard tell once
of a Jefferson City lawyer...

173
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:55,914
...who had a parrot...

174
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,750
...that'd wake him
each morning, crying out:

175
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:03,713
"Today is the day the world shall end,
as scripture has foretold."

176
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,591
And, one day...

177
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:12,097
...the lawyer shot him, for the sake
of peace and quiet, I presume.

178
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:16,935
Thus fulfilling, for the bird at least,
his prophecy.

179
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,948
There's only one toll booth
in Jeff City, to the southwest...

180
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,951
...and this man Heinz Sauermagen
from Rolla

181
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,120
been in illegal possession
for near two yar...

182
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:39,082
...since your man General Schofield
set him up there.

183
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,419
But President Monroe give that toll gate
to my granpap...

184
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,462
...and Quincy Adams...

185
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,966
...give my pap a letter
saying it's our'n for keeps.

186
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,053
Mrs. Jolly got the--
Show Mr. Lincoln the Quincy Adams letter.

187
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:56,391
That's unnecessary.
Just tell me what you want from me.

188
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:01,730
Mr. Jolly's emphysema
don't care for cigars.

189
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:05,817
Madame, do you know about the proposed
13th Amendment?

190
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,446
Yes, sir, everybody knows of it.
The President favors it.

191
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:10,989
- Do you?
- We do.

192
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,284
- You know that it abolishes slavery?
- Yes, sir, I know it.

193
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,828
And that is why you favor it?

194
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:20,498
What I favor
is ending the war.

195
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:24,669
Once we do away with slavery,
the Rebs'll quit fighting...

196
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,130
...since slavery's
what they're fighting for.

197
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,342
Mr. Lincoln,
you always says so.

198
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:35,513
With the amendment, slavery's ended.
They'll give up.

199
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:39,517
If the war finished first,
before we end slavery--

200
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:43,230
President Lincoln says the war won't stop
unless we finish slavery.

201
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,233
But...if it did.

202
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,401
The South is exhausted.

203
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:52,572
If they run out
of bullets and men...

204
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:57,077
...would you still want your--
Who's your Representative?

205
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,913
Jeff City?
That's Congressman Burton.

206
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:03,333
"Beanpole" Burton.
I mean, Josiah Burton, yes, sir.

207
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:07,420
A Republican, undecided on
the amendment, I believe.

208
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:11,424
Perhaps you could call on him
and inform him of your enthusiasm.

209
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,927
Madame.

210
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,264
If the Rebels
surrendered next week...

211
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,267
...would you,
at the end of this month...

212
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,771
...want Congressman Burton to vote
for the 13th Amendment?

213
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,277
If that was how it was,
no more war...

214
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,948
...I reckon Mr. Jolly much prefer not to have
Congress pass the amendment.

215
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,034
And, uh...

216
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,662
...why is that?

217
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,206
Niggers.

218
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,293
If he don't have to let some Alabama coon
come to Missouri...

219
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,462
...steal his chickens and his job,
we'd much prefer that.

220
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:56,636
The people. I begin to see why you're in
such a great hurry to put it through.

221
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,223
Would you let me study this letter, sir,
about the toll booth?

222
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:05,478
Come back to me in the morning
and we'll consider what the law says.

223
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,815
You be sure to...

224
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,818
...visit "Beanpole".

225
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,904
Tell him you support
passage of the amendment...

226
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,490
...as a military necessity.

227
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,659
Thank you.

228
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,663
Oh, Nicolay,
when you have a moment.

229
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,705
If procuring votes with offers
of employment is what you intend...

230
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,540
...I'll fetch a friend from Albany
who can supply

231
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,919
the skulky men
gifted at this kind of shady work...

232
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,714
...and spare me the indignity
of actually speaking to Democrats.

233
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,051
Spare you the exposure
and liability.

234
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,722
Pardon me,
that's a distress signal...

235
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:27,227
...which I am bound,
by solemn oath, to respond to.

236
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:34,317
Tom Pendel took away the camera plates
of slaves Mr. Gardner sent over...

237
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,069
...because Mama says
they're distressing.

238
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,487
You had nightmares.

239
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,990
I'll have worse nightmares if I can't
look at the plates again.

240
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,743
Perhaps.

241
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,581
You can't afford a single defection
from anyone in the party.

242
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:53,420
Not even a single Republican absent when
they vote. You know who you have to see.

243
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,341
Send over to Blair House.

244
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,931
Ask Preston Blair
can I call on him around five o'clock.

245
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:09,769
God help you. God alone knows
what he'll ask you to give him.

246
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,189
If the Blairs tell them to,

247
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,692
...no Republican will balk
at voting for the amendment.

248
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,361
No conservative Republican
is what you mean.

249
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,780
All Republicans
ought to be conservative.

250
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,240
I founded this party,

251
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,451
...in my own goddamn home,
to be a...

252
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,870
...conservative
anti-slavery party,

253
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,164
...not a hobbyhorse for
goddamn radical abolitionists.

254
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:31,040
Damp down
the dyspepsia, Daddy.

255
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,917
You'll frighten the child.

256
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,961
You need us to keep
the conservative side...

257
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,379
...of the party in the traces...

258
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,797
...while you diddle
the radicals...

259
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,008
...and bundle up
with Thaddeus Stevens's gang!

260
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,426
You need our help!

261
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,178
Yes, sir, I do.

262
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,721
Well, what do we get?

263
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:46,598
Blunt!

264
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,559
Your manners, Monty,
must be why Mr. Lincoln...

265
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,519
...pushed you
out of his Cabinet.

266
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,104
- I wasn't pushed!
- Oh, of course you weren't.

267
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,689
He was pushed out to placate
the damn radicals!

268
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:59,110
- I agreed to resign.
- Oh, Daddy, please! Daddy.

269
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,407
Oh. You don't mind, boy,
do you?

270
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,576
He spends his days
with soldiers.

271
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:07,702
They taught me a song.

272
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,245
Did they?

273
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,707
Soldiers know
all manner of songs.

274
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,126
How's your brother Bob?

275
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,377
He's at school now,
but he's coming...

276
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,171
...to visit in four days
for the shindy.

277
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,423
At school. Ain't that fine?

278
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,258
Good he's not in the Army.

279
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,219
He wants to be,
but Mama said he cannot.

280
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,221
Dangerous life, soldiering.

281
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,224
Your mama is wise
to keep him clean out of that.

282
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:32,477
Now, your daddy knows
that what I want...

283
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:35,438
...in return for all the help
I give him...

284
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,274
...is to go down to Richmond,
like he said I could...

285
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,610
...as soon as Savannah fell...

286
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,238
...and talk
to Jefferson Davis.

287
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,115
Now give me terms I can
offer to Jefferson Davis...

288
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,660
...to start negotiating
for peace.

289
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,953
He'll talk to me.

290
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,539
Conservative members
of your party...

291
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:56,292
...want you to listen
to overtures from Richmond.

292
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,419
That above all!

293
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,340
They'll vote for this rash
and dangerous amendment...

294
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:05,802
...only if every other
possibility is exhausted.

295
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,972
Our Republicans
ain't abolitionists.

296
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,517
We can't tell our people
they can vote yes...

297
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:13,935
...on abolishing slavery...

298
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:17,105
...unless at the same time
we can tell them...

299
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:20,108
...that you're seeking
a negotiated peace.

300
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:30,535
Leo, it's 100 miles
to Richmond.

301
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,829
Get him drunk so he can sleep.

302
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:34,330
Yes, ma'am.

303
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,207
Here, Daddy.

304
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,003
- Thank you.
- Pull this up.

305
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:41,671
Where's my hat?

306
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,381
Leo has your hat.

307
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:44,841
All right?

308
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:47,802
Go make peace.

309
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,317
Thunder forth, God of War.

310
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,864
We'll commence our assault
on Wilmington from the sea.

311
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:12,952
Why is this burnt?

312
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,371
Was the boy playing with it?

313
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,707
It got took by a breeze
several nights back.

314
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,459
This is an official
War Department map.

315
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,377
And the entire
Cabinet's waiting...

316
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:22,545
...to hear what it portends.

317
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,713
A bombardment.

318
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,133
From the largest fleet
the Navy has ever assembled.

319
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,719
Old Neptune,
shake thy hoary locks!

320
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,721
Fifty-eight ships
are under way,

321
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,140
...of every tonnage
and firing range.

322
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,684
We'll keep up
a steady barrage.

323
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,394
Our first target
is Fort Fisher.

324
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,146
It defends Wilmington Port.

325
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,190
A steady barrage?

326
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,859
A hundred shells a minute.

327
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:46,986
Till they surrender.

328
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,072
Dear God.

329
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:52,492
Wilmington's their
last open seaport, therefore--

330
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:55,244
Wilmington falls,
Richmond falls after.

331
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:59,040
And the war is done.

332
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,417
Here! Here!

333
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,586
Then why, if I might ask...

334
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,921
...are we not concentrating...

335
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,173
...the nation's attention
on Wilmington?

336
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,592
Why, instead, are we
reading in the <i>Herald...</i>

337
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:11,678
...that the anti-slavery
amendment...

338
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:14,764
...is being precipitated onto
the House floor for debate?

339
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:15,932
Because your eagerness,

340
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,684
...in what seems
an unwarranted intrusion...

341
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,353
...of the executive into
legislative prerogatives,

342
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,271
...is compelling it
to what's...

343
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:25,358
...to what's likely to be
its premature demise.

344
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,442
Here! Here!

345
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,194
You signed
the Emancipation Proclamation.

346
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,278
You've done
all that could be done.

347
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,530
The Emancipation
Proclamation's...

348
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,699
...merely a war measure.
After the war, the courts--

349
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,534
When Edward Bates
was Attorney General,

350
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:35,868
...he felt confident enough
to let you sign it!

351
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:37,954
Different lawyers,
different opinions.

352
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,581
It frees slaves
as a military exigent. Not--

353
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:44,293
I don't recall Edward Bates
being any too certain about...

354
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:47,130
...the legality
of my proclamation.

355
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,466
Just it wasn't
downright criminal.

356
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,303
Somewheres in between.

357
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:00,727
Back when I rode the legal
circuit in Illinois,

358
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,146
...I defended a woman
from Metamora...

359
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,981
...named Melissa Goings.

360
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,817
Seventy-seven years old.

361
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:11,654
They said she'd murdered
her husband. He was 83.

362
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,240
He was choking her...

363
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:18,077
...and she grabbed a hold
of a stick of firewood...

364
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:20,788
...and fractured his skull
and he died.

365
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,750
In his will, he wrote,

366
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,171
"...I expect
she has killed me."

367
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,594
"If I get over it,
I will have revenge."

368
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,934
No one was keen
to see her convicted...

369
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,312
...he was that kind
of husband.

370
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:46,689
I asked
the prosecuting attorney...

371
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,984
...if I might have a short
conference with my client.

372
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:53,321
She and I went into a room
in the courthouse,

373
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:55,281
...but I alone emerged.

374
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,450
The window in the room
was found to be wide open.

375
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:01,162
It was believed the old lady
may have climbed out of it.

376
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:04,540
I told the bailiff,

377
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,459
...right before I left her
in the room...

378
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:07,627
...she asked me where
she could get...

379
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,546
...a good drink of water,
and I told her...Tennessee.

380
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:15,968
Mrs. Goings was seen
no more in Metamora.

381
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:18,221
Enough justice had been done.

382
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,349
They even forgave
the bondsman her bail.

383
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:23,726
I'm afraid I don't see--

384
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,311
I decided...

385
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,565
...that the Constitution
gives me war powers...

386
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,026
...but no one knows
just exactly...

387
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,195
...what these powers are.

388
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,197
Some say they don't exist.

389
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,949
I don't know. I decided...

390
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,284
...I needed them to exist
to uphold my oath...

391
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,620
...to protect
the Constitution.

392
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,580
Which I decided
meant I could take...

393
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,541
...the Rebels' slaves
from them...

394
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:49,043
...as property
confiscated in war.

395
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,712
That might recommend
to suspicion that I agree...

396
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:52,964
...with the Rebs
that their slaves...

397
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,173
...are property
in the first place.

398
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:56,551
Of course, I don't.
Never have.

399
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:59,470
I'm glad to see any man free,

400
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,764
...and if calling
a man property...

401
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,140
or war contraband...

402
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:06,477
...does the trick, why I
caught at the opportunity.

403
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,106
Now here's where
it gets truly slippery.

404
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,234
I use the law
allowing for the seizure...

405
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,402
...of property in a war...

406
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:15,945
...knowing it applies
only to the property...

407
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,698
...of governments and citizens
of belligerent nations.

408
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,117
Well, the South
ain't a nation.

409
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:23,911
That's why I can't
negotiate with them.

410
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:26,789
So if, in fact, the Negroes
are property,

411
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,165
...according to the law...

412
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,167
...have I the right to take
the Rebels' property...

413
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:32,086
...from them, if I insist
they're rebels only...

414
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,131
...and not citizens
of a belligerent country?

415
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:36,883
And slipperier still,
I maintain it ain't...

416
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,802
...our actual Southern states
in rebellion...

417
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:42,638
...but only the rebels
living in those states...

418
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:46,100
...the laws of which states
remain in force.

419
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,187
"The laws of which states
remain in force."

420
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:52,398
That means that since it's
states' laws that determine...

421
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,942
...whether Negroes
can be sold as slaves,

422
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:56,527
...as property...

423
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,363
...the federal government
doesn't have a say in that.

424
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,115
At least not yet.

425
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,911
Then Negroes in those states
are slaves,

426
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:05,995
...hence property...

427
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,247
...hence my war powers
allow me to confiscate them...

428
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:10,625
...as such,
so I confiscate them.

429
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,835
But if I'm a respecter
of states' laws,

430
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,295
...how can I
legally free them...

431
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,672
...with my Proclamation
as I done?

432
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,967
Unless I'm canceling
states' laws?

433
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:27,016
I felt the war demanded it.

434
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,685
My oath demanded it.

435
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,396
I felt right with myself,

436
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,774
...and I hoped
it was legal to do it.

437
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,525
I'm hoping still.

438
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:42,281
Two years ago, I proclaimed
these people emancipated.

439
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:46,702
"Then, thenceforward
and forever free."

440
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,164
Now let's say the courts
decide I had no authority...

441
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,875
...to do it--they might well
decide that.

442
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,002
Say there's no amendment
abolishing slavery,

443
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,545
...say it's after the war...

444
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,589
...and I can no longer use
my war powers...

445
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,466
...to just ignore
the courts' decisions...

446
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,010
...like I sometimes
felt I had to do.

447
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:06,639
Might those people I freed
be ordered back into slavery?

448
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,769
That's why I'd like to get...

449
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,854
...the 13th Amendment
through the House...

450
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:16,065
...on its way
to ratification by the states.

451
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,858
Wrap the whole
slavery thing up,

452
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:20,736
...forever and aye,
as soon as I'm able. Now!

453
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,279
End of this month.

454
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:24,073
And I'd like you
to stand behind me...

455
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,993
...like my Cabinet's
most always done.

456
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,086
As the preacher said,

457
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,131
"...I could write
shorter sermons,

458
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:43,134
...but once I start,
I get too lazy to stop."

459
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:50,057
It seems to me, sir,
you're describing...

460
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:52,059
...precisely the sort
of dictator...

461
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:53,894
...the Democrats
have been howling about.

462
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:55,896
Dictators
aren't susceptible to law.

463
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,481
Neither is he.
He just said as much.

464
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,275
Ignoring the courts?
Twisting meanings?

465
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,277
What reins him in
from...from--

466
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,863
Well, the people do that,
I suppose.

467
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:07,575
I signed
the Emancipation Proclamation,

468
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:10,661
...what, a year and a half
before my second election?

469
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,538
I felt I was within my power
to do it,

470
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:16,125
...however, I also felt that I
might be wrong about that.

471
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:17,418
I knew the people
would tell me.

472
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,170
I gave them a year and a half
to think about it,

473
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,588
...and they re-elected me.

474
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,548
And come February the first,

475
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,468
...I intend to sign
the 13th Amendment!

476
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,023
Well, Mr. Representative
Ashley.

477
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,233
Tell us the news
from the Hill.

478
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,359
Ah, well, the news--

479
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,445
Why, for instance,
is this thus,

480
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,363
...and what is the reason
for this thusness?

481
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:49,075
James, we want you to bring
the anti-slavery amendment...

482
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:50,159
...to the floor for debate,

483
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,702
- ...immediately.
- What?

484
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,538
You are the amendment's
manager, are you not?

485
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:55,831
I am, of course, but--

486
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:58,709
Then we're counting
on robust radical support...

487
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,461
...so tell Mr. Stevens
we expect him...

488
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,796
...to put his back into it.

489
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:02,963
It not going to be easy, but--

490
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:04,673
It's impossible.

491
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,467
No. I am sorry, no.

492
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,887
We can't organize anything
immediately in the House.

493
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,472
I have been canvassing
the Democrats...

494
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:12,598
...since the election...

495
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,141
...in case any
of them softened...

496
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:15,935
...after they got
walloped, but...

497
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:17,770
...they stiffened,
if anything, Mr. Secretary.

498
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:18,979
There aren't nearly
enough votes.

499
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:21,148
We're whalers, Mr. Ashley.

500
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:27,530
Whalers? As in, uh...whales?

501
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:30,032
We've chased this whale
for a long time.

502
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,076
And we finally placed
a harpoon...

503
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,244
...in the monster's back.

504
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:35,371
It's in, James. It's in.

505
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:38,040
We finish the deed now.
We can't wait.

506
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,377
Or with one flop of his tail,
he'll smash the boat...

507
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:43,587
...and send us all
to eternity.

508
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,006
On the 31st of this month,
of this year,

509
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,425
...put the amendment
up for a vote.

510
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:51,929
Whalers?

511
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,180
That's what he said.

512
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:55,933
The man's never been near
a whale ship in his life.

513
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,603
Withdraw radical support.

514
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,189
Force him
to abandon this scheme,

515
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:04,066
...whatever he's up to.

516
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:07,236
He drags his feet
about everything,

517
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,405
...Lincoln--why this urgency?

518
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:11,490
We got it through the Senate
without difficulty...

519
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:12,783
...because we had the numbers.

520
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,411
Come December, you'll have
the same in the House.

521
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,413
The amendment will be
the easy work of 10 minutes.

522
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:18,998
He's using the threat
of the amendment...

523
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,875
...to frighten the Rebels
into an immediate surrender.

524
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,918
I imagine
we'd rejoice to see that.

525
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,004
Will you rejoice
when the Southern states...

526
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,755
...have rejoined
the Union pell-mell,

527
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,757
...as Lincoln intends them to,
and one by one,

528
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:30,259
...each refuses
to ratify the amendment?

529
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:32,428
If we pass it, which we won't.

530
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:35,764
Why are we cooperating
with him?

531
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:39,351
We all know what he's doing
and we all know what he'll do.

532
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:42,605
We can't offer up abolition's
best legal prayer...

533
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:44,190
...to his games and tricks.

534
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:45,774
He said he'd welcome
the South back...

535
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,026
...with all its slaves
in chains.

536
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,528
Three years ago he said that--
to calm the border states.

537
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,197
I don't!

538
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:56,118
You said we know
what he'll do--I don't know.

539
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:57,453
You know
he isn't to be trusted.

540
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:58,913
Trust? Oh.

541
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,623
I'm sorry, I was under
the misapprehension...

542
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,375
...that your chosen profession
was politics.

543
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:05,878
I never trusted the President,
never trusted anyone...

544
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,713
...but hasn't he
surprised you?

545
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,965
No, Mr. Stevens, he hasn't.

546
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,801
Nothing surprises you, Asa,

547
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:15,054
...therefore nothing about you
is surprising.

548
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,889
Perhaps that is why
your constituents...

549
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,642
...did not re-elect you
to the coming term.

550
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,394
It's late.

551
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:23,729
I'm old.

552
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,315
I'm going home.

553
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:32,529
Lincoln,
the inveterate dawdler.

554
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,782
Lincoln, the Southerner.

555
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:37,826
Lincoln, the capitulating
compromiser...

556
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,372
...our adversary, and...

557
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:45,960
...leader of the godforsaken
Republican party.

558
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,253
Our party.

559
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:50,756
Abraham Lincoln has asked us
to work with him...

560
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:54,343
...to accomplish the death
of slavery...in America.

561
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,972
Retain, even in opposition...

562
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,767
...your capacity
for astonishment.

563
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,526
The President is never
to be mentioned. Nor I.

564
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,278
You're paid
for your discretion.

565
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,196
Hell, you can have that
for nothing.

566
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,991
What we need money for
is bribes, to speed things up.

567
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:18,867
No,
nothing strictly illegal.

568
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,661
It's not illegal
to bribe Congressmen--

569
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,162
...they'd starve otherwise.

570
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:25,749
I have explained to Mr. Bilbo
and Mr. Latham that...

571
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,543
...we are offering
patronage jobs...

572
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,752
...to the Dems who vote yes.

573
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,547
- Jobs and nothing more.
- That's correct.

574
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:32,798
Congressmen come cheap--

575
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,092
...few thousand bucks
will buy all you need.

576
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,469
The President would be unhappy
to hear you did that.

577
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:39,972
Will he be unhappy if we lose?

578
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:42,558
The money I managed to raise
for this endeavor...

579
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,477
...is only for your fees,
your food and lodging.

580
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,398
If that
squirrel-infested attic...

581
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,816
...you've quartered us in
is any measure,

582
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,568
...you ain't raised much.

583
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,777
Shall we get to work?

584
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,908
The House
recognizes Fernando Wood...

585
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:04,455
...the honorable
Representative from New York.

586
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,626
Estimable colleagues.

587
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:13,213
Two bloody years ago
this month...

588
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,132
...His Highness,

589
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,634
...King Abraham Africanus
the First...

590
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:21,430
...our great
usurping Caesar...

591
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:25,225
...violator of ha be as corpus
and freedom of the press,

592
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:26,352
...abuser of states' rights--

593
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:29,355
If Lincoln really
were a tyrant, Mr. Wood...

594
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,315
...he'd have had
your empty head...

595
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,067
...impaled on a pike!

596
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,905
And the country better for it!

597
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:40,616
- -Radical Republican
autocrat...

598
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,952
...ruling by fiat
and martial law...

599
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,331
...affixed his name
to his heinous and illicit...

600
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,541
...Emancipation
Proclamation...

601
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,753
...promising it would hasten
the end of the war...

602
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:56,423
...which yet rages on and on.

603
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,885
He claimed, as tyrants do...

604
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,096
...that the war's
emergencies...

605
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:04,681
...permitted him to turn
our army into--

606
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:08,477
The New York delegation is
looking decidedly uninspired.

607
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:12,231
- -And radical Republicanism's
abolitionist fanaticism!

608
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,612
His Emancipation
Proclamation...

609
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,615
...has obliterated
millions of dollars--

610
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:24,660
Over in Pennsylvania...

611
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,204
...who's the sweaty man
eating his thumb?

612
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,748
Unknown to me.
Seems jumpy.

613
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:31,959
Perhaps he'll jump.

614
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,966
But all that was not enough
for this dictator,

615
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,260
...who now seeks
to insinuate--

616
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:42,511
Jesus.

617
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,763
When's this son of liberty
sum-a-bitch gonna sit down?

618
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:48,100
John Ellis is gonna break
his watch if he doesn't stop.

619
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,145
We are once again
asked, nay...

620
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:54,648
...commanded, to consider
a proposed 13th Amendment...

621
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,527
...which, if passed,
sets at immediate liberty...

622
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,362
...four million coloreds
while manacling...

623
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:02,781
...the limbs
of the white race in America.

624
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:04,533
If it is passed...

625
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:06,952
...but it shall not pass!

626
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:13,709
What's more interesting...

627
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,793
...is how dismal
and disgruntled...

628
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:16,295
...Mr. Yeaman appears.

629
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:19,298
Every member
of this House...

630
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:20,632
He should be cheering
right now.

631
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,259
Looks like he ate
a bad oyster.

632
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,511
- -Party and
the constituents it serves...

633
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:25,762
...shall oppose--

634
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,266
Point of order,
Mr. Speaker, if you please.

635
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,059
Mr. Speaker,
I still have the floor.

636
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,394
And the gentleman
from Pennsylvania...

637
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:33,562
...is out of order!

638
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,564
When will Mr. Wood conclude
his interminable gabble?

639
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,733
Some of us breathe oxygen...

640
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,069
...and we find the mephitic
fumes of his oratory...

641
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:44,490
...a lethal challenge
to our pulmonary capabilities!

642
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:50,162
We shall oppose
this amendment,

643
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,831
...and any legislation that so
affronts natural law...

644
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,501
...insulting to God as to man!

645
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,003
Congress must never
declare equal...

646
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,339
...those whom God
created unequal!

647
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,597
Slavery is the only insult
to natural law,

648
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,516
...you fatuous nincompoop!

649
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:14,436
Order!

650
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,439
Procedure, Mr. Speaker.

651
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,107
Mr. Wood has the floor.

652
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:20,609
Instruct us...

653
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,194
...oh, Great Commoner.

654
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,696
What is unnatural,
in your opinion?

655
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:27,032
Niggrahs casting ballots?

656
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,700
Niggrah representatives?

657
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:30,953
Is that natural, Stevens?

658
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,788
Intermarriage?

659
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,083
What violates natural law?

660
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,794
Slavery...and you.

661
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,797
Pendleton, you insult God!

662
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:45,133
You unnatural noise.

663
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:52,558
Mr. Colfax, please,
use your gavel!

664
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:53,976
- You are out of order!
- Order in the Cabinet!

665
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,060
Instruct
the Sergeant-at-Arms...

666
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,144
...to suppress this!

667
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,312
We are in session!

668
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:59,523
Please don't encourage this!

669
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,316
Don't encourage this!

670
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,282
You're back! You're back!
You're back!

671
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,410
I am. The goat got big.

672
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,996
Help me get
one of these to my room.

673
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,956
- She in there?
- She's asleep, probably.

674
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,541
- You need help, sir?
- No, sir.

675
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:18,625
They went to see
Avonia Jones last night...

676
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:19,918
...in a play about Israelites.

677
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:21,753
Could you give your pa
this letter I read...

678
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:23,005
...about my
insolvency proceeding?

679
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,257
Deliver your own
goddamn petition.

680
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,466
There's a new book--
Sam Beckwith...

681
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,844
...says it's about finches and finches' beaks,
about how they change.

682
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:30,554
He's here.

683
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,265
He's here!
Mrs. Cuthbert, he's here!

684
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,100
- Robbie.
- Hi, Mom.

685
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,518
- Oh, Robbie.
- Hey.

686
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,061
- Robbie.
- Hey.

687
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:39,354
Oh.

688
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,192
You're here a few days--
why'd you pack all that?

689
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:45,944
Well, I don't know how long--

690
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:47,154
Go tell your father
Robert's home.

691
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:50,240
Mr. Nicolay says Daddy's
secluded with Mr. Blair.

692
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:51,908
Tell him anyway.

693
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:55,996
Did you forget to eat?

694
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,748
- Exactly like him.
- No.

695
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,876
You'll linger a few days extra
after the reception

696
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:02,544
before you go back to school.

697
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,713
Well, I don't know
if I'm going to go back--

698
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:08,050
We'll fatten you up
before you return to Boston.

699
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:11,094
- All right, Mom.
- All right.

700
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:13,680
Oh, Robbie.

701
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:17,309
Jefferson Davis is sending
three delegates.

702
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:19,895
Stephens, Hunter and Campbell.

703
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:23,190
Vice President
of the Confederacy...

704
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,150
...the former
Secretary of State...

705
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,819
...and their Assistant
Secretary of War.

706
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:31,073
They're coming in earnest
to propose peace.

707
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:35,786
I know this is unwelcome news
for you.

708
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:37,746
Now hear me.

709
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,750
I went to Richmond
to talk to traitors.

710
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,420
To smile at and plead
with traitors...

711
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:49,299
...because it'll be spring
in two months...

712
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,843
...the roads will be passable,

713
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:54,221
...the spring slaughter
commences.

714
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,224
Four bloody springs now.

715
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:00,936
Think of my Frank,

716
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,772
...whom you've taken
to your heart.

717
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,692
How you'll blame yourself
if the war takes my son...

718
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:09,277
...as it's taken
multitudes of sons.

719
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,323
Think of all the boys
who will die...

720
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,367
...if you don't make peace.

721
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,369
You must talk with these men.

722
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,287
I intend to, Preston.

723
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,997
In return, I ask you
to push for the amendment--

724
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,708
No, this is not horse trading.

725
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,168
Not now!

726
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:27,462
Bob. I'm sorry.

727
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:29,381
- Welcome home.
- Thank you, sir.

728
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:31,591
Looking fit.
Harvard agrees with you.

729
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:32,926
- Mr. Blair.
- Fit and rested.

730
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,971
Could you give us a moment,
please, Robert? Thank you.

731
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:40,809
I will procure your votes
for you, as I promised.

732
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:45,063
You have always
kept your word to me.

733
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,483
Those Southern men are coming.

734
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:52,154
I beg you, in the name
of gentle Christ...

735
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,238
I understand.

736
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,031
...talk peace with these men.

737
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:56,992
I understand, Preston.

738
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:01,413
<i>We have
one abstention so far.</i>

739
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:02,664
<i>Jacob Graylor.</i>

740
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:04,750
<i>He'd like to be
Federal Revenue Assessor...</i>

741
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,585
<i>...for the 5th District
of Pennsylvania.</i>

742
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,879
So the total
of Representatives...

743
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:12,090
...voting three weeks from
today is reduced to 182...

744
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:14,092
...which means 122
yes votes...

745
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:16,052
...to reach the requisite
two-thirds of the House.

746
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:18,764
Assuming all Republicans
vote for the amendment...

747
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,727
...then, despite
our abstention...

748
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,437
...to reach
a two-thirds majority...

749
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,189
...we remain 20 yeses short.

750
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:28,356
For which we're seeking...

751
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,984
<i>...from among 64
lame duck Democrats.</i>

752
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:35,655
<i>Fully 39 of these we deem
unredeemable no votes.</i>

753
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:39,993
The kind that hates niggers.

754
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:42,704
Hates God for makin' niggers.

755
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:45,791
The Good Lord on high
would despair of their souls.

756
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:49,002
Thank you for that
pithy explanation, Mr. Bilbo.

757
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,796
We've abandoned these 39 to...

758
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:52,464
<i>...the devil
that possesses them.</i>

759
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,840
We would...

760
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,134
The remaining lame ducks...

761
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:58,470
...on whom we've been working
with a purpose.

762
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:00,430
Charles Hanson.

763
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,265
Congressman.

764
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:05,644
My colleagues and I would like
a moment of your time.

765
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:07,437
I wonder if you've
given much thought--

766
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,397
Giles Stuart.

767
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,238
Rather clumsy.

768
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,126
<i>Nelson Merrick.</i>

769
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:37,926
<i>Homer Benson.</i>

770
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:45,600
My name is Richard Schell.

771
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:48,103
I wanted you to have a look
at this prospectus here.

772
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:51,064
And lastly...

773
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:55,151
...Clay Hawkins. Of Ohio.

774
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:58,196
Tax Collector
for the Western Reserve--

775
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,865
...that pays handsomely.

776
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:01,700
Don't reach
for the highest branches,

777
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:03,618
...they sway in every breeze.

778
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,162
Assistant Port Inspector
in Morristown...

779
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:07,706
...looks like
the ticket to me.

780
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,624
Boats, same,
they make me sick.

781
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,751
So just stand on the dock.

782
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,671
Let the Assistant Assistant
Port Inspector's stomach...

783
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,047
...go weak.

784
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:19,926
<i>And, lastly,
Democratic yes vote...</i>

785
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,970
...number six, Hawkins.

786
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,054
From Ohio.

787
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:24,222
Six?

788
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:25,891
Well, thus far.

789
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:28,101
Plus Graylor's abstention.

790
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,021
- From tiny acorns and so on.
- What did Hawkins get?

791
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:33,231
Postmaster of the Millersburg
Post Office.

792
00:45:33,315 --> 00:45:34,649
He's selling himself cheap,
ain't he?

793
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:36,985
He wanted Tax Collector
of the Western Reserve.

794
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,154
First term Congressman who
couldn't manage reelection.

795
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,322
I felt it unseemly...

796
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:41,865
...and they bargained him down
to Postmaster.

797
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,366
Scatter them over several
rounds of appointments...

798
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:44,910
...so no one notices,
then burn this ledger,

799
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:47,078
...please, after you're done.

800
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:52,417
Time for
my public opinion bath.

801
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:53,835
Might as well let them in.

802
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,964
Seven yeses with Mr. Ellis.

803
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:00,592
Thirteen to go.

804
00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:03,219
One last item.

805
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,472
An absurdity, but...

806
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,850
...my associates report that
among the Representatives...

807
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,519
...a fantastical rumor's
bruited about...

808
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,481
...which I immediately
disavowed...

809
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,900
...that you'd allowed
bleary old Preston Blair...

810
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:18,068
...to sojourn to Richmond...

811
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:20,278
...to invite Jeff Davis
to send commissioners...

812
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:22,948
...up to Washington
with a peace plan.

813
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:29,245
I, of course, told them
that you would never...

814
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:32,207
...not without consulting me,
you wouldn't.

815
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:35,210
Because why on earth
would you?

816
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,339
Much obliged.

817
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:11,431
Why wasn't I consulted?

818
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:13,016
I'm Secretary of State.

819
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:16,686
And you informally send
a reactionary dotard to--

820
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:19,522
What will happen,
do you imagine,

821
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,150
...when these
peace commissioners arrive?

822
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,318
We'll hear them out.

823
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,070
Oh. Splendid.

824
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:26,738
And next, the Democrats
will invite them...

825
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,364
...up to hearings on the Hill.

826
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:31,034
And the newspapers...oh,
the newspapers.

827
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,535
The newspapers will ask,

828
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:34,412
"...Why risk enraging
the Confederacy...

829
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:35,497
...over the issue
of slavery...

830
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,957
...when they're here
to make peace?"

831
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,711
We'll lose every Democrat
we've got...

832
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:43,671
...more than likely
conservative Republicans...

833
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:45,381
...will join them,
and all our work...

834
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:47,759
...all our preparing
the ground for the vote...

835
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:49,010
...laid waste for naught.

836
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,845
The Blairs promised support
for the amendment...

837
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:51,971
...if we listen
to these people.

838
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:53,848
Oh, the Blairs promise,
do they?

839
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,058
You think they'll keep
their promise...

840
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:56,184
...once we've heard
these delegates...

841
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,186
...and refused them,
which we will have to do...

842
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,813
...since their proposal
most certainly...

843
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:01,147
...will be predicated on...

844
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:02,857
...keeping their slaves!

845
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:05,527
What hope for any
Democratic votes, Willum...

846
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:07,821
...if word gets out
I've refused a chance...

847
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:09,572
...to end the war?

848
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,741
You think word won't get out?

849
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:14,327
In Washington?

850
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:18,081
It's either the amendment
or this Confederate peace.

851
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,958
You cannot have both.

852
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,419
"If you can look into
the seeds of time,

853
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:27,340
And say which grain will grow
and which will not,

854
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:28,550
Speak then to me."

855
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,218
A disaster.
This is a disaster.

856
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,637
Time is a great thickener
of things, Willum.

857
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,556
Yes, I suppose it is.

858
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:37,016
Actually, I have no idea
what you mean by that.

859
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:41,062
Get me thirteen votes.

860
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,357
Them fellas from Richmond
ain't here yet.

861
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:07,922
You drafted
half the men in Boston.

862
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:10,842
What do you think
their families think about me?

863
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,844
The only reason they don't
throw things and spit on me...

864
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,429
...is 'cause
you're so popular.

865
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:18,266
I can't concentrate on...
on British Mercantile Law.

866
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,476
I don't care about
British Mercantile Law.

867
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:24,397
I might not even
want to be a lawyer.

868
00:50:26,149 --> 00:50:29,527
It's a sturdy profession.
And a useful one.

869
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:34,616
Yes, and I want to be useful,
but now, not afterwards.

870
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:36,451
I ain't wearing them things,
Mr. Slade.

871
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:37,577
They never fit right.

872
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,871
The missus will have you
wear them. Don't think--

873
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:41,915
You're delaying--
that's your favorite tactic.

874
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:43,875
- Be useful--
- You won't tell me no,

875
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,793
...but the war will be over in
a month, and you know it will.

876
00:50:45,919 --> 00:50:48,504
I've found that prophesying...

877
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:53,176
...is one of life's
less profitable occupations.

878
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:57,096
Why do some slaves
cost more than others?

879
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,514
Uh, if they're still
young and healthy,

880
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:00,099
...or if the women can
still conceive, they pay more.

881
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:02,894
Put them back in the box,
you scoundrel.

882
00:51:04,354 --> 00:51:06,231
We'll return them
to Mr. Gardner's studio...

883
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:07,857
...day after next.

884
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,693
Be careful with them now.

885
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,279
These things should have
stayed on the calf.

886
00:51:13,363 --> 00:51:17,742
When you were a slave,
Mr. Slade, did they beat you?

887
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,369
I was born a free man.

888
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:22,288
Nobody beat me
except I beat them right back.

889
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,416
Mr. Lincoln--

890
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,462
Mrs. Keckley was a slave.
Ask her if she was beaten.

891
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,339
- Were you--
- Tad.

892
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:32,924
I was beaten
with a fire shovel...

893
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:34,300
when I was younger than you.

894
00:51:34,384 --> 00:51:37,220
You should go to Mrs. Lincoln.
She's in Willie's room.

895
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:39,555
She never goes in there.

896
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:43,059
The reception line is already
stretching out the door.

897
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:47,981
See, I'll be the only man
over 15 and under 65...

898
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:50,108
...in this whole place
not in uniform.

899
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:51,651
I'm under 15.

900
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:14,340
My head hurts so.

901
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:20,555
I prayed for death
the night Willie died.

902
00:52:21,723 --> 00:52:24,892
My headaches are how I know
I didn't get my wish.

903
00:52:27,437 --> 00:52:30,898
How to endure
the long afternoon...

904
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,442
...and deep into the night.

905
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:33,735
I know.

906
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:36,988
Trying not to think about him.
How will I manage?

907
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,948
- Somehow. You will.
- Somehow?

908
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,118
Somehow. Somehow.

909
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:45,830
Every party.

910
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:47,790
Every...

911
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:52,170
And now...

912
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:56,466
...four more years
in this terrible house...

913
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:58,343
...reproaching us.

914
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:02,055
He was a very sick little boy.

915
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:04,557
We should have canceled
that reception, shouldn't we?

916
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,059
We didn't know
how sick he was.

917
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:07,685
I knew. I knew.

918
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:11,147
I saw that night
he was dying.

919
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:14,650
Three years ago,
the war was going so badly.

920
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:17,445
We had to put on a face.

921
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:20,698
But I saw Willie was dying.

922
00:53:20,782 --> 00:53:22,533
I saw him.

923
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:26,496
It's too hard.

924
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:33,795
Too hard.

925
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,262
Oh, gracious saints!

926
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:59,195
She's just ten feet yonder.
I'd like to keep my job.

927
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:03,866
Senator Sumner.
It's been much too long.

928
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,576
"Oh, who can look
on that celestial face--"

929
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,661
And?

930
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,246
James Ashley, ma'am.
We've met several times.

931
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:10,039
Praise heavens,
praise heavens.

932
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:12,333
Just when I had abandoned hope
of amusement...

933
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:13,709
...it's the Chairman
of the House Ways...

934
00:54:13,793 --> 00:54:15,670
- and Means Committee.
- Mrs. Lincoln.

935
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:18,423
Madame President,
if you please.

936
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,260
Don't convene
another subcommittee...

937
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:23,469
...to investigate me, sir.

938
00:54:23,553 --> 00:54:25,388
I'm teasing.
Smile, Senator Wade.

939
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:27,348
I believe I am smiling,
Mrs. Lincoln.

940
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:28,641
As long as
your household accounts...

941
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:30,560
...are in order, madam...

942
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:32,937
...we'll have no need
to investigate them.

943
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,940
You have always taken
such a lively...

944
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:39,861
...even prosecutorial interest
in my household accounts.

945
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:42,572
Your household accounts have
always been so interesting.

946
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:44,740
Yes, thank you. It's true.

947
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:47,702
The miracles I have wrought...

948
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:50,329
...out of fertilizer bills
and cutlery invoices...

949
00:54:50,413 --> 00:54:51,998
...but I had to.

950
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:55,209
Four years ago, when
the President and I arrived,

951
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:56,752
...this was pure pigsty.

952
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:58,838
Tobacco stains
on the Turkey carpets.

953
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:02,467
Mushrooms, green as the moon,
sprouting from the ceilings.

954
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,845
And a pauper's pittance
allotted for improvements.

955
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:08,890
As if your committee joined
with all of Washington...

956
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:10,475
...awaiting in
what you anticipated...

957
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:13,019
...would be our comfort
in squalor.

958
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:15,813
Further proof that
my husband and I...

959
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:17,607
...were prairie primitives...

960
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,776
...unsuited to the position to
which an error of the people,

961
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,363
...a flaw in the Democratic
process had elevated us.

962
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:27,366
The past is the past.
It's a new year now...

963
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:31,579
...and we are all getting
along, or so they tell me.

964
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,831
I gather
we are working together.

965
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:35,917
The White House
and the other House...

966
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:37,293
...hatching little plans
together.

967
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:38,419
- Mother.
- What?

968
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:40,630
You're creating a bottleneck.

969
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:42,548
Oh, I'm detaining you.

970
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:46,344
And more importantly,
the people behind you.

971
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:49,639
How the people
love my husband.

972
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:54,101
They flock to see him by their
thousands on public days.

973
00:55:54,602 --> 00:55:57,647
They will never love you
the way they love him.

974
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:01,901
How difficult it must be
for you to know that...

975
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:04,654
...and yet how important
to remember it.

976
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,042
Since we have the floor
next in the debate,

977
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,503
...I thought I'd suggest
you might...

978
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,047
...temper your contribution...

979
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,133
...so as not to frighten
our conservative friends.

980
00:56:26,259 --> 00:56:28,302
Ashley insists
you're ensuring approval...

981
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:30,304
...by dispensing patronage...

982
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:33,057
...to otherwise
undeserving Democrats.

983
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,017
I can't ensure
a single damn thing...

984
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:36,769
...if you scare
the whole House silly...

985
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:38,604
...with talk of
land appropriations...

986
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:40,606
...and revolutionary
tribunals.

987
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,067
When the war ends,
I intend to...

988
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:47,947
...push for full equality,
the Negro vote, and much more.

989
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:50,366
Congress shall
mandate the seizure...

990
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:51,993
...of every foot
of Rebel land...

991
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:54,662
...and every dollar
of their property.

992
00:56:55,997 --> 00:56:57,540
We'll use their
confiscated wealth...

993
00:56:57,623 --> 00:56:59,584
...to establish
hundreds of thousands...

994
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:01,210
...of free Negro farmers...

995
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:03,963
...and, at their side,
soldiers armed to occupy...

996
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:05,590
...and transform
the heritage of traitors.

997
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:08,759
We'll build up
a land down there...

998
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:11,971
...of free men and free women
and free children and freedom.

999
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:16,851
The nation needs to know
that we have such plans.

1000
00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:20,521
That's the untempered version
of reconstruction.

1001
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,358
It is not...

1002
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:26,986
It's not quite exactly
what I intend.

1003
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:32,742
But we shall oppose one
another in the course of time.

1004
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:34,869
Now we're working together,
and I'm asking you--

1005
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:36,245
For patience, I expect.

1006
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,080
When the people disagree,
bringing them together...

1007
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,708
...requires going slow
until they're ready to--

1008
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,877
Shit on the people
and what they want...

1009
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,961
...and what they're ready for.

1010
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:45,254
I don't give a goddamn
about the people...

1011
00:57:45,338 --> 00:57:46,589
...and what they want.

1012
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:47,840
This is the face of someone...

1013
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:49,300
...who has fought
long and hard...

1014
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:50,509
...for the good
of the people...

1015
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:53,262
...without caring much
for any of them.

1016
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,056
And now I look a lot worse
without the wig.

1017
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,894
The people elected me
to represent them...

1018
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:02,563
...to lead them, and I lead.
You ought to try it.

1019
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:08,527
I admire your zeal,
Mr. Stevens...

1020
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:12,365
...and I have tried to profit
from the example of it, but...

1021
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:14,450
...if I'd listened to you,

1022
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:15,910
...I'd have declared
every slave free...

1023
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:18,537
...the minute the first shell
struck Fort Sumter.

1024
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:20,164
And the border states
would have gone over...

1025
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:22,416
...to the Confederacy, the war
would have been lost...

1026
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,918
...and the Union
along with it,

1027
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:25,961
...and instead of
abolishing slavery...

1028
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:27,755
...as we hope to do
in two weeks,

1029
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,424
...we'd be watching, helpless
as infants, as it spread...

1030
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:32,635
...from the American South
into South America.

1031
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:35,513
Oh, how you have longed
to say that to me.

1032
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,140
You claim you trust them,

1033
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:40,559
...but you know
what the people are.

1034
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:44,188
You know that
the inner compass,

1035
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,774
...that should direct the soul
towards justice...

1036
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:50,486
...has ossified in white men
and women, North and South...

1037
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:52,363
...unto utter uselessness,

1038
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,657
...through tolerating
the evil of slavery.

1039
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,826
White people
cannot bear the thought...

1040
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:58,786
...of sharing this country's
infinite abundance...

1041
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,454
...with Negroes.

1042
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:05,793
A compass, I learned
when I was surveying...

1043
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,630
...it'll point you true north
from where you're standing.

1044
00:59:09,714 --> 00:59:11,549
But it's got
no advice about...

1045
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:14,260
...the swamps and deserts
and chasms...

1046
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:16,887
...that you'll encounter
along the way.

1047
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:18,389
If in pursuit
of your destination,

1048
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,391
...you plunge ahead,
heedless of obstacles...

1049
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:23,894
...and achieve nothing more
than to sink in a swamp...

1050
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:27,648
...what's the use
of knowing true north?

1051
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:47,293
Robert's going to plead
with us to let him enlist.

1052
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:53,966
Make time to talk to Robbie.
You only have time for Tad.

1053
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,509
Tad is young.

1054
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:59,722
So is Robert.
Too young for the Army.

1055
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:02,850
Plenty of boys younger
than Robert signing up.

1056
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,480
Don't take Robbie.

1057
01:00:08,189 --> 01:00:09,940
Don't let me lose my son.

1058
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,861
Go away! We're occupied!

1059
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:18,991
Secretary Stanton
is sent over...

1060
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:20,534
...to tell you that
as of half hour ago...

1061
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,912
...the shelling of Wilmington
Harbor has commenced.

1062
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:30,878
They cannot possibly maintain
under this kind of an assault.

1063
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:33,464
Terry has got 10,000 men
surrounding the goddamn port.

1064
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:34,548
Why doesn't he answer--

1065
01:00:34,632 --> 01:00:36,592
Fort Fisher is a mountain
of a building, Edwin.

1066
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:37,760
It's the largest fort
they have, sir.

1067
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,720
Twenty-two big Seacoast guns
on each rampart.

1068
01:00:39,804 --> 01:00:41,055
They've been reinforcing it
for the last two years.

1069
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,265
They've taken 17,000 shells
since yesterday!

1070
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,976
I want to hear
Fort Fisher is ours...

1071
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,311
...and Wilmington has fallen.

1072
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:48,896
Send another damn cable!

1073
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,565
The problem's their commander,
Whiting!

1074
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:53,776
He engineered
the fortress himself--

1075
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:54,902
...the damn thing's his child.

1076
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,363
He'll defend it till his
every last man is gone.

1077
01:00:57,446 --> 01:00:59,740
"Come on out, you old rat!"

1078
01:01:03,202 --> 01:01:05,955
That's what
Ethan Allen called out...

1079
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,583
...to the commander
of Fort Ticonderoga in 1776.

1080
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,752
"Come on out, you old rat!"

1081
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,088
Of course,
there were only...

1082
01:01:14,213 --> 01:01:16,590
...40 odd redcoats
at Ticonderoga.

1083
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,512
There is one Ethan Allen story
that I'm very partial to.

1084
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:24,098
No, you're going
to tell a story.

1085
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:27,142
I don't believe
that I can bear...

1086
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:29,061
...to listen to another one
of your stories right now.

1087
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:32,773
I need the B&O side yard
schedules for Alexandria!

1088
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,358
I asked for them this morning!

1089
01:01:36,986 --> 01:01:39,029
It was
right after the Revolution,

1090
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:41,448
...right after peace
had been concluded.

1091
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:44,493
And Ethan Allen
went to London...

1092
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:46,245
...to help our new country...

1093
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:48,789
...conduct its business
with the King.

1094
01:01:49,665 --> 01:01:52,376
The English sneered
at how rough we are...

1095
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:54,795
...and rude and simple-minded,
and on like that,

1096
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,880
...everywhere he went...

1097
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:58,966
...till one day he was invited
to the townhouse...

1098
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,010
...of a great English lord.

1099
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:06,223
Dinner was served
and beverages imbibed...

1100
01:02:07,016 --> 01:02:09,393
...time passed,
as happens, and...

1101
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:12,146
...Mr. Allen found
he needed the privy.

1102
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:16,275
He was grateful
to be directed thence.

1103
01:02:19,987 --> 01:02:22,072
Relieved, you might say.

1104
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:26,827
Now, Mr. Allen discovered...

1105
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:28,913
...on entering
the water closet,

1106
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:31,582
...that the only
decoration therein...

1107
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:34,335
...was a portrait
of George Washington.

1108
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:40,174
Ethan Allen done
what he came to do,

1109
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:42,635
...and returned
to the drawing room.

1110
01:02:43,344 --> 01:02:45,471
His host and the others
were disappointed...

1111
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:47,598
...when he didn't mention
Washington's portrait.

1112
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:50,309
Finally, His Lordship couldn't
resist and asked Mr. Allen...

1113
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:52,061
...had he noticed it,
the picture of Washington.

1114
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:53,604
He had.

1115
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,272
Well, what did he think
of its placement,

1116
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:58,400
...did it seem appropriately
located to Mr. Allen?

1117
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,569
Mr. Allen said it did.

1118
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,363
His host was astounded.

1119
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:04,531
"Appropriate?

1120
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:07,534
George Washington's likeness
in a water closet?"

1121
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:10,996
"Yes," said Mr. Allen.
"Where it'll do good service."

1122
01:03:11,747 --> 01:03:13,832
"The whole world knows nothing
will make an Englishman...

1123
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,085
...shit quicker than the sight
of George Washington."

1124
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,424
I love that story.

1125
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,578
Fort Fisher is ours.
We've taken the port.

1126
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:53,205
And Wilmington?

1127
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,458
We've taken the fort,

1128
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:58,711
...but the city of Wilmington
has not surrendered.

1129
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,422
How many casualties?

1130
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,728
- Heavy losses.
- And more to come.

1131
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:18,397
It sours the national mood.
It might suffice--

1132
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,357
To what? To bring this down?

1133
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:22,943
Not in a fight like this.
This is to the death.

1134
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:24,611
That's gruesome.

1135
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:27,364
Are you despairing
or merely lazy?

1136
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:30,576
This fight is for
the United States of America.

1137
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:33,620
Nothing "suffices."
A rumor? Nothing.

1138
01:04:33,746 --> 01:04:36,623
They're not lazy.
They're busily buying votes...

1139
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:40,002
...while we hope to be saved
by "the national mood"?

1140
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:49,595
Before this blood is dry, when
Stevens next takes the floor,

1141
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:51,388
...taunt him.
You excel at that.

1142
01:04:51,472 --> 01:04:53,557
Get him to proclaim what
we all know he believes...

1143
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,309
...in his coal-colored heart.

1144
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:58,103
That this vote is meant
to set the black race on high,

1145
01:04:58,187 --> 01:04:59,188
...to nigger ate America--

1146
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:01,690
George, please,
stay on course.

1147
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,651
Bring Stevens to full froth.

1148
01:05:05,486 --> 01:05:07,237
I can ensure
that every newspaperman...

1149
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:08,697
...from Louisville
to San Francisco...

1150
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:10,616
...will be here
to witness it and print it.

1151
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:15,913
The floor belongs to
the mellifluent gentleman...

1152
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:18,499
...from Kentucky,
Mr. George Yeaman.

1153
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:26,465
I thank you, Speaker Colfax.

1154
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:37,935
Although I am disgusted
by slavery...

1155
01:05:42,106 --> 01:05:44,691
...I rise on this sad
and solemn day...

1156
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,487
...to announce that
I'm opposed to the amendment.

1157
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:56,787
We must consider what
will become of colored folk...

1158
01:05:56,870 --> 01:06:00,707
...if four million are,
in one instant, set free.

1159
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:02,417
They'll be free, George,

1160
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:04,294
...that's what
will become of them.

1161
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:06,630
Think how splendid...

1162
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:09,508
...if Mr. Yeaman switched.

1163
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:12,469
Too publicly against us.
He can't change course now.

1164
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:15,639
Not for some miserable
little job, anyways.

1165
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:18,934
And we will be forced
to enfranchise...

1166
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:21,311
...the men
of the colored race.

1167
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:23,438
It would be inhuman not to.

1168
01:06:24,231 --> 01:06:27,818
Now who among us is prepared
to give Negroes the vote?

1169
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,529
And...and...

1170
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:32,906
...what shall follow
upon that?

1171
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:35,701
Universal enfranchisement?

1172
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,036
Votes for women?

1173
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:47,004
We...

1174
01:06:49,548 --> 01:06:50,591
Bless my eyes.

1175
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:53,218
If it isn't the Postmaster
of Millersburg, Ohio.

1176
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:58,432
Mr. LeClerk felt honor-bound
to inform us...

1177
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,310
...of your
disgusting betrayal.

1178
01:07:02,603 --> 01:07:04,271
Your prostitution.

1179
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,733
Is that true,
Postmaster Hawkins?

1180
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:11,361
Is your maidenly virtue
for sale?

1181
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:15,157
<i>If my neighbors hear...</i>

1182
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,450
...that I voted yes
for nigger freedom...

1183
01:07:16,575 --> 01:07:17,951
...and no to peace,
they will kill me.

1184
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:19,119
A deal is a deal.

1185
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:20,829
You men know better
than to piss your pants...

1186
01:07:20,913 --> 01:07:22,372
just 'cause there's talk
about peace talks.

1187
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:24,374
- Look, I'll find another job!
- My neighbors in Nashville,

1188
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:26,001
...they found out
I was loyal to the Union,

1189
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,461
...they came after me
with gelding knives.

1190
01:07:27,586 --> 01:07:29,087
- I'll find another job.
- You do right, Clay Hawkins.

1191
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:32,549
I want to do right!
But I got no courage!

1192
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:34,301
Wait. You wanted--
What was it?

1193
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,178
A tax man
for the Western Reserve?

1194
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:38,055
Hell, you can have the whole
state of Ohio if you want--

1195
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:39,640
Oh, crap.

1196
01:07:42,476 --> 01:07:43,727
<i>Eleven votes?</i>

1197
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,146
Two days ago, we had twelve.
What happened?

1198
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,231
There are defections
in the ranks.

1199
01:07:47,314 --> 01:07:48,315
It's the goddamn rumors...

1200
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:49,399
...regarding
the Richmond delegation.

1201
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:50,484
- Yes. The peace offer.
- Groundless.

1202
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:53,195
- And yet the rumors persist.
- They are ruining us.

1203
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,322
Among the few
remaining Representatives...

1204
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:56,990
...who seem
remotely plausible,

1205
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:59,618
...there is a perceptible
increase in resistance.

1206
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:01,328
Resistance, hell.

1207
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:04,248
Thingamabob Hollister,
Dem from Indiana...

1208
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:07,125
...I approached him,
sumbitch near to murdered me.

1209
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:10,087
Colorado Territory...
What's this one?

1210
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:13,840
Job description...taxpayers
and--

1211
01:08:13,924 --> 01:08:15,592
Oh, shit! Cracky!

1212
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:27,604
Fuck you, you son of a bitch!
Goddamn!

1213
01:08:33,694 --> 01:08:36,196
- Perhaps you pushed too hard.
- I push nobody.

1214
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,032
Perhaps we need
reinforcements.

1215
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:41,743
If Jeff Davis wants
to cease hostilities...

1216
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:44,288
...who is going to give
a genuine solid shit...

1217
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:45,455
...to free slaves?

1218
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:46,707
Get back to it.

1219
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:49,376
And gentlemen, good day.

1220
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:52,129
We are at an impasse.

1221
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:54,589
Tell Lincoln
to deny the rumors, publicly.

1222
01:08:54,673 --> 01:08:56,091
Tell us what you expect of us.

1223
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:57,926
I expect you to do your work.

1224
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:59,511
And have sufficient
sense and taste...

1225
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:01,972
...not to presume
to instruct the President.

1226
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,056
Or me.

1227
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,852
Is there
a Confederate offer...or not?

1228
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:24,453
Gentlemen.

1229
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:29,249
I suggest you work some
changes to your proposal...

1230
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:31,335
...before you give it
to the President.

1231
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:33,587
We're eager to be on our way
to Washington.

1232
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,881
Mr. Lincoln tell you
to tell us this?

1233
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:39,801
It says "securing peace
for our two countries"...

1234
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,428
...and it goes on like that.

1235
01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:44,598
- I don't--
- There is just one country.

1236
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:46,933
You and I, we're citizens
of that country.

1237
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:50,395
I'm fighting to protect it
from armed rebels.

1238
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:52,189
From you.

1239
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:54,191
But Mr. Blair, he told us,

1240
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:56,610
...he told President
Jefferson Davis that we--

1241
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:59,321
A private citizen
like Preston Blair...

1242
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:00,489
...can say what he pleases...

1243
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:03,408
...since he has no authority
over anything.

1244
01:10:03,492 --> 01:10:06,953
If you want to discuss peace
with President Lincoln...

1245
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,956
...consider revisions.

1246
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:12,000
If we're not to discuss...

1247
01:10:12,084 --> 01:10:14,544
...a truce between
warring nations...

1248
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:16,463
...what in heaven's name
can we discuss?

1249
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:19,299
Terms of surrender.

1250
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,887
<i>"Office United States

1251
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:24,971

1254
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:32,562
<i>I will state confidentially
that I am convinced...</i>

1255
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:34,981
<i>...upon conversation
with these commissioners...</i>

1256
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:36,566
<i>...that their intentions
are good...</i>

1257
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:39,945
<i>...and their desire sincere
to restore peace and union.</i>

1258
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:42,489
<i>I fear now their going back...</i>

1259
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:45,492
<i>...without any expression
of interest from anyone...</i>

1260
01:10:45,617 --> 01:10:49,162
...in authority, Mr. Lincoln,
will have a bad influence.

1261
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:53,500
I will be sorry should it
prove impossible for you...

1262
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,085
...to have an interview
with them.

1263
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,504
I am awaiting
your instructions.

1264
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:01,591
U.S. Grant,
Lieutenant General,

1265
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:03,176
...Commanding Armies,
United States."

1266
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:07,556
After four years of war,
and...

1267
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,309
...near six hundred thousand
lives lost...

1268
01:11:11,393 --> 01:11:14,187
...he believes
we can end this war now.

1269
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:20,735
My trust in him
is marrow deep.

1270
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:29,828
You could bring the delegates
to Washington.

1271
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,372
In exchange for the South's
immediate surrender,

1272
01:11:32,456 --> 01:11:35,417
...we could promise them
the amendment's defeat.

1273
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:41,381
They'd agree, don't you think?
We'd end the war. This week.

1274
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:45,302
Or, if you could manage...

1275
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:48,472
...without seeming
to do it, to, uh...

1276
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:54,728
The peace delegation
might encounter delays...

1277
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,605
...as they travel
up the James River.

1278
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:59,149
Particularly with the fighting
around Wilmington.

1279
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,491
Within ten days' time,

1280
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:10,243
...we might pass
the 13th Amendment.

1281
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:55,080
Here's
a sixteen-year-old boy...

1282
01:12:55,163 --> 01:12:56,748
...they're going to hang him.

1283
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,626
He's with the Fifteenth
Indiana Cavalry near Bulford.

1284
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,671
It seems he lamed his horse
to avoid battle.

1285
01:13:04,548 --> 01:13:06,007
I don't think even Stanton
would complain...

1286
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:07,092
...if I pardoned him.

1287
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:08,426
You think
Stanton would complain?

1288
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:11,638
I don't know, sir. I don't
know who you're, uh...

1289
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:14,057
- What time is it?
- It's 3:40 in the morning.

1290
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:17,727
Don't let him pardon
any more deserters.

1291
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:20,522
Mr. Stanton thinks
you pardon too many.

1292
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:22,148
He's generally apoplectic
on the subject.

1293
01:13:22,274 --> 01:13:23,817
He oughtn't have done that,
crippled his horse.

1294
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:25,193
That was cruel,
but you don't just hang...

1295
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:26,319
...a sixteen-year-old boy
for that...

1296
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:27,571
Ask the horse what he thinks.

1297
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:31,241
...for cruelty. There'd be no
sixteen-year-old boys left.

1298
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:52,095
Grant wants me to bring
the secesh delegates...

1299
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:53,763
...to Washington.

1300
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:58,435
So there are secesh delegates?

1301
01:13:59,144 --> 01:14:01,396
He was afraid,
that's all it was.

1302
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:04,357
I don't care to hang a boy
for being frightened, either.

1303
01:14:05,025 --> 01:14:07,110
What good would it do him?

1304
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:24,169
War's nearly done,
ain't that so?

1305
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:29,674
What use is one more corpse?

1306
01:14:31,885 --> 01:14:33,553
Any more corpses?

1307
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:44,564
Do you need company?

1308
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:47,525
<i>In times like this,
I'm best alone.</i>

1309
01:15:26,356 --> 01:15:30,610
"Lieutenant General
Ulysses S. Grant, City Point.

1310
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:34,155
I have read your words
with interest.

1311
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,240
I ask that,

1312
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:37,784
...regardless of any action
I take in the matter...

1313
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:40,954
...of the visit of the
Richmond commissioners...

1314
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:43,540
...you maintain
among your troops...

1315
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:46,376
...military preparedness
for battle...

1316
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,671
...as you have done until now.

1317
01:15:55,844 --> 01:15:58,304
Have Captain Saunders convey
the commissioners to me...

1318
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:00,140
...here in Washington.

1319
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:03,601
A. Lincoln." And the date.

1320
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:05,103
Yes, sir.

1321
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,984
Shall I transmit, sir?

1322
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:16,865
You think we choose
to be born?

1323
01:16:22,704 --> 01:16:24,372
I don't suppose so.

1324
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:28,543
Are we fitted to the times
we're born into?

1325
01:16:30,462 --> 01:16:32,088
Well, I don't know
about myself.

1326
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:34,632
You may be...

1327
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:37,010
...sir. Fitted.

1328
01:16:41,181 --> 01:16:42,682
What do you reckon?

1329
01:16:44,768 --> 01:16:46,770
Well, I'm an engineer.

1330
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:51,357
I reckon there's machinery,

1331
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:54,360
...but...no one's
done the fitting.

1332
01:16:57,864 --> 01:16:59,532
You're an engineer.

1333
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:03,411
You must know Euclid's axioms
and common notions.

1334
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:07,499
I must have in school, but...

1335
01:17:07,582 --> 01:17:08,792
I never had much of schooling,

1336
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:11,795
...but I read Euclid
in an old book I borrowed.

1337
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:15,215
Little enough
ever found its way in here,

1338
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:17,717
...but once learnt,
it stayed learnt.

1339
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:23,264
Euclid's first common notion
is this--

1340
01:17:23,932 --> 01:17:26,309
"Things which are equal
to the same thing...

1341
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:29,145
...are equal to each other."

1342
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:33,233
That's a rule
of mathematical reasoning.

1343
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:35,610
It's true because it works.

1344
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:37,862
Has done and always will do.

1345
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:42,617
In his book, mmm...

1346
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:46,079
...Euclid says
this is "self-evident."

1347
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,122
You see? There it is...

1348
01:17:48,248 --> 01:17:50,917
...even in that
two thousand-year-old book...

1349
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,502
...of mechanical law.

1350
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:54,587
It is a self-evident truth...

1351
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:57,757
...that things which are equal
to the same thing...

1352
01:17:57,841 --> 01:18:00,093
...are equal to each other.

1353
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:05,098
We begin with equality.

1354
01:18:06,516 --> 01:18:08,059
That's the origin, isn't it?

1355
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:11,020
That's balance.
That's...That's fairness.

1356
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:17,610
That's justice.

1357
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:26,452
Just read me back
the last sentence...

1358
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:28,746
...of the telegram, please.

1359

the commissioners to me...

1361
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:35,962
A slight emendation,

01:19:47,325 --> 01:19:49,243
...New York, Chicago...

1370
01:19:49,577 --> 01:19:51,496
<i>...the Journal of Commerce...</i>

1371
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:53,122
...even your
hometown paper's here.

1372
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:56,751
Say you believe only in legal
equality for all races,

1373
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:58,211
...not racial equality...

1374
01:19:58,294 --> 01:19:59,963
...I beg you, sir.

1375
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:03,424
Compromise.
Or you risk it all.

1376
01:20:25,113 --> 01:20:27,198
I've asked you a question,
Mr. Stevens,

1377
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:29,242
...and you must answer me.

1378
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:32,245
Do you or do you not
hold that the precept...

1379
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:35,832
...that "All men are created
equal" is meant literally?

1380
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:44,257
Is that not the true purpose
of the amendment?

1381
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:47,218
To promote your ultimate
and ardent dream to elevate--

1382
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:49,721
The true purpose
of the amendment, Mr. Wood...

1383
01:20:49,804 --> 01:20:51,597
...you perfectly named,

1384
01:20:51,681 --> 01:20:53,850
...brainless
obstructive object...

1385
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:58,438
Now you have always insisted,
Mr. Stevens...

1386
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:02,900
...that Negroes are the same
as white men are.

1387
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:06,320
The true purpose
of the amendment...

1388
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:36,184
...I don't hold with
equality in all things,

1389
01:21:36,267 --> 01:21:38,394
...only with equality
before the law. Nothing more.

1390
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:42,815
That's... That's not so.

1391
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:46,819
You believe that Negroes are
entirely equal to white men.

1392
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:48,112
You've said it
a thousand times!

1393
01:21:48,196 --> 01:21:50,531
For shame! For shame!

1394
01:21:50,615 --> 01:21:53,409
Stop prevaricating and
answer Representative Wood!

1395
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,411
I don't hold with
equality in all things,

1396
01:21:55,495 --> 01:21:56,954
...only with equality
before the law.

1397
01:21:57,038 --> 01:21:59,832
After the decades
of fervent advocacy--

1398
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:01,918
He's answered your questions!

1399
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:03,753
This amendment's
not to do with race equality.

1400
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:07,006
I don't hold with
equality in all things...

1401
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:10,718
...only with equality before
the law, and nothing more!

1402
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:13,012
Who'd ever have guessed
that old nightmare...

1403
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:14,931
...capable of such control?

1404
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:16,808
He might make
a politician someday.

1405
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:18,142
I need to go.

1406
01:22:18,226 --> 01:22:19,685
Mrs. Keckley.

1407
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:25,233
Your frantic attempt
to delude us now...

1408
01:22:25,358 --> 01:22:26,943
...is unworthy
of a representative.

1409
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:29,070
It is, in fact,
unworthy of a white man!

1410
01:22:33,366 --> 01:22:35,827
How can I hold that
all men are created equal...

1411
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:39,038
...when here before me
stands, stinking...

1412
01:22:39,122 --> 01:22:42,625
...the moral carcass of the
gentleman from Ohio, proof...

1413
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:45,253
...that some men
are inferior...

1414
01:22:45,378 --> 01:22:47,880
...endowed by their Maker
with dim wits,

1415
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:49,924
...impermeable to reason...

1416
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:53,136
...with cold, pallid slime
in their veins...

1417
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:55,555
...instead of hot, red blood!

1418
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:59,392
You are more reptile
than man, George!

1419
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:01,811
So low and flat
that the foot of man...

1420
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:03,271
...is incapable
of crushing you.

1421
01:23:03,396 --> 01:23:05,148
How dare you?

1422
01:23:05,231 --> 01:23:08,359
Yet even you, Pendleton...

1423
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:11,362
...who should have been
gibbeted for treason...

1424
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:12,488
...long before today...

1425
01:23:12,572 --> 01:23:15,074
...even worthless,
unworthy you...

1426
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:18,202
...ought to be treated equally
before the law!

1427
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:23,666
And so again, sir, again
and again and again I say,

1428
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:26,878
...I do not hold with
equality in all things...

1429
01:23:26,961 --> 01:23:29,255
...only with
equality before the law.

1430
01:23:33,134 --> 01:23:36,220
Mr. Speaker, will you permit
this vile, boorish man...

1431
01:23:36,304 --> 01:23:38,764
...to slander
and to threaten me?

1432
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:40,433
And to reduce
these proceedings...

1433
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,895
...on this most important
matter into an anarchic...

1434
01:23:44,437 --> 01:23:46,731
...and tawdry burlesque?

1435
01:24:11,047 --> 01:24:14,467
You asked
if ever I was surprised.

1436
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:17,637
Today, Mr. Stevens...

1437
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,305
...I was surprised.

1438
01:24:19,764 --> 01:24:23,309
You've led the battle for
race equality for 30 years.

1439
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:31,901
The basis of every hope for
this country's future life...

1440
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:34,987
...you denied Negro equality.
I'm nauseated.

1441
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:37,657
You refused to say that
all humans are...

1442
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,492
Well, human.

1443
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:42,620
Have you lost your very soul,
Mr. Stevens?

1444
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:44,247
Is there nothing
you won't say?

1445
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:46,040
I'm sorry you're nauseous,
Asa.

1446
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:47,708
That must be unpleasant.

1447
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,253
I want the amendment to pass,

1448
01:24:50,336 --> 01:24:52,296
...so that
the Constitution's first...

1449
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:53,756
...and only mention
of slavery...

1450
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:56,050
...is its
absolute prohibition.

1451
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:58,469
For this amendment, for which
I have worked all my life...

1452
01:24:58,552 --> 01:25:01,180
...and for which countless
colored men and women...

1453
01:25:01,264 --> 01:25:02,390
...have fought and died...

1454
01:25:02,473 --> 01:25:05,476
...and now hundreds
of thousands of soldiers...

1455
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:07,186
No, sir, no.

1456
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:11,357
It seems there's very nearly
nothing I won't say.

1457
01:25:42,263 --> 01:25:43,889
I'm not going in.

1458
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:51,272
You said you wanted
to help me.

1459
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:55,568
But this is just a clumsy
attempt to discourage me.

1460
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:58,029
I've been to Army hospitals.
I've seen surgeries.

1461
01:25:58,112 --> 01:26:01,032
I went and visited
the malaria barges with Mama.

1462
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:02,992
She told me
she didn't take you inside.

1463
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:04,535
I snuck in afterwards.

1464
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:06,871
I've seen what it's like.
This changes nothing.

1465
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:11,167
Well, at all rate, son,

1466
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,044
...I'm happy
to have your company.

1467
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,428
- Good morning, Jim.
- Hello, Mr. President.

1468
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:24,347
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

1469
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:29,101
Well, boys, first question--
you getting enough to eat?

1470
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:30,436
Hello, sir.

1471
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,896
- What's your name, soldier?
- Robert.

1472
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:34,482
- Good to meet you, Robert.
- Nice to meet you.

1473
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:35,566
- What's your name?
- Kevin.

1474
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:36,692
Tell me your names
as I go past.

1475
01:26:36,776 --> 01:26:38,152
I'd like to know
who I'm talking to. Kevin.

1476
01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:41,155
- Mr. President. John.
- John. I've seen you before.

1477
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:42,281
Mr. President.

1478
01:26:43,032 --> 01:26:44,241
Make sure you
get some steak.

1479
01:26:44,325 --> 01:26:45,826
I wouldn't mind one myself,
right now.

1480
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:02,736
What's the matter, Bob?

1481
01:28:09,118 --> 01:28:11,036
I have to do this,
and I will do it.

1482
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:12,538
And I don't need
your permission to enlist.

1483
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:16,542
That same speech has been made
by how many sons...

1484
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:19,170
...to how many fathers
since the war began?

1485
01:28:19,253 --> 01:28:20,463
"I don't need
your damn permission,

1486
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:23,090
"...you miserable old goat,
I'm gonna enlist anyhow."

1487
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:24,175
And what wouldn't those...

1488
01:28:24,258 --> 01:28:25,593
...numberless fathers
have given...

1489
01:28:25,718 --> 01:28:27,511
...to be able
to say to their sons...

1490
01:28:27,595 --> 01:28:30,848
...as I now say to mine,
"I'm Commander in Chief."

1491
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:33,225
So, in point of fact,
without my permission...

1492
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:36,395
...you ain't enlisting
in nothing nowhere, young man.

1493
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,939
It's Mama you're scared of,
it's not me getting killed.

1494
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:49,408
I have to do this! And I will!

1495
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:52,995
Or I will feel ashamed
of myself the rest of my life!

1496
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:55,080
Whether or not you fought
is what's gonna matter,

1497
01:28:55,206 --> 01:28:57,917
...and not just to other
people, but to myself!

1498
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,585
I won't be you, Pa,
I can't do that,

1499
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:01,921
...but I don't want
to be nothing!

1500
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:06,926
I can't lose you.

1501
01:29:13,182 --> 01:29:15,017
He'll be fine, Molly.

1502
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,353
City Point's a way back
from the front lines...

1503
01:29:17,436 --> 01:29:18,437
...and the fighting.

1504
01:29:19,063 --> 01:29:22,441
He'll be an adjutant, running
messages for General Grant.

1505
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:25,694
The war will take our son.

1506
01:29:25,778 --> 01:29:28,364
A sniper, or a shrapnel shell,
or typhus...

1507
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:29,448
...same as took Willie.

1508
01:29:29,532 --> 01:29:32,952
It takes hundreds of boys
a day. He'll die uselessly.

1509
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:35,412
And how will I ever
forgive you?

1510
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:38,958
Most men, their firstborn
is their favorite.

1511
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:41,669
You've always blamed Robert
for being born.

1512
01:29:41,752 --> 01:29:43,087
For trapping you
in a marriage...

1513
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:44,797
...that's only ever
given you grief...

1514
01:29:44,922 --> 01:29:47,049
- ...and caused you regret.
- That's simply not true.

1515
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:48,801
And if the slaughter
of Cold Harbor's...

1516
01:29:48,926 --> 01:29:51,136
...on your hands same
as Grant, God help us.

1517
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:53,806
We'll pay for the oceans
of spilled blood...

1518
01:29:53,931 --> 01:29:56,141
...you've sanctioned,
the uncountable corpses!

1519
01:29:56,225 --> 01:29:58,978
We'll be made to pay
with our son's dear blood!

1520
01:29:59,103 --> 01:30:00,646
Just this once,
Mrs. Lincoln...

1521
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:03,482
...I demand of you to try
and take the liberal...

1522
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:05,484
...and not the selfish
point of view.

1523
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:06,819
Robert will never
forgive himself.

1524
01:30:06,944 --> 01:30:08,487
You imagine
he'll forgive us...

1525
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:12,157
...if we continue to stifle
this very natural ambition?

1526
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,369
And if I refuse
to take the high road?

1527
01:30:18,247 --> 01:30:21,584
If I won't pick up
the rough old cross...

1528
01:30:21,959 --> 01:30:24,795
...will you threaten me again
with the madhouse?

1529
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:28,382
As you did when I couldn't
stop crying over Willie.

1530
01:30:28,465 --> 01:30:30,968
When I showed you
what heartbreak...

1531
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:33,721
...real heartbreak
looked like.

1532
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:37,433
And you hadn't the courage
to countenance, to help me!

1533
01:30:37,516 --> 01:30:39,810
When you refused so much
as to comfort Tad,

1534
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:42,021
...a child who was not only
sick, dangerously sick...

1535
01:30:42,104 --> 01:30:43,147
...but beside himself
with grief!

1536
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:45,399
I was holding him in my arms
when he died.

1537
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:47,943
But your grief, your grief,
your inexhaustible grief!

1538
01:30:48,027 --> 01:30:49,903
How dare you
throw that up at me?

1539
01:30:49,987 --> 01:30:51,196
And his mother wouldn't
let him near her...

1540
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,489
...because she's screaming
from morning to night!

1541
01:30:52,573 --> 01:30:54,617
I couldn't risk him seeing
how angry I was!

1542
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:56,160
Pacing the halls,
howling at shadows...

1543
01:30:56,243 --> 01:30:57,828
...and furniture and ghosts!

1544
01:30:58,996 --> 01:31:00,998
I ought to have done it
for Tad's sake...

1545
01:31:01,081 --> 01:31:02,875
...for everybody's
goddamn sake,

1546
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,627
I should have clapped you
in the madhouse!

1547
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,128
Then do it!

1548
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:09,048
Do it! Don't you threaten me!

1549
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:11,508
You do it this time.
Lock me away.

1550
01:31:11,592 --> 01:31:13,636
You'll have to, I swear...

1551
01:31:14,011 --> 01:31:16,096
...if Robert is killed.

1552
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:37,242
I couldn't tolerate you
grieving so for Willie...

1553
01:31:37,326 --> 01:31:39,953
...because I couldn't
permit it in myself.

1554
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:42,539
Though I wanted to, Mary.

1555
01:31:43,499 --> 01:31:45,417
I wanted to
crawl under the earth,

1556
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:47,753
...into the vault,
with his coffin.

1557
01:31:49,129 --> 01:31:52,758
And I still do.
Every day I do.

1558
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:55,803
Don't speak to me about grief.

1559
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:08,899
I must make my decisions,
Bob must make his, you yours.

1560
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:12,361
And bear what we must.
Hold and carry what we must.

1561
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:16,115
What I carry within me,
you must allow me to do it.

1562
01:32:16,198 --> 01:32:19,118
Alone, as I must.
And you alone, Mary,

1563
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:22,788
...you alone
may lighten this burden.

1564
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:25,874
Or render it intolerable.

1565
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:27,960
As you choose.

1566
01:32:49,732 --> 01:32:51,775
You think I'm ignorant
of what you're up to...

1567
01:32:51,859 --> 01:32:52,901
...because you
haven't discussed...

1568
01:32:52,985 --> 01:32:55,320
...this scheme with me
as you ought to have done?

1569
01:32:55,404 --> 01:32:58,198
When have I ever been
so easily bamboozled?

1570
01:32:58,574 --> 01:32:59,867
I believe you
when you insist...

1571
01:32:59,992 --> 01:33:01,493
...that amending
the Constitution...

1572
01:33:01,577 --> 01:33:03,537
...and abolishing slavery
will end this war.

1573
01:33:03,662 --> 01:33:05,998
And since you are
sending my son into the war,

1574
01:33:06,123 --> 01:33:09,168
...woe unto you if you fail
to pass the amendment.

1575
01:33:12,337 --> 01:33:15,340
Seward doesn't want me leaving
big muddy footprints...

1576
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:16,967
...all over town.

1577
01:33:20,679 --> 01:33:22,723
No one has ever lived
who knows better than you...

1578
01:33:22,848 --> 01:33:24,933
...the proper placement
of footfalls...

1579
01:33:25,017 --> 01:33:26,894
...on treacherous paths.

1580
01:33:27,019 --> 01:33:29,730
Seward can't do it. You must.

1581
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:34,151
Because if you fail to acquire
the necessary votes...

1582
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:37,196
...woe unto you, sir.
You will answer to me.

1583
01:33:51,502 --> 01:33:52,836
Thank you.

1584
01:33:59,009 --> 01:34:01,762
I know the vote
is only four days away.

1585
01:34:02,429 --> 01:34:04,097
I know you're concerned.

1586
01:34:04,223 --> 01:34:06,266
Thank you for your
concern over this.

1587
01:34:07,226 --> 01:34:10,020
And I want you to know,
they'll approve it.

1588
01:34:11,355 --> 01:34:13,065
God will see to it.

1589
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:16,902
I don't envy Him his task.

1590
01:34:18,612 --> 01:34:21,073
He may wish He'd chosen an
instrument for His purpose...

1591
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:24,201
...more wieldy than
the House of Representatives.

1592
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:27,246
Then you'll see to it.

1593
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:32,835
Are you afraid of what
lies ahead for your people...

1594
01:34:32,918 --> 01:34:34,419
...if we succeed?

1595
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:38,215
White people
don't want us here.

1596
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:40,926
- Many don't.
- What about you?

1597
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:48,725
I don't know you,
Mrs. Keckley.

1598
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:51,103
Any of you.

1599
01:34:52,563 --> 01:34:55,566
You're familiar to me,
as all people are...

1600
01:34:56,817 --> 01:34:59,778
...unaccommodated, poor, bare,
forked creatures,

1601
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:01,613
...such as we all are.

1602
01:35:02,906 --> 01:35:05,617
You have a right
to expect what I expect.

1603
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:08,120
And likely our expectations...

1604
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:10,622
...are not incomprehensible
to each other.

1605
01:35:14,293 --> 01:35:16,545
I assume I'll get used to you.

1606
01:35:17,546 --> 01:35:19,464
Now what you are
to the nation,

1607
01:35:20,716 --> 01:35:23,218
...what'll become of you
once slavery's day is done...

1608
01:35:23,302 --> 01:35:25,095
...I don't know.

1609
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:29,474
What my people are to be,
I can't say.

1610
01:35:31,602 --> 01:35:34,563
Negroes have been fighting
and dying for freedom

1611
01:35:35,272 --> 01:35:37,107
since the first of us was a slave.

1612
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:41,486
I never heard any ask
what freedom would bring.

1613
01:35:43,447 --> 01:35:45,073
Freedom is first.

1614
01:35:47,993 --> 01:35:49,328
As for me...

1615
01:35:50,996 --> 01:35:53,665
...my son died
fighting for the Union...

1616
01:35:54,917 --> 01:35:56,960
...wearing the Union blue.

1617
01:35:57,502 --> 01:35:59,296
For freedom he died.

1618
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:03,091
And I'm his mother.

1619
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:08,180
That's what I am
to the nation, Mr. Lincoln.

1620
01:36:12,517 --> 01:36:14,311
What else must I be?

1621
01:36:23,612 --> 01:36:25,614
My whole hand's gonna be proud
in about five seconds.

1622
01:36:25,697 --> 01:36:27,324
Let's see how proud
you can be.

1623
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:31,036
Go away.
That watch fob, is that gold?

1624
01:36:31,161 --> 01:36:32,704
You keep your eyes off my fob.

1625
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:35,040
Gentlemen, you have a visitor.

1626
01:36:35,123 --> 01:36:37,209
- Goddamn!
- Hey, Bill.

1627
01:36:39,378 --> 01:36:41,046
Well, I'll be fucked.

1628
01:36:41,129 --> 01:36:42,547
I wouldn't bet against it.

1629
01:36:42,673 --> 01:36:43,840
Mr, uh...?

1630
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:45,968
W. N. Bilbo.

1631
01:36:46,051 --> 01:36:48,136
Yeah, Mr. Bilbo. Gentlemen.

1632
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:49,554
Sir.

1633
01:36:49,638 --> 01:36:51,139
Why are you here? No offense,

1634
01:36:51,223 --> 01:36:54,559
...but Mr. Seward's banished
the very mention of your name.

1635
01:36:54,643 --> 01:36:56,311
He won't even let us
use fifty cent pieces...

1636
01:36:56,395 --> 01:36:58,188
...'cause they've got
your face on 'em.

1637
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:01,566
The Secretary of State here
tells me that you got...

1638
01:37:01,692 --> 01:37:04,152
...11 Democrats in the bag.
That's encouraging.

1639
01:37:04,236 --> 01:37:07,990
Oh, you've got no cause
to be encouraged, sir.

1640
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:11,326
Are we being fired?

1641
01:37:12,703 --> 01:37:16,581
"We have heard the chimes
at midnight, Master Shallow."

1642
01:37:17,582 --> 01:37:19,084
I'm here to alert you boys...

1643
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:22,212
...that the great day
of reckoning is nigh upon us.

1644
01:37:22,713 --> 01:37:24,589
The Democrats
we've yet to bag, sir,

1645
01:37:24,715 --> 01:37:27,426
...the patronage jobs
simply won't bag 'em.

1646
01:37:27,551 --> 01:37:30,095
They require more convincing,
Mr. President.

1647
01:37:33,348 --> 01:37:34,683
Do me a favor, will you?

1648
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:35,851
Sure.

1649
01:37:35,934 --> 01:37:37,936
It snagged my eye in the paper
this morning...

1650
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:39,438
...that the Governor Curtin...

1651
01:37:39,563 --> 01:37:41,857
...is set to declare a winner
in the disputed...

1652
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:42,941
...Congressional election
for the--

1653
01:37:43,066 --> 01:37:44,192
Pennsylvania 16th District.

1654
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:47,362
...District.
What a joy to be comprehended.

1655
01:37:47,446 --> 01:37:50,032
Hop on a train to Philadel,
call on the Governor--

1656
01:37:50,115 --> 01:37:51,533
Send Latham. Or Schell.

1657
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,618
No, he'll do fine.
Just polish yourself up first.

1658
01:37:55,537 --> 01:37:57,622
The incumbent is claiming
he won it. Name of--

1659
01:37:57,748 --> 01:37:58,707
Coffroth.

1660
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,042
- That's him.
- Coffroth.

1661
01:38:00,125 --> 01:38:01,960
- He's a Democrat.
- I understand that.

1662
01:38:02,711 --> 01:38:04,755
- Silly name.
- A little bit silly.

1663
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:08,300
Uh, tell Governor Curtin
it'd be much appreciated...

1664
01:38:08,383 --> 01:38:10,969
...if he'd invite the
House of Representatives...

1665
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:12,054
...to decide who won.

1666
01:38:12,137 --> 01:38:14,806
He's entitled to do that.
He'll agree to it.

1667
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:17,225
Then advise Coffroth...

1668
01:38:17,309 --> 01:38:19,644
...if he hopes
to retain his seat,

1669
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:22,064
then he'd better pay a visit
to Thaddeus Stevens.

1670
01:38:22,147 --> 01:38:23,774
Well,
pity poor Coffroth.

1671
01:38:26,068 --> 01:38:27,319
It opens!

1672
01:38:34,326 --> 01:38:35,660
You are Canfrey?

1673
01:38:37,746 --> 01:38:40,916
Coffroth, Mr. Stevens.
Alexander Coffroth.

1674
01:38:40,999 --> 01:38:43,919
Are we representatives
of the same state?

1675
01:38:44,002 --> 01:38:45,962
Yes, sir.
We sit only three desks apart.

1676
01:38:46,046 --> 01:38:47,923
I haven't noticed you.

1677
01:38:48,507 --> 01:38:51,510
I'm a Republican and you,
Coughdrop, are a Democrat?

1678
01:38:51,635 --> 01:38:55,013
Well, uh, I, um,
that is to say--

1679
01:38:55,097 --> 01:38:57,099
The modern travesty
of Thomas Jefferson's...

1680
01:38:57,182 --> 01:38:58,350
...political organization...

1681
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:00,185
...to which you've attached
yourself like a barnacle...

1682
01:39:00,268 --> 01:39:03,522
...has the effrontery to call
itself the Democratic Party.

1683
01:39:03,647 --> 01:39:06,525
You are a Democrat.
What's the matter with you?

1684
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:08,276
Are you wicked?

1685
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,945
- Well, I felt--
- Never mind.

1686
01:39:10,028 --> 01:39:12,280
Coffsnot, you were
ignominiously trounced...

1687
01:39:12,364 --> 01:39:13,949
...at the hustings
in November's election...

1688
01:39:14,032 --> 01:39:16,034
...by your worthy challenger,
a Republican.

1689
01:39:16,118 --> 01:39:17,953
No, sir, I was not trounced.

1690
01:39:18,036 --> 01:39:20,038
He wants to steal my seat.
I didn't lose the election.

1691
01:39:20,163 --> 01:39:21,623
What difference does it make
if you lost or not?

1692
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:25,836
The governor of our state
is... A Democrat?

1693
01:39:27,045 --> 01:39:29,381
No, he's, he's a...

1694
01:39:30,382 --> 01:39:32,342
Re-...

1695
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:34,636
Re-...

1696
01:39:35,846 --> 01:39:38,056
- ...-pub-...-lic-...
- ...-pub-...-lic-...

1697
01:39:38,181 --> 01:39:39,724
- ...-can.
- ...-can. Republican.

1698
01:39:39,808 --> 01:39:41,977
I know what he is.
This is a rhetorical exercise.

1699
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:43,979
And Congress is controlled
by what party? Yours?

1700
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:48,233
Your party was beaten.

1701
01:39:48,358 --> 01:39:50,902
Your challenger's party
now controls the House...

1702
01:39:50,986 --> 01:39:53,655
...and hence the House
Committee on Elections...

1703
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:56,241
...so you have been beaten.

1704
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:59,244
You shall shortly be sent home
in disgrace. Unless...

1705
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:00,328
I know what I must do, sir.

1706
01:40:00,412 --> 01:40:02,664
I will immediately become
a Republican and vote yes--

1707
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:04,207
No!

1708
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:06,918
Coffroth will vote yes...

1709
01:40:07,544 --> 01:40:09,004
...but Coffroth
will remain a Democrat

1710
01:40:09,087 --> 01:40:10,088
until after he does so.

1711
01:40:10,172 --> 01:40:11,756
Why wait to switch?
I'm happy to--

1712
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,092
We want to show the amendment
has bipartisan support,

1713
01:40:14,176 --> 01:40:16,094
...you idiot.
Early in the next Congress,

1714
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:18,430
when I tell you to do so,
you will switch parties.

1715
01:40:18,555 --> 01:40:22,100
Now congratulations
on your victory, and get out.

1716
01:40:22,184 --> 01:40:24,603
Now, give me the names...

1717
01:40:24,728 --> 01:40:26,605
...of whoever else
you've been hunting.

1718
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:28,273
Aw, hell.

1719
01:40:28,607 --> 01:40:29,691
George Yeaman.

1720
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:31,193
Yes. Yeaman.

1721
01:40:31,902 --> 01:40:33,361
Among others.

1722
01:40:33,445 --> 01:40:35,030
- But Yeaman, that'd count.
- Yeah.

1723
01:40:35,113 --> 01:40:36,948
Y-E-A-M-A-N.

1724
01:40:37,449 --> 01:40:38,700
I got it.

1725
01:40:39,618 --> 01:40:40,619
Kentucky.

1726
01:40:43,747 --> 01:40:46,791
I can't vote for
the amendment, Mr. Lincoln.

1727
01:40:54,132 --> 01:40:56,343
I saw a barge once,
Mr. Yeaman...

1728
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,304
...filled with
colored men in chains...

1729
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:00,639
...heading down
the Mississippi...

1730
01:41:00,722 --> 01:41:02,641
...to the New Orleans
slave markets.

1731
01:41:04,059 --> 01:41:05,268
It sickened me.

1732
01:41:06,603 --> 01:41:09,064
And more than that,
it brought a shadow down.

1733
01:41:10,607 --> 01:41:12,943
A pall around my eyes.

1734
01:41:14,611 --> 01:41:17,280
Slavery troubled me
as long as I can remember...

1735
01:41:18,114 --> 01:41:20,367
...in a way it never
troubled my father...

1736
01:41:21,326 --> 01:41:24,037
...though he hated it,
in his own fashion.

1737
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,040
He knew no
smallholding dirt farmer...

1738
01:41:27,123 --> 01:41:28,875
...could compete with
slave plantations...

1739
01:41:28,959 --> 01:41:31,211
...so he took us out
from Kentucky...

1740
01:41:31,294 --> 01:41:32,545
...to get away from 'em.

1741
01:41:32,629 --> 01:41:34,422
He wanted Indiana kept free.

1742
01:41:36,007 --> 01:41:37,676
He wasn't a kind man...

1743
01:41:39,261 --> 01:41:42,722
...but there was a rough,
moral urge for fairness,

1744
01:41:42,847 --> 01:41:44,182
...for freedom in him.

1745
01:41:45,225 --> 01:41:47,185
I learnt that from him,
I suppose.

1746
01:41:48,061 --> 01:41:49,396
If little else from him.

1747
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:53,775
We didn't care
for one another, Mr. Yeaman.

1748
01:41:57,862 --> 01:41:59,281
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1749
01:41:59,364 --> 01:42:02,617
Loving kindness, the most
ordinary thing, came to me...

1750
01:42:02,701 --> 01:42:04,869
...from other sources.
I'm grateful for that.

1751
01:42:04,953 --> 01:42:07,789
Well, I hate it, too, sir.

1752
01:42:09,207 --> 01:42:10,542
Slavery, but...

1753
01:42:11,584 --> 01:42:14,462
But we're entirely unready
for emancipation.

1754
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:16,172
And there's
too many questions--

1755
01:42:16,256 --> 01:42:17,590
We're unready for peace,
too, ain't we?

1756
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,052
Yeah, when it comes, it'll
present us with conundrums...

1757
01:42:21,136 --> 01:42:24,472
...and dangers greater than
any we faced during the war,

1758
01:42:24,556 --> 01:42:26,308
...bloody as it's been.

1759
01:42:26,391 --> 01:42:30,270
We'll have to extemporize and
experiment with what it is,

1760
01:42:30,395 --> 01:42:31,479
...when it is.

1761
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:36,568
I read your speech, George.

1762
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:39,154
Negroes and the vote...

1763
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:41,406
...that's a puzzle.

1764
01:42:42,282 --> 01:42:45,910
No, no.
But, but, but Negroes can't...

1765
01:42:46,745 --> 01:42:49,789
...uh, vote, Mr. Lincoln.

1766
01:42:50,999 --> 01:42:52,959
You're not suggesting we
enfranchise colored people?

1767
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:54,502
I'm asking only that...

1768
01:42:54,586 --> 01:42:58,423
...you disenthrall yourself
from the slave powers.

1769
01:42:59,966 --> 01:43:01,051
I'll let you know when...

1770
01:43:01,134 --> 01:43:02,761
...there's an offer on my desk
for surrender.

1771
01:43:02,886 --> 01:43:04,054
There's none before us now.

1772
01:43:04,137 --> 01:43:05,263
What's before us now,

1773
01:43:05,388 --> 01:43:08,099
...that's the vote on
the 13th Amendment.

1774
01:43:09,476 --> 01:43:11,728
And it's going to be
so very close.

1775
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:16,900
You see what you can do.

1776
01:43:26,242 --> 01:43:27,744
I can't make sense of it.

1777
01:43:28,286 --> 01:43:30,246
What he died for.

1778
01:43:32,832 --> 01:43:35,126
Mr. Lincoln, I hate them all.

1779
01:43:35,251 --> 01:43:37,337
I do. All black people.

1780
01:43:46,846 --> 01:43:49,099
I am a prejudiced man.

1781
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:53,686
Well, I'd change that
in you if I could,

1782
01:43:53,937 --> 01:43:55,313
...but that's not why I come.

1783
01:43:56,147 --> 01:43:57,816
I might be wrong,
Mr. Hutton...

1784
01:43:57,941 --> 01:44:01,319
...but I expect colored people
most likely be free.

1785
01:44:02,195 --> 01:44:03,446
And when that's so,
it's simple truth...

1786
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:05,532
...that your
brother's bravery...

1787
01:44:05,657 --> 01:44:07,492
...and his death
helped make it so.

1788
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,412
Only you can decide whether...

1789
01:44:10,495 --> 01:44:12,080
...that's sense enough
for you or not.

1790
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:17,460
My deepest sympathies
to your family.

1791
01:44:30,265 --> 01:44:32,851
We've managed our members
to a fare-thee-well.

1792
01:44:34,018 --> 01:44:35,186
You've had no defections...

1793
01:44:35,311 --> 01:44:37,272
...from the Republican right
to trouble you.

1794
01:44:38,523 --> 01:44:40,275
Whereas as to
what you promised...

1795
01:44:41,317 --> 01:44:43,361
...where the hell are
the commissioners?

1796
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,698
Oh, my God. It's true.

1797
01:44:48,366 --> 01:44:50,869
You...
You lied to me.

1798
01:44:50,994 --> 01:44:54,456
Mr. Lincoln, you evaded
my request for a denial...

1799
01:44:54,539 --> 01:44:56,541
...that there is
a Confederate peace offer,

1800
01:44:56,666 --> 01:44:58,960
...because there is one!

1801
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:02,964
We are absolutely guaranteed
to lose the whole thing.

1802
01:45:03,047 --> 01:45:06,217
We don't need a goddamn
abolition amendment!

1803
01:45:06,468 --> 01:45:08,219
Leave the Constitution alone!

1804
01:45:08,678 --> 01:45:09,721
What if
the peace commissioners

1805
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:11,222
appear today, or worse--

1806
01:45:14,726 --> 01:45:16,895
I can't listen
to this anymore.

1807
01:45:19,063 --> 01:45:22,066
I can't accomplish
a goddamn thing...

1808
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:24,652
...of any human meaning
or worth...

1809
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:28,490
...until we cure ourselves
of slavery...

1810
01:45:28,573 --> 01:45:31,326
...and end this
pestilential war!

1811
01:45:32,577 --> 01:45:35,246
And whether any of you
or anyone else knows it,

1812
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:37,248
...I know I need this!

1813
01:45:38,041 --> 01:45:40,710
This amendment is that cure!

1814
01:45:44,047 --> 01:45:47,050
We are stepped out upon
the world stage now!

1815
01:45:47,133 --> 01:45:48,426
Now!

1816
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:51,721
With the fate of human dignity
in our hands!

1817
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:56,434
Blood's been spilt to
afford us this moment!

1818
01:45:56,518 --> 01:45:58,770
Now! Now! Now!

1819
01:45:59,521 --> 01:46:02,524
And you grousle and heckle
and dodge about like...

1820
01:46:02,607 --> 01:46:04,567
...like pettifogging
Tammany Hall hucksters!

1821
01:46:05,777 --> 01:46:07,445
See what is before you.

1822
01:46:08,404 --> 01:46:11,199
See the here and now,
that's the...

1823
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:14,369
...hardest thing,
the only thing that accounts.

1824
01:46:16,287 --> 01:46:20,416
Abolishing slavery
by constitutional provision...

1825
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:24,254
...settles the fate
for all coming time...

1826
01:46:25,547 --> 01:46:28,550
...not only of the millions
now in bondage...

1827
01:46:30,635 --> 01:46:33,596
...but of unborn
millions to come.

1828
01:46:35,139 --> 01:46:39,394
Two votes stand in its way.
These votes must be procured.

1829
01:46:43,773 --> 01:46:48,403
We need two yeses,
three abstentions, or...

1830
01:46:48,486 --> 01:46:49,821
...four yeses...

1831
01:46:49,946 --> 01:46:53,408
...and one more abstention,
and the amendment will pass.

1832
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:55,034
You got a night, and a day,
and a night,

1833
01:46:55,159 --> 01:46:56,494
...and several
perfectly good hours.

1834
01:46:56,578 --> 01:46:58,580
Now get the hell out of here
and get 'em.

1835
01:46:59,247 --> 01:47:00,748
Yes. But how?

1836
01:47:03,126 --> 01:47:04,460
Buzzards' guts, man.

1837
01:47:07,005 --> 01:47:11,467
I am the President of the
United States of America...

1838
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:14,345
...clothed in immense power.

1839
01:47:16,848 --> 01:47:19,183
You will procure me
these votes.

1840
01:48:28,461 --> 01:48:31,255
We welcome you,
ladies and gentlemen...

1841
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:35,593
...first in the history of
this people's chamber...

1842
01:48:37,095 --> 01:48:38,429
...to your House.

1843
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:04,789
Mr. Ashley,
the floor is yours.

1844
01:49:13,339 --> 01:49:15,299
On the matter of the
joint resolution before us,

1845
01:49:15,425 --> 01:49:16,509
...presenting
a 13th Amendment...

1846
01:49:16,634 --> 01:49:18,845
...to our National
Constitution...

1847
01:49:18,970 --> 01:49:21,222
...which was passed last year
by the Senate...

1848
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:22,724
...and which has
been debated now...

1849
01:49:22,807 --> 01:49:25,351
by this estimable body
for the past several weeks...

1850
01:49:26,436 --> 01:49:27,645
...today we will vote.

1851
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:35,069
By mutual agreement,

1852
01:49:35,153 --> 01:49:37,822
...we shall hear brief,
final statements...

1853
01:49:38,990 --> 01:49:40,408
...beginning with...

1854
01:49:40,491 --> 01:49:42,785
...the honorable
George Pendleton of Ohio.

1855
01:49:49,125 --> 01:49:50,460
I have just received...

1856
01:49:52,378 --> 01:49:53,504
...confirmation...

1857
01:49:54,172 --> 01:49:56,549
...of what previously has
been merely rumored.

1858
01:49:56,674 --> 01:49:59,218
Affidavits from
loyal citizens...

1859
01:49:59,343 --> 01:50:00,845
...recently returned
from Richmond.

1860
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:03,890
They testify that
commissioners have indeed...

1861
01:50:04,015 --> 01:50:05,141
...come north and
ought to have arrived...

1862
01:50:05,224 --> 01:50:07,101
...by now
in Washington City...

1863
01:50:07,185 --> 01:50:10,480
...bearing an offer
of immediate cessation...

1864
01:50:10,563 --> 01:50:12,023
...of our civil war.

1865
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:15,651
Is it true, sir?

1866
01:50:15,735 --> 01:50:17,737
Are there Confederate
commissioners in the capital?

1867
01:50:17,862 --> 01:50:19,864
I have no idea where they are
or if they've arrived.

1868
01:50:19,989 --> 01:50:21,032
They'll arrive.

1869
01:50:21,157 --> 01:50:23,075
I appeal to
my fellow Democrats,

1870
01:50:23,201 --> 01:50:25,328
...to all Republican
representatives...

1871
01:50:25,411 --> 01:50:26,871
...who give a fig for peace,

1872
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:29,290
...postpone this vote!

1873
01:50:29,373 --> 01:50:30,750
Until we have answers...

1874
01:50:30,875 --> 01:50:32,084
...from the President himself!

1875
01:50:32,210 --> 01:50:33,336
Postpone the vote!

1876
01:50:33,419 --> 01:50:36,130
Postpone the vote!

1877
01:50:36,214 --> 01:50:39,342
Postpone the vote!
Postpone the vote!

1878
01:50:39,425 --> 01:50:42,136
Postpone the vote!
Postpone the vote!

1879
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:43,763
Postpone the vote!

1880
01:50:43,846 --> 01:50:45,223
Postpone the vote!

1881
01:50:45,306 --> 01:50:46,933
- Postpone the vote!
- Gentlemen!

1882
01:50:47,058 --> 01:50:48,434
Postpone the vote!

1883
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:51,729
Postpone the vote!
Postpone the vote!

1884
01:50:52,063 --> 01:50:54,565
Postpone the vote!
Postpone the vote!

1885
01:50:56,317 --> 01:50:58,694
I have made a motion!

1886
01:50:58,778 --> 01:51:01,322
Does anyone care to
second my motion?

1887
01:51:12,708 --> 01:51:13,876
Gentlemen.

1888
01:51:15,086 --> 01:51:16,671
The conservative faction...

1889
01:51:16,754 --> 01:51:18,840
...of border and
western Republicans...

1890
01:51:18,923 --> 01:51:21,133
...cannot approve
this amendment,

1891
01:51:21,259 --> 01:51:23,302
...about which we
harbor grave doubts...

1892
01:51:24,095 --> 01:51:27,932
...if a peace offer is being
held hostage to its success.

1893
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:30,476
Joining together with
our Democratic colleagues,

1894
01:51:30,601 --> 01:51:31,978
...I second the motion...

1895
01:51:32,103 --> 01:51:33,187
...to postpone.

1896
01:51:33,271 --> 01:51:35,147
He must deny peace
commissioners are in the city.

1897
01:51:35,273 --> 01:51:36,524
Quick, man. Quick.

1898
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:29,118
This is precisely what
Mr. Wood wishes me...

1899
01:52:29,201 --> 01:52:30,494
...to respond to?

1900
01:52:31,829 --> 01:52:33,539
Word for word,
this is precisely...

1901
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:35,499
...the assurance that
he demands of me?

1902
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,251
Yes, sir.

1903
01:52:57,063 --> 01:52:58,564
Give this to Mr. Ashley.

1904
01:53:02,068 --> 01:53:05,780
Uh, I feel I have to say,
Mr. Lincoln, that...

1905
01:53:06,906 --> 01:53:08,699
Could you please
just step outside?

1906
01:53:08,783 --> 01:53:09,784
You want a chat now,

1907
01:53:09,867 --> 01:53:11,202
...with the whole of the
House of Representatives...

1908
01:53:11,285 --> 01:53:12,536
...waiting on this?

1909
01:53:12,912 --> 01:53:15,289
Making false representation
to Congress, is--

1910
01:53:15,957 --> 01:53:17,541
- It's...
- It's impeachable,

1911
01:53:17,625 --> 01:53:20,336
but I've made no such
false representation.

1912
01:53:20,753 --> 01:53:22,004
But there are.

1913
01:53:22,713 --> 01:53:24,048
There is a delegation
from Richmond.

1914
01:53:24,799 --> 01:53:26,133
Give me the note, Johnnie.

1915
01:53:29,887 --> 01:53:31,722
Please, deliver that
to Mr. Ashley.

1916
01:53:50,992 --> 01:53:52,201
From the President.

1917
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:54,286
"So far as I know,
there are no...

1918
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:55,788
...peace commissioners
in the city...

1919
01:53:55,871 --> 01:53:57,206
...nor are there
likely to be."

1920
01:53:58,499 --> 01:54:00,167
"So far as I know"?

1921
01:54:01,502 --> 01:54:02,586
That means nothing.

1922
01:54:04,088 --> 01:54:07,091
Are there commissioners from
the South, or aren't there?

1923
01:54:08,467 --> 01:54:09,927
The President has
answered you, sir.

1924
01:54:10,011 --> 01:54:11,303
Your peace offer is a fiction.

1925
01:54:11,762 --> 01:54:12,930
That is not a denial.

1926
01:54:13,639 --> 01:54:15,182
It is a lawyer's dodge!

1927
01:54:16,642 --> 01:54:18,769
Mr. Haddam, is your
faction satisfied?

1928
01:54:21,605 --> 01:54:24,150
The conservative Republican
faction is satisfied.

1929
01:54:24,233 --> 01:54:25,735
And we thank Mr. Lincoln.

1930
01:54:26,986 --> 01:54:28,988
I move to table
Mr. Wood's motion.

1931
01:54:29,530 --> 01:54:30,573
Tabled!

1932
01:54:34,035 --> 01:54:36,662
Mr. Colfax, I order
the main question.

1933
01:54:37,329 --> 01:54:39,165
A motion has been made
to bring the bill...

1934
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:41,542
...for the 13th Amendment
to a vote.

1935
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:42,626
Do I hear a second?

1936
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:43,961
I second the motion.

1937
01:54:44,045 --> 01:54:46,297
So moved, so ordered.

1938
01:54:46,797 --> 01:54:47,923
The Clerk will now--

1939
01:54:48,007 --> 01:54:49,175
Quiet, please!

1940
01:54:50,801 --> 01:54:53,095
The Clerk will now
call the roll for the voting.

1941
01:54:59,226 --> 01:55:00,686
We begin with Connecticut.

1942
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:02,396
Mr. Augustus Benjamin,

1943
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,857
...on the matter of this
amendment, how say you?

1944
01:55:05,316 --> 01:55:06,358
Nay!

1945
01:55:07,985 --> 01:55:09,487
Mr. Arthur Bentleigh.

1946
01:55:09,945 --> 01:55:11,864
Nay!

1947
01:55:15,242 --> 01:55:17,578
Mr. John Ellis, how say you?

1948
01:55:17,995 --> 01:55:19,038
Aye!

1949
01:55:19,121 --> 01:55:20,122
What!

1950
01:55:26,837 --> 01:55:29,840
Missouri next.
Mr. Walter Apple ton.

1951
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,093
I vote no.

1952
01:55:33,761 --> 01:55:35,012
Mr. Josiah Burton.

1953
01:55:36,555 --> 01:55:40,309
Beanpole Burton is
pleased to vote yea!

1954
01:55:42,436 --> 01:55:44,063
The State of New Jersey.

1955
01:55:44,146 --> 01:55:46,315
- Mr. Nehemiah Cleary.
- No!

1956
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:50,277
Mr. James Martinson.

1957
01:55:50,945 --> 01:55:52,988
Mr. Martinson has
delegated me...

1958
01:55:53,364 --> 01:55:55,116
...to say he is indisposed.

1959
01:55:55,991 --> 01:55:57,326
And he abstains.

1960
01:55:59,745 --> 01:56:01,247
Mr. Austin J. Roberts.

1961
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:03,666
Also indisposed,
also abstaining.

1962
01:56:08,838 --> 01:56:10,131
Illinois concluded.

1963
01:56:12,341 --> 01:56:14,510
Mr. Harold Hollister.
How say you?

1964
01:56:15,219 --> 01:56:16,262
No.

1965
01:56:17,221 --> 01:56:18,514
Mr. Hutton.

1966
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:22,017
Mr. William Hutton.
Cast your vote.

1967
01:56:24,353 --> 01:56:26,939
William Hutton,
remembering at this moment...

1968
01:56:27,022 --> 01:56:28,899
...his beloved
brother Frederick...

1969
01:56:28,983 --> 01:56:31,318
...votes against
the amendment.

1970
01:56:43,664 --> 01:56:44,790
Webster Allen votes no.

1971
01:56:48,127 --> 01:56:49,295
Webster Allen,

1972
01:56:49,378 --> 01:56:51,881
...Illinois, Democrat...

1973
01:56:51,964 --> 01:56:53,966
...votes, no.

1974
01:56:55,634 --> 01:56:59,513

1977
01:57:09,356 --> 01:57:12,484
Ambrose Baylor, yes.

1978
01:57:13,944 --> 01:57:16,614
Mr. Walter H. Washburn.

1979
01:57:17,448 --> 01:57:18,616
Votes no.

1980
01:57:22,328 --> 01:57:25,164
And Mr. George Yeaman,
how say you?

1981
01:57:37,176 --> 01:57:38,719
My vote ties us.

1982
01:57:42,848 --> 01:57:44,183
Sir, Mr. Yeaman,

1983
01:57:44,266 --> 01:57:45,976
I didn't hear your vote.

1984
01:57:46,518 --> 01:57:49,355
I said "Aye", Mr. McPherson!

1985
01:57:50,481 --> 01:57:51,565
Aye!

1986
01:57:51,649 --> 01:57:52,650
Traitor!

1987
01:57:52,733 --> 01:57:53,859
Order!

1988
01:58:06,997 --> 01:58:08,958
Order in my chamber!

1989
01:58:15,339 --> 01:58:18,175
Mr. McPherson,
you may proceed.

1990
01:58:21,553 --> 01:58:23,973
Mr. Clay R. Hawkins of Ohio.

1991
01:58:34,191 --> 01:58:35,776
Goddamn it, I'm voting yes.

1992
01:58:37,194 --> 01:58:38,821
I don't care,
you shoot me dead!

1993
01:58:38,904 --> 01:58:41,365
You shoot me dead!
I am voting yes!

1994
01:58:42,866 --> 01:58:44,201
Mr. Edwin F. LeClerk.

1995
01:58:45,077 --> 01:58:46,078
No!

1996
01:58:48,664 --> 01:58:51,875
Oh, to hell with it.
Shoot me dead, too! Yes!

1997
01:58:55,212 --> 01:58:56,463
I mean...

1998
01:58:56,922 --> 01:58:59,383
...abstention. Abstention!

1999
01:59:03,721 --> 01:59:06,390
Spineless!

01:59:11,687 --> 01:59:13,105

2002
01:59:21,113 --> 01:59:22,197
...yes.

2003
01:59:27,119 --> 01:59:28,245
Yea.

2004
01:59:29,788 --> 01:59:31,332
James Brooks...

2005
01:59:32,333 --> 01:59:33,584
...nay.

2006
01:59:34,752 --> 01:59:36,211
Josiah Grenelle...

2007
01:59:37,463 --> 01:59:38,714
...yea.

2008
01:59:39,590 --> 01:59:41,258

02:00:20,964 --> 02:00:22,674
The roll call concludes.

2020
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:25,302
The voting is completed. Now--

2021
02:00:25,469 --> 02:00:28,222
Mr. Clerk,
please call my name.

2022
02:00:29,306 --> 02:00:30,557
I want to cast a vote.

2023
02:00:30,641 --> 02:00:31,892
I object.

2024
02:00:32,810 --> 02:00:34,353
The Speaker doesn't vote.

2025
02:00:34,645 --> 02:00:36,772
The Speaker may vote
if he so chooses.

2026
02:00:36,855 --> 02:00:39,233
It is highly unusual, sir.

2027
02:00:39,316 --> 02:00:40,776
This isn't usual,
Mr. Pendleton.

2028
02:00:40,859 --> 02:00:42,111
This is history.

2029
02:00:44,488 --> 02:00:46,949
How does
Mr. Schuyler Colfax vote?

2030
02:00:51,787 --> 02:00:53,247
Aye, of course.

2031
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:17,771
The final vote...

2032
02:01:19,606 --> 02:01:21,650
...eight absent
or not voting...

2033
02:01:23,527 --> 02:01:25,362
...fifty-six votes against...

2034
02:01:26,613 --> 02:01:28,866
...one hundred and
nineteen votes for.

2035
02:01:29,867 --> 02:01:31,618
With a margin of two votes--

2036
02:02:20,667 --> 02:02:22,544
We chose great leadership.

2037
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:38,435
<i>We'll rally
round the flag, boys</i>

2038
02:02:38,519 --> 02:02:40,270
<i>We'll rally once again</i>

2039
02:02:40,354 --> 02:02:43,690
<i>Shouting the battle cry
of freedom</i>

2040
02:02:43,774 --> 02:02:46,235
<i>We will rally
from the hillside</i>

2041
02:02:46,318 --> 02:02:48,278
<i>We'll gather from the plain</i>

2042
02:02:48,362 --> 02:02:51,949
<i>Shouting the battle cry
of freedom</i>

2043
02:02:52,324 --> 02:02:56,537
<i>The Union forever!
Hurrah, boys, hurrah!</i>

2044
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:58,580
<i>Down with the traitor</i>

2045
02:02:58,664 --> 02:03:00,374
<i>And up with the star</i>

2046
02:03:00,457 --> 02:03:04,378
<i>Shout, shout
the battle cry of Freedom!</i>

2047
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:06,296
Congratulations, Mr. Chairman.

2048
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:08,465
The bill, Mr. McPherson.
May I...?

2049
02:03:10,968 --> 02:03:14,471
<i>The Union forever!
Hurrah, boys, hurrah!</i>

2050
02:03:14,805 --> 02:03:17,307
That's, that's
the official bill.

2051
02:03:17,432 --> 02:03:19,476
I'll return it in the morning.

2052
02:03:20,018 --> 02:03:21,478
Creased...

2053
02:03:22,312 --> 02:03:23,313
...but unharmed.

2054
02:03:23,397 --> 02:03:27,067
<i>Shouting the battle cry
of freedom</i>

2055
02:03:27,150 --> 02:03:31,446
<i>We are springing to the call
Of the loyal, true and brave</i>

2056
02:03:33,156 --> 02:03:35,075
<i>Shouting the battle cry
of freedom</i>

2057
02:03:35,158 --> 02:03:37,327
<i>And we'll fill
our vacant ranks</i>

2058
02:03:37,452 --> 02:03:39,371
<i>With a million freemen more</i>

2059
02:03:40,205 --> 02:03:43,125
<i>Shouting the battle cry
of freedom</i>

2060
02:03:44,167 --> 02:03:45,669
<i>The Union forever!</i>

2061
02:03:46,503 --> 02:03:48,005
<i>Hurrah, boys, hurrah!</i>

2062
02:03:48,630 --> 02:03:52,009
<i>Down with the traitor
And up with the star</i>

2063
02:04:13,989 --> 02:04:16,116
A gift for you.

2064
02:04:20,454 --> 02:04:22,539
The greatest measure
of the 19th century,

2065
02:04:22,623 --> 02:04:23,707
...passed by corruption...

2066
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:27,044
...aided and abetted by
the purest man in America.

2067
02:04:45,687 --> 02:04:47,606
I wish you had been present.

2068
02:04:48,398 --> 02:04:50,484
- I wish I'd been.
- It was a spectacle.

2069
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:53,820
You can't bring your
housekeeper to the House.

2070
02:04:53,904 --> 02:04:55,906
I won't give them gossip.

2071
02:04:55,989 --> 02:04:57,532
This is enough.

2072
02:04:57,908 --> 02:04:59,034
This is...

2073
02:05:00,702 --> 02:05:02,537
...it's more than
enough for now.

2074
02:05:04,081 --> 02:05:05,832
Read it to me again, my love.

2075
02:05:07,834 --> 02:05:09,670
- "Proposed--"
- And adopted.

2076
02:05:09,753 --> 02:05:11,129
"Adopted...

2077
02:05:11,797 --> 02:05:12,923
...an amendment to...

2078
02:05:13,006 --> 02:05:15,967
...the Constitution of
the United States.

2079
02:05:16,051 --> 02:05:17,469
Section One.

2080
02:05:17,886 --> 02:05:21,682
Neither slavery nor
involuntary servitude...

2081
02:05:21,765 --> 02:05:24,559
...except as
a punishment for crime...

2082
02:05:24,643 --> 02:05:28,105
...whereof the party shall
have been duly convicted...

2083
02:05:28,647 --> 02:05:31,483
...shall exist within
the United States...

2084
02:05:31,983 --> 02:05:35,445
...or any place subject
to their jurisdiction."

2085
02:05:35,529 --> 02:05:36,988
Section Two.

2086
02:05:37,489 --> 02:05:41,660
"Congress shall have power
to enforce this amendment...

2087
02:05:41,743 --> 02:05:43,704
...by appropriate
legislation."

2088
02:06:05,767 --> 02:06:06,977
Let me be blunt.

2089
02:06:07,811 --> 02:06:09,521
Will the Southern states...

2090
02:06:09,604 --> 02:06:12,149
...resume their former
position in the Union...

2091
02:06:12,232 --> 02:06:13,734
...speedily enough
to enable us...

2092
02:06:13,817 --> 02:06:16,361
...to block ratification
to this here...

2093
02:06:16,445 --> 02:06:17,612
...13th Amendment?

2094
02:06:22,242 --> 02:06:23,785
I'd like peace immediately.

2095
02:06:24,745 --> 02:06:26,163
Yes, and...?

2096
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:31,626
I'd like your states
restored to...

2097
02:06:31,710 --> 02:06:35,297
...their practical relations
with the Union immediately.

2098
02:06:38,049 --> 02:06:40,135
If this could be
given me in writing...

2099
02:06:40,677 --> 02:06:42,596
...as Vice President
of the Confederacy,

2100
02:06:42,679 --> 02:06:44,055
I'd bring that document...

2101
02:06:44,139 --> 02:06:45,974
...with celerity,
to Jefferson Davis.

2102
02:06:48,643 --> 02:06:49,728
Surrender.

2103
02:06:50,228 --> 02:06:52,564
And we can
discuss reconstruction.

2104
02:06:54,399 --> 02:06:55,984
Surrender won't be thought of.

2105
02:06:56,777 --> 02:06:59,946
Unless you've assured us,
in writing...

2106
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:02,741
...we'll be readmitted in time
to block this amendment.

2107
02:07:03,325 --> 02:07:06,536
This is the arrogant demand
of a conqueror.

2108
02:07:07,078 --> 02:07:09,956
You'll not be a
conquered people, Mr. Hunter.

2109
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:11,500
You will be citizens.

2110
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:14,252
Returned to the laws and
the guarantees of rights...

2111
02:07:14,336 --> 02:07:15,587
...of the Constitution.

2112
02:07:16,254 --> 02:07:18,965
Which now extinguishes
slavery.

2113
02:07:19,049 --> 02:07:21,802
And with it, our economy.

2114
02:07:22,135 --> 02:07:23,428
All our laws
will be determined by...

2115
02:07:23,512 --> 02:07:25,138
...a Congress of
vengeful Yankees.

2116
02:07:25,931 --> 02:07:28,475
All our rights will be subject
to a Supreme Court...

2117
02:07:29,184 --> 02:07:31,186
...benched by bloody
Republican radicals.

2118
02:07:31,853 --> 02:07:34,773
All our traditions
will be obliterated.

2119
02:07:35,732 --> 02:07:37,484
We won't know
ourselves anymore.

2120
02:07:39,569 --> 02:07:41,947
We ain't here to
discuss reconstruction.

2121
02:07:42,072 --> 02:07:44,407
We have no legal basis
for that discussion.

2122
02:07:44,491 --> 02:07:46,117
But I don't want
to deal falsely.

2123
02:07:46,243 --> 02:07:48,745
The Northern states
will ratify, most of them.

2124
02:07:48,829 --> 02:07:50,664
As I figure it, it remains for
two of the Southern states...

2125
02:07:50,747 --> 02:07:51,790
...to do the same...

2126
02:07:51,873 --> 02:07:53,542
...even after
all are readmitted.

2127
02:07:53,625 --> 02:07:55,335
And I been working on that.

2128
02:07:56,169 --> 02:07:57,420
Tennessee and Louisiana.

2129
02:07:57,671 --> 02:07:59,923
Arkansas, too, most likely.
It'll be ratified.

2130
02:08:00,590 --> 02:08:03,343
Slavery, sir...
It's done.

2131
02:08:16,815 --> 02:08:19,609
If we submit ourselves
to law, Alex...

2132
02:08:20,318 --> 02:08:22,320
...even submit to
losing freedoms...

2133
02:08:23,780 --> 02:08:25,949
...the freedom to oppress,
for instance...

2134
02:08:27,075 --> 02:08:28,952
...we may discover
other freedoms...

2135
02:08:29,035 --> 02:08:30,495
...previously unknown to us.

2136
02:08:31,538 --> 02:08:35,083
Had you kept faith
with the democratic process,

2137
02:08:35,166 --> 02:08:36,626
...as frustrating
as that can be--

2138
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:37,961
Come, sir.

2139
02:08:38,128 --> 02:08:40,630
Spare us, at least,
these pieties.

2140
02:08:41,548 --> 02:08:43,133
Did you defeat us
with ballots?

2141
02:08:44,634 --> 02:08:46,469
How have you held
your Union together?

2142
02:08:47,470 --> 02:08:48,638
Through democracy?

2143
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:51,641
How many hundreds
of thousands have died...

2144
02:08:51,725 --> 02:08:53,143
...during your administration?

2145
02:08:54,561 --> 02:08:57,188
Your Union, sir, is bonded
in cannon fire and death.

2146
02:09:01,026 --> 02:09:02,444
It may be you're right.

2147
02:09:06,823 --> 02:09:09,659
But say all we done
is show the world...

2148
02:09:09,743 --> 02:09:11,912
...that democracy isn't chaos.

2149
02:09:14,581 --> 02:09:18,043
That there is a great,
invisible strength...

2150
02:09:18,168 --> 02:09:19,502
...in a people's union.

2151
02:09:20,420 --> 02:09:24,299
Say we've shown that a people
can endure awful sacrifice...

2152
02:09:24,382 --> 02:09:26,051
...and yet cohere.

2153
02:09:26,676 --> 02:09:27,844
Mightn't that save at least...

2154
02:09:27,928 --> 02:09:30,180
...the idea of democracy
to aspire to?

2155
02:09:31,681 --> 02:09:33,975
Eventually to
become worthy of?

2156
02:09:38,104 --> 02:09:40,023
At all rates,
whatever may be proven...

2157
02:09:40,106 --> 02:09:42,359
...by blood and sacrifice...

2158
02:09:42,442 --> 02:09:44,027
must have been proved by now.

2159
02:09:54,371 --> 02:09:56,498
Shall we stop this bleeding?

2160
02:11:35,138 --> 02:11:36,097
Once he surrenders,

2161
02:11:36,181 --> 02:11:37,974
...send his boys back
to their homes...

2162
02:11:38,808 --> 02:11:40,477
...and their farms,
their shops.

2163
02:11:42,353 --> 02:11:43,480
Yes, sir.

2164
02:11:44,814 --> 02:11:45,815
As we discussed.

2165
02:11:45,940 --> 02:11:48,151
Liberality all around,
not punishment.

2166
02:11:48,234 --> 02:11:49,486
I don't want that.

2167
02:11:50,153 --> 02:11:53,031
And their leaders,
Jeff and the rest of them...

2168
02:11:53,156 --> 02:11:54,407
...they escape,
leave the country...

2169
02:11:54,491 --> 02:11:56,993
...while my back's turned,
that wouldn't upset me none.

2170
02:11:58,328 --> 02:12:01,039
When peace comes,
it mustn't just be hangings.

2171
02:12:07,504 --> 02:12:09,089
By outward appearance...

2172
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:13,635
...you're ten years older
than you were a year ago.

2173
02:12:16,971 --> 02:12:19,182
Some weariness
has bit at my bones.

2174
02:12:32,695 --> 02:12:34,948
I never seen
the like of it before,

2175
02:12:35,031 --> 02:12:36,533
...what I seen today.

2176
02:12:38,159 --> 02:12:39,994
Never seen
the like of it before.

2177
02:12:42,705 --> 02:12:44,207
You always knew that.

2178
02:12:45,667 --> 02:12:47,210
What this was going to be.

2179
02:12:49,045 --> 02:12:51,131
Intimate and ugly.

2180
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:55,802
You must have
needed to see it close...

2181
02:12:55,885 --> 02:12:57,345
...when you decided to
come down here.

2182
02:13:16,531 --> 02:13:20,201
We've made it possible for one
another to do terrible things.

2183
02:13:22,579 --> 02:13:24,164
We've won the war.

2184
02:13:25,165 --> 02:13:28,501
Now you have to
lead us out of it.

2185
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:02,178
You have an itch to travel?

2186
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:05,181
I'd like that.

2187
02:15:05,848 --> 02:15:08,101
To the West, by rail.

2188
02:15:08,184 --> 02:15:09,852
Overseas.

2189
02:15:11,688 --> 02:15:12,897
The Holy Land.

2190
02:15:15,858 --> 02:15:17,527
Awfully pious for a man...

2191
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:20,154
...who takes his wife out
buggy-riding on Good Friday.

2192
02:15:20,863 --> 02:15:22,031
Jerusalem.

2193
02:15:22,657 --> 02:15:24,492
Where David and
Solomon walked.

2194
02:15:24,826 --> 02:15:28,288
I dream of walking
in that ancient city.

2195
02:15:34,544 --> 02:15:36,296
All anyone
will remember of me...

2196
02:15:36,379 --> 02:15:39,048
...is I was crazy and
I ruined your happiness.

2197
02:15:39,799 --> 02:15:42,635
Anyone thinks that
doesn't understand, Molly.

2198
02:15:46,222 --> 02:15:47,724
When they look at you...

2199
02:15:49,225 --> 02:15:51,978
...at what it cost to live
at the heart of this...

2200
02:15:53,479 --> 02:15:55,732
...they'll wonder at it.
They'll wonder at you.

2201
02:15:55,815 --> 02:15:56,983
They should.

2202
02:15:58,318 --> 02:15:59,485
But they should
also look at...

2203
02:15:59,569 --> 02:16:01,154
...the wretched woman
by your side...

2204
02:16:01,237 --> 02:16:04,073
...if they want to understand
what this was truly like.

2205
02:16:05,199 --> 02:16:06,701
For the ordinary person.

2206
02:16:07,744 --> 02:16:09,329
For anyone other than you.

2207
02:16:09,495 --> 02:16:11,247
You must try to be happier.

2208
02:16:12,206 --> 02:16:13,750
We must, both of us.

2209
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:16,502
We've both been
so miserable for so long.

2210
02:16:26,137 --> 02:16:28,931
I did say some colored men--

2211
02:16:29,015 --> 02:16:31,476
The intelligent,
the educated, and the...

2212
02:16:31,601 --> 02:16:33,519
...veterans. I qualified it.

2213
02:16:33,603 --> 02:16:35,104
Mr. Stevens is furious.

2214
02:16:35,188 --> 02:16:36,898
He wants to know
why you qualified it.

2215
02:16:36,981 --> 02:16:39,233
No one heard the
intelligent or educated part.

2216
02:16:39,317 --> 02:16:41,361
All they heard
was the first time...

2217
02:16:41,444 --> 02:16:44,155
...any president has ever
made mention...

2218
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:45,615
...of Negro voting.

2219
02:16:45,948 --> 02:16:49,744
Still, I wish I'd mentioned
it in a better speech.

2220
02:16:49,827 --> 02:16:51,579
Mr. Stevens
also wants to know...

2221
02:16:51,662 --> 02:16:53,498
...why you didn't make
a better speech.

2222
02:16:56,292 --> 02:16:58,044
Mrs. Lincoln is
waiting in the carriage.

2223
02:16:58,127 --> 02:16:59,962
She wants me to remind you
of the hour, and that...

2224
02:17:00,129 --> 02:17:01,255
...you'll have to pick up...

2225
02:17:01,339 --> 02:17:02,965
...Miss Harris and
Major Rathbone.

2226
02:17:06,511 --> 02:17:08,346
- Am I in trouble?
- No, sir.

2227
02:17:08,846 --> 02:17:10,223
Thank you, Mr. Slade.

2228
02:17:25,822 --> 02:17:27,281
I suppose it's time to go.

2229
02:17:28,866 --> 02:17:30,493
Though I would rather stay.

2230
02:19:00,333 --> 02:19:02,752
The President has been shot!

2231
02:19:05,671 --> 02:19:06,756
The President...

2232
02:19:06,881 --> 02:19:09,759
...has been shot!
At Ford's Theater!

2233
02:19:15,765 --> 02:19:17,600
No. No!

2234
02:19:51,634 --> 02:19:54,971
It's 7:22 in the morning...

2235
02:19:55,972 --> 02:19:57,640
...Saturday,
the 15th of April.

2236
02:19:57,765 --> 02:19:59,016
It's all over.

2237
02:19:59,141 --> 02:20:00,518
The President is no more.

2238
02:20:04,313 --> 02:20:06,274
Now he belongs to the ages.

2239
02:20:12,613 --> 02:20:14,323
<i>Fondly do we hope...</i>

2240
02:20:15,825 --> 02:20:17,910
<i>...fervently do we pray...</i>

2241
02:20:19,453 --> 02:20:22,373
<i>...that this mighty
scourge of war,</i>

2242
02:20:22,498 --> 02:20:24,458
<i>...may speedily pass away.</i>

2243
02:20:27,503 --> 02:20:30,047
Yet if God wills
that it continue...

2244
02:20:30,673 --> 02:20:33,009
...until all
the wealth piled...

2245
02:20:33,134 --> 02:20:36,220
...by the bondman's
two hundred and fifty years...

2246
02:20:36,345 --> 02:20:39,348
...of unrequited toil
shall be sunk...

2247
02:20:40,683 --> 02:20:44,770
...and until every drop of
blood drawn with the lash...

2248
02:20:44,854 --> 02:20:48,524
...shall be paid by another
drawn with the sword...

2249
02:20:49,859 --> 02:20:52,194
...as was said
three thousand years ago,

2250
02:20:52,320 --> 02:20:54,530
...so still it must be said,

2251
02:20:55,364 --> 02:20:57,199
"The judgments of the Lord...

2252
02:20:58,159 --> 02:21:02,538
...are true and righteous
altogether."

2253
02:21:08,210 --> 02:21:09,920
With malice toward none...

2254
02:21:12,173 --> 02:21:14,216
...with charity for all...

2255
02:21:15,885 --> 02:21:17,553
...with firmness in the right,

2256
02:21:17,678 --> 02:21:19,930
...as God gives us
to see the right...

2257
02:21:20,056 --> 02:21:23,225
...let us strive on to finish
the work we are in...

2258
02:21:23,934 --> 02:21:26,270
...to bind up the
nation's wounds...

2259
02:21:27,188 --> 02:21:28,606
...to care...

2260
02:21:28,939 --> 02:21:31,275
...for him who shall have
borne the battle...

2261
02:21:32,568 --> 02:21:34,487
...and for his widow...

2262
02:21:35,112 --> 02:21:36,405
...and his orphan...

2263
02:21:38,115 --> 02:21:42,286
...to do all which may
achieve and cherish...

2264
02:21:43,454 --> 02:21:48,084
...a just and lasting peace
among ourselves...

2265
02:21:49,502 --> 02:21:51,587
...and with all nations.
