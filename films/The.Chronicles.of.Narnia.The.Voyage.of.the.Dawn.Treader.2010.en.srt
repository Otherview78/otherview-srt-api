1
00:00:16,966 --> 00:01:27,272
Synched almost by R20. Most of the subs are good and cleared of 
this can do the job for you. Enjoy!!

2
00:01:27,273 --> 00:01:30,521
Are you sure you're eighteen?
- Why? Do I look older?

3
00:01:40,036 --> 00:01:44,155
Alberta Scrubb?
- It's a typographical error

4
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,496
- It is suppose to be Albert A. Scrubb.
- Edmund, you are suppose to be helping
me with the groceries.

5
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:56,207
Better luck next time, ay, squirt?

6
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:05,952
Squirt? He barely had 2 years on me!

7
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:07,154
I am a king. I've fought wars
and I've led armies.

8
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,924
Not in this world.
- Yeah, instead i'm stuck here.

9
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:17,740
Doing battles with useless Clarence Scrubb.

10
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:20,974
If anyone so deserve the name.

11
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,730
What are you doing?

12
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:29,007
Nothing.
Come on then.

13
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:38,708
Dear Diary.
It is now day 253.

14
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:42,464
since my ratchet cousins
Edmund and Lucy invaded our house.

15
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:45,489
Not sure how much long i can cope
living with them.

16
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:47,575
Hard to share my things.

17
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:51,122
If only one could treat relatives like
one who treat insects,

18
00:02:51,122 --> 00:02:55,712
all my problems would be solved.
I could simply put them in a jar.

19
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,259
Pin them to my wall?
- I'm home!

20
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:02,806
- Hello?
- Note to self.

21
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:07,083
Investigate legal ramifications
of impaling relatives.

22
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:13,551
And that concludes the war news from the western front.
- Hi, Uncle Harold.

23
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:16,784
I've tried to find some carrots
but all they had were turnips again.

24
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:20,749
Should I start making soup?
And Alberta is on her way home.

25
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:26,799
Uncle Harold?
- Father.

26
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:31,180
Edward making faces at you.

27
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,788
Why, you little...
- Father, he's going to hit me.

28
00:03:33,788 --> 00:03:37,857
Edmund look, it's from Susan.

29
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:40,152
I do wish you were here with us.
It is such an adventure.

30
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:45,055
But nothing like our times in Narnia.
America is very exciting.

31
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:49,749
Only we never see father.
He works so very hard.

32
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:53,400
I was invited to the British consul's
tea party this week by a naval officer.

33
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,573
Who happens to be very handsome.
I think he fancies me.

34
00:03:57,573 --> 00:04:01,850
It seems that the Germans have made the
crossing difficult right now.

35
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,814
Time are hard. Mother hopes you both won't mind

36
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,483
another few months in Cambridge.

37
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:11,134
Another few months?
How will we survive?

38
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:15,724
You're lucky. At least you've got your own room.
I'm stuck with mullet mouth.

39
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,167
Susan and Peter are the lucky ones.

40
00:04:19,063 --> 00:04:23,653
Off on adventures.
- Yeah. They are the olders we are the youngest.

41
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:25,843
We don't matter as much.

42
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:29,807
Do you think i look anything like Susan?

43
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:38,048
Lucy, have you seen this ship before?
- Yes, it's very Narnian looking isn't it?

44
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:42,847
Yeah. Just another reminder that we're here
not there.

45
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:46,603
There once was two orphans who wasted their time.

46
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:48,898
believing in Narnian nursery rhyme.

47
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:49,523
Please let me hit him!
- No.

48
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,401
Don't you ever knock?
- It's my house.

49
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:54,322
I do as I please. You're just guests.

50
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:59,538
What's so fascinating about that picture anyway?
It's hideous.

51
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:02,250
You won't see it from the outside of the door.

52
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:05,276
Edmund look, looks like the water is actually moving.

53
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:11,430
What rubbish, see? That's what happens when you
read all those fancy little novels and fairy tales of yours.

54
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,873
There once was a boy called Eustace, who read books
for facts which were worthless.

55
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:20,715
People who read fairy tales are always a sort of becoming
a hideous burden compared to people like me.

56
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:24,679
I read books with real information.
- A hideous burden?

57
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:27,913
I haven't seen you lift a finger
since we've been here.

58
00:05:29,686 --> 00:05:33,129
I hope you won't mind I tell your father it was you
who stole Aunt Alberta sweets?

59
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:34,589
- Liar?
- Really?

60
00:05:34,485 --> 00:05:36,467
- Edmund, the painting!
- I found them under your bed.

61
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:39,805
And you know what? I've licked every one of them!

62
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:41,787
Ew! I'm infected with you!

63
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,341
What is going on here?
- Lucy, do you think...

64
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:52,949
This is some kind of a trick. Stop or I'll tell mother.

65
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:55,870
Mother!

66
00:05:57,956 --> 00:05:59,521
I'll just smash the whole thing.

67
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:04,841
Do something!
- No.

68
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:07,658
Help me.
- Let me go.

69
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:10,892
Let go.

70
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:48,864
Eustace, swim!
- What's going on?

71
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:53,349
Swimming!

72
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:56,166
Swim.

73
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:06,494
It's alright! I got you.

74
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:09,727
Caspian?
- Lucy.

75
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:13,900
Edmund, it is Caspian.
- You're safe now.

76
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,821
Are we in Narnia?
- Yes, you are in Narnia.

77
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:22,350
I don't wanna go. I want to go back to England!
I'm going back to England!

78
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:25,584
Hold on.

79
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:46,343
That was thrilling!

80
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:49,890
How in the world do you end up here?
- I have no idea.

81
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:53,124
- Caspian!
- Edmund.

82
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,253
It's great to see you.
- Didn't you call for us?

83
00:07:57,192 --> 00:08:00,322
No, not this time.

84
00:08:00,322 --> 00:08:02,617
Well, whatever the case, i'm just glad to be here.

85
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:09,293
Ahh! Get that thing off me!

86
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:14,405
Reepicheep!

87
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:17,639
Your Majesty.
- Hello, Reep.

88
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,664
What a pleasure.
- The pleasure is all mine sir.

89
00:08:20,664 --> 00:08:24,941
But first, what to do about this,
this hysterical interloper?

90
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,071
That giant rat thing just tried to claw my
face off!

91
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:32,556
I was merely trying to expel the water from
your lungs sir.

92
00:08:33,495 --> 00:08:36,207
He talks! Does anyone understand? He just talk!
- He always talks.

93
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:39,128
Actually its getting him to shut up that's the trick.

94
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:42,675
The moment there is nothing to be said your highness,
I promise you I will not say it.

95
00:08:42,675 --> 00:08:46,952
I don't know what kind of prank this is.
I wanna wake up right now!

96
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:49,039
Perhaps we can throw him back?

97
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,254
And being abducted by a kind
of zeepiratencarnival.

98
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:58,531
I demand to know just where in the blazes am I?

99
00:08:58,427 --> 00:09:02,496
You're on the Dawn Treader.
The finest ship in Narnia's navy.

100
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:10,111
Was it something I said?

101
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:13,136
See to him for me.
- Your majesty.

102
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:19,082
Men.

103
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:22,733
Behold our castaways.

104
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:26,280
Edmund the Just
and Lucy the Valiant.

105
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:30,036
High King and Queen of Narnia.

106
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,270
Aslan.

107
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,615
Look! Susan's bow and arrows.

108
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:18,022
- Lucy
- My Healing Cordial and dagger.

109
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:20,526
oh, May I?
- Of course. They are yours.

110
00:10:20,526 --> 00:10:23,134
Peter's sword.
- Yes.

111
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:26,055
I looked after as promised.

112
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:30,540
Here.
Hold it if you wish.

113
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:33,878
No, it's yours.
Peter has given it to you.

114
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:38,156
I did saved this for you though.

115
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,354
Thanks.

116
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:49,005
Since you've left, the Giants in the North
had surrendered unconditionally.

117
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:51,404
And we defeated the Calormen army of the
great desert.

118
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:55,472
There is peace across all of Narnia.
- Peace?

119
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:57,141
For three years.

120
00:10:57,141 --> 00:11:01,001
And have you found yourself a queen in those
three years?

121
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:03,296
No. Not one to compare to your sister.

122
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:07,782
Hang on, so there are no wars to fight
and no one is in trouble...

123
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:10,599
Then, why are we here?
- That's a good question.

124
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,955
I have been asking myself the same thing.

125
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:16,545
So, where are we sailing?
- To get back the throne from my uncle.

126
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:20,404
He tried to kill my father's closest friends and
most loyal supporters.

127
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,847
The seven Lords of Telmar.

128
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,585
They fled to the Lone Islands.

129
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:33,131
No one has heard from them since.

130
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:38,243
So you think something has happened to them?
- Well, if it has...

131
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:40,747
It is my duty to find out.

132
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:43,876
What lies east of the Lone Islands?

133
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:49,092
Uncharted waters. Things that
you can barely imagine.

134
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:52,535
Tales of sea serpents and worse.

135
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:59,524
Sea serpents?
- Alright captain, enough of your tall tales.

136
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:14,754
Where skies i want to be, where the waves are sweet.

137
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:20,179
Descends upon you, Reepicheep.

138
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:28,524
That's pretty!
- oh! Thank you.

139
00:12:28,524 --> 00:12:32,697
A "driad" sung to me when i was just a "materling".

140
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:37,183
I can't divine the meaning but i never forgotten
the words.

141
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:38,435
What do you think past Lone islands is?

142
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:42,503
I've been told the furthest east one can sail
is to the end of the world.

143
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:46,571
Aslan's country.
- Do you really believe there is such a place?

144
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:50,744
We have nothing if we do not believe.

145
00:12:52,622 --> 00:12:55,334
Do you think you can actually sail there?

146
00:12:55,334 --> 00:12:57,421
Well, there is only one way of finding that out.

147
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:01,385
Only hope one day I'd earn the right to see it.

148
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,244
Your majesty.

149
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:05,228
You have grown stronger, my friend.

150
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:06,688
Seems I have.

151
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:11,174
Alright! Back to work.

152
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:24,944
Edmund, Do you think if we keep sailing
to the end of the world, we just...

153
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:25,987
tip off the edge?

154
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:29,116
Don't worry, Lu.
We're long way from there.

155
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:30,786
I see you're still talking nonsense.

156
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:37,253
Are you feeling better?
- Yes, but not thanks to you.

157
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:41,739
It's like I have an iron constitution.
- You're ever "vesitence" ever I see. (?)

158
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:43,825
Found your sea legs?
- Never lost them.

159
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:45,286
It's just given a shock of things. (?)

160
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:49,250
Obviously have the cutest position, (?)
due to my intelligence.

161
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,858
I don't think he has "apute" anything (?)

162
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,153
I'll have you know as soon as
I find civilization.

163
00:14:54,153 --> 00:14:57,491
I'm contacting the British Consulate.
Having you arrested for kidnapping.

164
00:14:57,491 --> 00:15:01,872
Kidnapping is it? That's funny.
I thought we had saved your life.

165
00:15:01,872 --> 00:15:03,959
You held me here against my own will!
- Did I?

166
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:09,279
(???) in that quarters
It's like a zoo down there!

167
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,513
He's quite the complainer, isn't he?
- He is just warming up.

168
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:14,808
Landfall.

169
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:41,096
The Lone Islands.
Narrow Haven's portal.

170
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:43,600
Strange. No Narnia flag in sight.

171
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:47,460
The Lone Islands
always been of Narnia's.

172
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,363
Seems suspicious.

173
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:56,118
I say we prepare a party

174
00:15:57,996 --> 00:16:00,499
Drinian?
- Forgive me, Your Majesty...

175
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:05,089
But the chain of command starts with Prince Caspian
on this ship

176
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,158
Right
- We use rowboats. Drinian, pick some men and come
on shore.

177
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:17,086
Men the row boats! Throw the sailer and prepare to
go out.

178
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:21,154
and get ready to lower the anchor.

179
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,863
En route! (??) lies ahead.

180
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:38,263
Can't we just wait till the morning?

181
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:42,435
There is no honor in turning away from adventure land.

182
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:46,086
Listen!
Where is everyone?

183
00:16:46,086 --> 00:16:50,572
Come on, jelly legs.
- I'm capable of getting out myself!

184
00:16:53,284 --> 00:16:56,101
And you're certain you're related by blood?

185
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:22,807
Reepicheep, stay here with Drinian's men
and secure the place.

186
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:23,850
We will head up.

187
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,310
If we don't come back by dawn,

188
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:28,231
send the party.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

189
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:47,843
Yeah, looks like nobody is in.
So do you think we should go back?

190
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:52,955
Do you want to come here and guard...something?

191
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:56,293
Ah, yes.
Good idea, cousin.

192
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:59,422
Very..um, logical.

193
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:13,610
I've got it.
Don't worry.

194
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:33,221
I'm ready to go when you are!

195
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:49,078
Who are all these people?
- Why are they've been crossed out?

196
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:54,920
Looks like some kind of fee..?
- Slave Traders.

197
00:18:58,362 --> 00:18:59,614
Look out.

198
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:19,852
Unless you want to hear this scum squeal like
a girl again,

199
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:23,294
I would say, you should drop your weapons.

200
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:25,589
I'm not a girl.
- Now!

201
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:29,449
Put it down!
- Useless..

202
00:19:29,449 --> 00:19:35,395
Put them in irons.
- Come here you!

203
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:36,230
Get your hands off me. Let go!

204
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,611
Take these two to the market.
Send those other two to the dungeons.

205
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:43,949
Listen to me, you insolent fool.
I am your king!

206
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:48,331
You're gonna pay for that!
- Actually...

207
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:52,086
someone else is going to pay.

208
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:55,111
For all of you.

209
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:15,036
You all right?
- Yeah.

210
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:22,964
It is hopeless.
You'll never get out.

211
00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:27,346
Who's there?
- Nobody.

212
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:29,641
Just a voice in my head.

213
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,350
Lord Bern?

214
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:51,235
That was me once.
I do not deserve that title anymore.

215
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:53,530
Is he one of the seven?

216
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:06,361
Your face. You remind me of
a king that I once know.

217
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:10,012
That man was my father.

218
00:21:10,012 --> 00:21:13,559
My Lord, please forgive me.

219
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,332
No, please.

220
00:21:18,462 --> 00:21:21,383
No!

221
00:21:31,397 --> 00:21:34,944
- Mommy!
Get back.

222
00:21:36,926 --> 00:21:40,995
Stay with daddy.
- Don't worry. I will find you!

223
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:42,455
Mommy!

224
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,477
Where are they taking them?
- Keep watching.

225
00:22:26,477 --> 00:22:28,355
What happened?
- It's a sacrifice.

226
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:34,719
Where did they go?
- No one knows.

227
00:22:34,823 --> 00:22:38,683
The mist was first seen in the east.

228
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:42,647
Reports of fishermen and sailors
disappearing out at sea.

229
00:22:43,168 --> 00:22:44,942
We lords have made a pact...

230
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:47,967
to find the source of the mist
and to destroy them.

231
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,845
They each set sail,

232
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:52,661
But none of them came back.

233
00:22:57,147 --> 00:23:00,381
You see, If they don't sell you to the slave
traders

234
00:23:00,694 --> 00:23:05,075
You're likely to be fed to the mist
- We have to find Lucy.

235
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:08,726
Before it's too late.
- I offer 60.

236
00:23:08,726 --> 00:23:10,395
I bid 80!
- 100 for the little lady.

237
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:14,047
120!
- 150.

238
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:17,489
Anymore bids?

239
00:23:18,845 --> 00:23:21,036
SOLD!

240
00:23:22,392 --> 00:23:23,435
Come on, move!

241
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,694
And now, for this fine speciment!

242
00:23:29,694 --> 00:23:31,676
Who'd kick off the bidding?

243
00:23:32,198 --> 00:23:37,205
Come on now, he may not seem like much,
but uh..he is strong.

244
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,169
Yes, he's strong alright. Smells like
the rear end of a Minotaur.

245
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,464
That is an outrageous lie.

246
00:23:43,986 --> 00:23:46,594
I won the school hygeine award,
two years running!

247
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:51,810
Come on, someone make your bid!
- I'll take them off your hands.

248
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:56,504
I'll take them all out of your hands.

249
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:58,486
For Narnia!

250
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:22,062
Thanks, Reep. I knew you would come.
- Your Highness.

251
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,868
Grab the keys.

252
00:24:38,232 --> 00:24:40,422
Keys!

253
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:20,689
oh, you're a boat in a magical land.
Can't you row yourself?

254
00:25:40,092 --> 00:25:42,805
I hope that wasn't British consul.

255
00:25:43,535 --> 00:25:45,621
Your majesty!
- Wait.

256
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:49,690
My wife was taken just this morning.
- Daddy!

257
00:25:49,794 --> 00:25:51,985
I beg you, take me with you.

258
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:53,967
I want to come.
- No, Gael. Stay with your aunt.

259
00:25:55,427 --> 00:25:59,391
I am a fight sailor, been on the seas
my whole life.

260
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,208
Of course, you must.
- Thank you.

261
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:06,172
But Daddy!
- If I ever not come back...

262
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:08,050
Now be good.

263
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,543
My king!

264
00:26:20,568 --> 00:26:25,784
This was given to me by your father.
I hid it safely in the cave.

265
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,079
All these years.
- I thought that is Narnian sword?

266
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,895
It's from your Golden Age.
There are seven of those swords.

267
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:35,798
Gifts from Aslan to protect Narnia.

268
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:38,406
Your father entrusted them to us.

269
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:40,075
Here. Take it.

270
00:26:44,457 --> 00:26:45,917
And it may protect you.

271
00:26:56,453 --> 00:27:00,730
Thank you, my Lord.
And we shall find your lost sisters(?).

272
00:27:02,712 --> 00:27:03,860
Edmund.

273
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,619
Dear diary.
There has been extraordinary turn of event.

274
00:27:25,454 --> 00:27:28,688
I have been abducted by my cousins and set
to drift in uncharted waters.

275
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,044
In some ridiculously looking boat.

276
00:27:30,878 --> 00:27:36,929
What's worse, as I share quarters with obnoxious
mouse thing,

277
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:38,807
My thought banking with my cousins was bad enough.

278
00:27:39,015 --> 00:27:41,623
So far, every person I met in this strange place
suffers

279
00:27:41,623 --> 00:27:43,918
from the most florit delusions

280
00:27:43,918 --> 00:27:48,300
Chasing for green mists and looking for lost lords.

281
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:52,994
I can only assume this is the result of poor diet.

282
00:27:52,994 --> 00:27:53,933
Everyone are barking mad.

283
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:59,983
Cousin Edmund is no exception.

284
00:27:59,983 --> 00:28:02,696
He spends every spare second rubbing that thin sword.

285
00:28:02,696 --> 00:28:06,973
Like it's some magic lantern.
Poor fool clearly needs a hobby.

286
00:28:06,973 --> 00:28:09,476
It is going to be magnificient.
Do they come in a smaller size?

287
00:28:11,145 --> 00:28:15,527
Peeving Marmud (?)
He's more delusional than my cousin.

288
00:28:17,091 --> 00:28:21,056
In England we have mousetraps
and that sort of things.

289
00:28:24,394 --> 00:28:27,002
Speaking of food, do you think I can get any
do you?

290
00:28:28,462 --> 00:28:30,444
Uh, why you talking to that bird?

291
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:37,329
I just naturally assumed that...
- (Laughs) He's talking to birds.

292
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:39,729
He is as mad as a looner that one.

293
00:28:42,232 --> 00:28:44,006
Shoo! Go go.

294
00:29:07,373 --> 00:29:12,380
Are you aware sir...
Stealing rations is a capital offense?

295
00:29:14,884 --> 00:29:16,449
Up here.

296
00:29:16,657 --> 00:29:20,934
You.
- Men have been killed for less.

297
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:24,690
For What?
- Treason and sneakiness...and general nuisances.

298
00:29:24,794 --> 00:29:27,715
Just hand over the orange and we'll let the matter pass.

299
00:29:28,237 --> 00:29:32,096
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Allow me to...

300
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:35,330
I've had quite enough of you.
- Unhand the tail.

301
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:38,147
The Great Aslan himself gave me this tail.

302
00:29:38,147 --> 00:29:41,798
No one. Repeat. No one touches the tail.

303
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:45,658
Period. Exclamation mark!
- Sorry.

304
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:50,456
Now. I will have the orange, then I will have satisfaction.

305
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,230
Puh, puh, please, please, please, um. I'm a pacifist.

306
00:29:58,906 --> 00:30:00,680
Watch it.
- Sorry.

307
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:06,939
Are you trying to run away?
We're on a boat you know.

308
00:30:08,191 --> 00:30:09,234
Can't we just discuss this?

309
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:14,971
That is for stealing, that is for lying,
and that was for good measure.

310
00:30:16,953 --> 00:30:21,335
(Laughs) That's the spirit! We have ourselves
a duel! Catch.

311
00:30:22,274 --> 00:30:25,194
Now, come on.
Take your best shot.

312
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:28,115
Is that it?
Come on, boy.

313
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,436
Stop flapping your wings like
a drunken pelican.

314
00:30:34,896 --> 00:30:38,756
Hoist!
Keep your leg up.

315
00:30:45,954 --> 00:30:49,188
Yoo-hoo! Over here.

316
00:30:49,605 --> 00:30:51,378
On your foot.
On your left, your right.

317
00:30:51,378 --> 00:30:56,073
Got it? Come on.
The Nimble. It is a dance, boy.

318
00:30:56,907 --> 00:31:01,602
Come on now. And again.

319
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:04,210
Oh, no.

320
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,911
And that!

321
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:22,361
Look.

322
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:26,325
Gael, what are you doing here?

323
00:31:45,415 --> 00:31:48,232
It seems that we
have an extra crew member.

324
00:31:55,743 --> 00:31:59,394
Welcome aboard.
- Your majesty.

325
00:31:59,498 --> 00:32:01,585
Call me Lucy.
Come on.

326
00:32:01,585 --> 00:32:03,254
Come on, look lovely, back to work!

327
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:11,808
Good match!
I will make a swordsman of you yet.

328
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:17,337
Yes, well...it's the plane we look more even

329
00:32:17,337 --> 00:32:18,484
it would be an entirely different result.

330
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:21,509
(Laughs) Indeed.

331
00:32:34,028 --> 00:32:35,279
It looks like uninhabited.

332
00:32:37,262 --> 00:32:38,618
If the Lords follow the mist to the east,
they would have stopped here.

333
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,434
It could be a trap.

334
00:32:41,747 --> 00:32:46,546
Or it can held some answers.
- Caspian?

335
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,657
We spend the night on shore.
Scout the island everyone.

336
00:32:51,657 --> 00:32:52,596
Ay, Your Majesty.

337
00:33:13,564 --> 00:33:15,546
Seems they have brought a pig.

338
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:22,014
This one. It's female.

339
00:33:22,953 --> 00:33:25,039
So is this one.

340
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:30,464
This one reads.

341
00:33:31,298 --> 00:33:33,698
Let's take her.

342
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:12,922
There is no escape!
- We are scary.

343
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:16,468
What are you?
- We are terrifying invisible beasts.

344
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:20,745
If you could see us, you would be really
intimidated.

345
00:34:20,745 --> 00:34:22,519
You forgot to mention that we all are
very large.

346
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,900
What do you want?
- You'll do what we ask.

347
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:32,325
She will!
- Very clear. Well put!

348
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,577
Or what?
- Or death.

349
00:34:33,577 --> 00:34:38,897
Death.

350
00:34:39,105 --> 00:34:41,713
Well, I won't be much use to you when
I'm dead now, would I?

351
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:46,512
I haven't thought of that.
- No, you hadn't. Fair point.

352
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:50,267
Alright. Then we'll just kill your friends!

353
00:34:52,145 --> 00:34:56,318
Good idea.
- What do you want with me?

354
00:34:56,422 --> 00:35:01,951
You'll enter the house of the Opressor.

355
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:04,663
What house?
- This one.

356
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:13,948
Upstairs, you'll find the book of incantation

357
00:35:13,948 --> 00:35:17,390
recite the spell that makes the unseen, seen.

358
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:22,711
Well put chief, well put.
- Very. Yeah.

359
00:35:23,545 --> 00:35:25,318
Well, go on.
We haven't got all day.

360
00:35:25,527 --> 00:35:28,552
Remember what will happen to your friends

361
00:35:28,552 --> 00:35:30,743
You've been warned.
- Yeah.

362
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,725
Right.

363
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,671
Why don't you do it yourself?
- We can't read.

364
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:42,009
Can't write for the matter of fact.

365
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:45,348
All that.
- Yeah.

366
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,581
Why didn't you just say so?

367
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:52,024
Beware of the opressor.
- He is very aggressive!

368
00:35:52,546 --> 00:35:59,639
What makes the unseen, seen.
Got it? Don't forget that!

369
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:15,183
Ed, wake up.

370
00:36:15,183 --> 00:36:19,251
Wake up!
Look.

371
00:36:25,093 --> 00:36:30,100
Where's Lucy?
Lucy!

372
00:36:30,204 --> 00:36:32,395
Everybody up!
- Get up.

373
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:40,323
This way.
- Move!

374
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,972
The Book of Incantation

375
00:37:34,256 --> 00:37:35,821
MAXIM TO HEAL Pain

376
00:37:37,803 --> 00:37:40,202
A MAXIM TO FORGET

377
00:37:43,123 --> 00:37:49,591
With these words, Your tongue must sew.
For all around there to be snow.

378
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:44,775
An infallible spell to make you she,
the beauty you've always wanted to be.

379
00:38:55,311 --> 00:39:00,214
Susan, what's going on?

380
00:39:05,535 --> 00:39:08,143
I'm beautiful.

381
00:39:18,366 --> 00:39:20,974
No! wait.

382
00:39:22,956 --> 00:39:24,416
Make me she, whom i'd agree.

383
00:39:36,934 --> 00:39:41,107
Aslan?

384
00:39:55,816 --> 00:39:59,050
A spell to make the unseen, seen.

385
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:05,831
If the 'p' in psychology,
the 'h' in psychiatry...

386
00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:08,960
invisible ink and the truth
in theology.

387
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,047
Caspian, Lucy's dagger.

388
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:19,079
Stop right there or there is!

389
00:40:23,982 --> 00:40:27,842
The spell is complete.

390
00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:30,450
Now all is visible.

391
00:40:51,626 --> 00:40:54,443
What sort of creatures are you?
- Great ones.

392
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:59,450
With the head of a tiger and
the body of um-different tiger.

393
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,475
You don't want to mess with us!
- Or what?

394
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:06,022
Or I'll claw you to death!

395
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,882
I'll run my touch right through you!

396
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:14,889
I will crush you with my teeth.
- And i'll bite you with my fangs.

397
00:41:15,828 --> 00:41:18,645
You mean squash us
with your fat bellies?

398
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:23,131
Fatty bellies?
- Or tickle us with your toes?

399
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:26,469
What have you done with my sister, you little pip squid?

400
00:41:29,077 --> 00:41:30,120
Now, calm down.
- Where is she?

401
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,519
Can I tell him?
- Tell him, chief.

402
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:35,440
In the mansion.
- What mansion?

403
00:41:44,203 --> 00:41:46,706
Oh. That mansion.

404
00:41:46,706 --> 00:41:49,836
Now, I'm getting tired of you leaving me behind.

405
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:52,757
The thing came back.

406
00:41:53,696 --> 00:41:56,408
This place is weirder and weirder.

407
00:41:56,408 --> 00:41:58,077
He's calling us weird.

408
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:09,969
- Lucy! Your majesty.
- Caspian and Edmund.

409
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:11,639
This is Coriakin.
It's his island.

410
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:16,124
That's what he thinks.
You have wronged us, magician.

411
00:42:16,124 --> 00:42:20,088
I have not wronged you, I've made you
invisible for your own protection.

412
00:42:20,088 --> 00:42:23,218
Protection?
- That's aggressive! Opressor!

413
00:42:23,218 --> 00:42:26,765
I have not opressed you.
- But you could have!

414
00:42:26,765 --> 00:42:31,042
If you wanted to!
- Be gone.

415
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:37,197
What was that?
- Loot(?). But don't tell them.

416
00:42:41,161 --> 00:42:43,456
What were those things?
- Dufflepuds.

417
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,107
Of course.
Silly me.

418
00:42:47,837 --> 00:42:52,949
What did you mean when you said you made them
invisible for their own good?

419
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:55,035
It seems to be the easiest way
to protect them.

420
00:42:55,244 --> 00:42:58,582
From the evil.
- You mean the mist?

421
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:03,380
I mean what lies behind the mist.

422
00:43:21,636 --> 00:43:23,305
It's quite beautiful.

423
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:34,780
I mean for a made belived that and
a made believed world.

424
00:43:34,885 --> 00:43:36,867
There is the source of your problems.

425
00:43:38,431 --> 00:43:44,586
The Dark Island.
A place where evil lurks.

426
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:50,845
It can take any form. It can make your
darkest dream come true.

427
00:43:52,202 --> 00:43:56,061
It seeks to corrupt all goodness

428
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:59,608
Steal the lights from this world.

429
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,738
How do we stop it?
- You must break its spell.

430
00:44:04,094 --> 00:44:07,849
That sword you carry, there
are six others.

431
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:10,144
Have you seen them?
- Yes.

432
00:44:10,144 --> 00:44:13,274
The six lords, they passed through here?
- Indeed.

433
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,134
Where are they heading?
- Where I've sent them.

434
00:44:20,263 --> 00:44:24,957
Break the spell.
You must follow the Blue Star...

435
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:28,817
to Ramandu's Island.

436
00:44:29,756 --> 00:44:32,260
There the seven swords must be laid
at Aslan's table.

437
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,641
Only then can the truly magical power
be released.

438
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:44,152
But beware. You will
all about to be tested.

439
00:44:44,152 --> 00:45:47,786
Tested?

440
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:58,965
It will do everything in it's power
to tempt you.

441
00:45:04,181 --> 00:45:05,433
Be strong...

442
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:11,588
Don't fall to temptations.

443
00:45:11,692 --> 00:45:13,361
To defeat the darkness out there

444
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:19,412
you must defeat the darkness inside yourself.

445
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:49,768
For reasons beyond my comprehension

446
00:45:49,768 --> 00:45:52,481
We have taken the advice from the senile old coup(?).

447
00:45:52,481 --> 00:45:56,132
who doesn't possess a razor, and
walks around on a dressing gown.

448
00:45:57,279 --> 00:46:00,513
So we're back in the bathtub and
and lost in the tempest. Brilliant!

449
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:19,082
14 days of being tossed like a pancake,
not the slightest sight of land.

450
00:46:22,733 --> 00:46:27,010
The only consolation is that everyone is finally
as miserable as I am.

451
00:46:29,618 --> 00:46:32,435
Except for that show-off talking rat.

452
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:36,816
He is one of the annoying glass is always
half full part.

453
00:46:41,406 --> 00:46:44,535
So, we're stuck here...

454
00:46:44,848 --> 00:46:47,874
with half rations, we have
food and water for two more weeks maximum.

455
00:46:50,377 --> 00:47:56,098
This is your last chance to
turn back, your majesty.

456
00:46:57,158 --> 00:46:59,140
Not in this storm.

457
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:03,626
Needle in a haystack trying to find this
remoteless place.

458
00:47:03,626 --> 00:47:05,608
We can sail way past and knocked to the end
of world.

459
00:47:06,547 --> 00:47:08,946
We can be eaten by a sea serpent.

460
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:11,763
You'll see when the men are getting nervous.

461
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:16,457
These are strange seas we are sailing

462
00:47:16,457 --> 00:47:18,439
the lights that which i've never seen before.

463
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:22,194
Then perhaps captain, you'd love to be the one
to explain to Mr. Rince that we're abandoning

464
00:47:22,194 --> 00:47:25,950
the search for his families?

465
00:47:27,515 --> 00:47:28,558
I'll get back to it.

466
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:34,087
Just a word of warning,

467
00:47:35,234 --> 00:47:38,677
the seas can play nasty tricks on a crew mind.

468
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,598
Very nasty.

469
00:48:13,623 --> 00:48:17,379
Transform my reflection, cast into affection

470
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,778
lashes, lips and complexion.

471
00:48:19,778 --> 00:48:25,411
Let me like whom I agree,
cause more beauty over me.

472
00:49:32,071 --> 00:49:35,409
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Ms. Pevensie.

473
00:49:41,147 --> 00:49:44,902
Edmund?
- You look beautiful, Sister.

474
00:49:44,902 --> 00:49:46,362
As always.
- Peter!

475
00:49:46,675 --> 00:49:49,596
Excuse me Miss,
Can I get a photo?

476
00:49:49,596 --> 00:49:53,560
Mother's gonne love this,
all her children in one picture.

477
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,524
Smile!
- Hang on. Where am I?

478
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:01,384
I mean where's Lucy?
- Lucy, who's Lucy?

479
00:50:02,323 --> 00:50:03,992
Susan, what's wrong?

480
00:50:03,992 --> 00:50:06,809
Come on now Miss.
A nice big smile!

481
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:09,730
Edmund, I'm not sure about this. I think
I want to go back.

482
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:13,068
Go back where?
- To Narnia!

483
00:50:13,068 --> 00:50:16,197
What is Narnia?
- What's going on?

484
00:50:16,197 --> 00:50:18,597
Stop this!

485
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:28,403
Lucy.
- Aslan?

486
00:50:32,784 --> 00:50:34,453
What have you done, child?

487
00:50:35,288 --> 00:50:40,817
I don't know,
but that was awful.

488
00:50:41,234 --> 00:50:43,320
But you chose it, Lucy.

489
00:50:43,529 --> 00:50:49,266
I didn't mean to choose all that. I just wanted
to be as beautiful like Susan.

490
00:50:50,101 --> 00:50:51,979
That's all.

491
00:50:52,605 --> 00:50:57,403
You wished yourself away,
and with it, much more.

492
00:50:57,403 --> 00:51:01,367
Your brothers and sisters wouldn't know Narnia
without you, Lucy.

493
00:51:01,785 --> 00:51:04,288
You discovered it first, remember?

494
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:07,418
I'm so sorry.

495
00:51:08,878 --> 00:51:15,033
You doubt your value,
don't run from who you are.

496
00:51:16,806 --> 00:51:18,580
Aslan!

497
00:52:09,592 --> 00:52:13,869
Father.

498
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:17,102
Edmund.

499
00:52:20,441 --> 00:52:23,049
Come with me.
Join me.

500
00:52:26,595 --> 00:52:29,099
Edmund?

501
00:52:31,185 --> 00:52:32,855
Lucy.

502
00:52:36,819 --> 00:52:41,930
I can't sleep.
- Let me guess. Bad dream?

503
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:50,171
So either we're all going mad,
or something is playing with our minds.

504
00:53:11,139 --> 00:53:15,521
I doubt the Lord stopped here,
there is no sign of anything living.

505
00:53:15,521 --> 00:53:18,963
Right. Well, once you have got on shore, take your men
for food and water.

506
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:24,075
The three of us will look for clues.
- You mean the four of us?

507
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:29,499
Come on, please don't send me back to the rat.
- I heard that!

508
00:53:32,212 --> 00:53:35,341
Big ears.
- I heard that too.

509
00:53:53,284 --> 00:53:55,683
Look. We
not the first on the island.

510
00:53:55,683 --> 00:53:58,083
The Lords?
- Could be.

511
00:54:03,299 --> 00:54:05,802
What do you think could be down there?

512
00:54:05,802 --> 00:54:09,245
Let's find out.

513
00:54:44,087 --> 00:54:49,616
What is that?
- I don't know. Looks like some kind of a gold statue.

514
00:55:20,807 --> 00:55:23,102
He must have fallen in.

515
00:55:23,728 --> 00:55:26,232
Poor man.
- You mean, poor Lord.

516
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:31,030
The crust of Lord rest in him.
- And his sword.

517
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,638
We need it.

518
00:55:34,369 --> 00:55:37,185
Be careful.

519
00:55:40,315 --> 00:55:45,948
Your sword hasn't turn to gold.
- Both swords are magical.

520
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:52,624
He mustn't have known what hit him.

521
00:55:52,624 --> 00:55:54,085
Maybe, or maybe
He was onto something.

522
00:55:58,049 --> 00:56:00,865
What are you talking about?

523
00:56:19,434 --> 00:56:20,999
What are you staring at?

524
00:56:22,772 --> 00:56:30,179
Whoever has access to this pool,
could be the most powerful person in the world.

525
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:36,438
Lucy, we'll be so rich

526
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:40,819
no one can tell us what to do, or who to
live with.

527
00:56:40,819 --> 00:56:42,801
You can't take anything out of Narnia, Edmund.

528
00:56:42,801 --> 00:56:48,330
Says who?
- I do.

529
00:56:54,172 --> 00:56:56,884
I am not your subject.

530
00:56:57,197 --> 00:57:01,579
You have been waiting for this, haven't you?
To challenge me. You doubt my leadership!

531
00:57:01,579 --> 00:57:02,726
You doubt yourself.

532
00:57:02,726 --> 00:57:04,500
You're a child.
- And you're a spineless sap.

533
00:57:04,604 --> 00:57:07,108
Edmund?
- I'm tired of playing second fiddle...

534
00:57:07,108 --> 00:57:09,716
First it was Peter, and now it's you.

535
00:57:09,716 --> 00:57:12,011
You know I am braver than both of you.

536
00:57:12,115 --> 00:57:16,183
Why did you Peter's sword?
I deserve a kingdom of my own!

537
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:20,982
I deserve to rule!
- If you think you're so brave...

538
00:57:20,982 --> 00:57:23,486
prove it!

539
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:27,867
No!
Stop it!

540
00:57:27,763 --> 00:57:32,353
Both of you.
Look at yourself.

541
00:57:32,353 --> 00:57:35,169
Can't you see what's happenning?

542
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:37,464
This place has tempted you.

543
00:57:37,464 --> 00:57:43,515
It is bewitching you,
This is exactly what Coriakin is talking about.

544
00:57:43,515 --> 00:57:47,166
Let's just get outta here.

545
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:15,228
Oh yes, follow the imaginary blue star,
to the island of Rabandoedoe...

546
00:58:15,228 --> 00:58:19,192
Like the seven steak knives
on the table of a talking lion.

547
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,738
Nonsense.

548
00:58:32,023 --> 00:58:35,570
What is that?

549
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,696
I must be dead.

550
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:19,696
You are definitely dead.

551
00:59:24,912 --> 00:59:27,624
You wouldn't be needing that one wont you.

552
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:47,132
Finally, a favorable turn
of events.

553
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:58,607
What foods did you found?

554
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:03,823
It is volcanic, My majesty.
Nothing grows.

555
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,953
Where is Eustace?

556
01:00:06,848 --> 01:00:11,230
I believe he's out not helping us loading
the boats.

557
01:00:12,064 --> 01:00:13,316
Eustace!

558
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:21,348
I have got a bad feeling.

559
01:00:20,305 --> 01:00:22,183
I'm going to find him.

560
01:00:22,183 --> 01:00:25,208
I'll come with you.

561
01:00:32,928 --> 01:00:37,518
Eustace?

562
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:46,385
Treasure.

563
01:00:46,593 --> 01:00:49,619
Trouble.

564
01:00:57,547 --> 01:01:00,676
Eustace's.

565
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:06,831
No.

566
01:01:14,447 --> 01:01:18,828
I'm sorry.
- He was just a boy.

567
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:22,896
I shouldn't have left him.

568
01:01:25,609 --> 01:01:28,217
What could have happened to him?

569
01:01:28,425 --> 01:01:31,868
In this place? Anything.

570
01:01:31,868 --> 01:01:34,997
And he wasn't the first.

571
01:01:37,188 --> 01:01:39,796
It's Lord Octesian.

572
01:01:41,465 --> 01:01:46,159
We should find this... sword.

573
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:09,005
What was that?

574
01:02:11,822 --> 01:02:14,638
Is it the volcano?

575
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:20,271
Oh no, that's not a volcano.
All hands on deck.

576
01:02:24,236 --> 01:02:28,095
Archers, arm yourselves!

577
01:02:45,308 --> 01:02:50,106
Take your positions
and wait for my command.

578
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:01,060
What is it doing?
- Fire!

579
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:07,736
He will break the mast.

580
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,186
Hold your positions.

581
01:03:18,481 --> 01:03:21,506
Fire!

582
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:51,967
Edmund!

583
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:59,791
Edmund!
- Lucy.

584
01:04:19,299 --> 01:04:23,889
I AM Eustace

585
01:04:25,036 --> 01:04:29,522
You've got to be joking!

586
01:04:37,763 --> 01:04:42,144
He must have been tempted by the treasure.

587
01:04:40,997 --> 01:04:43,709
Everyone knows that the dragon's treasure
is enchanted.

588
01:04:45,483 --> 01:04:48,091
Apart anyone from here.

589
01:05:02,174 --> 01:05:07,077
Is there any way to change him back?
- Not that I know of.

590
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:12,397
Aunt Alberta will not be pleased.

591
01:05:12,397 --> 01:05:17,195
Sorry about the hand, oh boy.
I can be a little over zealous sometimes.

592
01:05:17,195 --> 01:05:20,951
The boats are ready, sire.
- We can not leave him.

593
01:05:21,264 --> 01:05:23,767
Well, we can't bring him on board, Your Majesty.

594
01:05:24,706 --> 01:05:27,732
You and others take one boat back.
The rest of us stay here until morning.

595
01:05:27,836 --> 01:05:30,757
and work out what to do.
- But you have no provisions.

596
01:05:30,757 --> 01:05:33,573
And no means of staying warm, My Majesty

597
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,624
And you were saying?

598
01:05:48,074 --> 01:05:50,786
I've never seen these constellation before.

599
01:05:50,786 --> 01:05:53,915
Me neither.

600
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:57,149
We are long way from home.

601
01:05:57,149 --> 01:06:01,844
When I was a boy I used to imagine sailing
to the end of the world.

602
01:06:02,052 --> 01:06:05,599
To find my father there.

603
01:06:07,373 --> 01:06:10,189
Maybe you are.

604
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:26,567
I miss my mommy.

605
01:06:29,071 --> 01:06:31,679
I miss mine too.

606
01:06:31,574 --> 01:06:34,495
Don't worry, you'll see her again.

607
01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:38,877
How do you know?
- You just have to have faith about these things.

608
01:06:38,877 --> 01:06:42,424
Aslan will help us.

609
01:06:47,952 --> 01:06:51,186
But Aslan could have stop her from being taken.

610
01:06:51,186 --> 01:06:55,255
We'll find her, I promise.

611
01:06:55,255 --> 01:06:58,802
Somehow.

612
01:07:23,525 --> 01:07:25,820
Trouble sleeping?

613
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:32,601
Now now, all is not lost as it seems.

614
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,835
I'll stay up with you if you wish.
To keep you company.

615
01:07:37,399 --> 01:07:41,363
You didn't even believe in dragons this morning.

616
01:07:44,597 --> 01:07:49,918
You know, extraordinary things
only happen to extraordinary people.

617
01:07:52,213 --> 01:07:53,464
Maybe it's a sign!

618
01:07:54,299 --> 01:07:57,846
That you've got an extraordinary destiny

619
01:07:58,472 --> 01:08:03,479
Something greater than you could have imagine.

620
01:08:05,357 --> 01:08:10,886
I can tell you one or two of my adventures
if you like, just past the time.

621
01:08:10,403 --> 01:08:14,054
Believe it or not, you are not the
first dragon I've encountered.

622
01:08:14,054 --> 01:08:16,558
Many years ago,
too many that I care to imagine.

623
01:08:16,871 --> 01:08:20,209
I was with a band of pirates
and I met another dragon.

624
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:21,565
Much fierce than you.

625
01:08:34,396 --> 01:08:36,691
Lucy, wake up.

626
01:08:37,004 --> 01:08:39,925
Look.

627
01:08:39,925 --> 01:08:41,907
The Blue Star.

628
01:08:42,429 --> 01:08:45,871
Everybody up.
- What?

629
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,731
It is the blue star.
- Wake up.

630
01:09:28,329 --> 01:09:30,102
Pull.

631
01:09:28,955 --> 01:09:33,649
Put your strokes in there, lads!
Pull!

632
01:09:35,214 --> 01:09:36,987
The wind has left.

633
01:09:36,987 --> 01:09:40,430
So how do we get to Ramandu Island now then?

634
01:09:41,681 --> 01:09:43,872
My guess is something doesn't want us to get there.

635
01:09:45,437 --> 01:09:48,358
Pull.

636
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:53,887
If I'm getting hungrier,
I'm gonna eat that dragon!

637
01:09:54,617 --> 01:09:59,103
Don't worry, Eustace, they will
to deal with me first.

638
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:03,588
If we don't get to landfall by tonight,
they might as well eat them...

639
01:10:08,596 --> 01:10:10,786
What are we hitting?

640
01:10:13,916 --> 01:10:18,088
Eustace, that's brilliant!

641
01:10:24,139 --> 01:10:27,373
En route!

642
01:10:46,985 --> 01:10:51,679
We can't be sure that the other Lords even
made it to Ramandu's Island.

643
01:11:02,632 --> 01:11:09,309
You got us there! What did I tell you?
Eustace, you're extraordinary!

644
01:12:03,137 --> 01:12:05,954
Wait.

645
01:12:41,422 --> 01:12:43,404
Lord Revilian.

646
01:12:47,264 --> 01:12:50,393
Lord Mavramorn.

647
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:55,818
Lord Argoz.

648
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,041
He's breathing!

649
01:13:11,466 --> 01:13:13,761
So are they.

650
01:13:16,056 --> 01:13:18,664
They're under the spell.

651
01:13:19,602 --> 01:13:21,480
It's the food!

652
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:28,678
Hey, it's the stone knife.
This is Aslan's table!

653
01:13:28,887 --> 01:13:31,182
The swords.

654
01:13:38,132 --> 01:13:40,322
Let me take it.

655
01:13:48,981 --> 01:13:51,067
That's six.

656
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:55,031
We're missing one.

657
01:13:58,474 --> 01:14:00,560
Look!

658
01:14:26,222 --> 01:14:28,830
Travellers of Narnia

659
01:14:28,309 --> 01:14:30,812
Welcome.

660
01:14:31,438 --> 01:14:34,568
Arise!

661
01:14:36,133 --> 01:14:39,888
Do you look hungry?
- Who are you?

662
01:14:39,888 --> 01:14:41,557
I am Lilliandil.

663
01:14:41,974 --> 01:14:43,957
Daughter of Ramandu.

664
01:14:43,957 --> 01:14:46,356
I am your guide.

665
01:14:49,172 --> 01:14:52,615
You're a star.

666
01:14:58,352 --> 01:15:00,856
You're most beautiful.

667
01:15:00,856 --> 01:15:05,655
If it is a distraction for you, I can
change forms.
- No.

668
01:15:06,281 --> 01:15:09,515
Please.

669
01:15:09,827 --> 01:15:13,166
The food is for you.

670
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:17,025
There is enough for everyone
that welcome to Aslan's table.

671
01:15:17,234 --> 01:15:20,364
Always. Help yourselves.

672
01:15:21,407 --> 01:15:23,389
Wait.

673
01:15:22,972 --> 01:15:25,684
What happened to them?

674
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:29,544
These poor men were half mad
by the time they reached our shores.

675
01:15:29,752 --> 01:15:35,490
They threatened each other with violence.
Violence is forbidden at the table of Aslan.

676
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:39,663
So they were sent to sleep.
- Will they ever awake?

677
01:15:39,558 --> 01:15:42,270
When all is put right.

678
01:15:42,688 --> 01:15:45,504
Come. There is little time.

679
01:16:00,943 --> 01:16:05,533
The Magician Coriakin told you
of Dark Island?

680
01:16:05,742 --> 01:16:08,454
Yes.

681
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:15,652
For long the evil will be unstoppable.

682
01:16:15,861 --> 01:16:20,034
Coriakin said, to break the spell,
we need the seventh sword on the Aslan's table.

683
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:23,789
He speaks the truth.
- But we found only six.

684
01:16:23,998 --> 01:16:26,084
Do you know where the seventh is?

685
01:16:27,127 --> 01:16:28,588
In there.

686
01:16:28,588 --> 01:16:32,239
You will need great courage.

687
01:16:37,246 --> 01:16:41,210
Now, don't waste your time.

688
01:16:42,462 --> 01:16:45,592
How we meet again?

689
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:49,869
Goodbye.

690
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:17,513
So what do you think it's in there?

691
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:19,704
Our worst nightmares.

692
01:17:19,704 --> 01:17:22,729
Our darkest wishes.

693
01:17:22,625 --> 01:17:25,546
Pure evil.

694
01:17:28,154 --> 01:17:32,013
Tavros, unlock the armory

695
01:17:32,013 --> 01:17:35,978
Archers, prepare yourselves.

696
01:17:35,769 --> 01:17:38,377
Dock the lanterns.

697
01:17:38,377 --> 01:17:40,672
Let's get ready.

698
01:17:45,366 --> 01:17:49,956
When I grow up,
I want to be just like you.

699
01:17:56,841 --> 01:17:59,345
When you grow up,

700
01:18:00,701 --> 01:18:04,561
you should be just like you.

701
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:15,097
If case we don't get through,

702
01:18:15,097 --> 01:18:17,705
whatever this is...

703
01:18:17,705 --> 01:18:21,147
I want you to know I think of you as my brother.

704
01:18:20,313 --> 01:18:23,442
Me too.

705
01:18:26,885 --> 01:18:29,702
You gave up your sword.

706
01:18:29,702 --> 01:18:32,727
It was not mine to keep.

707
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:38,569
Use this.

708
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:42,220
But it is...
- Peter would like you to have it.

709
01:18:50,565 --> 01:18:55,260
Here it is, my friend.
The battle awaits.

710
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:59,641
Eustace, no. Wait.

711
01:18:59,537 --> 01:19:02,562
Stop.

712
01:19:03,396 --> 01:19:09,238
I will not accept surrender.
A true warrior does not flight out of fear.

713
01:19:09,447 --> 01:19:12,159
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

714
01:19:14,454 --> 01:19:19,044
I'm a mouse.
You a dragon.

715
01:19:19,461 --> 01:19:23,321
You have a skin of leather.
You breathe fire.

716
01:19:23,113 --> 01:19:25,929
Come on, let's meet our destiny.

717
01:19:32,918 --> 01:19:35,526
No matter what happens here.

718
01:19:35,422 --> 01:19:40,429
every soul standing before me, has earned a
place on the Dawn Treader.

719
01:19:41,473 --> 01:19:43,768
Together we traveled far.

720
01:19:44,081 --> 01:19:47,314
Together, we have faced diversity.
Together...

721
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:49,401
we can do it again.

722
01:19:49,714 --> 01:19:54,304
So now is not the time to fall in fears and
temptations. Be strong!

723
01:19:53,886 --> 01:19:56,077
Never give in.

724
01:19:56,286 --> 01:20:01,397
Our world, our Narnian lives
depend on it.

725
01:20:02,128 --> 01:20:05,153
Think of the lost souls
we are here to save.

726
01:20:08,074 --> 01:20:10,369
Think of Aslan.

727
01:20:11,099 --> 01:20:16,106
Think of Narnia.
- For Narnia!

728
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,966
For Narnia!

729
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:17,445
Helene?

730
01:21:27,043 --> 01:21:29,859
We can't see a thing.

731
01:21:29,859 --> 01:21:32,676
The fog is too thick.

732
01:21:38,413 --> 01:21:41,543
You're a great disappointment
to me.

733
01:21:41,543 --> 01:21:43,734
You call yourself my son?

734
01:21:43,734 --> 01:21:47,698
And act like a king.

735
01:21:49,054 --> 01:21:51,662
Edmund.

736
01:21:52,392 --> 01:21:54,478
Come with me.

737
01:21:54,687 --> 01:21:57,504
Be my king.

738
01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:01,885
I let you rule.
- Go away.

739
01:22:01,885 --> 01:22:05,849
You're dead.
- You can never kill me.

740
01:22:06,684 --> 01:22:10,856
I will always be alive
in your mind, silly boy.

741
01:22:10,856 --> 01:22:14,403
No!
- Edmund?

742
01:22:15,029 --> 01:22:18,159
Are you alright?

743
01:22:28,799 --> 01:22:32,555
Keep away!

744
01:22:33,076 --> 01:22:37,145
Keep away!
- Who's there?

745
01:22:37,145 --> 01:22:42,256
Will we not fear you!
- Not, are you?

746
01:22:50,393 --> 01:22:54,357
Keep away!
- We do not leave.

747
01:22:53,731 --> 01:22:56,131
You will not defeat me.

748
01:22:56,026 --> 01:23:00,303
Caspian, the sword!

749
01:23:01,034 --> 01:23:03,955
Lord Rhoop.

750
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:10,422
You cannot own me!
- Stand down.

751
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:13,239
Let's get him onboard, quickly!

752
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:26,383
Be calm my Lord.
- Off me, demons!

753
01:23:25,653 --> 01:23:29,304
We're not here to hurt you.
I am your king.

754
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:32,329
Caspian.

755
01:23:36,398 --> 01:23:39,840
My Lord.

756
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:44,117
You should not have come.
There is no way out of here.

757
01:23:43,908 --> 01:23:47,351
Quickly turn this ship about
before it is too late.

758
01:23:47,351 --> 01:23:49,229
We have the sword.
Let's go!

759
01:23:48,186 --> 01:23:52,254
Let's turn this ship around.

760
01:23:51,419 --> 01:23:53,401
Do not think.

761
01:23:54,445 --> 01:23:59,139
Do not let it know your fears,
or it will become them!

762
01:23:59,661 --> 01:24:03,207
Oh no.
- Edmund.

763
01:24:03,207 --> 01:24:06,963
What did you just think of?
- I'm sorry.

764
01:24:22,611 --> 01:24:25,114
What is that?

765
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:28,870
It's too late!

766
01:24:31,791 --> 01:24:35,233
Get on the boat

767
01:24:44,309 --> 01:24:46,500
Come, walk.

768
01:24:46,917 --> 01:24:51,090
Don't let me down.
No fear. No retreats.

769
01:25:00,478 --> 01:25:04,129
For Narnia! Take that.

770
01:25:04,964 --> 01:25:07,363
And that.

771
01:25:07,259 --> 01:25:09,658
Eustace, hang on!

772
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:41,788
I'll kill it.
- No, the sword!

773
01:25:41,058 --> 01:25:44,188
Eustace!

774
01:25:44,501 --> 01:25:48,360
Come back.
- We are doomed. Doomed!

775
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:52,324
Turn this ship about.
- Stop him.

776
01:25:59,209 --> 01:26:03,278
Rowers.
To your rowing position.

777
01:26:02,965 --> 01:26:08,285
Forward at double speed.
- Aslan, please help us.

778
01:26:14,857 --> 01:26:17,257
Pull.

779
01:26:38,016 --> 01:26:40,624
Pull!

780
01:26:47,509 --> 01:26:49,595
Where are you?

781
01:27:01,488 --> 01:27:05,243
You must stay here until someone comes and
get you!

782
01:27:11,293 --> 01:27:15,779
Ed! We run the serpent, smash him on the rocks.

783
01:27:15,153 --> 01:27:19,326
Stay on the port, I will keep it on the ground.

784
01:27:19,848 --> 01:27:22,768
Look out!

785
01:27:25,689 --> 01:27:27,880
Pull!

786
01:27:34,765 --> 01:27:38,938
Try to kill me, come on!
Come on here.

787
01:27:41,441 --> 01:27:44,780
No!
- Edmund.

788
01:28:01,784 --> 01:28:05,435
I'm still here.

789
01:28:10,859 --> 01:28:13,989
Brace yourselves!

790
01:29:26,073 --> 01:29:29,411
Move!

791
01:29:42,764 --> 01:29:45,685
We can beat this.

792
01:30:01,645 --> 01:30:05,922
We must get closer.
- Everybody to the main deck.

793
01:30:05,922 --> 01:30:09,365
Get ready.

794
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,250
I want everyone here.

795
01:30:18,649 --> 01:30:22,196
Ready...

796
01:30:21,779 --> 01:30:24,908
now!

797
01:30:28,768 --> 01:30:32,211
Put his head down!

798
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:55,265
Heave!

799
01:31:09,348 --> 01:31:12,791
What are you trying to prove, Edmund?

800
01:31:12,791 --> 01:31:15,920
That you are a man?

801
01:31:23,744 --> 01:31:26,873
Do it!

802
01:31:26,873 --> 01:31:31,255
I can make you that.
I can make you my king.

803
01:31:32,402 --> 01:31:35,428
Just take my hand.

804
01:31:47,946 --> 01:31:51,701
Just give it here.

805
01:31:59,629 --> 01:32:01,612
Do it!

806
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:04,845
Come on!

807
01:32:05,889 --> 01:32:09,644
No!

808
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:45,947
The spell, it has lifted.

809
01:32:51,371 --> 01:32:56,587
Edmund, Caspian, Look!

810
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:26,840
Narnians!

811
01:33:41,236 --> 01:33:45,304
Mommy!
- Helene.

812
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:04,499
Mommy.

813
01:34:08,463 --> 01:34:12,114
Let's have them onboard, clear the decks.

814
01:34:13,887 --> 01:34:18,477
We did it, i knew we would.

815
01:34:17,643 --> 01:34:21,085
It wasn't just us.
- You mean?

816
01:34:21,815 --> 01:34:26,092
I'm here, Lucy.

817
01:34:25,988 --> 01:34:29,952
Here, Lucy.
I'm in the water.

818
01:34:29,952 --> 01:34:34,125
I am a boy again.
A boy!

819
01:34:34,229 --> 01:34:37,672
Eustace! I see your wings have been clipped.

820
01:34:39,967 --> 01:34:46,017
Where sky and water meet.
Where the waves grow ever sweet.

821
01:34:44,974 --> 01:34:48,834
It's sweet!

822
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:53,841
Look.

823
01:34:59,266 --> 01:35:02,291
Aslan's country.

824
01:35:01,874 --> 01:35:04,169
We must have be close.

825
01:35:04,169 --> 01:35:07,924
Well, we've come so far.

826
01:35:18,669 --> 01:35:22,842
So what was it like?
When Aslan changed you back?

827
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:28,371
No matter how hard i tried,
I just couldn't do it myself.

828
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:31,500
Then he came towards me.
It was sort of hurt, but...

829
01:35:31,709 --> 01:35:34,317
It was good pay.

830
01:35:34,317 --> 01:35:38,072
Like when you pull a sword from your foot.

831
01:35:38,072 --> 01:35:40,054
Being a dragon wasn't all bad.

832
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:44,436
I mean I was a better dragon
than a boy, really.

833
01:35:44,436 --> 01:35:47,357
I'm so sorry for being such a sob(?).

834
01:35:47,357 --> 01:35:52,155
It's okay Eustace.
You were a pretty good dragon.

835
01:35:55,493 --> 01:36:00,188
My friends, we've arrived

836
01:36:36,803 --> 01:36:39,098
Aslan.

837
01:36:39,098 --> 01:36:41,915
Welcome, children.
You have done well.

838
01:36:41,915 --> 01:36:45,566
Very well indeed.
You have come far.

839
01:36:45,566 --> 01:36:47,861
Now your journey is at it's end.

840
01:36:47,861 --> 01:36:53,077
Is this your country?
- No, my country lies beyond.

841
01:36:56,311 --> 01:37:00,692
Is my father in your country?
- You can only find that out on yourself, my son.

842
01:37:00,797 --> 01:37:05,491
But you should know that if you continue,
there is no return.

843
01:37:37,934 --> 01:37:39,812
You not going?

844
01:37:39,916 --> 01:37:45,445
Can't imagine my father would be very proud that I
gave up what he died for.

845
01:37:47,531 --> 01:37:51,182
I spent too long wanting what have been taken from me
but not what was given.

846
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:55,147
I was given a kingdom.

847
01:37:55,147 --> 01:37:58,902
People.

848
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:07,873
I promise to be a better king.
- You already are.

849
01:38:08,082 --> 01:38:10,168
Children.

850
01:38:10,481 --> 01:38:13,924
I think perhaps it's time we went home actually then?

851
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:19,140
I thought you loved it here?
- I do!

852
01:38:19,453 --> 01:38:25,086
But I love home
and our family as well!

853
01:38:26,338 --> 01:38:29,572
They need us.

854
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:42,090
Your eminence, ever since i can remember, I've
dreamt of seeing your country

855
01:38:42,403 --> 01:38:48,558
I have had many great adventures in this world,
but nothing has dampen that yearning.

856
01:38:48,558 --> 01:38:52,522
I know I'm hardly worthy,
but with your permission...

857
01:38:52,522 --> 01:38:56,590
I'd lay down my sword for the joy of seeing
your country.

858
01:38:56,590 --> 01:39:00,137
With my own eyes.

859
01:39:02,328 --> 01:39:07,231
My country was made for noble hearts such as yours.

860
01:39:07,231 --> 01:39:09,630
No matter how small that can be.

861
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:13,803
Your majesty.
- Nobody deserves it more.

862
01:39:13,803 --> 01:39:17,036
It's true.

863
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:35,814
May I?
- Well, I suppose...just this..

864
01:39:39,569 --> 01:39:41,760
Goodbye, Lucy.

865
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,138
Don't cry.

866
01:39:58,138 --> 01:40:00,746
I don't understand.

867
01:40:02,624 --> 01:40:07,109
When will I see you again?

868
01:40:07,109 --> 01:40:09,509
What a magnificent puzzle you are.

869
01:40:09,509 --> 01:40:10,447
And a true hero.

870
01:40:11,491 --> 01:40:14,829
It has been my honor to fight beside such
a brave warrior.

871
01:40:15,246 --> 01:40:17,020
And a great friend.

872
01:40:30,164 --> 01:40:33,502
I won't be needing this.

873
01:40:59,581 --> 01:41:03,441
This is our last time here, isn't it?
- Yes.

874
01:41:03,441 --> 01:41:06,675
You have grown up, my dear one.

875
01:41:06,571 --> 01:41:10,743
Just like Peter and Susan.
- Will you visit us in our world?

876
01:41:11,995 --> 01:41:14,186
I shall be watching you always.

877
01:41:17,211 --> 01:41:19,611
How?
- In your world...

878
01:41:19,611 --> 01:41:24,096
I have another name.
You must learn to know me by it.

879
01:41:24,514 --> 01:41:28,478
That was the very reason you were brought
to Narnia.

880
01:41:28,478 --> 01:41:33,589
That by knowing me here for a little,
You'll know me better there.

881
01:41:34,215 --> 01:41:36,510
Will we meet again?

882
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:40,787
Yes, dear one. One day.

883
01:41:56,018 --> 01:41:59,460
You are closest to me I have as family.

884
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:04,259
And that includes you, Eustace.

885
01:42:04,572 --> 01:42:06,658
Thank you.

886
01:42:33,468 --> 01:42:35,241
Will I come back?

887
01:42:35,241 --> 01:42:38,580
Narnia may yet of need of you.

888
01:43:35,746 --> 01:43:42,944
Eustace! What are you doing up there?

889
01:43:42,944 --> 01:43:45,969
Jill drops in for a visit.

890
01:43:56,610 --> 01:44:00,991
We spoke often of Narnia in the days that follow.

891
01:44:02,243 --> 01:44:05,998
And when all my cousins have left.

892
01:44:05,998 --> 01:44:07,980
After the war ended...

893
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:12,153
I missed them with all my heart.

894
01:44:12,153 --> 01:44:15,700
As I know all Narnians will miss them

895
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:19,455
Till the end of time.
