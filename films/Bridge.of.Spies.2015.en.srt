1
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:48,426
<i>The next stop is Broad Street.
Broad Street will be next.</i>

2
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,866
Upstairs. This way.

3
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:13,582
He didn't come up this way? Anything?

4
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:18,349
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

5
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:38,753
Go ahead and park around the corner.

6
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:53,149
Visitors.

7
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:57,735
- Do you mind if I fetch my teeth?
- Colonel, would you turn around, please?

8
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:03,341
- Sit down on the bed.
- Let's go.

9
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,970
They're in the... The teeth
are in the... on the sink.

10
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,174
Look at me. We are agents from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

11
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:20,977
Look at me! I'm talking to you.

12
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:25,114
We've received information concerning
your involvement in espionage.

13
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:28,484
You can either cooperate with us
right now, or you'll be under arrest.

14
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:31,421
- Do you understand, Colonel?
- No, not really.

15
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:34,957
Why do you keep calling me "Colonel"?

16
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:39,028
- You need to get dressed.
- We have to search your apartment.

17
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:42,832
Would you mind if I... cleaned my palette?

18
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:45,668
The paints, it'll get ruined otherwise.

19
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:48,152
It's just behind you there.

20
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:52,208
I have a cloth myself. Thank you.

21
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,977
- All right, start searching the place.
- Thank you.

22
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:57,313
All right, search the mattress,
the bed, the floorboards...

23
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,226
Would you put that in the ashtray

24
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:02,199
- on the windowsill there?
- Take a good look at that desk.

25
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:07,338
Let's see the desk.

26
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:15,880
Wouldn't want to get this ruined.

27
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:31,581
<i>Don't say "my guy."</i>

28
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:34,317
<i>He's not "my guy."</i>

29
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:37,587
Yes, he's "your guy."
Who are we talking about?

30
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:41,757
We're talking about a guy
who was insured by my client.

31
00:10:41,857 --> 00:10:44,375
So, don't make him "my guy."

32
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:46,495
Okay, fine.

33
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:49,599
My point is,
the guy insured by your client,

34
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,602
he doesn't deny that any
of these things happened.

35
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:55,271
"These... These things"?

36
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:57,640
Yes, these five things.

37
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,143
Wait, hold it, hold it, hold it.
Not five things.

38
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,180
- One thing.
- Clearly, it's five things.

39
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,484
Well, I'm sorry, it's not clear to me.
Five things? Explain it to me.

40
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,754
- It's self-evident.
- Okay, then tell me what happened.

41
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:15,304
Tell me the story in a way
that makes sense for five things.

42
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:18,928
- Fine, absolutely. Your guy is...
- Not my guy. Insured by my client.

43
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:22,198
The guy insured by your client
is driving down State Highway 19

44
00:11:22,298 --> 00:11:24,734
when he loses control of his car
and hits my five guys,

45
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:28,437
the five guys who hired me to represent them
because you're not honoring your claim.

46
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:32,174
You mean my client is not honoring
the claim, the insurance company?

47
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,944
Mr. Donovan, we're all clear
on who's who, here.

48
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:38,814
Except my client honors every claim.
They do, Mr. Bates.

49
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:41,951
Every single legitimate claim,
up to the limit of their liability,

50
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:46,288
which is $100,000 per accident,
in the case of this man's policy.

51
00:11:46,388 --> 00:11:51,227
And this is one claim. According to
your description, "He hit my five guys."

52
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:54,263
The guy insured by my client
had one accident.

53
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:58,751
One, one, one. Losing control
of the car and hitting five motorcyclists.

54
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,371
From their point of view,
five things happened.

55
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:06,023
Well, look, Bob. May I? Bob?

56
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:08,210
"Jim."

57
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,214
If I go bowling and I throw a strike, one
thing happened. Ten things didn't happen.

58
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,998
Jim, my guys aren't bowling pins, as much
as your guy may have treated them as such.

59
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:20,289
If... let me finish. Let me finish.
If your house is insured for $100,000

60
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:23,726
and a tornado carries it away,
it carried away one house.

61
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,997
It didn't pick up every stick of furniture
and destroy it in a separate incident.

62
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:30,766
If that is what you're saying...

63
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:34,136
well, then there is never
any limit to our liability

64
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:37,173
and that is the end
of the insurance business.

65
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:40,450
And then, Bob, nobody is safe.

66
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:47,283
Watters, Cowan and Donovan.
How may I direct your call?

67
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:50,086
- Morning, Mr. Donovan.
- Good morning, Alison.

68
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,254
I moved your 9:00 a.m.
with Prudential, sir.

69
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,106
- Why did you do that?
- I asked her to.

70
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,959
Is everything all right, Tom?

71
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,078
Why don't you leave your stuff
with Alison. Come on inside.

72
00:13:00,897 --> 00:13:04,266
Something pretty important has come up.
Somebody's here to see us.

73
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:08,638
Natalie's getting your coffee.
Nescafe, cream, two lumps, right?

74
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:11,255
That's right. Thanks.

75
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:13,409
- Lynn!
- Jim!

76
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:16,846
- Nice to see you again. How's the family?
- Great, good. Thanks. How's Annie?

77
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:19,315
Homicidal.
We had the in-laws for the holiday.

78
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:22,551
Well, if she acts on it,
she'll have good representation.

79
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:25,035
Now, what's up?

80
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:35,398
Okay, here's the thing. The Soviet spy
they caught, we want you to defend him.

81
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:38,015
Here's the indictment.

82
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:47,109
- I'm not sure I wanna pick that up.
- The accused doesn't know any lawyers.

83
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:50,446
The federal court tossed it into our lap.

84
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:54,150
The Bar Committee took a vote.
You're the unanimous choice.

85
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,019
It was important to us...
It's important to our country, Jim,

86
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,188
that this man is seen
as getting a fair shake.

87
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:01,223
American justice will be on trial.

88
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:04,143
Well, of course, when you put it
that way, it's an honor to be asked.

89
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:08,864
But... Lynn, I'm an insurance lawyer.
I haven't done criminal work in years.

90
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:13,152
It's like riding a bike, isn't it?
You distinguished yourself at Nuremberg.

91
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,905
- I was on the prosecution team.
- Not the point.

92
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:18,289
You're no stranger to criminal law.

93
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:22,214
Jim, look at the situation.
The man is publicly reviled.

94
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:25,147
- And I will be, too.
- Yes, in more ignorant quarters.

95
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:29,018
But that's exactly why this
has to be done, and capably done.

96
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:34,137
It can't look like our justice system
tosses people on the ash heap.

97
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:41,045
Suppose I did,
what's the evidence look like?

98
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:43,065
Pretty overwhelming.

99
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:45,701
Great. Great.

100
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:49,249
Everyone will hate me
but at least I'll lose.

101
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:54,910
Well, what do you think, Tom?
The firm will suffer. I have work here.

102
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:59,081
I think it's a patriotic duty.
It's an important mission.

103
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,917
I told Lynn, the firm can't say no,

104
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:04,434
and you'd have a tough time
saying no, too.

105
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,740
I think you have to defend
the son of a bitch.

106
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,293
- So, you're doing it?
- Doing what?

107
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:14,430
Defending Abel, the Soviet spy.

108
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,764
I may. I have to speak to...

109
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:18,434
Wait, how do you know?
Did they post it on the bulletin board?

110
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:24,127
- No, I was talking to Richard Earl...
- If I do this, I'm going to need your help.

111
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:28,141
Can you work tonight?

112
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:31,410
Well, I have a dinner date, sir.

113
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,784
It's Tuesday, right? Yeah, no, I'm free,
completely free. Thank you, sir.

114
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,092
But it's also an honor.

115
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,227
And the Bar Association asked me

116
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:48,731
because they want to show that even
a spy gets a capable advocate.

117
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:51,000
Well, maybe it's the kind of honor
we could do without.

118
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,703
Hey, honey, what are you doing home?

119
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:58,540
- I got stood up.
- Well, that's despicable.

120
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,243
- Who is this knot-head?
- I'd rather not say.

121
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:04,413
Well, sit down. We just started.
People are scared.

122
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:08,818
They're building bomb shelters to protect
themselves from people like this man.

123
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:13,555
I go to the store, people are buying
canned food and potassium tablets.

124
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:16,392
It's all about this man
and what he represents.

125
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:18,905
- He's a threat to all of us. A traitor.
- Who's a traitor?

126
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:21,263
- The Rosenbergs were traitors.
- Who were they?

127
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:23,165
They gave atomic secrets to the Russians.

128
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,267
They were Americans.
They betrayed their country.

129
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:28,638
You can't accuse Abel of being a traitor.
He's not an American.

130
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:31,807
Oh, listen to yourself.
You're defending him already.

131
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,910
You're rehearsing it on me. You said
you were just thinking about taking it.

132
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,913
I am just thinking about it,
just very hard.

133
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:40,783
Everyone deserves a defense.
Every person matters.

134
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:44,086
Jim, what do we deserve?
Do you know how people will look at us?

135
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,588
The family of a man
trying to free a traitor?

136
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:49,680
- He's not a traitor, Mary.
- Yes. Roger, get that! He's not a traitor...

137
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,395
- Why do I have to do all the work?
- You wait till we say grace.

138
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:56,131
He's the most unpopular man in this country,
and you're trying to take second place!

139
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:59,538
- Yeah, and I'm third.
- Carol, you just dated the wrong guy.

140
00:16:59,638 --> 00:17:02,371
Mary, don't make this an argument
when we're not having an argument.

141
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:06,152
You're against him, I'm for him? I'm not for
him. I'm not for the Russians spying on us.

142
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:09,311
I'm for his right to have a defense
in a court of law,

143
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:12,649
- which is why they call it a court of law.
- I didn't mean to interrupt dinner.

144
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:16,908
- A court of law... Hey, Doug.
- Oh, no, not at all. Hello, Doug.

145
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:20,129
- Jim was just flailing.
- ...a kangaroo court. I'm not flailing.

146
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:24,057
Go ahead, Doug, you can join us for dinner.
We're having meatloaf tonight.

147
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:29,431
So, you came over to help Jim think
about whether he's taking the case?

148
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:33,499
Oh, we're taking it!
It's exciting, isn't it?

149
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:43,612
Lord, we thank thee for thy blessings
we are about to receive.

150
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:46,252
Thy bounty through Christ, our Lord. Amen.

151
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:55,924
Good morning, sir. My name is Jim Donovan.

152
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:59,895
These are my credentials. I am a partner
in Watters, Cowan and Donovan.

153
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:04,263
I was admitted to
the New York Bar in 1941.

154
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,407
You have been charged
with three counts and 19 overt acts.

155
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:15,944
Conspiracy to transmit United States defense
and atomic secrets to the Soviet Union,

156
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:20,546
conspiracy to gather secrets, and failing
to register as a foreign agent.

157
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:28,687
Do many foreign agents register?

158
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:36,298
If you don't mind my asking, sir...

159
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:40,633
since your arrest, where have you been?

160
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:45,604
I couldn't say for certain.

161
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,907
You don't know?

162
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:54,513
They drove me to an airport and put me
on a plane, took me off the plane.

163
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:58,084
Somewhere hot.

164
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,024
- It's hot here.
- Hotter, very humid.

165
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:05,357
They put me in a room.

166
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,960
Were you beaten?

167
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,767
No. I was talked to.

168
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:14,870
- Offers were made.
- What do you mean?

169
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,471
Offers of employment,
to work for your government.

170
00:19:20,776 --> 00:19:23,145
I was told if I cooperated,

171
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,447
no further charges
would be made against me.

172
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:29,548
And I would be given money.

173
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:33,285
And you declined?

174
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,391
As you see.

175
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,694
Well, of course I can't endorse that.

176
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:42,798
I feel duty-bound to urge you to cooperate
with the U.S. government.

177
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:46,969
Well, I said no. Perhaps you could relay
to your friends at the CIA that I meant it.

178
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:49,505
No, no, no. I...

179
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,338
I don't work for the agency.

180
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:55,444
I don't work for the government.

181
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:58,614
I am here to offer my services
as your legal counsel.

182
00:19:58,714 --> 00:20:02,489
If you accept them as such...

183
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:04,453
I work for you.

184
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:07,488
If I accept you?

185
00:20:13,528 --> 00:20:15,495
Are you good at what you do?

186
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,532
Yeah. Yeah, I'm pretty good.

187
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,817
Have you represented many accused spies?

188
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,038
No, not yet.

189
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,371
This will be a first for the both of us.

190
00:20:38,286 --> 00:20:39,413
Yes.

191
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:46,124
- All right.
- "All right"? You accept?

192
00:20:47,562 --> 00:20:51,366
- Yes, all right.
- Good, okay.

193
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:54,527
Let's start here. If you are firm
in your resolve not to cooperate

194
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,471
- with the U.S. government...
- I am.

195
00:20:56,571 --> 00:21:01,310
Yeah. Then do not talk to anybody else about
your case, inside of government or out.

196
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,546
Except to me,
to the extent that you trust me.

197
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:06,582
I have a mandate to serve you.
Nobody else does.

198
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:10,619
Quite frankly, everybody else has an interest
in sending you to the electric chair.

199
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:12,685
All right.

200
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,960
You don't seem alarmed.

201
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,863
Would it help?

202
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:37,913
I... I would like materials to draw with.

203
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:40,315
That's not possible.

204
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:44,283
A pencil, a piece of paper. Cigarettes.

205
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:47,854
Please?

206
00:21:55,163 --> 00:22:00,902
Mr. Donovan, you have men like me
doing the same for your country.

207
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,872
If they were caught,

208
00:22:03,972 --> 00:22:07,973
I'm sure that you would wish them
to be treated well.

209
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:14,381
- What's your name?
- Francis Gary Powers.

210
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:18,253
Rank, service?

211
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:21,554
First Lieutenant, United States Air Force.

212
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:26,595
Do you have any association
with the Soviet Union, Lieutenant Powers?

213
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:28,930
- Kidding?
- Just answer the questions, Lieutenant.

214
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,333
Yes, no, or as simply as you can.

215
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,735
Do you have any association
with the Soviet Union?

216
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:35,613
Hell, no.

217
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:39,638
Do you know why you're here?

218
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,578
Is that a no?

219
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,213
Yes. I mean...

220
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:49,284
No, it's just "no." Yes, I have
absolutely no idea why I'm here.

221
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:52,118
- Eyes front, Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

222
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:12,004
How'd you do in there, Gary?

223
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,377
Pretty good. Think I got my name right.

224
00:23:16,377 --> 00:23:19,411
You probably outscored Shinn, then.

225
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:22,618
- Who's winning?
- That would be me.

226
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:24,386
Oh. Well, deal me in.

227
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,822
So, these are all mine, then.

228
00:23:26,922 --> 00:23:29,364
I told you boys not to play with him.

229
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:58,717
Okay, drivers, here's the deal.

230
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:03,337
You've been selected for a mission
which you are not to discuss with anyone

231
00:24:03,437 --> 00:24:06,428
outside of this room. No one.

232
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,797
I don't care who you trust.

233
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:12,501
Wife, mother, sweetheart.
The good Lord when you pray at night.

234
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:17,028
You don't tell any of them anything
of what I'm about to tell you.

235
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:22,477
Each of you drivers
has met certain qualifications.

236
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:24,713
High level security clearance.

237
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:28,349
Exceptional pilot ratings in excess
of the required hours flight time

238
00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:30,435
in a single-seat aircraft.

239
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,388
We are engaged in a war.

240
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:37,519
This war does not, for the moment, involve
men-at-arms. It involves information.

241
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,745
You will be collecting information.

242
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,564
You will be gathering intelligence
about the enemy.

243
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:46,135
The intelligence you gather
could give us the upper hand

244
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:50,268
in a full thermonuclear exchange
with the Soviet Union.

245
00:24:51,306 --> 00:24:53,639
Or it could prevent one.

246
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:57,913
For public purposes,
as far as your wife or mother

247
00:24:58,013 --> 00:25:01,750
or sweetheart or the good Lord above,
your mission does not exist.

248
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,720
If it does not exist, you do not exist.

249
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,221
You cannot be shot down.
You cannot be captured.

250
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:17,295
You work for the CIA now.

251
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:33,445
So, Jim, I heard your guy is speaking
with a phony accent.

252
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:35,684
Does he keep that up all the time?

253
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,353
Actually, I'm pretty sure
that's just the way he talks.

254
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,789
He's got the Russian name
but a British passport.

255
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:43,525
Well, I doubt that that's genuine.

256
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,327
So, Jim, where are we? I see here...

257
00:25:46,427 --> 00:25:48,363
Yes... Judge, you see,

258
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:52,868
I just don't think that three weeks
is going to do it, here.

259
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,070
We... got a massive amount
of evidence, as you know.

260
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,472
- You wanna postpone?
- Six weeks.

261
00:25:57,572 --> 00:26:00,776
I mean, there's just myself
and my associate, basically.

262
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:03,509
- Jim, is this serious?
- Sir?

263
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:07,783
Is this serious?

264
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,186
Yes. Yes, indeed, it is.
You can see in the filing...

265
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:13,865
Jim, this man is a Soviet spy.

266
00:26:13,965 --> 00:26:16,702
- Allegedly.
- Come on, Counselor!

267
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:19,728
Your Honor.

268
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,532
Of course, I salute you. We all salute you
for taking on a thankless task.

269
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:28,003
This man has to have due process.
But let's not kid each other.

270
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:30,872
He'll receive a capable defense.

271
00:26:30,972 --> 00:26:34,509
And, God willing, he'll be convicted.

272
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:37,579
Come on, Counselor.
Let's not play games with this.

273
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,814
Not in my courtroom.

274
00:26:39,914 --> 00:26:41,750
We have a date...

275
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,683
and we're going to trial.

276
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:54,663
Taxi!

277
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:58,355
Taxi! I see your light on!

278
00:26:58,455 --> 00:27:00,802
Son of a bitch.

279
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:03,538
Can't wait to get back to Manhattan.

280
00:27:03,638 --> 00:27:06,160
His light was on, right?

281
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,107
Son of a bitch.

282
00:27:54,823 --> 00:27:57,892
Against their level of comfort.
The statute hasn't changed.

283
00:27:57,992 --> 00:27:59,527
Oh, excuse me, sir.

284
00:27:59,627 --> 00:28:01,894
Pardon me. Sorry.

285
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:34,393
Mr. Donovan.

286
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:38,297
What?

287
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:43,058
What?

288
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,252
CIA.

289
00:28:57,352 --> 00:28:59,151
Yeah.

290
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:01,519
I just wanted to chat.

291
00:29:04,693 --> 00:29:09,228
- How's the case going?
- Case is going great. Couldn't be better.

292
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:13,365
Has your guy talked?

293
00:29:16,804 --> 00:29:18,374
Excuse me.

294
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:22,508
You met him. Has he talked?
Has he said anything yet?

295
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,883
- We're not having this conversation.
- No, of course not.

296
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,185
No, I mean, we really are not having it.

297
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:33,922
You're asking me to violate
attorney-client privilege.

298
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,323
Oh, come on, Counselor.

299
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:37,725
I wish people like you would quit saying
"Oh, come on, Counselor."

300
00:29:37,825 --> 00:29:41,062
I didn't like it the first time it happened
today. A judge said it to me twice.

301
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:44,498
And the more I hear it,
the more I don't like it.

302
00:29:46,434 --> 00:29:48,970
Okay, well, listen, I understand
attorney-client privilege.

303
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,107
I understand all the legal gamesmanship.

304
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,843
And I understand
that's how you make a living.

305
00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:58,810
But I'm talking to you
about something else.

306
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,850
The security of your country.

307
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,020
And I'm sorry if the way
I put it offends you.

308
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,723
But we need to know
what Abel is telling you.

309
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:11,025
You understand me, Donovan?

310
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:15,761
We need to know.
Don't go "Boy Scout" on me.

311
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:18,217
We don't have a rule book, here.

312
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,769
You're Agent Hoffman, yeah?

313
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:23,571
Yeah.

314
00:30:23,671 --> 00:30:26,741
- German extraction.
- Yeah, so?

315
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:31,312
My name's Donovan. Irish.
Both sides, mother and father.

316
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:34,582
I'm Irish, you're German.

317
00:30:34,682 --> 00:30:37,452
But what makes us both Americans?

318
00:30:37,552 --> 00:30:39,754
Just one thing.

319
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:42,323
One, one, one.

320
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,459
The rule book.

321
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,063
We call it the Constitution
and we agree to the rules,

322
00:30:48,163 --> 00:30:50,932
and that's what makes us Americans.
It's all that makes us Americans

323
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:55,083
so don't tell me there's no rule book,
and don't nod at me, you son of a bitch.

324
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,529
Do we need to worry about you?

325
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:12,900
Not if I'm left alone to do my job.

326
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:30,772
From this moment forward you will not
refer to the U-2 as a spy plane

327
00:31:30,872 --> 00:31:32,907
or reconnaissance aircraft.

328
00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:35,076
You will refer to it as <i>"The Article."</i>

329
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:38,346
<i>The Article</i> has an 80-foot wingspan.

330
00:31:38,446 --> 00:31:43,985
Powered by a single Pratt
and Whitney J57 P-37 engine.

331
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:46,287
10,000 pounds of thrust

332
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:50,398
and a maximum speed of 430 miles an hour.

333
00:31:50,498 --> 00:31:55,163
She may not be quick, but at your
cruising altitude of 70,000 feet,

334
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:58,066
- nothing will come close to you.
- 70,000?

335
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,069
The idea is the enemy
doesn't even know you're there.

336
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,134
It looks kind of flimsy.

337
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,937
Every extra pound of weight
costs a foot in altitude, and...

338
00:32:10,037 --> 00:32:12,589
we need to accommodate the cameras.

339
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:17,852
That's a 4,500-millimeter lens,
times three.

340
00:32:17,952 --> 00:32:19,988
A pin-sharp panoramic camera

341
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:24,859
four times as powerful as any aerial
reconnaissance cameras we've ever used.

342
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:28,296
You're gonna be taking pictures,
lots of pictures.

343
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:34,769
At 70,000 feet, <i>The Article</i> can photograph
2,000 square miles of territory in one pass.

344
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:39,407
Now, drivers, give Agent Sumner
your undivided attention.

345
00:32:39,507 --> 00:32:42,898
The items you'll need
on your mission are over here.

346
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:48,717
B camera, Revere 8 model 40 magazine,
Keystone Capri K-25, silver.

347
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:54,489
Hollow-handle shaving brush. Complete set
of cipher tables on edible silver foil.

348
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:57,371
Specialist photographic equipment.

349
00:32:58,326 --> 00:33:02,076
Yeah, we... we get the idea. Thank you.

350
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,411
Excuse me, Agent... Bosco. "Blasco."

351
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:18,179
Sir.

352
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:22,418
There seems to be a subsection
to this list here.

353
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:25,053
Well, most of this stuff
came from his studio,

354
00:33:25,153 --> 00:33:27,922
but the rest is from the hotel
room he was holed up in.

355
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:30,491
Where we found him.

356
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,927
The hotel room you searched?

357
00:33:33,027 --> 00:33:34,529
Well, yeah.

358
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:38,162
- Can I see the warrant?
- The what?

359
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:41,836
Yeah, explain this to me.
There was a warrant.

360
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:45,506
There was a warrant. A civil detention
writ for the arrest of an alien,

361
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:49,144
but there was no search warrant
for suspicion of criminal activity.

362
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:52,380
So the search and the evidence
that is the fruit of that search,

363
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,315
that's all tainted
and should not be admitted.

364
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:58,033
What protections is he due, Your Honor?
The man is not... The man is what?

365
00:33:58,133 --> 00:34:01,840
He's Rudolf Ivanovich Abel.
He is a Soviet citizen.

366
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,491
He's not an American.

367
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:07,362
1886, <i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins.</i>

368
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,798
The court held that even aliens,
in that case Chinese immigrants,

369
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:13,802
could not be held to answer for a crime
without due process of law,

370
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:16,437
including any alien that
entered the country illegally.

371
00:34:16,537 --> 00:34:21,242
The Department of Justice has its
first allegiance to the United States.

372
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:23,578
I don't see how an alien,
if he's here illegally,

373
00:34:23,678 --> 00:34:26,581
how he suffered deprivation of rights.

374
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:30,184
Rights as what? An American?

375
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:34,854
Rights as what, Counselor?
We're in a battle for civilization.

376
00:34:34,954 --> 00:34:38,426
This Russian spy came here
to threaten our way of life.

377
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:40,528
Now, I have a courtroom of people waiting.

378
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:44,782
Get out there, sit beside the Russian.
Let's get this over and done with.

379
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,016
And your motion is denied.

380
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,707
He should take some insurance
out on himself.

381
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:55,823
- How did we do?
- In there?

382
00:34:57,912 --> 00:35:01,749
Not too good. Apparently,
you're not an American citizen.

383
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,718
That's true.

384
00:35:03,818 --> 00:35:08,206
And according to your boss,
you're not a Soviet citizen either.

385
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:11,638
Well, the boss isn't always right...

386
00:35:12,226 --> 00:35:15,008
but he's always the boss.

387
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,068
Do you never worry?

388
00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:23,400
Would it help?

389
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:32,292
All rise.

390
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:37,318
"I pledge allegiance to the Flag

391
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:40,521
"of the United States of America,

392
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:44,625
"and to the Republic for which it stands,

393
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:49,330
"one Nation under God, indivisible,

394
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,146
"with liberty and justice for all."

395
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:59,986
<i>First, you have to know what happens
when an atomic bomb explodes.</i>

396
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:05,080
<i>There is a bright flash,
brighter than the sun.</i>

397
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,263
<i>It can smash in buildings,
break windows all over town.</i>

398
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:16,891
<i>But if you duck and cover like Bert,
you will be much safer.</i>

399
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:21,329
<i>There are two kinds of attack,
with warning and without any warning.</i>

400
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:29,304
- What's going on in here?
- Okay, Dad, this is really important.

401
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:31,372
When the war begins,
the first thing they do

402
00:36:31,472 --> 00:36:34,108
is cut off all the water
and all the electricity.

403
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:37,912
So the first thing we should do is keep
this filled, use the shower in your room,

404
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:40,348
use the sink downstairs,
the garden hose outside...

405
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,350
Those are good ideas.

406
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:47,634
But, Roger, I don't see this as being
something you ever have to worry about.

407
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,227
Yeah, but when you hear the sirens,

408
00:36:49,327 --> 00:36:52,294
there may not be enough time
to fill the tub and the sinks.

409
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,976
Not gonna be any sirens.

410
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,532
What is this?

411
00:36:57,732 --> 00:37:01,469
When the bomb comes, the Reds
will aim for the Empire State Building.

412
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:04,305
But the bomb goes off at 10,000 feet up.

413
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:08,329
In <i>Life</i> magazine, it's called an airburst,
and if the bomb is 50 megatons,

414
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:13,982
the blast wave goes out and out and out
and melts everything from here to here.

415
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:16,784
Including where we live. Here.

416
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:18,486
Yeah, right there.

417
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:21,890
But, you know, Roger, no one
is dropping atomic bombs on us.

418
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,526
But the Russians want to. You know
that Russian guy you're defending?

419
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:28,263
He's here to get things ready
for the guys who drop the bombs.

420
00:37:28,363 --> 00:37:30,665
No, no, he's not... Not here for that.

421
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:34,068
He's not even Russian. He was born,
we think, in Northern England.

422
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,817
But he's a spy for Russia.

423
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:38,706
I don't even understand what you're doing.

424
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:41,075
You're not a Communist,
so why are you defending one?

425
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,277
Well, because it's my job.

426
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:45,509
It never used to be.

427
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:19,647
In the case of the United States
of America versus Rudolf Abel,

428
00:38:19,747 --> 00:38:24,252
as to the first count in the indictment,
how do you find the defendant?

429
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:27,121
Guilty or not guilty?

430
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,057
Guilty.

431
00:38:29,157 --> 00:38:32,860
- As to the second count?
- Guilty.

432
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,030
- As to the third count?
- Guilty.

433
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,633
Your Honor, I make a motion
to set aside these guilty verdicts

434
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,936
- against the weight of evidence.
- Denied.

435
00:38:42,036 --> 00:38:46,006
The jury is discharged. Thank you all.

436
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:47,984
I would like to add that,
if I were one of you,

437
00:38:48,084 --> 00:38:50,924
I would've reached the same verdict.

438
00:38:51,345 --> 00:38:54,910
Sentencing will be...

439
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,192
November 15.

440
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:10,368
The death sentence is not
a foregone conclusion. Don't worry.

441
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:14,396
I'm not afraid to die, Mr. Donovan.

442
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,705
Although...

443
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:20,603
it wouldn't be my first choice.

444
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,827
You left this behind.

445
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:30,112
Oh, thank you.

446
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,849
Oh, thank you very much.

447
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:56,939
You've never asked me
if the charges were true.

448
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:02,435
If I am indeed a spy.

449
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,005
This is how we do it.

450
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:08,927
The case against you matters.
Making them prove it matters.

451
00:40:09,027 --> 00:40:12,593
The fiction is... Whether you
did it or not doesn't matter.

452
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:15,800
The state has to prove it,
that you're a spy.

453
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,932
So you're not curious?

454
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:22,269
No, not really.
I always assumed you were an artist.

455
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:26,574
My wife, she's the artist.
She's a musician.

456
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,311
In the Children's Orchestra of Moscow.

457
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:33,781
- What instrument?
- The harp.

458
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:38,317
Then, she's an angel.

459
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:51,621
Standing there like that, you remind me
of a man who used to come to our house

460
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:54,001
when I was young.

461
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:58,773
My father used to say, "Watch this man."

462
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,404
So I did, every time he came.

463
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:05,079
And never once...

464
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:09,314
did he do anything remarkable.

465
00:41:10,317 --> 00:41:12,582
And I remind you of him?

466
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:19,660
This one time, I was
about the age of your son.

467
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,826
Our house was overrun
by partisan border guards.

468
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:28,903
Dozens of them.

469
00:41:29,003 --> 00:41:31,071
My father was beaten,
my mother was beaten,

470
00:41:31,171 --> 00:41:35,535
and this man, my father's friend,
he was beaten.

471
00:41:36,543 --> 00:41:39,361
And I watched this man.

472
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:44,320
Every time they hit him...

473
00:41:45,285 --> 00:41:47,883
he stood back up again.

474
00:41:49,189 --> 00:41:51,793
So they hit him harder.

475
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,732
Still, he got back to his feet.

476
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:03,116
I think because of this they stopped
the beating. They let him live.

477
00:42:10,978 --> 00:42:13,887
I remember them saying it.

478
00:42:20,554 --> 00:42:23,419
It sort of means, like...

479
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:27,523
"standing man."

480
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,727
Standing man.

481
00:42:42,943 --> 00:42:45,579
- Hello, Jim!
- Millie, you're a vision.

482
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:48,182
Mortie's busy getting kitted out.

483
00:42:48,282 --> 00:42:50,579
But come on in.

484
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:53,987
- Scotch, Jim?
- Oh, yes, please. Thank you.

485
00:42:54,087 --> 00:42:56,624
Just a drop of water.

486
00:42:56,724 --> 00:43:00,528
- Your Honor.
- Hello, Jim. Just going out.

487
00:43:00,628 --> 00:43:02,630
Got a few minutes though.

488
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,987
March of Dimes thing. Millie is active.

489
00:43:07,534 --> 00:43:08,936
Well, thank you for seeing me.

490
00:43:09,036 --> 00:43:13,107
I just wanted to give you
my two cents on the sentencing.

491
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:16,243
And I thought maybe
I should pester you at home

492
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,346
as not all of my points
are narrowly legal.

493
00:43:19,446 --> 00:43:22,049
Yeah, well, it's that kind of case.

494
00:43:22,149 --> 00:43:26,887
I hope I wasn't too scratchy during
the trial but it's exactly what you say.

495
00:43:26,987 --> 00:43:30,219
Nothing about this is narrowly legal.

496
00:43:30,624 --> 00:43:32,951
There are bigger issues.

497
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,725
Bigger issues!

498
00:43:37,864 --> 00:43:40,329
Thank you, thank you.

499
00:43:42,169 --> 00:43:43,771
Sir...

500
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:48,609
I think it could be considered in
the best interests of the United States

501
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,741
that Abel remain alive.

502
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:55,449
Why? I'm not saying I've made up my mind

503
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:59,019
but if he was gonna cooperate, work with
the government, he would've done it already.

504
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,254
- True, but the issue here...
- You can't... Excuse me.

505
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,697
You can't say it's in the best
interest of the United States

506
00:44:09,797 --> 00:44:13,901
that he spend the rest
of his days in a prison cell.

507
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:19,239
- How is this the national interest?
- Not the incarceration itself, sir.

508
00:44:19,707 --> 00:44:22,810
It is possible that,
in the foreseeable future,

509
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:27,948
an American of equivalent rank
might be captured by Soviet Russia.

510
00:44:28,048 --> 00:44:31,480
We might want to have someone to trade.

511
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:35,856
That sounds like spinning what-ifs.
You could do that till the cows come home.

512
00:44:35,956 --> 00:44:37,685
It's my business, what-ifs.

513
00:44:37,785 --> 00:44:41,428
I'm in insurance. And there's
nothing implausible about this one.

514
00:44:41,528 --> 00:44:44,565
It's entirely in the realm
of what could happen.

515
00:44:44,665 --> 00:44:48,168
It's the kind of probability
that people buy insurance for.

516
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:52,039
If we send this guy to his death,
we leave ourselves wide open.

517
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:54,942
No policy in our back pocket

518
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:57,710
for the day the storm comes.

519
00:44:59,046 --> 00:45:01,315
Nice speech.

520
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:06,487
Sir, there is also
the humanitarian argument.

521
00:45:06,587 --> 00:45:10,953
Should he die for doing the job
they sent him to do?

522
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,523
All right, Counselor.

523
00:45:16,163 --> 00:45:18,293
I gotta run.

524
00:45:21,034 --> 00:45:23,398
Good seeing you, Jim.

525
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:28,999
I'll walk you out.

526
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:32,359
All rise.

527
00:45:33,881 --> 00:45:36,706
The United States District Court
for the Eastern District of New York

528
00:45:36,806 --> 00:45:41,183
is now in session. The honorable
Mortimer Byers presiding.

529
00:45:44,892 --> 00:45:47,022
Be seated.

530
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,739
The defendant will please rise.

531
00:46:14,488 --> 00:46:17,424
In the measured judgment of this court
the following sentence,

532
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:22,096
based upon the jury's verdict of guilty
as to each count of the indictment,

533
00:46:22,396 --> 00:46:26,734
is believed to meet the test
which has been stated.

534
00:46:26,934 --> 00:46:30,123
Pursuant to the verdict
of guilty as to all counts,

535
00:46:32,472 --> 00:46:37,586
the defendant is committed to the custody of
the Attorney General of the United States...

536
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:42,142
for imprisonment in a federal institution
to be selected by him

537
00:46:42,242 --> 00:46:44,456
for a period of 30 years.

538
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:47,921
Marshals, you may take
the defendant into custody.

539
00:46:48,021 --> 00:46:50,657
- No electrocution?
- No. No, no.

540
00:46:50,757 --> 00:46:53,660
Why aren't we hanging him? In the name
of God, why aren't we hanging him?

541
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,733
- Sit down, sir!
- He's a spy! He's killing us with his lies!

542
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,901
In the name of God,
why aren't we hanging him?

543
00:47:01,001 --> 00:47:02,598
That's right!

544
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:06,066
He's a spy!

545
00:47:09,309 --> 00:47:11,345
Mr. Donovan! Mr. Donovan!

546
00:47:11,445 --> 00:47:15,410
Just one question. Just one question, sir.

547
00:47:21,455 --> 00:47:24,319
My hat! My hat! My hat!

548
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:28,395
Nobody here has a comment. Mr. and Mrs.
Donovan are not answering questions.

549
00:47:28,495 --> 00:47:31,031
How do you feel now that
this national nightmare is over?

550
00:47:31,131 --> 00:47:35,903
- Mr. Donovan, are you happy with the verdict?
- We're in firm ground for a case on appeal.

551
00:47:36,003 --> 00:47:38,433
- Appeal?
- Appeal, yes.

552
00:47:51,718 --> 00:47:56,290
Jim, you did a great job.
You fulfilled your mandate and then some.

553
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:00,761
But the man is a spy. The verdict's correct
and there's no reason to appeal it.

554
00:48:00,861 --> 00:48:04,031
There's ample procedural reason.
We know the search is tainted.

555
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,367
And Fourth Amendment issues will always
weigh more heavily in an appellate forum.

556
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:11,705
- We've got a good shot.
- What the goddamn hell are you talking about?

557
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:15,142
We were supposed to show he had
a capable defense, which we did.

558
00:48:15,242 --> 00:48:17,444
Why are you citing the goddamn
Constitution at me?

559
00:48:17,544 --> 00:48:19,279
Tom, if you look me in the eye

560
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:22,582
and tell me we don't have grounds
for an appeal, I'll drop it right now.

561
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:24,751
I'm not saying that.
You know what I'm saying.

562
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:26,620
Tom's saying there's a cost
to these things.

563
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,655
That's right.

564
00:48:28,755 --> 00:48:32,587
A cost to both your family and your firm.

565
00:49:06,293 --> 00:49:08,562
I've missed music.

566
00:49:08,662 --> 00:49:11,984
They checked the radio to make sure
there was no transmitter in it.

567
00:49:12,084 --> 00:49:14,445
I'm sure they did.

568
00:49:15,569 --> 00:49:17,683
Shostakovich.

569
00:49:19,439 --> 00:49:22,938
That's a very great artist, Shostakovich.

570
00:49:37,624 --> 00:49:39,788
I think...

571
00:49:40,694 --> 00:49:44,498
our strongest grounds for reversal...

572
00:49:44,598 --> 00:49:46,961
are constitutional.

573
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:53,064
Our best chance is if the Supreme Court
agrees to review our case.

574
00:49:58,145 --> 00:50:00,172
Jim...

575
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:08,487
You should be careful.

576
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:15,123
Careful.

577
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,999
<i>77 Sunset Strip</i>

578
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,335
<i>Edward Byrnes.</i>

579
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,837
<i>77 Sunset Strip</i>

580
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,354
<i>And Richard Long.</i>

581
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:29,043
- <i>Good morning, Suzanne.</i>
- <i>Good morning, Dick.</i>

582
00:50:29,143 --> 00:50:32,205
<i>There is a special delivery letter
here for you.</i>

583
00:50:32,646 --> 00:50:34,909
<i>Oh, her.</i>

584
00:50:44,457 --> 00:50:46,821
Mom!

585
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,262
What in God's name happened?

586
00:50:49,362 --> 00:50:51,743
Honey, are you all right? Are you hurt?

587
00:50:51,843 --> 00:50:54,828
I've got her. Upstairs!

588
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,740
- I sat with my back against the wall, Dad!
- Are you all right? Are you okay?

589
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,842
Dad, I sat with my back against the wall!
Away from the windows!

590
00:51:02,942 --> 00:51:06,080
Good, good, good, good, good.
Good boy, good boy, good boy.

591
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:10,050
Okay. It's okay. It's all right,
they're gone, they're gone.

592
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,819
They're cowards. They're gone.

593
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:14,721
We have detectives canvassing
the neighborhood.

594
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,756
Maybe we'll find a description of the car

595
00:51:16,856 --> 00:51:20,093
- but I don't think it's very likely.
- We're gonna need protection.

596
00:51:20,193 --> 00:51:23,887
I have instructions to leave
two cars here. It'll be pretty obvious...

597
00:51:23,987 --> 00:51:27,167
For how long? I have to be
in Washington later on this week.

598
00:51:27,267 --> 00:51:29,836
What are you doing?
What are you doing to your family?

599
00:51:29,936 --> 00:51:32,406
- Pardon me, Officer?
- You're still defending this guy?

600
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,475
- What are you fighting for him for?
- Okay, knock that off, Officer.

601
00:51:35,575 --> 00:51:38,612
I'll knock off nothing.
I was in the third wave at Omaha Beach.

602
00:51:38,712 --> 00:51:41,281
- I did my time in the service.
- ...and you're defending them?

603
00:51:41,381 --> 00:51:43,917
Why don't you just do your job
as an officer of the law?

604
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:47,320
- Okay, I'm sorry. Let's go outside. Come on.
- You know what? Just forget him.

605
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,605
- What am I not getting here?
- Outside, Officer!

606
00:51:50,705 --> 00:51:52,741
I'm sorry.

607
00:52:12,646 --> 00:52:15,407
Do you feel that you deserve this, sir?

608
00:52:37,337 --> 00:52:41,908
Should it become necessary to abandon
the aircraft over Soviet territory,

609
00:52:42,008 --> 00:52:46,680
then there's a two-and-a-half pound explosive
charge contained within the fuselage.

610
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:50,648
Now, first, you activate the circuits.

611
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:54,721
But to start the 70-second timer,

612
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:58,720
you need to flip the switch
marked "Destruct."

613
00:53:00,494 --> 00:53:04,764
It is imperative that these flights
remain a secret

614
00:53:04,864 --> 00:53:08,035
and this equipment does not fall
into enemy hands.

615
00:53:08,135 --> 00:53:09,903
What about us?

616
00:53:10,303 --> 00:53:14,332
I don't know if you're kidding,
Lieutenant Powers. I'm not.

617
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:21,009
What you know about the plane
is as secret as the plane itself.

618
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,341
If capture is a foregone conclusion...

619
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,454
you go down with your plane.

620
00:53:27,654 --> 00:53:30,390
Now, if you think you can ditch
and get away,

621
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:34,323
if you're close enough to a border, fine.
You know the ejection protocol.

622
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,732
But if you ditch...

623
00:53:38,832 --> 00:53:40,967
you bring the dollar with you.

624
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:43,499
All right, there's a pin inside.

625
00:53:45,339 --> 00:53:48,708
You scratch your skin anywhere,
it's instantaneous.

626
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,711
If you think you are about to be captured,

627
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,975
you use it.

628
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:00,021
Drivers, you understand me?

629
00:54:00,554 --> 00:54:02,279
Spend the dollar.

630
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,312
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the court.

631
00:54:59,412 --> 00:55:02,982
The "Cold War" is not just a phrase,
Your Honor.

632
00:55:03,082 --> 00:55:05,352
It's not just a figure of speech.

633
00:55:05,452 --> 00:55:11,358
Truly, a battle is being fought between
two competing views of the world.

634
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:14,928
I contend that Rudolf Ivanovich Abel,

635
00:55:15,028 --> 00:55:19,232
"Colonel Abel," as he was called
even by the men who arrested him,

636
00:55:19,332 --> 00:55:22,396
is our foe in that battle.

637
00:55:22,702 --> 00:55:26,072
- Auxiliary power?
- Connected and on.

638
00:55:26,172 --> 00:55:29,909
- Oxygen seat-pack supply?
- Supply at 1,800 psi.

639
00:55:30,009 --> 00:55:32,879
- Inverter?
- On, light out.

640
00:55:32,979 --> 00:55:36,082
He was treated as a combatant in that war

641
00:55:36,182 --> 00:55:40,286
until it no longer suited
our government to so treat him.

642
00:55:40,386 --> 00:55:46,059
Accordingly... he was not given
the protections we give our own citizens.

643
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:50,130
He was subjected to treatment that,
however appropriate for a suspected enemy,

644
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:53,162
was not appropriate
to a suspected criminal.

645
00:55:53,262 --> 00:55:55,302
- Fuel transfer?
- Transfer switch off.

646
00:55:55,402 --> 00:55:57,804
- Destructor?
- Destructor safety.

647
00:55:57,904 --> 00:56:00,636
- Climb data card.
- Installed in aircraft.

648
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,323
I know this man.

649
00:56:16,423 --> 00:56:20,160
If the charge is true, he serves a foreign
power but he serves it faithfully.

650
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:24,331
If he is a soldier in the opposing army,
he is a good soldier.

651
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:27,300
He has not fled the field
of battle to save himself.

652
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,238
He has refused to serve his captor.
He has refused to betray his cause.

653
00:56:32,338 --> 00:56:34,641
He has refused
to take the coward's way out.

654
00:56:34,741 --> 00:56:39,145
The coward must abandon his dignity
before he abandons the field of battle.

655
00:56:39,245 --> 00:56:42,315
That, Rudolf Abel will never do.

656
00:56:42,415 --> 00:56:46,253
Shouldn't we, by giving him
the full benefit of the rights

657
00:56:46,353 --> 00:56:51,274
that define our system of government,
show this man who we are?

658
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,660
Who we are.

659
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,264
Is that not the greatest weapon
we have in this Cold War?

660
00:56:58,364 --> 00:57:03,378
Will we stand by our cause less
resolutely than he stands by his?

661
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:50,413
<i>The President announced that a NASA
weather plane disappeared</i>

662
00:59:50,513 --> 00:59:52,572
<i>four days ago north of Turkey.</i>

663
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:56,976
<i>And the Space Administration fears
that its pilot died in the crash.</i>

664
00:59:57,076 --> 01:00:01,701
<i>Radar showed the plane wandering
off course deep into Soviet territory</i>

665
01:00:01,801 --> 01:00:03,750
<i>before contact was lost,</i>

666
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:08,087
<i>complicating any effort to recover it
or the remains of the pilot.</i>

667
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,356
<i>Now to news out of Washington.</i>

668
01:00:10,456 --> 01:00:12,693
<i>In a close vote today, the Supreme Court</i>

669
01:00:12,793 --> 01:00:16,796
<i>affirmed the conviction
of Russian spy Rudolf Ivanovich Abel,</i>

670
01:00:16,896 --> 01:00:18,565
<i>five votes to four.</i>

671
01:00:18,665 --> 01:00:22,749
<i>The case presented civil liberties issues,
according to the Russian's lawyer,</i>

672
01:00:22,849 --> 01:00:24,438
<i>James B. Donovan.</i>

673
01:00:24,938 --> 01:00:27,140
<i>When asked how he felt about today's loss,</i>

674
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,844
<i>Mr. Donovan simply said, "Tired."</i>

675
01:00:30,944 --> 01:00:34,813
<i>I'll have more news for you
after this message.</i>

676
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,475
It's over.

677
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,990
Marty.

678
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:46,693
I'll be damned if I can find
the file on that Prudential case.

679
01:00:46,793 --> 01:00:50,396
I... Mr. Watters had me move it
over to Jack Elwes's office

680
01:00:50,496 --> 01:00:53,266
- along with the first draft of the appeal.
- He did?

681
01:00:53,366 --> 01:00:57,932
Yeah, he redrafted and filed that
last week while you were in Washington.

682
01:00:59,673 --> 01:01:03,576
How long have we been together?
You act as if I've never closed a deal.

683
01:01:03,676 --> 01:01:06,513
Set up a meeting. Someplace fancy.

684
01:01:06,613 --> 01:01:10,483
I'm betting Mr. Young would like some
of the finer things New York has to offer.

685
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,448
And I want you to give me the summary...

686
01:01:31,037 --> 01:01:32,906
Do you know anyone from Leipzig?

687
01:01:33,006 --> 01:01:37,510
"Leipzig." Am I getting hate mail
from Germany now?

688
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,175
From East Germany.

689
01:01:48,087 --> 01:01:49,989
Is it your wife?

690
01:01:50,089 --> 01:01:52,058
No.

691
01:01:52,158 --> 01:01:53,993
No, no, no, no.

692
01:01:54,193 --> 01:01:58,832
She pretends to be
but it's not even a good pretense.

693
01:01:59,432 --> 01:02:04,270
"I'm taking this liberty to write to you
after having learned from the newspapers

694
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:09,632
"about your most humane attitude
towards my beloved husband,

695
01:02:09,732 --> 01:02:12,045
"Rudolf Abel."

696
01:02:12,445 --> 01:02:15,810
And do I write back?

697
01:02:17,584 --> 01:02:20,134
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

698
01:02:22,722 --> 01:02:26,568
What's the next move
when you don't know what the game is?

699
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:30,759
<i>Francis Gary Powers...</i>

700
01:02:31,397 --> 01:02:36,503
On the strength of Article Two
of the U.S.S.R. law

701
01:02:36,603 --> 01:02:40,406
on criminal responsibility
for state crimes

702
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:42,642
to 10 years of confinement

703
01:02:42,742 --> 01:02:46,607
with the first three years
to be served in prison.

704
01:02:47,714 --> 01:02:52,318
The term of the punishment,
including preliminary detention,

705
01:02:52,418 --> 01:02:54,821
shall be counted from May first,

706
01:02:54,921 --> 01:02:57,741
nineteen hundred and sixty.

707
01:03:22,582 --> 01:03:25,251
Mr. Donovan, thank you so much for coming.

708
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:27,854
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Dulles.

709
01:03:27,954 --> 01:03:30,323
It's an honor, sir.

710
01:03:30,423 --> 01:03:33,119
Nescafe, cream,

711
01:03:33,219 --> 01:03:34,703
two lumps.

712
01:03:34,803 --> 01:03:36,763
Thank you.

713
01:03:36,863 --> 01:03:38,965
Okay, this letter you received.

714
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:42,769
Seems pretty clear that the Soviets
are making an overture here.

715
01:03:42,869 --> 01:03:45,614
They're doing it through East Germany
'cause they still don't want to acknowledge

716
01:03:45,714 --> 01:03:50,104
Abel as a Soviet citizen,
much less a Soviet spy. So...

717
01:03:50,643 --> 01:03:54,447
- Lot of fiction going on.
- Yes, sir, but to what end?

718
01:03:54,547 --> 01:03:59,019
They got our guy, our spy pilot.
We've got their guy.

719
01:04:00,887 --> 01:04:04,490
Prisoner exchange, I think
that's what they're after.

720
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,759
Which could hardly be
a surprise to you, Counselor.

721
01:04:06,859 --> 01:04:09,588
It's an eventuality
that I think you foresaw.

722
01:04:09,688 --> 01:04:13,172
Yes, I sure did, and I'm so rarely right.

723
01:04:13,272 --> 01:04:16,369
Well, congratulations. Red letter day.

724
01:04:16,469 --> 01:04:18,000
Now...

725
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,407
we have our man over there. Powers.

726
01:04:20,507 --> 01:04:24,443
Good man, but with a head
full of classified information.

727
01:04:24,543 --> 01:04:27,207
Abel has a head full
of classified information, too,

728
01:04:27,307 --> 01:04:30,650
- but he hasn't given us a lick.
- And, sir, take it from me, he won't.

729
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:33,352
Yes, we know that, but the Russians don't.

730
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,875
They want their man back before he cracks.

731
01:04:36,155 --> 01:04:40,459
And we want Powers back
for the same reasons.

732
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:47,400
I think you are saying, sir, that there
might be a happy ending for everyone.

733
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,688
Yes, if we... indulge their fiction.

734
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:00,613
We want you to negotiate the swap

735
01:05:00,713 --> 01:05:04,567
because you're a private citizen,
so it's not governments talking.

736
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,703
They don't acknowledge Abel
as a Soviet citizen,

737
01:05:06,803 --> 01:05:10,557
and we don't acknowledge East Germany
as a sovereign country.

738
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:14,827
We haven't recognized East Berlin since
it was annexed by the Soviets in '45.

739
01:05:14,927 --> 01:05:17,964
So I act as a negotiator, representing...

740
01:05:18,064 --> 01:05:20,900
You're not representing anybody.
Not a government official.

741
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,302
You have no official standing.

742
01:05:23,402 --> 01:05:26,522
- So, some fiction on our side as well.
- Correct.

743
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:30,076
Which means, of course, you can't
rely on any acknowledgment

744
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,779
or help if things go south.

745
01:05:32,879 --> 01:05:37,178
CIA can't be responsible.
We can't be embarrassed.

746
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,587
Where do they want this negotiation
to take place?

747
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:44,123
- There.
- "There"?

748
01:05:44,423 --> 01:05:46,687
East Berlin.

749
01:05:47,794 --> 01:05:50,246
Well, isn't East Berlin getting rather...

750
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:53,694
Oh, yes, the place is getting complicated.

751
01:05:54,433 --> 01:05:56,830
Yeah, complicated.

752
01:05:58,504 --> 01:06:01,741
The Soviet side has been setting up
checkpoints for the past few months

753
01:06:01,841 --> 01:06:05,745
to try to stop people hemorrhaging to the
Western sectors, and it hasn't worked.

754
01:06:06,145 --> 01:06:09,949
We have intelligence to suggest
that they may go one step further

755
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:13,647
and wall off the entire Eastern sector.

756
01:06:18,024 --> 01:06:20,443
Okay, that's it in a nutshell.

757
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,095
The decision is entirely yours.

758
01:06:23,195 --> 01:06:26,926
You need time to kick it around.

759
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,207
No.

760
01:06:34,607 --> 01:06:38,677
- No, I don't.
- Well, fine. Fine.

761
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:43,553
Best that this all remains confidential.
Let's not discuss any of this with...

762
01:06:43,653 --> 01:06:46,185
Mary or with anyone else.

763
01:06:46,285 --> 01:06:50,223
Share the correspondence only with us.
Let us know what they want to do and when.

764
01:06:50,323 --> 01:06:52,992
I've got no client, no wife, no country.

765
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:56,395
Don't know what I'm doing
or when or who for.

766
01:06:56,495 --> 01:06:59,899
You're doing it for your country,
but your country doesn't know that yet.

767
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:03,036
What about my client, the other person
in this equation? My guy?

768
01:07:03,136 --> 01:07:06,739
Your guy? You mean the Russian?
He's not your guy anymore, Counselor.

769
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:10,109
Your guy is Francis Gary Powers now.

770
01:07:10,209 --> 01:07:13,129
What do I tell Rudolf Abel?

771
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,676
Tell him not to drop dead.

772
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,623
Professor?

773
01:09:14,633 --> 01:09:16,435
Professor?

774
01:09:16,535 --> 01:09:20,539
Papa went to university.
You shouldn't be here, Frederic.

775
01:09:20,639 --> 01:09:25,110
- They're having classes today?
- He went to see. That's where he goes.

776
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:28,147
- What are you doing here?
- I came to get you and your father.

777
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:30,413
You have to come with me.
You might not get out tomorrow.

778
01:09:30,513 --> 01:09:34,178
- Just... just leave?
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes, leave. Right now.

779
01:10:05,547 --> 01:10:07,750
Go back. Go back.

780
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:10,019
I'll be okay, I'm American. Go back.

781
01:10:10,119 --> 01:10:13,551
Go back to your father's.
We'll find another way. Go.

782
01:10:18,394 --> 01:10:21,463
- Hey!
- So, hi.

783
01:10:24,783 --> 01:10:29,171
- Papers, please.
- <i>Ich bin Student</i> Frederic Pryor.

784
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:32,202
Yes, <i>student.</i>

785
01:10:41,784 --> 01:10:45,316
My name's Frederic Pryor.
I'm an economics student.

786
01:10:46,222 --> 01:10:51,183
See? It's my dissertation. My thesis.

787
01:10:52,595 --> 01:10:54,296
You see? Look, look.

788
01:10:54,396 --> 01:10:58,476
"The foreign trade system of
the European Communist nations."

789
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:04,709
It was a lot of work.

790
01:11:12,014 --> 01:11:14,343
No, that's my only copy.

791
01:11:16,084 --> 01:11:18,059
No!

792
01:11:19,705 --> 01:11:21,140
Tell me something.

793
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:25,728
It came up at the last minute.
They have offices in London.

794
01:11:25,828 --> 01:11:28,861
These clients. Not my idea.

795
01:11:28,961 --> 01:11:31,400
Scotland, this fishing expedition.

796
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,968
- What kind of fishing trip, Jim?
- Salmon fishing.

797
01:11:36,305 --> 01:11:38,374
Just tell me that you're
not gonna be in any danger,

798
01:11:38,474 --> 01:11:42,178
that this is just a routine
business trip, and I won't worry.

799
01:11:42,278 --> 01:11:44,624
I need my passport.

800
01:11:48,634 --> 01:11:52,963
Just give me something to hold on to.
I don't even care if it's the truth.

801
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:56,587
I'm doing this for us.

802
01:12:19,114 --> 01:12:23,752
Mr. Michener, here, is your Berlin escort.
He's an attache with the U.S. embassy.

803
01:12:23,852 --> 01:12:26,088
So, it's gotten goddamn complicated.

804
01:12:26,188 --> 01:12:29,393
As you know, the last letter from Mrs.
Abel, whoever she is, talks about a lawyer

805
01:12:29,493 --> 01:12:32,428
in East Berlin, Mr. Vogel, whoever he is,
representing her interests, she says.

806
01:12:32,528 --> 01:12:35,864
Yeah, Vogel says he's gone
to the Russian embassy in East Berlin

807
01:12:35,964 --> 01:12:39,034
and they may be ready
to trade Abel for Powers.

808
01:12:39,134 --> 01:12:41,637
But no one knows who's who,
but essentially they're all Russian, right?

809
01:12:41,737 --> 01:12:44,273
- Well, Soviet.
- Well, we think so.

810
01:12:44,373 --> 01:12:46,938
What do you mean?
Could we turn up the heat in here?

811
01:12:47,038 --> 01:12:48,579
No, it's...

812
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:53,082
There's a wrinkle.
They might try to throw you a curveball.

813
01:12:53,182 --> 01:12:56,285
Try and get you to accept
another prisoner other than Powers.

814
01:12:56,385 --> 01:12:57,753
Another American?

815
01:12:58,153 --> 01:13:02,157
The... East German Stasi picked up
an American student. Frederic Pryor.

816
01:13:02,257 --> 01:13:04,760
The kid they found
on the wrong side of the Wall.

817
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,231
He's a grad student out of Yale.
Came over here to study economics.

818
01:13:08,331 --> 01:13:12,401
So, they're making noises
about trying this kid for espionage.

819
01:13:12,501 --> 01:13:15,220
Grave offense, capital crime. Well.

820
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:19,742
Vogel got in touch with us,
said he represents Pryor.

821
01:13:19,842 --> 01:13:24,913
Wait a minute. Vogel represents
Mrs. Abel and this... this kid?

822
01:13:25,113 --> 01:13:27,316
Yeah, he's busy.

823
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:31,236
Well, so, what is he? Vogel, is he...
East German or is he Russian?

824
01:13:31,337 --> 01:13:33,489
Well, try to figure it out
when you meet him.

825
01:13:33,589 --> 01:13:35,941
At Russian embassy,
East Berlin, noon tomorrow.

826
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:38,427
Hoffman will show you how to get there.

827
01:13:38,527 --> 01:13:42,598
Wait, show me how to get there?
I'm gonna have an escort. Right?

828
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:46,074
Well, that was the plan but, like I said,
there's a wrinkle. I won't be taking you.

829
01:13:46,174 --> 01:13:49,409
Decision's been made. No U.S. government
personnel are to cross the border

830
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:50,930
- until further notice.
- How come?

831
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:53,459
It's too dangerous.
Yeah, the East Germans grabbed this kid.

832
01:13:53,559 --> 01:13:56,729
There's a degree of impunity
that we had not anticipated.

833
01:13:57,279 --> 01:14:00,682
The point is that the East German agenda
and the Russian agenda

834
01:14:00,782 --> 01:14:02,117
may not be the same thing.

835
01:14:02,217 --> 01:14:05,904
Try and figure it out and act accordingly.
And try to make a deal. Powers for Abel.

836
01:14:06,004 --> 01:14:08,941
Well, what about this college kid, Pryor?

837
01:14:09,591 --> 01:14:11,377
Don't fall for that.

838
01:14:11,477 --> 01:14:14,257
We can get him out another time.
Powers is the whole ball game.

839
01:14:37,185 --> 01:14:39,488
Where's your room?

840
01:14:39,588 --> 01:14:42,019
I'll be staying at the Hilton.

841
01:14:43,091 --> 01:14:45,122
It's not far.

842
01:14:46,261 --> 01:14:48,564
This is a number here in West Berlin.

843
01:14:48,864 --> 01:14:51,461
Memorize it and give it back to me.

844
01:14:51,767 --> 01:14:54,197
No, no. I mean, now.

845
01:14:55,537 --> 01:14:59,842
The Soviets keep cutting the international
lines but local calls are okay.

846
01:15:00,142 --> 01:15:02,634
Someone will pick up day and night.

847
01:15:10,419 --> 01:15:13,530
Now, this docket attached
to your passport will serve

848
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:17,187
as your ticket into and out
of the Eastern Soviet sector.

849
01:15:17,893 --> 01:15:21,058
The meeting with Vogel
is set for noon tomorrow.

850
01:15:26,435 --> 01:15:28,220
There are only a few routes
left to the East.

851
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,756
You take the S-Bahn, the station
we showed you on the way in.

852
01:15:30,856 --> 01:15:33,108
You're gonna get off
at the Friedrichstrasse station here

853
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:36,144
and walk to the Soviet embassy
on Unter den Linden here.

854
01:15:36,244 --> 01:15:38,514
Look at the map now.
You shouldn't take it with you.

855
01:15:38,614 --> 01:15:42,735
You're looking at a map, you're an American,
you're a spy. You could well be detained.

856
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:47,691
Just avoid interacting with people generally.
You don't belong, so don't stick out.

857
01:15:47,791 --> 01:15:50,192
Food is scarce over there
and things have started to fall apart.

858
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:54,430
There are gangs, and rule of law
is less firmly established over there.

859
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:56,465
And definitely stay away from the Wall.

860
01:15:56,565 --> 01:15:59,034
On their side, there's a line
cleared of buildings along the Wall.

861
01:15:59,134 --> 01:16:02,004
They call it the "Death Line."
Cross it and you'll be shot.

862
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:04,973
Is there any outcome here
where I'm not either detained or shot?

863
01:16:05,073 --> 01:16:07,409
Don't worry too much
about what Michener said.

864
01:16:07,509 --> 01:16:09,678
No, I'm worried about what you're saying.

865
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:13,448
This kid, Pryor, that the East
Germans have, how old is he?

866
01:16:13,548 --> 01:16:17,794
- Twenty-five. Why?
- Same age as Dougie.

867
01:16:19,287 --> 01:16:22,912
- Who?
- An associate of mine.

868
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,793
Frederic Pryor.

869
01:18:02,991 --> 01:18:05,322
Okay, okay, okay.

870
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:54,112
<i>Danke.</i>

871
01:19:50,032 --> 01:19:53,798
So, we apologize...

872
01:19:53,898 --> 01:19:56,751
if this offends.

873
01:20:02,843 --> 01:20:04,707
Coat?

874
01:20:22,764 --> 01:20:24,561
Okay.

875
01:21:16,652 --> 01:21:19,671
- Do you understand English?
- Yes, sir.

876
01:21:19,771 --> 01:21:22,057
I'm James Donovan.
I'm here to meet a Mr. Vogel.

877
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:24,092
- Mr. Vogel.
- He doesn't work here.

878
01:21:24,192 --> 01:21:27,012
I'm just supposed to meet him.
That's all I know.

879
01:21:49,884 --> 01:21:51,987
Mr. Donovan!

880
01:21:52,087 --> 01:21:54,617
So we finally meet you.

881
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:58,593
- I'm Helen Abel. How is our husband?
- Oh. He's fine.

882
01:21:58,693 --> 01:22:01,863
- How is my Rudolf?
- As good as can be expected.

883
01:22:01,963 --> 01:22:04,499
And we will get him back, yes?

884
01:22:04,599 --> 01:22:07,435
- This is our daughter.
- How do you do?

885
01:22:07,535 --> 01:22:08,870
Lydia.

886
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:11,106
Are you Mr. Vogel?

887
01:22:11,206 --> 01:22:14,282
No, no, no! I'm not Vogel.

888
01:22:14,482 --> 01:22:16,706
I'm cousin Drews.

889
01:22:17,445 --> 01:22:20,323
- This is Rudolf's beloved cousin Drews.
- Yes, cousin Drews.

890
01:22:20,423 --> 01:22:23,218
- I am cousin Drews.
- Cousin Drews, yes.

891
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:25,848
I'm Helen Abel.

892
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:30,353
When will you see him?

893
01:22:31,226 --> 01:22:33,261
When will your government release him?

894
01:22:33,361 --> 01:22:37,165
Well, I'm a little... lost here.
I'm supposed to meet a Mr. Vogel.

895
01:22:37,265 --> 01:22:39,301
Oh, Mr. Vogel is our lawyer.

896
01:22:39,401 --> 01:22:43,171
So we were supposed to negotiate,
the exchange.

897
01:22:43,271 --> 01:22:45,974
- To bring Rudolf here?
- Yes, yes, to bring him here.

898
01:22:46,074 --> 01:22:48,744
But it doesn't happen unilaterally,
do you understand?

899
01:22:48,844 --> 01:22:51,865
It has to be an exchange.

900
01:22:54,182 --> 01:22:55,646
Not here?

901
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:18,523
- Mr. Donovan?
- Mr. Vogel.

902
01:23:18,623 --> 01:23:22,544
No, no, no. Goodness.
My name is Schischkin. Ivan Schischkin.

903
01:23:22,644 --> 01:23:25,980
I'm the second secretary
of the Soviet embassy.

904
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,984
It wouldn't be appropriate
for Mr. Vogel to join us.

905
01:23:29,084 --> 01:23:31,286
He is a German national.

906
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:33,521
So you aren't here to...

907
01:23:33,621 --> 01:23:37,125
To facilitate this meeting.

908
01:23:38,117 --> 01:23:42,330
Perhaps Mrs. Abel would like
to compose herself privately?

909
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:46,314
And let Mr. Donovan and myself to talk?

910
01:23:47,802 --> 01:23:49,882
Thank you.

911
01:23:58,513 --> 01:24:01,149
- So, I'm confused.
- Yes.

912
01:24:01,249 --> 01:24:05,921
I don't care who I talk to
if it's about an exchange of personnel.

913
01:24:06,021 --> 01:24:09,754
- Are you the person to talk to?
- Yes, yes, yes, of course.

914
01:24:09,854 --> 01:24:14,447
We should talk.
Please, have a seat, Mr. Donovan.

915
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:17,065
How did you arrive to the Eastern sector?

916
01:24:17,165 --> 01:24:20,168
- The train. The S-Bahn.
- And you were alone?

917
01:24:20,268 --> 01:24:21,736
Yeah.

918
01:24:21,836 --> 01:24:24,940
And you are credentialed?

919
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:28,676
Now, you must know about me, sir.
I'm a private citizen.

920
01:24:28,776 --> 01:24:30,778
I'm a lawyer in Brooklyn
in the United States,

921
01:24:30,878 --> 01:24:35,851
and I've taken time out of my busy
schedule to help my client, Rudolf Abel.

922
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:39,147
I'm authorized to arrange an exchange

923
01:24:39,247 --> 01:24:42,690
of Abel for Francis Gary Powers.

924
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:46,106
This is a full pardon of Abel
that will be signed

925
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:48,930
when the exchange actually takes place.

926
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:50,432
This is the only reason I'm here.

927
01:24:50,532 --> 01:24:54,469
I hope and expect to make
this arrangement quickly.

928
01:24:54,569 --> 01:24:57,900
Abel for Francis Gary Powers...

929
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:01,171
and Frederic Pryor.

930
01:25:02,818 --> 01:25:07,244
- We don't have Pryor.
- No? You don't?

931
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:11,453
I've heard of Pryor, but he's held

932
01:25:11,553 --> 01:25:14,422
by the German Democratic Republic,

933
01:25:14,522 --> 01:25:18,293
not by the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

934
01:25:18,393 --> 01:25:21,196
Well, I'll tell you the first problem.

935
01:25:21,296 --> 01:25:23,932
The names of your countries are too long.

936
01:25:26,081 --> 01:25:28,293
Yes, yes.

937
01:25:28,603 --> 01:25:30,591
If we release Powers,

938
01:25:30,691 --> 01:25:34,738
it is only to promote a goodwill
between our countries.

939
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:39,076
So, it cannot be an exchange.

940
01:25:41,382 --> 01:25:45,320
Perhaps... Perhaps you could release Abel

941
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:48,873
as a token of goodwill
to our friends in Germany, and then,

942
01:25:48,973 --> 01:25:53,247
some months later, we would release
Powers. There is an idea.

943
01:25:53,347 --> 01:25:57,612
No. That just won't work for us at all.
See, we need this to be an exchange.

944
01:25:57,712 --> 01:26:00,902
You can call it what you want,
but an exchange it must be.

945
01:26:01,002 --> 01:26:04,172
We can have Abel here within 48 hours.

946
01:26:04,272 --> 01:26:08,958
We need Powers at the same time
we give you Abel.

947
01:26:10,844 --> 01:26:12,547
This is...

948
01:26:12,647 --> 01:26:16,163
Can we call this the "impatient plan"?

949
01:26:16,584 --> 01:26:19,427
Well, you can call it whatever you want.

950
01:26:20,488 --> 01:26:24,459
I can relay your impatient plan
to Moscow, see what they say...

951
01:26:24,559 --> 01:26:28,997
But they will wonder why so impatient.

952
01:26:29,097 --> 01:26:33,501
Because I have a cold. And I don't
live in Berlin and I want to go home.

953
01:26:33,601 --> 01:26:36,944
They will think, "Well, the Americans...

954
01:26:37,044 --> 01:26:40,575
"must have gotten all the information
that Abel had to give.

955
01:26:40,675 --> 01:26:44,112
"And now they're impatient to trade him,

956
01:26:44,212 --> 01:26:47,382
"hoping to get in return this man, Powers,

957
01:26:47,482 --> 01:26:52,748
"that, perhaps, has not yet given up
all the information that he has to give."

958
01:26:53,188 --> 01:26:56,454
This is not an equitable trade, sir.

959
01:26:56,991 --> 01:27:00,595
But what you're saying is, if Powers
has given up everything he knows,

960
01:27:00,695 --> 01:27:02,864
then Moscow would trade?

961
01:27:02,964 --> 01:27:05,400
Why wouldn't they?

962
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,470
As for Abel, if he dies
in an American prison,

963
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:11,732
the next Russian operative
who gets caught might think twice

964
01:27:11,832 --> 01:27:14,153
about keeping his mouth shut.
And you never know.

965
01:27:14,253 --> 01:27:18,013
Abel might want to see the sky again.

966
01:27:18,713 --> 01:27:23,045
And decide to trade Russian secrets
for small American favors.

967
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:27,789
How can we know this?

968
01:27:27,889 --> 01:27:31,292
We little men, we just do our jobs.

969
01:27:31,392 --> 01:27:34,464
Like Lieutenant Powers. He's just a pilot.

970
01:27:36,664 --> 01:27:38,697
He was making photographs

971
01:27:38,797 --> 01:27:41,998
from 70,000 feet
when he was shot from the sky.

972
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:44,972
People in my country consider this...

973
01:27:45,372 --> 01:27:47,042
an act of war.

974
01:27:49,043 --> 01:27:51,746
We have to get off
this merry-go-round, sir.

975
01:27:51,846 --> 01:27:56,003
The next mistake our countries make
could be the last one.

976
01:27:56,317 --> 01:28:01,325
We need to have the conversation
our governments can't.

977
01:28:05,927 --> 01:28:08,279
I will ask Moscow.

978
01:28:08,379 --> 01:28:11,243
Who knows what they will say.

979
01:28:12,233 --> 01:28:15,754
There are a lot of people, Mr. Donovan,
who doesn't want this...

980
01:28:15,854 --> 01:28:19,066
exchange to ever take place.

981
01:28:20,842 --> 01:28:24,012
Can you come back tomorrow
to discuss their answer?

982
01:28:24,112 --> 01:28:26,948
- Powers for Abel.
- And Frederic Pryor.

983
01:28:27,048 --> 01:28:31,254
As I said, Pryor is in the hands
of the organs of State Security

984
01:28:31,354 --> 01:28:35,923
- of the German Democratic Republic.
- I'm confident you can make arrangements.

985
01:28:36,023 --> 01:28:39,494
I am merely a secretary
in the embassy of foreign power.

986
01:28:39,594 --> 01:28:40,762
Okay.

987
01:28:40,862 --> 01:28:44,499
You have to see Mr. Vogel.
I'll give you his address.

988
01:28:44,599 --> 01:28:49,070
- There actually is a Mr. Vogel?
- Why would you imagine otherwise?

989
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:51,973
It's a short cab ride.

990
01:28:52,073 --> 01:28:54,842
And please, Mr. Donovan,

991
01:28:54,942 --> 01:28:57,774
wear an overcoat in this weather.

992
01:28:58,179 --> 01:29:00,877
I had mine stolen from me.

993
01:29:01,015 --> 01:29:05,448
What do you expect?
It was from Saks Fifth Avenue.

994
01:29:06,087 --> 01:29:08,184
Wasn't it?

995
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:18,366
- Mr. Donovan.
- Mr. Vogel.

996
01:29:18,466 --> 01:29:20,368
Please come in.

997
01:29:20,468 --> 01:29:22,065
<i>Danke.</i>

998
01:29:24,939 --> 01:29:27,152
Sorry about the embassy.

999
01:29:28,676 --> 01:29:31,509
But the Soviets decided not to host me.

1000
01:29:32,513 --> 01:29:34,149
Very irritating.

1001
01:29:34,249 --> 01:29:37,619
I am still trying to grasp each party's...

1002
01:29:37,719 --> 01:29:39,220
Status?

1003
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:43,427
Yes. And interest in the proceedings.

1004
01:29:43,658 --> 01:29:48,037
It's a new world.
All very disorienting, isn't it?

1005
01:29:58,172 --> 01:30:00,803
Let me tell you what I have to offer.

1006
01:30:02,677 --> 01:30:06,641
I'm a good friend... "Friend."
No, he's older.

1007
01:30:06,741 --> 01:30:11,052
"Protege"? Of the attorney general
of the German Democratic Republic.

1008
01:30:11,152 --> 01:30:13,449
Sit down, please.

1009
01:30:15,656 --> 01:30:19,494
This unfortunate, Frederic Pryor...

1010
01:30:19,594 --> 01:30:22,511
he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1011
01:30:22,611 --> 01:30:25,833
But every accident, properly viewed,

1012
01:30:25,933 --> 01:30:28,858
- is an opportunity, isn't it, Mr. Donovan?
- Well...

1013
01:30:28,958 --> 01:30:33,374
Your country refuses to recognize
the German Democratic Republic.

1014
01:30:33,474 --> 01:30:38,448
They prefer to make up stories that
the GDR doesn't exist, for instance.

1015
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:41,049
Sorry.

1016
01:30:41,549 --> 01:30:46,587
As a means of forcing your government's
recognition of this real place, sir,

1017
01:30:46,687 --> 01:30:50,091
in which you find yourself, the GDR,

1018
01:30:50,191 --> 01:30:52,393
the attorney general is happy
to negotiate with you

1019
01:30:52,493 --> 01:30:56,130
as a representative of your government
for Mr. Pryor's return.

1020
01:30:56,230 --> 01:31:00,463
Mr. Vogel, I'm not here as
a representative of my government.

1021
01:31:02,937 --> 01:31:05,001
All right.

1022
01:31:06,841 --> 01:31:09,043
I think that's childish, Mr. Donovan.

1023
01:31:09,143 --> 01:31:11,742
Well, I have no official status.

1024
01:31:11,842 --> 01:31:16,000
Fine. You do not represent the USA,
I do not represent the GDR.

1025
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:19,254
My client is Lydia Abel, Rudolf's wife.
And I have also...

1026
01:31:19,354 --> 01:31:23,035
Lydia is the daughter. Helen is the wife.

1027
01:31:27,862 --> 01:31:29,692
Well...

1028
01:31:30,465 --> 01:31:35,681
I am prepared to offer Frederic Pryor's
exchange for Rudolf Abel's.

1029
01:31:36,804 --> 01:31:40,074
Then let's be clear.
We will produce Rudolf Abel.

1030
01:31:40,174 --> 01:31:44,078
You will produce, at the same time,
the student, Pryor.

1031
01:31:44,178 --> 01:31:47,081
- At the same time?
- Absolutely.

1032
01:31:47,181 --> 01:31:52,748
The exchange on offer is a Russian
at the end of his life...

1033
01:31:54,055 --> 01:31:57,759
for an American student
at the start of his.

1034
01:32:03,464 --> 01:32:06,467
Schischkin? He's not an embassy secretary.

1035
01:32:06,567 --> 01:32:09,170
Ivan Schischkin is the KGB's
chief in western Europe.

1036
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:14,955
Well, whatever he is, he's relaying
our proposal to Moscow and...

1037
01:32:15,743 --> 01:32:19,598
they'll decide.
Could I borrow a coat? I lost mine.

1038
01:32:19,698 --> 01:32:24,175
- How did you lose your coat?
- You know, spy stuff.

1039
01:32:25,186 --> 01:32:28,423
- I'll get you another coat.
- Good, because...

1040
01:32:28,523 --> 01:32:31,692
So who is... who is this Vogel?

1041
01:32:31,792 --> 01:32:35,830
Him, we don't know. He might be
what you said he said he is.

1042
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:40,835
Friend of the attorney general. Just some
guy the GDR tapped to handle this.

1043
01:32:40,935 --> 01:32:45,340
Sounds like the East Germans
are fighting for a place at our table.

1044
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,409
The GDR gets Abel back for the Russians...

1045
01:32:48,509 --> 01:32:52,413
winning their respect and capturing
the headlines for their cause.

1046
01:32:52,513 --> 01:32:54,682
Which, of course,
puts East Germany on the map.

1047
01:32:54,782 --> 01:32:57,418
But we don't care about their map.

1048
01:32:57,518 --> 01:32:59,220
Stick with the Russians.

1049
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:01,400
Stick with the Russians.
It's Powers for Abel.

1050
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,826
So, does all this mean
this might actually happen?

1051
01:33:04,926 --> 01:33:06,728
Yeah, that's what you seem
to be telling me.

1052
01:33:07,028 --> 01:33:09,847
We'll put Abel on a plane,
he'll be here Friday.

1053
01:33:09,947 --> 01:33:11,933
So, if Schischkin gets the okay,

1054
01:33:12,033 --> 01:33:14,235
all that's left is the mechanics
of the trade.

1055
01:33:14,335 --> 01:33:17,339
- How we swap our guy for their guy.
- Our "guys."

1056
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:19,941
Two guys. Powers and Pryor.

1057
01:33:20,441 --> 01:33:23,311
No, now don't go bleeding heart on me.

1058
01:33:23,411 --> 01:33:25,947
Powers is the whole ball game.

1059
01:33:26,047 --> 01:33:29,584
Forget this Ivy League boy,
who obviously thought it was a good idea

1060
01:33:29,684 --> 01:33:34,754
to study Soviet economics in Berlin
in the middle of the Cold War.

1061
01:33:35,756 --> 01:33:38,131
Powers is who we need.

1062
01:33:38,231 --> 01:33:40,596
You don't even like Powers.

1063
01:33:41,295 --> 01:33:43,449
Everybody hates Powers.

1064
01:33:43,549 --> 01:33:48,135
He didn't kill himself and he let
the commies parade him on television.

1065
01:33:48,235 --> 01:33:50,405
He's the most hated man in America.

1066
01:33:50,505 --> 01:33:53,430
After Rudolf Abel, maybe.

1067
01:33:53,530 --> 01:33:55,486
And me.

1068
01:34:03,918 --> 01:34:06,334
Now wake up!

1069
01:34:14,028 --> 01:34:15,830
I gotta sleep.

1070
01:34:15,930 --> 01:34:18,227
I just gotta sleep.

1071
01:34:20,735 --> 01:34:24,105
I told you, you can sleep
once we talk what we need to talk.

1072
01:34:24,205 --> 01:34:26,674
You must focus on me.

1073
01:34:26,774 --> 01:34:30,511
Your government doesn't care about you.
You know that. Any of you.

1074
01:34:30,611 --> 01:34:34,015
You know that twelve U-2 pilots
incurred brain damage?

1075
01:34:34,115 --> 01:34:37,318
They're vegetables because
of altitude, insufficient oxygen.

1076
01:34:37,518 --> 01:34:41,622
But they keep you flying, Gary.
You and your friends.

1077
01:34:41,722 --> 01:34:45,559
They gave you this. A scratcher, yes?

1078
01:34:45,659 --> 01:34:47,879
Potassium cyanide.

1079
01:34:48,312 --> 01:34:51,248
Does that look like they care about you?

1080
01:35:20,294 --> 01:35:23,121
What is the construction
of the destructor unit?

1081
01:35:23,498 --> 01:35:25,566
By what means is this unit operated?

1082
01:35:25,766 --> 01:35:28,703
With what explosives is the unit charged,

1083
01:35:28,803 --> 01:35:31,405
and what destruction is it capable of?

1084
01:35:31,505 --> 01:35:35,583
I don't know. The pilots were never
shown any of the equipment.

1085
01:35:35,683 --> 01:35:38,145
How wide far can the radar

1086
01:35:38,245 --> 01:35:41,015
- map an area during an overflight?
- I don't know, I don't know!

1087
01:35:41,115 --> 01:35:44,919
Were you making
the overflight on April 9th

1088
01:35:45,019 --> 01:35:48,856
over the industrial area and MiG
bomber base at Baranovichi?

1089
01:35:48,956 --> 01:35:51,752
I was not. This was my first overflight.

1090
01:35:51,852 --> 01:35:56,163
I need to know about
engine-out to glide ratio.

1091
01:35:56,263 --> 01:35:59,133
How the plane gets so high.

1092
01:35:59,233 --> 01:36:03,905
We know it reaches altitude
of 70,000 feet.

1093
01:36:04,305 --> 01:36:08,609
Gary, we know this. And I need
to know where the planes have flown.

1094
01:36:08,709 --> 01:36:11,212
Where they have flown, Gary.

1095
01:36:11,312 --> 01:36:13,740
And we must have this talk now.

1096
01:36:16,183 --> 01:36:18,052
Now.

1097
01:36:18,152 --> 01:36:20,817
And then you can sleep a little.

1098
01:36:25,025 --> 01:36:27,435
Sir, wake up.

1099
01:36:28,462 --> 01:36:30,759
Wake up, sir.

1100
01:36:31,933 --> 01:36:34,035
- Sir, can you come with me, please?
- Yeah.

1101
01:36:34,135 --> 01:36:35,923
- We gotta move.
- Yeah, of course.

1102
01:36:36,023 --> 01:36:39,807
- Can you come with me, please? Okay.
- Yeah.

1103
01:36:40,107 --> 01:36:42,424
- Got your glasses?
- What time is it?

1104
01:36:42,524 --> 01:36:44,912
It's late, but we need to talk...

1105
01:36:45,012 --> 01:36:48,448
and then we need to get on a plane, okay?

1106
01:36:48,548 --> 01:36:50,850
- Yep. Upsy-daisy!
- Upsy-daisy.

1107
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:55,365
That's right. There we go.
Keep it moving. Thank you.

1108
01:36:57,058 --> 01:36:59,860
Other way, other way. There we go.

1109
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:02,830
- You say a plane?
- This way, please. Keep moving.

1110
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:05,802
So, I received a favorable decision

1111
01:37:05,902 --> 01:37:08,035
from Moscow on your proposal

1112
01:37:08,135 --> 01:37:11,272
that we help our friends in
the German Democratic Republic...

1113
01:37:11,672 --> 01:37:16,326
by exchanging Mr. Powers for Mr. Abel.

1114
01:37:17,244 --> 01:37:18,512
That's swell.

1115
01:37:18,612 --> 01:37:22,817
May I suggest the Glienicke Bridge
as a place of a swap?

1116
01:37:22,917 --> 01:37:26,821
- Why not Checkpoint Charlie?
- We're not looking for publicity.

1117
01:37:26,921 --> 01:37:30,291
The Glienicke Bridge is very quiet,
especially early in the morning.

1118
01:37:30,391 --> 01:37:32,994
Glienicke Bridge.
I'll run that by our side.

1119
01:37:33,094 --> 01:37:36,730
We can have Abel here on Friday.
So, Saturday morning?

1120
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:39,967
- Always impatience, yeah?
- I want to get home and get into bed.

1121
01:37:40,067 --> 01:37:42,269
So, Saturday morning?

1122
01:37:42,369 --> 01:37:45,539
- 5:30?
- All right.

1123
01:37:45,639 --> 01:37:48,542
We're done here. This is a number...

1124
01:37:48,642 --> 01:37:51,912
in case anything should come up.

1125
01:37:52,012 --> 01:37:55,783
- All right.
- Someone will answer at any hour.

1126
01:37:56,083 --> 01:37:58,580
I don't expect to use it.

1127
01:37:59,086 --> 01:38:01,622
Shall we toast the arrangement?

1128
01:38:02,044 --> 01:38:03,953
Why not?

1129
01:38:04,658 --> 01:38:06,980
Armenian brandy.
Good bracer for your cold.

1130
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:08,966
Thank you.

1131
01:38:09,066 --> 01:38:10,297
Would you mind...

1132
01:38:10,397 --> 01:38:13,044
This is not part of our business but...

1133
01:38:13,144 --> 01:38:15,870
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
You do not have to answer.

1134
01:38:15,970 --> 01:38:18,372
I shall answer what I know.

1135
01:38:18,472 --> 01:38:21,442
I like this guy, your guy.

1136
01:38:21,542 --> 01:38:24,378
What happens to your guy
when he gets home?

1137
01:38:24,478 --> 01:38:29,116
Well, we have to make a determination
whether our guy is now your guy.

1138
01:38:29,216 --> 01:38:33,754
Now, as I said to you before, he's acted
honorably. He's still your guy, believe me.

1139
01:38:33,854 --> 01:38:36,957
Of course you will say that
if it were true...

1140
01:38:37,057 --> 01:38:39,193
and if it were not true.

1141
01:38:39,293 --> 01:38:41,595
I guess it has come down to that?

1142
01:38:41,695 --> 01:38:44,521
Well, forgive me for pushing, but...

1143
01:38:44,621 --> 01:38:48,435
is he in any danger
if the determination is made?

1144
01:38:48,535 --> 01:38:50,805
Well, goodness.

1145
01:38:50,905 --> 01:38:53,707
As things are now, everyone is in danger.

1146
01:38:53,807 --> 01:38:56,783
- Cheers.
- <i>Na zdorovie.</i>

1147
01:39:09,123 --> 01:39:12,259
There will be no exchange
on Glienicke Bridge.

1148
01:39:12,359 --> 01:39:14,228
Excuse me, sir.

1149
01:39:14,328 --> 01:39:17,231
There will be no exchange.

1150
01:39:17,331 --> 01:39:18,833
Not for Frederic Pryor.

1151
01:39:18,933 --> 01:39:21,919
Mr. Vogel, I thought yesterday
we had agreed.

1152
01:39:22,019 --> 01:39:24,801
We agreed on an exchange, Abel for Pryor.

1153
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:29,310
Now I learn you are a rug merchant

1154
01:39:29,410 --> 01:39:32,213
selling the same rug to two customers.

1155
01:39:32,313 --> 01:39:34,915
- Abel for Pryor you sell to us.
- Yeah.

1156
01:39:35,015 --> 01:39:37,351
And Abel for Powers
you sell to the Soviets.

1157
01:39:37,451 --> 01:39:39,817
I'm not quite sure what the problem is

1158
01:39:39,917 --> 01:39:43,348
if the arrangement satisfies
two parties or three or four.

1159
01:39:43,448 --> 01:39:47,354
- What difference does it make?
- The arrangement does not satisfy this party.

1160
01:39:51,365 --> 01:39:52,546
Now, Mr. Vogel, please...

1161
01:39:52,646 --> 01:39:56,165
Obviously you do not know
who you are dealing with.

1162
01:39:57,388 --> 01:40:00,876
Here's the interest of the German
Democratic Republic.

1163
01:40:01,375 --> 01:40:05,412
To deal with, and to be seen to be dealing
with another sovereign power,

1164
01:40:05,512 --> 01:40:09,183
the United States. An equal power.

1165
01:40:09,283 --> 01:40:12,486
Instead you treat us as stooges
for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

1166
01:40:12,586 --> 01:40:15,848
Can we just call them the Russians?
It'll save time.

1167
01:40:16,757 --> 01:40:19,861
I have an appointment, sir.
I think it's you who are wasting time.

1168
01:40:19,961 --> 01:40:23,848
Now, tell me if I am describing this wrong.
You have a kid, a university student.

1169
01:40:23,998 --> 01:40:26,801
Someone you know is not a spy,
who's no threat to you.

1170
01:40:26,901 --> 01:40:30,037
And in exchange for this person
who is worthless to you,

1171
01:40:30,237 --> 01:40:34,441
you play an equal part in an exchange
between the Russians and the Americans.

1172
01:40:34,541 --> 01:40:38,879
And this is one transaction
between us and the two of you.

1173
01:40:38,979 --> 01:40:42,483
We're not trying to do two things here, sir.
We're just doing one thing. One, one, one.

1174
01:40:42,583 --> 01:40:47,288
It's hard for me to see how the Republic of
East German Democrats is being slighted.

1175
01:40:47,388 --> 01:40:50,291
You agreed with the Soviets
without consulting me.

1176
01:40:50,391 --> 01:40:53,162
- Is this a negotiation or a conspiracy?
- For it to be a conspiracy,

1177
01:40:53,262 --> 01:40:55,755
there would have to be harm to you.
There's just benefits here.

1178
01:40:55,855 --> 01:40:59,801
- We're of agreeing interests.
- No, you decide they agree.

1179
01:41:00,401 --> 01:41:03,604
- Where is your appointment, sir?
- In the West. Ku'damm.

1180
01:41:03,704 --> 01:41:05,434
Good.

1181
01:41:15,849 --> 01:41:20,128
Look around you. How does the Eastern
sector compare with the West?

1182
01:41:22,389 --> 01:41:26,793
Our Russian friends have decided that
we should not rebuild our capital city.

1183
01:41:28,595 --> 01:41:31,872
But we live in this ruin
made by our Russian friends.

1184
01:41:31,972 --> 01:41:35,432
Go ahead, make your deal with
these Russians. We won't be part of it.

1185
01:41:37,604 --> 01:41:39,940
There is no deal without Pryor.
We're not leaving him here.

1186
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:45,429
- Is this your position or your government's?
- Sir, I'm here. I'm talking to you.

1187
01:41:45,529 --> 01:41:48,726
But you are not a representative of your
government. You don't know who you are.

1188
01:41:48,826 --> 01:41:52,882
Neither do we. You should be careful.
This is not Brooklyn, Mr. Donovan.

1189
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:03,564
Look, sir. You must know
that in every respect that matters,

1190
01:42:03,664 --> 01:42:07,252
I represent my government.
You know who I am.

1191
01:42:08,352 --> 01:42:09,335
Do I?

1192
01:42:31,625 --> 01:42:33,894
Do you have the proper papers?

1193
01:42:33,994 --> 01:42:36,997
Of course not. It doesn't matter.

1194
01:42:37,097 --> 01:42:40,200
An American lawyer like you
can talk your way out of anything.

1195
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:42,298
Can't you?

1196
01:43:24,311 --> 01:43:26,972
- You go with him.
- Why?

1197
01:43:27,072 --> 01:43:30,317
- It's passport problem.
- What problem? What's the problem?

1198
01:43:30,417 --> 01:43:32,614
You go with him.

1199
01:43:34,521 --> 01:43:38,846
And remember, we control
the fate of Frederic Pryor.

1200
01:45:22,529 --> 01:45:24,606
My God!

1201
01:45:59,099 --> 01:46:01,468
Yeah, I'll start with some coffee, please.

1202
01:46:01,568 --> 01:46:05,539
Then I'll have the Hilton combo
and the American breakfast.

1203
01:46:05,639 --> 01:46:08,174
- And coffee.
- Both breakfasts?

1204
01:46:08,274 --> 01:46:10,477
- Yeah, yeah.
- One first or...

1205
01:46:10,577 --> 01:46:14,885
Both first, both.
Whenever they're ready. And coffee.

1206
01:46:32,165 --> 01:46:33,867
You shouldn't be here.

1207
01:46:33,967 --> 01:46:37,884
Well, sometimes in Germany,
you just want a big American breakfast.

1208
01:46:41,107 --> 01:46:43,176
What happened? Where were you last night?

1209
01:46:43,276 --> 01:46:46,279
Vogel arranged for me to spend
some time in the East.

1210
01:46:46,379 --> 01:46:47,381
Oh, Jesus.

1211
01:46:47,481 --> 01:46:51,680
Frankly, it's not that much worse than
where you have me here in the West.

1212
01:46:52,853 --> 01:46:56,056
So the Russians
are fine with the exchange,

1213
01:46:56,156 --> 01:46:59,092
but now Vogel is saying that
the East Germans won't do it.

1214
01:46:59,192 --> 01:47:01,295
We're not gonna get Pryor.

1215
01:47:01,395 --> 01:47:05,462
Great, good. So the Soviets are set.
We get Powers.

1216
01:47:05,562 --> 01:47:08,902
We get Powers. Well done.

1217
01:47:09,002 --> 01:47:10,971
No, the East Germans won't do it.

1218
01:47:11,071 --> 01:47:14,841
We won't get Pryor, and that kid matters.
Every person matters.

1219
01:47:14,941 --> 01:47:17,761
Sure, that's why you tried.
That's why you tried.

1220
01:47:17,861 --> 01:47:20,280
Abel's on his way,
so we're all set for tomorrow morning.

1221
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:22,382
Makes things simple. Makes things simple.

1222
01:47:22,482 --> 01:47:24,585
We are not getting the kid.

1223
01:47:24,785 --> 01:47:27,053
Yeah, I understand. We're set.

1224
01:47:27,153 --> 01:47:29,885
We can ignore the message
we got this morning.

1225
01:47:30,557 --> 01:47:31,825
What message?

1226
01:47:31,925 --> 01:47:34,961
From the East Germans.
They called the number I gave you.

1227
01:47:35,061 --> 01:47:37,297
They said they wanted
to speak to you today.

1228
01:47:37,397 --> 01:47:40,880
- Vogel called?
- No. Office...

1229
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:43,320
Harald Ott, East German attorney general.

1230
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:45,071
Wanting what? What does he want?

1231
01:47:45,171 --> 01:47:48,842
Well, to talk to you. But it's okay,
I can't ask you to go back there.

1232
01:47:48,942 --> 01:47:51,678
And listen, you seem to be persona
non grata to some elements,

1233
01:47:51,778 --> 01:47:55,148
- so we won't push our luck.
- So he wants to see me.

1234
01:47:55,248 --> 01:47:57,117
What time?

1235
01:47:57,217 --> 01:48:00,086
Oh, no, no. Now, listen. You...

1236
01:48:00,186 --> 01:48:04,124
You don't need to go. In fact,
you shouldn't go. In fact, you can't go.

1237
01:48:04,424 --> 01:48:06,793
We're set with the Soviets.
We don't want to screw it up.

1238
01:48:06,893 --> 01:48:08,962
- I'm not gonna screw it up.
- You're not going!

1239
01:48:09,062 --> 01:48:11,865
- Don't be a pain in the ass.
- I ordered.

1240
01:48:11,965 --> 01:48:14,530
Enjoy your big American breakfast.

1241
01:48:23,577 --> 01:48:27,881
I thought it should be negotiated at
the highest level as a courtesy to you.

1242
01:48:27,981 --> 01:48:30,379
I thank you, sir.

1243
01:48:32,018 --> 01:48:35,001
I don't know how things
became so confused.

1244
01:48:35,101 --> 01:48:38,637
Well, I guess sometimes they just do.

1245
01:48:42,195 --> 01:48:46,299
For sake of clarity, I say we are
fully prepared to exchange

1246
01:48:46,399 --> 01:48:50,637
the so-called student, Pryor,
for Rudolf Abel.

1247
01:48:50,737 --> 01:48:53,807
I understand from Mr. Vogel
that Pryor is very important to you.

1248
01:48:53,907 --> 01:48:55,208
Yes, but...

1249
01:48:55,308 --> 01:48:58,673
We'll do a memorandum to that effect.

1250
01:48:59,245 --> 01:49:01,014
Oh, a memorandum.

1251
01:49:01,114 --> 01:49:05,580
Certainly, we commit
to a bi-lateral exchange.

1252
01:49:06,019 --> 01:49:10,390
Yes, yes, sure. I'm not sure
what that means but...

1253
01:49:10,490 --> 01:49:15,095
My country also insists
on Francis Gary Powers.

1254
01:49:15,195 --> 01:49:16,558
No!

1255
01:49:21,334 --> 01:49:24,838
This is how things became so confused.

1256
01:49:24,938 --> 01:49:27,407
Powers. What use is he, sir?

1257
01:49:27,507 --> 01:49:30,677
You want him back for punitive reasons?
What's done is done.

1258
01:49:30,777 --> 01:49:34,848
He has divulged what he will divulge,
as no doubt Abel has also.

1259
01:49:34,948 --> 01:49:39,853
We are offering instead
someone who you insist is innocent.

1260
01:49:39,953 --> 01:49:43,456
And this is right.
This is who you should retrieve.

1261
01:49:43,556 --> 01:49:46,955
The future. Look to the future.

1262
01:49:49,713 --> 01:49:51,290
Ott.

1263
01:49:53,867 --> 01:49:55,590
Ott.

1264
01:50:04,144 --> 01:50:07,242
I'm sorry. If you could
give me a moment, sir.

1265
01:50:26,232 --> 01:50:30,904
I'm very sorry. The attorney general regrets
that he had to leave on urgent business.

1266
01:50:31,004 --> 01:50:34,274
- He left?
- Yes. Many apologies.

1267
01:50:34,374 --> 01:50:38,308
- I've been waiting for over an hour.
- Very sorry, sir.

1268
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:42,536
Young man.

1269
01:50:43,917 --> 01:50:46,014
Come here.

1270
01:50:46,589 --> 01:50:48,983
It's all right. Come here.

1271
01:50:55,175 --> 01:50:57,292
Take a seat.

1272
01:50:57,864 --> 01:51:01,229
Oh, come on, come on. Sit down.

1273
01:51:04,304 --> 01:51:06,518
Do you like your job here?

1274
01:51:06,906 --> 01:51:10,343
- It's a very good job, sir.
- It must be. Must be interesting.

1275
01:51:10,443 --> 01:51:13,747
- Oh, yes, sir.
- And important, too.

1276
01:51:13,847 --> 01:51:16,250
And your English is... is good.

1277
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:19,736
Yes, I hesitate to say it's excellent.
But it's excellent, sir.

1278
01:51:19,836 --> 01:51:21,705
Good, good. Good.

1279
01:51:21,805 --> 01:51:26,560
See, I just lost my negotiating partner
and I need somebody to talk to,

1280
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:28,991
and you seem like a reasonable young man.

1281
01:51:30,296 --> 01:51:32,727
Can I talk to you?

1282
01:51:35,001 --> 01:51:36,869
It's all right.

1283
01:51:36,983 --> 01:51:39,534
It's all right. I just...

1284
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:43,112
I just need you to give
a message to your boss.

1285
01:51:44,578 --> 01:51:47,614
But it has to be very, very, very clear.

1286
01:51:47,714 --> 01:51:48,803
You understand?

1287
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:53,019
Yes, sir. But perhaps
you should wait until he...

1288
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:56,953
No, no. The thing is, I have
this cold and I wanna get home...

1289
01:51:57,223 --> 01:51:59,595
and get in bed.

1290
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:04,393
- Can you give him the message?
- Certainly.

1291
01:52:05,699 --> 01:52:07,763
Well, this is the message.

1292
01:52:08,935 --> 01:52:12,901
"There is no deal for Abel
unless we get Powers and Pryor."

1293
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:15,442
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

1294
01:52:15,542 --> 01:52:19,612
It's arranged for tomorrow morning.
It will not happen unless we get two men.

1295
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:23,066
- Those two men. Two, two, two.
- Yes, sir.

1296
01:52:23,516 --> 01:52:26,019
If there is no deal...

1297
01:52:26,119 --> 01:52:28,722
your boss must tell the Soviets.

1298
01:52:29,489 --> 01:52:34,413
He has to tell the Soviets
that they are not getting Rudolf Abel.

1299
01:52:35,695 --> 01:52:37,941
Yes, sir.

1300
01:52:40,133 --> 01:52:42,489
Oh, and tell him this.

1301
01:52:42,869 --> 01:52:45,872
That so far, Abel has been a good soldier,

1302
01:52:45,972 --> 01:52:48,515
but he thinks he's going home.

1303
01:52:50,443 --> 01:52:52,679
If we had to tell him
that he's not going home,

1304
01:52:52,779 --> 01:52:55,615
that the Soviets don't even want him,
that he's never going home...

1305
01:52:55,715 --> 01:52:59,147
Well, I imagine his behavior might change.

1306
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:03,603
And who will be held responsible for that?

1307
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:09,041
That's a long message.

1308
01:53:09,141 --> 01:53:11,792
- Did you get it all?
- Yes, sir. Got it.

1309
01:53:11,892 --> 01:53:13,900
Good.

1310
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,502
You're a good man.

1311
01:53:18,104 --> 01:53:22,642
And also tell him there's no deal unless
we hear before the end of business today.

1312
01:53:22,742 --> 01:53:24,144
He has the number.

1313
01:53:24,244 --> 01:53:26,179
If the exchange isn't gonna happen,

1314
01:53:26,279 --> 01:53:29,060
no reason for everybody to get up
first thing in the morning.

1315
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:31,585
No, sir, that would be pointless.

1316
01:53:31,985 --> 01:53:33,955
You're kidding me!

1317
01:53:34,055 --> 01:53:36,923
- You're kidding me!
- Not really. I need some change.

1318
01:53:37,023 --> 01:53:39,492
This is exactly what you
weren't supposed to do.

1319
01:53:39,592 --> 01:53:42,128
My instructions were
to feel out the situation.

1320
01:53:42,228 --> 01:53:44,764
Your instructions were to get
Powers, not Pryor.

1321
01:53:44,864 --> 01:53:47,133
That was not the original deal.
You fouled it all up!

1322
01:53:47,233 --> 01:53:50,003
How do you know?
I feel pretty good about it.

1323
01:53:50,103 --> 01:53:53,239
- You fucked it all up!
- Oh, don't worry.

1324
01:53:53,339 --> 01:53:58,406
- I think it's gonna be fine.
- How do you know? You don't know that.

1325
01:54:01,147 --> 01:54:05,307
United States. New York, New York. <i>Danke.</i>

1326
01:54:05,985 --> 01:54:08,488
Look, this whole thing...

1327
01:54:08,988 --> 01:54:11,264
has been to feel me out.

1328
01:54:11,625 --> 01:54:15,295
Would I swap one for one and which one?

1329
01:54:15,395 --> 01:54:18,865
But I said "No, two for one."
So they know where we stand.

1330
01:54:19,065 --> 01:54:21,034
Yeah, what if they think
about it and say...

1331
01:54:21,134 --> 01:54:24,665
"Forget it! You keep our guy,
we keep your guys"?

1332
01:54:26,306 --> 01:54:28,841
Well, then I have fucked it all up.

1333
01:54:28,941 --> 01:54:31,077
Hey, honey! It's me.

1334
01:54:31,177 --> 01:54:34,762
Yeah. The fishing's been great.

1335
01:54:35,749 --> 01:54:40,236
I'm in London, just for one more meeting,
then I'm on my way home.

1336
01:54:40,653 --> 01:54:43,857
Yeah, yeah, I remember that marmalade.

1337
01:54:43,957 --> 01:54:47,039
It's that shop right by Regent's Park.

1338
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:51,932
All right, I will if I have the time.
Hey, can I say hi to Roger?

1339
01:54:52,532 --> 01:54:54,834
Could I say hi to the girls?

1340
01:54:54,934 --> 01:54:57,403
Is anyone not busy?

1341
01:54:57,503 --> 01:55:00,708
Have they even noticed I'm not around?

1342
01:55:56,195 --> 01:55:58,431
We're on.

1343
01:55:58,531 --> 01:56:00,100
Two for one.

1344
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:02,334
Hot dog.

1345
01:56:03,102 --> 01:56:05,071
Let's have a drink.

1346
01:56:05,171 --> 01:56:07,841
- One wrinkle.
- What is that?

1347
01:56:07,941 --> 01:56:10,543
They won't release Pryor
with Powers, not at the bridge.

1348
01:56:10,643 --> 01:56:12,172
They'll release him at the same time.

1349
01:56:12,272 --> 01:56:14,447
When the Russians give us
Powers on the bridge,

1350
01:56:14,547 --> 01:56:16,916
they'll release Pryor
over Checkpoint Charlie.

1351
01:56:17,016 --> 01:56:18,851
What does that mean?

1352
01:56:18,951 --> 01:56:22,656
I think it means,
"We wanna have the last word."

1353
01:56:22,856 --> 01:56:24,958
But they will do it.

1354
01:56:25,058 --> 01:56:27,135
You tell me. You felt them out.

1355
01:56:47,747 --> 01:56:50,550
Where are they? Where's our guy?
Where's our guy?

1356
01:56:50,650 --> 01:56:54,053
- They're late.
- Nobody's late. We're early.

1357
01:56:54,153 --> 01:56:56,884
- May I?
- Yeah.

1358
01:57:02,762 --> 01:57:04,831
- Hoffman.
- Yeah?

1359
01:57:04,931 --> 01:57:08,368
- I think they have...
- What?

1360
01:57:08,468 --> 01:57:12,538
- ...snipers.
- Well, I'm sure they do.

1361
01:57:12,638 --> 01:57:14,807
How are you sure they do?

1362
01:57:14,907 --> 01:57:17,505
Because we have snipers.

1363
01:57:34,327 --> 01:57:36,557
Step out, sir.

1364
01:57:44,036 --> 01:57:46,067
Jim.

1365
01:57:49,509 --> 01:57:51,772
Dear Jim.

1366
01:57:53,846 --> 01:57:56,717
- How are you?
- Happy to see you.

1367
01:57:57,217 --> 01:57:59,085
Have you arranged all this for me?

1368
01:57:59,185 --> 01:58:03,289
Well, let's see what this is before I...
I take credit for it.

1369
01:58:03,389 --> 01:58:06,431
Any word about Pryor
from Checkpoint Charlie?

1370
01:58:29,832 --> 01:58:31,786
Nothing cooking yet.

1371
01:58:37,924 --> 01:58:39,359
Excuse me, sir.

1372
01:58:39,459 --> 01:58:43,530
This is Lieutenant Joe Murphy, United States
Air Force, here to identify Powers.

1373
01:58:44,430 --> 01:58:47,729
- Lieutenant Murphy.
- Sir.

1374
01:58:50,303 --> 01:58:54,207
There may be a slight glitch.
I was a young man when I left.

1375
01:58:54,307 --> 01:58:57,163
Who will they find to identify me?

1376
01:58:57,677 --> 01:59:00,246
Well, I hope it's not
your East German family.

1377
01:59:00,346 --> 01:59:03,199
I doubt they could identify each other.

1378
01:59:37,450 --> 01:59:39,773
Looks like our party.

1379
01:59:46,592 --> 01:59:50,931
Well, let's go.
You can stay here, Donovan.

1380
01:59:51,731 --> 01:59:53,745
Not likely.

1381
01:59:55,384 --> 01:59:57,590
Open the gate.

1382
02:00:11,351 --> 02:00:14,187
What do you think will happen
when you get home?

1383
02:00:14,287 --> 02:00:16,622
I think...

1384
02:00:16,722 --> 02:00:19,167
I'll have a vodka.

1385
02:00:21,394 --> 02:00:23,262
Yeah.

1386
02:00:23,362 --> 02:00:24,664
Yeah.

1387
02:00:24,764 --> 02:00:27,300
But, Rudolf,
is there not the possibility...

1388
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:30,470
That my people are going to shoot me?

1389
02:00:30,870 --> 02:00:32,600
Yes.

1390
02:00:33,706 --> 02:00:36,695
- You're not worried?
- Would it help?

1391
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:50,823
To answer your question, my friend,

1392
02:00:50,923 --> 02:00:54,288
I acted honorably. I think they know that.

1393
02:00:54,794 --> 02:00:58,793
But sometimes people think wrong.
People are people.

1394
02:00:59,632 --> 02:01:02,162
Let's see how they greet me.

1395
02:01:02,835 --> 02:01:05,153
What can I look for?

1396
02:01:07,340 --> 02:01:11,907
If I'm embraced
or just shown the back seat.

1397
02:01:51,584 --> 02:01:53,314
<i>Da.</i>

1398
02:02:05,531 --> 02:02:07,836
Take off the hat.

1399
02:02:13,422 --> 02:02:15,066
Hey, Powers.

1400
02:02:16,525 --> 02:02:18,654
Hey, Murph.

1401
02:02:19,612 --> 02:02:22,042
Yeah, that's Powers.

1402
02:02:23,483 --> 02:02:26,018
All right, Mr. Donovan. We go now!

1403
02:02:26,318 --> 02:02:28,522
Hang on.

1404
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:37,205
Believe me, I will tell you.

1405
02:02:38,130 --> 02:02:39,654
There's no one here.

1406
02:02:42,802 --> 02:02:44,904
They're releasing another man
at Checkpoint Charlie.

1407
02:02:45,004 --> 02:02:47,139
We're just confirming that he's there.

1408
02:02:47,239 --> 02:02:48,574
Now!

1409
02:02:48,674 --> 02:02:50,971
As per plan, if you please.

1410
02:02:52,277 --> 02:02:55,815
Let's go. Pryor will show up
or he won't. Let's go.

1411
02:02:55,915 --> 02:02:58,418
They're waiting to see
if we'll do it without him.

1412
02:02:58,618 --> 02:03:01,916
We just have to stand here,
show them we won't.

1413
02:03:02,321 --> 02:03:05,449
I don't give a shit what they want.
We have our objective.

1414
02:03:05,549 --> 02:03:07,743
Go ahead, Abel.

1415
02:03:07,843 --> 02:03:10,246
Go ahead, sir. You can go.

1416
02:03:10,596 --> 02:03:15,162
If it is not to plan, we go home.
We exchange now or we go home!

1417
02:03:17,336 --> 02:03:20,806
- You're waiting for another man?
- Yup.

1418
02:03:20,906 --> 02:03:23,366
You want him, too.

1419
02:03:24,577 --> 02:03:25,565
I want him.

1420
02:03:25,665 --> 02:03:29,582
Doesn't matter what he wants, sir.
I'm in charge and you are free to go.

1421
02:03:29,682 --> 02:03:32,595
Please go. Walk across.

1422
02:03:43,195 --> 02:03:45,402
I can wait.

1423
02:04:09,488 --> 02:04:12,835
It's something. I'm not sure yet.

1424
02:04:14,426 --> 02:04:16,491
Hang on!

1425
02:05:00,139 --> 02:05:02,036
Let's go.

1426
02:05:07,713 --> 02:05:09,650
We got him!

1427
02:05:10,609 --> 02:05:12,432
I...

1428
02:05:13,819 --> 02:05:16,455
I sent you a gift, Jim.

1429
02:05:16,555 --> 02:05:19,419
It's a... it's a painting.

1430
02:05:19,759 --> 02:05:22,437
I hope it has some meaning to you.

1431
02:05:24,279 --> 02:05:27,257
I'm sorry.
I didn't think to get you a gift.

1432
02:05:30,019 --> 02:05:32,385
This is your gift.

1433
02:05:35,174 --> 02:05:37,205
This is your gift.

1434
02:06:12,011 --> 02:06:14,041
You okay?

1435
02:06:14,547 --> 02:06:16,955
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1436
02:07:35,928 --> 02:07:40,399
Mr. Donovan. Colonel Abel
asked me to give this to you.

1437
02:07:42,801 --> 02:07:45,032
Pardon me, sir.

1438
02:07:45,771 --> 02:07:48,221
Were you in charge of this thing, sir?

1439
02:07:48,541 --> 02:07:51,755
- Yeah.
- Well, I gotta thank you.

1440
02:07:51,855 --> 02:07:54,308
I gotta thank somebody.

1441
02:08:10,429 --> 02:08:14,300
I gave them nothing. I gave them nothing.

1442
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:16,201
It doesn't matter.

1443
02:08:16,301 --> 02:08:18,537
It doesn't matter what people think.

1444
02:08:18,637 --> 02:08:20,919
You know what you did.

1445
02:09:10,923 --> 02:09:13,229
Welcome home.

1446
02:09:14,426 --> 02:09:16,690
What a trip.

1447
02:09:27,639 --> 02:09:29,674
You okay?

1448
02:09:29,774 --> 02:09:32,239
Yeah, I'm fine.

1449
02:09:32,878 --> 02:09:36,289
- Did you get the marmalade?
- Yes, yes. Yep.

1450
02:09:36,389 --> 02:09:37,916
Yep.

1451
02:09:38,016 --> 02:09:39,880
I did.

1452
02:09:40,786 --> 02:09:42,214
As ordered.

1453
02:09:46,708 --> 02:09:48,360
Jim.

1454
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:50,462
- This is from Arno's.
- So?

1455
02:09:50,562 --> 02:09:52,987
- On the corner!
- Well, honey, I was busy. I'm sorry.

1456
02:09:53,087 --> 02:09:55,753
- Oh, for Pete's sake.
- We were so busy. How's Roger? Is he home?

1457
02:09:55,853 --> 02:09:58,737
He's home. Carol's home,
Peggy's home. Everyone's home.

1458
02:09:58,837 --> 02:10:02,041
Mom! Come quick! Look!

1459
02:10:02,541 --> 02:10:04,109
Mom, come here!

1460
02:10:04,209 --> 02:10:06,979
- Come see this! Look! Watch!
- Come on!

1461
02:10:07,079 --> 02:10:09,114
