1
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,031
Your hands are...

2
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,186
disgusting.

3
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,245
Let me do it.

4
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,170
Disgusting?

5
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,984
Just breathe.

6
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,842
I'll go with dad.

7
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,922
My truck's up there.

8
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,772
Don't worry.

9
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,566
Wait here.

10
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,811
What's wrong?

11
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,185
It's dad!

12
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,466
Wait here.

13
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,349
I'm going back in...

14
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,010
Stay here.

15
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,097
No. Dad would've heard this.

16
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,564
You're lying!

17
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,393
My dad used the radio every day!

18
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,209
You're nothing like him!

19
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,508
It's not a song...

20
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,804
on the radio.

21
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,427
Beyond the sea...

22
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,553
right?

23
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,601
It's not a song...

24
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,894
it's a signal.

25
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,773
They're telling us where to look.

26
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,693
I looked up the radio station...

27
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,818
where the song is coming from.

28
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,996
It's an island!

29
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,002
I can follow the train tracks.

30
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,297
It's not even one day.

31
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,554
Then I can find a boat—

32
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,261
You can't do this.

33
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,307
If I can find the song...
where it's coming from...

34
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,352
I can use this...

35
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,479
to change this...

36
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,861
into this!

37
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,192
Mom will never let you go!

38
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,900
I

39
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:26,700
I can

40
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:27,322
I can save

41
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:28,449
I can save them.

42
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:29,916
I can

43
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:30,499
I can save

44
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,164
I can save us.

45
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,707
I'll tell her.

46
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,246
Mom...

47
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,383
I'll tell her.

48
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:40,085
Please don't do this!

49
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,963
I need to try.

50
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,184
Why?!

51
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,553
Because dad would.

52
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,344
And look what happened to him!

53
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,715
What home?

54
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:41,069
You said...

55
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:45,778
that you could not do enough.

56
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,026
Now...

57
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,613
you can.

58
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:54,696
Don't go.

59
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,076
I will be right back.

60
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,695
A matter of hours.

61
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,039
But the baby, I don't know how—

62
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,284
I showed you how to do it.

63
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,417
Stay calm.

64
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,666
You have everything you need.

65
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,969
Everything.

66
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,425
Please...

67
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,763
Look...

68
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,182
If I don't go...

69
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,853
soon you'll be in a lot of pain...

70
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,567
and I won't know...

71
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:40,409
I won't lose you too.

72
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,957
Breathe.

73
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,295
Okay?

74
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,087
I'll be right back.

75
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,144
Thank you.
