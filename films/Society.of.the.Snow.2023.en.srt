<i>On October 13, 1972,</i>

2
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,765
<i>an Uruguayan plane
crashed in the Andean Mountain Range.</i>

3
00:01:03,223 --> 00:01:05,765
<i>Forty of us passengers
and five crew members</i>

4
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:07,306
<i>were on board the plane.</i>

5
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:12,015
<i>Some say it was a tragedy.</i>

6
00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:16,140
<i>Others call it a miracle.</i>

7
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:21,015
<i>What really happened?</i>

8
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:25,390
<i>What happens when the world abandons you?</i>

9
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:30,973
<i>When you have no clothes…
and you're freezing?</i>

10
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,015
<i>When you have no food, and you're dying?</i>

11
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,306
<i>The answer's in the mountain.</i>

12
00:01:44,348 --> 00:01:46,181
<i>We have to go back to the past</i>

13
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:49,806
<i>to understand that the past
is what changes the most.</i>

OCTOBER 1972</i>

15
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,056
<i>Let's go! Get in there!</i>

16
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,681
<i>C'mon, Olds! Yeah! Come on! We got this!</i>

17
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:03,015
<i>That ball's ours! Push!</i>

18
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:08,265
<i>Go, Christians!</i>

19
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:11,848
<i>C'mon, Christians! Push!</i>

20
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,390

21
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:16,348

<i>Go, Roberto!</i>

23
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:23,223
<i>Pass it to Nando!</i>

24
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:24,765
<i>Roberto, pass it!</i>

25
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:27,890
<i>-To Nando!
-Come on!</i>

26
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:32,348
<i>Pass it! Roberto, pass it!</i>

27
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:34,390
<i>Pass it!</i>

28
00:02:39,848 --> 00:02:40,848
<i>Pass it.</i>

29
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:45,348
<i>There were four players ahead of you.
I couldn't pass.</i>

30
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,390
<i>-You could have, but you thought too much.
-You gotta think less and do more.</i>

31
00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:50,681
<i>-You couldn't have done better.
-Couldn't have done worse.</i>

32
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:52,848
<i>I messed up once!
We won the last cup because of me.</i>

33
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:54,015
<i>Because of you?</i>

34
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:58,765
<i>All right, all right! Knock it off!</i>

35
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:01,098
<i>Hey. What's so funny, huh? Today's score?</i>

36
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,223
<i>Roberto, you trust me, right?</i>

37
00:03:04,306 --> 00:03:08,056
<i>So, when I say,
"Pass it," you pass it. Okay?</i>

38
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,306
<i>And when I say the trip money
is due today, I expect it today!</i>

39
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,056
<i>Okay? We have half a plane to fill.
Dan, is your cousin coming?</i>

40
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,431
<i>-Yeah. It'll be the four of us.
-Our money.</i>

41
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:19,265
<i>No envelope? Great, Coco.</i>

42
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:21,390
<i>-No.
-Anybody else, then?</i>

43
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:22,890
<i>Gastón, are your friends in?</i>

44
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:25,473
<i>-Yeah. I convinced them.
-You're sure?</i>

45
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:27,640
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, except one.</i>

46

<i>"'You are my beloved Son,'
He said."</i>

47

<i>"And at once, the Spirit
drove Jesus out into the desert."</i>

48
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:38,723
<i>"And He remained in the desert
for 40 days and nights,</i>

49
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:41,765

50

<i>"'If you are the Son of God,</i>

51
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,181

00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:51,890

to them, saying, "This is my body…"</i>

<i>Hey! You!</i>

62
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:16,473
<i>Come here. Come here. Come here.</i>

63
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,598
<i>Hand this paper to Pancho. Right there.</i>

64
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:23,556
<i>Thanks.</i>

65
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,348
<i>Psst, Numa.</i>

66
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:28,640

67
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:30,931
<i>Gastón.</i>

68
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,640
<i>COME TO CHILE, MAN!</i>

70
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:47,223
<i>Workers and students,

71
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:49,098
<i>No, it's the final Commercial Law test.</i>

72
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,890
<i>-I can't go.
-No! It's gonna get postponed anyway.</i>

73
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:54,973
<i>-For two weeks. Just look outside!
-It's not about the test.</i>

74
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:58,265
<i>-I don't care about rugby.
-Rugby? Rugby's the least of it!</i>

75

<i>Santiago de Chile, $45.
You'll never find a cheaper ticket.</i>

-In your life!</i>

77
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:05,806
<i>Do you know what this is?</i>

78
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,223
<i>This little list here has all the numbers
of the girls we've met there.</i>

79
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:12,265
<i>-Graciela…
-Flamboyant.</i>

80
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:14,140
<i>-Silvia…
-Fine.</i>

81
00:05:14,223 --> 00:05:16,015
<i>-Beatriz…
-A lioness.</i>

82
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:17,640
<i>-Nélida…
-No, not her.</i>

83
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:19,348
<i>What? Nélida's amazing. Knock it off.</i>

84
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:22,515
<i>Nélida messed you up,
left you crying all around Montevideo.</i>

85
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:25,223
<i>-Whoa! What is wrong with you?
-No, no…</i>

86
00:05:25,306 --> 00:05:27,640
<i>You keep this thing.
Don't let Gastón touch it.</i>

87
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:30,890
<i>Okay? Let's go grab another drink.
Come on.</i>

88
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:35,140
<i>-Stop. What is wrong with you?
-You gotta relax.</i>

89
00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:38,431
<i>Don't let me travel with these two morons.
Please. I beg of you.</i>

90
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:41,140
<i>You're not gonna convince me,
Pancho.</i>

91
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:43,515
<i>-Want a good argument to talk you into it?
-Do it.</i>

92
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:44,973
<i>I really want you to go.</i>

93
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:49,390
<i>'Cause you graduate in a couple of months,
and you'll start working nonstop.</i>

94
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:52,848
<i>You'll be the best lawyer in all
of Montevideo, and we'll be proud of you.</i>

95
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,640
<i>But we're gonna have different lives.</i>

96
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:58,223
<i>This may actually be
the last trip we take together, you know?</i>

97
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:02,473
<i>You trying to make me cry, man?</i>

98
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:06,181
<i>Workers and students,
hand in hand, we stand!</i>

99
00:06:14,348 --> 00:06:16,348
<i>Good evening.</i>

100
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:28,473
<i>Who's a good boy?
How's it goin', buddy?</i>

101
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:06,931
<i>Champ.</i>

102
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:09,265
<i>What do you think?</i>

103
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,348
<i>Should we go?</i>

104
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:28,598
<i>It's eight o'clock
this Thursday morning in Montevideo.</i>

105
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,098
<i>Jackass!</i>

110
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:47,265
<i>Oh, Panchito.</i>

111
00:07:56,598 --> 00:07:59,181
<i>Have a good one.</i>

112
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:06,181
<i>Honey, can you help me
find the boys, please?</i>

113
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:07,848
<i>Numa!</i>

114

<i>Hey.</i>

115
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:12,515
<i>Let's do it.</i>

116
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:15,015
<i>Canessa! Roberto Canessa!</i>

117

<i>Bye.</i>

122
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:24,348
<i>-Goodbye.
-Okay. Let's go.</i>

123
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:25,640
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

124
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:26,598
<i>-Bye.
-Mwah!</i>

125
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:27,806
<i>-Be good.
-Okay.</i>

126
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,640

-Kiss Mommy.</i>

127
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:32,140

-Love you, Mom. We'll miss you.</i>

128
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:34,015
<i>One. Two.</i>

129
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:36,140
<i>-Javier, smile.
-Three.</i>

130
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,973
<i>-Done.
-Let's go!</i>

131
00:08:40,056 --> 00:08:41,640
<i>Bravo!</i>

132
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,140
<i>Did you hear it click?</i>

133
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,473
<i>-Yeah, I got it.
-Perfect.</i>

134
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,473
<i>Dude!</i>

135
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,098
<i>My name is Numa Turcatti.</i>

136
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:54,806
<i>I'm 24 years old.</i>

137
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:56,973
<i>It's great that all these guys get to go.</i>

138
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:59,556
<i>I look around,
and I barely know anyone here…</i>

139
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,056
<i>but at the same time,
it all feels familiar.</i>

140
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:09,431
<i>Most of them are young, like me.</i>

141
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:13,348
<i>Lovingly raised in houses near the sea.</i>

142
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:14,473
<i>Hey!</i>

143
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:20,431
<i>For some of them,
it's their first trip away from home.</i>

144
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:32,431
<i>Sit down! Carlitos, stop! Just sit down!</i>

145
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:34,515
<i>Come on!</i>

146
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:37,098
<i>Yeah, you're very talented.
Sit down.</i>

147
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:38,098
<i>Could be anything.</i>

148
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:56,848
<i>Coco, look at the camera.</i>

149
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,806
<i>Looks good.</i>

150
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:07,848
<i>Hey! Hey, Diego! Come on!</i>

151
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:12,556
<i>Hey. That's a pretty nice hand, man.</i>

152
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,848
<i>Dude, your cousin--</i>

153
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:20,515
<i>Opa! We just got bitten by the shark.</i>

154
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:21,931
<i>The mountain range, huh?</i>

155
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:24,973
<i>Is it true these mountains try to suck up
anyone who passes over them?</i>

156
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:27,223
<i>Yeah. It's true.</i>

157
00:10:29,348 --> 00:10:31,473
<i>The warm winds
from the plains of Argentina</i>

158
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:33,473
<i>collide with the cold winds
of the mountains</i>

159
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:34,765
<i>and create a suction effect.</i>

160
00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:36,306
<i>Nah. You're joking.</i>

161
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,473
<i>I'm not joking.
That's why there's turbulence.</i>

162
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,890
<i>But, you know, we're one step ahead.</i>

163
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:42,848
<i>Check it out.</i>

164
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,640
<i>This is the mountain range.</i>

165
00:10:49,306 --> 00:10:52,348
<i>And now, we have to go from here.</i>

166
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:54,306
<i>But the route isn't a straight line.</i>

167
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,556
<i>Look. You can't cross it just like that.
The range is massive.</i>

168
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,640
<i>That's why we have to travel south,

00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,640
<i>-Oh yeah. That'd be great.
-Oh. Fries on the side.</i>

337
00:29:11,723 --> 00:29:14,390
<i>-I love their milanesas. So good.
-They're the best.</i>

338
00:29:14,473 --> 00:29:17,390
<i>Incredible. And the size
of the milanesas of La Mascota.</i>

339
00:29:17,473 --> 00:29:20,848
<i>-Fries… and ham. Bacon.
-Hey.</i>

340
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,056
<i>They could've dropped
some food from the plane, right?</i>

341
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:29,015
<i>Well, that wouldn't make sense.</i>

342
00:29:30,431 --> 00:29:33,140
<i>If they drop a package like that,
it'd sink in the snow.</i>

343
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:34,765
<i>We'd never get it.</i>

344
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:50,515
<i>Bring in the injured.</i>

345
00:29:50,598 --> 00:29:52,515
<i>Easy. Easy. Okay.</i>

346
00:29:52,598 --> 00:29:54,348
<i>Careful with his legs. Right there.</i>

347
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:58,306
<i>You'll be better there, Arturo. Easy.</i>

348
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,640
<i>It's getting closer.</i>

349
00:30:09,723 --> 00:30:13,181
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

350
00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:15,681
<i>-Yeah. Me neither.
-You see something?</i>

351
00:30:15,765 --> 00:30:16,973
<i>I don't see it.</i>

352
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,765
<i>The Andes are massive.</i>

353
00:30:36,723 --> 00:30:39,431
<i>They must be organizing
the search somehow.</i>

354
00:30:39,515 --> 00:30:40,848
<i>By zone.</i>

355
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:42,681
<i>Yesterday, they were here.</i>

356
00:30:42,765 --> 00:30:44,265
<i>We saw them fly over.</i>

357
00:30:45,181 --> 00:30:47,015
<i>We heard them today,
but we couldn't see them.</i>

358
00:30:47,098 --> 00:30:48,973
<i>They're probably searching somewhere else.</i>

359
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,598
<i>If they're looking, they didn't see us.</i>

360
00:30:51,306 --> 00:30:52,306
<i>They're coming.</i>

361
00:30:53,348 --> 00:30:56,473
<i>-We need to have faith.
-Faith? What faith?</i>

362
00:30:56,973 --> 00:30:59,765
<i>Don't talk this way
in front of the younger guys.</i>

363
00:30:59,848 --> 00:31:01,806
<i>If you tell them,
you'll destroy their morale.</i>

364
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,973
<i>You guys are the oldest ones here,
and you have a responsibility.</i>

365
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,806
<i>They will rescue us.</i>

366
00:31:16,723 --> 00:31:19,431
<i>-We won't last like this.
-How long can we survive?</i>

367
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,098
<i>-Know the rule of three?
-No.</i>

368
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,890
<i>Three minutes without air,</i>

369
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:26,848
<i>three days without water,
and three weeks without food.</i>

370
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:28,681
<i>Three weeks without food?</i>

371
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:30,556
<i>I haven't eaten in three days.
I'm starving.</i>

372
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,515
<i>It's a lot worse here.
There's the altitude and the cold.</i>

373
00:31:33,598 --> 00:31:36,348
<i>We're burning three
or four times as many calories.</i>

374
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:38,431
<i>Roque told us about the batteries.</i>

375
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,765
<i>They were in the tail of the plane.</i>

376
00:31:41,723 --> 00:31:45,473
<i>In my opinion, we should go up there,
where the plane crashed,</i>

377
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:47,640
<i>and get the radio working.</i>

378
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,015
<i>We gotta keep going!</i>

379
00:32:59,098 --> 00:33:00,140
<i>The snow is still firm!</i>

380
00:33:00,223 --> 00:33:03,306
<i>-Let's take advantage of that!
-Numa! Save your energy!</i>

381
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,015
<i>I don't want to carry you back.</i>

382
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,515
<i>Fito.</i>

383
00:33:12,015 --> 00:33:13,015
<i>What happened?</i>

384
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:16,056
<i>You can't see the plane.</i>

385
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,140
<i>They won't find it,
even if they fly over us.</i>

386
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:45,681
<i>We're going back!</i>

387
00:33:52,015 --> 00:33:54,098
<i>It's been six days without food.</i>

388
00:33:58,556 --> 00:34:01,056
<i>Last night,
we split what we had left.</i>

389
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,598
<i>A pack of crackers.</i>

390
00:34:04,348 --> 00:34:05,640
<i>There's nothing else.</i>

391
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:26,473
<i>Carlitos came over
to tell me something.</i>

392
00:35:28,515 --> 00:35:30,848
<i>He says that Nando's losing his mind.</i>

393
00:35:31,515 --> 00:35:34,848
<i>Last night, he went up to him
and said he wasn't gonna starve to death.</i>

394
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:36,431
<i>I'm not gonna starve to death.</i>

395
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:38,431
<i>That he'd eat the bodies
if he had to.</i>

396
00:35:38,515 --> 00:35:40,723
<i>If I have to, I'll eat the bodies.</i>

397
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,098
<i>I told him
that we don't have another option.</i>

398
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:03,848
<i>If we wanna get rescued,
we gotta stay alive.</i>

399
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:09,098
<i>And to stay alive, we need to eat.</i>

400
00:36:36,598 --> 00:36:37,598
<i>Marcelo.</i>

401
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:41,931
<i>We're dying.</i>

402
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,098
<i>We're starving, and they're not coming.</i>

403
00:36:46,973 --> 00:36:50,681
<i>-We're wasting ourselves away.
-Seven days and nights without food.</i>

404
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:53,765
<i>Nothing. If we don't eat, we're gonna die.</i>

405
00:36:54,431 --> 00:36:55,515
<i>Eat what?</i>

406
00:36:58,598 --> 00:37:00,348
<i>Are you crazy, Roberto?</i>

407
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:02,556
<i>You gonna make everyone else crazy too?</i>

408
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,806
<i>There's food outside.</i>

409
00:37:10,806 --> 00:37:13,056
<i>There's protein outside.
Energy that we need.</i>

410
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,931
<i>Do you know what's crazy?
To go on like this!</i>

411
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,015
<i>Roberto!</i>

412
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:22,390
<i>Roberto's right. We're talking
about living or dying, Marcelo.</i>

413
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:25,098
<i>And if help arrives
in two days, then what, Fito?</i>

414
00:37:25,181 --> 00:37:26,765
<i>Can't we wait a couple more days?</i>

415
00:37:26,848 --> 00:37:29,265
<i>-Know what happens when you stop eating?
-Roberto!</i>

416
00:37:32,473 --> 00:37:34,098
<i>The body dries out. Just like plants.</i>

417
00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:36,806
<i>You can't use your brain.
Because it dries out too, Marcelo.</i>

418
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,473
<i>-My pee is black.
-Yeah, my pee is black too.</i>

419
00:37:39,556 --> 00:37:40,848
<i>If we do it…</i>

420
00:37:42,431 --> 00:37:44,640
<i>what will happen to us?
Will God forgive us?</i>

421
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:47,390
<i>God put us in this situation.
He'll understand we need to survive.</i>

422
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,473
<i>God has nothing to do with this.</i>

423
00:37:49,556 --> 00:37:51,015
<i>I'm sorry, Marcelo.</i>

424
00:37:51,098 --> 00:37:52,765
<i>It's luck that brought us here.</i>

425
00:37:52,848 --> 00:37:54,265
<i>-Bad luck.
-It's meat.</i>

426
00:37:54,348 --> 00:37:57,265
<i>-It's people we love, Arturo.
-And how do you cut up a body?</i>

427
00:37:58,015 --> 00:37:59,556
<i>And who would even do it?</i>

428
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,973
<i>Me.</i>

429
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:08,348
<i>I'll do it.</i>

430
00:38:08,848 --> 00:38:11,473
<i>-I will too.
-I'm not eating them.</i>

431
00:38:12,515 --> 00:38:14,140
<i>That's something I refuse to do.</i>

432
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:17,556
<i>Is it legal to eat a dead person?</i>

433
00:38:18,056 --> 00:38:19,806
<i>Won't we go to prison if we do it?</i>

434
00:38:20,306 --> 00:38:23,181
<i>-It would be like organ donation.
-What's wrong with you?</i>

435
00:38:23,265 --> 00:38:27,223
<i>For it to be organ donation,
you need to have the donor's consent.</i>

436
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,265
<i>It's a crime, Marcelo.</i>

437
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:33,098
<i>We can't just take, defile, and desecrate
someone's body without consent.</i>

438
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:35,681
<i>-We need to eat, Numa.
-We don't have the right to.</i>

439
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:38,681
<i>And don't I have the right
to do everything I can to survive?</i>

440
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:43,765
<i>Who's gonna take that from me? You?</i>

441
00:40:58,223 --> 00:40:59,265
<i>Susy?</i>

442
00:41:00,556 --> 00:41:02,473
<i>Susy. Susy, breathe.</i>

443
00:41:03,056 --> 00:41:04,723
<i>No, no, no. Susana.</i>

444
00:41:05,223 --> 00:41:08,140
<i>Susana, come on. No. No. Gustavo!</i>

445
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:10,223
<i>Gustavo, help me, please.</i>

446
00:41:10,765 --> 00:41:13,473
<i>-Susana. Please help me!
-What's wrong?</i>

447
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:15,181
<i>She's not breathing. I don't know.</i>

448
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:17,765
<i>Okay. Put her legs over there.
I'll hold her head.</i>

449
00:41:17,848 --> 00:41:20,473
<i>Roberto.
She's not breathing, Roberto.</i>

450
00:41:20,556 --> 00:41:22,515
<i>-Help her.
-Bring her here. Right there.</i>

451
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:25,431
<i>Help me, Gustavo! Hurry!</i>

452
00:41:25,515 --> 00:41:27,848
<i>-She's not breathing.
-Susy!</i>

453
00:41:28,598 --> 00:41:30,848
<i>Coco Nicolich

And forgive us our trespasses.</i>

499
00:45:00,515 --> 00:45:02,765
<i>And lead us not into temptation.</i>

500
00:45:02,848 --> 00:45:04,681
<i>But deliver us from evil. Amen.</i>

501
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:25,890
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

502
00:45:34,015 --> 00:45:35,431
<i>Sorry, Marcelo.</i>

503
00:45:39,098 --> 00:45:40,556
<i>Sorry, Marcelo.</i>

504
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,056
<i>Will God forgive us?</i>

505
00:45:47,973 --> 00:45:50,556
<i>We don't have a choice.
I'm sorry, Marcelo.</i>

506
00:46:47,056 --> 00:46:49,390
<i>Don't give me
that look, Coche.</i>

507
00:46:52,765 --> 00:46:54,681
<i>I'm not giving you a look.</i>

508
00:47:15,681 --> 00:47:18,765
<i>The Strauch cousins
have the most difficult job.</i>

509
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,848
<i>The one no one wants to do.</i>

510
00:47:24,515 --> 00:47:26,348
<i>Fito chooses the bodies.</i>

511
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,806
<i>And they cut them up in secret.</i>

512
00:47:32,348 --> 00:47:34,265
<i>Away from everyone else.</i>

513
00:47:36,515 --> 00:47:39,181
<i>That's how they keep
the ones who eat sane.</i>

514
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,598
<i>Hey!</i>

515
00:47:58,681 --> 00:48:00,640
<i>-What?
-I found something!</i>

516
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,140
<i>A radio!</i>

517
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:10,598
<i>It's all wet.</i>

518
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:12,556
<i>Come on, Roy. Fix it.</i>

519
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,473
<i>Those of us who don't eat
keep watching the sky.</i>

520
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,140
<i>Waiting for a sign.</i>

521
00:48:40,556 --> 00:48:41,890
<i>Left or right?</i>

522
00:48:43,473 --> 00:48:44,348
<i>Higher, Coco.</i>

523
00:48:44,431 --> 00:48:46,348
<i>If you want it higher,
we'll need to get more wire</i>

524
00:48:46,431 --> 00:48:48,848
<i>and tie it to a pole or something.</i>

525
00:48:49,931 --> 00:48:53,140
<i>Hold it there.
A little bit to the left.</i>

526
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:55,765
<i>A bit more.</i>

527
00:48:57,848 --> 00:48:59,973
<i>Less. A little to the right.</i>

528
00:49:00,056 --> 00:49:00,973
<i>There.</i>

529
00:49:22,681 --> 00:49:23,681
<i>Take this.</i>

530
00:49:27,181 --> 00:49:28,306
<i>What is that?</i>

531
00:49:30,015 --> 00:49:32,431
<i>Eat it. It's easier with snow.</i>

532
00:49:32,515 --> 00:49:33,806
<i>No, thank you.</i>

533
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,306
<i>I'll be okay.</i>

534
00:49:38,473 --> 00:49:40,098
<i>You have to eat, Numa.</i>

535
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:46,223
<i>It's not right, Pancho.</i>

536
00:49:50,223 --> 00:49:54,140
<i>No!</i>

537
00:49:59,765 --> 00:50:02,265
<i>Why?!</i>

538
00:50:02,348 --> 00:50:06,556
<i>This is Spectator.
We're coming to you with new information.</i>

539
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,640
<i>The search for the Uruguayan plane
that crashed in the Andean Mountain Range</i>

540
00:50:09,723 --> 00:50:12,806
<i>with the rugby team Old Christians,
has come to an end.</i>

541
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:15,973
<i>In the ten days required by the protocol,</i>

542
00:50:16,056 --> 00:50:19,265
<i>66 search and rescue missions
were conducted,</i>

543
00:50:19,348 --> 00:50:22,390
<i>using 17 planes from the Chilean Air Force</i>

544
00:50:22,473 --> 00:50:25,973
<i>as well as aircrafts of the Uruguayan
and Argentinian Air Forces,</i>

545
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:27,806
<i>but to no avail.</i>

546
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:30,598
<i>Search efforts will resume
early next year,</i>

547
00:50:31,681 --> 00:50:33,223
<i>when the thawing of the ice will provide</i>

548
00:50:33,306 --> 00:50:36,390
<i>better conditions of visibility
to find the wreckage.</i>

549
00:50:36,473 --> 00:50:38,765
<i>The Chilean Air Force's rescue service</i>

550
00:50:38,848 --> 00:50:42,806
<i>has reported that, in the 34 air accidents
that have occurred in the Andes,</i>

551
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:45,056
<i>no survivors have ever been found.</i>

552
00:50:45,848 --> 00:50:48,556
<i>We'll return with more news
after a commercial break.</i>

553
00:50:52,056 --> 00:50:55,556
<i>Made with premium quality parts.</i>

554
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,681
<i>Beautiful colors and designs.</i>

555
00:50:58,515 --> 00:51:01,598
<i>Customizable,
with three different models.</i>

556
00:51:01,681 --> 00:51:06,056
<i>Bicicletas Victoria,
the leading bicycle brand.</i>

557
00:51:07,973 --> 00:51:09,223
<i>I was wrong.</i>

558
00:51:11,598 --> 00:51:14,098
<i>I begged you to wait
to be rescued for nothing.</i>

559
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:19,890
<i>But if I can ask you for one more thing,</i>

560
00:51:22,348 --> 00:51:23,890
<i>I'm asking you to eat.</i>

561
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:41,223
<i>The only thing we have left
is our life.</i>

562
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,390
<i>And we have to fight for it.</i>

563
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:57,140
<i>We went up to look
for the tail of the plane.</i>

564
00:51:57,223 --> 00:51:58,598
<i>Without telling anyone.</i>

565
00:51:58,681 --> 00:51:59,890
<i>With no plan.</i>

566
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:03,765
<i>We need to find batteries for the radio.</i>

567
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,890
<i>Over there.</i>

568
00:52:53,848 --> 00:52:55,223
<i>I'm here, Gastón.</i>

569
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:31,140
<i>That's Daniel Shaw, Fito's cousin.</i>

570
00:53:31,806 --> 00:53:34,140
<i>He was behind me on the plane
and flew out.</i>

571
00:53:34,765 --> 00:53:36,181
<i>Sun's going down.</i>

572
00:53:36,265 --> 00:53:37,723
<i>-We should go back.
-No.</i>

573
00:53:38,973 --> 00:53:40,598
<i>Let's look some more. Please.</i>

574
00:53:41,681 --> 00:53:45,098
<i>If we found all these things here,
the tail shouldn't be far behind.</i>

575
00:54:01,056 --> 00:54:02,265
<i>Who's up there?</i>

576
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:06,223
<i>Numa, Gustavo, and Maspons.</i>

577
00:54:07,848 --> 00:54:09,390
<i>They left with nothing.</i>

578
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:12,848
<i>The temperature up there
must drop 80 or 90 degrees.</i>

579
00:54:13,765 --> 00:54:15,431
<i>And it's gonna be night soon.</i>

580
00:54:24,223 --> 00:54:27,223
<i>The sun had melted the snow,
and we were knee-deep in it.</i>

581
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,973
<i>No, that way!</i>

582
00:54:38,223 --> 00:54:42,223
<i>We can barely keep going,
and the night traps us.</i>

583
00:54:45,765 --> 00:54:47,473
<i>Everyone, get closer! Get closer.</i>

584
00:54:51,848 --> 00:54:53,098
<i>Calm down!</i>

585
00:54:53,181 --> 00:54:54,640
<i>Come on!</i>

586
00:54:54,723 --> 00:54:56,640
<i>Please, Lord,
don't let us freeze to death.</i>

587
00:54:56,723 --> 00:54:59,056
<i>Shake the ice off my back!</i>

588
00:55:59,348 --> 00:56:01,598
<i>The more we try to get out,</i>

589
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,556
<i>the more the mountain resists.</i>

590
00:56:18,598 --> 00:56:19,765
<i>Hey!</i>

591
00:56:27,015 --> 00:56:29,098
<i>Gus, eat.</i>

592
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,431
<i>So, Numa.</i>

593
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,890
<i>What did you see up there?</i>

594
00:56:42,681 --> 00:56:43,848
<i>Numa.</i>

595
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:44,931
<i>Tell me.</i>

596
00:56:45,931 --> 00:56:47,681
<i>Only snow and mountains.</i>

597
00:56:48,348 --> 00:56:49,765
<i>In every direction?</i>

598
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:53,848
<i>As far as I could see,
that's all there is.</i>

599
00:56:53,931 --> 00:56:54,765
<i>And to the west?</i>

600
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,390
<i>-See anything behind that ice wall?
-No.</i>

601
00:57:00,681 --> 00:57:02,306
<i>You can't see anything.</i>

602
00:57:03,723 --> 00:57:04,973
<i>Chile's right behind it.</i>

603
00:57:07,265 --> 00:57:08,640
<i>We need to go there.</i>

604
00:57:11,056 --> 00:57:14,306
<i>But you gotta eat, Numa.
Or you won't make it to Chile.</i>

605
00:57:52,765 --> 00:57:53,765
<i>Come on.</i>

606
00:58:18,015 --> 00:58:20,681
<i>I don't chew
more than two or three times.</i>

607
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:24,765
<i>And I force myself to swallow.</i>

608
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:38,140
<i>For the first time,
I imagine the possibility</i>

609
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,806
<i>that feels increasingly real
of not getting back home.</i>

610
00:58:45,223 --> 00:58:46,931
<i>But I look at Nando, and I feel hope.</i>

611
00:58:50,306 --> 00:58:53,056
<i>He trains every day,
obsessed with one idea.</i>

612
00:58:54,181 --> 00:58:58,515
<i>Beyond that mountain
lie the green valleys of Chile.</i>

613
00:59:00,348 --> 00:59:02,015
<i>Climbing it is suicide.</i>

614
00:59:08,723 --> 00:59:10,056
<i>But I'm going with him.</i>

615
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:15,973
<i>DAY 17
FIFTH DAY OF THE STORM</i>

616
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:20,098
<i>Getting worse.</i>

617
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,640
<i>Okay, Vasco. Check this out.</i>

618
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,515
<i>'Cause your rhyme was all talk</i>

619
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:30,848
<i>Tell me, why don't you get up
And go out for a quick walk?</i>

620
00:59:32,556 --> 00:59:34,140
<i>You're an idiot, Bobby!</i>

621
00:59:34,223 --> 00:59:36,765
<i>-Okay, Carlitos.
-Yeah, Carlitos.</i>

622
00:59:36,848 --> 00:59:40,473
<i>We can barely fit 27 of us
But that's all right</i>

623
00:59:40,556 --> 00:59:43,848
<i>While we're all cramped in here
Up in the presidential suite, they're fine</i>

624
00:59:46,431 --> 00:59:48,765
<i>While a terrible tragedy unfolds</i>

625
00:59:48,848 --> 00:59:52,556
<i>I want to escape
Yet I see many heroes without capes</i>

626
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,056
<i>Aww.</i>

627
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,431
<i>And although sometimes
Anger overtakes me</i>

628
00:59:56,515 --> 00:59:59,390
<i>Standing by your side
Truly strengthens me</i>

629
00:59:59,473 --> 01:00:00,848
<i>-Deep!
-Oh!</i>

630
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,556
<i>Even though we're now freezing to death
On this plane</i>

631
01:00:04,431 --> 01:00:06,598
<i>I have Coco's warm feet here
And can't complain</i>

632
01:00:08,015 --> 01:00:10,556
<i>But, Coco
Don't get used to this situation</i>

633
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,931
<i>We gotta get back to Uruguay
Our beloved nation</i>

634
01:00:13,015 --> 01:00:15,556
<i>-That's right!
-Come on, Coco. Go.</i>

635
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,473
<i>Okay, but mine's kinda sentimental.</i>

636
01:00:18,598 --> 01:00:21,390
<i>On October thirteenth
My mother's birthday I did miss</i>

637
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,473
<i>So I humbly ask God</i>

638
01:00:24,348 --> 01:00:25,973
<i>To finally come home</i>

639
01:00:26,473 --> 01:00:28,431
<i>So I can give her a big kiss</i>

640
01:00:28,515 --> 01:00:29,890
<i>-Very sweet.
-Nice.</i>

641
01:00:31,556 --> 01:00:33,556
<i>There are some decent people
In this space</i>

642
01:00:34,265 --> 01:00:36,931
<i>Yet some know not the candidates
For the presidential race</i>

643
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:39,556
<i>They are a tremendous disgrace</i>

644
01:00:41,431 --> 01:00:43,806
<i>-That was awful!
-That's terrible!</i>

645
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,890
<i>-All right.
-Terrible. The worst.</i>

646
01:00:45,973 --> 01:00:47,265
<i>At least I tried, you know?</i>

647
01:00:47,348 --> 01:00:49,140
<i>You guys didn't do anything.</i>

648
01:00:49,223 --> 01:00:51,806
<i>Here in the mountains
The situation's intense</i>

649
01:00:52,806 --> 01:00:55,598
<i>It makes me wanna start running
Like a puma</i>

650
01:00:56,098 --> 01:00:58,098
<i>But I will not leave this place</i>

651
01:00:58,181 --> 01:01:00,681
<i>Without first hearing a rhyme
From the reserved Numa</i>

652
01:01:04,723 --> 01:01:06,431
<i>Uh…</i>

653
01:01:06,515 --> 01:01:09,223
<i>On, uh, this extremely freezing mountain</i>

654
01:01:09,973 --> 01:01:12,556
<i>Where… not even a spider can walk</i>

655
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:18,181
<i>In the… in the fridge</i>

656
01:01:19,181 --> 01:01:22,056
<i>On the mountain of the frozen fridge</i>

657
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,348
<i>Forget it.</i>

658
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,515
<i>Of the mountain… All right.</i>

659
01:01:26,598 --> 01:01:27,765
<i>Bravo! Good!</i>

660
01:01:27,848 --> 01:01:28,848
<i>Come on, Numa!</i>

661
01:01:30,265 --> 01:01:31,765
<i>Bravo!</i>

662
01:01:32,431 --> 01:01:35,640
<i>Hey, I tried.</i>

663
01:02:34,306 --> 01:02:35,306
<i>Roy!</i>

664
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:54,806
<i>Roy!</i>

665
01:02:56,556 --> 01:03:00,265
<i>-Down there! Down there!
-Here! I'm here!</i>

666
01:03:00,348 --> 01:03:03,140
<i>Dig!</i>

667
01:03:06,056 --> 01:03:07,306
<i>Fito!</i>

668
01:03:08,973 --> 01:03:10,515
<i>-Tintín!
-Hey!</i>

669
01:03:10,598 --> 01:03:12,598
<i>-Hold on!
-Hold on!</i>

01:03:12,681 --> 01:03:15,723
<i>Hold on! Hold on!
Hold on! We're getting you out!</i>

671
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:20,056
<i>-Coche, help.
-Get him out!</i>

672
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,515
<i>-Dig! Come on!
-Hold on!</i>

673
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:23,848
<i>Hold on!</i>

674
01:03:25,181 --> 01:03:26,515
<i>Everyone, dig! Dig!</i>

675
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:33,140
<i>Help! Help! Help!</i>

676
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:35,265
<i>Hang in there, Numa!</i>

677
01:03:35,348 --> 01:03:39,806
<i>Numa, I'll get you out!</i>

678
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:45,890
<i>No! Coco!</i>

679
01:03:51,556 --> 01:03:52,723
<i>-Over here!
-Coco!</i>

680
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,140
<i>Liliana's down there!
Don't step on her!</i>

681
01:03:56,223 --> 01:03:58,431
<i>Watch out! Liliana's down there!
For God's sake!</i>

682
01:03:58,515 --> 01:04:01,306
<i>Please, don't step on her!
Liliana's there!</i>

683
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:04,931
<i>Liliana, hold on! Don't step on her!
Liliana's down there! Please!</i>

684
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:07,681
<i>Don't step on her! Baby, I'll get you out!</i>

685
01:04:07,765 --> 01:04:08,765
<i>She's here!</i>

686
01:04:08,848 --> 01:04:10,681
<i>Coco! No!</i>

01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,973
<i>Breathe! Breathe! Breathe!</i>

690
01:04:21,056 --> 01:04:23,140
<i>Breathe, baby. Breathe.</i>

691
01:04:23,223 --> 01:04:26,640
<i>Breathe! Oh God!
Breathe, baby. Please.</i>

692
01:04:26,723 --> 01:04:29,140
<i>Breathe. Oh, baby. Just breathe.</i>

693
01:04:29,223 --> 01:04:31,265
<i>-He's not breathing!
-Breathe.</i>

694
01:04:31,348 --> 01:04:32,306
<i>Hold on!</i>

695
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:34,223
<i>Please breathe.</i>

696
01:04:34,306 --> 01:04:37,681
<i>No, my love, don't go.</i>

697
01:04:43,181 --> 01:04:44,348
<i>What's that noise?</i>

698
01:04:44,431 --> 01:04:46,765
<i>What's happening?
What's happening?</i>

699
01:04:46,848 --> 01:04:47,848
<i>What is that?</i>

700
01:05:13,473 --> 01:05:14,640
<i>Come on.</i>

701
01:05:16,765 --> 01:05:18,681
<i>-There's air.
-Oxygen's coming in.</i>

702
01:05:18,765 --> 01:05:20,223
<i>-There's air.
-Yes.</i>

703
01:05:22,223 --> 01:05:23,556
<i>Is everyone okay?</i>

704
01:05:24,056 --> 01:05:26,515
<i>-Arturo?
-I'm alive!</i>

705
01:05:26,598 --> 01:05:28,640
<i>Javier's alive. Liliana's gone.</i>

706
01:05:28,723 --> 01:05:30,640
<i>-Vasco?
-Right here. I'm alive.</i>

707
01:05:30,723 --> 01:05:33,556
<i>-I'm alive too! It's Roberto.
-Yeah, I'm alive! It's Moncho.</i>

708
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,140
<i>Pedro Algorta here.</i>

709
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:37,265
<i>Diego? Diego?</i>

710
01:05:37,348 --> 01:05:38,973
<i>Diego's dead, Fito!</i>

711
01:05:39,848 --> 01:05:41,556
<i>He's gone. And Roque. Roque too.</i>

712
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,765
<i>Maspons couldn't make it.</i>

713
01:05:42,848 --> 01:05:45,848
<i>-It's Nando. I'm alive.
-Enrique and Juan Carlos are dead.</i>

714
01:05:45,931 --> 01:05:47,390
<i>-Tintín, you okay?
-I'm here.</i>

715
01:05:47,473 --> 01:05:48,598
<i>Coco?</i>

716
01:05:49,431 --> 01:05:52,348
<i>-Coco?
-Coco's dead. This is Roy.</i>

717
01:05:52,431 --> 01:05:55,473
<i>-And Marcelo? Marcelo?
-Marcelo!</i>

718
01:05:55,556 --> 01:05:57,015
<i>-Marcelo!
-Marcelo!</i>

719
01:05:57,098 --> 01:05:59,098
<i>-Marcelo?
-Captain!</i>

720
01:05:59,181 --> 01:06:00,431
<i>Marcelo!</i>

721
01:06:09,515 --> 01:06:11,973
<i>Marcelo was buried.</i>

722
01:06:14,348 --> 01:06:17,431
<i>He stopped feeling cold
because he didn't feel anything.</i>

723
01:06:19,598 --> 01:06:21,765
<i>And to stop feeling here is a relief.</i>

724
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:28,015
<i>For 17 days,
we've waited for a moment like that.</i>

725
01:06:30,348 --> 01:06:32,056
<i>A moment of calm.</i>

726
01:06:35,015 --> 01:06:36,890
<i>A second of quiet.</i>

727
01:06:56,473 --> 01:07:00,181
<i>-How much snow could we have on top?
-It could be the entire mountain.</i>

728
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:04,140
<i>Everyone, pray! Right now!</i>

729
01:07:04,223 --> 01:07:06,640
<i>"And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus."</i>

730
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:10,015
<i>Today is October 30th.</i>

731
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:12,515
<i>Today is my birthday.</i>

732
01:07:14,306 --> 01:07:15,806
<i>I'm turning 25.</i>

733
01:07:19,848 --> 01:07:22,140
<i>Today it's hard
not to think of home.</i>

734
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:51,181
<i>If light comes in,
we shouldn't be too deep in the snow.</i>

735
01:08:21,348 --> 01:08:23,015
<i>How long do you think we'll be here?</i>

736
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:25,890
<i>We can't go out until the storm's over.</i>

737
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:49,848
<i>DAY 18
TWO DAYS BURIED</i>

738
01:08:55,723 --> 01:08:57,723
<i>The hunger is unbearable.</i>

739
01:09:01,723 --> 01:09:06,556
<i>Till now, the Strauch cousins
have been able to make the meat just meat.</i>

740
01:09:07,848 --> 01:09:09,306
<i>Meat without a name.</i>

741
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:11,806
<i>Without a face.</i>

742
01:09:14,431 --> 01:09:16,181
<i>But that's impossible here.</i>

743
01:09:19,848 --> 01:09:23,848
<i>So what?
Are we gonna do nothing?</i>

744
01:09:35,181 --> 01:09:36,223
<i>Roberto.</i>

745
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:44,306
<i>To survive, we gotta eat.</i>

746
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:45,598
<i>Now you're letting yourselves die?</i>

747
01:10:50,265 --> 01:10:51,765
<i>After all we've been through?</i>

748
01:11:54,015 --> 01:11:56,431
<i>We gotta get out. I'm not staying here!</i>

749
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,223
<i>We gotta get out!</i>

750
01:12:02,515 --> 01:12:04,723
<i>What else do you want?</i>

751
01:12:04,806 --> 01:12:06,098
<i>Stop, Numa!</i>

752
01:12:06,181 --> 01:12:07,181
<i>Come on!</i>

753
01:12:08,056 --> 01:12:09,098
<i>Stop it, Numa!</i>

754
01:12:10,973 --> 01:12:12,390
<i>Numa!</i>

755
01:12:26,681 --> 01:12:32,431
<i>DAY 20
FOUR DAYS BURIED</i>

756
01:12:56,223 --> 01:12:59,181
<i>I see the sky!</i>

757
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:03,681
<i>Come on, Moncho. Go first. You're smaller.</i>

758
01:13:03,765 --> 01:13:06,098
<i>Go. Go, go, go.</i>

759
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:24,181
<i>The sun!</i>

760
01:13:25,931 --> 01:13:27,765
<i>Help me! Come on!</i>

761
01:13:53,848 --> 01:13:54,973
<i>We made it.</i>

762
01:13:59,181 --> 01:14:01,765
<i>Hey! What do you see?</i>

763
01:14:02,348 --> 01:14:04,098
<i>Margarita's out here, Álvaro.</i>

764
01:14:04,181 --> 01:14:06,556
<i>-Your girlfriend!
-In a bikini!</i>

765
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,848
<i>Tell her I'll be right up!</i>

766
01:14:08,931 --> 01:14:12,098
<i>-We're alive!
-We made it!</i>

767
01:14:23,306 --> 01:14:24,390
<i>Hey! Come on!</i>

768
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:46,098
<i>The bottle. The bottle.</i>

769
01:14:58,473 --> 01:15:00,056
<i>How's the leg?</i>

770
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:04,140
<i>It's okay.
It's just a cut. I'll be fine.</i>

771
01:15:04,223 --> 01:15:05,973
<i>Save your energy, Numa.</i>

772
01:15:07,223 --> 01:15:08,723
<i>'Cause I don't have any left.</i>

773
01:15:08,806 --> 01:15:10,640
<i>Don't say that, Arturo.</i>

774
01:15:13,306 --> 01:15:14,181
<i>Don't lose your faith.</i>

775
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:17,598
<i>I have more faith
than I ever had in my whole life.</i>

776
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:20,931
<i>What, are you an altar boy now?</i>

777
01:15:21,015 --> 01:15:23,723
<i>Don't laugh at me.</i>

778
01:15:30,973 --> 01:15:32,306
<i>'Cause my faith…</i>

779
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,306
<i>Sorry, Numa.</i>

780
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:37,806
<i>…isn't in your God.</i>

781
01:15:41,265 --> 01:15:42,515
<i>Because that God</i>

782
01:15:44,098 --> 01:15:46,306
<i>tells me what I'm supposed to do at home.</i>

783
01:15:48,473 --> 01:15:51,056
<i>But he doesn't tell me
what to do on the mountain.</i>

784
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:56,848
<i>What's happening here
is a completely different situation.</i>

785
01:15:59,015 --> 01:15:59,973
<i>Numa.</i>

786
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,473
<i>This is my heaven.</i>

787
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:05,848
<i>I believe in another god.</i>

788
01:16:08,181 --> 01:16:09,348
<i>I believe</i>

789
01:16:10,681 --> 01:16:13,515
<i>in the god that Roberto
keeps inside his head</i>

790
01:16:14,431 --> 01:16:16,681
<i>when he comes to heal each of my wounds.</i>

791
01:16:20,181 --> 01:16:22,681
<i>In the god that Nando keeps in his legs</i>

792
01:16:24,515 --> 01:16:27,015
<i>and that lets him continue walking
no matter what.</i>

793
01:16:32,931 --> 01:16:34,806
<i>I believe in Daniel's hands…</i>

794
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:38,390
<i>when he cuts the meat.</i>

795
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,598
<i>And Fito, when he gives it to us</i>

796
01:16:44,473 --> 01:16:47,098
<i>without saying which of our friends
it belonged to.</i>

797
01:16:48,181 --> 01:16:50,015
<i>That way, we can eat it without…</i>

798
01:16:54,098 --> 01:16:56,056
<i>without having to remember their faces.</i>

799
01:17:00,181 --> 01:17:01,806
<i>That's the god I believe in.</i>

800
01:17:04,556 --> 01:17:06,181
<i>I believe in Roberto.</i>

801
01:17:07,848 --> 01:17:08,973
<i>In Nando.</i>

802
01:17:11,931 --> 01:17:12,931
<i>In Daniel.</i>

803
01:17:14,806 --> 01:17:16,098
<i>In Fito.</i>

804
01:17:19,473 --> 01:17:21,140
<i>And in our dead friends.</i>

805
01:17:26,056 --> 01:17:28,015
<i>You're a philosopher, Arturo.</i>

806
01:17:30,806 --> 01:17:32,306
<i>Altar boy and philosopher.</i>

807
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,140
<i>Okay.</i>

808
01:17:51,223 --> 01:17:53,098
<i>-Come on!
-We have to go now.</i>

809
01:17:54,223 --> 01:17:56,556
<i>-Look at the sun.
-We need to wait.</i>

810
01:17:57,056 --> 01:17:59,681
<i>-Wait for what?
-To be prepared.</i>

811
01:18:00,473 --> 01:18:02,223
<i>What if we get caught in a storm?</i>

812
01:18:02,973 --> 01:18:04,765
<i>We need temperatures to rise.</i>

813
01:18:04,848 --> 01:18:06,931
<i>We can't spend a single night
out in the open.</i>

814
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:08,848
<i>Tell him, Numa.</i>

815
01:18:09,765 --> 01:18:11,473
<i>The thaw starts on November 15th.</i>

816
01:18:11,556 --> 01:18:13,931
<i>There's a lower risk of storms
because temperatures rise.</i>

817
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:18,015
<i>-Two weeks… just waiting.
-No. Two weeks of preparation.</i>

818
01:18:19,223 --> 01:18:22,348
<i>So far, we've always gone out
without a plan, and we've failed.</i>

819
01:18:23,056 --> 01:18:25,223
<i>We don't even know
what kind of distance we're facing.</i>

820
01:18:26,098 --> 01:18:26,931
<i>Hey!</i>

821
01:18:28,098 --> 01:18:29,556
<i>We need help over here!</i>

822
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,265
<i>-Go grab those chairs!
-Come on. Dig</i>

823
01:18:32,348 --> 01:18:33,390
<i>Come help.</i>

824
01:18:35,015 --> 01:18:37,598
<i>All good? Grab those plates.</i>

825
01:18:37,681 --> 01:18:39,931
<i>-Yeah? Let's go.
-Need help?</i>

826
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:42,140
<i>-How can I help?
-Dig on the other side.</i>

827
01:18:55,556 --> 01:18:58,681
<i>I don't get it.
I thought you didn't wanna die here.</i>

828
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:09,473
<i>DAY 34
THE THAW BEGINS</i>

829
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:21,098
<i>Help me, Roberto. Give me a hand.</i>

830
01:19:21,181 --> 01:19:23,515
<i>Watch it. Hold his head, please.</i>

831
01:19:23,598 --> 01:19:26,890
<i>Very slowly. Lift him. There you go.</i>

832
01:19:26,973 --> 01:19:29,223
<i>Slowly. Slowly. Slowly.</i>

833
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,431
<i>Easy, easy, Arturo. That's it.</i>

834
01:19:32,515 --> 01:19:35,223
<i>Let's lift his shirt up slowly.
That's it.</i>

835
01:19:43,765 --> 01:19:45,098
<i>Arturo's really sick.</i>

836
01:19:45,765 --> 01:19:48,806
<i>He's got three days. Vasco, maybe five.</i>

837
01:19:49,473 --> 01:19:50,390
<i>What do you think?</i>

838
01:19:50,473 --> 01:19:51,681
<i>About what?</i>

839
01:19:52,181 --> 01:19:54,848
<i>-The days they have left.
-What do you want, Gustavo?</i>

840
01:19:54,931 --> 01:19:56,973
<i>Say it.</i>

841
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:59,306
<i>What is it?</i>

842
01:20:02,181 --> 01:20:05,015
<i>Roberto, there's nothing more
we can do here as doctors.</i>

843
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:09,181
<i>We're gonna end up becoming gravediggers.</i>

844
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,098
<i>Now, I know how hard it is.</i>

845
01:20:14,056 --> 01:20:16,306
<i>But you're the strongest player
on the team.</i>

846
01:20:17,723 --> 01:20:19,556
<i>Now you have to walk for everyone else.</i>

847
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:27,473
<i>Pass it!</i>

848
01:20:29,348 --> 01:20:30,806
<i>Roberto, pass it!</i>

849
01:20:31,306 --> 01:20:34,015
<i>Careful. Over there.</i>

850
01:20:34,098 --> 01:20:36,890
<i>Move him.</i>

851
01:20:40,598 --> 01:20:41,848
<i>Let's put him here.</i>

852
01:20:49,931 --> 01:20:53,056
<i>I'm here. I'm here. Breathe, Arturo.
Breathe with me. Come on.</i>

853
01:20:53,806 --> 01:20:56,556
<i>Arturo Nogueira's lungs
are filled with fluid.</i>

854
01:20:57,681 --> 01:20:58,806
<i>He can't hold on.</i>

855
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:01,765
<i>There you go. There you go.</i>

856
01:21:01,848 --> 01:21:05,431
<i>-Gustavo tries to help.
-That's it. There you go. There you go.</i>

857
01:21:07,181 --> 01:21:08,681
<i>But no one can breathe for him.</i>

858
01:21:08,765 --> 01:21:11,723
<i>Good job. Good job.</i>

859
01:21:15,848 --> 01:21:19,973
<i>There you go. There you go.</i>

860
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:02,098
<i>We have to try everything.</i>

861
01:22:11,015 --> 01:22:12,640
<i>Four of us volunteer.</i>

862
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:18,640
<i>We head downhill towards Argentina.</i>

863
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:23,098
<i>With warmer clothes…
in the hope of surviving a night outside.</i>

864
01:22:23,181 --> 01:22:24,848
<i>DAY 36
EXPEDITION EAST, ARGENTINA</i>

865
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:02,556
<i>Numa!</i>

866
01:23:11,473 --> 01:23:13,140
<i>Ow.</i>

867
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:17,515
<i>Numa, you okay?</i>

868
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:25,390
<i>It's infected.</i>

869
01:23:32,806 --> 01:23:33,973
<i>Let's go back.</i>

870
01:23:35,765 --> 01:23:37,015
<i>We can't carry him.</i>

871
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,640
<i>-Roberto!
-I'm going back alone.</i>

872
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:48,931
<i>The plane's still close.</i>

873
01:23:55,598 --> 01:23:56,765
<i>Okay.</i>

874
01:24:01,931 --> 01:24:02,973
<i>Sorry.</i>

875
01:24:34,848 --> 01:24:37,848
<i>-What happened?
-Numa?</i>

876
01:24:37,931 --> 01:24:39,015
<i>Numa?</i>

877
01:24:39,098 --> 01:24:41,056
<i>Where are the others?</i>

878
01:24:42,056 --> 01:24:43,848
<i>Numa, answer me. Say something.</i>

879
01:24:43,931 --> 01:24:45,723
<i>It's okay. We're here.</i>

880
01:24:45,806 --> 01:24:46,973
<i>What happened?</i>

881
01:24:53,265 --> 01:24:55,265
<i>Where is he? My dad!</i>

882
01:24:55,348 --> 01:24:57,806
<i>-No, Vasco. We're here.
-Dad?</i>

883
01:24:57,890 --> 01:24:59,931
<i>-Calm down. We're here.
-Where's Dad?</i>

884
01:25:00,015 --> 01:25:03,181
<i>Look at me.
Look at me. Your dad's here.</i>

885
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:06,473
<i>Look at me. We're here. We're here.</i>

886
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,681
<i>-Dad! Dad, come here!
-Stop.</i>

887
01:25:16,181 --> 01:25:17,473
<i>Calm down.</i>

888
01:25:18,598 --> 01:25:19,848
<i>We're here.</i>

889
01:25:21,223 --> 01:25:22,556
<i>Vasco.</i>

890
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,265
<i>-Hey, Vasco! Look at me!
-Dad!</i>

891
01:25:28,181 --> 01:25:32,181
<i>Flight 328,
we are now boarding at gate ten.</i>

892
01:25:32,265 --> 01:25:35,765
<i>-Thanks.
-Rafael… Rafael Echevarren.</i>

893
01:25:35,848 --> 01:25:37,265
<i>Huh? Echavarren!</i>

894
01:26:04,598 --> 01:26:06,181
<i>I don't understand, Javier.</i>

895
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:09,431
<i>From the very first moment
we crashed in this place,</i>

896
01:26:09,515 --> 01:26:11,556
<i>I've tried to help as much as I could.</i>

897
01:26:13,556 --> 01:26:14,598
<i>I tried…</i>

898
01:26:16,473 --> 01:26:18,556
<i>to always do the right thing, you know?</i>

899
01:26:22,515 --> 01:26:24,640
<i>And now, with my leg like this…</i>

900
01:26:28,681 --> 01:26:29,973
<i>I'm useless.</i>

901
01:26:34,806 --> 01:26:36,390
<i>What does it all mean?</i>

902
01:26:37,306 --> 01:26:39,598
<i>What's the meaning of the death of Arturo?</i>

903
01:26:39,681 --> 01:26:43,265
<i>The death of Vasco?
Or the death of everybody else?</i>

904
01:26:51,056 --> 01:26:53,806
<i>Liliana gave everything. Always.</i>

905
01:26:58,181 --> 01:27:01,056
<i>During the avalanche,
while buried under the snow,</i>

906
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:03,598
<i>I could feel her body underneath mine.</i>

907
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:11,473
<i>I remember there was only a few inches
between me and the surface.</i>

908
01:27:11,556 --> 01:27:13,848
<i>I could actually pull my head out, and…</i>

909
01:27:13,931 --> 01:27:16,515
<i>and shout at her
with all my strength I had.</i>

910
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:18,431
<i>"Liliana, hold on!"</i>

911
01:27:18,515 --> 01:27:20,431
<i>"I'll get you out. I'm alive, love."</i>

912
01:27:21,681 --> 01:27:23,473
<i>I saw them stepping over where she was,</i>

913
01:27:23,556 --> 01:27:27,098
<i>and I shouted, "Oh, my God!
Don't step on her! Don't!"</i>

914
01:27:27,181 --> 01:27:29,973
<i>"Don't step on her, please!
Liliana's trapped below."</i>

915
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:36,556
<i>But there was simply no way to get her out
if I didn't get out first.</i>

916
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:43,098
<i>But I was unable to move because my feet
were pressed against her chest.</i>

917
01:27:45,098 --> 01:27:49,056
<i>And if I pushed against her,
it would make her sink deeper and deeper.</i>

918
01:27:55,098 --> 01:27:57,181
<i>What is the meaning of that, Numa?</i>

919
01:28:01,931 --> 01:28:07,098
<i>When we finally got to Liliana,
she was just a lifeless corpse.</i>

920
01:28:07,806 --> 01:28:10,431
<i>At that moment,
as they kept digging up friends,</i>

921
01:28:10,515 --> 01:28:13,556
<i>one dead, one alive, one dead, one alive…</i>

922
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:19,098
<i>then… I hugged Liliana
with all my strength.</i>

923
01:28:20,681 --> 01:28:23,931
<i>And I felt a love
I'd never felt in my life.</i>

924
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:33,390
<i>And I realized that I had a purpose,</i>

925
01:28:35,181 --> 01:28:39,390
<i>which was to take that love that
I was squeezing there against my chest…</i>

926
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:43,348
<i>and bring it to my kids back home.</i>

927
01:28:46,931 --> 01:28:48,806
<i>Her death was not in vain.</i>

928
01:28:53,681 --> 01:28:55,640
<i>That wound doesn't make you useless.</i>

929
01:29:32,806 --> 01:29:34,431
<i>Someone ripped
all the parts off.</i>

930
01:29:35,723 --> 01:29:37,681
<i>-Are you serious?
-Are you helping?</i>

931
01:29:37,765 --> 01:29:39,056
<i>Nando?</i>

932
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:41,765
<i>They told me you've got lazy.</i>

933
01:29:42,265 --> 01:29:45,056
<i>That you sleep all day. Why?</i>

934
01:29:46,015 --> 01:29:48,556
<i>-You need to train, Numa.
-Why are you here?</i>

935
01:29:49,306 --> 01:29:50,931
<i>You're not gonna believe this.</i>

936
01:29:51,723 --> 01:29:55,348
<i>We walked for about
two, three hours, towards the east.</i>

937
01:29:57,181 --> 01:30:00,848
<i>Until, suddenly,
behind a hill, we found the tail.</i>

938
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:04,098
<i>I can't believe we found it.</i>

939
01:30:05,431 --> 01:30:07,390
<i>It… it catapulted itself forward.</i>

940
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:10,140
<i>To the other side.</i>

941
01:30:11,015 --> 01:30:12,223
<i>It was amazing.</i>

942
01:30:12,723 --> 01:30:15,390
<i>It was completely full
of scattered suitcases, clean coats.</i>

943
01:30:16,265 --> 01:30:17,890
<i>We found bottles of rum.</i>

944
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:20,640
<i>Cigarettes.</i>

945
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,806
<i>And chocolate.</i>

946
01:30:31,431 --> 01:30:33,806
<i>Stop, stop, stop, stop. Not the wrapper.</i>

947
01:30:35,765 --> 01:30:39,681
<i>Now you're telling me
what to eat, man?</i>

948
01:30:40,515 --> 01:30:41,515
<i>There you go.</i>

949
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:43,473
<i>Mm!</i>

950
01:30:49,390 --> 01:30:50,890
<i>You were right, Numa.</i>

951
01:30:50,973 --> 01:30:55,556
<i>We spent a night out in the open,
and we almost didn't make it.</i>

952
01:30:58,848 --> 01:31:00,931
<i>But we found the plane's batteries.</i>

953
01:31:03,723 --> 01:31:05,181
<i>They were in the tail.</i>

954
01:31:10,015 --> 01:31:12,140
<i>It'll be much easier
to bring the radio here.</i>

955
01:31:14,431 --> 01:31:16,348
<i>Did you see Roy fixed the portable radio?</i>

956
01:31:16,431 --> 01:31:19,348
<i>And Roberto thinks he can get
that one in the plane to work too.</i>

957
01:31:21,223 --> 01:31:22,973
<i>We're going back down there.</i>

958
01:31:24,015 --> 01:31:25,223
<i>We need to try.</i>

959
01:31:50,015 --> 01:31:53,890
<i>Nando, Roberto and Tintín leave
with Roy towards the tail of the plane.</i>

960
01:31:58,556 --> 01:32:00,223
<i>I wish I could go with them.</i>

961
01:32:04,806 --> 01:32:07,556
<i>Roy is weak and doesn't think
the radio will work.</i>

962
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,973
<i>Come on, Roy. Not a lot of time.</i>

963
01:32:10,556 --> 01:32:11,973
<i>He's terrified.</i>

964
01:32:13,515 --> 01:32:15,181
<i>But he's doing it for the team.</i>

965
01:32:24,723 --> 01:32:27,890
<i>-I don't believe it.
-Nice, Roy.</i>

966
01:32:37,098 --> 01:32:39,890
<i>-1-C-6-0-1.
-Which one is it?</i>

967
01:32:39,973 --> 01:32:42,431
<i>B… Not this one. What was it?</i>

968
01:32:42,515 --> 01:32:43,598
<i>Uh…</i>

969
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:45,890
<i>-One, seven.
-Seven…</i>

970
01:32:45,973 --> 01:32:47,056
<i>What if it doesn't work?</i>

971
01:32:48,306 --> 01:32:49,181
<i>Huh?</i>

972
01:32:49,681 --> 01:32:50,973
<i>What do we do?</i>

973
01:32:51,056 --> 01:32:52,723
<i>I guess we start walking back.</i>

974
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:55,348
<i>Right, Roberto?</i>

975
01:32:56,098 --> 01:32:58,140
<i>Toward the west. To Chile.</i>

976
01:33:02,306 --> 01:33:03,431
<i>Hello?</i>

977
01:33:05,473 --> 01:33:06,348
<i>Hello?</i>

978
01:33:08,056 --> 01:33:10,598
<i>We're the Uruguayans
who crash-landed in the Andes.</i>

979
01:33:10,681 --> 01:33:13,223
<i>Can you hear me? We're still here!</i>

980
01:33:14,223 --> 01:33:15,223
<i>Hello?</i>

981
01:33:19,973 --> 01:33:20,806
<i>Hello?</i>

982
01:33:28,848 --> 01:33:30,973
<i>Uh, I don't know. I never tried it.</i>

983
01:33:36,306 --> 01:33:39,848
<i>With every day that passes,
we lose more of our strength.</i>

984
01:33:44,473 --> 01:33:46,598
<i>It's okay.</i>

985
01:33:46,681 --> 01:33:50,515
<i>The food rations aren't enough,
so we strip the bones of meat.</i>

986
01:33:52,265 --> 01:33:56,265
<i>What was once unthinkable
became routine.</i>

987
01:33:56,348 --> 01:33:58,681
<i>…number
of intercontinental ballistic missiles</i>

988
01:33:58,765 --> 01:34:00,390
<i>and other strategic offensive arms.</i>

989
01:34:00,473 --> 01:34:02,223
<i>We just stopped caring.</i>

990
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:06,140
<i>Come on.</i>

991
01:34:07,806 --> 01:34:09,306
<i>Here. Eat a little.</i>

992
01:34:11,765 --> 01:34:12,890
<i>You have to eat, Numa.</i>

993
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:29,598
<i>Half and half.</i>

994
01:34:32,473 --> 01:34:33,515
<i>You can't give up now.</i>

995
01:34:34,306 --> 01:34:36,306
<i>No, I'm not givin' up, Pancho.</i>

996
01:34:37,390 --> 01:34:38,640
<i>You know, I'm dying.</i>

997
01:34:46,223 --> 01:34:47,348
<i>And it hurts me to not…</i>

998
01:34:48,973 --> 01:34:50,681
<i>not be able to do more for you.</i>

999
01:34:50,765 --> 01:34:52,140
<i>Don't say that.</i>

1000
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:54,890
<i>Think of yourself.</i>

1001
01:34:56,973 --> 01:34:58,640
<i>You want me to think of myself?</i>

1002
01:35:02,306 --> 01:35:03,515
<i>Look at me.</i>

1003
01:35:03,598 --> 01:35:05,848
<i>I'm 25 years old, Pancho.</i>

1004
01:35:06,806 --> 01:35:10,223
<i>I've got my enitre life ahead.
I've got everything left to do.</i>

1005
01:35:11,515 --> 01:35:15,140
<i>I want to… see my siblings again.</i>

1006
01:35:15,223 --> 01:35:17,015
<i>See my mother, my father.</i>

1007
01:35:17,806 --> 01:35:19,181
<i>I want to dance.</i>

<i>-Numa, you don't dance.
-I know.</i>

1009
01:35:22,931 --> 01:35:24,098
<i>But now I want to.</i>

1010
01:35:25,223 --> 01:35:26,973
<i>I wanna do it all, Pancho.</i>

1011
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:30,181
<i>I want to laugh.</i>

1012
01:35:30,265 --> 01:35:32,890
<i>-I want to cry.
-Then cry.</i>

1013
01:35:32,973 --> 01:35:34,431
<i>-I can't.
-Cry.</i>

1014
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:38,265
<i>Do it. Come on, cry.</i>

1015
01:35:39,015 --> 01:35:40,056
<i>Just cry with me.</i>

1016
01:35:40,973 --> 01:35:42,681
<i>What's so funny?</i>

1017
01:35:44,348 --> 01:35:47,056
<i>Cry with me. Come on. Let it go.</i>

1018
01:35:51,723 --> 01:35:53,015
<i>Do it, moron.</i>

1019
01:35:54,848 --> 01:35:55,973
<i>Come on.</i>

1020
01:36:21,515 --> 01:36:22,723
<i>Nando!</i>

1021
01:36:22,806 --> 01:36:23,848
<i>Look at this.</i>

1022
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:31,640
<i>-What's that?
-It's waterproof.</i>

1023
01:36:32,265 --> 01:36:33,598
<i>We can use it, yeah?</i>

1024
01:36:34,806 --> 01:36:36,598
<i>It was covering some pipes.</i>

1025
01:36:36,681 --> 01:36:38,848
<i>-Is there more?
-Yeah. There's a lot.</i>

1026
01:36:38,931 --> 01:36:41,640
<i>Two, four… One, C.</i>

1027
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,390
<i>No!</i>

1028

<i>AS OF TODAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1972,

<i>IN THE URUGUAYAN PLANE

1030
01:37:26,890 --> 01:37:27,931
<i>What happened?</i>

1031
01:37:29,765 --> 01:37:31,140
<i>The radio didn't work.</i>

1032
01:37:32,515 --> 01:37:34,348
<i>But we found this fabric there.</i>

1033
01:37:35,098 --> 01:37:37,890
<i>-What's this?
-It's waterproof.</i>

1034
01:37:39,015 --> 01:37:42,306
<i>-We can make a vest.
-No. Not a vest, Tintín.</i>

1035
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:43,681
<i>Let's make a sleeping bag.</i>

1036
01:37:43,765 --> 01:37:47,640
<i>With a sleeping bag, we could get
through the night. There's enough fabric.</i>

1037
01:37:49,181 --> 01:37:50,681
<i>Or we could make a big one.</i>

1038
01:37:52,056 --> 01:37:53,515
<i>When are we leaving, Roberto?</i>

1039
01:38:00,681 --> 01:38:01,598
<i>Roberto.</i>

1040
01:38:02,806 --> 01:38:03,806
<i>When?</i>

1041
01:38:06,431 --> 01:38:08,098
<i>As soon as the sleeping bag is done.</i>

1042
01:38:08,181 --> 01:38:10,265
<i>58 days after the disappearance</i>

1043
01:38:10,348 --> 01:38:14,306
<i>of the Fairchild 571 aircraft
from the Uruguayan Air Force</i>

1044

<i>chartered to transport a rugby team
from the Old Christians Club</i>

1046
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,848
<i>and their companions to Chile.</i>

1047
01:38:22,931 --> 01:38:27,056
<i>The local Air Force has specially equipped
a C-47 aircraft</i>

1048
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:30,348
<i>to resume the search
in the Andean Mountain Range.</i>

1049
01:38:31,598 --> 01:38:35,140
<i>Come on, Roberto.
We can't go back to the beginning.</i>

1050
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:37,598
<i>They said they'll look for us.</i>

1051
01:38:37,681 --> 01:38:41,181
<i>Those morons who flew right over
and… and didn't see us?</i>

1052
01:38:41,265 --> 01:38:42,931
<i>They're looking for bodies.</i>

1053
01:38:43,015 --> 01:38:46,140
<i>-We've been lost here for two months.
-Two months, Roberto.</i>

1054
01:38:46,223 --> 01:38:48,473
<i>Do you still believe
they think we're alive?</i>

1055
01:38:48,556 --> 01:38:51,181
<i>-Well, we are alive.
-Alive?</i>

1056
01:38:51,265 --> 01:38:54,306
<i>Just look at us. Look at this.</i>

1057
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:56,348
<i>This isn't being alive.</i>

1058
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:58,598
<i>We won't make it
just by praying, you know.</i>

1059
01:38:59,098 --> 01:39:01,556
<i>So you want to climb the mountain
sleeping in this?</i>

1060
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:09,931
<i>What are you doing, Roberto?</i>

1061
01:39:10,515 --> 01:39:12,806
<i>-Stop!
-Roberto.</i>

1062
01:39:13,306 --> 01:39:14,556
<i>You didn't like it?</i>

1063
01:40:26,015 --> 01:40:27,015
<i>Guys.</i>

1064
01:40:27,973 --> 01:40:29,515
<i>I'm gonna take a picture.</i>

1065
01:40:48,306 --> 01:40:50,723
<i>Tintín insists on taking pictures.</i>

1066
01:40:53,473 --> 01:40:57,265
<i>Like he's capturing memories of a trip
that he's comin' back from.</i>

1067
01:41:00,056 --> 01:41:01,848
<i>I wonder who these pictures are for.</i>

1068
01:41:03,806 --> 01:41:04,806
<i>For us?</i>

1069
01:41:05,390 --> 01:41:07,098
<i>Smile, asshole.</i>

1070
01:41:07,181 --> 01:41:08,848
<i>I'll never see them.</i>

1071
01:41:08,931 --> 01:41:10,556
<i>Come on. We can still smile.</i>

1072
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:15,640
<i>Maybe they're for our families.</i>

1073
01:41:15,723 --> 01:41:18,848
<i>Or for other people
who are remembering us now,</i>

1074
01:41:18,931 --> 01:41:21,890
<i>looking at pictures of us
that were taken in the past.</i>

1075
01:41:21,973 --> 01:41:23,390
<i>Carlos. Look at me!</i>

1076
01:41:24,431 --> 01:41:29,181
<i>And when they look at them,
we'll live again in their imaginations.</i>

1077
01:41:29,681 --> 01:41:33,681
<i>Because they'll ask themselves
the same questions we're asking.</i>

1078
01:41:36,848 --> 01:41:39,181
<i>"What happened to them?"</i>

1079
01:41:40,306 --> 01:41:42,890
<i>What happened to us?</i>

1080
01:41:45,681 --> 01:41:47,556
<i>Who were we on the mountain?</i>

1081
01:41:49,473 --> 01:41:50,473
<i>Nando.</i>

1082
01:41:51,765 --> 01:41:56,765
<i>I want you to know that
you have my permission to use my body.</i>

1083
01:41:59,223 --> 01:42:01,390
<i>Stop fucking around. Don't say that.</i>

1084
01:42:03,723 --> 01:42:05,556
<i>I'm know I'm not coming back.</i>

1085
01:42:09,473 --> 01:42:10,598
<i>Don't say that.</i>

1086
01:42:12,098 --> 01:42:13,390
<i>It's the truth.</i>

1087
01:42:18,015 --> 01:42:19,265
<i>But it's all right.</i>

1088
01:42:20,223 --> 01:42:21,890
<i>It's fine. I'm at peace.</i>

1089
01:42:27,431 --> 01:42:29,473
<i>I'm prepared for what's coming.</i>

1090
01:42:31,556 --> 01:42:33,348
<i>We both are, my brother.</i>

1091
01:42:35,390 --> 01:42:40,556
<i>And I'm so happy
to know that you guys are gonna make it.</i>

1092
01:42:44,390 --> 01:42:46,765
<i>That makes me feel very happy, Nando.</i>

1093
01:43:39,306 --> 01:43:40,473
<i>Thank you.</i>

1094
01:43:58,348 --> 01:43:59,765
<i>My name is Numa.</i>

1095
01:44:01,431 --> 01:44:04,723
<i>I died on December 11, 1972.</i>

1096
01:44:06,556 --> 01:44:07,806
<i>In my sleep.</i>

01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:07,348
<i>You can use the bodies

1108
01:46:08,515 --> 01:46:09,598
<i>Let's go!</i>

1109
01:46:09,681 --> 01:46:12,306

01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:14,056
<i>-You got this!
-Good luck!</i>

1111
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:17,348
<i>Come on, guys!
Look both ways before crossing</i>

1112
01:46:17,431 --> 01:46:19,306
<i>and don't forget about us afterwards!</i>

1113
01:46:19,390 --> 01:46:22,098

<i>We have to find a ledge
to put the sleeping bag on!</i>

1118

<i>We have to climb a little more!</i>

1119
01:47:18,181 --> 01:47:20,348
<i>We're not gonna make it up there!</i>

1120
01:47:28,598 --> 01:47:29,598

<i>We're so close now. Look.</i>

1129
01:50:36,181 --> 01:50:39,765
<i>We just need to cross the valley.
How long can it take?</i>

1130
01:50:40,723 --> 01:50:42,056
<i>Ten, twelve days?</i>

1131

<i>You're asking me to die with you.</i>

1136
01:50:59,390 --> 01:51:01,265
<i>I'm asking you to come with me.</i>

1137
01:51:02,806 --> 01:51:05,890
<i>Look. Look over there.
See those two peaks?</i>

1138
01:51:05,973 --> 01:51:08,390
<i>In the middle, like a pair of titties.</i>

heading west.</i>

<i>From above, you can actually see
some lower ridges.</i>

1148

<i>Looks like they have
a sort of brownish color.</i>

1149
