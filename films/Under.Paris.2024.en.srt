11
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,500
{\an8}- That was awful.
- No, go on.

{\an8}- The stats suck.
- No, they don't.

00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,916
We have a signal. Ready to go?

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,083
Go!

22
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:57,291
Head southeast.
Stabilize at six meters and wait.

23
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:00,375
Go, go, go!
Come on, guys, dive in five minutes!

24
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,291
The biopsy darts are loaded.
Just the cameras to go.

25
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,500
They're ready.

26
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,750
Don't break them this time.

27
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,791
For fuck's sake!
Could she find a nastier dive spot?

28
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,125
- Distance?
- Five hundred meters.

29
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,458
She's getting closer.

30
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:31,125
Okay, guys, as usual,
you follow me and stay above me.

31
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,750
Tom, Sam, stay together.

32
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,000
- Juan.
- Yeah?

33
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,291
- With me.
- Okay.

34
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,291
Stabilize at six meters
and wait for Sophia's instructions, okay?

35
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,666
- Yes, Skip.
- Yes, sir.

36
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:49,875
Juanito?

37
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:51,875
Juan?

38
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,125
Starting our descent.

39
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,500
Equalize and stay on course.

40
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,625
We can't miss her this time.

41
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,083
You're in your element. Right, Sam?

42
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,000
Is this your element?

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,083
<i>How are you clowns getting on?</i>

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,000
{\an8}<i>I hope she doesn't bolt.</i>

47

{\an8}Don't worry. I won't let her.

South-southeast.

51
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,708
Okay. We'll keep an eye out.

52
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,708
{\an8}Hang on. Stop.

53
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,291
See that, Sophia?

54
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,750
{\an8}<i>Another baby sperm whale caught in nets.</i>

55
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,875
{\an8}That's two in three weeks.

56
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,666
It must have suffered for days.

57
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,916
I'll check it out. Stay here.

58
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,666
{\an8}Shit, its stomach is filled with plastic.

59
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,000
{\an8}Chris, focus on Beacon 7.

60
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,083
{\an8}<i>Wait.</i>

61
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,875
<i>Do you see that?</i>

62
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
<i>A bite mark.</i>

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,291
{\an8}Yeah, but what could have done that?

64
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,875
Chris, she's closing in, 30 meters.

65
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,333
{\an8}Oh, shit!

66
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,875
{\an8}- Chris?
<i>- Chris, you okay?</i>

67
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,083
Are you okay?

68
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,916
{\an8}<i>I'm fine, but it's not ours.</i>

69
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,833
Others are coming.

70
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,916
When did makos start hunting in packs?

71
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,291
{\an8}<i>What the hell is this?</i>

72
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,833
{\an8}Wait, I don't get it. They're all female.

73
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,875
<i>- How many?
- Did you see their fins?</i>

74
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,000
{\an8}<i>Is that normal? They're huge.</i>

75
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,625
The same hypertrophy as Lilith.

76
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,208
There are about ten. What now?

77
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,333
{\an8}Juan, do you copy?

78
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,791
They seem nervous. Safety protocol.

79
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,166
{\an8}<i>- Sophia...</i>
- Shit.

80
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,375
{\an8}- Stay calm.
<i>- What do we do?</i>

81
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,916
Keep a safe distance.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,083
You guys are safe.

83
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,833
Signal, due south.

84
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,583
<i>Chris, she's coming.</i>

85
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,208
<i>Puta madre,</i> what is that?

86
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,708
<i>Holy shit. Are you sure it's ours?</i>

87
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,791
{\an8}<i>- She's at least five meters long.
- No, that's seven meters.</i>

88
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,250
{\an8}I don't get it. That should be Lilith.

89
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,333
<i>Then it's her.</i>

90
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,791
It can't be. Three months ago,
she was only 2.5 meters!

91
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,791
I'm sure it's her. Look, that's Beacon 7.

92
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,458
<i>So, what do we do?</i>

93
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,458
{\an8}I don't understand.

94
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,916
How is that possible?

95
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,041
Let's go up. It's too dangerous.

96
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,916
Wait! We need a sample.

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,833
<i>Have you seen the size of her?</i>

98
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:58,916
Should I do it?

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,666
Fine, I'll fucking do it.

100
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,666
<i>We have no choice, Chris.
We have to figure this out.</i>

101
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:06,791
<i>It'll be fine.</i>

102
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,583
{\an8}<i>Come at her head on,
so you don't scare her.</i>

103
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,375
<i>You're at a good distance. Easy now.</i>

104
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,458
{\an8}Just a second.

105
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,791
<i>- Gently!
- Shit!</i>

106
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,375
{\an8}- Fuck.
- Are you okay?

107
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,125
{\an8}<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>
- Right, come back.

108
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,208
{\an8}<i>Hear that, guys?
Mission accomplished. Up we go.</i>

109
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,000
Chris, did you shit yourself?

110
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,083
<i>Wait, I think she's coming back.</i>

111
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,583
{\an8}<i>What? Where is she?</i>

112
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,208
Chris?

113
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,458
{\an8}Where the fuck is she? Can you see her?

114
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,333
I just saw her. Where is she?

115
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,458
Chris, what's wrong?

116
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,416
{\an8}- I saw her go past.
- Can you see her?

117
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,000
{\an8}Chris?

118
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,125
I lost the feed!

119
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,291
Chris!

120
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,208
{\an8}Chris...

121
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,583
- Chris!
- Sam!

122
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,750
{\an8}Come back up!

123
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,833
Chris, answer me!

124
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,125
{\an8}Juan! Do you copy?

125
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,083
Sophia!

126
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,875
Sophia!

127
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,416
Sophia, no!

128
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:55,958
Sophia!

129
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,958
Chris!

130
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,750
Sophia!

131
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,083
Get back on the boat!

132
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:22,291
UNDER PARIS

133
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:29,375
3 YEARS LATER

134
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,000
I got something.

135
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,583
Nice.

136
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,833
Let me see if I got anything.

137
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,458
I got something!

138
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,791
Wait.

139
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:53,875
I can't...

140
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,916
- You okay?
- Yeah.

141
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,583
What is it?

142
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,583
<i>Bomb Squad on site.</i>

143
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,791
- Hold on, I'm coming.
- Thanks.

144
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,625
- Everything okay?
- All good.

145
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,708
- Everything go okay?
- Yeah, it's clean.

146
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,708
{\an8}Adama for Caro. Once Adil's done
with the press, we can go.

147
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,916
<i>Okay. Copy that. We'll wait.</i>

148
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,291
Do you often find...

149
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,958
- We're good to go.
- Okay.

150
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,708
...or is it something unusual?

151
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,125
We regularly find shells in the Seine.

152
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,000
With our colleagues
from the Central Laboratory,

153
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,708
we've already recovered 100 or so.

154
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,791
These young men did the right...

155
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,833
<i>- Angèle for Adil.</i>
- Excuse me.

156
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,333
<i>I'll handle the press.</i>

157
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,916
<i>The prefect needs us
for the triathlon briefing.</i>

158
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,083
<i>I'll catch you up.</i>

159
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,583
- Sorry. She'll take over.
- Thanks.

160
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,708
- Hello.
- Hello, Commander.

161
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,250
To reassure you,
there was no ignition system,

162
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,750
so no scaremongering.

163
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,333
- Good job.
- Thanks.

164
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,416
...fishing with magnets is forbidden...

165
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,291
Let's go. Head back to base.
Triathlon briefing.

166
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,708
Let's go.

167
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,708
Sir, kayaking is prohibited!

168
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:24,416
- Okay, relax. Nothing's allowed!
- What's up with them today?

169
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,333
Who'd be willing to dedicate
their lives to protecting whales?

170
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,625
- Me!
- Me!

171
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,916
- Me.
- Me.

172
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:13,000
That's the first question I was asked
when I joined the fight for our oceans.

173
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,583
A world of dead oceans
is a world without us in it.

174
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,958
What is a living ocean?

175
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,833
It's a biodiverse ocean.

176
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,500
That means an ocean full of fish,

177
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,583
as well as algae, coral, and vegetation.

178
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,833
If we cannot save our marine life,

179
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,916
we cannot save ourselves.

180
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,500
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

181
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,750
Can the oceans be saved?

182
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, a man named Paul Watson said...

183
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,750
Did your crew really die
in a shark attack?

184
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,041
- Victor, phones away!
- But...

185
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,125
Now!

186
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,208
- Enough.
- Come on, miss.

187
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,708
I just asked a question.

188
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,041
Look, she's turning red.

189
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,666
Sophia!

190
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,875
Sophia! Mrs. Assalas!

191
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:16,208
I apologize. I'm really sorry
to bother you, but I have to talk to you.

192
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,000
I follow all your work.

193
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,791
- Climate migration...
- Sorry, I don't have time.

194
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,083
Beacon 7!

195
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,625
I know where she is.

196
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,625
Welcome to SOS.

197
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,125
Haven't you heard of it?

198
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,208
It's our ocean conservation group.

199
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,500
When we started,
we didn't think it'd work.

200
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,125
But it's growing. It's serious.

201
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,791
We do what you do.

202
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,333
Well, as best we can.

203
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,625
We've always looked up to you.

204
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,375
We follow your work.

205
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,875
Everything you describe,

206
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,875
how nature triggers
radical changes in behavior...

207
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,666
Plus, to protect sharks,
we connect to researchers' beacons,

208
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,500
and if they are in danger,

209
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,208
if they're tracked by poachers,
we shut the signal down.

210
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,375
Sophia, over here.

211
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,625
Ben.

212
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,458
- Wait. Two seconds.
- What are you doing?

213
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,875
Cutting Ulysse's beacon.
We spotted a trawler.

214
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,041
Where is he?

215
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,125
In Spain.

216
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,500
No shark fishing today, guys!

217
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,666
<i>- Yatta</i>!
- Can you show me?

218
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,291
Beacon 7.

219
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,791
- Ben, Beacon 7.
- Yeah.

220
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,750
- Ben, please. Beacon 7.
- Yes.

221
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,208
Beacon 7...

222
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:05,666
There.

223
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,750
Look.

224
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,166
It's not possible.

225
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,958
Our servers are secure.
It can't be my beacon.

226
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,000
Secure or not,
anything is accessible now. Look.

227
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,458
She pinged in Le Havre three weeks ago.
Then she swam up the Seine.

228
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,666
She's been here three days.
In the heart of Paris.

229
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,125
She can't survive in freshwater.

230
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,625
We thought that since
bull sharks breed in freshwater, it...

231
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,833
It's a mako.

232
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,333
Sophia, you were right.

233
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,458
Climate change and pollution
have changed their behavior.

234
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,208
She's lost and just trying to survive.

235
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,958
If it's my beacon,
it must've come loose and drifted here.

236
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,666
Against the current?

237
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,375
Wouldn't it have sunk?

238
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,333
If we don't help Lilith
reach the sea, she'll die.

239
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,666
We think we can communicate with her.

240
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,000
Have you gone insane?

241
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,000
She's a shark, not a dog.

242
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,000
Dive with us. I'll prove you wrong.

243
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,916
- In the Seine?
- Yes.

244
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,250
We're going tonight.

245
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:17,958
Why did I even come?

246
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,083
There was an accident at Marie Bridge.

247
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,666
The car fell into the water.
The driver's missing.

248
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,291
Sophia!

249
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,875
<i>We only just got here,
and we've seen two amazing whale sharks.</i>

250
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,250
<i>- Right there.
- See that?</i>

251
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,083
<i>There's a third one. Look!</i>

252
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,708
<i>- Oh, yeah!
- It's huge!</i>

253
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,666
<i>Because of the drop-offs...</i>

254
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,500
<i>Bravo! Round of applause!</i>

255
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,250
<i>Three hours working on an engine
that still won't work.</i>

256
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,166
<i>- Let's play foosball.
- Good job.</i>

257
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,416
<i>- Do you wanna fight?
- Wonderful...</i>

258
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,583
<i>Four, three, two, one!</i>

259
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,458
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

260
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,791
<i>Darling, I love you! Make a wish!</i>

261
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,083
<i>This is insane!</i>

262
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,708
<i>Go on, Chris. You're at a good distance.</i>

263
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,000
<i>Just a second.</i>

264
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,666
<i>Chris, I lost the feed!</i>

265
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,625
It can't be.

266
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,291
<i>It's Mika. Leave a message.</i>

267
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,375
Mika!

268
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,375
Mika, it's Sophia.

269
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,458
Call me back.

270
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,416
Come on.

271
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,666
Any trouble, pull the line and run. Okay?

272
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,833
- What about you?
- I'll be fine.

273
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,916
Don't buy me with kisses.

274
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,708
- Any issues, come straight up. Okay?
- Okay.

275
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,083
Come on.

276
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,291
Police!

277
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,833
Get out of the water.

278
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,500
Get out right now!

279
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,791
Why would you dive at night?

280
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,708
Can't I clean the Seine?

281
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:25,833
Clean the Seine?

282
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,625
Yeah.

283
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,250
Whose RIB is that?

284
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:32,500
It's mine.

285
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,791
We'll go to the station.

286
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:40,000
If all goes well, you can go home. Okay?

287
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,458
Nils. Let's stop at Île Saint-Louis.

288
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:45,541
Okay.

289
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,541
Kiki, stay close.

290
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:51,166
How about Roger?

291
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,125
We haven't seen him in ages.

292
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:54,666
Hey, guys. How are you?

293
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,958
Oh, hey!

294
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:56,875
All good?

295
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:59,041
- We brought some things.
- Nice.

296
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,541
Here. This'll suit you!

297
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,833
- That one's priceless!
- Perfect.

298
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,083
Is that your size?

299
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,375
I thought you'd like it.

300
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:10,250
Your colleagues are here.

301
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,333
Reinforcements.

302
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,750
- Ready, Markus?
- Yeah.

303
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,208
Give me some slack.

304
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,083
You good, Adewale?

305
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:21,666
- All good, chief?
- Not bad.

306
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,666
Hey, beautiful. How are you?

307
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,125
Don't mind us, Ade!

308
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,791
Markus, do they have everything?

309
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,541
Yeah, we gave them a hand.

310
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:34,208
It's all good, chief.
Your guys were great.

311
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,833
We'll be out by tomorrow.

312
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:39,833
It'll be three weeks, max.
The city wants it clear for the triathlon.

313
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:43,208
Don't worry.
Kiki and I will have a front-row seat.

314
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:45,375
Perfect. Happy reading!

315
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:46,750
- Thanks.
- See you at HQ?

316
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,458
- Yes.
- See you later.

317
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,000
- Turn.
- Go on the outside.

318
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,208
Go on. Hit the gas.

319
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,750
Hit it.

320
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:18,791
What took you so long?

321
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:23,375
We found her at Marie Bridge
in the water with her gear.

322
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:24,875
Adama, can you deal with her?

323
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,708
I've got all this gear to unload.

324
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,666
- I'll handle it.
- I can help too.

325
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,041
No, Caro, it's okay.

326
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,125
- I'm going. My cell is on.
- Come on.

327
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:35,208
See you tomorrow.

328
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:36,916
Enjoy your evening!

329
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:38,791
Wait. I'll go first.

330
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,166
- Follow me.
- Nils.

331
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,125
Yeah?

332
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:42,416
You still on duty?

333
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,333
Yeah, why?

334
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:44,500
Your vest, please.

335
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:49,333
- This isn't the fire brigade, Smoky!
- It's not the army either.

336
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:51,500
At least soldiers have decent hair.

337
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:09,833
154 SHELLS FROM WORLD WAR II
FOUND UNDER IENA BRIDGE

338
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:17,541
Coffee?

339
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,833
So, can I go home now?

340
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:26,666
- Why were you diving?
- Fuck.

341
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,958
Was it the accident?

342
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,208
Sugar?

343
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:02,416
So...

344
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:04,791
tell me.

345
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,708
Why were you searching the car?

346
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,333
I'm talking to you.

347
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:12,833
- Why were you diving?
- There's a shark in the Seine. Happy?

348
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:16,500
Good. I love wasting my time.

349
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,291
Right. You wanna mess with me.

350
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,916
We can start over from the beginning.

351
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,250
Full name.

352
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,208
Adil.

353
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,291
It's urgent.

354
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:41,208
Come on, sweetie, let's go.

355
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,291
Okay.

356
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:48,333
Look, over there. Little fish!

357
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:51,000
- They're so cute!
- Shit.

358
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:53,791
- Did you see?
- Yeah.

359
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:55,833
Get away from the edge!

360
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:56,833
Get back!

361
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:58,666
You can't talk to kids like that!

362
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:02,791
- Sorry.
- She's lost it.

363
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:03,916
I'm sorry.

364
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,041
- Hello?
- Come on.

365
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:07,791
Yes, that's me.

366
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,583
They're waiting.

367
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,250
Hello.

368
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:24,291
- Sergeant Adil Faez.
- Sophia Assalas.

369
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:25,875
I believe you've met?

370
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:28,875
- Sorry. I told them to call you.
- Let me show you.

371
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:32,125
Adama?

372
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:50,583
Found this morning.

373
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:55,416
Your friend thinks it was a shark.

374
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,333
It was definitely a shark.

375
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,375
Even if it got through the locks,

376
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,083
why would it come to Paris?

377
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:22,791
No idea.

378
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:25,750
You never questioned
the orca or the beluga.

379
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:28,791
Adama!

380
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:29,875
Call Angèle.

381
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:32,458
- Follow me.
- Adama for Angèle.

382
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:34,208
Judicial are here. On our way.

383
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:36,833
<i>Okay, copy that.</i>

384
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,166
It could be a propeller.
It's happened before.

385
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,916
I guarantee they're bites.

386
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:48,125
We were looking for a 2.5-meter shark,
but it had tripled in size.

387
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:50,625
It seems the same shark
is roaming the Seine.

388
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:54,125
- How can you believe such nonsense?
- We've been tracking her.

389
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,375
She'll asphyxiate here. She needs help.

390
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:59,291
Hold on. There are sharks
in the Thames, but...

391
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,750
But they belong there.

392
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:03,958
This shark shouldn't be here.
It isn't normal behavior.

393
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:07,458
We have to get her out,
and we'll need an expert team.

394
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:08,833
It'll be complex.

395
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:10,125
- You'll need...
- Wait!

396
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:13,250
Let's see
if your shark exists first. Okay?

397
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:16,958
Right.

398
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:18,708
Let's go, please.

399
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,916
Leo, Markus? Let's go.

400
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:28,583
- Got a signal?
- Yes.

401
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:32,000
She's at Île de la Cité,
200 meters from Notre-Dame.

402
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,666
You're free to go.

403
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,250
I'm coming with you.

404
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:36,375
Absolutely not.

405
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:37,458
Caro?

406
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,625
Here's the plan...

407
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:40,708
Lieutenant...

408
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,833
I'm a sergeant. Just one second.

409
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:45,291
Regardless,
what you're doing is pointless.

410
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:49,208
My tracker can locate the beacon.
We can ID her from the quays.

411
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:51,208
Markus, the harpoons. Let's go.

412
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,583
Why dive and take unnecessary risks?

413
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:54,666
Listen.

414
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,833
I want to know where it's hiding.

415
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:58,666
If it exists.

416
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,416
Right, move out.

417
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:04,166
- Are you coming?
- This shark could be dangerous.

418
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,375
Even more so if it feels threatened.

419
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:09,833
Mrs. Assalas,
we're the River Police, not Greenpeace.

420
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:14,541
Either show us how to use your tracker
or come with us, but we leave now.

421
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,041
Okay?

422
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:39,791
Ready, guys?

423
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:41,583
See you later.

424
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
800 meters!

425
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:38,916
800 meters.

426
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,125
This is it.

427
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,125
How deep is it?

428
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,125
Five meters.

429
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:24,000
5.7 at the center.

430
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:27,083
At her size, we should see her.

431
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:30,000
Maybe it's because there is no shark.

432
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:33,625
Caro? Guys?

433
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,583
Synchronize your trackers.

434
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:45,000
- I'm good.
- Me too.

435
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,083
- Got them?
- Yes.

436
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:53,208
Flashlights.

437
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,250
Let's go.

438
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:52,791
Anything?

439
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,500
Pick up.

440
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,791
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

441
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,208
Ben, cut her beacon.

442
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:54,791
<i>- They'll kill her.</i>
- If I cut it, we lose her.

443
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,083
<i>What don't you get? We have no choice!</i>

444
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:59,583
You don't get it.
With no signal, it's too dangerous.

445
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:00,500
Free her.

446
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:01,791
<i>- I can't...</i>
- Free her!

447
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:32,458
<i>- I don't know if I can reactivate it.</i>
- Ben, please!

448
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:35,000
Damn, you're a pain.

449
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,333
<i>Hurry. There isn't much time.</i>

450
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:43,875
She's coming.

451
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:06,708
Okay, I shut it down.

452
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:10,250
Yes, we did it.

453
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,291
There's movement.

454
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:23,125
Something's wrong.

455
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:24,583
Shit, the signal...

456
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:26,791
What about the signal? What's wrong?

457
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,291
I don't understand. I lost her.

458
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:32,875
I've got it!

459
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,000
Sarge!

460
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,583
- Caro?
- Sarge!

461
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,416
Hurry. Get back in!

462
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:08,458
Adil, we felt a presence. Something big.

463
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,333
Are you sure?

464
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:13,708
Check the sonar.

465
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:39,416
Caro?

466
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,916
Announce it on channel ten.

467
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Was it you?

468
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:48,500
- What?
- The beacon, was it you?

469
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:50,458
I lost the signal. I don't know why.

470
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,208
- You put my team in danger.
- How can you say that?

471
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:55,750
- I told you not to dive!
- Get her ashore.

472
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:57,333
Don't touch me.

473
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:07,041
Right, back to base.

474
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:22,750
- That was close.
- Why did I listen to you?

475
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,416
- Are you on their side?
- No, but what do we do now?

476
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,958
We get her back to the sea or she dies!

477
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,375
- And if I can't reactivate her beacon?
- Mika!

478
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:33,458
- Why are you here?
- You're reckless.

479
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:34,833
Sophia, they were armed!

480
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:36,458
So? What if she attacked?

481
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:38,583
You know
sharks don't attack for no reason.

482
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:42,583
- Lilith did, and it's not happening again.
- You shouldn't have been there!

483
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,458
It's your fault.

484
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,416
Stay out of this, okay?

485
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:54,916
Sorry.

486
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,041
Sophia, I'm sorry!

487
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:02,708
<i>Angèle.</i>

488
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:05,541
To capture the shark,
we must close the locks

489
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,083
and block all access.

490
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:08,291
We have no choice.

491
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,750
That's all? A week before the triathlon?

492
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:16,125
They've invited global press to announce
the Olympic events held in the Seine.

493
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:18,625
Yes, I know.

494
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:22,208
How can you ask me
to tell the mayor to cancel?

495
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:24,083
How do I go about telling her?

496
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,083
Double our manpower.
I'll call the prefect.

497
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:34,750
And set up a surveillance team.

498
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:52,791
{\an8}<i>Restoring our oceans' health is crucial,</i>

499
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:56,375
{\an8}<i>given the positive impact
that our marine ecosystem</i>

500
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:57,875
{\an8}<i>has on climate change.</i>

501
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,833
{\an8}<i>Half of the oxygen...</i>

502
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,791
SLAUGHTER AT SEA:
RESEARCH GROUP ATTACKED BY SHARK

503
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:19,625
<i>Hello, behind me is the El Soldado boat
owned by Ocean Origins.</i>

504
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:24,958
<i>A few days ago,
the crew was massacred on an expedition</i>

505
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,666
<i>north of Hawaii,
near the Pacific Garbage Patch.</i>

506
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:31,500
<i>The association's president,
Sophia Assalas, refuses to comment.</i>

507
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:33,750
<i>An investigation is now...</i>

508
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:09,500
<i>What is more valuable than life?</i>

509
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,416
<i>These images speak for themselves.</i>

510
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,333
<i>I'm not selling anything.</i>

511
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:27,208
<i>I have no investors
to convince or elections to win.</i>

512
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,958
<i>But we and future generations
have everything to lose.</i>

513
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:34,208
<i>Our parents and their parents
have sealed our fate.</i>

514
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,125
<i>My name is Mika.</i>

515
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:40,416
<i>I am 20 years old,
and with the Save Our Seas collective,</i>

516
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,125
<i>we believe that animals
and humans are equal.</i>

517
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:47,666
<i>Yet, 100 million sharks are killed
every year. Why?</i>

518
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:50,333
<i>To make soup or anti-aging cream?</i>

519
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:52,208
<i>Stop this genocide!</i>

520
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,541
<i>They regulate our oceans.
We must protect them.</i>

521
00:45:56,041 --> 00:46:00,416
<i>Overfishing and pollution have deprived
sharks of their food source,</i>

522
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
<i>forcing them into new territories.</i>

523
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,291
<i>Just like Lilith.</i>

524
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:08,458
<i>She is lost in the Seine.
I need your help to save her!</i>

525
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:11,416
<i>We are the last ones
who can make a difference.</i>

526
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:14,125
<i>It starts with saving this shark.</i>

527
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:16,250
<i>Saving her is</i>

528
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,208
<i>standing up to those ruining our planet.</i>

529
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:22,166
<i>Saving her is</i>

530
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:26,250
<i>screaming out
that this world belongs to us.</i>

531
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
<i>Saving her is</i>

532
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:30,708
<i>saving our future.</i>

533
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,250
<i>So join us. Make yourselves heard.</i>

534
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:37,583
{\an8}<i>We will find this shark</i>

535
00:46:37,666 --> 00:46:38,916
{\an8}<i>and set her free.</i>

536
00:46:58,750 --> 00:46:59,833
Sophia?

537
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:02,708
Why are you here?

538
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:06,250
I think we got off on the wrong foot,

539
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,375
and I wanted to apologize.

540
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:12,833
Your nosebleed on the boat,
it was a diving accident, right?

541
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:18,500
I didn't know about your husband...
I mean, your team.

542
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,083
And, well, I'm sorry.

543
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,791
We're meeting the mayor this afternoon
and I wondered if you...

544
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:31,458
- If you wanted...
- You can ask me.

545
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:36,125
I wanted to know if you'd join us
because if I start talking about sharks,

546
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:37,958
no one'll believe me.

547
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:45,916
A shark?

548
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:52,666
A shark in the Seine?

549
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,791
I insisted on meeting,
as urgent action must be taken.

550
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:57,541
Of course, Angèle.

551
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,708
We must always take action.

552
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:02,750
You did the right thing.

553
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:10,666
Recognize it?

554
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:12,875
It's Paris.

555
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,041
My Paris.

556
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:21,708
Those are for the upcoming triathlon,

557
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:24,125
our showcase for the Olympics.

558
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:27,666
Journalists from around the world
will be there.

559
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,166
We're expecting nearly 1,000 participants.

560
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:31,958
More than that!

561
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:35,666
Catch my drift?

562
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,083
Ma'am, the shark has killed before.

563
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:41,208
Hang on. Believe it or not, I sympathize.

564
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,458
If we do nothing...

565
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:43,750
No! Hey, come on!

566
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:46,250
Don't make such insinuations.

567
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:47,791
I'll be clear with you.

568
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:50,916
This species seems to display
radical changes in behavior.

569
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,541
I first observed it three years ago.

570
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:55,708
We know about your team.

571
00:48:58,375 --> 00:48:59,375
People died.

572
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:01,250
If we do nothing,

573
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:04,916
your PR operation
could turn into a total bloodbath.

574
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:07,500
- They don't get it.
- No.

575
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,166
You have no idea, do you?

576
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,000
One point seven billion!

577
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:15,208
That's the budget
allocated by the government

578
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:16,958
for staging this event.

579
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:21,125
We even had wastewater tanks
installed under the Seine.

580
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,750
46,000 cubic meters of water.

581
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:26,083
I don't know what to say. Figure it out.

582
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:28,375
Make your fish disappear.

583
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:31,791
Very well, ma'am.

584
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:36,500
Our teams will manage all social media
communications to avoid the worst.

585
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:43,291
It's up to us to turn this event
into something positive.

586
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:47,000
Yes, Angèle! Go!

587
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:49,375
I'll see you out. After you.

588
00:49:51,416 --> 00:49:53,875
Sophia, make a list of what you'll need.

589
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,291
I'll get it ASAP.

590
00:49:55,916 --> 00:49:59,416
But since her tracker is down,
we'll need to lure her towards us.

591
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,500
How?

592
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,500
We'll draw her to
the Sully and Austerlitz Bridges.

593
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:09,875
Once she's sedated,
we trap her in the Port de l'Arsenal lock.

594
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:12,041
The Oceanographic Institute
will take over.

595
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:13,916
Understood?

596
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Let's go.

597
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:18,708
Take the flares to keep her at a distance.

598
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:22,791
Okay, great.

599
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:26,083
Yes, that's great.

600
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:28,791
- Watch it!
- Careful!

601
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:29,750
Seriously?

602
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:31,541
- Sorry. Listen...
- Ready? One...

603
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:33,208
Yes, thank you.

604
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:36,250
Didn't you close the lid?

605
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:37,583
Congrats.

606
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:40,375
I spoke to the Institute.
They'll be here in an hour.

607
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:41,666
Let me show you a video.

608
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:43,458
Movie time, Sarge!

609
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:47,875
Look.

610
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,750
Once we sedate her, we have to be quick.

611
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:53,875
The Institute only has
30 minutes to get her ready.

612
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:55,625
Otherwise, she'll asphyxiate.

613
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:57,500
Are we using the same hoist?

614
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,458
Sophia! We need to talk. It's urgent.

615
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:03,958
Where are they?

616
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,500
In the catacombs.

617
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:09,958
By the sewage reservoirs.

618
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,916
Please don't tell her I came.

619
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,375
She's my friend, but she's gone apeshit!

620
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:22,083
She wants to prove
Lilith can be guided using sonar, but...

621
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:23,291
How'd you find her?

622
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,041
I managed
to reactivate her beacon. That's all.

623
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:30,750
How? I wasn't able to.

624
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:32,958
Can you show me?

625
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:46,708
What is she doing there?

626
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:50,208
- Those are the old catacombs.
- Exactly.

627
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:53,708
The city's water reservoirs.
It's like an underground lake.

628
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:55,208
There's no river access.

629
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:57,250
- It's not possible.
- Actually, it is.

630
00:51:58,208 --> 00:52:00,791
We found an old access
under Saint-Martin Canal.

631
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:04,625
- When is this happening?
- Right now.

632
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:07,125
There's a lot of people.

633
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:12,250
- I shouldn't have come.
- Don't worry.

634
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,458
You did well. Just don't let Mika dive.

635
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:16,375
Go there and do as we said.

636
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:17,833
We're coming. Okay?

637
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,541
- Hi, Mika.
- Thanks for coming! Great to see you.

638
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:39,833
- Thanks, Mika.
- You're all awesome.

639
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:42,000
Thanks, everyone.

640
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:45,458
Régis? Start filming, please.
How's it going?

641
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:47,208
- Good.
- How are you?

642
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:50,541
Is it ready?

643
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:51,875
Almost.

644
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:58,000
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah.

645
00:53:58,083 --> 00:53:59,416
I'm sure it'll work.

646
00:53:59,916 --> 00:54:02,833
- It'll draw her here.
- I'm not worried about that.

647
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,500
What's gotten into you?

648
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,416
We do as we agreed.

649
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:12,416
What if it doesn't work?

650
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,875
What if we do nothing?

651
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,750
Okay.

652
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,000
Chronos River Unit.

653
00:54:56,083 --> 00:55:00,458
Catacombs at St. Martin and Jemmapes.
Potentially 50 individuals present.

654
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:04,291
Urgent request for backup.
I repeat. Request for backup.

655
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:10,041
Right, guys. We don't have an ETA,
so our safety is the priority, okay?

656
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:14,208
Check your flashlights.
Stay against the walls.

657
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:17,708
There's only one way out,
so we'll go in calmly to avoid panic.

658
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:19,333
Or it'll be a bottleneck.

659
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:23,208
Understood? Adama, Leo, go right.
Sophia, stay with them.

660
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,333
Nils and Markus with me.

661
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:54,541
This is the River Police.
Everyone out of the water.

662
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:55,625
No, wait.

663
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:57,666
- Time to go.
- Wait!

664
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:00,833
The party's over.
You are in a restricted area.

665
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:03,041
We will evacuate calmly.

666
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:05,291
My colleagues will show you out. Adama!

667
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:07,625
Follow Adama and Markus.

668
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:09,625
- Everyone out.
- No, wait.

669
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:12,208
- We asked you to get out.
- Wait, let us finish!

670
00:56:12,291 --> 00:56:14,208
- Get back.
- Watch where you step!

671
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:17,000
- It's slippery and narrow!
- We know what we're doing!

672
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,750
- Mika!
- You can't kick us out!

673
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,625
Sophia, we can use this
to guide her. I'm sure of it.

674
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:24,166
Let it go, and get out of the water.

675
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,500
Come on. Everyone out! Move it! Go!

676
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:30,625
- Against the wall.
- I'm talking to you.

677
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:31,833
She's coming!

678
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,791
Look. There are two.

679
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,875
- There's a second one! Look!
- Sick!

680
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,000
- It looks like a baby.
- She gave birth.

681
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:23,625
Mika, don't touch it!

682
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,208
Lilith will feel threatened.

683
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:31,041
You don't understand. Get out now!
Lilith is dangerous!

684
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:32,833
Sophia, look!

685
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,791
- Nils.
- You were right. Trust me!

686
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:36,958
- Secure me.
- You have no idea!

687
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:38,500
Lilith gave birth.

688
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:40,958
We're in her nest.

689
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,791
Wake up, damn it! They are harmless.

690
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,625
Mika, get out now!
She's going to attack! Get out!

691
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:56,333
Mika, get out now!

692
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:58,375
- Mika!
- That is an order! Get out!

693
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:00,166
- Stay against the wall.
- Stay calm.

694
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,916
We'll evacuate one by one!

695
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,333
- Mika!
- Against the wall.

696
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:04,791
- Hurry!
- Mika, get out!

697
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:06,708
Stay against the walls!

698
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:08,791
- Do something, Adil!
- Stay calm.

699
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:10,583
- Why do you ruin everything?
- Adil!

700
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:15,333
Adil! Get out of the water!

701
00:58:15,416 --> 00:58:16,666
- Quiet!
- Mika!

702
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:18,625
Mika, get out! Mika!

703
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,166
Mika, get out!

704
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,291
Hurry, Adil! Get out!

705
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:29,125
Mika!

706
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:45,791
Adil!

707
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:50,333
Hurry, Adil!

708
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:53,875
Everyone, against the walls!

709
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:57,916
Everyone, head to the exit!

710
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:05,875
Give me your hand!

711
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:08,625
Give me your hand! Hurry!

712
00:59:16,458 --> 00:59:18,208
Ben! Your hand! Ben!

713
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:20,041
Your hand!

714
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:23,583
Ben!

715
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:36,083
Get me out!

716
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:41,958
Ben!

717
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,958
Stay against the wall!

718
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,416
Grab on!

719
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:56,166
- Leopold!
- Leo!

720
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,958
Get out, Leo!

721
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:03,791
Everyone, out of the water! Get out!

722
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:11,000
Calm down! Move quickly!

723
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:19,666
It's behind us!

724
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:25,708
Come on! Over here!

725
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,875
Everyone, calm down!

726
01:00:32,416 --> 01:00:33,708
Everyone, out!

727
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:36,708
No!

728
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:37,791
Leo!

729
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:39,583
Leo!

730
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:44,333
Get out!

731
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:46,916
Come on! Go! Hurry!

732
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,500
Help me.

733
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:04,666
- Leo!
- Leo!

734
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:06,541
Leo, over here!

735
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:07,875
Your hand!

736
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:09,000
Your hand!

737
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,708
Give me your hand!

738
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:15,208
Come on!

739
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:48,791
Hey, look at me!

740
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:56,791
We need to stabilize him!

741
01:01:57,458 --> 01:01:58,916
It's the prefect.

742
01:02:01,166 --> 01:02:02,708
- Angèle...
- No. Adil, come with me!

743
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:04,291
- Two seconds.
- Come on!

744
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:39,541
Thanks.

745
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:39,166
It's my fault, Adil.

746
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:43,166
I was meant to protect them.

747
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Sophia.

748
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:49,041
You're not to blame.

749
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:51,750
Okay?

750
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:55,041
Adil?

751
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,666
Come quickly.

752
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,250
Now.

753
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:10,791
- What's wrong?
- Come and see.

754
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:03,916
See this?

755
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:07,791
They're sensors
for adapting to the water's salinity.

756
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:10,208
Can you see this protrusion, here?

757
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,583
It means they've adapted to freshwater.

758
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,250
Why are they in Paris?

759
01:05:16,916 --> 01:05:20,208
As they swam upriver,
they must've found the perfect nursery.

760
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,125
In the catacombs, they're safe.

761
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:26,250
Like larvae in a hive.

762
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:31,125
They'd feed in the Seine, grow,
and return to the ocean.

763
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:34,666
Paris is one of the few cities
with this ecosystem.

764
01:05:38,416 --> 01:05:39,416
It's a female.

765
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,208
That's not normal.

766
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:07,083
She's pregnant
without reaching sexual maturity.

767
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,750
Do you see this dentition?

768
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:17,541
She's not even two months old.

769
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:21,583
- It's unbelievable.
- How do you explain that?

770
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:25,916
Lilith reproduces by parthenogenesis.

771
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Meaning?

772
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:30,000
Meaning she doesn't need a male.

773
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:37,458
I was wrong. They aren't makos.

774
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:39,750
They've adapted.

775
01:06:41,541 --> 01:06:43,833
Lilith is the first of a new species.

776
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:48,666
If we don't eliminate them,
they'll keep reproducing,

777
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:51,416
colonizing our oceans indefinitely.

778
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:57,916
Twelve deaths!
Do you realize what a tragedy that is?

779
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,833
When we arrived, it was already too late.
We did our best to evacuate, but...

780
01:07:02,916 --> 01:07:04,750
You should've informed your superiors!

781
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:07,791
You do not possess the skills
to lead such an operation.

782
01:07:07,875 --> 01:07:10,708
Sir, we tried to warn the mayor.

783
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:12,333
Lies! Blatant lies!

784
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:15,208
You told me
about a shark lost in the Seine.

785
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:18,875
I thought you and your team
could handle the situation.

786
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:24,541
The triathlon starts
in less than 24 hours.

787
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,833
Do you realize the shit I'm in?

788
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:30,625
I don't know what to say on TV tonight.

789
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:33,291
You don't know what to say?

790
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:34,916
Really?

791
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,166
Have you seen how many died?

792
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,375
Tell them the truth.
There's a shark in Paris.

793
01:07:39,458 --> 01:07:41,083
Right, let's all calm down.

794
01:07:41,166 --> 01:07:44,291
Don't you understand?
There'll be dozens, then hundreds.

795
01:07:44,375 --> 01:07:46,333
Cancel it! It's not fucking hard!

796
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:49,666
Get out of my office.

797
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:55,666
You can go back to managing the barges.

798
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:58,250
The army will handle security. Understood?

799
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:03,750
Mr. Prefect, hush this up.
Keep it off social media.

800
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:13,791
{\an8}<i>Huge treatment facilities
have been installed</i>

801
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:15,625
{\an8}<i>upstream of the bathing area,</i>

802
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:18,333
{\an8}<i>where the open-water
swimming will be held,</i>

803
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:23,125
{\an8}<i>which means all Parisians can go
for a dip after a long day at work.</i>

804
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:27,666
{\an8}<i>What is your response to the activists
saying there are sharks in the Seine?</i>

805
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:30,458
{\an8}<i>Well, if they even exist... Okay.</i>

806
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:34,875
{\an8}<i>I'd congratulate myself. It would mean
our cleanup measures are working.</i>

807
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:36,791
<i>- Even for sharks?
- Absolutely!</i>

808
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:41,041
<i>In any case, you know sharks are
perfectly harmless to humans.</i>

809
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:43,333
<i>In my opinion, all species are welcome...</i>

810
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:44,625
We screwed up.

811
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:47,500
They're making us the scapegoats.

812
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:49,416
Don't fight it. It's political.

813
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:51,666
They'd never spoil the party.

814
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:57,000
<i>People pay a lot of money
to swim with sharks.</i>

815
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:10,333
<i>Safety is a priority for us all
and for the upcoming Olympics.</i>

816
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:16,875
It's frustrating not to be heard.

817
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:18,750
Not being able to help.

818
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:22,000
The army's in charge now.

819
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:32,000
If Lilith and her pack return to the sea
during the triathlon, it'll be carnage.

820
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:35,458
- We have to get rid of them.
- Stop.

821
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:37,458
It isn't our responsibility.

822
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:39,041
So, stop.

823
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:52,250
Why'd you leave the army?

824
01:10:01,041 --> 01:10:02,708
- Adil...
- Because I'm a coward.

825
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,958
We were supposed to free
French hostages in Burkina Faso.

826
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:17,750
I was afraid of dying.

827
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:24,541
I abandoned my brothers.

828
01:10:29,166 --> 01:10:30,875
They freed the hostages, but...

829
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:34,208
they were killed in action.

830
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:37,916
That's why I left.

831
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:53,291
- Want anything to drink?
- No, thanks.

832
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:00,875
So...

833
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,583
what now?

834
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:04,541
Do you have a plan?

835
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:11,541
I need two or three volunteers.

836
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:14,625
Off the books. I won't force anyone.

837
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:17,208
Only 12 hours till the triathlon.
Anyone want to come?

838
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:22,333
For Leo.

839
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:25,166
We're a team, right?

840
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:28,375
For Leo.

841
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,958
I'm sorry. With my family and all...

842
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:38,875
But I can cover your backs.

843
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:48,291
The nest must be in this crypt,
right below the catacombs.

844
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:52,083
This is Poiccard and Berruti,
explosives experts from the bomb squad.

845
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:56,250
<i>Berruti will lead the dive group
of Sophia, Adama, and myself.</i>

846
01:11:58,958 --> 01:12:00,625
Caro and Markus will wait up top.

847
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:03,166
<i>Positioned at Saint-Louis Bridge.</i>

848
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:07,750
Our extraction point is here,
behind Notre-Dame.

849
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:10,208
Meanwhile, we'll dive from the catacombs.

850
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:13,791
<i>The cavity is 30 meters deep,
so safety stops are essential.</i>

851
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:16,125
<i>At the bottom, there's a 20-meter tunnel.</i>

852
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:20,083
<i>In the crypt, we'll set the explosives,
so it all collapses at once.</i>

853
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:21,541
How long before it blows?

854
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,500
- Under three minutes.
- It's suicide.

855
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:28,875
There won't be time to decompress.

856
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:31,458
<i>We'll exit on Seabobs through this tunnel.</i>

857
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:33,333
Once inside, we'll be safe.

858
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,333
<i>It's only 80 meters to the Seine.</i>

859
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:41,791
Markus, you'll cut open the tunnel grate
and join Caro up top.

860
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:46,000
I'm part of the mayor's delegation.

861
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:48,000
I'll cover you on the down-low.

862
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:49,750
What if the sharks aren't there?

863
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:51,875
I'll use an infrasound emitter.

864
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:55,916
It'll draw the sharks to the crypt
while the explosives are set.

865
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,458
<i>We'll use flares to keep them at bay</i>

866
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:02,708
<i>and full diving gear with masks
to make communication easier.</i>

867
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:06,833
I used the same gear with my crew.

868
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:09,916
- Who triggers the detonator?
- Me.

869
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,583
I'll make sure you're clear, then "click."

870
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:15,708
Any questions?

871
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:19,833
What if you don't resurface?

872
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:00,833
Almost there.

873
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:02,666
Thirty meters down.

874
01:14:14,791 --> 01:14:16,208
Coast is clear. Move in.

875
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,125
Ladies and gentlemen, this way.

876
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:01,791
Head to the other side.

877
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:03,375
This way, please!

878
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:05,041
Keep moving.

879
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:06,791
Unit 75, bridge blocked.

880
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:10,375
Okay, copy that. All clear.

881
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:13,416
<i>This is Company B.</i>

882
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,833
<i>Several suspicious vehicles reported.</i>

883
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:20,375
Keep moving, everyone. This way.

884
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:32,500
Turn around! Nobody is allowed through!

885
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:36,125
Easy, guys. We're the River Police!
We're in charge here.

886
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:40,500
This is a military zone.
You received orders. Turn around, now!

887
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:44,833
Caro for Angèle. It's blocked off.

888
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:03,166
<i>Angèle, do you copy?</i>

889
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:05,083
Good luck to all of you!

890
01:16:05,166 --> 01:16:06,500
Madam Mayor!

891
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:09,000
How do you feel today?

892
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,458
Very serene.

893
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:15,416
We've been preparing for months,
with my team and the prefect.

894
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:18,083
Sir, a word about safety.

895
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:19,791
There are rumors of sharks.

896
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:23,000
And they are just rumors. We hope...

897
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:26,500
All measures have been taken
to ensure optimum safety.

898
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,958
- Thank you.
- Ma'am, one last question.

899
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,041
You are following us live
as we await the mayor's arrival.

900
01:16:38,541 --> 01:16:42,208
The mayor has just arrived
with her advisors and the prefect.

901
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:48,916
The mayor will be starting
this long-awaited Seine Triathlon...

902
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,958
<i>Caro for Angèle. What do we do?</i>

903
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:53,250
River emergency. Permission to pass.

904
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:57,375
<i>The prefect requested
police presence behind Notre-Dame. Over.</i>

905
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,416
<i>Caro for Adil. We got held up.</i>

906
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,541
<i>In position in ten minutes. Over.</i>

907
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:20,625
Copy that.

908
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:27,041
Twenty meters to go.

909
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,458
Adama, pass me the emitter.

910
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:43,250
This is it, my fellow citizens!

911
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,791
Some dreamed about it,

912
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:47,916
many have talked about it,

913
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:51,083
I have done it!

914
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:03,875
Paris is now a city of leisure,

915
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:05,375
well-being,

916
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:07,083
and togetherness.

917
01:18:07,666 --> 01:18:08,833
<i>Adil for Caro.</i>

918
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:11,250
<i>We've reached the crypt.
Are you in position?</i>

919
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:14,125
<i>Adil for Caro.</i>

920
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:16,958
<i>Almost there. Give me two minutes.</i>

921
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:18,750
<i>Over.</i>

922
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:31,291
Lighting up.

923
01:18:38,166 --> 01:18:39,166
Holy shit.

924
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:49,458
No sudden moves.
They're drawn to movement.

925
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:02,625
And never forget,

926
01:19:03,375 --> 01:19:04,375
Paris is

927
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:06,583
and always will be

928
01:19:06,666 --> 01:19:07,916
a celebration.

929
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,375
A huge celebration!

930
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:23,166
- Come on!
- Yeah!

931
01:19:31,916 --> 01:19:33,583
And I declare

932
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:36,250
the Seine Triathlon

933
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:37,333
open!

934
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:51,041
Hello, and welcome back
to viewers who were with us earlier.

935
01:19:52,791 --> 01:19:54,125
Welcome to the triathlon...

936
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:57,416
Come on!

937
01:19:58,208 --> 01:19:59,208
Go!

938
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,916
<i>And we're off! The first lap...</i>

939
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Angèle for Caro.

940
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:06,750
<i>The swimmers are off.</i>

941
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:08,291
<i>Be quick.</i>

942
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,708
<i>Markus is in the water. Over.</i>

943
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:54,291
All set.

944
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:55,375
Go ahead.

945
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:56,833
Can you see her?

946
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:00,208
Negative.

947
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,583
Caro, how's it going?

948
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:15,791
Working on it. Not long now.

949
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:26,833
This isn't right.

950
01:21:27,791 --> 01:21:29,041
She's still not here.

951
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:37,208
<i>The swimmers are in top form
on the third lap of the Seine Triathlon</i>

952
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:39,333
<i>with seven laps remaining.</i>

953
01:21:43,375 --> 01:21:44,666
Something is wrong.

954
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:47,583
Where is she?

955
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:02,750
<i>The coast is clear.</i>

956
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:04,416
Copy that.

957
01:22:05,416 --> 01:22:07,041
Come on. Speed things up.

958
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:10,041
Are the explosives set?

959
01:22:11,041 --> 01:22:12,041
Armed.

960
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:14,166
Armed.

961
01:22:15,791 --> 01:22:17,541
- Poiccard?
- Two minutes.

962
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:28,250
- We need to move. They're skittish.
- One second!

963
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,083
Wait, she still isn't here.

964
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:34,958
Explosives set. I'm almost there.

965
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:42,291
Okay, all set.

966
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,333
Everybody, move out.

967
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:56,083
Come here. Hurry!

968
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:59,166
Berruti! Get over here!

969
01:23:11,541 --> 01:23:12,916
Nobody move a muscle.

970
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:15,625
We have to stay together.

971
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,500
No, Adama!

972
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:45,083
- Come back, Adama!
- Get out of here!

973
01:23:46,166 --> 01:23:47,958
Activating detonator! Get out!

974
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:11,208
No!

975
01:25:18,916 --> 01:25:20,541
- There they are!
- Sophia!

976
01:25:20,625 --> 01:25:21,666
Sophia! Adil!

977
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:24,041
- Hurry!
- Swim!

978
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:25,125
Hurry!

979
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:36,416
Give me your arm.

980
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,583
Your arm!

981
01:25:43,875 --> 01:25:44,875
I've got you.

982
01:25:45,208 --> 01:25:46,750
Sophia, the others?

983
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:48,875
Adil!

984
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:51,958
Adil, answer me!

985
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:54,083
You're okay.

986
01:25:57,458 --> 01:25:59,000
Sophia! What are you doing?

987
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:00,125
Sophia!

988
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:10,500
She's here!

989
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:11,708
- Sophia!
- She's here!

990
01:27:11,791 --> 01:27:13,041
Hurry!

991
01:27:13,125 --> 01:27:14,750
Sophia! Come on!

992
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:17,208
- Hurry!
- Come on!

993
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:18,291
Hurry!

994
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Adil!

995
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:11,375
Why's she circling us?

996
01:28:13,583 --> 01:28:16,958
She's not circling us.
She's heading for the swimmers.

997
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:35,875
Let's go!

998
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:22,375
Come on!

999
01:29:25,833 --> 01:29:27,041
Shark!

1000
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:30,416
Shark!

1001
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:34,708
Shark!

1002
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:46,916
What's going on?

1003
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:51,625
What's wrong?

1004
01:29:52,041 --> 01:29:55,083
{\an8}Is that a fin?
Shit, it's a shark! Film it!

1005
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:03,833
Watch out!

1006
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:05,750
Help!

1007
01:30:25,083 --> 01:30:26,541
Help!

1008
01:30:39,916 --> 01:30:42,541
Cease fire immediately!
The artillery shells!

1009
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:48,250
Stop!

1010
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:49,708
- Stop shooting!
- Stop!

1011
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:51,583
There are shells!

1012
01:32:23,958 --> 01:32:24,958
Move it!

1013
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:27,666
Move it, assholes!

1014
01:32:28,208 --> 01:32:29,291
Run!

1015
01:32:49,583 --> 01:32:51,041
Shit! Run!

1016
01:33:32,666 --> 01:33:33,666
Adil?

1017
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:35,250
Adil!

1018
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:50,458
Adil.

1019
01:34:03,916 --> 01:34:04,916
Adil.

1020
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:29,208
Sophia...

1021
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:32,125
Is it over?

1022
01:35:58,708 --> 01:36:04,000
