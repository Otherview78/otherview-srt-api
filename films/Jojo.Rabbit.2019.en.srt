1
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,253
Jojo Betzler.

2
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,631
Ten years old.

3
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:51,302
Today, you join the ranks of the <i>Jungvolk</i>

4
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,889
in a very special training weekend.

5
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,142
It's going to be intense.

6
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,647
But today, you become a man.

7
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,569
I swear to devote
all my energies and my strength

8
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:12,198
to the savior of our country,
Adolf Hitler.

9
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:17,245
I am willing and ready
to give up my life for him.

10
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,872
So help me God.

11
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:21,791
Yes, that's right.

12
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:25,753
- Now, Jojo Betzler, what is your mind?
- Snake mind.

13
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,923
- And, Jojo Betzler, what is your body?
- Wolf body.

14
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,550
- Jojo Betzler, what is your courage?
- Panther courage.

15
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:35,805
- And, Jojo Betzler, what is your soul?
- A German soul.

16
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,390
Yeah, man. You're ready.

17
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,101
- Adolf.
- Hmm?

18
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:43,688
I don't think I can do this.

19
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,357
<i>Was?</i> Of course you can.

20
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:49,485
Sure, you're a little bit scrawny
and a bit unpopular

21
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,905
and you can't tie your shoelaces
even though you're ten years old.

22
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:57,743
But you're still the bestest,
most loyal little Nazi I've ever met.

23
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,704
Not to mention the fact
you're really good looking.

24
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,374
So, you're gonna get out there
and you're gonna have a great time, okay?

25
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,544
- Okay.
- That's the spirit. Okay.

26
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,753
<i>Heil</i> me, man.

27
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:08,713
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

28
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,549
What? You can <i>heil</i> me better than that.

29
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,967
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- No--

30
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,927
Just throw it away.
Don't even think about it.

31
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:17,054
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- No, you're overthinking it.

32
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:18,848
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> "Hitterler."

33
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:21,392
Who's "Hitterler?"
Do you even speak German?

34
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,270
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- That's not a <i>heil.</i> This is a <i>heil. Heil!</i>

35
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,439
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler! <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

38
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,819
- Have a great day! <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler! <i>Heil</i> Hitler!

39
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,446
- You're gonna be the best. <i>Heil</i> Hitler!
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler! <i>Heil</i> Hitler!

40
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,655

<i>Heil</i> Hitler, guys.

73
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,485
<i>Heil</i> Hitler!

74
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:40,448
<i>Jungvolk,</i> welcome to
the <i>Hitlerjugend</i> training weekend.

75
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,826
In which we will make men
and women of you all.

76
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,162
My name is Captain Klenzendorf.

77
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,622
You may call me Captain K.

78
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:49,957
Captain K. Whoo!

79
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:55,296
<i>Ja.</i> And this is Sub-Officer Finkel.

80
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,839
This is <i>Fräulein</i> Rahm.

81
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,257
Hey. <i>Heil</i> Hitler, everyone.

82
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,551
So a little about me. Who am I?

83
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,345
And why am I here talking to a bunch
of little titty-grabbers

84
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:06,140
instead of leading my men
into battle towards glorious death?

85
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,516
Great question.

86
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,145
I've asked it myself every day
since Operation Screw Up

87
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:15,024
where I lost a perfectly good eye
in a totally preventable enemy attack.

88
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,234
And according to my superiors,

89
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:20,196
you need two eyes to be
a meaningful part of the war effort.

90
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:22,490
Can two-eyed people do this?

91
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,043
- Jesus.
- Over the next two days,

92
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,505
you little critters will get to experience
some of the things

93
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,382
that the mighty German army
goes through every day.

94
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,385
And even though it would appear
our country's on the back foot

95
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:46,222
and there really isn't much hope
in us winning this war,

96
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:47,806
apparently we're doing just fine.

97
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:56,148
Anyway. You boys have all been issued
with your <i>Deutsches Jungvolk</i> daggers.

98
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:59,527
These are very special
and expensive weapons.

99
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,946
You should never be without them.

100
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,739
And don't try to stab each other.

101
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,823
No stabbing!

102
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:06,951
No stabbing.

103
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:09,495
This is your first step towards being men.

104
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,540
Today you boys will be involved
in such activities

105
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:15,042
as marching, bayonet drills,
grenade-throwing,

106
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,253
trench-digging, map-reading, gas defense,

107
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,129
camouflage, ambush techniques,

108
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,715
war games, firing guns,
and blowing stuff up.

109
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,428
The girls will practice
important womanly duties

110
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:29,306
such as dressing wounds, making beds,

111
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,101
and learning how to get pregnant.

112
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,185
Aw.

113
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,604
I've had 18 kids for Germany.

114
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,941
Such a great year to be a girl.

115
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,278
All right. Let's get to it.

116
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,487

If I met one, I'd kill it like that.

156
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:44,983

157
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,985
But how would you know if you saw one?

158
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,445
They could look just like us.

159
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,739
I'd feel its head for horns.

160
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:52,408

161

Oh, yeah. I forgot about
the Brussels sprouts bit.

162
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:59,039
Imagine catching one
and giving it to Hitler.

163
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:02,126
That'd be a surefire way
to get into his personal guards.

164
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,795
Then we would become best friends.

165
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,840
I thought I was your best friend.

166
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,843
Yorki, you're my second-best friend.

167
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,387
First place is reserved for the <i>Führer.</i>

168
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,932
So, unless you're Hitler hiding in a fat,
little boy's body...

169
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,309
I'd be happy with second place.

170
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,980
I guess I'm just a kid
in a fat kid's body.

171
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,606
Case closed.

172
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,945
Raah! Raah! Raah!

173
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:35,659
When you stand before the enemy
and have to end his life,

174
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,162
which of you will have
the stomach to do this?

175
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,956
Good.

176
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,084
There is no room in Hitler's army

177
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,878
for those that lack strength.

178
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,297
We want hardened warriors.

179
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,800
Those that are prepared to kill at will.

180
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,261
Can you do this?

181
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,346
- Yes.
<i>- Ja.</i>

182
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,558
Johannes.

183
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,978
Can you kill?

184
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:08,025
Pfff. Of course. I love killing.

185
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,612
Good. Come here.

186
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,617
Don't be scared. Come on.

187
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,744
Good.

188
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,337
Kill it.

189
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,298
Huh?

190
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,302
Wring its neck and kill the rabbit.

191
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,806
Or are you scared?

192
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,725
I'm not scared. I-- I just...

193
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,269
Now.

194
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,651
Place both hands around its neck
and then one hard twist.

195
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,988
He might scream, but we'll just use
the boot to finish it off.

196
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,327
Kill. Kill.

197
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,789
Kill. Kill.

198
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,999
Kill. Kill.

199
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,877
Kill. Kill. Kill.

200
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:12,005
Kill. Kill. Kill.

201
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:16,093
Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill.

202
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:20,013
Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill.

203
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,765
- Shoo! Come on, shoo.
- Hey! Hey, hey.

204
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,647
Good shot.

205
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,901
You are a coward.

206
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:35,195
Just like your father.

207
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,447
He--He's not a coward.

208
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,533
- He's fighting in Italy.
- Really?

209
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,368
But no one has heard
from him in two years.

210
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,161
He is a deserting coward.

211
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,873
He's scared and so are you.

212
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:51,295
You're as scared as a little rabbit.

213
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,299
Scared little rabbit.

214
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,843
Maybe we should snap your neck, too?

215
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,136
Jojo the rabbit.

216
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,352
Jojo Rabbit.

217
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,438
Jojo Rabbit.

218
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:13,358
Jojo Rabbit. Jojo Rabbit.

219
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:22,242
Poor Jojo. What's wrong, little man?

220
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,747
- Hi, Adolf.
- Wanna tell me about that rabbit incident?

221
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,081
What was all that about?

222
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,417
They wanted me to kill it.

223
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,420
I'm sorry. I couldn't.

224
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,839
Don't worry about it.
I couldn't care less.

225
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,175
But now they call me a scared rabbit.

226
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,509
Let them say whatever they want.

227
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,262
People used to say a lot
of nasty things about me.

228
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,722
"Oh, this guy's a lunatic."

229
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,725
"Oh, look at that psycho.
He's gonna get us all killed."

230
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:52,689
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
The rabbit is no coward.

231
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,277
The humble little bunny faces
a dangerous world every day,

232
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,656
hunting carrots for his family,
for his country.

233
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,326
My empire will be full of all animals.

234
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,788
Lions, giraffes, zebras,

235
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,415
rhinoceroses, octopuses,

236
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,167
rhinoctopuses.

237
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,836
Even the mighty rabbit.

238
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,046
Cigarette?

239
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,923
Oh, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

240
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,093
Let me give you some really good advice.

241
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,135
Be the rabbit.

242
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,555
The humble bunny
can outwit all of his enemies.

243
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,767
He's brave and sneaky and strong.

244
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,687
Be the rabbit.

245
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,813
Jojo!

246
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,608
Are you all right, Jojo?

247
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,611
Who were you talking to?

248
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,321
Nobody.

249
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:42,739
Oh, I thought you were crying.

250
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,741
Are you a teardrop specialist?

251
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,618
No.

252
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,662
Case closed.

253
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:53,250
Now, it's time for Jojo
to show those stick insects

254
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,461
who is the real cowardly rabbit.

255
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,256
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

256
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,716
Never mind.

257
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,843
Jojo, where are you going?

258
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,303
To be the rabbit!

259
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:08,515
Jojo Rabbit. Jojo Rabbit.
Hunting carrots. Jojo Rabbit.

260
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,559
Hey, this is amazing.

261
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,436
We're like two human antelopes.

262
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,738
Now, lads, each of you
will be given the opportunity

263
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:26,116
to ignite and throw a grenade.

264
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,162
I will personally
be supervising each of you

265
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:33,540
to make sure you don't blow
your eyes out or something.

266
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,250
All right, who's first?

267
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,334
Klaus.

268
00:14:36,334 --> 00:15:06,334
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

269
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,668
Shit.

270
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:19,753
Shit!

271
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,300
Don't do that.

272
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,553
Jojo. Jojo.

273
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,515
Finkel! Finkel!

274
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,724
Jojo, Jojo.

275
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,854
O-M <i>Gott.</i>

276
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,023
He looks like a Picasso painting.

277
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,575
His mother's going to kill me.

278
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,091
My darling cub.

279
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,006
Hey, kid.

280
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:54,472
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

281
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,225
Mmm. My darling little cub.

282
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,352
Why so happy?

283
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,938
Your son is ugly like a monster.

284
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,441
Hey. You're no monster.

285
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,151
Besides, your scars will heal,

286
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,819
and you'll get most
of the movement back in your leg.

287
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,738
But I'll never be
in Hitler's personal guards.

288
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,239
Ah, you're fine as you are.

289
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,075
I'm just happy to have you back home. Hmm?

290
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,827
Mama Lion worries about her cub,

291
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,746
especially when Papa Lion isn't here.

292
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,956
Or Inge Lion.

293
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:24,794
Or Inge Lion.

294
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,550
You grab the rabbit by the tail,
wrap it around his ear,

295
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,970
tie it all up and then
stuff him back down the hole.

296
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,307
Now then, let's get on our way, huh?

297
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,018
I think getting out of the house
will do wonders for your recuperation.

298
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,519
I don't want to go out there.

299
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,356
What? Don't be silly. Of course you do.

300
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,483
I look stupid.

301
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,817
People will stare.

302
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,361
Enjoy the attention, kid.

303
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,613
Not everyone's
lucky enough to look stupid.

304
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,824
I, for one, am cursed
to look incredibly attractive.

305
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,077
Now, you're going
to pluck up your courage,

306
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,038
walk out that door, and have
an incredible adventure.

307
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,206
Okay?

308
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,290
Okay.

309
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,003
Field Marshal Jojo, you're our top man.

310
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,338
Prepare to leave the house.

311
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,215
Is it dangerous?

312
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:11,716
Extremely.

313
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,553
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- Oh, Jesus.

314
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:16,680
Hey!

315
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,223
- Looking good, kid.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler!

316
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:21,518
<i>Frau</i> Betzler,
you're looking fetching as usual.

317
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,728
Okay, wow.

318
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,106
It's because of you
my son can't walk properly

319
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:27,315
and has a messed-up face.

320
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,859
He stole my hand grenade.

321
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,736
- Just took it--
- <i>Ja, ja.</i>

322
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,532
So, you are going to look after him
while I'm at work, hmm?

323
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,243
Make sure he has a job
and feels included. Got it?

324
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,578
Got it. <i>Ja,</i> I really got it.

325
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,123
Good.

326
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,208
Guys, this is Johannes Betzler.

327
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,668
The kid I told you about.

328
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,461
Remember, he stole a hand grenade

329
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,297
and blew himself up and as a result

330
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,382
I got demoted for negligence.

331
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,218
Now I get to work in this office
with all these wonderful kids.

332
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,848
So, Jojo. I'm sure we can figure out
something for you to do.

333
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,433
- Oh!
- Ideas?

334
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:02,559
<i>- Ja.</i>
- Guys?

335
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,144
<i>Ja. Ja.</i>

336
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:07,856
Okay, well, we need somebody
to walk the clones.

337
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:14,195
Also, I think maybe he could hand out
this new propaganda

338
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,532
and deliver these conscriptions.

339
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,493
I don't suppose
I could be conscripted?

340
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:21,578
Could I?

341
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,079
Oh, yes, that's a wonderful idea.

342
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,581
Yes, I give my full permission

343
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,666
for you to send
this ten-year-old child into war.

344
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,917
Will someone get this kid a gun?

345
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,961
And I'd be more than happy
to fight in the front.

346
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,046
Get in line, kid.

347
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,006
Okay. Here are the conscriptions,

348
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,132
and here is a gun.

349
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,759
Ooh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

350
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,093
It's a bit... for the gun?

351
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,219
No.

352
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:14,672
Yuck.

353
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,009
Look.

354
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:27,268
What did they do?

355
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,355
What they could.

356
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:32,774
Come on.

357
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,042
Hey-hey! Jojo Rabbit!

358
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,421
Oh, look at your face.

359
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:57,715
I am a soldier! I'm going to war!

360
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,634
And you are a postman!

361
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:04,722
Jojo Rabbit, Jojo Rabbit!

362
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:06,558
Mama?

363
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,311
Field Marshal Jojo is home.

364
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:13,857
Mama?

365
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,073
Mama? I'm home.

366
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:25,827
Mama?

367
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:44,762
Mama?

368
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:56,728
Hi.

369
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,353
What do you want?

370
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,438
Are you a ghost?

371
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:43,441
Sure. A ghost.

372
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,035
Don't make me run, kid.

373
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,370
I'm far too hungry

374
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,413
and you know how much
we love the taste of blood.

375
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,296
Lose something?

376
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,801
I'm not a ghost, Johannes.
I'm something worse,

377
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:12,011
but I think you already
know that, don't you?

378
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:13,680
You know what I am.

379
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,140
- No.
- Yes.

380
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:17,684
Say it.

381
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:19,602
Say it!

382
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:21,312
A Jew.

383
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:23,606
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

384
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,193
You can't be here.

385
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:30,613
Well, your mother invited me,
so I suppose that makes me her guest.

386
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:33,908
- It's not allowed.
- What will you do, sweet <i>Hitlerchen?</i>

387
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:34,992
Hmm?

388
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:39,455
Of course.

389
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:42,375
Go on, then. Tell them.

390
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,337
But do you know what happens if you do?

391
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,632
I'll tell them you helped me.

392
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,634
And your mother, too.

393
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,761
Then we'll all be <i>kaputt.</i>

394
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:58,808
And if you tell her you know
about me, just one word...

395
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,437
I'll do the world a great, big favor

396
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,272
and cut your Nazi head off.

397
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,607
Got it?

398
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,276
<i>Ja.</i>

399
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,747
I think I'll hold onto this. It's pretty.

400
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,798
Sheesh. That was intense.

401
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:33,509
- What am I going to do?
- Honestly, no idea.

402
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,136
I mean, there could be more of them.

403
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,138
Hundreds of them living in your walls.

404
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,392
How did she get control like that?

405
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:42,769
She must've used her powers.

406
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:43,853
Mind control.

407
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,521
Oh, typical.

408
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,899
- Did you see how fast she moved?
- Yes.

409
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,526
Like a little, female Jewish Jesse Owens.

410
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,279
- And now she's got your fancy knife.
- My knife!

411
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:56,115
Yeah. Like a little, female
Jewish Jesse Owens,

412
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,283
Jack the Ripper.

413
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,911
You're definitely in a pickle, my friend.

414
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,662
Ah, what to do, what to do?

415
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,247
- Oh. Got it!
- Got it!

416
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,749
- I will negotiate.
- Burn down the house

417
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,083
and blame Winston Churchill.

418
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,753
Or negotiate. Hmm.

419
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,895
Excuse me?

420
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,648
Little girl?

421
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:32,944
Um... Jew girl in the wall?

422
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,532
Yoo-hoo. Jew?

423
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:48,501
Okay, well, I'll just say
what I have to say and that's this:

424
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,752
I'm not scared of you

425
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,712
and I think you should find
somewhere else to live.

426
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:53,714
Okay?

427
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,259
Not okay.

428
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,933
Get the hell out of my room.

429
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:07,854
She's pretty rude, you know.

430
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:09,939
That's just my two Pfennige.

431
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,692
- And now she's got two knives.
- I know!

432
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:15,570
- How are you going to chop up stuff?
- I don't know!

433
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:16,863
Oh, and she's still up there, too.

434
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,739
That-- that thing, that, that...

435
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:20,449
- Jew.
- Yeah. Jew, yeah.

436
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,827
- What are we gonna do about that Jew?
- You think of something.

437
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,787
Oh, now I'm the expert?

438
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:27,456
Stop offering me
damned cigarettes! I'm ten!

439
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,667
All right. Sorry. I'm stressed out!

440
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,128
Okay, let's talk like turkeys.

441
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,047
You can't tell your mother
or that Jew will cut <i>off</i> your Nazi head,

442
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:38,718
but there's no reason this thing
in the attic needs to ruin your life.

443
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:41,971
In fact, you could use it
to your advantage.

444
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:42,972
How?

445
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,099
When someone tries to use
mind powers on me,

446
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,100
know what I do?

447
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,810
Use mind powers back on them.

448
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:50,438
Remember last year
when that one-arm pirate von Stauffenberg

449
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:51,981
tried to blow me up with a table bomb?

450
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,107
Yeah, you survived.

451
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,191
Correctomundo.

452
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,484
The only reason I survived,

453
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,320
apart from having bombproof legs,

454
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,989
is because I outwitted old von Stauffy.

455
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,826
I let him think that I was dead, when
in actual fact, I was absolutely fine.

456
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,163
By pretending I was dead,
I drew out all the traitors.

457
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,414
So what are you going to do?

458
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:09,999
Pretend I'm dead?

459
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,918
Exactly. Wait, no.

460
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,337
No, what I mean is this:

461
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,297
make her feel safe
and then she'll drop her guard

462
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,882
and then you will be the one in control.

463
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,843
- Reverse psychology.
- Don't complicate things.

464
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,762
Just use my backwards mind power trick,

465
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,138
and everything will be fine.

466
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,057
Ooh! I gotta go.

467
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,059
We're having unicorn for dinner
at my place tonight.

468
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:30,770
Concentrate, Jojo.

469
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,813
Remember, a Jew living in your wall

470
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:35,232
is better than two Jews flying around
with their bat wings

471
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,401
climbing down chimneys
and eating innocent Nazis.

472
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,488
And don't give her any more knives.

473
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:41,572
<i>Tschüss.</i>

474
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:09,475
Darling cub, why are you up, huh?

475
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:11,936
Did you eat anything, hmm?

476
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,145
Sorry, I lost track of time.

477
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,814
I was taking a long walk
and having a thing--

478
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:18,192
What are we going to do
with these laces, huh? My goodness.

479
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,152
You'll learn how to tie them
eventually, no?

480
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:21,696
- I heard her.
- What?

481
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:23,447
Who?

482
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:25,908
Inge.

483
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,452
Her ghost.

484
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:31,831
Oh. That's so sad for you.

485
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,458
You've lost your mind.

486
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:37,545
It's sadder for me, though, because I have
to live with a crazy person.

487
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,508
I heard noises. Upstairs.

488
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:45,845
Ghosts? Honestly.
You know what I heard? Rats.

489
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,847
Yes, we have them. Can you believe that?

490
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,432
Dirty animals.

491
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,018
I've been meaning to tell you
to stay away from upstairs,

492
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,394
until I've cleared them all, okay?

493
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:54,562
I don't need you getting sick.

494
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,313
Okay, Mama.

495
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,525
I'll watch out for those dirty rats.

496
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,778
Where are all the goddamn knives?

497
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,045
Are you going to bed, too?

498
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:22,089
Yes. Soon.

499
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:23,799
I have to tidy some things first.

500
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,426
What things?

501
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,429
Mama things.

502
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,597
Boy, you have to trust me, okay?

503
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,265
I'm the boss here, <i>ja?</i>

504
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,642
I guess.

505
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,978
Good boy.

506
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:38,731
Yes, but with-- with one eye. Like...

507
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:41,358
Almost.

508
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:43,235
Not quite.

509
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,117
Great. You got it.

510
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:51,619
<i>Ja.</i>

511
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,834
You have to be more quiet.

512
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,211
He heard noises up here.

513
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:03,839
If I have to choose
between you and my son, I...

514
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,846
I won't know where to send you.

515
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:11,889
You hear me?

516
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,892
He can't know.
If he knows, then they know.

517
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:19,313
- You could reason with him.
- You don't know him.

518
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,731
He's a fanatic.

519
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,025
It took him three weeks
to get over the fact

520
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,527
that his grandfather was not blond.

521
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,696
I know he's in there somewhere.

522
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:31,617
The little boy who loves
to play and runs to you

523
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,452
because he's scared of thunder.

524
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,579
Thinks you invented chocolate cake.

525
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,251
In the end, that's all you have.

526
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:42,878
Hope...

527
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:46,465
that your only remaining child
is not just another ghost.

528
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,719
Perhaps we're all ghosts now.
We just don't know it.

529
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,264
Perhaps.

530
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,434
You've lived more lifetimes than most.

531
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,980
I haven't lived at all.

532
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,859
You're being challenged.

533
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,487
They say you can't live,
that you won't live.

534
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,656
If that comes true, then they win.

535
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:11,907
They've been winning so far.

536
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,870
They'll never win.
That's the power you have.

537
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:19,165
As long as there's someone alive,
somewhere, then they lose.

538
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,877
They didn't get you yesterday or today.
You make tomorrow the same.

539
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:27,339
Hey.

540
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,092
Tomorrow must be the same.

541
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:02,291
Jesus Christ!

542
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,751
You must stretch.

543
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,002
Does that hurt you?

544
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,546
- Yes.
- Good. Pain is your friend.

545
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:11,342
Soon your leg will only be
a little bit deformed and pointless.

546
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,928
I'm going to recommend
another month off school though

547
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:16,472
because your face
might scare the other kids.

548
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,307
It's kind of ugly.

549
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,226
Okay, who's next?

550
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,357
Jojo.

551
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,733
Baby, I have to go.

552
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:33,155
I'll see you at home. Mmm.

553
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,872
- Hi, Captain K.
- Hey.

554
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:44,250
- If it isn't <i>Herr</i> Hand Grenade himself.
- Ah.

555
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,584
How's the leg, kid?

556
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,212
It's pretty much healed.

557
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,673
It only 80 percent hurts now.

558
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,299
What are you guys doing?

559
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:54,093
I'm being made to teach the HJ boys

560
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:55,511
water warfare training.

561
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,682
You know, in case they ever need
to go to battle in a swimming pool.

562
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:05,354
Can I ask you a question about Jews?

563
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,356
Oh, God. Why?

564
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,610
What should I do if I see one?

565
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:12,778
Ugh. Okay.

566
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,489
If you see a Jew, you tell us,

567
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,616
we tell the Gestapo, and they tell the SS,

568
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,285
and then they go and they kill the Jew.

569
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,287
And anyone who helped the Jew.

570
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:24,248
And because these are very paranoid times,

571
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,166
probably some other people just in case.

572
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,793
It's a pretty drawn out process.

573
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:31,380
Even if the Jew hypnotized someone

574
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,299
to make them hide
the Jew in the first place?

575
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:35,009
I'd be amazed if that could happen.

576
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,385
No, it can happen.

577
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,767
It happened to my uncle.

578
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,477
A Jew hypnotized him

579
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:48,397
and he became
a massive drunk and a gambler.

580
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,107
And he cheated on his wife

581
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,652
and he had an inappropriate
relationship with my sister.

582
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:56,655
And then he drowned
in an unrelated accident,

583
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:59,033
but it was the Jew's fault.

584
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,577
Anyway. Did you see one? A Jew.

585
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,331
I'm not sure I'd be able to tell if I did.

586
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,332
Yeah, me neither.

587
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:08,375
Without their funny hats,
it's damn near impossible.

588
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,711
Someone should write a book
on the subject.

589
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,296
It would make things
so much easier.

590
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,214
- It would be a hit.
<i>- Ja.</i>

591
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,093
Finkie, they're drowning. Come on.

592
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,512
I'll see you later, little man.

593
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:43,035
Okay, here's the situation.

594
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:47,039
If I tell on you,
you'll be in big trouble,

595
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,582
and I don't think you want that.

596
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:52,127
But then you'll tell on me and my mother,
and we'll be in trouble,

597
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,796
which I don't want.

598
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:57,257
And if you tell my mother I know,
then she'll kick you out,

599
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:58,675
which you don't want.

600
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:01,220
And if I tell my mother I know,

601
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,098
then you'll cut off my Nazi head,

602
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:06,683
which I also don't want.

603
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,853
So, it's a Mexican stalemate.

604
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,439
It's just a normal stalemate.

605
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:14,900
I have some conditions
for allowing you to stay here.

606
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,693
- "Conditions?"
- Yes.

607
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:20,155
Tell me everything about the Jewish race.

608
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:21,907
Okay.

609
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,952
We're like you,

610
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,621
but human.

611
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,456
Please take this seriously.

612
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,251
Think of this as an exposé.

613
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:33,961
I want to know all your secrets.

614
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,423
Kindly refrain from sitting
on my sister's bed.

615
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,716
Why? She doesn't need it.

616
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,802
You know nothing of my sister.

617
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,095
Inge and I were friends.

618
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,597
I remember you.

619
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:47,724
Such a funny little boy.

620
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:49,893
Pfft. Enough with the small talk.

621
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:51,895
Start telling me about your kind.

622
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,191
Obviously, we are demons who love money.

623
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:57,401
Right?

624
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,486
Obviously. Everyone knows that.

625
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:03,657
But what people don't know
is that we're also allergic to food.

626
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,243
Cheese, bread, meat.

627
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,953
That stuff will kill us instantly.

628
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,706
So, if you're thinking of ending my life,

629
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,541
that's the fastest way.

630
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,293
Also biscuits, lethal.

631
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,422
Very funny.

632
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:21,049
Anyway, there's not enough food for you,

633
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,593
so I don't know what you're going to do.

634
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,803
Your mother managed to find me some bread.

635
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:28,891
She's kind. She treats me like a person.

636
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,018
But you're not. Not a proper person.

637
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,352
Are you?

638
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,899
How dare you, Jew!

639
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:40,444
You are weak like an eyelash.

640
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:43,363
I am born of Aryan ancestry.

641
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:47,075
My blood is the color of a pure red rose.

642
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,785
And my eyes are blue like--

643
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,413
Break free.

644
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:56,418
Break free, great Aryan.
There are no weak Jews.

645
00:38:57,211 --> 00:39:00,422
I am descended from those
who wrestle angels and kill giants.

646
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,341
We were chosen by God.

647
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,427
You were chosen by a pathetic little man

648
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:07,387
who can't even grow a full mustache.

649
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,891
The stronger race, huh?

650
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:22,528
So, how's it all going
with that Jew thing upstairs?

651
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:24,655
Well, she doesn't want to talk to me.

652
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,698
Mm-hmm. Well, you are a Nazi.

653
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:28,367
I guess.

654
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,994
This book is going to be harder to write
than I thought.

655
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:32,746
Hmm.

656
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,710
What's she doing?
She's burning something.

657
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:40,462
What is she burning?

658
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:42,923
- What are you burning?
- She can't hear you.

659
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,758
What are you burning?

660
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,521
Why so happy?

661
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:58,939
Things are changing.

662
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,482
The Allies have taken Italy.

663
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:02,776
France will be next
and soon the war will be over.

664
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,904
Goddamn it! Why does that make you happy?

665
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:07,447
You hate your country that much?

666
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:09,366
I love my country. It's the war I hate.

667
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,076
It's pointless and stupid,

668
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,744
and the sooner we have peace, the better.

669
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,329
Oh, the war will end.

670
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,957
We will crush our enemies into dust.

671
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,417
And when they are destroyed,

672
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,960
we shall use their graves as toilets.

673
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,878
Okay. No more politics.

674
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:24,256
Dinner is neutral ground.
This table is Switzerland.

675
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,549
Let's eat.

676
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:35,726
You aren't eating.

677
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,730
No. I am not that hungry.

678
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:41,481
I might eat later.

679
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:43,984
For now, I am just going
to chew on these grapes.

680
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:50,407
Well, I'm especially hungry tonight.

681
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,201
So maybe I'll just finish yours.

682
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,370
Don't want it to go to waste.

683
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:12,095
How was your day, Johannes?

684
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,723
Oh, you know, just wandered around,

685
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,767
being a deformed kid
with nothing to live for.

686
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,060
You're not deformed.

687
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:21,938
My face looks like
a goddamn street map, woman.

688
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,442
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

689
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,986
If my father were here, he'd get it.

690
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,780
Well, he's not.

691
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:33,742
I know. And instead, I'm stuck with you.

692
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,119
You want your dad, eh?

693
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:37,204
Yeah, I do.

694
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,247
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

695
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:40,540
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

696
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:41,541
Fine.

697
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:57,099
Don't you ever talk
to your goddamn mother like that!

698
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:15,951
Paul, what happened?

699
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:18,537
Paul?

700
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,122
I yelled at the kid.

701
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,457
What? Go apologize.

702
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:26,837
Sorry, kid.

703
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,213
What?

704
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,840
What kind of apology was that?

705
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:40,475
Sorry, kid.

706
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:45,689
Jojo...

707
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,984
I know you miss me, but I'm...

708
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,404
I'm out there trying to make
a difference in the world.

709
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,573
And while I'm gone,

710
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:58,118
I need you to take care of my Rosie.

711
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:00,746
Can you do that?

712
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:04,833
Yes, Dad.

713
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:06,543
Thanks.

714
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:09,671
She's doing what she can.

715
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:15,135
Oh, gosh. We made a good kid, huh?

716
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,264
Mm-mm! Damn, that's good.

717
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:22,976
It reminds me of dancing
with Rosie in The Red Salon.

718
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:25,187
You remember, honey?

719
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,646
Of course I do, babe.

720
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:38,742
Hey, don't just
sit there, kid.

721
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:39,826
Come.

722
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,411
Dance with your parents, come.

723
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:33,004
So, I'd like you to draw
a picture of where Jews live.

724
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:35,423
Where you all eat, sleep,

725
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:37,467
and where the queen Jew lays the eggs.

726
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:39,511
You really are an idiot.

727
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:40,971
Come on. We have
a lot of work to do.

728
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,682
Tell me about your family.

729
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:44,850
I'll tell you about the Jews,

730
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,935
but you are not privileged
to know about my family.

731
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,645
But I need background.

732
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,856
Why are you hanging around with me?

733
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:52,107
Don't you have any friends?

734
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,733
Of course. Yorki.

735
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:55,360
- "Yorki?"
- Amongst others.

736
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,821
Well, you don't have anyone.

737
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,114
I have Nathan.

738
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,199
"Nathan?" Who the hell is that?

739
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:04,244
- My fiancé. I have him.
- Where is he?

740
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,580
Fighting in the resistance, see.

741
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,334
He proposed to me
on the banks of the <i>Fluß.</i>

742
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:15,630
He knelt down like a proper gentleman,
recited a poem by Rilke.

743
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:18,300
And when I said yes,
we danced into the night.

744
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,135
Snore.

745
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:21,219
Who's Rilke?

746
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:23,305
A great poet. Nathan's favorite.

747
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,015
Oh, Nathan's favorite? Yay.

748
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:27,684
He's coming to rescue me,
then we'll go live in Paris.

749
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:30,520
You'd turn your back on Germany forever?

750
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,731
It turned on me first.

751
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,608
Well, we don't need you.

752
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:36,902
You and your stupid boyfriend can shut up

753
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:41,531
and go live in damn
cheese, snail, baguette land.

754
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,326
Now, now, just because
you don't have a girlfriend.

755
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,077
I'm way too busy for a girlfriend.

756
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:47,454
One day, you'll make time.

757
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:50,206
You'll think of nothing else.

758
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:53,752
You'll meet someone and spend your days

759
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:56,796
dreaming of the moment
you can hold them in your arms again.

760
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,257
That's love.

761
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,511
- Ridiculous.
- Finished.

762
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,232
I said to draw where Jews live.

763
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:18,860
This is just a stupid picture of my head.

764
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,237
Yeah. That's where we live.

765
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:30,538
Rilke, Rilke, Rilke.

766
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:33,541
Where are you? Poetry-writing dumb head.

767
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:34,668
Ah.

768
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,170
Yes. Great thinking, Rabbit.

769
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:40,298
We'll use all of these books to make
a fake floor that she'll fall through.

770
00:46:40,382 --> 00:46:42,759
Straight into a pit full of piranhas

771
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:45,595
and-- and lava and bacon.

772
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,681
- Why, she won't know what hit her.
- Shh!

773
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:49,140
- Shh?
- Shh!

774
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:50,850
You shush. Shush me?

775
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:53,103
Let's get a book and let's go.
Libraries are dumb.

776
00:46:57,816 --> 00:47:01,653
Yeah, this is a really good idea,
what we're doing right now.

777
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:05,323
If she had a heart,
this would break it clean in two.

778
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,911
I have something to tell you.

779
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:13,540
I came across an old letter from Nathan,

780
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,251
your fiancé, addressed to you.

781
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:19,254
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'll just read it.

782
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:24,884
"Dear Elsa, this is hard for me to say,

783
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:27,595
"but I don't want to marry you anymore.

784
00:47:28,722 --> 00:47:31,182
"I found a new woman and we laugh a lot

785
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:33,018
"and do the tongue-kiss.

786
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:35,520
"It's like my favorite poet, Rilke, says,

787
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:40,525
"'We need in love to practice only this:
letting each other go.'

788
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,361
"So, goodbye and sorry
about letting you go.

789
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:47,615
"From Nathan, your ex-fiancé.

790
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:51,036
"PS, I'm not really in the resistance.

791
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,203
"I was lying.

792
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:54,914
I'm unemployed and quite fat now."

793
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,943
Um... don't open the door,

794
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:28,198
but I actually forgot
there was a second letter.

795
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:31,659
"Dear Elsa...

796
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:36,456
"I just wanted to let you know that
I don't want to break up with you now.

797
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:41,211
"I changed my mind because I don't
want you to kill yourself over me,

798
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:43,630
"which a couple of girls
have done in the past,

799
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:45,090
"and it's pretty stressful.

800
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:47,675
"I need you to stay alive.

801
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:50,178
"Thank God you're being
taken care of by that kid

802
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:54,432
"who I must say is a remarkable young man
beyond his years.

803
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:55,809
"And brave, too.

804
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,852
"And let's still get married sometime,

805
00:48:57,936 --> 00:48:59,813
"even though I am truly unemployed

806
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:01,439
"and have nothing going on for me.

807
00:49:02,524 --> 00:49:05,485
Yours, Nathan."

808
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:15,703
- Beethoven.
- Einstein.

809
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:17,163
- Bach.
- Gershwin.

810
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:19,165
Brahms. Wagner. Mozart.

811
00:49:19,249 --> 00:49:20,750
Musicians, is that all you have?

812
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:21,835
Rilke.

813
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:23,336
Oh, yeah, of course.

814
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:25,588
Your favorite, Rilke. Jewish mother.

815
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:26,673
Dietrich, then.

816
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:28,341
Houdini.

817
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,802
No. That's impossible.

818
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:31,970
Believe it, brother.

819
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:35,014
Just ask Pissarro, Modigliani,
Man Ray, Gertrude Stein,

820
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:38,476
Mr. Moses and the king of them all,
Jesus Christi. Amen.

821
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,853
Pew, pew, pew!

822
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:41,688
Well, you're just saying any old name now.

823
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:44,482
I've never heard of these people
and now I'm fed up.

824
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:45,942
Hey.

825
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,695
If you find any more of those letters,
will you let me know?

826
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:50,238
Sure.

827
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,656
Okay.

828
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:52,740
Bye.

829
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,496
Ah, these banks
used to be full of lovers.

830
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,875
There was dancing and singing.

831
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:04,169
Romance.

832
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:07,130
There's no time for romance.

833
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:08,506
We're at war.

834
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:11,426
Oh. There's always time
for romance.

835
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,887
Someday you'll meet someone special.

836
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,806
Why does everyone keep telling me that?

837
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:19,267
Who else tells you that?

838
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,145
Everyone.

839
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:23,521
Anyway.

840
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:24,939
It's a stupid idea.

841
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:26,774
You're stupid.

842
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:29,444
Love is the strongest thing in the world.

843
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:33,448
I think you'll find that metal
is the strongest thing in the world.

844
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:36,326
Followed closely by dynamite,
and then muscles.

845
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:40,288
Besides, I wouldn't
even know it if I saw it.

846
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:42,498
Surprise, surprise.

847
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:44,542
Your shoelaces are undone again.

848
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:47,962
Oh, Jojo.

849
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:49,881
You'll know when it happens.

850
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,800
You'll feel it.

851
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:53,885
It's a pain.

852
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,471
- In my arse, I bet.
- In your tummy.

853
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,973
Like, like, you're full of butterflies.

854
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:02,060
- Yuck.
- Yeah, "yuck."

855
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,772
Come on, Shitler. Let's get a move on.

856
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:08,858
Whoa!

857
00:51:08,942 --> 00:51:10,652
- Hey!
- What's wrong with you?

858
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:13,863
I'm worried about you, man.
Are you drunk? Again?

859
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:15,114
Come on. Oh, God.

860
00:51:15,198 --> 00:51:17,033
Could you please untie them?

861
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,244
- You're really getting fat.
- I'm not--

862
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:21,829
You know what? Why don't I
just leave you here, okay?

863
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,498
- No.
- I'll come and get you tomorrow.

864
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,291
- Okay? How about that?
- No. Mama, Mama!

865
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:26,542
You'll figure it out, darling.

866
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:28,211
- No!
- I'll meet you back at the house.

867
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:29,712
- I'll see you tomorrow morning.
- Mama, Mama!

868
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:32,757
You're growing up too fast.

869
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,803
Ten-year-olds shouldn't be celebrating war
and talking politics.

870
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:39,555
You should be climbing trees

871
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,808
and then falling out of those trees.

872
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:43,935
But the <i>Führer</i> says when we win

873
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,688
it is us, young boys
who will rule the world.

874
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:47,730
Pfft!

875
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:50,608
The <i>Reich</i> is dying.

876
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:54,487
We're going to lose the war
and then what are you going to do, hmm?

877
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,989
Life is a gift.

878
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:57,865
We must celebrate it.

879
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:02,787
We have to dance to show God
we are grateful to be alive.

880
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,337
Well, I won't dance.

881
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:13,506
Dancing is for people
who don't have a job.

882
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,550
Dancing is for people who are free.

883
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,468
It's an escape from all this.

884
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:20,305
Well, you're free to dance your way home.

885
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:21,931
I'll ride.

886
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:23,141
Oh, no, you don't.

887
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:24,684
No one can stop me.

888
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:45,997
Welcome home, boys!

889
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,832
Now, go home and kiss your mothers!

890
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:10,438
No news from Nathan today, I'm afraid.

891
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,690
He's probably doing something amazing,

892
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:14,734
like reading a book or growing a beard.

893
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:19,572
What's wrong?

894
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,118
You want me to tell you about the Jews?

895
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:26,245
Don't care.

896
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:30,291
In the beginning,
we used to live in caves.

897
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,711
- Deep, deep in the center of the Earth.
- Wait.

898
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:37,757
Scary places full of strange
and wonderful creatures

899
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,258
all with one thing in common.

900
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:41,552
Mm-hmm. Stealing the ends of penises?

901
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:43,554
No, you idiot.

902
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:46,015
- The love of art.
- No cutting penises <i>off?</i>

903
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:47,266
Do you want the story or not?

904
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:49,852
You may continue, but I know it's true.

905
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:51,062
The penis thing.

906
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:52,480
Rabbis use them for earplugs.

907
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:54,190
And moving on.

908
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:58,277
After many years
of developing magic and spells,

909
00:53:58,361 --> 00:54:02,240
we slowly moved out of
the caves and into the towns.

910
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:05,743
Some of us stayed in the caves,
though, in animal bodies.

911
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:08,538
Which are blobs or something?

912
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:10,039
Well, I'll draw them for you.

913
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:24,762
There.

914
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,348
It'd be better with color.

915
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:29,058
Where's the horns?

916
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:30,184
Under the hair.

917
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:32,770
Where's yours?

918
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:34,605
I'm too young.

919
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:37,483
- They grow when you turn 21.
- Oh.

920
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:40,027
These days we live
among normal people,

921
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:42,196
but often we take over a house

922
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,866
and hang from the ceiling when we sleep.

923
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,033
Like bats.

924
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:50,204
Oh, and another thing is
we can read each other's minds.

925
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:52,123
Oh, my God.

926
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,541
Everyone's minds?

927
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,127
- What about German minds?
- No.

928
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,546
Their heads are too thick
for us to penetrate.

929
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:03,593
Like birds, our true language
sounds like singing.

930
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:08,389
And we're also attracted to shiny things.

931
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:13,227
Crystals, glass, and gold.

932
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:17,190
"Attracted to shiny things."

933
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:19,650
But also ugly things.

934
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,402
Jews love ugliness.

935
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:23,279
That's another thing we learned at school.

936
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,364
You love them, yes?

937
00:55:26,032 --> 00:55:27,116
Ugly things.

938
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:35,333
Hi.

939
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,043
You two seem to be getting on well.

940
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,879
I was just making sure
she was still alive.

941
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:41,506
- What do you care?
- I don't.

942
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:44,467
I just don't want
a dead person in my house.

943
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,761
- How would you like it?
- I'd love it.

944
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,721
More dead people in my house, please.

945
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,973
Look, just all the time
you two are spending together,

946
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:53,017
it's making me feel very uncomfortable.

947
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,769
You suggested it in the first place.

948
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:55,895
Did I?

949
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:57,480
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, I did.

950
00:55:57,563 --> 00:56:00,316
Besides, it's for the book.

951
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:02,735
Oh, God, you're right.

952
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,362
I'm sorry. Did I make it weird?

953
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:05,905
It's weird now, isn't it?

954
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,032
It shouldn't be weird between us.

955
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,243
None of this should be weird.

956
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,120
It's fine. I'm just tired.
I'm going to bed.

957
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:15,122
<i>Ja,</i> I was just keeping
your bed warm for you.

958
00:56:15,206 --> 00:56:17,124
'Cause that's what real friends do.

959
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,585
Hey, what do think about this uniform?

960
00:56:19,669 --> 00:56:21,295
I'm not sure about the hips on the pants.

961
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:22,630
Should they be bigger?

962
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,258
- You look great.
- Thank you.

963
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:28,761
Now, listen, Jojo. Can I give you
some really good advice?

964
00:56:29,262 --> 00:56:31,055
When you see what's in her mind

965
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:33,724
and where she's trying
to make you go in your mind,

966
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:37,103
in your mind, you must go the other way.

967
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:38,354
Get what I'm saying?

968
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,773
Do not let her put you in a brain prison.

969
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,191
That, dear Jojo,

970
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:45,611
is one thing that cannot
and must not ever,

971
00:56:45,695 --> 00:56:47,446
ever happen to a German!

972
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:51,325
Do not let your German brain
be bossed around!

973
00:56:52,535 --> 00:56:56,122
I won't let her boss
my German brain around, <i>mein Führer.</i>

974
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:57,456
Try not to.

975
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:02,962
Now, I think you've got
a lot of good information in your book.

976
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:05,339
It's time to show it
to the world, don't you think?

977
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:07,216
<i>Ja.</i>

978
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:12,513
- Adolf?
- Hmm?

979
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:13,931
Do you think I'm ugly?

980
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,058
Yes.

981
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,235
Is he asleep?

982
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:27,945
Mmm.

983
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:29,822
He's different.

984
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:34,035
He suspects something.
He thinks Inge's ghost lives up here.

985
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:40,041
You remind me of her. You really do.

986
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:44,003
I would love to have seen her
grow into a woman.

987
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:49,717
But I'll have to watch you instead.

988
00:57:55,014 --> 00:57:57,224
I don't know anything about being a woman.

989
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:00,186
Is that what it is?

990
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:03,105
You do things like drink wine?

991
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,026
Sure. You drink.

992
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,111
Champagne, if you're happy.

993
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:11,113
Champagne, if you're sad.

994
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:14,450
You drive a car.

995
00:58:15,368 --> 00:58:17,244
Gamble if you want.

996
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:18,996
Own diamonds.

997
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,956
Learn how to fire a gun.

998
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,500
You travel to Morocco.

999
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:24,210
Take up lovers.

1000
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:25,628
Make them suffer.

1001
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:28,005
You look a tiger in the eye.

1002
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:31,050
And trust without fear.

1003
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,968
That's what it is to be a woman.

1004
00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:35,513
How do you do that?

1005
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:39,558
How do you know you can trust someone?

1006
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,186
You trust them.

1007
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:45,564
Good night.

1008
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,653
All those other things.

1009
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:52,905
Did you do that stuff?

1010
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:57,660
You know, go to Morocco and the rest?

1011
00:58:58,744 --> 00:58:59,995
No.

1012
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,789
I never looked a tiger in the eye.

1013
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:23,310
Finkel, I meant we'd need dogs
for when the city is attacked,

1014
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:25,980
not actual German shepherds.

1015
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:28,774
Get them out of here.

1016
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,068
Get them out of here!

1017
00:59:31,152 --> 00:59:35,030
- Now! Now! Now!
- Move along, please. Move along, please.

1018
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:36,866
Thank you, thank you.

1019
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,163
- I'm sorry for yelling at you.
- I feel so stupid.

1020
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:44,749
No, no. It's a silly name for a dog.
I should've been more clear.

1021
00:59:44,832 --> 00:59:46,584
- You're doing a great job.
- <i>Danke.</i>

1022
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:50,796
Hiya, kid.

1023
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,923
How can we help you today, Master Betzler?

1024
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:54,467
What's up? Walk with me.

1025
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:57,928
If someone turned in a Jew,
would they get a medal or something?

1026
00:59:58,012 --> 01:00:00,723
Jews, Jews, Jews. You're still going on
about those people?

1027
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:03,392
You know I'm preparing the city
for imminent invasion, right?

1028
01:00:03,476 --> 01:00:05,561
I'm trying to plan a defense strategy.

1029
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:07,188
I've got Americans to the west,

1030
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:08,814
got Russians to the east.

1031
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:11,901
My friend once met some Russians,
and they ate him.

1032
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:14,904
Who's the walnuts?

1033
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:16,280
Walnuts are just walnuts, kid.

1034
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,073
What do you want to talk about?

1035
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:20,409
Well, I am learning a lot about Jews.

1036
01:00:20,493 --> 01:00:23,454
Did you know Jews
can read each other's minds?

1037
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:26,457
And when they sleep,
they hang from the ceiling, like bats.

1038
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,585
That's fascinating. And where did you
come by this information?

1039
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,173
Research. I'm writing a book.

1040
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:36,008
Oh, congratulations. What's it called?

1041
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:38,052
<i>Yoohoo Jew.</i>

1042
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,595
It's an exposé on Jews.

1043
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,599
You could also call it <i>Who Are You, Jew?</i>

1044
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:47,269
Or what about <i>Jews News?</i>

1045
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:50,523
Oh, you do have
a wonderful imagination on you.

1046
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:53,108
- But it's real.
- Ja, of course it's real.

1047
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:56,529
When I was your age,
I had an imaginary friend called Conny.

1048
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:58,489
He used to wet my bed when I was asleep.

1049
01:00:58,572 --> 01:00:59,949
He got me in so much trouble.

1050
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:02,409
Hey, come here. You might like
to check out what I'm working on.

1051
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,371
As part of our preparations
for the invasion,

1052
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,747
I'm redesigning my uniform.

1053
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:09,792
Note, the feathers for aerodynamics,

1054
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:11,544
the sparkly color to dazzle the enemy,

1055
01:01:11,627 --> 01:01:13,587
the boots purely decorative.

1056
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:14,839
And this,

1057
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:18,425
this is a Gatling gun mounted with a radio

1058
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:22,638
which emits annoying music
to dishearten the enemy.

1059
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:24,557
This is all copyrighted, by the way.

1060
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,808
That means you can't copy it.

1061
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:27,977
<i>Ja.</i> Don't get any ideas, kid.

1062
01:01:30,938 --> 01:01:33,524
The kids tell me that
your father's away fighting.

1063
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:36,402
So it appears you are now
the man of the house. How's that going?

1064
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:38,696
It's okay.

1065
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:40,698
<i>Ja?</i>

1066
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:43,576
So, what jobs do you have for me today?

1067
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:44,952
Well, I've got one, I won't lie.

1068
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,787
It's a bit of a step down
from what you're used to,

1069
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:49,665
but we need all hands on deck right now.

1070
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,377
Metal for Hitler!

1071
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,422
Pots and pans for the war effort!

1072
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:59,091
♪ <i>Here comes the metal man</i> ♪

1073
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:01,886
♪ <i>Looking for your pots and pans</i> ♪

1074
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:04,889
- Metal for Hitler!
- Metal for Hitler!

1075
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:06,098
Nuts and bolts!

1076
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:07,349
Pots and pans!

1077
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:31,165
"Free Germany."

1078
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:37,588
Jojo?

1079
01:02:39,048 --> 01:02:40,883
- Yorki?
- Hi!

1080
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:45,846
You're a soldier now?

1081
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,514
At your service.

1082
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:49,308
But you're only 11.

1083
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:50,601
I know.

1084
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,519
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

1085
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:53,938
Is that paper?

1086
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:58,108
That's what I thought at first, too,
but it's "paper-like."

1087
01:02:58,192 --> 01:02:59,735
It's the latest material

1088
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,862
invented by our top scientists.

1089
01:03:01,946 --> 01:03:04,281
Well, I'm impressed.

1090
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:06,241
Hey, Yorki.

1091
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:10,037
I caught a Jew. A real one.

1092
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,705
Oh, a Jew?

1093
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:15,042
I saw some that they caught
hiding in the forest last month.

1094
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,544
Personally, I didn't see
what all the fuss was about.

1095
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:21,465
They weren't at all scary
and seemed kind of normal.

1096
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,342
Oh, I'm getting distracted.

1097
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:25,135
I got to go.

1098
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:26,595
Bye.

1099
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:28,013
- Bye.
- Oh, my God.

1100
01:03:28,097 --> 01:03:29,807
It's so hard to run in this thing.

1101
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:37,147
I found these.

1102
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:41,235
You can have them.
They're probably broken.

1103
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:42,611
Doesn't mean anything.

1104
01:03:43,362 --> 01:03:45,406
Maybe you can draw something for my book.

1105
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:49,743
I could draw you again.

1106
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:51,912
No one wants to see pictures of cripples.

1107
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,290
You're hardly a cripple.

1108
01:03:56,959 --> 01:04:00,587
Besides, true artists
don't see that stuff.

1109
01:04:00,671 --> 01:04:01,922
Blind artists, you mean.

1110
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:04,550
It's fine.

1111
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:06,719
I'll just accept I'll be one of those guys

1112
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:08,178
who'll never get to kiss a girl.

1113
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:10,764
You will be kissed, Jojo.

1114
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:13,851
Do you want me to kiss you?

1115
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:19,064
Okay.

1116
01:04:19,148 --> 01:04:20,399
Two things.

1117
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:22,609
Thing number one:

1118
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:25,571
It's illegal for Nazis and Jews
to hang out like we do,

1119
01:04:25,654 --> 01:04:27,322
let alone kiss.

1120
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:28,741
Thing number two:

1121
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:33,120
It'd just be a sympathy kiss,
which doesn't count.

1122
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:36,915
You're not a Nazi.

1123
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:38,584
Uh, I'm massively into swastikas,

1124
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:40,711
so I think that's
a pretty good sign right there.

1125
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:42,755
You're not a Nazi, Jojo.

1126
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:46,425
You're a ten-year-old kid
who likes swastikas

1127
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:48,302
and likes dressing up in a funny uniform

1128
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,012
and wants to be part of a club.

1129
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,723
But you are not one of them.

1130
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:55,434
Okay.

1131
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:58,896
Let's just agree to disagree.

1132
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,564
All right?

1133
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:02,441
"Not a Nazi."

1134
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:05,903
What a dirty Jew.

1135
01:05:56,787 --> 01:05:58,372
Come on. Hide.

1136
01:05:58,455 --> 01:05:59,581
Hurry. Go.

1137
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,589
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1138
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:09,925
Allow me to introduce myself.

1139
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:12,678
I'm Captain Herman Deertz
of the Falkenheim Gestapo.

1140
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:15,139
With me, <i>Herr</i> Mueller, <i>Herr</i> Junker,

1141
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:17,516
<i>Herr</i> Klum and <i>Herr</i> Frosch. May we come in?

1142
01:06:19,518 --> 01:06:21,061
Thank you so much.

1143
01:06:21,145 --> 01:06:22,354
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1144
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:23,564
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1145
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:25,023
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1146
01:06:25,107 --> 01:06:26,233
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1147
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:28,026
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1148
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:53,886
Hey, Jojo!

1149
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:55,137
Hey, guys!

1150
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,805
Good to see you!

1151
01:06:56,889 --> 01:07:00,184
My bicycle got a flat tire,
so I carried it.

1152
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:02,644
- Captain Klenzendorf. <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1153
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:03,770
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1154
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:04,980
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1155
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,356
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1156
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,441
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1157
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,610
You know Freddy Finkel.

1158
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:10,777
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1159
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:11,945
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1160
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:12,905
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1161
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:13,947
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1162
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:15,157
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1163
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,533
So, did I miss anything?

1164
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,536
No, no. We were just
<i>"Heil</i> Hitlering" the boy

1165
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:21,079
and then <i>"Heil</i> Hitlering" yourself

1166
01:07:21,163 --> 01:07:23,373
and then, of course,
<i>"Heil</i> Hitlering" Freddy Finkel

1167
01:07:23,457 --> 01:07:26,835
and now we are in the midst
of a routine inspection.

1168
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:29,630
And, uh, what brings you here, Captain?

1169
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:32,507
Oh, we were just passing by

1170
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:35,719
and we thought we'd drop <i>off</i>
some pamphlets for the boy.

1171
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:37,054
He works for us.

1172
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:40,891
- I see.
- <i>Ja.</i>

1173
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,602
- And yourself?
- Oh, you know how it is.

1174
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:46,438
Every day we take a call.
"Hello, is that the Gestapo?

1175
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:49,524
I believe there's a Communist
hiding behind my fridge."

1176
01:07:49,608 --> 01:07:51,985
We go around to investigate.
It's just some mold.

1177
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:53,820
So, not far off.

1178
01:07:54,655 --> 01:07:56,156
It's all part of the job.

1179
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,702
Oh!

1180
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:03,330
Now this is my kind
of little boy's bedroom.

1181
01:08:04,206 --> 01:08:05,582
Oh, yes.

1182
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:06,708
There he is.

1183
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:08,752
You and your friends
may have heard a rumor

1184
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,254
that Hitler only has one ball.

1185
01:08:10,337 --> 01:08:11,463
This is nonsense.

1186
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:12,547
He has four.

1187
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:18,220
So, you are volunteering
at the <i>Hitlerjugend</i> office, yes?

1188
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:20,013
Yes.

1189
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:21,723
Oh, good for you.

1190
01:08:21,807 --> 01:08:25,477
I wish more of our young boys
had your blind fanaticism.

1191
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:29,564
What on Earth are those oafs up to?

1192
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,401
Why don't we go upstairs and see, yes?

1193
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,284
Do you know where your mother is?

1194
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:43,996
No. I think she's in town.

1195
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:47,541
Has she been spending much time at home?

1196
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:50,460
She is quite busy.

1197
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:52,212
Is she?

1198
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:57,634
Well, I'm pleased to see
that you're wearing your...

1199
01:08:57,718 --> 01:08:59,052
<i>jugend</i> uniform,

1200
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:00,053
but...

1201
01:09:00,846 --> 01:09:02,431
where is your knife?

1202
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:08,186
You must always carry
your DJ knife. Where is it?

1203
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:12,274
- I left it...
- It's here.

1204
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:18,989
And who might you be?

1205
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:22,409
Well, who might you be?
And what are you doing in my house?

1206
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:24,828
You live here too?

1207
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:28,040
I'm his sister, Inge.

1208
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:31,668
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1209
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:34,338
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1210
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:35,756
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1211
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:36,798
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1212
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:37,799
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1213
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:38,759
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1214
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:40,177
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1215
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:41,720
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1216
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:45,265
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1217
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:47,559
I did not know
you had a sister, Johannes.

1218
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:49,770
Sometimes he'd prefer if I was dead.

1219
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:51,897
Isn't that right, little Frankenstein?

1220
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:54,232
Now, now. There is no need to attack

1221
01:09:54,316 --> 01:09:56,902
his hideous physical deformity.

1222
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:58,737
That is a war wound.

1223
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:02,240
But, uh, why do you have his knife?

1224
01:10:04,326 --> 01:10:07,245
I'm guarding my room because
he refuses to stay out of it.

1225
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:08,872
Well, what do you have hidden in there?

1226
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:11,666
Oh, you know, girl stuff.

1227
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:14,711
May I?

1228
01:10:14,795 --> 01:10:15,837
Naturally.

1229
01:10:22,511 --> 01:10:26,681
You see, we deal with
an inordinate number of reports,

1230
01:10:26,765 --> 01:10:31,186
denunciations and general investigations.

1231
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:33,146
And, of course, we are indeed interested

1232
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:36,108
in problems of crime
and anti-party sentiment,

1233
01:10:36,191 --> 01:10:39,194
but we still have one greater concern,

1234
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:42,447
that of the "Goldilockses."

1235
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:46,993
Sneaking around,
eating other people's food,

1236
01:10:47,786 --> 01:10:49,704
sleeping in their beds.

1237
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:51,790
It really is quite rude.

1238
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:54,960
I don't suppose I could see
your papers, could I?

1239
01:10:57,045 --> 01:10:59,506
Papers, Miss Betzler. Quickly, please.
We don't have all day.

1240
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:02,634
Yes, of course.

1241
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,215
How old are you in this photo?

1242
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:46,511
They're three years old.

1243
01:11:46,595 --> 01:11:47,846
I was 14.

1244
01:11:48,472 --> 01:11:49,598
Date of birth?

1245
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:53,518
First of May.

1246
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:55,645
1929.

1247
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:03,361
Correct. Thank you, Inge.

1248
01:12:03,445 --> 01:12:05,780
Get a new photo.
You look like a ghost in this one.

1249
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:06,865
Wait.

1250
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:13,330
What is...

1251
01:12:14,456 --> 01:12:15,457
this?

1252
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:19,920
<i>Yoohoo Jew.</i>

1253
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:22,506
Tell me, who did this?

1254
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:25,217
I did.

1255
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:26,801
It's an exposé on Jews.

1256
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:29,804
How they think, behave, look.

1257
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:31,640
It'll be a gift to the <i>Führer.</i>

1258
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:35,936
Guys, you have to see this.

1259
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:39,564
Oh, look at this one. He has a tail.

1260
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:42,901
There's one of them hanging upside down
like a bat.

1261
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:46,780
This one here, it is
a drawing of their heads.

1262
01:12:47,239 --> 01:12:49,908
And who is operating
the machinery of their brains?

1263
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:51,243
The devil.

1264
01:12:51,743 --> 01:12:53,662
Ah, it's funny 'cause it's true.

1265
01:12:53,745 --> 01:12:56,289
Oh, look at this little, stupid Jew.

1266
01:12:56,373 --> 01:12:58,041
There they are with horns.

1267
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,376
What is this?

1268
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,920
"Die, Nathan, die."

1269
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,798
"Ways of killing Nathan."

1270
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:06,883
Nathan being tortured by snakes.

1271
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:07,842
Poked with sticks.

1272
01:13:07,926 --> 01:13:09,427
Being fired from a cannon

1273
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:11,179
and just being called names.

1274
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,932
Yeah. Nathan being crushed under the wheel

1275
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,101
of an old-time penny-farthing bicycle.

1276
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:17,519
Who is Nathan, please?

1277
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:20,772
Just some boy.

1278
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:23,817
Nathan being roasted
over an open fire.

1279
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,402
Reminds me, we must get back and--

1280
01:13:25,485 --> 01:13:26,778
You remember? 'Cause
we left that guy hanging up.

1281
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:28,405
- Ja. Ja.
- Thank you for this.

1282
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:29,864
You have really made my day.

1283
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:32,742
I do hope you continue with it.

1284
01:13:32,826 --> 01:13:34,202
And, of course,

1285
01:13:34,286 --> 01:13:37,122
if you see anything suspicious,
give us a ring.

1286
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:39,040
Good day.

1287
01:13:40,542 --> 01:13:41,543
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1288
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:42,836
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1289
01:13:51,136 --> 01:13:52,512
Nice to meet you, Inge.

1290
01:13:58,059 --> 01:13:59,352
Stay home, Jojo.

1291
01:14:00,145 --> 01:14:01,438
Look after your family.

1292
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:02,897
Look after this knife.

1293
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:25,503
Elsa, you fooled them.

1294
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:27,756
May seventh.

1295
01:14:29,633 --> 01:14:30,634
What?

1296
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:35,764
She was born on the seventh,
not the first.

1297
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:41,227
He was helping us.

1298
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,605
They'll be back.

1299
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:46,816
They'll figure out she's dead,
then I'll be dead.

1300
01:14:49,486 --> 01:14:51,946
Nobody really knows Inge died.

1301
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,533
You could be her.

1302
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:58,828
I'll tell Mama everything
when she gets home.

1303
01:15:00,288 --> 01:15:03,792
That I know you and that we're friends.

1304
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:08,213
Jew and Nazi are not friends.

1305
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:16,805
Man, that was a complete bust.

1306
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:18,181
You mind explaining that?

1307
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,516
She's not--

1308
01:15:21,226 --> 01:15:23,061
She doesn't seem like a bad person.

1309
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,193
I am beginning
to question your loyalty

1310
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,654
to myself and the party.

1311
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:35,365
You call yourself a patriot?

1312
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,867
Yet, where is the evidence?

1313
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:40,495
The German soldier
was born out of necessity.

1314
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:43,665
Germany depends on the passion
of these young men.

1315
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:46,918
Passion and the readiness
to fall for the Fatherland

1316
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:51,381
despite the futile efforts
of Allied war profiteers

1317
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:56,302
who send their ill-prepared armies
clumsily into the lair of the wolf.

1318
01:15:56,386 --> 01:16:00,140
And only zealous men who stand steadfast
in the face of the enemy

1319
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:03,059
will be etched in German memory forever.

1320
01:16:03,685 --> 01:16:07,647
And it is up to you to decide
if you want to be remembered,

1321
01:16:07,731 --> 01:16:10,275
or disappear without a trace

1322
01:16:10,358 --> 01:16:14,446
like a pitiful grain of sand into a desert
of insignificance.

1323
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:20,994
To put it plainly...

1324
01:16:22,454 --> 01:16:25,206
get your shit together
and sort out your priorities.

1325
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,083
You're ten, Jojo.

1326
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:28,960
Start acting like it.

1327
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:13,314
No.

1328
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:42,839
Did you know?

1329
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:45,383
She didn't tell me much...

1330
01:20:46,426 --> 01:20:48,386
only that she worked with her friends

1331
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:50,763
and your father was
somehow involved from afar.

1332
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:54,684
No. He's fighting in the war.

1333
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:59,439
She said he'll be home
as soon as the war's over.

1334
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:03,484
She didn't want to tell you anything
for obvious reasons.

1335
01:21:04,986 --> 01:21:06,362
Because she hated me.

1336
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:08,656
'Cause I'm a Nazi.

1337
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:10,950
I'm the enemy.

1338
01:21:11,034 --> 01:21:13,745
She didn't want you to know anything
that could get you in trouble.

1339
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:16,039
But now I have nothing.

1340
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:19,500
No one.

1341
01:21:24,047 --> 01:21:26,716
The last time I saw my parents
was at the station.

1342
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:30,011
They were put on a train.

1343
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:34,015
I ran.

1344
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:37,310
Slowly found my way back to the city.

1345
01:21:39,062 --> 01:21:40,897
A friend of my father's hid me.

1346
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:43,316
Then another friend,
then friends of friends.

1347
01:21:45,777 --> 01:21:47,320
Until your mother took me in.

1348
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:51,908
And so far, I'm still here.

1349
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:56,329
But my...

1350
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:59,332
my parents went to a place
you don't come back from.

1351
01:22:04,045 --> 01:22:06,089
What's the first thing
you'll do when you're free?

1352
01:22:09,175 --> 01:22:10,176
Dance.

Yorki?

1380
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:26,729
Jojo!

1381
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:31,776
Oh, God.

1382
01:24:32,318 --> 01:24:33,319
Jojo.

1383
01:24:33,778 --> 01:24:35,404
How I've missed you.

1384
01:24:36,614 --> 01:24:38,699
Sorry about your mama.

1385
01:24:38,783 --> 01:24:41,911
I cried for ages
when I heard what happened.

1386
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:44,580
What's going on out here?

1387
01:24:44,664 --> 01:24:46,958
The Russians, Jojo. They're coming.

1388
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:48,960
And the Americans from the other way.

1389
01:24:49,043 --> 01:24:52,338
And England and China
and Africa and India.

1390
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:54,465
The whole world is coming.

1391
01:24:54,548 --> 01:24:56,050
Help me with this ammo.

1392
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:00,096
- And how are we doing?
- Terribly.

1393
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:02,098
Our only friends are the Japanese.

1394
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:05,601
And just between you and me,
they don't look very Aryan.

1395
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:08,354
- Remember that Jew I told you about?
- Oh, yeah.

1396
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:09,480
I still have her.

1397
01:25:09,563 --> 01:25:11,190
She's basically my girlfriend now.

1398
01:25:11,274 --> 01:25:14,026
Oh, good for you, Jojo. A girlfriend.

1399
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:17,738
But, you know, she's Jewish.

1400
01:25:17,822 --> 01:25:20,866
There are bigger things to worry about
than Jews, Jojo.

1401
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:23,160
There's Russians somewhere out there.

1402
01:25:23,244 --> 01:25:25,079
They're worse than anyone.

1403
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:28,416
I heard they eat babies
and have sex with dogs.

1404
01:25:28,499 --> 01:25:30,501
I mean, like, that's bad, right?

1405
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:31,794
Sex with dogs?

1406
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:34,130
Yeah. The Englishmen do it, too.

1407
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:37,508
We have to stop them before they eat us
and screw all our dogs.

1408
01:25:37,591 --> 01:25:38,884
It's crazy.

1409
01:25:38,968 --> 01:25:41,345
And now Hitler's gone,
we're really on our own.

1410
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:45,933
- What?
- You didn't hear?

1411
01:25:46,851 --> 01:25:48,060
He's dead.

1412
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:50,479
He gave up and blew his brains out.

1413
01:25:50,563 --> 01:25:51,564
No.

1414
01:25:52,315 --> 01:25:53,357
That's impossible.

1415
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:54,692
Blew them out.

1416
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:56,110
His brains.

1417
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:58,821
Turns out he was hiding
a lot of stuff from us.

1418
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:01,741
Doing some really bad things
behind everyone's backs.

1419
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:03,492
I'm not sure we chose the right side.

1420
01:26:19,175 --> 01:26:20,593
Okay. Come here. Okay.
See that American there?

1421
01:26:20,593 --> 01:26:20,676
Okay. Come here. Okay.
See that American there?

1422
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:22,053
Okay. Come here. Okay.
See that American there?

1423
01:26:22,136 --> 01:26:25,306
Just go give him a hug. Go! Run! Let's go!

1424
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:27,391
Oh, Yorki. Yorki, great news.

1425
01:26:27,475 --> 01:26:29,810
You've just been promoted,
and you get your own pistol.

1426
01:26:29,894 --> 01:26:32,396
Just go and shoot anybody
who looks different to us.

1427
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,857
- Okay.
- Okay.

1428
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:36,609
Jojo, where's your uniform?

1429
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:39,987
Here. Here, put the jacket on

1430
01:26:40,071 --> 01:26:41,322
so they know not to shoot you.

1431
01:26:42,907 --> 01:26:45,576
We must kill everything that we see.

1432
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:46,702
For Hitler.

1433
01:26:47,995 --> 01:26:49,622
Die, devil scum!

1434
01:26:50,164 --> 01:26:51,499
Die!

1435
01:27:05,054 --> 01:27:06,180
Fall out!

1436
01:28:24,842 --> 01:28:29,263
Whoo! Ha!

1437
01:28:30,014 --> 01:28:31,474
<i>Ja.</i>

1438
01:28:54,622 --> 01:28:55,706
Come. This way.

1439
01:29:05,591 --> 01:29:06,759
They are here!

1440
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:10,012
The Americans!

1441
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:16,268
Come on.

1442
01:29:16,352 --> 01:29:18,479
- Stay on him.
- Behind you, Cap.

1443
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:22,066
Over here. Come on, go!

1444
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:54,223
I'll check him.

1445
01:30:05,985 --> 01:30:08,654
Hey, boys! Whoo-hoo!

1446
01:30:15,953 --> 01:30:17,621
Move the prisoners.

1447
01:30:17,705 --> 01:30:19,999
Keep the prisoners all in line.

1448
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,093
Quickly. Quickly!

1449
01:30:33,012 --> 01:30:34,847
Hey! Hey!

1450
01:30:37,308 --> 01:30:38,559
What?

1451
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:42,563
I-I don't understand.

1452
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:45,107
Move! Move!

1453
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,235
Get up, wretched dog.

1454
01:30:53,616 --> 01:30:55,034
Captain K.

1455
01:30:55,117 --> 01:30:56,243
Heya, kid.

1456
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:58,579
Look at all this commotion, huh?

1457
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:00,914
- What's happening?
- Hysteria, my friend.

1458
01:31:00,998 --> 01:31:02,499
We've come-- We've come to the end.

1459
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,877
- Party's over.
- No, I'm not like them.

1460
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,755
- Are you scared? Don't be scared.
- No. Please.

1461
01:31:07,838 --> 01:31:10,215
- Look at me.
- No. No.

1462
01:31:12,468 --> 01:31:14,845
I'm sorry about Rosie.
She was a good person.

1463
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,226
An actual good person.

1464
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:24,146
Okay?

1465
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:27,733
Hey. It's okay, kid.

1466
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:30,069
Shh, shh, shh.

1467
01:31:32,029 --> 01:31:35,074
I've been meaning to tell you.
I think your book is really great.

1468
01:31:35,783 --> 01:31:37,743
<i>Ja,</i> I'm sorry for laughing at it.

1469
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:38,827
Very creative.

1470
01:31:39,453 --> 01:31:40,954
Come here, let's take a look at you.

1471
01:31:42,081 --> 01:31:43,332
You look good.

1472
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:44,500
You're okay, kid.

1473
01:31:46,251 --> 01:31:48,504
Now, go home. Look after
that sister of yours.

1474
01:31:48,587 --> 01:31:49,838
Okay?

1475
01:31:51,298 --> 01:31:53,509
Get away. Get away, Jew.

1476
01:31:54,343 --> 01:31:56,553
- Hey! What's going on?
- Get away!

1477
01:31:56,637 --> 01:31:59,139
- He's a Jew.
- Shut up. You know this Nazi?

1478
01:31:59,223 --> 01:32:01,016
- He helped us.
- No, I don't know this dirty Jew.

1479
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:02,142
No, no--

1480
01:32:02,226 --> 01:32:03,227
- Get away, Jew.
- Hey. Hey!

1481
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:06,188
Shut your mouth, Nazi.

1482
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:08,524
- No! No! No!
- Get out of here. Go home.

1483
01:32:09,316 --> 01:32:12,027
- No! Leave him alone!
- Go home!

1484
01:32:12,111 --> 01:32:13,237
No!

1485
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:16,448
- Get off!
- Get out of here.

1486
01:32:16,532 --> 01:32:17,574
Go home!

1487
01:32:32,089 --> 01:32:33,215
Jojo?

1488
01:32:36,427 --> 01:32:37,428
Yorki!

1489
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:41,432
Thank God. I thought you were dead.

1490
01:32:41,515 --> 01:32:43,809
No. It seems like I can never die.

1491
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:46,437
I'm gonna go home and see my mother.

1492
01:32:47,062 --> 01:32:48,272
I need a cuddle.

1493
01:32:48,856 --> 01:32:50,774
- Nothing makes sense anymore.
- Ja, I know.

1494
01:32:50,858 --> 01:32:53,318
It's definitely not
a good time to be a Nazi.

1495
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:56,530
Hey. So now the war's over,

1496
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:58,323
at least your girlfriend will be free.

1497
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:00,409
She can leave now.

1498
01:33:02,161 --> 01:33:03,287
Something wrong?

1499
01:33:04,538 --> 01:33:05,998
I've got to go.

1500
01:33:06,081 --> 01:33:07,332
- Okay.
- Sorry.

1501
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:08,876
Later!

1502
01:34:00,469 --> 01:34:02,137
Hi. I'm home.

1503
01:34:02,221 --> 01:34:03,847
What's going on out there?

1504
01:34:06,892 --> 01:34:10,145
- Out where?
- Outside, dummy.

1505
01:34:11,814 --> 01:34:13,106
Jojo, what's going on?

1506
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,819
Is it safe to come out?

1507
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:21,615
Jojo, is it safe?

1508
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:24,493
Can I leave?

1509
01:34:26,829 --> 01:34:27,830
No.

1510
01:34:32,251 --> 01:34:33,919
You can't leave.

1511
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:36,046
Why?

1512
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:38,257
You have to stay here...

1513
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:39,341
Who won?

1514
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:40,509
...with me.

1515
01:34:41,552 --> 01:34:43,387
Jojo, who won-- who won the war?

1516
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:48,892
We did.

1517
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:54,398
Germany won the war.

1518
01:35:07,953 --> 01:35:09,830
I-I'm sorry.

1519
01:36:29,493 --> 01:36:30,577
"Dear Elsa.

1520
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:33,997
"I know it's hard for you at the moment...

1521
01:36:35,374 --> 01:36:36,875
"and I know you feel like giving up.

1522
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:40,003
"But you have to carry on.

1523
01:36:41,129 --> 01:36:42,714
"Me and your good friend, Jojo,

1524
01:36:42,798 --> 01:36:44,883
"have devised a plan for you to escape.

1525
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:47,886
"So, please listen to him.

1526
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:50,931
"He's gonna help you get out of there.

1527
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:53,558
"And then you can
come live with me in Paris.

1528
01:36:55,686 --> 01:36:57,562
"And don't worry about Jojo.

1529
01:37:01,608 --> 01:37:02,609
"He'll be okay.

1530
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:06,780
"See you in Paris.

1531
01:37:07,489 --> 01:37:08,490
Nathan."

1532
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:19,668
- He's dead.
- Pardon?

1533
01:37:20,419 --> 01:37:21,378
Nathan.

1534
01:37:22,045 --> 01:37:23,588
He died last year.

1535
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:25,882
Tuberculosis.

1536
01:37:28,969 --> 01:37:32,264
Well... that's weird.

1537
01:37:32,347 --> 01:37:33,348
Who wrote these?

1538
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:37,644
Thank you, Jojo.

1539
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,108
You have been so good to me.

1540
01:37:45,527 --> 01:37:49,740
Well, the thing is, I love you.

1541
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:54,619
I know you think of me
as a younger brother, which is fine,

1542
01:37:54,703 --> 01:37:57,998
and, um, you're too old anyway.

1543
01:37:58,081 --> 01:37:59,207
But...

1544
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:02,252
Man, it's quite hot in here.

1545
01:38:04,504 --> 01:38:05,589
I love you, too.

1546
01:38:06,173 --> 01:38:08,341
- As a younger brother.
- As a younger brother.

1547
01:38:08,925 --> 01:38:12,763
Look, me and fake Nathan have found
a way for you to escape.

1548
01:38:15,766 --> 01:38:17,601
Maybe you can trust a younger brother?

1549
01:38:19,436 --> 01:38:20,437
Maybe.

1550
01:38:22,481 --> 01:38:24,024
Okay, then.

1551
01:38:24,107 --> 01:38:25,984
Get your things together.

1552
01:38:26,068 --> 01:38:27,277
We're leaving.

1553
01:38:34,201 --> 01:38:35,368
Jojo Betzler.

1554
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:38,163
Ten and a half years old.

1555
01:38:39,581 --> 01:38:40,582
Today,

1556
01:38:42,084 --> 01:38:43,126
just do what you can.

1557
01:38:45,587 --> 01:38:48,173
Where in the shit do you think
you're going, hmm?

1558
01:38:48,715 --> 01:38:51,301
- Out.
- Out? Oh, no, you don't.

1559
01:38:51,384 --> 01:38:53,845
No, we're gonna stay in here
and you're gonna tell me

1560
01:38:53,929 --> 01:38:55,472
exactly what's going on

1561
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:57,140
with you and that thing in the attic.

1562
01:38:57,224 --> 01:38:58,892
That "thing" is a girl.

1563
01:38:58,975 --> 01:39:00,977
- You're in love with her, aren't you?
- Yes.

1564
01:39:01,061 --> 01:39:02,979
- Admit it.
- I just said yes.

1565
01:39:03,063 --> 01:39:04,064
I knew it!

1566
01:39:05,607 --> 01:39:06,942
Well, it's never gonna work out.

1567
01:39:08,276 --> 01:39:10,821
No. No, she's too old for you.
And you're ugly.

1568
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:13,990
You know she's gonna leave you.
You know that, don't you?

1569
01:39:14,074 --> 01:39:17,244
So, here's what's
gonna happen, you little shit.

1570
01:39:17,327 --> 01:39:19,371
You're gonna put this on, okay?

1571
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:22,791
You're gonna forget about
that disgusting Jewy cow up there.

1572
01:39:22,874 --> 01:39:26,002
And you're gonna come back
to me, where you belong.

1573
01:39:26,086 --> 01:39:27,170

1579
01:39:43,603 --> 01:39:45,730
