1
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,527
<i>It scares us just thinking about it.</i>

2
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,779
<i>When you hear it, you're gonna
think we're insane.</i>

3
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,615
<i>Try us. Please, from the start.</i>

4
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:38,872
It started out small,
like a hand or a leg was in a different position.

5
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,542
Then its head was looking up
instead of down.

6
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,753
And then one day, it was in
a completely different room.

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,463
It was moving around by itself.

8
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,801
Ever think maybe somebody had a key
to your apartment and was playing a trick?

9
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,636
That's exactly what we thought.

10
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,806
But never once did we find any
sign or evidence of intrusion.

11
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,725
And this all led you to believe
that the doll was possessed?

12
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,269
Yes.

13
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,147
Camilla got in touch with a medium.
We learned from her that a 7-year-old girl...

14
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,234
...named Annabelle Higgins
had died in this apartment.

15
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:11,113
She was lonely and took a liking
to my doll.

16
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,657
All she wanted was to be friends.

17
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,159
When we heard this,
we felt really sorry for her.

18
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,996
I mean, we're nurses, we help people.

19
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,497
So...

20
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,126
...we gave her permission
to move into the doll.

21
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,295
Wait, you did what?

22
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,089
She wanted to live with us
by inhabiting the doll.

23
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,424
We said yes.

24
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,010
But then things got worse.

25
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,358
God.

26
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,364
<i>When we came home,
she was sitting in the hallway.</i>

27
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,950
<i>But we had left her in the spare room.</i>

28
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,948
Debbie! Debbie, wait!

29
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,775
We are beyond terrified.

30
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,904
We don't know what's going on
or what to do. Can you help us?

31
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,532
Yes, we can.

32
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,995
Now, firstly, there's no such thing
as Annabelle, and there never was.

33
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,247
Ghosts don't possess such power.

34
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,041
I think what we have here is something
extremely manipulative.

35
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,169
It's something inhuman.

36
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,838
It was a big mistake acknowledging this doll.

37
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,174
And through that,
the inhuman spirit tricked you.

38
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,093
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.

39
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,471
What's an inhuman spirit?

40
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,516
It's something that's never walked
the earth in human form.

41
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,810
It's something demonic.

42
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,775
So the doll was never possessed?

43
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,860
No, no, it was used as a conduit.

44
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,362
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

45
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,200
Demonic spirits don't possess things,
they possess people.

46
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,453
It wanted to get inside of you.

47
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,216
All right, that's good, Drew.
You can shut it down now.

48
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,052
Hit the lights.

49
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,140
So we got the church to send a priest over...

50
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,392
...to bless the house and the occupants.

51
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,230
Whatever was oppressing that apartment
was no longer with them. Any questions?

52
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,399
Yes.

53
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,193
Where's the doll now?

54
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,111
Someplace safe.

55
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,573
- Yep.
- So, what are you guys?

56
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,575
I mean, what do people call you?

57
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:31,498
Uh, well, we've been called Demonologists.
That's one name for us.

58
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,375
Ghost hunters, paranormal researchers.

59
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,836
- Kooks.
- Ha-ha-ha.

60
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,420
Wackos.

61
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,758
But we prefer to be known simply
as Ed and Lorraine Warren.

62

63
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,820
Here we are.

64
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,451
Wow, hear that?

65
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,244
- I don't hear anything.
- Exactly.

66
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,621
Oh. Ha!

67
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,082
- Okay. Guys, we are here!
- Get out of the car.

68
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,126
Oh, God, we're in the middle of nowhere.

69
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,338
Are you so excited?
Where's my "yes"? Where's my "yes"? Yes!

70
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,589
I'll race you!

71
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,008
- Are you guys excited?
- Yes!

72
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,177
- I'm so excited!
- Come on, Sadie!

73
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,845
I get my own room!

74
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,681
Are you kidding me?
No dibs on the rooms!

75
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,974
- What?
- What?

76
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,853
So do I get to pick my own room?
Or do I have no choice in that either?

77
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,692
Well, first cute boy she meets,
she'll forget about Jersey.

78
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,110
- Great.
- I hope.

79
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,487
I can't wait.

80
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,364
Come on, Sadie.

81
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,866
Sadie, let's go.

82
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,494
Hey, come.

83
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,205
What's the matter with you?

84
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,123
Hey, come on, girl.

85
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,876
All right, suit yourself.

86
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,094
<i>-What's your name?
- What's your name?</i>

87
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,137
<i>-Who's your daddy?
- Who's your daddy?</i>

88
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,973
<i>-He rich?
- Is he rich like me?</i>

89
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,224
Watch your step.

90
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,850
Coming through.

91
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:57,727
Whoa, watch out, Dad.

92
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,729
- Where do you want it?
- In the living room.

93
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,816
- Andrea, where's my wind chime?
- I think Nancy's got it in the other room.

94
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,235
Thanks. Hey, Nancy,
have you seen my wind chime?

95
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,028
- Oh, this one?
- Yeah, thanks.

96
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,031
- You're gonna have to catch it.
- Nancy! Let go! Give it here.

97
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,075
You're so mean.

98
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,828
Hey, Mom, can I hang up
my wind chime?

99
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,414
Of course. There's a line outside
you can hang it on.

100
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,250
Honey, have April come in, okay?
It's gonna be dark soon.

101
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,668
Okay.

102
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,888
Come on, April! Mom wants us inside!

103
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,725
Look what I found, Cindy.

104
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,704
<i>One...</i>

105
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,289
...two...

106
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,540
...three.

107
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,584
Come on, come on, come on.
No peeking.

108
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,127
Four.

109
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,422
Are you guys done with the pizza?
I don't want it going to waste.

110
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,050
- Let's go.
- It's expensive feeding you girls.

111
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,595
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

112
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,929
Where should I hide?

113
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,265
Ready or not, here I come!

114
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,060
Okay, clap.

115
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,612
- Whoa!
- You don't know the house well enough.

116
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:31,821
Someone's gonna get hurt.

117
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,281
I'm okay, I'm okay.

118
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,576
Second clap.

119
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,084
That's cheating.

120
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,972
Clap.

121
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,893
- Got you!
- Aah!

122
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,521
- Are you okay? Um--
- Yeah.

123
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,564
All right, what did we break now?

124
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,733
- I didn't mean to.
- Move out of there, please.

125
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,652
It was Christine's fault.

126
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,029
- Oh, jeez.
- My fault? Oh, my God.

127
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,115
- Christine did it.
- No, I didn't.

128
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,450
- You pushed me.
- No, no, you fell back.

129
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,286
Hey, Nancy, can you go get me
the matches, please?

130
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,330
What's going on?

131
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,499
- Nancy broke something.
- Shut up.

132
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,501
- What broke?
- It's the wall.

133
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,712
- Whoa.
- I think we have a cellar or something.

134
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,299
I wanna see, I wanna see. Move, move, move.

135
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,553
Here, matches. Thank you.

136
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,763
- I wanna see.
- You can see.

137
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,682
- I wanna see.
- You can all see.

138
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,058
Move!

139
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,070
Oh, man.

140
00:10:58,825 --> 00:10:59,868
Huh.

141
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,912
Roger?

142
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,373
What do you see down there?

143
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:09,043
Just, uh, hard to tell, you know?

144
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,173
It's an old piano
and a whole bunch of garbage.

145
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,719
Agh. Son of a--

146
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,974
Wow.

147
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,229
Rog?

148
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,984
Come on up.

149
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,947
I don't want you girls going down there.

150
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,824
- That place is loaded with spiders.
- Ew!

151
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,075
Just relax. Okay.

152
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,578
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny.

153
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,457
We've got extra square footage anyway.
I'll check it out in the morning.

154
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,792
- I wonder why it was boarded up.
- I don't know.

155
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,002
Okay, show's over.

156
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,879
- Five minutes.
- No more minutes.

157
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,381
- Up to bed. Please. Thank you.
- Right to bed.

158
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:00,929
Man, I'm fried.

159
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,473
Something's up with Sadie.

160
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,602
Yeah, I don't know what her problem is.
Couldn't get her to come inside.

161
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,562
We can't leave her out there.

162
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,898
She's all right. I got her on a chain.

163
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,944
Sadie, hey, be quiet.

164
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,949
Thanks for making this work.

165
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,992
I know it was a lot to bite off.

166
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,329
It's gonna be great, isn't it?

167
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,748
I think it's great already.

168
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,125
Yeah.

169
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,005
You still too fried to christen
the new house?

170
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,424
Who said I'm fried?

171
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,011
- Ain't nobody here's fried.
- Ha, ha.

172
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,589
Mom?

173
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,217
Hey. How did you guys sleep?

174
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,552
I'm cold.

175
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,220
It is chilly, isn't it?

176
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:28,224
You think maybe we could have bought
a house with a toilet that actually works?

177
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,434
Tell your father.

178
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,729
And there was a funky smell in my
room last night. Like something died.

179
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,480
- Is it still there?
- No.

180
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,690
Problem solved.

181
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,550
Roger?

182
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,511
Roger?

183
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,430
Down here, honey.

184
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,644
Morning.

185
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,899
Ooh. Whoa.

186
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,735
This is gonna take some
serious elbow grease.

187
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,070
Yeah.

188
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,864
Oh, my God.

189
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,623
What are we gonna do
with all this stuff?

190
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,250
Well, we probably ought
to go through it, you know?

191
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,795
There might be some antiques down here
worth a lot.

192
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,631
Yeah, or just a lot of junk
the previous owner didn't want.

193
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,133
- It's ours now.
- Knock yourself out.

194
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,761
- I'm gonna make some coffee.
- Okay.

195
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,971
I'm gonna see if I can get
this furnace working.

196
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,932
Yeah, that'd be nice. It's freezing.

197
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,225
Yeah.

198
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,860
Hmm.

199
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,032
Sadie! Come here, Sadie!

200
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,659
Mommy!

201
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,286
Mommy, where's Sadie?

202
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:16,749
She's outside. You know, I'm sure she's
hungry by now. Why don't you go and get her.

203
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,793
- Whoa.
- Morning, Dad.

204
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,962
- Can you hold this?
- Sure.

205
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,797
- Sadie!
- Slow it down, Scoot.

206
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,257
- Roger.
- Yeah.

207
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,552
This clock stopped at 3:07,
and so did the one in the hallway.

208
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,137
That's weird.

209
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,807
Maybe it got knocked around in the move.

210
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,852
Speaking of knocked around,
what did you do to me last night?

211
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,771
- Ouch. I didn't do that. Did I?
- I don't know.

212
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,357
Sadie!

213
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,369
April! April!

214
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,122
What's--? April! What's going on?

215
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,583
- What happened?
- Oh, my God!

216
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,418
Oh, Sadie.

217
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,555
We keep everything locked in here.

218
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,765
Feel free to look around.

219
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,809
Just don't touch anything.

220
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,771
Wow.

221
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,524
This is crazy.

222
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,446
So all these are taken from cases
you've investigated?

223
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:32,575
That's right. Everything you see
in here is either haunted, cursed...

224
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,661
...or has been used in some kind
of ritualistic practice.

225
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,997
Nothing's a toy.

226
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,832
Not even the toy monkey.

227
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,710
Don't touch it.

228
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:49,383
Oh, ahem. Well, isn't it scary,
or doesn't it worry you...

229
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,844
...to have all these items
right in your home?

230
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,389
That's why we have a priest that comes by
once a month to bless the room.

231
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,766
Well, the way I see it is:

232
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,560
It's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.

233
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,521
It's kind of like keeping guns
off the street.

234
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,774
Why not just throw them
in an incinerator? Destroy them.

235
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,859
Well, that would only destroy the vessel.

236
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,154
Sometimes it's better to keep
the genie in the bottle.

237
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,200
Say, is the, uh, Annabelle doll here?

238
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,495
Right this way.

239
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,082
Yeah.

240
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,301
- You said she's a conduit?
- That's right.

241
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,678
What does that mean?

242
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,682
A very powerful demonic
has latched itself onto her.

243
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,810
So when you guys investigate
these hauntings...

244
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,187
...how do you stop them
from latching onto you?

245
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,939
We have to take great precaution.

246
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,732
But what about your wife?

247
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,943
What about her?

248
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,862
Well, Father Gordon told me that--

249
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,531
Well, that was different.

250
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,867
What happened to my wife
happened during an exorcism.

251
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,703
Well, what's the difference?

252
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,747
Excuse me.

253
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,792
Honey, what are you doing?

254
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,419
Come here.

255
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,921
You know better. All right?

256
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,506
Georgiana?

257
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,092
- Come on. Did you touch anything?
- No.

258
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,552
All right, come on, honey.

259
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,972
- Georgiana! Could you take Judy upstairs?
- Oh, sure.

260
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,600
You can't go into this room,
no matter what, remember?

261
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,184
- Yes, Daddy.
- All right.

262
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,270
- Go on.
- Okay, come on.

263
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,481
Let's see if I can find you
a little snack, okay? Come on.

264
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,783
Hey. What's going on in here?

265
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,453
- Daddy, look.
- You look very pretty.

266
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,955
All right, all done.
Go get dressed for dinner.

267
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,958
- I'm wearing it to dinner.
- No, you're not!

268
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,377
Here you go.

269
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,421
How'd it go?

270
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,715
Oh, I think he may write a positive article.

271
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,800
Ooh, a non-skeptic.

272
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,677
That's a pleasant change.

273
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,012
Yeah.

274
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,646
Stop blaming yourself.

275
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,033
No sugar.

276
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,661
Be right back.

277
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,427
Not funny, Nancy.

278
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,846
What?

279
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,598
Stop grabbing my foot.

280
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,934
Shut up, I didn't do anything.

281
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,186
Yeah, right.

282
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,898
And stop farting.

283
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,109
It really stinks.

284
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:39,029
Don't blame that on me. It's you. Pew.

285
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,417
Dad?

286
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,586
Andrea, what are you doing out of bed?

287
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,045
What's that sound?

288
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:04,133
It's Cindy. She's in my room.
She's sleepwalking again.

289
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,692
I've never seen her do this before.

290
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,240
I remembered you saying not
to wake her if she's like this.

291
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,326
No, we just put her back to bed.

292
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,995
Hey, hey. Sweetie. Shh.

293
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,164
Let's go back to bed.

294
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,968
She's okay. Good night.

295
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,303
Night.

296
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,444
<i>She's sleepwalking again?
She hasn't done that for awhile.</i>

297
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,198
She ended up in Andrea's room too.
I think kind of freaked her out.

298
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,951
- That's not good. What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

299
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,662
- Honey, you got another bruise here.
- Hmm?

300
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,288
Does that hurt?

301
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,375
That's weird.

302
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,461
I don't know. Will you do me a favor,
go see a doctor for that?

303
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,589
- Yeah, I will. Drive safe.
- Yeah.

304
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,466
- I love you.
- I love you too.

305
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,081
Bye!

306
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,708
Love you!

307
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,753
- Cindy, you have your lunch?
- Yeah.

308
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,382
Yes, I do.

309
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,384
I miss Sadie a lot.

310
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,928
She was my best friend.

311
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,015
You're my friend, right?

312
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,226
Yeah, let's play.

313
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,110
- Who are you talking to?
- Rory.

314
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,695
Rory?

315
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,072
- He's my new friend.
- Oh, really?

316
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,325
- Yeah, do you want to see him?
- Yeah. Uh-huh. How?

317
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,910
With this.

318
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,748
When the music stops, you see him
in the mirror standing behind you.

319
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,791
Okay.

320
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,877
But you have to twist the key.

321
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,253
Okay.

322
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,403
- Boo, Mommy! Ha-ha!
- Oh!

323
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,865
- April, you just gave me a heart attack.
- Got you!

324
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,911
Well, okay, I guess Rory
doesn't want to see me, huh?

325
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,329
Hmm. Oh, well.

326
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,164
Can we play hide-and-clap?

327
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,583
Hide-and-cla--?
Oh, honey, I don't want to play.

328
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,378
- Please! Nobody ever lets me play.
- Okay, okay.

329
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:33,300
Remember, you get to ask me
for three claps.

330
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,510
Okay.

331
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,888
One, two, three.

332
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,681
- I'm gonna go hide now!
- Okay.

333
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,518
Four, five...

334
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,562
...six, seven...

335
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,065
...eight, nine...

336
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,942
...ten!

337
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,154
First clap!

338
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,467
Ow. Shit.

339
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,177
Second clap!

340
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,028
April.

341
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,452
April.

342
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,674
Oh, I know where you're hiding.

343
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:57,968
Give me the third clap.

344
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,978
I'm gonna get you now.

345
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,029
I can hear you breathing.

346
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,031
April.

347
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,450
April.

348
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,459
Ha, ha. You took your blindfold off. I win!

349
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:34,463
You weren't even warm, Mom.
I was in Christine and Nancy's room.

350
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,804
<i>I gotta have some routes here,
or I'm gonna lose the insurance on the rig.</i>

351
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,476
That's like half of my rate, man.

352
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,146
Yeah, okay.

353
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,233
I'll, uh-- Yeah, I'll take it.

354
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,692
Thank you.

355
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,365
- What's the route?
- It's, uh, Florida.

356
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,243
It's a week turnaround. I start tomorrow.

357
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,578
We'll get through this.

358
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,581
Yeah.

359
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,083
Come on, let's go to bed.

360
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,986
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny anymore.

361
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,239
I'm trying to sleep,
please stop grabbing my feet.

362
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,053
Nancy?

363
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,598
Nancy?

364
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,727
What are you doing?

365
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,649
Christine?

366
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,443
Are you all right?

367
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,780
Do you see it?

368
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,742
See what?

369
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,333
There's someone behind the door.

370
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,709
What?

371
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,923
There's someone standing over there.

372
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,386
I don't see anyone.

373
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,141
It's looking right at us.

374
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,901
Nancy, don't! Nancy.

375
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,529
No, no. Look. Look.

376
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:31,158
Look, there's no one here. See?

377
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,786
Ugh. It's that smell again.

378
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,289
Oh, my God.

379
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,917
It's standing right behind you.

380
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,936
Christine?! Christine! Christine!

381
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,439
God, it won't op--

382
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,734
- Christine!
- No! No! No!

383
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,904
- What's going on? What happened?
- There was someone else in here!

384
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,113
- What?
- Where?

385
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,575
By the door. It was behind the door.

386
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,286
Honey, there's nothing in here.
There's nobody in here.

387
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,246
There was someone else in here!

388
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:22,834
I was just sleeping, and then
I felt somebody grab my feet.

389
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,337
So I thought it was Nancy.

390
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,798
Well, honey, I'm pretty sure
that it was just a bad dream.

391
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,551
No! It talked to me!

392
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,637
It said...

393
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,891
...that it wants my family dead.

394
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,400
<i>Mr. Winston!</i>

395
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,569
Winston? Winston?

396
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,321
Get behind him.

397
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,156
Where you off to?

398
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,784
I just gotta run to the store
for a few things.

399
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,955
- Why do you even try?
- What? What do you mean?

400
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,666
In 15 years have you
ever been able to lie to me?

401
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,795
Father Gordon called. He's got
a case he wants us to look into.

402
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,506
I said I'd go check it out myself.
Lorraine, myself.

403
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,049
I'm going with you.

404
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,261
I know you're worried
it's gonna happen again.

405
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,221
Yeah, I am. I really am.

406
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:23,937
Maybe it's just time we take a break.
Write that book.

407
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,941
Do you remember what you said to me
on our wedding night?

408
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,943
"Can we do it again?"

409
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:33,989
After that.

410
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,245
You said that God brought us together
for a reason. Right?

411
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,373
I'm pretty sure it's not to write a book.

412
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,711
I'm gonna get dressed.

413
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,341
<i>We've isolated the disturbances to the attic.</i>

414
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,843
<i>I want you to listen for a second.</i>

415
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,262
Oh, my God, that's it.

416
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,348
Do it again, Ed.

417
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,562
Right now it's just my weight.
But you take the water coming <i>off</i> the pipe...

418
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,273
...combined with the wind coming
through the broken window...

419
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,775
...these boards are gonna expand
and rub against each other.

420
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,738
You heard it all through the house
because of these pipes leading to the radiator.

421
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,823
So this place isn't haunted?

422
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,617
No, it rarely is.

423
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:22,579
Yeah, there's usually always
some kind of rational explanation.

424
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,457
Girls, it's way past your bedtime.

425
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,034
Who is that?

426
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,015
Who's ever down there,
I'm gonna lock you in now!

427
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:12,725
Aah! Unh.

428
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,818
Aah!

429
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,446
Help!

430
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,406
Andrea! Help!

431
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,516
<i>Hey, wanna play hide-and-clap?</i>

432
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,355
Aah!

433
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,386
Cindy?

434
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,027
Okay, now...

435
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,530
All right?

436
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,281
All right, come on.

437
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:33,866
Come on.

438
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,119
There you go.

439
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:40,081
Okay, you can just sleep with me tonight,
all right?

440
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,337
There you go.

441
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:48,881
There.

442
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,947
- Andrea?
- Help! Help! Help!

443
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,743
- Who's in here?
- Andrea!

444
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,120
Andrea? Andrea!

445
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,413
In here!

446
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,041
Help, Daddy! Help, it's Andrea!

447
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,626
- Who's in here?
- Andrea!

448
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,586
What happened?

449
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,216
Somebody, goddamn it,
tell me what's going on here?

450
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:22,266
<i>Fear is defined as a feeling of agitation
and anxiety caused by the presence...</i>

451
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,976
<i>...or imminence of danger.</i>

452
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:28,648
<i>Whether it's a ghost, a spirit
or an entity, they all feed on it.</i>

453
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:29,857
Take Maurice here.

454
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:33,194
A French-Canadian farmer with
no more than a third-grade education...

455
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:36,864
...yet after he was possessed,
spoke some of the best Latin I'd ever heard.

456
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,282
Sometimes backwards.

457
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,161
He'd been molested by his father,
who had also tortured him repeatedly.

458
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,790
A dark spirit made its home in this man.

459
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:50,419
Now, if you look into his eyes,
you can see him tearing blood.

460
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,387
And like that...

461
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:03,724
...an upside-down cross started
to appear from within his body.

462
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,688
All right, Drew, you can hit the lights.

463
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,189
Oh.

464
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,733
Did you personally perform the exorcism?

465
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,736
No, I'm not authorized.
But I've assisted on many.

466
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,822
See, an exorcism
can be very dangerous...

467
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:21,033
...not only for the victim,
but for anyone in the room.

468
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,120
- What happened to Maurice?
- He tried to kill his wife...

469
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:27,623
...but instead shot her in the arm
and then turned the gun on himself.

470
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,252
Maurice had a very troubled life
with little to live for...

471
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,297
...and not even an exorcist
could bring him back.

472
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,884
Which brings us to the three stages
of demonic activity:

473
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,261
Infestation, oppression and possession.

474
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,804
Now, infestation:

475
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:45,933
That's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence...

476
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,770
...which ultimately grows
into oppression, the second stage.

477
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,190
Now this is where the victim,
and it's usually the one...

478
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,233
...who's the most
psychologically vulnerable...

479
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,278
...is targeted specifically
by an external force.

480
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:00,865
Breaks the victim down.
Crushes their will.

481
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:06,287
And, once in a weakened state, leads them
to the third and final stage: possession.

482
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,000
- Hey, Ed? Lorraine?
- Yeah.

483
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,586
There's someone here
that would like to talk to you.

484
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:14,795
- Hi.
- Thanks, Drew.

485
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,422
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later.

486
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:17,673
How can we help you?

487
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,178
There's something horrible happening in
my house. Could you come and take a look?

488
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,263
You know, uh, it's getting kinda late.

489
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,183
- We really need to head to our family.
- You don't understand.

490
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,228
But we do. There's usually some
sort of rational explanation--

491
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:35,149
I have five daughters who are scared to death.
I'm so afraid this thing wants to hurt us.

492
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:39,153
You have a daughter. Wouldn't you do
anything you could to protect her? Please.

493
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,530
Please can you come and take a look?

494
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:44,242
Of course we will.

495
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,619
Of course we will.

496
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,675
<i>Come on, Jan! Open up!</i>

497
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,552
<i>Jan, what happened?</i>

498
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,514
<i>The top of your head turned black.</i>

499
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,432
You guys straighten up? Thanks.

500
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,393
<i>Don't be silly, it's a wig.</i>

501
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:15,690
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

502
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,233
Thanks for coming.

503
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,735
- Hi, I'm Roger.
- Lorraine.

504
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,196
Hey, nice to meet you, Roger. Ed Warren.

505
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,657
- Thanks for coming.
- Please, come in.

506
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:26,033
Thank you.

507
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,661
So...

508
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,831
Oh, my God. Look at you all.
Who are these beautiful young women?

509
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:35,376
This is Andrea, the oldest,
Nancy, Cindy, Christine...

510
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,128
...and April.

511
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,298
It's Mr. and Mrs. Warren.

512
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,551
- We're all sleeping down here now.
- Mm.

513
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,762
The girls feel safer and it's warmer.

514
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:50,641
I'm constantly turning up the heat,
but the house is always freezing.

515
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,727
It's not a problem with the furnace.

516
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,145
I mean, not that I can find.

517
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,154
It's gotten a lot worse the past few nights.

518
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:09,035
There's this awful smell, like rotting meat.
It moves around the house.

519
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,080
Uh...

520
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,457
What? What is it?

521
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:20,504
Well, rancid smells could indicate
some type of demonic activity.

522
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:21,839
Oh, my God.

523
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,554
That's to keep those doors
from banging at night.

524
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:32,141
Otherwise, it's like:
All night long, just like that.

525
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,644
- Does it come in threes?
- Yeah.

526
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:36,979
It stops at dawn?

527
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,773
Uh-huh.

528
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:44,028
Well, sometimes it's meant
as an insult to the Trinity:

529
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,155
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

530
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,494
You know, it's the damndest thing,
but we also get all kinds of birds...

531
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,622
...that will just fly against the side
of the house and break their necks.

532
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,457
Hm. Really?

533
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:59,043
And the clocks stop at 3:07 a.m.

534
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,295
- All of them?
- Every one.

535
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,426
Oh, we were hanging those
along the stairs.

536
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:11,889
Something just kept knocking them down,
so we stopped hanging them up.

537
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,603
That's what I was talking about.

538
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:19,688
It was here when we moved in.

539
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,024
There's also a lot of stuff in the cellar.

540
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,445
Show me the cellar.

541
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,168
<i>Look what she made me do.</i>

542
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,796
You picking up anything in here, hon?

543
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:50,261
Something awful happened here, Ed.

544
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:57,309
Those bruises, they from something
that happened here?

545
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:01,522
Oh, it's some iron deficiency thing I have.

546
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:07,069
You know, with all that's been going on,
why haven't you just moved out?

547
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,363
I don't know where
we'd move to, you know?

548
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:13,826
We got all our money tied up in this place
and had a lot of repairs on top of that.

549
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:18,497
And I don't know anybody whose gonna
take in a family of seven indefinitely.

550
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,541
That's why we tracked you down.

551
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,793
We're glad you found us.

552
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,588
All right, let's get started.

553
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:31,177
My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.

554
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,345
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

555
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:37,725
...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.

556
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,102
Okay, go ahead.

557
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,022
Where do I start?

558
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:45,274
From the first occurrence.

559
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,360
I guess it was the clocks.

560
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,488
Mom and Dad tell me
that you have a friend.

561
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,865
His name's Rory.
He lives here too.

562
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,867
- Hmm.
- But he's always sad.

563
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,076
Why is that?

564
00:49:56,243 --> 00:50:00,039
He won't tell me but I think
something bad happened to him.

565
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,002
Do you mind if I try to see Rory?

566
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,177
Hey.

567
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,189
What is it?

568
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:14,465
We bought it at auction from the bank, so,
you know, we never knew who lived here.

569
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:24,350
Well, Lorraine and I both feel that
what your house needs is a cleansing.

570
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:26,852
An exorcism.

571
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:29,897
What, exorcism?

572
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,818
I thought that was something
that you do to people.

573
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,362
No, not necessarily, no.

574
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,322
We have to get out of here.

575
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,491
I'm afraid that's not gonna help.

576
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,787
Lorraine saw something, which--

577
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,246
Go ahead, hon.

578
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:52,044
I've been seeing the dark entity
that haunts your house...

579
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:53,712
<i>...and your land.</i>

580
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,762
I saw it first when I came
through your door.

581
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,139
<i>It was latched to your back.</i>

582
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:10,688
<i>And then I saw it again with the girls
when we walked into the living room.</i>

583
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,899
And it doesn't matter where you go...

584
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:17,194
...this dark entity has latched itself
to your family...

585
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,862
...and it's feeding off you.

586
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:24,076
Even if we leave?

587
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:26,912
Sometimes when you get haunted,
it's like stepping on gum.

588
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,373
You take it with you.

589
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,502
Look, I gotta tell you,
you have a lot of spirits in here...

590
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:38,298
...but this is the one that I'm most
worried about, because it is so hateful.

591
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,010
Okay, so what do we do?
Can we call a priest?

592
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,470
I wish it were that easy.

593
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:47,641
Performing an exorcism is an archaic
procedure. Requires years of training.

594
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:52,563
And even then,
I have seen it go horribly wrong.

595
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:57,234
But before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.

596
00:53:57,401 --> 00:54:00,654
It means we gotta investigate,
gather evidence and provide proof...

597
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,322
...and that's the hard part.

598
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,201
Have your children been baptized?

599
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:10,664
Uh, no, we never got around to that.
We're not really a churchgoing family.

600
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:14,501
Well, you may want to rethink that.
Our presence here could make things worse.

601
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,794
Why?

602
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,337
Because we're a threat.

603
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:20,382
And whatever you're dealing with here
isn't gonna like us.

604
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:24,136
So far it hasn't done anything violent,
and that's a good sign.

605
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:27,181
So we're gonna have our guy
do some homework on the property...

606
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,141
...to see what we're up against.

607
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,187
<i>Judy, what are you up to?</i>

608
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,106
- I got you a present.
- Aah.

609
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,359
Me and Nanna got these
at the church's yard sale.

610
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,361
- Honey.
- One for you and one for me.

611
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,071
- Aw.
- She put a picture...

612
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,531
...of you and Daddy in mine.

613
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:48,202
Nanna said this way
we'll always be together.

614
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,871
You'll be with me and I'll be with you.

615
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,667
I miss you and Daddy.

616
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,429
Hey, hon.

617
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,724
Yup.

618
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:13,727
You're not gonna believe this.
Carolyn's voice didn't record.

619
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,104
What do you mean?

620
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,273
Listen.

621
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:22,236
<i>My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.</i>

622
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,238
<i>I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...</i>

623
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,825
<i>...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.</i>

624
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,576
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

625
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,581
<i>From the first occurrence.</i>

626
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,461
Nothing.

627
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:41,255
The whole time.

628
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,966
- I don't know. You find anything?
- Lots.

629
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,553
I mean, it's no wonder they're
going through what they are.

630
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,763
That's the original farmhouse.

631
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,016
It was built in 1863 by a man
named Jedson Sherman...

632
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,769
...who was married to a woman
named Bathsheba.

633
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:59,189
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Est ye.

634
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,525
She was one of the women
accused of witchcraft in Salem.

635
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,610
- She was hung during the trials.
- Wow.

636
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:06,655
After Bathsheba married Jedson,
they had a baby...

637
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,657
...and when the baby was 7 days old...

638
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:11,702
...Jedson caught her sacrificing it
in front of the fireplace.

639
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,954
She ran out to that tree by the dock...

640
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:16,290
...climbed up, proclaimed her love
to Satan...

641
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:20,335
...cursed anyone who tried
to take her land, and hung herself.

642
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,757
Time of death was pronounced at 3:07
in the morning.

643
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:27,885
Well, that explains a few things.

644
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,761
Yeah, so does this.

645
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,098
Her last name's Walker.
She lived there in the '30s.

646
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:36,310
She had a boy named Rory who
mysteriously disappeared in the woods.

647
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,270
Then she killed herself in the cellar.

648
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:40,355
And that's not all.

649
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:47,738
So, what was the original 200-acre farm
has since been subdivided and sold off.

650
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:51,867
There was another boy who drowned in
a pond here. He lived in a house over here.

651
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:56,163
And a woman who worked as a maid in a
neighboring home, she committed suicide too.

652
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,917
People who took her land.

653
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,795
<i>I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...</i>

654
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:07,174
<i>...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.</i>

655
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,093
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

656
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,349
<i>From the first occurrence.</i>

657
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,052
Here's Brad.

658
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,432
- You find it okay?
- Oh, yeah.

659
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,976
Drew, this is Officer Brad.

660
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,687
Officer Brad Hamilton,
Harrisville, Rhode Island P.D.

661
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,730
Hm. Nice to meet you, man.

662
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:07,734
- So you're the lucky new cop, huh?
- Guess so.

663
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,029
- You know you can't shoot ghosts, right?
- Take it easy on him, Drew.

664
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,448
All right, guys,
help me get this stuff unloaded.

665
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,076
You take this.

666
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:18,412
Hi, Roger.

667
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:27,921
All right. When you're finished here,
why don't you hit upstairs, all right, Drew?

668
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,297
You got it.

669
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,697
What's wrong with the Chevy?

670
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,283
Ugh, what's not wrong with her?

671
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,618
- Needs a new carburetor to start.
- Oh, yeah?

672
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,872
Kind of put fixing her up
on hold for a while.

673
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,498
Yeah. Ahem.

674
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,502
Hey, Brad, hand me a thermostat,
would you?

675
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:12,174
What's this, uh, do?

676
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,468
When there's an instant drop
in temperature...

677
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,095
...the thermostat
triggers the camera to take a picture.

678
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,556
You've actually caught things on film?

679
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,517
Well, yeah, that's, uh, the point.

680
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:26,229
Why, uh--? Why out here?

681
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:29,149
Well, this is where the witch
committed suicide.

682
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:33,945
She hung herself from that branch
right above where you're standing.

683
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,329
<i>How could a mother kill her own child?</i>

684
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,915
It was never a child to her.

685
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:48,710
She just used her God-given gift
as the ultimate offense against him.

686
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:51,963
Witches believe it elevates their status
in the eyes of Satan.

687
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:01,890
Mm.

688
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:05,519
Wow.
That's a nice day at the beach, huh?

689
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,479
How did you know?

690
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:12,192
It's an insight. It's like a peek through
the curtain into another person's life.

691
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,029
Mm.

692
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:20,450
That day meant so much to me.
We were driving along the coast.

693
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,203
Nancy pointed out
how pretty the view was.

694
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:26,706
I thought this is a perfect opportunity
for a photo.

695
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:30,043
<i>We're gonna start fresh, you know?
A new house, a new beginning.</i>

696
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:33,547
<i>You should have seen Roger and the girls.
I've never seen them so happy.</i>

697
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:34,881
Cheese!

698
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,635
They mean the world to me.

699
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,064
Put your hand flat on the desk.

700
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,442
Yeah, and take it off.

701
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:58,405
Here we go.

702
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:04,870
See?

703
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,414
It just reveals to us what
the naked eye can't see.

704
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,082
Pretty far out, isn't it?

705
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,668
Yeah, it's groovy.

706
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,551
Drew, you got the Bolex ready for Brad?

707
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,095
Yeah, already locked and loaded, sir.

708
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,115
What? I had to go.

709
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,807
All the rooms are coming in pretty good.

710
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,184
Good.

711
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,149
What's in the bottle?

712
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:17,984
Holy water.

713
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,572
Presence of religious icons...

714
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,742
...will get a reaction
from anything unholy.

715
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,204
Sort of pisses them off.

716
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:34,000
So I set these throughout the house,
see if I can stir things up a bit.

717
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:40,674
- Like holding a cross to a vampire?
- Yeah. Exactly.

718
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:43,218
Except I don't believe in vampires.

719
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,516
Wasn't me.

720
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,532
Brad, get the camera.

721
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:10,453
Okay.

722
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:21,214
All right, it's 9:18, we're headed down into the
cellar where the door's just opened on its own.

723
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:24,217
I have Lorraine and Officer Brad Hamilton
with me.

724
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:26,553
Let's keep the cellar light off.

725
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:43,403
Give us a sign that you wanna
communicate with us.

726
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,433
Hon, you all right?

727
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,231
There's definitely something here.

728
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,778
- All right, close the door. Move something.
- My hands are so cold.

729
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,323
Come on.

730
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:34,621
No.

731
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,456
It's gone. It's gone.

732
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,124
I got nothing.

733
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:39,751
Okay.

734
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:03,817
Well, like I said, it doesn't always work
when you want it to.

735
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,778
Yeah, maybe the camera picked
something up.

736
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,822
Watch out!

737
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,160
<i>For a guy who doesn't believe...</i>

738
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:17,664
...you looked a little freaked out
when that door slammed shut.

739
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,585
It must have been a draft.

740
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:24,796
Oh, that's funny.

741
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,924
A draft never put that look
on my face before.

742
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,345
I believe the clock.

743
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,598
It's 3:08.

744
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:47,360
Let me see your glasses.

745
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:48,736
For you.

746
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:52,657
I think I might take some girls for ice cream
later on. What do you say about that?

747
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:54,993
- Yeah!
- Honey, you wanna come?

748
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,204
I'm exhausted. I'm just gonna take a nap.
The late nights are getting to me.

749
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,748
That's probably a good idea.
Why don't you get some rest.

750
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,543
- Lorraine and I'll watch over things for a bit.
- Really?

751
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,421
I'm gonna take off.
I have a shift starting in an hour.

752
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,756
The house hasn't felt like this
in a long time.

753
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,885
I think the kids feel a lot safer
with you around.

754
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,891
- I could get used to this.
- What, me doing laundry?

755
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,853
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You're funny.

756
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:23,980
No, this place.

757
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,483
Nice, fresh country air.

758
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:32,822
They have such a beautiful family,
don't they?

759
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:37,494
Yeah, that little one, April,
did you see her bring me pancakes?

760
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,501
We've gotta help them.

761
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,419
I know.

762
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:50,089
- I'll start with the Chevy.
- Heh.

763
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:13,506
Carolyn!

764
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:15,592
Are you okay?

765
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:16,926
Carolyn, open the door.

766
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,177
Carolyn, open up!

767
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,185
Are you okay?

768
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:27,645
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Are you sick?

769
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:30,648
- I woke up feeling nauseous, that's all.
- I thought I saw--

770
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:33,026
I hear Roger and the girls.

771
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,277
One minute.

772
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,625
- Guys, do you wanna play a game?
- Boring!

773
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:49,917
Thank you, Daddy.

774
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,378
Let's go inside.

775
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:57,800
I thought that was you.

776
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,218
Hey, I hope you don't mind.

777
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,055
I got a good deal on a rebuild
at that wrecking yard in Smithfield.

778
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:05,266
- No, you look like you know what you're doing.
- Yeah, we'll see.

779
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:09,896
Got a nice place here, Roger.

780
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:12,398
Lorraine and I always wanted
a spot in the country.

781
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:13,900
I'll sell you this one.

782
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:17,612
Hey, hand me a wrench, would you?

783
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:24,661
Hey, uh, it really means a lot
to us to have you here.

784
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,914
I gotta admit, I was a little
bit skeptical going in.

785
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:32,293
Just wanna say thank you, though,
for coming out when you did.

786
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:37,674
I can't take the credit.
That's, uh-- That's all Lorraine.

787
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,593
- I didn't want to.
- Oh. Why's that?

788
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:47,308
Whatever Lorraine sees, feels, touches,
it helps people.

789
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:49,602
But it also takes a toll on her.

790
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,187
Little piece each time.

791
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:57,860
Couple months ago
we were working on a case.

792
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,155
She saw something.

793
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:13,209
It took a real big piece.

794
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:16,629
When we got home...

795
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:19,841
...she went into our room,
locked herself in...

796
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:22,844
...didn't talk, didn't eat,
didn't come out for eight days.

797
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:25,138
What'd she see?

798
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:29,308
Get out of here!

799
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:31,644
I don't know.

800
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,813
And I won't ask.

801
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:54,542
I need to reload. You want some?

802
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:56,544
I'm good, thanks.

803
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,671
All right.

804
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,259
Look what she made me do.

805
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:31,222
Look what she made me do.

806
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,268
Hey.

807
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:43,776
Ed?

808
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:45,152
Look what she made me do!

809
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,948
Ed! Ed!

810
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:50,825
Ed!

811
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:53,160
Dude, you okay?

812
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:54,787
Hold up, Brad. What's going on?

813
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:57,874
I saw someone. There was
a woman dressed as a maid.

814
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:03,504
Ed? Ed, we're getting something.

815
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:11,637
- It's just Cindy. She's sleepwalking.
- No, wait. We need this.

816
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:13,347
Why do we need pictures of Cindy?

817
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:15,850
She didn't trigger it.

818
01:13:16,017 --> 01:13:19,312
- What do you mean she didn't trigger it?
- Somebody's with her.

819
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:23,649
Who?

820
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,905
Cindy!

821
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:33,910
Cindy!

822
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,084
Cindy!

823
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,878
Hey, over here. It's safe.

824
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:45,922
There's someone else in there with her.

825
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:49,508
I'm hearing another voice. Here, listen.

826
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:56,515
Follow me. This way.

827
01:13:58,017 --> 01:13:59,810
<i>This is where I hide.</i>

828
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,192
Cindy?

829
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:10,029
Cindy?

830
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,032
Where'd she go, Ed?

831
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,034
Windows are locked.

832
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:20,039
Ed, where'd she go?

833
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:22,917
Brad, get the UV light.

834
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:25,252
- The what?
- Just ask Drew.

835
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:29,173
- Drew, I need a UV light.
- Uh--

836
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,841
Here, that's it. Go, go, go, go!

837
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:38,933
Turn off the light.

838
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:44,105
Get out of the way.

839
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:48,401
Okay.

840
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,181
Hit the lights!

841
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:32,778
Found her.

842
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:35,448
Here we go.

843
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:38,284
- All right. You got her?
- Yeah.

844
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:53,049
That's where Rory hides
when he's afraid.

845
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,744
Hon? Could I have April's
music box, please?

846
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:27,541
- How's Cindy?
- She doesn't remember a thing.

847
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:31,837
Here you go.

848
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:33,881
Thank you.

849
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:12,878
Lorraine!

850
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,217
No.

851
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,314
Lorraine!

852
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:33,816
Lorraine!

853
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:39,572
Lorraine!

854
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:41,740
Lorraine!

855
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:35,628
She made me do it.

856
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:39,298
She made me do it.

857
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:03,614
She made me do it.

858
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:48,367
Ed!

859
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:50,369
Come on! Lorraine!

860
01:19:58,210 --> 01:19:59,336
Ed!

861
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,880
Ed, I know what she did.

862
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:04,633
- I got you. I know. It's okay.
- I know what she did.

863
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,720
I know what she did. She possessed
the mother to kill the child.

864
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:09,388
She visits Carolyn every night.

865
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:12,391
That's what the bruise marks are!
She's feeding off of her!

866
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,072
Uh...

867
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,741
Nancy?

868
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:34,496
Nancy!

869
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:36,165
Are you okay?

870
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,083
Nancy!

871
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:40,627
Grab her!

872
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:44,715
Daddy! Help!

873
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:46,675
Nancy!

874
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,017
Is she okay?

875
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,393
It's okay, I got you.

876
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,603
Did you get that?

877
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,065
Yeah.

878
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:07,237
I'll have the footage developed
and get it over to Father Gordon.

879
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:11,408
He's our liaison at the church.
I imagine we'll get a pretty fast response.

880
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:13,619
- Listen, Roger?
- Yeah?

881
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:16,955
Listen, when we get the exorcist,
I'll be back. But Lorraine--

882
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:20,209
- Yeah, I understand.
- Until then Drew's gonna keep an eye on you.

883
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,711
- Hey, Ed, thank you for everything.
- Yeah.

884
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:25,422
<i>Mommy?</i>

885
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:29,385
That's everything.

886
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,689
<i>Mommy?</i>

887
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:02,126
Judy?

888
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:03,794
Oh, God!

889
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:05,087
Judy?

890
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,681
Lorraine! Wait!

891
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:18,809
Lorraine. What?

892
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:20,310
Mom, it's me. Is Judy okay?

893
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:22,980
- What?
- Can you go check, please?

894
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:25,190
Damn it, Mom, just check, please!

895
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:28,193
- Are you gonna tell me what's going on?
- It's Judy.

896
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,862
What? What do you mean?

897
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:31,989
What?

898
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:35,534
Oh, thank God.

899
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:39,371
Mom, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you. I'll explain later, okay?

900
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:42,332
What the hell happened?

901
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:45,961
I had a vision of Judy in the water.

902
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:48,380
I know it was some kind of warning.

903
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:51,133
I know it.

904
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,509
Okay.

905
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:55,888
Let's get out of here.

906
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:46,355
- So?
- Yeah, well, you weren't kidding.

907
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:47,606
No.

908
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:52,569
Look, Ed, this is complicated
because the kids aren't baptized.

909
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:55,948
- No, I understand.
- And the family are not members of the church.

910
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:57,449
- Oh, come on.
- And...

911
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:01,745
The approval would have to come
directly from the Vatican.

912
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:06,041
Father, we've never seen nothing like this.

913
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,631
Yeah, well, neither have I.

914
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:23,225
Father, they don't have a lot of time.

915
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:25,060
All right.

916
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:28,146
I'll push it through myself.

917
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:30,274
- Thank you, Father. Thank you.
- Thank you.

918
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:33,777
- All right, we'll wait for your call.
- Yeah.

919
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,718
Mommy? Daddy?

920
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:58,570
Mommy?

921
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:00,405
Daddy?

922
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,597
Dad?

923
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:43,365
Nanna?

924
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:45,992
Nanna?

925
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:00,298
Aah!

926
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:41,840
Nanna!

927
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:44,843
Nanna, help! Nanna, help!

928
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:46,052
Judy?

929
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:47,429
Nanna!

930
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:49,014
Nanna!

931
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:50,557
Nanna!

932
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:52,309
Help!

933
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:54,352
- Judy!
- Nanna!

934
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:56,354
- Judy, open the door!
- Mom!

935
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:00,358
- Ed, there's something wrong.
- What?

936
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:04,654
Nanna!

937
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:06,865
- Judy!
- Help!

938
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:09,201
- Judy! Judy, open this door!
- What is it?

939
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:12,496
- What's wrong with her? Judy!
- Hey, move. Move, move, move, move.

940
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:14,289
Judy, get back, honey. Get back!

941
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,166
- Come on!
- Hurry.

942
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:18,794
Help! Help!

943
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,087
Get away from the door, Judy!

944
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:25,967
Aah!

945
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,803
Oh, God! Are you okay?

946
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:32,057
There was someone rocking
in the chair with Annabelle.

947
01:28:35,101 --> 01:28:36,228
What?

948
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:40,732
It's okay.

949
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:02,087
She's still in the case.

950
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:05,924
It's okay.

951
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:08,760
It's okay. It's okay.

952
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:16,685
- Dad! Dad!
- Daddy!

953
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:19,187
Dad! Dad! Mom just left
with Christine and April.

954
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,815
She went in the car and drove away.
I don't know what happened.

955
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:24,526
- She smells like rotting meat.
- She didn't say what was going on.

956
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:28,280
- What do you mean, she left? Left where?
- Gone! I don't know where she was going.

957
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:35,370
Where are we going, Mom?

958
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:45,255
- Hello?
<i>- It's Roger.</i>

959
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:46,756
<i>Something's going on with Carolyn.</i>

960
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:49,801
Andrea was here,
said Carolyn took off with Christine and April.

961
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:52,721
- <i>The girls said she smelled like rotten meat.</i>
- Possesses the mother...

962
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:55,640
...to kill the child, that's what she does.
She's taking them to the house.

963
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:57,642
Roger, get back to the house now.
I'll meet you.

964
01:29:57,809 --> 01:30:01,229
Lock the door, close the blinds.
Stay off the phone!

965
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:03,607
Go.

966
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:10,739
- I'm coming.
- No, you stay with Judy.

967
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:13,325
Only way to protect Judy
is if we stop this where it started.

968
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:16,620
- Otherwise, she'll latch onto us again.
- That's exactly why I am going.

969
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:19,414
You think I'm gonna let you walk
into this alone?

970
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,416
I can't lose you.

971
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,251
You won't.

972
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,087
Let's finish this together.

973
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,609
- Agh! It's locked.
- Carolyn!

974
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:49,194
Roger!

975
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:50,487
Get out of the way!

976
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,370
- Roger!
- Ed!

977
01:30:58,536 --> 01:31:00,121
- Carolyn!
- Ed!

978
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:02,540
- Carolyn!
- We're down here!

979
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:05,543
Carolyn, don't!
No, no! She's got--!

980
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,837
Get her hand! Get the scissors!

981
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:21,434
- We gotta get her to the car!
- And bring her where?

982
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:23,603
To take her to the priest
for the exorcism.

983
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:25,146
- Where's April?
- April?

984
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:28,817
April!

985
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,695
Take Christine to the car and find April!

986
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:32,904
April!

987
01:31:34,072 --> 01:31:35,365
Come on!

988
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:47,752
- She won't let her leave the house.
- What do you mean?

989
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,338
- If we take her out, the witch will kill her.
- Agh!

990
01:31:56,928 --> 01:31:59,681
Roger!

991
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:01,182
Carolyn!

992
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:02,600
Go!

993
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:03,852
Carolyn?

994
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,443
Okay, I'm gonna put you in here.
Come on.

995
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:14,237
- Get in. Stay in here.
- I don't wanna stay here by myself.

996
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:16,197
Stay in here no matter what.
I'll be back.

997
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:18,783
I have to find April, okay?
I'll be back, I promise.

998
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:22,912
April?

999
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:27,125
You okay?

1000
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:33,298
Stop!

1001
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,845
Brad! Brad!

1002
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:44,267
Aah!

1003
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:54,486
Let's get something to tie her up!

1004
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:03,453
Hold it.

1005
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,925
I gotta call Father Gordon.
We gotta get him out here.

1006
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:19,427
He's too far away.
She won't make it. Look at her.

1007
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:32,524
- Then you need to leave.
- What are you talking about?

1008
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:34,818
I have to do it. The exorcism.

1009
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:38,196
What? I thought you said we
need a priest. You're not a priest.

1010
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:40,824
- Well, you got a better idea?
- He can do it.

1011
01:33:41,908 --> 01:33:44,119
- You can do it.
- But you gotta get out of here.

1012
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:47,872
- I'm not leaving you!
- Damn it, I'm not doing this with you in here!

1013
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:52,961
God brought us together for a reason.
This is it.

1014
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,547
I'm gonna get the book.

1015
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:13,523
April!

1016
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:23,741
April!

1017
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:49,100
"In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit."

1018
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:29,974
April!

1019
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:31,953
Hold her still! Hold her still!

1020
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,871
Come here! Hold her still!

1021
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:43,965
April?

1022
01:36:50,847 --> 01:36:51,889
April!

1023
01:36:52,056 --> 01:36:53,599
April, you under there?

1024
01:36:55,018 --> 01:36:56,060
April!

1025
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:04,736
Carolyn. Carolyn. Don't give in!
Don't let her take you!

1026
01:37:04,902 --> 01:37:06,946
Ed! You gotta stop,
you're killing her. Stop!

1027
01:37:07,113 --> 01:37:08,489
No, he can't!

1028
01:37:09,449 --> 01:37:13,328
Roger, help me!

1029
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:20,251
Ed! Goddamn it, stop it!

1030
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:22,837
Understand this! We are
now fighting for her soul!

1031
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:26,257
"In the name of Jesus Christ,
the saints and all the angels...

1032
01:37:26,424 --> 01:37:28,509
...I command you to reveal yourself!"

1033
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:00,500
Roger, help me!

1034
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:53,136
Put her down!

1035
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:55,263
Put her down!

1036
01:38:57,473 --> 01:38:58,558
Put her down!

1037
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:01,644
Carolyn!

1038
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:03,146
Carolyn!

1039
01:39:05,857 --> 01:39:07,984
- Ed, look out!
- Unh!

1040
01:39:11,446 --> 01:39:12,947
Are you okay?

1041
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:16,909
Hold her still! Don't let her up!

1042
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:18,494
We're losing her, Roger!

1043
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:21,205
Damn you! You leave my family alone,
you hear me?

1044
01:39:21,372 --> 01:39:24,000
I don't know what you are, but you leave
my wife alone, goddamn it!

1045
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:27,170
Let her go!
Do you hear me? Let her go!

1046
01:39:29,547 --> 01:39:31,966
Let her go, goddamn it! Let her go!

1047
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:40,475
She's already gone.

1048
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:43,311
And now you're all gonna die.

1049
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:51,861
April!

1050
01:39:52,028 --> 01:39:55,907
I found her! She's under the house!
Under the kitchen!

1051
01:39:57,450 --> 01:39:58,534
Don't! No!

1052
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:00,661
Get her!

1053
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:16,511
- Here.
- Carolyn!

1054
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:21,390
- Carolyn!
- She's in that hole. Right there.

1055
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:26,103
Carolyn? Oh, my God. No!

1056
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:28,981
Can't go in. Can't reach.

1057
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,691
No! Carolyn, don't!

1058
01:40:33,069 --> 01:40:34,403
Carolyn, no!

1059
01:40:34,695 --> 01:40:36,572
Bathsheba!

1060
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:42,954
By the power of God,
I condemn you back to hell!

1061
01:40:45,456 --> 01:40:46,916
This is your daughter!

1062
01:40:49,085 --> 01:40:51,754
- You can't give in!
- Agh!

1063
01:40:51,921 --> 01:40:54,173
Roger. We need to get her
to fight from the inside.

1064
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:56,884
Don't let her do this.
Don't let this thing do this.

1065
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:59,262
You gotta fight it.
You're stronger than she is.

1066
01:40:59,428 --> 01:41:01,305
- You gotta fight!
- Keep it going, Roger!

1067
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:04,225
You gotta stay with us, all right?
Come on back, Carolyn.

1068
01:41:04,809 --> 01:41:06,269
You're in, that's it! Get her back!

1069
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:09,063
- Remember what you showed me.
- No!

1070
01:41:10,982 --> 01:41:13,484
Remember that day that you said
you would never forget.

1071
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:25,580
You said they meant the world to you.

1072
01:41:26,122 --> 01:41:28,332
This is what you'll be leaving behind.

1073
01:42:07,204 --> 01:42:08,497
Mommy?

1074
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:37,485
Oh.

1075
01:42:41,739 --> 01:42:43,199
It's over.

1076
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:45,284
I am so sorry.

1077
01:42:45,451 --> 01:42:49,455
I love you so much. I love you so much.

1078
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:50,956
I love you so much.

1079
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:53,918
I'm so happy.

1080
01:43:15,898 --> 01:43:17,608
A draft do that to your face?

1081
01:43:18,401 --> 01:43:20,486
I'd take a guy with a gun any day.

1082
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:26,200
You did good.

1083
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:28,035
No, you did.

1084
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:31,807
I'll call Father Gordon
and let him know what happened.

1085
01:44:32,725 --> 01:44:34,268
Sounds good.

1086
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:02,129
The Vatican approved the exorcism.

1087
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:04,423
Heh. Nice timing.

1088
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:09,720
And if we can, then he'd like
to meet with us tomorrow.

1089
01:45:09,887 --> 01:45:12,389
There's a case in Long Island
he'd like to discuss.

1090
01:45:12,556 --> 01:45:13,641
Really?
