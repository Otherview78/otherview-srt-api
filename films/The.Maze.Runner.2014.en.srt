1
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,149
Hello?

2
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,195
Hello?

3
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:29,047
Hey! Hey! Help me!

4
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,043
Go get him.

5
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,590
Day one, Greenie.

6
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:12,841
Rise and shine.

7
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,053
He looks like
a slopper to me.

8
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,306
I could use some
help in the kitchen.

9
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,311
Oh!

10
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,979
Hey, we got a runner!

11
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,488
Oh!

12
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,330
Take it all in.

13
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,786
He's all yours.

14
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,966
Hey.

15
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,888
Hey there, Green Bean.

16
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,683
You're not gonna
run again. Okay?

17
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,311
Good.

18
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,487
My name is Alby.

19
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,198
Can you tell me anything
about yourself?

20
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,324
Who you are?

21
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,494
Where you came from?
Anything at all.

22
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,542
No.

23
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,377
Can you tell
me your name?

24
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,967
I, uh, I can't
remember anything.

25
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:21,928
Why can't
I remember anything?

26
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:22,971
It's okay.

27
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,640
Hey, relax.

28
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,017
Relax.

29
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,519
It's normal.

30
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,314
It happens to us all.

31
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,025
You'll get your name
back in a day or two.

32
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,029
It's the one thing
they let us keep.

33
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,534
What is this place?

34
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,331
Let me show you.

35
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,759
We eat here.

36
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,260
We sleep here.

37
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,804
We grow
our own food.

38
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,388
We build
our own shelter.

39
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,892
Whatever we need,
the Box provides.

40
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,060
The rest
is up to us.

41
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,394
The Box?

42
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,689
Yeah. It's sent up
once a month

43
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,108
with fresh supplies
and a new Greenie.

44
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,735
This month
that's you.

45
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,362
Congratulations.

46
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,242
Sent up?
By who, though?
Who put us here?

47
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,577
That, we don't know.

48
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,081
Hey, are you
all right, Alby?
A-ha!

49
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,083
Green Bean,
meet Newt.

50
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,918
When I'm not around,
he's in charge.

51
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,753
Well, it's a good thing
you're always around then.

52
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,922
That was some dash
you made earlier.

53
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,967
For a second,
I thought you had the
chops to be a runner...

54
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,927
..till you
face-planted.

55
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,262
That was great.

56
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,430
Wait, a "runner"?

57
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,141
Newt, do me a favor.
Go find Chuck.

58
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,602
All right.
Thanks.

59
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,648
Look, I'm sorry
to rush this.

60
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,943
You came up a little late,
and there's a lot to do.

61
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,487
We got something special
planned tonight.

62
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,906
Yeah. You'll see.

63
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,619
I hope you're not
afraid of heights.

64
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,788
Let's go. Come on.

65
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,170
This is
all we got.

66
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,174
We've worked
hard for it.

67
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,594
If you respect
this place...

68
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,638
you and I will
get along just fine.

69
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,515
What's out there?

70
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,652
We only have
three rules.

71
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,323
First, do your part.

72
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,992
No time for
any freeloaders.

73
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,829
Second, never
harm another Glader.

74
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,081
None of this works
unless we have trust.

75
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,501
Most importantly...

76
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,922
never go beyond
those walls.

77
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,675
Do you understand
me, Greenie?

78
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,428
Hey, Alby!

79
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,810
Hey, Chuck.
Where you been, man?

80
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,273
It's basically the same
story for all of us.

81
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,527
We wake up in the Box,
Alby gives us the tour...

82
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,030
then here we are.

83
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,867
Don't worry.

84
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,994
You're already
doing better than I did.

85
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,246
I clunked
my pants three times

86
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,290
before they got
me out of the pit.

87
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,504
No, come on.

88
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,054
Dude, where
are you going?

89
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,389
I just wanna see.

90
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,057
You can look
around all you want

91
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,725
but you better
not go out there.

92
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,352
Why not?
What's through there?

93
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,230
I don't know.
I just know
what I'm told.

94
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,731
And we're not
supposed to leave.

95
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,077
Hey, Chuck.
New Greenie, huh?

96
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,079
How does it feel
to be promoted?

97
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,706
Feels great, Ben.

98
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,251
I thought no one
was allowed to leave.

99
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,211
I said we're not
allowed to leave.

100
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,838
They're different,
they're runners.

101
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,715
They know more about
the maze than anyone.

102
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,174
Wait, what?

103
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,592
What?

104
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,594
What? You just
said "maze."

105
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,596
I did?

106
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,764
Yeah.

107
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,103
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

108
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,438
I'm just gonna
take a look.

109
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,064
I told you,
you can't.

110
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,775
No one leaves,
especially not now.

111
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,069
It's not safe.

112
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,447
Okay, all right,
I'm not gonna go.

113
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,040
Hey!

114
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,128
We gotta
stop meeting
like this, Greenie.

115
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,504
Get off me!

116
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,714
All right!
Calm, calm, calm.

117
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,882
Don't touch me!

118
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,633
Whoa! Take it easy!

119
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,760
Just relax.

120
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,553
What the hell is
wrong with you guys?

121
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,763
Just calm down,
all right?

122
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,890
No, okay?
Why won't you tell
me what's out there?

123
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,475
We're just
trying to protect you.
It's for your own good.

124
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,642
You guys can't
just keep me here.

125
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,728
I can't let you leave.
Why not?

126
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,790
What the hell?

127
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,401
Next time,
I'm gonna
let you leave.

128
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,700
Welcome to the Glade.

129
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,254
Light him up!

130
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,871
Hell of a
first day, Greenie.

131
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,583
Here.

132
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,835
Put some hair
on your chest.

133
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,676
Oh!

134
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,847
Oh, my God!
What is that?

135
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,476
I don't
even know.

136
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,479
It's Gally's recipe.

137
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,690
It's a trade secret.

138
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,694
Yeah, well,
he's still an asshole.

139
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,322
He saved
your life today.

140
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,869
Trust me. The maze
is a dangerous place.

141
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,794
We're trapped here,
aren't we?

142
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,672
For the moment.

143
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,635
But...

144
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,678
you see those guys?

145
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,014
There, by the fire?

146
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,516
Those are the runners.

147
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,728
That guy in the middle
there, that's Minho.

148
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,231
He's the Keeper
of the Runners.

149
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,151
Every morning,
when those doors open,
they run the maze...

150
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,278
mapping it,
memorizing it,

151
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,655
trying to
find a way out.

152
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,658
How long have
they been looking?

153
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,244
Three years.

154
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,665
And they haven't
found anything?

155
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,251
It's a lot
easier said than done.

156
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,170
Listen.

157
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,467
Hear that?

158
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,762
It's the maze,
changing.

159
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,723
It changes
every night.

160
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,851
How is that
even possible?

161
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,479
You can ask the people
who put us in here,

162
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,690
if you ever
meet the bastards.

163
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,861
Listen,
the truth is...

164
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,488
the runners
are the only ones

165
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,031
who really know
what's out there.

166
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,367
They are the
strongest and the
fastest of us all.

167
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,451
And it's a good
thing, too...

168
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,620
because if they
don't make it back before
those doors close...

169
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,706
then they are
stuck out there
for the night.

170
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,252
And no one
has ever survived
a night in the maze.

171
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,509
What happens
to them?

172
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,432
Well, we call
them Grievers.

173
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,811
Of course, no one's
ever seen one

174
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,354
and lived to
tell about it.

175
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,899
But they're out there.

176
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,782
Right, that's enough
questions for one night.

177
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:45,867
Come on.

178
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,578
You're supposed to
be the guest of honor.

179
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,413
Oh, no...
No! No, come on.

180
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,914
Let me show you around.

181
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,833
Come on.

182
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,046
Whoa!

183
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,672
And there
we got the builders.

184
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,466
They're very good
with their hands...

185
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,551
but not a lot
going on upstairs.

186
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,636
And then
we got Winston...

187
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,014
he's the Keeper
of the Slicers.

188
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,516
And we got
two med-jacks,
Clint and Jeff.

189
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,226
Hey, what's up?
Yo, Newt.

190
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,396
They spend most
of their time bandaging
up the slicers.

191
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,482
What if I want
to be a runner?

192
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,859
Have you listened to
a word I've just said?

193
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,569
No one wants
to be a runner.

194
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,821
And, besides,
you gotta get chosen.

195
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,031
Chosen by who?

196
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,532
Whoa!

197
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,663
What do you
say, Greenie?

198
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,499
Wanna see what
you're made of?

199
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,543
Greenie! Greenie! Greenie!

200
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,271
Okay. All right.

201
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,024
The rules are
simple, Greenie.

202
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,734
I try to push you
out of the circle...

203
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,737
you try to last more
than five seconds.

204
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,697
Take it
easy on the Greenie.
Ready?

205
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,580
Get up, boy.

206
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,958
Come on, Greenie.
We're not done yet.

207
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,711
Stop calling me Greenie.

208
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,255
Stop calling you that?

209
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,924
What do you wanna
be called? Shank?

210
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:28,928
What do you
think, boys?

211
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,471
Does he look
like a Shank?

212
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,895
Whoa!

213
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:38,980
Come on!

214
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,858
You know what?
I think I've settled
on Shank.

215
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:52,869
Oh!

216
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,370
There you go,
Greenie!

217
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:58,791
Not bad for
a Greenie, huh?

218
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,377
Oh!

219
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,135
Thomas.

220
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,180
Thomas. Hey!

221
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,056
Thomas!

222
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,437
I remember my name.
I'm Thomas!

223
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,482
Thomas!

224
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,654
Welcome home, Thomas.

225
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,043
Good job... Thomas.

226
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,053
What the hell
was that?

227
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,891
That, my friend,
was a Griever.

228
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,187
Don't worry,
you're safe
here with us.

229
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,023
Nothing gets
through those walls.

230
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:05,983
All right, guys.

231
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,152
Let's tuck it in for
the night. Come on.

232
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,654
It was a good night.

233
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,240
Good job, man.

234
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,854
You're safe here with us.

235
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,231
Wicked is good.

236
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,357
What's out there?

237
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,109
Thomas, Thomas.

238
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,572
Can you hear me?

239
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,199
Everything is going to change.

240
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,828
Thomas.

241
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,663
Shh.

242
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,002
Follow me.

243
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,594
It's peaceful, isn't it?

244
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,806
I know it's hard to believe,
but it wasn't always this way.

245
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,934
We had dark days.

246
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,771
We lost a lot of boys to fear.

247
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,565
To panic.

248
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,901
We've come
far since then.

249
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,988
Established
order...

250
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,282
made peace.

251
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,494
Yeah. Why are
you telling me this?

252
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,747
Because you're not
like the others.

253
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,208
You're curious.

254
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,669
But you're
one of us now.

255
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,797
You need to know
what that means.

256
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,030
What happened
to them?

257
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,324
Like I said...

258
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,577
dark days,
Thomas.

259
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,760
Has anyone tried
climbing to the top?

260
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,181
Tried it. The ivy
doesn't go all
the way to the top.

261
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,558
And besides,
where are you gonna
go from there?

262
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,727
And what
about the Box?

263
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,020
You know, next
time it comes up--

264
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,730
No, we tried that.

265
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,691
The Box won't
go back down with
someone in it.

266
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,109
Okay, what if we--

267
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,402
No, we tried it,
all right?

268
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,778
Twice.

269
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,700
All right? Trust me.
Anything you think of,
we've already tried.

270
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,370
The only way
out of here is
through the maze.

271
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,373
Now, look,
you wanna be helpful?

272
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,917
Here.

273
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,919
Go dig us up
some more fertilizer.

274
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,097
"Just get the fertilizer,
Thomas."

275
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,225
"Are you sure, guys?
I can't help in
any other way?"

276
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,519
"No, just get
the fertilizer.

277
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,356
"You know where it is.
It's just out in the
middle of the woods."

278
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,189
Oh!

279
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,359
Uh...

280
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,445
You're Ben, right?

281
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,363
I don't know
if we ever--

282
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,366
Are you okay?

283
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,455
Get the hell off me!

284
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,499
It's your fault.

285
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,042
I saw you.

286
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,543
You did this.

287
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,086
I saw you!

288
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,987
Hey! Hey!

289
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,327
Hey!

290
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,955
Help!

291
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,541
Help! Help!

292
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,085
Help!

293
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,092
I'll kill you!

294
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,594
Hey!

295
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,306
Hold him down.

296
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,225
What are you doing?

297
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,393
Calm down, Ben.

298
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,769
What the hell happened?

299
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:34,937
He just attacked me!

300
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,021
Are you okay?

301
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,190
Calm down, Ben.

302
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,237
No. No.

303
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,531
All right,
lift his shirt.

304
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,658
Lift his shirt.
No! No!

305
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,994
No! No!
Please. Please.

306
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,498
He's been stung.

307
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,834
In the middle
of the day?

308
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,004
Help me, please.

309
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,380
Please.

310
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,965
Please, just help.

311
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,551
Put him in the pit.

312
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,136
Everybody, help.
Take him to the pit.

313
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,888
No!
Med-jack!

314
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,347
Please don't do it!

315
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,182
Calm down, Ben.

316
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,517
Back down, Ben.

317
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,769
Listen to me! Please!

318
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,858
Please, stop, please!

319
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,568
He did this!

320
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,487
Please stop! No!
No, please! Help me!

321
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,156
So what happened to him?

322
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,912
It's called
"The Changing."

323
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,041
It's what happens
when someone gets stung.

324
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,002
Listen.

325
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,217
We haven't been able
to get a clear word

326
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,136
out of Ben
since it happened.

327
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,139
He's not making
any sense.

328
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,392
And it's only
gonna get worse.

329
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,645
The infection
is spreading.

330
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,521
He's dangerous.

331
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,109
What did
he say to you?

332
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,243
He said he saw me...

333
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,496
and that this
was all my fault.

334
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,042
How could this
be my fault?

335
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,758
Get some rest.

336
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,636
Alby?
Yeah.

337
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,555
What's gonna
happen to him?

338
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:52,074
Just listen to me.
Just, please, listen to me!

339
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,742
Please, Minho!

340
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:56,954
Alby!

341
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,108
No, please.
Please, don't.

342
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,484
Please, don't do it.

343
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,376
Poles!

344
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,971
Move in!

345
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,016
No, no, no! Please!

346
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,644
No, please!
Please, don't!

347
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,689
I can get better!
Please, just listen to me!

348
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,649
Please, stop, please!

349
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,903
Push him in!
Stop!

350
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,906
I'll get better!

351
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,443
He belongs
to the maze now.

352
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,067
Do you think he might make it?

353
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,029
Ben?

354
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,366
No.

355
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,412
No one survives
a night in the maze.

356
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,459
We just gotta
forget about him.

357
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,741
Thomas.

358
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,785
Wicked is good.

359
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,746
Don't make it easy on them.

360
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,957
Thomas.

361
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,793
Everything is going to change.

362
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,172
Wicked is good.

363
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,635
This is gonna hurt a little.

364
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,013
Wicked is good.

365
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,849
Thomas, you have to choose.

366
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,380
But why would Alby
go into the maze?

367
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,882
I mean,
he's not a runner.

368
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,509
Things
are different now.

369
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,011
Alby went to
retrace Ben's footsteps
before sundown.

370
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,179
Are you gonna help?

371
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,306
So he's gonna
go back to where
Ben was just stung--

372
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,683
Alby knows
what he's doing...

373
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,184
all right?

374
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,852
He knows better
than any of us.

375
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,356
What does
that mean?

376
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,320
Well, it's like
you have heard, yeah?

377
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,448
Every month,
the Box sends
up a new arrival.

378
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,200
But someone had
to be first, right?

379
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,455
Someone had to have
spent a whole month
in the Glade, alone.

380
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,959
That was Alby.

381
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,629
I mean,
it can't have been easy.

382
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,964
But when those
other boys started

383
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,632
coming up,
one after the other...

384
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,801
he saw the truth.

385
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,178
And he learned
that the most
important thing...

386
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,180
is that we all
have each other.

387
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,310
Because we're all
in this together.

388
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,912
Yeah.

389
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,665
There you go,
Greenie.

390
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,691
They should be back by now.

391
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,277
What happens if
they don't make it?

392
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,613
They're gonna
make it.

393
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,742
What happens
if they don't?

394
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,453
They're gonna
make it.

395
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,571
Come on, guys,
can't we send
someone after them?

396
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,115
That's against the rules.

397
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,159
Either they make it
back or they don't.

398
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,162
We can't risk
losing anyone else.

399
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,508
Oh, no.

400
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:10,679
There!

401
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,016
Wait,
something's wrong.

402
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,020
Come on, Minho,
you can do it!

403
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,273
Come on! Go!

404
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,193
Come on,
you can make it!

405
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,862
Minho, you gotta
leave him!

406
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,613
They're not
gonna make it.

407
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,824
You gotta
leave him!

408
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,218
Thomas, no!

409
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,526
Good job.

410
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,197
You just
killed yourself.

411
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,158
What?

412
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,256
What happened
to him?

413
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,091
What does it
look like?

414
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,928
He got stung.

415
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,931
What happened
to his head?

416
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,601
I did what
I had to do.

417
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,699
Okay. Okay,
help me get him up.

418
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,118
We gotta go.
The maze is
already changing.

419
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,745
Hey, Minho!

420
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,750
We can't just
leave him here.

421
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,973
We gotta get him up.

422
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,439
Come on.

423
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,160
Just sit him down.
Sit him down.

424
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,551
This isn't going to work.
We gotta go.

425
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:55,760
We gotta go!

426
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,221
Wait,
what are you talking about?
We gotta hide him.

427
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,514
Where?
I don't know.

428
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:02,350
Are you telling me
there's not a single place
we could take him?

429
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,688
Listen to me,
shuck-face, all right.

430
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:10,317
Take a look around.
There's nowhere to go!

431
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,282
You don't get it.

432
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:19,451
We're already dead.

433
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,682
Two, three...

434
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,397
Two, three...

435
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,402
Okay.

436
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,323
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

437
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,410
What are you doing?

438
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,583
We gotta go.
We gotta go now!

439
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,586
No, no, just a little more
and we'll tie it off.

440
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,424
Minho, stay with me.

441
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,301
Stay with me, Minho.

442
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,969
Just a little more,
we're almost there.

443
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,638
I'm sorry, Greenie.
What?

444
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:22,806
Minho!

445
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,347
Okay.

446
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,158
Come on.

447
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,258
Whoa!

448
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,745
Oh!

449
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,748
Oh, shit!

450
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,175
Whoa!

451
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,518
Whoa!

452
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,569
You're a crazy
son of a bitch.

453
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,947
Come on, follow me.
Come on!

454
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,415
Okay, it's changing.
Come on, come on!

455
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,667
This section
is closing.
Come on.

456
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,502
We can lose
it down here!

457
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,344
Thomas!

458
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,012
What are you waiting for?
Get out of there!

459
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,020
Come on!

460
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,651
Come on!

461
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,152
Come on, Thomas!
Don't look back!

462
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,029
Run!

463
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,031
Move it, Thomas! Go on!

464
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,951
Move your ass!
Let's go! Come on!

465
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,036
Come on, Greenie!
Let's go!

466
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:56,996
Thomas!

467
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,131
Guys, get up!

468
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,315
I told you, Chuck.

469
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,526
They're not coming back.

470
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,861
Let's go.

471
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,580
No way.

472
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:41,874
Yeah!

473
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:43,876
Yes!

474
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,503
Yeah!

475
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,551
I got him,
I got him, I got him.

476
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,594
Watch out. Easy.

477
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,389
What happened out there?
How did you guys make it out?

478
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,186
You saw a Griever?

479
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,606
Yeah, I saw one.

480
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:08,276
He didn't just see it.

481
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,445
He killed it.

482
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:23,041
Things are changing.

483
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,627
There's no denying that.

484
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,382
First, Ben gets
stung in broad daylight.

485
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,634
And then Alby.

486
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:38,222
And now our Greenie, here,
has taken it upon himself...

487
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,974
to go into the maze.

488
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,479
Which is a
clear violation of
our rules here.

489
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,482
Yeah...
but he saved Alby's life.

490
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:49,776
Did he?

491
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,823
For 3 years,
we have coexisted
with these things.

492
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,992
And now, you've killed
one of them.

493
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,081
Who knows what that
could mean for us.

494
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,084
What do you
suggest we do?

495
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,252
He has to
be punished.

496
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,005
Come on.
He killed a Griever!

497
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,174
Minho.

498
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,135
You were there with him.
What do you think?

499
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,516
I think...

500
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,602
in all the time
we've been here...

501
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,647
no one has ever
killed a Griever before.

502
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,820
When I turned
tail and ran...

503
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,281
this dumb shank stayed
behind to help Alby.

504
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:41,786
Look, I don't know
if he's brave or stupid.

505
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,500
But whatever it is,
we need more of it.

506
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,378
I say we make
him a runner.

507
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,630
A runner? What?

508
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,007
Minho, let's not
jump the gun, here.

509
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,052
Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!

510
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:02,181
If you want to throw
the newbie a parade,
that's fine.

511
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,058
Go ahead.

512
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,853
But if there is one thing
I know about the maze...

513
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,229
it is that you do not--

514
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:24,829
Okay, wait.
I know that sound.

515
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,080
The Box.
It's coming back up.

516
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,206
It shouldn't be.

517
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:39,927
Newt, what do you see?

518
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,429
Do you see it?

519
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,431
It's a girl.

520
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:46,934
No way.

521
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,773
I think she's dead.

522
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:54,942
What's in her hand?

523
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:11,083
"She's the
last one... ever."

524
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,546
What the hell
does that mean?

525
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,757
Whoa!

526
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,093
Thomas...

527
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,237
Do you still think
I'm overreacting?

528
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,586
Jeff, what's going on?

529
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,797
What's the matter with her?
Why won't she wake up?

530
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:00,967
Hey man, I got my job
the same way you did.

531
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,766
Do you
recognize her?

532
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:10,768
No.

533
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,021
Really? Because
she seemed to
recognize you.

534
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:16,691
What about
the note?

535
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,027
We'll worry
about the note later.

536
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,530
I think you should
worry about it now.

537
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,325
We've got enough to
deal with at the moment.

538
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,202
He's right, Newt.

539
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,788
If the Box isn't
coming back up,

540
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,373
how long do you
think we can last?

541
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,042
No one said that.

542
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,837
Let's not jump
to any conclusions.

543
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,299
We'll just wait
until she wakes up
and see what she knows.

544
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,886
Somebody has gotta have
some answers around here.

545
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,681
Okay.

546
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,852
Where are you going?
Back into the maze.

547
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:58,733
Hey.

548
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,068
Hey, Thomas.

549
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:05,323
What is this with you, huh?
A death wish?

550
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,658
You just got out and
now you want back in?

551
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,828
Newt said that no one
has ever seen a Griever

552
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,830
and lived to tell
about it, right?

553
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,416
Minho, now we have one.

554
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:18,586
You're telling me
you're not even
a little bit curious?

555
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:20,379
Not really, no.

556
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,594
So, what's the plan?

557
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,679
You're gonna go out
and dissect that
thing all by yourself?

558
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,598
I will if I have to.

559
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,267
Have the other
runners left yet?

560
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,603
The other runners
quit this morning.

561
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,440
After Alby
got stung, they're not

562
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,108
in any hurry to
get back out there.

563
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,945
Why are you?

564
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,617
I think it's time
we find out what
we're really up against.

565
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,747
All right.

566
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:57,124
But you're not going
back out there alone.

567
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,626
Meet me in the woods
in half-an-hour.

568
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,110
Will this be enough?

569
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:28,989
Okay.

570
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,659
Let's go.

571
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,468
Come on!

572
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,534
That's disgusting.

573
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,370
There's something
in there.

574
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,290
You mean, besides
a Griever pancake?

575
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,967
Whoa, what are
you doing?

576
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,397
Whoa!

577
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:47,026
I thought you
said it was dead.

578
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,611
Was it a reflex?

579
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,862
You hope.

580
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,158
Okay, come on.
Let's try and
pull it out.

581
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,535
Everyone get
a hand on it.
Come on.

582
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,412
All right, ready?
On three.

583
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:00,372
One, two, three!

584
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,634
Are you okay, Fry?
Yeah. Thanks, brother.

585
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,212
What the hell is that?

586
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:58,556
Interesting.

587
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,099
Okay, whatever itis...

588
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,142
can we take this up
back at the Glade?

589
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,853
Because I don't
want to meet
this guy's friends.

590
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,522
He's right.

591
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:09,358
It's getting late.
Come on.

592
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:21,787
We found this.

593
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,873
It was inside a Griever.

594
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,626
These are the same letters
we get in our supplies.
Yeah.

595
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:31,171
Whoever put us
here obviously
made the Grievers.

596
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,756
This is the
first real clue,

597
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,508
the first anything,
you've found in
over 3 years.

598
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:35,884
Right, Minho?

599
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,177
Right.

600
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:40,097
Newt, we gotta
go back out there.

601
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,142
Who knows where
this might lead us.

602
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,521
You see what he's
trying to do, right?

603
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:49,690
First he breaks
our rules...

604
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:52,484
and then he
tries to convince us
to abandon them totally.

605
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:55,321
The rules are the only
thing that have ever
held us together.

606
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,906
Why now are we
questioning that?

607
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,659
If Alby was here,
you know he'd
agree with me.

608
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,996
This shank needs
to be punished.

609
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,047
You're right.

610
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,923
Thomas broke the rules.

611
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,842
One night in the pit,
and no food.

612
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:19,720
Come on, Newt!
One night in the pit?

613
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:22,181
Do you think
that's gonna stop him
from going into the maze?

614
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:23,515
No.

615
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,225
And we can't just
have non-runners

616
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,311
running into the maze
whenever they feel like it.

617
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,689
So let's just
make this official.

618
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,233
Starting from tomorrow,
you're a runner.

619
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,406
Wow.

620
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,617
Gally...
No, Fry.

621
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,668
Thanks, Newt.

622
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,812
Hey, where
are we going?

623
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,022
You'll see.

624
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,009
It's the maze.

625
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,637
All of it.

626
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,892
What do you mean "all of it"?
I thought you were
still mapping it.

627
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,812
There's nothing
left to map.

628
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:55,274
I've run every
inch of it myself.

629
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,776
Every cycle.

630
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,403
Every pattern.

631
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:02,573
If there was
a way out,

632
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,491
we would have
found it by now.

633
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:08,787
Why haven't you
told anyone this?

634
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,958
It was Alby's call.

635
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:16,003
People needed to
believe we had a chance
of getting out.

636
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,006
But maybe now...

637
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,759
we have a real chance.

638
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,515
Take a look at this.

639
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,394
About a year ago,
we started exploring
these outer sections.

640
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,606
We found these numbers
printed on the walls.

641
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:38,317
Sections 1 through 8.

642
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:39,777
See, the way it works,

643
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,279
is every night,
when the maze changes...

644
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:44,323
it opens up
a new section.

645
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,909
So today,
Section 6 was open.

646
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:50,746
Tomorrow, it will be 4,
then 8, then 3.

647
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:53,248
The pattern
always stays the same.

648
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,462
What's so
special about 77?

649
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,088
I don't know.

650
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,050
But last night,
when you killed
that Griever...

651
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,677
Section 7 was open.

652
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,347
I think it must be
where it comes from.

653
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:10,224
Tomorrow,
you and I are gonna
take a closer look.

654
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,477
Hey!

655
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:15,687
What are you guys doing?
You're not allowed in here.

656
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,147
Sorry, it's just
the, uh...

657
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,440
It's the girl.

658
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:20,067
Is she awake?

659
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,568
You could
say that.

660
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,238
Chuck,
what's going on?

661
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:27,074
Girls are awesome.

662
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,408
Leave me alone!

663
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,494
Watch your head!

664
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,163
Hey, throw one more
of those things-- Ow!

665
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,748
Go away!
We come in peace!

666
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:35,916
What happened?
Just duck!

667
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,501
I don't think she
likes us very much.

668
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,419
What do you
want from me?
We just wanna talk.

669
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,754
I'm warning you!

670
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,464
Take cover, y'all!
Take cover!

671
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,926
Hey, it's Thomas!
It's Thomas!

672
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,768
I'm gonna
come up, okay?

673
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,481
Okay.

674
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,109
Just me.

675
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,656
I'm coming up.

676
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,496
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

677
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,623
Okay, just...

678
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,166
Easy, all right?

679
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,460
Where am 1?

680
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,462
What is this place?

681
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,964
Why can't
I remember
anything?

682
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:26,884
This is all normal. Okay?
We've all been through this.

683
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,176
Okay?

684
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,305
Your name will
come back to you
in a couple of days.

685
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,307
It's the one
thing that...
Teresa.

686
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:35,809
What did you say?

687
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:37,144
My name.

688
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,813
It's Teresa.

689
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,233
Teresa, I'm Thomas.

690
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:49,197
But you already knew that,
though, I guess, huh?

691
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,327
They said I kept saying
your name in my sleep.

692
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,661
Who are you?

693
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,542
I don't know.

694
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,088
I can't remember.

695
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,258
None of us here can
remember anything.

696
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,678
We all woke up here
just like you did.

697
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,514
Hey, I promise...

698
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,436
I'm gonna take this.

699
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:23,523
Okay.

700
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,526
What's going on up there?

701
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,865
Is she coming down?

702
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:33,700
Um...

703
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,210
Hey, listen, you guys just
give us a second, okay?

704
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,630
All right.

705
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,298
Come on.

706
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,884
Is this what all
girls are like?

707
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,972
That girl is crazy.

708
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,604
"She's the last one."
What does that mean?

709
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,398
I'm not sure.

710
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,025
Ever since
you came up,

711
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,777
that Box hasn't
gone back down.

712
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:13,323
I just think
it's got everyone
a little worried.

713
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,119
Especially Gally.

714
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,582
He thinks
it's my fault.

715
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,256
Are you sure you don't
remember anything else?

716
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,010
I remember water...

717
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,679
feeling like
I was drowning.

718
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,933
These faces
staring at me.

719
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:46,440
And this woman's voice
saying the same
thing over and over.

720
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,816
"Wicked is good."

721
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:54,823
Ever since I've been here,
I've had these dreams.

722
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:57,117
Well, I thought
they were dreams.

723
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:01,163
You...

724
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,291
You were there.

725
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:07,878
You were there...

726
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:11,006
and you told me
that everything
was gonna change.

727
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,969
What does it mean?

728
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:21,141
I don't know.
I just always get pieces.

729
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,478
And the others don't
remember anything?

730
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,645
No.

731
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,317
Why are we different?

732
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,160
These were in my
pocket when I came up.

733
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,674
"Wicked is good."

734
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:58,887
What if we were
sent here for a reason?

735
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:03,975
Alby.

736
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:07,145
We don't even
know what this stuff is.

737
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:08,855
We don't know
who sent it.

738
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,690
Or why it came
up here with you.

739
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,819
For all we know,
this thing
could kill him.

740
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,487
He's already dying.

741
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:17,531
Look at him.

742
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:21,368
How could
this possibly make
it any worse?

743
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:24,871
Come on,
it's worth a try.

744
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,709
All right.

745
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:31,711
Do it.

746
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,180
Okay.

747
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,226
You shouldn't be here!
You shouldn't be here!

748
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:47,435
No!

749
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,354
Watch out!

750
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,733
Get the syringe! Let go!

751
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,245
Well, that worked.

752
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:06,997
Okay, from now on...

753
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:10,250
someone stays here
and watches him
around the clock.

754
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,089
Hey.

755
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,845
Sundown, Greenie.
Time to go.

756
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:39,905
Hey, what is your
problem with me?

757
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:43,408
Everything started
going wrong the minute
you showed up.

758
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,286
First Ben, then Alby...

759
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,413
and now the girl.

760
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,042
Everybody saw
she recognized you.

761
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,630
And I'm betting
you know who she is.

762
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,104
Gally...

763
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,777
you know we can't
stay here forever,
right?

764
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:40,298
Who's there?

765
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,550
It's just me.

766
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,678
Sorry, Chuck.

767
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,137
Here.

768
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,473
You'll run better
on a full stomach.

769
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,068
Mmm...

770
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:02,445
Thanks, Chuck.

771
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:09,327
Hey, what do
you got there?

772
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:18,044
Wow, that came out
pretty damn good.

773
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:19,546
What's that for?

774
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:23,008
It's for my parents.

775
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:25,760
You remember
your parents?

776
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,013
No.

777
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:31,016
I mean, I know
I must have them.

778
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:35,020
And wherever they are,
I'm sure they miss me...

779
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:38,565
but I can't miss
them because I don't
remember them.

780
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:47,407
What do you think
you're gonna find
out there tomorrow?

781
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,244
Uh, I don't know.

782
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,206
But if there's
a way out, Chuck,

783
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:57,083
me and Minho
are gonna find it.

784
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:04,591
Here.

785
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:12,432
Chuck, why would
you give this to me?

786
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,936
I can't remember
them anyway.

787
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,231
But maybe if you
find a way out,

788
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:21,941
you can give it
to them for me.

789
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:26,404
I'll let you
get some sleep.

790
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,332
Hey, Chuck.

791
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:39,125
Come here.

792
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,173
Put out your hand.

793
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,469
I want you to give
that to them yourself.

794
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:52,972
We're gonna
get out of here.

795
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,474
All of us.

796
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:56,810
Okay?

797
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:58,978
I promise.

798
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:02,816
Yeah.
All right.

799
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,528
Good night.
Good night, buddy.

800
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,461
Big day, Greenie.

801
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:25,130
Are you sure
you don't wanna
sit this one out?

802
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,341
Come on, man.
Get me out of here.
All right.

803
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:47,944
Let's go!

804
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,875
This way.
Not much further to
the inner ring.

805
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,376
Let's go!

806
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,797
Come on! This way.

807
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,742
That's strange.

808
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:36,868
What?

809
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:39,245
Seven is not
supposed to be open
for another week.

810
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:49,380
What the
hell is this place?

811
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,174
We call them blades.

812
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,153
It's Ben's, isn't it?

813
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,738
Yeah.

814
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,116
A Griever must have
pulled him down here.

815
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,458
Whoa, hey!

816
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,357
I think it's
showing us the way.

817
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,575
Wait, wait, wait.
What, what?

818
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,704
This way. Come on.

819
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:29,022
Minho, you ever see
this place before?

820
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:31,858
No.

821
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:55,381
It's just another
dead end.

822
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,494
Are you sure
about this?

823
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,290
Nope.

824
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:04,784
Grievers.

825
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,297
What the
hell was that?

826
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,805
We gotta
get out of here.

827
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,807
Give me the key,
give me the key!

828
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:34,731
Move, move!

829
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:43,156
We gotta go!
Run, Thomas!

830
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:44,949
We're gonna
get trapped!

831
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:46,325
Go! Go!

832
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:51,956
Go, go, go!

833
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:53,124
Move!

834
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:04,177
Minho!

835
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:05,845
Come on!
Let's go, let's go!

836
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:11,809
Come on, move!

837
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,978
Keep going!
Keep going! Let's go!

838
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:15,646
Whoa!

839
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,356
Go, go, go!

840
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:23,821
Oh!

841
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:33,748
Go, go, go!

842
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:40,630
Whoa!

843
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,341
Come on!
Don't look back!

844
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,472
Come on!

845
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:53,726
Oh, shit!

846
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:56,395
There!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

847
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,412
Oh!

848
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,459
What the hell's
going on out there?

849
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:19,877
What the hell you
done now, Thomas?

850
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,504
We found something,
a new passage.

851
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:22,797
We think it
could be a way out.

852
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:24,715
Really?
It's true.

853
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:27,301
We opened a door,
something I'd
never seen before.

854
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,095
I think it must be
where the Grievers
go during the day.

855
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:30,429
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

856
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,765
You're saying you found
the Grievers' home?

857
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:34,100
And you want
us togoin?

858
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:35,768
Their way in could
be our way out, Chuck.

859
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:38,271
Yeah, or there could
be a dozen Grievers
on the other side.

860
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:41,649
The truth is,
Thomas doesn't know
what he has done, as usual.

861
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:43,526
Yeah, at least
I did something,
Gally.

862
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:44,777
I mean, what
have you done?

863
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:46,946
Aside from hide
behind these walls
all the time?

864
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,406
Let me tell you
something, Greenie.

865
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:51,158
You've been here
3 days, all right?
I've been here 3 years!

866
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:53,494
Yeah, you've been
here 3 years and you're
still here, Gally!

867
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:54,745
What does
that tell you?

868
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,414
Maybe you should
start doing things
a little differently.

869
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,624
Maybe you should
be in charge,
what about that?

870
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,626
Hey, it's Alby!

871
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:03,129
He's awake.

872
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:05,464
Has he said anything?

873
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:06,799
No.

874
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:09,969
Alby--

875
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:15,182
Alby, are you all right?

876
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,566
Hey, Alby.

877
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,946
Alby, we might
have just found a way
out of the maze.

878
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:32,909
Do you hear me?
We could be
getting out of here.

879
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,871
We can't.

880
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,291
We can't leave.

881
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,502
They won't let us.

882
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:45,087
What are you
talking about?

883
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,340
I remember.

884
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:53,429
What do
you remember?

885
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,599
You.

886
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:03,064
You were always
their favorite, Thomas.

887
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,107
Always.

888
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:10,571
Why did you do this?

889
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:14,116
Why did you come here?

890
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:25,711
Winston,
what's going on?

891
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,964
It's the doors.
They aren't closing.

892
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,310
Chuck, go to
the Council Hall

893
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,021
and start barricading
the doors.
Mmm-hmm.

894
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:26,939
Winston,
you go with him.
Got it.

895
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:29,525
Get the others.
Tell them to go to the forest.
Go hide, now!

896
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:32,069
Minho, I want you to grab
every weapon you can find.

897
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:34,363
I'll meet you
at Council Hall.
Let's go.

898
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:39,035
Teresa, you and I
are gonna go get Alby,
all right? Come on.

899
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,377
All right, everybody hide!

900
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:49,754
Teresa!

901
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,923
Come on! Run! Run!

902
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,183
Stay down!

903
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,684
Run!

904
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:18,991
Ahh!
Zart!

905
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:26,123
Help me!
Go! Get to the village!

906
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:34,590
Go, go, go!

907
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:42,765
Stay down,
stay down!

908
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:45,726
Gally! Let me in,
let me in!

909
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:54,193
Alby!
Are you okay?

910
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,361
What's going on?

911
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:58,072
They're here.
Grievers?

912
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:05,996
Thomas,
what do we do?

913
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:08,541
It's got me!

914
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:14,630
Everybody, run, run, run!

915
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,215
Jeff, come on, go, go, go!

916
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:33,774
Everyone,
go, go, go!

917
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:53,169
Keep moving!
Oh, shit!

918
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:54,461
Ahh!

919
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:55,921
Alby!

920
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:57,548
Get behind me!

921
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,386
Come on!

922
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:06,724
Over here, let's go!

923
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:09,476
Over here!
Let's go! Come on!

924
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:12,980
Over here, come on!

925
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:14,523
Winston!

926
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:15,858
Get Alby inside.

927
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,360
Chuck, get in! Go, go, go!

928
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:22,198
Lock down the doors!

929
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,174
Careful.

930
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:41,634
Whoa!

931
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:43,969
Stay back, guys.

932
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:11,413
Is everyone all right?

933
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:14,250
Help!

934
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,168
Hey, grab hi
on y, grab him!

935
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,381
Watch out!

936
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:28,055
Chuck!

937
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,351
Chuck, no!
Grab him!

938
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:33,602
Pull him back!

939
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,605
Help!
Chuck, don't let go!

940
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,357
No shit!

941
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,401
Pull!
Don't let him go!

942
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,048
Chuck, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

943
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:06,760
Thanks, Alby.

944
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,680
Alby! Watch out!

945
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:12,933
Grab him!

946
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,731
Thomas, get them out.

947
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:21,942
Alby!

948
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:24,737
No!
Thomas--

949
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,447
Thomas!
Don't go out there!

950
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:27,656
No, Thomas, wait!

951
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,450
Thomas, wait!

952
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,293
Where is everybody?

953
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,170
Who's that over there?

954
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:50,137
Gally--

955
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:53,640
This is all you, Thomas!
Look around!

956
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:55,434
Back off, Gally!
It's not Thomas' fault!

957
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:56,518
You heard
what Alby said!

958
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:57,853
He's one of them!
One of who?

959
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,897
He's one of them,
and they sent him here

960
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,857
to destroy everything,
and now he has!

961
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,777
Look around, Thomas!
Look around!

962
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:05,944
This is your fault!

963
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:07,780
Back off, Gally!
This is not Thomas' fault!

964
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:10,657
What are you
talking about?
Calm down.

965
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,535
They sent him here,

966
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:14,870
and now he's destroyed
everything that we've built!

967
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:16,455
What are you
talking about?

968
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:20,125
Maybe he's right.

969
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,044
Thomas--

970
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,547
I need
to remember, Teresa.

971
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,466
Thomas--

972
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:29,676
Thomas!
No, don't!

973
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,346
Thomas!

974
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:33,806
Chuck, get
the other syringe!

975
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:36,475
It's okay.

976
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:38,352
Thomas, I'm here.

977
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:50,489
Who put us here?

978
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:53,534
That we don't know.

979
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:00,040
Teresa...

980
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:01,917
why are we doing this?

981
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,005
Excellent, Thomas.

982
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:08,215
Come with me.

983
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,760
Wicked isn't good.
Thomas...

984
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:13,429
Wicked is good.

985
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:15,764
How could
this be my fault?

986
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:17,015
You did this!

987
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:18,851
I saw you!

988
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:23,021
I can't keep
watching them die.

989
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:30,529
Hey.

990
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:33,532
Are you okay?

991
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,703
What the hell
were you thinking?

992
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:44,543
What happened?

993
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:46,712
Gally
has taken control.

994
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:50,757
He said we had a choice.
Either join him...

995
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:53,594
or get banished
at sundown with you.

996
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:57,222
And the others
agreed to that?

997
01:22:58,265 --> 01:22:59,933
Gally has everyone
convinced that

998
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:02,102
you're the reason
all this has happened.

999
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:07,232
Well, he's been
right so far.

1000
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,402
What are you
talking about?

1001
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,071
This place...

1002
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:16,241
it's not what
we thought it was.

1003
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,245
It's not a prison,
it's a test.

1004
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:23,081
It all started
when we were kids.

1005
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:26,960
They would give us
these challenges.

1006
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:30,130
They were experimenting
on us.

1007
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:34,301
And then people
started disappearing.

1008
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:37,262
Every month,
one after the other,
like clockwork.

1009
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:39,515
They were sending
them up into the maze.

1010
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,351
Yeah, but not all of us.

1011
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:44,686
What do you mean?

1012
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,608
Guys, I'm one of them.

1013
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:54,655
The people
who put you here,
I worked with them.

1014
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:59,201
I watched
you guys for years.

1015
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:02,454
The entire time
you have been here...

1016
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,623
I was on the other
side of it.

1017
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:08,794
So were you.

1018
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:11,838
What?

1019
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,801
Teresa, we did this
to them.

1020
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,012
No.

1021
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:21,807
That can't be true.

1022
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:25,394
ltis. I saw it.

1023
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:29,314
Why would they send us
up if we were with them?

1024
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,483
It doesn't matter.

1025
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:34,319
He's right.

1026
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:38,657
It doesn't matter.

1027
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,159
Any of it.

1028
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:46,331
Because the people
we were before the maze
don't even exist anymore.

1029
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:48,542
These Creators
took care of that.

1030
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:53,380
But what does matter
is who we are now,
and what we do...

1031
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:55,215
right now.

1032
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,885
You went into the maze
and you found a way out.

1033
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:02,347
Yeah, but if I hadn't,
Alby would still be alive.

1034
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,227
Maybe.

1035
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:12,357
But I know that
if he were here,

1036
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:15,736
he would be telling you
the exact same thing.

1037
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:20,115
Pick your ass up
and finish what you started.

1038
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:23,577
Because if we do nothing...

1039
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:26,872
then that means
Alby died for nothing,
and I can't have that.

1040
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:32,919
Okay.

1041
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:38,008
Okay, but we gotta
get through Gally first.

1042
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:08,997
This is such a waste.

1043
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:15,962
Gally...

1044
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:22,761
It doesn't feel
right, man.

1045
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:26,348
Yeah, what if
Thomas is right?

1046
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,267
Maybe he can
lead us home.

1047
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:33,480
We are home.

1048
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:35,774
Okay?

1049
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:39,986
I don't wanna
have to cross any more
names off that wall.

1050
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:41,488
You really think
banishing us

1051
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:43,824
is gonna solve
anything?

1052
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:45,951
No.

1053
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:49,121
But this isn't
a banishing.

1054
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,123
It's an offering.

1055
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,125
What? Wait!

1056
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,252
Gally, what are you doing?

1057
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:57,212
You really think
I'm gonna let Thomas

1058
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:59,089
back into the maze
after what he has done?

1059
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:02,509
Look around you!

1060
01:27:03,802 --> 01:27:04,928
Look at our Glade!

1061
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:09,474
This is the only way.

1062
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:12,936
And when the Grievers get
what they came here for...

1063
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,647
everything goes back
to the way it was.

1064
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:17,023
Are you listening
to this?

1065
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:19,693
Why are you all
just standing there?
He's crazy!

1066
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:21,737
You shut up.
If you stay here,

1067
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:23,029
the Grievers are
going to come back.

1068
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,157
They're gonna come back,
and they're gonna
keep coming back...

1069
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:26,491
until you're all dead!

1070
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:28,493
Shut up! Tie him up!

1071
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,164
Do you hear me?
I said tie him up!

1072
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:58,815
You're full of surprises,
aren't you?

1073
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:02,194
You don't have
to come with us,
but we are leaving.

1074
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,654
Anyone else who
wants to come,
now is your last chance.

1075
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:06,364
Don't listen to him,
he's just trying
to scare you.

1076
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:08,909
No, I'm not trying
to scare you.
You're already scared.

1077
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:11,036
I'm scared.

1078
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:14,956
But I'd rather risk
my life out there

1079
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,708
than spending the rest
of it in here.

1080
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:21,087
We don't belong here.

1081
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:24,424
This place isn't our home.

1082
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:27,052
We were put here.

1083
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:29,012
We were trapped here.

1084
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:33,016
At least, out there
we have a choice.

1085
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:37,270
We can make it
out of here.

1086
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:39,564
I know that.

1087
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,454
I'm sorry.

1088
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:10,595
Gally, it's over.

1089
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:15,767
Just come with us.

1090
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:25,735
Good luck against
the Grievers.

1091
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:46,006
Everybody,
this way!

1092
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:02,022
Keep it up, guys,
we're almost there!

1093
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:19,039
Is it a Griever?
Yeah.

1094
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:21,291
Shit.

1095
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:24,210
You take this, Chuck.
Stay behind us.

1096
01:30:26,296 --> 01:30:28,882
It's okay.
Just stick
with me.

1097
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:31,468
Once we're through,
it will activate

1098
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:32,844
and the door will open.

1099
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:35,138
We stay close,
we stick together...

1100
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:37,557
we get through this.
We get out now...

1101
01:30:37,724 --> 01:30:39,809
or we die trying.

1102
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:41,895
Ready?

1103
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:45,357
All right. Let's go!

1104
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:02,374
Get up, look out!

1105
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:06,378
Push it!

1106
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:12,884
Look out!

1107
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:23,144
The key!

1108
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:25,563
Chuck! Watch the edge!

1109
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:33,446
Oh, no.

1110
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:36,825
I got you, Chuck!
Pull me up!

1111
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:48,670
Come on!

1112
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:51,589
Thomas! Thomas!

1113
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:53,174
Chuck?

1114
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:54,676
We got more coming!

1115
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,263
Keep it steady, guys!

1116
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:01,599
It works!

1117
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:04,769
Teresa, go!

1118
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:10,942
Don't back down!
Keep pushing!
Stay together!

1119
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:17,449
There's gotta be
a way out! Come on!

1120
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,124
Watch it!

1121
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:33,465
It won't open!

1122
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,095
Thomas!
There's a code!

1123
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:40,305
Eight numbers!

1124
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:44,100
Eight sections
of the maze.

1125
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:47,228
Hey, Minho!
What's the sequence?
What?

1126
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:49,147
The sections of the maze,
what's the sequence?

1127
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,983
Seven! One!

1128
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:54,152
Five! Two!

1129
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:56,154
Six! Four!
Heads up!

1130
01:32:58,823 --> 01:32:59,908
Minho!

1131
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:00,992
Minho!
Oh!

1132
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:04,746
Get off of me!

1133
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:15,799
Jeff!

1134
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:19,761
What's the sequence?
Come on!

1135
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:22,639
Six! Four! Eight!

1136
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:24,349
Three! You got it?

1137
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:27,519
Keep holding!

1138
01:33:27,811 --> 01:33:28,937
Almost there, come on!

1139
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:31,106
The door opened!

1140
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:40,031
Oh!

1141
01:33:43,031 --> 01:34:13,031
<b>YAWNTiC Encode 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

1142
01:34:58,109 --> 01:34:59,485
Seriously?

1143
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:44,697
What happened here?

1144
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:20,525
So they were watching us.

1145
01:36:21,734 --> 01:36:23,361
This whole time.

1146
01:36:49,095 --> 01:36:50,555
Hello.

1147
01:36:50,722 --> 01:36:52,890
My name is
Doctor Ava Paige.

1148
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:54,809
I'm Director
of Operations

1149
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:58,271
of the World Catastrophe
Killzone Department.

1150
01:36:58,438 --> 01:36:59,856
If you're watching this,
that means

1151
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:02,900
you have successfully
completed the Maze Trials.

1152
01:37:03,401 --> 01:37:06,529
I wish I could
be there in person
to congratulate you...

1153
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:12,076
but circumstances seem
to have prevented it.

1154
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:14,746
I'm sure by now,
you must all be
very confused...

1155
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:16,622
angry...

1156
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:18,291
frightened.

1157
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:21,586
I can only assure you,
that everything
that's happened to you...

1158
01:37:22,587 --> 01:37:25,048
everything we've done
to you...

1159
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:27,258
it was all done
for a reason.

1160
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:29,635
You won't remember...

1161
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:32,555
but the Sun has
scorched our world.

1162
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:36,893
Billions of lives
lost to fire...

1163
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:38,770
famine...

1164
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:42,231
suffering
on a global scale.

1165
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:45,401
The fallout
was unimaginable.

1166
01:37:46,152 --> 01:37:48,780
What came after was worse.

1167
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:51,115
We called it the Flare.

1168
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:55,703
A deadly virus that
attacks the brain.

1169
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,705
It is violent...

1170
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,415
unpredictable...

1171
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:02,126
incurable.

1172
01:38:03,419 --> 01:38:04,962
Or so we thought.

1173
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:09,008
In time, a new
generation emerged

1174
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:10,885
that could survive
the virus.

1175
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:14,555
Suddenly, there was
a reason to hope
for a cure.

1176
01:38:15,932 --> 01:38:18,476
But finding it
would not be easy.

1177
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:21,771
The young would
have to be tested,
even sacrificed...

1178
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:24,273
inside harsh environments...

1179
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,484
where their brain activity
could be studied.

1180
01:38:27,402 --> 01:38:28,945
All in an effort
to understand...

1181
01:38:29,112 --> 01:38:31,280
what makes them different...

1182
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:35,326
what makes you different.

1183
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:38,579
You may not realize it...

1184
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:41,124
but you're very important.

1185
01:38:41,499 --> 01:38:44,335
Unfortunately, your trials
have only just begun.

1186
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:46,504
As you will no doubt
soon discover,

1187
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:48,673
not everyone agrees
with our methods.

1188
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:52,009
Progress is slow,
people are scared.

1189
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:54,762
It may be too late for us...

1190
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:56,681
for me...

1191
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:58,182
but not for you.

1192
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,935
The outside world awaits.

1193
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:02,937
Remember...

1194
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:07,817
Wicked is good.

1195
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:45,062
Is it over?

1196
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:48,858
She said we were
important.

1197
01:39:50,568 --> 01:39:52,528
What are we
supposed
to do now?

1198
01:40:01,162 --> 01:40:02,747
I don't know.

1199
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:09,921
Let's get out of here.

1200
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:13,591
No.

1201
01:40:18,346 --> 01:40:19,931
Gally?
Don't.

1202
01:40:21,057 --> 01:40:22,850
He's been stung.

1203
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:31,776
We can't leave.

1204
01:40:35,738 --> 01:40:37,782
We did.
Gally, we're out.

1205
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:40,201
We're free.

1206
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:43,704
Free?

1207
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:49,210
You think we're
free out there?

1208
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:51,629
No.

1209
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:56,092
No, there's no escape
from this place.

1210
01:41:01,264 --> 01:41:02,723
Gally, listen to me.

1211
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,142
You're not
thinking straight.

1212
01:41:05,768 --> 01:41:06,936
You're not.

1213
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:09,814
Now, we can help you.

1214
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:13,317
Just put down the gun.

1215
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:15,820
I belong to the maze.

1216
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:17,738
Just put down
the gun.

1217
01:41:20,783 --> 01:41:22,159
We all do.

1218
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:44,307
Thomas...

1219
01:41:46,183 --> 01:41:47,602
Chuck.

1220
01:41:52,273 --> 01:41:54,108
Oh, shit. Shit.

1221
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:56,527
Look at me,
look at me!

1222
01:41:57,862 --> 01:41:58,863
Oh, shit!

1223
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:00,531
Chuck,
look at me, all right?

1224
01:42:00,823 --> 01:42:02,199
I got you, buddy.
Just hang on.

1225
01:42:02,783 --> 01:42:04,201
It's okay.

1226
01:42:04,535 --> 01:42:06,037
Thomas, Thomas...

1227
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,502
No, Chuck.
You're gonna give
it to them yourself.

1228
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:14,670
Remember,
I told you that.

1229
01:42:14,795 --> 01:42:16,047
Take it.

1230
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:17,840
No.

1231
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:21,385
Thank you.

1232
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:26,557
Thank you.

1233
01:42:26,891 --> 01:42:28,017
No, Chuck,
you're gonna get--

1234
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:33,731
Chuck.

1235
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:38,069
Chuck? Hey.

1236
01:42:39,987 --> 01:42:41,739
Hey, Chuck, come on!

1237
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:44,283
Come on, wake up!

1238
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:53,084
Damn it!

1239
01:42:56,045 --> 01:42:57,963
We made it.
Come on.

1240
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:04,679
I'm sorry!

1241
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:07,223
God damn it!

1242
01:43:08,766 --> 01:43:10,601
Damn it!

1243
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:17,775
Thomas.
Chuck!

1244
01:43:21,487 --> 01:43:23,698
Get up, Chuck! Come on!

1245
01:43:36,836 --> 01:43:37,920
Chuck!

1246
01:43:39,505 --> 01:43:41,424
You can't just
leave him there!

1247
01:44:19,295 --> 01:44:20,504
You guys all right?

1248
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:22,381
Don't worry.

1249
01:44:22,548 --> 01:44:23,924
You're safe now.

1250
01:45:00,503 --> 01:45:02,087
Relax, kid.

1251
01:45:03,464 --> 01:45:05,800
Everything is gonna change.

1252
01:45:20,648 --> 01:45:23,901
I think it's safe to say
the Maze Trials were
a complete success.

1253
01:45:25,611 --> 01:45:27,947
I wasn't expecting
SO many survivors, but...

1254
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:30,241
the more the merrier.

1255
01:45:34,703 --> 01:45:38,415
Thomas continues to
surprise and impress.

1256
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:43,504
And for now, they seem
