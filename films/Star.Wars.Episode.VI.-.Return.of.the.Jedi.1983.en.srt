1
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:31,348
Command station, this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.

2
00:02:31,478 --> 00:02:34,395
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.

3
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,229
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...

4
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,647
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.

5
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:40,940
Stand by.

6
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:44,320
You are clear to proceed.

7
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:46,738
We're starting our approach.

8
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:16,852
Inform the commander
that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

9
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:18,060
Sir.

10
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,935
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected
pleasure. We're honoured.

11
00:03:58,062 --> 00:04:00,351
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.

12
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:02,973
I'm here to put you back on schedule.

13
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,145
I assure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.

14
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:09,694
Perhaps I can find
new ways to motivate them.

15
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:13,987
I tell you this station
will be operational as planned.

16
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:20,077
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

17
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,412
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

18
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:26,665
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.

19
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:31,425
- The emperor's coming here?
- That is correct, Commander...

20
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:36,298
<i>and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress.</i>

21
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,892
We shall double our efforts.

22
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:42,305
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

23
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,307
The emperor is not
as forgiving as I am.

24
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:06,707
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be too.

25
00:05:06,838 --> 00:05:10,622
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

26
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:15,045
Don't be so sure.

27
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,465
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...

28
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:20,473
<i>you'd probably short-circuit.</i>

29
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:35,028
R2, are you sure
this is the right place?

30
00:05:40,162 --> 00:05:42,285
I'd better knock, I suppose.

31
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:48,038
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

32
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:53,541
Goodness gracious me!

33
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:19,190
I don't think
they're going to let us in, R2.

34
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:22,945
We'd better go.

35
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,629
R2, wait.

36
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,507
Oh, dear. R2.

37
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:40,921
R2, I really don't think
we should rush into all this.

38
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:44,013
Oh, R2!

39
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:45,720
R2, wait for me!

40
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,435
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here.

41
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:58,528
Oh, my!

42
00:07:02,492 --> 00:07:03,607
Oh, no.

43
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:10,166
Oh, my.

44
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:18,007
We bring a message
to your master,Jabba the Hutt.

45
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,926
And a gift.

46
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:25,384
What gift?

47
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:47,113
He says that our instructions
are to give it only to Jabba himself.

48
00:07:57,005 --> 00:08:00,706
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.

49
00:08:03,135 --> 00:08:06,551
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.

50
00:08:41,382 --> 00:08:43,209
Good morning.

51
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:50,720
The message, R2.
The message.

52
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,441
<i>Greetings, Exalted One.</i>

53
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:04,857
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.</i>

54
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:08,855
<i>I am Luke Skywalker,
Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.</i>

55
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:12,329
<i>I know that you are powerful,
mighty Jabba...</i>

56
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:16,118
<i>and that your anger with Solo
must be equally powerful.</i>

57
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:20,033
<i>I seek an audience with Your Greatness
to bargain for Solo's life.</i>

58
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,461
<i>With your wisdom, I'm sure
we can work out an arrangement...</i>

59
00:09:26,593 --> 00:09:28,301
<i>which will be mutually beneficial...</i>

60
00:09:28,428 --> 00:09:31,096
<i>and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation.</i>

61
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,390
<i>As a token of my goodwill,
I present to you a gift-</i>

62
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,262
<i>these two droids.</i>

63
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:40,269
What did he say?

64
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:43,933
<i>Both are hard-working
and will serve you well.</i>

65
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:47,816
This can't be.
R2, you're playing the wrong message.

66
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:56,203
He's no Jedi.

67
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:02,664
There will be no bargain.

68
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:05,001
We're doomed.

69
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:12,093
I will not give up
my favourite decoration.

70
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:17,012
I like Captain Solo where he is.

71
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:20,803
R2, look. Captain Solo.

72
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:23,475
And he's still frozen in carbonite.

73
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:39,075
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?

74
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:44,073
Was it something I did? He never
expressed any unhappiness with my work.

75
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:46,752
How horrid!

76
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:17,987
Good. New acquisitions.

77
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:20,739
You are a protocol droid,
are you not?

78
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:22,780
I am C-3PO-

79
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,658
Yes or no will do.

80
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:26,286
Well, yes.

81
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:28,908
How many languages do you speak?

82
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:32,663
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily-

83
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,421
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...

84
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:38,886
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...

85
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:40,805
and disintegrated him.

86
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,510
Disintegrated?

87
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,229
Guard, this protocol droid
might be useful.

88
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:53,518
Fit him with a restraining bolt...

89
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:56,987
and take him back up to
His Excellency's main audience chamber.

90
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:59,570
R2, don't leave me!

91
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:06,865
You're a feisty little one...

92
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:09,455
but you'll soon learn some respect.

93
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:12,871
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...

94
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:15,710
and I think you'll fill in nicely.

95
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:47,696
Ah! Do that again!

96
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:45,278
I have come for the bounty
on this Wookiee.

97
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:47,650
Oh, no. Chewbacca.

98
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:55,953
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

99
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:04,541
Yes, I am here,
Your Worshipfulness.

100
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:06,997
Yes?

101
00:15:16,268 --> 00:15:18,225
The illustrious Jabba
bids you welcome...

102
00:15:18,353 --> 00:15:20,927
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.

103
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:24,022
I want 50,000. No less.

104
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:26,810
"50,000. No less. "

105
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,452
What did I say?

106
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:50,462
The mighty Jabba asks why
he must pay 50,000.

107
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:56,755
Because he's holding
a thermal detonator.

108
00:16:08,111 --> 00:16:12,606
This bounty hunter
is my kind of scum...

109
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:16,361
fearless and inventive.

110
00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:28,629
Jabba offers the sum of 35...

111
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,914
and I do suggest you take it.

112
00:16:36,472 --> 00:16:38,096
He agrees!

113
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:30,672
Just relax for a moment.

114
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:33,430
You're free of the carbonite.

115
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:38,973
You have hibernation sickness.

116
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:43,569
- I can't see.
- Your eyesight will return in time.

117
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:46,982
- Where am I?
- Jabba's palace.

118
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:51,911
Who are you?

119
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:59,373
- Someone who loves you.
- Leia.

120
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:04,875
I gotta get you out of here.

121
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:09,338
What's that?

122
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:13,973
I know that laugh.

123
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:21,221
Hey,Jabba.

124
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,193
Look,Jabba, I was just
on my way to pay you back.

125
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,190
I got a little sidetracked.
It's not my fault.

126
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:31,023
It's too late for that, Solo.

127
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,869
You may have been a good smuggler...

128
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:39,449
but now you're Bantha fodder.

129
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:45,080
Look-

130
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:48,423
Take him away.

131
00:20:48,552 --> 00:20:50,296
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.

132
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:52,919
You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool.

133
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,009
Bring her to me.

134
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:04,105
We have powerful friends.

135
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:06,475
You're gonna regret this.

136
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:10,236
I'm sure.

137
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:16,112
I can't bear to watch.

138
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:32,177
Chewie?

139
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:35,928
Chewie, is that you?

140
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:40,465
Wait a minute.
I can't see, pal.

141
00:21:41,562 --> 00:21:43,471
What's going on?

142
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:47,603
Luke? Luke's crazy.

143
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:51,269
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.

144
00:21:53,156 --> 00:21:55,030
AJedi knight?

145
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:59,693
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

146
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,041
I'm all right, pal.

147
00:22:06,836 --> 00:22:08,461
I'm all right.

148
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,426
I must speak with Jabba.

149
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,599
No bargain.

150
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:14,189
You will take me to Jabba now.

151
00:23:18,657 --> 00:23:20,448
You serve your master well.

152
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,320
And you will be rewarded.

153
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:36,463
At last! Master Luke's
come to rescue me.

154
00:23:36,591 --> 00:23:38,002
Master.

155
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:43,179
Luke Skywalker,Jedi knight.

156
00:23:43,306 --> 00:23:47,553
I told you not to admit him.

157
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:49,476
I must be allowed to speak.

158
00:23:49,604 --> 00:23:52,355
He must be allowed to speak.

159
00:23:53,191 --> 00:23:56,145
You weak-minded fool!

160
00:23:58,196 --> 00:24:02,525
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

161
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:06,109
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

162
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:17,245
Your mind powers
will not work on me, boy.

163
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:19,539
Nevertheless...

164
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:22,629
I'm taking Captain Solo
and his friends.

165
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:26,593
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.

166
00:24:26,724 --> 00:24:29,678
It's your choice, but I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.

167
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,013
Master Luke, you're standing on-

168
00:24:34,147 --> 00:24:38,726
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.

169
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:43,480
I shall enjoy watching you die.

170
00:25:14,562 --> 00:25:17,136
Oh, no! The rancor!

171
00:28:04,478 --> 00:28:08,144
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

172
00:28:08,274 --> 00:28:12,486
They will all suffer for this outrage.

173
00:28:27,376 --> 00:28:28,372
Han.

174
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:35,125
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Together again, huh?

175
00:28:35,258 --> 00:28:37,666
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How are we doin'?

176
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:40,472
- Same as always.
- That bad, huh?

177
00:28:40,597 --> 00:28:43,089
- Where's Leia?
- I'm here.

178
00:28:46,728 --> 00:28:48,187
Oh, dear.

179
00:28:49,064 --> 00:28:52,148
His High Exaltedness,
the great Jabba the Hutt...

180
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:55,312
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately.

181
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:57,070
Good. I hate long waits.

182
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:02,064
You will therefore be taken
to the Dune Sea...

183
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:04,527
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...

184
00:29:04,662 --> 00:29:06,951
nesting place
of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

185
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:08,280
Doesn't sound so bad.

186
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:12,284
In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering...

187
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,504
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.

188
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:19,131
On second thought,
let's pass on that.

189
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,884
You should have bargained,Jabba.

190
00:29:24,724 --> 00:29:27,180
<i>That's the last mistake
you'll ever make.</i>

191
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,443
I think my eyes are getting better.

192
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,690
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

193
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:27,741
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here, you know.

194
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:30,704
<i>You're gonna die here,
you know. Convenient.</i>

195
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,119
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.

196
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,574
I've taken care of everything.

197
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:37,741
Great.

198
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:48,217
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

199
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,421
I'm terribly sorry.

200
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,476
R2, what are you doing here?

201
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:57,640
I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

202
00:30:57,774 --> 00:31:00,727
They're going to execute Master Luke,
and if we're not careful, us too.

203
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,521
I wish I had your confidence.

204
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,051
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...

205
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:34,301
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honourably.

206
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:38,759
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...

207
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,895
the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.

208
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:52,452
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of worm-ridden filth...

209
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,199
he'll get no such pleasure from us!

210
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,121
Right?

211
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,494
This is your last chance.

212
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:04,704
Free us or die.

213
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,964
Move him into position.

214
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:38,403
Put him in.

215
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:04,313
Easy, Chewie.

216
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:15,740
Help!

217
00:33:22,498 --> 00:33:24,705
Chewie, you're hit?
Where is it?

218
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:32,257
Han, Chewie!

219
00:33:32,383 --> 00:33:33,414
Lando.

220
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:42,845
Boba Fett?

221
00:33:44,895 --> 00:33:46,306
Boba Fett? Where?

222
00:34:19,512 --> 00:34:21,505
- Lando, grab it!
- Lower it!

223
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,015
I'm trying!

224
00:34:45,162 --> 00:34:47,570
Grab me, Chewie.
Grab it!

225
00:35:00,302 --> 00:35:02,544
Grab it. Almost.
You almost got it.

226
00:35:11,938 --> 00:35:13,267
Gently, now.

227
00:35:13,398 --> 00:35:15,438
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.

228
00:35:27,203 --> 00:35:28,746
Chewie, give me the gun.

229
00:35:28,872 --> 00:35:31,873
- Don't move, Lando.
- Wait! I thought you were blind!

230
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,993
I can see a lot better.
Don't move.

231
00:35:34,127 --> 00:35:35,669
A little higher!

232
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,832
Chewie, pull us up.

233
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:43,510
Up, Chewie. Up.

234
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:46,924
We gotta get out of here.

235
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,432
Not my eyes! R2, help!

236
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,474
Quickly, R2!

237
00:35:53,021 --> 00:35:54,052
Beast!

238
00:35:59,443 --> 00:36:01,270
Get the gun!

239
00:36:01,404 --> 00:36:02,649
Point it at the deck.

240
00:36:08,203 --> 00:36:09,745
Point it at the deck!

241
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,079
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly-

242
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:22,757
Come on.

243
00:36:30,808 --> 00:36:33,263
- Let's go. Don't forget the droids.
- We're on our way.

244
00:37:12,807 --> 00:37:14,550
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

245
00:37:14,684 --> 00:37:17,305
<i>Hurry. The Alliance
should be assembled by now.</i>

246
00:37:17,437 --> 00:37:20,106
<i>- I will.
- Luke, thanks.</i>

247
00:37:20,231 --> 00:37:23,482
<i>Thanks for coming after me.
Now I owe you one.</i>

248
00:37:29,198 --> 00:37:31,606
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

249
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:40,282
I have a promise to keep...

250
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:42,374
to an old friend.

251
00:38:33,553 --> 00:38:35,012
Rise, my friend.

252
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:44,978
The Death Star will be
completed on schedule.

253
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:48,264
You've done well, Lord Vader.

254
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:54,236
<i>Now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.</i>

255
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,111
Yes, my master.

256
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:01,532
Patience, my friend.

257
00:39:01,664 --> 00:39:04,997
In time, he will seek you out.

258
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:09,538
<i>When he does,
you must bring him before me.</i>

259
00:39:09,671 --> 00:39:11,960
He has grown strong.

260
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:17,761
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

261
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,632
As you wish.

262
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:25,264
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.

263
00:39:51,713 --> 00:39:53,539
That face you make-

264
00:39:54,632 --> 00:39:57,170
Look I so old to young eyes?

265
00:39:57,301 --> 00:39:59,045
No, of course not.

266
00:40:00,471 --> 00:40:02,096
I do.

267
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:07,183
Yes, I do.

268
00:40:09,355 --> 00:40:11,846
Sick have I become.

269
00:40:11,982 --> 00:40:13,940
Old and weak.

270
00:40:18,614 --> 00:40:20,524
When 900 years old you reach...

271
00:40:20,658 --> 00:40:22,484
look as good you will not.

272
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,498
Soon will I rest.

273
00:40:31,627 --> 00:40:34,747
Yes. Forever sleep.

274
00:40:36,382 --> 00:40:38,006
Earned it I have.

275
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:40,802
Master Yoda, you can't die.

276
00:40:42,387 --> 00:40:45,057
Strong am I with the Force...

277
00:40:45,182 --> 00:40:47,139
but not that strong.

278
00:40:49,853 --> 00:40:54,977
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

279
00:40:58,945 --> 00:41:00,570
That is the way of things...

280
00:41:02,783 --> 00:41:04,906
the way of the Force.

281
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:08,701
But I need your help.

282
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:11,996
I've come back
to complete the training.

283
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:14,248
No more training do you require.

284
00:41:14,377 --> 00:41:17,497
Already know you
that which you need.

285
00:41:20,634 --> 00:41:22,874
Then I am a Jedi.

286
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:31,469
Not yet.

287
00:41:31,602 --> 00:41:33,595
One thing remains-

288
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:39,059
Vader. You must confront Vader.

289
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,988
Then- only then-
a Jedi will you be.

290
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:47,864
And confront him you will.

291
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:53,998
Master Yoda...

292
00:41:57,753 --> 00:42:00,160
is Darth Vader my father?

293
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,790
Rest I need.

294
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:07,338
Yes.

295
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,095
Rest.

296
00:42:10,932 --> 00:42:12,972
Yoda, I must know.

297
00:42:17,314 --> 00:42:19,472
Your father he is.

298
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,318
Told you, did he?

299
00:42:30,076 --> 00:42:31,452
Yes.

300
00:42:33,288 --> 00:42:35,576
Unexpected this is.

301
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:38,994
And unfortunate.

302
00:42:40,795 --> 00:42:42,834
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

303
00:42:42,964 --> 00:42:44,244
No.

304
00:42:47,468 --> 00:42:51,382
<i>Unfortunate that
you rushed to face him...</i>

305
00:42:51,513 --> 00:42:54,051
that incomplete
was your training...

306
00:42:55,142 --> 00:42:58,642
that not ready
for the burden were you.

307
00:43:00,648 --> 00:43:02,273
I'm sorry.

308
00:43:03,484 --> 00:43:08,988
Remember, a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

309
00:43:14,036 --> 00:43:15,779
But beware.

310
00:43:15,913 --> 00:43:19,447
Anger, fear, aggression...

311
00:43:19,582 --> 00:43:22,204
the dark side are they.

312
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:26,662
Once you start down the dark path...

313
00:43:26,798 --> 00:43:30,547
forever will it dominate your destiny.

314
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:39,552
Do not-

315
00:43:42,647 --> 00:43:47,144
Do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

316
00:43:48,236 --> 00:43:51,687
or suffer your father's fate you will.

317
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,200
When gone am I...

318
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,165
the last of the Jedi will you be.

319
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:10,751
The Force runs strong in your family.

320
00:44:13,261 --> 00:44:16,843
Pass on what you have learned.

321
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,482
There is...

322
00:44:29,652 --> 00:44:31,312
another...

323
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:39,820
Skywalker.

324
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:42,512
I can't do it, R2.

325
00:45:46,394 --> 00:45:48,800
I can't go on alone.

326
00:45:48,937 --> 00:45:51,096
<i>Yoda will always be with you.</i>

327
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:53,389
Obi-Wan.

328
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:03,074
Why didn't you tell me?

329
00:46:03,201 --> 00:46:07,069
You told me Vader betrayed
and murdered my father.

330
00:46:07,205 --> 00:46:12,710
Your father was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

331
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:16,751
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

332
00:46:16,882 --> 00:46:18,375
When that happened...

333
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:21,675
<i>the good man who was
your father was destroyed.</i>

334
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,128
So what I told you was true...

335
00:46:25,265 --> 00:46:27,092
from a certain point of view.

336
00:46:27,225 --> 00:46:29,681
A certain point of view?

337
00:46:29,811 --> 00:46:33,678
Luke, you're going to find
that many of the truths we cling to...

338
00:46:33,814 --> 00:46:36,732
depend greatly
on our own point of view.

339
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:40,231
Anakin was a good friend.

340
00:46:41,197 --> 00:46:42,775
When I first knew him...

341
00:46:42,907 --> 00:46:45,066
<i>your father was already a great pilot...</i>

342
00:46:45,201 --> 00:46:48,819
but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.

343
00:46:48,954 --> 00:46:52,904
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

344
00:46:53,042 --> 00:46:56,956
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

345
00:46:57,088 --> 00:46:58,368
I was wrong.

346
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,214
There is still good in him.

347
00:47:01,342 --> 00:47:04,093
He's more machine now than man...

348
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:06,176
twisted and evil.

349
00:47:07,931 --> 00:47:10,138
I can't do it, Ben.

350
00:47:10,267 --> 00:47:12,176
You cannot escape your destiny.

351
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:15,561
You must face Darth Vader again.

352
00:47:15,689 --> 00:47:18,476
I can't kill my own father.

353
00:47:21,736 --> 00:47:24,821
Then the emperor has already won.

354
00:47:25,866 --> 00:47:28,108
You were our only hope.

355
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:31,533
Yoda spoke of another.

356
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:36,155
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.

357
00:47:37,085 --> 00:47:39,042
But I have no sister.

358
00:47:40,171 --> 00:47:42,081
To protect you both
from the emperor...

359
00:47:42,215 --> 00:47:45,798
<i>you were hidden from your father
when you were born.</i>

360
00:47:45,927 --> 00:47:48,382
The emperor knew, as I did...

361
00:47:48,513 --> 00:47:52,213
if Anakin were to have any offspring...

362
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:54,888
they would be a threat to him.

363
00:47:55,019 --> 00:48:00,310
That is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous.

364
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,810
- Leia is my sister.
- Your insight serves you well.

365
00:48:08,115 --> 00:48:10,986
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

366
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,491
They do you credit...

367
00:48:13,621 --> 00:48:16,705
but they could be made
to serve the emperor.

368
00:48:39,188 --> 00:48:41,857
Look at you. A general, huh?

369
00:48:41,982 --> 00:48:45,067
Someone must have told them about
my manoeuvre at the Battle of Tanaab.

370
00:48:45,194 --> 00:48:48,064
Don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

371
00:48:48,196 --> 00:48:51,150
I didn't know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack.

372
00:48:51,283 --> 00:48:53,406
I'm surprised they didn't
ask you to do it.

373
00:48:54,286 --> 00:48:56,243
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.

374
00:48:56,371 --> 00:48:58,163
You're the respectable one, remember?

375
00:49:06,506 --> 00:49:09,460
The emperor's made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.

376
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,127
The data brought to us by the Bothan
spies pinpoint the exact location...

377
00:49:14,264 --> 00:49:16,386
of the emperor's new battle station.

378
00:49:16,515 --> 00:49:18,307
We also know
that the weapon systems...

379
00:49:18,434 --> 00:49:20,676
of this Death Star
are not yet operational.

380
00:49:20,811 --> 00:49:23,766
With the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy...

381
00:49:23,898 --> 00:49:25,392
in a vain effort to engage us...

382
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:27,399
it is relatively unprotected.

383
00:49:27,527 --> 00:49:29,566
But most important of all...

384
00:49:30,487 --> 00:49:32,397
we've learned that
the emperor himself...

385
00:49:32,531 --> 00:49:34,654
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

386
00:49:34,783 --> 00:49:37,239
of the construction
of this Death Star.

387
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,581
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

388
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:46,455
Admiral Ackbar, please.

389
00:49:46,586 --> 00:49:51,712
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

390
00:49:51,842 --> 00:49:57,299
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational...

391
00:49:57,431 --> 00:50:00,930
the Death Star does have
a strong defence mechanism.

392
00:50:02,227 --> 00:50:04,516
It is protected by an energy shield...

393
00:50:04,646 --> 00:50:08,264
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of Endor.

394
00:50:13,906 --> 00:50:17,653
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

395
00:50:19,077 --> 00:50:22,991
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter...

396
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:26,040
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure...

397
00:50:26,168 --> 00:50:29,121
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor.

398
00:50:32,006 --> 00:50:35,007
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

399
00:50:35,134 --> 00:50:36,415
Good luck.

400
00:50:38,054 --> 00:50:40,011
You're gonna need it.

401
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:41,848
General Madine.

402
00:50:42,892 --> 00:50:45,809
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.

403
00:50:45,936 --> 00:50:50,148
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code...

404
00:50:50,274 --> 00:50:55,067
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

405
00:50:55,196 --> 00:50:56,441
Sounds dangerous.

406
00:50:56,572 --> 00:50:58,860
Wonder who they found
to pull that off.

407
00:50:58,991 --> 00:51:01,992
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

408
00:51:02,786 --> 00:51:06,036
My team's ready. I don't have
a command crew for the shuttle.

409
00:51:07,207 --> 00:51:09,284
It's gonna be rough.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

410
00:51:11,754 --> 00:51:15,703
- That's one.
- General, count me in.

411
00:51:15,841 --> 00:51:17,750
I'm with you too.

412
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,392
- What is it?
- Ask me again sometime.

413
00:51:27,436 --> 00:51:30,140
Hi, Han, Chewie.

414
00:51:31,272 --> 00:51:33,728
"Exciting" is hardly the word
I would choose.

415
00:51:49,332 --> 00:51:52,368
Look, I want you to take her.

416
00:51:52,502 --> 00:51:54,044
I mean it. Take her.

417
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:57,586
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

418
00:51:57,716 --> 00:52:00,040
All right, old buddy.

419
00:52:00,176 --> 00:52:02,168
I know what she means to you.

420
00:52:02,303 --> 00:52:06,004
I'll take good care of her.
She won't get a scratch.

421
00:52:07,308 --> 00:52:08,719
All right?

422
00:52:08,851 --> 00:52:10,132
Right.

423
00:52:17,026 --> 00:52:19,599
I got your promise.
Not a scratch.

424
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:21,895
Would you get going, you pirate?

425
00:52:23,657 --> 00:52:24,820
Good luck.

426
00:52:24,951 --> 00:52:26,445
You too.

427
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:37,543
- Got her warmed?
- Yeah, she's coming up.

428
00:52:40,215 --> 00:52:43,833
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees
in mind when they designed her, Chewie.

429
00:52:54,146 --> 00:52:56,103
Hey, you awake?

430
00:52:56,231 --> 00:52:59,682
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.

431
00:53:01,819 --> 00:53:04,192
Come on, General. Let's move.

432
00:53:04,322 --> 00:53:07,656
Right. Chewie, let's see
what this piece of junk can do.

433
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:09,990
- Ready, everybody?
- All set.

434
00:53:12,538 --> 00:53:14,329
Here we go again.

435
00:53:25,343 --> 00:53:27,251
All right, hang on.

436
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:46,060
What is thy bidding, my master?

437
00:53:47,114 --> 00:53:50,483
Send the fleet
to the far side of Endor.

438
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:58,073
There it will stay until called for.

439
00:53:59,459 --> 00:54:03,504
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?

440
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,623
It is of no concern.

441
00:54:06,425 --> 00:54:10,672
Soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

442
00:54:10,804 --> 00:54:12,595
Your work here is finished, my friend.

443
00:54:12,722 --> 00:54:15,391
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.

444
00:54:15,517 --> 00:54:17,426
Yes, my master.

445
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:36,196
If they don't go for this, we're gonna
have to get out pretty quick.

446
00:54:38,456 --> 00:54:41,125
<i>We have you on our screen now.
Please identify.</i>

447
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:46,494
<i>Shuttle Tydirium requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.</i>

448
00:54:52,178 --> 00:54:56,222
<i>Shuttle Tydirium, transmit
the clearance code for shield passage.</i>

449
00:54:57,641 --> 00:54:59,052
Transmission commencing.

450
00:54:59,184 --> 00:55:02,185
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.

451
00:55:03,314 --> 00:55:05,472
It'll work. It'll work.

452
00:55:06,859 --> 00:55:09,017
Vader's on that ship.

453
00:55:09,153 --> 00:55:10,979
Don't get jittery, Luke.

454
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:13,319
There are a lot of command ships.

455
00:55:14,408 --> 00:55:17,990
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't
look like you're keeping your distance.

456
00:55:19,246 --> 00:55:21,702
I don't know. Fly casual.

457
00:55:26,961 --> 00:55:28,835
Where is that shuttle going?

458
00:55:29,714 --> 00:55:32,003
<i>Shuttle Tydirium,
what is your cargo and destination?</i>

459
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:36,050
<i>Parts and technical crew
for the forest moon.</i>

460
00:55:38,265 --> 00:55:40,885
Do they have a code clearance?

461
00:55:41,684 --> 00:55:43,926
It's an older code, sir,
but it checks out.

462
00:55:44,062 --> 00:55:46,019
I was about to clear them.

463
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,102
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

464
00:55:53,238 --> 00:55:55,526
It's your imagination, kid.

465
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:58,408
Come on. Let's keep
a little optimism here.

466
00:56:06,542 --> 00:56:08,001
Shall I hold them?

467
00:56:09,087 --> 00:56:11,956
No. Leave them to me.

468
00:56:12,089 --> 00:56:14,378
I will deal with them myself.

469
00:56:15,259 --> 00:56:17,465
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.

470
00:56:19,347 --> 00:56:21,220
They're not going for it, Chewie.

471
00:56:25,435 --> 00:56:27,143
<i>Shuttle Tydirium...</i>

472
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,643
<i>deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately.</i>

473
00:56:29,773 --> 00:56:32,062
<i>Follow your present course.</i>

474
00:56:32,192 --> 00:56:34,683
Okay. I told you
it was gonna work.

475
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:35,983
No problem.

476
00:57:09,395 --> 00:57:11,435
I told you it was dangerous here.

477
00:57:26,871 --> 00:57:30,322
- Should we try and go around?
- It'll take time.

478
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:33,459
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.

479
00:57:36,297 --> 00:57:38,585
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

480
00:57:38,715 --> 00:57:41,385
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.

481
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:42,885
Hey...

482
00:57:43,011 --> 00:57:44,292
it's me.

483
00:58:09,913 --> 00:58:11,905
Go for help! Go!

484
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,534
Great. Come on!

485
00:58:29,098 --> 00:58:31,056
Over there! Two more of them.

486
00:58:32,101 --> 00:58:34,390
I see them. Wait. Leia!

487
00:58:38,274 --> 00:58:39,732
Hey, wait!

488
00:58:46,032 --> 00:58:48,487
Quick, jam their comlink.
Centre switch.

489
00:59:00,129 --> 00:59:01,706
Move closer.

490
00:59:04,175 --> 00:59:05,634
Get alongside that one.

491
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,173
Keep on that one.
I'll take these two.

492
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,843
General Solo, somebody's coming.

493
01:02:18,198 --> 01:02:19,313
Where's Leia?

494
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:22,607
- She didn't come back?
- I thought she was with you.

495
01:02:22,744 --> 01:02:25,235
We got separated.
We better go look for her.

496
01:02:25,371 --> 01:02:28,408
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet
at the shield generator at 0300.

497
01:02:28,541 --> 01:02:30,581
Come on, R2.
We'll need your scanners.

498
01:02:31,836 --> 01:02:34,458
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.

499
01:02:35,965 --> 01:02:38,088
And you said it was pretty here.

500
01:03:00,865 --> 01:03:02,739
Cut it out.

501
01:03:19,591 --> 01:03:21,667
I'm not gonna hurt you.

502
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:32,396
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

503
01:03:34,397 --> 01:03:36,686
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.

504
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:39,691
Maybe you can help me.

505
01:03:40,945 --> 01:03:42,653
Come on. Sit down.

506
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:46,739
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.

507
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:50,985
All right.
You want something to eat?

508
01:03:57,754 --> 01:03:59,212
That's right.

509
01:04:04,134 --> 01:04:05,842
Come on.

510
01:04:26,073 --> 01:04:27,448
Look. It's a hat.

511
01:04:27,574 --> 01:04:29,532
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.

512
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:38,623
You're a jittery little thing,
aren't you?

513
01:04:43,924 --> 01:04:45,466
What is it?

514
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:26,370
Freeze!

515
01:05:26,507 --> 01:05:28,714
Come on. Get up.

516
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:35,925
- Get your ride. Take her back to base.
- Yes, sir.

517
01:05:40,729 --> 01:05:41,892
What the-

518
01:05:58,956 --> 01:06:01,529
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

519
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:46,412
I told you to remain
on the command ship.

520
01:06:48,128 --> 01:06:52,874
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

521
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:56,176
Yes, I know.

522
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,928
My son is with them.

523
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:06,226
- Are you sure?
- I have felt him, my master.

524
01:07:07,689 --> 01:07:10,181
Strange that I have not.

525
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:16,984
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

526
01:07:17,115 --> 01:07:19,867
They are clear, my master.

527
01:07:19,993 --> 01:07:24,240
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.

528
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:27,374
He will come to me?

529
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:31,952
I have foreseen it.

530
01:07:32,088 --> 01:07:36,133
His compassion for you
will be his undoing.

531
01:07:36,259 --> 01:07:40,173
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.

532
01:07:40,972 --> 01:07:42,514
As you wish.

533
01:08:04,078 --> 01:08:05,489
Master Luke.

534
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:11,960
There's two more
wrecked speeders back there.

535
01:08:12,086 --> 01:08:13,995
And I found this.

536
01:08:15,505 --> 01:08:19,883
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

537
01:08:22,304 --> 01:08:23,929
I hope she's all right.

538
01:08:28,894 --> 01:08:30,009
What, Chewie?

539
01:08:32,689 --> 01:08:34,516
What, Chewie?

540
01:08:48,163 --> 01:08:51,532
I don't get it.
It's just a dead animal.

541
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:54,249
Chewie, wait! Don't!

542
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:00,257
Nice work.

543
01:09:02,051 --> 01:09:03,878
Great, Chewie.

544
01:09:04,011 --> 01:09:06,088
Great. Always thinking
with your stomach.

545
01:09:06,222 --> 01:09:09,389
Take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.

546
01:09:09,517 --> 01:09:11,225
Han, can you reach my lightsabre?

547
01:09:11,353 --> 01:09:12,811
Yeah. Sure.

548
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:22,398
R2, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

549
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:24,523
It's a very long drop!

550
01:10:07,449 --> 01:10:10,367
Hey. Point that thing
someplace else.

551
01:10:14,914 --> 01:10:16,029
Hey!

552
01:10:16,165 --> 01:10:18,621
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

553
01:10:24,883 --> 01:10:27,338
Chewie, give them your crossbow.

554
01:10:29,428 --> 01:10:31,053
Oh, my head.

555
01:10:35,309 --> 01:10:37,101
Oh, my goodness.

556
01:11:08,926 --> 01:11:10,835
Do you understand
anything they're saying?

557
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:12,381
Oh, yes, Master Luke.

558
01:11:12,513 --> 01:11:15,299
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms-

559
01:11:15,432 --> 01:11:17,056
What are you telling them?

560
01:11:18,268 --> 01:11:20,344
"Hello," I think.

561
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:23,515
I could be mistaken-
they're using a very primitive dialect-

562
01:11:23,649 --> 01:11:27,184
but I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.

563
01:11:31,489 --> 01:11:35,986
Why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?

564
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:38,990
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

565
01:11:39,998 --> 01:11:41,373
Proper?

566
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,120
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.

567
01:11:44,252 --> 01:11:45,497
Why, you-

568
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,214
My mistake.

569
01:11:56,931 --> 01:11:58,888
He's an old friend of mine.

570
01:12:26,043 --> 01:12:27,418
Hey.

571
01:12:44,602 --> 01:12:47,058
I have a really bad feeling about this.

572
01:13:08,084 --> 01:13:09,662
What did he say?

573
01:13:09,794 --> 01:13:12,119
I'm rather embarrassed,
General Solo...

574
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:15,754
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honour.

575
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:35,648
Your Royal Highness.

576
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,521
These are my friends.

577
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:44,827
3PO, tell them
they must be set free.

578
01:14:02,637 --> 01:14:05,804
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.

579
01:14:05,932 --> 01:14:09,847
3PO, tell them
if they don't do as you wish...

580
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:11,935
<i>you'll become angry
and use your magic.</i>

581
01:14:12,063 --> 01:14:14,435
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly-

582
01:14:14,566 --> 01:14:16,108
Tell them.

583
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:34,117
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...

584
01:14:34,252 --> 01:14:35,829
just as I said they wouldn't.

585
01:14:35,962 --> 01:14:37,242
Wait.

586
01:14:45,888 --> 01:14:47,762
What's happening?

587
01:14:53,187 --> 01:14:54,895
Put me down!
Help!

588
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:56,564
Somebody!

589
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:58,018
Somebody help!

590
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:00,855
Master Luke! R2, quickly!

591
01:15:32,601 --> 01:15:33,976
Thank goodness.

592
01:15:46,322 --> 01:15:47,982
Thanks, 3PO.

593
01:15:49,242 --> 01:15:51,199
I never knew I had it in me.

594
01:15:58,793 --> 01:16:00,251
...Tatooine...

595
01:16:01,671 --> 01:16:04,078
Princess Leia... R2.

596
01:16:06,259 --> 01:16:07,718
...Darth Vader!

597
01:16:10,846 --> 01:16:12,589
...Death Star.

598
01:16:15,601 --> 01:16:17,843
...Jedi... Obi-Wan Kenobi.

599
01:16:23,442 --> 01:16:25,315
Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.

600
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:29,776
Master Luke...

601
01:16:36,455 --> 01:16:40,072
<i>...Millennium Falcon... Cloud City.</i>

602
01:16:42,752 --> 01:16:43,832
...Vader!

603
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,125
Han Solo...

604
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:49,759
...carbon.

605
01:16:51,345 --> 01:16:52,590
...Sarlacc.

606
01:17:14,242 --> 01:17:17,077
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

607
01:17:30,841 --> 01:17:33,511
Wonderful. We are now
a part of the tribe.

608
01:17:34,929 --> 01:17:36,803
Just what I always wanted.

609
01:17:48,609 --> 01:17:50,898
Short help's better than
no help at all, Chewie.

610
01:17:56,533 --> 01:17:59,736
The scouts will show us the quickest
way to the shield generator.

611
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:01,827
Good. How far is it?

612
01:18:01,955 --> 01:18:03,580
Ask him.

613
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:06,915
We need some fresh supplies too.

614
01:18:07,044 --> 01:18:08,952
Try and get our weapons back.

615
01:18:10,463 --> 01:18:12,670
Hurry up.
I haven't got all day.

616
01:18:15,176 --> 01:18:17,050
Luke, what's wrong?

617
01:18:18,972 --> 01:18:22,424
<i>Leia, do you remember
your mother-</i>

618
01:18:22,559 --> 01:18:24,598
<i>your real mother?</i>

619
01:18:24,727 --> 01:18:28,227
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

620
01:18:28,356 --> 01:18:30,265
What do you remember?

621
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,973
Just images really. Feelings.

622
01:18:33,111 --> 01:18:34,688
Tell me.

623
01:18:36,406 --> 01:18:39,441
She was... very beautiful.

624
01:18:39,575 --> 01:18:42,196
Kind... but sad.

625
01:18:44,372 --> 01:18:47,159
Why are you asking me this?

626
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:49,747
I have no memory of my mother.

627
01:18:50,795 --> 01:18:52,787
I never knew her.

628
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:56,748
Luke, tell me.
What's troubling you?

629
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:05,465
Vader is here.
Now. On this moon.

630
01:19:07,103 --> 01:19:08,810
How do you know?

631
01:19:08,937 --> 01:19:10,846
I felt his presence.

632
01:19:11,898 --> 01:19:15,149
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.

633
01:19:15,277 --> 01:19:17,151
That's why I have to go.

634
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:20,731
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

635
01:19:21,784 --> 01:19:24,737
- I have to face him.
- Why?

636
01:19:29,749 --> 01:19:31,623
He's my father.

637
01:19:35,672 --> 01:19:37,214
Your father?

638
01:19:38,508 --> 01:19:42,506
There's more. It won't be easy
for you to hear it, but you must.

639
01:19:42,637 --> 01:19:45,472
<i>If I don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.</i>

640
01:19:45,598 --> 01:19:47,093
Don't talk that way.

641
01:19:47,225 --> 01:19:51,720
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

642
01:19:51,854 --> 01:19:53,847
You're wrong, Leia.

643
01:19:53,981 --> 01:19:55,808
You have that power too.

644
01:19:55,941 --> 01:19:59,275
In time, you'll learn
to use it as I have.

645
01:20:03,908 --> 01:20:06,150
The Force is strong in my family.

646
01:20:07,703 --> 01:20:09,612
My father has it.

647
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,913
I have it.

648
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:14,370
And...

649
01:20:15,669 --> 01:20:18,042
my sister has it.

650
01:20:24,344 --> 01:20:27,464
Yes. It's you, Leia.

651
01:20:32,728 --> 01:20:34,353
I know.

652
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:38,815
Somehow...

653
01:20:40,527 --> 01:20:42,105
I've always known.

654
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:44,194
Then you know
why I have to face him.

655
01:20:46,325 --> 01:20:48,732
Luke, run away.
Far away.

656
01:20:48,869 --> 01:20:52,202
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.

657
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:55,580
- I wish I could go with you.
- No, you don't.

658
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:57,666
You've always been strong.

659
01:20:58,962 --> 01:21:01,251
But why must you confront him?

660
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:05,082
Because there is good in him.
I've felt it.

661
01:21:05,218 --> 01:21:07,210
He won't turn me over
to the emperor.

662
01:21:07,345 --> 01:21:10,464
I can save him. I can turn him
back to the good side.

663
01:21:11,891 --> 01:21:13,682
I have to try.

664
01:21:32,203 --> 01:21:34,112
Hey, what's going on?

665
01:21:35,914 --> 01:21:39,200
Nothing. I just wanna
be alone for a little while.

666
01:21:40,586 --> 01:21:42,210
Nothing?

667
01:21:44,006 --> 01:21:45,915
Tell me.
What's going on?

668
01:21:51,096 --> 01:21:53,254
I can't tell you.

669
01:21:54,891 --> 01:21:57,513
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?

670
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:16,995
I'm sorry.

671
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:22,416
Hold me.

672
01:23:15,721 --> 01:23:17,595
This is the rebel that surrendered.

673
01:23:17,723 --> 01:23:20,640
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them...

674
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:23,472
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

675
01:23:24,562 --> 01:23:27,267
He was armed only with this.

676
01:23:29,276 --> 01:23:30,984
Good work, Commander.

677
01:23:31,111 --> 01:23:33,020
Leave us.

678
01:23:33,155 --> 01:23:36,819
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.

679
01:23:38,284 --> 01:23:40,028
Yes, my lord.

680
01:23:41,871 --> 01:23:43,994
The emperor has been expecting you.

681
01:23:45,375 --> 01:23:46,786
I know, Father.

682
01:23:48,295 --> 01:23:50,619
So, you have accepted the truth.

683
01:23:51,797 --> 01:23:55,297
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

684
01:23:55,426 --> 01:23:58,629
That name no longer
has any meaning for me.

685
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:02,182
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

686
01:24:02,976 --> 01:24:04,599
I know there is good in you.

687
01:24:04,727 --> 01:24:07,348
The emperor hasn't
driven it from you fully.

688
01:24:11,317 --> 01:24:13,523
<i>That was why
you couldn't destroy me.</i>

689
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:17,108
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

690
01:24:24,371 --> 01:24:27,408
I see you have constructed
a new lightsabre.

691
01:24:31,045 --> 01:24:33,998
Your skills are complete.

692
01:24:39,219 --> 01:24:43,798
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.

693
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:50,513
Come with me.

694
01:24:52,607 --> 01:24:55,478
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

695
01:24:56,778 --> 01:25:01,571
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

696
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:04,451
I must obey my master.

697
01:25:05,536 --> 01:25:08,952
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.

698
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:12,906
If that is your destiny.

699
01:25:13,044 --> 01:25:16,828
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.

700
01:25:16,965 --> 01:25:19,585
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

701
01:25:20,843 --> 01:25:24,259
It is too late for me, son.

702
01:25:27,475 --> 01:25:31,804
The emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

703
01:25:31,938 --> 01:25:35,555
He is your master now.

704
01:25:39,612 --> 01:25:42,019
Then my father is truly dead.

705
01:26:25,031 --> 01:26:26,940
The main entrance
to the control bunker...

706
01:26:27,075 --> 01:26:29,068
is on the far side
of that landing platform.

707
01:26:29,953 --> 01:26:33,570
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- Don't worry.

708
01:26:33,706 --> 01:26:36,826
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

709
01:26:45,176 --> 01:26:46,800
What's he saying?

710
01:26:46,927 --> 01:26:50,261
He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.

711
01:27:09,491 --> 01:27:12,860
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.

712
01:27:13,746 --> 01:27:15,703
Proceed with the countdown.

713
01:27:16,915 --> 01:27:19,370
All groups assume attack coordinates.

714
01:27:22,754 --> 01:27:24,711
Don't worry.
My friend's down there.

715
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,378
He'll have that shield down on time.

716
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:32,836
Or this'll be
the shortest offensive of all time.

717
01:27:34,807 --> 01:27:38,508
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

718
01:27:38,645 --> 01:27:40,602
All right. Stand by.

719
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:02,330
Back door, huh? Good idea.

720
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:13,672
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

721
01:28:18,851 --> 01:28:21,686
It only takes one to sound the alarm.

722
01:28:21,812 --> 01:28:24,303
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

723
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,931
- Oh, my. Princess Leia.
- Quiet.

724
01:28:28,277 --> 01:28:30,067
I'm afraid our furry companion...

725
01:28:30,195 --> 01:28:32,318
has gone and done something
rather rash.

726
01:28:37,828 --> 01:28:39,785
There goes our surprise attack.

727
01:28:47,086 --> 01:28:49,328
Look, over there! Stop him!

728
01:29:01,225 --> 01:29:04,262
Not bad for a little furball.
There's only one left.

729
01:29:04,395 --> 01:29:06,851
You stay here.
We'll take care of this.

730
01:29:08,983 --> 01:29:11,190
I have decided that we shall stay here.

731
01:29:41,057 --> 01:29:42,052
Hey!

732
01:30:45,903 --> 01:30:48,690
Welcome, young Skywalker.

733
01:30:48,823 --> 01:30:51,148
I have been expecting you.

734
01:30:52,201 --> 01:30:54,159
You'll no longer need those.

735
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:01,499
Guards, leave us.

736
01:31:08,926 --> 01:31:12,378
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

737
01:31:12,513 --> 01:31:17,589
In time, you will call me master.

738
01:31:17,726 --> 01:31:20,182
You're gravely mistaken.

739
01:31:20,312 --> 01:31:22,435
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

740
01:31:23,315 --> 01:31:27,064
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

741
01:31:29,195 --> 01:31:33,276
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...

742
01:31:34,701 --> 01:31:38,829
about a great many things.

743
01:31:40,541 --> 01:31:42,165
His lightsabre.

744
01:31:42,292 --> 01:31:45,957
Ah, yes. A Jedi's weapon.

745
01:31:46,754 --> 01:31:49,162
Much like your father's.

746
01:31:49,299 --> 01:31:54,091
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

747
01:31:54,221 --> 01:31:57,056
So will it be with you.

748
01:31:57,181 --> 01:31:59,221
You're wrong.

749
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:02,434
Soon I'll be dead-
and you with me.

750
01:32:05,898 --> 01:32:10,193
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.

751
01:32:11,029 --> 01:32:12,439
Yes.

752
01:32:12,571 --> 01:32:17,696
I assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.

753
01:32:18,869 --> 01:32:21,740
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

754
01:32:21,873 --> 01:32:24,992
Your faith in your friends is yours.

755
01:32:27,544 --> 01:32:31,127
It is pointless to resist, my son.

756
01:32:35,177 --> 01:32:40,634
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

757
01:32:40,766 --> 01:32:43,969
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

758
01:32:44,102 --> 01:32:48,432
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

759
01:32:50,359 --> 01:32:52,850
It was I who allowed the Alliance...

760
01:32:52,986 --> 01:32:56,401
to know the location
of the shield generator.

761
01:32:56,531 --> 01:33:00,576
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

762
01:33:00,702 --> 01:33:04,949
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

763
01:33:07,459 --> 01:33:11,207
I'm afraid the deflector shield...

764
01:33:11,337 --> 01:33:16,544
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

765
01:33:20,096 --> 01:33:21,425
All right!

766
01:33:21,556 --> 01:33:23,050
Up! Move!

767
01:33:23,183 --> 01:33:24,641
Quickly. Quickly.

768
01:33:29,146 --> 01:33:30,771
Han, hurry.

769
01:33:30,898 --> 01:33:32,772
The fleet will be here any moment.

770
01:33:34,485 --> 01:33:36,727
Charges. Come on. Come on!

771
01:33:38,865 --> 01:33:40,692
Oh, my. They'll be captured.

772
01:33:43,577 --> 01:33:45,285
Wait! Come back!

773
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:49,581
R2, stay with me.

774
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:52,251
Freeze!

775
01:33:55,631 --> 01:33:57,588
You rebel scum.

776
01:34:17,277 --> 01:34:20,646
- All wings report in.
- Red Leader standing by.

777
01:34:20,781 --> 01:34:23,947
- Grey Leader standing by.
- Green Leader standing by.

778
01:34:24,827 --> 01:34:26,949
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

779
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:32,746
May the Force be with us.

780
01:34:36,338 --> 01:34:39,339
We've gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield- up or down.

781
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:43,678
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know-

782
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,298
if we're coming.

783
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:49,930
Break off the attack.
The shield is still up.

784
01:34:50,059 --> 01:34:52,135
I get no reading. You sure?

785
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,428
<i>Pull up! All craft pull up!</i>

786
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:02,893
Take evasive action. Green Group,
stick close to Holding Sector MV-7.

787
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:07,492
Admiral, we have
enemy ships in Sector 47.

788
01:35:07,618 --> 01:35:09,113
It's a trap.

789
01:35:12,706 --> 01:35:14,663
Fighters coming in.

790
01:35:18,128 --> 01:35:19,457
There's too many.

791
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,168
Accelerate to attack speed.
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

792
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:27,334
Copy, Gold Leader.

793
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:32,260
Come, boy.

794
01:35:33,143 --> 01:35:35,100
See for yourself.

795
01:35:37,773 --> 01:35:42,979
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance...

796
01:35:43,111 --> 01:35:46,943
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.

797
01:35:52,204 --> 01:35:54,528
You want this...

798
01:35:55,331 --> 01:35:57,205
don't you?

799
01:35:57,333 --> 01:36:01,829
The hate is swelling in you now.

800
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:04,789
Take your Jedi weapon.

801
01:36:04,924 --> 01:36:06,668
Use it.

802
01:36:06,801 --> 01:36:08,759
I am unarmed.

803
01:36:08,887 --> 01:36:10,760
Strike me down with it.

804
01:36:10,888 --> 01:36:13,426
Give in to your anger.

805
01:36:14,475 --> 01:36:19,600
<i>With each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant.</i>

806
01:36:26,195 --> 01:36:28,234
It is unavoidable.

807
01:36:29,323 --> 01:36:31,446
It is your destiny.

808
01:36:32,493 --> 01:36:35,613
You, like your father...

809
01:36:35,746 --> 01:36:37,371
are now...

810
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:39,914
mine.

811
01:36:58,059 --> 01:37:00,385
All right, move it.

812
01:37:08,402 --> 01:37:10,027
Hello. I say, over there.

813
01:37:10,988 --> 01:37:13,147
Were you looking for me?

814
01:37:14,492 --> 01:37:16,532
Bring those two down here.

815
01:37:24,168 --> 01:37:28,462
They're on their way.
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

816
01:37:28,589 --> 01:37:29,918
Freeze.

817
01:37:30,049 --> 01:37:31,164
Don't move.

818
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:33,210
We surrender.

819
01:39:38,883 --> 01:39:40,757
The code's changed.

820
01:39:40,885 --> 01:39:43,258
- We need R2.
- Here's the terminal.

821
01:39:43,388 --> 01:39:45,381
R2, where are you?

822
01:39:45,515 --> 01:39:47,472
We need you at the bunker
right away.

823
01:39:49,561 --> 01:39:51,055
Going? What do you mean?

824
01:39:52,772 --> 01:39:54,396
Going where, R2?

825
01:39:54,524 --> 01:39:58,735
Wait. R2, this is
no time for heroics.

826
01:39:58,861 --> 01:40:00,522
Come back!

827
01:40:26,764 --> 01:40:28,555
Watch yourself, Wedge.
Three from above.

828
01:40:28,682 --> 01:40:31,600
- Red Three, Red Two, pull in.
- Got it.

829
01:40:34,855 --> 01:40:36,598
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

830
01:40:36,731 --> 01:40:38,439
Cut left.
I'll take the leader.

831
01:40:46,784 --> 01:40:48,527
They're heading
for the medical frigate.

832
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:54,738
Pressure's steady.

833
01:41:03,926 --> 01:41:07,210
Only the fighters are attacking.
What are the Stardestroyers waiting for?

834
01:41:11,850 --> 01:41:13,558
We're in attack position, sir.

835
01:41:13,685 --> 01:41:16,852
- Hold here.
- We're not going to attack?

836
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:20,265
My orders are from the emperor himself.
He has something special planned.

837
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:22,308
We only need to
keep them from escaping.

838
01:41:24,028 --> 01:41:28,108
As you can see,
my young apprentice...

839
01:41:28,241 --> 01:41:31,491
<i>your friends have failed.</i>

840
01:41:32,287 --> 01:41:34,659
Now witness the firepower...

841
01:41:34,789 --> 01:41:40,127
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.

842
01:41:41,295 --> 01:41:43,833
Fire at will, Commander.

843
01:41:50,846 --> 01:41:52,554
Fire.

844
01:41:59,188 --> 01:42:01,726
That blast came from the Death Star.

845
01:42:02,691 --> 01:42:05,016
That thing's operational.

846
01:42:05,151 --> 01:42:06,978
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

847
01:42:07,112 --> 01:42:09,188
We saw it.
All craft prepare to retreat.

848
01:42:09,322 --> 01:42:11,529
You won't get
another chance at this, Admiral.

849
01:42:11,658 --> 01:42:14,410
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

850
01:42:14,536 --> 01:42:17,822
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.

851
01:42:17,956 --> 01:42:21,656
Han will have that shield down.
We've gotta give him more time.

852
01:42:40,478 --> 01:42:41,889
We're coming.

853
01:42:47,777 --> 01:42:49,105
Come on.

854
01:42:52,907 --> 01:42:54,282
R2, hurry!

855
01:43:00,331 --> 01:43:01,280
My goodness!

856
01:43:07,379 --> 01:43:09,372
Why did you have to be so brave?

857
01:43:12,551 --> 01:43:15,089
Well, I suppose I could
hot-wire this thing.

858
01:43:15,221 --> 01:43:16,679
I'll cover you.

859
01:43:58,263 --> 01:44:00,718
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can...

860
01:44:00,849 --> 01:44:03,553
and engage those Stardestroyers
at point-blank range.

861
01:44:03,684 --> 01:44:07,100
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Stardestroyers.

862
01:44:07,229 --> 01:44:09,851
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star...

863
01:44:09,982 --> 01:44:12,224
and we might
take a few of them with us.

864
01:44:15,154 --> 01:44:16,483
She's gonna blow!

865
01:44:20,576 --> 01:44:22,153
I'm hit!

866
01:44:27,333 --> 01:44:29,491
Your fleet is lost...

867
01:44:29,627 --> 01:44:33,671
and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.

868
01:44:35,966 --> 01:44:38,374
There is no escape...

869
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:41,132
my young apprentice.

870
01:44:43,349 --> 01:44:45,804
The Alliance will die...

871
01:44:47,685 --> 01:44:50,521
as will your friends.

872
01:44:54,151 --> 01:44:55,431
Good.

873
01:44:56,445 --> 01:44:59,695
I can feel your anger.

874
01:45:01,450 --> 01:45:04,948
I am defenceless.
Take your weapon.

875
01:45:05,078 --> 01:45:08,198
Strike me down
with all of your hatred...

876
01:45:08,331 --> 01:45:12,827
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.

877
01:45:52,124 --> 01:45:54,164
- Look!
- Get him off of there.

878
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:49,312
I think I got it.

879
01:47:49,447 --> 01:47:50,692
I got it!

880
01:47:57,998 --> 01:47:59,278
Are you all right?

881
01:47:59,416 --> 01:48:01,289
- Let's see.
- It's not bad.

882
01:48:01,417 --> 01:48:02,697
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.

883
01:48:02,835 --> 01:48:04,329
Don't move.

884
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,505
- I love you.
- I know.

885
01:48:11,636 --> 01:48:12,964
Hands up.

886
01:48:14,097 --> 01:48:15,294
Stand up.

887
01:48:25,149 --> 01:48:26,608
Stay back.

888
01:48:34,533 --> 01:48:37,238
Get down here.
She's wounded.

889
01:48:37,369 --> 01:48:39,196
No, wait.

890
01:48:39,330 --> 01:48:40,907
I got an idea.

891
01:48:52,217 --> 01:48:53,711
Good.

892
01:48:53,844 --> 01:48:57,628
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

893
01:48:57,765 --> 01:49:00,468
Let the hate flow through you.

894
01:49:06,147 --> 01:49:09,730
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

895
01:49:13,196 --> 01:49:15,568
I will not fight you, Father.

896
01:49:29,670 --> 01:49:32,457
You are unwise
to lower your defences.

897
01:49:57,406 --> 01:49:59,813
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

898
01:49:59,950 --> 01:50:03,070
I feel the good in you, the conflict.

899
01:50:03,203 --> 01:50:05,659
There is no conflict.

900
01:50:08,041 --> 01:50:09,999
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before...

901
01:50:10,127 --> 01:50:12,084
<i>and I don't believe
you'll destroy me now.</i>

902
01:50:12,212 --> 01:50:16,755
You underestimate
the power of the dark side.

903
01:50:16,883 --> 01:50:18,710
If you will not fight...

904
01:50:18,843 --> 01:50:21,417
then you will meet your destiny.

905
01:50:32,899 --> 01:50:34,097
Good.

906
01:50:34,233 --> 01:50:35,644
Good.

907
01:50:44,326 --> 01:50:47,945
- Watch out. Squad at.06.
- I'm on it, Gold Leader.

908
01:50:49,874 --> 01:50:51,285
Good shot, Red Two.

909
01:50:54,921 --> 01:50:58,004
We're sure in the middle of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy.

910
01:50:58,131 --> 01:50:59,792
Don't let me down.

911
01:51:04,346 --> 01:51:05,805
<i>It's over, Commander.</i>

912
01:51:05,931 --> 01:51:08,257
<i>The rebels have been routed.
They're fleeing.</i>

913
01:51:08,392 --> 01:51:10,930
<i>We need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit.</i>

914
01:51:12,021 --> 01:51:13,977
Send three squads to help.

915
01:51:14,106 --> 01:51:16,063
- Open the back door.
- Sir.

916
01:51:30,246 --> 01:51:31,657
Throw me another charge.

917
01:51:49,224 --> 01:51:52,011
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

918
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:55,179
I will not fight you.

919
01:51:58,691 --> 01:52:01,727
Give yourself to the dark side.

920
01:52:03,321 --> 01:52:07,366
<i>It is the only way
you can save your friends.</i>

921
01:52:08,409 --> 01:52:10,117
Yes.

922
01:52:10,245 --> 01:52:12,201
Your thoughts betray you.

923
01:52:12,329 --> 01:52:14,867
Your feelings for them are strong...

924
01:52:14,999 --> 01:52:16,872
especially for...

925
01:52:19,045 --> 01:52:20,705
sister.

926
01:52:21,964 --> 01:52:26,294
So you have a twin sister.

927
01:52:26,427 --> 01:52:30,127
Your feelings have now
betrayed her too.

928
01:52:30,264 --> 01:52:34,344
Obi-Wan was wise
to hide her from me.

929
01:52:34,476 --> 01:52:38,854
Now his failure is complete.

930
01:52:40,357 --> 01:52:44,141
If you will not turn
to the dark side...

931
01:52:44,277 --> 01:52:47,065
then perhaps she will.

932
01:52:47,197 --> 01:52:48,110
Never!

933
01:53:33,743 --> 01:53:35,451
Good!

934
01:53:39,791 --> 01:53:42,495
Your hate has made you powerful.

935
01:53:43,794 --> 01:53:48,670
Now, fulfil your destiny...

936
01:53:48,799 --> 01:53:52,879
and take your father's place at my side.

937
01:54:07,943 --> 01:54:09,272
Never.

938
01:54:12,322 --> 01:54:14,480
I'll never turn to the dark side.

939
01:54:17,452 --> 01:54:20,287
You've failed, Your Highness.

940
01:54:20,414 --> 01:54:22,371
I am a Jedi...

941
01:54:22,499 --> 01:54:24,539
like my father before me.

942
01:54:32,133 --> 01:54:35,585
So be it,Jedi.

943
01:54:35,804 --> 01:54:37,677
Move! Move!

944
01:54:50,318 --> 01:54:54,185
The shield is down. Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor.

945
01:54:54,322 --> 01:54:58,070
We're on our way. Red Group,
Gold Group, all fighters follow me.

946
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:00,109
I told you they'd do it.

947
01:55:07,251 --> 01:55:09,872
If you will not be turned...

948
01:55:10,003 --> 01:55:13,337
<i>you will be destroyed.</i>

949
01:55:20,514 --> 01:55:22,092
Young fool.

950
01:55:23,184 --> 01:55:25,887
Only now, at the end...

951
01:55:26,019 --> 01:55:27,893
do you understand.

952
01:55:41,117 --> 01:55:46,871
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.

953
01:55:50,710 --> 01:55:54,542
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.

954
01:56:00,136 --> 01:56:01,963
Father, please!

955
01:56:17,278 --> 01:56:19,436
Now, young Skywalker...

956
01:56:21,574 --> 01:56:23,401
<i>you will die.</i>

957
01:57:46,457 --> 01:57:47,915
I'm going in.

958
01:57:51,086 --> 01:57:52,285
Here goes nothing.

959
01:57:59,386 --> 01:58:03,253
Lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.

960
01:58:05,475 --> 01:58:08,926
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.

961
01:58:24,618 --> 01:58:26,611
Split up and head back to the surface.

962
01:58:26,746 --> 01:58:29,913
See if you can get a few
of those TIE fighters to follow you.

963
01:58:30,041 --> 01:58:30,990
Copy, Gold Leader.

964
01:58:41,302 --> 01:58:42,879
That was too close.

965
01:58:46,891 --> 01:58:49,049
We've got to give
those fighters more time.

966
01:58:49,185 --> 01:58:52,220
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Stardestroyer.

967
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:00,483
Sir, we've lost our
bridge deflector shields.

968
01:59:00,612 --> 01:59:03,614
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.

969
01:59:06,118 --> 01:59:07,861
Intensify forward firepower!

970
01:59:09,704 --> 01:59:10,902
Too late!

971
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,867
Help me take this mask off.

972
02:00:00,004 --> 02:00:01,878
But you'll die.

973
02:00:02,757 --> 02:00:06,255
Nothing can stop that now.

974
02:00:07,344 --> 02:00:08,969
Just for once...

975
02:00:09,930 --> 02:00:11,555
let me...

976
02:00:11,682 --> 02:00:15,133
look on you with my own eyes.

977
02:00:51,387 --> 02:00:55,765
Now go, my son.

978
02:00:57,477 --> 02:00:58,888
Leave me.

979
02:00:59,979 --> 02:01:02,435
No. You're coming with me.

980
02:01:02,565 --> 02:01:04,891
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

981
02:01:05,776 --> 02:01:09,477
You already have, Luke.

982
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:12,530
You were right.

983
02:01:13,326 --> 02:01:15,651
You were right about me.

984
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:19,372
Tell your sister...

985
02:01:20,415 --> 02:01:22,622
<i>you were right.</i>

986
02:01:29,717 --> 02:01:30,796
Father.

987
02:01:35,138 --> 02:01:36,467
I won't leave you.

988
02:02:01,915 --> 02:02:02,911
There it is.

989
02:02:05,877 --> 02:02:08,249
Wedge, go for the power regulator
on the north tower.

990
02:02:08,379 --> 02:02:11,665
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

991
02:02:30,902 --> 02:02:34,022
Move the fleet
away from the Death Star.

992
02:03:21,242 --> 02:03:22,902
They did it!

993
02:03:31,378 --> 02:03:33,785
I'm sure Luke wasn't
on that thing when it blew.

994
02:03:35,548 --> 02:03:37,375
He wasn't.

995
02:03:37,508 --> 02:03:39,168
I can feel it.

996
02:03:43,848 --> 02:03:45,426
You love him.

997
02:03:48,852 --> 02:03:50,263
Don't you?

998
02:03:50,396 --> 02:03:51,855
Yes.

999
02:03:51,981 --> 02:03:54,686
All right. I understand.

1000
02:03:54,817 --> 02:03:56,192
Fine.

1001
02:03:57,236 --> 02:03:59,028
When he comes back...

1002
02:04:00,114 --> 02:04:01,858
I won't get in the way.

1003
02:04:04,576 --> 02:04:06,534
It's not like that at all.

1004
02:04:10,249 --> 02:04:12,574
He's my brother.

1005
02:05:54,184 --> 02:05:55,809
Wesa free!
