00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,887
Welcome back.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,695

00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:29,229
<i>Yeah!</i>

5
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,398
<i>Are you ready</i>
<i>to start the show?</i>

6
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,067
<i>Yeah!</i>

7
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,938
<i>Don't forget to</i>
<i>stay around till the very end</i>

8
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:41,408
<i>for a great big surprise.</i>

9
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,311
<i>Here we go!</i>

10
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,080
<i>Count with me now.</i>

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,651
<i>Ten, nine,</i>

12
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:53,555

13
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:56,824
<i>five, four, three,</i>

14
00:00:56,925 --> 00:00:59,159
<i>two, one.</i>

15
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,395
<i>Showtime!</i>

16
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,077
All right, this one?

17
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,847
-Come on!
-So close!

18
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,819
Oh, cool!

19
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,091
Hey.

20
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,696
Thank you, honey.

21
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,411
You seriously just gonna sit
here till the trapdoors open?

22
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,446
Leave her alone.

23
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:54,381
She does this every time
she's here.

24
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,216
Come on.

25
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:04,859
You look like someone
who could use a Freddy Fazcola.

26
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:12,265
Ew. Tastes like gasoline.

27
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,470
It doesn't come out for a while.

28
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:19,841
Why don't you come back to
the table and hang out with us?

29
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:21,776
They don't want me there.

30
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:23,111
No one does.

31
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,079
You just got
a bad roll of the dice.

32
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,814
Things will get better.

33
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,452
She's the only one
I can rely on.

34
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:35,623
She's the only one
who's always here for me.

35
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:38,458
That... thing down there

36
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:42,964
isn't your spirit parent
or whatever you think it is.

37
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:44,932
And it'll still be there

38
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:46,968
even if you go have
a piece of cake first.

-There's a boy who needs help.
-Go tell your parents.

46
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:22,737
Please, there's something wrong.

47
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:24,872
Go tell your parents!

48
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,910
Sir, please.
There's somebody who needs help.

00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,111
-Not right now.
-Please.

50
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,179
Not right now.

51
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,480
Will anybody help me?

52
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,650
There's a little boy
who needs help.

53
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:37,685
-Please help me.
-I'm sorry. Adults are talking.

54
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:38,986
Run along.

55
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:44,291
Charlotte! Don't.

56
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,198
Hello?

57
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,366
Hey, it's me.

58
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:53,567
Mike.

59
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,269
What time is it?

60
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,405
Oh, uh, it's early. Sorry.

61
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,508
-Did I... did I wake you up?
-No.

62
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:03,210
I mean, yes, you did, but, uh...

63
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,746
<i>I had a rough night.</i>

64
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,548
Bad dreams again or...?

65
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:10,451
-I can't seem to catch a break.
-Mm.

66
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,053
Anything that I can do to help?

67
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:13,287
No, I'm fine.

68
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:14,555
How is your day going?

69
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,190
Abby off to school?

70
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,794
Uh, not yet. She's, uh...
she's around here somewhere.

71
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:21,695
Jeremiah's on his way over
to help me

72
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:23,364
keep painting the new house.

73
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:24,698
-Great.
-Um...

74
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,367
I just wanted to see
if we were...

75
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:28,102
we're still good for...
for dinner later.

76
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:30,471
Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,772
Definitely.

78
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,808
It'll be good to get out.

79
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:35,743
Um, hey, I got to run,

80
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,378
but I'll, uh...
I'll see you later, then.

81
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:39,880
-Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

82
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:46,454
So, have you kissed her yet?

83
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:47,922
No.

84
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:49,558
Abs, it's not...
it's not like that.

85
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:51,392
We're-we're just friends.

86
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:53,294
Then why are you going
on a date?

87
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,931
-It's not a date.
-Then why can't I come along?

88
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,567
Because you can't.

89
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,303
That's what I thought.

90
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:03,737
Abby!

91
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,540
The Abbittyville Horror.

92
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,374
The Abbster. Word up.

93
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,611
What's happening?
You're growing like a weed.

94
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:11,912
Uh, I got to run.

95
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,614
You sure you don't want
to stay and paint?

96
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:14,815
I'll trade places with you.

97
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:18,252
Thanks, but I think
they'd notice at school.

98
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:19,887
-Probably.
-Bye.

99
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,189
-See you later.
-Bryson!

100
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,725
Bryson, wait. You dropped this.

101
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,595
You know, she's a good kid.

102
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,195
She is.

103
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,297
She's got a really good heart.

104
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,900
So, you still going on
that date with Vanessa later?

105
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:35,302
It's not a date.

106
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,770
Just a couple of adults

107
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,439
having dinner together,
you know?

108
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:40,307
Mm.

109
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:45,079
Listen, I wish you two
all the happiness in the world.

110
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:50,151
All I'm saying is
she's got crazy eyes, Mike.

111
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:53,754
She's not crazy, okay?

112
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,258
Ooh, speaking of crazy.

113
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,792
Ever since your aunt went around

114
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:00,995
telling stories
about killer teddy bears,

115
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,963
the whole damn town's
lost its mind.

116
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,865
You know, I'll be happy
when this weekend's over,

117
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,535
all the festival stuff's done

118
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:08,570
and people maybe just
will go back to normal.

119
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,872
Yeah. People are obsessed
with that old pizzeria.

120
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:14,308
Yeah, I heard they had
your aunt committed, by the way.

121
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:16,076
That's terrible.

122
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,345
Yeah, it's a real shame.

123
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,481
Hey, you sure your aunt
just made those stories up,

124
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:22,449
like, out of the blue?

125
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,151
Hey, you know what?
Why don't we just

126
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,487
keep it between you and me that
Abby's even related to her?

127
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:27,888
You know,
she's been through a lot,

128
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,124
and she doesn't like
that kind of attention.

129
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:32,693
So then Chica tried to shove me
into a springlock suit.

130
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,663
But then Mike came in,
and he had a Taser,

131
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,531
and he shot her
in the face with it.

132
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:38,199
I ran for the dining room

133
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,801
just as Foxy came off the stage
and started chasing me down.

134
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:43,003
Luckily, Vanessa saved me.

135
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:47,174
But then the Yellow Rabbit came,
and he attacked us.

136
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,409
He got Vanessa.

137
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,110
He stabbed her.

138
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:51,445
She's okay now.

139
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:53,682
So, what happened
to the Yellow Rabbit?

140
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:56,250
The springlocks went off
inside of his own suit

141
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,918
and crushed him alive.

142
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:01,088
They say his body's
still at Freddy's,

143
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:04,992
hidden in a secret room
that nobody's ever seen.

144
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,328
You're crazy.

145
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,998
Want to sit with us at lunch?

146
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,134
Sure.

147
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:16,638
Are you ever gonna go back?

148
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,373
To Freddy's, I mean.

149
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:22,409
I would, but...

150
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,378
my friends...

151
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:25,846
the animatronics are broken.

152
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:29,850
Mike says that
he'll fix them someday, but...

153
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,853
he's been saying that
for a while now.

154
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:36,890
Wait, so do you actually
believe anything I'm saying?

155
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,859
'Cause I'm pretty sure
everyone else just thinks

156
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,828
I'm making this stuff up.

157
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,598
I believe in UFOs.

158
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:45,366
And ghosts.

159
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,802
So why not haunted animatronics?

160
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,471
Young ladies,
young men, let's go.

161
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:52,206
Yeah.

162
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,649
Everyone, eyes to me.

163
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:04,285
I just want to, uh, remind you

164
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:07,488
that our robotics presentation
at the science fair

165
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:09,990
is this Saturday.

166
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,827
Some of you have been swept up

167
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:17,599
in the stupidity that is
this Freddy Fest.

168
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:21,335
Actually, Mr. Berg,
it's Fazfest.

169
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:23,003
I don't care what it's called.

170
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:26,974
It's a mockery of everything
that true robotics stands for.

171
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,711
We're making real robots here,
people.

172
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,812
I want each and every one of you

173
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,914
to be at that science fair
on Saturday,

174
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,551
whether you're entering or not.

175
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:39,788
Or you can expect
a big, fat "F."

176
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,356
"F" for "Fazfest"?

177
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:43,857
No.

178
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,459
"F" for "fail."

179
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,563
Don't waste your time.

180
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,364
Let's get to work.

181
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,174
Miss Schmidt.

182
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:04,813
According to this,
you're planning on showing

183
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:08,215
whatever this is
Saturday at the science fair.

184
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,084
Certainly,
I don't have to remind you

185
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,688
how important this event is
to the school.

186
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:16,390
We're defending
a three-year winning streak.

187
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,892
I'll be ready.

188
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,362
Yeah, th-that's just the thing.

189
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,497
I don't think you will be ready.

190
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:29,136
Miss Schmidt,
robotics isn't for everyone.

191
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:31,806
There's no shame
in taking a seat

192
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,675
for the good of the team.

193
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:37,512
Look, look, look, what's our...
what's our school motto?

194
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:39,614
"Otters otter help each otter."

195
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:41,281
Right.

196
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,718
Right.

197
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:46,086
Be a good little otter.

198
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:56,564
He's rough on everyone.
Don't let him get to you.

199
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:05,139
I'm surprised you haven't tried
to fix your friends yourself.

200
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,908
I bet you could.

201
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,016
-Abs, is that you?
-Yeah.

202
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,819
All right. Perfect timing.

203
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,187
You want to do this for me?

204
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,558
You're hopeless.

205
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:26,260
How was your day?

206
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,762
Fine.

207
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:29,764
Uh, anything exciting happen?

208
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:32,366
Not really.

209
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,201
Okay.

210
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:37,806
There.

211
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,607
What would you do without me?

212
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:43,444
Thank you very much.

213
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:45,847
Okay. Uh...

214
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:49,383
Abs, I'm leaving a...
a 20 on the table

215
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,218
so you can...
you can order a pizza.

216
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,621
You remember how to call
and everything?

217
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:55,590
Of course. I'm 11.

218
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,224
I'm not a baby.

219
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,392
I know. I know.

220
00:15:58,526 --> 00:16:00,862
Anything else you need from me
before I go?

221
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:03,430
You gonna watch some TV or what?

222
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:08,703
Maybe I could go see my friends.

223
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:14,241
You mean, like,
your friends from school?

224
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:17,812
I meant Chica and the others.

225
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,714
Those friends.

226
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:22,983
Look, Abs, we talked about this.

227
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:25,520
Okay, you can't go back there.

228
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,254
They're broken.

229
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,358
Now, one day,
I'm gonna go fix them,

230
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,427
but until then,
maybe you could try

231
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:35,730
making some friends
with some real kids.

232
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,900
My friends are real kids.

233
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:43,370
We are in
the haunted courthouse.

234
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,878
Did you guys hear that?

235
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,713
Hear what?

236
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:53,548
Look, you're right.

237
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:56,718
Abs, I'm sorry, okay?

238
00:16:56,818 --> 00:16:58,151
It's just,
it's-it's complicated,

239
00:16:58,218 --> 00:16:59,787
but we can talk about it later.

240
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,121
I have to go.

241
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,557
Yeah.

242
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:08,863
I love you.

243
00:17:08,997 --> 00:17:10,798
Mm-hmm.

244
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,969
All right, don't-don't watch
too much of that show.

245
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,170
It'll give you nightmares, okay?

246
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:23,443
I'll be back later.

247
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,604
-Pardon me, sir.
-Mm. Oh.

248
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:51,138
There we are.

249
00:17:51,773 --> 00:17:53,541
Thank you.

250
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:58,813
Hi.

251
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:06,486
So this is what it's like?

252
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:07,755
What?

253
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:09,356
Being normal.

254
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:11,325
Normal?

255
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,226
Is that... Are we...
We're normal now?

256
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,763
I think we're doing pretty good,

257
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,365
considering what
we've been through.

258
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,070
I just have too much time
on my hands.

259
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,672
It'll be better
when I can get back to work.

260
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:26,007
No, I think you're doing great.

261
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,909
I mean, didn't you...
you signed up for, like,

262
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:29,911
like, biking classes,
right, or...

263
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:31,278
-Spin class.
-Spin class. Yeah, yeah.

264
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,047
I've been going
a couple of weeks.

265
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,749
-Okay.
-I even made some friends.

266
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:36,416
Friends.

267
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:39,319
What's that like?

268
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,258
-Pardon my reach, madam.
-Oh.

269
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,864
They... they love
doing that here.

270
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:55,670
Um, you-you look great,
by the way.

271
00:18:59,574 --> 00:19:00,808
So do you.

272
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:05,145
-This is a date.
-What?

273
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:07,682
-What?
-Did you say something?

274
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:09,951
No, I-I said... I said this is
a... a lovely day, a day.

275
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:11,753
-Day. Today's been a great day.
-Yeah.

276
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:16,423
Let me guess--
Abby tie that for you?

277
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,226
-She did. Yeah.
-How is she?

278
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,962
She's good.
Well, some days are good.

279
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:23,363
Some days, she, uh...

280
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:28,201
...she really misses them--
her "friends"--

281
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:32,372
and, uh, I don't know
how to talk to her about it.

282
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,375
I know you're trying
to protect her, Mike,

283
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,612
but this story
that they're broken,

284
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:40,014
that you're gonna fix
those animatronics,

285
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:42,482
it's only giving her false hope.

286
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,317
Just be honest.

287
00:19:45,086 --> 00:19:46,453
Honest?

288
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:48,823
What?

289
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:50,457
Uh, nothing.

290
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:57,330
So, you want to...
tell me about your bad dream?

291
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,466
It's always the same.

292
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:01,903
We don't need to talk
about that.

293
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:03,671
Your dad?

294
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:06,239
Look, Vanessa, I was thinking,
do you remember how I would

295
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,242
use my dreams to confront
what happened with Garrett?

296
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:12,212
I mean, I admit I probably
slept a bit too much,

297
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,749
but it really helped me a lot.

298
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,884
I think it can help you, too.

299
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,352
I...

300
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:22,422
I-I don't think
that's a good idea.

301
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:26,493
You're never gonna be free
of your dad

302
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:29,463
until you deal with some of
the mess he left in your head.

303
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:33,601
I just... I want us to be able
to move past all of this.

304
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:35,770
You can do it.

305
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,071
At least try.

306
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:39,306
Just once.

307
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:45,378
Abs, I'm back.

308
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:52,120
Abby.

309
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:54,021
Abs, did you eat?

310
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:57,525
Abby? Abby?

311
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:01,095
Abby!

312
00:22:00,755 --> 00:22:02,056
Hey.

313
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:06,527
Abs, I'm sorry. I...

314
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:08,729
I didn't know how to tell you.

315
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:12,066
Where are they?

316
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:14,769
I mean, there's...

317
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:17,505
pieces of them here,
pieces of them there.

318
00:22:17,572 --> 00:22:20,074
No, that's not what I mean.

319
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,109
Where are my friends?

320
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:29,083
Look, Abs, I, um...

321
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:33,386
I don't know.

322
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:36,824
You know, maybe, um...

323
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,960
maybe they're in heaven.

324
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:42,462
Wouldn't you want that for them?

325
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:44,098
Yeah.

326
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:46,534
I would like that.

327
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,605
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner, okay?

328
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:53,473
But you know what?

329
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:57,044
They're always gonna be
right here.

330
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:02,683
That's really cheesy.

331
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:06,988
-Yeah, it's a little cheesy.
-It's extremely cheesy.

332
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,590
All right, all right, all right.

333
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:12,260
You know what?

334
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,862
Come with me. I got an idea.

335
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:17,231
Okay, young lady.

336
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:20,768
You have one million tickets.

337
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:23,436
What can I get you?
Do you want some, uh... Oh.

338
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:26,207
What about orange gummy candies?

339
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:28,042
No?

340
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:29,677
Okay.

341
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,647
Uh, we got...

342
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,451
Uh, let's see. Oh.

343
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,554
What about this?

344
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:46,560
Oh. Oh, maybe not.

345
00:23:58,306 --> 00:23:59,807
What you got there?

346
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:01,943
It's a... FazTalker.

347
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:04,477
"Realistic voice
interaction device.

348
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,247
Talk to us anytime."

349
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:08,049
Is that what you want?

350
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:11,285
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

351
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:13,187
Sold. One million tickets.

352
00:24:14,922 --> 00:24:16,456
Let's go home.

353
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:20,394
I thought you liked
orange gummy candy.

354
00:24:20,528 --> 00:24:24,165
Well, I did until I ate
that whole bag at Christmas.

355
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:26,200
Oh. And you threw it up
everywhere.

356
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,467
Yeah.

357
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:29,870
That was like an orange
slime waterfall.

358
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:32,006
-It was really rough.
-Don't remind me.

359
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:12,179
You sure I'm going
the right way?

360
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:13,681
Uh, yeah.

361
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:15,483
No, it should be up ahead.

362
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:19,520
How'd you guys find out
about this place again?

363
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:21,889
Security guard who works there.

364
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:23,657
His name is... Mike?

365
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:26,460
I don't care who he is,
as long as we have permission.

366
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:29,230
Trust me, we have
VIP treatment this time.

367
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,198
No breaking and entering
required.

368
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:36,370
Yeah, there. There it is.

369
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,395
Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.

370
00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:04,231
I used to come here
when I was a kid.

371
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:05,900
Not this one you didn't.

372
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,335
You're thinking of
the franchise location.

373
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:12,773
This is the original.

374
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:15,376
Nobody's been here for decades.

375
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:18,312
This location came
before the other one.

376
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:21,215
So, what happened here?

377
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:23,617
Some little girl got murdered.

378
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:25,319
Whole thing got swept
under the rug.

379
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:26,821
And now...

380
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:29,690
her soul wanders
these forgotten halls,

381
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:31,459
tortured and alone.

382
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:36,730
Dude.

383
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:41,001
Uh, sorry. You startled us.

384
00:26:42,403 --> 00:26:44,271
You must be Mike.

385
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:46,941
It's Michael, actually.

386
00:26:50,512 --> 00:26:52,379
Call me Michael.

387
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:58,219
So?

388
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,187
Are you ready for the tour?

389
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:16,036
Welcome to Freddy's.

390
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:19,974
You're cool
if we record everything?

391
00:27:20,074 --> 00:27:21,308
Of course.

392
00:27:22,343 --> 00:27:24,378
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

393
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:29,049
No way. They had a boat ride?

394
00:27:30,084 --> 00:27:33,354
This restaurant had a lot
of unique features.

395
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:35,422
Like the Marionette.

396
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,661
You did your homework.

397
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:42,597
Yeah.

398
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,733
The Marionette truly was
one of a kind.

399
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,935
What's the Marionette?

400
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:50,539
The Marionette would come out
of this trapdoor on the stage

401
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,072
and direct
the other animatronics

402
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:54,141
-during performances.
-That's right.

403
00:27:54,275 --> 00:27:56,110
Using a wireless signal.

404
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,548
The technology was way ahead
of its time, but...

405
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,949
they never made another one.

406
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:05,319
Shall we?

407
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:39,853
Whoa.

408
00:28:44,858 --> 00:28:46,595
They look brand-new.

409
00:28:46,695 --> 00:28:50,764
Freddy, Bonnie and Chica.

410
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:54,068
Uh, what about Foxy?

411
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:56,804
Oh. Foxy was involved in

412
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,974
a failed take-apart,
put-back-together attraction

413
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:03,377
and was never
quite the same again.

414
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:07,448
Kids can be so heartless.

415
00:29:14,488 --> 00:29:16,223
You guys hear that?

416
00:29:20,127 --> 00:29:22,863
It was, like... music or...

417
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:26,233
Uh, fair warning:

418
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,004
This place will prey on
your imagination if you let it.

419
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:33,073
Shall we continue?

420
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:36,711
Hey. I'm gonna catch up
to you guys.

421
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,381
I don't know, I wanted
to look around a little bit.

422
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:44,018
Mikey boy, let's, uh...
let's get the show on the road.

423
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:46,453
I'm burning valuable tape here.

424
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:51,959
What do we, uh...
what do we got over here?

425
00:30:43,745 --> 00:30:45,513
Shit!

426
00:30:53,722 --> 00:30:54,988
What the hell?

427
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:57,257
What kind of kid
would want to come here?

428
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:59,493
"Kids Cove."

429
00:31:00,762 --> 00:31:02,329
Awesome.

430
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:06,133
You know, I think this might be
our best episode yet.

431
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:12,005
Yeah, usually,
we got to play it up, you know.

432
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:14,007
We have to make it
something it's not,

433
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:17,010
but this place is actually
pretty creepy.

434
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:46,366
Lisa?

435
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,073
Wh-What did you do?

436
00:32:53,842 --> 00:32:55,743
What did you do?

437
00:32:58,813 --> 00:33:01,883
Lisa? Lisa, I-I'm coming.
Where are you?

438
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:13,962
Hello?

439
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:15,830
N-N-N-N-N-No, no!

440
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,805
What the hell was that?

441
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:32,514
Where'd they all go?

442
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:43,023
Shit, shit, shit.

443
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:55,369
No, no, no!

444
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,375
Welcome back, Charlotte.

445
00:35:18,052 --> 00:35:19,353
Come on.

446
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:21,656
Please work.
Please work. Please work.

447
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:22,991
Please.

448
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:36,403
I miss you guys.

449
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:43,678
Hello?

450
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:45,747
Can you guys hear me?

451
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:51,351
Chica, can you hear me?

452
00:35:54,722 --> 00:35:56,924
I need you.

453
00:35:57,925 --> 00:36:00,360
I miss you all so much.

454
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:11,806
All right, all right.

455
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:13,273
Welcome to the class, you guys.

456
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:14,776
Today I got a plan for you all,

457
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:16,611
so we're gonna get you guys
nice and warmed up.

458
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:20,114
Whenever you are ready,
go ahead and turn to the right.

459
00:36:20,213 --> 00:36:22,282
Keep pedaling.

460
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:25,119
I'm glad you decided
to join us again.

461
00:36:25,218 --> 00:36:27,421
You can do this.

462
00:36:28,656 --> 00:36:30,357
Feel your core start to engage.

463
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,226
Another full turn to the right.

464
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:36,363
♪ When I see out of
the corner of my eye ♪

465
00:36:36,531 --> 00:36:38,533
♪ "Look who's here"
and "How you doing?" ♪

466
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:41,368
♪ Why don't you tell me
who let you in... ♪

467
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:45,006
Feel your quads
start to activate.

468
00:36:45,073 --> 00:36:47,975
Three, two, one,
turn to the right.

469
00:36:48,076 --> 00:36:49,476
One, two, one, two.

470
00:36:49,577 --> 00:36:51,713
One, two, one two.
Again. This is your moment.

471
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:53,181
Be here. Be present.

472
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:54,247
<i>-Faster.</i>
-You can do this.

473
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:56,050
Push it all away.

474
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,618
<i>Faster.</i>

475
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:06,226
<i>Faster.</i>

476
00:37:08,328 --> 00:37:09,831
<i>Faster!</i>

477
00:37:31,886 --> 00:37:35,322
Please. Vanessa, easy.

478
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:21,936
You can do this.

479
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:25,940
You can do this.

480
00:39:34,342 --> 00:39:35,843
Dad?

481
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:42,049
I'm not afraid of you.

482
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:48,122
I don't need you anymore.

483
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:56,030
I am nothing like you.

484
00:40:03,537 --> 00:40:05,573
No, no, no. Come on.

485
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,641
Help me!

486
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:19,220
I'm not done with you.

487
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,822
You can't keep me here.

488
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:24,457
I'm leaving.

489
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:27,995
Don't you know
you're my favorite?

490
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:31,431
Don't you know that I love you?

491
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:35,937
Don't you know
that I care about you?

492
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:44,111
Oh.

493
00:40:48,983 --> 00:40:51,052
You are my child.

494
00:40:51,152 --> 00:40:54,454
You have a purpose.

495
00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:24,118
Where are you gonna run to?

496
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:49,810
You will always be mine.

497
00:41:49,944 --> 00:41:51,012
No!

498
00:42:16,837 --> 00:42:19,807
You shall always be mine.

499
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:45,866
A...

500
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:49,970
B-B-Y.

501
00:42:53,441 --> 00:42:56,110
Abby, help us.

502
00:42:57,478 --> 00:42:59,346
Chica?

503
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:02,216
Chica, Chica, is that you?

504
00:43:02,316 --> 00:43:05,119
Yes. Please help us.

505
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:07,088
Where are you?

506
00:43:07,188 --> 00:43:09,857
Come find me.

507
00:43:09,924 --> 00:43:11,158
How?

508
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:14,995
I will show you the way.

509
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:52,766
Hurry.

510
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,035
We are all waiting for you.

511
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:12,987
Whoa.

512
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:31,939
What is this place?

513
00:44:39,581 --> 00:44:41,282
Chica?

514
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:44,218
Freddy?

515
00:44:47,488 --> 00:44:49,323
Bonnie?

516
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:58,432
Chica?

517
00:44:58,465 --> 00:45:01,902
Abby, you've come back to us.

518
00:45:02,002 --> 00:45:03,904
Chica!

519
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,510
I've missed you so much.

520
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,978
I've missed you, too.

521
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:13,548
How did you get this new body?

522
00:45:13,648 --> 00:45:15,716
Do you like it?

523
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:19,853
It's neat, but it's...

524
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:23,457
different and kind of cold.

525
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:26,393
You said you needed my help?

526
00:45:26,493 --> 00:45:28,896
We do, but right now,

527
00:45:28,963 --> 00:45:32,099
what matters is
we're together again.

528
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:06,433
Mike?

529
00:46:08,402 --> 00:46:10,170
Mike?

530
00:46:20,347 --> 00:46:22,383
Abby?

531
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:34,928
Gotcha!

532
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:38,265
Haven't you ever played
hide-and-seek?

533
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:40,467
First rule is
always check behind the doors.

534
00:46:40,568 --> 00:46:42,169
Right.

535
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:44,805
-Where is your brother?
-Getting breakfast.

536
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:46,807
Do you want to see
my science fair project?

537
00:46:46,874 --> 00:46:49,209
It's finally done.

538
00:46:50,578 --> 00:46:51,879
Wow.

539
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:53,947
You made this all by yourself?

540
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:56,751
Well, no. Chica helped.

541
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:00,655
Freddy tried,
but his fingers were too fat.

542
00:47:00,689 --> 00:47:02,956
Pretty cool, right?

543
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:05,025
Very cool.

544
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:07,928
You said Freddy and Chica
helped you?

545
00:47:08,028 --> 00:47:10,532
Yeah, in their old house,
last night.

546
00:47:10,598 --> 00:47:12,099
It's so neat.

547
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:15,670
It's got a play area for
little kids and even a river.

548
00:47:15,737 --> 00:47:17,739
Wait. A river?

549
00:47:17,871 --> 00:47:19,273
Abs, I'm back.

550
00:47:19,406 --> 00:47:20,508
Breakfast!

551
00:47:30,652 --> 00:47:32,286
Hey. Uh, they didn't
have chocolate,

552
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,389
so I got banana
and, uh, blueberry.

553
00:47:36,591 --> 00:47:38,760
What do we got here?

554
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:40,729
Hey. These are cool.

555
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:42,564
These are really good, Abs.

556
00:47:42,664 --> 00:47:44,833
Vanessa's here.

557
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:47,368
-Hey.
-Hey.

558
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:50,337
We need to talk.

559
00:47:51,606 --> 00:47:53,207
Yeah, we do.

560
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:56,944
What is this?
I don't understand.

561
00:47:56,977 --> 00:47:59,781
Yeah, neither did I
until I called the number.

562
00:47:59,913 --> 00:48:02,650
Listen, we really need
to talk about Abby.

563
00:48:02,784 --> 00:48:05,520
She said she's been
with Freddy and Chica.

564
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,488
Yeah, it's just
this toy she has,

565
00:48:07,622 --> 00:48:08,857
this new Faz-speaker thing.

566
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:10,290
No, she said she saw them.

567
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:12,025
-She said she went somewhere.
-Okay.

568
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:13,862
You know, Vanessa, I-I've...

569
00:48:13,994 --> 00:48:17,030
I've been trying really hard
to-to move forward.

570
00:48:17,097 --> 00:48:20,134
-I know, but, Mike...
-Um, no, listen.

571
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,971
How can I move forward when
it's one thing after another?

572
00:48:24,104 --> 00:48:26,875
Look, I hear you. I do.
It's just what Abby said...

573
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:28,510
Abby's just a kid.

574
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:31,445
And right now she's hurting
and she misses her friends,

575
00:48:31,546 --> 00:48:33,347
and there's nothing
that I can do to help her.

576
00:48:33,414 --> 00:48:35,850
The same way that
I couldn't help Garrett.

577
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:38,753
Or-or the other kids
at Freddy's.

578
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:41,121
Other kids like Charlotte.

579
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:44,992
How do you...

580
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:47,194
Her dad made that flyer.

581
00:48:48,228 --> 00:48:49,631
And so I called him, and he...

582
00:48:49,731 --> 00:48:51,800
and he told me about
his little girl

583
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,735
and her best friend Vanessa.

584
00:48:55,737 --> 00:48:56,970
Wh-Why didn't you tell me

585
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:59,039
that there were other victims,
other kids?

586
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:01,609
My father was a monster.
You know that.

587
00:49:01,676 --> 00:49:05,012
Look, a-all I'm trying to do is
I'm trying to fix my family.

588
00:49:05,078 --> 00:49:06,748
I'm trying to fix
the situation for Abby.

589
00:49:06,848 --> 00:49:07,981
I'm trying to fix you,

590
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:10,284
-and-and I don't...
-Wait. W-Wait.

591
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,688
Is that what this
has been about?

592
00:49:13,788 --> 00:49:15,489
No.

593
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:19,226
You're trying to fix me?

594
00:49:23,363 --> 00:49:25,966
You know what?
I can take care of myself.

595
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:28,302
You just need
to watch out for Abby.

596
00:49:45,052 --> 00:49:47,354
Hey, Abs, um...

597
00:49:47,488 --> 00:49:49,557
do you think that
you can get set up without me?

598
00:49:49,691 --> 00:49:50,959
You're not coming?

599
00:49:51,058 --> 00:49:52,459
No, no, I'm... yeah,
I'm coming. I just, uh...

600
00:49:52,594 --> 00:49:54,027
I just have to go
do something real quick,

601
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:55,429
but I-I'll be back
before it starts.

602
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:57,632
-Don't be too long, though.
-Okay.

603
00:49:57,732 --> 00:50:00,367
Hey. You're gonna do great.

604
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:02,670
Thanks.

605
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:29,557
Charlotte?

606
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:34,494
It's just me, Vanessa.

607
00:51:36,764 --> 00:51:39,299
Are you here
to put me back to sleep?

608
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:42,336
I know what you want.

609
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:46,507
You want to get out of here
so that you can hurt people.

610
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:49,777
The way that they hurt you.

611
00:51:52,847 --> 00:51:54,147
But I can't let that happen.

612
00:51:54,247 --> 00:51:56,249
I'm out of the box.

613
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:00,387
But you still
have me trapped here.

614
00:52:00,487 --> 00:52:02,056
Somehow.

615
00:52:02,155 --> 00:52:04,257
It's called a perimeter lock.

616
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:07,194
None of the animatronics
can leave.

617
00:52:08,161 --> 00:52:10,531
Not even you.

618
00:52:10,632 --> 00:52:12,734
But you can fix that.

619
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:15,703
I'm not gonna do that.

620
00:52:15,803 --> 00:52:19,774
That's okay. I have another
friend who can help me now.

621
00:52:20,608 --> 00:52:24,779
I don't hate you, but you need
to stay out of my way.

622
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,287
You're gonna be great,
honey. Don't worry.

623
00:52:56,744 --> 00:52:58,146
Excuse me.

624
00:52:58,211 --> 00:53:00,848
Uh, Abby.

625
00:53:00,948 --> 00:53:02,416
Do you know where my booth is?

626
00:53:02,482 --> 00:53:06,186
Uh, uh, I thought you decided
not to participate.

627
00:53:06,988 --> 00:53:09,757
Yeah, it's a little late
to be setting up.

628
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:11,125
No, it's not. Look.

629
00:53:11,258 --> 00:53:13,161
-I can set up over there.
-Look, uh,

630
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,963
I just don't want you
to be embarrassed, Abby.

631
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,765
Why would I be embarrassed?

632
00:53:17,832 --> 00:53:20,267
I'm proud of my project.

633
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:22,870
Of course you are. Yeah.

634
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:24,639
So am I. Here, let me...

635
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:27,141
Let's just find the perfect
place to display it.

636
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,810
Oh!

637
00:53:31,145 --> 00:53:33,147
Oh! Oh, oh, sorry.

638
00:53:33,246 --> 00:53:34,849
I'm so, so sorry, Abby.

639
00:53:34,982 --> 00:53:37,618
I-I got, uh, butterfingers. I...

640
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:39,087
I tell you what I'll do.

641
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:41,656
I'll give you full credit
for the class.

642
00:53:41,756 --> 00:53:45,292
And this way, you can just
go home, and... and...

643
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:47,962
I'll take out this trash.

644
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,001
You're such a dick, Mr. Berg.

645
00:53:54,102 --> 00:53:55,970
Who said that?

646
00:54:16,023 --> 00:54:18,126
Abby, what's wrong?

647
00:54:18,192 --> 00:54:20,862
Mr. Berg, he...

648
00:54:21,028 --> 00:54:23,898
he destroyed
my science fair project.

649
00:54:24,866 --> 00:54:27,668
I'll be your science project.

650
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:29,170
You'd do that for me?

651
00:54:29,237 --> 00:54:30,437
Of course.

652
00:54:30,571 --> 00:54:31,973
Well, come on. We got to hurry.

653
00:54:32,106 --> 00:54:34,242
But first...

654
00:54:34,341 --> 00:54:36,744
I need you to do
something for me.

655
00:54:36,811 --> 00:54:40,615
Remember how I said
we needed your help?

656
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:52,960
There is a secret code
that will let me come with you.

657
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:57,064
Will you enter it for me?

658
00:55:00,268 --> 00:55:01,836
Okay.

659
00:55:20,955 --> 00:55:22,256
N-No!

660
00:55:22,355 --> 00:55:23,724
-No!
-If you don't give me

661
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:26,227
the command to release
the perimeter lock,

662
00:55:26,326 --> 00:55:28,129
I will kill her.

663
00:55:28,196 --> 00:55:31,464
Charlotte, listen to me.

664
00:55:31,566 --> 00:55:34,735
I know you're angry,
but it's not Abby's fault.

665
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:38,005
I know you.
I know you wouldn't hurt her.

666
00:55:38,973 --> 00:55:40,473
What do I type?

667
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:43,476
Are you willing
to take that chance?

668
00:55:50,151 --> 00:55:51,219
Abby!

669
00:55:54,088 --> 00:55:55,890
Okay. Okay.

670
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:57,558
Okay.

671
00:55:58,326 --> 00:55:59,994
Four.

672
00:56:00,995 --> 00:56:01,963
Four.

673
00:56:02,063 --> 00:56:05,700
A. E.

674
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,602
Seven.

675
00:56:07,735 --> 00:56:10,638
X. C. D.

676
00:56:10,738 --> 00:56:12,707
C. D.

677
00:56:12,807 --> 00:56:14,141
One.

678
00:56:14,308 --> 00:56:15,610
Now what?

679
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,845
Hit "enter."

680
00:56:46,307 --> 00:56:49,977
You did it, Abby. We're free.

681
00:56:57,818 --> 00:56:59,419
We better hurry
if we want to get

682
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,522
to the science fair in time.

683
00:57:02,556 --> 00:57:04,692
I only have my bike.

684
00:57:06,594 --> 00:57:08,629
How are we going to get there?

685
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:14,702
♪ 'Cause I hear it
in the night ♪

686
00:57:14,802 --> 00:57:18,205
♪ I hear the secrets
that you keep ♪

687
00:57:19,307 --> 00:57:20,975
♪ When you're talking
in your sleep... ♪

688
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:22,209
Where to?

689
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:24,444
Oh, you again?
You got to be kidding me.

690
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:25,913
Kid...

691
00:57:25,947 --> 00:57:28,481
get out of this cab right...

692
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,486
Oh, my goodness!

693
00:57:33,621 --> 00:57:38,458
Oh, Chica, you, uh,
dropped this.

694
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,996
Thank you, Abby.

695
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:46,133
I got to get a new job.

696
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,122
Mike?

697
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,457
Yeah.

698
00:58:09,557 --> 00:58:12,026
Uh, thanks for seeing me.

699
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:14,161
Come on inside.

700
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,403
Honestly, I was surprised
to get your call.

701
00:58:24,138 --> 00:58:27,041
The only calls I've gotten
so far have been...

702
00:58:28,743 --> 00:58:31,979
...prank calls,
kids asking to order a pizza,

703
00:58:32,046 --> 00:58:34,148
things like that.

704
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:36,250
Sure I can't offer you
a cup, Mike?

705
00:58:36,283 --> 00:58:37,685
Oh, no, I'm-I'm fine. Thank you.

706
00:58:37,818 --> 00:58:41,789
Um, I don't know
what I'm doing here, really.

707
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:43,190
I just, um...

708
00:58:43,324 --> 00:58:46,293
I don't really have anyone else
I can talk to about this.

709
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,529
I'm just looking
for some answers.

710
00:58:49,296 --> 00:58:51,599
You know, I...

711
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:53,667
I wasn't the best father.

712
00:58:53,768 --> 00:58:55,636
I was...

713
00:58:55,703 --> 00:58:58,739
I was obsessed by my work
when I was younger,

714
00:58:58,806 --> 00:59:01,876
and it eventually...

715
00:59:02,009 --> 00:59:03,611
cost me everything.

716
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:06,047
Including my little girl.

717
00:59:06,147 --> 00:59:08,215
I'm sorry.

718
00:59:11,185 --> 00:59:12,420
You know, on the phone,

719
00:59:12,521 --> 00:59:16,090
you said that Charlotte died
at Freddy's?

720
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:19,260
Everyone called it an accident.

721
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,028
I had my suspicions about

722
00:59:21,095 --> 00:59:23,064
what had really happened,
but it wasn't until years later

723
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,534
when those five children
went missing that...

724
00:59:25,633 --> 00:59:30,271
that I knew she was murdered...

725
00:59:30,371 --> 00:59:32,106
by him.

726
00:59:35,209 --> 00:59:39,046
I can only assume
that you lost someone as well.

727
00:59:40,214 --> 00:59:42,583
It's my little brother.

728
00:59:42,716 --> 00:59:45,052
I'm sorry for your loss.

729
00:59:45,186 --> 00:59:48,622
It's so easy to become
so blinded by ambition

730
00:59:48,656 --> 00:59:50,491
that even with
the best of intentions

731
00:59:50,624 --> 00:59:53,928
you don't see the devil
sitting right beside you.

732
00:59:54,095 --> 00:59:57,064
And now this Fazfest business,
it's brought it all back.

733
00:59:57,164 --> 01:00:00,634
It's an abomination,
people celebrating that place.

734
01:00:00,734 --> 01:00:03,137
That's why I posted
those flyers.

735
01:00:03,237 --> 01:00:06,006
-People need to know the truth.
-Wait, what...

736
01:00:07,475 --> 01:00:10,177
Where-where is this?
What is this?

737
01:00:10,244 --> 01:00:11,979
It's the-the river ride.

738
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,914
It was one of
Charlotte's favorites.

739
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:17,485
But I-I've been to Freddy's.
There's not a-a river ride.

740
01:00:17,586 --> 01:00:19,086
There was only one
at the first Freddy's.

741
01:00:19,153 --> 01:00:21,388
None of the later locations
had one.

742
01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:23,724
First Freddy's?

743
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,628
Abby drew this.

744
01:00:27,728 --> 01:00:29,396
Uh, c-can I use your phone?

745
01:00:29,531 --> 01:00:31,398
Yeah, of course.
It's over there.

746
01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:37,071
Hello?

747
01:00:37,171 --> 01:00:39,073
And you're sure she isn't there?

748
01:00:39,173 --> 01:00:40,641
I'm so sorry, sir.

749
01:00:40,774 --> 01:00:43,844
Apparently, there was some sort
of incident and she left.

750
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:46,380
But if you'd like,
I can call the...

751
01:00:49,683 --> 01:00:51,752
What an asshole.

752
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,054
Is everything all right?

753
01:00:54,155 --> 01:00:57,258
I, uh... I don't...
I-I don't know. Um...

754
01:00:57,391 --> 01:00:58,926
I think my sister...

755
01:01:01,128 --> 01:01:02,730
I think she's here.

756
01:01:03,464 --> 01:01:04,999
One-two-five...

757
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:07,434
-two-five...
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

758
01:01:07,468 --> 01:01:08,769
I made this music box
for Charlotte

759
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:09,970
when she was just a baby.

760
01:01:10,104 --> 01:01:11,805
The music, it helped her sleep.

761
01:01:11,906 --> 01:01:14,408
I know this might sound crazy,
but if you go back there,

762
01:01:14,543 --> 01:01:16,810
would you leave it for her?

763
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,447
Uh, yeah.

764
01:01:21,982 --> 01:01:23,884
Thank you.

765
01:01:44,405 --> 01:01:45,940
Abby?

766
01:01:51,145 --> 01:01:52,913
Abby!

767
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,672
Abby?

768
01:03:13,894 --> 01:03:16,030
Whoa! A giant robot.

769
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,766
Excuse me. Pardon me.

770
01:03:17,831 --> 01:03:19,166
-Look, it's Chica!
-Excuse me. Clear out.

771
01:03:19,266 --> 01:03:20,769
-Whoa.
-What's going on over here?

772
01:03:20,868 --> 01:03:23,571
Mr. Berg, this is my new
science fair project.

773
01:03:24,506 --> 01:03:25,740
Mr. Berg,

774
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:28,475
I've heard so much about you.

775
01:03:30,844 --> 01:03:33,615
Is this a joke, Miss Schmidt?

776
01:03:33,715 --> 01:03:35,282
Putting someone in a suit

777
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:37,786
and passing it off
as your own work?

778
01:03:37,885 --> 01:03:39,820
You're an embarrassment
to our class

779
01:03:39,853 --> 01:03:41,656
and to our school, Miss Schmidt.

780
01:03:41,723 --> 01:03:46,026
Now, take your freak-show friend
and get out of my science fair!

781
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:48,429
Before you lose us the title.

782
01:03:52,767 --> 01:03:54,636
I'm sorry, Chica.

783
01:03:54,703 --> 01:03:57,104
There is nothing
to be sorry about.

784
01:03:58,972 --> 01:04:01,676
How about I go talk to him?

785
01:04:01,776 --> 01:04:03,010
What are you gonna say?

786
01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:05,412
I just want to see
what's going on

787
01:04:05,446 --> 01:04:07,948
inside of his head.

788
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:11,519
-Whoa.
-Wow.

789
01:04:11,586 --> 01:04:13,220
No.

790
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,556
I'm on my way.

791
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:17,224
I-I just left my keys
in my office.

792
01:04:18,225 --> 01:04:19,460
Again.

793
01:04:21,629 --> 01:04:23,330
This part of the building
is closed!

794
01:04:23,464 --> 01:04:25,667
Now, get out of here.

795
01:04:25,767 --> 01:04:28,168
Before I have you both expelled.

796
01:04:28,235 --> 01:04:30,871
Geez.

797
01:06:02,262 --> 01:06:04,064
I would like to talk to you

798
01:06:04,164 --> 01:06:07,669
about Abby's project, Mr. Berg.

799
01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:22,917
I'll give her an "A"!

800
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:25,452
You-you...
you want test answers?

801
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:29,490
I'll-I'll give you
answers to the next test.

802
01:06:36,497 --> 01:06:38,700
What I want is to see

803
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,503
what's going on
inside of your head.

804
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:00,487
Just as I thought.

805
01:07:02,657 --> 01:07:04,692
Nothing in there at all.

806
01:07:10,932 --> 01:07:13,033
Abby?

807
01:07:29,951 --> 01:07:31,385
Abby?

808
01:07:38,593 --> 01:07:40,127
Vanessa.

809
01:07:40,929 --> 01:07:42,062
Are you okay?

810
01:07:43,598 --> 01:07:44,866
I'm okay.

811
01:07:44,933 --> 01:07:46,500
What's going on?
Where-where's Abby?

812
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:49,771
I don't know where
she is exactly, but...

813
01:07:49,871 --> 01:07:52,339
she left with them,
the animatronics.

814
01:07:52,439 --> 01:07:54,308
I just saw the animatronics
in-in a back room.

815
01:07:54,408 --> 01:07:58,680
No, those are just prototypes
used for spare parts.

816
01:07:58,746 --> 01:08:00,080
It's Charlotte.

817
01:08:00,213 --> 01:08:01,749
She's behind everything.

818
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:04,484
I think Abby might be in danger.

819
01:08:04,586 --> 01:08:06,955
We need to get
to the security office.

820
01:08:07,055 --> 01:08:09,189
It's the only way
I know how to help her.

821
01:08:09,256 --> 01:08:12,594
Come on.

822
01:08:15,329 --> 01:08:18,633
I know you don't want to,
but you have to trust me.

823
01:08:23,738 --> 01:08:25,372
Okay.

824
01:08:29,744 --> 01:08:31,646
Is there another way?

825
01:08:34,716 --> 01:08:36,784
Come on.

826
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:39,186
I don't understand.

827
01:08:39,286 --> 01:08:41,089
Are-are the ghost kids here now?

828
01:08:41,154 --> 01:08:43,825
No, there's just one ghost here.

829
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:45,593
In the Marionette.

830
01:08:46,561 --> 01:08:47,662
Charlotte.

831
01:08:47,762 --> 01:08:48,963
After she was killed,

832
01:08:49,063 --> 01:08:51,131
I would sometimes
still see her here.

833
01:08:52,834 --> 01:08:55,402
<i>She seemed stuck</i>

834
01:08:55,502 --> 01:08:58,906
<i>in the last emotion</i>
<i>before she died.</i>

835
01:09:00,908 --> 01:09:02,744
Rage.

836
01:09:04,812 --> 01:09:07,882
But there's this music box
that kept her asleep.

837
01:09:30,571 --> 01:09:32,840
<i>I put her to sleep</i>
<i>with this music box, but...</i>

838
01:09:34,042 --> 01:09:36,577
...something or someone
broke it.

839
01:09:37,377 --> 01:09:39,847
Wait. Henry just gave me
a music box.

840
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:46,087
Maybe coming this way
was a bad idea.

841
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:47,722
Hurry.

842
01:09:47,822 --> 01:09:50,323
Mike.

843
01:10:00,868 --> 01:10:03,871
Here. Here. Grab my hand.

844
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,748
Mike!

845
01:10:16,784 --> 01:10:18,485
Come on.

846
01:10:23,858 --> 01:10:25,258
Okay. Come on.

847
01:10:25,358 --> 01:10:27,227
Come on, come on, come on.

848
01:10:29,262 --> 01:10:31,632
Where are you?

849
01:10:32,432 --> 01:10:34,902
Vanessa, what are we doing here?
How-how do we find Abby?

850
01:10:35,002 --> 01:10:37,270
I'm trying to pull up
the tracker.

851
01:10:37,437 --> 01:10:39,540
Abby thinks these animatronics
are her friends,

852
01:10:39,607 --> 01:10:40,875
but they're not.

853
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:43,144
They're being wirelessly
controlled by the Marionette.

854
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:44,344
By Charlotte.

855
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:46,514
Wh-What does she want?

856
01:10:47,782 --> 01:10:50,317
My father killed her,
but she doesn't blame him.

857
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:52,754
She blames the parents.

858
01:10:52,854 --> 01:10:53,988
All parents.

859
01:10:54,088 --> 01:10:55,656
Okay. What does she want
with my sister?

860
01:10:55,757 --> 01:10:59,560
It seems like the Marionette
needs something or someone

861
01:10:59,694 --> 01:11:01,662
to bond to
in order to move around.

862
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:03,931
I'm afraid it might
target Abby next.

863
01:11:04,031 --> 01:11:05,933
So there's four animatronics,

864
01:11:06,067 --> 01:11:08,268
and we don't know
which one has Abby.

865
01:11:09,837 --> 01:11:11,973
They're all out because the
perimeter locks were disabled.

866
01:11:12,073 --> 01:11:15,109
It's a system that drains
the animatronics of their power

867
01:11:15,209 --> 01:11:16,744
the moment they leave
the building.

868
01:11:16,811 --> 01:11:19,947
But we can find them once we
get their trackers working.

869
01:11:20,081 --> 01:11:21,314
Wait.

870
01:11:21,414 --> 01:11:22,850
D-Did you say
that the Marionette

871
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,417
controls them wirelessly?

872
01:11:24,519 --> 01:11:25,686
Yeah.

873
01:11:28,055 --> 01:11:29,157
Get up.

874
01:11:29,223 --> 01:11:30,892
Look, you-you go...
you go into town,

875
01:11:30,992 --> 01:11:33,194
find Charlotte and just try to
buy me as much time as you can,

876
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:35,663
and I'll try to disconnect
the signal from here.

877
01:11:35,763 --> 01:11:37,330
Okay. Here.

878
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:38,699
We can use these.

879
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,170
Mike, I should have told you
about her.

880
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:44,471
I should have told you
about this place.

881
01:11:44,605 --> 01:11:47,141
I-I, um...

882
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:53,047
Hey, don't worry about that
right now, okay? Just-just go.

883
01:11:53,114 --> 01:11:54,447
-Please.
-Okay.

884
01:11:57,218 --> 01:11:58,886
Hey, how do I close the door?

885
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,453
There isn't a door.

886
01:12:01,189 --> 01:12:03,323
There isn't a door?

887
01:12:04,826 --> 01:12:07,728
What kind of idiot
designed this place?

888
01:12:10,298 --> 01:12:12,266
All right,
where the hell are you guys?

889
01:12:12,365 --> 01:12:13,968
Okay.

890
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:16,938
Maybe no one will notice them.

891
01:12:34,989 --> 01:12:37,091
Dude, that costume is...

892
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:38,793
Legendary.

893
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,427
I don't know.

894
01:12:40,528 --> 01:12:42,196
Seems kind of fake to me.

895
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:43,664
-Don't be rude.
-What?

896
01:12:43,798 --> 01:12:45,666
I mean, it just looks
like a toy, is all.

897
01:12:45,733 --> 01:12:47,835
Hey, we're on the way
to the costume contest.

898
01:12:47,902 --> 01:12:49,036
You want to come?

899
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:52,940
I do, but first,

900
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,545
I have to go pull the heads
off some very bad people.

901
01:12:57,645 --> 01:12:59,479
Right on.

902
01:13:02,283 --> 01:13:04,518
He wins.

903
01:13:04,619 --> 01:13:06,220
Yeah.

904
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:27,541
Okay.

905
01:13:27,608 --> 01:13:29,644
Here goes nothing.

906
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:27,902
Okay, come on.

907
01:14:27,935 --> 01:14:29,270
Yes!

908
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:30,404
Vanessa.

909
01:14:30,503 --> 01:14:32,006
Hey.

910
01:14:32,073 --> 01:14:34,542
-Any luck over there?
-I located the first tracker.

911
01:14:34,642 --> 01:14:37,178
Freddy is at 175 West Elm.
Can you get there?

912
01:14:37,278 --> 01:14:38,879
Copy that. I'm close.

913
01:14:43,551 --> 01:14:45,119
Harry, come inside.

914
01:14:45,219 --> 01:14:47,388
You're letting in
the mosquitoes.

915
01:14:48,923 --> 01:14:52,159
Mosquitoes,
mosquitoes, mosquitoes.

916
01:15:12,146 --> 01:15:14,715
How is there not a door?

917
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:21,922
There's no way that'll work.

918
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,062
Okay.

919
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:33,768
Come on. Where are you?

920
01:15:46,147 --> 01:15:47,948
Sleep tight.

921
01:16:11,472 --> 01:16:13,574
Hello?

922
01:16:13,674 --> 01:16:15,609
I hate this place.

923
01:16:17,378 --> 01:16:19,046
Mike, you okay?

924
01:16:28,557 --> 01:16:30,324
Holy shit.

925
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:44,265
Please, come on.

926
01:17:45,232 --> 01:17:47,168
Come on!

927
01:17:58,212 --> 01:18:00,047
I'm going to bed.

928
01:18:02,783 --> 01:18:04,785
You're invited to Fazfest.

929
01:18:04,885 --> 01:18:06,655
Come celebrate
with Bonnie, Foxy, Chica

930
01:18:06,754 --> 01:18:07,988
and, of course, Freddy.

931
01:18:08,122 --> 01:18:10,491
Scrumptious snacks,
marvelous merchandise...

932
01:18:10,592 --> 01:18:12,627
Did you leave a door open?

933
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,962
I feel a draft.

934
01:18:35,849 --> 01:18:38,018
You left me to die.

935
01:18:38,052 --> 01:18:40,454
What? What did we do?

936
01:18:40,522 --> 01:18:43,123
All of you did.

937
01:18:43,857 --> 01:18:45,392
No!

938
01:18:57,905 --> 01:19:00,407
Oh, God. Oh, God.

939
01:19:02,443 --> 01:19:03,645
Here. Here.

940
01:19:03,744 --> 01:19:05,513
You okay? It's okay.

941
01:19:05,614 --> 01:19:06,847
Is there anyone else
inside of the house?

942
01:19:06,947 --> 01:19:09,817
Just us. And... them.

943
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:11,118
What are they?

944
01:19:11,218 --> 01:19:13,153
We need to get out of here
right now.

945
01:19:13,254 --> 01:19:14,355
Come on.

946
01:19:22,363 --> 01:19:24,198
Whoa!

947
01:19:24,298 --> 01:19:26,900
Please, please, please.

948
01:19:47,656 --> 01:19:49,423
That worked.

949
01:19:51,693 --> 01:19:54,361
I'm Debbie. What's your name?

950
01:19:54,461 --> 01:19:55,896
My name is Bonnie.

951
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:58,432
Can we be friends, Debbie?

952
01:19:58,533 --> 01:20:00,901
Sure, we can.

953
01:20:01,001 --> 01:20:03,304
Debbie,
stop talking to your animals

954
01:20:03,404 --> 01:20:04,938
and go to sleep.

955
01:20:06,273 --> 01:20:10,578
I'm gonna go see if your mom
will let us stay up late.

956
01:20:13,047 --> 01:20:15,015
Now, if you're
headed downtown this evening,

957
01:20:15,115 --> 01:20:17,318
you may want to be
on the lookout for bears.

958
01:20:17,451 --> 01:20:19,186
No, the circus isn't in town.

959
01:20:19,286 --> 01:20:21,656
Tonight marks
the inaugural Fazfest,

960
01:20:21,756 --> 01:20:24,091
the local grassroots,
cultural arts festival

961
01:20:24,191 --> 01:20:25,826
celebrating the nostalgic...

962
01:20:52,486 --> 01:20:54,121
Oh, no.

963
01:21:19,012 --> 01:21:20,381
Okay. Come on, Mike.

964
01:21:20,515 --> 01:21:21,882
Come on.

965
01:21:21,982 --> 01:21:23,518
It's now or never.

966
01:21:23,618 --> 01:21:25,919
...long defunct
food and entertainment chain

967
01:21:25,986 --> 01:21:27,856
began last year as a series

968
01:21:27,955 --> 01:21:30,157
of urban legends
started circulating...

969
01:21:33,528 --> 01:21:35,563
No.

970
01:21:36,631 --> 01:21:37,766
Please don't.

971
01:21:37,866 --> 01:21:39,099
Stop!

972
01:21:42,637 --> 01:21:44,171
Stop. Stop.

973
01:21:45,507 --> 01:21:47,441
Come on. Where is it?

974
01:21:49,677 --> 01:21:51,311
Oh. Yeah.

975
01:22:16,604 --> 01:22:18,472
Oh, no.

976
01:22:26,881 --> 01:22:29,049
It's not working.

977
01:22:35,255 --> 01:22:37,224
I have to disable the signal.

978
01:22:37,324 --> 01:22:38,760
Come on.

979
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:40,829
Your mom doesn't care about you.

980
01:22:40,929 --> 01:22:43,030
-Please, just stop.
-No.

981
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:45,065
She only thinks about herself.

982
01:22:45,165 --> 01:22:46,935
Parents are all the same,

983
01:22:47,034 --> 01:22:49,069
and I have to punish them
for that.

984
01:22:49,169 --> 01:22:51,506
Please, don't hurt her.

985
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,075
I'm in. I'm in.

986
01:22:55,209 --> 01:22:56,376
Okay.

987
01:22:56,477 --> 01:22:58,245
Yes, I'm sure.

988
01:23:12,627 --> 01:23:14,328
Go, go!

989
01:23:15,462 --> 01:23:16,931
Go, go, go.

990
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:21,268
Do you need some help?

991
01:23:21,335 --> 01:23:22,871
You all need to stay
inside tonight.

992
01:23:23,036 --> 01:23:25,239
-Can they go with you?
-Of course.

993
01:23:25,339 --> 01:23:29,611
You know, it looks like you
might be needing a good lawyer.

994
01:23:30,344 --> 01:23:32,412
Mike.

995
01:23:34,582 --> 01:23:35,783
I got it, Vanessa.

996
01:23:35,884 --> 01:23:38,485
They're deactivated.

997
01:23:47,595 --> 01:23:49,664
No.

998
01:23:49,831 --> 01:23:51,231
No. Wait.

999
01:23:51,365 --> 01:23:53,735
Vanessa, th-there's one
more dot. It's still moving.

1000
01:23:53,768 --> 01:23:55,168
That's not possible.

1001
01:23:55,302 --> 01:23:58,105
-Where is it?
-It's at my house.

1002
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,073
The Marionette.

1003
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:01,643
I'm gonna head there right now.

1004
01:24:52,594 --> 01:24:53,828
Mike?

1005
01:24:55,295 --> 01:24:56,965
<i>They're turning back on.</i>

1006
01:24:57,031 --> 01:24:58,398
<i>The signal's been reactivated.</i>

1007
01:24:58,498 --> 01:25:01,234
<i>We're outmatched.</i>
<i>We need more help.</i>

1008
01:25:05,673 --> 01:25:07,075
I've got an idea.

1009
01:25:26,961 --> 01:25:29,396
I don't know
if you can hear me or not.

1010
01:25:30,932 --> 01:25:33,968
I-I don't even know
if you're all still here, but...

1011
01:25:34,068 --> 01:25:36,269
Abby needs you.

1012
01:25:38,171 --> 01:25:40,407
She needs your help now.

1013
01:25:42,076 --> 01:25:43,310
Do you hear me?

1014
01:25:43,443 --> 01:25:47,280
If any of you
ever really cared about her,

1015
01:25:47,314 --> 01:25:49,817
you're gonna help her right now.

1016
01:25:52,954 --> 01:25:54,756
Please!

1017
01:25:58,325 --> 01:26:01,361
Please, I...
I can't do this alone.

1018
01:26:07,234 --> 01:26:09,637
Oh, come on, come on.

1019
01:26:09,737 --> 01:26:11,304
Don't die.

1020
01:26:22,482 --> 01:26:23,885
Mike.

1021
01:26:26,654 --> 01:26:28,188
Mike, are you there?

1022
01:26:28,321 --> 01:26:29,389
My radiator's busted.

1023
01:26:29,489 --> 01:26:32,259
I don't know what to do.
I-I can't...

1024
01:26:33,828 --> 01:26:35,930
I can't get to Abby. I...

1025
01:26:45,205 --> 01:26:47,307
-Vanessa?
-Oh, thank God.

1026
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:49,577
Do you need a ride?

1027
01:26:52,379 --> 01:26:54,082
I need to go to Mike's house.

1028
01:26:54,182 --> 01:26:55,616
Right now.

1029
01:27:07,494 --> 01:27:09,864
Vanessa, what is going on?

1030
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:13,568
Crazy eyes.

1031
01:27:29,217 --> 01:27:30,885
Abby.

1032
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,988
Vanessa.

1033
01:27:39,761 --> 01:27:41,796
Vanessa.

1034
01:27:46,834 --> 01:27:48,236
Charlotte?

1035
01:27:48,335 --> 01:27:49,904
No, silly.

1036
01:27:50,004 --> 01:27:52,940
It's me, Abby.

1037
01:27:56,077 --> 01:27:57,645
Charlotte, what have you done?

1038
01:28:05,553 --> 01:28:08,355
Come out,
come out, wherever you are.

1039
01:28:08,455 --> 01:28:11,058
Vanessa.

1040
01:28:11,192 --> 01:28:14,662
The adults in your life
betrayed you, too.

1041
01:28:14,729 --> 01:28:17,297
They don't deserve
your protection.

1042
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:19,801
You don't have to die with them.

1043
01:28:19,901 --> 01:28:21,702
You can help me.

1044
01:28:22,703 --> 01:28:25,706
Vanessa.

1045
01:28:25,773 --> 01:28:30,711
You really thought I'd forget
the first rule of hide-and-seek?

1046
01:28:31,612 --> 01:28:34,715
Always check behind the door.

1047
01:28:50,497 --> 01:28:52,300
Charlotte, listen to me.

1048
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:54,434
Abby's innocent.
Just let her go.

1049
01:28:54,535 --> 01:28:56,403
You know, Vanessa,

1050
01:28:56,503 --> 01:28:58,206
I've always wondered,

1051
01:28:58,306 --> 01:29:02,043
what exactly goes on
inside of your head?

1052
01:29:09,183 --> 01:29:11,886
No. No.

1053
01:29:28,169 --> 01:29:29,770
Abby.

1054
01:29:30,538 --> 01:29:33,207
-Mike.
-Abby. Hey.

1055
01:29:33,341 --> 01:29:34,407
Are you okay?

1056
01:29:34,508 --> 01:29:36,277
I don't know what happened.

1057
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:38,145
I feel sick.

1058
01:29:38,212 --> 01:29:42,149
It's like the bag of orange
gummy candies all over again.

1059
01:29:42,316 --> 01:29:44,352
-All right, c-can you stand up?
-I think so.

1060
01:29:44,451 --> 01:29:46,320
-Yeah? Okay.
-Let's get out of here.

1061
01:29:46,453 --> 01:29:48,589
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1062
01:29:52,693 --> 01:29:55,663
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1063
01:30:02,203 --> 01:30:03,804
No, no.

1064
01:30:08,242 --> 01:30:10,945
Knock, knock.

1065
01:30:13,981 --> 01:30:15,816
Hiya, sis.

1066
01:30:16,784 --> 01:30:18,552
Michael.

1067
01:30:19,353 --> 01:30:21,155
Vanessa, what the hell
is going on?

1068
01:30:21,255 --> 01:30:22,290
Oh, let me guess.

1069
01:30:22,422 --> 01:30:24,225
She never told you about me.

1070
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:27,728
That's my sister for you.

1071
01:30:27,828 --> 01:30:32,166
She always was a little
selective with the truth.

1072
01:30:33,167 --> 01:30:34,467
I'm Michael.

1073
01:30:34,568 --> 01:30:37,138
Michael Afton.

1074
01:30:37,238 --> 01:30:39,439
I am so pleased
to finally meet you.

1075
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:40,775
Leave them alone, Michael.

1076
01:30:40,841 --> 01:30:42,376
They haven't done
anything wrong.

1077
01:30:42,475 --> 01:30:45,212
I think our father might
strongly disagree with that.

1078
01:30:45,313 --> 01:30:47,581
Your father's dead.

1079
01:30:49,817 --> 01:30:51,519
Yeah.

1080
01:30:52,485 --> 01:30:55,556
But I'm here
to continue his legacy,

1081
01:30:55,656 --> 01:30:58,526
just in time for Fazfest.

1082
01:30:59,827 --> 01:31:01,195
That was you?

1083
01:31:04,065 --> 01:31:05,800
Well, your aunt was the one

1084
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:09,537
who rekindled everyone's
interest in Freddy's, but...

1085
01:31:09,704 --> 01:31:13,274
I got to admit,
I did add fuel to the fire.

1086
01:31:13,407 --> 01:31:15,443
It's the perfect cover.

1087
01:31:15,543 --> 01:31:17,578
I mean...

1088
01:31:17,678 --> 01:31:20,281
we're all just
gonna blend right in.

1089
01:31:25,987 --> 01:31:28,456
Half of this town
will be dead by morning.

1090
01:31:28,556 --> 01:31:31,258
You can't do this.
This isn't a game.

1091
01:31:31,392 --> 01:31:33,394
Michael.

1092
01:31:33,461 --> 01:31:35,229
You can have a normal life.

1093
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:37,965
We could have a normal life.

1094
01:31:38,699 --> 01:31:42,036
Vanessa, is that
what you thought?

1095
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:45,673
You thought you could just
trade us in?

1096
01:31:46,507 --> 01:31:49,777
Betray us?
Get yourself a shiny new life?

1097
01:31:51,178 --> 01:31:53,514
You are his child.

1098
01:31:54,515 --> 01:31:57,451
You have a purpose.

1099
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:02,990
We will always be his.

1100
01:32:03,090 --> 01:32:05,126
Come home.

1101
01:32:08,829 --> 01:32:10,097
I am home.

1102
01:32:17,972 --> 01:32:19,673
Hmm.

1103
01:32:23,677 --> 01:32:25,813
Doesn't matter to me anyway.

1104
01:32:26,814 --> 01:32:29,550
Yeah. Break their bones.

1105
01:32:30,384 --> 01:32:32,319
Crush them.

1106
01:32:32,453 --> 01:32:35,156
It's okay.

1107
01:33:16,864 --> 01:33:18,199
Freddy?

1108
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:46,293
Abby, you've been
a very, very bad girl.

1109
01:34:10,519 --> 01:34:13,320
Where do you think
you're going, jackass?

1110
01:34:24,698 --> 01:34:27,168
Chica.

1111
01:34:29,236 --> 01:34:32,406
Oh. What's wrong with them?

1112
01:34:39,514 --> 01:34:42,850
Their systems, they're...
they're failing.

1113
01:34:50,592 --> 01:34:53,327
They weren't made
to leave Freddy's.

1114
01:34:53,427 --> 01:34:55,429
They're dying?

1115
01:34:56,497 --> 01:34:58,966
No, you can't die.

1116
01:34:58,999 --> 01:35:01,702
We're just moving on.

1117
01:35:03,504 --> 01:35:06,840
We can't stay
in those bodies anymore.

1118
01:35:10,978 --> 01:35:13,113
Are you going to heaven?

1119
01:35:14,848 --> 01:35:16,951
See you there someday?

1120
01:35:17,718 --> 01:35:19,720
But not too soon.

1121
01:35:20,487 --> 01:35:22,156
Mike?

1122
01:35:22,223 --> 01:35:23,190
Yeah?

1123
01:35:23,257 --> 01:35:25,359
You should know that
when we leave...

1124
01:35:26,193 --> 01:35:28,663
...I won't be able
to hold him anymore.

1125
01:35:28,796 --> 01:35:30,898
He'll get out eventually,

1126
01:35:31,031 --> 01:35:33,067
and he'll be stronger
than before.

1127
01:35:33,167 --> 01:35:34,835
Who?

1128
01:35:48,115 --> 01:35:50,150
Goodbye.

1129
01:35:54,255 --> 01:35:55,889
Hey.

1130
01:36:02,697 --> 01:36:03,897
Mike?

1131
01:36:03,998 --> 01:36:05,399
Whoa.

1132
01:36:07,268 --> 01:36:09,436
Everyone okay?

1133
01:36:10,971 --> 01:36:13,240
Yeah, um... Hey, we got to go.

1134
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:14,709
Okay.

1135
01:36:14,808 --> 01:36:17,044
Come on, Abby.

1136
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:20,848
Stay away from us.

1137
01:36:21,616 --> 01:36:23,017
What?

1138
01:36:24,985 --> 01:36:26,655
I can't trust you.

1139
01:36:26,755 --> 01:36:28,088
Mike.

1140
01:36:28,188 --> 01:36:29,923

Because this whole place is
getting demolished tomorrow.

1166
01:39:11,051 --> 01:39:13,187
We got to grab everything
we can while it's still here.

1167
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,824
Why couldn't we just make
the props for the haunted house?

1168
01:39:15,924 --> 01:39:17,859
Come on, they want
the authentic thing.

1169
01:39:17,991 --> 01:39:20,528
The authentic
Fazbear experience.

1170
01:39:20,628 --> 01:39:22,062
You can't replicate that.

1171
01:39:22,162 --> 01:39:23,598
Just try looking around.

1172
01:39:23,731 --> 01:39:27,301
Anything that might trigger
a little bit of nostalgia.

1173
01:39:28,101 --> 01:39:30,304
Ethan, where are you?

1174
01:39:30,404 --> 01:39:31,972
You got something?

1175
01:39:32,072 --> 01:39:33,808
Back here!

1176
01:39:33,875 --> 01:39:36,544
Dude, I-I think I just found
another room.

1177
01:39:36,644 --> 01:39:38,913
I'm not joking-- I think
I just found another room.

1178
01:39:39,012 --> 01:39:41,248
Get back here right now!

1179
01:39:41,348 --> 01:39:43,518
-Yes, Ethan!
-Okay, okay, okay.

1180
01:39:45,018 --> 01:39:47,589
-You got something?
-I... Y-Yeah.

1181
01:39:47,689 --> 01:39:49,423
I think I found one. I-I...

1182
01:39:49,524 --> 01:39:51,458
I think I found a real one.

1183
01:39:53,795 --> 01:39:55,597
How is this still here?

1184
01:39:55,730 --> 01:39:58,131
It smells terrible.

1185
01:39:59,366 --> 01:40:01,903
Yeah, we got to take this
with us.

1186
01:40:02,002 --> 01:40:03,872
Let's see, uh...

1187
01:40:03,972 --> 01:40:05,540
-Hey, uh, Patrick, cover it.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1188
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:07,441
Let's get the dolly.
Cover it, will you?

1189
01:40:07,542 --> 01:40:08,776
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1190
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:25,560
Hey, guys, wait up!

01:43:39,153 --> 01:43:41,522

01:43:41,622 --> 01:43:44,257
<i>There are things</i>
