00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,946
<i>It's another hot, sunny day today here
in Southern California.</i>

00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,156
<i>Temperature is 84
for downtown Los Angeles,</i>

00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,992
<i>I think about that day</i>

5
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,704
<i>I Ieft him at a Greyhound station
west of Santa Fe</i>

6
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,457
<i>We were 1 7, but he was sweet
and it was true</i>

7
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:26,128
<i>Still, I knew what I had to do</i>

8
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,380
<i>'Cause ljust knew</i>

9
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,173
<i>Summer Sunday nights</i>

10
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:34,052
<i>We 'd sink into our seats
right as they dimmed out all the Iights</i>

11
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:37,598
<i>A technicolor world
made out of music and machine</i>

12
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:41,476
<i>It called me to be on that screen</i>

13
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,687
<i>And Iive inside each scene</i>

14
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,441
<i>Without a nickel to my name,
hopped a bus, here l came</i>

15
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:51,445
<i>Could be brave orjust insane,
we 'll have to see</i>

16
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,155
<i>'Cause maybe
in that sleepy town</i>

17
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,990
<i>He 'll sit one day,
the lights are down</i>

18
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:59,036
<i>He 'll see my face and think
how he used to know me</i>

19
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,497
<i>Climb these hills,
I'm reaching for the heights</i>

20
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,585
<i>And chasing
all the Iights that shine</i>

21
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,464
<i>And when they Iet you down,
it's another day of</i>

22
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,009
<i>You get up off the ground,

23
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,637

<i>And it's another day of sun</i>

25
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,602
<i>I hear 'em every day</i>

26
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,439
<i>The rhythms in the canyons
that'II never fade away</i>

27
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:31,234
<i>The ballads in the barrooms
left by those who came before</i>

28
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,613
<i>They say
"You gotta want it more "</i>

29
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,948
<i>So l bang on every door</i>

30
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,742
<i>And even when the answer's "no "</i>

31
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,744
<i>Or when my money's running low</i>

32
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,498
<i>The dusty mic and neon glow
are all I need</i>

33
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,500
<i>And someday as I sing my song</i>

34
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,460
<i>A small-town kid'll come along</i>

35
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,004
<i>That'Il be the thing to push him on</i>

36
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,506
<i>And go, go</i>

37
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,009
<i>Climb these hills,
I'm reaching for the heights</i>

38
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,763

00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,705
all packed into one of those
big glass houses.

<i>Do what you need to do
'til they discover you</i>

135

<i>And make you more
than who you're seeing now</i>

00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,125
When l unpack them
i n my own club.

173
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,712
Oh , Sebastian ! lt's like a girl broke up
with you and you're stalking her.

174
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,380
You're not still going
by there, are you?

175
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,258
That's...

176
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,510
You won't bel ieve it.
They turned it into a samba-tapas place.

177
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,639
- Oh , my God , Sebastian !
- Samba. Tapas.

178
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,767
Pick one, you know?
Do one right.

179
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,395
- I have someone l want you to meet.
- l don't wanna meet anyone.

180
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,813
No, no, l don't wanna meet anyone.

181
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,274
- Dad gave you this? You'll l ike her.
- Yes.

182
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,735
I don't think l'm gonna like her.
Does she like jazz?

183
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,737
- Probably not.
- Then what are we gonna talk about?

184
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,697
I don't know!
lt doesn't matter, okay?

185
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,825
Because you're living l ike a hermit.
You're driving without i nsurance!

186
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,243
- "It doesn't matter"?
- Yeah , it doesn't matter.

187
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,787
- Okay. Well then ,
- You need to get serious.

188
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,372
I know a guy with a face tattoo
that you should see.

189
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,539
- Okay, low blow.
- Heart of gold .

190
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,875
- Get serious!
- "Get serious"?

191
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:32,171
Laura. . . l had a very serious plan
for my future.

192
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,382
- I know.
- lt's not my fault l got shanghaied .

193
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:37,635
You didn't get shanghaied .
You got ripped off!

194
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,886
What's the difference?

195
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,181
I don't know.
lt's not as romantic as that.

196
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,349
Don't sit...

197
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,103
Everybody knew that guy
was shady except for you .

198
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:51,607
Why do you say "romantic"
l ike it's a dirty word?

199
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,528
Unpaid bills are not romantic.
Call her.

200
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,862
L'm not gonna call her.

201
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,280
And the thing is...

202
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,574
you're acting like life's got me
on the ropes.

203
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,285
I want to be
on the ropes. Okay?

204
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,912
L'm letting life hit me
'til it gets tired .

205
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,331
- Oh?
- Then l'm gonna hit back.

206
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,166
It's a classic rope-a-dope.

207
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,462
Okay, Ali . l love you .
Unpack your boxes.

208
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,132
- L'm gonna change the locks.
- You can't afford it.

209
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,219
L'm a phoenix
rising from the ashes.

210
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:08,768
Hey.

211
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,312
- Bil l . Thanks for having me back.
- You're welcome.

212
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,980
I want you to know you're lookin'
at a new man ,

213
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,191
- a man that's happy to be here.
- Good . Excellent.

214
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,360
- Very-easy- to-work-with man .
- And you're going to play the set list?

215
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,820
Happy to.

216
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,656
Even though l don't think anyone cares
what l play, but, yeah .

217
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,285
Wel l , if by "anyone" you mean anyone
other than me, that would be correct.

218
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,245
I care, and l don't wanna hear
the free jazz.

219
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,456
Right. Okay.

220
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,124
Although l thought in this town

221
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,294
it worked on a sort of
"one for you , one for me" type system .

222
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,922
How 'bout two for you ,
one for me?

223
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,633
How 'bout all for you
and none for me?

224
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,134
- That's perfect, yes.
- Great.

225
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,761
- Okay.
- Mutual decision , then .

226
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,304
Right. Made by me.

227
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,598
Right. And l sign off on it, so...

228
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,434
Whatever. Tell yourself
what you wanna know.

229
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,645
Wel l . Welcome back.

230
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,898
There's a nice way
to say that, Karen .

231
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,332
Seb.

232
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,138
I hear what you're saying ,

233
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,889
but l don't think you're saying
what you mean .

234
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,891
Yeah , l don't think you hear
what l'm saying . You're fired .

235
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:20,144
Wel l , that's what you're saying ,
but it's not what you mean .

236
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,479
- What you mean is. . .
- You're fired .

237
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:25,816
- "Play the set l ist."
- No, l'm saying it's too late.

238
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,485
- It's a warning .
- What planet are you from?

239
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,530
- Don't fire me, Bill . Don't fire me.
- You're done. l'm sorry, Seb.

240
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,865
It's Christmas.

241
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:36,076
Yeah , l see the decorations.
Good luck in the new year.

242
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,593
I just heard you play,
and l wanted to...

243
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:11,695
l don't like the fissure on the GT scan .
Did you test for achromatopsia?

244
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:15,365
DOA on 23rd . Perp laughin'
his face off at the PD.

245
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,825
Damn Miranda rights.

246
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,952
This is my classroom .

247
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,913
You don't like it,
the door's to my left.

248
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,998
Lady, why you be trippin' like that?

249
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:28,462
No, Jamal .
You be trippin' .

250
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,014
Over here!

251
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,437
<i>We 're talking away</i>

- Carlo, this is Mia.

257
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,741
- Mia? Hi . How are you?
- Yes, Mia.

258
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,409
Carlo is a writer.

259
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,370
Yeah . They say l have a knack
for world-building .

260
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,704
I got a lot of heat right now.

261
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,165
There's been a lot of buzz, people talkin'
about me, which is exciti ng .

262
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,084
I mean , you work so hard ,
and then all that validation .

263
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,836

264
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,796
Yeah , it's really nice to meet you .

265
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:15,259
<i>I'Il be gone</i>

<i>In a day or two</i>

267
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,893
<i>So needless to say</i>

268
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,478
<i>I'm odds and ends</i>

269
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,398
<i>But I'll be stumbling away</i>

270
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,733
<i>Slowly learning that life is okay</i>

271
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,610
Sorry.

272
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,904
<i>Say after me</i>

273
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,074
<i>It's no better to be safe than sorry</i>

<i>In a day or two</i>

280
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,641
Thank you .
Any other requests?

281
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,854
Girl in the front!

282
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,105
"I Ran ."

283
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,525
"I Ran ."
A fantastic suggestion .

284
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,527
All right, piano man ,
tickle those ivories.

285
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:16,987
Let's hit it.

286
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,822
One! Two! Three! Four!

287
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,793
That's right.

288
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,922
<i>I walk along the avenue</i>

289
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:39,760
<i>I never thought
I'd meet a girl Iike you</i>

290
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,012
<i>Meet a girl like you</i>

291
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,388
Me?

292
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,016
Stop.

293
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,018
<i>With auburn hair
and tawny eyes</i>

294
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:52,481
<i>The kind of eyes
that hypnotize me through</i>

295
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,693
<i>You hypnotize me through</i>

296
00:28:56,777 --> 00:29:01,949
<i>And I ran, I ran so far away</i>

297
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,284
<i>I couldn 't get away...</i>

298
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,979
All right, l remember you .

299
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,439
And l'll admit
l was a little curt that night.

300
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,691
Curt?

301
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,651
Okay, l was an asshole.
l can admit that.

302
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,735
Okay.

303
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:42,030
But requesting " l Ran" from a serious
musician , it's just. . . it's too far.

304
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,742
My Lord ! Did you just say
"a serious musician"?

305
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,995
- I don't think so.
- Can l borrow what you're wearing?

306
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,830
- Why?
- 'Cause l have an audition next week.

307
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,915
L'm playing a "serious" firefighter.

308
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,001
So you're an actress.
l thought you looked familiar.

309
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,711
Have l seen you in anything?

310
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,839
Uh . . . coffee shop
on the Warner Brothers lot.

311
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,048
That's a classic.

312
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,883
- Oh , l see. You're a barista.
- Yeah .

313
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,053
And l can see how you could then
look down on me from all the way up there.

314
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,139
Time to. . . next set.

315
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:11,893
He doesn't-- l don't--
he doesn't tell me what to do.

316
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,353
He just told you what to do.

317
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:16,315
I know. l let him .
What's your name?

318
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,441
- Mia.
- Mia.

319
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,486
Guess l'll see you in the movies.

320
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,907
- You heard of Joseph Campbell?
- Uh , yeah .

321
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,452
I have this idea to do a re-imagining
of <i>Goldilocks and The Three Bears,</i>

322
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,078
but from the perspective
of the bears.

323
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,039
- The hero's journey.
- lt could be li ke a franchise.

324
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,123
- Right.
- There's a lot we don't know.

325
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,875
There could have been a fourth bear,
we don't know.

326
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,335
George Michael !

327
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,050
Hello.

I know that guy.
Did you get your keys?

330
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,682
Mmm-hmm , yes.

331
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,018
- Can you grab mine?
- Can l what?

332
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,561
Would you be able
to grab mine? My keys?

333
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,812
- I can't, your. . .
- Sorry.

334
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,315
- Can you grab my keys?
- Oh .

335
00:30:58,774 --> 00:30:59,983
- Please?
- Oh , there we go.

00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,860
- Thank you .
- You're welcome.

337
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,114
- What kind?
- lt's a Prius.

338
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,118
I mean , that doesn't help me.

339
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,871
- With a green ribbon .
- All right.

340
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:20,003
- Those look, uh , comfortable.
- They are.

341
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,757
Thank you for saving the day
back there.

342
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,804
Wel l , you didn't really
give me much of a choice.

343
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,808
It's pretty strange that we keep running
i nto each other.

344
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,559
It is strange.

345
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,020
Maybe it means somethi ng .

346
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:38,146
- I doubt it.
- Yeah , l don't think so.

347
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,898
Where's my car?

348
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,609
You gotta put that thi ng
to your chin .

349
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,069
- This?
- Yeah .

350
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,822
Yeah , it makes your head
i nto an antenna, so...

351
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,198
- Ooh .
- l think it gives you cancer,

352
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,075
- but you find your car faster.
- What?

353
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,911
You don't live as long , but you get where
you're going quicker, so it al l evens out.

354
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,538
That sounds terrible.

355
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,207
- Just a suggestion .
- You're a--

356
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,043
You're a real , um . . .
what's the word l'm looking for?

357
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,711
"Knight in shining armor"?

358
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,840
- Weirdo. That was the word . Weirdo.
- Okay.

359
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,056
Not much to look at, huh?

360
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,684
L've seen better.

361
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:27,821
<i>The sun is nearly gone</i>

362
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,366
<i>The Iights are turning on</i>

363
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:37,998
<i>A silver shine
that stretches to the sea</i>

364
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,795
<i>We 've stumbled on a view</i>

365
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,883
<i>That's tailor-made for two</i>

366
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:53,805
<i>What a shame
those two are you and me</i>

367
00:32:56,183 --> 00:33:00,770
<i>Some other girl and guy</i>

368
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,565
<i>Would love this swirling sky</i>

369
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,985
<i>But there 's only you and I</i>

370
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,615
<i>And we've got no shot</i>

371
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:15,035
<i>This could never be</i>

372
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,786
<i>You're not the type for me</i>

373
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,121
Really?

374
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:22,250
<i>And there 's not a spark in sight</i>

375
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:27,005
<i>What a a waste of a lovely night</i>

376
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,800
<i>You say there 's nothing here ?</i>

377
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,552
<i>Well, let's make
something clear</i>

378
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,971
<i>I think I'll be the one
to make that call</i>

379
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,056
But you'll call?

380
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,767
<i>And though you look so cute
in your polyester suit</i>

381
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,935
- lt's wool .
<i>- You're right</i>

382
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,771
<i>I'd never fall for you at all</i>

383
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,066
<i>And maybe this appeals</i>

384
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,944
<i>To someone not in heels</i>

385
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,906
<i>Or to any girl who feels</i>

386
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,660
<i>There's some chance
for romance</i>

387
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,995
<i>But I'm frankly feeling nothing</i>

388
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,372
<i>Is that so ?</i>

389
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,457
<i>Or it could be Iess than nothing</i>

390
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,293
<i>Good to know, so you agree ?</i>

391
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,378
<i>That's right</i>

392
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:10,632
<i>What a waste of a lovely night.</i>

393
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,260
Ah !

394
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:23,348
Hi , Greg .
Oh , sorry l'm late.

395
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,850
Yeah . Be there soon .
Okay, bye.

396
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,915
- It was just right there.
- Just right here.

397
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,173
Do you want a ride
to your car?

398
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,509
No, l'm just right up here.

399
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,680
Good night.

400
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,062
Good night.

401
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,095
Excuse me.
This is gluten-free, right?

402
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,015
- No.
- What?

403
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,558
Mmm-mmm .

404
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,393
Ugh !
l'd like a refund .

405
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,981
Okay. Let me check on that for you .

406
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,275
Mia...

407
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,861
- Hi .
- You're closing Friday.

408
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,614
I can't close on Friday.
l have an audition , remember?

409
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,991
Do l look like l care?
Reschedule it.

410
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:50,161
Oh , and we need to have a l ittle talk
tomorrow, okay?

411
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,955
Fix your apron , please.

412
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,289
Okay.

413
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,462
You again !

414
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,507
What are you doi ng here?

415
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,844
Oh , you know, just meetings
and . . . studio heads and ...

416
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,262
How'd you get on the lot?

417
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,932
I basically just hauled ass
past the guard gates.

418
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,309
I think l have 20 mi nutes
until they find me.

419
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,520
You don't have a break
coming up, do you?

420
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,397
L'm off in ten mi nutes, so...

421
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,191
Can l hide
i n the bathroom?

422
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,443
- Yes.
- Okay.

423
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:24,904
Sorry.

424
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,949
Um . . . l actually do have to check.
l'm sorry.

425
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,664
That's the window that Humphrey Bogart
and lngrid Bergman

426
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,874
looked out of in <i>Casablanca.</i>

427
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,166
- Wow!
- Yeah .

428
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,168
I can't bel ieve you work
right across the street from that.

429
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,004
- Yeah .
- That's amazing .

430
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,883
What was your Bogart's name?

431
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,176
What's his name?
ls it Greg?

432
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,262
Yeah . Greg .

433
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,140
Right. How long have you been--

434
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,017
We've been seeing each other
for about a month .

435
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,685
Oh , that's great.

436
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,061
He's, um . . . He's sweet.

437
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,230
Anyway, l love
being around this stuff, you know?

438
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,315
I know what you mean .

439
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,651
I get coffee five miles out of the way
just so l can be near a jazz club.

440
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,194
- Really?
- Yeah , the Van Beek.

441
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,362
- Do you know it?
- Mmm-mmm .

442
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:10,867
All the big swing bands used to play
there. Count Basie, Chick Webb.

443
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,369
Anyway, it's a samba-tapas
place now, so...

444
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,205
What's a samba-tapas place?

445
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,750
It's just a samba place
where they serve tapas.

446
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:22,128
- Oh .
- Yeah , so the joke's on . . . history?

447
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,463
I don't know. That's L.A.

448
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,258
They just worship everything
and they value nothing .

449
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,719
We're about to roll .
Stop, please, guys.

450
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:30,929
Okay.

451
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,555
- You're roll ing?
- Yeah .

452
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,016
I know. They shoot movies on my street
all the time, so l know about movies.

453
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,267
- Come this way.
- Great.

454
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,686
It's a lock-down .

455
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,730
- I love her!
- And here we go.

456
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,732
Hey! How'd you get
i nto all this?

457
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,233
And roll !

458
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,735
- Get into what?
- Sound speed !

459
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,320
You know, movies, acting ...

460
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,405
- Action !
- Oh , um ...

461
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,325
- My aunt was an actress.
- Oh , okay.

462
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,744
She was i n a travel ing
theater company.

463
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,038
I grew up in Boulder City, Nevada.

464
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,707
So across the street from my house
there was this l ittle library

465
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,417
that had an old movie section .

466
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:05,922
So she took me and we spent an entire day
watching al l these old movies

467
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:10,051
l ike <i>Notorious</i> and <i>Bringing Up Baby</i>
and <i>Casablanca.</i>

468
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,552
- And . . .
- Cut it there! Cut!

469
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,680
- Check the gate.
- So we can talk now.

470
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,598
- She sounds incredible.
- She was incredible.

471
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,267
And l would put on all these plays
i n my bedroom ,

472
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:23,606
and it would basically just be she and l
re-enacting those scenes from the movies.

473
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,066
And then l would
write my own plays.

474
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,734
- Wow.
- Um . . . Yeah .

475
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,465
I love it.

476
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,681
So anyway, l leff college
after two years to come here

477
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,600
and my last audition was
for a teen show

478
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,853
pitched as
<i>"Dangerous Minds</i> meets <i>The O. C."</i>

479
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,982
So, yeah , should've been a lawyer.

480
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,984
'Cause the world
needs more lawyers.

481
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,194
It doesn't need more actresses.

482
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,696
You're not
just an actress.

483
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,365
- What do you mean , "just an actress"?
- You said it yourself.

484
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,868
You're a child prodigy playwright.

485
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,411
That is not what l said .

486
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,998
Wel l , you're too modest
to say it, but it's true.

487
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,833
You could just write
your own roles, you know?

488
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,793
Write something that's
as interesting as you are,

489
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,336
and you don't have to audition
for this...

490
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,755
- uh , piece of caca.
- Yeah .

491
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,256
Look at Louis Armstrong .

492
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,009
He could've just played the marching band
charts that he was given .

493
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,802
But he didn't do it.
What did he do?

494
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,972
- What did he do?
- Well , he made history, didn't he?

495
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:41,267
Wel l , l'm gonna stop auditioning
and l'm gonna make history instead .

496
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,979
Wel l , my work is done here.

497
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,275
I should probably tell you something now,
just to get it out of the way.

498
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,610
- Mmm-hmm?
- l hate jazz.

499
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,572
Are you okay?

500
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,908
What do you mean ,
you hate jazz?

501
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,743
It just means that when l listen to it,
l don't like it.

502
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,746
Yeah , but it's such a blanket statement
you don't like jazz.

503
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,081
What are you doi ng right now?

504
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,833
Nothing .

505
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,478
I just think that people,
when they say that they...

506
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:30,024
you know, hate jazz, they just...

507
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,945
They don't have context, they don't know
where it comes from .

508
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,698
Jazz was born in a little
flophouse in New Orleans,

509
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,700
and it's just because people
were crammed in there,

510
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,370
they spoke five different languages,
they couldn't talk to each other.

511
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:46,249
The only way they could communicate
was with jazz.

512
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,708
Yeah , but what about Kenny G?

513
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,045
- What?
- What about Kenny G?

514
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,964
I mean , what about elevator music?

515
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,508
You know,
jazz music that l know?

516
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,343
- What about it?
- From my l ife?

517
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,762
- Mmm-hmm?
- l just fi nd it relaxing .

518
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,223
It's not relaxing .
lt's not, it's not.

519
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,434
Sidney Bechet shot somebody because
they told him he played a wrong note.

520
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:06,769
That's hardly relaxing .

521
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:11,023
Yeah , but where l grew up there was
this station called K-Jazz 1 03.

522
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,943
And people would just put on that station
when they had a cocktail party...

523
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,278
Right.

524
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,530
And everyone would
kinda just talk over it.

525
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,614
I know.

526
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:20,116
- 'Cause it was. . .
- That's the prob--

527
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,577
Okay, okay. So l think
that's part of the problem ,

528
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,453
is that you can't hear it, you know?
You have to see it.

529
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,789
You have to see what's at stake.
l mean , look at these fellas.

530
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,167
Look at the sax player
right now.

531
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,460
He just hijacked the song .
He's on his own trip.

532
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,171
Every one of these guys
is composing ,

533
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,964
they're rearranging ,
they're writing .

534
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,549
Then they're playing the melody.
They're just--

535
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,009
And now look,
the trumpet player.

536
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,552
He's got his own idea.

537
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:44,140
And so, it's conflict,
and it's compromise, and it's just...

538
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,600
lt's new every time.

539
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,145
It's brand-new every night.
lt's very, very exciting .

540
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,739
And it's dying .
lt's dying , Mia.

541
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,282
It's dying on the vine.

542
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,660
And the world says, "Let it die.
lt had its time."

543
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,579
Wel l , not on my watch .

544
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:11,459
- What are you gonna do?
- l'm gonna have my own club.

545
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,127
- Really?
- Yes.

546
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:16,005
We're gonna play whatever we want,
whenever we want,

547
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:20,301
however we want,
as long as it's pure jazz.

548
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,678
<i>Hi, this is Mia Dolan.</i>

549
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,518

550
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:30,895
Okay.

551
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,275

or follow my rules.

00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:43,908
I can do it a different way.

556
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,369
No, that's fine.
Thank you very much . Thank you .

557
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:51,874
Yeah , l just missed a call .

- I got a callback!
- What? Come on ! For what?

559
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,347

- Congratulations! That's incredible!
- lt's really exciting .

562
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,020
I feel l ike l said negative stuff
about it before.

563
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,814
- What?
- lt's like <i>Rebel Without a Cause.</i>

564
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:15,982
Sort of.

565
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,317
"I got the bullets! "

566
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,194
Yes.

surround-sound set-up, so it's Iike--</i>

602
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,590
- It's like being in a movie theater.
- Wow.

603
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,091
But better than being
i n a theater, really.

604
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,052
- I can't wait.
- You know theaters these days.

605
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,970
- Yeah .
- They're so dirty.

606
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,430
Yeah , l know. And smelly.

607
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,098
And they're either
too hot or too cold .

608
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:19,850
I know. The quality's
really fallen off.

609
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,353
The quality's terri ble.
And there's always people talking .

610
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,979
- Because--
- Which is just. . . Oh , it's the worst!

611
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,233
- Oh , l'm sorry. Hold on one second .
- The texting .

612
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:29,235
Hello?

613
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:30,861
- Probably work.
- Mmm .

- Well , we have to come. Maybe.
- You should . Come by.

616
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,518
- I got one word for you , man .
- Mmm-hmm?

617
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,854
- Indonesia.
- Never heard anyone say that.

618
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:09,024
I don't even know. l can't keep track
of it, but honestly, it was life-changing .

619
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,360
- Really?
- Yeah . lt affected me.

620
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,946
- It was incredible.
- ls it amazing?

621
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,240
- Yes.
- A five-star jungle eco-resort

622
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,117
- you would not bel ieve.
- Amazing .

623
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,535
We were thinking about N icaragua.

624
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,371
The thing about Nicaragua is it's less
developed , it's a little under-developed .

625
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,455
Right.

626
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:27,209
I think there's a little more-- Yeah ,
then , l just don't know if it's safe.

627
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:28,961
- Yeah , yeah . lt's. . .
- You know?

628
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,170
Yeah , you don't want
to explore too far.

629
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:31,755
Kind of a "natives are restless"
sort of thing .

630
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:36,802
Actually, China's going
to build a canal .

631
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,119
L'm sorry.

What is that?
ls it a script?

648
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,922
It's a play.

649
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:13,842
A play?
You better give us al l roles!

650
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:17,763
Actually, it's a one-woman show!
So l can't.

651
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:25,562
Wow. ls that gonna
happen every time?

652
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,272
I think so.

01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:01,987
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you , Mia.

674
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,488
Nice to meet you .

675
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,666
"The end ."

676
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,631
- Genius.
- Really?

677
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:23,341
- Yes. Yes.
- Really?

678
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:24,676
It feels really nostalgic to me.

679
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,219
- Is it too nostalgic?
- That's the point. That's--

680
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,722
Are people gonna l ike it?

681
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,349
- Fuck 'em .
- You always say that.

682
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:35,103
- Well , l truly believe it.
- l made you something .

683
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,856
- For what?
- For your club.

684
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:40,984
Why does it say "Seb's"?

685
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,652
'Cause l think you should call it "Seb's."

686
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:43,737
- What?
- 'Cause no one will come

687
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,405
to "Chicken on a Stick."

688
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,407
Is that a music note
as an apostrophe?

689
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,742
- Yes! Yeah .
- That's pretty cool .

690
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,952
It's gotta be "Chicken on a Stick"'

691
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:52,871
because Charlie Parker
got his nickname--

692
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,290
I know, because he loved chicken .

693
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,585
That's why they called hi m "Bird ."

694
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,421
So l'm gonna have chicken , beer, jazz.
"Chicken on a Stick."

695
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,799
I know. You should drop the chicken
and just have drinks and jazz, and also--

696
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,969
- L'm not droppin' the chicken .
- You could maybe do it somewhere else.

697
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:09,304
- What are you talk--
- Find a new spot.

698
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:10,847
It's gotta be the Van Beek.

699
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,223
Wel l , it doesn't have to be the Van Beek.

700
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,768
I can't let them samba
all over its history.

701
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,770
I can't do it.

702
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:21,691
- You can let them , but you refuse to.
- Your play's incredible.

703
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:25,945
You know, the whole world
from your bedroom .

704
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:29,032
What else do they want?
Who's doing that?

705
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:32,327
- L'm doi ng that.
- You're doing that.

706
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:37,624
Who was that guy at The Lighthouse?
The guy that offered you the gig?

707
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:38,833
- Keith .
- Yeah .

708
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:43,004
- Why was it so weird between you two?
- lt's always weird with him .

709
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:44,339
- Really?
- Yeah .

710
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:47,675
But he seemed kinda nice
'cause he did offer you a job.

711
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,889
- Are you gonna call him?
- No. No.

712
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,891
All right.

713
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:58,228
So. . . Here's what we know.

714
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,105
Yeah?

715
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:03,608
It's definitely
"Chicken on a Stick"'

716
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,735
and your play
is gonna be a triumph .

717
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,949
It's a one-woman show,
so it's just me...

718
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:13,535
No, l mean , l'm acting in it, too.

719
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:18,832
No, Mom , l'm not getting paid .
l'm paying to do it.

720
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:23,795
He's great. He's gonna
open his own jazz club.

721
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,505
Yeah , it's gonna be incredible.

722
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:29,717
No, he hasn't.
He hasn't opened it yet.

723
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:31,052
He needs some...

724
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,933
He's saving up, l think.

725
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,066
No, he doesn't have a steady gig .

726
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,944
But he's figuring it out,
it's just been a little tricky lately.

727
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:55,243
Mom , he's gonna find a way to open it
and you're gonna love it, okay?

728
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:56,578
How's Dad?

729
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:07,714
Sebastian .
Come on in , man .

730
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,134
- Thanks for comin'.
- Thanks for having me.

731
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,553
Wasn't sure l'd see you today.

732
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,513
- So. . . Here's the deal .
- Okay.

733
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:18,516
We got distribution with Universal .
We've got our own imprint.

734
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,018
About to go on the road .

735
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:22,145
Uh , we can pay you 1 ,000 bucks a week,

736
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,356
plus a cut of the ticket revenue
and merchandising .

737
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,066
Sound good?

738
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,613
- Sebastian? All right.
- Yeah .

739
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:32,947
- Let's play.
- Okay.

740
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,920
<i>Tonight.</i>

741
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:33,091
I know. lt's different.

742
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,554
But you say
you wanna save jazz.

743
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:40,098
How you gonna save jazz
if no one's l istening?

744
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,642
Jazz is dying
because of people like you .

745
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:46,938
You're playin' to 90-year-olds
at The Lighthouse.

746
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,482
Where are the kids?
Where are the young people?

747
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:53,945
You're so obsessed with Kenny Clarke
and Thelonious Monk.

748
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:55,697
These guys were revolutionaries.

749
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:59,867
How are you gonna be a revolutionary
if you're such a traditionalist?

750
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:03,746
You're holdin' onto the past,
but jazz is about the future.

751
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,545
I know.

752
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,548
The other guy,
he wasn't as good as you .

753
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:17,719
But you're a pain in the ass, man .

754
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:00,595
<i>City of stars</i>

755
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:07,018

<i>Who knows?</i>

759
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:24,786
<i>I felt it from the first embrace
I shared with you</i>

760
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:30,083
<i>That now our dreams</i>

01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,002

764
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:47,892
<i>There in the bars</i>

765
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:53,856
<i>Or through the smokescreen
of the crowded restaurants</i>

766
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,984
<i>It's love</i>

767
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:59,779
<i>Yes, all we 're Iookin ' for is Iove</i>

768
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:03,241
<i>From someone else</i>

769
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:05,535
<i>- A rush
- A glance</i>

770
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,954
<i>- A touch
- A dance</i>

771
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,998
<i>A look in somebody's eyes</i>

772
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:13,167
<i>To light up the skies</i>

773
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:16,504
<i>To open the world
and send it reeling</i>

774
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:19,716
<i>A voice that says "l'Il be here "</i>

775
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:22,218
<i>And you'll be all right</i>

776
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:28,099
<i>I don 't care if I know</i>

777
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,226
<i>Just where I will go</i>

778
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:33,688
<i>'Cause all that l need's
this crazy feeling</i>

779
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:37,859
<i>The rat-tat-tat of my heart</i>

780
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:41,195
<i>Think I want it to stay</i>

781
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,392

01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:18,485
- It's gonna be incredible.
- You don't get it, but l'm terrified .

843
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:22,489
They should be so lucky to see it.
l can't wait.

844
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:24,033
I can .

845
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:27,494
When do you leave,
the morning?

846
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:30,706
Yeah . 6:45.

847
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:31,832
- Ooh .
- Boise.

848
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,919
- Boise?
- Boise.

849
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:36,629
To Boise!

850
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:40,883
You should come.

851
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:43,552
To Boise?

852
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:45,304
Yeah , you can knock that
off your bucket list.

853
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:49,391
Oh , that would be. . . really exciting .
l wish l could .

854
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:50,726
What are you doi ng after the tour?

855
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:53,562
Why can't you?

856
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:54,813
- Come to Boise?
- Yeah .

857
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:56,315
'Cause l have to rehearse.

858
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:58,400
But can't you
rehearse anywhere?

859
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:04,490
Anywhere you are?

860
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,408
I mean , l guess.

861
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:10,871
Um . . . well , all my stuff is here,
and it's in two weeks,

862
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:13,707
so l don't really think
that would be...

863
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:18,170
- Okay. Well .
- the best idea right now, but...

864
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,422
l wish l could .

865
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:22,383
We're just gonna have to try
and see each other.

866
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:23,676
We al most never see each other.

867
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,344
I know, but when are you done?

868
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:29,181
What do you mean? l mean ...

869
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,350
When are you finished
with the whole tour?

870
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:35,312
After we finish , we're gonna go
and record , and then we go back on tour.

871
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:36,855
You know, we tour so we can
make the record ,

872
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,191
so we can go back
and tour the record .

873
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,364
So it's like the long haul?

874
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:50,286
What do you mean ,
"the long haul"?

875
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:54,623
I mean the long haul , li ke you're gonna
stay in this band for a long time.

876
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,418
On tour.

877
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:00,921
What did you think l was gonna do?

878
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:03,924
I don't. . .
l hadn't really thought it through .

879
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:05,217
I didn't know that the band ...

880
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,013
- was so important.
- You didn't think it would be successful?

881
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:11,682
Um ...

882
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,519
No, that's not really what l mean .
l just mean that you ...

883
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:19,315
You're gonna be on tour for,
what, months now? Years?

884
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:20,941
Yeah . l don't believe--
This is it.

885
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:23,444
I mean , it could feasibly be...

886
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:26,238
l could be on tour with this
for a couple of years, at least.

887
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:28,032
J ust this record .

888
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:31,368
Do you like the music you're playing?

889
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:34,997
I don't...

890
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:38,667
l don't know what it matters.

891
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:41,837
Wel l , it matters, because if you're gonna
give up your dream ,

892
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,842
l think it matters that you like
what you're playing on the road for years.

893
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:50,846
Do you like the music
l'm playing?

894
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:54,892
Yeah . l do.

895
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:57,311
I just didn't think that you did .

896
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:59,813
- Yeah , well . . .
- You always said Keith is the worst,

897
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:02,983
and now you're gonna be on tour with him
for years, so l just didn't...

898
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,568
- What are you doing right now?
- know if you were happy.

899
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:05,694
- Why are you doing this?
- l don't...

900
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,905
- What do you mean , why am l doing this?
- l thought you wanted me to do this.

901
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:09,740
It just sounds like now
you don't want me to do it.

902
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:12,326
What do you mean ,
l wanted you to do this?

903
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,536
This is what you wanted for me.

904
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:15,662
To be in this band?

905
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:18,499
To be in a band .
To have a steady job, you know?

906
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:21,919
To be. . . you know.

907
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,962
Of course l wanted you
to have a steady job,

908
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:26,006
so that you could take care of yourself
and your l ife

909
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:27,341
and you could start your club.

910
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:29,802
So l'm doing that, so l don't understand .
Why aren't we celebrating?

911
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,804
Why aren't you starting your club?

912
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,390
You said yourself no one
wants to go to that club.

913
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,517
No one wants to go to a cl ub
called "Chicken on a Stick."

914
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,684
So change the name!

915
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:39,937
Wel l , no one likes jazz!
Not even you !

916
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,855
I do like jazz now because of you !

917
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:44,358
And this is what l thought
you wanted me to do!

918
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:47,653
What am l supposed to do?
Go back to playing "Jingle Bells"?

919
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:48,737
L'm not saying that.

920
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:49,947
L'm saying why don't you take
what you've made and start the cl ub?

921
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,699
Scraping pennies so l can start a club
no one wants to go to?

922
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:55,619
People will want to go to it
because you're passionate about it,

923
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:57,996
and people love what other people
are passionate about.

924
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,457
- You remind people of what they forgot.
- Not i n my experience.

925
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:07,798
Wel l , whatever, all right?
lt's just time to grow up, you know?

926
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:09,967
I have a steady job,
this is what l'm doing .

927
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,718
And now all of a sudden
if you had these problems,

928
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,512
l wish you would have said them earlier,

929
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,055
before l signed
on the goddamn dotted l ine!

930
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:16,849
L'm pointing out that you had a dream

931
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,684
that you followed ,
that you were sticking to...

932
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,894
This is the dream !
This is the dream .

933
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:22,229
This is not your dream !

934
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:24,565
Guys like me work their whole lives
to be in something

935
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:27,734
that's successful , that people like.
You know?

936
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:31,655
I mean , l'm finally in something
that people enjoy.

937
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:33,073
Since when do you care
about being li ked?

938
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:34,658
J ust 'cause l don't enjoy it,
it doesn't matter.

939
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,660
Why do you care so much
about being li ked?

940
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:38,745
You're an actress!
What are you talking about?

941
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,599
Maybe you just liked me
when l was on my ass

942
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,767
'cause it made you
feel better about yourself.

943
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:07,816
- Are you kidding?
- No.

944
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,130
I don't know.

945
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:52,838
Okay, fellas.
l'll see ya tomorrow.

946
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,172
- Sebastian?
- Yeah?

947
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:55,882
You're good for tonight, right?

948
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:58,510
What are you talking about?

949
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:01,179
7:00, the photo shoot.

950
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:03,515
<i>MOJO.</i> Are you good?

951
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:09,605
- I thought that was next Thursday.
- No, it's tonight.

952
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,650
Is that okay?

953
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,958
- Give me the other camera!
- What's wrong with that one?

954
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:15,462
"What's wrong with that one?" lt doesn't
bloody work, that's what's wrong with it!

955
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:17,255

Okay, now just move your glasses

A little bit further, just a little bit,
a touch further.

968
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,711
Keep your head down ,
but look up at me.

969
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:57,462
Look sort of moody.

Okay, turn the keyboard on l ive!

Do you wanna hear
the keyboard then?

973
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:07,389
You don't have to bite your lip now.

974
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:09,933
Wel l , actually play something .

that shit with the window?

985
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:27,636

All of this.

999
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:38,415
L'm done embarrassing myself.
l'm done, l'm done.

1000
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,167
- Nobody showed up.
- So what? So what?

1001
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:43,670
I can't pay back the theater.
This is so...

- This is home.
- No, it's not anymore.

1005
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:11,651
- Yep?
<i>- Hi, I'm trying to reach Mia Dolan.</i>

1006
01:32:12,986 --> 01:32:14,237
Wrong number.

1007
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,865
<i>She's not answering her cell.
I was told I might find her here.</i>

1008
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,199
Not anymore.

1009
01:32:18,283 --> 01:32:20,452
- <i>Okay, well, if you do talk to her. .</i> .
- l won't.

1010
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:22,245
<i>...could you tell her Jane
at Amy Brandt Casting</i>

1011
01:32:22,328 --> 01:32:23,872
<i>is trying to reach her?</i>

1012
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:30,962
Casting?

1013
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:40,847
Who the hell is that?

1014
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:47,729
Shut that thing off!

1015
01:32:58,448 --> 01:32:59,699
<i>Why did you come here ?</i>

1016
01:32:59,783 --> 01:33:02,035
- Because l have good news.
- What?

1017
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:05,747
Amy Brandt,
the casting director?

1018
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:09,209
- Yeah .
- She was at your play, and she loved it.

1019
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:13,213
And she loved it so much that she wants
you to come i n tomorrow

1020
01:33:13,296 --> 01:33:15,965
and audition for this huge movie
that she's got.

1021
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:19,594
L'm not going to that.

1022
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:22,972
- L'm not going to that.
- What?

1023
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:25,767
That one's gonna be. . .
No. That one's gonna be...

1024
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,102
l'm sorry?

1025
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:29,020
That will kill me.

1026
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:31,940
- What?!
- What?

1027
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,858
What? Shh ! Stop!

1028
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:35,401
- No!
- Shh ! Shh !

1029
01:33:35,485 --> 01:33:37,612
You have to be quiet.
We're in a neighborhood .

1030
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:39,781
If you want me to be quiet,
you have to make some goddamn sense!

1031
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,116
- Tell me why you're not going .
- They'll cal l the police.

1032
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:42,242
- Because. Because. . .
- Why?

1033
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:44,994
L've been to a million auditions,
and the same thing happens every time

1034
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:47,914
where l get interrupted because someone
wants to get a sandwich !

1035
01:33:47,997 --> 01:33:50,625
Or l'm crying ,
and they start laughing !

1036
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:52,752
Or there's people
sitting in the waiting room ,

1037
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:57,048
and they're like me, but prettier
and better at the--

1038
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:58,758
Because maybe
l'm not good enough !

1039
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:01,136
- Yes, you are.
- No...

1040
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:02,762
- No, maybe l'm not.
- Yes, you are.

1041
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:03,930
- Maybe l'm not.
- You are.

1042
01:34:04,013 --> 01:34:05,640
- Maybe l'm not.
- You are.

1043
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:11,813
Maybe l'm one of those people
that has always wanted to do it,

1044
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:15,108
but it's l ike a pipe dream for me,
you know?

1045
01:34:15,191 --> 01:34:16,651
And then , you said it,

1046
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:19,571
you change your dreams,
and then you grow up.

1047
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:21,823
Maybe l'm one of those people,
and l'm not supposed to.

1048
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:23,950
And l can go back to school ,

1049
01:34:24,033 --> 01:34:26,161
and l can find something else
l'm supposed to do.

1050
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:30,248
'Cause l left to do that,
and it's been six years,

1051
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:31,916
and l don't want to do it anymore.

1052
01:34:35,628 --> 01:34:36,880
Why?

1053
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:42,093
- Why what?
- Why don't you want to do it anymore?

1054
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:46,639
'Cause l think it hurts
a l ittle bit too much .

1055
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:50,143
You're a baby.

1056
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:53,104
- L'm not a baby. l'm trying to grow up.
- You are.

1057
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:54,772
- You're crying like a baby.
- Oh , my God .

1058
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:57,942
You have an audition tomorrow at 5:30.

1059
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:00,737
L'll be out front at 8:00 A. M .

1060
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:03,198
You'll be out front or not,
l don't know.

1061
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:06,367
How'd you find me here?

1062
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:09,454
The house
i n front of the library.

1063
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:54,707
- I got coffee.
- Okay, great.

1064
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:14,060
Mia?

1065
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:22,360
Hi , Mia. l'm Amy
and this is Frank.

1066
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:23,736
Hi . How are ya?

1067
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:26,072
- Nice to meet you .
- Glad we found you .

1068
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:27,615
Me, too.

1069
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:33,871
The film shoots in Paris,
and we don't have a script.

1070
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:35,456
It's gonna be a process.

1071
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:37,583
We're gonna build the character
around the actress.

1072
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:40,336
It's a three month rehearsal
and a four month shoot.

1073
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:44,090
Okay.

1074
01:36:44,173 --> 01:36:47,719
And we thought that you
could just tell us a story.

1075
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:49,053
About?

1076
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:52,807
- You can just tell us anything .
- Anything?

1077
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:55,685
Yeah , just tell us a story.
You're a storyteller.

1078
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:57,895
Um ...

1079
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:03,026
Whenever you're ready.

1080
01:37:12,869 --> 01:37:15,079
My aunt used to l ive in Paris.

1081
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,085
I remember she used to come home

1082
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:26,424
and she would tell us these stories
about being abroad , and ...

1083
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:30,094
l remember...

1084
01:37:31,387 --> 01:37:34,599
She told us that she jumped
i nto the river once.

1085
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:38,728
Barefoot

1086
01:37:39,979 --> 01:37:42,815
She smiled

1087
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:47,111
<i>Leapt without Iooking</i>

1088
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:54,410
<i>And tumbled into</i>

1089
01:37:55,745 --> 01:37:56,996
<i>The Seine</i>

1090
01:38:00,166 --> 01:38:04,170
<i>The water was freezing</i>

1091
01:38:04,253 --> 01:38:08,758
<i>She spent a month sneezing</i>

1092
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:13,471
<i>But said
she would do it again</i>

1093
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:21,562
<i>Here 's to the ones who dream</i>

1094
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:29,570
<i>Foolish as they may seem</i>

1095
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:37,412
<i>Here 's to the hearts that ache</i>

1096
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:44,627
<i>Here 's to the mess we make</i>

1097
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:49,757
<i>She captured a feeling</i>

1098
01:38:49,841 --> 01:38:53,010
<i>Sky with no ceiling</i>

1099
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:57,181
<i>The sunset inside a frame</i>

1100
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:02,728
<i>She Iived in her liquor</i>

1101
01:39:02,812 --> 01:39:05,857
<i>And died with a flicker</i>

1102
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:10,069
<i>I'Il always remember the flame</i>

1103
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:17,535
<i>Here 's to the ones who dream</i>

1104
01:39:18,578 --> 01:39:24,417
<i>Foolish as they may seem</i>

1105
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:30,465
<i>Here 's to the hearts that ache</i>

1106
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:34,927
<i>Here 's to the mess we make</i>

1107
01:39:35,011 --> 01:39:38,473
<i>She told me</i>

1108
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:41,392
<i>A bit of madness is key</i>

1109
01:39:42,518 --> 01:39:45,771
<i>To give us new colors to see</i>

1110
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:52,028
<i>Who knows where it will Iead us?</i>

1111
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:56,532
<i>And that's why they need us</i>

1112
01:39:56,616 --> 01:39:59,785
<i>So bring on the rebels</i>

1113
01:39:59,869 --> 01:40:02,413
<i>The ripples from pebbles</i>

1114
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:06,792
<i>The painters and poets and plays</i>

1115
01:40:06,876 --> 01:40:10,588
<i>And here 's to the fools</i>

1116
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:13,466
<i>Who dream</i>

1117
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:18,804
<i>Crazy as they may seem</i>

1118
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:24,018
<i>Here 's to the hearts that break</i>

1119
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:27,063
<i>Here 's to the mess</i>

1120
01:40:27,146 --> 01:40:29,732
<i>We make</i>

1121
01:40:33,528 --> 01:40:35,029
<i>I</i>

1122
01:40:35,112 --> 01:40:38,616
<i>Trace it all back to then</i>

1123
01:40:41,410 --> 01:40:47,041
<i>Her and the snow
and the Seine</i>

1124
01:40:50,169 --> 01:40:53,589
<i>Smiling through it</i>

1125
01:40:55,174 --> 01:40:59,345
<i>She said she'd do it</i>

1126
01:41:02,265 --> 01:41:03,724
<i>Again.</i>

1127
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,657
When do you find out?

1128
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:23,035
Oh , they said the next couple days.

1129
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:25,538
But l'm not expecting
to find anything out.

1130
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:26,872
You're gonna get it.

1131
01:41:26,956 --> 01:41:28,291
- I really might not.
- Yes, you are.

1132
01:41:28,374 --> 01:41:31,043

- Griffith Park.
- <i>Where. . .</i> are we?

1136

I know.

1137
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:48,561
I don't know.

1138
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:53,149
What do we do?

1139
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:56,193
I don't think
we can do anything ,

1140
01:41:56,277 --> 01:41:59,196
- 'cause when you get this. . .
- lf l get this.

1141
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:04,076
When you get this, you gotta give it
everythi ng you got.

Everything .

Stay here
