1
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:57,179
Go, go!

2
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:31,171
Approaching,

3
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:42,015
I think we have touchdown,

4
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:49,690
Little to the right,

5
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,629
Hello, mum,

6
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:17,968
Now, push it in,

7
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:22,431
I can't,

8
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:24,016
What do you mean you can't?
Pretend it's your dick, man,

9
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:26,727
How about I pretend it's your dick?

10
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:28,270
You'll never get in if you did that,

11
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:31,523
- Here, Let me have a shot,
- Give me a second,

12
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:33,900
- No, come on,
My dick, man, - Go,

13
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:40,991
Fucker,

14
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:45,996
- Got that,
- Yeah,

15
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:49,750
Here we go,

16
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,050
- Oh, look at that,
- Nice 155, huh? - Yeah,

17
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:02,262
It's going to
do some fucking damage,

18
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:05,349
Hey, Eldridge, looks like
we're going to need a charge,

19
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:06,683
I got that,

20
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:10,270
Figured four blocks that'll
give us about 20 pounds of bang total,

21
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:12,939
That blast is going to
roast straight out there,

22
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:16,109
The shell will probably kick out there,
and most of the shrapnel

23
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,362
is going to shoot straight up
in a beautiful umbrella pattern,

24
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:19,154
Yep,

25
00:03:20,238 --> 00:03:22,824
We're gonna get some smaller pieces
and shell fragments this way,

26
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,868
but we'll be okay
if we're behind the Humvee,

27
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,912
- Bring the bot back, we'll load it up,
- No problem,

28
00:03:29,873 --> 00:03:31,333
Bot is moving,

29
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:47,891
Let me know what you got, Eldridge,

30
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:49,351
Good to go,

31
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:52,145
All right, Wagon's
set up, Bot moves,

32
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:56,691
Uh-oh, We got goats, guys,

33
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,652
Goats 12:00, Watch out,

34
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,862
Load them little bastards up,

35
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:19,005
- Oh, shit,
- Shit,

36
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,217
Oh, fuck,

37
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:24,511
Wagon's having a bad day, boys,

38
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:26,513
- You build that?
- No, the U, S, Army did,

39
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:28,849
All right, Looks like
I'm going down there,

40
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:31,059
You don; t like waiting around
this beautiful neighborhood?

41
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:32,018
Oh, I love it,

42
00:04:41,987 --> 00:04:44,406
So, if everything looks okay,
when I get down there

43
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:46,783
I'm just going
to set it up and bip it,

44
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:48,743
Give these people
something to think about,

45
00:04:49,494 --> 00:04:51,746
Want them to know if they're gonna leave
a bomb on the side of the road for us,

46
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:53,498
we're just going to blow up
their little fuckin' road,

47
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,332
Sounds good,

48
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:57,878
Craving a burger; is that strange?

49
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,671
- Not for you,
- No, okay,

50
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:01,172
Helmet on,

51
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:03,466
Happy trails,

52
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:13,518
Blaster One, can you read me?

53
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,729
Roger that, Blaster one,
You're good to go,

54
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:23,194
You're looking good, Blaster One,

55
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:44,758
Nice and hot in here,

56
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:52,974
One fifty,

57
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:55,185
Roger that, 150 meters

58
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:10,241
Hi,

59
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:12,452
- Where are you from?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

60
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:13,953
Where are you from?
Where are you from?

61
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:15,413
California?

62
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:16,790
- Hey, get out of here, man,
- Where?

63
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:19,250
Hey, this ain't no fuckin' meet
and greet, Now get out of here,

64
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:20,919
Now,

65
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,173
Go,

66
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:35,934
You making friends again, Sanborn?

67
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:37,644
All day long,

68
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:46,111
Twenty-five,

69
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:49,489
Twenty-five meters, Roger that,
You are now in the kill zone,

70
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:53,159
Thanks for reminding me,

71
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:55,286
That's what I'm here for, baby,

72
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:57,705
Okay-

73
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:07,757
The debts look good,

74
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:09,676
Roger that,

75
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,666
I'm laying on the charge...

76
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,043
Nice and sweet,

77
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:47,255
We're good to go,

78
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:49,132
I'm coming back,

79
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:54,554
- Five meters out,
- Five meters, Roger that,

80
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:56,097
Hey, Sanborn

81
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:59,601
- You know what this place needs?
- I'm listening,

82
00:08:00,184 --> 00:08:01,311
Needs grass,

83
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:04,898
We gonna start our grass business?

84
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:05,982
That's right, man

85
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:10,069
I'm going to sell the grass,
you're going to cut it,

86
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,448
It's going to be called
"Sanborn and Sons",

87
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,451
We'll be rich,

88
00:08:17,994 --> 00:08:21,247
I like that, Crabgass,
St, Augustine, man,

89
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:22,999
I'm a scholar on this shit,

90
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,837
How about this?
You sell it, I fertilize it, (Laughs)

91
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:31,799
- 25,
- 25 meters, Roger that,

92
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:33,384
Sanborn!

93
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:36,429
Butcher shop, 2:00,
dude has a phone!

94
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:37,805
Why is Eldridge running?

95
00:08:38,723 --> 00:08:40,892
- Make him put it down!
- Put down the phone!

96
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:42,727
Come on, guys, Talk to me,

97
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:45,563
Drop the phone!
Drop your phone!

98
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:48,107
Hey, burn him, Eldridge, Burn him!

99
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:50,610
- Put down the cell phone!
- Eldridge, burn him!

100
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,487
- Get out of the way,
- Drop your phone!

101
00:08:52,528 --> 00:08:54,405
Make him put it down!
Go get it!

102
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:57,784
- Come on, Eldridge!
- I can't get him in sight!

103
00:09:14,217 --> 00:09:15,635
Thompson!

104
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:45,915
Anywhere's good,

105
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:09,397
- Is that everything?
- Yeah,

106
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:46,559
Yeah?

107
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:52,106
Come in,

108
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,693
Sergeant James,

109
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:01,115
JT Sanborn, my man,

110
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:03,159
Hey, Hi, how are you? Will,
I'm Will,

111
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,244
Welcome to Bravo Company;
welcome to Camp Victory,

112
00:11:05,286 --> 00:11:07,914
Camp Victory?
I thought this was Camp Liberty,

113
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:10,791
Oh, no, They changed
that about a week ago,

114
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,043
Victory sounds better,

115
00:11:13,044 --> 00:11:15,713
- All right, Well, at least
I'm in the right place, right? - Yeah,

116
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:17,757
While you're here, can you help me
move this thing real quick?

117
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:18,841
Yeah, no problem,

118
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:20,968
Maybe you shouldn't take this down,

119
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,595
We get a lot of mortars at night,

120
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:25,890
The plywood on the windows help
with the lateral fray coming through,

121
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:27,058
That's why it's up there,

122
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:29,644
Yeah, well, it's not going
to stop a mortar round

123
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:31,145
from coming in through
the roof, you know,

124
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:34,482
Besides, I like the sunshine,

125
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:38,110
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Thompson,

126
00:11:38,152 --> 00:11:40,488
- I know he was a good tech,
- Yeah, he was,

127
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:42,949
He was a great team leader too,

128
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,910
Yeah, I'm not trying
to fill his shoes or anything,

129
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:47,578
I'm just...
I'm just going to do my best,

130
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:50,706
- Appreciate it,
- All right,

131
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:52,291
Cool,

132
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,171
Home sweet home, right?

133
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:07,223
Aren't you glad the Army has
all these tanks parked here?

134
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:10,267
Just in case the Russians come
we have to have a big tank battle,

135
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,355
I'd rather be on the side with the tanks,
just in case, rather than not have them,

136
00:12:14,397 --> 00:12:15,731
Yeah, but they don; t do anything,

137
00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:18,818
Anyone comes alongside
a Humvee we're dead,

138
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:21,195
Anybody even looks
at you funny we're dead,

139
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:24,407
Pretty much the bottom line is
if you're in Iraq, you're dead,

140
00:12:24,448 --> 00:12:26,158
How's a fuckin' tank
supposed to stop that?

141
00:12:26,242 --> 00:12:28,744
- Would you shut up, Owen?
- Sorry,

142
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,996
Just trying to scare the new guy,

143
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:33,874
I saw a little bit in Afghanistan too,

144
00:12:43,008 --> 00:12:45,553
- Get your eyes on the road, Eldridge,
- Copy that,

145
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:52,935
Move,

146
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,311
Move!

147
00:13:31,515 --> 00:13:33,559
Blaster One, this is Victory Main,

148
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:35,853
Have you reached your 10-20, yet? Over,

149
00:13:45,988 --> 00:13:47,489
Where the hell are the guys
who called this in?

150
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:06,675
Victory Main, Victory Main,
this is Blaster Mike,

151
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:09,762
Interrogative, do you have
an update on position? Over,

152
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:18,604
Victory Main, figures to follow,
Three-four-five-three is your grid,

153
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:28,197
Well, that's exactly where the hell I am
and I don; t see anybody in fatigues,

154
00:14:28,238 --> 00:14:30,366
Give us a second to confirm,

155
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:32,660
Watch your feet,

156
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:36,205
Set visual
is three-four five-three,

157
00:14:36,914 --> 00:14:38,207
Got the Humvee,

158
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:42,795
Friendly!

159
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:46,840
Friendly,

160
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,526
Ah, here we go,

161
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:08,821
They abandoned their vehicle,

162
00:15:08,862 --> 00:15:11,156
We got an empty Humvee
over here, James,

163
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,409
Yeah, I got it,

164
00:15:16,537 --> 00:15:17,496
Let's move,

165
00:15:19,998 --> 00:15:21,125
Friendly,

166
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:27,840
- Morning, boys,
- Sir,

167
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:30,217
Don't tell me the bomb's
in here with you guys,

168
00:15:31,176 --> 00:15:33,303
- Step out and I'll show you
what's going on, - All right,

169
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:35,681
Down on that block 20 meters,

170
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:37,808
this side of the mosque,
east side of the street,

171
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:39,810
our informant says he saw
a pair of wires

172
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:41,353
going into a rubble pile,

173
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:43,188
- It's a possible IED,
- Yeah,

174
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,315
- I trust this guy, I know him,
- Okay,

175
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:47,276
- I'll handle it,
- Do you want to talk him or... - No,

176
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:49,611
Good, Keep your boys back,
We'll be good, Thank you,

177
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:52,364
Specialist, bring up the Humvee,

178
00:15:52,448 --> 00:15:53,240
What's going on?

179
00:15:53,282 --> 00:15:54,491
I'm going to break out the suit,

180
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:58,078
- What about the bot?
- I'll take care of it,

181
00:15:58,412 --> 00:16:00,414
Don't you want to send the bot down
there to see what it looks like?

182
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:01,457
I'll handle it,

183
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:03,542
That's kind of tight down here, James,

184
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:20,225
Ready?

185
00:16:24,104 --> 00:16:25,063
Good?

186
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:38,368
You don; t have to go down there,
We already have the bot halfway up,

187
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,453
I'll be all right,

188
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:53,800
First day, figure you want
to take it easy, right?

189
00:17:00,474 --> 00:17:01,433
How's it looking, Eldridge?

190
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:02,893
- Good to go,
- Let's do it,

191
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:15,322
- Got two of 'em?
- Got two,

192
00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:17,032
All right, Let's rock and roll, man,

193
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:38,428
- He's a rowdy boy,
- He's reckless,

194
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:52,901
Blaster One, what's going on?

195
00:17:54,403 --> 00:17:56,113
Blaster One! What are you doing?

196
00:17:57,948 --> 00:17:59,658
Blaster One, this is Blaster Mike,

197
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,410
What's with the smoke
on the side of the road?

198
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:06,081
Hey, James, can you hear me?

199
00:18:06,164 --> 00:18:09,459
What's going on with the smoke
on the side of the road? Over,

200
00:18:10,961 --> 00:18:12,254
Creating a diversion

201
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:13,588
From what? Is there a threat?

202
00:18:14,423 --> 00:18:16,091
Eldridge, get up on the wall, Move!

203
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,220
Tell me what you see, specialist,

204
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:23,348
All right, I got him,

205
00:18:23,932 --> 00:18:25,017
He's walking down range,

206
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:27,686
James, the smoke
is killing my visibility,

207
00:18:27,728 --> 00:18:31,356
Where are you in relationship to the IED?
Are you within 100 meters yet?

208
00:18:31,982 --> 00:18:35,485
Hell, I don't know, but I'll tell you
when I'm standing over it, cowboy,

209
00:19:12,522 --> 00:19:13,857
Take cover!

210
00:19:19,988 --> 00:19:22,574
Oh, no, A car stopped
in front of him, Sanborn

211
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:25,577
Shit, James! James, come back now,

212
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:27,662
EOD pulled a nine
on this Haji in a car,

213
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:31,791
Want me to send backup?

214
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:33,627
I got it,

215
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:36,087
- Get here!
- Negative! Negative!

216
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:37,506
Stand down,

217
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:39,424
The blast will come up the block,

218
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:41,426
Stay clear around the corner,

219
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:44,304
EOD has the situation
under control, over,

220
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:47,891
Where you going?

221
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:50,227
Want to back up?

222
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:56,691
Get out of the car!

223
00:19:58,443 --> 00:19:59,903
- Get out of the car!
- Come on!

224
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:05,492
What the fuck are you doing?

225
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:09,913
Back up,

226
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:15,418
Hello?

227
00:20:30,517 --> 00:20:31,559
Want to get back?

228
00:20:53,456 --> 00:20:54,457
It's that way,

229
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:00,588
Back,

230
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,818
Taxi's moving,

231
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,612
Get out of the car!
Stop!

232
00:21:31,244 --> 00:21:33,621
Stay down!

233
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,002
Well, if he wasn't an insurgent,
he sure the hell is now,

234
00:21:40,378 --> 00:21:42,005
Roger that, That's real funny,

235
00:22:37,143 --> 00:22:38,102
Got something,

236
00:22:49,906 --> 00:22:51,032
Oh, baby,

237
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,107
Gotcha,

238
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,789
All right,

239
00:23:45,253 --> 00:23:46,629
We're done,

240
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:51,592
Good to go,

241
00:23:51,634 --> 00:23:53,094
Come down, specialist,

242
00:23:54,637 --> 00:23:55,513
Roger,

243
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:11,321
Got a wire,

244
00:24:12,822 --> 00:24:13,948
Hang on,

245
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,456
Where are you going?

246
00:24:36,262 --> 00:24:37,472
Secondary,

247
00:24:37,764 --> 00:24:38,514
Shit,

248
00:24:38,556 --> 00:24:40,224
Take cover, Get in the wall,
Get in the wall,

249
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:28,040
That wasn't so bad, First time working
together, What do you think?

250
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:35,673
I think us working together means
I talk to you and you talk to me,

251
00:26:36,465 --> 00:26:38,801
- We going on a date, Sanborn?
- No,

252
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,553
We're going on a mission,

253
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:43,806
and my job is to keep you safe
so we can keep going on missions,

254
00:26:44,098 --> 00:26:45,433
It's combat, buddy,

255
00:26:53,357 --> 00:26:54,150
Hey,

256
00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:56,027
It's just 39 days,

257
00:26:56,068 --> 00:26:57,612
Thirty-eight if we survive today,

258
00:27:16,088 --> 00:27:17,715
Hey, it's "Mr, Be All You Can Be",

259
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,717
What's up, doc?

260
00:27:20,134 --> 00:27:21,302
Not much, How are you?

261
00:27:22,345 --> 00:27:23,095
I'm good,

262
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:28,559
Got a question about that
song, "Be All You Can Be",

263
00:27:29,518 --> 00:27:32,480
What if all I can be is dead
on the side of an Iraqi road?

264
00:27:32,855 --> 00:27:34,231
I mean, I think it's logical,

265
00:27:34,273 --> 00:27:39,487
This is war, People die
all the time, Why not me?

266
00:27:40,863 --> 00:27:41,947
You got to change
the record in our head,

267
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:43,741
You gotta start thinking
about other things,

268
00:27:43,991 --> 00:27:45,493
Okay,
Stop obsessing... Right now,

269
00:27:46,285 --> 00:27:47,870
What are you thinking about?

270
00:27:48,162 --> 00:27:49,997
You want to know
what I'm thinking about, doc? Yeah,

271
00:27:50,998 --> 00:27:52,249
This is what I'm thinking about, doc,

272
00:27:54,168 --> 00:27:58,380
Here's Thompson, okay,
He's dead, He's alive,

273
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:02,218
Here's Thompson,
He's dead, He's alive,

274
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:05,096
He's dead, He's alive,

275
00:28:11,352 --> 00:28:13,687
Yo, what's up, my nigger?
What's up, man? You cool?

276
00:28:13,729 --> 00:28:16,732
Come on, You want the cool shit?
Come on, come on, It's the tight shit, man,

277
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:19,235
Wanna buy DVD?
Wanna buy DVD?

278
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:21,237
Fuck you,
Come, come, please, please,

279
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,072
New releases, Look,

280
00:28:23,114 --> 00:28:25,574
Hello, Hello,
Want to buy DVDs? Very good, Very good,

281
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:26,700
How much?

282
00:28:26,742 --> 00:28:28,202
One for five and two for nine,

283
00:28:28,244 --> 00:28:29,328
Three for twelve,

284
00:28:29,662 --> 00:28:32,331
Three for thirteen and I don; t
give you tax, Very good, man, Look,

285
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:34,250
- Look...
- No tax?

286
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,127
All right, What do you got?
What do you got,

287
00:28:36,252 --> 00:28:39,713
You know, you smart shit,
You not like those stupid fucks,

288
00:28:39,755 --> 00:28:41,340
Yeah, I'm the smart guy,

289
00:28:41,924 --> 00:28:45,052
You're a smart kid,
Give me your best one, okay?

290
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:47,638
- Here, this the best one,
- This is a good one?

291
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,765
- Yeah, The best shit, man,
- Okay,

292
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:51,475
Here you go,
I'll take one,

293
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:53,435
- Keep the change,
- Thank you,

294
00:28:53,477 --> 00:28:54,395
Want a cigarette?

295
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,772
Get out of here,
You shouldn't smoke,

296
00:28:58,858 --> 00:29:00,276
Thank you, Take it easy,

297
00:29:06,574 --> 00:29:09,410
I need to talk to you about
something before we go out again,

298
00:29:10,452 --> 00:29:11,412
What's that?

299
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:15,291
- Yesterday,
- Mm-hmm,

300
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:17,668
Wasn't cool,

301
00:29:19,211 --> 00:29:22,423
Yeah, I know,
You'll get it, though,

302
00:29:25,342 --> 00:29:27,887
- So, you're a ranger, huh?
- Yeah,

303
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:31,765
I was in intelligence seven years
before I joined EOD,

304
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,979
We ran missions in every shithole
that you could possibly imagine,

305
00:29:39,732 --> 00:29:43,402
So, I'm pretty sure I can figure out a
piece of redneck trailer trash like you,

306
00:29:45,613 --> 00:29:47,239
Looks like you're on the right track,

307
00:29:49,408 --> 00:29:50,492
We'll see you out there,

308
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:03,088
Let's go, move!

309
00:30:09,678 --> 00:30:12,473
Shit, Get out of the way, Move,

310
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:17,811
Hallo,

311
00:30:18,937 --> 00:30:21,357
- Where is it?
- It's behind the wall,

312
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,859
- All right,
- See any wires? Any smoke?

313
00:30:23,901 --> 00:30:25,027
No, I didn't look,

314
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:26,153
So, how do you know it's a bomb?

315
00:30:26,195 --> 00:30:28,530
Car has been parked illegally,

316
00:30:28,572 --> 00:30:31,700
The suspension is sagging, There's
definitely something heavy in the trunk,

317
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:35,079
Right, So, why don; t you walk over there
and peak inside and tell me what you see,

318
00:30:36,372 --> 00:30:38,165
You want me to go close to it?

319
00:30:38,957 --> 00:30:41,460
Yeah, No-no, I don't, I'm kidding,

320
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:35,055
Shit,

321
00:31:35,347 --> 00:31:36,807
It's coming from over here!

322
00:31:43,564 --> 00:31:44,565
Blaster One, You there?

323
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:52,072
Blaster One, you hear me?

324
00:31:53,699 --> 00:31:54,992
Here,

325
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:03,125
Shit,

326
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,337
Let's go, guys,

327
00:32:09,548 --> 00:32:10,549
Let it go,

328
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:12,676
I got top cover,

329
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:13,886
That's a negative, specialist,

330
00:32:13,927 --> 00:32:15,262
Eldridge, you stay with me,

331
00:32:15,304 --> 00:32:16,847
Sanborn, you take top covers,

332
00:32:16,889 --> 00:32:17,723
Shit,

333
00:32:57,929 --> 00:32:59,222
Blaster Mike in position,

334
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,666
What do you got?

335
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:28,502
I got a through and through to
the chest, but I got him stable,

336
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:30,504
He's not going to make it,

337
00:33:31,046 --> 00:33:32,839
We're leaving in 15 minutes,

338
00:33:32,881 --> 00:33:34,299
Got a survival wound, sir,

339
00:33:35,842 --> 00:33:37,052
He's not going to make it,

340
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:06,706
Oh, God,

341
00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:19,803
- What's he doing?
- I don't know,

342
00:34:24,307 --> 00:34:25,434
What are you doing?

343
00:34:25,475 --> 00:34:27,561
There's enough bang in there
to send us all to Jesus,

344
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:31,440
If I'm going to die,
I'm going to die comfortable,

345
00:34:31,857 --> 00:34:33,525
I need my kit and my cans,

346
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,402
What's going on down there, Eldridge?

347
00:34:35,861 --> 00:34:38,738
I'm getting his kit and his cans,
Cover me, please,

348
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:50,542
Kit and cans,

349
00:35:07,517 --> 00:35:11,104
Got a lot of deck cord, electrical,

350
00:35:30,248 --> 00:35:31,958
I'm looking for this initiating system

351
00:35:59,861 --> 00:36:01,446
Well, it's not in the back seat,

352
00:36:04,032 --> 00:36:05,367
I don; t think,

353
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:21,007
All right, It's not in the back seat,

354
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,269
Got a young man on the roof,
your 9:00, keep an eye on him,

355
00:36:33,478 --> 00:36:34,437
Roger that,

356
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:43,780
It's not in the front seat,

357
00:36:50,203 --> 00:36:51,579
It's not in the door,

358
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:59,212
Not on the floors,

359
00:37:03,842 --> 00:37:05,009
Not in the glove box,

360
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,804
If you haven't found it yet,
it's probably under the car,

361
00:37:07,846 --> 00:37:11,641
Yeah, No wire leads under... the car,
It's all in here somewhere,

362
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,567
- Hey, Sanborn,
- Yeah,

363
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:23,570
You got eyes on some guy,
with a video camera?

364
00:37:23,653 --> 00:37:24,654
No, Where?

365
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:28,616
He's right at my 12:00, you see him?
He's pointing the fucking thing at me,

366
00:37:39,461 --> 00:37:40,211
Shit,

367
00:37:40,253 --> 00:37:41,546
Negative, I don't see him,

368
00:37:42,088 --> 00:37:45,425
Hey, Sanborn, He's right
at my 12:00, Look! 12:00!

369
00:37:46,676 --> 00:37:47,844
Roger that, I got him,

370
00:37:52,474 --> 00:37:54,350
Getting ready to put me on You Tube,

371
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:58,188
- Little shady, - Yeah, he looks shady,
Keep and eye on him,

372
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,064
Okay, So, what's the play?

373
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:03,860
Be smart, Make a good decision, over

374
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:12,327
Got more wire,

375
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:19,584
Leads fucking nowhere,

376
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:22,462
Fuck!

377
00:38:23,713 --> 00:38:24,964
Hey, James, how you doing?

378
00:38:26,966 --> 00:38:28,343
I'm wonderful, How are you?

379
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:30,053
You know, we've been here a while,

380
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,264
We need to get out of here soon,

381
00:38:33,431 --> 00:38:34,349
Uh-huh,

382
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:42,148
We got a lot of eyes on us, James,
We need to get out of here,

383
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:46,819
Roger that, I'm going
to figure this out,

384
00:38:48,321 --> 00:38:49,864
James, we need to get out of here,

385
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:53,034
James, do you copy?

386
00:38:53,826 --> 00:38:55,411
Fuck it, I get it,

387
00:38:57,497 --> 00:39:00,041
Fuck me,

388
00:39:07,256 --> 00:39:10,176
- Hey, how's it looking in there,
soldier? - All clear,

389
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:13,221
James, the evac
is complete, We can leave,

390
00:39:13,262 --> 00:39:14,681
Let the engineers handle this mess,

391
00:39:14,764 --> 00:39:16,849
- We moving?
- That's affirmative,

392
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:32,240
Interesting,

393
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:34,367
What's up with, James?
He's not answering,

394
00:39:35,576 --> 00:39:37,620
Yeah, I think he removed his headset,

395
00:39:38,788 --> 00:39:41,708
Well, will you tell him to
put his radio back on, please?

396
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:43,418
Hey, James!

397
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:47,588
Sergeant Sanborn is asking if
you'll please put your headset back on,

398
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:56,097
Uh... that's a negative,

399
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:58,266
That, yeah, that's not going to happen,

400
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:17,452
I got eyes on three guys
at the Minaret at 6:00,

401
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,515
- What the hell is he doing?
- I don't know what the fuck he's doing,

402
00:40:39,557 --> 00:40:41,267
Looks like, he's checking the oil,

403
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,015
They're communicating
with your cameraman,

404
00:41:21,557 --> 00:41:22,808
This is real bad man,

405
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,268
Get behind the Jersey barrier,

406
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:31,192
I can't see James from here,

407
00:41:31,442 --> 00:41:32,568
Get down now!

408
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,367
We can go!

409
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:47,166
Bastard,

410
00:42:11,274 --> 00:42:12,483
We're done,

411
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:17,738
Sanborn, let's get out of here,

412
00:42:32,712 --> 00:42:33,796
Woo,

413
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,518
That was good,

414
00:42:58,237 --> 00:42:59,780
- Hey, James,
- What?

415
00:43:02,324 --> 00:43:04,243
Never turn your headset off again,

416
00:43:30,269 --> 00:43:31,645
You the guy in the bomb suit?

417
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:34,940
No, sir, Sir, that's Sergeant James,
He's right here,

418
00:43:35,441 --> 00:43:36,942
- Hey, James,
- Yeah?

419
00:43:37,443 --> 00:43:38,611
Someone's here to see you,

420
00:43:40,362 --> 00:43:42,740
You the guy in the flaming car,
Sergeant James?

421
00:43:42,782 --> 00:43:44,492
Afternoon, sir,
Uh, yes, sir,

422
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:48,287
Well, that's just hot shit,

423
00:43:48,662 --> 00:43:50,539
You're a wild man, you know that?

424
00:43:51,373 --> 00:43:53,042
- Uh, yes, sir,
- He's a wild man,

425
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,251
You know that?

426
00:43:55,211 --> 00:43:56,378
I want to shake your hand,

427
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:58,297
- Thank you, sir,
- Yeah,

428
00:43:58,506 --> 00:44:01,008
How many bombs have you disarmed?

429
00:44:01,926 --> 00:44:03,093
Uh, I'm not quite sure,

430
00:44:03,135 --> 00:44:04,345
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir,

431
00:44:04,428 --> 00:44:05,596
I asked you a question,

432
00:44:07,806 --> 00:44:08,849
Eight hundred seventy-three, sir,

433
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:12,811
Eight hundred! And seventy-three,

434
00:44:14,104 --> 00:44:15,439
That's just hot shit,

435
00:44:15,689 --> 00:44:17,358
Eight-hundred and seventy-three,

436
00:44:18,108 --> 00:44:20,110
Counting today, sir, yes,
- That's gotta be a record,

437
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:26,992
What's the best way to... go about
disarming one of these things?

438
00:44:28,452 --> 00:44:29,912
The way you don; t die, sir,

439
00:44:31,664 --> 00:44:32,873
That's a good one,

440
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,834
That's spoken
like a wild man, That's good,

441
00:44:52,643 --> 00:44:55,229
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Oh, hey, wait a minute,

00:46:47,758 --> 00:46:48,759
Owen,

485
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:51,053
Hi,

486
00:46:51,094 --> 00:46:52,304

487
00:46:53,222 --> 00:46:54,515
- I'm good,
- Good,

488
00:46:54,807 --> 00:46:57,267
- What's wrong?
- Brakes are squeaking,

489
00:46:57,935 --> 00:47:00,062
Don't trust the mechanics
around here, You know,

490
00:47:01,188 --> 00:47:03,398
- So, how you doing?
- Good,

491
00:47:03,941 --> 00:47:05,234
I just want to check the oil,

492
00:47:06,068 --> 00:47:08,654
Yeah, it's good to sleep, eating well...

493
00:47:09,488 --> 00:47:11,615
I'm feeling pretty squared
away, actually, doc,

494
00:47:11,824 --> 00:47:13,075
Good to hear it,

495
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,328
So, you getting along with the other
soldiers in your unit?

496
00:47:17,829 --> 00:47:23,210
Yeah, My team's great,
My team leader is inspiring,

497
00:47:23,877 --> 00:47:26,880
- Are you being sarcastic, soldier?
- No,

498
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:28,632

almost died yesterday,

500
00:47:31,593 --> 00:47:35,639
At least I'll die in the line
of duty, proud and strong,

501
00:47:36,098 --> 00:47:38,225
You know, this doesn; t have
to be a bad time in your life,

502
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:41,895
Going to war is a - is a once
in a lifetime experience,

503
00:47:42,229 --> 00:47:43,438
It could be fun,

504
00:47:43,689 --> 00:47:46,525
And you know this from your
extensive work in the field, right?

505
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:47,985
I've done my field duty,

506
00:47:48,569 --> 00:47:50,153
Where's that? Yale?

507
00:47:52,114 --> 00:47:55,033
Look, you don; t want me to come around,
I won't come around,

508
00:47:55,075 --> 00:47:56,368
These talks are voluntary,

509
00:47:56,994 --> 00:47:58,161
Look, I'm sorry,

510
00:47:59,121 --> 00:48:01,373

I will,

515
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:14,011
Just like every other soldier

516
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:21,935
Fire in the hole!

517
00:48:21,977 --> 00:48:23,312
Firing now,

518
00:48:27,649 --> 00:48:29,985

Fire in the hole, Fire in the hole,

521
00:48:36,241 --> 00:48:37,743
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Hold on a second,

522
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,747
Goddamn it,
I think it forgot my gloves down there,

523
00:48:41,955 --> 00:48:43,749
- What?
- I forgot my gloves,

524
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:45,083
Hang on,

525
00:49:19,576 --> 00:49:22,037
You know, these detonators
misfire all the time,

526
00:49:23,622 --> 00:49:24,664
What are you doing?

527
00:49:25,749 --> 00:49:28,043
I'm just saying shit happens,
they misfire,

528
00:49:31,254 --> 00:49:33,173
He'd be obliterated to nothing,

529
00:49:35,008 --> 00:49:36,885
His helmet would be left,
You could have that,

530
00:49:37,427 --> 00:49:39,971
Little specs of hair,
charred on the inside,

531
00:49:41,306 --> 00:49:43,183
Yeah, There'd be half
a helmet somewhere,

532
00:49:44,226 --> 00:49:45,310
bits of hair,

533
00:49:47,312 --> 00:49:49,981
Ask for a change
in technique and protocol,

534
00:49:50,023 --> 00:49:52,526
make sure this type of accident
never happen again, you know?

535
00:49:55,946 --> 00:49:57,364
You'd have to write the report,

536
00:50:00,116 --> 00:50:02,410
- Are you serious?
- I can't write it,

537
00:50:03,954 --> 00:50:06,289
No, I mean, are you serious
about killing him?

538
00:50:46,246 --> 00:50:49,457
- Twelve o'clock I see an SUV,
- Roger that,

539
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,459
I got four armed men,

540
00:50:51,876 --> 00:50:53,461
They're in Haji gear,

541
00:50:55,171 --> 00:50:56,798
All right, Go slow and easy,

542
00:51:04,806 --> 00:51:06,641
Careful now,

543
00:51:09,728 --> 00:51:11,688
All right, Careful now, guys,

544
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,399
- Eldridge, you stay on that 50,
- I got 'em,

545
00:51:14,649 --> 00:51:18,028
"Obre... obre... "
put your gun down!

546
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:21,823
On your knees!
Put your gun down!

547
00:51:21,906 --> 00:51:25,076
- Obre, motherfucker!
- Hold up your hands,

548
00:51:25,118 --> 00:51:27,203
Get down, motherfucker, Obre!

549
00:51:27,746 --> 00:51:29,914
Put your gun down now!

550
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,422
Put your gun down!

551
00:51:41,593 --> 00:51:43,178
Advance, advance...

552
00:52:03,406 --> 00:52:04,741
Hands high,

553
00:52:05,658 --> 00:52:07,702
- Eldridge, cover!
- I got you,

554
00:52:09,162 --> 00:52:10,997
Pistol, off your hip, now,

555
00:52:11,623 --> 00:52:12,415
What you want me to do?

556
00:52:12,457 --> 00:52:14,209
Keep
my hands up or take off the pistol?

557
00:52:16,628 --> 00:52:18,421
- Keep your hands up,
- Okay,

558
00:52:23,843 --> 00:52:25,428
Easy, easy,

559
00:52:26,012 --> 00:52:27,013
Got it!

560
00:52:29,307 --> 00:52:30,892
Can I touch my fucking head now?

561
00:52:32,727 --> 00:52:33,561
Slowly,

562
00:52:41,194 --> 00:52:43,530
We're on the same fucking side, guys,

563
00:52:44,906 --> 00:52:45,865
Jesus,

564
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,701
You guys are wired fucking tight,
you know that?

565
00:52:48,743 --> 00:52:51,830
Well, this is no place for a picnic,
What are you guys doing here?

566
00:52:51,871 --> 00:52:53,665
We have a flat tire,
Can you help us?

567
00:52:53,706 --> 00:52:55,333
Sure, yeah, You got any spares?

568
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:57,293
We have spares, but
we've used up our wrench,

569
00:52:57,544 --> 00:52:58,837
How do you use up a wrench?

570
00:52:58,962 --> 00:53:01,631
Well, the uh, the guy over there
with the red thing on his head,

571
00:53:01,673 --> 00:53:02,715
He threw it at someone,

572
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,343
- All right,
- Thank you,

573
00:53:09,556 --> 00:53:12,350
That's Chris, This is the wrench man,

574
00:53:12,684 --> 00:53:14,853
Hello, wrench man, That's Jimmy,

575
00:53:14,894 --> 00:53:17,313
You know, you can shoot people here,
You don; t have to throw a wrench at 'em,

576
00:53:17,355 --> 00:53:18,273
Fuck off,

577
00:53:28,157 --> 00:53:29,367
Take a look at this,

578
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:31,953
I picked these guys up in Najaf,

579
00:53:34,163 --> 00:53:35,623
Nine of hearts, that's one,

580
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:39,335
And the other...
jack of clubs,

581
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,175
- These the same guys?
- Yep, That's them,

582
00:53:49,888 --> 00:53:51,014
Does he need a little help there?

583
00:53:51,681 --> 00:53:53,433
What's the problem
with the tire? Come on,

584
00:53:55,935 --> 00:53:58,271
No good, boss,
This wrench is too small,

585
00:53:58,605 --> 00:53:59,939
All right, solutions? Anyone?

586
00:54:00,064 --> 00:54:02,609
I think there's another wrench in the
back of the Humvee if you want to check,

587
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:04,068
- I'll give it a try,
- All right, Let's do it,

588
00:54:05,737 --> 00:54:06,988
How long you guys out here?

589
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,699
Specialist, what do we got?

590
00:54:10,825 --> 00:54:16,205
- We have... 23 more days or 22...
- Oh yeah,

591
00:54:16,748 --> 00:54:20,084
No one's counting,

592
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:25,214
Contact left,

593
00:54:35,642 --> 00:54:37,101
Take cover,

594
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:40,271
Chris, take the 50, Jimmy,
take that in the Humvee,

595
00:54:40,313 --> 00:54:41,773
- Got it,
- Come on!

596
00:54:55,828 --> 00:54:56,788
Charlie, go!

597
00:54:58,081 --> 00:54:59,540
Go, go, go!

598
00:55:06,881 --> 00:55:08,007
We need more ammo,

599
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:11,803
Look inside,
Take all the go-bags, Jimmy,

600
00:55:14,097 --> 00:55:16,724
- What are we shooting at?
- I don't know,

601
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:18,601
Fuck, The packages are gone!

602
00:55:18,643 --> 00:55:20,019
They won't get far on foot,

603
00:55:20,103 --> 00:55:23,272
Bring 'em back those fuckers now,
I'm out 500,000 fucking pounds,

604
00:55:36,494 --> 00:55:37,495
I forgot,

605
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,914
it's 500,000 dead or alive,

606
00:55:43,584 --> 00:55:46,254
- Okay, Jimmy, give me
the Barret, - Okay,

607
00:55:48,464 --> 00:55:49,590
I can't see a thing,

608
00:55:51,843 --> 00:55:52,635
Come on!

609
00:55:58,224 --> 00:56:00,852
Chris is shooting wild,
Gotta conserve the ammo,

610
00:56:00,893 --> 00:56:02,186
Hey, Chris can you hear me?

611
00:56:02,937 --> 00:56:06,899
Hey, Chris! Chris! Can you hear me?
Chill out on the 50!

612
00:56:07,108 --> 00:56:08,067
Roger that,

613
00:56:10,486 --> 00:56:12,697
- Fifty's down,
- They shot Chris,

614
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:25,668
It must be coming from that building,

615
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:26,919
I can't see anything,

616
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:33,134
Movement on the roof,

617
00:56:47,189 --> 00:56:48,065
Yeah?

618
00:56:48,524 --> 00:56:49,692
Three meters higher,

619
00:56:49,942 --> 00:56:53,905
I'm going to adjust,

620
00:57:22,391 --> 00:57:23,517
Fuck

621
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:26,354
Fuck, he's dead,

622
00:57:26,729 --> 00:57:28,147
We've got to get out of here now!

623
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:28,920
Dammit,

624
00:57:28,939 --> 00:57:30,650
This is Alpha Nine,
We're in deep shit,

625
00:57:30,691 --> 00:57:31,901
I'll get on the Barret,

626
00:57:31,942 --> 00:57:32,735
Go, go, go,

627
00:57:32,818 --> 00:57:34,487
Yeah, we're taking incoming fire,

628
00:57:34,528 --> 00:57:35,446
Go, go, go,

629
00:57:35,529 --> 00:57:37,615
- No, Sanborn, don't come up here,
- Got it!

630
00:57:37,657 --> 00:57:39,408
Go, buddy, Stay low!
Stay low!

631
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:40,493
I have two KIA,

632
00:57:41,202 --> 00:57:44,830
correction, three KIA...
our grid last lock stat...

633
00:57:45,481 --> 00:57:46,240
Stay low!

634
00:57:46,248 --> 00:57:47,416
Can you get me some help?

635
00:57:49,919 --> 00:57:51,253
- Behind you,
- Yeah,

636
00:58:08,187 --> 00:58:09,397
Breathe easy,

637
00:58:11,649 --> 00:58:13,234
- I got movement,
- Yeah,

638
00:58:13,984 --> 00:58:15,319
On the ridge of that house

639
00:58:19,615 --> 00:58:21,200
Eight hundred and fifty meters,

640
00:58:22,034 --> 00:58:23,786
- See it,
- By the window,

641
00:58:24,912 --> 00:58:28,374
- You got target,
- Got it,

642
00:58:35,172 --> 00:58:36,924
All right, here little left,

643
00:58:37,925 --> 00:58:39,260
Just breathe easy,

644
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,521
- I'm out of ammo,
- Hmm?

645
00:58:51,605 --> 00:58:52,565
I'm out of ammo,

646
00:58:52,731 --> 00:58:55,109
Eldridge, we need ammo,

647
00:58:59,655 --> 00:59:00,614
Where is it?

648
00:59:01,532 --> 00:59:03,242
Check on the dead guy, man,

649
00:59:03,492 --> 00:59:04,660
It's on the dead man,

650
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,209
Eldridge!

651
00:59:12,501 --> 00:59:13,586
I'm looking,

652
00:59:16,922 --> 00:59:18,340
We need that ammo, man,

653
00:59:18,632 --> 00:59:19,633
All right, man,

654
00:59:21,427 --> 00:59:22,636
Oh, here,

All right, Got it,

Same target,

658
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:47,620
It's fucking jammed,

659
00:59:48,412 --> 00:59:49,371
Let me see it,

660
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,499
Fuck!

661
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:57,338
Aw, shit, The blood's
making it jam, Eldridge,

662
00:59:57,963 --> 00:59:58,881
Shit!

663
00:59:59,006 --> 01:00:01,216
You gotta clean the blood off, man,
It's making 'em jam,

664
01:00:01,258 --> 01:00:02,635
Specialist!

665
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,056
- Clean the blood off,
- Okay,

666
01:00:13,479 --> 01:00:14,855
Clean it, Clean it,

667
01:00:15,814 --> 01:00:16,899
You gotta clean it, man,

668
01:00:17,024 --> 01:00:18,651
- How?
- Spit and rub,

669
01:00:22,154 --> 01:00:23,030
All right,

670
01:00:24,323 --> 01:00:26,408
Spit and rub, buddy,
Spit and rub,

671
01:00:29,244 --> 01:00:32,414
It's not working, It's not coming off,

672
01:00:36,877 --> 01:00:40,381
Spit and rub, Spit and rub,
Here, take it out,

673
01:00:42,758 --> 01:00:44,593
Use your camel, Use your camel,
Where is it?

674
01:00:44,885 --> 01:00:46,845
You all right?

675
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:48,263
Here, use that,

676
01:00:52,017 --> 01:00:53,227
Just breathe, buddy,

677
01:00:53,394 --> 01:00:54,687
Come on, Just breathe in,

678
01:00:54,937 --> 01:00:57,022
Good, Here, squeeze,

Rub that ojive, baby,

01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:18,877
- Got 'em?
- Yeah,

01:01:20,003 --> 01:01:21,463
I'm going to keep
you safe, buddy, all right?

684
01:01:21,755 --> 01:01:23,507
Now let's get these bastards,
Scan your sectors,

685
01:01:23,716 --> 01:01:25,008
Scan your sectors,

686
01:01:32,975 --> 01:01:34,727
Kill that fuckin' asshole,

687
01:01:36,854 --> 01:01:38,105
Son of a bitch,

688
01:01:49,366 --> 01:01:52,578
Nice, He's down,

689
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,456
Twenty meters to
the right of the building,

690
01:02:00,919 --> 01:02:01,920
I got him,

691
01:02:04,631 --> 01:02:05,841
Fire when ready,

692
01:02:13,974 --> 01:02:16,226
He's moving, He's moving,
To the building,

693
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,729
- Follow him, You got him?
- Got him,

01:02:23,525 --> 01:02:24,526
He's down,

695
01:02:26,778 --> 01:02:29,531
Goodnight, Thanks for playing,

696
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,627
Window,
The window, At the window,

697
01:02:47,382 --> 01:02:48,425
He's still there,

698
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:06,526
Left window,
Left window, Got him?

699
01:03:06,818 --> 01:03:07,778
Got him,

700
01:03:27,422 --> 01:03:28,465
He's down,

701
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,400
- Hey, Owen,
- Yeah?

702
01:04:29,192 --> 01:04:32,028
Can you grab the juice
out of the pack please?

703
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:32,863
Sure,

704
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:46,877
I think we're out,

705
01:04:48,044 --> 01:04:50,756
- Got anything left to drink?
- You could try that one,

706
01:05:11,526 --> 01:05:12,444
Thank you,

707
01:05:38,887 --> 01:05:41,556
Drink, Drink it,

708
01:06:45,412 --> 01:06:47,122
Things are real quiet,

709
01:06:47,497 --> 01:06:50,208
Yeah, I don't like it,

710
01:07:10,228 --> 01:07:13,148
- Hey, Will?
- Yeah?

711
01:07:14,232 --> 01:07:16,026
At your six o'clock

712
01:07:16,651 --> 01:07:19,779
I see movement on the bridge,
Right on the tracks,

713
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:23,116
Well, handle it,

714
01:07:27,704 --> 01:07:29,122
Should I fire?

715
01:07:30,457 --> 01:07:31,708
It's your call, buddy,

716
01:08:01,112 --> 01:08:02,405
Good job,

717
01:08:32,936 --> 01:08:34,145
Hey, Sanborn,

718
01:08:38,775 --> 01:08:40,109
I think we're done,

719
01:08:53,665 --> 01:08:55,208
Okay? You all right?

720
01:08:58,962 --> 01:09:01,089
That's what you get for hitting
your fucking team leader, motherfucker,

721
01:09:03,967 --> 01:09:06,219
- Man,
- I'll be right back, I gotta piss,

722
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:08,096
Owen,

723
01:09:08,555 --> 01:09:10,723
Another round, boy,
That's your order,

724
01:09:10,765 --> 01:09:12,976
Well, yes, sir, Sgt, James, sir,

725
01:09:13,268 --> 01:09:14,852
You're not very good
with people, are you, sir?

726
01:09:14,894 --> 01:09:16,521
But you're a good warrior,
Give me your mug,

727
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:18,773
There ya go, sir,

728
01:09:18,815 --> 01:09:21,859
You were well on the field
of battle today, specialist,

729
01:09:22,527 --> 01:09:23,653
Cheers,

730
01:09:31,619 --> 01:09:33,288
Uh, I'm too old for this shit,

731
01:09:38,751 --> 01:09:41,462
- I was scared,
- Yeah?

732
01:09:42,088 --> 01:09:45,258
Well, everyone's a coward
about something, you know,

733
01:09:48,052 --> 01:09:50,638
You're good, You're real good,

734
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,515
Just what do we have here?

735
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:56,060
Will has possessions,

736
01:09:57,186 --> 01:09:59,105
I didn't know you owned anything, Will,

737
01:09:59,147 --> 01:10:00,773
Let's see what you got here, Will,

738
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:04,318
Who is that?

739
01:10:04,527 --> 01:10:05,862
That's my son,

740
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:10,950
He's a tough little bastard,
Nothing like me,

741
01:10:10,992 --> 01:10:12,910
You mean to tell me you married?

742
01:10:14,954 --> 01:10:18,249
Well, you know,
I had a girlfriend and...

743
01:10:18,499 --> 01:10:21,461
...she got pregnant,
so we got married,

744
01:10:22,336 --> 01:10:23,629
We got divorced,

745
01:10:26,299 --> 01:10:28,176
Or I thought we got divorced,

746
01:10:28,301 --> 01:10:31,679
She's still living in the house,
And she says we're still together,

747
01:10:31,721 --> 01:10:35,349
so I don't know,
What does that make her?

748
01:10:35,641 --> 01:10:39,103
Dumb for still being with your ass,

749
01:10:41,064 --> 01:10:42,023
Hey,

750
01:10:42,065 --> 01:10:43,524
She ain't fuckin' dumb,
all right?

751
01:10:43,816 --> 01:10:45,068
She's just loyal,

752
01:10:46,861 --> 01:10:49,489
She's just loyal, That's all,
How 'bout you guys?

753
01:10:50,531 --> 01:10:53,826
You got... you got a girl?
What do you got?

754
01:10:54,243 --> 01:10:57,705
My only problem is the girl I do like,

755
01:10:58,456 --> 01:11:01,000
I can't stop her from talking
about babies, man,

756
01:11:01,167 --> 01:11:03,127
Well, give her your sperm, stud,

757
01:11:04,128 --> 01:11:05,505
Go on, Do it,

758
01:11:05,922 --> 01:11:08,174
- C'mon, chicken, Just give it to her,
- No, Hell no,

759
01:11:08,216 --> 01:11:09,217
Make babies,

760
01:11:09,258 --> 01:11:12,720
I know when I'm ready, and I
ain't ready for that yet, I know that,

761
01:11:13,012 --> 01:11:16,974
Well, well...
what do we have here?

762
01:11:18,518 --> 01:11:19,977
Uh, components,

763
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:23,564
They're bomb parts, Signatures,

764
01:11:23,606 --> 01:11:25,691
Yeah, I see that, but
what they doing under your bed?

765
01:11:28,569 --> 01:11:29,821
Well...

766
01:11:36,619 --> 01:11:37,662
Ah-ha,

767
01:11:37,745 --> 01:11:39,205
There we go, This one,

768
01:11:39,997 --> 01:11:43,709
This one is from the U, N, building,

769
01:11:43,751 --> 01:11:47,463
Flaming car,
Dead man's switch, Boom,

770
01:11:47,797 --> 01:11:49,298
This guy was good, I like him,

771
01:11:50,841 --> 01:11:52,718
- Relay,
- Ah... look at this one,

772
01:11:53,553 --> 01:11:57,807
This one, y'all, is from
our first call together,

773
01:11:59,225 --> 01:12:03,062
This box is full of stuff
that almost killed me,

774
01:12:03,771 --> 01:12:04,981
And what about this one?

775
01:12:05,231 --> 01:12:07,358
- Where's this one from, Will?
- It's my wedding ring,

776
01:12:08,234 --> 01:12:10,278
Like I said,
stuff that almost killed me,

777
01:12:11,779 --> 01:12:16,200
You know, I just think
it's really interested

778
01:12:16,325 --> 01:12:17,577
to hold something in your hand
that could have killed anyone,

779
01:12:18,578 --> 01:12:21,330
Damn that, It's all shit
from radio shack,

780
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:25,126
It's interesting,

781
01:12:25,876 --> 01:12:27,378
I think it's interesting too,

782
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:29,171
Well, I think you hit me harder than
I hit you

783
01:12:29,213 --> 01:12:32,341
therefore I owe you a punch,

784
01:12:32,383 --> 01:12:34,135
Now get your ass up, C'mon,

785
01:12:34,427 --> 01:12:37,346
C'mon, He's right,
Let's go, C'mon,

786
01:12:38,931 --> 01:12:39,974
Come on!

787
01:12:40,016 --> 01:12:41,809
All right, hold on, boys,
We need some rules,

788
01:12:42,059 --> 01:12:43,811
Sanborn, no face shots,

789
01:12:43,894 --> 01:12:44,854
Oh, there's gonna be a face shot,

790
01:12:44,979 --> 01:12:46,314
Sergeant James, take off your shirt,

791
01:12:47,231 --> 01:12:48,441
Yes, sir,

792
01:12:49,066 --> 01:12:50,109
What happened?

793
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:52,278
My momma dropped me
when I was a baby,

794
01:12:53,195 --> 01:12:54,363
Looks like frag scars,

795
01:12:54,405 --> 01:12:58,492
- Let it go, Eldridge, C'mon,
- All right,

796
01:12:58,826 --> 01:13:00,286
Nice and big,

797
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:06,500
Oohh!

798
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,468
You like that, huh?

799
01:13:15,509 --> 01:13:17,136
That's all you got?

800
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,888
Come on,

801
01:13:21,724 --> 01:13:23,309
Bring some, C'mon,

802
01:13:25,102 --> 01:13:26,312
Ooh!

803
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:32,818
Wooh, God damn,

804
01:13:33,277 --> 01:13:34,779
That's gotta hurt,

805
01:13:38,449 --> 01:13:39,950
- You all right, man?
- Oh, yeah,

806
01:13:41,952 --> 01:13:43,871
- Oh, he's all right,
- Get up, bitch,

807
01:13:46,123 --> 01:13:47,333
All right, bitch,

808
01:13:50,628 --> 01:13:52,379
- What do you got now?
- Get the fuck off me?

809
01:13:52,421 --> 01:13:54,090
- What do you got?
- Get off me, you mother fucker,

810
01:13:54,131 --> 01:13:55,966
What do you got? What do you got?

811
01:13:56,008 --> 01:13:59,095
Wooh, he's a wild one,
We got a wild one,

812
01:13:59,136 --> 01:14:01,180
C'mon, Sanborn,
Get him, That's right,

813
01:14:01,222 --> 01:14:04,934
- Ride him, baby,
- Get off me,

814
01:14:04,975 --> 01:14:06,644
- C'mon, bitch,
- C'mon, guys,

815
01:14:06,685 --> 01:14:08,437
What do you got?

816
01:14:08,729 --> 01:14:10,106
Get off me,

817
01:14:10,314 --> 01:14:11,482
Hey, hey, hey,

818
01:14:22,743 --> 01:14:24,745
I'm just kidding,
motherfucker, Shit,

819
01:14:26,997 --> 01:14:28,499
You're all right, Sanborn,

820
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:29,708
You're all right, Man,

821
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:31,961
Owen, get this guy a drink, C'mon,

822
01:14:33,796 --> 01:14:35,214
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him,

823
01:14:35,256 --> 01:14:36,632
- All right, here,
- All right,

824
01:14:36,674 --> 01:14:38,509
- See you later,
- Be safe, - All right,

825
01:14:38,551 --> 01:14:41,846
All right, come on big boy,
Damn, boy, you need to get on a diet,

826
01:14:42,263 --> 01:14:44,473
He hurt his knee, C'mon, man,

827
01:14:45,891 --> 01:14:48,894
Steps, C'mon,

828
01:14:50,563 --> 01:14:52,648
Step, Step,

829
01:14:57,862 --> 01:15:02,575
All right, lay down,
All right, Get some rest,

830
01:15:03,492 --> 01:15:08,205
Hey, James, you think I got
what it takes to put on the suit?

831
01:15:10,749 --> 01:15:11,875
Hell, no,

832
01:15:13,586 --> 01:15:15,045
Night, boy,

833
01:16:09,183 --> 01:16:09,933
Oh!

834
01:16:14,396 --> 01:16:16,148
- Good morning, Colonel,
- Good morning,

835
01:16:16,857 --> 01:16:21,153
Mind if I ride along? I'm sick to death
of sitting behind a desk all the time,

836
01:16:24,114 --> 01:16:26,158
That'd be a privilege,
Hop in, Colonel,

837
01:16:30,579 --> 01:16:31,705
Hey, Doc,

838
01:16:32,581 --> 01:16:34,249
Not to insult your intelligence, sir,

839
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:37,461
but if the shit hits the fan,
please don't fire out the Humvee,

840
01:16:37,628 --> 01:16:40,422
The round will just bounce around,
and someone might get shot,

841
01:16:41,048 --> 01:16:44,051
- I don't like getting shot,
- Understood, Sergeant,

842
01:16:57,022 --> 01:16:58,107
Oh, it's a pretty standard mission,

843
01:16:58,148 --> 01:17:00,234
We're just here to pick up
some unexploded ordinance,

844
01:17:00,859 --> 01:17:03,570
Sergeant James is
gonna see what the deal is,

845
01:17:04,154 --> 01:17:06,240
and then hopefully we'll be
gone in a couple minutes,

846
01:17:06,782 --> 01:17:08,617
- We've gotta gear up,
- For what?

847
01:17:08,659 --> 01:17:09,952
Security hasn't gone in,

848
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,620
Go in quiet,

849
01:17:11,662 --> 01:17:13,580
- Radios off, - Roger,
- Roger that,

850
01:17:14,248 --> 01:17:16,291
- Glad you came,
- See ya, All right,

851
01:20:09,297 --> 01:20:10,590
Psst, Psst,

852
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:21,977
Clear,

853
01:20:23,186 --> 01:20:24,020
Hey,

854
01:20:24,354 --> 01:20:26,064
cigarette's still smoking,

855
01:20:30,068 --> 01:20:31,278
It's all our shit,

856
01:20:34,906 --> 01:20:36,616
Mother fucking goldmine,

857
01:20:38,535 --> 01:20:39,995
Watch out for trips,

858
01:21:04,185 --> 01:21:05,312
I got something,

859
01:21:18,783 --> 01:21:20,076
I know this kid,

860
01:21:21,328 --> 01:21:23,455
His name's Beckham, He sells DVDs,

861
01:21:24,372 --> 01:21:26,249
You ever see a body bomb before, man?

862
01:21:29,002 --> 01:21:31,338
It's disgusting, Let's get outta here,

863
01:21:32,005 --> 01:21:32,923
Hold it,

864
01:21:34,424 --> 01:21:39,471
Eldridge, want you to grab all the C4 and
deck cord you can get your hands on,

865
01:21:42,599 --> 01:21:44,434
Let's get all this
ordinance outta here,

866
01:21:44,476 --> 01:21:46,519
And we're just gonna...
we're gonna blow the place,

867
01:21:47,771 --> 01:21:49,189
Roger, Just blow it,

868
01:21:58,031 --> 01:21:58,990
What are you doing?

869
01:22:00,533 --> 01:22:02,869
Yeah? Putting
the stones in to move,

870
01:22:04,454 --> 01:22:05,622
Yeah, That's really wonderful,

871
01:22:06,498 --> 01:22:07,999
but it's
a little bit unsafe today,

872
01:22:10,627 --> 01:22:12,087
Yeah, it's a little unsafe,

873
01:22:12,128 --> 01:22:13,546
So maybe... I don't know,

874
01:22:13,838 --> 01:22:17,092
I'm thinking maybe we should move?

875
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,176
No?

876
01:22:35,193 --> 01:22:36,277
Fuck,

877
01:22:41,282 --> 01:22:42,367
- You all right?
- Yeah,

878
01:22:42,409 --> 01:22:43,660
- You?
- Yeah,

879
01:22:49,749 --> 01:22:51,876
- You all right, man?
- Yeah,

880
01:22:53,086 --> 01:22:54,337
No one in or out, okay?

881
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,548
Cancel the det, Cancel the det,

882
01:24:00,778 --> 01:24:02,989
- What the fuck is he doing?
- I don't know, man,

883
01:24:05,241 --> 01:24:06,242
I don't know,

884
01:25:34,914 --> 01:25:35,957
I'm coming out,

885
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:38,251
Roger that,

886
01:25:58,813 --> 01:26:00,648
- Where are you from?
- New York,

887
01:26:00,982 --> 01:26:02,150
The Big Apple,

888
01:26:02,859 --> 01:26:04,235
Are you from Iraq?

889
01:26:04,444 --> 01:26:06,571
I love it here,
This is a beautiful place,

890
01:26:06,612 --> 01:26:08,990
But it's not too safe here, okay?

891
01:26:09,031 --> 01:26:12,702
So, I think we need -
we need to move, Please,

892
01:26:36,976 --> 01:26:38,478
You think it's that little Beckham?

893
01:26:38,769 --> 01:26:40,188
No, I don't,

894
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:43,065
- You're positive?
- Sure,

895
01:26:43,733 --> 01:26:46,027
Hey, I don't know, man,
They all look the same, right?

896
01:26:46,694 --> 01:26:47,612
I know,

897
01:26:47,653 --> 01:26:51,032
- Will seemed sure, That was weird,
- Very weird,

898
01:26:53,409 --> 01:26:55,870
Please, just move,

899
01:26:56,204 --> 01:26:58,581
Move, Move,

900
01:26:58,623 --> 01:27:03,211
Move on, Thank you,

901
01:27:06,631 --> 01:27:07,715
I'm sorry,

902
01:27:08,507 --> 01:27:09,884
Will's very weird,

903
01:27:10,426 --> 01:27:12,428
I mean he keeps bomb
parts under his bed,

904
01:27:12,637 --> 01:27:15,598
I'll bet you he won't keep any
of these parts under his bed,

905
01:27:17,725 --> 01:27:18,726
Bye-bye,

906
01:27:20,603 --> 01:27:22,980
Yeah, bye-bye, Bye, Thank you,

907
01:27:23,898 --> 01:27:25,024
Hey, Colonel,

908
01:27:25,858 --> 01:27:26,692
Let's go,

909
01:27:26,734 --> 01:27:29,153
Hallo, thank you,

910
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:37,787
IED!

911
01:27:39,413 --> 01:27:40,456
Cambridge!

912
01:27:45,378 --> 01:27:46,879
Get back, Get down,

913
01:27:46,921 --> 01:27:48,464
Stay back,

914
01:27:48,506 --> 01:27:50,508
Stay back, Sanborn, keep 'em back,

915
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,093
Is anyone hurt?

916
01:27:52,176 --> 01:27:54,804
Cambridge! Fuck!

917
01:27:55,596 --> 01:27:57,056
Cambridge!

918
01:27:58,057 --> 01:27:59,767
Cambridge, come out,
We gotta go,

919
01:27:59,809 --> 01:28:00,893
Oh, he's dead,

920
01:28:01,769 --> 01:28:04,313
Hey, we gotta find
Cambridge, Doc!

921
01:28:04,522 --> 01:28:07,024
- Eldridge!
- Doc!

922
01:28:07,984 --> 01:28:10,611
Eldridge, c'mon, man, C'mon

923
01:28:10,653 --> 01:28:12,697
I just saw him,
He was walking right here,

924
01:28:12,738 --> 01:28:15,992
I know, He's dead,
Look, he's dead, Okay?

925
01:28:30,006 --> 01:28:31,298
It's all right, man,

926
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:33,384
It'll be all right, man,

927
01:28:57,074 --> 01:28:58,033
Hello?

928
01:29:00,244 --> 01:29:01,328
Hello?

929
01:29:02,246 --> 01:29:03,414
Wi/?

930
01:29:05,583 --> 01:29:06,542
Hello?

931
01:29:09,795 --> 01:29:11,297
He/o?

932
01:30:03,015 --> 01:30:04,350
Hey, let me ask you a question,

933
01:30:04,642 --> 01:30:07,353
What happened to the little kid
that used to work here?

934
01:30:07,394 --> 01:30:10,940
Sorry, man,
English I... no English,

935
01:30:10,981 --> 01:30:14,276
No-no English,
You no speak English now,

936
01:30:14,318 --> 01:30:17,530
Little kid, Beckham is his name,
He sells... sells DVDs,

937
01:30:17,571 --> 01:30:20,324
DVD, One DVD, $5,

938
01:30:20,407 --> 01:30:21,742
Oh, Jesus Christ,

939
01:30:22,034 --> 01:30:23,577
- $5,
- Excuse me, soldier,

940
01:30:23,869 --> 01:30:25,037
you in charge of this area here?

941
01:30:25,162 --> 01:30:27,039
- What's up?
- You know this guy?

942
01:30:28,123 --> 01:30:30,334
How do we know
that he's not giving intel

943
01:30:30,501 --> 01:30:31,961
to insurgents, telling them
where to drop mortars?

944
01:30:32,169 --> 01:30:33,587
I think he's just selling DVDs,

945
01:30:33,671 --> 01:30:35,256
Well, he's a security risk,
We should get rid of him,

946
01:30:36,131 --> 01:30:37,258
What are you looking at?

947
01:30:37,299 --> 01:30:40,719
- He's just selling DVDs, man,
All the merchants are clear, - By who?

948
01:30:40,761 --> 01:30:42,972
I couldn't do anything with him
until I got the clear from my CO,

949
01:30:45,849 --> 01:30:46,892
Okay, Fuck,

950
01:30:48,477 --> 01:30:50,020
Fuck,

951
01:31:26,056 --> 01:31:27,433
Does this change anything?

952
01:31:28,684 --> 01:31:29,893
You speak
English now, Don't you?

953
01:31:30,936 --> 01:31:32,604
- Yalla, yalla, Drive,
- Okay,

954
01:31:54,501 --> 01:31:56,336
- Ok,
- Is this his house?

955
01:31:56,795 --> 01:31:58,088
He there?

956
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:07,806
Wait here,

957
01:32:17,816 --> 01:32:18,817
Fuck,

958
01:33:17,834 --> 01:33:19,586
Psst, Psst, Shh,

959
01:33:20,754 --> 01:33:21,922
You speak English?

960
01:33:22,172 --> 01:33:23,966
English, French, Arabic,

961
01:33:24,007 --> 01:33:25,133
Good, Open you vest,

962
01:33:26,552 --> 01:33:28,387
Ah, stay there, Stay,

963
01:33:29,137 --> 01:33:30,597
Tell me what you know about Beckham,

964
01:33:31,098 --> 01:33:32,057
For whom?

965
01:33:32,266 --> 01:33:35,519
Beckham, 12-year-old boy, body bomb,
Stay right there,

966
01:33:36,228 --> 01:33:38,313
- I don't know,
- You don't know,

967
01:33:38,355 --> 01:33:41,608
But please, sit down,
I am Professor Navid,

968
01:33:41,984 --> 01:33:43,277
This is my home,

969
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:46,947
You are a guest,
Please, sit down,

970
01:33:49,533 --> 01:33:50,993
I'm a guest,

971
01:33:53,245 --> 01:33:57,416
Just... I'm looking for
the people responsible

972
01:33:58,834 --> 01:34:00,585
for-for-for Beckham,

973
01:34:01,169 --> 01:34:03,422
You are CIA, no?

974
01:34:04,715 --> 01:34:07,050
I am very pleased to see
CIA in my home,

975
01:34:07,759 --> 01:34:09,511
Please, sit,

976
01:34:16,977 --> 01:34:18,312
How can I...

977
01:34:22,899 --> 01:34:24,401
Be careful, The gun can go off,

978
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:23,376
U, S, A, friendly coming in,

979
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:26,296
Stop, Stop, Get the fuck down,

980
01:35:26,338 --> 01:35:27,756
U, S, A, friendly,

981
01:35:27,798 --> 01:35:30,300
On your knees,
Get on your knees now,

982
01:35:30,342 --> 01:35:34,471
On your knees,
You will be shot, Don; t move,

983
01:35:34,513 --> 01:35:36,223
On your knees, Down now,

984
01:35:36,264 --> 01:35:39,851
- Open your jacket!
- Opening my jacket,

985
01:35:39,893 --> 01:35:41,728
Cover, Get him down,

986
01:35:41,895 --> 01:35:43,188
- On the ground,
- I have a weapon,

987
01:35:43,313 --> 01:35:44,981
Don't fucking move,

988
01:35:45,398 --> 01:35:47,108
- Tower, hold cover, Searching,
- I have a weapon,

989
01:35:48,985 --> 01:35:50,487
- Gun,
- Like I said,

990
01:35:51,863 --> 01:35:53,114
Weapons clear,

991
01:35:53,448 --> 01:35:54,407
ID,

992
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,493
What the fuck are you doing?

993
01:35:56,743 --> 01:35:58,119
I was at a whorehouse,

994
01:35:58,954 --> 01:36:03,834
All right, If I let you in, will
you tell me where it is exactly?

995
01:36:05,877 --> 01:36:06,586
Yeah,

996
01:36:08,922 --> 01:36:10,966
James, do you copy?

997
01:36:20,517 --> 01:36:22,143
James do you have your ears on?

998
01:36:25,981 --> 01:36:26,815
James?

999
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:30,277
This is James, What's up?

1000
01:36:46,084 --> 01:36:48,211
- Hey,
- What's up, man?

1001
01:36:51,214 --> 01:36:53,466
Look, we have a tank explosion
in the Green Zone,

1002
01:36:53,508 --> 01:36:55,176
We have to post-blast assessment,

1003
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:56,636
see if it was a suicide bomber,

1004
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,263
and if so, how the fuck did he do it?

1005
01:36:59,347 --> 01:37:00,098
Okay,

1006
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:02,142
Where'd you say you were again?

1007
01:37:02,767 --> 01:37:03,977
I didn't, sergeant,
Let's go,

1008
01:37:06,604 --> 01:37:08,148
What happened to your head, James?

1009
01:37:15,739 --> 01:37:16,823
Hey, you ready?

1010
01:37:17,657 --> 01:37:18,908
Game face, buddy, Let's go,

1011
01:37:24,748 --> 01:37:26,708
- You ready?
- Let's do this,

1012
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:28,668
Rock and roll, Moving out,

1013
01:37:42,349 --> 01:37:44,267
U, S, A, friendlies coming through,

1014
01:38:04,996 --> 01:38:06,539
Make room, guys, Make room,

1015
01:38:19,177 --> 01:38:21,137
Hey, Sanborn,

1016
01:38:21,971 --> 01:38:22,931
Oh, shit!

1017
01:38:49,666 --> 01:38:51,125
- An oil tanker?
- Yep,

1018
01:38:54,712 --> 01:38:56,130
That's a pretty long flight, huh?

1019
01:41:03,925 --> 01:41:05,802
This is the edge of the blast radius,

1020
01:41:11,891 --> 01:41:13,267
Jesus,

1021
01:41:14,435 --> 01:41:15,728
So, where's our triggerman?

1022
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:17,647
Burnt up in the flames, man,

1023
01:41:18,189 --> 01:41:19,649
Suicide bomber,

1024
01:41:20,149 --> 01:41:22,318
We're never going
to find a body in that shit,

1025
01:41:22,527 --> 01:41:23,945
What if there was no body?

1026
01:41:25,738 --> 01:41:27,156
What if it was a remote det?

1027
01:41:31,994 --> 01:41:34,413
A really good bad guy
hides out in the dark, right?

1028
01:41:37,583 --> 01:41:41,295
Right here,
Perfect vantage point,

1029
01:41:41,879 --> 01:41:46,008
outside the blast radius to sit back
and watch us clean up their mess,

1030
01:41:48,803 --> 01:41:50,555
- Want to go out there?
- Yes, I do,

1031
01:41:53,099 --> 01:41:57,103
- I could stand to get in a little
trouble, - No, man, This is bullshit,

1032
01:41:57,395 --> 01:42:01,941
You got three infantry platoons behind
you whose job it is to go Haji huntin',

1033
01:42:01,983 --> 01:42:03,151
That ain't our fuckin' job,

1034
01:42:03,192 --> 01:42:05,987
You don; t say no to me, Sanborn,
I say no to you,

1035
01:42:06,028 --> 01:42:08,155
You know there are guys
watching us right now,

1036
01:42:08,197 --> 01:42:11,492
They're laughing at this,
Okay, I'm not okay with that,

1037
01:42:12,410 --> 01:42:15,162
Now, turn off your goddammed
torch 'cause we're going,

1038
01:43:24,649 --> 01:43:26,484
Now we know where their
oil tanker came from,

1039
01:43:26,525 --> 01:43:28,152
No shit, Same kind,

1040
01:43:28,194 --> 01:43:29,820
- We're close,
- Yeah,

1041
01:43:30,112 --> 01:43:31,947
They alleyways
are probably set up on a grid,

1042
01:43:31,989 --> 01:43:34,367
We're going to need
to split up, flush 'em out,

1043
01:43:35,159 --> 01:43:37,620
Sanborn, you take on,
Eldridge, take two,

1044
01:43:37,662 --> 01:43:40,665
I got three,
Rally point at your intersection,

1045
01:43:40,706 --> 01:43:42,041
- Ready, move,
- Wait, rally point when?

1046
01:43:43,292 --> 01:43:44,043
Fuck,

1047
01:44:10,778 --> 01:44:12,154
"Ipsura, ipsura,"
Go, go!

1048
01:44:57,908 --> 01:44:59,785
Shit, Ahh,

1049
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:07,209
Shit,

1050
01:45:07,251 --> 01:45:09,503
- You got contact?
- Who was it? What's going on?

1051
01:45:09,545 --> 01:45:11,338
- What do you got?
- It's Eldridge,

1052
01:45:12,882 --> 01:45:13,966
Go, go,

1053
01:45:14,008 --> 01:45:15,467
Man down, Man down,

1054
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,179
Shit, Shit, Shit,

1055
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:21,265
- Negative, negative, It's not him,
- He's gone,

1056
01:45:21,724 --> 01:45:22,975
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?

1057
01:45:23,017 --> 01:45:24,935
Tankers and troops are that way,

1058
01:45:25,227 --> 01:45:26,729
- Let's go this way,
- Fuck,

1059
01:45:49,668 --> 01:45:51,879
Use your torch, On torch,

1060
01:45:54,048 --> 01:45:55,007
Ready?

1061
01:45:55,758 --> 01:45:58,135
One, two, three, Fuck,

1062
01:46:00,471 --> 01:46:01,680
- Fuck!
- Shit,

1063
01:46:07,478 --> 01:46:09,146
Softly, softly, softly,

1064
01:46:20,491 --> 01:46:21,367
On three,

1065
01:46:21,742 --> 01:46:23,577
One, Two, Three,

1066
01:46:27,873 --> 01:46:29,625
Now, Go, go, go,

1067
01:46:32,294 --> 01:46:35,255
- Eldridge, you okay?
- Fuck, dude, I'm hit,

1068
01:46:35,297 --> 01:46:37,174
Hit him in the fuckin' leg,

1069
01:46:37,216 --> 01:46:39,176
Come on,

1070
01:46:39,218 --> 01:46:42,680
- Am I dead? Am I dead?
- No, You're fine, man,

1071
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:44,932
Am I dead? Am I dead?

1072
01:46:46,558 --> 01:46:48,394
I'm going to put some
pressure down, Come on,

1073
01:46:48,811 --> 01:46:49,937
You're all right,

1074
01:46:51,105 --> 01:46:53,315
Look at me, look at me,
You all right,

1075
01:46:53,649 --> 01:46:57,903
All right, buddy, You ready to get up?
On three, ready? One, two, three,

1076
01:48:20,569 --> 01:48:23,780
Hey, what's up, man? What's up, man?

1077
01:48:23,989 --> 01:48:25,949
Wanna buy some DVDs?
Wanna play some soccer?

1078
01:48:27,492 --> 01:48:28,410
What's up?

1079
01:48:29,203 --> 01:48:30,454
Come on, man,
Wanna play some...

1080
01:48:48,138 --> 01:48:50,098
Aww, Fuck,

1081
01:48:55,562 --> 01:48:56,521
How you doing, buddy?

1082
01:48:57,230 --> 01:48:58,815
Doc says you're going to be okay,

1083
01:48:59,149 --> 01:49:01,652
My fucking femur is shattered
in nine places,

1084
01:49:02,861 --> 01:49:05,906
He said I'll be walking in six months
if I'm fucking lucky,

1085
01:49:05,948 --> 01:49:08,283
- Six months ain't bad, huh?
- It's not bad?

1086
01:49:08,617 --> 01:49:10,410
Fuckin' sucks, man,

1087
01:49:10,452 --> 01:49:12,204
- Ah, ah!
- Take it easy,

1088
01:49:14,289 --> 01:49:17,084
You see that? You fuckin' see that?

1089
01:49:17,834 --> 01:49:20,671
That's what happens when
you shoot someone, you motherfucker,

1090
01:49:21,213 --> 01:49:22,422
Sorry,

1091
01:49:23,006 --> 01:49:25,092
- Sorry, Owen,
- Fuck you, Will,

1092
01:49:25,509 --> 01:49:26,843
Really, Fuck you,

1093
01:49:27,886 --> 01:49:31,682
Thanks for saving my life,
but we didn; t have to go out

1094
01:49:31,807 --> 01:49:34,643
looking for trouble to get
your fucking adrenaline fix, you fuck,

1095
01:49:36,728 --> 01:49:38,522
Hey, take care of yourself, Owen,

1096
01:49:38,563 --> 01:49:40,023
Come home safe, man,

1097
01:49:40,190 --> 01:49:42,150
- See you on the other side, man,
- All right,

1098
01:49:43,318 --> 01:49:45,278
Let's get out of this fucking desert!

1099
01:49:51,451 --> 01:49:52,494
Don't move,

1100
01:49:52,536 --> 01:49:55,622
If you keep
walking we will shoot you,

1101
01:49:55,664 --> 01:49:57,374
Move him back,

1102
01:49:58,375 --> 01:49:59,918
Keep that translator back,

1103
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:01,962
- But the bomb was forced on him,
- Get him back!

1104
01:50:02,003 --> 01:50:04,047
Don't move! Stay still,

1105
01:50:06,091 --> 01:50:10,220
If you keep walking
we will shoot you, If

1106
01:50:10,345 --> 01:50:11,888
Get that translator back, now,

1107
01:50:15,851 --> 01:50:19,855
Give him room, Give him room,

1108
01:50:27,237 --> 01:50:28,822
Hey, what do you got?

1109
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:30,365
He came walking up to our checkpoint,

1110
01:50:30,407 --> 01:50:33,201
said he had a bomb strapped to him,
But he's sorry, doesn't want it to go off,

1111
01:50:33,243 --> 01:50:35,203
Then he starts begging us
to take it off of him,

1112
01:50:35,537 --> 01:50:37,122
Help this man,
He's not a bad man,

1113
01:50:37,164 --> 01:50:39,791
He's not a bad man? He got
a bomb strapped to him,

1114
01:50:40,667 --> 01:50:42,627
This is a joke, He's trying
to pull us closer,

1115
01:50:42,669 --> 01:50:43,920
Yeah, I got it, I got it,

1116
01:50:44,212 --> 01:50:48,383
All right, Look...
Tell him to open his shirt slowly

1117
01:50:48,884 --> 01:50:50,969
and see what's inside,

1118
01:50:54,347 --> 01:50:56,516
Slowly, Slowly,

1119
01:51:07,277 --> 01:51:08,653
Jesus,

1120
01:51:09,988 --> 01:51:12,324
All right, Sergeant,
I need a 75-meter perimeter,

1121
01:51:12,365 --> 01:51:14,576
- Get these guys back,
- You heard what he said, Get back,

1122
01:51:16,328 --> 01:51:18,997
You tell him to get on his knees
and touch the sky, okay?

1123
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:21,041
Slowly,

1124
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:22,792
Get down,

1125
01:51:27,297 --> 01:51:29,049
Okay, I need your radio,

1126
01:51:29,424 --> 01:51:31,384
- Can't we just shoot him?
- No,

1127
01:51:31,426 --> 01:51:33,428
He's a a family man,
He's not a bad man,

1128
01:51:33,470 --> 01:51:35,263
He's asking for help, only help,

1129
01:51:35,305 --> 01:51:39,809
Yeah, all right, You don; t want
to die, get back! I got it,

1130
01:51:43,313 --> 01:51:45,941
Listen, I know
we've had our differences,

1131
01:51:46,149 --> 01:51:50,237
It happened, all right,
It's water under the bridge,

1132
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:53,657
This is suicide, man,

1133
01:51:55,242 --> 01:51:56,993
That's why they call it
a suicide bomb, right?

1134
01:52:01,081 --> 01:52:02,207
Let's do this, Come on,

1135
01:52:02,249 --> 01:52:04,334
He says the bomb may
have a timer, please hurry,

1136
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:07,212
- We're good, Ready?
- Yep,

1137
01:52:12,926 --> 01:52:13,760
Go get 'em,

1138
01:52:13,969 --> 01:52:16,805
- Keep your eyes out on these,
- Yeah,

1139
01:52:27,565 --> 01:52:29,526
Get your hands up,

1140
01:52:32,696 --> 01:52:33,989
He says he has a family,

1141
01:52:35,573 --> 01:52:36,700
Please help him,

1142
01:52:42,789 --> 01:52:44,749
Now, listen,

1143
01:52:44,791 --> 01:52:47,877
Look, It'd be a lot easier for me
to disarm this

1144
01:52:47,919 --> 01:52:49,713
if I just shoot you, Do you understand?

1145
01:52:54,384 --> 01:52:55,635
What's he saying?

1146
01:52:55,677 --> 01:52:59,556
He says I don; t wish to die, I have a
family... Please take this off me,

1147
01:53:00,432 --> 01:53:04,853
Tell him to put his hands behind his
head or I'll be very happy to shoot him,

1148
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:12,360
Look, that's not what I said,

1149
01:53:12,402 --> 01:53:15,822
Tell him to put his hands behind
his head or I will shoot him,

1150
01:53:18,700 --> 01:53:19,576
Listen,

1151
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:23,079
Listen, listen,

1152
01:53:24,539 --> 01:53:28,209
You understand?

1153
01:53:30,587 --> 01:53:31,379
Okay,

1154
01:53:35,049 --> 01:53:36,092
What do you got here?

1155
01:53:37,761 --> 01:53:39,137
He has four children,

1156
01:53:44,517 --> 01:53:45,643
Shit,

1157
01:53:50,398 --> 01:53:53,860
Sanborn, we got a timer,
and we got a lot of wires, man,

1158
01:53:53,902 --> 01:53:55,987
I'm going to need
a little help on this,

1159
01:53:56,029 --> 01:53:57,530
Roger that, Tell me what you need,

1160
01:53:58,072 --> 01:53:59,282
Bolt cutters,

1161
01:53:59,407 --> 01:54:01,910
You gotta get down here
in two minutes or we're all fucked,

1162
01:54:01,951 --> 01:54:03,453
Roger that,
I'll be there in 30 seconds,

1163
01:54:07,499 --> 01:54:09,584
He says, please, I have a family,

1164
01:54:12,378 --> 01:54:13,213
Sst,

1165
01:54:13,254 --> 01:54:17,342
I know, It's okay,
You're all right, You're all right,

1166
01:54:21,804 --> 01:54:23,014
Please, don't leave me,

1167
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:29,896
You weren't fuckin' kidding,

1168
01:54:30,355 --> 01:54:32,857
Nope, What's this made out of?

1169
01:54:38,696 --> 01:54:39,656
Oh, man,

1170
01:54:39,781 --> 01:54:41,533
That's case iron steel,

1171
01:54:43,201 --> 01:54:44,452
Shit,

1172
01:54:44,494 --> 01:54:46,788
- What's our time?
- We got two minutes, - Shit,

1173
01:54:47,163 --> 01:54:49,624
We're going need a torch
to get this off,

1174
01:54:49,666 --> 01:54:51,668
Well, we don; t have one of those in
the fucking truck, man,

1175
01:54:51,709 --> 01:54:52,410
He's dead, man,

1176
01:54:52,418 --> 01:54:53,711
Hold on, man, Let me think,
Just let me think,

1177
01:54:54,003 --> 01:54:56,422
We're going to handle this,
It's okay, We got this,

1178
01:54:57,173 --> 01:54:58,758
Shh, okay,

1179
01:54:59,842 --> 01:55:01,094
Now listen, you're gonna get back,

1180
01:55:05,682 --> 01:55:08,101
It's just we don; t
got enough time, Sanborn,

1181
01:55:08,351 --> 01:55:10,645
I just gotta...
I gotta get these bolts off,

1182
01:55:11,437 --> 01:55:14,691
No, We got a minute and a half, man,
We gotta get out of here,

1183
01:55:14,732 --> 01:55:17,527
- I'll handle this, Just go,

01:55:17,568 --> 01:55:19,404
Look, I'm right behind ya, Just go,

01:55:19,445 --> 01:55:21,155
Fuck him! Come on, Let's go,

01:55:21,197 --> 01:55:23,992
- Sanborn, I got the suit, Just go,

1187
01:55:24,033 --> 01:55:27,870
Sanborn, you have 405 seconds,
You have 45 seconds, Sanborn, leave,

1188
01:55:28,204 --> 01:55:29,872
You're fucking dead, man, Dead,

1189
01:55:29,914 --> 01:55:31,958
Go!

01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,502
- Everybody get back!
- Go, go!

1191
01:55:40,049 --> 01:55:41,259
We got one,

1192
01:55:42,176 --> 01:55:44,470
Go, get back,

1193
01:55:47,181 --> 01:55:52,103
I can't, There's too many locks,
There's too many, I can't do it,

1194
01:55:52,603 --> 01:55:54,397
I can't get it off, I'm sorry, Okay,

1195
01:55:54,689 --> 01:55:56,065
You understand? I'm sorry,

1196
01:55:57,066 --> 01:55:59,819
I'm sorry, You hear me? I'm sorry,

1197
01:55:59,861 --> 01:56:02,030
- Get down now!
- I can help him,

1198
01:56:04,866 --> 01:56:08,077
Get out of here, Go,

1199
01:56:31,184 --> 01:56:32,059
James!

1200
01:56:32,393 --> 01:56:34,479
Everybody up and out,
James!

1201
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:22,151
You all right?

1202
01:57:25,696 --> 01:57:26,614
Aw, man,

1203
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:31,369
I fuckin' hate this place,

1204
01:57:34,288 --> 01:57:35,540
Here, man, Have a hit,

1205
01:57:50,012 --> 01:57:52,014
I'm not ready to die, James,

1206
01:57:54,433 --> 01:57:56,060
Well, you're not going
to die out here, bro,

1207
01:57:57,728 --> 01:57:59,313
Another two inches,

1208
01:58:02,316 --> 01:58:04,986
Shrapnel zings by, slices my throat,

1209
01:58:06,654 --> 01:58:09,115
I bleed out like a pig in the sand,

1210
01:58:11,701 --> 01:58:13,494
Nobody'll give a shit,

1211
01:58:16,414 --> 01:58:19,709
I mean, my parents'll care,
but they don; t count, man, Who else?

1212
01:58:27,508 --> 01:58:29,051
I don; t even have a son,

1213
01:58:35,975 --> 01:58:38,269
Well, you're going to have
plenty of time for that, amigo,

1214
01:58:38,978 --> 01:58:40,855
- Naw, man,
- You know?

1215
01:58:42,857 --> 01:58:43,941
I'm done,

1216
01:58:49,488 --> 01:58:50,781
I want a son,

1217
01:58:54,910 --> 01:58:56,704
I want a little boy, Will,

1218
01:59:03,669 --> 01:59:05,880
I mean, how do you
do it, you know?

1219
01:59:07,715 --> 01:59:09,091
Take the risk?

1220
01:59:16,932 --> 01:59:19,101
I don't know, I just...

1221
01:59:21,854 --> 01:59:23,022
I guess I don; t think about it,

1222
01:59:36,786 --> 01:59:39,080
But you realize every time you suit up,

1223
01:59:40,456 --> 01:59:41,916
every time we go out

1224
01:59:43,084 --> 01:59:45,544
it's life or death,
You roll the dice

1225
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:49,048
and you deal with it,

1226
01:59:51,592 --> 01:59:53,177
You recognize that, don; t you?

1227
01:59:58,974 --> 02:00:00,059
Yeah,

1228
02:00:10,277 --> 02:00:11,529
Yeah, I do,

1229
02:00:13,405 --> 02:00:14,865
But I don't know why,

1230
02:00:17,034 --> 02:00:18,160
Yeah,

1231
02:00:27,837 --> 02:00:32,132
I don't know, JT,
You know why I am the way I am?

1232
02:00:37,930 --> 02:00:39,014
Naw, I don't,

1233
02:01:41,452 --> 02:01:45,039
- Wow, You did some shopping,
- Yeah,

1234
02:01:45,789 --> 02:01:47,499
I got some soda,
We done?

1235
02:01:49,209 --> 02:01:51,462
You want to go get us some cereal
and I'll meet you at the checkout?

1236
02:01:52,755 --> 02:01:54,548
Okay, Cereal,

1237
02:01:59,011 --> 02:01:59,928
Where?

1238
02:02:59,613 --> 02:03:03,075
Some guy drove his truck to
the middle of an Iraqi market,

1239
02:03:03,909 --> 02:03:05,911
starts passing out free candies,

1240
02:03:05,953 --> 02:03:08,455
All the kids coming running up,
the families stuff,

1241
02:03:10,666 --> 02:03:11,792
He detonates,

1242
02:03:14,586 --> 02:03:15,963
They're saying 59 are dead,

1243
02:03:26,515 --> 02:03:28,225
You know they need more bomb techs,

1244
02:03:32,396 --> 02:03:33,689
You want to chop those up for me?

1245
02:03:35,566 --> 02:03:37,317
Boing, boing, boing,

1246
02:03:45,158 --> 02:03:45,951
Yeah,

1247
02:03:48,245 --> 02:03:49,955
You love playing with that,

1248
02:03:50,956 --> 02:03:53,166
You love playing with all
your stuffed animals,

1249
02:03:54,293 --> 02:03:59,882
You love your mommy, your daddy,
your nature pajamas,

1250
02:04:00,090 --> 02:04:02,885
You love everything, don't you? Yeah,

1251
02:04:04,511 --> 02:04:05,804
You know what, buddy?

1252
02:04:06,888 --> 02:04:08,181
Once you get older,

1253
02:04:09,099 --> 02:04:14,438
some of the things that you love
might not seem so special anymore,

1254
02:04:15,272 --> 02:04:17,024
Like your Jack in the Box,

1255
02:04:20,110 --> 02:04:24,906
Maybe you realize it's just
a piece of tin and a stuffed animal

1256
02:04:27,159 --> 02:04:31,288
and then you forget
the few things you really love,

1257
02:04:34,625 --> 02:04:38,170
And by the time you get to my age
maybe it's only one or two things,

1258
02:04:46,762 --> 02:04:48,639
With me I think it's one,

1259
02:05:25,384 --> 02:05:27,677
- Welcome to Delta Company,
- Sergeant,
