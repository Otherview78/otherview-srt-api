3
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,600
- Mr. Mills, how are you?
- I'm fine.

4
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,720
- How are you?
- Fine.

5
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,720
- I suppose you wanna see it again?
- If you don't mind.

6
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,960
- You know where it is.
- Oh, yeah.

7
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,440
If I charged you a dollar every time
you came to examine the machine...

8
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,479
...you'd probably own it.
It's the one all the pros use.

9
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,080
Mariah Carey. Beyoncé. Gwen Stefani.

10
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,400
Really? Who's Beyoncé?

11
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,240
Just kidding. I'll take it.

12
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,200
Excuse me, sir.
The adult party's in the front.

13
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,840
- I'm Kim's father.
- Excuse me, I work for her father.

14
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,960
- Her real father.
- It's okay, Cyril. I got it.

15
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,440
- Hello, Bryan.
- Lenore.

16
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,720
I just wanted to give Kim her present.

17
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,800
We're letting the kids
have their space.

18
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,800
- Put it with the others.
- I wanna give it to her myself.

19
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,040
- Still having trouble following the rules.
- Oh, come on, Lennie.

20
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,120
- I've asked you not to call me that.
- Excuse me. Lenore.

21
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,880
- Dad!
- Oh, my darling.

22
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,600
- Hi.
- Hello, my sweet.

23
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,960
- Happy birthday.
- I was telling your father...

24
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,600
...how we arranged the presents.
- Here.

25
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,440
It's bad manners to open the one...

26
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,760
...and not the others.
- Go on. Open it.

27
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,840
- Cool.
- A karaoke machine?

28
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,200
- Well, I figured she wants to be a singer.
- When she was 12, Bryan.

29
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,720
- We've moved on.
- Thank you, Daddy.

30
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,440
My pleasure.

31
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,560
- I still wanna be a singer. Don't tell Mom.
- You got it.

32
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,400
Here. One for the book.

33
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,560
- We have a professional photographer.
- Big smile, sweetie.

34
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,080
That's my girl.

35
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,320
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

36
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,200
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

37
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,880
Oh, my... Stuart!

38
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,240
Stuart, I love you! I love you!
I love you!

39
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,400
Happy birthday, sweetie.

40
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,120
- Oh, Stuart, you're impossible.
- I know.

41
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
- Hey, Bryan.
- Stuart.

42
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,560
- She's not a little girl anymore, huh?
- I guess not.

43
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,800
- Will you join us for lunch?
- No, thanks.

44
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,120
I just wanted to be here
to wish her a happy birthday.

45
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,200
- Good to see you, Bryan.
- You too.

46
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,440
Thanks.

47
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,720
- Hey.
- Hey.

48
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,440
You forgot.

49
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,000
Come on in.

50
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,320
It's not like I didn't call to remind you.
Third Saturday in May?

51
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,880
- Red meat, red wine? Sound familiar?
- He probably had a lot on his mind.

52
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, the busy life of a retiree.
Every day a new adventure.

53
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,040
What does a retiree do, anyway?
Take naps? Play golf?

54
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,040
- Hit on rich widows?
- That takes care of the morning.

55
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,600
Yeah, well, come on, guys.
You know why I'm here.

56
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,240
Yeah, how's that going?

57
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,200
Okay. We had her birthday today.

58
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,120
Can you believe my Kimmy's 17?

59
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,920
Seventeen?

60
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,480
- To Kim.
- Lennie still got a hard-on for you?

61
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
She's not Lennie anymore.
She's Lenore.

62
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,880
Oh, she's still got a hard-on.

63
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,320
- And the husband?
- The same. Perfect.

64
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,000
- Dig deep enough, there's always shit.
- We can dig if you want us to dig.

65
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,360
What, you think he hasn't
done it already?

66
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,640
Thank you, Bernie.

67
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,640
- How's Kimmy?
- Good. She's good.

68
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,800
Yeah? She sleep over yet?

69
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,680
Well, let's say we're working on it.

70
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,000
She appreciate the fact
that you've given up your life...

71
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,760
...in order to be closer to her?

72
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,880
What a life, huh?

73
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,560
Hey, remember Beirut
after the chief disappeared?

74
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,080
Bry was in deep with that
crazy sheik from Hezbollah?

75
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,560
The guy said he'd get us inside
then disappeared.

76
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,520
We're scrambling to get the hell out...

77
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,840
...before we get taken down
and where are you?

78
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,920
I promised never to miss her birthday.

79
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,040
Yeah, that went down well
at Langley...

80
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
...when they found out
you flew the coop...

81
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,000
...to attend your child's birthday
9000 miles away.

82
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,960
Where did you say
your next posting was?

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,800
The Arctic Circle spying on penguins,
I believe it was.

84
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,520
No, penguins live in Antarctica.

85
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,040
Actually, it was Alaska.
What's your point, Sam?

86
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,760
My point is we have an open space.
Say the word, it's yours.

87
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,360
Who likes theirs rare?

88
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
- Guys.
- See you, Bryan.

89
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,080
- Good night, guys.
- See you, Bry.

90
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,280
Hey, look, look, look.
All kidding aside...

91
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,480
...it's a great thing trying to make up
for lost time with Kimmy.

92
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,360
But tomorrow's job? Right here.

93
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,120
Four hours' work, 2500 bucks...

94
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,200
...just for taking some pop diva
to and from her concert.

95
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,760
- We're one short.
- A singer?

96
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,800
I don't know if you'd call her a singer.
More like a cash cow.

97
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,800
Twenty million records sold already
and she's not even 25.

98
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,160
Job's a piece of cake.

99
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,400
We get her there and back.
Inside, they've got their own people.

100
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,120
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay?

101
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,800
- Yeah.
- Like that's it?

102
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,080
Yeah.

103
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,200
- It'll be perfect. Just like old times.
- Better. No one gets killed.

104
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,320
- Tomorrow. Good night, guys.
- See you.

105
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,040
- Get in the back, Wendy.
- I always get in the back.

106
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,440
Ma'am, if you don't mind,
I suggest you keep moving.

107
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,920
My mother is ma'am,
if you don't mind.

108
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,000
- Come on, it's time now. Let's go.
- Okay.

109
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,760
Bernie, Casey, you're out here.
Bry, you're in the room.

110
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,760
Okay.

111
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,120
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

112
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,360
Thank you for coming.

113
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,760
Wow, it was beautiful.

114
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,480
Thanks. What did you say
your name was again?

115
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,120
Mills. Bryan Mills.

116
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,200
- Nice to meet you, Bryan Mills.
- You too.

117
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,800
- You're on. Come on, let's go now.
- Okay, guys.

118
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,920
Excuse me, miss.

119
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,720
I've a daughter who wants to be a singer
and was wondering if you had any tips.

120
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,040
Yeah, I do.

121
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,640
Tell her to pick another career.

122
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,240
I got one.
We're waiting on an air strike...

123
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,200
and we're waiting
and then my satellite phone rings.

124
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,320
- Who is it?
- Hello?

125
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,200
- The guy we're to terminate.
- Honey.

126
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,640
- He'd like to know if we want some tea.
- Sorry, guys, it's Kim.

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,680
The noise?

128
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm at a concert.

129
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,920
You know this song? Yeah?

130
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,160
Yep, that's her.
No, no, no, I'm not attending.

131
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,680
I'm... I'm not attending.

132
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,400
I'm helping some friends out
with security.

133
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,480
Well, of course I met her.

134
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,280
Who do you think's guarding her?

135
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,560
I'm glad you're impressed.

136
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,360
Hey, I'm happy you called.

137
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,120
I'm happy you called. What?

138
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,800
Lunch? Tomorrow?

139
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,160
Sure, sure. I know the place.

140
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,800
Twelve-thirty it is.

141
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,840
I'll see you then.

142
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,800
- Here he is. And?
- What happened?

143
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,680
- She wants to have lunch.
- Okay.

144
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,000
- Just the two of us.
- All right. Fantastic.

145
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,160
See? There's progress. That's great.

146
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,080
Who left that gate open?
Bry, get her out of here. Take the lead.

147
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,600
- Move!
- Go, go!

148
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,880
More security here now!

149
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
That's it. Move.

150
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,080
Casey!

151
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,360
Bernie, stand by, stand by.

152
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,880
- Go, go, go.
- Watch your head.

153
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,840
Here, take this. The sugar will
take the edge off the shock.

154
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,480
Come on, come on, drink some more.

155
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,040
It's okay. It's okay. You're safe.

156
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,200
You're safe now.

157
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,360
Bernie.

158
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,800
Casey. Rambo.

159
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,880
Seriously, Bry,
you should think about coming with us.

160
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,520
You've got the edge.
There's more of this to be had.

161
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,440
- She's going to college next year?
- Yep.

162
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,920
- You're gonna lose her.
- That gives me a year to find her.

163
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,360
Mr. Mills, she'd like to see you.

164
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,160
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

165
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,520
So your daughter
wants to be a singer?

166
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,360
Yep, since she was 5.

167
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,240
It's not what everyone thinks it is.

168
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,720
Once the glam wears off, it's just
a lot of hotel rooms, lots of airports.

169
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,320
It's what she wants.

170
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,880
The first number is Gio,
my vocal coach.

171
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,000
If he says she can sing, she can sing.

172
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,720
He'll give her coaching she needs,
the fee is on me.

173
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,680
The second number is my manager.

174
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,680
If Gio clears her,
he'll make sure she gets a shot.

175
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,760
- Thank you.
- No, Mr. Mills, thank you.

176
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,520
- There she is.
- Dad.

177
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,280
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

178
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,240
- Hi.
- Hi.

179
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,720
Don't look so excited.

180
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,560
I was just surprised.
I thought it was just gonna be Kim and I.

181
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,280
I asked Mom to come.

182
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,480
One raspberry-banana milkshake,
extra cherries, just the way you like it.

183
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,000
- Thanks.
- Lennie... Lenore.

184
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,080
- Would you like something?
- I'm fine, thanks.

185
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,040
So?

186
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,600
So, Dad, guess what.

187
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,680
- You know my friend Amanda?
- Yep.

188
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,120
Her cousins asked us to spend vacation
with them in Paris.

189
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,240
How cool is that?

190
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,840
- Why do you want to go to Paris?
- Dad. Hello?

191
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,200
The Louvre, the Impressionist museum,
the Picasso Museum.

192
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,120
I didn't know you were so into art.

193
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,200
Are you kidding? I've been to the MOMA,
like, a hundred times.

194
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,280
Amanda went last summer, she came
back, she could practically speak French.

195
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,640
And because you're under 18...

196
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,880
...you need my permission
to leave the country?

197
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,360
Dad, please. I really, really wanna go.

198
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,280
They've got this
sick apartment overlooking the river.

199
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,760
- Just you and Amanda?
- And her cousins.

200
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,360
Don't make a big deal out of this, Bryan.
Just sign the paper.

201
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,200
- What?
- I'm not comfortable with this.

202
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,320
- Dad.
- I know the world, sweetie.

203
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,240
- Dad, please.
- A 17-year-old should not travel alone.

204
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,520
- I'm not gonna be alone.
- Two 17-year-olds.

205
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,920
Amanda's 19.

206
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,400
How about this?
How about if I go along?

207
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,280
You won't know I'm there.
I'm very good at being invisible.

208
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,600
As you so amply demonstrated
for most of her life.

209
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,600
Just sign the paper, Bryan.

210
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,520
I'll think about it.

211
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,080
Everyone at this table
knows what that means.

212
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,400
Hey, Kimmy, there's something else.

213
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,560
- I don't want anything else.
- Kim.

214
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,160
- I don't get you.
- What?

215
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,200
You sacrificed our marriage
in the service of the country.

216
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,080
You made a mess of your life
in service of your country.

217
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,960
Can't you sacrifice a little
this time for your daughter?

218
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,800
- I would sacrifice anything for her.
- What's your problem?

219
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,560
I'm not comfortable
putting my daughter at risk.

220
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,280
Putting our daughter at risk
by going to Paris?

221
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
You're pathetic.

222
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,240
- She's coming.
- Thanks.

223
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,160
Three conditions.

224
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,880
The address and phone number
of where you're staying.

225
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,880
You move, I wanna know where
and with whom you'll be staying.

226
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,520
Call me when you land. Call me
every night before you go to sleep.

227
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,320
It's international. My number is in.

228
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,560
- Okay, awesome.
- Kimmy, you're not focused.

229
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,960
- I am.
- What did I say?

230
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,360
You said call you when I land,
every night before I go to sleep...

231
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,400
...your phone's international,
the number's programmed in.

232
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,400
Okay, one last thing.
I get to take you to the airport.

233
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,320
Okay.

234
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,600
- There you go.
- Yes.

235
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,000
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

236
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,120
Mom!

237
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,080
I love you, Dad.

238
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,120
Mom, he signed it, he signed it.
I'm gonna go call Amanda!

239
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,000
Wouldn't it have been easier
to sign the first time?

240
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,000
Wouldn't it have been easier
if you and I had talked about it first?

241
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,600
Certain areas in Paris you should avoid.
I've written them down.

242
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,880
- Dad.
- Come on, take it.

243
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,720
We're gonna be spending 90 percent
of our time in museums. Don't worry.

244
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,760
That's like telling water
not to be wet, sweetie.

245
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,600
Mom says
your job made you paranoid.

246
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,720
Well, my job made me aware.

247
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,400
I used to ask Mom what your job was
that you were away all the time.

248
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,760
And she would tell me to ask you.

249
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,480
Whenever I did see you,
I was afraid to ask.

250
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,600
Yeah? Why?

251
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,120
I don't know. Maybe because...

252
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,840
...I was afraid to find out.

253
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,680
Like, maybe it was something
I wouldn't like.

254
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,040
I worked for the government.
You knew that.

255
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,280
So you were like a spy, right?

256
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,079
- What happens if I push this button?
- Don't touch that button.

257
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,600
Well, no, I was a...
I was a preventer, actually.

258
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,839
- A preventer?
- Yeah.

259
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,720
What did you prevent?

260
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,079
Bad things from happening.

261
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,760
So it was a good job?

262
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,360
Yes. Yep, it was.

263
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,200
Do you miss it?

264
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,960
I missed you more.

265
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,640
- Kim!
- Dad, there's Amanda.

266
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,520
Go ahead. I'll get the bags.

267
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,640
- Jimmy'll give you a hand with those.
- I can manage.

268
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,160
Lenore.

269
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,400
Do you know about this?
She's not just going to Paris.

270
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,280
- I know.
- She lied to me.

271
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,840
Yes, because she can't be honest
with you.

272
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,680
Why? What are you talking about?

273
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,480
Your rules and conditions.

274
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,800
What is this?

275
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,640
It's U2's European tour dates.

276
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,720
She's following a rock band
around Europe?

277
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,480
All kids do. Stuart got her tickets,
arranged her to stay in the best hotels.

278
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,800
Best hotels. You know,
you live in your little bubble here...

279
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,080
...behind your wall, with your maids
and chauffeurs and servants.

280
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,640
No idea what the world is like.

281
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,800
Yes, and neither will she
unless she goes out and experiences it.

282
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,400
Don't tell me I don't know the world.

283
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,360
For five years I waited for a phone call
that didn't come for weeks at a time.

284
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,800
For a knock on the door
telling me there'd be no calls anymore.

285
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,360
Listen, I know you moved here to build
some sort of relationship with Kimmy.

286
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,200
But you're not gonna do that
by smothering her.

287
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,080
Let her live, or I promise,
I promise you'll lose her.

288
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,800
Girls.

289
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,320
Kim!

290
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,040
I love you.

291
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,080
Let's go. Come on.

292
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,120
I'll teach you the French words
I know.

293
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,080
- Which may not be that much, but...
- Okay. Yeah, right.

294
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,480
Three. Okay, now take one...

295
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,880
Need some help?
One with the two of you?

296
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Yes, please.

297
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,400
- Okay.
- He's really cute.

298
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,880
Okay. Yeah, great. Very nice.

299
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,360
Where are you from?

300
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,480
California.

301
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,160
No. I'm Peter.

302
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,160
- This is Kim.
- Hi.

303
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,480
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

304
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,000
Hey.

305
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,880
You're going into Paris?

306
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,560
You know, taxis here
are so damned expensive.

307
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,800
Want to share?

308
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,720
- Yeah. Sure.
- Okay, perfect.

309
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,960
Thanks.

310
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,200
<i>To check arrivals,</i>
please press one.

311
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,440
<i>Please enter the flight number.</i>

312
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,440
<i>Flight 288 arrived</i>
in Paris Charles de Gaulle...

313
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,280
<i>...at 8 a. m. local time.</i>

314
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,480
Yeah.

315
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,040
Oh, are you serious?

316
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,440
- Oh, my God.
- Nice address.

317
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,880
Oh, yeah, thanks.

318
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,040
It's my cousins', but they're in Madrid,
so we have the whole place to ourselves.

319
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,680
How cool is that?

320
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,400
- I didn't know that.
- It's no biggie.

321
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,480
Well, I have to be going.

322
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,320
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, okay.

323
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,840
- You too.
- Bye.

324
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,920
Hey.

325
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,040
There is a party tonight at school.
Want to come?

326
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,880
- Sure. Yeah.
- We don't even know him.

327
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,120
What is there to know? He's hot.

328
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,360
- I come pick you up around 9?
- Okay, yeah.

329
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,440
Okay, great. Your apartment?

330
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,080
- It's the whole fifth floor. Hoffmann.
- Okay. See you tonight. Bye.

331
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
Bye.

332
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,240
Yeah.

333
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,800
Fifth floor.

334
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,880
Two girls around 18.

335
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,720
Oh, my God.

336
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,920
- How sick is this?
- Are you kidding me? It's great.

337
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,760
I just wish you would've told me
they weren't gonna be here.

338
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,560
- What's the difference?
- I told my dad they'd be here.

339
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,920
You told your dad you were
going to museums too.

340
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,160
Oh, come on. He's not gonna know.

341
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,720
- I'm gonna sleep with him.
- Who?

342
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,640
- Peter.
- You just met him.

343
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,400
I hear French guys are amazing in bed.

344
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,160
- Maybe he has a friend, huh?
- No.

345
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,440
- No.
- Oh, come on.

346
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,600
You gotta lose it sometime.
Might as well be in Paris.

347
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,040
Hey!

348
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,800
- Amanda, where's the bathroom?
- What?

349
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,360
I have to pee!

350
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,240
- Hello?
- It's me. Has Kim called you?

351
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,920
Bryan, she's 17. She's in Paris.
Give her some space.

352
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,320
<i>She'll call. Take a sleeping pill.</i>

353
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,720
Have a drink or something. Good night.

354
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,400
Good night.

355
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,880
Hi, Daddy.

356
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,520
Kim.

357
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,160
What did I say?
You were supposed to call me.

358
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,280
I'm sorry.

359
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,600
<i>I thought something was wrong</i>
with the phone.

360
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,400
- No. It was such a rush at the airport.
- All right.

361
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,120
Well, if I'd had the number
where you were staying...

362
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,880
<i>...I would've just called there.</i>

363
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,040
<i>What's the number?</i>

364
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,720
<i>- I don't have it.</i>
- Kimmy, come on.

365
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,560
<i>This is one of the conditions.</i>
Let me talk to the cousins.

366
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,320
<i>I'll get it from them.</i>

367
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,320
Dad, they're in Spain.
I didn't know. I swear.

368
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,440
To Spain?

369
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,000
Kim, is there anything else
you want to tell me?

370
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,040
Kimmy.

371
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,440
- There's someone here.
- The cousins are back?

372
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,560
No.

373
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,680
- Oh, my God. They got Amanda.
- What?

374
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,960
<i>What are you talking about? Kimmy?</i>

375
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,680
<i>- Dad.</i>
- Kim.

376
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,080
<i>- Kim.</i>
- Dad. They took her.

377
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,480
<i>- They took her.</i>
- All right, listen to me.

378
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,000
Oh, God.

379
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,720
- Did you meet anyone on the plane?
- No.

380
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,160
- In the airport?
- No. Yes, Peter.

381
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,560
<i>- Peter? Peter who?</i>
- I don't know.

382
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,800
<i>- An American?</i>
- No.

383
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,960
Did he know where you were staying?

384
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,880
He took a cab with us.

385
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,320
Dad, they're coming.

386
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,040
<i>- Please, I'm scared.</i>
- I know you are.

387
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,480
Stay focused, Kimmy.
You have to hold it together.

388
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,120
How many people are there?

389
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,040
- Three, four. I don't know.
- Where are you?

390
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,920
- I'm in the bathroom.
- Go to the next bedroom.

391
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,680
Get under the bed.
Tell me when you're there.

392
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,040
- I'm here.
- Now, the next part is very important.

393
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,480
They are going to take you.
Kim, stay focused, baby. This is key.

394
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,160
You will have five, maybe ten seconds.
Very important seconds.

395
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,680
<i>Leave the phone on the floor.</i>
Concentrate.

396
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,760
Shout out everything you see about them.
Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.

397
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,520
Anything you see. You understand?

398
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,400
They're there. I can hear them.

399
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,600
<i>Remember, concentrate.</i>

400
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,920
Put the phone closer so I can hear.

401
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,040
They're leaving. I think they're...

402
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,480
<i>Beard. Six feet.</i>
Tattoo right hand, moon and star.

403
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,680
I don't know who you are.

404
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,680
I don't know what you want.

405
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,600
If you are looking for a ransom,
I can tell you, I don't have money.

406
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,000
But what I do have
are a very particular set of skills.

407
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,840
Skills I've acquired
over a very long career.

408
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,080
Skills that make me a nightmare
for people like you.

409
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,480
If you let my daughter go now,
that'll be the end of it.

410
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,360
I will not look for you.
I will not pursue you.

411
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,160
But if you don't, I will look for you.

412
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,960
I will find you...

413
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,680
...and I will kill you.

414
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,240
<i>Good luck.</i>

415
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,720
Sam, it's me. I need a favor.

416
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,160
I'm gonna download something.
I need it analyzed. Right now.

417
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,080
- She's been taken.
- What?

418
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,480
- Any enemies overseas?
- Why would I have enemies?

419
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,480
You do business overseas
through multiple shell corporations.

420
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,120
You were involved in an oil deal with
a bunch of Russians that went south.

421
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,000
- How do you know that?
- I was not gonna let my daughter...

422
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,800
...live with someone without knowing
everything about them.

423
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,040
- I have a few resources...
- Now is not the time for dick measuring.

424
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,280
- Anyone looking to hurt you?
- Not that I know.

425
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,280
- Which room's Kim's?
- What happened?

426
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,840
I got a call from her. There were people
in the apartment. She was taken.

427
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,320
- Oh, God.
- Which one?

428
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,360
That one.

429
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,760
Is there something I should be doing?

430
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,800
You have a lease agreement
with NetJet through your company.

431
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,720
I do.

432
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,680
- Get me a plane to Paris.
- For when?

433
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,920
An hour ago.

434
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,680
- I'm gonna make the call. You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

435
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,320
Would you please
get her back to me, Bryan?

436
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,160
First I have to find her.

437
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,440
Sam, what have you got?

438
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,760
<i>They're speaking Albanian.</i>

439
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,280
Based on their accents and dialects,
they must be from Tropoja.

440
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,160
<i>The place is ground zero</i>
for scummers.

441
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,800
<i>Even the Russians</i>
give these guys a wide berth.

442
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,160
The one you spoke to,
his name is Marko.

443
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,400
We have information
that a mobster boss...

444
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,600
...by the name of Marko Hoxha
moved to Paris about six months ago.

445
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,360
<i>If he's the one, he's a big fish.</i>
The tattoo, by the way, is a group ID.

446
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,600
<i>- Am I on speaker or are you by yourself?</i>
- Lenore is here.

447
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,000
<i>- Hey, Lennie.</i>
- Hello, Sam.

448
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,400
She needs to hear it, Sam.

449
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,160
The specialty of the groups coming out
of this area is trafficking in women.

450
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,400
- Keep going.
- Okay.

451
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,840
Their previous m. o. was to offer women
from emerging East European countries...

452
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,400
<i>...like Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria,</i>
jobs in the West as maids and nannies.

453
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,960
Once smuggled in, they'd addict them
to drugs and turn them into prostitutes.

454
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,840
Lately, however, they've decided
that it's more economical...

455
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,720
...just to kidnap traveling young women.
Saves on transportation costs.

456
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,160
Oh, my little baby.

457
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,840
What else?

458
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,840
Based on the way these groups operate,
our analyst says...

459
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,840
...you have a 96-hour window
from the time she was grabbed.

460
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,360
- To what?
- To never finding her.

461
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,000
No, no, no.

462
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,600
<i>Daddy!</i>

463
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,560
<i>Mustache. Six feet.</i>
Tattoo on right hand, moon and star.

464
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
<i>Da...</i>

465
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,040
<i>Good luck.</i>

466
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,480
<i>Good luck.</i>

467
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,520
<i>Good luck.</i>

468
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,280
<i>Good luck.</i>

469
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,880
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

470
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,640
<i>Dad, they got Amanda.</i>

471
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,320
<i>Oh, God.</i>

472
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,200
<i>Dad, they got her.</i>

473
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,640
<i>They took her.</i>

474
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,680
<i>Go to the next bedroom.</i>
Get under the bed.

475
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,720
<i>- Tell me when you're there.</i>
- I'm here.

476
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,960
<i>Stay focused, baby.</i>
Leave the phone on the floor.

477
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,520
<i>Concentrate. Shout out</i>
everything you see about them.

478
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,400
<i>Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.</i>
Anything you see. You understand?

479
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,720
<i>They're there. I can hear them.</i>
Remember, concentrate.

480
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,160
<i>They're leaving. Daddy!</i>

481
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,200
<i>Dad!</i>

482
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,120
Beard. Six feet.
Tattoo right hand, moon and star.

483
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,120
Dad!

484
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

485
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,240
- I'm Peter.
- I'm Ingrid.

486
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,880
- On holidays?
- Yes.

487
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,400
- Me too.
- Cool.

488
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,000
Cabs here are so damned expensive.
Want to share?

489
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,680
- Sure. Why not?
- Great.

490
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,720
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

491
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,440
- Hey.
- Drive.

492
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,480
- The two American girls from yesterday?
- I don't know.

493
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,120
The next rib drives into your lungs.
The two American girls, where are they?

494
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,480
- Just like the old days.
- Would you have it any other way?

495
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,000
Between you and me? No.

496
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,400
But now that I sit behind a desk,
the world looks different.

497
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,080
- You mean, looks boring.
- I mean different.

498
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,120
Okay, a little boring. But is being retired
any more interesting?

499
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,480
It wasn't. Until my daughter
disappeared in Paris yesterday.

500
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,480
She and her friend were marked by a
spotter at the airport. Albanians took her.

501
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,160
- How do you know this?
- I'm retired, not dead.

502
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,840
And I assume you don't want
to go to the police.

503
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,440
I was told I have 96 hours.
That was 16 hours ago.

504
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,720
- Okay, first, we should find the spotter.
- I found him, he's dead.

505
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,320
You found him that way?

506
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,800
Bryan, you cannot just run around
tearing down Paris...

507
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,000
I'll tear down the Eiffel Tower
if I have to.

508
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,920
- Don't forget who you're talking to.
- I'm talking to a friend.

509
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,640
You are. But please remember,
your friend has a desk now.

510
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,320
"Deputy director, Internal Security".
Very impressive.

511
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,400
The Albanians?

512
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,320
They showed up from the East,
six, seven years ago.

513
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,920
Fifteen, twenty of them.
Now there are hundreds.

514
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,520
We don't even know how many.
And dangerous.

515
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,280
So I heard. Where do I find them?

516
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:23,800
The best place to start is Porte de Clichy.
Bryan, try not to make a mess.

517
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,000
I need an agent to follow somebody.

518
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,560
Little Red Riding Hood said to the wolf,
"Grand-ma! What big arms you have"!

519
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,640
- And the wolf replied...
- Jean Claude, it's your assistant.

520
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,880
Yes?

521
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,800
He went to the Interim branch
and rented a car.

522
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,440
- That's all?
- Yes, nothing else happening.

523
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,040
With him it doesn't take long,
don't be fooled.

524
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,760
- Gregor Milocivic?
- Yes. Yes, I am Gregor.

525
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,440
I'm Mr. Smith. Get in.

526
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,920
Here is my résumé.

527
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,840
The employment agency said
we would be doing translations.

528
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,760
Yes. Albanian to English.
You do speak Albanian?

529
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,960
Albanian, Serbian, Croatian.
I was a teacher in primary school...

530
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,800
...before the war began in Pristina...
- What's your rate?

531
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,120
My rate?

532
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,360
It is 25 per hour for the first 3 hours
and then it goes up...

533
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,480
Okay. Now, here's for 10 hours.
Wait here.

534
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,600
Mr. Smith, I do not understand.
What is the job exactly?

535
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,320
Right now the job is to wait here.

536
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,080
Good evening.

537
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,360
- Hi. Looking for a date?
- I love your dress. Is that silk?

538
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,400
I don't know.
You want to know the prices?

539
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,400
Just the way it falls, it must be silk.

540
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,800
How it compliments
the natural curves of your body.

541
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,800
The rate is 40 euros for the standard.

542
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,760
Standard? Could you be more specific?

543
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,520
Back home, the standard covers
a range of possibilities.

544
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,920
Like kissing,
you know, closed lips, open lips.

545
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,000
- If you're not buying, piss off.
- I didn't say I wasn't buying.

546
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,200
I like to get comfortable
before I purchase.

547
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,120
Like this karaoke machine I bought.

548
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,800
I must have read that manual
from cover to cover so many times.

549
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,320
I don't give a shit. You're gonna
get me in trouble if you don't buy.

550
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,600
- Trouble? Really? With who?
- Piss off.

551
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,280
Okay, okay. Listen, I'm sorry.

552
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,960
If I want a package deal,
do I get a discount?

553
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,640
- You cost me two now.
- My name's Bryan.

554
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,400
- Oh, God. You better leave.
- I thought we were negotiating.

555
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,680
Anton, I swear, it's not my fault.

556
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,360
- I told him...
- Why are you bothering the girl?

557
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,960
- None of your business.
- She is my business.

558
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,720
And if you're not spending money,
you're costing money.

559
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,480
- I was negotiating.
- No negotiating. Price is the price.

560
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,520
Now you owe me
for two that got away.

561
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,080
I don't owe you nothing.

562
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,280
- Fifty euros or I kick your ass.
- Sure, sure, okay.

563
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,480
Chill.

564
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,120
Okay. Here's your 50.

565
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,440
And another 50 for being an asshole.
Now get the hell out of here.

566
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,480
If I see you again, I'll kill you.

567
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,560
Mr. Smith, I do not know what kind of
job I'm supposed to do for you, but...

568
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,520
- You are to translate.
- Yes. But translate what?

569
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,840
This.

570
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,200
Translate.

571
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,240
- They're talking about you.
- What about me?

572
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,040
- They're not saying nice things.
- Be specific.

573
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,840
They're saying... Excuse me, Mr. Smith.
- what an asshole you are.

574
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,600
Please, if you can explain to me
why we're doing this...

575
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,400
Just translate.

576
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,240
One of them says,
the sausage gave him heartburn.

577
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,520
Keep going.

578
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,000
The other one is suggesting something
his grandmother used to give him.

579
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,800
- Do you really want to hear all this?
- Every word.

580
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,480
Now they're talking about football.
The game between Lazio and Marseille.

581
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,440
And they lost money on the betting.

582
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,000
- Perhaps if I knew the purpose...
- You're better off not knowing.

583
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,240
Is it still football?

584
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,400
One is on the phone.

585
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,760
He has to do a job
at the construction site.

586
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,840
Something about fresh merchandise
giving problems.

587
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,240
Mr. Smith,
I do not understand any of this.

588
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,560
You're not supposed to. Goodbye.

589
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,400
I asked for an English-Albanian
dictionary, did you bring one?

590
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,720
Thank you.

591
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,640
- It's all squared away.
- Really?

592
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,320
- Are you busy tonight?
- Of course.

593
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,920
I love you.

594
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,720
Where did you get this?

595
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,880
Where did you get this?

596
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,160
- I'm good.
- Who gave this to you?

597
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,400
- Who...? Who gave this to you?
- I'm good.

598
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,280
Hey.

599
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,840
Hey.

600
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,120
Lets go!

601
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,320
Come on.

602
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,400
I told you
he wouldn't stay quiet for long.

603
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,520
Okay, so what're we gonna do now?

604
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,560
Now since he's started this mess,
it wont be long before it's finished!

605
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,360
Oh shit!

606
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,440
Monsieur Allen, how are you?

607
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,320
Hello, Gilles. How's the wife?

608
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,920
Well, still in charge.

609
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,080
- Been a long time since I've seen you.
- Way too long.

610
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,640
- The usual accommodation?
- Plus one.

611
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,720
Yes?

612
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,640
<i>- We need to talk.</i>
- I'm listening.

613
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,320
Well, can't you come
and meet me first?

614
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,120
I can't see you. Where are you?

615
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,200
I can see you and hear you very well.

616
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,280
You can tell them,
to stop jogging now.

617
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,360
We'll get his cell phone signal
with your connection.

618
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,680
Okay, we're good,
we got his cell phone signal.

619
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,040
You didn't really think,
I was gonna come down there, did you?

620
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,240
I didn't think you were gonna
make such a mess.

621
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,400
I didn't have time to worry
about neatness.

622
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,880
<i>- I know. You have 70 hours.</i>
- Now I have 56.

623
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,800
No, now you have none.

624
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,400
My chief wanted to arrest you,
I convinced him to send you home.

625
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,480
<i>Air France 001 leaves today at 2.</i>
First class.

626
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,840
Courtesy of the French government
for past services rendered.

627
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,040
- And what about my daughter?
- I told you, I sit behind a desk now.

628
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,400
<i>I take my orders from someone</i>
who sits behind a bigger desk.

629
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,080
Come on, seven dead bodies,
three in hospital, a building destroyed.

630
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,520
<i>Total chaos at the airport.</i>

631
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,880
He wanted your ass in chains.
It's the best I could do, I'm sorry.

632
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,880
Sorry doesn't cut it, Jean-Claude.
Not this time.

633
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,480
You can't beat the state, Bryan.
You know that.

634
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,960
I'm not trying to.
I'm trying to save my daughter.

635
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,040
It was a trailer, not a building.

636
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,200
No, no, no. Leave it.

637
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,360
It's all right, it's fluids.

638
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,800
And medication
to counteract the drugs.

639
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,800
It's all right.

640
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,760
Where'd you get this?

641
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,560
Where did you get this jacket?

642
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,880
Did you get it from her?

643
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,400
Was it from this girl?

644
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,880
I didn't steal it.

645
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,920
- I was cold, she gave it to me.
- Where? Where did she give it to you?

646
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,920
- In the house.
- What house?

647
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,640
The house with the red door.

648
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,800
Sorry.

649
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,720
He said it was a party.

650
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,040
The girl who gave you this,
was she in the house?

651
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,280
She was nice.

652
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,200
I know.

653
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,560
She's my daughter.

654
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,120
I need to find this house.
Do you know where it is?

655
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,640
Paradise.

656
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,360
- Good morning.
- May I help you?

657
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,920
- I'm here to see your boss.
- No boss.

658
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,240
We're doing nothing wrong here.

659
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,080
One button,
and 30 agents will be here...

660
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,480
...before you have time
to scratch your balls.

661
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,120
Stop jerking around before
I close you down for wasting my time.

662
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,040
Wait here.

663
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,320
You have weapon?

664
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,840
You're holding it.

665
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,680
Black, one sugar, please.

666
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,680
What is it you want?

667
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,360
I'm here to negotiate the rates.

668
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,680
We already negotiated the rate
with Mr. Macon.

669
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,880
Mr. Macon has moved
to another division.

670
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,120
I'm here for the renegotiation.

671
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,240
Unless you think I'm being unreasonable,
let me explain ourselves.

672
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:24,800
Nice coffee. We have you under
satellite surveillance, 24 hours a day.

673
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,400
We hear everything you say,
we know everything you do.

674
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,960
Do you have any idea what it costs
just to change the angle...

675
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,480
of the lens on a satellite
orbiting 200 miles above the Earth?

676
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,960
And those costs have gone up.

677
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,560
Our costs go up, your costs go up.
It's only logical.

678
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,400
By the way,
which one of you is Marko?

679
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,240
Why do you want to know?

680
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,920
I was told Marko is in charge.

681
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,080
We are all Marko.

682
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,240
Marko from Tropoja.

683
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,960
We are all from Tropoja.

684
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:59,080
If that's the game you want to play,
the rate just went up 10 percent.

685
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,960
If you are trying to extort us because
we are immigrants, we know the law.

686
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,520
I'm extorting you because
you are breaking the law.

687
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,360
Which charge would you
like to be arrested for?

688
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,080
Drugs, kidnapping, prostitution?
Take your pick.

689
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,800
You come to this country,
take advantage of it...

690
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:17,120
and think because we're tolerant,
we are weak and helpless.

691
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,840
Your arrogance offends me.

692
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,240
For that,
the rate went up 10 percent.

693
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,360
Now, do you want to get down
to business or to keep playing?

694
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,680
- How much?
- Twenty percent.

695
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,840
And you have my word,
it'll not go up for a year.

696
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,720
Bring me the can.

697
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,440
How do you say "sugar"
in your language?

698
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,440
- Zethe.
- Zethe.

699
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,120
You've made a very good investment,
gentlemen.

700
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,640
See you in a month.

701
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,920
Oh...

702
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,440
A friend gave this to me.
It's Albanian. You mind translating it?

703
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,800
Good luck.

704
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,400
<i>- Good luck.</i>
- Good luck.

705
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,880
<i>- Good luck. Good luck.</i>
- Good luck.

706
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,960
You don't remember me.

707
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,640
We spoke on the phone
two days ago.

708
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,440
I told you I would find you.

709
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,800
Kim.

710
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,120
Amanda.

711
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,600
Wake up!

712
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,800
I need you to be focused.

713
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,640
Are you focused yet?

714
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,200
Where is this girl?

715
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,440
Where is she?

716
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,160
You know, we used to outsource
this kind of thing.

717
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,880
But what we found was,
the countries we outsourced to...

718
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,760
had unreliable power grids.
Very Third World.

719
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,640
Sometimes you'd turn on a switch,
power wouldn't come on for hours...

720
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,200
and then tempers would get short.
People would resort to...

721
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,080
things like pulling fingernails...
Acid drips on bare skin.

722
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,600
The whole... exercise,
would become counterproductive.

723
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,720
But here, the power's stable.

724
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,720
Here, there's a nice even flow.

725
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:53,360
Here, you can flip a switch
and the power stays on all day.

726
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,560
Where is she?

727
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:22,400
Now, I don't have any more time
to waste, Marko from Tropoja.

728
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,760
Give me what I need
or this switch'll stay on...

729
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,120
till they turn power off
for lack of payment on the bill.

730
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,520
Where is my daughter?

731
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:34,120
We don't keep virgins, we sell them.

732
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,320
She was virgin, lot of money.

733
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,880
You sold my daughter? You sold her?

734
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,320
Huh?

735
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,360
To who?

736
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,600
I don't know.

737
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,760
- What?
- Saint Clair.

738
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,120
Saint Clair.

739
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,120
Saint Clair? Saint Clair.
Is that a person, a place?

740
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,240
Person. Patrice Saint-Clair.

741
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,720
Patrice Saint-Clair.

742
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,120
Where can I find him?

743
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,800
I don't know, I don't know.

744
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,880
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

745
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,160
Please! I don't know!

746
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:13,200
I don't know! No! Please! Please.

747
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,080
Please.

748
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,120
Not that. Please.

749
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,120
I believe you.

750
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,040
But it's not gonna save you.

751
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,120
I'm Home.

752
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,760
- Papa!
- Papa!

753
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,760
- Good evening my dear.
- Good evening, papa.

754
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,760
The children should be in bed.

755
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,040
Look who dropped by.

756
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,000
Bryan, what a pleasant surprise.

757
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,120
Jean Claude.

758
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,640
The children waited up for you.

759
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,040
If you tuck them in, maybe we can eat
before everything gets cold.

760
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,040
Bryan, will you do the honors?

761
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,000
- Sure.
- I'll be just a minute.

762
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,800
Children, bed time.

763
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,800
- Oh...
- Time to go to sleep, thank you.

764
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,800
Good night.

765
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,360
I was just telling Bryan
how nice it's been...

766
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,280
since you left the old job
for the new one.

767
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,960
Home every night for dinner,
get to see the kids more.

768
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:42,040
Yeah, must be nice coming home every night, seeing your kids, knowing they're safe.

769
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,840
Bryan has been thinking
about relocating.

770
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,640
- Oh, really?
- Yes...

771
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,600
to Paris,
he's been visiting houses.

772
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,880
- White or dark meat?
- Dark, please.

773
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,480
Find anything interesting?

774
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,440
As a matter of fact, I did, over at
the 10th arrondissement on Rue Paradis.

775
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,480
People there know someone,
that works in your office, I think.

776
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,480
A Mr. Macon. Do you know him?

777
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,800
Oh, Henry. I call him Mr. Nervous.

778
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:06,560
Always seems like he's about to
have a problem. Carrots?

779
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,640
I got to the bottom of it,
Jean Claude.

780
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,240
I know everything.

781
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,120
I hope you're not involved
in this shit.

782
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,840
- What shit?
- This is not the time or place, Bryan.

783
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,320
- Are you involved?
- Involved in what?

784
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,040
What are you two talking about?

785
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:24,680
- Are you?
- My salary is X, my expenses are Y.

786
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,800
As long as my family is provided for...

787
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:29,480
I do not care,
where the difference comes from.

788
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,440
That is my entire involvement.

789
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,520
- What about my family?
- I told you...

790
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,040
I would help
as long as it didn't cause trouble.

791
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,840
Who is Patrice Saint Clair?

792
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:41,080
I don't know, I don't care.
I am driving you to the airport.

793
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,640
Jean Claude.

794
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,720
Quiet, Isabel.
Shut up!

795
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,400
Let's get going. Dinner is over.

796
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,360
- I'm not finished yet.
- Yes, you are.

797
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,600
- No!
- No, I'm not.

798
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,920
That's what happens when you sit
behind a desk. You forget things.

799
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,760
Like the weight in the hand of a gun
that's loaded and one that's not.

800
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,880
Isabelle!
You shot her cold.

801
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,040
It's a flesh wound.

802
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,960
But if you don't get me what I need,
the last thing you'll see...

803
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,840
before I make your children orphans,
is the bullet I put between her eyes.

804
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,280
Now, Patrice Saint Clair.

805
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,200
You could've made this
less painful...

806
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,960
if you had been more concerned
about my daughter...

807
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,000
and less concerned
about your god-damn desk.

808
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,680
Please apologize
to your wife for me.

809
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,720
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm here to see Mr. Saint Clair.

810
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:41,680
Your name, please.

811
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,040
I'm sorry,
your name is not on the list.

812
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,000
Oh, please check again.

813
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,600
Inside.

814
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,480
May I help you, sir?

815
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:48,279
- Your champagne.
- Yeah, I will take it.

816
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,800
<i>I have 50,000... 50,000.</i>

817
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,480
<i>50,000.</i>

818
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:09,080
<i>One hundred, 100,000.</i>

819
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:13,880
<i>One hundred, 150.</i>

820
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,040
<i>I have 150.</i>

821
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,760
Your champagne, sir.

822
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,760
<i>Two, I have two, 250.</i>

823
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,880
May I serve?

824
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,720
<i>- Please.</i>
- I have 250.

825
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,120
<i>Two-fifty.</i>

826
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,600
<i>Sold for 250,000.</i>

827
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:43,720
If you want me to bid?
There is one more left.

828
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,720
We'll see her in a moment.

829
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,800
<i>The last item.</i>

830
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,560
<i>As usual,</i>
we save the best for last.

831
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,800
<i>Speaks English, some French.</i>

832
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,680
<i>Certified pure.</i>

833
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,200
- Sorry.
- Get out.

834
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:12,360
<i>The bidding will begin at 100,000.</i>

835
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,720
<i>One hundred.</i>

836
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,640
<i>One hundred thousand.</i>

837
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,920
- I said...
- I heard what you said.

838
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,360
Buy her.

839
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,920
<i>I have 100.</i>

840
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,960
<i>- Buy her.</i>

841
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,920
<i>Two hundred.</i>

842
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,840
<i>Two-fifty, three, 350.</i>

843
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,520
<i>Three hundred and fifty thousand.</i>

844
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,160
<i>Four. Four.</i>

845
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,760
<i>Four-fifty, 450.</i>

846
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,040
<i>Four hundred and fifty thousand.</i>

847
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,760

850
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:06,720
<i>That concludes the sales for tonight.</i>
Thank you all for coming.

851
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:09,720
<i>- You can collect your purchases directly.</i>
- Move.

852
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:14,080
- You will never get away with this.
- If you wanna live, you'll make sure I do.

853
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,840
Now, Mister?

854
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:35,080
Well, we know you're not this man.
So, what do we call you?

855
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,800
It doesn't matter what we call you...

856
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,640
...what does matter
is what you're doing here.

857
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,800
The last girl, I'm her father.

858
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:51,280
- Oh, my.
- Give her to me.

859
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,120
I wish I could, honestly.

860
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,160
See, I'm a father myself.

861
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,280
I have two sons and a daughter...

862
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,360
but let me tell you something,
Mr. Whoever You Are.

863
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,800
This is a business.

864
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,640
This is a very unique business...

865
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,480
- with a very unique clientele.
- I'll pay.

866
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,000
In this business,
you have no refunds, returns...

867
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,160
discounts, buybacks.
All sales are final.

868
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:17,280
Besides discretion,
it's about the only rule we have.

869
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:21,560
Kill him. Quietly. I have guests.

870
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,360
Would you please go see
which part of "quietly"...

871
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,400
- they did not understand?
- Yes, sir.

872
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,760
Okay, we can resolve this.
I know how you feel.

873
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,160
We should talk, okay?
We can work this out.

874
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,000
You have no idea...

875
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,120
- Where is she?
- Please.

876
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,640
Understand. Please try...

877
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:02,080
There's a boat by the quay.

878
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,360
Please understand.

879
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,760
It was all business,
it wasn't personal.

880
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,920
It was all personal to me.

881
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,280
It's ready.

882
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,400
You... take the girls.

883
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,760
You... follow me.

884
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,360
Invaders!  Search the boat.

885
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,040
Where are you?

886
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,320
Why aren't you answering?

887
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,040
Get inside!

888
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,920
What's the problem?

889
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,160
The girls father has arrived.

890
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,120
Leave it to me.

891
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,920
We can...

892
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,920
- Daddy.
- Kim.

893
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,760
You came for me.

894
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,520
You came for me.

895
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:20,160
I told you I would.

896
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:50,960
<i>May I have your attention.</i>
If you're waiting for oversized bags...

897
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,200
Mom.

898
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,880
Oh, my God.

899
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,320
Oh, sweetie.

900
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,880
Oh, here, let me get that for you.

901
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,240
Bryan, if there's anything you need...

902
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,280
I've got everything I need.

903
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:11,280
I love you so much.

904
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:15,320
Stuart.

905
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:18,120
Thank you.

906
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,600
<i>Attention, travelers.</i>
You are not required to...

907
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:29,920
Shall we go?

908
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,120
Sure you don't wanna ride with us?

909
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:42,200
- I'll be fine. I'll take a cab. Thanks.
- All right.

910
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:52,280
- I love you, Dad.
- Love you too.

911
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:17,280
- Where are we?
- I told you. It's a surprise.

912
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,080
- Hi.
- Hi.

913
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:27,200
When someone says "hi,"
it's usually polite to say "hi" back.

914
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,600
Hi.

915
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,240
I heard you wanna be a singer.

916
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,400
- I do.
- She does.

917
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:37,160
Well, come on in.
Let's see what you got.

918
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,600
" THE END"
