1
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:43,686
Out west there was this fella,

2
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:45,895
fella I want to tell you about,

3
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,190
fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski -

4
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:52,694
at least that's the handle
his parents gave him.

5
00:00:52,777 --> 00:00:56,239
But he never had
much use for it himself.

6
00:00:56,322 --> 00:01:00,200
This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.

7
00:01:00,284 --> 00:01:04,705
Now, Dude, that's a name
no one would self-apply

8
00:01:04,788 --> 00:01:06,707
where I come from.

9
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,586
There was a lot about the Dude
that didn't make sense to me,

10
00:01:11,669 --> 00:01:14,922
and a lot about
where he lived, likewise.

11
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:18,509
But then again,

12
00:01:18,593 --> 00:01:22,597
maybe that's why I found
the place so darn interesting.

13
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:30,437
They call Los Angeles
the City of Angels.

14
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,690
I didn't find it
to be that exactly.

15
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:37,026
But there are
some nice folks there.

16
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:40,488
'Course I can't
say I seen London,

17
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:42,990
and I never been to France,

18
00:01:43,074 --> 00:01:46,994
and I ain't never seen
no queen in her damned undies.

19
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:50,080
But I'll tell you what,

20
00:01:50,163 --> 00:01:52,332
after seeing Los Angeles

21
00:01:52,415 --> 00:01:55,293
and this story
I'm about to unfold,

22
00:01:55,377 --> 00:01:59,881
well, I guess I seen somethin'
every bit as stupefyin'

23
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:02,759
as you'd see
in any other places,

24
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:05,052
and in English, too.

25
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:07,971
So I can die
with a smile on my face

26
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:11,266
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

27
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,019
Now, this story
I'm about to unfold

28
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:16,270
took place
back in the early 90s,

29
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:21,275
about the time of our conflict
with Saddam and the Iraqis.

30
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:24,779
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man -

31
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:28,991
I won't say a hero,
'cause what's a hero?

32
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:31,993
But sometimes there's a man -

33
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:35,080
and I'm talking
about the Dude here -

34
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:37,708
sometimes there's a man...

35
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:42,546
Well, he's the man
for his time and place.

36
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:44,797
He fits right in there,

37
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,508
and that's the Dude,

38
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:49,552
in Los Angeles.

39
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:52,471
And even if he's a lazy man,

40
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:55,516
and the Dude was
most certainly that,

41
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,185
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

42
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:01,187
which would place him high

43
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:04,399
in the running
for laziest worldwide.

44
00:03:04,482 --> 00:03:06,818
But sometimes there's a man,

45
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:08,862
sometimes...

46
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:11,030
there's a man...

47
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:15,075
Wow, lost my train
of thought here.

48
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:18,287
But... ah, hell.

49
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,205
I done introduced him enough.

50
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:23,458
'This will not stand.

51
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:27,378
'This will not stand,
this aggression against Kuwait.'

52
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:59,367
Where's the money, Lebowski?

53
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:04,788
I want that money, Lebowski.
Bunny says you're good for it.

54
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:07,499
Where's the money, Lebowski?

55
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:09,793
Where's the money, Lebowski?

56
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:12,170
Where's the fucking
money, shithead?

57
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:17,758
It's down there somewhere.
Let me take another look.

58
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,761
Don't fuck with us!

59
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,224
Your wife owes money
to Jackie Treehorn.

60
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,351
That means you owe
money to Jackie Treehorn.

61
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,270
Ever thus
to deadbeats, Lebowski.

62
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,814
Don't do that...

63
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,276
- Not on the rug, man.
- See?

64
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,488
See what happens, Lebowski?
You see what happens?

65
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,615
Nobody calls me Lebowski.
You got the wrong man.

66
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,409
I'm the Dude, man.

67
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:49,663
Your name's Lebowski, Lebowski.
Your wife is Bunny.

68
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:53,375
My... my wife... my wife, Bunny?

69
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,626
Do you see a wedding ring?

70
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,003
Does this place
look like I'm married?

71
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:00,464
The toilet seat's up, man.

72
00:05:07,846 --> 00:05:09,848
What the fuck is this?

73
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:13,101
Obviously, you're not a golfer.

74
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,230
- Woo?
- Yeah?

75
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:20,775
Isn't this guy supposed
to be a millionaire?

76
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:22,609
Fuck!

77
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:27,531
- Yeah, what do you think?
- He looks like a fucking loser.

78
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:30,492
Hey, at least I'm housebroken.

79
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:34,495
Fucking time wasted.
Thanks a lot, asshole.

80
00:07:44,074 --> 00:07:47,577
I'm throwing rocks tonight.
Mark it, Dude.

81
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,080
This was a valued rug.
This was a...

82
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:54,083
It really
tied the room together.

83
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,294
So this was a valued...

84
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:58,087
- What tied the room together?
- My rug.

85
00:07:58,171 --> 00:08:00,088
- Were you listening, Donny?
- What?

86
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:02,632
Were you listening
to the Dude's story?

87
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,092
I was bowling.

88
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:08,221
You have no frame of reference,
like a child who wanders in...

89
00:08:08,305 --> 00:08:10,140
Walter, what's the point?

90
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,309
There's no reason -
here's my point, Dude -

91
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,769
- there's no reason...
- Yeah, what's your point?

92
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:17,146
- Huh?
- Walter, what is the point...

93
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:19,648
We know who is at fault here.

94
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,692
What the fuck
are you talking about?

95
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:24,528
No, what the fuck are you...
I'm not...

96
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:27,655
We're talking about
unchecked aggression here.

97
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:29,491
- What is he talking about?
- My rug.

98
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:32,035
Forget it,
you're out of your element.

99
00:08:32,118 --> 00:08:35,955
The Chinaman who peed on my rug,
I can't go give him a bill.

100
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,750
So what the fuck
are you talking about?

101
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,959
The Chinaman
is not the issue here.

102
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:44,088
I'm talking about
drawing a line in the sand.

103
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:46,465
Across this line, you do not...

104
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:50,135
Also, Dude, "Chinaman" is not
the preferred nomenclature.

105
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:52,178
"Asian-American," please.

106
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:55,848
This isn't a guy who built
the railroads here...

107
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:58,434
- What the fuck...
- He peed on my rug.

108
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:02,313
- He peed on the Dude's rug.
- You're out of your element!

109
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:05,274
Dude, the Chinaman
is not the issue here.

110
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:07,651
- So, who... who...
- Jeff Lebowski.

111
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:11,446
The other Jeffrey Lebowski,
the millionaire.

112
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,366
That's fucking interesting, man.
That's fucking interesting.

113
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:17,577
Plus, he has the wealth
and the resources...

114
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:20,246
so there's no reason,
no fucking reason

115
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:22,957
why his wife
should go out, owe money,

116
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,626
and then they pee
on your fucking rug!

117
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,461
- Am I wrong?
- No.

118
00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:29,213
- Am I wrong?
- But...

119
00:09:29,296 --> 00:09:31,132
OK, then.

120
00:09:31,215 --> 00:09:34,884
That rug really tied
the room together, did it not?

121
00:09:34,968 --> 00:09:37,178
- Fuckin' A!
- And he peed on it.

122
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:38,847
Donny, please.

123
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,808
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

124
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:45,060
His name is Lebowski?
That's your name, Dude.

125
00:09:45,144 --> 00:09:48,647
He should compensate me
for the fucking rug.

126
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:52,443
His wife owes money,
and they pee on my rug?

127
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:56,238
- They pee on your fucking rug.
- They peed on my fucking rug.

128
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:58,115
That's right, Dude.

129
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,409
They peed on your fucking rug.

130
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:06,289
This is the study.
The various commendations...

131
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,458
Jeffrey Lebowski.

132
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,752
- Honorary degrees, etcetera.
- Very impressive.

133
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:14,338
Oh, please feel free
to inspect them.

134
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:17,841
- Oh, I'm not really that...
- Oh, please, please.

135
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:20,344
That is the key
to the city of Pasadena,

136
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:24,889
which Mr. Lebowski received in
recognition of various civic...

137
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:26,807
Oh, that's the Los Angeles

138
00:10:26,891 --> 00:10:29,685
Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award,

139
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:32,355
which is... not
necessarily given every year.

140
00:10:32,438 --> 00:10:35,900
Hey, is this, uh,
is this him with Nancy?

141
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:40,111
Yes, indeed, that is Mr. Lebowski
with the First Lady...

142
00:10:40,195 --> 00:10:42,781
That's Lebowski
on the left there?

143
00:10:42,864 --> 00:10:45,492
Of course.
Mr. Lebowski on the left...

144
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:48,662
He's a cripple... you know,
a... handicapped guy?

145
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:52,206
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.
This picture was taken

146
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:55,292
when Mrs. Reagan was
First Lady of the nation.

147
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:58,337
- Yes, yes. Not of California.
- Pope John.

148
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,923
He met privately
with the president,

149
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:03,634
but there was no time
for a photo opportunity.

150
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:05,927
- Nancy's pretty good.
- Wonderful woman!

151
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,845
These are...

152
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:11,140
Those are Mr. Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

153
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:13,351
Different mothers?
Racially, pretty cool.

154
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:17,813
They're not literally
his children.

155
00:11:17,896 --> 00:11:20,232
They're the Little
Lebowski Urban Achievers,

156
00:11:20,315 --> 00:11:22,693
inner-city children of promise

157
00:11:22,776 --> 00:11:25,570
but without the means
for a higher education.

158
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:28,490
Mr. Lebowski is committed
to sending them to college.

159
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:31,158
Excuse me. Thank you, thank you.

160
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:34,203
Far out. Think he's
got room for one more?

161
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:36,580
One, uh... Oh!

162
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:41,085
You never went to college.
Please, don't touch that.

163
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:44,087
Yeah, I did, but I spent
most of my time...

164
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,215
occupying various
administration buildings,

165
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:49,300
smoking a lot of Thai stick,

166
00:11:49,384 --> 00:11:52,012
breaking into the R.O.T.C.
And bowling.

167
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:54,556
To tell you the truth,
I don't remember much.

168
00:12:00,144 --> 00:12:03,439
OK, sir, you're a Lebowski,
I'm a Lebowski,

169
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,441
that's terrific.

170
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,569
But I'm very busy,
as I imagine you are.

171
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:11,029
What can I do for you, sir?

172
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:14,657
Well, sir, it's this rug I have,

173
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:17,618
it really tied
the room together...

174
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:21,539
You told Brandt, he told me.
Where do I fit in?

175
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:24,875
Well, they were
looking for you, these guys.

176
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,002
I'll say it again.

177
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:30,255
You told Brandt
on the phone, he told me.

178
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:32,174
I know what happened. Yes?

179
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:35,802
So you know that they were
trying to piss on your rug?

180
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:38,304
Did I urinate on your rug?

181
00:12:38,387 --> 00:12:40,973
Did you personally
come and pee on my rug?

182
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:44,310
Hello! Do you speak English?
Parla usted ingles?

183
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:47,438
I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

184
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:50,607
No, like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

185
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,859
I want to understand this, sir.

186
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:56,655
Every time a rug is
micturated upon in this city,

187
00:12:56,738 --> 00:12:58,365
I have to compensate...

188
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:02,285
Come on, man, I'm not
trying to scam anybody here.

189
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:04,161
I... I was just...

190
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:07,706
You're just looking for
a handout like every other...

191
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,584
Are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?

192
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:14,296
Wait, let me
explain something to you.

193
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,840
I am not Mr. Lebowski.
You're Mr. Lebowski.

194
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:20,885
I'm the Dude.
So that's what you call me,

195
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:24,389
you know, uh, that
or, uh, his Dudeness,

196
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:27,433
or Duder, or, you
know, uh, el Duderino,

197
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:30,644
if you're not into
the whole brevity thing.

198
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,231
- Are you employed, sir?
- Employed?

199
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:39,611
You don't look for a job
dressed like that on a weekday?

200
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,738
Is this a... What day is this?

201
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,367
Well, I do work, sir.
So if you don't mind...

202
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,786
No, I do mind. The Dude minds.

203
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,913
This will not stand, you know.

204
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,125
This aggression
will not stand, man.

205
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:58,169
- I mean, your wife owes...
- My wife is not the issue!

206
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:02,340
I hope that my wife will learn
to live on her ample allowance.

207
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,719
If not, that's
her problem, not mine,

208
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:07,804
just as the rug is your problem,

209
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:12,391
just as every bum's lot in life
is his own responsibility,

210
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:14,852
regardless of who
he chooses to blame.

211
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:18,063
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.

212
00:14:18,147 --> 00:14:20,983
Some Chinaman
took them from me in Korea.

213
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:24,193
But I went out
and achieved anyway.

214
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:28,156
I cannot solve your problems,
sir, only you can.

215
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:32,285
- Oh, fuck it.
- "Oh, fuck it."

216
00:14:32,368 --> 00:14:35,079
Yes, that's your answer
to everything.

217
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:36,621
Tattoo it on your forehead.

218
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:40,000
Your revolution
is over, Mr. Lebowski!

219
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,711
Condolences! The bums lost!

220
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:46,465
My advice to you
is to do what your parents did!

221
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:48,342
Get a job, sir!

222
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:52,595
The bums will always lose!
Do you hear me, Lebowski?

223
00:14:52,678 --> 00:14:54,180
The bums...

224
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:58,559
How was your meeting,
Mr. Lebowski?

225
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:03,146
OK. The old man told me
to take any rug in the house.

226
00:15:03,229 --> 00:15:07,400
Well, enjoy, and perhaps
we'll see you again, Dude.

227
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:11,404
Sure, if I'm in
the neighborhood, you know,

228
00:15:11,488 --> 00:15:13,365
and, um...

229
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:15,783
I need to use the john.

230
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:28,753
Blow on them.

231
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:31,214
Go ahead, blow.

232
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:36,094
You want me to blow
on your toes?

233
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:39,430
Uh-huh. I can't blow that far.

234
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,938
Are you sure he won't mind?

235
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:51,817
He doesn't care about anything.
He's a nihilist.

236
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,486
Oh, that must be exhausting.

237
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:56,362
You're not blowing.

238
00:15:56,445 --> 00:15:59,407
He has to be getting along,
Mrs. Lebowski.

239
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,659
Oh, you're Bunny.

240
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,413
I'll suck your cock for $1,000.

241
00:16:09,624 --> 00:16:11,293
Wonderful woman.

242
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:14,045
We're very fond of her.
Very free-spirited.

243
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:16,798
Brandt can't watch,
or he has to pay 100.

244
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:19,384
That's marvellous.

245
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:25,306
I'm just gonna
go find a cash machine.

246
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:31,687
Whoo! Slamming them tonight!

247
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,939
You guys are dead in the water.

248
00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:36,816
All right! Way to go, Donny!

249
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,611
If you will it, it is no dream.

250
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:43,823
You're 20 minutes late, man.
What the fuck is that?

251
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:45,825
Theodore Herzel.

252
00:16:45,908 --> 00:16:49,995
The state of Israel. If you
will it, Dude, it is no dream.

253
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,832
The carrier. What's
in the fucking carrier?

254
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:57,502
Oh, Cynthia's dog.
I think it's a Pomeranian.

255
00:16:57,586 --> 00:16:59,755
I can't leave him,
he eats the furniture.

256
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:02,381
I'm watching it
while they're in Hawaii.

257
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:05,885
- You brought it bowling?
- "Brought it bowling"?

258
00:17:05,968 --> 00:17:09,138
I didn't rent it shoes,
I'm not buying it a beer,

259
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:11,349
he's not taking your turn, Dude.

260
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:14,809
If my ex-wife asked me
to take care of her dog

261
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:17,604
while she and her boyfriend
went to Honolulu,

262
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:19,439
I'd tell her to fuck herself.

263
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:21,566
Dude, you don't have an ex,

264
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,694
and this is a fucking show dog
with fucking papers.

265
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:29,365
You can't board it. It gets
upset. Its hair falls out.

266
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,492
Over the line!

267
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:35,037
Sorry, you were over the line.
That's a foul.

268
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,122
Bullshit. Mark it 8, Dude.

269
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:40,084
Excuse me, mark it zero.
Next frame.

270
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,418
Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it 8, Dude.

271
00:17:42,502 --> 00:17:45,797
This is not 'Nam, this
is bowling. There are rules.

272
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,216
Hey, Walter, come on,
it's Smokey.

273
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,469
His toe slipped over.
It's just a game.

274
00:17:51,552 --> 00:17:55,138
It determines who enters
the round-robin. Am I wrong?

275
00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:57,015
- Yeah, but...
- Am I wrong?

276
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:59,059
Yeah, but I wasn't over.

277
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:01,853
Give me the marker, Dude.
I'm marking an 8.

278
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:05,565
Smokey, my friend,
you're entering a world of pain.

279
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:08,150
- Walter...
- You mark that frame an 8,

280
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:11,153
you're entering a world of pain.

281
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:14,031
- I'm not...
- A world of pain.

282
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:16,534
Look, Dude,
this is your partner.

283
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:18,411
Has the world gone crazy?

284
00:18:18,494 --> 00:18:21,288
Am I the only one
who cares about the rules?

285
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:22,747
Mark it zero!

286
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:25,959
- They're calling the cops.
- Mark it zero!

287
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:28,753
- Put the piece away.
- Walter...

288
00:18:28,837 --> 00:18:31,464
You think I'm fucking around?
Mark it zero!

289
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:40,472
All right, it's fucking zero.

290
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:43,892
You happy, you crazy fuck?

291
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:47,645
It's a league game, Smoke.

292
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:51,858
You can't do that, man.

293
00:18:51,941 --> 00:18:54,319
These guys are like me.
They're pacifists.

294
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:56,446
Smokey was
a conscientious objector.

295
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:59,282
I myself dabbled in pacifism,

296
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:01,450
not in 'Nam, of course.

297
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:04,119
You know he's got
emotional problems.

298
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:06,538
You mean, beyond pacifism?

299
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:10,125
He's fragile, very fragile.

300
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,961
I did not know that.

301
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:17,214
Well, it's all
water under the bridge,

302
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:19,925
and we do enter
the next round-robin.

303
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:22,511
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're not wrong.

304
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:25,847
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're just an asshole!

305
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,559
OK. We play Quintana
and O'Brien next week.

306
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:32,354
They should be pushovers.

307
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,940
Man, will you just...

308
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:37,275
Just take it easy, man.

309
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,693
That's your answer
for everything, Dude.

310
00:19:39,777 --> 00:19:44,865
Look at our current situation
with that camelfucker in Iraq.

311
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:47,284
Pacifism is not
something to hide behind.

312
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:49,578
Just take it easy, man.

313
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:51,622
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

314
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:55,208
- Waving the fucking gun around?
- Calmer than you are.

315
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,001
Just take it easy!

316
00:19:58,002 --> 00:20:00,046
Calmer than you are.

317
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,176
'Dude, this is Smokey.

318
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:08,345
'I don't want to
be a hard-on about this.

319
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:10,389
'I know it wasn't your fault,

320
00:20:10,472 --> 00:20:13,892
'but Gilbert and I
will submit this to the league

321
00:20:13,976 --> 00:20:16,603
'and ask them
to set aside the round,

322
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:18,729
'maybe forfeit it to us.

323
00:20:18,813 --> 00:20:21,649
'So, like I say,
you know, fair warning.

324
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:23,776
'Tell Walter. I'm sorry.'

325
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,573
'Mr. Lebowski,
this is Brandt at, uh,

326
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:32,200
'well, at Mr. Lebowski's office.

327
00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:34,661
'Please, call us
when it's convenient.'

328
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:40,333
'This is Bill Selliger of
the Southern Cal Bowling League.

- Dude.
- Hey, Monty.

334
00:20:56,849 --> 00:21:01,144
Dude, I... I finally got...
the venue I wanted.

335
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:04,814
I'm performing my dance quintet,
you know, my cycle,

336
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:08,109
at Crane Jackson's Fountain
Street Theater on Tuesday night.

337
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:12,487
And, well, I'd love it
if you came and gave me notes.

338
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,489
I'll be there, man.

339
00:21:18,285 --> 00:21:20,370
Tomorrow's already the 10th.

340
00:21:20,454 --> 00:21:22,331
Far out.

341
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,585
Oh. Oh, all right, OK.

342
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:30,296
Just slip the rent
under my door.

343
00:21:33,424 --> 00:21:35,051
'...serious infraction

344
00:21:35,134 --> 00:21:37,802
'and examine your standing.
Thank you.'

345
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,349
'Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.

346
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:45,644
'Please, call when you get in,
and I'll send a limo.

347
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:49,606
'I hope you're not avoiding
this call because of the rug,

348
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:52,566
'which, I assure you,
is not a problem.

349
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,735
'We need your help, and, uh...

350
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:57,112
'well, we'd like to see you.

351
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:58,989
'Thank you. It's Brandt.'

352
00:22:00,407 --> 00:22:03,953
We've had terrible news.
Mr. Lebowski's in seclusion.

353
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:10,708
Mr. Lebowski.

354
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:18,590
Funny...

355
00:22:19,174 --> 00:22:22,761
I can look back
on a life of achievement,

356
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:25,097
challenges met,

357
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,140
competitors bested,

358
00:22:27,224 --> 00:22:29,977
obstacles overcome.

359
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:34,647
I've accomplished more
than most men

360
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,316
and without the use of my legs.

361
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,986
What...

362
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:43,656
What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?

363
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,075
Dude.

364
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:51,621
I... I don't know, sir.

365
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:54,874
Is it being prepared
to do the right thing?

366
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,836
Whatever the cost?

367
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,755
Isn't that what makes a man?

368
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,924
Sure, that
and a pair of testicles.

369
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,386
You're joking. But...

370
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,264
Perhaps you're right.

371
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:13,850
You mind if I do a "J"?

372
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,352
Bunny...

373
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,939
Excuse me?

374
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,567
Bunny Lebowski,

375
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,569
she is the light of my life.

376
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:28,780
Are you surprised
at my tears, sir?

377
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,701
Fuckin' A.

378
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:36,038
Strong men also cry.

379
00:23:36,537 --> 00:23:40,291
Strong men also cry.

380
00:23:42,543 --> 00:23:45,755
I received this fax
this morning.

381
00:23:48,215 --> 00:23:50,425
As you can see,

382
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:52,552
it is a ransom note.

383
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:55,513
"We have Bunnie."

384
00:23:55,597 --> 00:24:00,101
Sent by men who can't achieve
on a level field of play.

385
00:24:00,185 --> 00:24:02,895
"Gather one million dollars

386
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:06,023
in unmarked,
non-consecutive twenties."

387
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:09,026
- Weaklings!
- "Await instructions."

388
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:10,903
- Bums!
- "No funny stuff."

389
00:24:10,986 --> 00:24:14,490
- Bummer.
- Huh?

390
00:24:14,573 --> 00:24:16,532
This is a bummer, man.

391
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:18,493
That's, uh, that's a bummer.

392
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:22,330
Brandt will
fill you in on the details.

393
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:39,721
Mr. Lebowski will make you
a generous offer

394
00:24:39,805 --> 00:24:43,849
to act as courier once we get
instructions for the money.

395
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:45,393
Why me, man?

396
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:48,562
He believes the culprits
might be the people

397
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:51,148
who, uh... soiled your rug,

398
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:55,819
and you're in a unique position
to confirm or disconfirm this.

399
00:24:55,902 --> 00:24:58,196
He thinks
the carpet-pissers did this?

400
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,824
Well, Dude, we just don't know.

401
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:39,290
Fucking Quintana.

402
00:26:39,374 --> 00:26:41,792
That creep can roll, man.

403
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,919
Yeah, but he's a pervert, Dude.

404
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,754
Yeah.

405
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,840
No. He's a sex offender
with a record.

406
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:52,511
He did six months for exposing
himself to an 8-year-old.

407
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:55,721
When he moved to Hollywood,
he had to go door-to-door

408
00:26:55,805 --> 00:26:57,598
to tell everyone
he was a pederast.

409
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,059
What's a pederast, Walter?

410
00:27:00,142 --> 00:27:02,603
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

411
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:08,275
- So... How much they give you?
- 20 grand, man.

412
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:12,112
- And I get to keep the rug.
- Just for making a hand-off?

413
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:14,406
Yeah. They gave Dude a beeper.

414
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:18,285
- So whenever they call...
- What if it's during a game?

415
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:22,288
- If it's during league play...
- What's during league play?

416
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:25,416
Life doesn't stop and start
at your convenience,

417
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:28,627
- you piece of shit.
- What's wrong with Walter?

418
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:31,380
I figure it's easy money.
It's harmless.

419
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:35,049
- She probably did it herself.
- What do you mean, Dude?

420
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:37,844
Rug pee-ers didn't do this.
Look at it.

421
00:27:37,927 --> 00:27:41,889
A young trophy wife
marries this guy for his money.

422
00:27:41,973 --> 00:27:44,392
She figures
he isn't giving her enough.

423
00:27:44,475 --> 00:27:46,436
You know, she owes money.

424
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:50,272
- That fuckin'... bitch.
- It's all goddamn fake, man.

425
00:27:50,355 --> 00:27:52,524
It's like Lenin said.

426
00:27:52,608 --> 00:27:55,694
You look for the person
who will benefit,

427
00:27:55,777 --> 00:27:58,947
- and, uh, you know...
- I am the walrus?

428
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:01,407
You know, you'll, uh...

429
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,118
- You know what I'm saying.
- I am the walrus.

430
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:06,037
That fuckin' bitch!

431
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,956
- I am the walrus.
- Shut the fuck up, Donny!

432
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,584
V.I. Lenin.
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

433
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,960
What the fuck
is he talking about?

434
00:28:14,044 --> 00:28:17,088
Fucking exactly what happened.
That makes me sick.

435
00:28:17,172 --> 00:28:19,883
- What do you care, Walter?
- Those rich fucks.

436
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:21,801
This whole fuckin' thing.

437
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:24,888
I didn't watch my buddies die
face-down in the mud

438
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:28,057
so that this fucking strumpet,
this fucking whore...

439
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,601
I don't see
any connection with Vietnam.

440
00:28:30,684 --> 00:28:32,186
No literal connection.

441
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:35,231
Face it, there's no
connection. Your roll.

442
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:38,150
- But my point is...
- Your roll.

443
00:28:38,234 --> 00:28:40,235
Are you ready to be fucked?

444
00:28:41,194 --> 00:28:44,781
I see you roll your way
into the semis.

445
00:28:44,864 --> 00:28:47,533
Dios mio, man.

446
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:50,703
Liam and me,
we're gonna fuck you up.

447
00:28:50,787 --> 00:28:55,165
Yeah? Well... you know,
that's just like, uh...

448
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:57,209
your opinion, man.

449
00:28:58,085 --> 00:29:00,879
Let me tell you
something, pendejo,

450
00:29:00,963 --> 00:29:04,007
you pull any crazy shit with us,

451
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:06,468
you flash a piece out
on the lanes,

452
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,637
I'll take it
and stick it up your ass

453
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,890
and pull the fuckin' trigger
till it goes click.

454
00:29:13,641 --> 00:29:17,603
- Jesus.
- You said it, man.

455
00:29:17,687 --> 00:29:20,814
Nobody fucks with the Jesus.

456
00:29:25,694 --> 00:29:27,779
8-year-olds, Dude.

457
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:21,717
Oh, man.

458
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,687
They called 80 minutes ago.

459
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,565
Take the money,
drive north on the 405.

460
00:31:36,648 --> 00:31:39,818
They will call you with
instructions in 40 minutes.

461
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:43,905
One person only. They were clear
on that, or I'd go with you.

462
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:46,740
- What happened to your jaw?
- Oh, nothin'.

463
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:51,996
Here's the money. And the phone.

464
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,790
Please, Dude,
follow their instructions.

465
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:56,333
All right.

466
00:31:56,417 --> 00:32:00,003
- Her life is in your hands.
- Oh, man, don't say that.

467
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:02,088
Mr. Lebowski asked me
to repeat that.

468
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,507
- Her life is in your hands.
- Shit, man.

469
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,426
Her life is in your hands, Dude.

470
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:09,470
Report back to us
as soon as it's done.

471
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,188
Where the fuck are you goin'?

472
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,232
Take the ringer. I'll drive.

473
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:24,984
- What? The what?
- The ringer.

474
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:27,028
The ringer, Dude.

475
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,662
- What the...
- Have they called?

476
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,873
- What the hell is this?
- My dirty undies, Dude.

477
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:42,542
Laundry. The whites.

478
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:46,379
I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies.

479
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:48,632
The weight.
The ringer cannot look empty.

480
00:32:48,715 --> 00:32:50,550
What the fuck are you thinking?

481
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:53,010
You're right, Dude.
I got to thinking,

482
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:55,930
why should we settle for
a measly fuckin' 20 grand...

483
00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:58,849
We? You said
you just wanted to come along.

484
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:01,352
Why should we settle
for 20 grand

485
00:33:01,435 --> 00:33:04,103
when we can keep
the entire million? Am I wrong?

486
00:33:04,187 --> 00:33:07,023
Yes, you're wrong.
This isn't a game, man.

487
00:33:07,106 --> 00:33:09,442
It is a game.
You said so yourself.

488
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:12,195
- She kidnapped herself.
- I said I thought...

489
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:19,117
Dude here.

490
00:33:19,201 --> 00:33:21,328
'Who is this?'

491
00:33:21,411 --> 00:33:25,040
Dude the bagman.
Where do you want us to go?

492
00:33:25,123 --> 00:33:28,001
- 'Us?'
- Shit!

493
00:33:30,045 --> 00:33:33,589
Yeah, you know,
me and the driver.

494
00:33:33,673 --> 00:33:37,009
I'm not handling the money,
driving the car...

495
00:33:37,093 --> 00:33:40,054
- 'Shut the fuck up!'
- Are you fucking this up?

496
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:42,223
Who is that?

497
00:33:42,306 --> 00:33:44,849
That is the driver.
I told you...

498
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,062
- Shit!
- What the fuck's goin' on?

499
00:33:49,145 --> 00:33:51,314
- Walter!
- What the fuck is goin' on?

500
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:54,734
He hung up! You fucked it up!
You fucked it up!

501
00:33:54,818 --> 00:33:57,653
- Her life was in our hands.
- Easy, Dude.

502
00:33:57,736 --> 00:34:00,114
We're screwed now.
We don't get shit.

503
00:34:00,197 --> 00:34:03,158
They're gonna kill her.
We're fucked, Walter.

504
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:06,662
Nothing is fucked, Dude.
You're being very unDude.

505
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:09,081
They'll call back.
She kidnapped...

506
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,127
You see?
Nothing's fucked here, Dude.

507
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,629
They're a bunch
of fuckin' amateurs!

508
00:34:16,713 --> 00:34:19,090
Hey, will you shut the fuck up?

509
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:22,093
Don't say peep
while I'm doin' business here.

510
00:34:22,176 --> 00:34:24,511
OK, Dude, have it your way.

511
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,265
- But they're amateurs.
- Fuck.

512
00:34:29,558 --> 00:34:31,476
- Dude.
- 'OK, we proceed,

513
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,729
'but only if there's
no funny stuff.'

514
00:34:33,812 --> 00:34:35,689
Yeah, yeah.

515
00:34:35,772 --> 00:34:37,815
'So no funny stuff, OK?'

516
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:40,568
Just tell me
where the fuck to go.

517
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:46,866
That was the sign, man.

518
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:50,160
So all we gotta do
is get her back.

519
00:34:50,243 --> 00:34:53,496
No one can complain,
and we keep the baksheesh.

520
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,207
Terrific, Walter,

521
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,834
but how are we
gonna get her back?

522
00:34:57,918 --> 00:34:59,920
That's the simple part, Dude.

523
00:35:00,003 --> 00:35:03,797
We make the hand-off,
I grab one, beat it out of him.

524
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:07,176
- Huh?
- Yeah. That's a great plan.

525
00:35:07,259 --> 00:35:10,679
That's fucking ingenious,
if I understand it correctly.

526
00:35:10,763 --> 00:35:12,806
It's a Swiss fuckin' watch.

527
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,768
Yeah, the beauty
of this is its simplicity.

528
00:35:15,851 --> 00:35:18,519
If it gets complex,
everything can go wrong.

529
00:35:18,603 --> 00:35:20,688
If I learned one thing
in 'Nam, it's...

530
00:35:24,484 --> 00:35:27,070
- Dude.
- 'You're coming to a bridge.

531
00:35:27,153 --> 00:35:29,072
'When you cross the bridge,

532
00:35:29,155 --> 00:35:33,534
'you throw the bag from the left
window. You're being watched.'

533
00:35:33,617 --> 00:35:35,160
Fuck!

534
00:35:35,244 --> 00:35:37,204
What'd he say?
Where's the hand-off?

535
00:35:37,287 --> 00:35:40,749
There isn't one, we throw
the money out of the car.

536
00:35:40,832 --> 00:35:44,377
We throw the money
out of the moving car!

537
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,838
We can't do that.
That fucks up our plan.

538
00:35:47,922 --> 00:35:50,091
Call 'em and explain it to them.

539
00:35:50,174 --> 00:35:54,428
You're plan is so simple
I'm sure they'll understand.

540
00:35:54,512 --> 00:35:58,265
I'm throwin' the money, Walter.
We're not fuckin' around.

541
00:35:58,348 --> 00:36:00,642
Bridge is comin' up.
Give me the ringer.

542
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:04,229
Fuck that. I love ya,
but you have to face the fact

543
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:07,023
- you're a goddamn moron.
- No time to argue.

544
00:36:07,107 --> 00:36:08,775
- Hey, man.
- The bridge.

545
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:11,318
Hey, Walter! Hey! Walter!

546
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,612
There goes the ringer!

547
00:36:14,363 --> 00:36:16,448
- What the fuck?
- Here, your wheel.

548
00:36:16,532 --> 00:36:20,536
At 15 mph, I roll out,
grab one and beat it out of him.

549
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:22,453
- The Uzi.
- Uzi?

550
00:36:22,537 --> 00:36:24,873
- I'm not rolling out naked.
- Walter, please!

551
00:36:24,956 --> 00:36:26,833
15, Dude. This is it.

552
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,648
We have it! We have it!

553
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:56,819
We have it!

554
00:36:56,903 --> 00:36:59,030
We... have it!

555
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:14,711
Aw, fuck it, Dude.

556
00:37:14,794 --> 00:37:16,879
Let's go bowling.

557
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:58,084
Etz chaim he, Dude,
as the ex used to say.

558
00:37:58,167 --> 00:38:00,211
What the fuck does that mean?

559
00:38:00,294 --> 00:38:02,797
What the fuck
are we gonna tell Lebowski?

560
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,799
Huh? Oh, him. Uh...

561
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:09,344
Well, what exactly
is the problem?

562
00:38:09,427 --> 00:38:11,471
The problem is...

563
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,849
What do you mean, what's the...

564
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:16,142
There was no...

565
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:18,770
We... we didn't, uh...

566
00:38:18,854 --> 00:38:21,689
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

567
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:23,899
The poor woman...

568
00:38:23,983 --> 00:38:27,611
That poor slut kidnapped
herself. You said so yourself.

569
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:30,281
I said I thought
she kidnapped herself.

570
00:38:30,364 --> 00:38:33,742
- You're the one who's certain.
- 100% certain.

571
00:38:33,826 --> 00:38:36,536
- They posted the next round.
- Shut the fuck...

572
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:39,205
- When do we play?
- This Saturday.

573
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:41,374
Saturday?
They have to reschedule.

574
00:38:41,457 --> 00:38:43,126
What am I gonna tell Lebowski?

575
00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:45,712
I told that fuck
at the league office...

576
00:38:45,795 --> 00:38:48,463
- Who's in charge of scheduling?
- Burkhalter.

577
00:38:48,547 --> 00:38:51,592
I told that kraut
I don't roll on Shabbos.

578
00:38:51,675 --> 00:38:54,636
- He already posted it.
- He can fuckin' unpost it!

579
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,056
Who gives a shit?
They're gonna kill that woman.

580
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,225
What am I gonna tell Lebowski?

581
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:03,102
She'll get tired
of her game and go back.

582
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:05,688
- Why not on Saturday?
- I'm Shomer Shabbos.

583
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:07,481
What's that?

584
00:39:07,565 --> 00:39:09,525
What do I tell Lebowski?

585
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:12,320
Saturday is Shabbos,
the Jewish day of rest.

586
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:15,071
I don't work,
I don't drive a car,

587
00:39:15,155 --> 00:39:17,824
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven,

588
00:39:17,908 --> 00:39:20,076
and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

589
00:39:20,202 --> 00:39:21,953
Sheesh.

590
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:24,247
Shomer Shabbos!

591
00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:28,417
- Walter, how am I gonna...
- Shomer fucking Shabbos.

592
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,046
- That's it! I'm outta here.
- Come on, Dude.

593
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:35,966
Dude! Dude!

594
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,135
Look, you just tell him...

595
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:41,387
Tell him we made the drop
and everything went...

596
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:44,098
- How'd it go?
- Went all right.

597
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:47,519
Walter, we didn't make
the fuckin' hand-off.

598
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:50,688
They didn't get the fuckin'
money! They're gonna...

599
00:39:50,772 --> 00:39:55,442
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

600
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:58,487
If you can't go by car, how
do you get around on Shammos?

601
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,447
Really, Dude, you surprise me.

602
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,784
They're not gonna do shit.
What can they do to her?

603
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:05,244
They're amateurs, and meanwhile,

604
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:09,247
who's sittin' on a million
fucking dollars? Am I wrong?

605
00:40:09,997 --> 00:40:13,251
Who's got a million
fuckin' dollars in our car?

606
00:40:13,334 --> 00:40:15,002
Our car, Walter?

607
00:40:15,086 --> 00:40:18,840
What do they got? My dirty
undies. My fuckin' whites.

608
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:25,554
Say, Dude...

609
00:40:25,637 --> 00:40:28,557
where is your car?

610
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,392
Who's got your undies?

611
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:33,227
- Where's your car, Dude?
- You don't know?

612
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:37,523
It was parked in a handicap
zone. Perhaps they towed it.

613
00:40:38,691 --> 00:40:41,527
You fuckin' know
it's been stolen.

614
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:45,531
Well, certainly,
that's a possibility, Dude.

615
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:48,408
Oh, fuck it.

616
00:40:49,742 --> 00:40:53,371
- Where you goin', Dude?
- I'm going home, Donny.

617
00:40:53,454 --> 00:40:56,666
- Phone's ringing, Dude.
- Thank you, Donny.

618
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:12,014
Uh... yeah...

619
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:18,519
Green... uh, some brown or...

620
00:41:18,603 --> 00:41:20,980
rust coloration.

621
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:24,066
Was there anything
of value in the car?

622
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,943
Oh. Uh, yeah...

623
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:30,322
a tape deck,
some Creedence tapes,

624
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,741
and there was a... uh...

625
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,495
My briefcase.

626
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,371
In the briefcase?

627
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,709
Uh, papers.

628
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,878
You know, just papers.

629
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:49,298
You know, my papers.
Business papers.

630
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,176
And what do you do, sir?

631
00:41:53,259 --> 00:41:55,136
I'm unemployed.

632
00:41:57,931 --> 00:42:01,142
My rug was also stolen.

633
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:03,520
Your rug was in the car?

634
00:42:03,603 --> 00:42:05,521
No, here.

635
00:42:05,604 --> 00:42:07,940
Separate incidents?

636
00:42:08,857 --> 00:42:11,610
'The Dude is not in...'

637
00:42:11,693 --> 00:42:14,905
Do you find them much,
these stolen cars?

638
00:42:14,988 --> 00:42:17,699
Sometimes.

639
00:42:17,783 --> 00:42:21,619
- No hope for the tape deck.
- Or the Creedence.

640
00:42:21,702 --> 00:42:25,206
Well, what about, uh...

641
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:26,958
The briefcase?

642
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:29,794
'Mr. Lebowski,
I'd like to see you.

643
00:42:29,877 --> 00:42:33,338
'My name is Maude Lebowski.
I'm the one who took your rug.'

644
00:42:34,756 --> 00:42:38,552
Guess we can close
the file on that one.

645
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:27,471
Elfranco, ayúdame abajo.

646
00:43:27,555 --> 00:43:31,851
I'll be with you
in a moment, Mr. Lebowski.

647
00:43:50,118 --> 00:43:54,079
Does the female form make you
uncomfortable, Mr. Lebowski?

648
00:43:54,163 --> 00:43:56,290
Is that what
this is a picture of?

649
00:43:56,373 --> 00:43:57,958
In a sense, yes.

650
00:43:58,042 --> 00:44:01,545
My art is strongly vaginal,
which bothers some men.

651
00:44:01,629 --> 00:44:05,757
The word itself makes some
men uncomfortable. Vagina.

652
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,425
Oh, yeah?

653
00:44:07,509 --> 00:44:10,929
They find it difficult to say,
but without batting an eye,

654
00:44:11,012 --> 00:44:15,099
a man will refer to his dick
or his rod or his... johnson.

655
00:44:16,142 --> 00:44:18,769
- Johnson?
- All right, Mr. Lebowski.

656
00:44:18,852 --> 00:44:20,646
Let's get down to cases.

657
00:44:20,729 --> 00:44:23,106
My father agreed
to let you have the rug,

658
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,609
but it was a gift from me
to my late mother,

659
00:44:25,692 --> 00:44:27,653
and not his to give. Now...

660
00:44:27,736 --> 00:44:29,738
Your face.

661
00:44:29,822 --> 00:44:32,323
As for this kidnapping...

662
00:44:32,406 --> 00:44:36,577
I know all about it,
and that you acted as courier.

663
00:44:36,661 --> 00:44:40,873
Let me tell you something.
It stinks to high heaven.

664
00:44:40,957 --> 00:44:44,251
Right, but let me explain
something about the rug.

665
00:44:44,334 --> 00:44:47,671
- Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
- Excuse me?

666
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:49,840
Sex. The physical act of love.

667
00:44:49,923 --> 00:44:52,008
Coitus. Do you like it?

668
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:54,052
I was talking about my rug.

669
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:57,638
- You're not interested in sex?
- You mean coitus?

670
00:44:57,721 --> 00:45:01,725
I like it. It's a myth about
feminists that we hate sex.

671
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:05,813
It can be a natural, zesty
enterprise. But some people -

672
00:45:05,896 --> 00:45:08,607
satyriasis in men,
nymphomania in women -

673
00:45:08,691 --> 00:45:11,359
engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

674
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:14,779
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Lebowski.

675
00:45:14,863 --> 00:45:18,616
They cannot love
in the true sense of the word.

676
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:22,120
Our mutual acquaintance,
Bunny, is one of these.

677
00:45:22,203 --> 00:45:24,163
Listen, Maude,

678
00:45:24,246 --> 00:45:28,125
um, I'm sorry if your
stepmother is a nympho,

679
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:30,919
but what has that
to do with, uh...

680
00:45:31,003 --> 00:45:34,756
- Do you have any Kahlua?
- Take a look at this, sir.

681
00:45:37,925 --> 00:45:40,386
Oh, I know that guy.

682
00:45:41,012 --> 00:45:43,055
He's a nihilist.

683
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:46,601
Karl Hungus...

684
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:02,491
- 'Hi.
- Hello. Meine dispatcher says

685
00:46:02,574 --> 00:46:05,284
'there's something
wrong mit deine kabel.

686
00:46:05,367 --> 00:46:08,621
'Come in. I'm not sure
exactly what's wrong.

687
00:46:08,704 --> 00:46:11,415
'Zat's why they sent me.
I am an expert.

688
00:46:11,499 --> 00:46:12,500
'The TV's in here.'

689
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,919
You recognize her, of course.

690
00:46:18,922 --> 00:46:22,175
'That's my friend. She came
over to use the shower.'

691
00:46:22,258 --> 00:46:24,469
The story is ludicrous.

692
00:46:24,552 --> 00:46:27,639
'Meine name is Karl.
Ich bin expert.'

693
00:46:27,722 --> 00:46:29,598
'You're here to fix the cable.'

694
00:46:29,681 --> 00:46:33,268
You can imagine
where it goes from here.

695
00:46:33,352 --> 00:46:36,897
- He fixes the cable?
- Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

696
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,317
Little matter that she pursues
a career in pornography

697
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,652
nor that she's been
"banging" Jackie Treehorn,

698
00:46:42,735 --> 00:46:45,154
to use the parlance
of our times.

699
00:46:45,238 --> 00:46:49,116
But I am one of the two trustees
of the Lebowski Foundation,

700
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,077
the other being my father.

701
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,079
The Foundation
takes youngsters...

702
00:46:53,162 --> 00:46:54,997
Shit, yeah, the achievers.

703
00:46:55,081 --> 00:46:57,707
Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers, yes.

704
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,919
I asked my father about
his withdrawal of $1 million,

705
00:47:01,002 --> 00:47:03,672
and he told me
about this abduction.

706
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:06,716
It is preposterous.
This compulsive fornicator

707
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,176
is taking my father
for the proverbial ride.

708
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,595
- But my...
- I'm getting to your rug.

709
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:13,556
My father and I don't get along.

710
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,892
We don't approve
of each other's lifestyles.

711
00:47:16,976 --> 00:47:20,813
But I hardly wish to make his
embezzlement a police matter.

712
00:47:20,896 --> 00:47:25,233
I propose that you try
to recover the money.

713
00:47:25,316 --> 00:47:28,778
Well, I could do that.

714
00:47:28,862 --> 00:47:31,823
If you do so,
I will compensate you

715
00:47:31,906 --> 00:47:34,951
to the tune of 10%
of the recovered sum.

716
00:47:35,034 --> 00:47:36,618
A hundred...

717
00:47:36,702 --> 00:47:41,248
...thousand, yes, bones or clams
or whatever you call them.

718
00:47:41,331 --> 00:47:45,043
Yeah, but...
what about my, uh...

719
00:47:45,127 --> 00:47:48,213
Your rug. With that money
you can buy any rug

720
00:47:48,297 --> 00:47:50,965
that doesn't have
sentimental value for me.

721
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:53,050
I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

722
00:47:53,134 --> 00:47:55,803
Oh, that's fine.
That doesn't even, uh...

723
00:47:55,887 --> 00:47:58,639
Here's the number of a doctor
who will look at it.

724
00:47:58,723 --> 00:48:01,600
You'll receive no bill.
He's a good man.

725
00:48:01,683 --> 00:48:04,519
- That's thoughtful, but...
- Please see him.

726
00:48:04,603 --> 00:48:06,438
He's a good man.

727
00:48:08,315 --> 00:48:10,942
Oh, well... all right.

728
00:48:12,903 --> 00:48:14,070
He says, "My wife's a pain.

729
00:48:14,279 --> 00:48:16,363
"She's always bustin'
my friggin' agates.

730
00:48:16,405 --> 00:48:19,241
"My daughter's married
to a loser bastard,

731
00:48:19,325 --> 00:48:22,036
"and I got a rash
so bad on my ass

732
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:25,956
"I can't sit down. But you
know me, can't complain."

733
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,209
Fuckin' A, man.
I got a rash, man.

734
00:48:29,292 --> 00:48:31,044
Fuckin' A.

735
00:48:31,127 --> 00:48:33,254
I gotta tell you, man,

736
00:48:33,338 --> 00:48:36,841
earlier in the day,
I was feeling shitty, man.

737
00:48:36,925 --> 00:48:38,593
Down in the dumps.

738
00:48:38,676 --> 00:48:40,720
Lost a little money...

739
00:48:40,804 --> 00:48:44,223
Hey, you know what?
Forget about it.

740
00:48:44,306 --> 00:48:48,101
I can't be worried about
that shit. Life goes on, man.

741
00:48:48,185 --> 00:48:50,145
Home, sweet home, Mr. L.

742
00:48:53,774 --> 00:48:57,610
Look. Who's your friend
in the Volkswagen?

743
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:02,281
Yeah, he followed us here.

744
00:49:02,365 --> 00:49:05,660
When did he start foll...
What the fuck?

745
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:08,328
In the limo, you son of a bitch.
No arguing.

746
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:10,747
Careful, man.
There's a beverage here.

747
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,043
Start talking and talk fast,
you lousy bum.

748
00:49:15,127 --> 00:49:17,546
We've been trying
to reach you, Dude.

749
00:49:17,629 --> 00:49:20,465
Where's my goddamn money,
you bum?

750
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:22,424
W-well, we...

751
00:49:22,508 --> 00:49:24,260
I don't...

752
00:49:24,343 --> 00:49:27,513
They did not receive
the money, you nitwit!

753
00:49:27,596 --> 00:49:31,392
- Her life was in your hands!
- This is our concern, Dude.

754
00:49:31,475 --> 00:49:34,060
No, man, nothing is fucked here.

755
00:49:34,144 --> 00:49:36,146
- Nothing is fucked?
- No, man.

756
00:49:36,229 --> 00:49:39,440
The goddamn plane
has crashed into the mountain!

757
00:49:39,524 --> 00:49:43,319
Come on, who are you gonna
believe, those guys or...

758
00:49:43,403 --> 00:49:45,530
We dropped off the damn money.

759
00:49:45,613 --> 00:49:47,531
We?

760
00:49:47,614 --> 00:49:49,658
I.

761
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:53,454
The royal we.
You know, the editorial.

762
00:49:53,537 --> 00:49:56,248
I dropped off the money
exactly as per...

763
00:49:56,331 --> 00:49:58,750
I've got certain
information, all right?

764
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:01,544
Certain things
have come to light, and...

765
00:50:01,627 --> 00:50:04,172
Has it ever occurred to you

766
00:50:04,255 --> 00:50:08,468
that instead of,
you know, running around,

767
00:50:08,551 --> 00:50:12,305
blaming me, given the nature
of all this new shit,

768
00:50:12,388 --> 00:50:16,224
this could be a lot more...

769
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:18,310
Complex?

770
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:22,731
I mean, it might not be
such a simple, uh... you know?

771
00:50:22,814 --> 00:50:25,901
What in God's name
are you blathering about?

772
00:50:25,984 --> 00:50:29,445
I'll tell you
what I'm blathering about.

773
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:32,823
I've got information.
New shit has come to light.

774
00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:35,117
And, shit, man...

775
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,913
She kidnapped herself.

776
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:43,041
Well, sure, man.

777
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:46,127
Look at it.
A young trophy wife,

778
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:48,463
in the parlance of our times.

779
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:51,591
She owes money all over town,

780
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:54,676
including to
known pornographers.

781
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,722
And that's cool. That's cool.

782
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:01,934
I'm saying she needs money, man.

783
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,269
And... and, you know,

784
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:07,396
of course they're gonna say
they didn't get it,

785
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,566
because she wants more, man.

786
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:13,986
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

787
00:51:15,613 --> 00:51:19,408
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you, man? Sir?

788
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:25,413
No, Mr. Lebowski,
it had not occurred to me.

789
00:51:25,497 --> 00:51:28,100
That had not occurred
to us, Dude.

790
00:51:29,084 --> 00:51:32,337
You guys aren't privy
to all the new shit, so...

791
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,630
you know. But...

792
00:51:34,713 --> 00:51:38,008
Hey, that's what you pay me for.

793
00:51:39,718 --> 00:51:42,930
Speaking of which,
do you think that you could...

794
00:51:43,013 --> 00:51:45,141
give me my 20,000 in cash?

795
00:51:45,224 --> 00:51:48,726
My concern is... and I gotta
check with my accountant...

796
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:51,563
but this might bump me
into a higher tax...

797
00:51:51,646 --> 00:51:53,982
Brandt... Give him the envelope.

798
00:51:54,065 --> 00:51:58,194
Oh, if you've already got the
check made out, that's cool.

799
00:51:58,278 --> 00:52:00,779
We received this this morning.

800
00:52:02,072 --> 00:52:05,659
Since you have
failed to achieve,

801
00:52:05,742 --> 00:52:09,163
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

802
00:52:09,246 --> 00:52:12,999
since you have stolen my money,

803
00:52:13,082 --> 00:52:16,252
since you have unrepentantly
betrayed my trust...

804
00:52:16,335 --> 00:52:18,129
I have no choice

805
00:52:18,212 --> 00:52:23,217
but to tell these bums
to do whatever is necessary

806
00:52:23,301 --> 00:52:28,305
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

807
00:52:28,388 --> 00:52:31,975
With Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this:

808
00:52:32,058 --> 00:52:36,563
Any further harm
visited upon Bunny

809
00:52:36,646 --> 00:52:40,149
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

810
00:52:42,568 --> 00:52:47,698
By God, sir, I will not
abide another toe.

811
00:52:52,994 --> 00:52:55,830
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

812
00:52:55,914 --> 00:52:59,834
- Whose toe was it, Walter?
- How the fuck should I know?

813
00:52:59,918 --> 00:53:02,504
Nothing about it indicates...

814
00:53:02,587 --> 00:53:05,089
- The nail polish, Walter.
- Fine, Dude.

815
00:53:05,172 --> 00:53:09,259
You can get nail polish and
apply it to someone else's toe.

816
00:53:09,343 --> 00:53:11,345
Where the fuck
are they gonna get...

817
00:53:11,428 --> 00:53:14,431
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.

818
00:53:14,515 --> 00:53:16,683
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.

819
00:53:16,767 --> 00:53:18,935
You don't wanna know about it.

820
00:53:19,018 --> 00:53:22,897
I can get you a toe
by 3 pm, with nail polish.

821
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,983
These fuckin' amateurs.
They send us a toe,

822
00:53:26,067 --> 00:53:29,654
we're supposed to shit ourselves
with fear. Jesus Christ!

823
00:53:29,737 --> 00:53:32,823
They're gonna kill her
and then me.

824
00:53:32,906 --> 00:53:36,284
Dude... that's...

825
00:53:36,368 --> 00:53:39,287
That's just
the stress talking, man.

826
00:53:39,371 --> 00:53:41,581
We have what appears to me

827
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:44,334
to be a series
of victimless crimes.

828
00:53:44,417 --> 00:53:48,754
- What about the toe?
- Forget about the fucking toe!

829
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:52,049
Could you keep your voices down?
This is a family restaurant.

830
00:53:52,133 --> 00:53:54,385
Dear, for your information,

831
00:53:54,468 --> 00:53:57,930
the Supreme Court
has rejected prior restraint!

832
00:53:58,012 --> 00:53:59,806
This is not
a First Amendment thing.

833
00:53:59,889 --> 00:54:03,059
If you don't calm down,
you'll have to leave.

834
00:54:03,143 --> 00:54:06,438
Lady, my buddies died
face-down in the muck

835
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:09,482
so we could enjoy
this family restaurant!

836
00:54:09,566 --> 00:54:12,317
- I'm outta here.
- Dude, don't go away, man.

837
00:54:12,401 --> 00:54:14,278
This affects all of us.

838
00:54:14,361 --> 00:54:16,196
There are basic freedoms!

839
00:54:20,784 --> 00:54:23,078
I'm stayin'.

840
00:54:24,412 --> 00:54:26,414
I'm finishing my coffee.

841
00:54:31,627 --> 00:54:34,297
Enjoying my coffee.

842
00:54:49,394 --> 00:54:52,438
'The Dude is not in.

843
00:54:52,521 --> 00:54:55,483
'Leave a message after the beep.
Thanks, man.'

844
00:54:56,942 --> 00:55:00,321
'Mr. Lebowski, this is duty
officer Rolvaag of the LAPD.

845
00:55:00,404 --> 00:55:02,656
'We've recovered
your automobile.

846
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,783
'It can be claimed at...'

847
00:55:04,866 --> 00:55:07,702
Far out, man. Far fucking out!

848
00:55:17,711 --> 00:55:20,964
Hey! This is
a private residence, man.

849
00:55:29,723 --> 00:55:32,058
Ah, nice marmot.

850
00:55:40,566 --> 00:55:46,196
Vere is the money, Lebowski.
Ve vant the money, Lebowski.

851
00:55:51,034 --> 00:55:55,247
You zink ve are kidding
or making with the funny stuff?

852
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:58,082
Things you haven't
dreamed of, Lebowski.

853
00:55:58,165 --> 00:56:01,001
Ve believes in nossing,
Lebowski, nossing.

854
00:56:01,085 --> 00:56:03,963
Ve come back
and ve cut off your chonson.

855
00:56:04,046 --> 00:56:05,548
Excuse me?

856
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:08,592
I said we'll
cut off your johnson!

857
00:56:08,676 --> 00:56:10,593
Just think about that, Lebowski.

858
00:56:10,677 --> 00:56:12,595
Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.

859
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:15,473
Maybe we stomp on it
and sqoosh it, Lebowski.

860
00:56:24,898 --> 00:56:26,817
It was discovered last night

861
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,112
- lodged against an abutment.
- Oh, man, lodged where?

862
00:56:30,195 --> 00:56:33,365
You're lucky she didn't
get chopped, Mr. Lebowski.

863
00:56:33,449 --> 00:56:35,325
A joyride situation.

864
00:56:35,409 --> 00:56:38,286
They abandon the vehicle
once they hit the wall.

865
00:56:38,369 --> 00:56:41,747
My fucking briefcase!
Man, it's not here. Shit!

866
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,583
I saw the report. Sorry.

867
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,169
You gotta get in
on the other side.

868
00:56:46,252 --> 00:56:50,797
The side-view was found
on the road by the car.

869
00:56:50,881 --> 00:56:54,760
You're lucky they left the
tape deck, and the Creedence.

870
00:56:54,843 --> 00:56:58,388
Aw, Jesus!
What's that smell, man?

871
00:56:58,472 --> 00:57:01,308
Probably a vagrant
slept in the car

872
00:57:01,391 --> 00:57:03,476
or just used it as a toilet.

873
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:05,895
Hey, man...

874
00:57:05,978 --> 00:57:08,939
Are you gonna find
these guys, you know...

875
00:57:09,023 --> 00:57:12,276
I mean, you got any
promising, uh, leads or...

876
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:15,488
Leads? Yeah, sure.

877
00:57:15,571 --> 00:57:19,616
I'll just check with the boys
down at the crime lab.

878
00:57:19,699 --> 00:57:23,036
They got four more detectives
working on the case.

879
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,538
They got us working in shifts.

880
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:32,377
Leads?

881
00:57:32,461 --> 00:57:34,546
I hope the big Lebowski kills me

882
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:38,050
before the Germans
can cut my dick off.

883
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:41,929
That is just ridiculous, Dude.
No one'll cut your dick off.

884
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,931
- Thank you.
- Not if I have anything to say.

885
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:47,600
- That makes me feel secure.
- Dude.

886
00:57:47,683 --> 00:57:50,520
- It makes me feel warm inside.
- Now, Dude.

887
00:57:50,603 --> 00:57:52,855
This whole fuckin' thing.

888
00:57:52,939 --> 00:57:57,400
I could be sitting here
with just pee stains on my rug.

889
00:57:57,484 --> 00:58:00,445
- But, no, man, I gotta...
- Fucking Germans.

890
00:58:00,529 --> 00:58:03,573
Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.

891
00:58:03,657 --> 00:58:05,992
They were Nazis, Dude?

892
00:58:06,076 --> 00:58:09,203
Come on, Donny, they
were threatening castration.

893
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:11,330
- Are we gonna split hairs?
- No.

894
00:58:11,414 --> 00:58:13,416
- Am I wrong?
- Well, he...

895
00:58:13,499 --> 00:58:15,167
They were nihilists, man.

896
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:17,711
They kept saying
they believed in nothing.

897
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:20,464
Nihilists.

898
00:58:20,548 --> 00:58:23,049
Fuck me.

899
00:58:23,758 --> 00:58:27,595
Say what you want about the
tenets of national socialism,

900
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:29,889
at least it's an ethos.

901
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:32,725
And also,
let's not forget, Dude,

902
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:36,270
that keeping wildlife,
an amphibious rodent

903
00:58:36,353 --> 00:58:39,022
for, you know, domestic...

904
00:58:39,106 --> 00:58:41,066
within the city...

905
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,110
That ain't legal either.

906
00:58:43,193 --> 00:58:46,447
- Are you a fucking park ranger?
- No, I'm just...

907
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:49,574
Who gives a shit
about the fucking marmot?

908
00:58:49,657 --> 00:58:52,910
- We are sympathizing, Dude.
- Fuck sympathy.

909
00:58:52,994 --> 00:58:57,039
I don't need your fucking
sympathy. I need my johnson.

910
00:58:57,123 --> 00:59:00,501
- What do you need that for?
- You've got to buck up!

911
00:59:00,585 --> 00:59:04,045
You cannot drag this negative
energy into the tournament.

912
00:59:04,129 --> 00:59:07,215
Fuck the tournament.
Fuck you, Walter.

913
00:59:07,299 --> 00:59:10,260
Fuck the tournament?

914
00:59:10,343 --> 00:59:14,222
OK, Dude. I can see you
don't want to be cheered up.

915
00:59:14,306 --> 00:59:17,641
Come on, Donny.
Let's go get us a lane.

916
00:59:21,228 --> 00:59:24,565
- Another Caucasian, Gary.
- Right, Dude.

917
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:28,818
Friends like these,
huh, Gary?

918
00:59:28,902 --> 00:59:30,987
That's right, Dude.

919
00:59:52,091 --> 00:59:56,177
Do you have a good Sarsaparilla?

920
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,262
Sioux City Sarsaparilla?

921
00:59:58,346 --> 01:00:00,848
Yeah. That's a good one.

922
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:04,894
How you doin' there, Dude?

923
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:07,896
Not too good, man.

924
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:11,817
- One of those days, huh?
- Yeah.

925
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,527
Well...

926
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,488
A wiser fella than myself
once said,

927
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:19,866
"Sometimes you eat
the bar and..."

928
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,159
Much obliged.

929
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:24,787
"And sometimes the bar, well...

930
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,664
"he eats you."

931
01:00:26,747 --> 01:00:30,084
That some kind of Eastern thing?

932
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,962
Far from it.

933
01:00:38,633 --> 01:00:41,094
I like your style, Dude.

934
01:00:41,177 --> 01:00:43,555
Hmm. Well...

935
01:00:43,638 --> 01:00:45,974
I dig your style, too, man.

936
01:00:46,057 --> 01:00:48,559
You got
a whole cowboy thing going.

937
01:00:51,979 --> 01:00:53,772
Thankee.

938
01:00:53,856 --> 01:00:57,735
- There's just one thing, Dude.
- What's that?

939
01:00:57,818 --> 01:01:01,195
Do you have to use
so many cuss words?

940
01:01:02,989 --> 01:01:05,616
What the fuck
are you talking about?

941
01:01:07,827 --> 01:01:10,955
OK, Dude, have it your way.

942
01:01:12,206 --> 01:01:14,708
Take her easy, Dude.

943
01:01:14,791 --> 01:01:17,210
Yeah. Thanks, man.

944
01:01:22,299 --> 01:01:24,634
Call for you, Dude.

945
01:01:28,053 --> 01:01:29,346
Hello?

946
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:32,475
'Jeffrey, you have
not gone to the doctor.'

947
01:01:32,558 --> 01:01:35,770
Uh, oh, yeah.
No... no, I haven't yet.

948
01:01:35,853 --> 01:01:38,439
'I'd like to
see you immediately.'

949
01:01:38,522 --> 01:01:40,148
Oh?

950
01:01:51,159 --> 01:01:55,788
- So you're Lebowski.
- Yeah.

951
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:00,459
Maude has told me all about you.

952
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:03,712
She'll be back
in a minute. Sit down.

953
01:02:03,796 --> 01:02:07,173
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, sure. White Russian.

954
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:09,801
The bar's over there.

955
01:02:14,055 --> 01:02:18,309
- So what do you do, Lebowski?
- Who the fuck are you, man?

956
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,937
Just a friend of Maudie's.

957
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:24,147
The friend
with the cleft asshole?

958
01:02:26,316 --> 01:02:28,860
What do you do?

959
01:02:28,944 --> 01:02:30,987
Oh, nothing much.

960
01:02:31,071 --> 01:02:33,114
Hello, Jeffrey.

961
01:02:33,197 --> 01:02:36,492
Yeah, how are you?
Listen, Maude,

962
01:02:36,575 --> 01:02:39,161
I got to, uh...

963
01:02:40,538 --> 01:02:42,623
tender my resignation
or whatever.

964
01:02:42,706 --> 01:02:47,961
It looks like your mother
really was kidnapped after all.

965
01:02:48,044 --> 01:02:49,838
She most certainly was not.

966
01:02:49,921 --> 01:02:53,007
Hey, man,
why don't you fucking...

967
01:02:53,091 --> 01:02:56,302
listen occasionally?
You might learn something.

968
01:02:56,386 --> 01:02:59,263
- Now, I got...
- Don't call her my mother.

969
01:03:00,848 --> 01:03:03,058
She's the perpetrator
and not the victim.

970
01:03:03,142 --> 01:03:06,019
I got pretty
definitive evidence...

971
01:03:06,103 --> 01:03:09,064
- From who?
- From the main guy, Uli.

972
01:03:09,148 --> 01:03:12,192
Uli Kunkel? Her co-star
in the beaver picture?

973
01:03:12,276 --> 01:03:15,069
Beaver? You mean vagina...

974
01:03:15,153 --> 01:03:17,488
I mean, you know the guy?

975
01:03:17,572 --> 01:03:20,575
I might have introduced them
for all I know.

976
01:03:20,658 --> 01:03:22,660
Do you remember Uli?

977
01:03:22,744 --> 01:03:26,163
He's a musician.
Used to have a group, Autobahn.

978
01:03:26,246 --> 01:03:29,541
They released
one album in the late 70s.

979
01:03:29,624 --> 01:03:32,794
Their music is
sort of a... technopop.

980
01:03:32,878 --> 01:03:35,297
So he's pretending
to be the abductor?

981
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,591
- Well, yeah.
- Look, Jeffrey,

982
01:03:37,674 --> 01:03:40,342
you don't kidnap someone
you're acquainted with.

983
01:03:40,426 --> 01:03:42,970
The idea is that the hostage
can't identify you

984
01:03:43,054 --> 01:03:45,598
- after you've let them go.
- I know that.

985
01:03:50,144 --> 01:03:53,313
What the fuck
is with this guy? Who is he?

986
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:56,941
Knox Harrington.
The video artist.

987
01:03:57,025 --> 01:04:00,653
- So Uli has the money?
- Well...

988
01:04:00,737 --> 01:04:03,198
No, not exactly...

989
01:04:03,281 --> 01:04:06,075
This is a very
complicated case, Maude.

990
01:04:06,158 --> 01:04:09,787
A lot of ins and outs
and what-have-yous...

991
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:12,956
A lot of strands
to keep in my head.

992
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,417
A lot of strands
in old Duder's head.

993
01:04:15,501 --> 01:04:16,960
Then who has the money?

994
01:04:17,044 --> 01:04:19,921
It's Sandra, about the Biennale.

995
01:04:20,004 --> 01:04:23,508
I have to take this. Do you
have that doctor's number?

996
01:04:23,591 --> 01:04:27,053
- It's not bruised any more.
- Please, Jeffrey,

997
01:04:27,136 --> 01:04:30,890
I don't want to be responsible
for any delayed after-effects.

998
01:04:32,808 --> 01:04:34,726
After-effects?

999
01:05:03,837 --> 01:05:07,257
Could you slide your shorts
down, Mr. Lebowski, please?

1000
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:10,176
No, man. She hit me right here.

1001
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,010
I understand.

1002
01:05:12,094 --> 01:05:15,764
Could you slide
your shorts down, please?

1003
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,573
He lives in North Hollywood,

1004
01:07:48,656 --> 01:07:50,741
on Radford,
near the In 'n' Out Burger.

1005
01:07:50,824 --> 01:07:52,659
The In 'n' Out Burger's
on Camrose.

1006
01:07:52,743 --> 01:07:54,995
- Near it.
- Those are good burgers.

1007
01:07:55,078 --> 01:07:56,913
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

1008
01:07:56,997 --> 01:07:59,958
The kid's in ninth grade,
and his father...

1009
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:04,128
Are you ready for this? His
father is Arthur Digby Sellers.

1010
01:08:04,211 --> 01:08:06,047
Who the fuck is that?

1011
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:08,674
Who the fuck is
Arthur Digby Sellers?

1012
01:08:08,758 --> 01:08:12,011
Ever heard of a show
called "Branded"?

1013
01:08:12,094 --> 01:08:15,389
"All but one man died
there at Bitter Creek"?

1014
01:08:15,473 --> 01:08:17,599
I know the fucking show.
So what?

1015
01:08:17,682 --> 01:08:21,561
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers
wrote 156 episodes, Dude.

1016
01:08:21,644 --> 01:08:24,272
The bulk of the series.

1017
01:08:24,355 --> 01:08:26,900
- Not exactly a lightweight.
- No.

1018
01:08:26,983 --> 01:08:30,569
And yet his son
is a fucking dunce.

1019
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:33,072
We'll go there
after the what-have-you,

1020
01:08:33,155 --> 01:08:35,032
we'll brace the kid.

1021
01:08:35,115 --> 01:08:37,117
We'll be near
the In 'n' Out Burger.

1022
01:08:37,201 --> 01:08:39,661
Shut the fuck up, Donny!

1023
01:08:39,745 --> 01:08:43,581
We'll brace the kid.
He should be a pushover.

1024
01:08:43,664 --> 01:08:45,875
We'll get that fucking
$1 million back...

1025
01:08:45,958 --> 01:08:47,919
If he hasn't spent it already.

1026
01:08:48,002 --> 01:08:49,962
A million fucking clams.

1027
01:08:50,046 --> 01:08:53,383
- Yes, we'll be near the, uh...
- In 'n' Out.

1028
01:08:55,134 --> 01:08:58,178
Some burgers, some beers,
a few laughs.

1029
01:08:59,262 --> 01:09:03,392
Our fucking troubles
are over, Dude.

1030
01:09:14,235 --> 01:09:17,446
Oh, fuck me, man!

1031
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:20,658
That kid's already spent
all the money, man!

1032
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:23,243
New 'vette? Hardly, Dude.

1033
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:26,955
I'd say he still has
960, $970,000 left,

1034
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:30,291
depending on the options.
Wait in the car, Donny.

1035
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:36,213
- Yes?
- Pilar?

1036
01:09:37,047 --> 01:09:38,966
My name is Walter Sobchak.

1037
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:42,094
This is my associate
Jeffrey Lebowski.

1038
01:09:42,177 --> 01:09:46,140
We came to talk about
little Larry. May we come in?

1039
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,391
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.

1040
01:09:52,729 --> 01:09:55,148
That's him, Dude.

1041
01:10:02,195 --> 01:10:05,115
And a good day to you, sir!

1042
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:07,576
Sit down, please.

1043
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:14,874
Larry, sweetie,
that man is here!

1044
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:18,377
Is he... Does he still write?

1045
01:10:18,461 --> 01:10:21,547
Oh, no, no.
He has health problems.

1046
01:10:24,175 --> 01:10:27,636
Sir, I just want to say

1047
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,181
that we're both,
on a personal level,

1048
01:10:31,264 --> 01:10:33,266
really enormous fans.

1049
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:36,394
"Branded", especially
the early episodes,

1050
01:10:36,478 --> 01:10:38,897
was truly a source
of inspiration...

1051
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:41,565
Sweetie, sit down!
This is the police.

1052
01:10:41,648 --> 01:10:45,235
Oh, no, ma'am,
we are not exactly the police.

1053
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:47,821
We hope it won't
be necessary to call the police.

1054
01:10:47,905 --> 01:10:50,574
But that's up
to little Larry here.

1055
01:10:50,657 --> 01:10:52,993
Isn't it, Larry?

1056
01:11:02,919 --> 01:11:05,004
Is this your homework, Larry?

1057
01:11:07,506 --> 01:11:09,549
- Is this your homework?
- Look, man...

1058
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:13,011
Dude, please.
Is this your homework, Larry?

1059
01:11:13,095 --> 01:11:14,888
Just ask him about the car.

1060
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:18,058
- Is this your homework, Larry?
- Is that your car out front?

1061
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:21,352
- Is this your homework, Larry?
- We know it's his homework!

1062
01:11:21,435 --> 01:11:23,020
Where's the fucking money?

1063
01:11:23,104 --> 01:11:25,147
Look, Larry...

1064
01:11:25,231 --> 01:11:26,899
Have you heard of Vietnam?

1065
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:29,985
You're entering
a world of pain, son.

1066
01:11:30,069 --> 01:11:32,029
We know that you stole the car.

1067
01:11:32,113 --> 01:11:34,155
- And the fucking money!
- And the fucking money.

1068
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,366
We know that this
is your homework.

1069
01:11:36,449 --> 01:11:39,452
- We'll cut your dick off.
- You're killing your father.

1070
01:11:41,996 --> 01:11:44,874
All right. This is pointless.

1071
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:47,835
OK? It's time for plan B.

1072
01:11:50,379 --> 01:11:54,258
You might want to watch out
that front window, Larry.

1073
01:11:54,341 --> 01:11:56,176
Son, this is what happens

1074
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:58,512
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass!

1075
01:11:59,888 --> 01:12:01,848
Little language problem here.

1076
01:12:01,931 --> 01:12:05,309
The little prick's
stonewalling me.

1077
01:12:05,393 --> 01:12:07,145
Walter!

1078
01:12:07,228 --> 01:12:09,230
What... what are you doing, man?

1079
01:12:11,899 --> 01:12:13,483
What are you doing?

1080
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:18,613
Here you go, Larry.
You see what happens?

1081
01:12:18,697 --> 01:12:21,241
You see what happens, Larry?

1082
01:12:23,618 --> 01:12:25,454
This is what happens

1083
01:12:25,537 --> 01:12:28,748
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass, Larry!

1084
01:12:29,832 --> 01:12:31,709
This is what happens, Larry!

1085
01:12:31,792 --> 01:12:34,086
You see what happens, Larry,

1086
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:36,672
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

1087
01:12:36,756 --> 01:12:38,341
This is what happens.

1088
01:12:38,424 --> 01:12:40,216
You see what happens, Larry?

1089
01:12:41,593 --> 01:12:43,511
You see what happens, Larry?

1090
01:12:43,595 --> 01:12:45,263
Do you see what happens, Larry,

1091
01:12:45,347 --> 01:12:47,640
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

1092
01:12:48,808 --> 01:12:52,062
This is what happens, Larry!
This is what happens, Larry!

1093
01:12:52,145 --> 01:12:54,396
- No!
- This is what happens, Larry!

1094
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,191
This is what happens
when you fuck a stranger...

1095
01:12:57,274 --> 01:12:59,526
What the fuck
are you doing? Stop it!

1096
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:02,154
I just bought
that fucking car last week!

1097
01:13:02,237 --> 01:13:05,366
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

1098
01:13:05,449 --> 01:13:07,825
I just bought
the fucking car last week!

1099
01:13:07,909 --> 01:13:10,495
I'll kill your
fucking car, man!

1100
01:13:10,578 --> 01:13:12,288
No! That's not his... hey!

1101
01:13:12,372 --> 01:13:15,166
- God damn it!
- No! Oh, no!

1102
01:13:15,249 --> 01:13:18,211
Fuck you! You like that?

1103
01:13:18,294 --> 01:13:21,463
Fuck you!
I kill your fucking car!

1104
01:13:21,546 --> 01:13:24,883
I kill your fucking car!

1105
01:13:44,944 --> 01:13:47,112
I accept your apology.

1106
01:13:49,239 --> 01:13:53,118
No. I just... want to
handle it by myself from now on.

1107
01:13:53,201 --> 01:13:55,578
No, no, no.

1108
01:13:55,662 --> 01:13:58,415
That has nothing to do with it.

1109
01:13:58,498 --> 01:14:01,041
Yes, the car made it home.

1110
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:03,544
You're calling me at home.

1111
01:14:03,627 --> 01:14:09,258
No, Walter, it did not look
like Larry was about to crack.

1112
01:14:10,884 --> 01:14:13,302
Well, that's your perception.

1113
01:14:14,512 --> 01:14:17,140
You know, Walter, you're right.

1114
01:14:17,223 --> 01:14:20,226
There is an unspoken message
here. It's "Fuck you"!

1115
01:14:20,309 --> 01:14:22,437
Leave me the fuck alone!

1116
01:14:24,647 --> 01:14:27,024
Yeah, I'll be at practice.

1117
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:48,085
Pin your diapers on. Jackie
Treehorn wants to see you.

1118
01:14:48,169 --> 01:14:51,255
Jackie Treehorn knows
which Lebowski you are.

1119
01:14:51,339 --> 01:14:54,007
Jackie Treehorn wants to see
the deadbeat Lebowski.

1120
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:55,967
You're not dealing with morons.

1121
01:15:43,512 --> 01:15:46,681
Hello, Dude. Thanks for coming.

1122
01:15:46,764 --> 01:15:48,849
I'm Jackie Treehorn.

1123
01:15:51,143 --> 01:15:54,271
This is quite a pad
you got here, man.

1124
01:15:54,355 --> 01:15:56,774
Completely unspoiled.

1125
01:15:56,857 --> 01:15:59,984
- What's your drink, Dude?
- White Russian. Thanks.

1126
01:16:00,068 --> 01:16:01,986
White Russian.

1127
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:04,572
How's the smut business, Jackie?

1128
01:16:04,656 --> 01:16:06,366
I wouldn't know, Dude.

1129
01:16:06,449 --> 01:16:09,202
I deal in publishing,

1130
01:16:09,285 --> 01:16:11,495
entertainment,
political advocacy.

1131
01:16:11,578 --> 01:16:15,207
- Oh. Which one's "Logjammin'"?
- Yes, regrettably, it's true.

1132
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:18,377
Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.

1133
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,337
It's video, Dude.

1134
01:16:20,421 --> 01:16:22,965
Now that we're
competing with amateurs,

1135
01:16:23,048 --> 01:16:25,883
we can't afford to invest
in extras, like story,

1136
01:16:25,967 --> 01:16:28,261
production value,

1137
01:16:28,344 --> 01:16:30,430
feelings.

1138
01:16:31,389 --> 01:16:33,599
You know, people forget

1139
01:16:33,683 --> 01:16:37,395
that the brain is
the biggest erogenous zone.

1140
01:16:37,477 --> 01:16:39,479
On you maybe.

1141
01:16:39,563 --> 01:16:41,648
You have to take
the good with the bad.

1142
01:16:41,732 --> 01:16:44,651
New technology permits us
to do exciting things

1143
01:16:44,735 --> 01:16:48,989
in interactive erotic software.
Wave of the future, Dude.

1144
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:51,532
100% electronic.

1145
01:16:51,615 --> 01:16:55,328
Well...
I still jerk off manually.

1146
01:16:56,704 --> 01:16:58,205
Of course you do.

1147
01:16:58,289 --> 01:17:01,876
I can see you're anxious
for me to get to the point.

1148
01:17:01,959 --> 01:17:03,753
Well, here it is, Dude.

1149
01:17:03,836 --> 01:17:05,795
Where's Bunny?

1150
01:17:05,879 --> 01:17:09,132
- I thought you might know that.
- Why would I?

1151
01:17:09,215 --> 01:17:13,178
She ran off to get away from
that sizable debt to me.

1152
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:15,889
She didn't run off.
She's been...

1153
01:17:15,972 --> 01:17:17,848
I've heard that story.

1154
01:17:17,931 --> 01:17:21,268
I know you're
mixed up in this, Dude.

1155
01:17:21,352 --> 01:17:24,938
I don't care what you're
trying to get from the husband.

1156
01:17:25,022 --> 01:17:26,815
That's your business.

1157
01:17:26,899 --> 01:17:28,901
All I'm saying is...

1158
01:17:28,984 --> 01:17:31,319
- I want mine.
- Yeah, right, man.

1159
01:17:31,402 --> 01:17:34,155
There are a lot of...
facets to this,

1160
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:37,116
a lot of interested parties.

1161
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,827
Excuse me.

1162
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,625
Yeah?

1163
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:48,085
Oh, yeah.

1164
01:17:48,168 --> 01:17:49,753
Where's that?

1165
01:17:52,673 --> 01:17:54,591
All right.

1166
01:17:58,177 --> 01:17:59,970
Excuse me.

1167
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:38,506
- Forgive me.
- No problemo, man.

1168
01:18:38,589 --> 01:18:40,633
So, uh...

1169
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:43,803
If I, uh, can find your money...

1170
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:47,473
What's in it for the Dude?

1171
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:50,142
Of course, there's that
to discuss. Refill?

1172
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:52,060
The Pope shit in the woods?

1173
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,771
10% finder's fee.
That all right?

1174
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:57,524
OK. Done, Jackie.

1175
01:18:57,607 --> 01:18:59,985
I dig the way
you do business, man.

1176
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:04,363
Your money is being held
by a kid named Larry Sellers.

1177
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:07,491
He lives in North Hollywood,
on Radford, uh...

1178
01:19:07,575 --> 01:19:10,369
by the In 'n' Out Burger.

1179
01:19:10,453 --> 01:19:12,705
A fuckin' brat,

1180
01:19:12,788 --> 01:19:14,707
but I'm sure
you can get it off him.

1181
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:17,334
I mean, he's 15.

1182
01:19:18,335 --> 01:19:20,795
Flunking social studies.

1183
01:19:23,923 --> 01:19:26,259
So, if you could just, uh...

1184
01:19:26,343 --> 01:19:31,263
write me a check
for my 10% of half a million...

1185
01:19:31,347 --> 01:19:34,266
five grand...
I'll go out and mingle.

1186
01:19:38,771 --> 01:19:42,273
You mix a hell
of a Caucasian, Jackie.

1187
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,651
A 15-year-old kid.

1188
01:19:45,568 --> 01:19:48,321
Is this some sort of a joke?

1189
01:19:48,404 --> 01:19:50,406
No, no joke.

1190
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:54,160
No funny stuff, Jackie.
The kid's got it.

1191
01:19:54,243 --> 01:19:56,411
Hi, fellas.

1192
01:19:57,871 --> 01:20:00,248
The kid just wanted a car.

1193
01:20:03,085 --> 01:20:07,047
All the Dude ever wanted
was his rug back.

1194
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:08,465
I'm not greedy.

1195
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:12,927
It really...

1196
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,720
tied the room together.

1197
01:20:17,682 --> 01:20:21,352
Darkness washed over the Dude.

1198
01:20:21,435 --> 01:20:24,062
Darker than
a black steer's tookus

1199
01:20:24,145 --> 01:20:27,315
on a moonless prairie night.

1200
01:20:27,607 --> 01:20:29,234
There was no bottom.

1201
01:24:21,949 --> 01:24:23,867
Branded!

1202
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:40,299
Is this your only I. D?

1203
01:24:40,383 --> 01:24:42,635
I know my rights, man.

1204
01:24:45,137 --> 01:24:49,265
- You don't know shit, Lebowski.
- I want a fucking lawyer, man.

1205
01:24:49,349 --> 01:24:53,395
I want... Bill Kunstler, man...

1206
01:24:54,562 --> 01:24:56,272
or Ron Coobie.

1207
01:24:56,356 --> 01:24:58,108
Mr. Treehorn tells us

1208
01:24:58,191 --> 01:25:02,361
that he had to eject you
from his garden party,

1209
01:25:02,444 --> 01:25:04,446
that you were drunk
and abusive.

1210
01:25:04,530 --> 01:25:09,785
Mr. Treehorn treats objects
like women, man.

1211
01:25:09,868 --> 01:25:13,079
Mr. Treehorn draws
a lot of water in this town.

1212
01:25:13,162 --> 01:25:15,498
You don't draw shit, Lebowski.

1213
01:25:15,581 --> 01:25:18,918
We got a nice quiet
little beach community here,

1214
01:25:19,002 --> 01:25:21,337
and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.

1215
01:25:21,421 --> 01:25:23,506
So let me make something plain.

1216
01:25:23,589 --> 01:25:26,133
I don't like you sucking around,

1217
01:25:26,216 --> 01:25:28,218
bothering our citizens,
Lebowski.

1218
01:25:28,302 --> 01:25:30,804
I don't like your jerk-off name,

1219
01:25:30,887 --> 01:25:32,681
I don't like your jerk-off face,

1220
01:25:32,764 --> 01:25:35,225
I don't like
your jerk-off behavior,

1221
01:25:35,309 --> 01:25:38,437
and I don't like you... Jerk-off.

1222
01:25:40,855 --> 01:25:42,940
Do I make myself clear?

1223
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:48,237
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

1224
01:25:50,823 --> 01:25:52,866
Fucking fascist!

1225
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:56,786
Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

1226
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:59,247
Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!

1227
01:26:00,874 --> 01:26:05,044
Keep your ugly goldbricking ass
out of my beach community.

1228
01:26:17,348 --> 01:26:20,975
Jesus... Man, could you
change the channel.

1229
01:26:21,059 --> 01:26:24,562
If you don't like my music,
get your own fucking cab!

1230
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:27,148
I'll pull over
and kick your ass out.

1231
01:26:27,231 --> 01:26:30,985
I had a rough night,
and I hate the fucking Eagles.

1232
01:26:39,409 --> 01:26:41,912
Out of my fucking cab!
Out! Get...

1233
01:26:41,995 --> 01:26:44,164
Hey... man!

1234
01:26:44,247 --> 01:26:46,415
Man, hey!

1235
01:27:28,246 --> 01:27:31,541
Oh... Jesus.

1236
01:27:49,725 --> 01:27:51,684
Jeffrey.

1237
01:27:52,727 --> 01:27:54,228
Maude?

1238
01:27:54,312 --> 01:27:56,272
Love me.

1239
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:59,567
Uh, that's my robe.

1240
01:28:00,735 --> 01:28:03,903
Tell me about yourself, Jeffrey.

1241
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:06,364
Well, not much to tell.

1242
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:11,411
I, um, I was one of the authors

1243
01:28:11,494 --> 01:28:13,705
of the Port Huron statement.

1244
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,749
The original
Port Huron statement.

1245
01:28:17,958 --> 01:28:21,837
Not the compromised
second draft.

1246
01:28:22,296 --> 01:28:24,757
Uh, and then I, uh,

1247
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,967
you ever hear of the Seattle 7?

1248
01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:30,511
That was me.

1249
01:28:30,595 --> 01:28:35,391
And, um, the six other guys.

1250
01:28:35,475 --> 01:28:39,520
Um... and then,
ah, music business briefly.

1251
01:28:41,356 --> 01:28:44,066
- Yeah, a roadie for Metallica.
- Oh.

1252
01:28:44,149 --> 01:28:47,945
- "Speed of Sound" tour.
- Mm-hmm.

1253
01:28:48,028 --> 01:28:50,489
Bunch of assholes.

1254
01:28:50,572 --> 01:28:53,241
Uh, and then, you know,

1255
01:28:53,325 --> 01:28:55,452
a little of this,
a little of that.

1256
01:28:55,535 --> 01:28:58,955
My career's slowed down
a little lately.

1257
01:28:59,038 --> 01:29:03,292
What do you do for recreation?

1258
01:29:03,376 --> 01:29:08,673
Oh, the usual.
Bowl, drive around.

1259
01:29:08,756 --> 01:29:11,800
The occasional acid flashback.

1260
01:29:17,389 --> 01:29:20,183
What happened to your house?

1261
01:29:20,267 --> 01:29:22,352
Oh, Jackie Treehorn
trashed the place.

1262
01:29:22,435 --> 01:29:25,187
He thought I had
your father's money.

1263
01:29:25,271 --> 01:29:28,107
He got me out of the way
while he looked for it.

1264
01:29:28,190 --> 01:29:30,776
- Cocktail?
- No, thanks.

1265
01:29:30,859 --> 01:29:34,029
It's not my father's money.
It's the Foundation's.

1266
01:29:34,113 --> 01:29:37,740
Why did he think you have it?
And who does?

1267
01:29:37,824 --> 01:29:40,410
Larry Sellers,
this high school kid.

1268
01:29:40,493 --> 01:29:42,078
Real fucking brat.

1269
01:29:42,161 --> 01:29:46,332
You know, this is a very
complicated case, Maude.

1270
01:29:46,416 --> 01:29:49,459
Lotta ins, lotta outs.
You know, fortunately,

1271
01:29:49,543 --> 01:29:52,045
I'm adhering
to a pretty strict...

1272
01:29:52,129 --> 01:29:55,299
drug regiment to keep
my mind, you know,

1273
01:29:55,382 --> 01:29:57,175
uh, limber, you know.

1274
01:29:57,259 --> 01:29:59,303
Very close
to your father's money.

1275
01:29:59,386 --> 01:30:03,264
It's the Foundation's money.
Father doesn't have any.

1276
01:30:05,141 --> 01:30:07,810
What are you talking about?
He's loaded.

1277
01:30:07,893 --> 01:30:10,646
No, no, the wealth
was all mother's.

1278
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:12,940
No, he runs stuff, uh...

1279
01:30:13,024 --> 01:30:16,443
We did let him run a company,
but he didn't do very well.

1280
01:30:16,526 --> 01:30:19,529
- No, he's...
- He administers the charities,

1281
01:30:19,613 --> 01:30:22,657
and I give him
a reasonable allowance.

1282
01:30:22,741 --> 01:30:24,659
He has no money of his own.

1283
01:30:24,743 --> 01:30:28,204
I know how he presents himself.
Father's weakness is vanity.

1284
01:30:28,288 --> 01:30:33,918
- Hence, the slut.
- Uh, do you think he, uh...

1285
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:37,296
What is that, yoga?

1286
01:30:37,379 --> 01:30:39,882
It increases
the chances of conception.

1287
01:30:41,508 --> 01:30:43,760
- Increases?
- Well, yes.

1288
01:30:43,843 --> 01:30:47,013
What did you think this
was about? Fun and games?

1289
01:30:47,096 --> 01:30:49,515
I want a child.

1290
01:30:49,599 --> 01:30:51,893
OK, yeah, OK, but let me...

1291
01:30:51,976 --> 01:30:55,355
Let me explain
something about the Dude.

1292
01:30:55,437 --> 01:30:58,231
Look, Jeffrey,
I don't want a partner.

1293
01:30:58,315 --> 01:31:02,235
I don't want the father
to be someone I have to see,

1294
01:31:02,319 --> 01:31:06,323
or who has any interest
in raising the child himself.

1295
01:31:06,406 --> 01:31:09,325
Oh, so that doctor...

1296
01:31:09,408 --> 01:31:11,410
Exactly.

1297
01:31:11,494 --> 01:31:13,663
Now, what happened to your face?

1298
01:31:13,746 --> 01:31:16,499
Did Jackie Treehorn
do that as well?

1299
01:31:16,582 --> 01:31:20,461
No, uh, it was
the Chief of Police of Malibu.

1300
01:31:20,544 --> 01:31:24,130
A real reactionary.
So, your father...

1301
01:31:25,799 --> 01:31:29,010
- Yeah, I get it. Yeah, yeah.
- What?

1302
01:31:29,094 --> 01:31:31,471
Oh, man, my thinking
about this case

1303
01:31:31,554 --> 01:31:35,432
had become very uptight.
Yeah, your father.

1304
01:31:37,268 --> 01:31:39,853
Jeffrey,
what are you talking about?

1305
01:31:41,522 --> 01:31:43,065
Jeffrey!

1306
01:31:43,148 --> 01:31:45,234
Walter, if you're there,

1307
01:31:45,317 --> 01:31:47,695
pick up the fucking phone.
Come on.

1308
01:31:47,778 --> 01:31:50,488
Pick it up, man,
this is an emergency.

1309
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:51,948
'Dude?'

1310
01:31:52,031 --> 01:31:55,827
I'm at my place. I need you
to come and pick me up.

1311
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:58,413
'I can't drive, Dude,
it's Erev Shabbos.'

1312
01:31:58,496 --> 01:32:00,248
- What?
- 'Erev Shabbos.'

1313
01:32:00,331 --> 01:32:02,666
- 'I can't drive.'
- Man!

1314
01:32:02,749 --> 01:32:05,419
'I'm not supposed
to pick up the phone

1315
01:32:05,502 --> 01:32:08,255
- 'unless it's an emergency.'
- This is a fucking emergency!

1316
01:32:08,338 --> 01:32:10,799
'That's why
I picked up the phone.'

1317
01:32:10,882 --> 01:32:14,011
Walter, you fuck,
we gotta go to Pasadena.

1318
01:32:14,094 --> 01:32:16,262
Pick me up
or I'm off the bowling team.

1319
01:32:32,652 --> 01:32:35,488
Get out of that
fucking car, man.

1320
01:32:35,572 --> 01:32:38,283
Get out of that fucking car!

1321
01:32:38,366 --> 01:32:40,869
Get the fuck out
of the car, man.

1322
01:32:42,328 --> 01:32:44,538
Get out of the fucking...

1323
01:32:44,622 --> 01:32:46,665
Who the fuck are you, man?

1324
01:32:46,749 --> 01:32:50,628
Easy, man. Relax, man.
No physical harm intended.

1325
01:32:50,711 --> 01:32:53,756
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me around?

1326
01:32:53,839 --> 01:32:55,089
Come on, fuckhead.

1327
01:32:55,173 --> 01:32:57,383
Relax, man.
I'm a brother Seamus.

1328
01:32:57,467 --> 01:32:59,761
Brother Seamus?

1329
01:32:59,844 --> 01:33:02,388
Like an Irish monk?

1330
01:33:02,472 --> 01:33:05,141
What the fuck are you
talking about?

1331
01:33:05,224 --> 01:33:08,977
My name is Da Fino. I'm a
private snoop, like you, man.

1332
01:33:09,061 --> 01:33:11,939
- What?
- A dick, man.

1333
01:33:12,022 --> 01:33:15,400
Let me tell you something.
I dig your work.

1334
01:33:15,484 --> 01:33:17,444
Playing one side
against the other.

1335
01:33:17,527 --> 01:33:19,988
In bed with everybody.
Fabulous stuff.

1336
01:33:20,072 --> 01:33:21,530
I'm not! Fuck it.

1337
01:33:21,614 --> 01:33:24,367
Just stay away
from my lady friend.

1338
01:33:24,450 --> 01:33:26,953
I'm not messing
with your special lady.

1339
01:33:27,036 --> 01:33:28,913
She's not my special lady.

1340
01:33:28,996 --> 01:33:31,082
I'm just helping her conceive.

1341
01:33:31,165 --> 01:33:33,584
- I'm not...
- Who are you working for?

1342
01:33:33,668 --> 01:33:37,087
Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?

1343
01:33:37,212 --> 01:33:38,964
The Knutsens.

1344
01:33:39,047 --> 01:33:43,343
The... who the fuck
are the Knutsens?

1345
01:33:43,426 --> 01:33:46,930
The Knutsens.
It's a wandering-daughter job.

1346
01:33:47,888 --> 01:33:50,808
Bunny Lebowski, man.

1347
01:33:50,891 --> 01:33:53,352
Her real name is Fawn Knutsen.

1348
01:33:53,435 --> 01:33:56,689
Her parents want her back.

1349
01:33:56,772 --> 01:33:59,191
Jesus fucking Christ.

1350
01:33:59,275 --> 01:34:01,442
Crazy, huh? Ran away
about a year ago.

1351
01:34:01,526 --> 01:34:05,321
The Knutsens told me to
show her this when I found her.

1352
01:34:05,405 --> 01:34:09,450
It's the family farm
outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.

1353
01:34:09,534 --> 01:34:12,495
They think it'll
make her homesick.

1354
01:34:12,579 --> 01:34:16,832
How are you gonna keep 'em down
once they've seen Karl Hungus?

1355
01:34:16,915 --> 01:34:19,585
- She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.
- Oh, man.

1356
01:34:19,668 --> 01:34:21,587
Maybe not, but she's not around.

1357
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:26,300
Hey, maybe you and me
could pool our resources.

1358
01:34:26,383 --> 01:34:30,469
Trade information.
Professional courtesy.

1359
01:34:30,553 --> 01:34:32,680
Compeers, you know what I mean?

1360
01:34:32,763 --> 01:34:34,932
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Fuck off, Da Fino.

1361
01:34:35,016 --> 01:34:37,268
And stay away from my special...

1362
01:34:37,351 --> 01:34:40,186
from my fucking
lady friend, man.

1363
01:34:42,188 --> 01:34:44,774
Ze lingonberry pancakes.

1364
01:34:48,904 --> 01:34:50,989
Lingonberry pancakes.

1365
01:34:54,658 --> 01:34:57,036
Sree pigs in blanket.

1366
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:05,127
She has lingonberry pancakes.

1367
01:35:13,009 --> 01:35:15,470
We totally fucked it up, man.

1368
01:35:15,553 --> 01:35:19,223
We fucked up his payoff,
we pissed off the kidnappers,

1369
01:35:19,307 --> 01:35:23,185
and Lebowski, he yelled at me
but he didn't do anything, huh?

1370
01:35:23,268 --> 01:35:25,979
Well, sometimes
it's a cathartic...

1371
01:35:26,063 --> 01:35:28,148
If he knows I'm a fuck-up,

1372
01:35:28,232 --> 01:35:31,151
why does he ask me
to get his wife back?

1373
01:35:31,235 --> 01:35:33,778
Because he doesn't
want her back.

1374
01:35:33,861 --> 01:35:37,031
He's had enough.
He no longer digs her.

1375
01:35:37,114 --> 01:35:40,117
But then,
why doesn't he give a shit

1376
01:35:40,201 --> 01:35:42,036
about his million bucks?

1377
01:35:42,119 --> 01:35:45,122
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,

1378
01:35:45,206 --> 01:35:46,957
but he never asked for it back.

1379
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:50,335
The million bucks was
never in the briefcase.

1380
01:35:50,418 --> 01:35:53,755
The briefcase was
fucking empty, man.

1381
01:35:53,838 --> 01:35:56,967
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.

1382
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:59,802
You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.

1383
01:35:59,885 --> 01:36:02,179
How does
this add up to an emergency?

1384
01:36:02,263 --> 01:36:03,764
Huh?

1385
01:36:03,847 --> 01:36:06,433
I see what you're
getting at, Dude,

1386
01:36:06,517 --> 01:36:09,353
he kept the money.
My point is...

1387
01:36:09,436 --> 01:36:14,107
here we are, it's Shabbos,
which I'm allowed to break

1388
01:36:14,190 --> 01:36:17,110
only if it's a matter
of life or death.

1389
01:36:17,193 --> 01:36:19,529
Come off it.
You're not even fucking Jewish.

1390
01:36:19,612 --> 01:36:22,073
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1391
01:36:22,156 --> 01:36:24,158
You're fucking Polish-Catholic.

1392
01:36:24,242 --> 01:36:26,660
I converted when I married
Cynthia. Come on.

1393
01:36:26,743 --> 01:36:29,371
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know this.

1394
01:36:29,454 --> 01:36:31,957
Five years ago,
you were divorced.

1395
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,626
So when you get divorced,
you return your library card?

1396
01:36:34,710 --> 01:36:37,421
You get a new license?
You stop being Jewish?

1397
01:36:37,504 --> 01:36:41,382
- This is the driveway.
- I'm Jewish as fucking Tevye.

1398
01:36:41,465 --> 01:36:45,136
Man, it's all a part
of your sick Cynthia thing.

1399
01:36:45,219 --> 01:36:49,098
Taking care of her fucking dog.
Going to her fucking synagogue.

1400
01:36:49,181 --> 01:36:50,725
You're living in the past.

1401
01:36:50,808 --> 01:36:52,726
3,000 years
of beautiful tradition

1402
01:36:52,809 --> 01:36:54,686
from Moses to Sandy Koufax,

1403
01:36:54,769 --> 01:36:59,649
damn right I'm living
in the fucking past! I... Jesus.

1404
01:36:59,733 --> 01:37:02,235
What the hell happened?

1405
01:37:22,128 --> 01:37:23,880
Where was she, man?

1406
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:25,965
Visiting friends
in Palm Springs.

1407
01:37:26,049 --> 01:37:28,259
She just left.
Never bothered to tell us.

1408
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:31,095
I guess the nihilist
knew where she was.

1409
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:32,971
She never
even kidnapped herself.

1410
01:37:33,055 --> 01:37:37,017
- Who is this gentleman, Dude?
- Who am I? A fucking veteran.

1411
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:39,853
You shouldn't go in, Dude.
He's very angry.

1412
01:37:42,648 --> 01:37:44,690
So, man...

1413
01:37:44,774 --> 01:37:48,319
So, she's back,
no thanks to you.

1414
01:37:48,402 --> 01:37:51,280
- Where's the fucking money?
- A million bucks

1415
01:37:51,364 --> 01:37:55,284
from fucking needy little
urban achievers! You are scum!

1416
01:37:55,368 --> 01:37:57,745
- Who the hell is he?
- Who am I?

1417
01:37:57,827 --> 01:38:01,122
I'm the guy that's gonna kick
your goldbricking ass!

1418
01:38:01,206 --> 01:38:04,918
The briefcase was empty.
You kept the money for yourself.

1419
01:38:05,001 --> 01:38:07,003
You have your story,
I have mine.

1420
01:38:07,087 --> 01:38:09,839
I entrusted the money
to you, and you stole it.

1421
01:38:09,923 --> 01:38:13,342
As if we would ever
take your bullshit money!

1422
01:38:13,425 --> 01:38:17,096
You thought Bunny had been
kidnapped, and you were glad.

1423
01:38:17,179 --> 01:38:19,431
You could make
some money disappear.

1424
01:38:19,515 --> 01:38:22,184
You needed was a sap
to pin it on.

1425
01:38:22,268 --> 01:38:26,145
You just met me.
You... human paraquat!

1426
01:38:26,229 --> 01:38:28,439
You figured,
"Oh, here's a loser."

1427
01:38:28,523 --> 01:38:31,859
Somebody the square community
won't give a shit about.

1428
01:38:31,943 --> 01:38:36,322
- Well, aren't you?
- Well, yeah, but...

1429
01:38:37,614 --> 01:38:39,074
Get out, both of you.

1430
01:38:39,157 --> 01:38:42,578
Look at that phony.
Pretending to be a millionaire.

1431
01:38:42,661 --> 01:38:44,580
Out of this house now, you bums!

1432
01:38:44,663 --> 01:38:46,373
Let me tell you something.

1433
01:38:46,456 --> 01:38:48,834
I've seen
a lot of spinals, Dude,

1434
01:38:48,917 --> 01:38:52,420
and this guy's a fake.
A fucking goldbricker.

1435
01:38:52,503 --> 01:38:55,798
- Stay away from me!
- This guy fucking walks.

1436
01:38:55,882 --> 01:38:58,843
- I've never been more certain.
- Stay away!

1437
01:38:58,926 --> 01:39:02,263
Walter, for Christ's sake,
man, he's a cripple.

1438
01:39:02,346 --> 01:39:04,264
Get away from me!

1439
01:39:06,099 --> 01:39:09,394
- Put him down, man!
- Yeah, I'll put him down!

1440
01:39:09,477 --> 01:39:11,605
Rauss! Achtung, baby!

1441
01:39:27,786 --> 01:39:31,039
Come on, help me
put him back in his chair.

1442
01:39:51,099 --> 01:39:53,477
Sure, you'll see
some tank battles.

1443
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:56,271
Fighting in desert
is very different

1444
01:39:56,355 --> 01:40:00,441
from fighting in jungle.
'Nam was a foot soldier's war,

1445
01:40:00,524 --> 01:40:04,612
whereas this thing should,
you know, be a piece of cake.

1446
01:40:04,695 --> 01:40:08,532
I mean, I had an M16 Jacko,
not an Abrams fucking tank.

1447
01:40:08,616 --> 01:40:11,034
Me and Charlie,
eyeball to eyeball.

1448
01:40:11,117 --> 01:40:13,870
- Yeah.
- That's fuckin' combat.

1449
01:40:13,954 --> 01:40:16,623
The man in
the black pajamas, Dude.

1450
01:40:16,706 --> 01:40:19,125
Worthy fuckin' adversary.

1451
01:40:19,209 --> 01:40:22,754
- Who's in pajamas, Walter?
- Shut the fuck up, Donny.

1452
01:40:22,837 --> 01:40:24,797
Whereas, what we have here...

1453
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,341
Fig-eaters wearing
towels on their heads,

1454
01:40:27,424 --> 01:40:29,718
trying to find reverse
on a Soviet tank.

1455
01:40:29,802 --> 01:40:32,096
- This... this is not a worthy...
- Hey!

1456
01:40:32,179 --> 01:40:34,515
What's this day-of-rest shit?

1457
01:40:34,598 --> 01:40:37,559
What's this bullshit?!
I don't fuckin' care!

1458
01:40:37,642 --> 01:40:41,312
It don't matter to Jesus.
But you not fooling me, man.

1459
01:40:41,396 --> 01:40:43,606
You might fool
the league office,

1460
01:40:43,690 --> 01:40:46,234
but you don't fool Jesus.

1461
01:40:46,317 --> 01:40:48,945
It's bush league
psyche-out stuff.

1462
01:40:49,028 --> 01:40:51,405
Laughable, man.

1463
01:40:51,488 --> 01:40:54,741
I would have fucked you
in the ass Saturday.

1464
01:40:54,825 --> 01:40:58,829
I'll fuck you in the ass
next Wednesday instead.

1465
01:40:58,912 --> 01:41:03,040
Whoo! You got a date
Wednesday, baby.

1466
01:41:06,544 --> 01:41:08,713
He's cracking.

1467
01:41:09,171 --> 01:41:10,715
The whole concept of Asia.

1468
01:41:10,798 --> 01:41:13,050
Many learned men
have disputed this,

1469
01:41:13,134 --> 01:41:16,386
but in the 14th Century,
the Rabahm, he...

1470
01:41:25,145 --> 01:41:27,439
Well, they finally did it.

1471
01:41:27,522 --> 01:41:29,732
They killed my fucking car.

1472
01:41:29,815 --> 01:41:33,611
We want ze money, Lebowski.

1473
01:41:33,694 --> 01:41:35,946
Ja, otherwise, we kill ze girl.

1474
01:41:36,030 --> 01:41:39,533
Ja, it seems you have
forgotten our little deal.

1475
01:41:39,617 --> 01:41:42,452
You don't have
the fucking girl, dipshit.

1476
01:41:42,535 --> 01:41:45,205
We know you never did.

1477
01:41:45,288 --> 01:41:46,956
Are these the Nazis?

1478
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,250
No, nihilists.
Nothing to be afraid of.

1479
01:41:51,169 --> 01:41:54,756
Ve don't care. Ve still
want the money, Lebowski,

1480
01:41:54,839 --> 01:41:57,007
or we'll fuck you up.

1481
01:41:57,090 --> 01:41:59,801
Fuck you.
Fuck the three of yous.

1482
01:41:59,885 --> 01:42:03,513
No, without a hostage,
there is no ransom.

1483
01:42:03,597 --> 01:42:06,808
That's what ransom is.
Those are the fucking rules.

1484
01:42:06,892 --> 01:42:09,143
His girlfriend gave up her toe.

1485
01:42:09,227 --> 01:42:11,854
She zought
we'd be getting $1 million.

1486
01:42:11,938 --> 01:42:13,189
It's not fair.

1487
01:42:13,272 --> 01:42:16,359
Fair? Who's the fucking
nihilist around here,

1488
01:42:16,442 --> 01:42:18,528
you bunch of fucking crybabies.

1489
01:42:18,611 --> 01:42:22,697
Cool it, Walter. Hey, look, pal,
there never was any money.

1490
01:42:22,781 --> 01:42:25,116
The big Lebowski
gave me an empty briefcase,

1491
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:27,035
so take it up with him, man.

1492
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:29,538
I would like my undies back.

1493
01:42:29,621 --> 01:42:32,874
- Are these guys gonna hurt us?
- No, these men are cowards.

1494
01:42:32,958 --> 01:42:36,293
OK, so we take
ze money you have on you

1495
01:42:36,377 --> 01:42:38,337
and we calls it even.

1496
01:42:39,129 --> 01:42:40,965
Fuck you.

1497
01:42:41,048 --> 01:42:44,510
No, Walter, come on.
We're ending this cheap, man.

1498
01:42:44,593 --> 01:42:47,471
- No, what's mine is mine.
- Come on, Walter.

1499
01:42:47,555 --> 01:42:51,641
- No funny stuff.
- All right, I got...

1500
01:42:51,724 --> 01:42:54,686
- uh, 4 bucks, almost 5.
- I got $18.

1501
01:42:54,769 --> 01:42:56,771
What's mine is mine.

1502
01:42:56,854 --> 01:42:59,482
We fuck you up, man.
We takes the money.

1503
01:42:59,566 --> 01:43:01,984
Come and get it.

1504
01:43:02,609 --> 01:43:04,903
We fuck you up.

1505
01:43:04,987 --> 01:43:06,947
Show me what you got, nihilist.

1506
01:43:07,030 --> 01:43:08,532
I fuck you.

1507
01:43:08,615 --> 01:43:10,200
Come on, he's got a sword.

1508
01:43:10,284 --> 01:43:12,119
Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.

1509
01:43:12,202 --> 01:43:15,413
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1510
01:43:15,496 --> 01:43:17,123
I fuck you, I!

1511
01:43:22,461 --> 01:43:24,547
Take it easy, man.
Here's the $4.

1512
01:43:30,927 --> 01:43:32,929
I got a fucking ball, man.

1513
01:43:38,643 --> 01:43:40,770
Anti-Semite!

1514
01:43:40,854 --> 01:43:43,022
I fuck you in ze ass.

1515
01:43:43,105 --> 01:43:46,609
I fuck you! I fuck you!

1516
01:43:46,692 --> 01:43:48,319
I fuck you! I fuck you!

1517
01:43:54,782 --> 01:43:56,910
We got a man down, Dude.

1518
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:02,540
God, they shot him, man.

1519
01:44:02,624 --> 01:44:04,584
- No, Dude.
- They shot Donny?

1520
01:44:04,667 --> 01:44:07,836
There weren't any shots fired.
It's a heart attack.

1521
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:10,297
Call the medics, Dude.

1522
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:13,926
I'd go myself, but I'm
pumping blood. Might pass out.

1523
01:44:14,009 --> 01:44:17,638
Rest easy, good buddy,
you're doing fine.

1524
01:44:17,721 --> 01:44:19,890
We got help choppering in.

1525
01:44:46,623 --> 01:44:49,416
Hello, gentlemen.
You are the bereaved?

1526
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,335
Yeah, man.

1527
01:44:51,418 --> 01:44:53,462
Francis Donnelly.
Pleased to meet you.

1528
01:44:53,546 --> 01:44:55,089
Jeff Lebowski.

1529
01:44:55,172 --> 01:44:56,757
Walter Sobchak.

1530
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:59,510
The Dude, actually, is, uh...

1531
01:44:59,593 --> 01:45:02,220
- Excuse me?
- Oh, nothing.

1532
01:45:02,303 --> 01:45:08,017
Yes, I understand
you're taking away the remains.

1533
01:45:08,101 --> 01:45:09,644
Yeah.

1534
01:45:09,727 --> 01:45:12,230
We have the urn.

1535
01:45:12,313 --> 01:45:15,649
I assume this is credit card.

1536
01:45:16,775 --> 01:45:18,235
Yeah.

1537
01:45:32,456 --> 01:45:34,750
What's this?

1538
01:45:34,834 --> 01:45:36,711
That's for the urn.

1539
01:45:36,794 --> 01:45:39,213
Don't need it.
We're scattering the ashes.

1540
01:45:39,297 --> 01:45:41,339
Yes, so we were informed.

1541
01:45:41,423 --> 01:45:43,800
However, we must, of course,

1542
01:45:43,884 --> 01:45:47,095
transmit the remains
to you in a receptacle.

1543
01:45:48,430 --> 01:45:50,432
This is $180.

1544
01:45:50,515 --> 01:45:54,435
It is our most...
modestly priced receptacle.

1545
01:45:54,518 --> 01:45:56,979
- Can we just, uh...
- $180?

1546
01:45:57,062 --> 01:46:01,025
- They range up to 3,000.
- Uh, we're, uh, ahem...

1547
01:46:01,108 --> 01:46:03,235
Can't we just
rent it from you?

1548
01:46:03,319 --> 01:46:06,071
Sir, this is a mortuary,
not a rental house.

1549
01:46:06,154 --> 01:46:07,697
We're scattering the ashes!

1550
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:10,867
Just because we're bereaved,
doesn't make us saps!

1551
01:46:10,950 --> 01:46:13,703
Sir, please, lower your voices.

1552
01:46:13,786 --> 01:46:15,830
Man, don't you have, you know,

1553
01:46:15,914 --> 01:46:19,666
something else we could
put him in, you know?

1554
01:46:19,750 --> 01:46:22,336
That is our most...
modestly priced receptacle.

1555
01:46:22,419 --> 01:46:23,962
Goddamn it!

1556
01:46:25,714 --> 01:46:27,925
Is there a Ralph's around here?

1557
01:46:54,574 --> 01:46:58,286
Donny was a good bowler
and a good man.

1558
01:46:58,370 --> 01:47:00,663
He was one of us.

1559
01:47:00,746 --> 01:47:05,084
He was a man who loved
the outdoors... and bowling.

1560
01:47:05,167 --> 01:47:07,419
As a surfer,
he explored the beaches

1561
01:47:07,503 --> 01:47:09,380
of Southern California,

1562
01:47:09,463 --> 01:47:14,676
from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo
and up to Pismo.

1563
01:47:14,759 --> 01:47:19,681
He died... he died as so
many men of his generation,

1564
01:47:19,764 --> 01:47:21,558
before his time.

1565
01:47:21,641 --> 01:47:24,769
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him.

1566
01:47:24,853 --> 01:47:28,355
As you took so many bright,
flowering young men

1567
01:47:28,438 --> 01:47:33,861
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,
and Hill 364.

1568
01:47:33,944 --> 01:47:36,321
These young men
gave their lives.

1569
01:47:36,405 --> 01:47:38,614
So did Donny.

1570
01:47:40,366 --> 01:47:43,369
Donny who loved bowling.

1571
01:47:45,037 --> 01:47:47,623
And so...

1572
01:47:47,707 --> 01:47:50,585
Theodore Donald Karabotsos,

1573
01:47:50,668 --> 01:47:55,380
in accordance
with what we think

1574
01:47:55,463 --> 01:47:57,799
your dying wishes
might well have been,

1575
01:47:57,883 --> 01:48:01,761
we commit your final,
mortal remains

1576
01:48:01,845 --> 01:48:05,723
to the bosom
of the Pacific Ocean,

1577
01:48:05,806 --> 01:48:08,684
which you loved so well.

1578
01:48:10,477 --> 01:48:12,438
Goodnight, sweet prince.

1579
01:48:26,701 --> 01:48:28,912
Shit.

1580
01:48:30,705 --> 01:48:33,665
Oh, shit, Dude, I'm sorry.

1581
01:48:34,374 --> 01:48:37,920
- Goddamn wind.
- Goddamn it, Walter.

1582
01:48:38,003 --> 01:48:40,422
- You fucking asshole!
- Dude, I'm sorry.

1583
01:48:40,506 --> 01:48:42,966
Everything's
a fucking travesty with you.

1584
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:44,759
Sorry. It was an accident.

1585
01:48:44,842 --> 01:48:46,594
What was that shit
about Vietnam?

1586
01:48:46,677 --> 01:48:50,056
What does anything
have to do with Vietnam?

1587
01:48:50,139 --> 01:48:51,974
What the fuck
were you talking about?

1588
01:48:52,058 --> 01:48:54,018
Dude, I'm sorry.

1589
01:48:55,895 --> 01:48:58,146
Fuckin'...

1590
01:49:03,777 --> 01:49:06,029
Fuck, Walter.

1591
01:49:06,655 --> 01:49:11,534
Come on, Dude.
Hey, fuck it, man.

1592
01:49:15,246 --> 01:49:17,790
Let's go bowling.

1593
01:50:11,298 --> 01:50:13,258
Two oat sodas, Gary.

1594
01:50:13,341 --> 01:50:15,802
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Yeah, thanks, man.

1595
01:50:15,886 --> 01:50:18,137
I'm sorry to hear about Donny.

1596
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:21,599
Oh, well, yeah, you know,

1597
01:50:21,682 --> 01:50:25,144
sometimes you eat the bar
and sometimes, you know...

1598
01:50:25,227 --> 01:50:27,146
Hey, man!

1599
01:50:27,229 --> 01:50:29,190
Howdy doo, Dude.

1600
01:50:29,273 --> 01:50:31,733
I wondered if I'd see you again.

1601
01:50:31,816 --> 01:50:35,236
I wouldn't miss the semis.
How have things been going?

1602
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:38,239
Strikes and gutters,
ups and downs.

1603
01:50:38,323 --> 01:50:41,743
- Sure. I gotcha.
- Yeah.

1604
01:50:41,826 --> 01:50:43,744
Thanks, Gary.

1605
01:50:43,827 --> 01:50:46,497
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.

1606
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:49,208
- Sure. Take it easy, Dude.
- Oh, yeah.

1607
01:50:49,291 --> 01:50:51,376
I know that you will.

1608
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:55,464
Yeah, well, the Dude abides.

1609
01:51:01,177 --> 01:51:04,305
The Dude abides.

1610
01:51:07,099 --> 01:51:11,770
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

1611
01:51:11,853 --> 01:51:15,857
It's good knowing
he's out there, the Dude.

1612
01:51:15,941 --> 01:51:19,027
Takin' her easy
for all us sinners.

1613
01:51:19,110 --> 01:51:21,279
Shoosh.

1614
01:51:21,363 --> 01:51:24,657
I sure hope he makes the finals.

1615
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:29,495
Well, that about does her.
Wraps her all up.

1616
01:51:29,578 --> 01:51:34,416
Things seem to have worked out
good for the Dude and Walter.

1617
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:38,211
It was a pretty good story,
don't you think?

1618
01:51:38,294 --> 01:51:41,381
Made me laugh to beat the band.

1619
01:51:41,464 --> 01:51:43,758
Parts, anyway.

1620
01:51:43,842 --> 01:51:47,262
I didn't like seeing Donny go.

1621
01:51:47,345 --> 01:51:50,013
But then I happen to know

1622
01:51:50,097 --> 01:51:53,600
that there's
a little Lebowski on the way.

1623
01:51:53,684 --> 01:51:57,521
I guess that's how
the whole darn human comedy

1624
01:51:57,604 --> 01:52:00,691
keeps perpetuating itself

1625
01:52:00,774 --> 01:52:03,568
down through the generations.

1626
01:52:03,651 --> 01:52:05,653
Westward the wagons,

1627
01:52:05,736 --> 01:52:08,823
across the sands
of time until we...

1628
01:52:08,906 --> 01:52:10,950
Oh, look at me.

1629
01:52:11,033 --> 01:52:13,744
I'm ramblin' again.

1630
01:52:13,828 --> 01:52:16,496
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.

1631
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:19,583
Catch ya later on
down the trail.

1632
01:52:19,666 --> 01:52:24,004
Say, friend, you got any more
of that good Sarsaparilla?

1633
01:57:01,552 --> 01:57:06,973
