1
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,200
No one would have believed
in the early years of the 21st century

2
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,370
that our world was being watched
by intelligences greater than our own.

3
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,300
That as men busied themselves
about their various concerns,

4
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,430
they observed and studied

5
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,050
the way a man with a microscope
might scrutinize the creatures

6
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,100
that swarm and multiply
in a drop of water.

7
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,240
With infinite complacency,
men went to and fro about the globe,

8
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,320
confident of our empire over this world.

9
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,700
Yet, across the gulf of space,

10
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,670
intellects vast and cool
and unsympathetic

11
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,260
regarded our planet with envious eyes

12
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,420
and slowly and surely

13
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,100
drew their plans against us.

14
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,730
Tell him to send it over
to the cargo shed.

15
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,860
It's on its way.

16
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Ray.

17
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,420
Ferrier. Whoa.

18
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,540
I need you back in four instead of 12.
I got half of Korea coming in at noon.

19
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,880
No, no, no, I can't.
I'm on a 12-hour blow. Call Tedesco.

20
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,340
Come on. Tedesco can't move
40 containers in an hour.

21
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,640
I got to have somebody
who can do double picks.

22
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,260
Wish I could help you, Sal.
It's the goddamn union regulations.

23
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,640
Come on. I'm in a position here, Ray.

24
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,140
You remember
the union regulations, Sal.

25
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,360
You know what your problem is?

26
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,030
I can think of a couple women
who'd be happy to tell you.

27
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,050
8:30? Did we say that?

28
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,100
We said 8:00.

29
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,220
Hey, this is...

30
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,480
This is one safe-looking new vehicle
you got yourself here, Tim.

31
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,950
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

32
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,700
8:00?

33
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,660
We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,
depending on the traffic.

34
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,670
There he is.

35
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,750
Get a hug?

36
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,300
Confusing handshake?
Kick in the teeth?

37
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,430
The door's locked.

38
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,760
Still working on those manners?

39
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,430
Hello, Dad.

40
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,060
Hello, Rachel.

41
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,530
Yo, Stan, hurry up.
We got to get to work.

42
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,860
Here, honey. Let me
give you a hand getting that inside.

43
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,780
- The door's locked.
- Sweetheart, let me get it.

44
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,280
- I don't mind. I don't mind.
- Hey, she said she could get it.

45
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,740
- It's heavy.
- She said she could get it.

46
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,700
It's got rollers. Just roll it, roll it.

47
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,370
Yeah, but we can't roll it
up the stairs, can we?

48
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,840
Really, I got it from here, okay?

49
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,060
It's a 302 V8. It's...

50
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,100
It's gonna be out of here next week.

51
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,940
You better get going, you wanna
beat the traffic, don't you think?

52
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,070
You're out of milk.

53
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,320
And everything else.

54
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,150
Yeah.
Could you close the door, please?

55
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,990
Because that's my refrigerator.

56
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,830
I'm gonna go wait outside.

57
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,830
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll see you in a few days.

58
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,880
Bye, Tim.

59
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,010
- I better get this upstairs.
- Let me... Let me get...

60
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,330
- Mom, Mom, Mom.
- Mary Ann...

61
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,140
- Okay, okay.
- Mom, Mom.

62
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,430
A little old to still be sharing,
aren't they?

63
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,780
- I don't hear any complaints.
- No, I do.

64
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,160
Robbie's got a paper on the French
occupation of Algeria due Monday,

65
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,120
which he's yet to begin.

66
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,410
It would be nice if he were done
by the time we got back

67
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,370
so we don't have to keep
him up all night on Sunday.

68
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,210
- I just gotta type it up-
- No.

69
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,960
- You just got to start writing it first.
- I love you, Mom.

70
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,760
I love you.

71
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,220
Listen to your father.

72
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,810
No shoes on the bed.

73
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,140
We'll be at my parents' house
in Boston,

74
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,230
but don't call the house line,
you know, they...

75
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,810
Well, the point is,
I've got my cell phone,

76
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,730
so if anything comes up
or you have any questions, just call me.

77
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,730
Believe it or not, I can handle it.

78
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,370
- I'll leave the phone on.
- Mary Ann.

79
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,660
It's a good look for you.

80
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,210
You think?

81
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,830
Yeah.

82
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,340
Take care of our kids.

83
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,080
Mary Ann,
you got nothing to worry about.

84
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,350
Listen, you tell your mom that
Ray sends his love and kisses.

85
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,980
Right. She'll love that.

86
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,270
The Ukraine,
a country of some 52 million people,

87
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,440
is in almost total blackness tonight

88
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,860
in the wake of a series
of freakish lightning storms

89
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,740
of catastrophic proportion,

90
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,660
which struck the country at
approximately 4:00 a.m. local time.

91
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,450
<i>...EMP, or electromagnetic pulse,
which causes a temporary interruption</i>

92
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,250
of all electrical current within its field.

93
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,670
<i>As in the Ukraine, there are
scattered reports that the E MP here</i>

94
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,170
was followed by seismic activity
on the scale of an earthquake,

95
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,480
measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale.
This...

96
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,070
- Baseball season's over.
- Five minutes. It's not gonna kill you.

97
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,570
There he is.

98
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,780
Boston?

99
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,000
That's how it is?

100
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,500
Is that how it's gonna be?

101
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,670
- Careful with that throw.
- Whatever, Ray.

102
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,750
Mom says you got
a report due on Monday,

103
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,790
so you're gonna work on that
when we're done here.

104
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,500
Yeah, I'm almost finished.
I just got to type it up.

105
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,260
Yeah, bullshit.

106
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,350
Yeah? What do you know, Ray?

107
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,430
Everything. Haven't you heard?
Between me and my brother,

108
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,320
we know everything.

109
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,070
What's the capital of Australia?

110
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,530
That's one my brother knows.

111
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,450
Okay with you if I just laugh the first
500 times you tell that one?

112
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,320
Just do your report.

113
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,210
We don't send you to school
so you can flunk out.

114
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,960
You don't pay for it, Tim does.

115
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,790
That's half what I've got.

116
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,810
You're an asshole. I hate coming here.

117
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,970
That why you act like such a dick?

118
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
What?

119
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,570
That's not how you're gonna
get through to him.

120
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,000
- If you want him to listen to you...
- What are you, your mother or mine?

121
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,080
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to sleep.

122
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,960
I work for a living.

123
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,680
- What are we supposed to eat?
- You know, order.

124
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,870
Three and two...

125
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,030
- Electromagnetic storm...
- The storms were tracked...

126
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,500
And I'll have my own little secret.
Good idea, hey, Gary?

127
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,870
- No.
- What do you know?

128
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,720
You're a snail.

129
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,010
What's the matter?

130
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,770
Got a splinter.

131
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,770
Where'd you get it? Come here.

132
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,600
On your porch railing.

133
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,410
Do you need me to... What?
To do what? You want me to...

134
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,900
- You want me to take that out?
- Absolutely not.

135
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,410
Come here. Let me see it. Let me see.

136
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,510
Dad.

137
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,910
- Just look. Don't touch it. Dad.
- Rach.

138
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,920
- I can't. You're moving it around.
- Okay, but don't touch it. Just look at it.

139
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,500
It's gonna get infected.

140
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,330
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it's gonna get infected.

141
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,340
No, it won't.

142
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,100
When it's ready,
my body will just push it out.

143
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,440
- Push it out, huh?
- I read that.

144
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,650
You should get TiVo.

145
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,350
- Tim got it for my room
- TiVo?

146
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,860
It's awesome.

147
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,490
I can watch all my shows
after homework.

148
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,490
Yeah, I'll just put it on my platinum card.

149
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,040
Robbie? Robbie.

150
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,540
What is that?

151
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,320
Hummus.

152
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,080
- Hummus?
- From the health-food place.

153
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,550
Kept one of their menus
last time we were here.

154
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,810
You said order.

155
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,650
I meant order food.

156
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,350
Where is Robbie?

157
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,890
- He went out.
- Out where?

158
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,400
I don't know.
He just took your car and left.

159
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,940
Who said that? Who's there?

160
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,870
It's the clam burglar.

161
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,180
Steven, look at this.

162
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,690
- What's up?
- Check it out!

163
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,020
You ever see something like that?

164
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,730
Springtime, maybe.
Not this time of year.

165
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,040
Come on, we can see better
from the back yard.

166
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,810
You got to come see this!

167
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,740
- That is so weird.
- What?

168
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,650
The wind is blowing toward the storm.

169
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,860
That is weird.

170
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,830
Hey, watch it!

171
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,290
Rachel, you wanna see something cool?

172
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,700
It's okay.

173
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,990
- I wanna go inside.
- It's okay.

174
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,920
I wanna go inside.

175
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,290
Okay, you go ahead.

176
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,630
That's enough weather for me.

177
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,340
Don't wanna go by myself.

178
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,800
- It's kind of fun, isn't it?
- No.

179
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,890
- Come on, like the Fourth of July.
- No, it's not.

180
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,770
Oh, say can...

181
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,320
It's okay. You're fine.

182
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,940
- It hit right behind our house.
- Yeah, well, it's...

183
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,740
It's not gonna hit there again, okay,

184
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,570
because lightning doesn't strike
twice in the same place.

185
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,670
Shit!

186
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,180
Where's Robbie?

187
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,180
I don't know.

188
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,510
Is Robbie okay?

189
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,590
Are you okay?

190
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,650
Where's the thunder?

191
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,860
Why won't it stop?

192
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,660
Is it over?

193
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,340
Where are you going?

194
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,550
Just... I'm just checking things out.
Just wait. Wait there.

195
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,350
- Are we gonna be okay?
- I don't know.

196
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,600
- You don't know?
- No, I meant, I just...

197
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,430
Rachel, please.

198
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,900
Just stop asking so many questions.
Just wait here.

199
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,060
Turn everything off.

200
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,980
Everything is off.

201
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,450
I can't get one freaking thing to turn on.

202
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,410
You believe this, Ray? Every single car.

203
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,320
Jesus. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

204
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,120
- The car just stopped, and...
- You're okay?

205
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,950
- Are you okay? You all right?
- The lightning started to hit

206
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,370
about a block away,
over and over again.

207
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,500
- And me and this other guy...
- Where the hell did you go?

208
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,170
- Over on Lincoln Avenue.
- Lincoln Avenue?

209
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,540
- By the church.
- You see it? You saw the lightning?

210
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,170
- Were you near it?
- Yeah, 26 times we counted,

211
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,260
over and over again.

212
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,880
The lightning started to hit.
It opened up this hole or something...

213
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,970
- I don't know.
- Twenty-six times?

214
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,520
- Yeah.
- Okay.

215
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,720
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

216
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,850
Good. All right, well,
your sister is in the house,

217
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,270
and I want you to go in that house
and I want you to stay with her, okay?

218
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,480
The next time you take my car with
no driver's license and no permission,

219
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,160
I call the cops.

220
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,330
You better be there when I get back.

221
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,250
- Yeah.
- Robbie.

222
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,410
Manny, Manny. Manny, what is it, dead?

223
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,170
All of them. Everything. Look at this.

224
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,500
- The starter's fried.
- Lightning hit it?

225
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,050
Not even close.
I thought if I changed it...

226
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,590
- You got any idea what's going on?
- I'm on my way to find out.

227
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,800
Try changing the solenoid.
It's probably fried.

228
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,350
Right, that's what I said.
I told you that. The solenoid.

229
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,820
Hey, they're saying all the lightning
struck down by the church.

230
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,710
What the hell is going on around here?

231
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,580
- Let us through.
- Hey.

232
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,950
- Let us through here.
- Hey, hey.

233
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,870
What up, Ray?

234
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,660
I should've known
you two were behind this.

235
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,750
Hey, God's pissed off
at the neighborhood, Raymond.

236
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,840
- I'll tell you that much.
- Can you blame him?

237
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,930
- You see it?
- Yeah.

238
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,420
- You got power where you are?
- Nope. Nothing.

239
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,960
It's the cars, though.
You know, that's the thing.

240
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,130
Solar flare.
That's what this guy told me he heard.

241
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,800
- A solar flare?
- Yeah, he says the sun shoots off

242
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,340
- these big blobs of plasma.
- Let me tell you something.

243
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,970
They turn into solar flares.
It's the only thing that can kill

244
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,140
- all the electronic stuff like that.
- Can I tell you something?

245
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,640
The sun does not cause lightning, okay?

246
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,100
Bro, I'm just telling you
what that guy said he heard.

247
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,650
Okay, I understand, but it just
sounds dumb when you're saying that.

248
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,950
I've never seen anything like this before.

249
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,490
That many strikes of lightning
in one spot?

250
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,160
- Is this the only place?
- Come on, put that down.

251
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,830
- You wanna step back, please?
- Step back.

252
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,170
- You're gonna fall in.
- Get back.

253
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,760
Back up, people.
People, back up back there.

254
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,710
Move back. Everybody back up.

255
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,810
Move back.

256
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,430
Is it hot?

257
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,530
No.

258
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,690
- It's freezing.
- What is that?

259
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,520
Hey, move. You feel that?

260
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,740
- I feel that.
- Hey, Bobby, come check this out.

261
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,570
- You feel that?
- Feel that?

262
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,440
- Yeah, I feel that.
- What is it, the subway?

263
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,860
- There's no subway here.
- F train, maybe?

264
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,370
That can't be the water main.

265
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,780
There's nothing else down there.

266
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,530
- Water main doesn't run through here.
- Feel that?

267
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,460
Well, there's something down there
and it's moving.

268
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,010
Everybody, move back.

269
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,310
Whoa. Back it up. Come on.

270
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,470
Let's go.

271
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,940
Come on, folks. Back up. Get back.

272
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,610
Help me out here. Get back.

273
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,150
- Go! Move!
- Everybody, get out of the way!

274
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,110
Everyone, back up!
Everyone, clear the intersection!

275
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,290
Get out of the way! Back up! Back up!
Get out of the way!

276
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,150
- Forget it! Get back!
- Get the hell out of the street!

277
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,490
Move away!

278
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:25,210
Come on,
we've got to clear this area now!

279
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,430
That's my car!

280
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,330
Go, go.

281
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,600
Get the hell out of here!

282
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,750
Oh, my God!

283
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,950
Come on, people! Let's go!

284
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,790
Come on, back up!

285
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,460
Please! Move back!

286
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,380
Watch it!

287
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,720
Oh, my God.

288
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,390
Ray, no. Stay, man.

289
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,030
Just stay.

290
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,400
- Just stay back here. Stay back!
- Wow.

291
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,420
Come on.

292
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,720
What happened?

293
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,520
What's going on?

294
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,400
Dad, what's the matter?

295
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,730
What's all that stuff all over you?

296
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,150
- Ray.
- What's all this stuff?

297
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,450
Hello?

298
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,370
Ray?

299
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,190
We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.

300
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,520
What? Why?
I have no idea what's going on.

301
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,190
You're responsible for all the food
from the refrigerator and the cupboard,

302
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,530
- and put it in here.
- What's going on?

303
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,620
- Just tell me.
- Just do it.

304
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,530
- Rachel, sweetheart...
- Dad, you're really scaring me.

305
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,030
- ...I need you to get your suitcase...
- Dad.

306
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,700
...the one that you brought,
bring it to me, okay?

307
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,920
Can you just do that for me, darling?
Okay?

308
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,440
I don't think it's a fire.

309
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,850
- See? That looks like smoke to me.
- What's happening?

310
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,910
I can't tell you now.
We've only got about another minute.

311
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,480
Please.

312
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,440
Please.

313
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,920
- Just keep it down.
- Ray, I'm standing right beside you.

314
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,220
Can you please answer me?

315
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,310
Just get in the front seat, Robbie.

316
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,600
- Whose car is this?
- Just get in.

317
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,520
Whose car is this?

318
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,770
Hey. Hey, Ray.
You were absolutely right.

319
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,410
That is exact... I had to change the...

320
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,330
Ray? Hey.

321
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,990
Hey, Ray? Ray.

322
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
Ray.

323
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,990
What? Come on, open up.
Open the door, come on.

324
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,910
- Open the door, Ray. What are you...
- Get in, Manny.

325
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,250
That's funny.
You got to get out of the car.

326
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,120
- Manny, get in the car.
- It's not my car. It's not your car.

327
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,290
Manny, listen to me, pal.

328
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,130
- Manny, Manny, shut up.
- Kids, Daddy's acting crazy.

329
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,130
You can't do this. Guy's gonna
come back, he's not gonna...

330
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,840
Manny. Manny,
I don't have time to explain.

331
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,470
You're busting my chops.
I got a shop to run.

332
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,010
- Manny, listen to me.
- No, Ray. Get out of the...

333
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,590
Get in, Manny, or you're gonna die.

334
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,440
- What do you mean?
- Okay.

335
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,560
All right, get out of the truck.
I'm not kidding now.

336
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,390
Get out of the car, Ray.

337
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,310
I'm not gonna get in. I'm not getting in.

338
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,150
- Manny, get in with us.
- I'm not gonna get in trouble.

339
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,580
- Look, I'm not fooling around...
- Close the door. Close it.

340
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,000
Ray, bring the car back, Ray.
It's not my car.

341
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,330
Get down! Get down, get down!
Get down!

342
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,660
Is it the terrorists?

343
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,720
- Just get down. Get down! Get down!
- Holy shit!

344
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,040
- Where are we going?
- We got to go.

345
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,040
We got, maybe, like,
the only working car around here.

346
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,210
- I'm not stopping until we're clear of it.
- Clear of what?

347
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,710
- We got to go.
- What the hell is going on?

348
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,290
- Look, you saw, we're under attack!
- By who?

349
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,710
Who is attacking us?

350
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,590
Rachel?
Rachel, you've got to keep it down.

351
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,720
Rachel. Rachel. Shut up, Rachel.

352
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,890
- You're freaking her out!
- Look, I'm driving! Do something!

353
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,390
Okay, put them up, Rach.
Make the arms.

354
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,310
This space right here, this is yours.
This belongs to you, right?

355
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,810
- Yes.
- You're safe in your space.

356
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,360
- I'm safe in my space.
- You're safe in your space.

357
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,070
Nothing can happen to you
in your space.

358
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,190
- Okay.
- I'm really scared.

359
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,780
I'm gonna go to the front seat,
I'm gonna talk to Dad.

360
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,150
- No.
- I'll be two feet away. Okay?

361
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,740
- Okay.
- Will you hold my hand?

362
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,950
- Will you hold my hand?
- Yes.

363
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,870
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes.

364
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,040
I wanna know everything you know.

365
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,250
This...

366
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,210
This thing, this machine,
it crawled out of the ground,

367
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,750
started torching everything.
It was killing everybody.

368
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,550
What is it? Is it terrorists?

369
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,420
No, this came from someplace else.

370
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,310
- What do you mean, like Europe?
- No, Robbie, not like Europe!

371
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:28,080
That machine, it was already buried.

372
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,320
Maybe it...

373
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,540
It came down in the lightning storm.

374
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,620
- They came down in the lightning storm.
- What do you mean "came down"?

375
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,670
- You just said it was buried.
- No, the machine I'm talking about

376
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,880
was buried, but what came down
in the lightning storm,

377
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,470
what operates it, that's the... You know.

378
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,930
- The what?
- That's the...

379
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,550
Why aren't there any helicopters
or airplanes?

380
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,310
- It's the what?
- Hey, Rach. How you doing there, girl?

381
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,720
- How is she doing?
- How you doing?

382
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,930
- Fine.
- She's good.

383
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,390
Yeah? Good.
What was that thing you did with her?

384
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,690
Works sometimes.
She gets claustrophobic.

385
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,190
Yeah? Hey, Rachel? Hey.

386
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,150
- I want Mom.
- Yeah, I know. You feel better?

387
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,440
- I want Mom.
- Yeah? Tell me about it, you know?

388
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,950
- Take me to Mom's.
- Listen, what I need you to do is,

389
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,280
is I just need you to hold it together
for me, okay?

390
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,620
I want Mom!

391
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,990
When you start screaming like that,
you know, I can't really drive...

392
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,580
- Take me to Mom's!
- I know that.

393
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,160
That's where we're going right now.

394
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,580
- Rachel...
- Take me to Mom's!

395
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,080
I know!

396
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,110
Hurry up, Dad. Come on.

397
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,030
Robbie, get the door.

398
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:53,950
Mom!

399
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,360
- Mom!
- Mom!

400
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,460
Mom!

401
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,760
Mom? Tim?

402
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,930
Mom? Tim?

403
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,630
- Mom?
- Mom?

404
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,390
- Tim?
- Tim?

405
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,100
Tim?

406
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,650
Mom?

407
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,480
They're gone.

408
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,690
Is she dead?

409
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,600
She's not dead. All right?

410
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,360
She's just not here, okay?

411
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,820
- They were never here.
- How do you know?

412
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,150
Because they're on their way to Boston.

413
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,280
And so they just
kept on going up to Boston.

414
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,070
They're probably
at your grandma's house by now.

415
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,410
I'm gonna call her.

416
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,370
How come the lights are on here
and not at your place?

417
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,410
Because nothing bad happened here.
Okay?

418
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,830
So we're safe here. All right?

419
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,090
Okay, Rachel? This is your area.

420
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,550
- Okay, you are safe...
- Dad, that's not how it goes.

421
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,430
Okay. Well, are you hungry?
I'll get you some food.

422
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,680
I'm gonna feed you.
Get something to eat.

423
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,010
- What do we have? We have...
- Busy signal.

424
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,930
- It's one of the fast ones.
- What is this? Ketchup, mustard...

425
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:07,140
- You think all the circuits are down?
- Tabasco, barbecue sauce.

426
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,940
You know, this is really good, Robbie.
Vinaigrette. I said pack food.

427
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,110
- What the hell is this?
- That's all that was in your kitchen.

428
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,830
Okay. That's all right.

429
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,960
All right. Okay.

430
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,460
Food. Bread.

431
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,050
Okay. We're gonna have...

432
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,050
Let's get some sandwiches.

433
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,350
Wanna see me deal?

434
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,880
Wanna see me deal? Here we go.

435
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,590
There's two for you.
There's two for Robbie.

436
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,770
There's two for me, one for the house.

437
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,070
Okay.

438
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,400
Maybe after we eat something,
I'll go down and show you guys...

439
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,320
Teach you how to play some poker?
A little five-card stud?

440
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,540
- Maybe a little blackjack.
- I'm allergic to peanut butter.

441
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,030
Since when?

442
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,330
Birth.

443
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,870
Okay, well, here.

444
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,000
You can eat the bread. Okay?

445
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,550
I'm not hungry.

446
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,830
Okay, well,

447
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,250
Robbie and I are gonna be eating
peanut butter sandwiches.

448
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,420
- Want jelly on this sandwich?
- I'm not hungry either.

449
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,800
You're not hungry either? Okay.

450
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,190
Okay, that's fine.

451
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,270
Everybody just relax, okay?

452
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,860
Because we're here now.
We're safe, and we're gonna stay.

453
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,150
And in the morning,
your mom and Tim are gonna be here.

454
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,860
And everything's gonna be fine.

455
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Okay?

456
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
Okay.

457
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,790
If everything's fine, why do we
have to sleep in the basement?

458
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:57,210
- We've got perfectly good beds.
- Hey, it's like a slumber party.

459
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,800
What are you afraid
is gonna happen to us?

460
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,470
Nice basement.

461
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,810
I wanna sleep in my bed.
I've got back problems.

462
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,180
Okay. Well...

463
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,890
You know on the weather channel
when there's a tornado,

464
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,600
and they tell you to go down
to the basement for safety? It's like that.

465
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,730
- There's gonna be tornadoes?
- Okay, Rachel.

466
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,440
Hey, no more talking, okay?

467
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,480
- Could you be a little nicer to me?
- No more talking.

468
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,580
God.

469
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,830
- Wanna stay here?
- Yeah.

470
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,490
- Good.
- Good night. Love you.

471
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,340
Love you, Rach.

472
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,750
Is the lightning back?

473
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,250
No, this is something else.

474
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,510
- What's that sound?
- I've never heard that before!

475
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,020
Is it them? Is it them?

476
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,270
We got to go.

477
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,230
Where do we go?
Robbie, this is your house.

478
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,860
Where do we go?

479
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,540
No, no, no, wait!

480
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,020
Are we still alive?

481
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,470
Down here.

482
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,690
Were you on this plane?

483
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,150
Are you... Are you a passenger?

484
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,990
How you doing?
Wanna help me open this?

485
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,360
Are you a passenger?

486
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,240
He's deaf.

487
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:19,030
The shell went off right beside him.
Camera on his shoulder saved his life.

488
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,580
You hear that, Max?

489
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,460
Your stupid camera
saved your stupid life.

490
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,970
Where were you?

491
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,170
Out there in the Pine Barrens.

492
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,210
We were attached to
a National Guard unit.

493
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,880
The 83rd Mechanized.

494
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,260
They moved on one of those things
around midnight.

495
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,050
They've got some kind of shield
around them.

496
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,890
You can't see it, but everything
we fire at them detonates too early,

497
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,220
before we can get close enough
to cause any damage.

498
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,110
When they flash that thing,
everything lights up like Hiroshima.

499
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,990
There's more than one?

500
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,740
You got to be kidding me, right?

501
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,400
We were feeding New York,
but New York went dark.

502
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,950
So we patched over to DC,
they went down.

503
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:01,870
LA, Chicago, uplinked to London.

504
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:05,200
Even called the affiliates
to try to get them to catch the feed,

505
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,120
but nobody answers.
It's the same everywhere.

506
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,140
Once the Tripods start to move,
no more news comes out of that area.

507
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,590
My God.

508
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,990
You ain't seen nothing yet.

509
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,110
I saw that storm.
I was right in the middle of one of those.

510
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,900
Well, you didn't see it like this.

511
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,450
Those machines come up
from under the ground, right?

512
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,530
So that means they must've been
buried here a long time ago.

513
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,830
So who's driving the goddamn things?
Watch the lightning.

514
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:47,630
Watch it.

515
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,500
Watch the lightning.

516
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,840
Keep watching the lightning.

517
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,560
What is that?

518
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:02,970
That is them.
They come down in capsules,

519
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:06,020
riding the lightning into the ground,
into the machines, right?

520
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:10,980
You hear that?

521
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,490
We're getting the hell out of here.

522
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,660
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

523
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,330
Hey, were you on that plane?

524
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,710
That's too bad.
It would've been a really great story.

525
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,590
Look at me. Look at me.

526
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,000
You keep your eyes only on me,
understand?

527
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,060
- Okay.
- Don't look down. Don't look around me.

528
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,880
I'm taking you to the car.
You're gonna want to look around.

529
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,680
But you're not going to.

530
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,310
- Are you?
- No.

531
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,100
You're doing good. You're doing good.
Keep your eyes on me.

532
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,480
I'm going right to Boston.

533
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,890
- We're gonna see your mom.
- I'm not gonna look, Dad.

534
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,060
That's a girl. That's my girl. Now listen.

535
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,980
- I want you to close your eyes, okay?
- Okay.

536
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,530
Got them closed? There you go.

537
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,950
- Keep them closed for me.
- Okay.

538
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,790
Robbie, get in.

539
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,290
- Robbie, get in!
- Why are you yelling?

540
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,880
It's okay.

541
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:16,870
Get in.

542
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:39,940
- Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?
- Because I don't want everybody

543
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,570
to see that we've got a working car.
We'll stay along the Hudson

544
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,990
till we find an open bridge or ferry,
then we're gonna cross the Hudson.

545
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:50,330
We'll take the back roads across
Connecticut, all the way to Boston.

546
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:53,330
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, running, hiding.

547
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,630
- Hiding in their basements.
- If we had any balls, we'd go back there

548
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:59,380
- and find one of those things and kill it.
- Right. Yeah, good.

549
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,550
Why don't you just let me
make the big decisions, okay?

550
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,220
Which would be when? Never, Ray?

551
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,760
- Never's about your speed.
- Stop it, Robbie.

552
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,890
Enough of the "Ray" shit. All right?

553
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,390
- It's "Dad," "sir"...
- Don't fight!

554
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,600
...or if you want, "Mr. Ferrier."

555
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,990
That sounds a little weird to me,
but you decide.

556
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:17,360
- Dad?
- Yes, Rachel.

557
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,950
I've got to go to the bathroom.

558
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,190
Really?

559
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,200
- I got to go.
- Not so fast, not so fast, all right?

560
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,250
There's two things
we got to watch out for.

561
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,920
And the second is people
who might want our car.

562
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,760
- There's nobody around.
- Yeah. I got to go.

563
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,260
All right. Rachel?
Rachel, it's good right there.

564
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,640
I'm not going in front of you guys.

565
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,140
All right,
then just go where I can see you.

566
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,730
Are you crazy?

567
00:47:57,830 --> 00:47:59,810
- Don't look!
- Well, I'm not gonna look.

568
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,740
- Just stay in sight!
- That's looking!

569
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,030
Okay, well, listen, every time
you guys don't listen to me,

570
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:10,420
I'm telling your mother, okay?
I'm making a list.

571
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,630
Making a list.

572
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,380
- I told you to stay where I could see you.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

573
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,720
Stop! Don't go!

574
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,060
Wait! Stop! Let me on!

575
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,480
Let me on! Give me a hand!

576
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,160
Wait! Stop!

577
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,070
- Stop! Give me a hand!
- Hey, watch it, kid,

578
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,190
you're gonna get yourself run over!

579
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:28,240
- Give me a hand! You have room!
- Robbie!

580
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,320
- Robbie, you wanna go in that direction?
- Stop! Stop! Wait!

581
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,200
There's nothing living
in that direction, Robbie.

582
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,660
What do you care?
You never gave a shit before.

583
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,000
- You never gave a shit!
- Okay, hard-ass,

584
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,370
what's your plan, huh?
You're in charge now!

585
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,960
You tell me what we're doing.
What do we do?

586
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,420
We catch up with these soldiers!
Hook up with whoever else isn't dead,

587
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,960
and we get back at them.

588
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:50,510
We get back at them.
That's what we do.

589
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:54,930
Now let's try one that doesn't involve
your 1 O-year-old sister joining the Army.

590
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,260
- You have anything like that?
- Why don't you just tell us the truth?

591
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,520
- Wanna try something like that?
- You have no idea which way to go.

592
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,140
- You have anything like that?
- You wanna come off all wise and shit!

593
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,940
You only chose Boston
because you hoped Mom was there.

594
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,440
And if she's there,
you can dump us on her.

595
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:11,200
You can dump us on her, and then
you'll only have to care about yourself,

596
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,290
which is exactly the way you like it.

597
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:19,620
Robbie! Where are you trying to go?

598
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,170
What are you trying to do?

599
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,180
Who's gonna take care of me if you go?

600
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,240
This is a test of
the Emergency Alert System.

601
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:50,280
If this had been an actual emergency,
official messages

602
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,360
from federal, state or local authorities
would have followed the alert tone.

603
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,460
This concludes the test
of the Emergency Alert...

604
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,170
I'll close my eyes.
Why don't you drive for a bit?

605
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,920
I don't have a license.

606
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:08,390
Since when has that stopped you?

607
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Ray.

608
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:44,550
Ray! Dad!

609
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,250
You think you could...

610
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:53,060
You think you could...
Do you think you could...

611
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,300
Don't stop.

612
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,550
Don't take your foot off. Okay?

613
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,720
I got it, but keep your foot on.
Okay, I got it. I got it.

614
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,680
- Where is everybody going?
- I don't know, Rach.

615
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,890
But we do, right?

616
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,900
Yeah, we do.

617
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,330
Why did he do that?

618
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,580
- Why is he doing that?
- He wants a ride, Rach.

619
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,920
- Everybody just wants a ride
- Can we give him one?

620
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,630
Sit back and put on your seat belt.
Robbie, put on your seat belt.

621
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:34,680
Put on your seat belt, Rachel.

622
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,840
- Be careful.
- How'd you fix this?

623
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:42,190
- How'd you fix the car?
- Please!

624
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,270
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.

625
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:49,230
Please, get away from the car.

626
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,190
Hey! Stop the car.

627
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:54,030
- Stop the car!
- Get off the car!

628
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:57,150
You could carry 20 people in there!

629
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,610
- Stop the car!
- Get off the car!

630
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,370
Stop the car!

631
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,940
Hold on.

632
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,620
- Wait, wait.
- Look out. Look out.

633
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,300
Look out! Hold on!

634
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,430
Are you okay?

635
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,400
Stop!

636
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,070
- Ray!
- Robbie!

637
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,400
No, wait! Wait!

638
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,490
No! No, just wait! Okay! Wait! Stop!

639
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,570
- Just stop!
- Daddy!

640
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:42,070
Rachel!

641
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:44,580
Get out of there!

642
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,320
Robbie!

643
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,130
Daddy!

644
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,600
- Ray!
- Get in the car!

645
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,390
- Help!
- Rachel! Get out of the car!

646
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,600
Rachel, get... Get out of the car.

647
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,860
- Get out!
- Daddy!

648
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,700
- Take it easy!
- Get off the car! Get off the car!

649
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,870
Get off! Get off the car. Move! Move!

650
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:27,960
Where's my son?

651
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,040
You don't need that, man.
Put the gun down.

652
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,580
- Where's my son? Robbie!
- Cool down, man.

653
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,960
- Put the gun down, man.
- Robbie!

654
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,630
Put it down.

655
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,680
Dad!

656
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,890
Okay, man, now, listen.

657
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,100
- Put down the gun. I'm taking the car.
- My daughter's in the car.

658
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,310
- Put down the gun. I'm taking the car.
- Please. All I want...

659
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:53,060
- Put down the goddamn gun!
- All I want is my daughter.

660
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,690
- I'm taking the car, man.
- Please, I just want my daughter.

661
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:57,730
Please, let me...
Let me just take my daughter. Can I...

662
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:59,360
- All I want is my daughter.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

663
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,690
- Go ahead, man. Take her.
- Take my daughter?

664
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:01,760
Take her. Yeah. Yeah.

665
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,240
Robbie.

666
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,670
Take me with you.

667
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,310
Have you seen this girl?
This is my daughter.

668
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:21,160
He needs his medicine.

669
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,990
We've got it the worst,
that's what I heard.

670
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,160
The US, mostly.
South America and Asia, some.

671
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,960
There's nothing going on in Europe.

672
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,750
Europe got the worst of it,
that's what everybody's saying.

673
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:44,340
- Completely wiped out some of it.
- I don't give a shit who it is.

674
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,880
I got up close to one of those things
in Stanfordville.

675
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,840
If they're all over the place, we're dead.

676
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,800
- Looks like the power's still on here.
- Yeah.

677
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,940
Yeah, power's still on.

678
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:57,020
Because nothing bad's come up
from the ground.

679
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,450
- Hold on. Hold on, move back.
- Watch out there, lady.

680
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,950
I said, move back.

681
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,690
Unless you are O-positive
and Rh-negative, thank you very much,

682
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,780
but we already have
more blood than we can use.

683
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,360
Again, if you are O-positive,

684
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,990
Rh-negative, identify yourselves.

685
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:56,200
If you are not, thank you very much.

686
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,330
We already have more blood
than we can use for the transfusions.

687
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:01,500
Let's go, folks.

688
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,500
This way. This way. Keep it moving.

689
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,800
Keep it moving. This way.
Let's go, folks. Keep it moving.

690
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:13,140
Please move forward calmly.
The boat can make more than one trip.

691
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,510
Please move forward calmly.
Take your time. Don't rush.

692
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:19,890
Ray! Ray! Ray!

693
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:22,440
- Sheryl?
- Yeah. Hey.

694
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,230
Oh, my gosh, is this your...

695
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:25,650
- Are these your kids?
- This is Rachel.

696
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:28,440
Hi, I'm Sheryl. How are you?
This is my daughter, Nora.

697
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,940
- Nora. I've heard about you, Nora.
- Hi.

698
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,960
- This is my son, Robbie.
- Just like Dad.

699
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:52,010
- It's good to see you as well.
- Trees are funny.

700
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:56,520
We're gonna move a few cars out
of the way to make some more space.

701
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,640
You're gonna have to give us
a few minutes.

702
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:02,690
But don't worry,
there'll be plenty of room for everybody.

703
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,240
- We got sick people here. Let us on.
- Let us on, for Christ's sake.

704
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:43,980
Cast off. Get that ramp up.

705
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,190
Cast off now. Get that ramp up.

706
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:48,520
Cast off.

707
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,580
No more people. No more people.
We're taking the ramp up.

708
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:20,720
Stay close. Stay close.

709
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,560
Everybody, stop. Everybody, stop.

710
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:26,980
- Wait, wait, wait. Just...
- Back up. Back up.

711
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,230
- There's room.
- Just stay back.

712
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:29,900
There's no more room.
There's no more room.

713
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,570
Just listen to me. There's three of us.

714
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,440
- Five. There's only five of us.
- There's no more room.

715
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:35,900
Okay, man, just don't push me.

716
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,240
- Sir, there's no more room.
- There is plenty of room.

717
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,780
- There's room for hundreds more.
- Sir...

718
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,990
- Everybody, wait.
- Hold on.

719
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:43,450
- You just stay with me.
- Okay.

720
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:44,870
Grab my jacket.

721
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:46,540
Everybody, back up.

722
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,750
Back up.

723
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:49,420
I got you, Ferrier.

724
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,250
- Oh, Jesus.
- You okay?

725
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,380
- Yeah.
- Come on. Come.

726
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,010
- Okay. Jesus. Oh, my God.
- Come on. Come on.

727
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:57,020
Watch out.

728
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:05,360
Come on.

729
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:08,310
- Move. Move. Move.
- Ray.

730
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:09,410
Ray!

731
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,530
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Move it! Get out of here!

732
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:17,150
Go. I can go with him.

733
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,650
Sheryl?

734
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,070
- Stay back.
- Go with them. Go.

735
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:22,240
- Ray.
- Sheryl?

736
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,080
- Everybody...
- Sheryl?

737
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,950
- There's room on the boat.
- Let us through, God damn it.

738
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:29,120
- There's still room on the boat.
- She's a child.

739
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,920
- Robbie.
- There's room on the...

740
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,210
There's still room on the boat.
There's room on the boat.

741
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:34,340
Up there!

742
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:41,180
- Robbie.
- Just stay with me.

743
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,310
Stay with me, Robbie.

744
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:48,420
Robbie!

745
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,840
- Robbie. Robbie.
- Robbie.

746
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,340
Robbie!

747
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,840
- Robbie.
- Come on.

748
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,350
Here. Grab my hand.

749
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:28,310
Here. Hold on.

750
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,680
I got you. Hold on.

751
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,600
Take my hand.

752
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,860
Take it. Take my hand.

753
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,960
Here!

754
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,000
Oh, my God.

755
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,160
Robbie!

756
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:05,450
Swim. Swim this way.

757
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:15,340
- Robbie!
- Robbie!

758
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,050
- Help me. Help me with her.
- Here, Rach.

759
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:07,430
Don't stop. Don't stop.

760
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,430
Don't stop.

761
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,370
Oh, my God.

762
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,890
Robbie, slow down.

763
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,610
Robbie, slow down.

764
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:01,670
- Robbie.
- We gotta stay together, Robbie.

765
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,160
Robbie?

766
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:06,920
Stay together.

767
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:08,420
Robbie!

768
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:14,100
Get back here!

769
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,010
Robbie!

770
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,440
No, Robbie! Come back!

771
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,640
Robbie.

772
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,900
Don't move. Don't move.

773
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,910
Now, for God's sake, stay right here.
I'm coming right back.

774
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:39,830
- Robbie!
- Stop those people.

775
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,920
- Turn around. Turn around.
- Robbie.

776
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:44,450
Robbie.

777
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:47,130
What the hell?

778
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,260
Why are you doing this?

779
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,140
Pull back.
Five hundred meters to my 10 o'clock.

780
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:00,310
Jekyll, no effect on target. No effect.

781
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,850
Roger. No effect.

782
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:04,640
Our mission, Lieutenant,
is to delay their advance

783
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:08,070
till those refugees get to safety.
Now, keep firing.

784
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:12,660
You've gotta listen. Turn around!
I want you to listen to me.

785
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,860
Listen to me.

786
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,410
Go back down the hill.

787
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:20,790
All of you, just turn around.

788
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:35,380
- Don't do this. I know you wanna fight.
- I wanna be here.

789
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,300
- I need to see this.
- I know it seems like you have to,

790
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,470
- but you don't. You don't.
- Please, let me go.

791
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:42,970
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

792
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:45,060
What are you doing here all by yourself?

793
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,640
Look, sweetie,
you gotta come with us, please.

794
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,730
No. My dad's getting my brother.
I have to stay here.

795
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:50,020
- You can't stay here.
- We gotta go.

796
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,730
- I'm not gonna leave her alone.
- Leave.

797
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:54,150
I'm not letting you do this.
You can hate me.

798
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,110
- You can hate me. But I love you.
- Let me go. Please.

799
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:57,950
- Let me go. Dad.
- I'm not letting you do this.

800
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,660
I can't. No. Please. Please don't pull me.

801
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,240
It's gonna be okay. You need
to come with us. It is not safe...

802
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,450
Please, let me stay here. Please.
I can't go with you.

803
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:07,080
- My dad's right there.
- Please, come.

804
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,080
- Please, my dad's right there.
- Will you just listen to me?

805
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:11,960
I need to be here. I want to see this.

806
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,550
Wait. Wait. Just stay for Rachel.
Stay for your sister.

807
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:18,180
Please, let me go.
You need to let me go.

808
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,850
All right. Okay. All right.
You're coming with us.

809
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,100
- We gotta go! Now!
- Dad.

810
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,100
- We're going now.
- No, no, you don't understand.

811
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,200
Dad!

812
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:32,570
Dad!

813
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:35,030
Dad!

814
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,130
Let me go! Dad!

815
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:49,590
Guide on. Guide on. Black Six.
Attack. Attack. Attack.

816
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,840
Stop.

817
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,800
- That's my dad.
- I'm her father. I'm her father.

818
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,630
- We're so sorry.
- We thought she was alone.

819
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:01,560
- She was standing by the tree...
- She's fine. Let's go! Let's go!

820
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:07,070
Robbie.

821
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,640
Robbie!

822
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,210
Over here.

823
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:40,770
Over here!

824
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:45,590
Hurry.

825
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:07,330
Are you all right?

826
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:08,710
Hey.

827
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:13,130
What about you, huh?

828
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:28,810
There you go.

829
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,360
Is that comfortable?

830
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,900
I need you to close your eyes
now, okay?

831
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,820
You need some sleep.

832
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,200
Dad?

833
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:44,500
He's gonna meet us.

834
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,910
Hey. Robbie's gonna meet us, Rach.

835
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:50,450
In Boston, at your grandma's.

836
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:53,710
What do you think
Mom's doing right this minute?

837
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:54,810
Mom?

838
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:58,720
Boston. She's waiting.

839
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:02,630
And I know she's not sleeping,
because she is so worried about you.

840
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:06,100
And she's in Grandma's kitchen,
and she's...

841
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:10,850
She's making that awful tea she makes.

842
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:12,820
And they're all just...

843
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,860
They're all just counting the minutes
until they see you again.

844
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:21,990
What is this? What is this?

845
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:25,280
- I won.
- You won?

846
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,660
The walk, trot and canter.

847
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:29,790
Third place.

848
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:40,840
Sing me Lullaby and Goodnight.

849
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,890
I don't know that one.

850
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:49,980
Sing me Hushabye Mountain.

851
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,990
I'm sorry, Rach. I don't...
I don't know that one either.

852
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:21,550
I'm not bragging, babe
So don't put me down

853
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:25,310
'Cause I got the fastest
Set of wheels in town

854
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:28,600
Something comes up to me
They don't even try

855
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:33,770
'Cause if I had a set of wings
Man, you know she could fly

856
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:36,610
She's my little deuce coupe

857
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:39,940
You don't know what I got

858
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:43,530
Just my little deuce coupe

859
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:48,290
You don't know what I got

860
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:58,290
Peach schnapps.

861
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:01,970
Disgusting, I know it.
Found a whole case of this shit.

862
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,850
Thank you.

863
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:18,100
I'm sorry about your son.

864
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,770
We got separated. He's...

865
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,990
He's gonna meet us in Boston.

866
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:31,000
Did you...

867
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:35,500
Did you lose anybody?

868
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,340
All of them.

869
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:44,680
Harlan Ogilvy.

870
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,000
Ray Ferrier.

871
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,760
I got water.

872
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:52,350
Food enough for weeks.

873
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:55,940
You're welcome to stay. Both of you.

874
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,810
I'm sorry.

875
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,900
I'm gonna get some sleep.

876
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:07,620
Those machines,
those Tripods they got,

877
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,660
they buried them.

878
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:14,460
Right under our feet.

879
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:17,960
Since before there...

880
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:20,550
There were even people here.

881
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:24,220
They've been planning this
for a million years.

882
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:29,050
- We're beat to shit.
- Please.

883
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:31,430
- My daughter...
- Think about it.

884
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:38,010
They defeated the greatest power
in the world in a couple days.

885
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:40,310
Walked right over us.

886
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:43,610
And these are only the first.
They'll keep coming.

887
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:45,940
This is not a war

888
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:49,280
any more than there's
a war between men and maggots.

889
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:51,740
This is an extermination.

890
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:03,760
You afraid?

891
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,720
Of course I am.

892
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:12,510
I been around death plenty.

893
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:15,590
I drive an ambulance in the city...

894
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:18,140
Drove an ambulance in the city.

895
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:20,480
That's all over now, huh?

896
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:26,740
You know the people that make it, Ray?

897
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:30,530
The ones that don't flatline
before the hospital?

898
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:35,700
It's the ones that keep their eyes open.

899
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:39,290
That keep looking at you. Keep thinking.

900
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,380
They're the ones that survive.

901
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,210
We can't lose our heads, Ray.

902
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:49,470
Running.

903
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:52,180
That's what'll kill you.

904
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:56,470
And I'm dead set on living.

905
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:04,110
Dead set on living...

906
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,990
Thank you for taking us in.

907
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,250
Not gonna be exterminated.

908
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:37,270
It's okay. Come on.
I wanna show you something.

909
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:41,590
We're gonna fight them, Ray.
They got to have a weakness.

910
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,350
Come. Take a look.

911
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,690
Somehow they killed a few of these
things in Osaka. That's what I heard.

912
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:57,530
You telling me the Japanese
can figure it out, but we can't?

913
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:59,110
We can do this, Ray.

914
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:01,070
We can do it. We can get them.

915
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:03,040
We can figure it out.

916
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,380
Stay right there.

917
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:26,640
I have a daughter.

918
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:28,140
Why did you bring us here?

919
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:31,060
To fight them together, Ray.

920
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,660
Now we'll be the ones coming up
from underground.

921
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,190
When the time is right,

922
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:41,490
take them by surprise,
the way they took us.

923
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:43,830
Take them by surprise.

924
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,450
We're right under their feet, Ray.

925
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:49,420
Right here. Under their feet.

926
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:39,970
You miss your mommy?

927
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,560
I had a little girl.

928
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,980
Nearly your age.

929
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:50,560
You know, if anything happens
to your daddy, I'll take care of you.

930
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:51,860
Rachel.

931
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:04,000
You don't have anything to say to her.
Do you understand?

932
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:06,410
If you wanna talk to somebody,

933
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,160
if you wanna ask a question,
you ask me.

934
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:10,740
What exactly is your plan, Ray?

935
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,750
I know what I'm gonna do.
How about you?

936
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:17,010
You gonna sit here?
Wait for them to come get you?

937
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:19,180
Is that your plan?

938
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:23,060
Maybe you want to get caught.

939
01:20:23,390 --> 01:20:26,930
Couple days hiding in a basement
too much for you, I bet.

940
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,560
You'll probably turn yourself right in.

941
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,190
Listen.

942
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:38,400
- It stopped.
- Maybe you'll be okay.

943
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,360
Maybe you'll get lucky,
and they'll train you as their pet.

944
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:44,490
You know, feed you,
train you how to do tricks.

945
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,580
Will you shut up and listen?

946
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:51,370
No.

947
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,550
Give me that.

948
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,860
You and me,

949
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:57,150
I don't think we're on the same page.

950
01:29:33,650 --> 01:29:35,450
Ray. Ray-

951
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:39,190
Ray. Ray. Ray!

952
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:40,290
Ray!

953
01:29:41,070 --> 01:29:43,990
Keep your voice down. Quiet!

954
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:28,120
Not my blood. Not my blood.

955
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,000
Not my blood.

956
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,760
Not my...

957
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:37,380
Not

958
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:39,960
"my-"

959
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:44,430
Not my blood.

960
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:47,740
Not my blood.

961
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:51,730
Not my blood.

962
01:30:51,890 --> 01:30:53,550
- Not my blood.
- Stop it.

963
01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:56,470
- Stop it.
- Not my blood.

964
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:58,180
You gotta be quiet.

965
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:00,390
- You want them to hear you?
- They drink us.

966
01:31:00,490 --> 01:31:02,390
- Please, they'll hear you.
- They drink us.

967
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:05,560
Then they spray us, like fertilizer.

968
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:06,900
You gotta be quiet.

969
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,820
- Drink us, and...
- They're gonna come back down here.

970
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,070
Then they spit us out all over
the goddamn red weeds.

971
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:15,000
Do you understand
what I'm gonna have to do?

972
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,080
I can't let my daughter die
because of you.

973
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:19,200
This tunnel will get us to the city.

974
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:20,950
We'll have our own tunnels there.
Ready-made.

975
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:22,500
- Stop it.
- Subway. See what I'm saying?

976
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,080
- We can hide a whole army down there.
- Stop it.

977
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:25,920
We'll go underground.
Sneak attacks at night.

978
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:29,420
Stop. Stop. You stop it!

979
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,760
We're the resistance, Ray.
They can't occupy this country.

980
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:34,300
Occupations always fail.

981
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,550
History's taught us that
a thousand times.

982
01:31:36,650 --> 01:31:38,850
This is our land.

983
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:42,390
We eat it, we breathe it,
only we can live on it.

984
01:31:42,490 --> 01:31:45,280
They can't survive here, Ray.
They weren't built for it.

985
01:31:46,030 --> 01:31:49,150
- They're gonna kill you, brother, not me!
- What are you doing?

986
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:51,150
- Not my blood!
- What are you doing, Dad?

987
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:54,450
Whatever you hear, don't take this off.

988
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:56,200
- Dad?
- Rach?

989
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,740
- Dad?
- What was that song?

990
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:02,450
- That lullaby that I didn't know?
- Not my blood!

991
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:04,620
- Hushabye Mountain?
- Yeah, sing it.

992
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:07,460
- They can take you!
- Please, Rach, sing it.

993
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:08,960
They can take you!

994
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,550
A gentle breeze

995
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:13,260
- Your daughter! Not me!
- Don't stop.

996
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:15,260
On Hushabye Mountain

997
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,800
- They're gonna kill you!
- That's my girl.

998
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:21,570
Softly blows over Lullaby Bay

999
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,770
Forget it! Tunnel!

1000
01:32:23,870 --> 01:32:26,860
It fills the sails

1001
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:30,160
Of boats that are waiting

1002
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:36,750
Waiting to sail your worries away

1003
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:42,040
So close your eyes

1004
01:32:42,710 --> 01:32:46,330
On Hushabye Mountain

1005
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:51,260
Wave goodbye to cares of the day

1006
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:57,180
And watch your boat
From Hushabye Mountain

1007
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:03,440
Sail far away
From Lullaby Bay

1008
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,240
Rachel?

1009
01:34:57,890 --> 01:34:59,290
Rachel?

1010
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:02,180
Oh, my God, no.

1011
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:06,610
Rachel? Rachel?

1012
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:08,900
Rachel? Rachel?

1013
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:22,750
Rachel? Make some noise, baby.

1014
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:24,210
Rachel?

1015
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:27,150
Rachel?

1016
01:35:32,010 --> 01:35:34,760
Rachel? Just talk to me, baby. Come on.

1017
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:39,910
Rachel?

1018
01:35:43,230 --> 01:35:44,630
Rachel?

1019
01:35:58,990 --> 01:36:00,390
Rachel!

1020
01:37:09,730 --> 01:37:12,610
No, no, no! No!

1021
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:45,140
Hey!

1022
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:26,100
Help!

1023
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:32,190
What is happening?

1024
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:35,770
Rachel!

1025
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:09,040
Rachel.

1026
01:39:09,650 --> 01:39:12,270
Rachel. Rachel.

1027
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:14,670
Rachel.

1028
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:17,840
Rachel.

1029
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:20,630
Rachel.

1030
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:22,940
Dad.

1031
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:51,710
No! No!

1032
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:55,890
- Pull me! Pull me!
- No!

1033
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,600
Pull! Pull!

1034
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,820
- Pull me.
- Come on, pull!

1035
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:13,360
- Dad!
- One, two, three...

1036
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:15,150
- We got him!
- We got you.

1037
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:16,830
Keep pulling!

1038
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:26,970
Everybody down!

1039
01:41:19,230 --> 01:41:21,100
Keep it moving, folks.

1040
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:26,110
Keep going, sir. Keep moving.

1041
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,990
- Oh, God.
- I don't know what's going on.

1042
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:32,740
Hold Grandma's hand.

1043
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:38,330
Let's go, folks. Keep moving forward.

1044
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:50,220
Put that down.

1045
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:55,560
Right this way, ma'am.
Right this way. Thank you.

1046
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:06,690
To the left, there, ma'am,
just to your left. Thank you.

1047
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:10,950
What happened to it?

1048
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:16,410
It's dying.

1049
01:42:18,870 --> 01:42:20,580
Keep moving forward.

1050
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:32,830
Keep moving. It's all right.

1051
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:34,500
You can pass on through. Move along.

1052
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:35,670
- What happened here?
- I don't know.

1053
01:42:35,770 --> 01:42:37,760
Something's happening to them.
Please, keep moving.

1054
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:39,390
- Let's go, move out.
- Let's go, people.

1055
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:43,020
- Something's happening to them.
- Go. Go, just keep moving, sir.

1056
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:44,180
Let's go, sir. Let's go.

1057
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:45,720
Do not stop. Keep moving. Keep moving.

1058
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:47,140
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What's happened here?

1059
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:49,770
- Did you guys take it down?
- No, sir, it was behaving erratically,

1060
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:52,560
walking in circles, then it went down
on its own about an hour ago.

1061
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:55,770
Now, please, let's go. Let's go.
Keep moving. Come on. Don't stop.

1062
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:57,950
Do not stop! Let's go! Thank you!

1063
01:42:59,450 --> 01:43:01,370
How is it dead all by itself?

1064
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:04,160
- Rachel, I'm not sure.
- Coming through.

1065
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:07,340
Coming through. Make a hole.
Coming through.

1066
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:29,270
Calm down.
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

1067
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:30,930
Calm down and get in the tunnel.
Calm down.

1068
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:32,900
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

1069
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:47,910
Everybody, calm down.
Get in the tunnel.

1070
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:50,920
Everybody, on the other side
of the tracks!

1071
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:55,710
Look at the birds!

1072
01:43:55,810 --> 01:43:57,340
I can't hear you!

1073
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,260
Look at the goddamn birds!

1074
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:05,470
- No shield!
- I can't hear!

1075
01:44:05,570 --> 01:44:07,400
No shield!

1076
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,770
The Javelin's the key!

1077
01:44:13,870 --> 01:44:16,650
Load the Gustav!
It's gonna be a tough kill!

1078
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:18,360
Let's go!

1079
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:21,360
It's safer in here.

1080
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:23,400
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1081
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,120
Bring out the Javelin!

1082
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:36,260
Clear! Go from behind! Clear!

1083
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:47,890
- Let me know when you're tracking!
- Tracking!

1084
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,510
- You got a lock?
- I got a lock!

1085
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:51,310
Fire the Javelin!

1086
01:44:58,030 --> 01:45:00,410
- I got a lock!
- Fire the Javelin!

1087
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:04,580
Fire!

1088
01:45:19,630 --> 01:45:21,430
It's okay.

1089
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:24,510
I love you.

1090
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:27,020
- It's okay. You're gonna be okay.
- Let's go!

1091
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,930
Keep those civilians out of there.

1092
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:34,860
Back. Stay back!
Come on, folks, back up!

1093
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:43,110
Come on, guys, get on the line.
Get up there now.

1094
01:45:43,210 --> 01:45:46,120
- Stay back. Stay right here, huh?
- Hold on right there.

1095
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:55,170
- It's opening.
- It's opening. Keep them back.

1096
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:35,660
Clear!

1097
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:39,550
No, keep them back. Keep them back.
Come on, stay back.

1098
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:16,120
Mom!

1099
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:45,780
Thank you.

1100
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:10,930
- Robbie?
- Robbie?

1101
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:18,980
Hi, Dad.

1102
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:21,580
Hi, Dad.

1103
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,000
Hi, Dad.

1104
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:00,800
From the moment the invaders arrived,

1105
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:04,480
breathed our air, ate and drank,

1106
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:06,240
they were doomed.

1107
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:10,480
They were undone, destroyed,

1108
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:13,870
after all of man's weapons
and devices had failed,

1109
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:19,170
by the tiniest creatures that God
in his wisdom put upon this Earth.

1110
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:23,950
By the toll of a billion deaths,
man had earned his immunity,

1111
01:49:24,050 --> 01:49:28,630
his right to survive among
this planet's infinite organisms.

1112
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:33,430
And that right is ours
against all challenges,

1113
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:38,900
for neither do men live, nor die, in vain.
