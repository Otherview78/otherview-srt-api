1
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,625
Perfect. That was perfect.

2
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,833
And upload.

3
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,666
Okay, and…

4
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,666
Time to start another boring day.

5
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,166
Here you are.

6
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,375
Thank you.

7
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,625
{\an8}Here you go.

8
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,833
{\an8}OPEN

9
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,166
{\an8}A very good morning. How can I be of help?

10
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,041
{\an8}Now, listen up, young man!

11
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,708
{\an8}In the old days everything was better, far better…

12
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,125
CLOSED

13
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,916
I'm taking my lunch break.

14
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,958
Wait.

15
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,458
Hello, I'm…

16
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,500
I'm not sure if this is the right address,

17
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,500
but I'm here for a very secret issue.

18
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,583
Do you understand?

19
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,291
Okay, come on Sebastian, you can do it.

20
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,541
You can do it.

21
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,291
Thank you.

22
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:29,916
Thanks.

23
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,000
Damn it!

24
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:29,375
In Nevada, a virus outbreak of unknown origin continues to spread,

25
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:34,000
causing a rabies-like response in those who contract it.

26
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:38,666
This has led to the public deeming the outbreak "the zombie apocalypse."

27
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,041
Amidst the epidemic, groups of civilians are stepping up to do their part

28
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,833
in helping to rescue survivors stuck in the infected zone.

29
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,875
{\an8}Let's check in with one of our correspondents,

30
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:52,333
{\an8}Gil Pedretti, on the ground in Las Vegas.

31
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,458
Dear viewers,

32
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:09,083
I can't tell you exactly what's going on right now,

33
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:12,416
but as you just saw, this is reality.

34
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,375
This was really happening.

35
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:19,458
As we get more information,

36
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:22,916
we will certainly give you an immediate update.

37
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,541
That movie looks fucking awesome.

38
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,375
Would you like to see it?

39
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,916
It's not out yet.

40
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:52,416
Excuse me, sir. Could you hold these, please?

41
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,541
-My pleasure. -Very kind.

42
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:04,375
I have an appointment for the deposit room.

43
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:06,125
Yes, please wait.

44
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,000
That way, please.

45
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,208
I'll leave you to it.

46
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:39,291
You speak English? A little bit?

47
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:40,875
No.

48
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:42,791
Just a moment.

49
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,125
You speak English? A little bit?

50
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,375
Of course.

51
00:36:58,541 --> 00:37:00,083
So sorry.

52
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:42,541
Awesome!

53
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:04,041
Yes.

54
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,041
Silence!

55
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:17,750
I did it. Yes!

56
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,250
I'm a master!

57
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:23,250
LUDWIG DIETER MASTER SAFECRACKER AND EXPLORER

58
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:21,291
Hi.

59
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:25,166
Pavel, for the last time, you can't drink in here.

60
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,000
-Did you see that? -Where did he go?

61
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:38,958
He disappears.

62
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,250
Just pretend.

63
01:02:51,291 --> 01:02:53,083
Show me your ID.

64
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:32,375
-Something's not right here. -Yes, I'm inclined to agree.

65
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:36,125
I'm not missing our shot. If they're inside…

66
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:39,833
We're going to catch them.

67
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:52,166
Got him. Cam 52.

68
01:06:54,875 --> 01:06:55,833
What the fuck!

69
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:58,291
Someone's in our system.

70
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:42,416
Shit.

71
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,125
Okay! Let's go!

72
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:50,916
What? Shit!

73
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,375
What the fuck was that?

74
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:05,000
Fucking Christ!

75
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:31,083
Shit.

76
01:12:09,416 --> 01:12:10,500
Damn it.

77
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:39,375
Freeze!

78
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:40,833
Hands up!

79
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:43,125
Slowly.

80
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:52,000
Where are you?

81
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:00,500
Fucking asshole.

82
01:17:32,625 --> 01:17:33,666
Stop!

83
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:35,250
Police!

84
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:46,250
That's my bike!

85
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:49,041
Fuck you, asshole!

86
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:53,958
Shit.

87
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:15,708
Going to Old Town.

88
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:32,500
Watch out!

89
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:41,500
We lost him.

90
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:42,625
Out of the way!

91
01:19:19,541 --> 01:19:22,125
Make way!

92
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:05,125
Crazy! How did I do that?

93
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:15,750
Stop the car!

94
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:38,625
Fuck off!

95
01:26:45,541 --> 01:26:47,875
Shit, shit, shit!

96
01:30:50,166 --> 01:30:53,125
Hello, my dear friends. It's me again, your great safecracker.

97
01:30:53,875 --> 01:30:56,000
I hope you don't mind, but the video today…

98
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:56,958
I know him.

99
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:00,500
I know this guy.

100
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,291
Oh, fuck! This is the same guy.

101
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:17,708
Come to my office, please.

102
01:31:17,791 --> 01:31:18,791
Yes. Now.

103
01:31:22,416 --> 01:31:23,958
I found you.

104
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:29,333
Yes.

105
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:34,083
So I hope this is super important news because I--

106
01:31:34,166 --> 01:31:35,000
That's him.

107
01:31:36,458 --> 01:31:39,541
The guy who opens safes, the safecracker, that's him.

108
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
This guy comes out of nowhere. A German guy who makes shitty Youtube videos.

109
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:46,083
He's not a criminal.

110
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:47,958
He's an outsider.

111
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:50,916
Then who is this guy? How does he know them?

112
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,416
They found him like this,

113
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:54,916
through YouTube.

114
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:56,708
-Okay. -Yeah.

115
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,083
Maybe he's a patsy.

116
01:31:59,166 --> 01:32:01,208
Look at the poor guy. They just dumped him on the road.

117
01:32:01,291 --> 01:32:03,375
He's scared shitless like Bambi.

118
01:32:05,458 --> 01:32:08,541
I almost feel bad for him.

119
01:32:11,041 --> 01:32:12,208
And that's all?

120
01:32:17,125 --> 01:32:18,958
-What? Yes, that's all. -That's all?

121
01:32:19,041 --> 01:32:19,875
Yes, that's all.

122
01:32:20,916 --> 01:32:22,458
Super important information.

123
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:24,458
You could have told me over the phone.

124
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:30,125
Nice to meet you, Sebastian.

125
01:36:01,083 --> 01:36:02,666
We are informed about the risk.

126
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:05,666
-What do you mean? -Please follow me.

127
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:17,541
-Who told you about the risk? -You.

128
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:20,541
And when you contacted us, we took action immediately.

129
01:36:21,666 --> 01:36:23,750
What do you mean when we contacted you?

130
01:36:23,833 --> 01:36:26,208
You did. And as agreed, we brought transport time forward.

131
01:36:26,291 --> 01:36:28,916
The safe left an hour and a half ago.

132
01:36:33,916 --> 01:36:37,166
-You brought the transport time forward? -Yes.

133
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:40,041
Last night, when you informed us of the risk.

134
01:36:40,958 --> 01:36:43,750
But the transport is already underway.

135
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:48,166
See, I told you it was too good to be true.

136
01:36:49,375 --> 01:36:50,375
Why?

137
01:36:54,416 --> 01:36:56,666
It was planned for 5:00.

138
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:06,916
Hello. This is Interpol.

139
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,416
Are you aware that the safe scheduled for transfer tomorrow morning

140
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,208
is the third in a sequence of safes,

141
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:15,625
two of which have been robbed in the last 72 hours?

142
01:37:15,708 --> 01:37:16,875
One moment, please.

143
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,750
Call the bank.

144
01:37:19,833 --> 01:37:23,000
See if they'll authorize us moving the vault sooner than planned.

145
01:37:23,083 --> 01:37:24,041
Of course.

146
01:37:24,125 --> 01:37:27,000
Call me if there's a problem. You're welcome.

147
01:41:58,708 --> 01:42:02,041
Five o'clock!

148
01:44:56,958 --> 01:44:58,416
-Let her… -Where the hell are they?

149
01:44:58,500 --> 01:44:59,750
Let her! Let her go! Stop it!

150
01:53:29,333 --> 01:53:30,875
Delacroix, asshole.
