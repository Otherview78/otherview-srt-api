00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,750
[man] <i>Gatekeeper, this is Mothership.</i>

2
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,916
<i>The Four Horsemen are on the gallop.</i>

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,625
<i>You are a go to open the stable door.
I repeat, open the stable door.</i>

4
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,541
[woman] <i>The payload is secure,</i>
<i>and the Horsemen are en route.</i>

5
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:51,875
[bride] Make sure I look cute.

6
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,541
- [groom] Whoo!
- [bride] Get in here.

7
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:54,708
[groom] Vegas, baby.

8
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:55,708
[bride] Vegas!

9
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,375
[groom] Go, baby. Yeah.

10
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,625
- [bride] We did it!
- [groom] Yeah.

11
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,583
I think it went. Go, baby.

12
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,208
Let's go. Let's go.

13
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,541
[laughs] Whoo!

14
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,375
- [bride] Get out of here!
- [groom] Yeah!

15
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,541
[bride] I love life, bitches!

16
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,541
Love, love, love…

17
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,500
What are you doing?
Get in here. I feel it!

18
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,375
[soldier 1] Any idea
what the hell we're hauling?

19
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,375
Why we need
all this firepower to protect it?

20
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,458
[soldier 2] Could be anything
from a briefcase nuke

21
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,791
to the original copy of the Constitution

22
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,291
but the one written
in the Founding Fathers' blood.

23
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,041
Right. Or like, uh…

24
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:47,500
…Bigfoot.

25
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:50,541
I was thinking more like
headpiece to the Staff of Ra

26
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:55,041
or, uh, Amelia Earhart but alive.

27
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,625
- So, the less you know, the better.
- True.

28
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:01,541
I got you a little present for making
an honest woman out of me.

29
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,458
[chuckles] Okay. What?
Wait, what are you talking about?

30
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,875
Oh.

31
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,208
Oh, yeah.

32
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,291
Okay.

33
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,458
Get in there. All right.

34
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,958
You are in trouble now, mister.

35
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,315
[soldier 1] All right, I've got one.

36
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:32,583
How about the lunar lander
that was supposedly left on the moon?

37
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,500
[soldier 2] Yeah, I like
the thematic extraterrestrial reference,

38
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,833
seeing as we're just coming
from, uh… Well, you know.

39
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,333
- So you're saying there's a chance.
- Chance of what?

40
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,875
Chance we're hauling a… Well, you know.

41
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:45,916
The Holy Grail.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,875
Yeah, could be the Grail.

43
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,458
Not the "Grail" Grail

44
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,416
but the Holy Grail of things
we shouldn't be hauling.

45
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,791
You're gonna just make me say it out loud?

46
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,083
I honestly don't…
I mean, you're being cryptic.

47
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,541
Oh, wow.

48
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,500
Area 51.

49
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,541
Secret hangar. Autopsy.

50
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,000
All right, I'll say it. It's an alien.

51
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,416
- Oh, my God!
- Look out!

52
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,875
[soldier 3] Blackwing's hurt.

53
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,250
Come on, guys. Hustle up.

54
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,101
- Let's get this thing out!
- [soldier 3] Hurry up!

55
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,208
[soldier 4] Get this one. Hustle, hustle.

56
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,958
[soldier 5] Multiple DOAs, sir.

57
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,000
Never mind. They're dead in there.
Let's get to this one. Come on.

58
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,434
- [soldier 6] Guys, get to payload two!
- [soldier 7] Copy that!

59
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,625
Mothership, this is
the Four Horsemen. Do you copy?

60
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,666
[woman] <i>Copy. Go ahead, Horsemen.</i>

61
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,916
We're in an emergency situation,
Mothership. Requesting support.

62
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,750
[woman] <i>Copy, Horsemen.</i>

63
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,208
<i>What is the nature of your emergency?</i>

64
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,125
We've been
in a serious accident, Mothership.

65
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,416
We got numerous fatalities for sure.

66
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,875
We need a medevac ASAP.

67
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,083
[woman]<i> Copy that, Horsemen.</i>
<i>Dispatching medevac now.</i>

68
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,708
<i>Keep your comms open
while I contact the medevac.</i>

69
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,826
[woman] <i>Horsemen, what is</i>
<i>the condition of the payload?</i>

70
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,583
The payload.

71
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,291
Uh…

72
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,791
Yeah, payload is compromised.

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,875
Looks like it's busted open
in the middle of the highway.

74
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,416
[woman] <i>Stand by, Horsemen.</i>

75
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,500
<i>All right, listen carefully.</i>

76
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,291
<i>Gather whoever can walk or move
and get away from the payload immediately.</i>

77
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,458
Wait, what are you telling me to do?

78
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,708
[woman]<i> Shut the fuck up and listen to me.</i>
<i>Get your men out of there, Horsemen.</i>

79
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,666
<i>If they can't move, leave them.
You understand?</i>

80
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,500
<i>Get away
from that location now! Do you copy?</i>

81
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,916
Yeah, yeah, I copy.

82
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,916
[soldier 8] Hey! Hey!

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Leave it.

84
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,458
Do what?

85
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,791
- They said to stay away from it.
- [soldier 9] What?

86
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,666
They said stay…

87
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,125
Hey, we gotta go.

88
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,666
You heard what they said.
We need to move now!

89
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,375
We need to go back. They need our help!

90
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,541
No. There is no "they." You understand?
Everyone's fucked. Come on.

91
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,125
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,291
No, no, no. We can't stop.
We got to keep moving.

93
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,541
We're far enough away now. It's okay.

94
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,500
It is so not okay.

95
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,125
All right, all right.

96
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,416
What was that?

97
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,750
It's hunting us.

98
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,140
It's getting further away. Let's go.

99
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,041
- Holy shit. Are you kidding me?
- That really scared me.

100
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,291
<i>Are ya ready, boys?</i>

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,791
A one, two, three, four…

102
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,791
[man]<i> I saw what you did there.</i>

103
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,291
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,
joining me at the microphone,</i>

104
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,833
<i>Ms. Allison Crowe.</i>

105
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,083
[man] <i>Ah, shoot.</i>

106
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,875
[reporter] <i>Thousands of protesters</i>
<i>marched on the Capitol this morning</i>

107
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,875
<i>in response to yesterday's
historic Congressional vote</i>

108
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,208

the controversial proposal</i>

109
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,125
<i>to wipe out the last remains

110
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,291

111
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,541
<i>with the US military

112
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,916

113
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,291
<i>as Vegas was walled off with the zombies

114
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,083
<i>This will mark the culmination
of the president's efforts</i>

115
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,583
<i>to fulfill his campaign promise</i>

116
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:44,500
<i>to exterminate
Las Vegas' undead population</i>

117
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:49,000

<i>of the McCarran quarantine camp,</i>

122
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,666
<i>which has long been
the target of civil rights groups</i>

123
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,208

125
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,291
Excuse me.

126
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,916
May I talk to that gentleman, please?

127
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,416
[man] Hey, Scott, you got a visitor.

128
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,666
Mr. Ward.

129
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,958
Hey. You're Bly Tanaka, right?

130
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,750
You want to see me?

131
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,958
It's not every man
who saves the secretary of defense

132
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,541
from a horde of flesh-eating monsters,

133
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,500
earns the Medal of Freedom,

134
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,833
only to end up…

135
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,250
Working at a burger joint.

136
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,791
Mr. Tanaka,
I am well aware of my situation.

137
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,708
[Tanaka] Here's the thing.

138
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:42,083
There's $200 million
in the basement vault beneath the Strip.

139
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,500
Two hundred million the insurance company
already reimbursed me for,

140
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,541
un-taxable, untraceable.

141
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,916
Un-spendable.

142
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,916
[Tanaka] That's where you come in.

143
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,708
With 96 hours left,

144
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:59,375
the government has already moved
more than half of its military presence

145
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,500
out of the quarantine zone,

146
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,750
which makes it vulnerable.

147
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,791
I want you to put together
a team and get it out.

148
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,416
In exchange,

149
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:13,041
50 million is yours to divvy up
amongst whomever you take in with you.

150
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,125
Intrigued?

151
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,583
Don't give me an answer.

152
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,166
Think on it for the night.

153
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,458
In good faith.

154
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,125
[Tanaka] We'll talk soon, Mr. Ward.

155
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,767
[man on TV] <i>You should just be happy</i>

156
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,875
<i>that this is essentially
a government-funded health care solution</i>

157
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,125
<i>that will put an end to all of this.</i>

158
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,583
[woman] <i>Come on, Sean.</i>
<i>You know they're not infected.</i>

159
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,833
<i>If they were,
they would be zombies already.</i>

160
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,166
<i>They're political prisoners,
just people the government</i>

161
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,541
<i>doesn't want on the streets.</i>

162
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,791
<i>You know as well as I do, if you have
questionable immigration status,</i>

<i>or dragging you out
of your house or your car</i>

167
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,458
<i>under the guise of public safety.</i>

<i>This facility is in an active evacuation.</i>

172
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,125
<i>Board the shuttle bus for Barstow.</i>

173
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,291
<i>Have your current
temporary health clearance card</i>

174
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,291

as you board the shuttle.</i>

175
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,666
<i>Reminder, shuttles
will be leaving every 15 minutes.</i>

176
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,208
- Hey, guys.
- Kate!

177
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,583
Hi. [gags] I can't breathe.

178
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,750
- You guys excited for the big move?
- Yeah!

179
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,375
Kate, let the kids finish packing.

180
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,583
Go on. Come on.

181
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,250
Kate, I need you to promise me something.

182
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,375
In case anything
happens to me in the next few days,

183
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,083
just make sure
the kids make it out to Barstow. Okay?

184
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,958
What do you mean? What could happen?

185
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,375
You know her, don't you?

186
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,041
The coyote.

187
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,583
Geeta, that is not an option.

188
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,250
[whispering] Kate,
she helps people get in,

189
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,250
crack a slot machine, slip back out.

190
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,250
Before anyone even knows, you're gone.

191
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,458
That money is our ticket out of here,

192
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,500
or we'll be trapped in Barstow forever.

193
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,916
Listen, these guards,
they don't give a shit.

194
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,041
But for five grand,
I can buy my way out, me and my kids.

195
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,583
I have to get the kids out by Friday,

196
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,750
and I will do
whatever it takes to protect my family.

197
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,416
Geeta, people that go in there,

198
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,041
they don't always come back.

199
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,208
Just forget it.

200
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,208
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, Geeta, come on.
- Just let it go, okay?

201
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,333
- Well…
- [guard] Hey.

202
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,791
Everything okay here, ladies?

203
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,750
What, you don't have
anything better to do?

204
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:09,708
Kate…

205
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,791
- The fuck you say to me, volunteer?
- She didn't say anything.

206
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,000
- Is that right, volunteer?
- [Geeta] Kate.

207
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,875
Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up!

208
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:19,958
Okay.

209
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,875
What? Were you saying something to me?

210
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,375
[mouthing] Don't.

211
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,666
No, I didn't say anything.

212
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,541
You know, the first sign
of infection is belligerence

213
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,416
and actions outside of social norms.

214
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,000
Look at me and hold still.

215
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,041
Clear.

216
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,045

Your turn.

219
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,791
If you want,

220
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,958
I could use my rectal thermometer.

221
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,875
[guard] Oh.

222
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,125
You're down a couple of decimal points.

223
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,333
You sure you're feeling all right?

224
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,625
- You sure you're not infected?
- I… I'm fine.

225
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,708
I'm fine. I'm… I feel fine.

226
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:40,875
Well,

227
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,125
you're both within
the margin of error, but watch it.

228
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,291
You better be on that bus, volunteer.

229
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,250
Asshole.

230
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,625
What were you thinking?

231
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,833
Do you know how easy it would be
for him to make you disappear?

232
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,500
All he has to say
is that you dropped a degree,

233
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,833
and nobody would question it, nobody.

234
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,708
- I know, I'm…
- You know?

235
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,583
I just… He…

236
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,541
Look, it doesn't matter.

237
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,125
I'm sorry. I just…

238
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,791
I need you to promise me
that you're not gonna do anything stupid.

239
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,833
Geeta, it's… it's not worth the risk.

240
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,375
No, you're right.

241
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,166
I won't.

242
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,500
I promise. Okay?

243
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:30,791
Thanks.

I don't like you very much.

00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:11,333
So I hate giving you
the satisfaction of taking the job, but…

[Tanaka] <i>You'd best to gather your team.</i>

[woman in Spanish] <i>I hate to ask, but…</i>

00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,083
Don't worry about it.
Careful, I'm all greasy.

260
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:46,041
Sharkey, give her the white loaner.

261
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:48,500
<i>- Gracias,</i> Maria.
- Say hi to the kids.

262
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,125
[woman in English] Okay. Bye.

263
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:54,333
Fuck.

264
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,208
Hey.

265
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,875
[chuckling] Hey!

266
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:09,500
[Scott] So you think it's a bad idea?

267
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:10,500
[Maria] Come on, Scotty.

268
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:13,250
It's not a matter of "think."
It's a matter of "is,"

269
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:17,166
and it is a bad goddamn idea.

270
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:20,833
- [Scott] You're out?
- I didn't say that.

271
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:21,916
[Scott] You're in?

272
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,708
I didn't say that either.

273
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,166
But you're intrigued.

274
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:30,500
That much I'm guessing
your ass knew before you even walked in.

275
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:33,115
[Scott] I mean, think about it.

276
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:36,208
Everything we did,
all those people we saved,

277
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:38,208
look what it got us.

278
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:41,208
But what if… what if just once,

279
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,083
we did something just for us?

280
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,083
We could die.

281
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:56,375
Yeah, we'll probably die.

282
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:57,458
Hmm.

283
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,000
Some of us at least.

284
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:03,416
Fifty million dollars.

285
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,125
Fifty million.

286
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:08,166
What's the split? Even however many ways?

287
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,166
Figured you, me, and Vanderohe will take
15 million each, assuming he'll do it.

288
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:16,458
Everybody else who isn't family…

289
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,916
Nobody needs to know our cut.

290
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:22,916
Now you're getting it.

291
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,833
[chuckles] Who else
is on your crazy-ass list?

292
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,625
[Vanderohe] So I see you had a visitor.

293
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,708
Talk to me. How'd it go?

294
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:41,500
[woman] Well, first time she's come
to visit me in six months.

295
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:44,666
We can't make small talk
for more than 35 minutes

296
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,791
without it turning into a fight.

297
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:50,041
Still, she seems happy.

298
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,333
That's what matters, I suppose.

299
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:56,291
I'm sure that she appreciates you,
even if you don't realize it.

300
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:57,541
- Mmm.
- I mean it.

301
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:59,916
And if she doesn't… [whispers] …screw her.

302
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,708
[Vanderohe] That's, uh, some heavy shit.

303
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,488
[Scott] So where's your head at?

304
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,750
You know, when we were in it,
like, when we were really in it,

305
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:15,791
I never thought about the faces
of all the countless monsters

306
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,875
but now just realized, you know,

307
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:19,250
were people.

308
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,458
But now their faces,

309
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:22,250
that's all I see.

310
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,226
I don't know if being back in
would be better or worse.

311
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,583
God, I can't figure that out,

312
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:30,041
but I guess
there is a chance that it could be…

313
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,166
Cathartic.

314
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:37,375
There it is.

315
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,208
[Peters] Would you look at that.

316
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:45,500
They should have
nuked Vegas in the early '90s, but…

317
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:48,500
- This is great.
- [Scott] Peters!

318
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,583
Holy shit.

319
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,208
[Scott] What's up?

320
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:57,000
What the hell brings you here?

321
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:57,916
How's the job?

322
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,791
Sucks ass. What're you guys doing here?

323
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,458
- Well...
- We are putting together a crew for a job.

324
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:05,791
Yeah? What does it pay?

325
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:07,750
Well, if it pans out,

326
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,541
you make two million dollars
for one day's work.

327
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,208
- Two million dollars?
- But...

328
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,916
[Peters] That's my share. Just for me?

329
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,041
Two million dollars if it pans out?

330
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,041
Hundred percent. I'm in. Yeah.

331
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:23,416
You don't want to know the risks or...

332
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,416
Why would I want to know the risks?
Two million dollars? That's a lot of cash.

333
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,166
Listen, I hate my life so deeply,

334
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,833
if I had two million dollars,

335
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:35,625
my life would change drastically.

336
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:39,083
Yeah. Thank you. Yes.

337
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,625
You sure you don't want to know?

338
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:41,708
Uh…

339
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,958
I bet it has something
to do with a helicopter.

340
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:44,875
[Scott] Yeah.

341
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:46,916
- I'm the helicopter guy. Yeah.
- Yeah.

342
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:49,541
- Where do I sign?
- [Scott] Okay.

343
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:51,791
- I'm in.
- [Scott] Thanks. Nice seeing you, bud.

344
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,041
She hasn't changed, has she?

345
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,750
Nope. Still weird as ever.

346
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:58,666
Come on. This next one's on me.

347
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,458
Come on. Shit.

348
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:09,791
That's it, baby.
That's what I'm fuckin' talking about!

349
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:11,833
Mikey Guzman.

350
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:15,416
- Mikey Guzman. Name rings a bell.
- Mm-hmm.

351
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Check this out.

352
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:21,083
<i>This is your boy, Mikey Guzman,
taping live from East Las Vegas.</i>

353
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:22,000
<i>We got a group of…</i>

354
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:25,208
<i>I counted at least five,
but let me double-check. Hold on.</i>

355
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:27,208
<i>Seven. We got seven shamblers.</i>

356
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:30,958
<i>Boom, motherfucker! Double headshot.</i>

357
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:36,625
<i>- Shit!</i>
- [Scott] Kid's crazy.

358
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,250
There are Reddit forums
devoted to this guy.

359
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:41,583
<i>Swagger, baby!</i>

360
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,833
<i>- Swagger, man. Hell, yeah.
- That's how it's done.</i>

361
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,250
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,750

<i>Qué onda, güero?</i>

367
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:56,625
[Scott] Mikey Guzman.

368
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:58,875
Yo, what's up?

369
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,166
What would you say about making 500 grand?

370
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:05,583
I'd say, "Who the hell do I gotta kill?"

371
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,375
I love him.

372
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,208
What are we doing here?

373
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:16,250
You told me you needed a safecracker.
Might be your missing piece.

374
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:21,125
[Scott] How would you like to make
250 grand for one day's work?

375
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:23,375
Oh, my God.

376
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,083
[Scott] Can you crack it?

377
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,166
- Can I crack it?
- Yeah.

378
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,125
Can I crack it?

379
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:37,458
This is like showing me a picture
of Botticelli's <i>Madonna of the Magnificat</i>

380
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:39,416
and asking me if I want to fuck her.

381
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:45,625
Okay, the man who designed
this wonderful work of art,

382
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:46,958
Hans Wagner,

383
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:49,458
he named it <i>Der Götterdämmerung</i>

384
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:51,708
for the final chapter in his namesake,

385
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,708
Richard Wagner's epic opera,

386
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:55,958
<i>Der Ring des Nibelungen.</i>

387
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:58,416
- Mmm.
- [safecracker] Can it be opened and by me?

388
00:30:59,083 --> 00:30:59,916
I don't know.

389
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,458
- I honestly don't.
- Okay.

390
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,250
Watch your fingers, Mr. Big Hand.

391
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,333
But of the world's living locksmiths,

392
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:09,833
do I represent
your greatest chance of opening it?

393
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:12,916
I can, with humility, say yes.

394
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:14,875
You're in?

395
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,833
It's a doorway
to another realm, my friends,

396
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,625
and providence has brought you to me.

397
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:21,208
We go through it together.

398
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:23,916
- By the way, what's your name?
- Scott Ward.

399
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,351
- [safecracker] Sorry?
- Scott Ward.

400
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:27,541
Dieter, Scott Ward.

401
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,625
Are you ready to play?

402
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:53,625
Yeah.

403
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:07,416
Scott, this is Damon. That's Chambers.

404
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,041
- They're with me. They'll be on my dime.
- Okay.

405
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,750
- [Damon] How's it going?
- Welcome to the team.

406
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:15,291
[Vanderohe] Scott, you want to tell me
what's up with the kid?

407
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,500
Look at him. No offense,

408
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,041
but he doesn't look
like zombie killer material.

409
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:24,416
Hi, my name is Dieter, and I'm going
to open what cannot be opened.

410
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,666
[laughs] Are you kidding me?

411
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,000
[Scott] No, we need the kid
to open the safe.

412
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:30,250
We lose him, we got nothing.

413
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,416
Let's go, guys. Bring it in.

414
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,791
Mr. Tanaka, team's all here.

415
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:38,583
[Tanaka] Lovely to have you
all gathered here today.

416
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:40,000
Meet your target.

417
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:43,916
The Vegas Bly.

418
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:46,333
You can't fly into Vegas.

419
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,708
It's restricted airspace.

420
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:50,458
But you can fly out.

421
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:56,916
There is an abandoned rescue helicopter
on top of the north tower, Sodom.

422
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,333
If you coordinate and communicate,

423
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,625
this should be a simple in-and-out.

424
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:09,125
[Tanaka] <i>You will enter the city</i>
<i>with a 32-hour window.</i>

425
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,125
<i>Whatever zombies are still walking</i>

426
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:15,333
<i>should be no problem for a gang</i>
<i>of tough </i>hombres<i> such as yourselves.</i>

427
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,833
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

428
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:43,791
My apologies.

429
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,291
How precisely do we do the zombie killing?

430
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,250
Oh, Jesus.

431
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:52,916
[Scott] Is there anybody else here
who hasn't killed a zombie?

432
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,583
Well, we all know the basics.

433
00:34:57,666 --> 00:35:00,416
Zombies, shamblers, the undead,
whatever you wanna call them,

434
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,041
when it comes to killing them,
it's all about the brain.

435
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:03,958
Brain.

436
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:07,833
One comes at you, shoot it in the brain.
It's that simple. Any questions?

437
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,541
Yes. What if I took a big rock
and smashed it into the head?

438
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:14,833
Would… would that work?

439
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:18,166
Yeah. Yeah, that, uh…

440
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,000
That also would still be targeting
the brain, so that would work.

441
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,125
Copy that.

442
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:24,125
Sorry, Mr. Tanaka, please continue.

443
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,875
[Tanaka] <i>From there,</i>
<i>you move down the Strip.</i>

<i>You'll reach the casino

445
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:38,625
<i>You go in and find the generator.</i>

446
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:44,375
<i>The safe,
beneath the south tower, Gomorrah…</i>

447
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,500
<i>Is at the end of a hallway.</i>

448
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:51,583
<i>There, you'll find
several nonlethal deterrents.</i>

449
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,875
<i>You'll have to find a way to trigger them.</i>

450
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:58,041
<i>Meanwhile,
our fearless pilot-slash-mechanic</i>

451

<i>of his gentle touch.</i>

458
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:30,333
<i>Then, all you have to do
is load the money on the helicopter</i>

459
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:33,541
<i>and fly off into the sunset.</i>

460
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:39,666
All this…

461
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,458
…a full day before the nuke
ever leaves the launchpad.

462
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:45,041
Easy peasy Japanese-y.

463
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:47,458
[clears throat] Sorry, sir.

464
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:51,083
We're not allowed to say that anymore.
It's "lemon squeezy" now.

465
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,541
Yeah, but I'm...

466
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,541
I think it's fine if he's Japanese-y.

467
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:57,958
[Tanaka] As you wish.

468
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:01,375
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

469
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,750
Take a look.

470
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:12,208
Oh. Okay. Good job. Good job.

471
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:21,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
This is the real plan? It's zombies?

472
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:24,958
Yeah, bro, what's going on?
I thought you were cool with it.

473
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:28,916
You were always talking about how, if you
saw a zombie, you'd fuck his shit up.

474
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,791
That was bullshit, man.

475
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:31,708
What?

476
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,416
[Damon] Fuck this. I'm out.

477
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,875
This is crazy. You all are gonna die.

478
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:37,558
- Jesus Christ.
- [Damon] Sorry, brother.

479

480
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:42,125
Hey, Damon. Wait, man.

481
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,458
[Scott] All right, team,
grab your load-out bags.

482

See you at 6:00 a.m. Sharp.

483

[Vanderohe] Roger that, Cap.

484
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,500
Now, hold up, hold up.

00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,750
My name's Martin.
I'm Mr. Tanaka's head of security.

Anything you need, you talk to me.

487
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:59,250
I can access any hardware you might want.

488
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,125
I'll also be accompanying you on this job

489
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:03,625
because of my
extensive knowledge of the casino.

490
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,250
Any questions?

491
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,208
Good. See you at 0600.

492
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:10,375
[Dieter] 0600?

493
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:11,791
[Tanaka] How're you feeling?

494
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,559
[Scott] You're insane.
You know that, right?

495
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,500
But if it's a choice
between dying on the Strip

496
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:18,583
and spending another day
flipping patties at the Lucky Boy,

497
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,166
I'll gamble on a few million.

498
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,708
Have you given
any thought to how you'll get in?

499
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:26,916
Yeah.

00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:10,666
Do this one thing,
and I can give you $15 million.

514
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,458
- Fifteen million?
- Fifteen…

515
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:14,583
You don't have $15 million.

516
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:18,083
If you do this one thing for me, I will.

517
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:22,875
I know this
is not gonna make up for what I did…

518
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:24,875
…or what type of father I was.

519
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:25,833
Yeah.

520
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:28,291
With $15 million,
you can help these people.

521
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,541
You can go back to school,
do whatever you want.

522
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:34,125
Whatever you do with this money,
I know will be the right thing.

523
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:48,250
What one thing?

524
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,416
[Geeta] Hey. Please! Hey. Hey.

525
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,625
You're the coyote, right?

526
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:27,583
Take us in. Please.

527
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:30,166
Please.

528
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:37,375
Not bad for your first time.

529
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:40,958
Okay, I get it. I understand.

530
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:44,083
I understand
what beautiful little machine.

531
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:45,625
Hey, don't point a gun at me.

532
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,708
Sorry. Sorry.

533
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,708
Whoo!

534
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,851
[Scott] Here comes our ride.

535
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:59,125
- Oh, good. You want some water?
- Yeah.

536
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,041
You're kidding. What is this?

537
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:16,958
What?

538
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,833
I swear to God, if this whole mission

539
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:21,833
is some insane way
for you to reconnect with your daughter...

540
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:23,708
It's not, all right? Trust me.

541
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:26,458
She's a volunteer at the camp.
She's got connections.

542
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:29,500
She's just giving us a ride
into the quarantine zone.

543
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,708
You really think
I'd take her inside the city?

544
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:56,833
Hey, how you doing? I don't think
we've officially met. My name's Martin.

545
00:41:56,916 --> 00:42:00,041
Don't talk to me. I don't trust
these people, especially you.

546
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:02,875
- Oh.
- You stay the hell away from me.

547
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:03,958
Yes, ma'am.

548
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:09,166
Ooh.

549
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:37,000
[man over PA] <i>Detainees at</i>
<i>the Las Vegas McCarran Quarantine Center,</i>

550
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:41,083
<i>this facility will be closed
by the end of the day. No personnel…</i>

551
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,916
Criminals, meet your coyote.

552
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:56,958
Does coyote girl have a name?

553
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,375
Lilly, but "coyote" sounds cool.

554
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:01,166
You can just call me that if you want.

555
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,750
All right, I'll leave you guys to it.

556
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,875
I'll meet you outside Barstow in 24 hours.

557
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,500
- Okay?
- Okay.

558
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,083
Try not to get nuked

559
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:12,000
or murdered by the undead.

560
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,458
[Kate] Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's wrong?

561
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,666
Mom's gone.

562
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,291
- [Vanderohe] Here.
- Um…

563
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:43,833
Question.

564
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:45,291
Yes, Dieter.

565
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:47,916
You don't think I need something bigger?

566
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,440
If I give you something bigger than that,
you're already dead.

567
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:53,041
Dead?

568
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:55,083
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i> dead.

569
00:43:58,166 --> 00:43:59,958
Um, this belongs to where?

570
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:05,291
Give me a fucking break. Really?

571
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,958
Dieter, try not to piss Van off.

572
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Thank you, sir.

573
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:14,708
Hey.

574
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:16,875
- What did you do?
- What do you mean?

575
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:19,583
[Kate] Stop!

576
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:20,666
Get off me!

577
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:22,958
- Stop!
- What the hell's going on?

578
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,208
The hell are you doing?

579
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:26,833
[Kate] You took her in.

580
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,375
You took in Geeta.

581
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:31,250
Yeah. I took her in. Her and two others.

582
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:34,666
I take a lot of people in.
They need that money to get out of here.

583
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,267
- You know that.
- She didn't come back.

584
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:38,083
Well, not everyone does.

585
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:40,125
- They know the risks.
- [Kate] She has two kids!

586
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:46,541
[Lilly] She didn't tell me that.

587
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:50,041
Listen, if I knew she had kids,
I wouldn't have taken her.

588
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,083
Did you see her die?

589
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,250
No.

590
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:58,541
They went ahead. I… I hung back.

591
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:03,041
They never came out. I'm sorry.

592
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:07,500
I waited, Kate, as long as I could,
but at the end of the day...

593
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:08,875
I'm coming with you.

594
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,833
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

595
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,017
We're not having this conversation.
You're not coming.

596
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:18,708
There are two kids
whose mother is lost in there.

597
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:21,041
Two kids that I help look out for.

598
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:22,166
I have to find her.

599
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,541
Well, tell us what she looks like.
We'll look out for her.

600
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:26,625
- You think I trust you to do that?
- Kate!

601
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,500
- You're not coming!
- I'm not asking you!

602
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:31,375
I'm telling you what's gonna happen.

603
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:32,458
Come here.

604
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:38,333
Listen to me. As someone
who's seen what this looks like,

605
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:41,541
this is not a path you wanna go down.
I'm not gonna let you try.

606
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,375
You're gonna stay put.

607
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:46,083
We'll look for your friend.
I'll see you when we get out.

608
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:49,416
- Okay?
- No. No, not okay.

609
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,500
You listen.

610
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:52,291
I'm going in either way.

611
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,166
I can go in with you,
and you can keep me safe.

612
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,916
- Kate.
- Or... Or… I'll just sneak in after you,

613
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:00,916
and I'll probably die.

614
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,375
The choice is yours.

615
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:07,208
What's it gonna be, Dad?

616
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:23,000
If we see your friend, great.

617
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:27,500
But you are not to run off
looking for her. This is life or death.

618
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:31,125
And if you screw around,
some of these people are gonna die.

619
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,208
You understand that?

620
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:33,958
And they've got families too.

621
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,833
So you are never, ever to leave my sight.

622
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:40,666
Those are my terms. Are we clear?

623
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,541
Yeah. We're clear.

624
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:51,708
Guys, this is Kate,

625
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:53,916
newest member of the team.

626
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:56,500
- Hey. Hello.
- How's it going?

627
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:59,125
Scott, what the fuck?

628
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,916
[officer] You having a good time?
What's he talking about?

629
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,041
The bomb that's coming to kill you?
Is that what you're talking about?

630
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:08,500
That's the last bus.

631
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:10,958
Go, Speedy Gonzales! <i>Arriba.</i>

632
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:13,500
[man over PA] <i>This is</i>
<i>a mandatory evacuation zone.</i>

633
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:16,708
- We're going to need one more guy.
- For what?

634
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:19,458
You don't know what it's like
in there. Not anymore.

635
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:22,666
- The team's big enough...
- Trust me. We need another person.

636
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:27,458
What the hell's going on here?

637
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:33,750
You want to make 20 grand?

638
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:35,125
Twenty thousand dollars?

639
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:38,750
Yeah, I'll make 20 fucking grand.

640
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,791
I don't fucking get it.
Why the fuck would she bring him?

641
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:48,333
Honey, easy with the f-bombs, okay?

642
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:49,934
- [Kate] Are you kidding?
- [officer] Chainsaw.

643
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:53,375
We're about to march into a sea
of dead people and commit grand larceny.

644
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:55,833
- But excuse me for swearing.
- That's for you.

645
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:57,916
[officer] Me? [chuckles] Oh, yes.

646
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:01,541
I got this.

647
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:03,833
Whoo!

648
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:05,458
We're gonna have some fun, yeah?

649
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:09,958
I'm telling you,
you got the right guy for this.

650
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:15,208
And also, if you happen
to get scared in there or nervous,

651
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:16,875
I want you to stay close to me.

652
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:18,750
- Mm-hmm.
- I got you.

653
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:19,958
Thanks.

654
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:24,291
What's up, bro?

655
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:27,041
Gas tank. You carry that.

656
00:48:29,958 --> 00:48:33,541
Don't ever touch my saw again, okay?
Don't ever talk to her again…

657
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:36,833
Bro.

658
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,791
- Okay. For sure.
- [Vanderohe] Good answer.

659
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,041
[Lilly] All right, guys, let's go!

660
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:52,250
The fuck you looking at?

661
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,583
Behind me.

662
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:32,750
Put your gun up, idiot.

663
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,875
Hey. It's not too late to go back.

664
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:54,500
[Lilly] There they are, the shamblers,

665
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:56,583
what's left of them.

666
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:01,666
What happened to them exactly?

667
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,000
[Lilly] What's it look like?

668
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,291
Weren't smart enough
to get out of the sun.

669
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:07,666
You should see what happens when it rains.

670
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,958
For a few hours,
they all come back to life.

671
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,625
Oh, <i>Scheisse!</i>

672
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:15,541
Okay, let's go. Come on.

673
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:19,000
How… how much rain is…

674
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:20,125
[Chambers] Let's get this.

675
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:21,958
Tourists.

676
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:28,125
Hey, you're Lilly, right?

677
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:31,875
You sure know your way around here.

678
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,333
Well, what's it to you?

679
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:34,833
Well, maybe a lot.

680
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,333
How much you know
about how these things operate?

681
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:39,625
Everything there is.

682
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,083
- Hmm.
- [Lilly] Why?

683
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:45,500
[chuckles] Good to know.

684
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:05,458
[Dieter] Wow, <i>was ist das?</i>

685
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:10,208
[Chambers] Holy shit. What is all this?

686
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:11,458
[Kate] What happened here?

687
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:13,916
[Lilly] Where the police
and military finally fell.

688
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,517
Vegas' last stand.

689
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:18,708
[Guzman] Whoa, whoa. Everybody be quiet.

690
00:51:18,791 --> 00:51:20,000
Do you hear that?

691
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:25,291
- What the hell is that?
- Get behind the car! Go!

692
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:43,625
What is this?

693
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:45,166
Valentine.

694
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:46,833
Valentine?

695
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:55,166
[Martin] It's a goddamn zombie tiger.

696
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:57,583
That's crossing the line.

697
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:04,083
- [Chambers] Hell, yeah.
- [Guzman] Awesome.

698
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,625
Clear.

699
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:36,250
<i>- Los geht's.</i>
- [Dieter] Okay.

700
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:41,161
[officer] The hell was that?

701
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:43,000
She was one of Siegfried and Roy's.

702
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:44,833
She guards
the beginning of their territory.

703
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:48,208
- Is there another way around?
- Not really.

704
00:52:55,416 --> 00:52:57,625
Hey, Cummings.
Let me see your gun for a second.

705
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,208
What? No shot.

706
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:00,666
[Lilly] Just for a second.

707
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:04,291
I like it. It's beautiful.

708
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:07,458
It's reliable too.

709
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:09,583
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

710
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:14,416
Can I touch it?

711
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,291
- You wanna touch it?
- Yeah.

712
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:21,000
Just for a second.

713
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,125
Just for a second.

714
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:24,500
[Cummings] Mmm.

715
00:53:33,791 --> 00:53:35,101
- [Cummings] Oh, my…
- [Peters] Hey!

716
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:37,886
I would say I was hoping I wouldn't
have to do that, but I'd be lying.

717
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:40,000
- What are you talking about?
- What is she doing?

718
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,541
She just shot me. Shoot her!

719
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:44,791
They'll know we're here. They won't care
so long as we play by their rules.

720
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:47,500
- Rules? <i>De qué habla esta pendeja?</i>
- [Guzman] <i>O sea, está loca.</i>

721
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:49,666
If we wanna go further,
we have to make a trade.

722
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,184
- Trade? Really?
- [Cummings] No trade!

723
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:54,166
Yes. An offering to show our subservience.

724
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,210
- They don't think.
- [Cummings] Shoot this bitch!

725
00:53:56,291 --> 00:53:58,392
- If they come, we kill them.
- [Lilly] You don't understand.

726
00:53:58,416 --> 00:54:01,267
- They're not what you think they are.
- [Cummings] Shoot her in the face!

727
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:04,375
We're not talking about shamblers here.

728
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:06,083
You're right. They don't think.

729
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:09,291
They just move and eat.
But we're talking about the other ones.

730
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:13,041
- The alphas.
- Yes. They're smarter. They're faster.

731
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:16,041
They're organized.
Straight out of your fucking nightmares.

732
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:17,166
[Cummings] Please.

733
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:20,250
You all keep talking
about the city like it's their prison.

734
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:22,166
It's not. It's their kingdom.

735
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,470
They won't mind us
poking around the outside

736
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,166
so long as we play by their rules.

737
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,684
- [Cummings] Oh my God!
- We're moving into the heart of it now.

738
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:30,208
I have a mother. I love her.

739
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:31,958
Well, everyone has a mom, you cunt,

740
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:35,458
but not everyone is an abuser
lording power over quarantined women.

741
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:37,750
[Cummings sobbing] She's lying!
That's not true.

742
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:40,434
[Lilly] Shut your mouth.
I've seen what you've done to those women.

743
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:42,625
You fucking rapist.

744
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:45,041
[Cummings] Oh my God!
That's not true at all.

745
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:48,541
- Oh, fuck, no! No!
- She's coming.

746
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:50,333
[Cummings] Who's coming? What's coming?

747
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:53,541
- She? What's she?
- [Cummings] No, please. We bonded. Please.

748
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,500
No. No, no, no. Don't trust her.

749
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:58,017
- [Dieter] Sorry.
- [Cummings] No, please.

750
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:00,958
Help me. Don't go. No, we're a team.

751
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:14,916
What the…

752
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,458
What… what the fuck?

753
00:55:47,666 --> 00:55:48,666
<i>Scheisse.</i>

754
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,208
Help. Shoot this!
What the fuck is this thing?

755
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,625
Listen, no. No. Hi.

756
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:01,000
I'm not here to hurt you.

757
00:56:01,083 --> 00:56:04,250
Come on.
Help me, help me, help me, help me.

758
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:06,291
No! No, no, no, no, no.

759
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,458
[Cummings] Help me!

760
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:22,875
Don't do it. Just stay away.

761
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:25,083
What are you doing?

762
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:35,833
[sobbing] No. Oh my God!

763
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:39,791
Go away. Go over there. Go over there.

764
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:48,166
[screaming] No!

765
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:50,791
Help! No!

766
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:29,686
- [Scott] You ever seen her kill anyone?
- [Lilly] Couple times.

767
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:32,416
[Cummings] No!

768
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,666
[Scott] Did they come back?

769
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,250
[Lilly] Yep, as shamblers.

770
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,083
[Cummings] No!

771
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:40,541
[Lilly] My theory, this started
with one of them, an original.

772
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:42,083
[Cummings] Oh, my God! No!

773
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:43,886
[Lilly] Whoever that is, if he bites you...

774
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:45,726
- [Vanderohe] Then you become an alpha.
- [Lilly] Exactly.

775
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,666
Looks like
they're taking him to the Olympus.

776
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,875
Good. Now we know where not to go.

777
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:54,291
[Lilly] I've never figured out
exactly how it works.

778
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:57,958
All I know is they take you in there,
and you come out like one of them,

779
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,250
one of the fast ones.

780
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:02,916
- So, they're taking him there to turn him.
- [Lilly] Yes.

781
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,958
Scott, that could be where Geeta is.

782
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:08,000
Kate, we've already talked about this.

783
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:10,166
- [Kate] We have time.
- [Scott] It's not an option.

784
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,250
Fine.

785
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:13,041
That's what I thought.

786
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:16,708
So, the shithead
buys us passage, and we keep going?

787
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:19,541
Well, yeah.
The shithead should buy us some goodwill,

788
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:22,375
but I'm not about to flaunt it
by walking on their streets.

789
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:24,583
If we want to go further, we go indoors.

790
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:25,791
<i>Allez,</i> let's go.

791
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:50,416
Hey, uh, has there been
any thought given to triage?

792
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,333
What do you mean?

793
00:58:51,416 --> 00:58:55,500
Well, I mean, obviously,
the German is the most important person

794
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:57,208
'cause he can open the safe,

795
00:58:57,291 --> 00:59:00,875
but barring that,
it's got to be me, right?

796
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:03,333
Because without me,
you can't fly the chopper out of here.

797
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:06,083
So that would make me
second most important.

798
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:10,000
And I don't know if you two
are tied for third or whatever,

799
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:13,750
but I'm certainly
more important than that guy.

800
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:16,083
Sorry. I didn't know
you were listening. I am way…

801
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:19,750
[chuckles] Okay, I am definitely
more important than that guy.

802
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:21,208
I don't trust that guy.

803
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,708
You know why he was hired?

804
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:24,708
He was hired to keep tabs on us

805
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:27,625
for when we open the safe,
that we didn't take the money and run.

806
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,458
We should be incentivized.

807
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:31,500
I'm not trying to be the bad guy,

808
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:33,708
but we should be incentivized

809
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:35,708
to let him die.

810
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:44,041
What? What's everybody looking at me for?

811
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:48,583
It's a free country.
People can look at whoever they want.

812
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:51,791
Actually, it's not a free country.
We're not in America anymore.

813
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:52,750
Haven't you heard?

814
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:56,833
Which technically makes it
an even freer country, right?

815
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:01,125
Whatever.

816
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:06,250
What the fuck is this?

817
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:12,291
Stay away from me!

818
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:40,416
What the fuck?

819
01:00:58,041 --> 01:00:59,250
What is that?

820
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,958
No.

821
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:17,208
Hey.

822
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:20,375
Hey. Let me talk to you for a second.

823
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:23,958
I can help you. Just let me...

824
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,041
Okay. Okay.

825
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:52,000
What the fuck?

826
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:03,041
No.

827
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:05,416
No.

828
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:10,041
No. No, no!

829
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:12,500
Okay. Okay, look.

830
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:15,083
Let's just talk turkey for a second. I...

831
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:55,291
[Dieter] Oh, shit.

832
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:03,911
[whispers] Don't touch them.

833
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:08,416
Don't shine the light in their eyes.

834
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:11,708
I've seen this before.
They're hibernating.

835
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:15,791
If we can't see them,
how are we supposed to move forward?

836
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,208
I'll mark us a path.

837
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:42,875
Go for it.

838
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:45,458
Why? You want to check out my ass?

839
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:48,916
No. I don't trust you
to have our backs if shit goes bad.

840
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,666
I've been watching you,
and you're up to something.

841
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,083
When we all get to the casino,

842
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:54,926
I think we need
to have a little conversation

843
01:03:54,958 --> 01:03:57,166
about what exactly your role is here.

844
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,458
Knock yourself out.

845
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:32,208
Gotcha, bitch.

846
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,416
You motherfucker.

847
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:42,750
Bitch.

848
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:44,541
Fuck!

849
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:54,833
This way!

850
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:05,458
- Where's Chambers?
- [Martin] She was right behind me.

851
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:08,166
- What happened? What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

852
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:10,083
She started shooting.
I wasn't close to her.

853
01:09:10,166 --> 01:09:12,583
Bullshit! She was back there
with you! I know she was!

854
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:13,916
- Buddy…
- What happened?

855
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,480
- You don't want to...
- Motherfucker!

856
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:29,708
She's gone! Come on.
Leave her! She's dead!

857
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,791
Chambers! Chambers!

858
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:36,583
Come on!

859
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:51,916
Go!

860
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,958
Run! Run!

861
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:24,291
[Scott] Guz, come on. Let's go.

862
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:28,166
Guzman. Guz! She's gone.

863
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,250
We gotta move. Come on, move!

864
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:02,458
[Kate] Lilly.

865
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:06,041
There's no way Geeta's alive, right?

866
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:07,750
I mean, look at these things.

867
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:10,916
Don't be so sure. I brought a guy in once.

868
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,500
Lost sight of him.
Had to leave him. I thought he was dead.

869
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:16,416
Then three days later,
he came walking back out.

870
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:20,166
What happened to him?

871
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:22,875
[Lilly] Said they took him to the Olympus.

872
01:12:22,958 --> 01:12:25,208
Shoved him in a room
with two other people.

873
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:27,416
The leader, he came for them one by one.

874
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:30,750
If my guy hadn't escaped,
he would have been next.

875
01:12:32,166 --> 01:12:34,041
So that's a pretty common theme for you?

876
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:35,500
Leaving people behind.

877
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:38,291
Do you think
I enjoy having to leave people?

878
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:42,333
I'm doing what I can to make things right.

879
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:55,166
[Dieter] Sir.

880
01:12:55,916 --> 01:12:57,333
Come here. Look at this.

881
01:12:58,625 --> 01:12:59,708
[Maria] The hell?

882
01:13:02,791 --> 01:13:03,625
Is that…

883
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:06,666
Yeah, another set
of blueprints to the safe.

884
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,458
[whispers] Another set of blueprints.

885
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,833
[Scott] Slimy bastard, Tanaka.

886
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:16,208
Tanaka had other teams here before us.

887
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:22,708
Do you know anything about this?

888
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:25,791
That's news to me.

889
01:13:34,708 --> 01:13:35,958
Peters, get up to the roof.

890
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:39,375
Get that chopper running
as fast as possible. Cruz, go with her.

891
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,541
She talks too much.

892
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:44,166
Look, I'm excited
to see my friends again, okay?

893
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,250
Sue me.

894
01:13:46,166 --> 01:13:49,458
Me and the coyote will do
a perimeter check, board up the doors.

895
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:52,166
Yeah. Kate and I
are gonna find the generators.

896
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:55,541
Backup gennie's on the third-floor roof.
That's gonna be your safer bet.

897
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:56,958
Third-floor roof. Got it.

898
01:13:57,958 --> 01:13:59,318
Van, get Dieter down to the vault.

899
01:13:59,375 --> 01:14:00,666
Take Guzman with you.

900
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:02,083
Roger that.

901
01:14:02,166 --> 01:14:07,041
Dieter, access card for the outer doors
to the safe and the service elevators.

902
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:09,250
It's by the cashiers windows that way.

903
01:14:10,541 --> 01:14:12,416
This should get you inside. Here.

904
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:14,833
Thank you.

905
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:19,000
[chuckles] That one's mine.
I got another one.

906
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,976
All right. Everybody knows
what they're doing. Let's get it done.

907
01:14:25,041 --> 01:14:26,041
Yes, sir.

908
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:40,083
What a hunk of junk.

909
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:44,041
<i>No la vayas a cagar,</i> my friend.

910
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:45,833
[Peters] Right.

911
01:14:46,666 --> 01:14:47,666
Bye.

912
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,833
What the hell is this?

913
01:14:53,625 --> 01:14:56,500
Spend all his money
on that fucking miniature?

914
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:11,000
[Martin] I really hate that tiger.

915
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:13,833
It's perverse.

916
01:15:19,291 --> 01:15:20,291
What was it?

917
01:15:21,791 --> 01:15:23,625
Guilt finally get the better of you?

918
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:26,041
One too many out there to die?

919
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:28,000
Matter of fact, yes, it has.

920
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:30,750
That mom Kate's looking for,

921
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:33,333
did you shoot her in the leg too?

922
01:15:34,666 --> 01:15:36,708
No, I just lost her.

923
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:39,250
I've never left anyone I didn't have to

924
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:41,541
or who didn't deserve it.

925
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:43,875
You have no idea
what I've seen in those camps.

926
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:45,833
What those people have to do to survive.

927
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:48,375
At least within these walls,
the rules are clear.

928
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:50,500
You don't see them
fucking each other over.

929
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
If you screw me…

930
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:03,541
Two between the eyes.

931
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:04,708
Two? Why two?

932
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,000
The second one's just for fun.

933
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:09,375
[Martin] Ah! Shit.

934
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:13,666
What happens now?

935
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:15,916
We wait.

936
01:16:18,083 --> 01:16:20,043
[Scott] You understand
that I had to do it, right?

937
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:21,125
Do what?

938
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:23,750
[Scott] Put her down.

939
01:16:24,958 --> 01:16:29,125
You know, all those things
they were saying… about me after.

940
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:31,625
- I want to make sure you know I loved her.
- Yeah.

941
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:33,541
We loved each other.

942
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:39,958
If I ever made it seem
like that wasn't the case, I'm sorry.

943
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:42,750
I got it. It's okay.

944
01:16:44,875 --> 01:16:46,708
- You do?
- [Kate] Yes.

945
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:50,750
You did what you had to do.

946
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:52,875
She was one of them. It…

947
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:55,458
It's fine. Okay?

948
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:00,125
Wait.

949
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:04,458
You think that's why I haven't
been talking to you all these years?

950
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:07,458
Well, it seemed like the…

951
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:11,500
- Seemed like the logical assumption. Yeah.
- [scoffs] No.

952
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:14,083
What you did and what happened to her,

953
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:17,583
I never blamed you for that, ever.

954
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:19,916
Well, I don't… I don't get it.

955
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,416
If it wasn't what happened,
what the hell was it?

956
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,250
It's not the…

957
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:33,708
It's not the fact that…
you killed my mother.

958
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:42,875
It's that you never showed up after, okay?

959
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,333
You… [sighs]

960
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,041
You weren't there, Scott.

961
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:48,750
You didn't call. You didn't visit.

962
01:17:48,833 --> 01:17:51,666
You didn't… talk about it.

963
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:54,791
You didn't comfort me.

964
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,416
[Scott] Yeah, you're right.

965
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:03,166
It's 'cause every time I looked at you,

966
01:18:03,958 --> 01:18:05,333
I just saw her and…

967
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:08,875
It hurt like hell.

968
01:18:14,416 --> 01:18:15,541
Hurt like hell.

969
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,583
And then when I tried
to come back around, you just…

970
01:18:22,666 --> 01:18:26,375
You seemed like you didn't want me there,
so I assumed I should stay gone.

971
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:33,625
You know, maybe
there's a chance we could still…

972
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:36,375
Still what?

973
01:18:40,666 --> 01:18:41,666
I don't know.

974
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:45,500
Maybe you could look
into college somewhere.

975
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:49,083
We shouldn't need money.
I could open a restaurant.

976
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:51,541
A new food truck.

977
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:54,000
Just have a life.

978
01:18:54,708 --> 01:18:55,916
I was thinking, uh…

979
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,250
I was thinking
artisan grilled cheese sandwiches.

980
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:02,750
Artisan grilled cheese?

981
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:05,000
Yeah, what do you think?

982
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:06,875
Mmm.

983
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:11,833
Yeah, uh…

984
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:16,750
[clears throat] I don't know.
It's a… it's a nice idea, but…

985
01:19:22,166 --> 01:19:26,916
I've spent so long hating you
that I can't just turn that off.

986
01:19:29,666 --> 01:19:31,375
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

987
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:35,708
- That came out meaner than I meant it to.
- [clears throat] No, it's all right.

988
01:19:35,791 --> 01:19:37,500
[clears throat] No, I understand.

989
01:19:45,166 --> 01:19:47,416
Let's just get this done.

990
01:20:05,166 --> 01:20:07,708
<i>Ay, su puta madre.</i>

991
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,083
[Vanderohe] Guz!

992
01:20:27,666 --> 01:20:30,041
I got the bride. I got the bride.

993
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:31,958
I shot her three times.

994
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:33,250
Actually, it was four.

995
01:20:33,333 --> 01:20:34,333
Four.

996
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,375
[chuckles excitedly] Whoo-hoo!

997
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:42,000
Not zombie-killing material,
my ass, Mr. Vanderohe.

998
01:20:44,958 --> 01:20:46,416
[Dieter] Whoo-hoo! Ha!

999
01:20:49,125 --> 01:20:51,958
Sorry, sir. Um… All right.

1000
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:53,750
Okay.

1001
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:02,291
[Dieter] Okay.

1002
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,916
<i>Götterdämmerung.</i>

1003
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:23,208
You've been here
in the dark waiting for me.

1004
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:29,000
You're so beautiful. See?

1005
01:21:32,291 --> 01:21:33,291
Oh, look.

1006
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:36,416
There's another team of grave robbers.

1007
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,166
They tried to cut their way in.

1008
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:40,583
[scoffs] That's so stupid.

1009
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:44,250
You stupid poor skeletons.

1010
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:46,875
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1011
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:51,750
Oh, no. All they managed to do
is to screw up the card reader.

1012
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:54,041
[Vanderohe] Is it another team,
or is it us, Dieter?

1013
01:21:54,625 --> 01:21:57,250
- Huh?
- Think about it. Us.

1014
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:01,833
I mean, look at them. It's us.

1015
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:04,375
It could be us in another timeline,

1016
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:05,916
and we're caught

1017
01:22:07,208 --> 01:22:09,541
in some infinite loop

1018
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,750
of fighting and dying,

1019
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:16,833
fighting and dying,
fighting and dying. And Tanaka…

1020
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:21,500
The puppet master.

1021
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:22,583
Devil. God.

1022
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:27,291
And we, you, me, Guz,
and the rest of the team,

1023
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:30,875
simply pawns in some perverse play

1024
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:33,500
where we're destined
to repeat our failures.

1025
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,041
And finally,

1026
01:22:37,083 --> 01:22:40,416
in some mind-bending, ironic reveal…

1027
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:45,166
It all begins again.

1028
01:22:45,916 --> 01:22:46,916
Cool.

1029
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:48,583
Boom.

1030
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,833
Amazing.

1031
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,500
There.

1032
01:23:28,791 --> 01:23:31,166
That's where
the first pressure trigger is.

1033
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:34,083
It's some kind of a booby trap, trust me.

1034
01:23:34,791 --> 01:23:37,083
If we could find something to trigger it…

1035
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:48,958
- There.
- I see.

1036
01:23:56,083 --> 01:23:58,333
By the way, I love your hair.

1037
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:02,375
Thanks.

1038
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:16,958
[Geeta whimpering] Oh, God.

1039
01:24:17,041 --> 01:24:18,041
Oh, God.

1040
01:24:22,291 --> 01:24:23,125
[Geeta exclaims] No!

1041
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:24,208
Oh, God.

1042
01:24:58,166 --> 01:24:59,458
[Martin] Hey, sweetheart.

1043
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,541
Gotcha.

1044
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,500
Get off me!

1045
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:54,625
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1046
01:25:58,041 --> 01:25:58,875
Yeah.

1047
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:11,291
Good luck.

1048
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:14,958
Hey, gorgeous.

1049
01:26:15,541 --> 01:26:17,250
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1050
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:18,708
Okay. Oh.

1051
01:26:18,791 --> 01:26:21,000
Easy, easy, easy. Hey, hey, hey.

1052
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:24,416
Okay. Yeah.

1053
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,833
[sobbing] No. No.

1054
01:26:39,916 --> 01:26:42,875
No! [screams]

1055
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:50,083
What are you doing?

1056
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:58,958
You said
you just needed a vial of her blood.

1057
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:01,541
[Martin] Well, forget blood.

1058
01:27:02,166 --> 01:27:06,125
You know how much the whole head of
one of these things is worth to my boss,

1059
01:27:06,208 --> 01:27:07,333
to the government?

1060
01:27:07,833 --> 01:27:08,833
Mwah!

1061
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:13,041
In the right hands,
this is the power to make more of them.

1062
01:27:13,125 --> 01:27:15,375
The power to control your own zombie army.

1063
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:16,875
That's the ultimate WMD.

1064
01:27:16,958 --> 01:27:18,500
[Lilly] This isn't what we agreed to.

1065
01:27:18,583 --> 01:27:21,000
Well, you want your deal or not?

1066
01:27:23,791 --> 01:27:24,791
Huh?

1067
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:27,833
That's what I thought.

1068
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:31,958
So you keep your goddamn mouth shut.

1069
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,041
Okay, we need to go.

1070
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:38,750
Why? They gonna come looking
for her if she doesn't radio back to base?

1071
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:41,083
Her death cry. They'll have heard it.

1072
01:27:41,166 --> 01:27:43,291
Once they find her body, our trade is off.

1073
01:27:44,958 --> 01:27:46,291
What are they gonna do?

1074
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:48,458
I don't know.

1075
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:01,166
[Guzman chuckling] Now we're talking.

1076
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:05,666
Off you go.

1077
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:10,458
Come on, go get it. That's right.

1078
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:12,666
[Guzman] Come on, fool.

1079
01:28:31,541 --> 01:28:32,541
I… I'm okay.

1080
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:35,833
Everything's fine.

1081
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:43,583
[Guzman] Where you getting all these?

1082
01:28:54,041 --> 01:28:56,125
Who's got the hot hand?

1083
01:28:56,708 --> 01:28:59,166
All right, here we go. You can taste it.

1084
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,041
Huh? Huh?

1085
01:29:01,125 --> 01:29:02,666
Okay, let's go get it.

1086
01:29:08,583 --> 01:29:09,583
Watch this, Guz.

1087
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:16,916
You see that, Diet?

1088
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,500
- It's not the meat, it's the heat.
- [Dieter] Okay.

1089
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:22,666
And the deterrent should be releasing

1090
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:25,958
right… now.

1091
01:29:28,416 --> 01:29:29,416
[Dieter] What, that's it?

1092
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:32,333
[scoffs] Oh, wow. That's so scary.

1093
01:29:36,916 --> 01:29:37,916
Oh, <i>Scheisse!</i>

1094
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:41,870
[Dieter] Fuck.

1095
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:44,666
That was supposed to be nonlethal.

1096
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:47,041
- That has to be illegal, right?
- Good old Tanaka.

1097
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:48,666
Guess he wasn't screwing around.

1098
01:29:49,541 --> 01:29:51,833
So is that it, Dieter, huh?
Is it safe now?

1099
01:29:52,416 --> 01:29:54,000
I think, probably.

1100
01:30:07,166 --> 01:30:10,333
[spluttering] Okay.
Now, it's probably clear.

1101
01:30:12,916 --> 01:30:14,208
Good luck with that.

1102
01:30:15,625 --> 01:30:18,083
Oh, come on, Guz. It was just getting fun.

1103
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:31,000
Yes.

1104
01:30:31,083 --> 01:30:33,916
Yes! Yes!

1105
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,166
Come on! Come on!

1106
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:38,250
Yes! Yes!

1107
01:30:47,416 --> 01:30:49,791
You filthy piece of shit.

1108
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:51,375
Fuck!

1109
01:30:56,458 --> 01:30:57,791
Oh, um…

1110
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,916
You okay there, Dieter?

1111
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,083
- [spluttering] I'm okay.
- [Vanderohe] Yeah?

1112
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:03,208
[Dieter] Um, um…

1113
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:05,416
Can you help me, Mr. Vanderohe?

1114
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,041
- Yeah. Absolutely.
- Thank you.

1115
01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:10,125
One, two, three.

1116
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,583
[Dieter] If I can open it,

1117
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:25,916
it will be either destruction or renewal.

1118
01:31:30,416 --> 01:31:32,666
Death… or rebirth.

1119
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:38,916
That's heavy, brother. But I dig it.

1120

1122

01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,476
[Guzman] Better get out of here.

[Scott] <i>Peters.</i>

1142
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:41,875
[Peters] <i>Yeah.</i>

1143
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:44,500
We got a problem.

1144
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:46,791
They moved the bomb up.

1145
01:32:46,875 --> 01:32:50,208
Oh, nice. I'm glad they decided
to move the nuclear bomb up.

1146
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:52,166
I was getting kind of antsy.

1147

[Scott] <i>We've got about 90 minutes</i>
<i>before this place is dust.</i>

1148
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:55,791
How's it going up there?

1149
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:04,625
Good. I actually found a pool.

1150
01:33:04,708 --> 01:33:06,625
Been working on my tan.

1151
01:33:06,708 --> 01:33:09,208
Gotta even this shit out.
You know what I'm talking about?

1152
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:11,666
How's it going over there?

1153
01:33:12,375 --> 01:33:14,208
Get the safe open yet?

1154
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:18,208
It's a little slower than we thought,
but… we're close.

1155
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:22,958
All right. I'm just giving it
a wash and wax, so hurry up.

1156
01:33:23,041 --> 01:33:24,500
Just waiting on you, man.

1157
01:33:24,583 --> 01:33:26,083
All set.

1158
01:33:27,375 --> 01:33:28,625
Son of a bitch.

1159
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:53,250
- Hey, Dieter. How's that safe coming?
- [Dieter grunts] <i>Scheisse!</i>

1160
01:33:53,333 --> 01:33:54,750
Scott, he's working, man.

1161
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,583
You see this? The four locks?

1162
01:34:02,666 --> 01:34:04,250
You know what that is?

1163
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:06,416
- [Scott] No.
- No, of course not.

1164
01:34:07,166 --> 01:34:10,458
It's a rotating randomization mechanism,
right, Mr. Vanderohe?

1165
01:34:11,041 --> 01:34:12,458
- Affirmative.
- [Dieter] Yeah.

1166
01:34:14,125 --> 01:34:15,958
You, Mr. Sausagefinger…

1167
01:34:17,041 --> 01:34:19,401
You just made me mess up,
and now we're back to ground zero.

1168
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:22,416
If you mess it up again, it locks forever.

1169
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,250
You understand? Forever.

1170
01:34:24,833 --> 01:34:28,375
Okay, how long
will it take you to open it?

1171
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:32,375
[sighs] Okay.

1172
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,750
- Thirty minutes.
- Okay.

1173
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:48,916
Thirty minutes of silence.

1174
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,640
- [Scott] You got it.
- [Dieter] <i>Silencio.</i>

1175
01:34:52,166 --> 01:34:54,000
[softly] Of silence. Okay?

1176
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:57,958
Mr. Vanderohe,
can you please keep your team quiet?

1177
01:34:58,041 --> 01:35:00,291
I need to concentrate. Thank you.

1178
01:35:07,708 --> 01:35:09,791
Thirty minutes, that's not bad. Right?

1179
01:35:09,875 --> 01:35:12,500
Nuclear bomb drops on us
in an hour and 20 minutes.

1180
01:35:12,583 --> 01:35:16,958
Right, which gives us an hour to get
to the helicopter and get out of here.

1181
01:35:18,166 --> 01:35:20,333
- That's plenty of time.
- Plenty.

1182
01:35:20,416 --> 01:35:23,500
What's the alternative?
Run for the edge of the city?

1183
01:35:23,583 --> 01:35:24,875
I don't think we'll make it.

1184
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:27,791
No, we don't need an alt. We trust him.

1185
01:35:28,333 --> 01:35:30,125
- [Maria] Yeah.
- He can do it.

1186
01:35:30,208 --> 01:35:31,208
[Maria] Definitely.

1187
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:32,875
Right, Van?

1188
01:35:37,958 --> 01:35:40,375
Yeah, no, no, no. He's got it.

1189
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:42,958
- Our guy Dieter can do it.
- [Dieter] Ah, fuck.

1190
01:36:40,333 --> 01:36:42,208
Must be the fire egress.

1191
01:36:42,291 --> 01:36:44,000
Yeah, I got it.

1192
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:48,666
It's probably how the last team got in
and how those shamblers got down here.

1193
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:50,166
Hey, what do you think about tofu?

1194
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:51,250
What?

1195
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:53,625
Tofu. My next food truck.

1196
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:56,125
I was thinking,
can make anything out of tofu.

1197
01:36:56,208 --> 01:37:00,375
Tofu burgers, tofu fries,
tofu milkshake, tofu cheesecake.

1198
01:37:01,083 --> 01:37:03,750
I don't know what that is.
Tofu cheesecake. I don't know.

1199
01:37:04,333 --> 01:37:07,625
I thought maybe, since
everyone's going vegan now, you know.

1200
01:37:07,708 --> 01:37:10,375
Humans are figuring out
they're not at the top of the food chain.

1201
01:37:10,458 --> 01:37:11,750
What do you think?

1202
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:13,125
Yeah, it's… it's okay.

1203
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:14,625
- [Scott] Yeah.
- Keep thinking.

1204
01:37:14,708 --> 01:37:18,166
- [Scott] All good up there?
- Uh, yeah. We're secure.

1205
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:27,458
[Guzman] Shit.

1206
01:37:28,916 --> 01:37:30,541
How much we got in the cart?

1207
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:32,083
I'd say 200 grand, easy.

1208
01:37:32,708 --> 01:37:34,916
- [Guzman] Imagine what's in the safe.
- Check this out.

1209
01:37:40,791 --> 01:37:43,291
That is the most money
I've ever held in my hand.

1210
01:37:43,875 --> 01:37:46,291
As soon as that door opens,
it's a rounding error,

1211
01:37:47,125 --> 01:37:48,041
toilet paper.

1212
01:37:48,125 --> 01:37:49,958
I'll take it if you don't want it.

1213
01:37:50,041 --> 01:37:51,541
No, that's cool. I got it.

1214
01:37:52,125 --> 01:37:54,833
- Are you sure?
- I got it.

1215
01:38:44,833 --> 01:38:45,833
Oh, my God.

1216
01:38:54,166 --> 01:38:56,125
[Dieter] Guys, I've… [clears throat]

1217
01:38:57,875 --> 01:39:01,000
I've done it. I've done it.

1218
01:39:01,083 --> 01:39:04,041
Wait, what?
You did it? Like… like, "did it" did it?

1219
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
He did it.

1220
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:12,073
[Dieter] The only thing
that's left is to turn the wheel.

1221
01:39:12,625 --> 01:39:14,708
As it was inevitable that we won.

1222
01:39:16,541 --> 01:39:18,958
Mr. Vanderohe, would you do me the honor?

1223
01:40:35,375 --> 01:40:37,041
All right, come on. Let's go, guys.

1224
01:40:37,916 --> 01:40:40,208
We got about 20 minutes
before this place is dust.

1225
01:40:40,791 --> 01:40:42,791
- Let's pack this shit up and go.
- [Dieter] Yeah.

1226
01:40:44,708 --> 01:40:47,916
[Scott] Hey, Vanny,
where's your head at now, bud?

1227
01:40:48,833 --> 01:40:50,458
[Vanderohe] It's in a good place, Scott.

1228
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:52,416
It's in a good fucking place.

1229
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:53,500
[Dieter] Mr. Vanderohe.

1230
01:40:57,791 --> 01:41:01,041
[Vanderohe] Let's go, Guz. Let's get it.

1231
01:42:11,916 --> 01:42:13,625
Just like old times, right?

1232
01:42:13,708 --> 01:42:15,291
Well, not just like old times

1233
01:42:15,916 --> 01:42:17,041
but just as crazy.

1234
01:42:17,791 --> 01:42:18,791
Yeah.

1235
01:42:19,291 --> 01:42:21,000
What's wrong?

1236
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:24,291
I don't know, Scott.

1237
01:42:24,916 --> 01:42:28,458
Hey, you can talk to me. What's up?

1238
01:42:29,083 --> 01:42:31,000
- You think so?
- [Scott] Yeah.

1239
01:42:31,791 --> 01:42:33,500
You're really stupid. You know that?

1240
01:42:34,958 --> 01:42:36,726
[Scott] Did I miss something?
'Cause we're richer...

1241
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:39,166
I didn't come here
for the money, dumb shit.

1242
01:42:39,666 --> 01:42:42,291
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'll take the millions.

1243
01:42:42,958 --> 01:42:45,875
But… I came here for you.

1244
01:42:48,125 --> 01:42:54,125
I thought we could have had something,
but then you just… went away.

1245
01:42:56,875 --> 01:43:00,666
It's just that seeing you again
is just… bringing it all back.

1246
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:04,875
And it's not that I've been waiting.
You know, I… I haven't.

1247
01:43:04,958 --> 01:43:06,625
I'm happy.

1248
01:43:06,708 --> 01:43:08,416
Well, I'm… I'm fine.

1249
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:13,291
I just thought that… maybe…

1250
01:43:14,791 --> 01:43:18,291
I thought I'd fucked that up… forever.

1251
01:43:21,083 --> 01:43:22,583
Forever is a long time.

1252
01:43:23,458 --> 01:43:26,041
I'm realizing
that I've been wrong about everything.

1253
01:43:27,333 --> 01:43:29,750
About you and me, me and Kate.

1254
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:37,583
Have you seen Kate?

1255
01:43:40,041 --> 01:43:41,041
Kate?

1256
01:43:42,041 --> 01:43:44,208
- Hey, is Kate down there?
- [Guzman] Not here!

1257
01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:45,851
- Kate!
- [Maria] Where the hell is she?

1258
01:45:29,833 --> 01:45:30,916
[Scott] <i>Kate?</i>

1259
01:45:31,666 --> 01:45:32,666
Kate!

1260
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:36,833
Goddamn it! I know where she went.

1261
01:45:36,916 --> 01:45:39,083
[Maria] Scott, listen to me.
Let's think this through.

1262
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:41,666
- Wait for the rest...
- There's nothing to think about.

1263
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:44,333
I know where she went.
She's my daughter. I'll get her back.

1264
01:45:44,416 --> 01:45:46,375
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

1265
01:45:46,458 --> 01:45:48,666
I'm not gonna let you go out there alone.

1266
01:45:53,125 --> 01:45:54,125
Thank you.

1267
01:46:51,458 --> 01:46:52,750
[Martin] This way out!

1268
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:54,750
[Lilly] Let's go.

1269
01:46:57,875 --> 01:46:59,791
Let's go!

1270
01:47:15,166 --> 01:47:16,083
What do you think?

1271
01:47:16,166 --> 01:47:17,000
The money.

1272
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:18,083
The money. Okay.

1273
01:47:19,458 --> 01:47:20,875
Guzman, cover this corner.

1274
01:47:30,916 --> 01:47:32,000
Fuck!

1275
01:47:32,625 --> 01:47:34,416
Come on, Dieter! Come on!

1276
01:47:49,083 --> 01:47:50,208
[Martin] No, no, no!

1277
01:47:53,708 --> 01:47:56,208
- [Lilly] Hey, what are you doing?
- [Martin] Whoo!

1278
01:47:56,291 --> 01:47:57,958
Martin, let us out of here.

1279
01:47:58,041 --> 01:48:01,291
[chuckling] Oh, my God, I got you twice.
I got you twice.

1280
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:03,041
Slow learner.

1281
01:48:03,083 --> 01:48:05,500
Tanaka doesn't
give a shit about the money.

1282
01:48:06,333 --> 01:48:09,916
What's in this bag
is worth ten times what's in that vault.

1283
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,708
Okay, I'm gonna go kill
that dumb-ass pilot,

1284
01:48:12,791 --> 01:48:15,291
now that she's
fixed the chopper, fly myself out of here.

1285
01:48:15,375 --> 01:48:16,708
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1286
01:48:17,250 --> 01:48:19,875
- [chuckles] Moron.
- Let us out of here!

1287
01:48:33,916 --> 01:48:34,916
Fuck.

1288
01:50:54,333 --> 01:50:56,041
[in slow motion] No!

1289
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,375
Fire in the hole!

1290
01:51:40,041 --> 01:51:41,041
Hey, baby.

1291
01:51:41,916 --> 01:51:42,916
You still with me?

1292
01:51:44,291 --> 01:51:45,291
Come on, now.

1293
01:51:48,041 --> 01:51:49,041
Damn it!

1294
01:53:32,583 --> 01:53:33,583
[Lilly] Three.

1295
01:53:34,875 --> 01:53:37,958
All right. We'll make a run
for that elevator. Get up to the roof.

1296
01:53:38,041 --> 01:53:40,125
Don't stop for anything.

1297
01:54:03,708 --> 01:54:04,708
Go!

1298
01:54:13,916 --> 01:54:15,500
Fuck!

1299
01:54:51,333 --> 01:54:52,333
Come on!

1300
01:54:56,208 --> 01:54:57,250
Let's go!

1301
01:57:49,416 --> 01:57:52,333
Come on! Come on!

1302
01:57:52,416 --> 01:57:54,041
Yeah!

1303
01:57:54,125 --> 01:57:55,291
Come on.

1304
01:58:00,250 --> 01:58:02,458
Peters! What the hell?

1305
01:58:02,541 --> 01:58:04,125
Give me 30 seconds.

1306
01:58:15,208 --> 01:58:16,408
[Scott] What the hell is that?

1307
01:58:16,458 --> 01:58:18,041
[Lilly] The head of his queen.

1308
01:58:18,125 --> 01:58:20,666
Martin said he'd let everyone
out of the camps if I helped him.

1309
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:22,500
If I didn't say anything.

1310
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:24,500
Liar!

1311
01:58:24,583 --> 01:58:26,416
[Peters] Goddamn it! Come on!

1312
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:27,875
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1313
01:58:27,958 --> 01:58:30,583
I know what I'm doing. Just go!

1314
01:58:30,666 --> 01:58:31,666
[Lilly] I'll hold him.

1315
01:58:32,291 --> 01:58:33,500
Go! Now!

1316
01:58:34,125 --> 01:58:35,125
Go!

1317
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:39,458
[Lilly] That's right, motherfucker.

1318
01:58:40,083 --> 01:58:42,541
One more step, and I'll blow her head off.

1319
01:58:44,208 --> 01:58:45,750
Well, more off.

1320
01:58:47,208 --> 01:58:48,208
What are we doing?

1321
01:58:48,916 --> 01:58:49,916
Just go!

1322
01:58:50,625 --> 01:58:51,791
Let's go!

1323
02:00:02,708 --> 02:00:03,750
Goddamn it.

1324
02:00:03,833 --> 02:00:06,125
Scott, was that
a zombie in a goddamn cape?

1325
02:00:06,208 --> 02:00:07,416
Just fly.

1326
02:00:08,208 --> 02:00:09,541
Where's the money?

1327
02:00:10,458 --> 02:00:11,541
There is no money.

1328
02:00:12,041 --> 02:00:13,041
But, Peters,

1329
02:00:13,666 --> 02:00:15,916
Kate's at the Olympus.
We got to go get her.

1330
02:00:17,458 --> 02:00:18,958
How much time do we have?

1331
02:00:21,166 --> 02:00:23,416
- We got about nine minutes.
- Goddamn it!

1332
02:00:24,833 --> 02:00:26,750
You son of a bitch! If we do this…

1333
02:00:29,375 --> 02:00:31,125
You better find her, man.

1334
02:00:58,958 --> 02:00:59,958
Oh, my God.

1335
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:01,583
- [Geeta] Kate?
- Geeta.

1336
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:04,583
- Kate.
- Geeta, I found you. You're alive.

1337
02:01:04,666 --> 02:01:07,583
- [Geeta] Oh, my God, Kate. Oh, Kate.
- Oh, my God.

1338
02:01:07,666 --> 02:01:09,166
Kate, you came back for me.

1339
02:01:32,333 --> 02:01:33,375
[Scott] Hey, Peters.

1340
02:01:34,125 --> 02:01:35,583
Don't screw me.

1341
02:01:36,208 --> 02:01:37,375
Just go!

1342
02:01:50,166 --> 02:01:51,416
- Are you bitten?
- No.

1343
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:53,833
- Are you bitten?
- He hasn't gotten to us yet.

1344
02:01:53,916 --> 02:01:56,791
Okay, we need to go right now.
Come with me. Come with me.

1345
02:01:58,208 --> 02:01:59,208
Okay.

1346
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,333
Kate? Kate?

1347
02:02:09,458 --> 02:02:11,833
Kate! God.

1348
02:02:11,916 --> 02:02:12,958
Fuck!

1349
02:02:31,958 --> 02:02:33,083
Sadie!

1350
02:02:44,708 --> 02:02:45,708
Kate!

1351
02:03:05,041 --> 02:03:06,708
[Geeta] Kate, let's go.

1352
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:10,916
Let's go!

1353
02:03:23,458 --> 02:03:24,458
[Scott] Kate!

1354
02:03:51,958 --> 02:03:52,958
[Kate] Damn.

1355
02:04:01,083 --> 02:04:02,083
[Scott] Kate!

1356
02:04:36,666 --> 02:04:37,750
She left us.

1357
02:04:39,541 --> 02:04:42,250
Goddamn it. She left us.

1358
02:04:59,541 --> 02:05:01,333
Wait, you guys… you guys hear that?

1359
02:05:21,625 --> 02:05:25,625
I know, I know. Somewhere between
leaving your ass and saving my own,

1360
02:05:25,708 --> 02:05:28,083
I developed a conscience.

1361
02:05:28,166 --> 02:05:29,375
It's exhausting.

1362
02:05:31,041 --> 02:05:33,083
Get in. Come on, let's go.

1363
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,000
- [Scott] Go, go!
- Holy shit! Hold on!

1364
02:06:05,291 --> 02:06:06,166
Hold on!

1365
02:06:49,291 --> 02:06:50,458
No!

1366
02:07:58,583 --> 02:07:59,625
No!

1367
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:29,583
Dad? [coughing]

1368
02:10:29,666 --> 02:10:30,875
Dad?

1369
02:10:35,625 --> 02:10:37,375
Hey. Hey.

1370
02:10:39,583 --> 02:10:40,833
Dad, I'm right…

1371
02:10:46,333 --> 02:10:48,041
[softly] Okay. Okay.

1372
02:10:55,041 --> 02:10:56,708
Oh, thank God you're okay.

1373
02:11:01,333 --> 02:11:03,916
Hey. Hey, it's not so bad.

1374
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,000
It's not so bad.

1375
02:11:06,166 --> 02:11:09,208
It's fine. It's not as deep…

1376
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:11,875
You don't have to do that.

1377
02:11:14,375 --> 02:11:15,375
Don't do that.

1378
02:11:19,375 --> 02:11:20,625
I know what this means.

1379
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:23,541
Don't.

1380
02:11:25,708 --> 02:11:27,208
- Hey.
- No.

1381
02:11:28,333 --> 02:11:29,625
I've been thinking.

1382
02:11:32,708 --> 02:11:35,208
I've been thinking a lot, Kate.

1383
02:11:39,666 --> 02:11:41,500
It's got to be lobster rolls.

1384
02:11:46,208 --> 02:11:47,625
You know, the food truck.

1385
02:11:48,875 --> 02:11:50,041
Yeah.

1386
02:11:50,125 --> 02:11:51,458
Scott's lobster rolls.

1387
02:11:52,791 --> 02:11:55,166
'Cause everybody loves
a goddamn lobster roll, right?

1388
02:11:55,250 --> 02:11:56,458
[Kate] Yeah.

1389
02:11:56,541 --> 02:11:59,333
Everyone loves a goddamn lobster roll.

1390
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:02,500
Hey.

1391
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:05,875
Hey, I got something for you.

1392
02:12:16,875 --> 02:12:17,875
Here.

1393
02:12:18,708 --> 02:12:20,833
I know it's not millions, but

1394
02:12:22,166 --> 02:12:25,000
this should get
Geeta's kids out of the camp for good.

1395
02:12:25,083 --> 02:12:27,625
Here. Here, you take that.

1396
02:12:29,291 --> 02:12:30,750
You go and make it right.

1397
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:34,666
[crying] Okay. Okay.

1398
02:12:39,041 --> 02:12:40,666
I'm so goddamn proud of you.

1399
02:12:43,875 --> 02:12:45,166
I love you, Kate.

1400
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,125
I'm sorry I ran.

1401
02:12:54,083 --> 02:12:55,583
I'm such a coward.

1402
02:12:57,583 --> 02:13:01,833
You're not a coward.
[sniffling] You're not a coward.

1403
02:13:04,958 --> 02:13:06,708
You're the bravest man I know.

1404
02:13:11,583 --> 02:13:13,208
[shakily] I love you so much.

1405
02:13:14,958 --> 02:13:16,166
I'm so sorry.

1406
02:13:20,916 --> 02:13:21,916
Hey.

1407
02:13:22,750 --> 02:13:24,708
- Yeah?
- Let me just look at you.

1408
02:13:43,583 --> 02:13:45,541
Dad. Dad.

1409
02:13:57,833 --> 02:14:00,166
I'm so sorry.

1410
02:15:45,291 --> 02:15:46,916
Hey!

1411
02:15:52,958 --> 02:15:53,791
Hey!

1412
02:16:56,416 --> 02:16:59,136
[Vanderohe] I would like to rent
that gray and black plane out there.

1413
02:17:00,291 --> 02:17:03,500
I'm sorry, sir. Unfortunately,
that's a privately owned aircraft.

1414
02:17:03,583 --> 02:17:07,250
I'm not able to just rent you that plane.

1415
02:17:08,166 --> 02:17:09,791
Um…

1416
02:17:21,750 --> 02:17:23,166
Let me see what I can do.

1417
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,083
[flight attendant] Enjoy.

1418
02:17:25,166 --> 02:17:26,958
Well, that is amazing.

1419
02:17:28,250 --> 02:17:31,500
Honestly, how do you ladies make that
in that little kitchen back there?

1420
02:17:31,583 --> 02:17:32,666
It's like magic.

1421
02:17:32,750 --> 02:17:33,750
<i>Voilà.</i>

1422
02:17:35,208 --> 02:17:37,083
We should… we should make a toast.

1423
02:17:38,166 --> 02:17:39,875
Oh, we can't. We're working.

1424
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:41,833
No, no. Just one…

1425
02:17:42,583 --> 02:17:45,833
One glass, one toast.
It would make one happy man.

1426
02:17:45,916 --> 02:17:47,208
It'd mean a lot to me.

1427
02:17:48,583 --> 02:17:50,983
- What the hell? Let's do it. [chuckles]
- That's the spirit.

1428
02:17:51,833 --> 02:17:54,458
To quote
the great Joseph Campbell, he said,

1429
02:17:54,541 --> 02:17:56,791
"It is by going down into the abyss

1430
02:17:57,541 --> 02:18:00,416
where we recover the treasures of life.
Where you stumble,

1431
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:03,166
there lies your treasure."

1432
02:18:03,958 --> 02:18:06,041
To the ironic twist of the unknown.

1433
02:18:06,125 --> 02:18:07,708
- Bottoms up.
- Cheers.

1434
02:18:07,791 --> 02:18:09,041
Cheers.

1435
02:18:10,791 --> 02:18:11,833
[flight attendant] Mmm.

1436
02:18:12,875 --> 02:18:14,500
- That's nice.
- [Vanderohe] Hmm.

1437
02:18:15,958 --> 02:18:19,125
[gasps] All right. All right.
Let's sit back down there.

1438
02:18:19,208 --> 02:18:20,291
There we go. Okay.

1439
02:18:20,375 --> 02:18:22,083
Here, take these.

1440
02:18:22,833 --> 02:18:25,791
- I'm sorry. I'm a little embarrassed.
- Okay. It's okay, honey.

1441
02:18:25,875 --> 02:18:27,250
I'm good. I'm good.

1442
02:18:27,333 --> 02:18:28,833
You don't look so good.

1443
02:18:29,916 --> 02:18:31,625
- Long day.
- Your skin is really cold.

1444
02:18:31,708 --> 02:18:33,500
So, I'm gonna let the captain know.

1445
02:18:33,583 --> 02:18:34,875
No. Let me just hit the head

1446
02:18:34,958 --> 02:18:37,118
and splash some water on my face.
I'll be good as gold.

1447
02:18:38,416 --> 02:18:40,666
- Okay. All right, come on.
- [Vanderohe] Okay.

1448
02:18:40,750 --> 02:18:43,250
- Yep. Let's get up.
- Okay. Thank you.

1449
02:18:44,666 --> 02:18:46,392
- Let's get you in.
- [Vanderohe] It's right here?

1450
02:18:46,416 --> 02:18:48,708
- Yep, right there. That's it, right there.
- Yeah, okay.

1451
02:18:49,791 --> 02:18:51,916
- [flight attendant] You sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

1452
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,851
- I'm fine.
- [flight attendant] Okay, all right.

1453
02:18:56,333 --> 02:18:57,333
Come on.

1454
02:19:13,958 --> 02:19:14,958
Ooh.

1455
02:19:16,833 --> 02:19:18,684
[pilot] <i>Good evening,</i>
<i>this is your captain speaking.</i>

1456
02:19:18,708 --> 02:19:21,708
<i>We will be beginning
our final descent into Mexico City.</i>

1457
02:19:21,791 --> 02:19:25,208
<i>I'd like to ask you to please return
to your seat and fasten your safety belt.</i>

1458
02:19:25,291 --> 02:19:28,000
<i>The local time is 9:30 p.m</i>…

1459
02:19:28,083 --> 02:19:31,375
<i>…and the temperature is 67 degrees.</i>

1460
02:19:32,416 --> 02:19:33,750
<i>Thanks for flying with us.</i>

1461
02:19:36,708 --> 02:19:38,041
Fuck.
