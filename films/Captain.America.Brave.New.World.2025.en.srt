1
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,875
Sir, one minute warning.

2
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,250
Congratulations again.

3
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,875
Heard anything from Betty,
from my daughter?

4
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,917
No, sir. We tried her several times.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,083
Okay.

6
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:42,500
Thank you.

7
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:48,333
<i>All right, New Hampshire,
we are moments away.</i>

8
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:50,875
<i>Are you ready?</i>

9
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:56,792
Ready for Ross! Ready for Ross!
Ready for Ross! Ready for Ross!

10
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,958
Ready for Ross! Ready for Ross!

11
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:01,750
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

12
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:05,875
<i>the next President of
the United States of America,</i>

13
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,208
<i>Thaddeus Ross!</i>

14
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,750
Thank you.

15
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:35,417
Tonight, America has spoken

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,417
in one of the most important
elections of our lifetimes.

17
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,167
We've recognized the urgency
of this moment.

18
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:48,833
From the disappearance of half of mankind

19
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:51,792
to the emergence of a celestial mass

20
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,792
in the Indian Ocean,

21
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:57,875
the threats we face show
no signs of slowing down.

22
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:03,958
But the only way we can
overcome them is together!

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,125
<i>Tonight, President Ross</i>

24
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,167
<i>embraced the theme of togetherness
in his acceptance speech,</i>

25
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,708
<i>but his past tells a different story,</i>

26
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:14,917
<i>especially when it comes to
working with heroes like Captain America.</i>

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,417
<i>As two of our nation's
most important leaders,</i>

28
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,917
<i>some question if they can overcome
their at-times tumultuous history</i>

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,750
<i>to face the challenges ahead.</i>

30
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,793
- Here you go, Cap.
<i>- During his time as a...</i>

31
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,000
Put your money away. It's on the house.

32
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,417
Thanks, Charlie.

33
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,208
<i>leading to Ross</i>

34
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:35,875
<i>being branded with the moniker
of "the Hulk Hunter."</i>

35
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,958
<i>Following Hulk and the Abomination's
destruction of Harlem,</i>

36
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,333
<i>Ross was criticized for what some called</i>

37
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:44,667
<i>"an unwarranted outburst"
during a press conference.</i>

38
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,292
<i>In fact, many blamed Ross
for the collateral damage,</i>

39
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:52,917
<i>believing it was his relentless pursuit
of Banner's Hulk that led to the rampage.</i>

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,708
<i>It also resulted in the President-elect's
estrangement from his daughter,</i>

41
00:02:56,792 --> 00:03:00,292
<i>Doctor Betty Ross,
Bruce Banner's ex-girlfriend.</i>

42
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,875
<i>But in a surprising turn of events,
he managed to shift the narrative,</i>

43
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,458
<i>and silence his harshest critics</i>

44
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:08,875
<i>by apprehending the man responsible
for the Abomination.</i>

45
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:39,420
How we lookin' down there?

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,167
Well, SERPENT mercenaries
entered with a package about an hour ago.

47
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,417
They're handing it
to the buyer any minute.

48
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,000
We know what they're carrying?

49
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,958
That is classified per the White House.

50
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:49,750
Of course it is.

51
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,045
Where's Eagle-One?
We have strike authorization.

52
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,958
Eagle-One is entering
the target airspace now.

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,458
Upload the compound's covert entry points.

54
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:03,125
Covert? Really? You must be new.

55
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:15,792
Wait for it.

56
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:34,503
Sam, SEAL team is six minutes out.

57
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,703
Copy that.

58
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,125
How the hell did he just do that?

59
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,708
Cap's gear was a gift from the Wakandans
for helping them out.

60
00:04:57,792 --> 00:05:00,583
I heard even the wrapping
paper was made of vibranium.

61
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,417
No, man. I'm kidding. Come on.

62
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,042
Joaquin, Redwing's pickin' up
hostages inside.

63
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,708
- I'm goin' in.
<i>- </i>Negative.

64
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:13,878
The package is the priority.

65
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,587
<i>Have the SEALs track down the package.</i>

66
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,083
I'm on the hostages.

67
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:20,667
Redwing, send them a scan of the building.

68
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,333
What is it?

69
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:25,417
That's Sidewinder.
He's the head of SERPENT.

70
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,250
He's not supposed to be here.

71
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:38,875
You're praying, <i>Padre.</i>

72
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,208
The buyer told me
to meet him here.

73
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,542
I'm not leaving until
I get the money owed to me.

74
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,958
<i>Padre.</i>

75
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,375
<i>Padre. Padre, Padre, Padre.</i>

76
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:03,208
We did not come all this way
to hear rosaries, Father.

77
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,000
Where is the buyer?

78
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,833
Where is the buyer?

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't know.

80
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,587
- I don't know.
- No. I don't know... No. I don't know...

81
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:12,750
Kill them.

82
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:15,128
- No. No!
- Kill them one at a time.

83
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:17,833
<i>Silencio!</i>

84
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,837
<i>Captain America is here. Do you copy?</i>

85
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:21,667
Move, move, move!

86
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,083
<i>Vámonos, vámonos.</i>

87
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,708
Get the package outta here.

88
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,920
SERPENT's on the move
with the canister, Sam.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,750
I'm kinda busy right now!

90
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,875
Redwing, on my mark.

91
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,125
Stop.

92
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,917
Stay back! Or we'll shoot them.

93
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,375
Don't worry.

94
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,417
You have been very brave.

95
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,292
Thank you, Captain America.
Thank you.

96
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:51,958
Thank you.

97
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:53,042
You're welcome.

98
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:57,083
SERPENT's gettin' farther away
with the canister, Sam,

99
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,708
and Sidewinder's headed to the chapel.

100
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,420
I already know what you're trying to do.

101
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,208
You can't be at two places at once.

102
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,750
All right, this time.

103
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,083
- <i>But don't get yourself killed.</i>
- No dying. Copy that.

104
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,458
Buyer didn't show.
Looks like you need better clients.

105
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,250
You don't need to worry.

106
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,458
I'll find whoever wasted my time.

107
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:27,208
You have bigger concerns.

108
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,708
The Captain America I dreamt of killing
was bigger than you.

109
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:57,458
I'm happy to disappoint.

110
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,667
I bet you break easy.

111
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,542
Not that easy.

112
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:18,542
Not that hard.

113
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,292
I heard your rib go.
You need a minute?

114
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,500
Nope. Nope,
let's get this over with.

115
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,417
I got shit to do today.

116
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,708
Whoo-hoo!

117
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,917
Damn.

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,375
Nobody saw that.

119
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,125
Sam, package is secured.

120
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,750
I'll add your star to my collection.

121
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,500
Need a minute?

122
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,208
That's what I thought.

123
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,750
Save some for us, Cap.

124
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,917
He has a fractured arm, so be gentle.

125
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:47,000
"Keep your face
always to the sunshine,

126
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,292
and the shadows will fall behind you."

127
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,875
The quote was Betty's idea.

128
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,875
She's still not speaking with you?

129
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:54,958
No.

130
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:57,292
She doesn't believe I've changed.

131
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,333
Really changed.

132
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,667
I don't think I'm gonna get another shot.

133
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:07,542
Comin' up on the end of
my first hundred days, Leila.

134
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,625
They're gonna define me.

135
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,292
This treaty's gotta work.

136
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,042
Hello.

137
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,167
<i>Mr. President,
the mission was a success.</i>

138
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,000
All right, fill me in.

139
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,708
<i>Cap and the SEAL team
saved the hostages.</i>

140
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:29,417
<i>The package is secure
and en route to the US.</i>

141
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,792
- How's your brother?
- Wow, you remembered.

142
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,458
- He's in the Air Force.
- Yeah.

143
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:36,462
Probably 'cause of you.

144
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:37,942
I try not to hold that against him.

145
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,083
It's a weird place for a handoff, right?

146
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,000
Wide open, soft perimeter.

147
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,833
You think the buyer
ever intended on showin' up?

148
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:47,333
You think SERPENT got played?

149
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:48,417
What are they sayin'?

150
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,750
Same thing. Contract was anonymous.

151
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,958
Fifty mil to steal the
canister en route to Japan.

152
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:55,708
Then show up here and meet the buyer.

153
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,083
Let us know if you get a trace
on Sidewinder.

154
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:03,583
- Good work.
- Thank you.

155
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,875
You'll notice, I did not die,

156
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,000
and people are saying
I did not die in style.

157
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,167
Who is saying that?

158
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,833
- People.
- What people?

159
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:18,417
Everybody. Everybody is saying that.

160
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,375
Look, tell me I don't make
your old gear look brand-new.

161
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,875
You've got on the greaves upside down.

162
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,208
I'm joking.

163
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,750
You look good, man.

164
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,083
All right. Fair enough.

165
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,587
That means that you're finally gonna
introduce me to Ant-Man?

166
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,792
Nope.

167
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,083
Well, at least you gotta teach me
your aerial kick, man.

168
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:38,292
Look, if I'm gonna be Falcon,
I gotta know everything.

169
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,167
In no way are you ready for that.

170
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,087
But I got a guy who'll
teach you the fundamentals

171
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:43,125
from the ground up.

172
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,208
Absolutely.

173
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:46,167
Now, he's not a people person.

174
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,045
So you gotta learn
how to keep your mouth shut.

175
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,208
Can you do that?

176
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,375
He's gonna love me, bro!
Are you kidding me?

177
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,792
- That's not the right answer.
- He's gonna love me.

178
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:03,792
What's up, OG?

179
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,167
Who's the pretty boy?

180
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,962
"Pretty boy"? You didn't
tell gramps about me?

181
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,042
I'm the new Falcon.

182
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,750
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

183
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,625
This is Joaquin Torres.

184
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,417
Been workin' with him for three years.

185
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,292
I haven't figured out
how to shut him up yet.

186
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,625
So what are we doing here?
Orthopedics?

187
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,750
How to relearn how to walk
after you break a hip?

188
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,125
Sh...

189
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,125
Shit.

190
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,583
That's Isaiah Bradley.

191
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,792
The... The Isaiah Bradley?

192
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,087
You brought me to the forgotten Cap?
Why didn't you say something?

193
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,125
It is a pleasure to meet you.

194
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,792
Your missions in Korea are legendary.

195
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,795
And what, and after that, no action?
I mean, a lot's changed in the world.

196
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,253
We could've used another super soldier.

197
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,792
The United States government
threw me in prison for 30 years.

198
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,875
They experimented on me for decades.

199
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,333
Yikes, that's... that sucks.

200
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,625
Can we start?

201
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,542
Let's do it.

202
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,208
No vibranium wings,

203
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,417
no shield, no super soldier serum.

204
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:05,417
I wanna see if he's got three in him.

205
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,375
Get those flags, Sam!

206
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:09,667
Cap v Cap!

207
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,875
That's one.

208
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,167
Let's go!

209
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,075
Orthopedic.

210
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,958
That's two.

211
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,583
I'm sorry. What were you sayin'?

212
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,042
See? Not a people person.

213
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,125
- In a fight, the last hit...
- Is the only hit that matters.

214
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,917
I know. Shut up, but thanks.

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,708
All right, that's it.
Tag me in. I'm ready.

216
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,292
Captain America doesn't
get to take five. Let's go.

217
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,750
I need to take this.

218
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,958
I'm not takin' five.

219
00:14:57,542 --> 00:15:00,083
- You still got the plastic on.
- No! I don't...

220
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,333
Maybe I wanted it on there.

221
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:07,583
You want me to make the text bigger?
So you can read it?

222
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,292
Yeah, I'll hold for the President.

223
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,000
Where you going?

224
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:23,333
You wanna talk about it?

225
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,250
It just doesn't sit right with me.

226
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:34,250
Captain America,
answering to the President.

227
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,875
The President of the country
who stole your life?

228
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,000
It's not just that.

229
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,875
We're talkin' about
Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross.

230
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,833
Son of a bitch earned that nickname, too.

231
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:46,042
Look, I know, Isaiah, firsthand.

232
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,583
Remember, Ross threw me in the Raft.

233
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,000
Hounded me, Steve and Natasha for years.

234
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,333
So why are you workin' for him?

235
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,708
As long as you do,

236
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:57,958
Captain America
stands for people like him.

237
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,500
You've got no business
workin' for the government.

238
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,250
You see what's going on out there?

239
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,792
The country is lost.

240
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,208
Standing next to the President,
even if it's Ross...

241
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,750
it gives people hope.

242
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,500
Now, come on, give me some credit.

243
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,170
I have a friend who works
in the White House.

244
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,083
She'll let me know if Ross
starts acting out of turn.

245
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,625
None of this means I forgot about you.

246
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,250
I see what you're doin'.

247
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,750
What?

248
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,667
Pullin' that counseling bullshit on me.

249
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:32,042
Look, trust me.

250
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,417
My eyes are wide open on this, okay?

251
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,292
I know Ross will never change,

252
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,375
but he is the President.

253
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,625
So you gonna tell me what he wanted
or are you plannin' on makin' me guess?

254
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,708
He invited Joaquin and I
to the White House,

255
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:51,375
and I said under one condition.

256
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,667
If he extended an invitation
to you as well.

257
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,333
I know you're gonna say no,

258
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:59,542
but it would mean a lot to me
if you were there.

259
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,792
We just...

260
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,250
gotta get you a suit.

261
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,917
I have a damn suit.

262
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,250
For real?

263
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,292
Then why are you always wearin'
that ratty-ass sweatsuit?

264
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,042
Come on, you gonna come or what?

265
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,170
See, Isaiah?
This is what I'm talking about.

266
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,875
Now you're going to
the White House. Look at that.

267
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,295
- You look good, OG.
- Wow, man. Damn.

268
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,003
I told you I was gonna get you
out of those sweats.

269
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,708
Look at you now, man.

270
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:33,125
Yeah, I didn't know
Men's Warehouse made that size.

271
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,833
Hey, Faith and I got married in this.

272
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:38,545
Okay, all right, all right.

273
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,628
I'm sure she would be proud.

274
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,042
I hope so.

275
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:45,792
Feels strange to walk right
into the belly of the beast.

276
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,628
- Hey, I'm sure it can't be easy.
- It ain't.

277
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:51,333
Which is why we gotta celebrate.
I don't care if it is Ross in charge.

278
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:53,375
We are guests of honor
at the White House, man!

279
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,878
- When does that ever happen?
- Right.

280
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,375
And they sent us a limo, man.

281
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,667
What?

282
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,417
And we look good.

283
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,333
- Yeah.
- What?

284
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:02,417
Old school, you got your smell-good on.

285
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,542
What?

286
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,333
And you got the houndstooth on.

287
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,833
And we got the good stuff.

288
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:10,042
It's party time.

289
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,000
Captain America!

290
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,875
Captain, Captain, over here.

291
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,250
- Cap, over here!
- Mr. Bradley.

292
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,337
Over here!

293
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:28,875
Hey, Isaiah. Check it out.

294
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:40,333
Whoa, man, look at this!

295
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:44,125
We gotta get a pic.

296
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,208
Let's do it.

297
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,708
<i>Tres</i> amigos on three.

298
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,750
<i>Uno, dos, tres</i>.

299
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:54,628
Yeah, that's my
new wallpaper. Look at that.

300
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:55,753
- Pretty good.
- It's good?

301
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,295
- Can you send it to me?
- Yeah, I'll AirDrop it to you right now.

302
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,292
You do know what AirDrop is, right?

303
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,375
Of course, I know what AirDrop is.

304
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,208
What's AirDrop?

305
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:07,292
<i>You see, you should have it.
Just hit "Accept" and it pops up.</i>

306
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,292
<i>- I did that.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.</i>

307
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,167
The President needs Mr. Wilson.

308
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,542
I'll see you guys inside.

309
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:16,667
- Hey.
- Hey.

310
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,208
Sam, just keep an open mind.

311
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:20,167
Why? What am I walking into?

312
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,542
Thi... This is not the picture you took.

313
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,000
I sent you the wrong picture.

314
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,083
My Lord.

315
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,792
Well, that's a very good point.

316
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,875
I'll consider it.

317
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:30,750
Wilson.

318
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,625
Folks, can you give us the room?

319
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:39,958
Thanks.

320
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:42,208
Doctor's orders.

321
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:45,708
Not quite a cigar,
but better than that damn gum.

322
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:47,875
Thanks for comin' in.

323
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,500
Welcome to the White House.

324
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,250
Well, thank you for the invite, sir.

325
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,708
I have to admit, I'm still
gettin' used to the new look.

326
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:58,708
Yeah, well,
they said lose the mustache

327
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,083
or lose the election.

328
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,208
Thanks for your help down in Mexico.

329
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:08,458
Retrieving that canister might
just have saved this treaty.

330
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,417
I was just doing my job, sir.

331
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,750
You and I haven't always agreed

332
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:16,125
on how much latitude
enhanced individuals deserve.

333
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:20,042
But what you've accomplished
has given me reason to reconsider.

334
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:25,250
Which is why I want you, Captain America,

335
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,375
to help me rebuild the Avengers.

336
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,542
- The Avengers?
- Yes, sir.

337
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,167
Well, with all due respect, sir,

338
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,083
when you passed the Sokovia Accords,
you tore the Avengers apart.

339
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,208
Why the change of heart?

340
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:46,000
I represent all Americans now.

341
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:51,833
Hell, half of 'em wouldn't even
be here without the Avengers.

342
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,958
The country needs this.

343
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:58,625
And when we disagree on
how to manage a situation...

344
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,625
what happens then?

345
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,500
We figure it out together.

346
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:07,792
Look, you don't have to
give me an answer now.

347
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,917
Just think about it.

348
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,708
Prime Minister Ozaki.

349
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:19,333
- Great to see you, sir.
- And you.

350
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:20,625
Thank you for being here.

351
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,500
Here we are.

352
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,167
Sam Wilson, Prime Minister Ozaki.

353
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:32,250
Not bad.

354
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,458
- Would you like a picture?
- Sure.

355
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:35,750
Sam, please.

356
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,755
Now, stand a little bit closer.

357
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,083
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

358
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,500
Thank you.

359
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,708
Work with me, Sam.

360
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,667
We'll show the world a better way forward.

361
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:58,750
That was unexpected.

362
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,458
Maybe it's an opportunity.

363
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:07,417
So?

364
00:22:07,917 --> 00:22:08,792
How was it?

365
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,917
He asked me to restart the Avengers.

366
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,125
Wait, what now?

367
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,750
- That's huge, man.
- I don't know.

368
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,333
We'd have to work for him.

369
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:18,503
Ladies and gentlemen,

370
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:22,125
the President of the
United States, Thaddeus Ross.

371
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,667
Good evening, everyone. Good evening.

372
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,875
It's my great privilege to host you

373
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:32,208
at the White House
on this historic evening.

374
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:36,667
When the celestial mass
emerged in the Indian Ocean,

375
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,500
we did what we often do.

376
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,583
We squabbled over it.

377
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:46,125
Countries rushed in
to claim it as their own,

378
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:51,042
setting up research facilities
to exploit its resources.

379
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,250
What was found inside that island

380
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,458
is nothing short of
the discovery of the millennium.

381
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:02,000
Its potential applications
in tech, in medicine,

382
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,792
in defense are immeasurable.

383
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:09,583
It's even more indestructible
than vibranium.

384
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:13,958
And it's not controlled
by an isolationist nation.

385
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:18,458
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...

386
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:20,375
adamantium.

387
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:28,333
The first and only refined sample

388
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:30,708
was stolen from a Japanese mining site.

389
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:35,333
But happily, it's been recovered
and is in a secure location.

390
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:40,250
And we have two incredibly
brave men to thank for that.

391
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:44,958
Joaquin Torres and our own
Captain America, Sam Wilson.

392
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:59,500
What we do next with this discovery

393
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,167
will determine how history judges us.

394
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,208
If we ratify this treaty,

395
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:08,750
together we can produce enough adamantium

396
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,917
to fairly and equitably
distribute it around the world.

397
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,875
Sir, you need to sit down.

398
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,958
Isaiah! What are you doing?

399
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:31,458
Sam!

400
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:39,458
- Sir, are you hit?
- No.

401
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:41,125
Go, go, go!

402
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,917
Mr. President, come with me.

403
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:36,792
Shit.

404
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Isaiah!

405
00:26:06,792 --> 00:26:09,750
All team leaders, eyes on! Eyes on!

406
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,792
- Get on the ground now!
- Do not move.

407
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,917
What's happening?

408
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:21,292
I don't know. But you gotta stop.

409
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,375
- We got him right there!
- Move in, move in!

410
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:25,750
- Stop!
- Don't!

411
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:32,833
I can't go back inside, Sam.

412
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:35,333
Run, and it'll be worse than that.

413
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,958
Please, Isaiah.

414
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:57,417
Hey, take it easy!

415
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,917
Watch my suit.

416
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,042
Please, watch my suit.

417
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,583
Cap, I can't let you in.

418
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:21,208
Hey!

419
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:22,542
Sam!

420
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:25,125
Sir, you can't... you can't...

421
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Sir!

422
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:29,583
- Sorry, Mr. President.
- Hey, hey, hey.

423
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:30,875
He stays.

424
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:32,417
Everybody else, out.

425
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,750
Agent Taylor, you too.

426
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,583
Are you okay?

427
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,250
I should be asking you that, sir.

428
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:52,958
Not my first time being shot at.

429
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:54,602
Look, I know how this must look, but...

430
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,792
Can we have a minute?

431
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:01,625
She stays.

432
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:07,125
Meet Ruth Bat-Seraph, my security advisor.

433
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:12,250
Sir, there's no way
Isaiah could have done this.

434
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:14,045
- Except he did.
- Maybe somebody got to him.

435
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,333
You're really defending a man

436
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,750
who just tried to kill
the President in front...

437
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,542
- We don't know what happened.
- Enough.

438
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:23,583
What do we know?

439
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:24,958
There were five shooters.

440
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:26,792
Isaiah was one of them.

441
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,958
As was Secret Service and active military.

442
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,583
This was a coordinated
terrorist attack, sir.

443
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
What else do you have?

444
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:42,167
The song that preceded the shooting,
we think it was a cue for the attack.

445
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,042
Sir, Isaiah looked like
he wasn't in control.

446
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,708
He had no idea where he was.

447
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,542
So you're suggesting what?

448
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,833
Let me investigate.

449
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:52,208
Don't you think you're
a little too close to this?

450
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:54,292
Sir, your inner circle
has been compromised.

451
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:56,458
There's possibility of another attack now.

452
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:58,042
And what exactly do you have to offer

453
00:28:58,125 --> 00:29:00,917
that our entire intelligence
and defense apparatus can't?

454
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,545
Well, I won't sit around and let Isaiah...

455
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:06,208
Look, I know how important
Bradley is to you.

456
00:29:06,292 --> 00:29:08,125
But consider the optics.

457
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:12,875
Captain America conducts
a personal investigation

458
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:16,625
of a friend who tried
to assassinate the President.

459
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:19,667
Isaiah sacrificed everything
for this country.

460
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,958
He's a soldier. A patriot.

461
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,417
He had no reason to do this.

462
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,292
He had every reason.

463
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:27,667
Bradley was in prison
for rescuing his own men,

464
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,167
experimented on for 30 years.

465
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,792
The things done to him are
enough to make anyone snap.

466
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:35,583
Sir, you invited me here to work together.

467
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:38,458
- So let's work together.
- I'm afraid that offer expired

468
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:40,333
when your friend tried to kill me.

469
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:49,458
Sam, you shouldn't even be
in these situations.

470
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:53,042
You're not Steve Rogers.

471
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:56,833
Ruth,

472
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:59,292
you have my full authority
to put this thing to bed.

473
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,875
Before this treaty
gets compromised any further.

474
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:07,458
So that's it?

475
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,750
I'm done?

476
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:11,625
You're done.

477
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:13,708
This is bullshit, and you know it.

478
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,167
This is politics.

479
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:17,875
So you better wise up, son.

480
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,875
"Son." Who you calling "son"?

481
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,833
Sam. What the hell are you doing?

482
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:25,083
I'm going to clear Isaiah.

483
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:26,712
Storming in there ain't gonna help him.

484
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,708
- You need Ross on your side.
- Ross?

485
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:30,583
Open your eyes.

486
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:32,170
I offer to help, and he sends me packin'.

487
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,958
Ross is on his own side.
He always has been.

488
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,083
Either you can't see that,
or you don't want to.

489
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:38,167
Hey.

490
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,167
Don't be that guy.

491
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,917
And what guy is that?

492
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,583
The one who has to do it the hard way.

493
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,667
Looks like I am that guy.

494
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:17,042
<i>The nation remains on high alert.</i>

495
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,208
<i>The Justice Department has
signaled a death penalty case</i>

496
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:22,958
<i>will be pursued against Isaiah Bradley.</i>

497
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:24,750
Just five minutes, Cap.

498
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,917
I could be court-martialed for this.

499
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,208
I appreciate it, Payumo.

500
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:32,292
Yes, sir.

501
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,375
How you holdin' up?

502
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,125
Not so good, brother Sam.

503
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:05,333
Isaiah.

504
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:07,417
Look me in the eye.

505
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,750
Tell me you didn't conspire to kill Ross.

506
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:10,917
Of course I didn't.

507
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,667
What in the world happened
to make you shoot at the President?

508
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,750
I don't know.

509
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,750
You gotta give me more
than "I don't know."

510
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:19,333
Is there anything you remember?

511
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:21,417
I got a haircut,

512
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,792
picked my suit up at
the cleaners and came to you.

513
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,167
We rode in the limo,

514
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,375
took our photo.

515
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:33,958
But my phone was on the fritz.

516
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:37,625
And then, we went over to the East Room.

517
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,750
One moment I'm sittin' there,

518
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,833
the next I'm standin' in that park.

519
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,417
I should have stayed in my damn house,

520
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,917
minded my business.

521
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
No, this isn't on you.

522
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:51,583
Someone's behind all this.

523
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:55,625
Sam, the last thing I want
is for this to touch you.

524
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:04,833
Besides...

525
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:12,958
Look, there ain't no escapin'
for me this time.

526
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,667
I'm gonna die in here.

527
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,458
No, you're not.

528
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:19,792
I'm gonna get you out.

529
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,625
- You wanna help me?
- Of course.

530
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,167
Don't come back.

531
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:36,292
Guard.

532
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:56,958
Sergeant Payumo,
get me a copy of that conversation.

533
00:33:58,208 --> 00:33:59,375
I wanna take another look.

534
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:00,500
Yes, ma'am.

535
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:02,542
And good work with Wilson.

536
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:05,000
Let me know if he pays another visit.

537
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:06,083
Roger that.

538
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:10,292
<i>You get in?</i>

539
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,417
<i>I think I committed
treason and espionage,</i>

540
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,750
but I made it into
the White House's CCTV system.

541
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:17,167
What am I lookin' for?

542
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,045
<i>When Isaiah went off
in the White House,</i>

543
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,958
it made me think of a friend of mine.

544
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:23,208
He was being controlled by trigger words.

545
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:25,417
Do you see any strangers
talkin' to Isaiah?

546
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,250
<i>No, well,
we got there, took a picture,</i>

547
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,333
<i>I AirDropped it to him, but nothin' crazy.</i>

548
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:32,583
Yeah, but he said his phone
was on the fritz.

549
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:33,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

550
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:35,042
Sam, I think I got something.

551
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:37,708
<i>What is it?</i>

552
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:40,000
His phone is like flashing at him.

553
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:45,500
Shit, I got the same thing happening
to one of the other shooters.

554
00:35:08,417 --> 00:35:10,250
What the hell?

555
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,875
Warden Cooper, Ross here.

556
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,708
The prisoner, he's secure?

557
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:21,833
I can confirm the prisoner is in his cell.

558
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:24,500
Do we have eyes on the bastard?
Personally.

559
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,292
I'm looking at him right now, sir.

560
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,500
Thank you, Cooper.

561
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:30,958
Thank you, Mr. President.

562
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:39,500
I keep goin' back to Mexico.

563
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:42,083
We were at the White House
because the buyer never showed.

564
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:46,708
Why hire SERPENT if you have
no intention on collecting?

565
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:48,670
Maybe they were expecting
Captain America to come.

566
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,958
<i>What if the buyer wanted
Captain America to come?</i>

567
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:52,712
And what if they wanted us
at the White House?

568
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:54,128
<i>But how would the buyer predict</i>

569
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:57,833
that we'd get the invite,
or that you would invite Isaiah?

570
00:35:57,917 --> 00:35:59,833
<i>The buyer must be
watching us somehow.</i>

571
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,833
Another thing.

572
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:05,458
Ruth Bat-Seraph, Ross's security advisor,

573
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:07,875
find out what you can about her.

574
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,083
<i>Copy that.</i>

575
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,375
I'll call you back later.

576
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,000
Target eliminated.

577
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:45,583
Stand by for proof of death.

578
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:14,250
No way you came all the way from Mexico
just to blow up my car.

579
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,333
So you must have made up with the buyer.

580
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:19,292
Get him on the phone.

581
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:21,042
Let me see if I can resolve this.

582
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:23,167
"Resolve this"?

583
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,958
The buyer told me everything.

584
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,500
He mentioned that if you
survived the grenade,

585
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:37,417
there was a 77% chance
you'd try to talk me down.

586
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:40,208
Look at that.

587
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,875
The buyer told me a lot actually.

588
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:16,833
After he didn't show in Mexico,

589
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:19,542
he agreed to pay me double
to take you out.

590
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:24,208
What he doesn't know is that
I would kill you for free.

591
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:29,375
How often do you get a chance
to kill Captain America?

592
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,333
You're desperate without your gear.

593
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:50,333
Nope.

594
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:52,000
Just a little meaner.

595
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:01,250
Hello.

596
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:02,833
<i>Well done, Captain.</i>

597
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:05,375
<i>But you're not going to like
what's coming next.</i>

598
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:06,625
<i>Who is this?</i>

599
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:17,292
How can we trust you to lead

600
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:20,583
when you can't even keep
your own house in order?

601
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,167
We have the shooters in custody.

602
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:27,083
All I'm asking for is patience.

603
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:28,708
Patience?

604
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:30,333
From the Hulk Hunter?

605
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:33,375
That was a long time ago.

606
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,292
Well, Mr. President,

607
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:38,917
I was almost killed
in your home yesterday.

608
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,458
And today, you are still
locked in your bunker.

609
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:45,833
You are not in a position
to be asking for anything.

610
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:46,917
I agree.

611
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,833
We should continue this
conversation another time.

612
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:51,792
Gentlemen, wait.

613
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,042
Please.

614
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,708
This treaty is too important
to let it fall apart now.

615
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:59,458
We made a promise to our people.

616
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:01,708
We made a promise to the world.

617
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,292
We must prevail.

618
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:08,208
We'll need Japan to proceed.

619
00:40:08,292 --> 00:40:11,250
And Prime Minister Ozaki's absence

620
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:12,667
speaks volumes.

621
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,875
I'll get Japan back to the table.

622
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:17,125
Ozaki and I go back a long way.

623
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,917
He's running for re-election.

624
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,875
He needs to assert leadership
on this treaty.

625
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:27,583
All right, Mr. President,
we'll remain patient

626
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:30,250
while you try to get Japan on board.

627
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,292
But if you don't,

628
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:36,042
we'll have to take
measures into our own hands.

629
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,417
I've gotta get out of here.

630
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,417
Sit down.

631
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,917
Sir, the sweep's not complete.

632
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,625
The longer I stay here,

633
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:49,875
the weaker I look.

634
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,208
The hell happened to you?

635
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:04,833
Sidewinder tracked me down.

636
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:07,157
Well, it looks like
he did a lot more than that.

637
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:09,833
He's in police custody now.

638
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:14,500
- Shit, you good?
- I will be.

639
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:16,375
Last call, trace it.

640
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:18,667
All right.

641
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,042
Yo, get this.

642
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:28,333
Ross' advisor, Ruth Bat-Seraph,

643
00:41:28,917 --> 00:41:31,542
she was born in Israel
and trained in the Red Room.

644
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:32,625
She's ex-Widow.

645
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:34,792
That basically means
stay the hell out of her way.

646
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:35,792
Trust me.

647
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:36,958
Yep.

648
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:45,042
Now, this is weird.

649
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:48,417
Isaiah had Ross in his crosshairs.

650
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:50,208
Couldn't miss.

651
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:51,250
I don't get it.

652
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:53,625
Why go through all that
trouble just to not kill Ross?

653
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:55,208
I don't know.

654
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,083
Shit.

655
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:59,375
I think I located
Sidewinder's last caller.

656
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:01,670
It's in the middle of nowhere,
West Virginia.

657
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,292
It's just, like, near some forest.

658
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:06,335
Database only shows one name.

659
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:08,000
Camp Echo One.

660
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:10,958
No satellite imagery.

661
00:42:11,792 --> 00:42:13,333
Away from air traffic.

662
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,625
No infrastructure in the area.

663
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:18,625
- Do you think it's military?
- Yep.

664
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:20,875
It's a place they send you
and you never leave.

665
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:30,833
Ross told me stay out of this.

666
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:33,583
He's just the President
of the United States.

667
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:49,792
You don't have to come with me.

668
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:53,125
Duh, I know.
That's what makes it so noble.

669
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:56,458
Pack as much gear as you can carry.

670
00:42:56,542 --> 00:42:58,167
I don't know when we'll be back.

671
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:01,750
What, you mean like,
"right now" right now?

672
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:02,958
Yeah.

673
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:05,083
Shit. Okay.

674
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,542
Well, it's a long-ass drive
to West Virginia,

675
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:08,917
so we're gonna need some snacks.

676
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,583
Why did I invite you?

677
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:12,042
What? Wait, wait, wait.

678
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:16,042
Wait up!

679
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:17,917
Ruth Bat-Seraph.

680
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,125
Isaiah Bradley's in holding cell 14.

681
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:22,083
- The other shooters are in 15.
- Okay.

682
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,292
Do you need an escort?

683
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,753
Think I'll be just fine.

684
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,125
- Thanks.
- Yes, ma'am.

685
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,628
I'd like to speak to them one at a time.

686
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,542
Can you... Excuse me?

687
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,917
Payumo. I'm talking to you. Hey.

688
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:44,792
Stop! Drop your weapon!

689
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,500
Payumo, what are you doing?

690
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:50,292
Drop it.

691
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:13,792
<i>Increase that cadence and resistance.</i>

692
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,355
<i>Or do whatever the hell</i>
<i>you need to do to get there, </i>all right?

693
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:19,792
<i>Just stay in your lane.
Stay in your lane. Here we go.</i>

694
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:21,375
<i>Out to third!</i>

695
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,375
<i>Eye on the prize. Eye on the target, baby.</i>

696
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:25,625
- That's enough.
<i>- Don't think about speed now.</i>

697
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:27,468
<i>Think about direction.
Think about intention.</i>

698
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:29,833
If Dr. Eccles asks,

699
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:34,875
you tell her I did the whole five miles.

700
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:40,333
That look.

701
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:42,875
We touch down in Tokyo at 0600.

702
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:47,208
You still think this is a bad idea?

703
00:44:47,292 --> 00:44:50,750
Sir, whoever orchestrated the attack
on the White House is still in the wild.

704
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:54,208
International travel brings security risks
we can't anticipate.

705
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:58,083
We barely got Congress
together on this thing.

706
00:44:58,792 --> 00:45:01,250
If we lose our international partners,

707
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,667
this treaty's toast.

708
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:06,833
I have to make this work.

709
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:09,750
Three miles and change.

710
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,458
I'll let Dr. Eccles know.

711
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:13,000
Five.

712
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:14,792
- Five.
- Five.

713
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:16,250
Do we have eyes on Wilson?

714
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:18,667
He left the base a few hours
ago with Joaquin Torres.

715
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,000
They ditched their smartphones.

716
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:21,458
They're off-grid.

717
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:24,708
Well, I don't want a variable out there
that I can't control.

718
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:27,167
Get a team, pick him up, bring him in.

719
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,625
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

720
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:30,878
<i>Breaking news out of Washington,</i>

721
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:32,750
<i>President Ross is on his way to Japan</i>

722
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,958
<i>just a day after surviving
an assassination attempt...</i>

723
00:45:35,042 --> 00:45:37,250
Bet you used to play this
old-ass game all the time.

724
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:38,337
Damn it. This is hard.

725
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:39,333
Right.

726
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:40,753
<i>The high-stakes
diplomatic visit...</i>

727
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:42,292
How far are we from Camp Echo One?

728
00:45:43,042 --> 00:45:45,667
<i>over control
of Celestial Island.</i>

729
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,917
We're about, like, an hour away.

730
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:56,250
Sam, shit. They just
shot up Isaiah's prison.

731
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,125
Is he okay?

732
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:00,250
Yeah, Isaiah's good, but the others,

733
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:01,417
they're dead.

734
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,625
Shit.

735
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:04,833
Should we go back?

736
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,167
No.

737
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,208
We keep going.

738
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:12,208
The buyer is pretty smart,
but we're not taking the bait.

739
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:15,333
Only way to help Isaiah is to
figure out who's behind this.

740
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:16,875
And whoever is behind it,

741
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,458
they do not want us getting closer.

742
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:26,208
Cooper.

743
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:27,625
What's happening?

744
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:30,458
Mr. President,
as a precautionary measure,

745
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:32,042
I have moved the prisoner to...

746
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,167
President Ross, I miss our little visits.

747
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:39,833
Tell me something.

748
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:43,875
<i>Do you ever stop to ask yourself
who's playing the music?</i>

749
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:45,167
It's you.

750
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:48,833
The White House,
the assassination attempt.

751
00:46:48,917 --> 00:46:50,833
That's a way of putting it.

752
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:53,958
<i>I helped you more than anyone else.</i>

753
00:46:54,042 --> 00:46:55,583
Only to get what you want.

754
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:56,667
<i>What do you want?</i>

755
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:00,375
<i>I wanted my life back,
but it's too late for that now.</i>

756
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:01,625
You've gotta...

757
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:03,708
You gotta understand my position.

758
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:05,583
- I...
<i>- I do.</i>

759
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:09,292
<i>You let me rot in this prison.</i>

760
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:11,750
<i>And it was my curse to watch your betrayal</i>

761
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,625
<i>written in probabilities.</i>

762
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:17,500
I'm making my own choices now.

763
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:20,000
<i>So many surprises left.</i>

764
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:24,125
When I'm done,
everyone will know just who you are,

765
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:27,208
<i>and Betty will despise you even more.</i>

766
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:29,417
<i>Goodbye, Mr. President.</i>

767
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:34,292
The hell is going on?

768
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:36,500
I'm putting you in solitary.

769
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:37,583
Yeah.

770
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,458
Nobody's gonna put me
in solitary ever again.

771
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:41,833
It's for your protection.

772
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:45,708
I'll tell you this one more
time for your protection,

773
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:48,417
I ain't goin' in a box ever again.

774
00:47:49,417 --> 00:47:51,750
I won't be able to guarantee your safety.

775
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:53,792
Safety ain't all it's cracked up to be.

776
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,583
You still think
I had somethin' to do with all of this?

777
00:47:58,583 --> 00:47:59,583
I don't know.

778
00:48:05,792 --> 00:48:06,625
Mr. President.

779
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:08,503
<i>I need you
to drop whatever you're doin'.</i>

780
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:10,167
<i>Camp Echo One's been compromised.</i>

781
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:12,000
Yes, Mr. President.

782
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:40,875
This is it.

783
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:42,833
Camp Echo One.

784
00:48:45,042 --> 00:48:47,375
Telescopes must be a facade.

785
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:48,958
We gotta see what's underneath.

786
00:48:52,917 --> 00:48:54,875
We've got cameras and guards.

787
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:57,250
Redwing, cut the fence
and go loop the feed.

788
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:05,875
Yeah, we got a 28-second
window to get past the guards.

789
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:07,625
We gotta do the door manually.

790
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:11,792
Three, two, one,

791
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:13,333
go.

792
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:27,917
15 seconds.

793
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,680
I'm trying, man!

794
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,542
Shit!

795
00:50:19,292 --> 00:50:20,852
There's no prisoners in here.

796
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:11,708
Why is there a lab in this prison?

797
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,292
What the hell is this place?

798
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:35,500
What the hell?

799
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:43,542
<i>Ozaki-san,</i>

800
00:52:43,625 --> 00:52:45,083
I want to assure you

801
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:48,292
America remains committed
to sharing our adamantium

802
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:50,208
with the rest of the world.

803
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,583
I trust Japan shares that commitment.

804
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:56,083
The world needs this treaty.

805
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,417
Diplomacy must be hard for you.

806
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:03,792
A man in a country

807
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:06,292
so used to taking
whatever he wants by force.

808
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,417
Excuse me?

809
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,917
How else to explain your theft
of our adamantium,

810
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,042
only to return it to us in Washington.

811
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:17,583
What you're accusing us of is baseless

812
00:53:17,667 --> 00:53:19,750
and insulting.

813
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:23,458
So, the information
my intelligence team received

814
00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:24,958
and verified

815
00:53:25,042 --> 00:53:26,708
is incorrect?

816
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,083
Wh...

817
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:40,167
I'm a fool.

818
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:45,833
I'm a fool to negotiate
with someone so naive

819
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:48,292
they don't realize they're being played.

820
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:50,208
Naive?

821
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:53,333
If I'd stolen the sample,

822
00:53:53,917 --> 00:53:57,750
why would I order
Captain America to retrieve it?

823
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:00,542
I suppose we'll never know the truth.

824
00:54:06,667 --> 00:54:09,667
Whatever game you're playing,
Japan wants no part in it.

825
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:12,208
Don't test us, Mr. President.

826
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:21,750
He's got optogenetic data
on a lot of people.

827
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:24,417
Don't make me look up words, Joaquin.

828
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,212
I think he's figured out a way
to plant commands

829
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:29,000
into people's subconscious
using flashes of light.

830
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:32,125
This "Mr. Blue" song seems
to be some kind of trigger.

831
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:33,292
Mind control.

832
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:35,042
Yeah.

833
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:36,708
That explains Isaiah.

834
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:44,750
And that's more important.

835
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:46,333
Take risks.

836
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:49,292
Use those incredible brains of yours.

837
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:51,417
Wasn't half bad-looking, was I?

838
00:54:57,875 --> 00:54:59,292
Samuel Sterns.

839
00:55:02,458 --> 00:55:05,083
You know, It takes
an awful lot to surprise me.

840
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:10,583
There was an 89% chance you'd turn around

841
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:12,917
if I put Isaiah Bradley at risk,

842
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,708
yet here you stand.

843
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,333
You're the buyer.

844
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:19,417
Indeed.

845
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,042
Hiring SERPENT was a necessary step

846
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:25,208
to create a chain
of statistical certainties.

847
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:27,132
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

848
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:30,125
I am, actually.

849
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:33,083
My mind sees it all,
every probable outcome.

850
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:36,792
So you hire SERPENT
to steal the adamantium,

851
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,208
shoot up Ross' summit announcing it

852
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:41,375
and now you're just sitting here, waiting.

853
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:44,042
Why do you wanna kill Ross?

854
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:48,000
Why does everyone think that
I wanna kill Ross?

855
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,292
Is it because he imprisoned me
here without a trial

856
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:55,292
after an infusion of gamma
warped the structure

857
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:56,375
of my brain?

858
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,250
Damn.

859
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:05,083
Once Ross discovered
how useful I could be,

860
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:08,208
he kept me here for 16 years,

861
00:56:08,292 --> 00:56:11,042
turning my mind to solving his problems.

862
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,917
My solutions brought him the
highest office in the country.

863
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:19,875
If I wanted Ross dead, he'd be dead.

864
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:21,958
Well, whatever you're doing,

865
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,375
you're hurting a lot of people,
including my friend.

866
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:28,208
So this is the last chance
I'm gonna give you to stop it.

867
00:56:28,292 --> 00:56:30,125
Why are you protecting him?

868
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:33,292
Ross knows I'm responsible
for the White House,

869
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:36,250
yet he's still letting Isaiah
sit in prison for it.

870
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:37,667
You know he'll never change.

871
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:39,500
Let me finish my work.

872
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:41,042
I'm afraid I can't do that.

873
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:49,292
Please don't be boring!

874
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:58,417
You think they'll stop us?

875
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,875
For long enough.

876
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,583
You're a fascinating problem.

877
00:57:02,542 --> 00:57:04,917
But soon you'll be off the board,

878
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,917
so you don't surprise me again.

879
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,375
This is messed up, man.
It's not even their choice.

880
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:12,167
I know. Just try and neutralize.

881
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:20,833
Punk-ass.

882
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:38,292
Stand down!

883
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:41,833
I'm taking them in.

884
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:43,833
I'll deal with these two.

885
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:47,667
Okay.

886
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:14,208
What the hell are you guys doing here?

887
00:59:14,292 --> 00:59:16,250
Well, that's what I should be asking you.

888
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:17,750
Where's Sterns?

889
00:59:19,417 --> 00:59:21,708
If Sterns is in the wind,
we need to set a perimeter,

890
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:23,208
roadblocks, air support.

891
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:24,667
He can't have gone far.

892
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:25,958
Why are you helping us?

893
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:28,750
'Cause you were right.
I thought that was obvious.

894
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:30,753
- Freeze!
- It's okay.

895
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,042
We have orders to take
Captain America into custody.

896
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:34,878
You already have one
Captain America in custody.

897
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:36,125
You want another?

898
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:39,375
You're under arrest for trespassing
on restricted government property.

899
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:42,170
Being right always go like this?

900
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,458
Most of the time.

901
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:48,292
I have the clearances.
It's been a long day.

902
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:50,833
She's ex-Widow. Just zap the guy.

903
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:53,125
These orders come
from the President himself.

904
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:54,542
Get them out of here.

905
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:55,917
Then we'll just call him.

906
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,917
Ruth, uncuff us now!

907
01:00:02,292 --> 01:00:03,712
Shit, shit, shit, shit. Not again.

908
01:00:03,792 --> 01:00:05,750
- Run!
- Go, go, go. Come on.

909
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:14,750
Go!

910
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:23,042
Mr. President,
Japan's claim seems to be true.

911
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:25,875
We're trying to determine
the point of the breach.

912
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,833
Sir, we have to tell
Ozaki's team something.

913
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:30,167
We've got to stop the bleeding.

914
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:31,667
I need some time alone.

915
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,083
We don't have much time, sir.

916
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:36,083
Ozaki just decided to advance
his navy on Celestial Island.

917
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:38,670
He intends to secure
the adamantium for himself.

918
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:39,750
Jesus.

919
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:41,795
France and India are drawing
up occupation strategies...

920
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:44,045
Mr. President, I suggest that
we return to DC immediately.

921
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:45,253
- No, I disagree.
- Immediately.

922
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:46,795
We are going to lose
our opportunity with Ozaki.

923
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:48,628
We need to regroup and figure
out a different solution.

924
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:50,375
We can't do that. No, absolutely not!

925
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:51,503
We need to ask for another meeting, sir.

926
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:54,583
If we call on Ozaki now,
and try to reach out to him, we can...

927
01:00:54,667 --> 01:00:56,208
We're not gonna miss the argument.

928
01:00:56,292 --> 01:00:57,958
We have to have another meeting!

929
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:16,417
I want Carrier Strike Group Five
deployed immediately.

930
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,000
Tell 'em I'm on my way there now.

931
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:20,708
Sir, are we seriously
talking about taking control

932
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:21,833
of Japan's adamantium?

933
01:01:21,917 --> 01:01:24,625
I'm not going home empty-handed.

934
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:28,167
If only one country is going
to control adamantium,

935
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,917
it's going to be us.

936
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:36,667
Make the call!

937
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:40,667
Taylor!

938
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,837
The President has informed me

939
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:44,792
that we need to move Strike Group Five
to Celestial Island immediately.

940
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:48,833
I want to be en route to the
Indian Ocean within the hour.

941
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:52,458
Mr. President,
this is extremely dangerous.

942
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:54,542
If a war breaks out...

943
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:56,208
I was a wartime general.

944
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:59,333
Now I'm a wartime president.

945
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:03,917
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

946
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:29,333
What are we doing here?

947
01:02:29,417 --> 01:02:31,792
You say Ross' orders was
to take us into custody

948
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:33,583
so I called in a favor.

949
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:35,583
Thanks for doing this.

950
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:38,333
No problem, Cap.
Brass never makes it down here.

951
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:40,000
Terminal's set up, ready to go.

952
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:43,000
You sure you can knock out
Sterns' mind control?

953
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:45,667
I should be able to run a program
that blocks the light signals

954
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:48,292
that Sterns has been
sending out to control people.

955
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:50,417
What if he's already gotten someone?

956
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:52,583
That's a good point.

957
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Are you crazy?

958
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:06,583
We're clear here, at least.

959
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:08,208
You have anybody that you trust

960
01:03:08,292 --> 01:03:10,337
that can take a look at these
and tell me what's in 'em?

961
01:03:10,417 --> 01:03:11,833
Sure, I got someone.

962
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:13,000
I'll get on it.

963
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:15,083
- Thanks. Our guy here?
- Through there.

964
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,125
Listen in.

965
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:23,667
I'm amazed you're still standing.

966
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:26,792
Most men don't survive an axe to the gut.

967
01:03:26,875 --> 01:03:28,375
Kevlar weave, I presume?

968
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:29,625
Perks of the job.

969
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:33,250
You said you were gonna find
the man who wasted your time.

970
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:35,042
I wanna know what you learned.

971
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:36,333
Samuel Sterns.

972
01:03:36,417 --> 01:03:38,375
Gruesome fella, don't you think?

973
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:40,000
I've seen worse.

974
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,333
Not without your Avengers.

975
01:03:43,458 --> 01:03:44,958
Full immunity and I'll talk.

976
01:03:45,042 --> 01:03:46,250
You're crazy.

977
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:47,333
Who you kiddin'?

978
01:03:47,417 --> 01:03:49,045
You're here because
you're all out of options.

979
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,833
You heard what he did to those shooters.

980
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:53,708
A guy like Sterns doesn't like
loose ends alive.

981
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:58,750
Reduced sentence, Allenwood, my own cell.

982
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:01,167
Lemme hear what you got first.

983
01:04:03,917 --> 01:04:06,750
You know, it was my old unit
that found Sterns

984
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:07,875
in the wreckage of Harlem.

985
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:11,125
They said he'd been infected
with Bruce Banner's blood,

986
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:12,875
but it didn't give him strength.

987
01:04:12,958 --> 01:04:13,875
What did it give him?

988
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:17,042
A mind capable of impossible calculations.

989
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:19,708
Ross being Ross,

990
01:04:19,792 --> 01:04:21,083
he saw an opportunity.

991
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:24,583
Instead of removing the gamma
from Sterns' blood,

992
01:04:24,667 --> 01:04:26,833
he upped the dose.

993
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:30,583
Made Sterns his own personal think tank,

994
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:34,250
creating technology
and weapons for the state.

995
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:36,625
Holy shit.

996
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:38,792
Why did Sterns go along with it?

997
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,458
Camp Echo One was the stick.

998
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:44,250
I imagine a pardon was the carrot.

999
01:04:46,417 --> 01:04:50,458
Ross told Sterns he'd let him
go once he became president.

1000
01:04:50,542 --> 01:04:52,958
And yet, here we are.

1001
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:58,708
So Sterns hired you
to steal Japan's adamantium

1002
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:00,833
knowing it would divide the two countries.

1003
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:05,958
He paid us through a CIA black fund.

1004
01:05:06,042 --> 01:05:08,667
That could kill the treaty
and start a war.

1005
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:11,458
And Ross would be blamed for the chaos.

1006
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:14,375
How do you think a man
with Ross' temperament

1007
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:17,500
will deal with being caught in a trap?

1008
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,333
If you break out of Allenwood,
I'll find you.

1009
01:05:22,417 --> 01:05:25,292
When I break out, Captain,

1010
01:05:25,792 --> 01:05:27,625
you won't walk away alive.

1011
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,958
- Did you know?
- Of course not.

1012
01:05:31,042 --> 01:05:33,125
But Ross is not that man anymore.

1013
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:35,458
None of us have to be defined by our past.

1014
01:05:35,542 --> 01:05:38,208
Cap, my guy needs 24 hours on the pills.

1015
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:41,458
Okay. We need to get to DC
and tell Ross what Sterns is planning.

1016
01:05:41,542 --> 01:05:42,875
President Ross isn't in DC.

1017
01:05:43,417 --> 01:05:44,917
He's on the USS Milius.

1018
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,750
They just moved into the Indian Ocean.

1019
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:48,792
Japan's warships are also in proximity.

1020
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:51,167
Shit. Suit up. We need to move.

1021
01:05:57,542 --> 01:05:58,583
May I help you?

1022
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:00,292
Hello, Admiral.

1023
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:02,125
May I use your phone?

1024
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,042
Hey, honey.
Who's at the door?

1025
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:10,750
Holy shit.

1026
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,292
You ever see anything like this?

1027
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:13,583
No, I haven't.

1028
01:06:40,292 --> 01:06:42,170
Let me do the talking
or he'll never listen.

1029
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:44,417
I haven't seen Ross like this
since the army.

1030
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,583
He better snap out of it.

1031
01:06:45,667 --> 01:06:48,583
Because whatever Sterns is
planning, it's happening soon.

1032
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:52,792
I want a fleet of F-18s
ready to catapult.

1033
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,000
If they turn that ship around, I want...

1034
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:58,000
What's he doing here?

1035
01:06:58,083 --> 01:07:00,000
I told you not to get involved, Wilson.

1036
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:01,292
I brought him, sir.

1037
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:02,378
I want him outta here!

1038
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:04,583
Sir, you asked me
to run this investigation,

1039
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:07,583
- and the situation is...
- Don't bother with excuses.

1040
01:07:07,667 --> 01:07:10,042
You had a simple job and you failed.

1041
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:11,125
Mr. President,

1042
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:14,625
we've uncovered intel at Camp Echo One

1043
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:17,250
that could put millions of lives at risk.

1044
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,375
Now, you and I both know
Isaiah's innocent.

1045
01:07:20,667 --> 01:07:23,167
I'm happy to have
this conversation in public,

1046
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,250
if you like.

1047
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:34,167
This is crazy.
Japan's supposed to be our...

1048
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,417
Jackal?

1049
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,708
Jackal, do you copy?

1050
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:44,833
Make it quick, Wilson.

1051
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:48,542
I've got Japan's fleet on my ass

1052
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:50,542
trying to make it to
that island before we do.

1053
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:52,000
That's exactly what he wants.

1054
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:55,000
Sterns has been pulling
the strings on everything.

1055
01:07:55,083 --> 01:07:56,917
SERPENT's theft of the adamantium,

1056
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,500
the attack on the White House.

1057
01:07:58,583 --> 01:08:00,250
The CIA leak to Japan.

1058
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:03,333
He's pitting you and Japan
against each other

1059
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:05,333
to ensure that this moment happens.

1060
01:08:05,417 --> 01:08:07,542
How the hell did he do
all that from prison?

1061
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,667
Mind control. He created a technology

1062
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:13,792
that allowed him to control the minds
of anyone he targeted.

1063
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:15,792
Including maybe you, sir.

1064
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:23,750
Have you been feelin'
like yourself lately?

1065
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:31,708
Of course I have.

1066
01:08:31,792 --> 01:08:33,750
But he has your data, sir. Why?

1067
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:34,833
I don't know.

1068
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:39,167
If he can control minds,
surely he can hack files.

1069
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:42,292
The logs show that you visited
Camp Echo One numerous times.

1070
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:46,833
To ensure a high-value
prisoner was secure.

1071
01:08:46,917 --> 01:08:50,125
Yeah, but the scans, the EKG,
the blood work was all taken there, sir.

1072
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:51,250
This is ridiculous.

1073
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:53,000
Mr. President, answer the question.

1074
01:08:53,083 --> 01:08:55,167
I don't have to answer you!

1075
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,375
Why visit a Black Site,

1076
01:08:56,458 --> 01:08:58,212
- in the middle of nowhere...
- Wilson, stop!

1077
01:08:58,292 --> 01:08:59,500
I order you to stop!

1078
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:01,128
- To conduct these tests?
- I order you to stop!

1079
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:03,458
- Why?
- Because I was dying,

1080
01:09:03,542 --> 01:09:04,708
goddamn it!

1081
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:11,958
Because my heart was failing!

1082
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:16,083
No one could figure it out until he did.

1083
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:24,125
These things have kept me alive.

1084
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:28,125
And in return, I gave him hope

1085
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:30,083
that he might get his life back.

1086
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:34,542
He got a lab to do the work.

1087
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:37,417
I even tried to get him moved but...

1088
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,208
But you couldn't risk losing the pills.

1089
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:47,875
After your friend the Hulk
and the Abomination

1090
01:09:47,958 --> 01:09:51,792
destroyed Harlem,
someone had to take the fall.

1091
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:53,625
Sterns was just...

1092
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:56,333
collateral damage.

1093
01:09:59,917 --> 01:10:02,333
I have dedicated my entire life

1094
01:10:03,292 --> 01:10:05,125
to serving this country.

1095
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:11,083
The one person that matters...

1096
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,833
doesn't seem to understand.

1097
01:10:15,917 --> 01:10:22,333
Betty never forgave me for
sending the army after Banner.

1098
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:27,042
I had to survive...

1099
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:36,833
so that my daughter knew
that there was more to her father.

1100
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:39,917
That I'm the same man
that used to take her

1101
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,667
to see the cherry blossoms.

1102
01:10:43,542 --> 01:10:45,417
She still can, sir.

1103
01:10:47,917 --> 01:10:49,458
I know what it's like...

1104
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:54,000
to feel you have somethin' to prove.

1105
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:57,583
Everyone only seeing one thing.

1106
01:10:59,417 --> 01:11:01,583
But when showing there's more to you,

1107
01:11:02,417 --> 01:11:04,625
it's not about when times are easy.

1108
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:07,958
It's about moments like this.

1109
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:13,083
Now, we're here
because Sterns wants revenge

1110
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:15,500
and doesn't care if he incites a war.

1111
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:17,833
We're playing right into his hand.

1112
01:11:18,417 --> 01:11:22,750
Mr. President, two of our F-18s
just fired on the Japanese fleet.

1113
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:27,667
Keep hailing those pilots.

1114
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,042
Damage to Japanese fleet minimal.

1115
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:33,295
Ready air defense systems.

1116
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,375
What the hell
are those pilots doing?

1117
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,545
- Call them back in.
- We tried, sir.

1118
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:39,083
Jackal and Whiskey won't respond.

1119
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:41,125
We gotta get our birds in the air.

1120
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:43,208
You have two ready to fly now, sir.

1121
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:45,958
Go.

1122
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:03,708
Sterns got to our pilots
before I shut down the system.

1123
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,900
We need to get
the Japanese out of the air.

1124
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:09,250
Stay close and don't get yourself killed.

1125
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:10,917
No dying, copy that.

1126
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:18,792
Return to your fleet.

1127
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:20,515
Yamamoto, we've got company.

1128
01:12:23,417 --> 01:12:24,420
There's been a mistake.

1129
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,500
We're not your enemy.

1130
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:39,150
Jackal's headed
towards the Japanese fleet.

1131
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,000
Shit! He just fired on them.

1132
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:45,125
Mr. President,
do not send more fighters up.

1133
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:47,583
We need Japan to see
we're trying to deescalate.

1134
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:53,350
Command, permission
to return fire on the Americans?

1135
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:54,738
Permission granted.

1136
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:04,733
Sir,
we have six Japanese missiles inbound.

1137
01:13:07,542 --> 01:13:08,833
Launch intercept missiles.

1138
01:13:21,292 --> 01:13:23,417
Damn, two got through.

1139
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,220
Take the one on the right.

1140
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:33,500
Redwing, a little help.

1141
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:55,208
Sir, you need to convince
Japan to ground their planes.

1142
01:13:59,292 --> 01:14:02,000
<i>This is what we expected
from a Ross presidency.</i>

1143
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:05,792
Mr. Prime Minister,
two of our pilots have gone rogue.

1144
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:08,083
Call off your planes.
We're being manipulated.

1145
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:09,167
<i>Certainly.</i>

1146
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:10,417
By you.

1147
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,875
<i>Hiding your assassins
behind Captain America.</i>

1148
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:17,542
He's trying to bring them down now, sir.

1149
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:20,625
If those pilots are not
taking orders from you,

1150
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:24,000
then who gives them their commands?

1151
01:14:25,792 --> 01:14:26,875
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

1152
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:32,823
Mr. President?

1153
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:39,833
<i>Now we're getting somewhere.</i>

1154
01:14:39,917 --> 01:14:43,500
<i>That fire in the belly. The rage.</i>

1155
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:46,125
<i>Why don't you just let it out?</i>

1156
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:47,458
Are you all right, sir?

1157
01:14:49,292 --> 01:14:51,667
I just need a moment.

1158
01:14:57,708 --> 01:14:59,417
Joaquin, Whiskey's coming at you.

1159
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,917
Copy that.

1160
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,292
Sam, once we're done,
you gotta teach me your moves!

1161
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:20,167
<i>Altitude. Altitude.</i>

1162
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:24,958
<i>Altitude.</i>

1163
01:15:27,292 --> 01:15:28,917
Whiskey's away. Send rescue.

1164
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,420
Roger, sending rescue.

1165
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,420
You have two Japanese fighters
coming up on your tail.

1166
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,378
Why the hell
are they still chasing us?

1167
01:15:34,458 --> 01:15:35,462
We're trying to help them.

1168
01:15:35,542 --> 01:15:36,962
Because Ross won't tell them

1169
01:15:37,042 --> 01:15:38,167
who's really behind this.

1170
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:44,125
All that hatred you try to hide,

1171
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:48,500
all the ugliness, it's still there, Ross,

1172
01:15:49,042 --> 01:15:51,792
<i>smoldering behind the eyes.</i>

1173
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:10,585
Joaquin, I'm goin' after Jackal.

1174
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:14,417
Roger that.
I'll keep these guys busy.

1175
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:21,625
What have you done to me, you bastard?

1176
01:16:21,708 --> 01:16:25,125
<i>What we agreed on.
Maybe a hair more.</i>

1177
01:16:25,625 --> 01:16:26,750
You poisoned me!

1178
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:28,917
Stop taking the pills then.

1179
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,208
But we both know you won't.

1180
01:16:31,292 --> 01:16:35,250
<i>Give me what I want. Stop fighting it.</i>

1181
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:36,625
No!

1182
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:09,542
Sam, Jackal
just fired his last missiles!

1183
01:17:14,792 --> 01:17:16,625
I got one. Going after the another.

1184
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:18,875
- Back off! I'll get it!
- No, no! I got it.

1185
01:17:18,958 --> 01:17:20,208
- Back off!
- I got it.

1186
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:24,875
Joaquin!

1187
01:17:32,792 --> 01:17:34,417
Joaquin's down! I'm goin' after him.

1188
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,458
We'll send search and rescue.
You have to stop Jackal.

1189
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:38,625
Damn it!

1190
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:40,958
I'm putting an end to this now.

1191
01:17:41,042 --> 01:17:42,917
<i>Give in to your rage.</i>

1192
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:46,875
I'm taking your legacy as we speak.

1193
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:49,375
Come on, Ross. You're almost there.

1194
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:54,042
You can rip their fleet apart
with your bare hands,

1195
01:17:54,125 --> 01:17:56,208
<i>and kill Captain America.</i>

1196
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:02,833
Shit.

1197
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:11,875
<i>Let the monster inside you out.</i>

1198
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:22,458
<i>Altitude, altitude, altitude.</i>

1199
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,667
<i>Altitude, altitude, altitude.</i>

1200
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:28,250
<i>Unleash your anger.</i>

1201
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:30,042
<i>Unleash your hatred.</i>

1202
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:31,605
Redwing, stabilize!

1203
01:18:36,958 --> 01:18:39,292
<i>Nothing can stop you, Ross.</i>

1204
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:41,042
<i>You can crush them all.</i>

1205
01:18:56,167 --> 01:18:57,333
Mr. President?

1206
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:01,292
Sir. Are you okay?

1207
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,833
Captain America neutralized
the rogue pilots.

1208
01:19:03,917 --> 01:19:05,917
Japan's recalling their planes.

1209
01:19:07,792 --> 01:19:09,542
Get Ozaki back on the line.

1210
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:11,167
<i>We can fix this.</i>

1211
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,410
Command, Captain
America saved our fleet.

1212
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,250
American pilots neutralized.

1213
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:30,292
Where's Joaquin?

1214
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:32,000
Med-evac just got to him.

1215
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:33,375
Thank God.

1216
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:43,625
<i>A crisis was narrowly avoided</i>

1217
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:47,542
when a brief dogfight broke out
between Japanese and US military forces

1218
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:49,458
over Celestial Island.

1219
01:19:49,542 --> 01:19:53,500
US Air Force Captain Joaquin Torres
was shot down during the skirmish,

1220
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:54,792
<i>and is now in surgery at</i>

1221
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:57,458
<i>Walter Reed National Military
Medical Center.</i>

1222
01:19:57,542 --> 01:19:59,542
<i>His condition is critical.</i>

1223
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:02,465
- Give me that clamp.
- Gonna need to pack this!

1224
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:05,000
- The pressure's stable.
- Suction!

1225
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:08,292
I can't see anything. More suction.

1226
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:10,167
Retractors.

1227
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:16,583
It's a private room.

1228
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:19,958
Go away.

1229
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:27,167
I missed you, too.

1230
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,625
I hate to admit it, I'm glad you're here.

1231
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:48,000
You looked good out there
on that six o'clock.

1232
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:50,250
But then I saw this.

1233
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,667
The doctors had to restart his heart.

1234
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,000
They don't know if...

1235
01:21:00,167 --> 01:21:01,417
This isn't your fault.

1236
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:04,500
It makes me think of Steve.

1237
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:08,917
How many alien invasions
did he stop again?

1238
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,208
Two.

1239
01:21:10,292 --> 01:21:11,292
Two.

1240
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:14,167
Wow.

1241
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,875
What made me think I could follow that?

1242
01:21:21,917 --> 01:21:26,125
I should've took the serum.
Like Steve, like you.

1243
01:21:27,792 --> 01:21:28,792
Why?

1244
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:35,375
Because this is all startin'
to seem much bigger than me.

1245
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:42,167
Ross, he asked me
to restart the Avengers, Buck.

1246
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:44,000
But Joaquin's in here,

1247
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:47,042
Isaiah's in prison, and Sterns...

1248
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:52,250
I had him. I had Sterns right in my hands.

1249
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:54,583
And he got away.

1250
01:21:55,167 --> 01:21:57,542
He damn near pushed us
to the brink of war,

1251
01:21:57,625 --> 01:21:59,000
because I wasn't...

1252
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:02,958
Say what you need to say.

1253
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:10,542
Steve made a mistake.

1254
01:22:11,875 --> 01:22:13,208
No, he didn't.

1255
01:22:13,292 --> 01:22:15,125
He gave you that shield

1256
01:22:15,875 --> 01:22:18,000
not because you're the strongest,

1257
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:19,375
but because you're you.

1258
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:25,542
You think if you had that serum

1259
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:28,000
you'd be able to protect
all the people you care about.

1260
01:22:28,583 --> 01:22:30,958
Steve had it, and he couldn't.

1261
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,542
You're a human being,
and you're doing your best.

1262
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:37,625
Steve gave people something to believe in.

1263
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:38,708
But you...

1264
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:42,000
you give 'em something to aspire to.

1265
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:47,792
Did your speechwriters help you with that?

1266
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:49,420
They did, yeah. The ending, a little bit.

1267
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,417
Well, did you like it?

1268
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,625
No, no, it was good. Solid B-plus.

1269
01:22:52,708 --> 01:22:54,958
- Emotional.
- Yeah, very. I felt it.

1270
01:22:55,042 --> 01:22:56,167
But just enough.

1271
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:57,250
Yeah.

1272
01:22:58,667 --> 01:23:00,792
Listen, I gotta catch a plane.

1273
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:03,458
I have a campaign fundraiser.
It's so stupid.

1274
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:09,958
It's gonna be all right, man.

1275
01:23:16,167 --> 01:23:17,292
Thanks, Buck.

1276
01:23:18,542 --> 01:23:20,167
I love you, buddy.

1277
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:31,250
- Was that...
- Yep.

1278
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:35,208
Future Congressman James Buchanan Barnes.

1279
01:23:39,375 --> 01:23:42,250
He's taller in real life, nice smile too,

1280
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:44,875
good amount of teeth, great posture.

1281
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:46,750
He's 110 years old.

1282
01:23:47,417 --> 01:23:48,292
I can work with that.

1283
01:23:48,375 --> 01:23:51,792
<i>While the investigation
into the White House assassination attempt</i>

1284
01:23:51,875 --> 01:23:53,250
<i>and the shocking shooting at</i>

1286

<i>Isaiah Bradley is set to go

1287
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:00,792
I need some air.

1288
01:24:00,875 --> 01:24:03,292
<i>It's a stunning fall from grace for a man</i>

1289
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:06,167
<i>brought out from the shadows

1290

<i>Just two years after being exonerated

1291
01:24:09,917 --> 01:24:13,125
<i>Bradley now finds himself

1292
01:24:13,208 --> 01:24:16,375
<i>and facing a possible death sentence.</i>

1293
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:30,417
Okay, reset. Let's go again.

1294
01:24:32,542 --> 01:24:33,583
Talk to me.

1295
01:24:33,667 --> 01:24:35,337
<i>Dunphy, you check out my report?</i>

1296
01:24:35,417 --> 01:24:36,503
All right, what am I looking at?

1297
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:39,542
<i>Those pills you gave me,
they're loaded with gamma radiation,</i>

1298
01:24:39,625 --> 01:24:41,708
<i>engineered to be absorbed into the blood.</i>

1299
01:24:41,792 --> 01:24:43,292
<i>Where the hell did you get these?</i>

1300
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:45,083
Shit. I gotta make a call.

1301
01:24:52,792 --> 01:24:56,833
This sound is currently
affecting your equilibrium.

1302
01:24:57,458 --> 01:24:59,083
When I turn this dial,

1303
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:01,750
it will disrupt your heartbeat.

1304
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:05,083
I take no pleasure in your death,

1305
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:07,833
but I can't have you calling the Captain.

1306
01:25:07,917 --> 01:25:10,625
Who are you?

1307
01:25:11,667 --> 01:25:13,417
Isn't it obvious?

1308
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:15,833
I'm the hero.

1309
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:39,333
Sir.

1310
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:42,708
Agent Taylor.

1311
01:25:43,292 --> 01:25:45,545
Just wanted to let you know
that every guest has been screened,

1312
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:47,583
and we also did three sweeps
of the Rose Garden.

1313
01:25:48,167 --> 01:25:49,167
Thank you.

1314
01:25:50,083 --> 01:25:51,750
- See you out there.
- Yes, sir.

1315
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,250
<i>Hello?</i>

1316
01:26:13,958 --> 01:26:16,458
Hello. Hi.

1317
01:26:17,792 --> 01:26:19,458
I... how are you?

1318
01:26:21,667 --> 01:26:25,375
<i>I'm sorry, I should have called
after the attack at the White House.</i>

1319
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:26,792
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1320
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,667
I'm fine.

1321
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:32,333
It's really good to hear your voice.

1322
01:26:34,417 --> 01:26:36,000
I didn't think you'd answer.

1323
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:41,792
Betty, I... I know I've made
a lot of mistakes.

1324
01:26:43,458 --> 01:26:48,583
But I'm trying to change,
to be a better person.

1325
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Um...

1326
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:56,542
Maybe we could take a... a walk sometime?

1327
01:26:57,375 --> 01:27:02,458
See the cherry blossoms,
like the old days.

1328
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,750
<i>Yeah. That could be nice.</i>

1329
01:27:11,958 --> 01:27:15,083
Okay. I love you.

1330
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,125
<i>Bye, Dad.</i>

1331
01:27:37,625 --> 01:27:38,708
Please.

1332
01:27:39,792 --> 01:27:41,208
Good afternoon, everyone.

1333
01:27:44,583 --> 01:27:46,042
When I took office,

1334
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:51,333
I promised we would create
a true, lasting peace.

1335
01:27:52,458 --> 01:27:56,625
Today, we begin to realize that promise.

1336
01:27:58,167 --> 01:27:59,708
Captain America...

1337
01:28:02,667 --> 01:28:03,958
would you do me the kindness

1338
01:28:04,042 --> 01:28:08,292
of counseling a bitter man
at the end of his rope?

1339
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:10,083
That's what you do, isn't it?

1340
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:14,667
Guess we have five minutes
until the MPs drag your ass outta here.

1341
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:18,167
You ruined my grand finale
on the Indian Ocean.

1342
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:21,333
So now I'm forced to turn myself in
to get what I want.

1343
01:28:21,417 --> 01:28:23,667
Well, if you're waitin' for an apology,

1344
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:25,000
we'll be here awhile.

1345
01:28:25,083 --> 01:28:26,875
I'm waiting for you to realize

1346
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:28,958
that we both want the same thing,

1347
01:28:29,458 --> 01:28:31,792
for the world to see Ross as he truly is.

1348
01:28:32,417 --> 01:28:37,000
I'm proud to say our treaty
will finally be signed.

1349
01:28:37,542 --> 01:28:39,167
I'll take a couple questions.

1350
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:42,958
Sir, what do you say to reports
that relations with Japan broke down

1351
01:28:43,042 --> 01:28:45,750
over your handling
of the White House assassination attempt?

1352
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:48,625
Despite fabrications that some have used

1353
01:28:48,708 --> 01:28:50,458
to turn us against each other,

1354
01:28:50,542 --> 01:28:53,583
our bonds have proved strong.

1355
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:56,000
You kept Ross alive for years.

1356
01:28:56,833 --> 01:28:59,542
Didn't kill him when you had
the chance at the White House.

1357
01:29:00,792 --> 01:29:02,292
The way I see it,

1358
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:06,583
the Indian Ocean
wasn't about starting a war.

1359
01:29:07,958 --> 01:29:09,750
You wanted to destroy his legacy.

1360
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:12,000
Yes.

1361
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,292
But you haven't figured out how.

1362
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:16,917
The pills.

1363
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,375
I got somebody on that, too.

1364
01:29:19,167 --> 01:29:20,625
Not anymore, you don't.

1365
01:29:21,542 --> 01:29:23,583
Is it true hostilities in the Indian Ocean

1366
01:29:23,667 --> 01:29:25,583
occurred because the Japanese discovered

1367
01:29:25,667 --> 01:29:27,208
it was, in fact, your government

1368
01:29:27,292 --> 01:29:30,750
who paid for the SERPENT mercenary group
to steal their adamantium?

1369
01:29:31,792 --> 01:29:33,375
We did not pay them.

1370
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:35,333
Ross turned me into a monster.

1371
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:38,625
It's only right that I do
the same thing to him.

1372
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:40,917
Why aren't you smiling?

1373
01:29:41,417 --> 01:29:43,250
- On the ground!
- Hold it!

1374
01:29:48,625 --> 01:29:50,250
You ever use that big brain of yours

1375
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:53,292
to consider that maybe
you're wrong about Ross?

1376
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:54,875
Wanna bet?

1377
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:55,958
Yeah.

1378
01:29:57,375 --> 01:29:59,333
- Where are you going?
- To stop this.

1379
01:30:00,333 --> 01:30:01,875
Get on the ground, now.

1380
01:30:03,458 --> 01:30:04,712
You have the right to remain silent...

1381
01:30:04,792 --> 01:30:05,958
Captain America!

1382
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:10,458
If I'm right about Ross,
you're going to die.

1383
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:12,500
You're going to die!

1384
01:30:13,542 --> 01:30:17,792
Mr. President, Dr. Samuel Sterns
just turned himself in.

1385
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:20,375
He claims you promised him a pardon

1386
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:23,167
if he worked on secret
government projects for you.

1387
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:24,295
That is a lie.

1388
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:27,958
<i>President Ross,
I miss our little visits.</i>

1389
01:30:28,042 --> 01:30:29,667
<i>What do you want?</i>

1390
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:32,542
<i>I wanted my life back,
but it's too late for that now.</i>

1391
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:33,667
Sir...

1392
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:35,003
<i>I helped you more than anyone.</i>

1393
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:36,458
Well, let me explain.

1394
01:30:36,542 --> 01:30:37,708
They have to know.

1395
01:30:37,792 --> 01:30:39,542
<i>You gotta understand my position.</i>

1396
01:30:39,625 --> 01:30:43,167
<i>I do.
You let me rot in this prison.</i>

1397
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:44,667
Leave me alone!

1398
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,542
- Leave me! Let me go!
- Sir! Sir!

1399
01:30:46,625 --> 01:30:47,958
I cannot let you.

1400
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:50,042
- You can't let me? Let me?
- I cannot...

1401
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:53,875
<i>Everyone will know
just who you are.</i>

1402
01:30:53,958 --> 01:30:56,208
<i>And Betty will despise you even more.</i>

1403
01:30:56,292 --> 01:30:57,958
Sir, please.

1404
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:08,750
Sir.

1405
01:31:15,292 --> 01:31:16,792
My God.

1406
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:39,375
Since when were they red?

1407
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,042
President Ross?

1408
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,708
Agent Taylor, do we fire?

1409
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:28,833
This is what Sterns wanted.

1410
01:32:38,833 --> 01:32:39,875
Jesus.

1411
01:32:45,917 --> 01:32:47,503
Sam, I gotta get these people outta here.

1412
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:48,753
Set a perimeter

1413
01:32:48,833 --> 01:32:50,193
around the White House.

1414
01:33:17,417 --> 01:33:18,583
No.

1415
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:20,292
Fall back. Fall back!

1416
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:28,125
Get down!

1417
01:33:30,917 --> 01:33:32,375
<i>Sam, drones incoming.</i>

1418
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,125
Ruth, I need you to clear Hains Point.

1419
01:34:19,208 --> 01:34:20,667
I'll lure Ross there.

1420
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:22,958
<i>Sam, are you crazy? He'll kill you.</i>

1421
01:34:23,042 --> 01:34:24,167
Do it!

1422
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:23,417
You can still fight this, Ross.

1423
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,042
Do you see where you are?

1424
01:35:27,625 --> 01:35:29,083
You remember this place?

1425
01:35:30,208 --> 01:35:32,042
You used to come here with Betty.

1426
01:35:35,375 --> 01:35:36,500
That didn't work.

1427
01:35:45,292 --> 01:35:46,292
Okay.

1428
01:35:46,375 --> 01:35:47,417
You want me?

1429
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:50,125
Come and get me!

1430
01:37:38,625 --> 01:37:40,708
Sam? Sam, can you hear me?

1431
01:37:41,458 --> 01:37:42,792
Sam, are you okay?

1432
01:37:49,667 --> 01:37:52,000
Please tell me I knocked
that son of a bitch out.

1433
01:37:58,875 --> 01:37:59,875
Shit.

1434
01:38:05,542 --> 01:38:07,167
Backup's five minutes away.

1435
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:09,250
No, tell them wait.

1436
01:38:09,333 --> 01:38:10,583
What?

1437
01:38:20,292 --> 01:38:21,792
Should've taken that serum.

1438
01:38:21,875 --> 01:38:23,708
Bucky is full of shit.

1439
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:29,542
I'm gonna lose that bet.

1440
01:38:36,792 --> 01:38:37,833
Ross.

1441
01:38:37,917 --> 01:38:40,792
We both know you can
take me out with one punch,

1442
01:38:41,417 --> 01:38:43,125
but I don't think you wanna do that.

1443
01:38:50,875 --> 01:38:53,875
I know you've done some terrible things.

1444
01:38:55,833 --> 01:38:57,083
Now, I might be crazy...

1445
01:38:58,333 --> 01:39:00,542
but I think you're trying to change.

1446
01:39:01,625 --> 01:39:03,583
Now's the time to prove it to the world.

1447
01:39:04,792 --> 01:39:06,000
Prove it to Betty.

1448
01:40:01,375 --> 01:40:03,958
The army is transferring
Sterns to a secure facility.

1449
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:06,875
We should get you to the hospital.

1450
01:40:08,042 --> 01:40:10,042
There's somewhere we gotta go first.

1451
01:40:22,458 --> 01:40:23,917
That's three, old man.

1452
01:40:26,042 --> 01:40:27,458
I told you I'd get you out.

1453
01:40:28,458 --> 01:40:29,708
Took you so long?

1454
01:40:34,083 --> 01:40:35,250
Thank you, Sam.

1455
01:40:35,792 --> 01:40:37,125
I got you.

1456
01:40:37,208 --> 01:40:39,000
I have a few broken bones, so...

1457
01:40:42,667 --> 01:40:44,042
Come on, Mr. Bradley.

1458
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:46,083
We got a little paperwork to fill out,

1459
01:40:46,167 --> 01:40:47,958
and then you're free to go.

1460
01:40:54,583 --> 01:40:56,083
<i>Worldwide talks continue</i>

1461
01:40:56,167 --> 01:40:59,042
<i>in the arms race
for the newly discovered element,</i>

1462
01:40:59,125 --> 01:41:02,542
<i>as we enter the
brave new world of adamantium.</i>

1463
01:41:02,625 --> 01:41:04,875
<i>Back in our nation's capital,
ground was broken</i>

1464
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:07,000
<i>on the restoration of the White House,</i>

1465
01:41:07,083 --> 01:41:10,542
<i>marking a significant step
towards normalcy for the country.</i>

1466
01:41:29,167 --> 01:41:30,250
Right this way.

1467
01:41:38,333 --> 01:41:42,167
Mr. President. How're your digs?

1468
01:41:49,875 --> 01:41:51,750
Intentionally uncomfortable.

1469
01:41:53,292 --> 01:41:55,333
I heard the food
hasn't got any better either.

1470
01:41:55,417 --> 01:41:57,250
You heard right.

1471
01:41:58,042 --> 01:41:59,333
Bradley got out?

1472
01:41:59,417 --> 01:42:00,417
Yes, sir.

1473
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:01,875
That's good.

1474
01:42:02,375 --> 01:42:04,375
Mr. President, about your blood work.

1475
01:42:04,458 --> 01:42:06,917
It seems Sterns raised the level of gamma

1476
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,917
in those pills over time.

1477
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,500
It built up in your body over the years.

1478
01:42:11,583 --> 01:42:12,417
That led to your...

1479
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:14,042
Led to my little tantrum.

1480
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:16,625
Which is why I have to be in here.

1481
01:42:18,833 --> 01:42:20,917
Good solid walls, these.

1482
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,083
Yeah.

1483
01:42:22,792 --> 01:42:23,917
But I have to say,

1484
01:42:24,417 --> 01:42:28,417
it wasn't nothin' to see you
take full responsibility for your actions.

1485
01:42:29,083 --> 01:42:33,042
Give up your office. Accept your sentence.

1486
01:42:33,125 --> 01:42:35,125
I had to let the country move on.

1487
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:38,583
Japan decided to uphold
the treaty, by the way.

1488
01:42:38,667 --> 01:42:39,667
Us too.

1489
01:42:40,458 --> 01:42:42,500
The Ozaki-Ross Accords.

1490
01:42:43,333 --> 01:42:44,375
You did it.

1491
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,625
Sam, why are you here?

1492
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:48,750
Sir?

1493
01:42:50,667 --> 01:42:53,833
We were on different sides of this thing
every step of the way.

1494
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:57,625
Look, if we can't see
the good in each other,

1495
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,417
we've already lost the fight.

1496
01:43:02,167 --> 01:43:05,375
Besides, I wanted to make sure
an old soldier was okay.

1497
01:43:07,917 --> 01:43:11,417
I'd love to stay, but looks
like you have another visitor.

1498
01:43:20,625 --> 01:43:21,792
Hi, Dad.

1499
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:29,042
I guess I have to give you
a raincheck on that walk.

1500
01:43:30,458 --> 01:43:31,625
It's all right.

1501
01:43:33,667 --> 01:43:35,958
We could just sit and talk
for a little while.

1502
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,208
I'd like that.

1503
01:43:40,917 --> 01:43:42,125
Me too.

1504
01:43:55,667 --> 01:43:57,042
How's the kid doin' today?

1505
01:43:57,125 --> 01:44:00,125
He's still a little out of it
but doin' better.

1506
01:44:01,417 --> 01:44:02,667
I'm gonna let you two catch up.

1507
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:04,917
Hey, where you headed? Back to Baltimore?

1508
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:06,500
No.

1509
01:44:07,333 --> 01:44:10,458
I got Ruth and me tickets
for tonight's game, courtside.

1510
01:44:11,042 --> 01:44:13,208
It's the least I could do
for gettin' me out.

1511
01:44:13,292 --> 01:44:16,792
I'm happy you found a friend
as grumpy as you are to go to games with.

1512
01:44:19,167 --> 01:44:20,167
Say it again.

1513
01:44:23,625 --> 01:44:26,125
I'm playing. Got you.

1514
01:44:32,125 --> 01:44:34,583
The Falcon awakens.

1515
01:44:36,417 --> 01:44:37,777
Couldn't let you have all the fun.

1516
01:44:43,375 --> 01:44:45,417
I'm sorry I screwed up.

1517
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,333
Screwed up? Get out of here.

1518
01:44:47,417 --> 01:44:48,542
I did.

1519
01:44:49,125 --> 01:44:50,542
You never messed up like I have.

1520
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:53,625
You never got shot out of the sky

1521
01:44:53,708 --> 01:44:56,917
and nosedived into the Indian Ocean.

1522
01:44:57,625 --> 01:44:59,042
You're always on point.

1523
01:45:01,042 --> 01:45:02,042
Yeah.

1524
01:45:04,125 --> 01:45:05,958
Because if I'm not on point...

1525
01:45:10,292 --> 01:45:11,458
I feel like I let down

1526
01:45:11,542 --> 01:45:14,292
everyone else who was fightin'
for a seat at that table.

1527
01:45:17,375 --> 01:45:19,042
That's pressure, man.

1528
01:45:21,125 --> 01:45:22,542
It weighs on you.

1529
01:45:25,875 --> 01:45:28,375
Makes you wonder if you'll ever just be...

1530
01:45:30,375 --> 01:45:31,625
enough.

1531
01:45:40,958 --> 01:45:42,000
Where I grew up,

1532
01:45:43,375 --> 01:45:45,625
I only ever got to see heroes online.

1533
01:45:46,125 --> 01:45:47,458
Or on TV.

1534
01:45:49,042 --> 01:45:50,625
It always felt so far away.

1535
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,375
And I kept thinkin' maybe
if I get out of Miami,

1536
01:45:55,792 --> 01:45:57,253
you know, maybe one day I could be...

1537
01:45:57,333 --> 01:45:59,000
Don't say Ant-Man.

1538
01:46:02,333 --> 01:46:03,875
No, man.

1539
01:46:08,042 --> 01:46:09,208
I wanted to be you.

1540
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:11,583
Well...

1541
01:46:11,667 --> 01:46:13,167
Sam Wilson.

1542
01:46:14,333 --> 01:46:18,375
Because that guy?
That guy won't ever give up.

1543
01:46:20,458 --> 01:46:23,125
That pressure, that responsibility
you talk about?

1544
01:46:23,833 --> 01:46:25,458
I want that too, man.

1545
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,667
You know it's all about timin', right?

1546
01:46:37,958 --> 01:46:42,458
Control your spin, then hit
your thruster before you kick.

1547
01:46:46,958 --> 01:46:49,125
- No.
- Yeah.

1548
01:46:49,208 --> 01:46:50,542
No. That's...

1549
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:52,167
That's it.

1550
01:46:53,167 --> 01:46:54,917
I should get shot out
of the sky more often.

1551
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,292
Yeah, you will.

1552
01:46:56,375 --> 01:46:58,458
Okay.

1553
01:46:59,417 --> 01:47:01,417
You know, you're gonna
come back from this.

1554
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,000
I know.

1555
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:08,750
And when that time comes,
make sure the suit's ready,

1556
01:47:08,833 --> 01:47:10,875
'cause Ross was right about one thing.

1557
01:47:11,875 --> 01:47:14,125
The world needs the Avengers.

1558
01:47:14,208 --> 01:47:16,417
- For real?
- Yeah.

1559
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,042
Hell, yeah.

1560
01:47:19,875 --> 01:47:22,875
I wasn't thinking about it before,
but now that you bring it up...

1561
01:47:22,958 --> 01:47:23,792
Boy.

1562
01:47:23,875 --> 01:47:25,125
Since the wings are damaged,

1563
01:47:25,208 --> 01:47:27,000
I was thinking, I'm like,
what could make...

1564
01:47:27,083 --> 01:47:28,083
No.

1565
01:47:28,167 --> 01:47:29,000
You didn't hear

1566
01:47:29,083 --> 01:47:31,003
- what I was gonna ask you.
- No. Whatever you ask, nope.

1567
01:47:31,083 --> 01:47:34,833
I'm just saying, maybe you have, like,
the Wakandans on speed dial

1568
01:47:34,917 --> 01:47:36,167
and could get me some...

1569
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:39,875
A hookup on an upgrade on the wings.

1570
01:47:41,167 --> 01:47:43,625
You're gonna ask the Wakandans
for a hookup?

1571
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:44,583
Yeah.

1572
01:47:44,667 --> 01:47:46,337
That is the most Miami thing in the world.

1573
01:47:46,417 --> 01:47:49,125
Are you kidding?
They gonna hook me up, man. Yo.

1574
01:57:19,917 --> 01:57:21,625
Told you you were gonna lose that bet.

1575
01:57:23,083 --> 01:57:24,625
You wanna know what's funny?

1576
01:57:24,708 --> 01:57:27,292
I'm not in the mood for your jokes.

1577
01:57:27,792 --> 01:57:30,375
You killed a lot of good men
trying to get your revenge.

1578
01:57:30,458 --> 01:57:33,250
Trust me, we don't share
the same sense of humor.

1579
01:57:33,708 --> 01:57:36,083
We share the same world, don't we?

1580
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,417
This world you would die to save?

1581
01:57:41,292 --> 01:57:42,458
It's coming.

1582
01:57:43,208 --> 01:57:45,083
I've seen it in the probabilities,

1583
01:57:45,167 --> 01:57:47,083
seen it plain as day.

1584
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:51,042
All you heroes protecting this world...

1585
01:57:52,167 --> 01:57:53,958
