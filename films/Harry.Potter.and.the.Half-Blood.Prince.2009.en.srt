1
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:25,234
I killed Sirius Black!

2
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,657
He's back.

3
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,387
The police are continuing with the investigation...

4
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,597
...into the cause of the Millennium Bridge disaster.

5
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,476
Traffic has been halted as police search for survivors.

6
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,311
The surrounding area remains closed.

7
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,648
The mayor has urged Londoners to remain calm...

8
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,238
"Harry Potter."

9
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,407
Who's Harry Potter?

10
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,952
Oh, no one.

11
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,870
Bit of a tosser, really.

12
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,041
Funny, that paper of yours.

13
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,836
Couple nights ago, I could've sworn I saw a picture move.

14
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,797
- Really? - Thought I was going around the twist.

15
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,100
- Hey, I was wondering-- - Eleven. That's when I get off.

16
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,061
You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter.

17
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,198
You've been reckless this summer, Harry.

18
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,658
I like riding around on trains.

19
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,828
Takes my mind off things.

20
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,248
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?

21
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,752
The tale is thrilling, if I say so myself.

22
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,463
But now is not the time to tell it.

23
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,215
Take my arm.

24
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,136
Do as I say.

25
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,730
I just Apparated, didn't I?

26
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:17,067
Indeed. Quite successfully too, I might add.

27
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,861
Most people vomit the first time.

28
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,780
I can't imagine why.

29
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:33,250
Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.

30
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,712
Harry, I assume, right about now, you must be wondering why I brought you here.

31
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,589
Am I right?

32
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,134
Actually, sir, after all these years, I just sort of go with it.

33
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,516
Wands out, Harry.

34
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,404
Horace?

35
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,959
Horace?

36
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:45,959
Subtitle www.movieddl.me

37
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,512
Merlin's beard!

38
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,974
No need to disfigure me, Albus.

39
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,853
Well, I must say you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

40
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:22,192
It's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

41
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,028
Dragon's blood.

42
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,573
- Oh. - Oh, yes, introductions.

43
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,744
Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend and colleague of mine...

44
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,371
...Horace Slughorn.

45
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,039
Horace...

46
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,000
...well, you know who this is.

47
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,878
Harry Potter.

48
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,466
What's with all the theatrics, Horace?

49
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,094
You weren't, by any chance, waiting for someone else?

50
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,721
Someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

51
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,642
All right, the Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.

52
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,143
Do you know what that's like?

53
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,064
You can only say no so many times, so I never stay anywhere more than a week.

54
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,566
Muggles who own this are in the Canary Islands.

55
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:08,613
Well, I think we should put it back in order for them, don't you? Mind.

56
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,108
That was fun.

57
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,112
- Do you mind if I use the loo? - No, of course.

58
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,116
Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus.

59
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:58,788
The answer's still no. Absolutely and unequivocally, no.

60
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,257
You're very like your father.

61
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,261
- Except for the eyes. You have your-- - My mother's eyes. Yeah.

62
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:17,140
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was exceedingly bright, your mother.

63
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,643
Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born.

64
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,396
One of my best friends is Muggle-born. Best in our year.

65
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,607
Please don't think I'm prejudiced. No, no.

66
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:29,986
Your mother was one of my absolute favorites. Look, there she is.

67
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,946
Right at the front.

68
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,416
All mine. Each and every one.

69
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,668
Ex-students, I mean.

70
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:52,300
You recognize Barnabas Cuffe, editor of The Daily Prophet.

71
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:57,138
Always takes my owl, should I wish to register an opinion on the news of the day.

72
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,975
Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

73
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,603
Free tickets whenever I want them.

74
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,773
Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time.

75
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,026
Ah, yes.

76
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,362
Regulus Black.

77
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,491
You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.

78
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,202
I taught the whole Black family, except Sirius.

79
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,579
It's a shame. Talented boy.

80
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:27,043
I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set.

81
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,129
Horace?

82
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,381
Do you mind if I take this?

83
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,597
- I do love knitting patterns. - Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?

84
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,892
I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable.

85
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,353
I would have considered it a personal triumph...

86
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,481
...had you consented to return to Hogwarts. Oh, well.

87
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,651
You're like my friend Mr. Potter here, one of a kind.

88
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,987
Well, bye-bye, Horace.

89
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,322
Bye.

90
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,836
All right. I'll do it.

91
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:14,591
But I want Professor Merrythought's old office, not the water closet I had before.

92
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,970
And I expect a raise. These are mad times we live in. Mad!

93
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,390
They are indeed.

94
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,687
Sir, exactly what was all that about?

95
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:32,942
You are talented, famous and powerful. Everything Horace values.

96
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,529
Professor Slughorn is gonna try to collect you, Harry.

97
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,073
You would be his crowning jewel.

98
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,787
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts. And it's crucial he should return.

99
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,625
I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry.

100
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:53,838
She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.

101
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,467
It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse.

102
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:01,304
Oh, you'll not be returning to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

103
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,474
But, sir, what about Hedwig? And my trunk?

104
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,310
Both are waiting for you.

105
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,345
Hedwig.

106
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,182
Mum?

107
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,935
Ginny, what is it?

108
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,604
I was only wondering when Harry got here.

109
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,024
- What? Harry? Harry who? - Harry Potter, of course.

110
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,361
I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?

111
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:02,031
- His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl. - No, dear, I seriously doubt that.

112
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,327
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?

113
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,454
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

114
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,624
Of course not. I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?

115
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,335
- Is that an owl? - You haven't seen him, have you?

116
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,254
He's wandering about the house.

117
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,172
- Really? - Really.

118
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,008
Harry!

119
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,932
Harry!

120
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,684
Hello.

121
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:33,146
What a lovely surprise.

122
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,567
Why didn't you let us know you were coming?

123
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,570
- I didn't know. Dumbledore. - Oh, that man.

124
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,989
But then, what would we do without him?

125
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,909
Got a bit of toothpaste.

126
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,543
So when did you get here?

127
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,420
A few days ago.

128
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,673
Though for a while, I wasn't sure I was coming.

129
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,761
Mum sort of lost it last week.

130
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,889
Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.

131
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,432
That it's too dangerous.

132
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,435
- Oh, come on. - She's not alone.

133
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,938
Even my parents, and they're Muggles, know something bad's happening.

134
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,984
Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy...

135
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,695
...and it took a few days, but she came around.

136
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,950
But this is Hogwarts we're talking about. It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?

137
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,829
There's been a lot of talk recently that...

138
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,290
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.

139
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,250
Rubbish! Well, he's only...

140
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,002
What is he?

141
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,381
Hundred and fifty? Give or take a few years.

142
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:05,279
Cissy! You can't do this! He can't be trusted!

143
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,906
The Dark Lord trusts him.

144
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,660
- The Dark Lord's mistaken. - Pfft.

145
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,191
Run along, Wormtail.

146
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,697
I know I ought not to be here.

147
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,576
The Dark Lord himself forbade me to speak of this.

148
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,412
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak.

149
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:58,833
Put it down, Bella. We mustn't touch what isn't ours.

150
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,674
As it so happens, I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

151
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,009
You?

152
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,387
The Dark Lord told you?

153
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,515
Your sister doubts me.

154
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,394
Understandable. Over the years I've played my part well.

155
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:22,398
So well, I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.

156
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:27,653
Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.

157
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,739
I don't doubt you, Severus.

158
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:33,075
You should be honored, Cissy. As should Draco.

159
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,373
He's just a boy.

160
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,252
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.

161
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,549
But it might be possible for me to help Draco.

162
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,221
- Severus. - Swear to it.

163
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,727
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

164
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,651
It's just empty words.

165
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,029
He'll give it his best effort.

166
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,573
But when it matters most...

167
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,412
...he'll just slither back into his hole.

168
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,501
Coward.

169
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,132
Take out your wand.

170
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,480
Will you...

171
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,691
...Severus Snape...

172
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,777
...watch over Draco Malfoy...

173
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:54,782
...as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?

174
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,827
I will.

175
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,873
And will you, to the best of your ability...

176
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,751
...protect him from harm?

177
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,504
I will.

178
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,092
And if Draco should fail...

179
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:18,848
...will you yourself carry out the deed...

180
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:24,020
...the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?

181
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,776
I will.

182
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,552
Step up! Step up! We've got Fainting Fancies!

183
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,762
Nosebleed Nougats!

184
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,015
- And just in time for school... - Puking Pastilles!

185
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,061
- Into the cauldron, handsome. - Into the cauldron, handsome.

186
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,314
I will have order!

187
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,860
I really hate children. I will have order!

188
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:17,823
I really hate children. I will have order!

189
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,911
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder. - A real money spinner, that.

190
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,205
Handy if you need to make a quick getaway.

191
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,123
- Hello, ladies. - Hello, ladies.

192
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,585
- Love potions, eh? - Yeah, they really do work.

193
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,089
Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own.

194
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,423
Meaning?

195
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,717
Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?

196
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,928
It's none of your business.

197
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:45,726
How much for this?

198
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,269
- Five Galleons. - Five Galleons.

199
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,563
- How much for me? - Five Galleons.

200
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,940
I'm your brother.

201
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,359
- Ten Galleons. - Ten Galleons.

202
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,946
Come on, let's go.

203
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,825
Hi, Ron.

204
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,868
Hi.

205
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,136
How are Fred and George doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.

206
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,888
Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.

207
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,307
I reckon he's right.

208
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,686
Oh, no.

209
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,480
Everyone got their wands from Ollivander's.

210
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,327
Harry?

211
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:51,125
Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed?

212
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,690
Quibbler.

213
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,026
Quibbler.

214
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:47,616
He's lovely. They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know.

215
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,160
- Quibbler? - Oh, please.

216
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,914
- What's a Wrackspurt? - They're invisible creatures.

217
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,251
They float in your ears and make your brain go fuzzy.

218
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,336
Quibbler.

219
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,558
So, what was Draco doing with that weird-looking cabinet?

220
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,435
And who were all those people?

221
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,730
Don't you see? It was a ceremony, an initiation.

222
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,815
Stop it, Harry. I know where you're going.

223
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,484
It's happened. He's one of them.

224
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,153
One of what?

225
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:28,365
Harry is under the impression Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

226
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,492
You're barking.

227
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,786
What would You-Know-Who want with Malfoy?

228
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:36,999
Well, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?

229
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,043
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.

230
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:43,088
Look, his father is a Death Eater. It only makes sense.

231
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,840
Hermione saw it with her own eyes.

232
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:48,344
I told you, I don't know what I saw.

233
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,597
I need some air.

234
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:12,117
Don't worry. When we get to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.

235
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,766
- What was that? Blaise? - Don't know.

236
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:39,061
Relax, boys. It's probably just a first-year messing around.

237
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:42,606
Come on, Draco. Sit down. We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

238
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:56,078
Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school.

239
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,247
I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower...

240
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,541
...if I had to continue for another two years.

241
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,042
What's that supposed to mean?

242
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:07,131
Let's just say I don't think you'll see me wasting my time in Charms class next year.

243
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,759
Amused, Blaise?

244
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,638
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.

245
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,539
You two go on. I wanna check something.

246
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,001
Where's Harry?

247
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:47,129
He's probably already on the platform. Come on.

248
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,315
Didn't Mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?

249
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,067
Petrificus Totalus.

250
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,746
Oh, yeah...

251
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,458
...she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.

252
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:33,133
That's for my father. Enjoy your ride back to London.

253
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,720
Finite.

254
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,145
- Hello, Harry. - Luna!

255
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,233
- How'd you know where I was? - Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.

256
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:40,617
Sorry I made you miss the carriages, by the way, Luna.

257
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,954
That's all right. It was like being with a friend.

258
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,165
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.

259
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,375
That's nice.

260
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,753
About time. I've been looking all over for you two.

261
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,756
Right. Names?

262
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,384
Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years.

263
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,678
No exceptions, Potter.

264
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,972
Who are those people?

265
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,433
Aurors. For security.

266
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,059
What's this cane here, then?

267
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,604
It's not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick.

268
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,774
And what exactly would you be wanting with a...?

269
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,029
Could be construed as an offensive weapon.

270
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:22,451
It's all right, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

271
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,793
Nice face, Potter.

272
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,677
Would you like me to fix it for you?

273
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,640
Personally, I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way...

274
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,350
...but it's up to you.

275
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,061
Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?

276
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:52,940
No, but I've done several toes, and how different are they, really?

277
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,903
Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.

278
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,366
- Episkey. - Ah!

279
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,667
- How do I look? - Exceptionally ordinary.

280
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,169
Brilliant.

281
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,595
Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.

282
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,185
Will you stop eating?

283
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,604
Your best friend is missing!

284
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,024
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.

285
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,320
He's covered in blood again.

286
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:44,741
- Why is it he's always covered in blood? - Looks like it's his own this time.

287
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,077
Where have you been?

288
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,705
- What happened to your face? - Later.

289
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,498
What've I missed?

290
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,836
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times.

291
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:59,548
Easy for it to say, huh? It's a hat, isn't it?

292
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,099
Very best of evenings to you all.

293
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,309
Thanks.

294
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:17,190
First off, let me introduce the newest member of our staff...

295
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,609
...Horace Slughorn.

296
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,365
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...

297
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:29,828
...has agreed to resume his old post as Potions Master.

298
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,914
Meanwhile, the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts...

299
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,875
...will be taken by Professor Snape.

300
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,752
Snape?

301
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,426
Now, as you know...

302
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:48,263
...each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival here tonight.

303
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,432
And you have the right to know why.

304
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:54,811
Once there was a young man, who, like you...

305
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,439
...sat in this very hall...

306
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:02,444
...walked this castle's corridors, slept under its roof.

307
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:07,407
He seemed to all the world a student like any other.

308
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,117
His name?

309
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,912
Tom Riddle.

310
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,752
Today, of course...

311
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,631
...he's known all over the world by another name.

312
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:29,012
Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight...

313
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,556
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.

314
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,852
Every day, every hour...

315
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,979
...this very minute, perhaps...

316
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:42,484
...dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls.

317
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:49,658
But in the end, their greatest weapon is you.

318
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,830
Just something to think about.

319
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,666
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.

320
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,128
That was cheerful.

321
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:11,179
History of Magic is upstairs, ladies, not down.

322
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:16,977
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies! That is the girls' lavatory.

323
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,189
Potter.

324
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,484
Oh, this can't be good.

325
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,156
Enjoying ourselves, are we?

326
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,285
- I had a free period this morning, professor. - So I noticed.

327
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,204
I would think you would want to fill it with Potions.

328
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,040
Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?

329
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:43,462
It was, but I was told I had to get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.

330
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,506
So you did, when Professor Snape was teaching Potions.

331
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:51,261
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T.s students...

332
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,221
...with "Exceeds Expectations."

333
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,390
Brilliant. Um...

334
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,018
- Well, I'll head there straightaway. - Oh, good, good.

335
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:03,106
Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.

336
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,193
I don't wanna take Potions.

337
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,070
There's Quidditch trials coming up. I need to practice.

338
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:14,743
Attention to detail in the preparation is the prerequisite of all planning.

339
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,621
Ah.

340
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:21,708
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry. We've brought someone with us, I see.

341
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,543
Ron Weasley, sir.

342
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,546
But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace, actually.

343
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,882
- I'm gonna... - Nonsense, we'll sort you out.

344
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,052
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine. Get your books out.

345
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,763
I haven't actually got my book yet, and nor has Ron.

346
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,640
Get what you want from the cupboard.

347
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:40,143
Now, as I was saying, I prepared some concoctions this morning.

348
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:44,272
Any ideas what these might be?

349
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,360
- Yes, Miss...? - Granger, sir.

350
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:56,076
That one there is Veritaserum. It's a truth-telling serum.

351
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,954
And that would be Poly juice Potion.

352
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,251
It's terribly tricky to make.

353
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,461
And this is Amortentia...

354
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,047
...the most powerful love potion in the world.

355
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,802
It's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them.

356
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,097
For example, I smell...

357
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,893
...freshly mown grass, and new parchment, and...

358
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,397
...spearmint toothpaste.

359
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,277
Now, Amortentia doesn't create actual love. That would be impossible.

360
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:35,448
But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession.

361
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:42,289
And for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room.

362
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,630
Sir? You haven't told us what's in that one.

363
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,716
Oh, yes.

364
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,468
What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen...

365
00:34:55,635 --> 00:35:01,057
...is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis.

366
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,727
But it is more commonly referred to as--

367
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:09,190
- Liquid luck. - Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

368
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,694
Desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong.

369
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:18,491
One sip and you will find that all of your endeavors succeed.

370
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,038
At least until the effects wear off.

371
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:27,709
So this is what I offer each of you today.

372
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:32,714
One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who, in the hour that remains...

373
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:37,469
...manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death...

374
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,889
...the recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books.

375
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:44,726
I should point out, however, only once did a student manage to brew a potion...

376
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:48,229
...of sufficient quality to claim this prize.

377
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,066
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.

378
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,735
Let the brewing commence.

379
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,398
How did you do that?

380
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,109
You crush it. Don't cut it.

381
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,778
No. The instructions specifically say to cut.

382
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,780
No, really.

383
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,446
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.

384
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:24,159
So perfect I daresay one drop would kill us all.

385
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,414
So here we are, then, as promised.

386
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,792
One vial of Felix Felicis.

387
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,003
Congratulations.

388
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,256
Use it well.

389
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,536
Harry, you got my message. Come in.

390
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,581
How are you?

391
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,291
I'm fine, sir.

392
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,709
Enjoying your classes?

393
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,005
I know Professor Slughorn is most impressed with you.

394
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,008
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.

395
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:23,843
Do you?

396
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,637
Definitely.

397
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,475
What about your activities outside the classroom?

398
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,686
- Sir? - Well, I notice you spend...

399
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,481
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

400
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,899
I can't help wondering...

401
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:43,071
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant, and we're friends, but, no.

402
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,241
Forgive me. I was merely being curious.

403
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,202
But enough chitchat.

404
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,997
You must be wondering why I summoned you here tonight.

405
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,417
The answer lies here.

406
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,587
What you are looking at are memories.

407
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:03,591
In this case, pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...

408
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,219
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.

409
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:13,101
This vial contains the most particular memory...

410
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,478
...of the day I first met him.

411
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,607
I'd like you to see it, if you would.

412
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:01,482
I admit some confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.

413
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,278
In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor.

414
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:09,198
There have been incidents with the other children. Nasty things.

415
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,786
Tom, you have a visitor.

416
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,997
How do you do, Tom?

417
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,756
Don't.

418
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,683
- You're the doctor, aren't you? - No.

419
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,894
I am a professor.

420
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,438
I don't believe you.

421
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,607
She wants me looked at.

422
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,401
They think I'm different.

423
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,070
Well, perhaps they're right.

424
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,696
I'm not mad.

425
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,200
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.

426
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,369
Hogwarts is a school.

427
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,287
A school of magic.

428
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,544
You can do things, can't you, Tom?

429
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,340
Things other children can't.

430
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,678
I can make things move without touching them.

431
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:16,182
I can make animals do what I want without training them.

432
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:20,520
I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.

433
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,106
I can make them hurt...

434
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,274
...if I want.

435
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,694
Who are you?

436
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,071
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

437
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,699
I'm different.

438
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,159
Prove it.

439
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,587
I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom.

440
00:41:56,305 --> 00:42:00,101
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom.

441
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:05,940
At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only how to use magic, but how to control it.

442
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,275
You understand me?

443
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,781
I can speak to snakes too.

444
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,826
They find me.

445
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,746
Whisper things.

446
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:23,124
Is that normal for someone like me?

447
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:47,482
Did you know, sir? Then?

448
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:53,279
Did I know I'd just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.

449
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,990
If I had, I...

450
00:42:57,617 --> 00:43:00,078
Over time, while here at Hogwarts...

451
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,581
...Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.

452
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,583
Can you guess who that teacher might be?

453
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:11,964
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you?

454
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,175
No, I did not.

455
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:18,179
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly.

456
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,057
And he will not give it up easily.

457
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:24,435
You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.

458
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,853
I did.

459
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,564
Do you want me to let him?

460
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,317
Yes.

461
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,195
All right. Um...

462
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,448
This morning, I'm gonna be putting you all through a few drills...

463
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,742
...just to assess your strengths.

464
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,453
Quiet! Please!

465
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,787
Shut it!

466
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:13,377
Thanks. All right. Um...

467
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,671
Just because you made the team last year...

468
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,799
...does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear?

469
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,595
Good.

470
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,522
No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?

471
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,274
Hard feelings?

472
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,986
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well. It's nothing personal.

473
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,822
Really? Strapping guy like you?

474
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,575
You've got more of a Beater's build, don't you think?

475
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,161
Keepers need to be quick, agile.

476
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,331
Oh, I like my chances.

477
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:54,293
Say, think you could introduce me to your friend Granger?

478
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,631
Wouldn't mind getting on a first-name basis, know what I mean?

479
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,645
Come on, Weasley!

480
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,522
- Come on, Ron! - Go on, Weasley!

481
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:18,943
- Go on, Weasley! - Yeah, Ron!

482
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,361
Go on, Cormac!

483
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,963
Come on, Ron!

484
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,889
Come on, Ron.

485
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,517
Come on, Ron.

486
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,578
Confundus.

487
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,013
Isn't he brilliant?

488
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:35,269
I have to admit, I thought I was gonna miss that last one.

489
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:38,397
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.

490
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,859
He's got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac.

491
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,945
He's vile.

492
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:52,161
Have you ever heard of this spell? Sectumsempra?

493
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:54,413
No, I haven't.

494
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,708
And if you had a shred of self-respect, you'd hand that book in.

495
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,336
Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.

496
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:04,673
He's even better than you, Hermione. Slughorn thinks he's a genius.

497
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,093
What?

498
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,638
I'd like to know whose that book was. Let's have a look.

499
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,306
No.

500
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,101
Why not?

501
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,269
The binding is fragile.

502
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,064
- The binding is fragile? - Yeah.

503
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,903
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince? - Who?

504
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,824
That's what it says right here: "This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince."

505
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:50,511
For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it...

506
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,972
...yet you have no desire to find out who he is?

507
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:56,559
I didn't say I wasn't curious, and I don't sleep with it.

508
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,768
Well, it's true.

509
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:01,689
I like a nice chat before I go to bed. Now all you do is read that bloody book.

510
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,858
It's just like being with Hermione.

511
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:07,653
Well, I was curious, so I went to--

512
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,364
- The library. - The library. And?

513
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,908
And nothing.

514
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:16,078
I couldn't find a reference anywhere to a Half-Blood Prince.

515
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:18,372
- There we go. That settles it, then. - Filius!

516
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,875
I was hoping to find you in the Three Broomsticks!

517
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:25,713
No, emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace.

518
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,635
Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?

519
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,221
A chum of mine was sledging down Claxby Hill.

520
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:38,017
We had a very long, homemade, Norwegian-style sledge...

521
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:40,644
No, not there. Over here.

522
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,813
No, sit beside me.

523
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:45,858
Okay.

524
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:48,694
Something to drink?

525
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:51,405
Three Butterbeers, and some ginger in mine, please.

526
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,127
Oh, bloody hell.

527
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,924
Slick git.

528
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,927
Honestly, Ronald, they're only holding hands.

529
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,014
And snogging.

530
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,643
- I'd like to leave. - What?

531
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,394
You can't be serious.

532
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,939
- That happens to be my sister. - So?

533
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:29,026
What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me? You expect her to leave?

534
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,780
- Hey, my boy! - Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

535
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,949
And you, and you.

536
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,909
So, what brings you here?

537
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:41,789
The Three Broomsticks and I go way back, further than I care to admit.

538
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:45,417
I can remember when it was One Broomstick.

539
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,921
All hands on deck, Granger. Listen, my boy, in the old days...

540
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:52,508
...I used to throw together the occasional supper party...

541
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,885
...for the select student or two.

542
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,931
- Would you be game? - I'd consider it an honor, sir.

543
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,560
You would be welcome too, Granger.

544
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:08,107
- I'd be delighted, sir. - Splendid. Look for my owl.

545
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,943
Good to see you, Wallenby.

546
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,575
What are you playing at?

547
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,704
Dumbledore's asked me to get to know him.

548
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,831
- Get to know him? - I don't know.

549
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:27,751
It must be important. If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

550
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,467
Got a little bit...

551
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,230
Katie, you don't know what it could be.

552
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:49,857
- Harry. - What?

553
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:53,527
Did you hear what she was saying back at the pub about me and her snogging?

554
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,071
As if.

555
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:05,831
I warned her. I warned her not to touch it.

556
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,064
Don't get any closer. Get back, all of you.

557
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:47,414
Do not touch that, except by the wrappings. Do you understand?

558
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,472
You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession...

559
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:06,141
...when she entered the Three Broomsticks?

560
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,310
It's like I said.

561
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:13,440
She left to go to the loo, and when she came back she had the package.

562
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:17,403
She said it was important that she deliver it.

563
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:21,740
- Did she say to whom? - To Professor Dumbledore.

564
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:24,743
Very well. Thank you, Leanne. You may go.

565
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:34,962
Why is it when something happens it is always you three?

566
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:40,467
Believe me, professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years.

567
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,594
McGonagall: Oh, Severus.

568
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,185
What do you think?

569
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:56,900
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

570
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,319
She was cursed, wasn't she?

571
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,156
I know Katie. Off the pitch, she wouldn't hurt a fly.

572
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:06,243
If she was delivering that to Dumbledore, she wasn't doing it knowingly.

573
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,328
Yes, she was cursed.

574
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:10,789
It was Malfoy.

575
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:16,503
That is a very serious accusation, Potter.

576
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,172
Indeed.

577
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:22,426
- Your evidence? - I just know.

578
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,179
You just...

579
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,806
...know.

580
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,770
You astonish with your gifts, Potter.

581
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,899
Gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing.

582
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:43,197
How grand it must be to be the Chosen One.

583
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:51,371
I suggest you go back to your dormitories. All of you.

584
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:04,802
What do you suppose Dean sees in her? Ginny?

585
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:08,514
Well, what does she see in him?

586
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,891
Dean? He's brilliant.

587
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:13,894
You called him a slick git not five hours ago.

588
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:17,856
Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?

589
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:22,569
Something snaps, and you've gotta hate him, you know? On principle.

590
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,738
I suppose.

591
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,159
- So, what is it he sees in her? - I don't know.

592
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,329
She's smart, funny.

593
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,374
- Attractive. - Attractive?

594
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:40,420
- You know, she's got nice skin. - Skin?

595
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,090
Dean dates my sister because of her skin?

596
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:47,761
Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.

597
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,891
Hermione's got nice skin.

598
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,353
Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.

599
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,398
I've never really thought about it.

600
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:02,651
But, I suppose, yeah.

601
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:04,862
Very nice.

602
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:12,661
- I think I'll be going to sleep now. - Right. Yeah.

603
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:26,466
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything of your Uncle Tiberius these days?

604
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,136
Yes, sir. In fact, I'm meant to go hunting with him...

605
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:31,513
...and the Minister for Magic over the holidays.

606
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,641
Well, be sure to give them both my best.

607
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,810
What about your uncle, Belby?

608
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:40,439
For those who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.

609
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:43,400
- Is he working on anything new? - Don't know.

610
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:47,654
Him and Dad don't get on. Probably because me dad says potions are rubbish.

611
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:51,116
Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day.

612
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:56,413
What about you, Miss Granger? What does your family do in the Muggle world?

613
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:58,999
My parents are dentists.

614
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,838
They tend to people's teeth.

615
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:09,760
Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession?

616
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:11,219
No.

617
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:17,684
Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick, did bite my father once.

618
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,102
He needed 10 stitches.

619
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,987
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.

620
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:36,119
Look at her eyes. They've been fighting again, her and Dean.

621
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,997
Sorry. I'm not usually late.

622
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:47,214
No matter. You're just in time for dessert, that is, if Belby's left you any.

623
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,223
What?

624
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,016
Nothing.

625
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:07,985
Goodbye. Bye-bye.

626
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,616
- Potter. - I'm sorry, sir.

627
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:17,369
I was just admiring your hourglass.

628
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,205
Oh, yes.

629
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,791
A most intriguing object.

630
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:27,713
The sand runs in accordance with the quality of the conversation.

631
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:31,258
If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.

632
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,677
- If it is not... - I think I'll be going.

633
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:37,180
Nonsense. You have nothing to fear, dear boy.

634
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,599
As to some of your classmates...

635
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:43,186
...well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf.

636
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,855
The shelf, sir?

637
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:49,067
Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.

638
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:53,113
But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry?

639
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,616
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?

640
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:02,706
You knew him, didn't you, sir, Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.

641
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:07,294
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers whilst here at Hogwarts.

642
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,046
What was he like?

643
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:15,135
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.

644
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,637
He killed my parents.

645
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,683
Of course.

646
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:25,062
It's only natural you should want to know more.

647
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,983
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.

648
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,153
When I first met Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet...

649
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,574
...albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.

650
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,493
Not unlike others I've known.

651
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,162
Not unlike yourself, in fact.

652
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,582
If the monster existed...

653
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,376
...it was buried deep within.

654
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,187
Good luck, eh, Ron.

655
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,066
- Nice hat! - Ron, you're a loser.

656
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:14,319
I'm counting on you, Ron. I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?

657
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:16,822
- Looking good, Ron. - Loser!

658
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,534
What's he wearing?

659
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,002
So how was it, then?

660
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,548
- How was what? - Your dinner party?

661
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,341
Pretty boring, actually.

662
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,469
Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.

663
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,642
Slughorn's having a Christmas do, you know.

664
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,352
And we're meant to bring someone.

665
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,231
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen. He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?

666
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:54,234
- Actually, I was going to ask you. - Really?

667
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,072
Good luck today, Ron.

668
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,242
I know you'll be brilliant.

669
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:09,040
I'm resigning. After today's match, McLaggen can have my spot.

670
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,709
Have it your way.

671
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:13,378
- Juice? - Sure.

672
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:15,255
Hello, everyone.

673
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,592
You look dreadful, Ron.

674
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:21,136
Is that why you put something in his cup?

675
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,973
Is it a tonic?

676
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,061
Liquid luck.

677
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:33,106
Don't drink it, Ron.

678
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:44,075
- You could be expelled for that. - I don't know what you're talking about.

679
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,914
Come on, Harry. We've got a game to win.

680
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,648
Yes!

681
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,901
Go on, Ron! Do it!

682
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,145
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

683
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,981
Yes!

684
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:59,609
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

685
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:04,990
Whoo!

686
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:08,368
Yes. Whoo!

687
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:14,958
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

688
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,922
You really shouldn't have done it.

689
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:26,094
I know. I suppose I could've just used a Confundus Charm.

690
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:31,725
That was different. That was tryouts. This was an actual game.

691
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,229
You didn't put it in.

692
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,774
Ron only thought you did.

693
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,867
Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

694
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,623
Well, they're really good.

695
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,130
How does it feel, Harry?

696
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,178
When you see Dean with Ginny?

697
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,726
I know.

698
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,979
I see the way you look at her.

699
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,315
You're my best friend.

700
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,243
Oops.

701
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,913
I think this room's taken.

702
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:20,083
What's with the birds?

703
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:25,171
Oppugno.

704
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,909
It feels like this.

705
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:37,660
Look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.

706
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:42,916
What Lav and I have, well, let's just say, there's no stopping it.

707
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,501
It's chemical.

708
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:49,005
Will it last? Who knows? Point is, I'm a free agent.

709
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:54,594
He's at perfect liberty to kiss whoever he likes. I really couldn't care less.

710
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:58,598
Was I under the impression he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?

711
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,266
Yes.

712
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:04,854
Now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements.

713
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,231
Have you?

714
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,399
Yes. Why?

715
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:12,195
I just thought, seeing as neither of us can go with who we'd really like to...

716
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:14,614
...we should go together, as friends.

717
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,407
Why didn't I think of that?

718
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,117
Who are you going with?

719
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,078
Um, it's a surprise.

720
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:24,457
Anyway, it's you we've got to worry about. You can't just take anyone.

721
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,960
See that girl over there?

722
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:33,299
That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's trying to smuggle you a love potion.

723
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:34,968
Really?

724
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:39,389
Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.

725
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,266
But I am the Chosen One.

726
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:44,310
Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.

727
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,772
I'll ask someone I like.

728
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,108
Someone cool.

729
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,912
I've never been to this part of the castle.

730
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:06,332
At least not while awake. I sleepwalk, you see.

731
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,002
That's why I wear shoes to bed.

732
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:43,202
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

733
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:58,468
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

734
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:02,680
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

735
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,738
Drink?

736
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:20,990
Neville.

737
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,617
I didn't get into the Slug Club.

738
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:25,912
It's okay, though. He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo.

739
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:28,873
- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks. - Okay.

740
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,261
Hermione. What are you doing? And what happened to you?

741
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:47,725
I've just escaped. I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

742
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:50,937
Cormac? That's who you invited?

743
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:53,606
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.

744
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,442
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.

745
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,612
He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.

746
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:01,948
- Dragon tartare? - No, I'm fine. Thank you.

747
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,784
Just as well. They give one horribly bad breath.

748
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,786
On second thoughts...

749
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,955
Might keep Cormac at bay.

750
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:12,208
Oh, God, here he comes.

751
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:17,630
I think she just went to powder her nose.

752
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,882
Slippery little minx, your friend.

753
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,760
Likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she?

754
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,807
What is this I'm eating, by the way?

755
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,601
Dragon balls.

756
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:44,949
You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen.

757
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:48,995
Not so quick, Potter.

758
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:53,666
Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date...

759
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:57,754
Can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.

760
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,173
Besides, I only wish to convey a message.

761
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:03,050
- A message? - From Professor Dumbledore.

762
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:06,888
He asked me to give you his best, and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.

763
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:08,598
You see...

764
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:14,312
...he's traveling, and he won't return until term resumes.

765
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:16,022
Traveling where?

766
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:26,032
Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!

767
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,868
Professor Slughorn, sir.

768
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:33,372
I just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.

769
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,583
He claims to have been invited to your party.

770
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:39,045
Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?

771
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:43,049
I'll escort him out.

772
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:49,514
Certainly, professor.

773
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:56,395
All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.

774
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:03,402
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?

775
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,655
I swore to protect you.

776
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:09,158
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

777
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,494
I don't need protection.

778
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:15,832
I was chosen for this. Out of all others. Me.

779
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:20,294
- And I won't fail him. - You're afraid, Draco.

780
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:24,799
You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you.

781
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,425
No!

782
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:30,179
I was chosen. This is my moment.

783
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,193
"Unbreakable Vow."

784
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,987
You're sure that's what Snape said?

785
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,447
Positive. Why?

786
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:52,118
Well, it's just you can't break an Unbreakable Vow.

787
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:55,621
I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.

788
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,874
You don't understand.

789
01:12:58,499 --> 01:12:59,542
Oh, bloody hell.

790
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:29,322
I miss you.

791
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:32,575
Lovely.

792
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:36,037
All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.

793
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:38,414
I'll take your word for it.

794
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:53,471
So, what happens to you? What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow?

795
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:55,723
You die.

796
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:03,189
Wait, the pudding's still here.

797
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,776
Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?

798
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,027
I know it sounds mad.

799
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:11,697
Has it occurred to you Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help...

800
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:14,367
...so he could find out what he was up to?

801
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:17,536
- That's not what it sounded like. - Perhaps Harry's right, Remus.

802
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:19,705
To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's--

803
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:23,376
It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

804
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:27,630
- Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do. - Dumbledore can make mistakes.

805
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:28,965
You're blinded by hatred.

806
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,175
- I'm not. - Yes, you are.

807
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:35,930
People are disappearing, Harry, daily.

808
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:38,057
We place our trust in a handful of people.

809
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:41,185
If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed.

810
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:07,211
Open up, you.

811
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:10,506
Don't you trust me?

812
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:17,847
It's good.

813
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,600
Yeah, I'll just-- Get-- Yeah.

814
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,152
- Pie? - Not for me, no.

815
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,623
You'll have to forgive Remus.

816
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:47,710
It takes its toll, his condition.

817
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,671
Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?

818
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:53,382
We're being followed, all of us.

819
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,052
Most days, Molly doesn't leave the house.

820
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:58,971
It's not been easy.

821
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,391
Did you get my owl?

822
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,643
Yes, I did.

823
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:09,190
If Dumbledore's traveling, then that's news to the Ministry...

824
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:11,817
...but perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.

825
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:15,029
As for Draco Malfoy...

826
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:16,822
...I know a bit more.

827
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:20,493
- Go on. - I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

828
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:22,995
I think, from what you described...

829
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:24,830
...what you and Ron saw in summer...

830
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:28,501
...the object that Draco is so interested in...

831
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,169
...is a vanishing cabinet.

832
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,338
A vanishing cabinet?

833
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:36,509
They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power.

834
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:39,637
You can see the appeal. Should Death Eaters come knocking...

835
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:44,558
...one simply had to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.

836
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:46,936
They can transport you anywhere.

837
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:50,481
Tricky contraptions though, very temperamental.

838
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:53,567
What happened to it? The one at Borgin and Burkes?

839
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:54,860
Nothing.

840
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:57,404
It's still there.

841
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:10,209
It was delicious, Molly, really.

842
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:11,710
Are you sure you won't stay?

843
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:16,382
No, we should go. The first night of the cycle's always the worst.

844
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:18,050
Remus?

845
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:27,935
Sweetheart.

846
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,987
Has Ron gone to bed?

847
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:40,990
Um... Not yet. No.

848
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,118
Shoelace.

849
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:58,591
Merry Christmas, Harry.

850
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:01,552
Merry Christmas.

851
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:21,113
- Harry, no! - Remus!

852
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:32,374
Ginny!

853
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:40,216
I killed Sirius Black! I killed Sirius Black!

854
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:42,635
You coming to get me?

855
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:47,056
Harry, can you get me? You coming to get me?

856
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:18,170
Harry?

857
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,356
Stupefy!

858
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,964
Harry!

859
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:16,687
Ginny!

860
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:47,760
Molly.

861
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:12,451
It's easy for them to get to you.

862
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:16,747
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed. You have to realize who you are, Harry.

863
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:19,458
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?

864
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:21,627
Sorry.

865
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:26,632
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.

866
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:28,967
That's my Won-Won.

867
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:33,389
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

868
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:53,325
I'd like to know where you get your information.

869
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:56,537
More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.

870
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:03,710
Sir...

871
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:07,005
...is it true that Professor Merry thought is retiring?

872
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:09,967
Now, Tom. I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?

873
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:14,388
By the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right, it is my favorite.

874
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:17,266
But how did you know?

875
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:20,686
Intuition.

876
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,650
Gracious. Is it that time already?

877
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:30,404
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet will have us all in detention.

878
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:38,370
Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught out of bed after hours.

879
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:42,374
- Is something on your mind, Tom? - Yes, sir.

880
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:46,545
You see, I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.

881
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:52,468
The other professors, well, they're not like you.

882
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:55,888
They might misunderstand.

883
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:57,639
Go on.

884
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:00,726
I was in the library the other night...

885
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:03,479
...in the Restricted Section...

886
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:07,774
...and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic.

887
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:12,196
And I thought perhaps you could illuminate me.

888
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:15,157
It's called, as I understand it...

889
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:19,244
I beg your pardon?

890
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:22,998
I don't know anything about such things, and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

891
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:27,961
Now, get out of here at once, and don't let me ever catch you mentioning it again!

892
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:32,090
Confused?

893
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:34,259
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

894
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:37,930
Well, I don't understand. What happened?

895
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:41,767
This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.

896
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,852
It is also a lie.

897
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,563
This memory has been tampered with...

898
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:51,109
...by the same person whose memory it is, our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

899
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,737
But why would he tamper with his own memory?

900
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:56,782
- I suspect he's ashamed of it. - Why?

901
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,450
Why, indeed?

902
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:02,621
I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

903
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:06,416
Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory...

904
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,126
...any way you can.

905
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:10,254
I don't know him that well, sir.

906
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,636
This memory is everything.

907
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:20,138
Without it, we are blind.

908
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:24,268
Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.

909
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:28,146
You have no choice.

910
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:31,358
You must not fail.

911
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:41,827
So I'd highly recommend you reacquaint yourself...

912
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:43,412
...with the chapter on antidotes.

913
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:47,332
I'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class. Right, off you go.

914
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:50,002
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.

915
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:59,261
Aha. If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself.

916
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,346
To what do I owe this pleasure?

917
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:04,600
Sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.

918
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,019
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

919
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:10,188
The other day I was in the library, in the Restricted Section...

920
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:14,026
...and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic.

921
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,030
Yes. And what was this rare piece of magic?

922
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:21,533
Well, I don't know. I can't remember the name exactly.

923
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:26,038
It got me wondering, are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us?

924
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,458
I'm Potions Master, Harry.

925
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,377
I think your question'd better be posed to Professor Snape.

926
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,463
Yes. Um...

927
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:37,132
He and I don't exactly see eye to eye, sir.

928
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:39,092
What I mean to say is...

929
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:41,720
...well, he's not like you.

930
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:44,222
He might misunderstand.

931
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:49,353
Yes. There can be no light without the dark.

932
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:53,565
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always strive to live within the light.

933
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:55,859
I suggest you do the same.

934
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:59,237
Is that what you told Tom Riddle, when he came asking questions?

935
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:09,247
Dumbledore put you up to this, didn't he?

936
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:12,876
Didn't he?

937
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:21,551
Yes?

938
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:24,054
Oh, it's you, Potter.

939
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:26,598
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

940
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:43,198
It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.

941
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:45,617
Divine.

942
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:48,578
Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?

943
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:53,291
It was on your bed, the box. I just thought I'd try one.

944
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:56,962
- Or 20. - I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

945
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:59,131
Honestly, I reckoned she was annoying you.

946
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:01,633
She could never annoy me.

947
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:04,970
I think I love her.

948
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:10,851
Well, brilliant.

949
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,314
Do you think she knows I exist?

950
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,984
I hope so. She's been snogging you for three months.

951
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:22,112
Snogging? Who are you talking about?

952
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:24,281
Who are you talking about?

953
01:27:25,031 --> 01:27:28,660
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

954
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:30,328
Okay, very funny.

955
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:37,127
- What was that for? - It's no joke! I'm in love with her!

956
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:40,172
Fine, you're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her?

957
01:27:41,131 --> 01:27:44,092
No. Can you introduce me?

958
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:10,535
Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you to Romilda Vane.

959
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:25,008
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely essential.

960
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:27,260
Where's Romilda?

961
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:29,387
What's the matter with Wenby?

962
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,723
Very powerful love potion.

963
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:34,267
Very well. Better bring him in.

964
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:37,729
I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry.

965
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:40,816
Well, I thought this called for a more practiced hand, sir.

966
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:44,069
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

967
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:45,904
Perhaps you're right.

968
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:55,831
I'm sorry, by the way, professor, about earlier today, our misunderstanding.

969
01:28:55,997 --> 01:29:00,377
Oh, not at all. All water under the bridge, you know? Correct?

970
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:03,463
I expect you're tired of it after all these years.

971
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:06,216
All the questions about Voldemort.

972
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:08,218
Don't use that name.

973
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:18,019
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.

974
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:21,314
- What's this? - Tonic for the nerves.

975
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:38,123
- What happened to me? - Love potion.

976
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:40,417
A bloody strong one at that.

977
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:44,629
- I feel really bad. - You need a pick-me-up, my boy.

978
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:48,466
Got Butterbeer, wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.

979
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:52,971
I had other intentions for this, but I think, given the circumstances...

980
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:56,975
Here we are, Potter.

981
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:58,643
To life!

982
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:04,482
Ron.

983
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:10,405
Ron. Professor, do something.

984
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:13,116
I don't understand.

985
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:31,301
Come on, Ron, breathe.

986
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:56,368
These girls, they're gonna kill me.

987
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:10,757
Quick thinking on your part, Harry, using a bezoar.

988
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:13,301
You must be very proud of your student, Horace.

989
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,888
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.

990
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:19,808
I think we agree, Potter's actions were heroic.

991
01:31:19,975 --> 01:31:23,979
The question is, why were they necessary?

992
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:25,897
Why, indeed?

993
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:28,066
This appears to be a gift, Horace.

994
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,236
You don't remember who gave you this bottle?

995
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:35,365
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry...

996
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:37,993
...when not polluted with poison.

997
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:41,287
Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.

998
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:42,831
To whom, I might ask?

999
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,835
To you, Headmaster.

1000
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,255
Where is he?

1001
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:54,551
Where's my Won-Won? Has he been asking for me?

1002
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:59,264
What's she doing here?

1003
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:01,683
I might ask you the same question.

1004
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:04,102
I happen to be his girlfriend.

1005
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:07,022
I happen to be his friend.

1006
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:11,401
Don't make me laugh. You haven't spoken in weeks.

1007
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:15,071
I suppose you want to make up now that he's all interesting.

1008
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:18,950
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!

1009
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:21,953
And for the record, I've always found him interesting.

1010
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:28,668
Ah. See? He senses my presence.

1011
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:32,130
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

1012
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:34,632
I'm here.

1013
01:32:40,472 --> 01:32:43,683
Uh... Hermione...

1014
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:49,731
Hermione.

1015
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:52,734
Hermione.

1016
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:04,245
Oh, to be young, and to feel love's keen sting.

1017
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,915
Well, come away, everybody.

1018
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:09,709
Mr. Weasley is well tended.

1019
01:33:13,963 --> 01:33:16,508
About time, don't you think?

1020
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:20,762
Thank you.

1021
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:25,517
Oh, shut up.

1022
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:41,611
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.

1023
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:48,743
Tell me how I broke up with Lavender again.

1024
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:52,413
Um, well...

1025
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,583
...she came to visit you in the hospital.

1026
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:58,878
And you talked.

1027
01:36:00,463 --> 01:36:04,550
I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation.

1028
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:08,012
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.

1029
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:10,515
It's just she seems a bit put out.

1030
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:20,525
Yes, she does, doesn't she?

1031
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:27,198
You say you don't remember anything from that night?

1032
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:30,368
Anything at all?

1033
01:36:30,535 --> 01:36:32,370
There is something.

1034
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:40,336
But it can't be. I was completely boggled, wasn't I?

1035
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:45,049
Right. Boggled.

1036
01:36:52,307 --> 01:36:53,558
Harry.

1037
01:36:55,018 --> 01:36:56,185
That's Katie.

1038
01:36:58,146 --> 01:36:59,772
Katie Bell.

1039
01:37:07,447 --> 01:37:09,824
Katie. How are you?

1040
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:14,996
I know you're going to ask, Harry, but I don't know who cursed me.

1041
01:37:16,622 --> 01:37:20,168
I've been trying to remember, honestly.

1042
01:37:20,585 --> 01:37:24,005
But I just can't.

1043
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:38,603
Katie?

1044
01:38:21,062 --> 01:38:25,149
I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed her, didn't you?

1045
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:57,515
Sectumsempra!

1046
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:47,398
Vulnera Sanentur.

1047
01:39:49,066 --> 01:39:51,903
Vulnera Sanentur.

1048
01:39:54,197 --> 01:39:57,074
Vulnera Sanentur.

1049
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:21,724
You have to get rid of it. Today.

1050
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:28,231
Take my hand.

1051
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:46,123
The Room of Requirement.

1052
01:40:52,588 --> 01:40:55,216
We need to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book...

1053
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:59,095
...where no one will ever find it, including you.

1054
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:08,896
- What was that? - What was that?

1055
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:36,340
See?

1056
01:41:36,882 --> 01:41:38,926
You never know what you'll find up here.

1057
01:41:58,070 --> 01:42:01,991
All right, close your eyes. That way you can't be tempted.

1058
01:42:05,828 --> 01:42:07,538
Close your eyes.

1059
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:37,109
That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.

1060
01:42:51,749 --> 01:42:54,126
So did you and Ginny do it, then?

1061
01:42:54,293 --> 01:42:55,461
What?

1062
01:42:55,628 --> 01:42:57,713
You know, hide the book?

1063
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:59,757
Oh, yeah.

1064
01:43:02,677 --> 01:43:05,262
Ah. Dear, yes.

1065
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:08,224
Still no luck with Slughorn, then, I take it?

1066
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:11,602
Luck.

1067
01:43:12,645 --> 01:43:15,981
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.

1068
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:37,336
Well, how do you feel?

1069
01:43:37,503 --> 01:43:39,130
Excellent.

1070
01:43:40,297 --> 01:43:42,299
Really excellent.

1071
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:46,637
Remember...

1072
01:43:46,971 --> 01:43:48,723
...Slughorn usually eats early...

1073
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:51,892
...takes a walk, and then returns to his office.

1074
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:53,561
Right.

1075
01:43:53,978 --> 01:43:56,147
- I'm going down to Hagrid's. - What?

1076
01:43:56,313 --> 01:43:58,983
No, Harry, you've got to go and speak to Slughorn.

1077
01:44:00,568 --> 01:44:03,154
- We have a plan. - I know...

1078
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,406
...but I've got a good feeling about Hagrid's.

1079
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:09,326
I feel it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean?

1080
01:44:10,202 --> 01:44:12,455
- No. - Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

1081
01:44:12,621 --> 01:44:14,790
Or Felix does.

1082
01:44:15,916 --> 01:44:17,418
Hi!

1083
01:44:48,032 --> 01:44:49,742
Merlin's beard, Harry!

1084
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:54,038
Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat, coughed.

1085
01:44:54,205 --> 01:44:56,165
You probably feared I was Professor Sprout.

1086
01:44:56,332 --> 01:44:59,752
Yes, I did, actually. What makes you think that?

1087
01:44:59,919 --> 01:45:02,004
Well, just the general behavior, sir.

1088
01:45:02,171 --> 01:45:04,965
The sneaking around, the jumping when you saw me.

1089
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:08,719
Are those Tentacula leaves, sir? They're very valuable, aren't they?

1090
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:11,222
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.

1091
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:14,892
Not that I'm familiar with any such transactions, but one does hear rumors.

1092
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:18,854
My own interests are purely academic, of course.

1093
01:45:19,021 --> 01:45:22,316
Personally, these plants always kind of freaked me out.

1094
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:27,738
How did you get out of the castle, Harry?

1095
01:45:27,905 --> 01:45:29,406
Through the front door, sir.

1096
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:31,742
I'm off to Hagrid's. He's a very dear friend...

1097
01:45:31,909 --> 01:45:33,619
...and I fancied paying him a visit.

1098
01:45:33,786 --> 01:45:36,080
So if you don't mind, I will be going now.

1099
01:45:36,872 --> 01:45:38,499
Harry!

1100
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:41,794
- Sir? - It's nearly nightfall.

1101
01:45:41,961 --> 01:45:45,422
Surely you realize I can't allow you to go roaming the grounds by yourself.

1102
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:48,175
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.

1103
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:56,725
Harry, I must insist you accompany me...

1104
01:45:56,892 --> 01:45:58,644
...back to the castle immediately!

1105
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:02,064
That would be counterproductive, sir.

1106
01:46:03,399 --> 01:46:05,526
And what makes you say that?

1107
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:08,195
No idea.

1108
01:46:14,952 --> 01:46:16,370
Horace.

1109
01:46:16,996 --> 01:46:22,293
Merlin's beard. Is that an actual Acromantula?

1110
01:46:22,877 --> 01:46:24,962
A dead one, I think, sir.

1111
01:46:25,754 --> 01:46:27,298
Good God.

1112
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:31,010
Dear fellow, however did you manage to kill it?

1113
01:46:31,302 --> 01:46:34,763
Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.

1114
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:39,143
- I'm so sorry, I didn't-- - Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.

1115
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:43,105
Seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are.

1116
01:46:43,272 --> 01:46:45,482
It's the eyes, I reckon. They unnerve some folk.

1117
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,860
Not to mention the pincers.

1118
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:54,116
Yeah, I reckon that too.

1119
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:58,203
Hagrid, the last thing I wish to be is indelicate...

1120
01:46:58,370 --> 01:47:02,458
...but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare.

1121
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:04,835
Would you allow me to extract a vial or two?

1122
01:47:05,002 --> 01:47:07,630
Purely for academic purposes, you understand.

1123
01:47:07,796 --> 01:47:10,716
Well, I don't suppose it's going to do him much good now, is it?

1124
01:47:10,883 --> 01:47:12,092
My thoughts exactly.

1125
01:47:12,259 --> 01:47:18,766
Always have a ampoule or two about my person for just such occasions as this.

1126
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:24,021
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.

1127
01:47:24,688 --> 01:47:27,149
I wish you could've seen him in his prime.

1128
01:47:27,316 --> 01:47:30,986
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

1129
01:47:32,404 --> 01:47:33,989
Oh, dear.

1130
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:46,919
- Would you like me to say a few words? - Yes.

1131
01:47:47,169 --> 01:47:48,712
He had a family, I trust?

1132
01:47:48,879 --> 01:47:50,381
Oh, yeah.

1133
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:57,221
Farewell...

1134
01:47:57,388 --> 01:47:59,264
Aragog.

1135
01:48:03,769 --> 01:48:06,689
Farewell, Aragog...

1136
01:48:07,064 --> 01:48:09,733
...king of the arachnids.

1137
01:48:10,567 --> 01:48:13,153
Your body will decay...

1138
01:48:14,405 --> 01:48:17,241
...but your spirit lingers on.

1139
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:24,581
And your human friends find solace in the loss they have sustained.

1140
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:43,392
I had him from an egg, you know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1141
01:48:43,559 --> 01:48:47,271
No bigger than a Pekinese. A Pekinese, mind you.

1142
01:48:47,438 --> 01:48:52,609
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis. He was very dear to me.

1143
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:57,948
One afternoon I came downstairs, and he'd vanished.

1144
01:48:58,115 --> 01:48:59,700
Poof.

1145
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:03,078
- That's very odd, isn't it? - It is, isn't it?

1146
01:49:03,245 --> 01:49:06,957
But that's life, I suppose.

1147
01:49:07,124 --> 01:49:12,463
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

1148
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:16,300
- Poof. - Poof.

1149
01:49:30,856 --> 01:49:33,984
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1150
01:49:34,985 --> 01:49:39,281
One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1151
01:49:40,199 --> 01:49:43,160
...with just a few inches of clear water in it.

1152
01:49:43,952 --> 01:49:47,498
And floating on the surface was a flower petal.

1153
01:49:49,041 --> 01:49:51,502
As I watched, it sank.

1154
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:55,839
Just before it reached the bottom...

1155
01:49:56,006 --> 01:49:57,466
...it transformed...

1156
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:00,677
...into a wee fish.

1157
01:50:02,346 --> 01:50:04,473
It was beautiful magic.

1158
01:50:05,474 --> 01:50:07,726
Wondrous to behold.

1159
01:50:10,354 --> 01:50:13,107
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1160
01:50:15,484 --> 01:50:16,527
Your mother.

1161
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:21,073
The day I came downstairs...

1162
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:24,326
...the day the bowl was empty...

1163
01:50:25,869 --> 01:50:28,038
...was the day your mother...

1164
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:34,044
I know why you're here.

1165
01:50:37,047 --> 01:50:39,049
But I can't help you.

1166
01:50:40,843 --> 01:50:42,553
It would ruin me.

1167
01:50:46,265 --> 01:50:48,725
Do you know why I survived, professor?

1168
01:50:49,268 --> 01:50:51,103
The night I got this?

1169
01:50:52,855 --> 01:50:54,481
Because of her.

1170
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:57,192
Because she sacrificed herself.

1171
01:50:57,609 --> 01:50:59,987
Because she refused to step aside.

1172
01:51:00,154 --> 01:51:03,365
Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.

1173
01:51:03,532 --> 01:51:07,244
- Don't say his name. - I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

1174
01:51:08,078 --> 01:51:10,205
I'm going to tell you something.

1175
01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:14,084
Something others have only guessed at.

1176
01:51:16,044 --> 01:51:17,546
It's true.

1177
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:19,423
I am the Chosen One.

1178
01:51:20,424 --> 01:51:22,634
Only I can destroy him, but in order to do so...

1179
01:51:22,801 --> 01:51:26,096
...I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you years ago in your office...

1180
01:51:26,263 --> 01:51:28,640
...and I need to know what you told him.

1181
01:51:29,349 --> 01:51:31,768
Be brave, professor.

1182
01:51:33,395 --> 01:51:35,480
Be brave like my mother.

1183
01:51:36,773 --> 01:51:39,443
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

1184
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:42,863
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

1185
01:51:43,864 --> 01:51:49,077
Otherwise, the bowl will remain empty forever.

1186
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:02,758
Please, don't think badly of me when you see it.

1187
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:08,055
You've no idea what he was like, even then.

1188
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:47,511
I was in the library the other night...

1189
01:52:47,678 --> 01:52:49,846
...in the Restricted Section...

1190
01:52:50,722 --> 01:52:54,351
...and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic.

1191
01:52:55,644 --> 01:52:58,397
It's called, as I understand it...

1192
01:52:59,690 --> 01:53:01,024
...a Horcrux.

1193
01:53:02,859 --> 01:53:05,612
- I beg your pardon? - Horcrux.

1194
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:08,699
I came across the term while reading...

1195
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:11,868
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1196
01:53:12,035 --> 01:53:16,540
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.

1197
01:53:16,707 --> 01:53:18,250
Which is...

1198
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:21,211
...why I came to you.

1199
01:53:24,047 --> 01:53:29,678
A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.

1200
01:53:29,845 --> 01:53:32,472
But I don't understand how that works, sir.

1201
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:39,062
One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.

1202
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:42,858
By doing so, you're protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1203
01:53:43,025 --> 01:53:44,151
Protected?

1204
01:53:44,318 --> 01:53:47,529
That part of your soul that is hidden lives on.

1205
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:51,408
In other words, you cannot die.

1206
01:53:58,582 --> 01:54:01,752
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1207
01:54:01,918 --> 01:54:04,713
I think you already know the answer to that, Tom.

1208
01:54:05,922 --> 01:54:07,424
Murder.

1209
01:54:07,924 --> 01:54:09,259
Yes.

1210
01:54:09,801 --> 01:54:14,723
Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature.

1211
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:20,354
Can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven...?

1212
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,022
Seven?

1213
01:54:22,773 --> 01:54:28,070
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person?

1214
01:54:28,236 --> 01:54:31,990
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

1215
01:54:33,158 --> 01:54:36,203
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic?

1216
01:54:40,957 --> 01:54:42,292
Of course, sir.

1217
01:54:45,253 --> 01:54:47,255
It'll be our little secret.

1218
01:54:56,056 --> 01:54:57,307
Sir.

1219
01:55:12,697 --> 01:55:14,825
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1220
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:17,661
You mean to say he succeeded, sir, in making a Horcrux?

1221
01:55:17,828 --> 01:55:20,956
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right. And not just once.

1222
01:55:21,123 --> 01:55:22,165
What are they exactly?

1223
01:55:22,332 --> 01:55:25,669
Could be anything. Most commonplace of objects.

1224
01:55:28,839 --> 01:55:30,549
A ring, for example.

1225
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:32,676
Or a book.

1226
01:55:33,969 --> 01:55:36,346
- Tom Riddle's diary. - It's a Horcrux, yes.

1227
01:55:36,847 --> 01:55:38,974
Four years ago, when you saved Ginny's life...

1228
01:55:39,141 --> 01:55:41,435
...in the Chamber of Secrets, you brought me this.

1229
01:55:41,601 --> 01:55:43,520
I knew this was a different kind of magic.

1230
01:55:43,687 --> 01:55:48,692
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight I had no idea just how powerful.

1231
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:50,861
- The ring? - Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1232
01:55:51,236 --> 01:55:55,991
Difficult to find. Even more difficult to destroy.

1233
01:55:56,158 --> 01:56:00,036
But if you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1234
01:56:00,203 --> 01:56:01,371
One destroys Voldemort.

1235
01:56:01,538 --> 01:56:04,458
But how would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere.

1236
01:56:04,624 --> 01:56:07,878
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1237
01:56:21,850 --> 01:56:23,727
...leaves traces.

1238
01:56:31,526 --> 01:56:33,612
It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?

1239
01:56:33,778 --> 01:56:36,072
- When you leave the school? - Yes.

1240
01:56:36,907 --> 01:56:39,993
And I think perhaps I may have found another.

1241
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:44,247
But this time, I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1242
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:50,462
Once again, I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1243
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:56,718
Have you ever considered that you ask too much...

1244
01:56:56,885 --> 01:56:59,513
...that you take too much for granted?

1245
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:04,726
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?

1246
01:57:04,893 --> 01:57:07,020
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1247
01:57:07,896 --> 01:57:13,693
I will not negotiate with you, Severus. You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1248
01:57:32,087 --> 01:57:33,713
Oh, Harry.

1249
01:57:36,299 --> 01:57:38,635
You need a shave, my friend.

1250
01:57:41,429 --> 01:57:45,642
You know, at times, I forget how much you've grown.

1251
01:57:45,809 --> 01:57:49,771
At times, I still see the small boy from the cupboard.

1252
01:57:51,314 --> 01:57:53,692
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1253
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:55,652
I'm an old man.

1254
01:57:55,819 --> 01:57:57,487
You still look the same to me, sir.

1255
01:57:58,947 --> 01:58:01,950
Just like your mother, you're unfailingly kind.

1256
01:58:02,117 --> 01:58:05,328
A trait people never fail to undervalue, I'm afraid.

1257
01:58:08,081 --> 01:58:12,586
The place to which we journey tonight is extremely dangerous.

1258
01:58:12,752 --> 01:58:16,256
I promised you could accompany me, and I stand by that promise.

1259
01:58:16,423 --> 01:58:18,258
But there is one condition:

1260
01:58:18,425 --> 01:58:21,636
You must obey every command I give you, without question.

1261
01:58:22,512 --> 01:58:24,139
Yes, sir.

1262
01:58:24,306 --> 01:58:26,433
You do understand what I'm saying?

1263
01:58:27,017 --> 01:58:29,519
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1264
01:58:29,686 --> 01:58:32,022
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1265
01:58:32,188 --> 01:58:36,192
Should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself, you must do so.

1266
01:58:41,364 --> 01:58:42,949
Your word, Harry.

1267
01:58:44,576 --> 01:58:46,077
My word.

1268
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:48,538
Take my arm.

1269
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:52,375
Sir, I thought you couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts.

1270
01:58:53,043 --> 01:58:56,504
Well, being me has its privileges.

1271
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:45,387
This is the place.

1272
01:59:46,179 --> 01:59:47,764
Oh, yes.

1273
01:59:48,682 --> 01:59:51,267
This place has known magic.

1274
01:59:59,275 --> 02:00:00,819
- Sir! - In order to gain passage...

1275
02:00:00,985 --> 02:00:02,404
...payment must be made.

1276
02:00:02,570 --> 02:00:06,199
Payment intended to weaken any intruder.

1277
02:00:07,784 --> 02:00:09,619
- You should've let me, sir. - No, Harry.

1278
02:00:10,078 --> 02:00:12,789
Your blood's much more precious than mine.

1279
02:00:34,686 --> 02:00:39,315
Voldemort will not have made it easy to discover his hiding place.

1280
02:00:39,482 --> 02:00:42,819
He will have put certain defenses in position.

1281
02:00:45,405 --> 02:00:46,823
Careful.

1282
02:01:10,346 --> 02:01:11,473
There it is.

1283
02:01:12,974 --> 02:01:15,685
The only question is, how do we get there?

1284
02:01:37,874 --> 02:01:39,709
If you would, Harry.

1285
02:02:27,006 --> 02:02:29,425
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1286
02:02:30,051 --> 02:02:31,427
Oh, yes.

1287
02:02:42,522 --> 02:02:44,107
It has to be drunk.

1288
02:02:44,274 --> 02:02:47,110
All of it has to be drunk.

1289
02:02:47,944 --> 02:02:51,281
You remember the conditions on which I brought you with me?

1290
02:02:51,447 --> 02:02:53,867
This potion might paralyze me.

1291
02:02:54,284 --> 02:02:55,952
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1292
02:02:56,744 --> 02:03:00,039
Might cause me so much pain that I beg for relief.

1293
02:03:00,290 --> 02:03:02,208
You are not to indulge these requests.

1294
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:05,920
It's your job, Harry, to make sure I keep drinking this potion.

1295
02:03:06,087 --> 02:03:08,548
Even if you have to force it down my throat.

1296
02:03:09,007 --> 02:03:11,134
- Understood? - Why can't I drink it, sir?

1297
02:03:11,301 --> 02:03:16,723
Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable.

1298
02:03:20,643 --> 02:03:22,729
Your good health, Harry.

1299
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:40,163
Professor.

1300
02:03:42,290 --> 02:03:43,499
Professor!

1301
02:03:50,173 --> 02:03:51,674
Harry.

1302
02:03:51,841 --> 02:03:54,344
Professor, can you hear me?

1303
02:03:55,637 --> 02:03:56,804
Professor.

1304
02:04:12,236 --> 02:04:13,363
No. Don't.

1305
02:04:13,529 --> 02:04:15,865
You have to keep drinking, like you said. Remember?

1306
02:04:25,124 --> 02:04:27,001
- Stop. - It will stop. It will stop...

1307
02:04:27,168 --> 02:04:31,589
- ...but only if you keep drinking. - Please, don't make me.

1308
02:04:31,756 --> 02:04:33,883
- I'm sorry, sir. - Please.

1309
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:36,344
- Kill me. Kill me! - No!

1310
02:04:38,262 --> 02:04:39,347
It's my fault.

1311
02:04:41,015 --> 02:04:42,225
It's all my fault.

1312
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:45,687
It's my fault.

1313
02:04:45,853 --> 02:04:49,232
Just one more, sir. One more, and then I promise...

1314
02:04:49,899 --> 02:04:52,235
...I promise I'll do what you say.

1315
02:04:52,402 --> 02:04:54,237
- I promise. - No.

1316
02:04:55,279 --> 02:04:56,656
Please.

1317
02:05:20,805 --> 02:05:22,265
Harry.

1318
02:05:29,397 --> 02:05:30,440
Water.

1319
02:05:31,441 --> 02:05:32,567
Water.

1320
02:05:32,734 --> 02:05:34,527
Water.

1321
02:05:41,034 --> 02:05:42,827
You did it, sir.

1322
02:05:42,994 --> 02:05:44,454
Look.

1323
02:05:46,456 --> 02:05:47,707
Harry.

1324
02:05:49,083 --> 02:05:50,418
Water.

1325
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:53,838
Aguamenti.

1326
02:05:54,047 --> 02:05:55,506
Water.

1327
02:06:31,667 --> 02:06:33,044
Lumos.

1328
02:07:01,489 --> 02:07:03,407
Lumos Maxima!

1329
02:07:12,875 --> 02:07:14,710
Harry.

1330
02:07:18,756 --> 02:07:19,882
Sectumsempra!

1331
02:07:20,049 --> 02:07:21,217
Harry.

1332
02:07:22,176 --> 02:07:23,803
- Stupefy! - Harry.

1333
02:08:22,987 --> 02:08:24,280
Harry.

1334
02:08:28,284 --> 02:08:30,620
Partis Temporus!

1335
02:09:13,162 --> 02:09:16,290
Go to your houses. No dawdling.

1336
02:09:57,123 --> 02:10:00,835
We need to get you to the hospital wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.

1337
02:10:03,254 --> 02:10:04,630
No.

1338
02:10:05,673 --> 02:10:08,342
Severus. Severus is who I need.

1339
02:10:08,509 --> 02:10:12,054
Wake him. Tell him what happened.

1340
02:10:12,221 --> 02:10:13,889
Speak to no one else.

1341
02:10:14,515 --> 02:10:16,726
Severus, Harry.

1342
02:10:22,023 --> 02:10:24,442
Hide yourself below, Harry.

1343
02:10:25,901 --> 02:10:28,904
Don't speak or be seen by anybody without my permission.

1344
02:10:29,071 --> 02:10:32,867
Whatever happens, it's imperative you stay below.

1345
02:10:33,659 --> 02:10:35,328
Harry, do as I say.

1346
02:10:38,956 --> 02:10:40,249
Trust me.

1347
02:10:42,001 --> 02:10:43,461
Trust me.

1348
02:11:04,023 --> 02:11:05,858
Good evening, Draco.

1349
02:11:06,734 --> 02:11:10,279
What brings you here on this fine spring evening?

1350
02:11:10,446 --> 02:11:12,198
Who else is here? I heard you talking.

1351
02:11:12,365 --> 02:11:16,452
I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.

1352
02:11:18,579 --> 02:11:21,415
Have you been whispering to yourself, Draco?

1353
02:11:23,918 --> 02:11:25,378
Draco...

1354
02:11:26,045 --> 02:11:29,006
- ...you are no assassin. - How do you know what I am?

1355
02:11:29,173 --> 02:11:30,966
I've done things that would shock you.

1356
02:11:31,133 --> 02:11:35,262
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?

1357
02:11:35,429 --> 02:11:38,057
Replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison?

1358
02:11:38,224 --> 02:11:39,809
Forgive me, Draco.

1359
02:11:39,975 --> 02:11:42,478
I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak...

1360
02:11:42,645 --> 02:11:45,022
...your heart can't really have been in them.

1361
02:11:45,189 --> 02:11:48,401
He trusts me. I was chosen.

1362
02:11:52,196 --> 02:11:53,989
Then I shall make it easy for you.

1363
02:11:54,156 --> 02:11:55,825
Expelliarmus!

1364
02:11:59,161 --> 02:12:01,497
Very good. Very good.

1365
02:12:03,249 --> 02:12:04,708
You're not alone.

1366
02:12:05,793 --> 02:12:06,836
There are others.

1367
02:12:08,879 --> 02:12:10,297
How?

1368
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:14,260
The vanishing cabinet in the Room of Requirement.

1369
02:12:15,010 --> 02:12:17,388
- I've been mending it. - Let me guess.

1370
02:12:17,555 --> 02:12:20,516
It has a sister. A twin.

1371
02:12:20,683 --> 02:12:22,893
In Borgin and Burkes. They form a passage.

1372
02:12:23,060 --> 02:12:24,854
ingenious.

1373
02:12:25,521 --> 02:12:26,772
Draco...

1374
02:12:26,939 --> 02:12:33,028
...years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices.

1375
02:12:33,946 --> 02:12:36,866
- Please let me help you. - I don't want your help!

1376
02:12:37,658 --> 02:12:41,162
Don't you understand? I have to do this.

1377
02:12:42,371 --> 02:12:44,039
I have to kill you.

1378
02:12:44,665 --> 02:12:46,709
Or he's gonna kill me.

1379
02:12:56,218 --> 02:12:59,847
Well, look what we have here.

1380
02:13:01,724 --> 02:13:03,893
Well done, Draco.

1381
02:13:07,563 --> 02:13:09,398
Good evening, Bellatrix.

1382
02:13:10,441 --> 02:13:12,610
I think introductions are in order, don't you?

1383
02:13:12,776 --> 02:13:17,907
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.

1384
02:13:18,532 --> 02:13:19,909
Do it.

1385
02:13:21,202 --> 02:13:25,331
He doesn't have the stomach, just like his father.

1386
02:13:25,748 --> 02:13:27,249
Let me finish him in my own way.

1387
02:13:27,416 --> 02:13:31,045
No! The Dark Lord was clear, the boy is to do it.

1388
02:13:31,212 --> 02:13:33,255
This is your moment. Do it.

1389
02:13:34,798 --> 02:13:36,800
Go on, Draco.

1390
02:13:36,967 --> 02:13:39,136
Now!

1391
02:13:40,387 --> 02:13:41,722
No.

1392
02:13:53,609 --> 02:13:55,152
Severus.

1393
02:14:04,161 --> 02:14:05,621
Please.

1394
02:14:06,622 --> 02:14:07,957
Avada Kedavra.

1395
02:14:50,916 --> 02:14:54,169
Yeah!

1396
02:15:12,354 --> 02:15:15,816
Hagrid! Hello?

1397
02:15:15,983 --> 02:15:20,029
Snape! He trusted you!

1398
02:15:24,366 --> 02:15:25,993
Go on.

1399
02:15:26,660 --> 02:15:28,370
Incarcerous.

1400
02:15:28,537 --> 02:15:31,206
Fight back! You coward, fight back!

1401
02:15:32,833 --> 02:15:36,045
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.

1402
02:15:56,190 --> 02:15:57,566
Sectumsempra!

1403
02:16:06,033 --> 02:16:11,288
You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?

1404
02:16:12,039 --> 02:16:13,207
Yes.

1405
02:16:13,916 --> 02:16:18,087
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.

1406
02:20:06,148 --> 02:20:07,608
McGonagall: Potter...

1407
02:20:08,317 --> 02:20:10,819
...in light of what has happened...

1408
02:20:12,237 --> 02:20:15,532
...if you should have the need to talk to someone...

1409
02:20:17,492 --> 02:20:21,496
You should know, Professor Dumbledore...

1410
02:20:23,332 --> 02:20:25,792
...you meant a great deal to him.

1411
02:20:44,061 --> 02:20:46,229
Do you think he would've done it?

1412
02:20:46,396 --> 02:20:48,273
Draco?

1413
02:20:49,358 --> 02:20:50,692
No.

1414
02:20:51,860 --> 02:20:53,904
No, he was lowering his wand.

1415
02:20:54,947 --> 02:20:56,907
In the end, it was Snape.

1416
02:20:57,532 --> 02:20:59,993
It was always Snape.

1417
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:02,371
And I did nothing.

1418
02:21:09,044 --> 02:21:10,462
It's fake.

1419
02:21:12,047 --> 02:21:13,382
Open it.

1420
02:21:24,393 --> 02:21:28,397
"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this...

1421
02:21:28,563 --> 02:21:32,234
...but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.

1422
02:21:33,235 --> 02:21:37,114
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.

1423
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:40,325
I face death in the hope that when you meet your match...

1424
02:21:40,492 --> 02:21:42,744
...you will be mortal once more.

1425
02:21:44,037 --> 02:21:45,706
R.A.B."

1426
02:21:46,957 --> 02:21:48,417
R.A.B.

1427
02:21:48,792 --> 02:21:50,085
Don't know.

1428
02:21:52,087 --> 02:21:54,756
But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.

1429
02:21:55,716 --> 02:21:57,259
Which means it was all a waste.

1430
02:21:58,593 --> 02:22:00,095
All of it.

1431
02:22:06,309 --> 02:22:08,395
Ron's okay with it, you know.

1432
02:22:08,895 --> 02:22:10,397
You and Ginny.

1433
02:22:11,023 --> 02:22:14,735
But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.

1434
02:22:16,069 --> 02:22:18,071
I'm not coming back, Hermione.

1435
02:22:19,239 --> 02:22:21,950
I've got to finish whatever Dumbledore started.

1436
02:22:22,117 --> 02:22:24,953
And I don't know where that'll lead me...

1437
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:28,749
...but I'll let you and Ron know where I am when I can.

1438
02:22:30,083 --> 02:22:32,711
I've always admired your courage, Harry.

1439
02:22:32,878 --> 02:22:35,547
But sometimes, you can be really thick.

1440
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:40,844
You don't really think you're going to be able...

1441
02:22:41,011 --> 02:22:43,388
