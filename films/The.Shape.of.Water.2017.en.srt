1
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,026
<i>If I spoke about it,</i>

2
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,652
<i>if I did,</i>

3
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,815
<i>what would I tell you?</i>

4
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,199
<i>I wonder.</i>

5
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,904
<i>Would I tell you about the time?</i>

6
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,573
<i>It happened a long time ago,
it seems,</i>

7
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,744
<i>in the last days
of a fair prince's reign.</i>

8
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,755
<i>Or would I tell you about the place?</i>

9
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,376
<i>A small city near the coast,</i>

10
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,761
<i>but far from everything else.</i>

11
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,141
<i>Or, I don't know...</i>

12
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,520
<i>Would I tell you about her?</i>

13
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,190
<i>The princess without voice.</i>

14
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,400
<i>Or perhaps I would just warn you
about the truth of these facts...</i>

15
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,074
<i>and the tale of love and loss...</i>

16
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:47,369
<i>and the monster
who tried to destroy it all.</i>

17
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,587
<i>My Lord Hedak.</i>

18
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:46,387
<i>So, you are troubled. Tell me.</i>

19
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,058
<i>I've...</i>

20
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,773
<i>I have sinned.
I've offended the god.</i>

21
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,684
<i>I am deep in sin, my Lord Hedak.</i>

22
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,273
<i>Let me judge of that.</i>

23
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,783
<i>I've doubted
the ceremony of the sacrifice.</i>

24
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,613
<i>I don't want to go up there.</i>

25
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,321
<i>Why, everybody's got to go
upstairs, Miss Lloyd,</i>

26
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,867
<i>if they wants to go to bed.</i>

27
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,579
The sirens wake you up?
There was a fire.

28
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,907
The chocolate factory.

29
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,581
Do you smell that?

30
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,371
Oh, my!

31
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,756
Toasted cocoa.

32
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,293
Tragedy and delight, hand in hand.

33
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,711
Something
to eat?

34
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,880
Oh, my dear child.

35
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,512
I would waste away if you
weren't here looking after me.

36
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,643
I am the proverbial starving...

37
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,146
Watch this.

38
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,519
It's Bojangles, the stair dance.

39
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,562
Oh, that's so hard.
Cagney did it.

40
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,229
Different, but beautiful.

41
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,739
It's beautiful.

42
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,862
<i>- I wanna do that, too.
- All right!</i>

43
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,238
<i>- Are you ready?
- Yup.</i>

44
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,619
<i>Come on.</i>

45
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,113
<i>Ah!</i>

46
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,374
<i>Say, you catch on quick.</i>

47
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,502
<i>Look out now.
Here's your last one!</i>

48
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,246
Elisa!

49
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,663
Next time you come to bring the rent,

50
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,544
I want you to stay and see
the Bible movie, huh?

51
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,580
I have... I have two free tickets here.

52
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,000
You bring your neighbor Giles.
He's a good boy.

53
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,384
Bible movie and comedy!

54
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,419
Thanks.
Nobody's coming to the theater, huh?

55
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,806
I'll throw in a free popcorn
and soda! Hmm?

56
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:14,965
Oh, no!

57
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,009
For God's sake,
there are two "S's" there!

58
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,851
Come on! Two "S."
"Mardi Grass!" "Mardi Grass!"

59
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,014
Two "S."

60
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,748
<i>All personnel,
be advised that Sector 12</i>

61
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,424
<i>has now been cleared to Level A safety.</i>

62
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,132
Elisa! Come on.
I'm here already.

63
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,466
You got to learn to be on time.

64
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,303
Hey! What are you doing?
Don't cut in, dummy!

65
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,468
Leave her alone, woman.
I was keeping her place.

66
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,228
I get reported,
I come after you and the mute.

67
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,186
You do that, Yolanda.
You do that.

68
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,491
My feet are already killing me.

69
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,331
I made Brewster pigs in a blanket
tonight before leaving,

70
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,338
and, boy, he just ate 'em up.

71
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,749
No "thank-yous," no "yum-yums."

72
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,792
Not a peep.

73
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,927
Man is as silent as a grave.

74
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,840
But if farts were flattery...

75
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,929
honey, he'd be Shakespeare.

76
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,098
And then I get home
and I make him breakfast.

77
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,514
Eggs, bacon, and buttered toast.

78
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,683
I butter the man's toast, Elisa.

79
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,143
Mmm-hmm, both sides,

80
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,652
as if he was a child.

81
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,063
And I don't even get a thank-you.

82
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,950
You'd be grateful
because you're an educated woman.

83
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,655
But my Brewster,
all he had going for him

84
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,033
was animal magnetism
back in the day.

85
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,664
Hasn't worked in a while.

86
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,160
What in the Sam Hill? Lou!

87
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,454
You boys mind putting
the trash in the cans?

88
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,042
That's what it's there for.

89
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,587
Hard to believe, huh?
That's what it's there for.

90
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,377
All right, all right.
Sorry, Zelda! Sorry!

91
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,920
I don't know what they're doing.

92
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,805
Making a goddamn mess is what I think.

93
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,182
Zelda!
Stop that chatter, please.

94
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,388
Yes, sir.

95
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,769
And there's no call for the blasphemy.

96
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,559
Sorry, Mr. Fleming, sir.

97
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,395
A moment of your time!

98
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,443
Today, we are receiving a new team
and asset here in T-4.

99
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,984
This is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler
from our sister facility in Galveston.

100
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:24,246
Now, I don't wanna bolster
or overstate the matter,

101
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,954
but this may very well be
the most sensitive asset

102
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,745
ever to be housed in this facility.

103
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,808
- How was your trip?
- Fine. Who's security here?

104
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,726
Just one moment, please.

105
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,189
Security! Who's security?

106
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,028
Welcome to T-4, sir.

107
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,158
Yes, sir, I am Fleming,
head of security.

108
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,787
And if there are questions you have
or concerns, you just talk to me.

109
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,210
Do you understand?
I'll be in charge from now on.

110
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,018
Get them out.

111
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,446
Help me move
the cylinder into the compressor.

112
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,944
Bring it here.
Bring it here.

113
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,200
Bring it over here.
There. Mount the cylinder.

114
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,709
We need to pressurize it immediately.

115
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,996
- From there to there.
- Elisa! Elisa!

116
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,415
Come on!

117
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,675
Lord, what goes on in this place?

118
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:00,797
Did you see that?

119
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,106
Yes, I'm wearing the hairpiece.

120
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,236
How does it look?

121
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,701
Oh! Careful of the car.

122
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,662
And it's not a hairpiece.

123
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,705
It's a toupee. It's French.

124
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,701
<i>It's eternal, see?</i>

125
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,996
Tantalus never achieved
the escape of death,

126
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,883
because the fruit on the branches
was just always out of his reach,

127
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,511
and the water in the stream receded
every time he stooped down to drink.

128
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,014
And so that's why
we say things today like...

129
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,593
"Look at those tantalizing pies."

130
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,726
Thank you!
Y'all come back now, you hear?

131
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,312
Yes, pies for breakfast.

132
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,859
Just trust me on this.

133
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,072
Hey, folks!
Welcome to Dixie Doug's.

134
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,733
I've seen you in here before, right?

135
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,401
Yes. I've been here a couple of times,
as a matter of fact.

136
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,069
Partial to key lime pie?

137
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,031
I am, I am.
Two to go.

138
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,954
Just go with it, please.
Please.

139
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,412
Uh, I, uh, it's a craving
that I indulge in.

140
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,332
Can't possibly be good for me,
but nothing I like is.

141
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,967
No, no.
It's a mighty fine pie, key lime.

142
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,093
You wouldn't happen to be

143
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,636
the famous "Dixie Doug" himself,
would you?

144
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,842
Oh, heck no.

145
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,382
The pies are trucked
throughout the country.

146
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,892
- They call it "franchising," see?
- Oh.

147
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,927
They give us the spinners, the signage.

148
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,729
That there's "Pie Boy," our mascot.

149
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,014
I don't talk like that.

150
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,065
I'm from Ottawa.

151
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,225
No.

152
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,149
I completely bought it.

153
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,611
"That's-a-great-a-pie."

154
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,240
The... The, uh...

155
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,914
The little... little guy,
is he supposed to be Italian?

156
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,158
I guess so.

157
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,872
Well, it's very clever.

158
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,294
Y'all come back now, you hear?

159
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,294
"Y'all come back now."

160
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,923
Do you think he meant it?

161
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,639
He had noticed me.
I mean, you heard that.

162
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,353
This pie is rather sordid.

163
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,979
And don't spit it out.

164
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:25,066
Next time we go, we'll just try
a different flavor. Hmm?

165
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,317
Save it for later, put it away.

166
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,785
<i>...as the clocks point to 6:00 a. m.</i>

167
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,328
<i>Eastern Standard Time.</i>

168
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,575
<i>The skies are beginning to lighten</i>

169
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,409
<i>and a cool north wind rustles across...</i>

170
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,244
<i>...groups of Negroes have been swarming</i>

171
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,795
<i>in front of and behind
the advancing police.</i>

172
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,705
Oh, dear God!
Change that awfulness.

173
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,715
I do not want to see that.

174
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,385
<i>- A curfew moves into effect...
- I do not want to see it.</i>

175
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,422
<i>Pretty baby</i>

176
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,386
Oh, that's better, that's better.

177
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,384
Oh, look at Betty.

178
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,765
Oh, God, to be young and beautiful.

179
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,307
If I could go back to when I was 18,

180
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,850
I didn't know anything
about anything,

181
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,105
I'd give myself a bit of advice.

182
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,728
What would you say?

183
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,405
I would say,
"Take better care of your teeth

184
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,486
and fuck a lot more."

185
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,367
Oh no, no, that's very good advice.

186
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,200
<i>Pretty baby of mine</i>

187
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,536
<i>Pretty baby of mine</i>

188
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,914
Will you look at this?

189
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,208
Look.

190
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,842
Some of the best minds in the country,

191
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,720
peeing all over the floor
in this here facility.

192
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,134
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

193
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,013
There's pee freckles on the ceiling now.

194
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,803
How'd they get it up there?

195
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:25,232
Just how big a target
do they need, you figure?

196
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,403
They get enough practice,
that's for sure.

197
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,860
My Brewster...

198
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,651
no one's ever called him a great mind,

199
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,492
but even he manages to hit the can

200
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,823
70% of the time.

201
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,207
Excuse us, sir.

202
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,087
No, no, no, that's all right.

203
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,464
Go ahead.

204
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,295
You ladies seem to be
chatting enjoyably.

205
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,463
Girl talk, no doubt.

206
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,969
Don't mind me.

207
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,608
Elisa.

208
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,733
Look, don't touch.

209
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,615
That lovely dingus, right there,
is an Alabama howdy-do.

210
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:20,371
Molded grip handle, low-current,
high-voltage electric shock cattle prod.

211
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,532
Name's Strickland, security.

212
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,789
Fleming's security.

213
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,461
Oh, no.
No, a man washes his hands

214
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,514
before or after tending to his needs.

215
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,766
It tells you a lot about a man.

216
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,468
He does it both times...

217
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,521
points to a weakness in character.

218
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,059
Ladies.

219
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,732
It was very pleasant
chatting with you both.

220
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,963
<i>Short people are mean.</i>

221
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,679
I never met a short man that stayed nice
all the way through.

222
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,139
No, sir.

223
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,521
Mean little backstabbers, all of them.

224
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,265
Maybe it's the air down there,

225
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,100
not enough oxygen or something.

226
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,634
Help! He's losing blood!

227
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:02,931
Help!

228
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,432
Come on, come on.

229
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,356
You think the Russians broke in?

230
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,558
I don't think so.

231
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,021
And if they did,

232
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,528
Duane's meatloaf
will kill them all, honey.

233
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,438
It was two shots.
Did you hear them?

234
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,483
All right, three.
And that scream.

235
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,243
Lord, what ever happens in this place?

236
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,244
You two, come with me.

237
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,531
Right now, Mr. Fleming, sir?

238
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,540
Any chance we get to
conclude our dinner?

239
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,292
Now!

240
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,292
Oh, heavens to Betsy.

241
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,922
We are in a pickle.

242
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,092
We are in such a pickle.

243
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,850
You will have exactly 20 minutes

244
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,561
to render this... this lab immaculate,
and so on and so forth.

245
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,396
20 minutes.

246
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,733
It's a lot of blood.
What went on in here?

247
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,441
I can handle pee.

248
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,326
I can handle poo.

249
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,453
But blood... Ugh.

250
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,286
Blood just does something to me.

251
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,872
Here, hon. Help me mop it up.

252
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,037
The sooner we get outta here,
the better.

253
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,723
Is that a tater tot?

254
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,229
Oh!

255
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,515
It's a finger.

256
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,607
There's two fingers.
Okay, okay, okay.

257
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,487
Put them away.
And just wait here.

258
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,486
I'm gonna go get Mr. Fleming.

259
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,150
Where are these body parts?

260
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,401
The body parts?

261
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,531
No, I believe you, honey.

262
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,661
But are you sure it was alive?

263
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,120
I'm sure. Because I saw a mermaid
once in a carnival tent...

264
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,161
and it was a monkey
sewn to the tail of a fish.

265
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,328
Looked real to me.

266
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,212
I'm sure.

267
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,872
All right, I apologize.

268
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,757
Oh! I have a deadline.

269
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,252
Do you know, uh,

270
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,054
corn flakes were invented
to prevent masturbation.

271
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,347
Didn't work.

272
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,428
Oh, Alice Faye just started.

273
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,480
She was a huge star, huge.

274
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,350
And one day, she couldn't take the
bullshit and the backstabbing anymore.

275
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,937
She just walked away from it all.

276
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,192
Ta-da!

277
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,365
That's not bad, is it?
For being shit.

278
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,154
It's not shit.

279
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,947
Listen. You eat,
you go to bed, you rest.

280
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,536
And when I get paid...

281
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,832
<i>I'm so blue without you</i>

282
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:21,538
...we get pie.

283
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,131
Nothing for me.
No, we don't get pie.

284
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,883
I get pie. You get whatever you want.

285
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,177
Wish me luck.

286
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,929
Good luck.

287
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:35,094
<i>Then I have only this to say</i>

288
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,648
<i>You'll never know just how much</i>

289
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,936
<i>I miss you</i>

290
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:51,072
<i>You'll never know just how much</i>

291
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,237
<i>I care</i>

292
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,369
Green. They want
the gelatin to be green now.

293
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,583
- I was told red.
- New concept.

294
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,622
That's the future now. Green.

295
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,176
Oh, and they want them
happier, the family.

296
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,086
- Happier? Happier?
- Mmm.

297
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,256
The father looks like he just discovered
the missionary position.

298
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,514
Giles.

299
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,388
Well, what are they supposed
to be happy about?

300
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,179
The client wanted photographs,
I sold them on this.

301
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,222
It's too bad.
This is nice work.

302
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,017
It is nice, isn't it?
I think it's one of my best.

303
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,196
How are you holding up?
You drinking?

304
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,823
No, not a drop. No.

305
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,406
Are you getting any work
since you left Klein and Saunders?

306
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,946
You mean since I was asked
to leave by you.

307
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,790
We are not getting into this now.

308
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,826
I wanna come back, Bernie.

309
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,295
We'll see.

310
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,542
Now, do this.

311
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,751
I think we're making great progress.

312
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,881
Good work.

313
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,584
Egg.

314
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,684
Elisa.

315
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,612
What are you doing in there?

316
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,236
Cleaning, huh?

317
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,572
Listen, honey.

318
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,990
Mr. I Pee with My Hands on My Hips
wants to see us both.

319
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,749
<i>"Zelda D. Fuller."</i>

320
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,627
How long have you two
known each other, Zelda?

321
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,629
About 10 years, sir.

322
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,004
No siblings, Zelda?

323
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,008
No, sir.

324
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,761
That's not common, is it?
For your people?

325
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,924
My mama died after me.

326
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,429
After I was born.

327
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,479
What does that "D" stand for?

328
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,142
Delilah, sir.

329
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,852
On account of the Bible.

330
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,237
Delilah, she betrayed Samson.

331
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,240
Lulled him to sleep, cut his hair.

332
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,948
Philistines tortured him,
humiliated him,

333
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,784
burned his eyes out.

334
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,573
Hmm.

335
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,996
Guess my mama didn't read
the Good Book close enough.

336
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,000
And you...

337
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,085
"Elisa Esposito."

338
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:15,499
Doesn't "Esposito" mean orphan?

339
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,960
"Our Lady of Sorrows
Orphanage in Putnam."

340
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,757
They found her by the river,
in the water.

341
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,767
It was you that found my fingers.

342
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:29,850
Oh!

343
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,397
Thanks.

344
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,149
Three hours in surgery.

345
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,277
They rebuilt the first phalanx here,

346
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,778
sutured the tendons.

347
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,655
Don't know if it's gonna take or not.

348
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,655
There was mustard on them.
A paper bag?

349
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,115
It was all we had, sir.

350
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,909
I answer mostly
on account of she can't talk.

351
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,370
She can't? She deaf?

352
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,835
Mute, sir.

353
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,208
She said she can hear you.

354
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,133
All those scars on your neck.

355
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,640
That's what did it.
Cut your voice box, right?

356
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,684
She said since she was a baby.

357
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,096
Who would do that to a baby?

358
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,356
The world is sinful.

359
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,107
Wouldn't you say so, Delilah?

360
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,984
Well, let me say this upfront.

361
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,152
You clean that lab, you get out.

362
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:24,159
The thing we keep in there
is an affront.

363
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,661
Do you know what an affront is, Zelda?

364
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,492
Something offensive.

365
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,156
That's right, and I should know.

366
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,247
I dragged that filthy thing...

367
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,918
out of the river muck in South America
all the way here.

368
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,085
And along the way, we didn't get
to like each other much.

369
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,546
Now...

370
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,972
...you may think that thing looks human.

371
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,979
Stands on two legs, right?

372
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:56,061
But we're created in the Lord's image.

373
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,648
You don't think that's what
the Lord looks like, do you?

374
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:03,064
I wouldn't know, sir,
what the Lord looks like.

375
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,905
Well, it's human, Zelda.
He looks like a human, like me.

376
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,286
Or even you.

377
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,281
Maybe a little more like me, I guess.

378
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,918
That's all.

379
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,257
General Hoyt,
thank you for calling me back, sir.

380
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,338
<i>- Feeling better?
- Oh, yes, sir, much better.</i>

381
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,502
Pain pills is all.

382
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,841
<i>- Close the door.
- You lost two fingers, was it?</i>

383
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,301
Two fingers, yeah.
He got two fingers.

384
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,933
But I still got my thumb,
my trigger, and my pussy finger.

385
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,345
<i>Sounds to me
like you'll do all right then.</i>

386
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,058
Yes, sir, that's right.

387
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,980
Looking forward to your visit, sir.

388
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,608
Decisions need to be made
about the asset.

389
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,118
Egg.

390
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,393
<i>Flavors of fruity pies await you.</i>

391
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,650
<i>Three new locations
in downtown Baltimore.</i>

392
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,276
<i>The future is here.</i>

393
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:23,527
Get some rest.

394
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:24,687
<i>Pumpkin, banana...</i>

395
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,652
Pick me up at 9:30.

396
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,657
2130 hours. Yes, sir.

397
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,908
<i>Dixie Doug's.
That's-a-great-a-pie.</i>

398
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,696
<i>- ...joyous day!
- I'm home.</i>

399
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,536
I made you an omelet.

400
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,121
- Hey, Dad. Guess what?
- No pancakes?

401
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,252
I've been through half the boxes
and I can't find the griddle.

402
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,370
Guess what?

403
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,455
I made you a cheese and broccoli omelet.

404
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,539
How are you feeling?
Does it hurt?

405
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,920
- A little bit. Pills help.
- Guess what?

406
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,005
What?

407
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,967
We're burying a time capsule
at the new school.

408
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,676
I wanted to ask you,

409
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,888
do you think we'll all have
jetpacks in the future?

410
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,223
Believe it, son.

411
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,557
Oh! Bus is here.

412
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,685
This is America.

413
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,351
Bye, Dad!

414
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:08,652
Finish your omelet,

415
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:11,485
then wash your hands real good
and come upstairs, sweetie.

416
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,529
I kind of like it here.
The kids like the lawn.

417
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,119
Plus, DC is just half an hour away,
isn't it?

418
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,120
It's still Baltimore, Elaine.
No one likes Baltimore.

419
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,624
You know what I'm thinking?

420
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,345
I'm thinking, I need a new car.

421
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,849
You need a new car, do you?

422
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,100
How about a Cadillac, mister?

423
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:45,976
Richard.

424
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,822
Oh, Richard!

425
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,452
Sweetie, sweetie?

426
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,495
Sweetie, your, um, your hand,
it's bleeding.

427
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,781
- Silence. Don't talk.
- Sweetie, um...

428
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,245
Don't talk.
I want you in silence.

429
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,126
Silent, silent. Yes.

430
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,578
Yes.

431
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:04,503
Silence.

432
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,387
<i>Dr. Levensen to Aeronautics.</i>

433
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,934
<i>Dr. Levensen to Aeronautics.</i>

434
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,742
Music.

435
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,044
Music.

436
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:05,955
<i>Why do robins sing in December?</i>

437
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:11,540
<i>Long before the springtime is due</i>

438
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:17,675
<i>And even though it's snowing,
violets are growing</i>

439
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:22,384
<i>I know why, and so do you</i>

440
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:27,597
<i>When you smile at me</i>

441
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,644
<i>I hear gypsy violins</i>

442
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,019
Music.

443
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:39,199
<i>When you dance with me</i>

444
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:44,623
<i>I'm in heaven when the music begins</i>

445
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,751
<i>I can see the sun when it's raining</i>

446
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:55,045
<i>Hiding every cloud from my view</i>

447
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:02,470
<i>And why do I see rainbows
when you're in my arms?</i>

448
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,175
<i>I know why and so do you</i>

449
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,259
Are you okay?

450
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,682
<i>I know why</i>

451
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,107
<i>And so</i>

452
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,729
<i>Do you</i>

453
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,778
Hey!

454
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,784
- Gotcha.
- No, you didn't.

455
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:08,782
"The sparrow nests on the window..."

456
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,039
- What?
- "The sparrow...

457
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,875
nests on the windowsill!"

458
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,085
"And the eagle takes the prey."

459
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,123
What?

460
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,340
That's the password...

461
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,839
"And the Eagle takes the Prey."

462
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,885
Let's go.

463
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,489
Bob!

464
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,162
How are you?

465
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,211
I was sitting like a moron
on a concrete block

466
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,083
in the middle of nowhere for an hour.

467
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,085
We meet in this shitty restaurant every time!

468
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,466
I could change my mind.

469
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,594
But you don't.

470
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:04,628
Tell us,

471
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,550
"Bob."

472
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,346
Dimitri.

473
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:07,389
Comrade.

474
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,348
Not "Bob."

475
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,222
What is this?

476
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:11,594
Dimitri.

477
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,475
Anatomical notes...

478
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:15,848
and...

479
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,187
layout of the laboratory

480
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,234
where the asset is being studied.

481
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:20,853
Everything we need for

482
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:21,903
the extraction.

483
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,815
I will pass it on to the directorate.

484
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:27,068
We must do it as soon as possible.

485
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:29,911
Milhalkov...

486
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,079
This creature...

487
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,910
I think it may be able

488
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,162
to communicate.

489
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:34,912
Communicate?

490
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,243
Yes, communicate with us.

491
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,877
I have reason to believe

492
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,503
it is intelligent.

493
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,335
It responds,

494
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,466
It responds to...

495
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,298
language...

496
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,382
music...

497
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:53,719
Will you please

498
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,554
pass that up also?

499
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:56,722
I will.

500
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,275
Now...

501
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,068
eat, Dimitri.

502
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,734
They call this...

503
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:05,568
Surf...

504
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:06,823
...and Turf.

505
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,277
Surf and Turf.

506
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,367
The lobsters are boiled
right here.

507
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:13,910
They squeak a little,

508
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,366
but they are...

509
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:16,826
so soft...

510
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:18,543
and sweet.

511
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,002
Elisa! Hurry, hurry, come on.

512
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,465
I swear to God, girl.

513
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,011
You're doing it again, Zelda.

514
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,641
Oh, give it a rest, Yolanda.

515
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,201
Whoo!

516
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,919
Hey, Zelda, want a smoke?

517
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,500
That shit ain't good for you, Duane.

518
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,006
Yeah, but it feel good.

519
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,296
It does, doesn't it?

520
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,132
Come on, Elisa. Just one.

521
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,718
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Don't worry about that camera.

522
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,765
We push 'em up at break time.

523
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,477
Mmm-hmm.
- This here is a blind spot.

524
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:21,140
Man can't make meatloaf...

525
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,933
It adds a little spice.

526
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:26,983
<i>Sector Five,</i>

527
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,612
<i>must ready energy test,
starting in two hours.</i>

528
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,462
Fleming, I have to finish
some things in here.

529
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,088
Fetch the general, will you?

530
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,355
Aw, you missed me, huh?

531
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,272
I took a candy break.

532
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,490
This is what scares you, huh?

533
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,154
Well, gee, you should be
used to it by now.

534
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,709
There you go again,
making that god-awful sound.

535
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,837
Is that you crying, huh?
Is that what it is?

536
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,123
Are you hurting?

537
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,175
Or maybe you're angry!

538
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,257
Maybe you'd like to get
another bite of me. Huh?

539
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,512
Go ahead.

540
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,643
I can't tell.

541
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,930
I mean, are you begging?

542
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,439
Because to me,

543
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,438
it's just the worst fucking
noise I ever heard.

544
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,130
<i>Paging Captain Walters.</i>

545
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:19,092
<i>Captain Walters, please
pick up the courtesy phone.</i>

546
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,349
Elisa.

547
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,265
Elisa!

548
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,816
General Hoyt!
Welcome, sir!

549
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,781
Everything's ready.
Glad to have you, sir.

550
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,570
- Good to see you, son.
- Thank you.

551
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,955
Good God Almighty!
Is that it?

552
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,749
Hell of a lot bigger than I thought.

553
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,409
Ugly as sin.

554
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,875
You know, the natives in the Amazon
worshiped it like a god.

555
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,961
Doesn't look like
much of a god now, does it?

556
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,546
Well, they're primitive, sir.

557
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,302
You know, they would toss
offerings into the water.

558
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,463
Flowers, fruits, crap like that.

559
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,553
Then they tried to stop the oil drill
with bows and arrows.

560
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,013
That didn't turn out too well.

561
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,844
He's bleeding.

562
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,472
What happened?

563
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,356
It's an animal, Hoffstetler.
Just keeping it tame.

564
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,940
"Oxygen osmosis
and dioxide exchange."

565
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,399
What the hell have we got here, son?

566
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:14,563
This creature, sir,

567
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:17,984
it can alternate between two
entirely separate breathing mechanisms.

568
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,244
- A mudskipper can do that.
- No.

569
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,911
Look.

570
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,743
You want to put a man in space.

571
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,452
He's gonna have to endure conditions

572
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,500
the human body just wasn't made for.

573
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,037
This gives us an edge
against the Soviets.

574
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,581
How long can it breathe
outside the water?

575
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:35,593
The reality is, sir, we
don't know jack shit about this thing.

576
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,181
Well, the Soviets want it.
We know that much.

577
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,516
Those cockeyed bastards.

578
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,223
You know, we let 'em send
a dog up into space,

579
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,394
and we get a good laugh.

580
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,647
Then the next thing you know,
they send a human up,

581
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,806
a Russki,

582
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,351
orbiting the planet,
doing God knows what.

583
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,895
Who's laughing then?
Khrushchev, that's who.

584
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,236
Let him send a dog up into space
and he laughs.

585
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,571
Then he puts a commie up in space,
and he laughs.

586
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,953
And then he puts missiles into Cuba.

587
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:04,989
Have we learned nothing?

588
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,907
Sir, we need to get him
back in the water.

589
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,122
See, these scientists,
they're like artists, sir.

590
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,706
They fall in love with their plaything.

591
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,121
Now, right here, see?

592
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,664
Along the middle.

593
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,924
This creature has
a thick-jointed cartilage

594
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,461
that separates the primary
and secondary lungs.

595
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,846
- Am I explaining this correctly, Bob?
- Yes, but we have...

596
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,598
It makes the X-rays inconclusive.

597
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:24,758
In principle, sir, yes. But...

598
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,928
I believe if we want to get an edge
on the Soviets,

599
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,097
we need to vivisect this thing.

600
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,102
- No, no. No.
- Take it apart, learn how it works.

601
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,016
No! That would defeat the purpose!

602
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,270
Sir, he's passed out. Please.

603
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,196
Put him in the tank.

604
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,573
Let him pressurize.

605
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,741
General Hoyt, sir?

606
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:46,993
You cannot, under any circumstance,
kill this creature.

607
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,246
Count these stars with me, son.

608
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,296
There are five of them.

609
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,792
Means I can do whatever the hell I want.

610
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,302
Now, you want to plead your case,
I'll listen to it.

611
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,090
But at the end of the day,
it is my damn decision.

612
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,137
So crack the damn thing open,
learn what you can,

613
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,181
and close up shop here.

614
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,441
And give yourself a good
pat on the back, Strickland.

615
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:57,601
You've done it.

616
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:58,768
Thank you, sir.

617
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,938
Now, hurry up
and finish the job, son.

618
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,606
Absolutely, sir.

619
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,571
<i>Get him out?</i>

620
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,486
What are you talking about?

621
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,446
No. Absolutely not.

622
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:10,447
Why not?

623
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,958
Because it's breaking the law,
that's why.

624
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,834
We're probably breaking
the law just talking about it.

625
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:15,581
He's alone.

626
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:16,669
All alone.

627
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,751
Oh, he's alone? Oh.

628
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:22,335
Does this mean that whenever
we go to a Chinese restaurant,

629
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,673
you wanna save every fish in the tank?

630
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,348
So what if he's alone?
We're all alone.

631
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,098
The loneliest thing you've ever seen?

632
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,978
Well, you just said it, right there.
You just said it.

633
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,764
You called it a thing.
It's a thing. It's a freak.

634
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:37,604
Say what I sign.

635
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,894
You're not hearing me.
I can understand you.

636
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,062
Repeat.

637
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:42,441
Repeat.

638
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,398
Calm down. God, calm down.

639
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,196
Say what I sign.
All right, I will repeat it to you.

640
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,328
"What am I?

641
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:02,003
"I move my mouth, like him.

642
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,420
"I make no sound, like him.

643
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,841
"What does that make me?

644
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,308
"All that I am...

645
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,643
"all that I've ever been...

646
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:20,560
"brought me here, to him."

647
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,524
See, you're saying "him."
It's a "him" now.

648
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,398
You just hit me!

649
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,941
Elisa, let go of me.

650
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,276
I'm looking. I'm looking!

651
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,410
You've never hit me.

652
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:40,253
"When he looks at me,
the way he looks at me...

653
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,129
"he does not know what I lack...

654
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,086
"or how...

655
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:50,968
"I am incomplete.

656
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,431
"He sees me

657
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:58,096
"for what I am,

658
00:46:58,274 --> 00:46:59,640
"as I am.

659
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:04,311
"He's happy...

660
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,232
"to see me, every time...

661
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,401
"every day.

662
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:15,285
"And now I can either...

663
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,533
"save him...

664
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,251
"or let him die."

665
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:28,965
Oh, God. I'm leaving.

666
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:32,089
Elisa, no. I have to leave.

667
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,757
Just... Elisa, please stop.

668
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,137
Listen to me.
Just listen to me.

669
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:36,973
I have to go.

670
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:40,355
I'm leaving now because this...
Elisa, this is very important to me.

671
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,106
This is a second chance for me.

672
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,063
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

673
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,772
Oh, God.

674
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,063
When I come back, we just will not talk
about this ever again.

675
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,065
Elisa, there's...

676
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,232
All right!

677
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,695
What are we?
What are you and I?

678
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,704
Do you know what we are?
We're nothing!

679
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,578
Nothing! We can do nothing!

680
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,915
I'm sorry, but this... This is just...

681
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,496
Oh, God, it's not even human. God!

682
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,836
What?

683
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,637
If we

684
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:13,968
do nothing

685
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,548
neither are we.

686
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:28,645
Giles.

687
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,572
- I've been waiting.
- I know. Sorry.

688
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:36,736
It's okay.

689
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,030
We going in?

690
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,708
You should have just mailed the art.

691
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:42,867
No.

692
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,753
I want to show it to you
and the team in person.

693
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,710
I think it's some of my best work.

694
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,500
And it's green as can be.

695
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,383
It's, uh, it's not a good time.
Maybe later.

696
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,513
Oh. Well, sure.

697
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,893
No problem.

698
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,681
What would be a good time
for you, Bernie?

699
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,157
You painted that?

700
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,533
Yeah.

701
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,615
Wowee!

702
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:18,946
You're good.

703
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,281
Apparently, not as good as a photograph.

704
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,913
But it is good, isn't it?

705
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,669
I couldn't paint anything like that.

706
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,081
Here. On me.

707
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:30,248
For me?

708
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,213
We don't get many like you in here.

709
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,003
You seem very educated,
and I like talking to you.

710
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,423
The thing is that's...

711
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,680
The only reason
that I come in here is...

712
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:43,390
- The conversation.
- And?

713
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,646
The pie is mighty fine, too, isn't it?

714
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,806
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

715
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,272
It's no key lime, but it's good.

716
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,782
You know, I work alone...

717
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,950
and my best friend's not much
of a conversationalist.

718
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,580
You see, that's part
of doing the job here.

719
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,707
It's like being a bartender.

720
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,584
You serve people pie.
You listen to their problems.

721
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,211
You get to know them.

722
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,878
I'd like to get to know you better.

723
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,338
What the hell are you doing, old man?

724
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,253
- Let's sit down.
- Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

725
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:17,508
Hey, no, no, no.

726
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,922
Not the counter.
Takeout only.

727
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,089
You can't sit there.

728
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,008
If you want something,
you order, you take it out.

729
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,303
But it's empty.
The counter's empty.

730
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,972
All reserved, all day.
You don't sit down.

731
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,189
Y'all come back now, you hear?

732
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,858
You don't need
to talk to them like that.

733
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,819
You should go, too.

734
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,365
And don't come back.
This is a family restaurant.

735
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:54,378
<i>So come back to my arms</i>

736
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,675
<i>And show me how wrong I can be</i>

737
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,424
I have no one.

738
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,431
And you are the only person
that I can talk to.

739
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,522
Now, whatever this thing is...

740
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,812
you need it.

741
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:13,851
So...

742
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,981
you just tell me what to do.

743
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:25,952
<i>So come back to my arms</i>

744
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:29,034
<i>And show me</i>

745
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:35,546
<i>How wrong I can be</i>

746
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,422
- "All hope fades."
- "As the spring recedes."

747
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:39,632
Let's go.

748
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:45,054
Moscow will not
support your plan.

749
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:46,517
Why?

750
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,353
Too risky.

751
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:51,306
Too soon.

752
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,515
What?!

753
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,774
We only have two choices, Dimitri.

754
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:57,854
One...

755
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:01,734
you delay the procedure,

756
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,159
one week, minimum.

757
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,656
It's happening tomorrow.

758
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:06,533
Which...

759
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:08,414
brings us

760
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:09,495
to option two.

761
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,705
Israeli "Popper".

762
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,959
You set it next to a fuse box,

763
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,675
it will buy you five to
ten minutes in the dark.

764
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:26,887
No cameras, no containment doors.

765
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:29,894
Then...

766
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:35,688
you inject it with this.

767
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:38,399
Inject it.

768
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,776
Kill it.

769
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,111
Destroy it.

770
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:45,902
Are you feeling okay?

771
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,369
I came to this country

772
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,502
to learn what I could

773
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:57,714
as a patriot, yes...

774
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,041
but also as a scientist.

775
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,425
There is still so much we can learn.

776
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:08,258
We don't need to learn.

777
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,222
We need Americans

778
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,895
not to learn.

779
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,776
<i>There's a summer place</i>

780
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:30,660
<i>Where it may rain or storm</i>

781
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:34,834
<i>Yet I'm safe and warm</i>

782
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,414
Cadillac DeVille.
Best car ever made.

783
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:43,460
V8, 390 CID, clean and crisp
like a fresh dollar bill.

784
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,003
I'm just idling around.

785
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,546
And I'm just talking.

786
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,306
AM radio, air conditioner,

787
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:52,264
power windows, power brakes,
power steering, power seats.

788
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:54,350
All deluxe interior appointment choices,

789
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,681
143 options.

790
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:57,599
Now, this...

791
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,359
- is the Taj Mahal on wheels.
- Hmm.

792
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:01,861
I'm not sure about the green.

793
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,362
It's not green, my friend. Teal.

794
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,524
- Well, teal looks green to me.
- But it isn't, see?

795
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,533
It's a limited edition,
12 coats of paint,

796
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:08,989
polished by hand,

797
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,036
all authentic chrome detailing.

798
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,119
Four out of five successful men
in America drive a Cadillac.

799
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:15,283
Is that a fact?

800
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:16,542
This here is the future.

801
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,829
And you strike me as a man
who is headed there.

802
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,713
- Where?
- Why, the future.

803
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:23,876
You're the man of the future.
You belong in this car.

804
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:44,149
- Hello!
- Hi!

805
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:19,768
Wow!

806
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:22,184
Sir, that is a...
that is a beautiful car!

807
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,522
It's a...

808
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:24,853
What can I say?

809
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,358
You gotta feel good driving that, huh?

810
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:29,900
And what a wonderful
shade of green, huh?

811
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:32,740
Teal.

812
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,755
Tomorrow, I'll make a mean meatloaf.

813
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:44,755
Mmm-hmm.

814
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:46,336
Just for you, extra raisins.

815
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:15,866
So, at 5:00 a. m., I drive my car
down the loading ramp.

816
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,031
And the shifts are changing,
and I have...

817
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,995
How much time do I have?

818
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,750
Five minutes? I'll remember.

819
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,287
5:00 a. m., five minutes.
Five-five, five-five.

820
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,672
So, you're going
to move the cameras, right?

821
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:29,004
And I'm gonna be
synchronizing our watches,

822
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,210
just like they do in the movies.

823
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,217
Oh, God! I'm so proud of you.

824
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,723
God! You're not afraid!

825
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:39,469
You are? Very?

826
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,013
Don't tell me that.
I'm terrified.

827
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:49,108
I think this is some of my best work.

828
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:51,318
"Michael Parker." I think
it's a good, trustworthy name.

829
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,481
It's a little butch.

830
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,491
Yes, age 51.

831
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,777
54?

832
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,448
You don't have to be rude.

833
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:03,288
57.

834
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,870
If I put the hair on, I can pull it off.

835
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,001
I can wear this, or I have...

836
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,633
Thor, go. Off, off, off! Go!

837
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:11,792
Or I have this.

838
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,927
Now this, I think it says "working man."

839
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,555
But this, now this says...

840
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:19,642
This says with the butterscotch tie...

841
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:23,270
This says "casual, but still stylish."

842
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,274
So, you like this?
I agree, I agree.

843
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,650
I think we're ready.

844
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,339
Mr. Strickland!

845
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:53,843
Sally, could you call Miss Esposito
to clean up a spill?

846
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,391
You know,
I can't figure it out myself.

847
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,474
You're not much to look at,
but... go figure.

848
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:06,560
I keep thinking about you.

849
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,567
When you say you're mute,
are you entirely silent,

850
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,568
or do you squawk a little?

851
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,364
Some mutes squawk.
Not pretty, but...

852
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:16,820
Hmm?

853
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,363
I just want you to know...

854
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,082
I don't mind those scars.

855
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:27,869
I don't mind
that you can't speak, either.

856
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,333
When you come right down to it...

857
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,673
I like it.

858
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,088
A lot.

859
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,008
It kind of gets me going.

860
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,222
I bet I can make you squawk a little.

861
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,347
Hey, honey. You okay?

862
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,426
Hurry up.
I wanna be home early.

863
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,015
My feet are killing me.

864
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,672
We need to delay the procedure.

865
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,338
Knock before you enter my office.

866
00:59:58,512 --> 00:59:59,593
This is urgent!

867
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,344
Go back out, knock,
then I'll let you in and we'll talk.

868
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:05,850
That's the protocol.
Follow the protocol.

869
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:13,315
Come in.

870
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:15,021
Would you get the door for me, please?

871
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:22,992
See? That's the way.
Now, we talk.

872
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,652
I need more time.

873
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,662
Don't let the fact
that you feel like a loser

874
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:28,994
now that you've let your
competitive tendencies...

875
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:33,002
I'm not competitive! I don't want
an intricate, beautiful thing destroyed!

876
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,541
This thing dies,

877
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:41,757
you learn, I leave, out of here.

878
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:43,717
I settle down.

879
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,473
My family settles down, somewhere nice.

880
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,225
<i>A real city.</i>

881
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,809
This creature is intelligent,

882
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,728
capable of language,

883
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:01,192
of understanding emotions.

884
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:04,196
So are the Soviets, the Gooks.

885
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,406
And we still kill them, don't we?

886
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:09,747
The bottom line is,
this isn't a petting zoo,

887
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,705
and I don't wanna be in this shit hole
any longer than need be.

888
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,245
Do you?

889
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:19,295
Bob. Do you?

890
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:22,593
No, I don't.

891
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,691
Hey, what are you waiting for?

892
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,282
Have you seen Elisa?

893
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:50,037
Come on, Zelda!

894
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:05,879
Did you move
the camera on the loading dock?

895
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:07,547
Is that where you're taking him?

896
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,010
Through the service tunnels?

897
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:10,800
That's very smart.

898
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:13,060
Who do you work for?

899
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,624
His water must be kept
at five to eight percent salinity.

900
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,126
Table salt will do.

901
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:41,214
Mix one of these in his water
every three days.

902
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,925
Raw protein diet is a must.

903
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,927
In five minutes,

904
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:48,338
<i>I'll meet you at the loading dock.</i>

905
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:51,508
<i>The lights will go out,
so be prepared.</i>

906
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,698
Mr. Strickland, sir?

907
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,159
Twelve hours
to the vivisection of the asset.

908
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,575
And I need your signature here, please.

909
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:24,332
<i>...this sudden, clandestine decision</i>

910
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:27,968
<i>to station strategic weapons for
the first time outside of Soviet soil...</i>

911
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,508
Hold it right there.

912
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,470
<i>...an unjustified change
in the status quo</i>

913
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,684
<i>which cannot be accepted
by this country...</i>

914
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,452
"Michael Parker." Is that you?

915
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,867
My whole life.

916
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:14,257
Are you out of your mind?

917
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,850
Don't do this, Elisa.
Don't do this!

918
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,528
What's that?
What's that vehicle?

919
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:30,986
Gosh, sir, I'm not sure.
It's a laundry van?

920
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,321
But it's not scheduled.

921
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,744
<i>And finally,</i>

922
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:43,123
<i>I call upon Chairman Khrushchev
to halt and eliminate</i>

923
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:48,420
<i>this clandestine, reckless,
and provocative threat to world peace</i>

924
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,968
<i>and to stable relations
between our two nations.</i>

925
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:57,974
Sir?

926
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,761
- Meet me at the loading dock.
- Sir!

927
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,346
- Sir, what do you need me to do?
- Get backup.

928
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:07,522
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

929
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,231
Oh, God. I'm not good at this.

930
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,147
Out of the vehicle, now.
I will not say it again.

931
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,111
- Oh, God. Please don't shoot me!
- Get out!

932
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:14,274
Oh, God.
Don't shoot me. Please.

933
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,711
What are you waiting for?
We're out of time!

934
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:29,335
Get out now!

935
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,210
You have to go. Hurry!

936
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,846
Oh, woman,
we're gonna burn in hell.

937
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:36,888
Come on, push.

938
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,299
Push! Push!

939
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,387
I swear, I'm not doing this on purpose!

940
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:44,556
Mechanical objects and I
just don't get along!

941
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,601
What the...

942
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,021
She's waiting for you at the dock.
Go! Now!

943
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,413
Who's that man?
I think he just killed someone.

944
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,675
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

945
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,517
Are we ready?
Are we ready?

946
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:38,742
He's so beautiful.

947
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:48,368
Did I do that?

948
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,418
I'm just not good at this.

949
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,175
Move! Move!

950
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,385
Come on. No.

951
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,142
No!

952
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,616
Salt? What are you talking about, salt?

953
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:12,210
Elisa!

954
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:03,920
There.

955
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:22,815
Israeli Popper.

956
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:26,948
You can smell the magnesium.

957
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:29,909
Russians hate the Jews,

958
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,116
but they can't get enough
of their gadgets.

959
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:35,331
How'd they get in here?

960
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:38,248
Forged ID, painted plates,
and so on and so forth.

961
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:41,838
And they moved the main
video camera on the dock, sir.

962
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,047
Well, no one has to know.

963
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,712
We got 24 hours
before I bounce it up.

964
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,630
I called it in.

965
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:47,798
You called it in?

966
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:49,386
The moment it happened, I...

967
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:51,680
Mr. Strickland, sir.

968
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:54,517
What is it, Sally?

969
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:56,728
Sir, General Hoyt is on the phone.

970
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:59,814
<i>That thing was
our space dog, Strickland.</i>

971
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:03,025
<i>- You know that.
- Sir, I'm getting it back.</i>

972
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,692
I can't be
in a negative frame of mind, sir.

973
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,155
<i>So, you're feeling good?</i>

974
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:10,412
Feeling strong.
Getting it back.

975
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:13,324
<i>You can get it done.
You're gonna get it done.</i>

976
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:15,834
<i>For me, son. For me.</i>

977
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,773
<i>Oh Shenandoah</i>

978
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:49,577
<i>I long to hear you</i>

979
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:53,455
<i>Always</i>

980
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:59,586
That's when you're
planning on releasing him?

981
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:01,247
On the 10th?

982
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,462
So, what if the rains are late?

983
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:05,967
What happens with the canal?

984
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:07,386
It will rain.

985
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,761
All right.

986
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,184
What's that?

987
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,688
Let me see it.
Is that for me?

988
01:11:56,854 --> 01:12:00,347
Yeah, that's good.
Keep that up.

989
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:03,643
Looking like you don't know anything.

990
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:07,980
Lord help me if they ask me if I do.

991
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:09,443
I'm not a good liar.

992
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:10,824
Except to Brewster.

993
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,406
It takes a lot of lies
to keep a marriage going.

994
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,070
<i>All personnel,</i>

995
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,372
<i>prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

996
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:20,285
Lord! What in the...

997
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:23,162
<i>Attention. All personnel,</i>

998
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:25,498
<i>prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

999
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,334
You done got us in a world of trouble.

1000
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:31,219
My opinion, we're looking
at a highly trained group, sir.

1001
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:33,381
I'm thinking, conceivably, sir,

1002
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,591
Special Forces, or so on and so forth.

1003
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,259
Red Army Special Forces?

1004
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:38,517
Conceivably.

1005
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:42,853
I mean, they're highly trained,
well-financed, an elite group.

1006
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:45,813
Highly efficient, ruthless,
clockwork precision.

1007
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:47,728
Infiltration took less
than five minutes, sir.

1008
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:51,319
My conservative estimate is that this
was a strike force of at least 10 men.

1009
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,045
<i>My master sends this dress.</i>

1010
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:08,749
Have you always been alone?

1011
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,092
Did you ever have someone?

1012
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,846
Do you know what happened to you?
Do you?

1013
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,977
Because I don't. I don't know
what happened to me.

1014
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:23,730
I don't know.

1015
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,689
I look in the mirror and the only thing
that I recognize are these eyes...

1016
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:30,775
in this old man's face.

1017
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:39,405
You know, sometimes I think I was either
born too early or too late for my life.

1018
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,960
Maybe we're both just relics.

1019
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:49,168
<i>Security measures
have been increased to maximum levels.</i>

1020
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:52,835
<i>Prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

1021
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:57,380
<i>Attention.</i>

1022
01:13:57,516 --> 01:14:00,475
<i>Security measures have been
increased to maximum levels.</i>

1023
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:02,678
Sir, I've got them.

1024
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,222
Zelda, Elisa. All right.

1025
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:09,188
Here we go.

1026
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,320
Mmm-hmm.

1027
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,815
Looks like you two punched out
before the incident.

1028
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:15,982
Still.

1029
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,195
If you know something
about what transpired here,

1030
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:23,491
it's your obligation
to report any detail,

1031
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:26,668
no matter how small
or trivial it may seem.

1032
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,920
"Trivial" means unimportant.

1033
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:32,709
I didn't see nothing
out of the ordinary, no.

1034
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,251
Or trivial.

1035
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:35,964
See, my feet were hurting...

1036
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:37,345
What about you?

1037
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,341
She didn't see anything.

1038
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,261
Hmm.

1039
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,232
Hoffstetler, Dr. Hoffstetler.

1040
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,568
Did either of you see him
coming in or out of the lab?

1041
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:57,904
He works there, doesn't he?

1042
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:02,242
I mean in a different way,
doing something different.

1043
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,661
Something trivial?

1044
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:07,538
No, sir.

1045
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,970
What am I doing,
interviewing the fucking help?

1046
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,056
The shit cleaners.

1047
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:31,899
The piss wipers.

1048
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:37,530
You two, go ahead. Leave.

1049
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:46,122
All right, you're clear.
So, back to work. Go on.

1050
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:49,455
What'd you say to me?

1051
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:52,121
F

1052
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:53,129
U

1053
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:53,755
C

1054
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:54,171
K

1055
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:55,422
What is she saying?

1056
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:56,083
Y

1057
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:56,712
O

1058
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:57,462
U

1059
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:58,464
I didn't catch it.

1060
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:01,046
What is she saying?

1061
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,556
She... she is saying thank you.

1062
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:15,185
Next!

1063
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:17,562
<i>Order them to turn the platform.</i>

1064
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:36,840
<i>I didn't see you
last night or the night before.</i>

1065
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,841
<i>I'm sorry, Ed,
but now that I'm spending</i>

1066
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:39,918
<i>all day long in the office,</i>

1067
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,634
<i>Carol feels that I should spend
my evenings with her.</i>

1068
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,140
<i>Well, if you spend
the evenings with her,</i>

1069
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:46,558
<i>when will I see you?</i>

1070
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,944
<i>There's only one thing left to do.</i>

1071
01:16:58,114 --> 01:16:59,400
<i>Volunteer.</i>

1072
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,013
No! No, no, no, no, no!

1073
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:35,394
<i>Hey, Charley, what're you doing,
putting me on?</i>

1074
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:55,494
I wanna get home early.

1075
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:59,585
Brewster's been in a bad mood lately.

1076
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:03,425
Holy Jesus!

1077
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:04,882
What are you doin'
standing in the shadows

1078
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:05,962
of the women's locker room?

1079
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,052
They may be watching me,
and there are no cameras here.

1080
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:09,215
For good reason.

1081
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:11,180
What if you caught us
at an inconvenient moment?

1082
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,140
I need to know that he's all right.

1083
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:14,976
- He is.
- When will you release him?

1084
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:16,598
Soon.

1085
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,400
When the rain fills the canal
that flows to the sea.

1086
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:24,030
If you need anything.

1087
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,736
Release him. Soon.

1088
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:31,162
What did she say?

1089
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:34,166
She said you're a good man,
Dr. Hoffstetler.

1090
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:38,711
My name is Dimitri.

1091
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:43,583
Honored to meet you.

1092
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,469
Hey, dummy!
Phone call for you.

1093
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,256
It's urgent.

1094
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,346
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

1095
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:57,764
You're hurt!
Believe me. I'm fine.

1096
01:18:58,317 --> 01:18:59,524
You're bleeding.

1097
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,772
He ate Pandora. Wasn't his fault.

1098
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:05,314
He's a wild creature.
We can't ask him to be anything else.

1099
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:06,572
Elisa, go find him.

1100
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:08,490
Go. Go.

1101
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,360
Go!

1102
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:13,364
You're lucky.

1103
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:16,934
Ow.

1104
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,931
I stayed awake as long as I could.

1105
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:22,940
You know, I'm not even mad anymore.

1106
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,313
Is he all right? You sure?

1107
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:29,739
Where you going?

1108
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:30,898
No, no.

1109
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:33,067
Okay, don't... No, no.

1110
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,578
Don't play with the kitties.
No, no.

1111
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:37,489
Don't play with the kitties.

1112
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,373
I'm not... I'm not angry.

1113
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:45,709
Oh, my!

1114
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:54,964
You did that, but it's okay.

1115
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:57,221
Ooh. I don't think that's sanitary.

1116
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:02,604
Enough.

1117
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:07,526
Oh, God.

1118
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:14,484
Interesting guy.

1119
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:19,451
<i>All personnel prepare to present</i>

1120
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,578
<i>your identity and clearance cards.</i>

1121
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:23,584
You wanted to see me?

1122
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:29,925
How's it going? The investigation?

1123
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:31,551
Well, we have a promising lead.

1124
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:33,594
Really?

1125
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,348
That's good to hear.

1126
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,347
You joined us in Galveston,

1127
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:42,558
- but where were you before, Hoffstetler?
- Doctor.

1128
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:45,724
- Excuse me?
- Doctor Hoffstetler.

1129
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:49,148
Protocol.

1130
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:53,690
- Wisconsin, Madison.
- Oh that's right.

1131
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:55,654
You gave up a tenure track position,
didn't you?

1132
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:59,905
Gave it all up for us.

1133
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:04,621
I suppose...

1134
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:06,247
you'll be getting ready
to leave us now then, huh?

1135
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,755
Only if the creature isn't found.

1136
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:15,553
Well, what do you think?
You think we will find it?

1137
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:17,884
Well, you said you had a lead.

1138
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,516
I do.

1139
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:02,600
<i>Oh, Mahlon, this is all wrong.</i>

1140
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:05,603
<i>I was at peace until I met you.</i>

1141
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:11,233
<i>Perhaps it would be best
if I don't see you again.</i>

1142
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:13,440
<i>Asks if you have
any words to send him.</i>

1143
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:15,530
<i>Only peace.</i>

1144
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:18,236
<i>That's all?</i>

1145
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:21,323
<i>That is much.</i>

1146
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:33,498
<i>I'm not going to any celebration.</i>

1147
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:12,305
Why you smiling, hon?

1148
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:15,808
Stop looking like that.

1149
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,691
What happened?

1150
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:24,574
Why?

1151
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:27,570
How?

1152
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:29,322
How?

1153
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:33,330
Does he have a...?

1154
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:40,125
Mm-hmm.

1155
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:43,094
Mm-hmm.

1156
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,477
Oh!

1157
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:54,806
Never trust a man.

1158
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,270
Even when he looks flat down there.

1159
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,203
Please, come in.

1160
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:16,161
Your extraction papers...

1161
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:18,125
...will be ready soon.

1162
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:22,668
First, I have a question for you.

1163
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:25,841
Yes? Go ahead.

1164
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:28,673
Would you like some...

1165
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:30,804
butter cake?

1166
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,051
Yes, please.

1167
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:39,187
The asset...

1168
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:40,563
after you injected it,

1169
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:42,482
what did you do with the corpse?

1170
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:45,239
I am a little curious.

1171
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:50,653
I performed an autopsy-

1172
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,748
Unenlightening.

1173
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:57,455
As Lenin said,

1174
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:01,710
There is no profit in last week's fish.

1175
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:05,585
Lenin

1176
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:07,303
said that?

1177
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,098
Lenin!

1178
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:18,264
Hmm.

1179
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:19,473
Great cake!

1180
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:22,101
Do you have any milk?

1181
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:28,357
Perhaps...

1182
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:32,486
Perhaps...

1183
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:38,291
Perhaps...

1184
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:41,625
...you're misremembering.

1185
01:27:45,844 --> 01:27:47,380
Wait for our call.

1186
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:51,467
Shouldn't be much longer.

1187
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:00,981
<i>You rang?</i>

1188
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:05,569
<i>Oh, hi, Maynard.
I just signed up for anthropology.</i>

1189
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:08,652
<i>We're gonna hold class in the Amazon
jungle in South America.</i>

1190
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:09,941
<i>South America?
Ooh, man, Dobe.</i>

1191
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:11,575
<i>You're gonna have to get up early
in the morning.</i>

1192
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:12,735
<i>That's a long hike.</i>

1193
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:14,404
<i>No, Maynard,
we're gonna stay down there.</i>

1194
01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:15,488
<i>We are?</i>

1195
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:17,073
<i>No, you're not coming along.</i>

1196
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:20,493
This is a gelatin parfait.

1197
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,620
You're gonna love it.

1198
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:24,209
<i>Dad, can we watch Bonanza?</i>

1199
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:26,248
<i>Bonanza is much too violent.</i>

1200
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:29,965
You know what I was thinking today?
We get the kids a P-U-P-P-Y.

1201
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:49,172
You

1202
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:50,716
and me

1203
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:52,843
together.

1204
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:31,420
Let's go. Come on.

1205
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:33,380
Let's get out of here.

1206
01:31:19,683 --> 01:31:23,176
What is going on?
I've got water pouring into my theater!

1207
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:25,640
I have four paying customers!
I've got to order refunds.

1208
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:26,975
It's probably a pipe.
I'll take care of it.

1209
01:31:27,148 --> 01:31:28,980
- You don't fix it, no more rent!
- I will fix it.

1210
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:48,702
Elisa?

1211
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:51,712
Dear God. Elisa!

1212
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:52,997
Elisa?

1213
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,327
I'm toweling my hair!

1214
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:26,614
It's my hair.

1215
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:29,117
I just...

1216
01:32:29,794 --> 01:32:31,330
Oh! Look at my arm.

1217
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,378
The wound,
it's like it was never there.

1218
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:35,081
Look at that.

1219
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:38,171
Now you said that, you know,
he was worshiped like a god.

1220
01:32:38,344 --> 01:32:40,051
Now, is he a god?
I don't know if he's a god.

1221
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:42,087
I mean, he ate a cat, so I don't know.

1222
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:45,141
I don't know, but, I mean,
we have to keep him around awhile.

1223
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:48,432
Little while.

1224
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:08,330
Hello?

1225
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,040
Extraction...

1226
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:11,750
...is ready.

1227
01:33:11,961 --> 01:33:13,077
<i>Same place,</i>

1228
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:15,917
in forty-eight hours.

1229
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:19,208
Forty-eight hours?

1230
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:22,128
<i>Forty-eight hours.</i>

1231
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:50,591
<i>Your water, sir.</i>

1232
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:54,804
- And, sir, General Hoyt...
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1233
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:57,222
Tell him I'm not here.
Tell him I'll call him back.

1234
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:58,516
Don't put him through.

1235
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:01,436
No, sir.
He... he's in your office.

1236
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,783
At this point,
our only concern is the asset.

1237
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:08,942
Do you have it?

1238
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,782
Still in the wind, sir.

1239
01:35:11,664 --> 01:35:12,700
Well, that won't do.

1240
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:15,449
Yes, sir, I know.

1241
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:19,795
You've known me how long, sir?

1242
01:35:19,964 --> 01:35:22,456
Thirteen years.
Battle of Pusan.

1243
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:23,875
Yes, sir.

1244
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:27,636
A man is faithful,
loyal, efficient all his life.

1245
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:33,301
All of it. And he is... useful.
And he expects...

1246
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:37,688
He has certain expectations in return.

1247
01:35:39,901 --> 01:35:41,893
And then, he fails once.

1248
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,060
Only once.

1249
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:44,570
What does that make him?

1250
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,571
Does that make him a failure?

1251
01:35:50,203 --> 01:35:52,365
When is a man done, sir?

1252
01:35:52,455 --> 01:35:54,617
Proving himself?

1253
01:35:54,707 --> 01:35:55,788
A good man?

1254
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:58,621
A decent man?

1255
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:03,254
"Decent"?

1256
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:12,132
A man has the decency not to fuck up.

1257
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:13,719
Now that's one thing.

1258
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:15,350
That's real decent of him.

1259
01:36:16,312 --> 01:36:18,599
But the other kind of decency?

1260
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:20,139
It doesn't really matter.

1261
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:23,267
We sell it, but it's an export.

1262
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:25,565
We sell it because we don't use it.

1263
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:32,615
36 hours from now,
this entire episode will be over.

1264
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:35,696
And so will you.

1265
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:41,415
Our universe will have a hole in it
with your outline.

1266
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:44,288
And you will have moved on

1267
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:47,299
to an alternate universe.

1268
01:36:48,594 --> 01:36:50,301
A universe of shit.

1269
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:54,924
You'll be lost to civilization.

1270
01:36:57,312 --> 01:37:00,020
And you will be unborn.

1271
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:02,515
Unmade.

1272
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:05,859
And undone.

1273
01:37:12,744 --> 01:37:15,487
So go get some real decency, son.

1274
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:18,656
And unfuck this mess.

1275
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:56,197
36 hours.

1276
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:58,488
36 hours. Well, shit.

1277
01:37:58,664 --> 01:38:00,030
You deliver. You deliver,
that's what you do.

1278
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:02,081
You deliver! Right? Right?!

1279
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:28,317
<i>I can hear you now</i>

1280
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:36,817
<i>You know I love you, dear</i>

1281
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:40,571
Egg.

1282
01:38:40,998 --> 01:38:44,162
<i>Your voice is like music to my ears</i>

1283
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:47,828
<i>When I close my eyes you seem so near</i>

1284
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:50,292
You'll...

1285
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:53,421
never...

1286
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:56,845
know...

1287
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:01,433
<i>I think about you the live-long day</i>

1288
01:39:04,856 --> 01:39:08,440
<i>You ask me if I'm lonely</i>

1289
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:11,727
<i>Then I have only this</i>

1290
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:14,438
<i>To say</i>

1291
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,487
You'll...

1292
01:39:18,578 --> 01:39:21,161
never know...

1293
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:25,415
just how much...

1294
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:28,873
I...

1295
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:31,706
<i>Love you</i>

1296
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:36,502
<i>You'll</i>

1297
01:39:36,596 --> 01:39:38,758
<i>Never know</i>

1298
01:39:38,931 --> 01:39:41,344
<i>Just how much...</i>

1299
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:44,347
<i>I care</i>

1300
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:53,478
<i>And if I try</i>

1301
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:56,112
<i>I still couldn't hide</i>

1302
01:39:56,282 --> 01:39:58,740
<i>My love</i>

1303
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:01,193
<i>For you</i>

1304
01:40:01,913 --> 01:40:03,996
<i>You ought to know</i>

1305
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:08,205
<i>For Heaven told me so</i>

1306
01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:19,719
<i>You went away</i>

1307
01:40:19,889 --> 01:40:24,509
<i>And my heart went with you</i>

1308
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:28,887
<i>I speak your name</i>

1309
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:32,975
<i>In my every prayer</i>

1310
01:40:35,947 --> 01:40:40,066
<i>If there is some other way</i>

1311
01:40:40,243 --> 01:40:43,407
<i>To prove that I love you</i>

1312
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:48,119
<i>I swear I don't know how</i>

1313
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:51,493
<i>You'll never know</i>

1314
01:40:51,671 --> 01:40:56,666
<i>If you don't know now</i>

1315
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:19,696
Elisa...

1316
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:23,738
What is it, honey?

1317
01:41:50,396 --> 01:41:52,012
This isn't good.

1318
01:41:54,734 --> 01:41:56,896
I'm gonna call Dr. Hoffstetler.

1319
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:00,987
We gotta release him tonight, honey.

1320
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:03,114
I'll come back and help you.

1321
01:42:27,183 --> 01:42:28,515
He's coming out.

1322
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:36,306
Ah, fuck.

1323
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:45,153
Sir, if you don't mind me saying,
you... you don't look so well.

1324
01:42:45,326 --> 01:42:46,533
Shut up.

1325
01:42:48,871 --> 01:42:52,239
Can you smell that?
I mean... I think it's your fingers.

1326
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:54,620
- They're... black.
- Mm. Mm.

1327
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:01,543
There he is.

1328
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:03,674
Dr. Fucking Shitbird.

1329
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:05,426
Oh, there's no call for cursing, sir.

1330
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,433
Get out of the car.
I'm taking it.

1331
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:14,431
This is my car.

1332
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:15,812
Get the fuck out.

1333
01:43:15,981 --> 01:43:17,438
Out of my car?

1334
01:43:18,234 --> 01:43:20,100
Did I stutter?

1335
01:44:02,862 --> 01:44:07,277
It's raining like hell, isn't it?

1336
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:13,369
No password today?

1337
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:24,956
No - no - comrade -

1338
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:26,624
No - no -

1339
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:28,084
No, please!

1340
01:44:52,745 --> 01:44:53,906
Strickland! Thank God!

1341
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:56,366
You were speaking Russian...

1342
01:44:56,457 --> 01:44:57,538
Bob.

1343
01:45:09,637 --> 01:45:10,627
What's your name?

1344
01:45:10,805 --> 01:45:13,297
- Hoffstetler.
- No, no. Don't lie.

1345
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:14,964
You don't need to.

1346
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:17,847
You took a bullet to the gut.

1347
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:19,056
You're dead.

1348
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:22,974
I need the names, ranks and location
of the entire strike team.

1349
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:24,892
"Strike team"?

1350
01:45:25,069 --> 01:45:27,186
The ones who took the asset!

1351
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:39,949
This candy, it's cheap candy,
but I love it.

1352
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:41,957
Ever since I was a kid.

1353
01:45:42,962 --> 01:45:45,796
Now some folks favor
more sophisticated snacks,

1354
01:45:45,965 --> 01:45:49,174
nougat center
and all that foo-foo shit.

1355
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:51,422
But not me, Bob!

1356
01:45:52,388 --> 01:45:53,674
This is it for me.

1357
01:45:56,642 --> 01:46:00,306
Now sometimes if I'm feeling anxious,
I just bite right into it.

1358
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:01,970
But mostly,

1359
01:46:02,857 --> 01:46:04,268
I take my time.

1360
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:06,524
I make it last.

1361
01:46:11,657 --> 01:46:15,401
Names, ranks,
and location of the strike team.

1362
01:46:19,123 --> 01:46:21,206
Names! Ranks! Now!

1363
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:27,253
No names.

1364
01:46:28,757 --> 01:46:30,123
No ranks.

1365
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:32,334
They...

1366
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:34,927
They just clean.

1367
01:46:46,483 --> 01:46:48,145
All right, Brewster,
I'm gonna fix your dinner,

1368
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:51,232
and then I'm gonna run out
for a little while and help a friend.

1369
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:53,363
Help with what?

1370
01:46:53,532 --> 01:46:54,943
Help a friend.

1371
01:46:57,494 --> 01:46:58,780
Zelda...

1372
01:46:58,871 --> 01:46:59,987
the door.

1373
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:06,538
Well, you could help me
and answer the door, Brewster.

1374
01:47:06,712 --> 01:47:08,920
You're sitting right here
just ten feet away from it!

1375
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:10,751
My back's aching me, woman.
Now, move!

1376
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:13,008
Your back, your back?
Always your back!

1377
01:47:16,305 --> 01:47:17,512
Mr. Strickland.

1378
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:20,014
What are you doing here?

1379
01:47:20,184 --> 01:47:21,425
Who's that man, Zelda?

1380
01:47:21,602 --> 01:47:22,683
Where is it?

1381
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:24,264
- What are you talking about?
- Where did you take it?

1382
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:26,054
- What are you talking about?
- Zelda!

1383
01:47:28,525 --> 01:47:31,359
The thing... in the lab.

1384
01:47:32,738 --> 01:47:33,728
Where is it?

1385
01:47:33,906 --> 01:47:35,818
- Listen, fella...
- Sit down!

1386
01:47:45,334 --> 01:47:46,324
I'm sorry, sir.

1387
01:47:46,502 --> 01:47:48,789
If I knew anything,
I would surely tell you.

1388
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:55,299
That story about Samson.

1389
01:47:56,512 --> 01:47:58,504
I never told you how it ends.

1390
01:47:58,681 --> 01:48:03,142
After the Philistines
torture him and blind him...

1391
01:48:04,687 --> 01:48:07,680
Samson asks God
for the strength he needs.

1392
01:48:09,566 --> 01:48:11,899
And at the last minute, he is spared.

1393
01:48:12,695 --> 01:48:17,235
And the Lord gives him
his strength back,

1394
01:48:17,408 --> 01:48:18,615
one last time.

1395
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:23,820
And he holds...

1396
01:48:24,915 --> 01:48:29,535
the columns of the temple
with his powerful arms,

1397
01:48:29,712 --> 01:48:32,329
and he crushes them.

1398
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:47,677
And he brings the whole building
down on the Philistines.

1399
01:48:53,235 --> 01:48:54,692
He dies,

1400
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:58,981
but he gets every single
one of those motherfuckers.

1401
01:48:59,742 --> 01:49:00,949
That is his will!

1402
01:49:05,164 --> 01:49:09,625
Now, do you know what that
particular story means...

1403
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:12,160
for us, Delilah?

1404
01:49:13,422 --> 01:49:15,584
It means if you know something
you're not telling me,

1405
01:49:15,758 --> 01:49:17,124
you're gonna tell me

1406
01:49:17,718 --> 01:49:21,678
either before or after

1407
01:49:21,847 --> 01:49:24,089
I bring this particular temple...

1408
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:28,260
down upon our heads.

1409
01:49:29,396 --> 01:49:32,980
Gal stole that thing
right out the lab, whatever it is.

1410
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:34,732
Mute girl took it.

1411
01:49:35,611 --> 01:49:38,354
I heard my wife talking
on the phone about it.

1412
01:49:42,993 --> 01:49:46,862
Thank you very much, Mr. Fuller,
for your assistance.

1413
01:49:58,008 --> 01:49:59,624
What have you done?

1414
01:49:59,802 --> 01:50:00,633
Zelda.

1415
01:50:00,803 --> 01:50:01,793
I gotta warn her.

1416
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:03,427
He's going after her.

1417
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:05,259
You will do no such thing, woman.

1418
01:50:05,849 --> 01:50:06,839
Why are you worrying about her?

1419
01:50:07,017 --> 01:50:08,349
She broke the law.

1420
01:50:08,519 --> 01:50:10,476
Shut up, Brewster!
You shut up!

1421
01:50:11,355 --> 01:50:13,221
Years, you don't talk...

1422
01:50:14,691 --> 01:50:16,933
and now you can't shut your mouth!

1423
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:18,776
Damn you, Brewster.

1424
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:23,155
You wouldn't understand.

1425
01:50:23,325 --> 01:50:26,693
Couldn't understand,
not if you tried your whole life.

1426
01:50:27,663 --> 01:50:29,655
<i>- Hello?
- Giles, is that you?</i>

1427
01:50:29,832 --> 01:50:31,573
<i>- Yes.
- Okay. Put Elisa on the phone.</i>

1428
01:50:32,334 --> 01:50:33,324
It's Zelda.

1429
01:50:35,212 --> 01:50:37,955
Elisa, honey, make a sound
on the phone if you can hear.

1430
01:50:39,258 --> 01:50:40,248
<i>Okay, good.</i>

1431
01:50:41,093 --> 01:50:42,300
He's coming for you.

1432
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:44,927
<i>You gotta go now,
and you gotta take that thing with you.</i>

1433
01:50:45,097 --> 01:50:46,213
What? Elisa?

1434
01:50:54,857 --> 01:50:57,349
Hey, mister!
Learn how to drive!

1435
01:51:27,389 --> 01:51:28,630
Damn it.

1436
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:41,851
We have to go.

1437
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:45,863
Where are you?

1438
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:48,024
Where the fuck are you?

1439
01:52:59,106 --> 01:53:00,813
You

1440
01:53:01,692 --> 01:53:03,183
and me

1441
01:53:04,111 --> 01:53:05,318
Together

1442
01:53:06,071 --> 01:53:07,653
No - without me.

1443
01:53:08,490 --> 01:53:09,947
Without me.

1444
01:54:11,178 --> 01:54:12,919
I do not fail.

1445
01:54:14,723 --> 01:54:16,009
I deliver.

1446
01:54:21,188 --> 01:54:22,349
Elisa!

1447
01:54:23,607 --> 01:54:25,189
Elisa.

1448
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:34,940
No.

1449
01:55:23,166 --> 01:55:24,282
Fuck.

1450
01:55:25,544 --> 01:55:27,080
You are a god.

1451
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:02,787
Look, man on the ground.

1452
01:56:03,832 --> 01:56:05,118
Watch him.

1453
01:56:12,174 --> 01:56:14,336
You there! Call an ambulance!

1454
01:57:34,339 --> 01:57:38,128
<i>If I told you about her,
what would I say?</i>

1455
01:57:38,301 --> 01:57:41,044
<i>That they lived happily ever after?</i>

1456
01:57:41,221 --> 01:57:42,962
<i>I believe they did.</i>

1457
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:47,474
<i>That they were in love,
that they remained in love?</i>

1458
01:57:47,644 --> 01:57:49,636
<i>I'm sure that's true.</i>

1459
01:57:50,605 --> 01:57:52,437
<i>But when I think of her,</i>

1460
01:57:53,358 --> 01:57:54,769
<i>of Elisa...</i>

1461
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:58,648
<i>the only thing that comes
to mind is a poem</i>

1462
01:57:58,822 --> 01:58:02,782
<i>whispered by someone in love,
hundreds of years ago.</i>

1463
01:58:03,743 --> 01:58:06,451
<i>"Unable to perceive the shape of you</i>

1464
01:58:07,581 --> 01:58:10,198
<i>"I find you all around me</i>

1465
01:58:10,375 --> 01:58:13,618
<i>"Your presence fills my eyes
with your love</i>

1466
01:58:14,629 --> 01:58:16,837
<i>"It humbles my heart</i>

1467
01:58:17,007 --> 01:58:18,999
<i>"For you are everywhere"</i>

1468
01:58:56,963 --> 01:59:00,001
<i>You'll never know</i>

1469
01:59:00,091 --> 01:59:05,132
<i>Just how much I miss you</i>

1470
01:59:09,476 --> 01:59:15,848
<i>You'll never know just how much I care</i>

1471
01:59:21,655 --> 01:59:25,148
<i>And if I tried</i>

1472
01:59:25,283 --> 01:59:31,450
<i>I still couldn't hide my love for you</i>

1473
01:59:34,209 --> 01:59:37,202
<i>You ought to know</i>

1474
01:59:37,295 --> 01:59:41,084
<i>For haven't I told you so</i>

1475
01:59:42,509 --> 01:59:46,674
<i>A million or more times?</i>

1476
01:59:46,763 --> 01:59:48,846
<i>You went away</i>

1477
01:59:48,932 --> 01:59:54,018
<i>And my heart went with you</i>

1478
01:59:58,525 --> 02:00:04,897
<i>I speak your name in my every prayer</i>

1479
02:00:09,077 --> 02:00:13,287
<i>If there is some other way</i>

1480
02:00:13,373 --> 02:00:17,242
<i>To prove that I love you</i>

1481
02:00:17,335 --> 02:00:21,750
<i>I swear I don't know how</i>

1482
02:00:23,591 --> 02:00:30,213
<i>You'll never know
if you don't know now</i>

1483
02:01:24,778 --> 02:01:29,648
<i>You'll never know just how much</i>

1484
02:01:29,741 --> 02:01:33,234
<i>I miss you</i>

1485
02:01:37,123 --> 02:01:44,087
<i>You'll never know just how much I care</i>

1486
02:01:49,344 --> 02:01:56,217
<i>You said goodbye, now stars in the sky</i>

1487
02:01:56,309 --> 02:02:01,429
<i>Refuse to shine</i>

1488
02:02:01,981 --> 02:02:04,815
<i>Take it from me</i>

1489
02:02:04,901 --> 02:02:10,442
<i>It's no fun to be alone</i>

1490
02:02:10,532 --> 02:02:14,697
<i>With moonlight and memories</i>

1491
02:02:14,786 --> 02:02:19,531
<i>You went away and my heart</i>

1492
02:02:19,624 --> 02:02:22,788
<i>Went with you</i>

1493
02:02:26,798 --> 02:02:30,508
<i>I speak your name</i>

1494
02:02:30,593 --> 02:02:34,678
<i>In my every prayer</i>

1495
02:02:36,224 --> 02:02:41,265
<i>If there is some other way</i>

1496
02:02:41,354 --> 02:02:44,973
<i>To prove that I love you</i>

1497
02:02:45,066 --> 02:02:49,857
<i>I swear I don't know how</i>

1498
02:02:51,322 --> 02:02:56,283
<i>You'll never know if you don't</i>

1499
02:02:56,369 --> 02:02:59,362
<i>Know</i>

1500
02:03:00,498 --> 02:03:03,912
<i>Now</i>
