1
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,543
M really doesn't mind you earning a little money on the side, Dryden.

2
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:21,163
She'd just prefer it if it wasn't selling secrets.

3
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:32,341
If the theatrics are supposed to scare me

4
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:35,052
you have the wrong man, Bond.

5
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,639
If M was so sure I was bent

6
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:40,766
she'd have sent a double-0.

7
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,103
Benefits of being section chief

8
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,023
I'd know if anyone had been promoted to double-0 status

9
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,524
wouldn't I?

10
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:54,155
-Your file shows no kills, and it takes... -Two.

11
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,090
Shame.

12
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,760
We barely got to know each other.

13
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:21,015
I know where you keep your gun.

14
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:25,061
I suppose that's something.

15
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,397
True.

16
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,650
How did he die?

17
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:32,318
Your contact?

18
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,028
Not well.

19
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,950
Made you feel it, did he?

20
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,205
Well

21
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,624
you needn't worry.

22
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,793
The second is...

23
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,590
Yes.

24
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:39,468
Considerably.

25
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:36,872
So how do I trust this man that I've never met with my money?

26
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,625
You asked for the introduction.

27
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,044
That's all my organisation will guarantee.

28
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,129
I suppose our friend Mr White will have told you

29
00:08:25,295 --> 00:08:27,631
that I have provided reliable banking services

30
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,509
for many other freedom fighters over the years.

31
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,599
Do you believe in God, Mr Le Chiffre?

32
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:39,435
No.

33
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:42,271
I believe in a reasonable rate of return.

34
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,773
I want no risk in the portfolio.

35
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,233
Agreed.

36
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,235
And I can access it anywhere in the world?

37
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,611
Yes.

38
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,799
I have the money, so short another million shares

39
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:12,676
of Skyfleet stock.

40
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:16,764
Sir, you must know you're betting against the market.

41
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,142
No one expects this stock to go anywhere but up.

42
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,020
Just do it.

43
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,265
Looks like our man. Burn scars on his face.

44
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,479
I wonder if bomb-makers are insured for things like that.

45
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:21,703
He's on the move.

46
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:24,832
He's on the move, and he's heading straight for me.

47
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:27,709
Stop touching your ear.

48
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:30,003
-Sorry? -Put your hand down.

49
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:38,971
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter. I need him alive.

50
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,128
Weeping blood comes merely from a derangement of the tear duct

51
00:20:13,294 --> 00:20:14,713
my dear general.

52
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,965
Nothing sinister.

53
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:23,596
All in.

54
00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:29,519
I have two pair, and you have a 17.4 percent chance

55
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,813
of making your straight.

56
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:00,592
When does Ellipsis expire?

57
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,970
-We have less than 36 hours. I can... -No. No, no.

58
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,890
That's all the time I have anyway.

59
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,852
Give our guests five minutes to leave

60
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,354
or throw them overboard.

61
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,659
Who the hell do they think they are?

62
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:29,370
I report to the prime minister, even he's smart enough

63
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:30,789
not to ask me what we do.

64
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:34,667
Have you ever seen such a bunch of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

65
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,670
They don't care what we do, they care what we get photographed doing.

66
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,507
And how the hell could Bond be so stupid?

67
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:43,593
I give him double-0 status, he celebrates by shooting an embassy.

68
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,137
Is the man deranged? And where the hell is he?

69
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,932
In the old days, if an agent did something embarrassing

70
00:21:49,098 --> 00:21:50,767
he'd have the good sense to defect.

71
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,811
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

72
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,097
You've got a bloody cheek.

73
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,807
Sorry.

74
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,809
I'll shoot the camera first next time.

75
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,644
Or yourself.

76
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:18,897
You stormed into an embassy.

77
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:21,649
You violated the only absolutely inviolate rule

78
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:23,443
of international relationships.

79
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,528
And why? So you could kill a nobody.

80
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,488
We wanted to question him, not kill him.

81
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,993
For God's sake. You're supposed to display some kind of judgement.

82
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,161
I did.

83
00:23:33,786 --> 00:23:36,331
I thought one less bomb-maker in the world would be good.

84
00:23:36,497 --> 00:23:38,333
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

85
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:39,834
We're trying to find out

86
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,503
how an entire network of terrorist groups is financed

87
00:23:42,545 --> 00:23:44,088
and you give us one bomb-maker.

88
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,507
Hardly the big picture, wouldn't you say?

89
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,969
The man isn't even a true believer. He's a gun for hire.

90
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,013
And thanks to your trigger finger

91
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:55,099
we have no idea who hired him or why.

92
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,518
And how the hell did you find out where I lived?

93
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,395
The same way I found out your name.

94
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,482
I thought "M" was randomly assigned. I had no idea it stood for...

95
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:05,526
Utter one more syllable and I'll have you killed.

96
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:09,322
I knew it was too early to promote you.

97
00:24:09,822 --> 00:24:13,868
Well, I understand double-0s have a very short life-expectancy

98
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,204
so your mistake will be short-lived.

99
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:27,423
Bond, this may be too much for a blunt instrument to understand

100
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,885
but arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand in hand.

101
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,347
So you want me to be half monk, half hit-man?

102
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,391
Any thug can kill.

103
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,018
I want you to take your ego out of the equation

104
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,646
and to judge the situation dispassionately.

105
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,608
I have to know I can trust you, and that you know who to trust.

106
00:24:46,901 --> 00:24:50,446
And since I don't know that, I need you out of my sight.

107
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:52,782
Go and stick your head in the sand somewhere

108
00:24:52,865 --> 00:24:54,367
and think about your future.

109
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,370
Because these bastards want your head.

110
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:01,040
And I'm seriously considering feeding you to them.

111
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,383
And Bond

112
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:16,389
don't ever break into my house again.

113
00:25:17,306 --> 00:25:19,267
Ma'am.

114
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,801
Good day, sir, and welcome to the Ocean Club.

115
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,016
Hey. Hey.

116
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,863
Hello.

117
00:26:55,988 --> 00:26:58,116
Are you going to take this or make me wait?

118
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,702
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

119
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:48,124
Security to car park. Security to car park.

120
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:49,917
Absolutely incredible.

121
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:31,602
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir. Checking in?

122
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:35,273
Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment thing, and I haven't got a reservation.

123
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,774
Okay.

124
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,654
-We have an ocean-view villa. -Perfect.

125
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:47,159
Could you do me a favour? I was here last night

126
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:51,080
and I parked my car next to a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

127
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:53,666
I nicked the door. You wouldn't happen to know...?

128
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,168
-Mr Dimitrios. -Right.

129
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,171
If he hasn't noticed, I'm not sure I'd mention it.

130
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:00,965
Isn't the type to take bad news well.

131
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,802
But if I felt compelled to find him?

132
00:30:05,886 --> 00:30:08,055
He has a house just up the beach.

133
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,017
Thank you.

134
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,914
-What? -He's in the Bahamas.

135
00:31:14,955 --> 00:31:17,500
You woke me to share his holiday plans?

136
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:19,752
Well, he's logged into our secure website

137
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,962
using your name and password.

138
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,091
Well, how the hell does he know these things?

139
00:31:25,132 --> 00:31:27,635
Well, I'm doing my best to find out.

140
00:31:27,676 --> 00:31:31,597
-Who's he looking at? -Alex Dimitrios.

141
00:31:31,972 --> 00:31:33,641
That slimy bugger.

142
00:31:44,151 --> 00:31:46,112
Now known associates.

143
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,250
Le Chiffre.

144
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:18,352
We've had a good night, we've had a few drinks.

145
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,105
How can I assist you, sir?

146
00:32:21,188 --> 00:32:23,441
Good evening. Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

147
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,402
-Look what just happened. -Good job, big boy.

148
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:27,695
Yeah.

149
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,579
Do you mind if I join?

150
00:32:36,662 --> 00:32:39,373
-Oh, good evening. How are you? -Good evening.

151
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,678
Small blind, big blind.

152
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,430
I'm in.

153
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:58,559
Bet's to you.

154
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,981
If that was for luck, you're two hours late.

155
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,818
Two hundred to you.

156
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:14,074
Bet's to you.

157
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:15,659
I heard you.

158
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:18,078
Five to call.

159
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,958
-Action's to you. -Pair of sevens.

160
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,543
Ace high.

161
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,755
Check or bet.

162
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:29,465
-Check. -And to you.

163
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:31,509
Five thousand.

164
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:36,931
Five to call.

165
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:51,111
-Check. -Check to you, sir.

166
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,114
All in.

167
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,617
No, wait.

168
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,702
Twenty thousand.

169
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,205
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

170
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:07,795
Okay. This is on the table. That's my car. Wanna bet?

171
00:34:09,463 --> 00:34:11,465
I'm sorry, Mr Dimitrios.

172
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,552
Please, no. Give him a chance to win his money back.

173
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:26,480
All right, show me, gentlemen.

174
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:32,945
Three kings.

175
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:40,995
There you go with my night.

176
00:34:41,036 --> 00:34:42,496
Trip aces.

177
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,707
Aces win.

178
00:34:48,502 --> 00:34:49,837
Oh, and the valet ticket.

179
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,676
Thank you.

180
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:57,261
Sir.

181
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:31,754
-Thank you. -Thank you, sir.

182
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,966
No wonder he was in such a foul mood.

183
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,510
My mistake.

184
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:39,887
Can I give you a lift home?

185
00:35:40,512 --> 00:35:44,016
That would really send him over the edge.

186
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,060
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

187
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,354
Well, perhaps you're just out of practise.

188
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,404
Perhaps.

189
00:35:57,571 --> 00:35:59,365
Well, what about a drink at my place?

190
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,576
Your place?

191
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,537
-Is it close? -Very.

192
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,796
One drink.

193
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,823
Good evening, sir, and welcome back.

194
00:36:40,906 --> 00:36:42,825
Welcome to my home.

195
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:58,173
I'm having a hard time seeing how this is my fault.

196
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:01,135
It's your plan. All I did was get you the man.

197
00:37:01,176 --> 00:37:05,723
A man who was under surveillance by the British Secret Service.

198
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:09,977
Which makes me wonder if I can trust you at all.

199
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,771
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

200
00:37:12,938 --> 00:37:14,940
But I do care about my reputation.

201
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,235
I have someone else willing to do the job.

202
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:20,154
He just needs the particulars

203
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:22,740
and payment.

204
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:37,421
You like married women, don't you, James?

205
00:37:37,504 --> 00:37:39,757
It keeps things simple.

206
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:45,637
What is it about bad men?

207
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,766
You, my husband.

208
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,643
I had so many chances to be happy

209
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:54,188
so many nice guys.

210
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:57,149
Why can't nice guys be more like you?

211
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,443
Well, because then they'd be bad.

212
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,654
Yes.

213
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:08,202
But so much more interesting.

214
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,209
What makes your husband a bad man?

215
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,961
His nature, I suppose.

216
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,880
The nature of his work?

217
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:23,592
A mystery, I'm afraid.

218
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:29,681
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me in order to get to him.

219
00:38:29,723 --> 00:38:32,226
How afraid?

220
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,604
Not enough to stop.

221
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:45,364
Can I ask you a personal question?

222
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,702
Now would seem an appropriate time.

223
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:53,247
Does "ellipsis" mean anything to you?

224
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:04,716
Should I ask him about it?

225
00:39:04,758 --> 00:39:07,094
Perhaps later.

226
00:39:08,053 --> 00:39:09,346
Yes, dear?

227
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:11,431
I'm on the last flight tonight to Miami.

228
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,268
Don't wait up. I'll be back in the morning.

229
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:16,812
Okay, I understand.

230
00:39:16,895 --> 00:39:19,690
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

231
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:25,737
Apparently he's on the last flight to Miami

232
00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:29,992
so you have all night to question me.

233
00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:34,454
In that case

234
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:35,747
we're gonna need

235
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:38,208
some more champagne.

236
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:45,632
Good evening. Room Service.

237
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:49,636
Good evening. Can I get a bottle of chilled Bollinger Grand Année

238
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,054
and the beluga caviar?

239
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,765
-With everything? -Yes, with everything.

240
00:39:53,807 --> 00:39:56,018
-And would that be for two, sir? -What?

241
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:59,396
-For two? -No, for one.

242
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,222
Wait here.

243
00:40:38,268 --> 00:40:41,480
There you go. Number 53.

244
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,903
Dr von Hagens' Body Worlds invites visitors

245
00:40:47,986 --> 00:40:50,948
to observe the body's various locomotive, digestive

246
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,824
nervous and vascular systems.

247
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:56,805
Please may I have your attention, ladies and gentlemen?

248
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:01,727
I believe it is something very special, what we see here.

249
00:42:01,893 --> 00:42:03,103
This is edutainment.

250
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,631
...fixed in dramatic and athletic poses

251
00:42:31,798 --> 00:42:35,677
that reveal the true-to-life spatial relationships amongst organs.

252
00:42:49,816 --> 00:42:51,359
Hello.

253
00:42:51,526 --> 00:42:53,487
Hello.

254
00:43:03,121 --> 00:43:05,749
Do not leave your vehicle unattended.

255
00:43:05,832 --> 00:43:08,502
Welcome to Miami lnternational Airport.

256
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:11,755
Kerbside parking in front of the terminal is restricted.

257
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:49,853
-Yes. -It's Bond. I need her now.

258
00:44:49,936 --> 00:44:52,647
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed. Can I take a message?

259
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:56,276
Listen, you go and find her, tell her to call Security at Miami Airport

260
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:58,945
because I think a bomb is about to go off. Do it now.

261
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:02,073
-Sorry, can I put you on hold? -I thought you might.

262
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:09,247
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

263
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,084
I'll call you back.

264
00:45:35,815 --> 00:45:38,235
-The Skyfleet S570 prototype. -What about it?

265
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,655
"The largest aeroplane in the world will be unveiled today at Miami Airport."

266
00:46:23,029 --> 00:46:24,072
Oh, my God!

267
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,865
Bond? Bond!

268
00:46:28,868 --> 00:46:30,996
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

269
00:46:31,162 --> 00:46:33,123
It's launching today.

270
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,335
I gotta go.

271
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,394
Stop! Stop!

272
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:09,042
Get moving! Let's go, let's go, let's go!

273
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:46,931
The put's expired. I'm sorry, I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

274
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:52,520
One hundred and one million, two hundred and six thousand dollars.

275
00:53:59,026 --> 00:54:01,237
Someone talked.

276
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,054
-You got everything you need? -Yeah, I have.

277
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,223
I'm gonna get a few more photos.

278
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:46,657
Quite the body count you're stacking up.

279
00:54:47,408 --> 00:54:50,286
She was tortured first. As you'd already killed her husband

280
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:53,039
she must have been the only one left to question.

281
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,917
Did she know anything that could compromise you?

282
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,084
No.

283
00:54:57,168 --> 00:55:00,755
-Not your name, what you were after? -No.

284
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:02,381
Dimitrios worked as middleman.

285
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,383
Knew where to put his hands on weapons

286
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,052
and people who could use them.

287
00:55:06,093 --> 00:55:07,845
He worked with anyone who had money.

288
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:11,349
For years he was involved with a man we knew as Le Chiffre

289
00:55:11,432 --> 00:55:13,518
private banker to the world's terrorists.

290
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:17,188
He invested their money, gave them access to it wherever they wanted.

291
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,190
Oh, good. You're here.

292
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,901
Albanian, we believe. Chess prodigy.

293
00:55:21,984 --> 00:55:26,572
A bit of a mathematical genius and liked to prove it by playing poker.

294
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,353
So you can keep an eye on me?

295
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,189
Yes.

296
00:56:05,069 --> 00:56:08,322
When they analysed the stock market after 9/11

297
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:11,742
the CIA discovered a massive shorting of airline stocks.

298
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:15,788
When the stocks hit bottom on 9/12, somebody made a fortune.

299
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:18,916
The same thing happened this morning with Skyfleet stock

300
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,585
or was supposed to.

301
00:56:20,626 --> 00:56:24,547
With their prototype destroyed, the company would be near bankruptcy.

302
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:28,676
Instead, somebody lost over $100 million betting the wrong way.

303
00:56:29,635 --> 00:56:31,679
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

304
00:56:31,762 --> 00:56:34,432
Which would explain how he could set up a high-stakes poker game

305
00:56:34,473 --> 00:56:36,767
at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

306
00:56:36,809 --> 00:56:40,980
Ten players, $10 million buy-in, 5 million re-buy.

307
00:56:41,063 --> 00:56:43,983
Winner takes all. Potentially 150 million.

308
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,736
Good. Then we'll know where he'll be.

309
00:56:46,819 --> 00:56:48,905
Do you want a clean kill or to send a message?

310
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:53,367
We want him alive. Le Chiffre doesn't have 100 million to lose.

311
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:56,996
Has he been playing the stock market with his clients' funds?

312
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,916
They're not gonna be too happy when they find out it's gone.

313
00:57:00,082 --> 00:57:01,667
We can't let him win this game.

314
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,003
If he loses, he'll have nowhere to run.

315
00:57:04,086 --> 00:57:06,964
We'll give him sanctuary in return for everything he knows.

316
00:57:07,131 --> 00:57:09,008
I'm putting you in the game

317
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,844
replacing someone who's playing for a syndicate.

318
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:15,848
According to Villiers, you're the best player in the Service.

319
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,767
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

320
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:26,859
I would ask you if you could remain emotionally detached

321
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:30,112
but I don't think that's your problem, is it, Bond?

322
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,657
No.

323
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,369
Don't worry about keeping in touch.

324
00:57:37,536 --> 00:57:38,955
We'll know where you are.

325
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,456
You can stop pretending.

326
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,376
You knew I wouldn't let this drop, didn't you?

327
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,837
Well, I knew you were you.

328
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,066
Thank you.

329
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,449
I'm the money.

330
00:58:17,743 --> 00:58:19,036
Every penny of it.

331
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:24,000
The Treasury has agreed to stake you in the game.

332
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:26,669
"Vesper."

333
00:58:26,752 --> 00:58:29,296
Well, I do hope you gave your parents hell for that.

334
00:58:30,047 --> 00:58:31,590
Thank you.

335
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,467
Your boss must be well-connected.

336
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,012
I've never seen so much go out the door so quickly.

337
00:58:36,595 --> 00:58:38,264
Or quite so stylishly.

338
00:58:40,307 --> 00:58:41,892
May I ask you where it is?

339
00:58:41,934 --> 00:58:44,603
Ten million was wired to your account in Montenegro

340
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:49,150
with a contingency for 5 more if I deem it a prudent investment.

341
00:58:49,233 --> 00:58:52,403
I suppose you've given some thought to the notion that if you lose

342
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:55,406
our government will have directly financed terrorism.

343
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,161
What looks good?

344
00:59:07,376 --> 00:59:10,296
So you're telling me it's a matter of probability and odds.

345
00:59:10,379 --> 00:59:12,381
I was worried there was some chance involved.

346
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:15,259
Well, only if you assume the player with the best hand wins.

347
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,678
So that would be what you call "bluffing"?

348
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,433
You've heard the term.

349
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,352
Then you'll also know that in poker you never play your hand.

350
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,812
You play the man across from you.

351
00:59:26,979 --> 00:59:29,398
-And you're good at reading people? -Yes, I am.

352
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:31,358
Which is why I've been able to detect

353
00:59:31,525 --> 00:59:33,652
an undercurrent of sarcasm in your voice.

354
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,198
I'm now assured our money is in good hands.

355
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,493
You don't think this is a very good plan, do you?

356
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:42,286
So there is a plan?

357
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,997
I got the impression we were risking millions of dollars

358
00:59:45,122 --> 00:59:47,500
and hundreds of lives on a game of luck.

359
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:49,627
What else can you surmise, Mr Bond?

360
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:52,088
About you, Miss Lynd?

361
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,798
Well, your beauty's a problem.

362
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:56,342
You worry you won't be taken seriously.

363
00:59:56,425 --> 00:59:59,470
Which one can say of any attractive woman with half a brain.

364
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,347
True, but this one overcompensates

365
01:00:01,388 --> 01:00:03,265
by wearing slightly masculine clothing

366
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,893
being more aggressive than her female colleagues

367
01:00:05,976 --> 01:00:08,604
which gives her a somewhat prickly demeanour

368
01:00:08,687 --> 01:00:12,066
and ironically enough, makes it less likely for her to be accepted

369
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,527
and promoted by her male superiors

370
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:17,404
who mistake her insecurities for arrogance.

371
01:00:17,863 --> 01:00:22,034
Now, I'd have normally gone with only child

372
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:25,371
but, you see, by the way you ignored the quip about your parents

373
01:00:25,412 --> 01:00:28,124
I'm gonna have to go with orphan.

374
01:00:31,043 --> 01:00:33,045
All right.

375
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,549
By the cut of your suit, you went to Oxford or wherever

376
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:39,135
and actually think human beings dress like that.

377
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,220
But you wear it with such disdain

378
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:43,222
my guess is you didn't come from money

379
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,891
and your school friends never let you forget it.

380
01:00:46,183 --> 01:00:48,227
Which means you were at that school by the grace

381
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:51,147
of someone else's charity, hence the chip on your shoulder.

382
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,024
And since your first thought about me ran to orphan

383
01:00:54,066 --> 01:00:56,110
that's what I'd say you are.

384
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:02,074
Oh, you are.

385
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:04,451
I like this poker thing.

386
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,412
And that makes perfect sense

387
01:01:06,495 --> 01:01:09,039
since MI6 looks for maladjusted young men

388
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:11,167
that give little thought to sacrificing others

389
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,919
in order to protect Queen and country.

390
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,171
You know

391
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:19,258
former SAS types with easy smiles and expensive watches.

392
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:22,094
-Rolex? -Omega.

393
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,138
Beautiful.

394
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,432
Now, having just met you

395
01:01:26,473 --> 01:01:29,310
I wouldn't go as far as calling you a cold-hearted bastard.

396
01:01:29,393 --> 01:01:30,978
No, of course not.

397
01:01:31,061 --> 01:01:32,813
But it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine.

398
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,107
You think of women as disposable pleasures

399
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,318
rather than meaningful pursuits.

400
01:01:38,944 --> 01:01:41,155
So as charming as you are, Mr Bond

401
01:01:41,238 --> 01:01:43,824
I will be keeping my eye on our government's money

402
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:45,910
and off your perfectly formed arse.

403
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:47,953
You noticed?

404
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,206
Even accountants have imagination.

405
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,624
How was your lamb?

406
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,709
Skewered.

407
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:55,461
One sympathises.

408
01:01:57,254 --> 01:01:58,797
Good evening, Mr Bond.

409
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,217
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

410
01:02:16,815 --> 01:02:19,818
-Hotel Splendid, sir? -That's right.

411
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:24,323
-Thank you, sir. -Thank you.

412
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:40,631
It's just last-minute details.

413
01:02:42,299 --> 01:02:44,051
Apparently we're very much in love.

414
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,763
Do you usually leave it to porters to tell you this sort of thing?

415
01:02:47,846 --> 01:02:50,975
Only when the romance has been necessarily brief.

416
01:02:51,016 --> 01:02:54,144
I'm Mr Arlington Beech, professional gambler

417
01:02:54,186 --> 01:02:55,896
and you're Miss Stephanie Broadchest...

418
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,190
-I am not. -You're gonna have to trust me on this.

419
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,484
Oh, no, I don't.

420
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:02,486
We've been involved for quite a while

421
01:03:03,195 --> 01:03:05,072
hence the shared suite.

422
01:03:05,155 --> 01:03:07,658
But my family is strict Roman Catholic

423
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,577
so for appearances' sake, it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

424
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:13,956
I do hate it when religion comes between us.

425
01:03:14,206 --> 01:03:16,750
Religion and a securely locked door.

426
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,794
Am I going to have a problem with you, Bond?

427
01:03:18,877 --> 01:03:21,672
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

428
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:23,132
Smart?

429
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,426
Single.

430
01:03:44,611 --> 01:03:46,739
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid. Your name, sir?

431
01:03:46,822 --> 01:03:49,825
James Bond. You'll find the reservation under Beech.

432
01:03:49,908 --> 01:03:52,661
-Welcome, Mr Bond. -You sign that, dear.

433
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:55,622
You represent the Treasury.

434
01:03:59,918 --> 01:04:02,755
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

435
01:04:02,796 --> 01:04:04,423
I will. Thank you.

436
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,719
Very funny.

437
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:10,888
Look, if Le Chiffre is that well-connected

438
01:04:10,929 --> 01:04:12,890
he knows who I am and where the money's from.

439
01:04:13,223 --> 01:04:15,601
Which means he's decided to play me anyway.

440
01:04:15,642 --> 01:04:18,062
So he's either desperate or he's overly confident

441
01:04:18,103 --> 01:04:20,647
but either way, that tells me something about him.

442
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:23,275
And all he gets in return is a name he already has.

443
01:04:23,567 --> 01:04:25,277
And now he knows something about you.

444
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,571
He knows you're reckless.

445
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,157
Take the next one.

446
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,118
There isn't enough room for me and your ego.

447
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,245
Mr Bond?

448
01:04:35,287 --> 01:04:37,623
-It was left for you. -Thank you.

449
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:10,322
I love you too, M.

450
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:54,700
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis. I'm your contact here.

451
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,872
Does he know we've been watching him?

452
01:05:59,913 --> 01:06:02,708
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

453
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:07,171
Probably because there's no "we." Just me.

454
01:06:07,754 --> 01:06:09,882
I'm afraid if you get into trouble here

455
01:06:09,923 --> 01:06:13,719
the cavalry won't be coming over the nearest hill.

456
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,055
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday

457
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:21,018
and spent the time re-establishing old relationships.

458
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,646
The chief of police and he are now quite close.

459
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,732
That's him, with the moustache.

460
01:06:26,815 --> 01:06:28,400
Over my left shoulder.

461
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:31,778
Well, that could make life quite difficult.

462
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:33,947
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

463
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:36,783
He's not a very subtle man.

464
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:40,162
I thought about trying to buy his services, but we frankly

465
01:06:40,245 --> 01:06:43,457
couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

466
01:06:51,548 --> 01:06:52,841
I hate to say it

467
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:56,929
but the accountants seem to be running MI6 these days.

468
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:01,266
Oh, not that I have anything against accountants.

469
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,644
Many of them are lovely people.

470
01:07:05,145 --> 01:07:08,398
So I decided that it was cheaper to supply his deputy

471
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:12,110
with evidence that we were bribing the chief.

472
01:07:12,277 --> 01:07:16,615
It's amazing what you can do with Photoshop these days, isn't it?

473
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,995
I think your odds are improving, Mr Bond.

474
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,044
Yes?

475
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,380
For you.

476
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:35,050
Something you expect me to wear?

477
01:07:37,469 --> 01:07:38,887
I need you looking fabulous.

478
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:41,473
So when you walk up behind me and kiss me on the neck

479
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:43,809
the players will be thinking about your neckline

480
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:45,978
and not about their cards.

481
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:48,564
Do you think you can do that for me?

482
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,607
I'll do my best.

483
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,610
Thank you.

484
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:06,832
I have a dinner jacket.

485
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,502
There are dinner jackets and dinner jackets.

486
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:11,837
This is the latter.

487
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,173
And I need you looking like a man who belongs at that table.

488
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:17,217
How...?

489
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,511
It's tailored.

490
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:22,264
I sized you up the moment we met.

491
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:18,570
-Good evening, sir. -Good evening.

492
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,199
Thank you.

493
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:35,170
And you must be Mr Bliss' replacement.

494
01:09:35,253 --> 01:09:37,422
Welcome, Mr Beech.

495
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:41,551
Or is that Bond? I'm a little confused.

496
01:09:41,593 --> 01:09:44,054
Well, we wouldn't want that, would we?

497
01:09:53,438 --> 01:09:55,607
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

498
01:09:55,649 --> 01:09:58,276
As you know, the game is no-limit hold 'em poker.

499
01:09:58,443 --> 01:10:00,445
Five communal cards, two in the hole.

500
01:10:00,862 --> 01:10:03,782
Monsieur Mendel here represents the Basel Bank, Switzerland

501
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:05,117
holding the stakes.

502
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,955
You have each deposited $10 million buy-in.

503
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:13,125
A further buy-in of 5 million can be made by electronic transfer.

504
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:15,460
The money will remain in escrow until I return

505
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:18,380
and the winner of the contest enters his or her password

506
01:10:18,463 --> 01:10:21,675
into the encryptor, whereupon the entire sum will be wired

507
01:10:21,758 --> 01:10:23,927
to any bank account in the world you nominate.

508
01:10:24,469 --> 01:10:26,221
Mr Bond?

509
01:10:26,596 --> 01:10:27,889
We proceed alphabetically.

510
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:30,475
Please be so kind as to enter a password of your choice.

511
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:40,026
Six letters or more.

512
01:10:53,081 --> 01:10:55,792
High card for dealer position.

513
01:11:02,799 --> 01:11:04,217
It's Signor Gallardo.

514
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:07,345
Mr Kaminofsky is the small blind, $5000

515
01:11:07,512 --> 01:11:10,974
and Mr Fukutu, the big blind, $10,000.

516
01:11:13,101 --> 01:11:15,187
Well, enjoy the game.

517
01:11:39,002 --> 01:11:40,128
Four players.

518
01:11:42,714 --> 01:11:44,049
It's your bet.

519
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:47,177
Check.

520
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:49,054
Check.

521
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,435
Bet. Fifty thousand.

522
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:09,908
Call.

523
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:14,454
Fold.

524
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:19,084
Fold. Heads up.

525
01:12:23,338 --> 01:12:24,798
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

526
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:38,895
Bet. One hundred thousand.

527
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:45,110
Weren't you supposed to enter so the others could see you?

528
01:12:45,151 --> 01:12:48,238
Was I? Forgive me.

529
01:12:48,738 --> 01:12:50,949
Good luck, darling.

530
01:12:54,744 --> 01:12:57,163
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

531
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:00,458
Monsieur Bond?

532
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,211
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet? A hundred thousand?

533
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:05,755
Call.

534
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:12,137
Hello.

535
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:15,974
I suppose I don't have to tell you how beautiful you look.

536
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:19,311
Half the people at that table are still watching you.

537
01:13:19,352 --> 01:13:20,395
Champagne.

538
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:25,942
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

539
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:38,330
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

540
01:13:44,669 --> 01:13:48,506
Monsieur, you have been called. Showdown, please.

541
01:13:50,133 --> 01:13:53,345
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre. Deuces full of nines.

542
01:13:53,511 --> 01:13:55,347
Mr Bond?

543
01:13:58,183 --> 01:13:59,559
Fold.

544
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,277
Send the barman over, please.

545
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:20,330
A dry martini. Wait.

546
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:22,207
Three measures Gordon's, one of vodka

547
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:24,167
half of Kina Lillet, shake it over ice

548
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:27,295
-then add a thin slice of lemon peel. -Yes, sir.

549
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:30,256
-You know, I'll have one of those. -So will I.

550
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:32,467
Certainly.

551
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:37,305
My friend, bring me one as well. Keep the fruit.

552
01:14:38,139 --> 01:14:39,516
That's it?

553
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,477
Anyone want to play poker now?

554
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,770
Someone's in a hurry.

555
01:14:52,737 --> 01:14:54,739
Would you excuse me?

556
01:15:08,211 --> 01:15:09,671
You taste nice.

557
01:15:09,754 --> 01:15:12,799
-I thought we dispensed with covers. -No.

558
01:15:12,882 --> 01:15:16,720
We dispensed with one that was of no use and created another that is.

559
01:15:16,761 --> 01:15:18,430
-Is he watching? -Yes.

560
01:15:18,513 --> 01:15:19,723
Good.

561
01:15:19,764 --> 01:15:22,684
This is me in character pissed off because you're losing so fast

562
01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:24,644
we won't be here past midnight.

563
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:27,731
Oddly, my character's feelings mirror my own.

564
01:15:28,314 --> 01:15:29,941
Check.

565
01:15:30,483 --> 01:15:32,485
-You know, that's not half bad. -Up to you.

566
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:34,487
I'm gonna have to think up a name for that.

567
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:38,616
It was worth it to discover his tell.

568
01:15:38,908 --> 01:15:40,201
What do you mean?

569
01:15:40,535 --> 01:15:42,662
The twitch he has to hide when he bluffs.

570
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:47,000
-Bluffs? He had the best hand. -Which he got on the last card.

571
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:49,461
The odds against were 23-to-1, and he'd know that.

572
01:15:49,502 --> 01:15:51,629
When he did his first raise he had nothing.

573
01:15:51,671 --> 01:15:53,339
Winning was blind luck.

574
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:55,383
-Did you get the bug? -Yes.

575
01:15:55,467 --> 01:15:57,469
Bet. One hundred thousand.

576
01:15:57,510 --> 01:15:59,095
Thank you.

577
01:16:00,847 --> 01:16:02,432
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

578
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:05,560
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

579
01:16:06,352 --> 01:16:07,812
Call.

580
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:11,399
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

581
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:16,529
Ladies and gentlemen, Mesdames, Messieurs,

582
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:18,531
we've now been playing for four hours.

583
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:23,119
It's time for a short break. We will resume play in one hour.

584
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:57,695
Well, I think I'll report on the evening's frivolities.

585
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,282
So?

586
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:03,618
You want to do what to me?

587
01:17:03,701 --> 01:17:05,120
You've lost me completely.

588
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:08,206
You just said you can't wait to get me back to the room. Come on.

589
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:35,775
So, what's so damn important?

590
01:17:38,194 --> 01:17:39,821
I'm sorry.

591
01:17:42,657 --> 01:17:44,242
Where is my money?

592
01:17:48,746 --> 01:17:50,081
-Good evening. -Good evening.

593
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:52,417
You're holding a parcel for me.

594
01:17:57,046 --> 01:17:58,756
Thank you.

595
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:04,179
Do you think you can lose that kind of money and no one would notice?

596
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:06,514
Your money is safe.

597
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:10,059
Open that.

598
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:28,119
You'll have it tomorrow.

599
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:30,371
All of it.

600
01:18:43,801 --> 01:18:47,805
I would take a hand for this betrayal, but you need it to play cards.

601
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,103
Hold out your arm.

602
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:57,148
Hold out your arm, my beauty

603
01:18:57,774 --> 01:18:59,400
or I will take your head.

604
01:19:09,285 --> 01:19:12,247
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

605
01:19:25,551 --> 01:19:26,552
Stairs.

606
01:19:31,015 --> 01:19:33,685
Not a word of protest.

607
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,854
You should find a new boyfriend.

608
01:21:38,976 --> 01:21:40,812
Go find Mathis.

609
01:21:40,895 --> 01:21:44,273
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here and I want him to get rid of them.

610
01:21:44,315 --> 01:21:47,402
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

611
01:22:50,214 --> 01:22:52,842
You changed your shirt, Mr Bond.

612
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:56,971
I hope our little game isn't causing you to perspire.

613
01:22:57,054 --> 01:22:58,389
A little.

614
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:02,185
But I won't consider myself to be in trouble until I start weeping blood.

615
01:23:02,226 --> 01:23:06,314
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's ready, let's continue the game.

616
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:11,921
It's like there's blood on my hands. It's not coming off.

617
01:24:12,922 --> 01:24:14,799
Here, let's see.

618
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:32,233
That's better.

619
01:24:36,279 --> 01:24:37,738
You cold?

620
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:39,323
Yeah.

621
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,325
Here.

622
01:25:38,049 --> 01:25:40,593
You have any trouble with the bodies?

623
01:25:40,676 --> 01:25:42,845
Less than some.

624
01:25:56,567 --> 01:26:00,363
Being dead doesn't mean one can't still be helpful.

625
01:26:01,238 --> 01:26:04,075
That'll keep Le Chiffre looking over his shoulder.

626
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:06,410
He'll be wondering who's gonna come for him next.

627
01:26:08,037 --> 01:26:10,289
How's our girl?

628
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:14,043
Melted your cold heart yet?

629
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:33,270
Call.

630
01:26:33,312 --> 01:26:34,855
Fold.

631
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:36,941
And call.

632
01:26:38,192 --> 01:26:40,277
Three players.

633
01:26:43,864 --> 01:26:45,783
Three hundred grand.

634
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:47,535
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

635
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,080
Call.

636
01:26:52,748 --> 01:26:53,791
And call.

637
01:26:58,921 --> 01:27:00,256
Three players.

638
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:05,594
Check.

639
01:27:11,058 --> 01:27:12,268
Monsieur Bond?

640
01:27:22,111 --> 01:27:24,572
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

641
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:40,671
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

642
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:42,798
My God, James was right.

643
01:27:43,841 --> 01:27:45,843
It's up to you.

644
01:27:51,932 --> 01:27:54,351
Raise. One million.

645
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,819
Seems someone knows something I don't.

646
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:06,155
Fold.

647
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:08,157
Heads up, gentlemen.

648
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:09,784
It's up to you.

649
01:28:23,923 --> 01:28:25,424
Two.

650
01:28:26,175 --> 01:28:28,302
Re-raise. Two million.

651
01:28:30,221 --> 01:28:32,348
And it's up to you.

652
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,277
I'm all in.

653
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:55,079
Well, it's 14 million and 500, 000.

654
01:28:55,162 --> 01:28:57,540
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

655
01:29:00,209 --> 01:29:04,588
Bond will have to go all in to call his bluff.

656
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:08,259
-Call. -Call.

657
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:11,095
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

658
01:29:12,763 --> 01:29:15,307
Full house. Kings and aces.

659
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:17,434
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

660
01:29:30,364 --> 01:29:34,118
It's four jacks. Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

661
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:41,292
You must have thought I was bluffing, Mr Bond.

662
01:29:41,917 --> 01:29:43,127
Please.

663
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:45,713
We will now break for one hour.

664
01:29:45,796 --> 01:29:49,133
When we return, the big blind will be 200, 000.

665
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,267
Good game.

666
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:29,715
Well, I'm gonna need the other 5 million to buy back in.

667
01:30:30,257 --> 01:30:32,635
I can't do that, James.

668
01:30:33,135 --> 01:30:35,554
Look, I made a mistake.

669
01:30:36,347 --> 01:30:39,475
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant, but I can beat him.

670
01:30:39,516 --> 01:30:41,018
-I'm sorry. -Sorry?

671
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:43,604
Sorry?

672
01:30:43,687 --> 01:30:45,564
Try putting that in a sentence.

673
01:30:45,648 --> 01:30:47,191
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win

674
01:30:47,232 --> 01:30:49,693
continue funding terror and killing ." That kind of sorry?

675
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:52,988
You lost because of your ego, and that same ego can't take it.

676
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,573
That's what this is about.

677
01:30:54,657 --> 01:30:56,659
All you're going to do now is lose more.

678
01:30:57,242 --> 01:30:58,452
Then you're an idiot.

679
01:30:58,535 --> 01:31:01,455
-I'm sorry? -I said, you're a bloody idiot.

680
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:05,709
Look in my eyes.

681
01:31:06,418 --> 01:31:08,212
I can beat this man, you know that.

682
01:31:10,839 --> 01:31:13,467
Get your hand off my arm.

683
01:31:36,323 --> 01:31:37,616
Vodka martini.

684
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:40,536
-Shaken or stirred? -Do I look like I give a damn?

685
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:00,973
-James. -Get the girl out.

686
01:32:08,188 --> 01:32:09,314
Funny game, right?

687
01:32:09,398 --> 01:32:13,152
Sorry, I should've introduced myself, seeing as we're related.

688
01:32:13,235 --> 01:32:16,363
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

689
01:32:18,323 --> 01:32:19,908
You should have a little faith.

690
01:32:19,950 --> 01:32:22,494
If you keep your head about you, I think you have him.

691
01:32:22,619 --> 01:32:24,955
Had. Excuse me.

692
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:27,291
You're not buying in?

693
01:32:28,959 --> 01:32:30,377
No.

694
01:32:33,672 --> 01:32:37,760
Listen, I'm bleeding chips. I'm not gonna last much longer.

695
01:32:37,801 --> 01:32:40,554
You have a better chance. I'll stake you.

696
01:32:41,513 --> 01:32:43,807
I'm saying I'll give you the money to keep going.

697
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:48,771
Just one thing. If you pull it off, the CIA bring him in.

698
01:32:50,105 --> 01:32:52,483
And what about the winnings?

699
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:55,736
Does it look like we need the money?

700
01:33:07,247 --> 01:33:09,374
Shall we up the blinds?

701
01:33:11,543 --> 01:33:13,295
Why not?

702
01:33:16,715 --> 01:33:18,258
Bet.

703
01:33:20,302 --> 01:33:22,012
Raise.

704
01:33:37,486 --> 01:33:39,446
And fold.

705
01:33:41,657 --> 01:33:43,659
Excuse me, please.

706
01:33:45,327 --> 01:33:46,995
Call.

707
01:33:48,413 --> 01:33:49,790
Raise.

708
01:33:49,873 --> 01:33:53,377
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

709
01:33:55,838 --> 01:33:57,798
-Fold. -Thank you.

710
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:01,343
Fold.

711
01:34:05,347 --> 01:34:06,390
Fold.

712
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:13,480
Thank you.

713
01:34:13,605 --> 01:34:14,648
Wins.

714
01:34:35,752 --> 01:34:36,920
Deal me out.

715
01:34:37,921 --> 01:34:41,091
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

716
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,595
Small blind, please.

717
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:51,119
-Who is it? -It's 007.

718
01:35:52,746 --> 01:35:55,332
Bond's been poisoned. He's going into cardiac arrest.

719
01:35:57,459 --> 01:36:00,045
Stay calm and don't interrupt. Because you'll be dead

720
01:36:00,128 --> 01:36:02,798
within two minutes unless you do exactly what I tell you.

721
01:36:03,048 --> 01:36:04,174
I'm all ears.

722
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:06,134
Remove the defibrillator from the pouch.

723
01:36:06,176 --> 01:36:08,512
-Do we know what it is yet? -We're still scanning.

724
01:36:14,142 --> 01:36:16,895
Attach the leads to your chest.

725
01:36:25,529 --> 01:36:27,531
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

726
01:36:27,739 --> 01:36:30,701
What do we give him? The kit has amphetamines, antihistamines

727
01:36:30,784 --> 01:36:32,536
hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?

728
01:36:32,619 --> 01:36:35,497
-As soon as it reads charged... -Lidocaine. That'll work.

729
01:36:35,539 --> 01:36:38,184
Bond, don't push the red button yet. Do you hear me? Don't push it.

730
01:36:38,208 --> 01:36:39,793
His heart's gonna stop.

731
01:36:39,876 --> 01:36:42,296
There's only time for one charge before he passes out.

732
01:36:43,213 --> 01:36:47,217
Take the blue combipen, Bond. Mid-neck into the vein.

733
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:49,636
That'll counteract the digitalis.

734
01:36:52,889 --> 01:36:54,850
You're going to pass out in a few seconds.

735
01:36:54,891 --> 01:36:57,811
You need to keep your heart going. Push the red button now, Bond.

736
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:06,361
-Bond, push the damn button! -Do it now!

737
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:56,203
-You okay? -Me?

738
01:37:59,498 --> 01:38:02,250
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

739
01:38:02,292 --> 01:38:06,004
-Now get yourself off to a hospital. -I will do.

740
01:38:06,963 --> 01:38:08,507
As soon as I've won this game.

741
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:11,343
You're not seriously going back there?

742
01:38:13,887 --> 01:38:15,680
I wouldn't dream of it.

743
01:38:17,432 --> 01:38:19,059
Bet. One million.

744
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:24,481
-All in. -Call. All in.

745
01:38:24,523 --> 01:38:27,150
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

746
01:38:29,152 --> 01:38:31,071
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

747
01:38:34,991 --> 01:38:37,452
Queen plays. Wins.

748
01:38:46,002 --> 01:38:47,337
Oh, I'm sorry.

749
01:38:47,379 --> 01:38:50,006
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

750
01:38:51,383 --> 01:38:55,178
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange, we enter the final phase of the game

751
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:57,055
which means no more buy-ins.

752
01:38:57,180 --> 01:39:00,392
The big blind is now 1 million dollars.

753
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:08,608
Four players.

754
01:39:11,361 --> 01:39:12,779
It's your bet.

755
01:39:16,783 --> 01:39:18,076
-Monsieur Bond? -Check.

756
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:22,038
-Check. -Twenty-four million in the pot already.

757
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:27,043
Check. And check.

758
01:39:27,419 --> 01:39:29,045
All check.

759
01:39:29,379 --> 01:39:30,589
Four players.

760
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,012
-Check. -Check.

761
01:39:42,893 --> 01:39:45,061
All in. Six million.

762
01:39:45,937 --> 01:39:48,523
Bet. Six million. All in.

763
01:39:53,904 --> 01:39:56,406
Five million. All in.

764
01:39:56,448 --> 01:39:59,075
Bet is 6 million.

765
01:40:06,541 --> 01:40:07,918
Raise.

766
01:40:09,419 --> 01:40:10,754
Raise.

767
01:40:10,837 --> 01:40:14,132
Twelve million. Heads up.

768
01:40:44,704 --> 01:40:47,874
Forty million, 500, 000. All in.

769
01:40:50,293 --> 01:40:52,128
Raise. All in.

770
01:41:10,981 --> 01:41:14,651
Well, I think I will call you on that one.

771
01:41:21,449 --> 01:41:22,659
Call.

772
01:41:34,504 --> 01:41:38,842
One hundred and fifteen million in the pot.

773
01:41:38,925 --> 01:41:41,678
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

774
01:41:45,307 --> 01:41:47,267
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

775
01:41:55,817 --> 01:41:58,862
Full house. Eights full of aces.

776
01:42:16,963 --> 01:42:19,215
A higher full house.

777
01:42:19,299 --> 01:42:20,800
Aces full of sixes.

778
01:42:26,765 --> 01:42:28,016
Monsieur Bond.

779
01:42:45,033 --> 01:42:47,661
Five and seven of spades.

780
01:42:47,744 --> 01:42:49,329
A straight flush.

781
01:42:49,412 --> 01:42:50,830
Four to the eight.

782
01:42:50,914 --> 01:42:53,041
The high hand.

783
01:42:57,712 --> 01:42:59,255
Monsieur Bond wins.

784
01:43:00,256 --> 01:43:02,592
-For you. -Thank you very much.

785
01:43:04,969 --> 01:43:06,304
Congratulations.

786
01:43:06,388 --> 01:43:09,933
-He's all yours. -Much appreciated, brother.

787
01:43:16,898 --> 01:43:18,191
Congratulations.

788
01:43:18,274 --> 01:43:20,276
You know, I think a celebration's in order.

789
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,904
You were almost dead an hour ago.

790
01:43:23,738 --> 01:43:26,783
Come on, I'm famished.

791
01:43:37,127 --> 01:43:39,045
Thank you.

792
01:43:46,636 --> 01:43:50,640
Mathis says the Americans have made contact with Le Chiffre.

793
01:43:50,724 --> 01:43:53,977
They're going to extract him before dawn.

794
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:56,062
You know, I think I'll call that a Vesper.

795
01:43:57,439 --> 01:43:59,357
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

796
01:43:59,441 --> 01:44:03,653
No. Because once you've tasted it, that's all you want to drink.

797
01:44:06,197 --> 01:44:09,325
-I thought that was quite a good line. -It was a very good line.

798
01:44:10,535 --> 01:44:12,078
But you're laughing at it.

799
01:44:12,370 --> 01:44:16,666
-Not so much it as you. -Well, that's fine then.

800
01:44:22,964 --> 01:44:24,549
I figured out what that is.

801
01:44:26,968 --> 01:44:29,345
It's an Algerian love knot.

802
01:44:29,429 --> 01:44:32,766
Really? I thought it was just something pretty.

803
01:44:32,849 --> 01:44:34,517
No, you didn't.

804
01:44:35,351 --> 01:44:36,853
Someone gave that to you.

805
01:44:40,523 --> 01:44:42,317
He's a very lucky man.

806
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:51,910
You can switch off so easily, can't you?

807
01:44:51,993 --> 01:44:54,204
It doesn't bother you, killing those people?

808
01:44:54,788 --> 01:44:57,874
Well, I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did.

809
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:01,544
I don't believe you.

810
01:45:01,628 --> 01:45:03,880
You've got a choice, you know?

811
01:45:03,963 --> 01:45:05,715
Just because you've done something

812
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:08,051
doesn't mean you have to keep doing it.

813
01:45:08,134 --> 01:45:11,137
Why is it people who can't take advice always insist on giving it?

814
01:45:11,221 --> 01:45:13,223
You think I can't take my own advice?

815
01:45:14,098 --> 01:45:16,810
I think something is driving you.

816
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:19,395
And I think I'll never find out what that is.

817
01:45:25,276 --> 01:45:27,445
Mathis needs me.

818
01:45:28,071 --> 01:45:29,489
Good night.

819
01:45:29,572 --> 01:45:30,907
Congratulations again.

820
01:45:50,176 --> 01:45:52,053
Mathis.

821
01:47:43,957 --> 01:47:47,919
I'm afraid your friend Mathis is really

822
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:51,005
my friend Mathis.

823
01:49:33,733 --> 01:49:36,486
You've taken good care of your body.

824
01:49:42,992 --> 01:49:45,536
Such a waste.

825
01:50:02,762 --> 01:50:04,889
You know

826
01:50:04,972 --> 01:50:08,226
I never understood all these elaborate tortures.

827
01:50:08,309 --> 01:50:10,645
It's the simplest thing

828
01:50:10,686 --> 01:50:14,273
to cause more pain than a man can possibly endure.

829
01:50:15,733 --> 01:50:17,026
And of course

830
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:20,196
it's not only the immediate agony, but the knowledge

831
01:50:20,279 --> 01:50:22,990
that if you do not yield soon enough

832
01:50:23,658 --> 01:50:27,328
there will be little left to identify you as a man.

833
01:50:33,376 --> 01:50:35,294
The only question remains

834
01:50:36,754 --> 01:50:38,965
will you yield in time?

835
01:50:41,008 --> 01:50:44,178
I want the money.

836
01:51:02,864 --> 01:51:06,409
Miss Lynd will give me the account number, if she hasn't already.

837
01:51:06,492 --> 01:51:08,911
So all I need from you is the password.

838
01:51:18,629 --> 01:51:21,924
The password, please.

839
01:51:26,095 --> 01:51:28,556
I've got a little itch

840
01:51:28,598 --> 01:51:30,516
down there.

841
01:51:31,267 --> 01:51:32,768
Would you mind?

842
01:51:40,443 --> 01:51:43,905
No! No! No!

843
01:51:44,822 --> 01:51:48,659
No. To the right. To the right. To the right!

844
01:51:48,743 --> 01:51:51,204
You are a funny man, Mr Bond.

845
01:51:53,122 --> 01:51:54,624
Yeah!

846
01:51:55,833 --> 01:51:59,170
Yes, yes, yes.

847
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:10,306
Now the whole world's gonna know that you died scratching my balls.

848
01:52:11,557 --> 01:52:13,684
I died?

849
01:52:13,768 --> 01:52:15,144
-I died? -Yes.

850
01:52:15,228 --> 01:52:18,481
Because no matter what you do, I'm not gonna give you the password.

851
01:52:18,522 --> 01:52:20,316
Which means your clients will hunt you down

852
01:52:20,399 --> 01:52:23,444
and cut you into pieces of meat while you're still breathing.

853
01:52:23,486 --> 01:52:24,987
Because if you kill me

854
01:52:25,071 --> 01:52:27,156
there'll be nowhere else to hide.

855
01:52:27,365 --> 01:52:30,326
But you are so wrong!

856
01:52:30,368 --> 01:52:33,496
Because even after I slaughtered you and your little girlfriend

857
01:52:33,579 --> 01:52:36,415
your people would still welcome me with open arms

858
01:52:37,917 --> 01:52:41,587
because they need what I know.

859
01:52:42,797 --> 01:52:44,882
The big picture.

860
01:52:52,765 --> 01:52:55,142
Give me the password

861
01:52:55,184 --> 01:52:57,186
and I will at least let her live.

862
01:53:00,815 --> 01:53:03,943
Bond. Do it soon enough and she might even be in one piece.

863
01:53:16,998 --> 01:53:19,208
You really aren't going to tell me, are you?

864
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:21,085
No.

865
01:53:22,962 --> 01:53:24,880
So I think

866
01:53:29,385 --> 01:53:32,888
I'll feed you what you seem not to value.

867
01:53:45,943 --> 01:53:48,279
I'll get the money.

868
01:53:49,739 --> 01:53:51,782
Tell them I'll get the money.

869
01:53:51,866 --> 01:53:56,370
Money isn't as valuable to our organisation as knowing who to trust.

870
01:54:19,935 --> 01:54:21,395
Francesco.

871
01:54:22,271 --> 01:54:24,231
Francesco.

872
01:54:36,911 --> 01:54:39,080
Vesper.

873
01:54:40,915 --> 01:54:42,833
Vesper.

874
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,504
No.

875
01:54:47,296 --> 01:54:48,756
Not him.

876
01:54:48,798 --> 01:54:50,758
Not Mathis.

877
01:54:52,551 --> 01:54:53,761
No.

878
01:54:54,553 --> 01:54:56,639
I'll get the doctor.

879
01:54:59,350 --> 01:55:01,185
Not him.

880
01:55:03,062 --> 01:55:04,271
Any ideas?

881
01:55:07,983 --> 01:55:11,821
-What? -Why they left the two of you alive.

882
01:55:13,823 --> 01:55:15,282
Where is she?

883
01:55:16,283 --> 01:55:18,202
Sleeping.

884
01:55:18,786 --> 01:55:22,081
And I'm supposed to get you to drink this.

885
01:55:23,165 --> 01:55:24,917
It's just odd

886
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:29,046
killing everyone else but leaving you and her untouched.

887
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:32,508
Almost as if someone was trying to tell us something.

888
01:55:33,634 --> 01:55:35,803
Get a look at the killer?

889
01:55:36,303 --> 01:55:38,055
No.

890
01:55:39,515 --> 01:55:40,975
Shame.

891
01:55:42,601 --> 01:55:44,353
Drink up.

892
01:55:47,731 --> 01:55:50,025
Anything else you remember?

893
01:55:50,109 --> 01:55:52,278
Anything that can help us?

894
01:55:52,361 --> 01:55:54,029
Help us?

895
01:55:54,113 --> 01:55:56,365
Or help you?

896
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:38,073
Hello.

897
01:56:38,157 --> 01:56:40,034
Hello.

898
01:56:41,702 --> 01:56:43,579
You all right?

899
01:56:43,621 --> 01:56:45,915
I can't resist waking you.

900
01:56:45,998 --> 01:56:50,669
Every time I do, you look at me as if you haven't seen me in years.

901
01:56:51,754 --> 01:56:53,797
It makes me feel reborn.

902
01:56:57,510 --> 01:57:00,638
If you'd just been born

903
01:57:01,263 --> 01:57:03,599
wouldn't you be naked?

904
01:57:04,308 --> 01:57:06,560
You have me there.

905
01:57:09,188 --> 01:57:11,941
You can have me anywhere.

906
01:57:13,943 --> 01:57:15,611
I can?

907
01:57:15,694 --> 01:57:19,615
Yeah. Here, there, anywhere you like.

908
01:57:20,574 --> 01:57:23,619
Does this mean that you're warming to me?

909
01:57:23,661 --> 01:57:25,955
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

910
01:57:26,038 --> 01:57:27,623
It's just that not so long ago

911
01:57:27,706 --> 01:57:31,627
I would have described your feelings towards me as...

912
01:57:33,045 --> 01:57:35,714
I'm trying to think of a better word than "loathing ."

913
01:57:36,257 --> 01:57:39,635
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

914
01:57:39,677 --> 01:57:42,221
That is something to be afraid of.

915
01:57:44,974 --> 01:57:48,644
-Hello. -Oh, perfect timing.

916
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:52,898
Monsieur Mendel. How are things in Switzerland?

917
01:57:52,982 --> 01:57:55,109
My apologies, I do not mean to rush

918
01:57:55,150 --> 01:57:57,319
but 120 million is a large sum of money.

919
01:57:57,361 --> 01:58:00,322
It certainly is. You didn't bring any chocolates with you?

920
01:58:00,406 --> 01:58:02,575
I'm afraid not.

921
01:58:03,742 --> 01:58:06,662
If you would type in the account number.

922
01:58:13,669 --> 01:58:15,087
And now the password.

923
01:58:15,879 --> 01:58:17,089
You can do that.

924
01:58:17,756 --> 01:58:19,842
I would if I knew what it was.

925
01:58:20,426 --> 01:58:26,849
V-E-S-P-E-R.

926
01:58:37,651 --> 01:58:39,570
The funds have been transferred.

927
01:58:39,653 --> 01:58:42,531
Sorry for disturbing you.

928
01:58:44,366 --> 01:58:47,620
-Auf Wiedersehen. -Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

929
01:58:54,168 --> 01:58:55,586
You know, James

930
01:58:58,172 --> 01:59:01,216
I just want you to know that if all that was left of you

931
01:59:01,258 --> 01:59:04,720
was your smile and your little finger

932
01:59:04,762 --> 01:59:07,556
you'd still be more of a man than anyone I've ever met.

933
01:59:16,899 --> 01:59:20,611
That's because you know what I can do with my little finger.

934
01:59:23,447 --> 01:59:27,368
-I have no idea. -But you're aching to find out.

935
01:59:30,579 --> 01:59:34,583
You're not going to let me in there, are you?

936
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:37,544
You've got your armour back on.

937
01:59:37,586 --> 01:59:38,879
That's that.

938
01:59:40,339 --> 01:59:42,925
I have no armour left.

939
01:59:44,134 --> 01:59:46,679
You've stripped it from me.

940
01:59:47,513 --> 01:59:50,391
Whatever is left of me.

941
01:59:50,432 --> 01:59:53,352
Whatever is left of me

942
01:59:54,144 --> 01:59:56,271
whatever I am

943
01:59:56,313 --> 01:59:58,857
I'm yours.

944
02:01:00,252 --> 02:01:03,297
I suppose M won't miss me for a couple of days.

945
02:01:04,006 --> 02:01:05,966
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

946
02:01:06,049 --> 02:01:07,342
Mathis?

947
02:01:07,426 --> 02:01:09,595
Remember I told you about Le Chiffre's tell?

948
02:01:09,678 --> 02:01:12,139
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

949
02:01:12,681 --> 02:01:14,349
That's how he wiped me out.

950
02:01:14,433 --> 02:01:18,228
Same goes for the implant. Can't say I'm too sorry about losing that.

951
02:01:18,312 --> 02:01:20,647
I can't believe it.

952
02:01:20,689 --> 02:01:22,357
No, neither could I.

953
02:01:22,775 --> 02:01:25,194
I thought he had my back.

954
02:01:25,861 --> 02:01:27,696
But there you go, lesson learned.

955
02:01:29,031 --> 02:01:31,492
Does everyone have a tell?

956
02:01:33,368 --> 02:01:35,162
Yes.

957
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:40,167
Everyone.

958
02:01:40,209 --> 02:01:42,085
Everyone except you.

959
02:01:46,548 --> 02:01:48,592
I wonder if that's why I love you.

960
02:01:50,594 --> 02:01:53,013
You love me?

961
02:01:53,055 --> 02:01:55,224
Enough to quit and float round the world with you

962
02:01:55,307 --> 02:01:58,310
until one of us has to find an honest job.

963
02:01:58,393 --> 02:02:02,481
But I think that's gonna have to be you. I've no idea what an honest job is.

964
02:02:03,357 --> 02:02:04,817
You're serious.

965
02:02:05,734 --> 02:02:08,195
Like you said

966
02:02:08,237 --> 02:02:10,072
you do what I do for too long

967
02:02:10,113 --> 02:02:13,075
and there won't be any soul left to salvage.

968
02:02:13,116 --> 02:02:16,036
I'm leaving with what little I have left.

969
02:02:17,996 --> 02:02:20,123
Is that enough for you?

970
02:04:04,436 --> 02:04:06,355
-Come on. -No. No.

971
02:04:06,855 --> 02:04:10,192
No, stop it. Stop. I have to get to the bank.

972
02:04:10,233 --> 02:04:12,486
What's the time?

973
02:04:14,696 --> 02:04:16,782
How much do we need to float for a month?

974
02:04:17,199 --> 02:04:19,034
I've got plenty.

975
02:04:19,117 --> 02:04:23,080
No, I want to pay for my half of our aimless wanderings.

976
02:04:26,041 --> 02:04:28,543
You stopped wearing the necklace.

977
02:04:28,585 --> 02:04:31,880
Yeah. It was time.

978
02:04:31,964 --> 02:04:34,716
Time enough to get over someone?

979
02:04:39,471 --> 02:04:42,849
To realise sometimes you can forget the past.

980
02:04:51,566 --> 02:04:53,485
Though apparently not your employer.

981
02:04:57,906 --> 02:05:01,159
Back in one month.

982
02:05:02,202 --> 02:05:04,746
Come on. I'll get the money

983
02:05:04,788 --> 02:05:06,999
you get supplies.

984
02:05:36,611 --> 02:05:39,114
I'll see you back here in half an hour.

985
02:06:03,555 --> 02:06:06,141
-Hello, M. -I got your note.

986
02:06:06,183 --> 02:06:07,976
Yes?

987
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:09,936
We'll talk about that later.

988
02:06:10,103 --> 02:06:13,190
Right now I have a lovely man from the Treasury here

989
02:06:13,273 --> 02:06:15,901
wondering if you're ever going to deposit the winnings.

990
02:06:19,571 --> 02:06:22,532
That's a shame. I didn't think they'd miss it.

991
02:06:22,616 --> 02:06:26,036
Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.

992
02:06:26,119 --> 02:06:28,330
So you'll be depositing it today.

993
02:06:28,622 --> 02:06:31,291
On my way to the bank right now.

994
02:06:31,666 --> 02:06:34,377
James Bond for Mr Mendel.

995
02:06:34,836 --> 02:06:36,129
Hello.

996
02:06:36,171 --> 02:06:39,633
Mr Mendel? I'm having trouble accessing the funds in my account.

997
02:06:39,758 --> 02:06:41,635
It was transferred to the account number

998
02:06:41,676 --> 02:06:44,012
your company gave us, Mr Bond.

999
02:06:46,765 --> 02:06:50,185
It appears the funds are being withdrawn as we speak.

1000
02:06:52,854 --> 02:06:54,856
-Where? -The Venice branch, of course.

1001
02:06:54,898 --> 02:06:56,191
St Mark's Square.

1002
02:06:58,151 --> 02:06:59,861
Is there a problem, Mr Bond?

1003
02:09:12,911 --> 02:09:14,120
I'll kill her!

1004
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:16,331
Allow me.

1005
02:13:36,216 --> 02:13:38,218
I'm sorry, James.

1006
02:16:49,826 --> 02:16:52,704
She had a boyfriend. A French Algerian.

1007
02:16:52,787 --> 02:16:54,872
They were very much in love.

1008
02:16:55,248 --> 02:16:58,501
He was kidnapped by the organisation behind Le Chiffre.

1009
02:16:58,584 --> 02:17:03,631
And they blackmailed her, threatening to kill him unless she cooperated.

1010
02:17:03,715 --> 02:17:05,258
We should've picked up on it

1011
02:17:05,299 --> 02:17:07,677
but sometimes we're so focused on our enemies

1012
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:09,303
we forget to watch our friends.

1013
02:17:10,930 --> 02:17:13,057
How are you doing?

1014
02:17:13,141 --> 02:17:15,476
She left her cell phone.

1015
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:17,979
She must have known I'd check it.

1016
02:17:18,730 --> 02:17:20,940
She knew you were you.

1017
02:17:21,983 --> 02:17:24,318
-Well, at least this clears Mathis. -No.

1018
02:17:24,402 --> 02:17:26,154
-No? -No.

1019
02:17:26,237 --> 02:17:28,823
We just proved that she's guilty, not that he's innocent.

1020
02:17:28,865 --> 02:17:31,242
It could've been a double blind. Keep sweating him.

1021
02:17:32,076 --> 02:17:33,995
You don't trust anyone, do you, James?

1022
02:17:34,036 --> 02:17:35,705
No.

1023
02:17:36,164 --> 02:17:38,499
Then you've learnt your lesson.

1024
02:17:39,250 --> 02:17:41,502
Get back as soon as you can. We need you.

1025
02:17:42,170 --> 02:17:43,379
Will do.

1026
02:17:45,631 --> 02:17:47,133
If you do need time.

1027
02:17:47,175 --> 02:17:48,509
Why should I need more time?

1028
02:17:49,594 --> 02:17:52,889
The job's done, and the bitch is dead.

1029
02:17:53,806 --> 02:17:55,641
James

1030
02:17:56,225 --> 02:17:59,687
did you ever ask yourself why you weren't killed that night?

1031
02:18:00,229 --> 02:18:02,064
Isn't it obvious?

1032
02:18:02,148 --> 02:18:06,235
She made a deal to spare your life in exchange for the money.

1033
02:18:06,319 --> 02:18:08,529
I'm sure she hoped they would let her live.

1034
02:18:10,031 --> 02:18:13,075
But she must have known she was going to her death.

1035
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:17,205
And now we'll never know who was behind this.

1036
02:18:17,288 --> 02:18:19,874
The trail's gone cold.

1037
02:19:47,336 --> 02:19:49,380
-Hello. -Mr White?

1038
02:19:49,463 --> 02:19:51,132
We need to talk.

1039
02:19:51,173 --> 02:19:53,092
Who is this?

1040
02:20:23,331 --> 02:20:25,499
The name's Bond.

1041
02:20:25,541 --> 02:20:27,501
James Bond.

1042
02:24:30,786 --> 02:24:31,787
English - UK
