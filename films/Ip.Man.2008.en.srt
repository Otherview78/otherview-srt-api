1
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:50,208
Fo Shan's citizens were well off
and practiced kung-fu as a hobby.

2
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:55,375
Martial clubs became popular, turning Fo Shan
into a province renowned for martial arts.

3
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:00,458
Martial Arts Street in Fo Shan, 1935

4
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,167
Another competitor

5
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:23,333
Okay, let's start practicing

6
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,208
Come on, ready...

7
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,125
One...

8
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,292
Two...

9
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,750
One... two...

10
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,458
Sir, a Master Liu is looking for you

11
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,375
May I know who you are?

12
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,292
I'm the patriarch of the Liu Fist Sect

13
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,500
I just started a martial club in Fo Shan

14
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,708
Congratulations

15
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:28,750
I hear that Master Ip is a Wing Chun expert

16
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,958
I'd love to practice with you today

17
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:34,000
Can we do it some other day?

18
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,417
It's not convenient right now

19
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,292
Since I'm already here,

20
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,417
let's just play around for a bit

21
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:44,333
It's all private. No one else shall know who wins

22
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,333
It's not a matter of winning. I'm having dinner

23
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:50,292
In that case... I'll wait for you

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,292
Master Liu

25
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,208
Have you eaten yet?

26
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:06,000
Please join me

27
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:43,583
You want one?

28
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,333
No, thanks

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,417
Is the food all right tonight?

30
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,208
Very good indeed

31
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,000
That's good

32
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,208
Very quick

33
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,458
Leave it, Uncle Wang. Close the door first

34
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,708
Master Liu

35
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,292
Please!

36
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,125
Please!

37
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,000
Are you okay?

38
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,250
I'm fine...

39
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let's start again!

40
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,167
Okay, here I come

41
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,292
Touché!

42
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,208
Touché!

43
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,750
All touché!

44
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,375
Thanks for being lenient, Master Liu

45
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,750
Thanks for teaching me. I've learnt a lot

46
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,375
The pleasure was all mine

47
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,500
Regarding this private duel, Master Ip...

48
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,250
I won't tell anyone. Don't worry

49
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,500
Thanks so much. I'm totally grateful

50
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,583
Goodbye

51
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:32,292
Farewell

52
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,583
So long

53
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,500
With "Move 1000 Catties with 4 Taels"

54
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,083
Ip pushed Master Liu's whole body away

55
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,125
Isn't "Move 1000 Catties with 4 Taels" Tai Chi?

56
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:47,208
I thought Master Ip practiced Wing Chun

57
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,375
Anyway, he pushed him away with one hand

58
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,042
Liu refused to admit defeat

59
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,625
Ip kept chasing after him fiercely!

60
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,125
But Liu remained indignant after being hit

61
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,375
He jumped at Ip like a hungry dog

62
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,625
These tea leaves are pretty good and cheap

63
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,708
Thank you

64
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,375
Got to go Farewell

65
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,583
Goodbye Goodbye, see you next time

66
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,375
Who put these here, Uncle Ping?

67
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,042
Your brother

68
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,042
I thought Liu was good but he's so bad at defence

69
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,333
and was beaten up like a pighead

70
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,750
He co-owns his dad's restaurant. He's always idle

71
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,042
Ask that kid to serve the customers

72
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,000
Good morning

73
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:31,833
Brother Ip!

74
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,000
Morning, Master Ip

75
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:33,875
Is Quan here yet?

76
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,333
He's waiting for you upstairs

77
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,083
Been here long, Quan?

78
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:42,000
You're always late

79
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,042
I'm busy

80
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,333
Busy with what?

81
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,958
Drinking tea, eating, practicing

82
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,583
What else?

83
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,208
This tea smells nice

84
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,208
I'm talking about you

85
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,250
Have you ordered yet?

86
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,292
I got something to discuss with you

87
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:05,708
Let's eat first and then we'll talk

88
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,167
This just came out of the oven! Try it...

89
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,625
Heard that you had a duel with Master Liu

90
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:14,417
and had beaten him quickly. Is that true?

91
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,458
Who told you that, Lin?

92
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,417
My brother

93
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:22,083
Should've told me earlier. I'm his disciple now!

94
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,542
But you've been a disciple of every master

95
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,083
Was the duel private, Brother Ip?

96
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,375
We have things to discuss. Leave us for now

97
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,708
Then I won't disturb your private conversation

98
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,083
Good!

99
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,583
Morning, Master! Morning

100
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,417
Morning

101
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,208
Master

102
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,375
Heard that you were beaten by Ip Man

103
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,708
Everyone in Fo Shan knows about it now

104
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,250
Nonsense! Who told you that?

105
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:02,042
Yuan at the restaurant

106
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,542
Everything is costly in Fo Shan these days

107
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,667
So what?

108
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,333
That means the economy is good in Fo Shan

109
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,875
Everybody can afford to spend money

110
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:16,500
Is that so?

111
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:20,125
Clothing is the most important in our daily lives

112
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,542
There will be lots of demand for future clothing

113
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,667
I'll open a cotton mill to provide cotton for them

114
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,000
I want you to be my partner

115
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:37,542
I don't know anything about business

116
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,333
But I do

117
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:40,750
I'm not in need of money

118
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,458
Who's Yuan? Show yourself!

119
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,000
I am

120
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:52,708
You rascal. You ruined my reputation

121
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,583
I must teach you a lesson!

122
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,250
Master...

123
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,542
He's my brother. Let's talk

124
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,250
Calm down. Okay, Master?

125
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,542
Your brother? He ruined my reputation

126
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,042
He said I was beaten by Ip Man

127
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,125
What's gonna happen to my martial club?

128
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,042
Who will want to be my disciples?

129
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,208
Apologize!

130
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:13,333
I didn't do anything wrong. I told the truth!

131
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:16,292
You're bullshitting again! You... Master...

132
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,375
Master Ip is upstairs. Seek him out if you have guts!

133
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,083
What? Go!

134
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,250
Take it easy, Master...

135
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:28,542
Master...

136
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,500
Don't be angry, Master

137
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,583
I've been wronged, Master Ip

138
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,125
Master...

139
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,000
Please tell everybody

140
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,333
you've defeated Master Liu in a duel

141
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,542
Master Ip...

142
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,417
You got to clear my name

143
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,250
You liar, why're you bothering Brother Ip?

144
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,833
I'm no liar

145
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,125
I saw the duel when I was picking up my kite

146
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:04,333
Your kite was cut and fell into Brother Ip's house

147
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:08,500
You saw the whole duel between the two masters

148
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,458
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

149
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,708
That's exactly what happened

150
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,125
Even if it's true, you shouldn't have told everyone

151
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,375
You're not supposed to admit to certain things

152
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,542
What's wrong with admitting to the truth?

153
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,042
That might cause embarrassment for others

154
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,042
What embarrassment? I don't know so much

155
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,458
This is embarrassment!

156
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,042
You don't need to do that, Lin

157
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,208
Why're you laughing? You think I'm invisible?

158
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,250
Captain... it's no big deal

159
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,125
What no big deal?

160
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,208
Leave! Don't you leave!

161
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,333
Captain, it's no big deal

162
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,750
I saw everything. I'm warning you...

163
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,708
I'll nab whoever that causes trouble on my turf

164
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,167
I didn't cause any trouble

165
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,417
Someone ruined my name. I'm here to claim justice

166
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,667
What justice? I am justice

167
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,083
You hooligans are fighting all the time

168
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,667
What age are we in now?

169
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,292
Still talking about martial arts?

170
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,375
We're talking about arms and guns!

171
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,583
Guns. Got it?

172
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:31,417
You know, Captain Li...

173
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,625
We martial artists are energetic

174
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:37,208
Sometimes we might be a bit too loud

175
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,042
But that doesn't mean we're not civilized

176
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:45,042
We're civilized folks. Please don't pull the gun

177
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,625
Cut me some slack

178
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,375
Lin, set a table for Captain Li. It's on me

179
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,750
Yes... Captain Li, this way please

180
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,042
What you looking at? Get lost

181
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,542
Don't look Don't look... Get out of the way

182
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:57,792
Please

183
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:02,875
Master Liu

184
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,042
As you please

185
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,333
Why so secretive?

186
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:15,458
I'm really not good at business

187
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:22,458
Take this to set up the mill.
Pay me back if you make a profit

188
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,667
It'll be a while before I can repay you

189
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:28,542
Take your time

190
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,750
Another request: Take my son as your disciple

191
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:37,125
There're so many martial club masters. Ask them

192
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,125
None of them is better than you

193
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,542
We're similar

194
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:43,375
Brother Ip

195
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:44,458
Lin

196
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,083
Brother Quan

197
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:50,083
I learnt some new moves. Practice with me

198
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,708
You got so much time. You found your brother?

199
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,125
Let him be

200
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,250
He'll come back once he spent all his money

201
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:57,667
Let's try

202
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,417
Dad, did Uncle Ip agree?

203
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,708
Let's go watch over there

204
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,167
You draw very well, Zhun

205
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,042
What new moves have you learnt? Let's see

206
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,125
Brother Ip, my master says

207
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,042
this move is offense and defense all in one

208
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,542
Attack while defending. Defend while attacking

209
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:22,208
Aren't they the same?

210
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:24,375
Go away, ignorant kid

211
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,667
Here I come

212
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:40,250
This move attacks the midrib

213
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:43,083
Stop reciting mantra. Hit your target

214
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,208
Mom, I'm done with my drawing

215
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,750
So beautiful. Show it to Dad

216
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,042
Hit to disperse. Disperse while hitting

217
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,542
My last move was "disperse while hitting"...

218
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,625
Dad, look

219
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,083
Wait. I'm not free at the moment

220
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:57,500
You don't get it?
- No

221
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,625
Come again if you don't get it

222
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,708
Try again

223
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:04,375
Dad doesn't want to see it

224
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,333
There you go.
- What?

225
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,000
That was "disperse while hitting".
- Once more, Master Ip

226
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,250
couldn't see clearly

227
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,750
See? What you wanna see?

228
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,417
You guys fight every day. Aren't you tired?

229
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,458
You okay, Brother Ip?

230
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:34,500
Sorry, Mrs Ip

231
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,583
Goodbye, Mrs Ip

232
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,500
I wasn't talking about you

233
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,583
No, there're things to take care of at the mill

234
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:48,125
Yao

235
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,458
I gotta go, Uncle Ip

236
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:54,333
Okay, see you next time

237
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,542
Bye, Ip

238
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:06,000
Talk to me if you're not happy

239
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,167
No need to throw a tantrum

240
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,750
Okay, please take a look at your son's drawing

241
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,708
Spend more time with him instead of your pals

242
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:19,625
Let's go inside, okay?

243
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:22,375
Go

244
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,375
Brother

245
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,708
Where's the martial club street?

246
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,625
Martial club!

247
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:54,500
Go straight ahead

248
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:28,125
One, two...

249
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,250
Which martial club should we challenge first, Bro?

250
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:36,583
One... two!

251
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,042
One...

252
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,167
Back!

253
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,208
You teach martial arts here?

254
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,208
Come in if you wanna learn

255
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:45,042
Who's the patriarch?

256
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,542
I am

257
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:50,292
My name is Jin

258
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:53,250
I come here as Fo Shan is famous for martial arts

259
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,583
I'd like to practice with Fo Shan's martial artists

260
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,083
Practice?

261
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:01,250
Yes!

262
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,542
Provocation rather?

263
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm obliged

264
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,375
Okay!

265
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,042
Stand aside

266
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,125
See how I'll beat these out-of-towners!

267
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,333
Not here. Stand over there

268
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,333
What about it?

269
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,458
Wait and see!

270
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:08,333
Very good!

271
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,125
Where's your master?

272
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:23,000
Here!

273
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:15,250
You wanna hack me to death?

274
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,292
Our master is not here

275
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:55,125
Weather is so treacherous in Fo Shan these days

276
00:21:58,292 --> 00:21:59,292
Let me

277
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,708
What are you drawing, Zhun?

278
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,625
He's ignoring you. Spend more time with him

279
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:18,542
Okay

280
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,042
So early, Lin?

281
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,208
Yes

282
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,042
I'm not here to fight. Just a few words

283
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,125
What's the matter?

284
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:49,083
Some out-of-towners are provoking all the clubs

285
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,667
Their kung-fu is too good for all the masters

286
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,458
Can you look into that if you can?

287
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,000
That good?

288
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,125
Yes

289
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,292
I gotta go, Mrs Ip

290
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,208
Hang in there, Master Liu!

291
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:54,417
We depend on you, Master Liu!

292
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,458
Damn it

293
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,250
No one in Fo Shan knows martial arts at all

294
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,167
I thought everyone was Wong Fei-hong here

295
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:31,542
It turns out you are just bums

296
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,667
You can't even fight, let alone defend yourselves

297
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:36,458
Brothers, our efforts have not been wasted

298
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,625
Nobody in Fo Shan knows martial arts

299
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,458
We'll be rich this time

300
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,208
Brothers, let's keep it up

301
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:47,708
We open a club here to show them our might

302
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,375
We will be No.1 in Fo Shan!

303
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:54,583
You think you're good by beating a few nitwits

304
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,375
Wait till you beat the best

305
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,333
Who's the best in Fo Shan?

306
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:01,750
Ip Man, of course!

307
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:10,458
Go!

308
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,042
Come with us!

309
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:14,250
See how we shall defeat Ip Man

310
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:40,625
Dad, there're lots of people outside

311
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,708
What can I help you?

312
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:49,375
Sir... they...

313
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,667
Are you Ip Man?

314
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm Jin. Heard that Fo Shan's famous for kung-fu

315
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,708
I understand, Master Jin. I understand

316
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,708
You bring a crowd here to challenge me to a duel?

317
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,083
Of course

318
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,625
We're opening a club here to show our might

319
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:06,125
To open a martial club...

320
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,417
you need a good site. No need to fight with me

321
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,333
Please leave!

322
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,750
Uncle Wang, take Zhun inside

323
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,333
Ip Man!

324
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:24,208
Don't dillydally. Are you scared?

325
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,292
You think our house is a martial club?

326
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:31,292
Who's going to fight with you? Get lost!

327
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,625
You heard that. I won't fight with you

328
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:35,417
Please leave immediately

329
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,750
I heard Wing Chun was invented by a woman

330
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,000
That suits you just right

331
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,750
Are you afraid of your wife, Ip?

332
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,125
No men are afraid of their wives

333
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,458
There're only men who respect their wives

334
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:54,375
Don't worry, Mrs Ip. I won't beat him to death

335
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:59,708
If you fear he'll lose, I'll use only one hand

336
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:03,208
If that's not enough, I can use no hands at all

337
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,667
Fight with him, Master Ip! Beat him up!

338
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,625
I'm too disappointed by Fo Shan. Damn it!

339
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:10,708
So many martial artists but none of them good

340
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:11,625
Shut up!

341
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:16,583
Don't break my things

342
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,708
Get out of my way!

343
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,375
You rascals

344
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:36,500
You come at the right time

345
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:39,708
This place is small. Please get outside

346
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,208
and close the door on your way out

347
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,000
You have to redeem our honor

348
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,458
Ask them to leave. Hurry up!

349
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,542
Can I just watch?

350
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,458
Get out

351
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:02,750
Hurry up! Get out!

352
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,083
Get out! Get out!

353
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:17,042
Wing Chun, Ip Man

354
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,375
I really wanna see...

355
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:24,375
how a man can fight like a woman

356
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:30,667
Good kung-fu does not depend on age or sex

357
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,000
but on how well you fight. You will know later

358
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,042
I'll pay!

359
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:15,375
Good!

360
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:34,208
I'll pay!

361
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,542
Dad, Mom said if you don't start fighting

362
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:45,667
everything in the house will be broken

363
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,167
Okay

364
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,042
Little rogue

365
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:53,792
Mind you language

366
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:32,542
Bro...

367
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:33,833
Bro...

368
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,583
You all right, Master Jin?

369
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:43,375
I'm fine!

370
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
How about that, Master Jin?

371
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,500
My kung-fu isn't too bad, eh?

372
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:15,625
That's enough

373
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:20,458
My northern boxing has lost to your southern one

374
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,667
No, it's not a matter of northern or southern style

375
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,458
The problem is you

376
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:35,542
So who won?

377
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:39,708
Look how depressed he is. He must have lost

378
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,500
Get lost! Go back to your hometown!

379
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:45,625
Get lost, you out-of-towners!

380
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,833
Master! You fought very well, Ip!

381
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:54,167
You've redeemed the honor of our martial clubs

382
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:55,417
I was just lucky...

383
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:58,208
Don't be modest. You are Canton's treasure!

384
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:03,750
Thank you

385
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:05,667
Take a look. It's imported

386
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,333
Master Ip, flowers for your wife Thanks

387
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:08,750
How much, boss?

388
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,167
On the house, Master Ip

389
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,125
I can't let you pay. You saved our honor

390
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,500
How can that be?

391
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:14,708
You're running a business

392
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,042
Don't stand on ceremonies. Next time

393
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:17,292
Okay, next time

394
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,708
Fruits, Master Ip

395
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:20,750
You're too kind. I can't For the kid

396
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,167
Thank you Please come again. Goodbye

397
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,583
Buddy

398
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,375
Say thank you Take this

399
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:28,458
Thank you You're welcome... Farewell

400
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,083
How are you, Master Ip?

401
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:31,042
How are you?

402
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,042
How are you, Master Ip?

403
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,333
That isn't bad at all

404
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:35,708
Yes, this is the best in our shop

405
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:36,875
Really?

406
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:40,333
It's our honor if it can be placed in your house

407
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:41,417
Thank you

408
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,375
What's the occasion?

409
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,333
Uncle Man. Auntie

410
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:48,833
You plan on opening a martial club...

411
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,833
why didn't you inform me first?

412
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,042
When did I say that?

413
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:54,792
Everybody in Fo Shan knows about it

414
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,292
Everybody in Fo Shan but me

415
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:00,208
Let me help you, Uncle Man

416
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:06,500
Please accept me as your disciple, Master Ip

417
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,542
Master. Madam

418
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:09,625
Bro

419
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,375
You must be the one spreading the rumor

420
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:13,292
Keep order for me

421
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:16,500
Come. Go yourself

422
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:21,458
I don't care. Yao has to be your first disciple

423
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,208
Come on. You've known me long enough

424
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:25,667
I don't like having disciples

425
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,458
Be quiet

426
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:29,083
Stay in order

427
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:33,667
Stay in order and hail: Master Ip! Master Ip...

428
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:49,542
Master Ip! Master Ip...

429
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:00,708
On July 7, 1937, the Marco Polo Incident broke out.
Japan invaded China,

430
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:02,625
robbing its people of their livelihood and causing
rampant starvation all over the country.

431
00:35:57,417 --> 00:36:00,042
In October, 1938,
Fo Shan was occupied by the Japanese army...

432
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,542
...who destroyed factories,
infrastructures and buildings.

433
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:07,333
The population of Fo Shan shrunk
from more than 300,000 to just over 70,000.

434
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:12,250
Only a dozen factories in the whole city
remained in operation still.

435
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:25,542
Ip's residence was also confiscated and
turned into the headquarters of the Japanese army.

436
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:29,458
Ip's family was rendered homeless,
living an abject existence.

437
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,667
Cheng, I'll step out for a sec. Will be right back

438
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,167
Wait

439
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:49,917
It's cold outside. Wear a jacket

440
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,833
Hurry up. Me this side, you that side

441
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,708
Be careful, Zhun. Don't hurt others

442
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:33,167
I'll give you more, Master Ip

443
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:34,542
Thank you

444
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,375
Don't push! One by one

445
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:39,500
Don't push

446
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:41,417
One by one

447
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:46,542
You get out of the way!

448
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:07,042
The mill may be old but it's still productive

449
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,208
Fo Shan is very chaotic these days

450
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:16,750
You left already. Why did you come back?

451
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,667
Who's going to feed the workers otherwise?

452
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,542
All my money is invested in this mill

453
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,375
I can't pay you back for now

454
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:29,625
Don't worry. I almost forgot

455
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,458
No, I'll consider you a shareholder then

456
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:33,625
Let me calculate...

457
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,792
you should have ten percent shares

458
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,333
It's really unnecessary

459
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,625
Stay and help out, now that you own it too

460
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:44,833
Uncle Ip

461
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:46,167
Yao

462
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,833
You'll be helping out? That's great!

463
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,833
Everyone will be lively under your leadership

464
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,250
And I can watch you practice Wing Chun

465
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:55,542
Ip, stay for lunch. It's lunchtime for the workers

466
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:57,667
Yes, let's have lunch together

467
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,375
No, thanks

468
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,833
I'm not free. Next time

469
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:04,292
Goodbye

470
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,375
Dad, why didn't you ask Uncle Ip to stay?

471
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:20,333
He doesn't like to owe people favors

472
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:31,208
Dad, you used to practice martial arts, right?

473
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:33,208
Why did you stop?

474
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:35,792
I get hungry when I exercise

475
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,083
So I need to exercise less, okay?

476
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:42,167
Got it. I won't play outside from now on

477
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:46,208
You'll only stop playing today. Go eat

478
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,208
Hurry up and eat

479
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:58,333
This congee is a bit too thick

480
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,375
But you need to eat some

481
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:09,417
Be careful it's hot

482
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,083
How much rice is left at home?

483
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:21,333
Don't worry

484
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:31,333
I've pawned everything worth pawning

485
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:36,375
I am strong. I can look for a job

486
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:37,667
It's not the end of the world

487
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:40,708
You look for a job?

488
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,375
I didn't need to work. But it's different now

489
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:47,667
There's always a first time

490
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,542
We have enough people here

491
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:56,292
We don't need to hire more. Sorry

492
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,208
Boss, are you hiring?

493
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,458
No

494
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:03,667
Thank you

495
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:09,708
You want to hire me, Boss...

496
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:11,167
Boss...

497
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:13,792
You, you, you... Come up here...

498
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,167
You want to hire me, Boss...

499
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:16,583
Here

500
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,208
You're looking for a job, Master Ip?

501
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:23,333
Come, come up...

502
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,167
Thank you

503
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,208
Brother Ip!

504
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:04,667
You can't dress like that to work

505
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,292
I didn't expect to pour coals here

506
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,542
How are you, Master Ip?

507
00:43:10,792 --> 00:43:11,833
How are you?

508
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:14,708
How are you, Master Ip?

509
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,042
So many martial club masters here?

510
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:23,458
The boss here used to practice martial arts too

511
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:27,125
That's why he likes to employ martial artists

512
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:29,667
By the way, are you still practicing?

513
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:34,042
I'd rather used my time to scrape a living

514
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:55,333
I can't finish it all. Help me, okay?

515
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,542
Eat some

516
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,125
How're your wife and son?

517
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:08,333
They're fine. Thank you

518
00:44:11,417 --> 00:44:13,250
Did you find your brother?

519
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,542
I couldn't locate him since he left

520
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:17,042
Don't know if he's still alive

521
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:20,542
I don't even have the chance to say sorry

522
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,542
What have you lost?

523
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,542
I lost an iron box

524
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:32,750
What iron box?

525
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:34,833
Japanese solders are coming!

526
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:56,250
Dear workers

527
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:58,750
This is Colonel Sato

528
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:02,167
He appreciates Chinese martial arts

529
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:04,583
He knows Fo Shan is famous for martial arts

530
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:09,208
He wants to find Chinese martial artists
to fight with the Japanese

531
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,583
Would anyone want to go?

532
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,417
Would anyone want to go?

533
00:45:17,792 --> 00:45:19,042
Would anyone want to go?

534
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:26,792
Master?

535
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:33,667
You want us to be sandbags?

536
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,083
There's no door, I tell you!

537
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,750
Airhead

538
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:41,500
Whoever that wins will get one sack of rice

539
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:48,125
Whoever that wins will get one sack of rice

540
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,417
I'll go!

541
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,375
Lin...

542
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,125
Don't get into trouble

543
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,375
I'm going too! Me too!

544
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:59,208
They took all our rice. Now I can get them back

545
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:00,792
The world is fair

546
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:06,208
Forget it

547
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,167
Help me find the iron box

548
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,458
Let's go. It's okay. Come

549
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:16,417
Be careful

550
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:17,792
Come, let's line up

551
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:19,167
Come, come, come...

552
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:21,583
Anything else?

553
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,083
No, let's go Yes!

554
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,167
Master?

555
00:46:57,542 --> 00:46:58,417
General

556
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:32,208
Thank you, General!

557
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,292
Got to beat them all

558
00:47:48,292 --> 00:47:50,708
Let me join in the fun

559
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:56,083
They're not good enough for General Miura

560
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,708
I'll show the Chinese what Japanese kung-fu's like

561
00:48:01,542 --> 00:48:04,583
Find three men to fight with me

562
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:08,542
Give them rice even if they lose

563
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:10,500
Yes, sir!

564
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,292
I've done you a favor again

565
00:48:15,583 --> 00:48:18,667
General Miura will fight with three of you

566
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:23,042
You can get rice whether you win or not

567
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:25,542
The rice is not important. I just wanna beat them

568
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:27,375
Who will be going?

569
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:29,083
I will...

570
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,208
Let go of me... Stop shouting!

571
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:34,042
Lin, you and you... The three of you

572
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:34,958
Okay!

573
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:36,083
You've spit blood. Stop fighting

574
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:38,625
We've lost

575
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:42,417
General, they admitted defeat

576
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,083
Your really wanna die?

577
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:16,750
You asshole!

578
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,542
Lin, how are you? Lin...

579
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:37,542
Lin...

580
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,292
Were you tired today?

581
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,375
Pouring coal is not tiring at all

582
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,167
I saw Lin today

583
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:05,333
Really? How is he?

584
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:06,583
Not bad

585
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:09,792
I didn't expect to see him again

586
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,417
Master Li, Master Hong

587
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:37,500
Master Ip

588
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:39,125
Did you see Lin?

589
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,208
Lin? No

590
00:51:41,542 --> 00:51:42,583
No, I didn't

591
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:44,292
Let's eat first

592
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,583
Lots of us received rice yesterday

593
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:07,458
General Miura was very satisfied.
Anybody wants to go today?

594
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,500
Anybody? Li...

595
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:13,250
Li...

596
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:14,667
Where's Lin?

597
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:18,250
Anybody wants to go?

598
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:20,250
I'm asking you. Where's Lin?

599
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:22,125
I don't know

600
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,333
Of course you do. You took him away

601
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:27,417
Anybody wants to go?

602
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:29,417
You'll get rice if you win

603
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:30,375
Me!

604
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:32,333
If Master Ip is going, I'll go too!

605
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:33,583
Me too!

606
00:52:33,792 --> 00:52:35,708
I wanna have a good fight with the Japanese

607
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,417
Anything else I can do?

608
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,083
No, you can go

609
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:12,292
Thanks

610
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:16,833
Can I fight three more people?

611
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:22,542
He said he wanted to fight three more people

612
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:37,750
That's it for me...

613
00:54:58,458 --> 00:54:59,625
Why did you open fire?

614
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,167
Li! Why did you open fire?

615
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,125
Li! Why did you open fire?

616
00:55:09,292 --> 00:55:11,500
Who let you open fire?

617
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:18,625
He took the rice even though he's lost

618
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,542
so... I wanted to teach him a lesson

619
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:28,542
This place is for tournaments only

620
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:41,625
Never open fire here anymore

621
00:55:43,417 --> 00:55:44,667
Got it!

622
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:53,583
Please calm down, General Miura

623
00:55:54,542 --> 00:55:56,708
I'll arrange the next tournament for you

624
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:01,167
Continue!

625
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:17,250
Who else wants to fight?

626
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:18,292
Me!

627
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,208
Li! Open the gate!

628
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,375
Master... Open the gate!

629
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,750
Tell me, was Lin beaten to death?

630
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:38,458
Open the gate

631
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:39,542
Master...

632
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:40,458
Open the gate!

633
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:44,208
Please open the gate

634
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:01,042
I wanna fight ten people!

635
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,208
You crazy? Please don't

636
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:04,542
I wanna fight ten people!

637
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:14,833
He said he wanted to fight ten people

638
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:23,667
Ten?

639
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,250
Yes

640
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:30,333
Let's see how good he is

641
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:36,083
Unit 5!

642
00:57:37,125 --> 00:57:39,542
Unit 1, Unit 3, Unit 5

643
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:41,458
Start!

644
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:46,375
Be careful

645
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,208
Stay back!

646
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:45,375
Come back again

647
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:47,458
He wants you to come back again

648
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:51,083
I'm not here for the rice

649
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,750
He said... he would come back

650
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:02,750
What's your name?

651
01:01:03,417 --> 01:01:04,375
He wants to know your name

652
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,542
I'm just a Chinese

653
01:01:16,625 --> 01:01:19,042
His name is Ip Man

654
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,833
Be careful in the future

655
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:55,708
I don't know what Miura might do

656
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:01,625
Lackey!

657
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:04,500
Why am I a lackey?

658
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:09,167
Their deaths got nothing to do with me.
I'm just an interpreter

659
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:11,667
I need to scrape a living too!

660
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:13,292
Scrape a living?

661
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:17,333
You watch your countrymen get beaten to death.
Where's your dignity?

662
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:22,625
I don't have any

663
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:24,417
You do. You have lots of it

664
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:27,167
If you have the guts, go beat them up!

665
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:29,292
Beat as many as you can!

666
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:32,583
I'm an interpreter, not a lackey...

667
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,542
I'm a Chinese!

668
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,250
I'm back

669
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:34,417
Daddy

670
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,458
You're back?

671
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:38,333
Have you been good?

672
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:39,208
Yes

673
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:40,833
Good boy

674
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,333
Are you tired today?

675
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,333
Go wash your face first

676
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:11,042
You're so good

677
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:22,333
I realized today I'm useless

678
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,458
I can't do anything

679
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:36,167
I practiced marital arts before

680
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:39,833
But so what?

681
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:47,708
This world...

682
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:54,667
is minuscule

683
01:05:58,375 --> 01:05:59,625
I'm so useless

684
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,083
I don't care what the world is like

685
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:08,333
I only know I'm very happy now

686
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:14,625
As long as you, me, and Zhun...

687
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:19,125
can stay together, everything will be okay

688
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:24,792
It's essential for a family to stay together

689
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,208
Get off! Get off!

690
01:06:58,792 --> 01:07:00,417
Get off...

691
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:02,458
Stand over there! On the side!

692
01:07:02,542 --> 01:07:03,583
Stand over there...

693
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:30,125
Who's the boss? Come out!

694
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:35,667
I am

695
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:49,167
I just took your goods. You can buy them back

696
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:50,458
Is that okay?

697
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:52,583
I don't have money

698
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:56,125
Don't beat my dad anymore!

699
01:07:58,542 --> 01:07:59,542
Wing Chun?

700
01:08:04,708 --> 01:08:05,792
Damn it! Wing Chun?

701
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:07,375
Don't beat him!

702
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:11,917
Do you have money?

703
01:08:12,708 --> 01:08:13,375
I don't

704
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:14,167
Do you?

705
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,167
No...

706
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:17,292
I'll keep beating you till you have!

707
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:26,083
The goods haven't been sold...

708
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:28,708
I don't have money

709
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,375
Uncle Ip! Uncle Ip...

710
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:38,417
Please save my dad. He's almost beaten to death

711
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:39,792
What's the matter, Yao?

712
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:40,583
Auntie

713
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:42,375
Let me go see what happens. It's okay

714
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:55,542
I'm very reasonable

715
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:57,750
It's fine if you don't have money now

716
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:00,292
I'll give you some time to raise it

717
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:02,167
As for the goods, I'll keep them for now

718
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:21,667
Master Ip

719
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:26,208
Dad, are you okay?

720
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,833
I'm fine. Go help Uncle Fu

721
01:09:48,125 --> 01:09:49,208
How can I help?

722
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:53,833
I thought your martial arts were impractical

723
01:09:54,542 --> 01:09:56,042
Now I know it's very useful

724
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,208
I should've learnt some martial arts from you

725
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,750
At least I can defend myself

726
01:10:03,292 --> 01:10:06,167
Uncle Ip, please stay and teach us martial arts

727
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:09,208
so that we can defend ourselves

728
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:12,042
Master Ip

729
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:16,042
You're such an expert. Please teach us

730
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:20,208
Yes, Master Ip. Please teach us

731
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:25,500
I'm a businessman

732
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:28,667
I know nothing other than running a business

733
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:32,250
I can't protect them, but you can

734
01:10:34,417 --> 01:10:36,750
In peaceful days, it's okay if you refused to teach

735
01:10:37,792 --> 01:10:41,625
But in bad times now, shouldn't you do something?

736
01:10:45,167 --> 01:10:46,542
Teaching martial arts is very costly

737
01:10:47,667 --> 01:10:50,792
Are you paying their fees? You owe me again?

738
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:59,792
Uncle Ip, I'll be your first disciple

739
01:12:15,667 --> 01:12:17,333
Dad, I wanna be taller

740
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:19,042
Taller?

741
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:34,333
Why hasn't Ip Man come back?

742
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:40,667
I... I don't know...

743
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:43,125
Find him

744
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:50,333
I don't know where he is

745
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,708
I don't know howto find him

746
01:12:52,042 --> 01:12:53,375
How big is Fo Shan?

747
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:55,708
How difficult can it be to find him?

748
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:01,208
Fo Shan is indeed very big

749
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:07,833
No...

750
01:13:09,292 --> 01:13:10,208
Please don't...

751
01:13:14,417 --> 01:13:16,333
I really don't know where he is...

752
01:13:20,042 --> 01:13:21,542
Useless thing! Enough!

753
01:13:28,542 --> 01:13:29,375
Asshole!

754
01:13:29,792 --> 01:13:31,333
Paper, stone, scissors!

755
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:34,042
You lost You colluded?

756
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:37,333
Hide well

757
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:41,208
10, 9, 8, 7...

758
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,250
Zhun

759
01:13:43,292 --> 01:13:43,708
That way

760
01:13:43,708 --> 01:13:45,667
3, 2, 1

761
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:48,750
I'm coming. I'll find you guys

762
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:53,292
Master

763
01:13:53,667 --> 01:13:54,375
What're you here for?

764
01:13:57,042 --> 01:13:58,292
Miura wants you to go back and fight him

765
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:02,500
Go away

766
01:14:04,667 --> 01:14:05,417
I can't

767
01:14:21,292 --> 01:14:22,083
Why not?

768
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,417
Why not? What do you want?

769
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:27,375
What do you want?

770
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:34,208
How pretty!

771
01:14:55,042 --> 01:14:55,750
Shit

772
01:14:58,083 --> 01:15:00,375
Let's go. It's not safe here

773
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:21,500
Let's go, Cheng

774
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:30,125
Li

775
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:52,208
You're a piece of shit!

776
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:54,750
How could you let Ip run away?

777
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:56,500
I'm sorry...

778
01:15:58,208 --> 01:16:01,625
Even Colonel Sato could not stop him...

779
01:16:02,167 --> 01:16:09,167
I've tried my best already...

780
01:16:10,458 --> 01:16:11,375
Sorry

781
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:12,500
Shut up!

782
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:15,542
Utterly useless!

783
01:16:17,292 --> 01:16:18,375
Tell them...

784
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,833
to dig Ip out! This is an order

785
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:25,917
Yes, sir

786
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:41,375
Little Sis

787
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:47,792
Brother, eat something

788
01:16:56,833 --> 01:16:57,625
How's the master?

789
01:16:58,208 --> 01:16:59,708
Okay. They are all fine

790
01:17:06,542 --> 01:17:07,417
Master

791
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:08,833
Coming

792
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:13,625
Madam

793
01:17:15,458 --> 01:17:16,542
See if it fits?

794
01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:20,333
So are you well adapted here?

795
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:22,167
Yes

796
01:17:22,542 --> 01:17:23,667
That's good

797
01:17:24,083 --> 01:17:25,333
I'll let you know when the meal is ready

798
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:27,208
Li...

799
01:17:31,292 --> 01:17:32,167
I'm fine

800
01:17:34,458 --> 01:17:35,542
I really don't know what to say

801
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:38,500
Thank you

802
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:41,042
It's okay

803
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,167
We better leave Fo Shan as soon as possible

804
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:09,833
Quan is trying to find a solution for us

805
01:18:10,375 --> 01:18:11,292
Where shall we go?

806
01:18:12,042 --> 01:18:12,750
Hong Kong

807
01:18:13,667 --> 01:18:15,667
In fact, it doesn't matter where

808
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,542
I still have some friends in Hong Kong

809
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:26,083
If something happens to me...

810
01:18:27,042 --> 01:18:28,125
What can happen to you?

811
01:18:29,458 --> 01:18:30,667
Nothing will happen to you

812
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,292
They are here again! Let's scram!

813
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,417
They are here! They are here!

814
01:19:03,292 --> 01:19:05,333
Is the money ready?

815
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:07,167
We won't give you money!

816
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:10,250
What did you say?

817
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,750
I'm not afraid of you! You can't bully us!

818
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:18,333
You want me to beat you up?

819
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:26,500
Damn it! Whoever dares to resist...

820
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:28,125
just beat him up!

821
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,500
Stop it!

822
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:32,375
No wonder they dare to resist

823
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:34,750
They've found a bodyguard

824
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:38,417
You spurned me for opening a club in Fo Shan

825
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:42,208
And today, you wanna mess with me again?

826
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:45,458
You wanna chase me away?

827
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:47,167
No one wanna chase you away

828
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:51,375
Ip, have you ever been hungry every day?

829
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:55,375
Everybody is hungry nowadays

830
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:59,708
The first day I came to Fo Shan, I told myself...

831
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:02,500
I would never be hungry again

832
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:05,167
I will never be hungry again!

833
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:06,500
Keep beating!

834
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:15,542
Beat them!

835
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,417
Yuan, why you still idling here? Go!

836
01:22:25,292 --> 01:22:26,208
Kill them!

837
01:22:28,708 --> 01:22:29,708
Kill them!

838
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,708
Go

839
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,667
How can we get near him?

840
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:39,833
Let's go!

841
01:23:43,542 --> 01:23:45,167
Master, you were so good!

842
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:55,792
Yuan

843
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:00,167
Stop there!

844
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,167
You know what you're doing?

845
01:24:10,375 --> 01:24:12,125
I know. I'm a robber

846
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:14,333
You're robbing the Chinese

847
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:16,708
I'd rather be the bully than the bullied

848
01:24:17,042 --> 01:24:18,125
I want everyone to be scared of me!

849
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:24,083
Your brother asked me to give this...
Don't talk about him!

850
01:24:29,167 --> 01:24:30,333
You know your brother is dead?

851
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:32,625
He's beaten to death by the Japanese

852
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:44,167
He looked for you everywhere but couldn't find you

853
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:51,125
Everyone needs to choose his own path

854
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:02,875
Master

855
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:07,208
That guy told Miura you're at the cotton mill

856
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:08,625
Don't go back, ok?

857
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:12,083
I gotta go. Remember, don't go back

858
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:49,500
Scram! Hurry up!

859
01:26:51,292 --> 01:26:52,458
Where's Ip Man?

860
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,125
Where's Ip Man? Tell me!

861
01:26:57,708 --> 01:26:59,333
Don't say a word

862
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:03,667
You, come here

863
01:27:06,417 --> 01:27:07,792
Where's Ip Man?

864
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:10,542
Tell me!

865
01:27:11,625 --> 01:27:13,208
I'm asking you!

866
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:14,833
Hang in there. I'll figure out something

867
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:17,042
Speak!

868
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:19,125
Speak! Speak up...

869
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:22,167
I'm here! I'm Ip Man...

870
01:27:22,708 --> 01:27:24,333
I'm here... Li!

871
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:27,250
Wait! Wait!

872
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:29,167
Please wait!

873
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:32,458
Li, tell Miura the workers are innocent

874
01:27:33,167 --> 01:27:34,667
Ask Miura to release them

875
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:36,333
I told you not to come back. Why did you?

876
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:37,375
Tell him!

877
01:27:37,542 --> 01:27:38,750
Shit!

878
01:27:43,167 --> 01:27:44,083
Sato!

879
01:27:47,708 --> 01:27:51,417
He dares to hit me... Can't we put him to death?

880
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,708
I know what I'm doing

881
01:27:53,542 --> 01:27:54,667
Li Yes

882
01:27:56,458 --> 01:28:00,792
Since the day you resisted the Japanese army

883
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:04,250
you've already been a dead man

884
01:28:05,208 --> 01:28:10,167
But you're talented, you can be useful to us

885
01:28:10,583 --> 01:28:20,083
So I'll give you one chance to be loyal
to the Japanese Emperor

886
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:24,208
Teach our army Chinese kung-fu

887
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:28,625
That way, we might still spare your life

888
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:34,167
He wanted you to teach the Japanese kung-fu

889
01:28:36,375 --> 01:28:37,833
I won't teach the Japanese

890
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:42,708
You wanna see me fight? I'll fight with you

891
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:54,167
He said he would think about it

892
01:28:54,292 --> 01:28:59,833
He wants to have a duel with General Miura

893
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:03,417
Take him away!

894
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:05,667
Take him away!

895
01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:14,792
Quan, take my wife and kid away from Fo Shan

896
01:29:16,667 --> 01:29:20,667
Master Ip...

897
01:29:25,667 --> 01:29:28,667
General, you really wanna fight with Ip?

898
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:30,250
Of course

899
01:29:30,792 --> 01:29:32,833
He's an expert

900
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:34,875
But he doesn't look like...

901
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:38,375
he wants to teach the Imperial Army

902
01:29:38,708 --> 01:29:42,208
He must have other motives trying to fight with you

903
01:29:42,667 --> 01:29:46,333
General, don't fight with him

904
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:49,708
Let me simply shoot him dead

905
01:29:54,292 --> 01:30:00,500
He challenges me to a fight

906
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:04,167
because he thinks he's better than me

907
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:08,500
If I refuse to accept the challenge

908
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:15,667
but shoot him instead...

909
01:30:21,417 --> 01:30:24,167
isn't that the same as admitting defeat?

910
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:27,333
Fighting with a Chinese

911
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:31,250
is not just a matter of personal honor for you

912
01:30:31,583 --> 01:30:35,458
It has to do with the national honor of our Empire

913
01:30:35,542 --> 01:30:37,667
Are you saying I will lose?

914
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:41,458
I only fear for the worst

915
01:30:41,667 --> 01:30:43,333
I will win for sure

916
01:30:44,292 --> 01:30:46,500
I'll let the whole China know I've won

917
01:30:47,458 --> 01:30:50,167
Yes! I understand!

918
01:31:26,667 --> 01:31:32,625
I want you to teach us instead of killing you

919
01:31:34,083 --> 01:31:35,708
because I appreciate your talent

920
01:31:35,833 --> 01:31:42,333
But I don't think Chinese kung-fu
is better than Japanese

921
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:48,375
We will fight in front of everybody

922
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:51,417
That's why we need a fain' tournament

923
01:31:53,292 --> 01:31:57,625
You invaded our country and killed our people

924
01:32:01,792 --> 01:32:03,542
Stop being hypocritical

925
01:32:07,458 --> 01:32:08,500
Excuse me

926
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,458
Let go of me! Let me go back! Let go of my mom...

927
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:30,667
I promised Ip nothing would happen to you

928
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:32,500
It's too dangerous to go back

929
01:32:39,708 --> 01:32:41,417
I heard the Japanese are fighting the Chinese

930
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,708
Who's fighting? Ip Man

931
01:32:42,792 --> 01:32:44,500
Look, the whole place is sealed up now

932
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:52,750
In the past...

933
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:56,375
I wished he could be with me every day

934
01:32:58,375 --> 01:33:00,625
So I always complained about his practice

935
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:05,417
Every time he had a duel with someone...

936
01:33:06,667 --> 01:33:08,167
I would throw a tantrum

937
01:33:11,292 --> 01:33:14,542
I never truly supported him

938
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:17,083
doing what he liked

939
01:33:18,458 --> 01:33:19,375
Now...

940
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:23,417
This could be his last duel

941
01:33:26,542 --> 01:33:29,333
I fear there won't be another chance

942
01:33:30,292 --> 01:33:32,833
Why don't you give me this chance?

943
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:35,167
Why?

944
01:33:43,542 --> 01:33:44,500
General Miura says...

945
01:33:46,208 --> 01:33:47,833
For the sake of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange,

946
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:51,375
he is having a fain' tournament with Master Ip today

947
01:33:52,292 --> 01:33:55,375
to share their knowledge in a friendly manner,

948
01:33:56,292 --> 01:33:57,708
and to bring true peace between the two countries

949
01:33:58,542 --> 01:34:00,708
Fain' tournament? Is it possible?

950
01:34:02,792 --> 01:34:05,542
That traitor will surely be killed by the Japanese

951
01:34:05,667 --> 01:34:07,125
That's right

952
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,417
Shut up!

953
01:34:15,542 --> 01:34:16,500
Here comes Master Ip!

954
01:34:27,833 --> 01:34:31,750
General Miura talked about a tournament

955
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:33,833
But I don't give a damn!

956
01:34:34,458 --> 01:34:35,583
Listen up

957
01:34:36,083 --> 01:34:40,167
If you win

958
01:34:40,667 --> 01:34:43,542
I will kill you

959
01:34:43,667 --> 01:34:44,542
Remember this!

960
01:34:44,625 --> 01:34:45,375
Yes!

961
01:34:48,375 --> 01:34:50,083
You better let Miura win later

962
01:34:50,708 --> 01:34:52,292
Or he won't let you live

963
01:34:54,792 --> 01:34:56,333
It's more important to stay alive

964
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:01,708
Although martial arts involves armed forces

965
01:35:02,542 --> 01:35:05,542
Chinese martial arts is Confucian in spirit

966
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:08,750
The virtue of martial arts is benevolence

967
01:35:09,542 --> 01:35:12,708
You Japanese will never understand the principle
of treating other people as you would yourselves

968
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,292
Because you abuse military power

969
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:17,333
You turned it into violence to oppress others

970
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:20,500
You don't deserve to learn Chinese martial arts

971
01:38:51,375 --> 01:39:14,333
Ip Man! Ip Man!

972
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:41,708
Ip Man refused to be subjugated by the Japanese army...

973
01:41:42,125 --> 01:41:47,375
...and used his fists to call forth
the unity of the Chinese people.

974
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:54,625
Assisted by his good friend Zhou Qingquan,

975
01:41:54,833 --> 01:42:00,292
the wounded Ip Man successfully
fled Fo Shan with his wife and son.

976
01:42:06,208 --> 01:42:09,333
On August 15, 1945,

977
01:42:09,792 --> 01:42:13,542
Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced
that Japan would surrender unconditionally.

978
01:42:13,625 --> 01:42:19,333
The Chinese finally won and
ended a war that lasted eight long years.

979
01:42:22,542 --> 01:42:25,833
In 1949, the Grandmaster Ip Man settled in Hong Kong.

980
01:42:26,417 --> 01:42:31,708
He started his first Wing Chun class at
Kowloon Hotel's Staff Association Headquarters,

981
01:42:31,833 --> 01:42:35,375
turning a new leaf in his life.

982
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:38,833
In 1967, Grandmaster Ip Man started
the Wing Chun Athletic Association to foster...

983
01:42:39,208 --> 01:42:41,583
...the spirit of Wing Chun
with a group of like-minded enthusiasts,

984
01:42:41,708 --> 01:42:46,333
fulfilling the most cherished dream of his later years.

985
01:42:48,417 --> 01:42:53,417
Since then, Wing Chun has become a world
renowned branch of Chinese martial arts.

986
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:59,750
The lineage of Grandmaster Ip Man's disciples
exceeds 2 million people.

987
01:43:00,542 --> 01:43:06,667
There are a lot of talented people among his disciples,

988
01:43:07,542 --> 01:43:17,667
including the most illustrious action star of all,
Bruce Lee.
