1
00:00:57,886 --> 00:00:59,679
Doctor, get back in the car!

2
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:01,515
No! No.

3
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:03,892
I'm still gonna blow
this motherfucker's brains out.

4
00:01:05,268 --> 00:01:07,938
Mom! Mom!

5
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,981
Help!

6
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:21,576
Pick up.

7
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:24,287
Pick up.

8
00:01:25,497 --> 00:01:26,873
Dude, where are you?

9
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:28,208
OSCAR Hey there, sassy lovers.

10
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,876
- This is Oscar.
- Damn it.

11
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:31,545
I am unable to take
your call right now

12
00:01:31,586 --> 00:01:33,088
because I'm standing right...

13
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,548
behind you!

14
00:01:34,589 --> 00:01:37,801
Hey, Oscar, uh, call me
wh-when you get this.

15
00:01:37,843 --> 00:01:41,263
Um, I messed up
with Allyson, man.

16
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:43,890
I got to find her and, uh,
fix it somehow,

17
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:46,351
so, uh, if you know where she is

18
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:49,104
or if you guys are together,
let me know.

19
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:52,149
All right. Be safe. Bye.

20
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:57,696
Damn it!

21
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:06,204
Dude, you okay?

22
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:10,125
Hey! You okay?

23
00:02:12,294 --> 00:02:14,004
Hey.

24
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:18,967
Hey, man, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

25
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,802
Oh, no.

26
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:22,804
Oh, my God. Okay.

27
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:25,974
Okay.

28
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:28,810
Help! Help!

29
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:30,896
Oh, shit. Help!

30
00:02:30,937 --> 00:02:32,773
Somebody help!

31
00:02:32,814 --> 00:02:34,274
Okay, okay.

32
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:35,400
All right.

33
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:38,779
All right.
Um, okay, okay, okay.

34
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:42,657
Okay. All right, man.

35
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:44,618
Come on. Come on,
look at me, look at me.

36
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:45,911
Stay with me, stay with me.

37
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:47,287
Hawkins, Officer Hawkins.

38
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:49,456
Okay. Look at me, look at me.
You're good.

39
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:52,042
Hold on tight.
I'm gonna get help, okay?

40
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:54,503
- Help! Help!
- He needs to die.

41
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:57,130
He needs to die.

42
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:59,007
Okay, okay.
Come on, come on.

43
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:00,401
Stay still, stay still,
stay still. Look at me.

44
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:01,986
- Look at... Look at me.
- He needs to die.

45
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,386
Who needs to die?

46
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:05,514
He needs to die.

47
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:07,224
And I'm the one...

48
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:09,434
that's gonna get him.

49
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:17,234
Oh, shit.

50
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:19,986
Haddonfield
Sheriff's Department.

51
00:03:20,028 --> 00:03:22,197
Stop right there.

52
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:28,370
I said stop!

53
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:41,049
Shit.

54
00:03:43,593 --> 00:03:45,387
Shit.

55
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:01,319
Hawkins! You all right?

56
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:02,571
Did you see him?

57
00:04:02,612 --> 00:04:04,448
- Where did he go?
- Where have you guys been?

58
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:05,991
I called for backup
ten minutes ago.

59
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:07,534
Easy, rookie.

60
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:09,387
Loomis said he shot him
multiple times in the chest.

61
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:10,871
I saw from 50 yards away.

62
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:14,124
He crossed right here
and then just disappeared.

63
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,917
Okay. Sullivan, you and Tobias

64
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,461
search Chestnut,
south to the bypass.

65
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:19,588
Hawkins and I will track
Market Street up to Lampkin.

66
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:20,630
We'll catch him.

67
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:22,716
Yeah, kill the bad guy.

68
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:25,302
Jesus, Frank.

69
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:27,179
I used to know the guy.

70
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,389
- Michael. We were kids.
- Yeah?

71
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:31,558
Was he one of those
weirdo freaks who used to pluck

72
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,977
the wings off butterflies
when he was a kid?

73
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:36,021
Not that I ever saw.

74
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:37,731
He was just...

75
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:39,900
Just killed his sister
when he was six years old?

76
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:42,944
Yeah. My mom used to make me
go over to his house to play.

77
00:04:42,986 --> 00:04:45,447
She felt bad. But he would just
spend the whole time

78
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:48,200
staring out of his sister's
bedroom window.

79
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:50,243
I always remember thinking,

80
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:52,746
"The hell is he looking at
out there?"

81
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:56,249
He was looking at Haddonfield.

82
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,586
Simple town where
nothing exciting ever happens.

83
00:04:59,628 --> 00:05:01,171
Yeah.

84
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:04,132
Then one day, he just snapped.

85
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:15,268
Lonnie, Lonnie,
weird and scrawny. -

86
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,938
Has bad dreams,
so cries to mommy.

87
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:19,523
He's gonna get you.

88
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:21,942
He's gonna get you, Lonnie.
He's gonna get you.

89
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:23,235
Touch Conrad's candy again,

90
00:05:23,276 --> 00:05:24,712
I swear to God
I'll beat your ugly ass!

91
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:25,963
Yeah, we'll beat your
ugly ass. That's right!

92
00:05:25,987 --> 00:05:27,447
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

93
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:29,157
- It was Richie.
- Then show me.

94
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,659
Open your hand right now.

95
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,220
No. -Why don't you
open up your hand?

96
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:33,495
I don't want to.

97
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,957
- Get off.
- Open your hand!

98
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,584
Leave me alone.

99
00:05:41,336 --> 00:05:42,671
Yeah, okay.

100
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:47,259
That's what you get when
you fuck with the Mullanys.

101
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,761
Get away from me!
Leave me alone!

102
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:54,474
Hey. Everything all right
with you kids?

103
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:57,227
Yeah. Just trick-or-treating
with our new old friend Lonnie.

104
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:58,812
What? You...

105
00:05:58,854 --> 00:06:01,189
You kids see anyone
walking around in a white mask?

106
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:03,567
It's Halloween.
Everyone's wearing a mask.

107
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:05,694
That's right. I need you
to go home right now.

108
00:06:05,735 --> 00:06:08,155
Go home to your parents
and lock your doors.

109
00:06:08,196 --> 00:06:10,407
- Why? What did he do?
- What did he do?

110
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,169
He murdered three teenagers
down the street.

111
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:19,833
Don't get murdered, Lonnie.

112
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,002
Sleep with one eye open, Lonnie.

113
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:23,670
He's gonna get you, Lonnie Elam!

114
00:06:23,712 --> 00:06:25,839
- Boogey, Boogey.
- Did you see his face?

115
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:30,093
Lonnie, Lonnie,
weird and scrawny.

116
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:32,345
Has bad dreams,
so cries to mommy.

117
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:33,972
Be careful, Lonnie.

118
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:35,533
He's gonna get you,
Lonnie. He's gonna get you.

119
00:06:35,557 --> 00:06:37,017
He's gonna get you, Lonnie.

120
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:38,727
Sleep with one eye open, Lonnie.

121
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:40,520
He's gonna get you, Lonnie.

122
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:42,773
He's gonna get you, Lonnie Elam.

123
00:07:05,754 --> 00:07:07,214
Help.

124
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:08,632
Help!

125
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:11,343
I'm sorry
for tripping Tommy Doyle

126
00:07:11,384 --> 00:07:12,594
and bullying him.

127
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:15,555
Just... just-just please
don't kill me.

128
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:17,140
Hey, kid. You okay?

129
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:18,767
Hey, whoa. It's all right.
Take it easy.

130
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:20,102
Where'd he go?

131
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:21,353
Where is he?

132
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:23,313
You-you didn't see him?

133
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:25,857
- Take a deep breath.
- Who?

134
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:27,901
The Boogeyman.

135
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:31,255
- He's gonna kill you!
- Whoa. Hey, hey.

136
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,240
- Boogeyman?
- What the hell?

137
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:34,741
That's it.

138
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:38,036
That's the Myers house.

139
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:40,414
That's where it happened.

140
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:43,583
Halloween, 1963.

141
00:08:13,613 --> 00:08:15,824
Hey, Frank?

142
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:17,325
Yeah.

143
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:19,619
There's a dead dog in here.

144
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:20,787
What?

145
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:21,913
Nothing.

146
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:35,302
Don't shoot!

147
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:37,637
- Frank. Frank.
- What?

148
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:41,057
Oh, sh...

149
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:45,562
Go for it.

150
00:08:46,563 --> 00:08:49,691
PETE Three, two, one.

151
00:08:52,903 --> 00:08:54,362
Okay.

152
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:57,824
Crazy.

153
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:06,124
Ugh.

154
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,709
Spiderwebs.

155
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:01,638
Haddonfield.

156
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,265
Where nothing exciting
ever happ...

157
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,896
McCabe?

158
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,069
McCabe?

159
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:17,988
McCabe!

160
00:10:22,284 --> 00:10:23,577
Drop him!

161
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:25,162
Drop him or I'll shoot.

162
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:27,873
Michael, I'm warning you.

163
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,043
Goddamn it!

164
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:53,440
Hang on, McCabe.

165
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:55,108
Pete. Pete, Pete.

166
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,569
Hey, hey. It's-it's okay.

167
00:10:57,611 --> 00:10:59,196
We're gonna get...

168
00:10:59,237 --> 00:11:01,656
We're gonna get you some help,
okay? Just hang in there.

169
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:03,033
It's gonna be okay, all right?

170
00:11:03,075 --> 00:11:04,451
You're gonna stay with me?

171
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:05,803
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Stay with me, okay?

172
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:06,953
Stay back! The evil is here!

173
00:11:08,497 --> 00:11:09,956
Move, move, move!

174
00:11:09,998 --> 00:11:11,291
- Freeze!
- Stop!

175
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,877
Michael, stay where you are.

176
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,462
You got him, right?

177
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:17,798
We... Tell me we got him.

178
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,216
OFFICER Stay right there!

179
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:20,717
Uh-huh.

180
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:23,970
We got him?

181
00:11:24,012 --> 00:11:26,264
HAWKINS Oh, my God.

182
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:32,020
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:33,939
Sorry.

184
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,650
Oh, God.

185
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,323
Stop!

186
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:44,741
Michael, stay back.

187
00:11:44,783 --> 00:11:46,493
Hold it right there!

188
00:11:46,535 --> 00:11:47,845
Description of
the subject for confirmation.

189
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:50,288
- It's him.
- It's him.

190
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,873
It's Michael Myers.

191
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,672
Officer Hawkins, tell me,
what happened in here?

192
00:11:58,713 --> 00:12:00,340
Tell me what happened.

193
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:01,842
Did Michael kill?

194
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:03,385
Did Michael kill again?

195
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:20,313
I thought that was
gonna be, like,

196
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:21,648
a holiday pizza party

197
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,084
with a bunch of coworkers,
not an orgy.

198
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:25,402
Your vulgar-ass boss
acted inappropriately.

199
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:26,820
You need to start

200
00:14:26,862 --> 00:14:28,214
standing up for yourself
in these situations.

201
00:14:28,238 --> 00:14:29,823
Yeah, no. That's right.
You're right.

202
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:31,342
No, stand up for myself.
Now, tomorrow morning,

203
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,010
I'm gonna go in there,
I'm gonna quit that job...

204
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:34,834
And you're gonna punch
Dr. Mathis in the face.

205
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,164
- Ooh! Champagne.
- Yep. Punch him in the face.

206
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:38,790
Okay... Yes!
Oh, look at you.

207
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:40,208
With all the shit
happening today,

208
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,002
two homicides at
a gas station... -

209
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:44,045
Stop it. We don't even
know if he was on the bus.

210
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:46,423
Tommy, you're so paranoid.

211
00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:49,676
- Very sous bois.
- Mm, okay.

212
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:51,344
- Oh. Excuse me.
- Great.

213
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:53,430
Yeah, that's...
that's a little old French term

214
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:55,056
meaning this bitch tastes good.

215
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,809
All right!

216
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:02,522
Hey. Hey.

217
00:15:02,564 --> 00:15:04,649
Hey, hey, guys, guys, guys.

218
00:15:04,691 --> 00:15:06,276
Can you bring it down a tad?

219
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:08,653
Like, my wife and I are trying
to watch the talent show.

220
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:10,238
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

221
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,050
- Sorry. -Yeah. Yeah, sorry.
- Sorry about that.

222
00:15:12,074 --> 00:15:14,367
- Appreciate it.
- Okay.

223
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:17,537
I'm gonna go get us
a couple of drinks.

224
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,206
- You relax.
- Okay.

225
00:15:19,247 --> 00:15:22,000
Well, I'm kind of a
sommelier, but for cheap wines.

226
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:24,377
- Yeah.
- Yeah, can I get, um,

227
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:26,064
two of the voodoo
skeleton thing right here?

228
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:28,340
Hey, look here, don't be
bothered by them motherfuckers

229
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:29,800
over there, man.

230
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:31,968
They are friends
with that crazy lady

231
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,721
that almost got killed
by Michael Myers.

232
00:15:34,763 --> 00:15:36,723
No shit.
I-I heard about that.

233
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:38,242
Wha...
Uh, Laura Stropes or something.

234
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:40,310
- Laurie Strode.
- Strode, yeah.

235
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:41,978
The one that survived
Michael Myers.

236
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,772
They come here every Halloween,

237
00:15:43,814 --> 00:15:46,483
and, you know,
tears in their beers.

238
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:50,570
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to introduce

239
00:15:50,612 --> 00:15:52,280
our next thespian.

240
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:56,535
Now, I used to bust this guy's
balls when we were kids,

241
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:58,453
but he is all grown-up now.

242
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:03,708
And he's become the most
captivating bird whistler.

243
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:12,300
- Hey, everybody.
- All right, Tommy!

244
00:16:12,342 --> 00:16:14,636
Uh, Lonnie put me up
to this shit.

245
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:18,640
Uh, I'm not gonna
whistle for you.

246
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:20,159
I'm, uh... I'm gonna
tell you a story.

247
00:16:20,183 --> 00:16:22,894
- Ghosts and goblins!
- Oh...

248
00:16:24,146 --> 00:16:26,606
You got this, Tommy!
Turn off the lights!

249
00:16:26,648 --> 00:16:30,277
Any of you know the story
of the Haddonfield Boogeyman?

250
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:33,947
Too young to give a shit?
Too drunk to remember?

251
00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:38,785
40 years ago, a madman escaped
from a mental hospital.

252
00:16:38,827 --> 00:16:40,829
It was the night
before Halloween,

253
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:42,664
and three teenage girls

254
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:44,583
were walking home
from Haddonfield High.

255
00:16:44,624 --> 00:16:47,294
They had sightings of a...

256
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:50,964
a ghostlike figure creeping
right through our town.

257
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:53,842
A man in a white mask.

258
00:16:53,884 --> 00:16:56,762
Or was it more than a man?

259
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:59,181
He was watching them.

260
00:16:59,222 --> 00:17:03,226
Before the night was over,
three people would be murdered.

261
00:17:03,268 --> 00:17:06,897
And in the house next door,
there was a babysitter

262
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:09,399
and a young boy
and a young girl,

263
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:12,736
and they were brutally attacked
by this stalker

264
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:17,074
who had a power beyond
any mortal man.

265
00:17:19,117 --> 00:17:21,620
My name is Tommy Doyle.

266
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,873
And I was that young boy.

267
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:28,627
So, please, join me

268
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:32,339
in commemorating the victims

269
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,176
and the survivors
of Michael Myers.

270
00:17:36,218 --> 00:17:38,970
Thank you.

271
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:46,520
Now, we have, uh, the lovely
Miss Lindsey Wallace.

272
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:50,398
Her babysitter, Annie Brackett,
was executed that night.

273
00:17:58,031 --> 00:18:00,450
And we have
Miss Marion Chambers.

274
00:18:00,492 --> 00:18:02,119
She survived an assault.

275
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:07,249
We have Lonnie Elam.

276
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,252
Lonnie survived
a face-to-face encounter.

277
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:14,172
Help!

278
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,384
It's Halloween night
in Haddonfield.

279
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:20,929
When terror's
supposed to be fun.

280
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:23,432
When we hide behind masks

281
00:18:23,473 --> 00:18:25,684
and we pretend
we aren't what we are.

282
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:27,561
Is he real?

283
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:29,396
Who knows?

284
00:18:29,438 --> 00:18:31,398
Who's next?

285
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,944
Maybe not tonight,
maybe not tomorrow,

286
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:38,071
but the Boogeyman
is coming for me.

287
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:40,198
And he's coming for you.

288
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,452
But he's not gonna get us.

289
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:44,953
Not this time.

290
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:48,582
Because we will never
succumb to fear.

291
00:18:48,623 --> 00:18:49,916
This is for you, Laurie.

292
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,295
Wherever you are.

293
00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:54,713
We're almost at
the hospital, Mom.

294
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:56,465
Take deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

295
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:58,426
We're almost there.
We're almost at the hospital.

296
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00,510
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

297
00:19:00,552 --> 00:19:02,179
It's good. It's good.

298
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,930
It's okay. It's okay.

299
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:05,932
No, no, no, no.

300
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:09,019
- No, no, no, no, no!
- No!

301
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,396
Oh, let it burn!

302
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:12,981
No!

303
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,649
Let it burn!

304
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:18,320
MAN Copy that.
Utilities are being shut down.

305
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:21,281
We got a gas-fed fire in here.

306
00:19:21,323 --> 00:19:22,908
Ten-four. Stand by.

307
00:19:22,949 --> 00:19:24,493
Copy.

308
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:31,792
Assignment complete.

309
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,960
- Utilities are disengaged.
- Copy.

310
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:35,545
- Eyes on the roof.
- Watch out.

311
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:37,297
With you. Let's move.
All right, let's go.

312
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:39,633
Command Ladder 13, do you copy?

313
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:05,867
Mayday. Mayday.

314
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:09,329
Radio silence.
We have a Mayday alert.

315
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:11,123
This is Benton
with Engine Eight.

316
00:20:11,164 --> 00:20:13,417
There's been
a structural collapse.

317
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,836
My air supply has been
compromised.

318
00:20:15,877 --> 00:20:17,754
PASS alarm has been activated.

319
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:20,132
Oh, shit.

320
00:20:21,383 --> 00:20:23,009
Come in, Engine 13.

321
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:26,096
Oh.
There's someone else down here!

322
00:20:26,138 --> 00:20:28,181
Do you copy?

323
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:38,150
Central,
we have a firefighter down.

324
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:42,112
All right, team one,
commence rescue.

325
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,240
Benton?

326
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:48,201
Benton, my hand's here!

327
00:20:48,243 --> 00:20:50,620
Take my hand!

328
00:20:50,662 --> 00:20:52,456
Take my hand now!

329
00:20:52,497 --> 00:20:54,708
Mayday event.
Send in rescue team now.

330
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,251
Grab my hand!

331
00:21:02,758 --> 00:21:05,510
The fuck is that?

332
00:22:11,034 --> 00:22:12,786
Mom, can you hear us?

333
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:14,830
- All right.
- She was stabbed in the abdomen.

334
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:16,849
Activate the trauma team.
We got an unconscious female

335
00:22:16,873 --> 00:22:18,768
- with an abdominal injury.
- Can you hear me, Mom?

336
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:20,144
Possibly penetrating,
multiple contusions.

337
00:22:20,168 --> 00:22:21,336
Mom, can you hear me?

338
00:22:21,378 --> 00:22:23,463
She's losing a lot of blood.

339
00:22:23,505 --> 00:22:25,006
Ma'am, can you tell me
your name?

340
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:26,216
Allyson, wait here, honey.

341
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:28,260
Ma'am, can you tell me
your name?

342
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:31,054
Um, uh, that's... that's my mom.

343
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:32,222
It's Laurie Strode.

344
00:22:32,264 --> 00:22:34,349
- Strode. She was attacked.
- Laurie.

345
00:22:34,391 --> 00:22:35,809
She's, uh... she's my mom.

346
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:37,727
Sh-She's been attacked.
She has probably...

347
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:40,147
Ma'am, I-I think you should
really let a nurse look at you.

348
00:22:40,188 --> 00:22:41,273
I'm fine.

349
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:43,567
I'm fine.

350
00:22:45,986 --> 00:22:47,696
It's not my blood.

351
00:22:47,737 --> 00:22:49,072
Okay? It's not my blood.

352
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:32,699
DOCTOR
We'll close up the fascia,

353
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:35,619
and, uh, we'll loosely
staple the, uh, skin

354
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,287
so it doesn't get infected.

355
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:41,792
She's lost a good bit of blood,
but it's all controllable.

356
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,502
I think she'll be fine.

357
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:47,380
Get her to the floor,
into the ICU tonight.

358
00:23:47,422 --> 00:23:49,716
The internal organ
will be repaired,

359
00:23:49,758 --> 00:23:52,302
and so there shouldn't be
any long-term damage.

360
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:53,929
Her only concern will be

361
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,723
her abdominal wall will be
very sore from the knife wound

362
00:23:56,765 --> 00:23:59,267
and from our midline
incision here.

363
00:24:03,105 --> 00:24:04,731
Thank you for everything.

364
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:06,691
Honey.

365
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:08,276
Hey.

366
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:10,320
She's gonna be okay.

367
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:13,323
She's gonna be okay.

368
00:24:18,453 --> 00:24:20,622
Dad's gone.

369
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:26,503
He'll always be with us.

370
00:24:27,462 --> 00:24:29,714
Even if we can't see him.

371
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:37,639
WOMAN No, I'm not afraid to go.

372
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:40,142
I just don't feel like it.

373
00:24:40,183 --> 00:24:42,227
Besides, I sort of promised
my father

374
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:43,454
we-we were going to the movies.

375
00:24:43,478 --> 00:24:45,981
I don't hear
no more fire trucks.

376
00:24:47,482 --> 00:24:49,484
Goddamn sleep apnea mask
smells like Lucky Strikes

377
00:24:49,526 --> 00:24:51,278
from when
your mother borrowed it.

378
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,946
I smell it, too.

379
00:24:52,988 --> 00:24:54,406
But that stink ain't cigarettes.

380
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:55,949
That's Laurie Strode's
house on fire.

381
00:24:55,991 --> 00:24:59,411
Well, from-from upstairs,
it looks like they put it out.

382
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:02,414
But that nut bag lives
a highly flammable lifestyle.

383
00:25:02,456 --> 00:25:04,458
Better not talk no shit
about that woman.

384
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:06,877
She will fuck you up.

385
00:25:06,918 --> 00:25:09,296
How about you and I
snack on some Cheez-Its

386
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:12,549
and try a little
Beaujolais nouveau?

387
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:16,595
Cheap piece of shit.

388
00:25:16,636 --> 00:25:18,346
You don't know
how to fly that thing.

389
00:25:18,388 --> 00:25:20,140
Give me that controller.

390
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:22,392
Here, I got you.

391
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:28,940
The fuck was that?

392
00:25:28,982 --> 00:25:30,901
Somebody in there?

393
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,511
Hey!

394
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,560
SONDRA You see anything?

395
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:27,374
Hey, Sondra. Sondra.

396
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:28,768
There's a big fella
in our bathroom,

397
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:30,794
and he's wearing a monster mask.

398
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:32,462
Well, what the fuck
does he want?

399
00:26:32,504 --> 00:26:34,923
Who gives a shit?
Call the cops!

400
00:26:55,277 --> 00:26:57,696
Run, Sondra! Run!

401
00:27:09,624 --> 00:27:11,668
No.

402
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:19,634
Please no.

403
00:27:25,307 --> 00:27:26,307
Fuck...

404
00:27:49,623 --> 00:27:51,958
Sondra!

405
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,465
Sondra!

406
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,260
Sondra!

407
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,310
Sondra!

408
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:18,920
Hey. I, uh, heard
your speech up there, man.

409
00:29:18,962 --> 00:29:21,006
Like, everybody knows
that story,

410
00:29:21,047 --> 00:29:23,842
everybody is terrified
of that Boogeyman shit,

411
00:29:23,884 --> 00:29:25,844
- and I had no idea.
- No, I appreciate it.

412
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:27,405
Yeah. Hey, man, let me...
let me buy you guys a round.

413
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:29,282
- Drink? Drink? Yeah.
- Appreciate it, man. Thank you.

414
00:29:29,306 --> 00:29:30,992
- Sorry about that earlier, too.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

415
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:32,910
- It's fine. We're all good here.
- Hey, let me see that.

416
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:34,644
I'm a nurse.
Oh, okay.

417
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:36,605
Is he a real doctor?

418
00:29:36,646 --> 00:29:38,166
- Oh. Thank you. Cheers, Tommy.
- Cheers.

419
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,941
Yeah.
Let me check you out.

420
00:29:49,242 --> 00:29:50,744
Hey there, Bonnie.

421
00:29:50,786 --> 00:29:52,120
You and Clyde need a ride?

422
00:29:52,162 --> 00:29:53,914
Dad, I need you
to come pick me up.

423
00:29:53,955 --> 00:29:56,583
I'm, uh... I'm-I'm at
the park near school,

424
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:59,002
and, uh, a police officer
was attacked.

425
00:29:59,044 --> 00:30:01,463
- And, uh...
- Where-where are you?

426
00:30:06,802 --> 00:30:08,929
Keep applying pressure
to external hemorrhage.

427
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,764
How's that pulse?

428
00:30:20,148 --> 00:30:22,192
I've been having a bar
about 50 years.

429
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:24,212
50 years? -And you started
with your granddaddy, right?

430
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:25,946
Yeah, my grandpa
who started the business.

431
00:30:25,987 --> 00:30:28,532
That's my grandpa's picture
up here. Yeah, I got...

432
00:30:28,573 --> 00:30:30,158
I got my bat up here.
Huckleberry.

433
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,677
- Old Huckleberry.
- Baseball bat. Excellent.

434
00:30:31,701 --> 00:30:33,054
Oh, if he come back today,
we gonna...

435
00:30:33,078 --> 00:30:34,555
- we got something for him.
- That's right.

436
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:35,789
- To Brian. To Brian.
- Yeah.

437
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:37,124
To Brian.
To Brian.

438
00:30:37,165 --> 00:30:38,583
- Thank you. Yes.
- All right, then.

439
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:39,811
I knew we came
to the right place.

440
00:30:39,835 --> 00:30:41,878
Hey, guys.
Cameron's in trouble.

441
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,672
Lonnie, what's wrong?

442
00:30:43,713 --> 00:30:44,965
Oh, my God.

443
00:30:51,054 --> 00:30:53,723
Got a goddamn massacre
on our hands.

444
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:55,183
- Graham!
- Yes, sir.

445
00:30:55,225 --> 00:30:56,435
Establish a perimeter.

446
00:30:56,476 --> 00:30:58,019
Copy that.

447
00:31:00,105 --> 00:31:01,481
Motherfucker!

448
00:31:01,523 --> 00:31:03,483
GRAHAM
Attention, all responders.

449
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:06,153
Be advised, we have
a violent criminal at large,

450
00:31:06,194 --> 00:31:07,863
armed and dangerous.

451
00:31:07,904 --> 00:31:09,489
We will deploy all units

452
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:13,201
of frontline and tactical
officers to search the area.

453
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:16,830
This fugitive is on foot.

454
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:19,082
His name is Michael Myers.

455
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:21,793
Go get him.

456
00:31:35,015 --> 00:31:36,683
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, turn it up.

457
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:38,852
Tommy, look. Hey, turn it up.

458
00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:41,897
Service station earlier today.

459
00:31:41,938 --> 00:31:44,149
This evening,
four bodies were discovered

460
00:31:44,191 --> 00:31:46,860
in three homes along
the same residential street.

461
00:31:46,902 --> 00:31:50,197
Residents of North Haddonfield
are on high alert.

462
00:31:50,238 --> 00:31:52,050
- Officials are investigating.
- What's gonna stop him?

463
00:31:52,074 --> 00:31:53,450
Less than an hour ago,

464
00:31:53,492 --> 00:31:55,911
Haddonfield authorities
positively identified...

465
00:31:55,952 --> 00:31:57,221
- That's our street.
- Several more victims

466
00:31:57,245 --> 00:31:59,372
in this
South Bastick neighborhood.

467
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:01,541
That reporter is right
outside Mrs. Dewbottom's house.

468
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:02,894
That's right next door
to our house.

469
00:32:02,918 --> 00:32:04,336
Two patients of the local

470
00:32:04,377 --> 00:32:06,379
Smith's Grove State Hospital
unaccounted for

471
00:32:06,421 --> 00:32:08,381
after yesterday's
transport bus escape.

472
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:10,550
Authorities have not
confirmed a connection

473
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:13,970
between those two events,
but police are encouraging

474
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:16,181
all residents to remain inside

475
00:32:16,223 --> 00:32:18,809
until further information
is released.

476
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,937
Tonight's tragedy
an eerie reminder of an event

477
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:23,814
in Haddonfield history

478
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:26,399
this community has spent
decades trying to forget.

479
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:28,276
But police now believe
that more people...

480
00:32:28,318 --> 00:32:30,695
I-I remember him
from 40 years ago.

481
00:32:30,737 --> 00:32:33,073
I was laying in my bed,
and he...

482
00:32:33,115 --> 00:32:35,575
he stabbed... he...
he killed her.

483
00:32:35,617 --> 00:32:37,160
That's-that's Julian.
That's that...

484
00:32:37,202 --> 00:32:39,222
That's that little asshole kid
from across the street.

485
00:32:39,246 --> 00:32:41,415
And she was my number-one
main best babysitter.

486
00:32:41,456 --> 00:32:43,417
Yeah, we're gonna go, all right?

487
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:44,960
Uh, hey, thanks, man.

488
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:47,087
Um, it was nice meeting
you guys, but we got to go.

489
00:32:47,129 --> 00:32:48,922
Be careful...
Oh, y'all be careful, now.

490
00:32:48,964 --> 00:32:51,007
What the hell is happening?

491
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:52,426
It's Michael. It's got to be.

492
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:54,177
WOMAN
I've lived here my whole life.

493
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:56,471
This was a safe place,
and now it's not anymore.

494
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:03,145
Shit. I forgot my stethoscope.

495
00:33:03,186 --> 00:33:04,604
Come on, baby,
we got to get home.

496
00:33:04,646 --> 00:33:07,107
I bet that lady still has it.
Hey, I'll be right back.

497
00:33:29,337 --> 00:33:30,589
What?

498
00:33:32,507 --> 00:33:34,009
What's wrong?

499
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,343
Baby. Baby, baby.

500
00:33:35,385 --> 00:33:36,654
- What? What? What's wrong?
- He's in the car.

501
00:33:36,678 --> 00:33:37,971
- What?
- He's in the car.

502
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:39,323
- Who? What?
- He's in the back seat.

503
00:33:39,347 --> 00:33:40,658
Michael Myers is
in the back seat. Go look.

504
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:41,641
Go look? Hell no!

505
00:33:41,683 --> 00:33:43,477
What's wrong with you?

506
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:48,148
Somebody help me.
He's here.

507
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,417
He's in the back seat of my car.

508
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:50,984
I saw him when I went
to go get in.

509
00:33:51,026 --> 00:33:52,503
It's the same guy
you were talking about...

510
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:54,029
the one that that was on TV.

511
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,405
Tommy, what are you doing?

512
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:57,657
That nasty snatcher's
in my parking lot?

513
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:59,326
Yes, sir.

514
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:01,036
Love lives today.

515
00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:02,579
But evil dies tonight.

516
00:34:04,206 --> 00:34:07,334
Tommy Doyle's gonna fuck him up.

517
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,835
He's right there, in my car.

518
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:10,796
He, uh... he got out of the car

519
00:34:10,837 --> 00:34:13,215
and got into the front
of the car.

520
00:34:13,256 --> 00:34:15,759
I saw him.
He looked right at me.

521
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:34,486
Is it him?

522
00:34:34,528 --> 00:34:36,238
He's watching us.

523
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,827
I got this.

524
00:34:41,868 --> 00:34:43,995
Tommy, be careful.

525
00:35:04,724 --> 00:35:05,892
Michael.

526
00:35:05,934 --> 00:35:07,227
Wake up.

527
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:09,020
Oh, my God.

528
00:35:09,062 --> 00:35:10,856
- Tommy, careful!
- Oh, no!

529
00:35:10,897 --> 00:35:12,983
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa!

530
00:35:17,863 --> 00:35:19,865
Damn.
What in the hell's going on?

531
00:35:36,214 --> 00:35:37,591
Fuck!

532
00:35:37,632 --> 00:35:39,259
Come on, come on.

533
00:35:41,261 --> 00:35:42,971
Look at my damn car.

534
00:35:43,013 --> 00:35:44,973
ANNOUNCER
WURG 94.9.

535
00:35:45,015 --> 00:35:46,475
Tommy, careful!

536
00:35:46,516 --> 00:35:49,895
Giving you the urge
with Willie the Kid.

537
00:35:49,936 --> 00:35:52,230
Haddonfield's home for rock.

538
00:35:53,231 --> 00:35:55,734
He thinks he can come
around here and scare us?

539
00:36:03,742 --> 00:36:06,620
I'm gonna rip his mask off,
look him in the eye,

540
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:10,415
swing Old Huckleberry here
and say night night.

541
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,628
Night night.

542
00:36:49,037 --> 00:36:51,039
Mmm.

543
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:54,376
Hey, Big John.

544
00:37:00,132 --> 00:37:02,008
Hey, Big John!

545
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,059
Could you turn that down?

546
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:13,520
Christ, Little John.

547
00:37:13,562 --> 00:37:15,856
I thought we were gonna
watch a movie.

548
00:37:15,897 --> 00:37:17,649
No.

549
00:37:17,691 --> 00:37:18,900
Fuck that.

550
00:37:18,942 --> 00:37:20,402
It's Halloween.

551
00:37:20,444 --> 00:37:22,737
Pulled some old spooky records.

552
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:24,531
Want to get high and dance?

553
00:37:24,573 --> 00:37:25,699
It's tempting.

554
00:37:27,242 --> 00:37:30,203
Little late
for trick-or-treaters.

555
00:37:32,581 --> 00:37:35,208
Argh, matey. -Me and my sister
were trick-or-treating,

556
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,377
and, uh, we got candy bars
from your house,

557
00:37:37,419 --> 00:37:39,963
and when she bit into it,
there was a rusty razor blade.

558
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:41,798
Wha... All right.
Calm down, calm down.

559
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,258
Now, where is she?

560
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,552
She's right, um... there.

561
00:37:47,053 --> 00:37:49,014
Big John!

562
00:37:49,055 --> 00:37:50,599
Big John, come quick!

563
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,267
What, what, what, what?

564
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:54,102
- What's happened?
- She's bleeding.

565
00:37:54,144 --> 00:37:56,146
She swallowed a razor blade.
She's still alive.

566
00:37:56,188 --> 00:37:58,482
- Call 911.
- Can you help her?

567
00:37:58,523 --> 00:38:00,817
- Oh.
- She bit her tongue off.

568
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:02,336
- She's bleeding to death.
- Okay, there's the blade.

569
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,404
It's in the barf.

570
00:38:05,781 --> 00:38:07,407
The fuck was that?

571
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:09,242
Did someone just go
in our house?

572
00:38:11,995 --> 00:38:13,455
Oh, my God.

573
00:38:13,497 --> 00:38:15,165
- What is it? What?
- Are you okay?

574
00:38:15,207 --> 00:38:16,416
- Boo!
- Aah! Jesus!

575
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:18,835
We scared you!

576
00:38:20,128 --> 00:38:22,172
I got it!

577
00:38:22,214 --> 00:38:24,132
You think this is funny, huh?

578
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:27,010
We got you good.

579
00:38:27,052 --> 00:38:29,179
I stole the whole damn bowl.

580
00:38:30,764 --> 00:38:33,016
You don't know who
you're messing with, do you?

581
00:38:33,058 --> 00:38:34,518
Take it easy, Big John.

582
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,621
- They're too young to know.
- Too young to know what?

583
00:38:36,645 --> 00:38:39,356
Do you have any idea
whose house this was?

584
00:38:39,397 --> 00:38:41,274
No.

585
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:44,611
You ever hear of
Michael fucking Myers?

586
00:38:44,653 --> 00:38:47,322
And do you know
what happens to people

587
00:38:47,364 --> 00:38:51,451
who come into the Myers home
without an invitation?

588
00:38:51,493 --> 00:38:52,911
We're not even scared.

589
00:38:52,953 --> 00:38:56,206
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

590
00:38:56,248 --> 00:38:59,084
He stabbed his sister
in the tits.

591
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:02,546
- Yuck.
- Right upstairs.

592
00:39:05,465 --> 00:39:09,970
And sometimes,
when the wind blows just right,

593
00:39:10,011 --> 00:39:12,973
we can still hear her ghost

594
00:39:13,014 --> 00:39:15,183
calling out his name.

595
00:39:15,225 --> 00:39:17,185
Oh, sh-she calls.

596
00:39:17,227 --> 00:39:18,812
Mm-hmm.

597
00:39:18,854 --> 00:39:22,232
Michael.

598
00:39:22,274 --> 00:39:25,777
BOTH Michael...

599
00:39:27,362 --> 00:39:28,989
Get out of my yard,
you little perverts!

600
00:39:31,992 --> 00:39:34,286
Wh-What was that?

601
00:40:03,106 --> 00:40:05,484
All right, let's go. Let's get
him into code room three.

602
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:07,527
- What have we got here?
- Internal bleeding,

603
00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:09,362
lacerations,
but he's gonna make it.

604
00:40:09,404 --> 00:40:10,947
Call Respiratory
for a ventilator.

605
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:12,532
- Officer Hawkins.
- Go. Go, go, go.

606
00:40:12,574 --> 00:40:14,117
Make sure trauma two is prepped.

607
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:16,411
And I need help
getting him on the table.

608
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,596
Allyson. Allyson.

609
00:40:36,098 --> 00:40:38,266
Hey. Can I speak with you?

610
00:40:38,308 --> 00:40:40,560
Ask you a few questions?

611
00:40:45,607 --> 00:40:48,568
I was always told
that I couldn't...

612
00:40:50,487 --> 00:40:52,823
I couldn't talk about Michael.

613
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,326
I could never acknowledge
the tragedy.

614
00:40:56,368 --> 00:40:58,537
It was as if
my mother's biggest fear

615
00:40:58,578 --> 00:41:00,372
was that my grandmother
was right

616
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:03,083
and the Boogeyman was real.

617
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,918
For 40 years, he was waiting

618
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,461
to come and kill my mother.

619
00:41:06,503 --> 00:41:08,922
He found where she lived.

620
00:41:08,964 --> 00:41:11,299
He came to her house.

621
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:14,970
She put us in his path.

622
00:41:17,347 --> 00:41:19,641
He murdered my husband.

623
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,394
That's what happened.

624
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:24,396
Well, so how did Michael know?

625
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:27,774
How did he know how to find
your grandmother?

626
00:41:27,816 --> 00:41:29,359
He didn't.

627
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:30,986
It was his doctor.

628
00:41:31,027 --> 00:41:33,113
Michael's doctor.

629
00:41:33,155 --> 00:41:35,282
He is the one that...

630
00:41:35,323 --> 00:41:37,617
He took him there.
He knew where to go.

631
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:40,746
And he's the one
that brought them together.

632
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:45,459
It was his obsession,

633
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,210
not Michael's.

634
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:48,879
But we got him.

635
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,798
Shot him in the face,
burned him alive

636
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,468
so he can't hurt anyone
ever again.

637
00:41:58,513 --> 00:42:00,307
I'm sorry, Karen.

638
00:42:00,348 --> 00:42:02,225
Thank you.

639
00:42:02,267 --> 00:42:04,144
No one told you?

640
00:42:04,186 --> 00:42:06,104
Told me what?

641
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:11,985
Michael Myers is alive.

642
00:42:12,027 --> 00:42:13,028
What?!

643
00:42:14,154 --> 00:42:15,822
Allyson, Allyson!
Allyson, are you okay?

644
00:42:15,864 --> 00:42:17,699
- Oh, sorry.
- Slow down.

645
00:42:17,741 --> 00:42:19,910
- Allyson, please wait.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

646
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:22,829
I'm so sorry. I just want to
help in any way I can, okay?

647
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:24,831
- He's still alive.
- We're going after him.

648
00:42:24,873 --> 00:42:26,708
Me, my dad, you,
if you want to come.

649
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,668
We're joining Tommy Doyle.

650
00:42:30,045 --> 00:42:32,798
You need to get
everybody here now.

651
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:35,092
If he is alive,
he is on his way here.

652
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:36,843
Mom.

653
00:42:36,885 --> 00:42:39,638
Honey, I want you to go
and sit in Grandmother's room

654
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:41,681
and wait there
until she wakes up, okay?

655
00:42:41,723 --> 00:42:43,517
No. -No, no, no.
She-she's coming with us.

656
00:42:43,558 --> 00:42:44,994
- We're joining Tommy Doyle.
- She what?

657
00:42:45,018 --> 00:42:46,937
I don't know if you've heard,
but they've...

658
00:42:46,978 --> 00:42:48,706
No, the police officers should
be on their way here right now.

659
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,458
Tommy's organizing groups,
groups of people that care.

660
00:42:50,482 --> 00:42:52,126
We're gonna go after him.
We're gonna find Michael.

661
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,653
I'm going with them.
We're gonna hunt him down,

662
00:42:54,694 --> 00:42:56,530
and we're gonna put
an end to this. -Yeah.

663
00:42:56,571 --> 00:42:58,865
No, he is on his way here.
I keep telling them that.

664
00:42:58,907 --> 00:43:01,827
He is stalking her, and we are
staying here to protect her.

665
00:43:01,868 --> 00:43:04,496
He's infected your family,
he's infected my family

666
00:43:04,538 --> 00:43:06,623
with grief and fear
for 40 years.

667
00:43:06,665 --> 00:43:08,250
He's gonna die tonight.

668
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:10,144
He killed Dad. -Clear
the hallway! You have to move!

669
00:43:10,168 --> 00:43:12,504
Excuse me! My husband,
he's been very badly hurt!

670
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:14,297
Clear the hallway, people.

671
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,882
Go back to the waiting area.

672
00:43:15,924 --> 00:43:18,385
Go back to the waiting room.
Clear the hallway.

673
00:43:18,427 --> 00:43:21,054
I'm not gonna pretend
this didn't happen.

674
00:43:21,096 --> 00:43:22,848
I love Dad, and somebody loves

675
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:25,934
whoever is laying
under those sheets right now.

676
00:43:27,185 --> 00:43:29,688
Look. Look at me.
We failed, baby.

677
00:43:29,729 --> 00:43:31,815
We set a trap,
we set the whole thing on fire,

678
00:43:31,857 --> 00:43:33,692
and he lived through it.
Think about that.

679
00:43:33,733 --> 00:43:35,819
The police are out there
looking for him.

680
00:43:35,861 --> 00:43:38,447
You think you're the one
that's gonna find him?

681
00:43:38,488 --> 00:43:41,908
Sit in that room
and wait with your grandmother.

682
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,618
Now!

683
00:43:48,373 --> 00:43:50,333
Does the hospital have
security guards?

684
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:51,877
Do you have security guards?

685
00:43:51,918 --> 00:43:53,646
It seems like you should have
security guards

686
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,630
in case something
like this happens.

687
00:43:55,672 --> 00:43:57,299
And this is happening right now.

688
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,260
I mean, my daughter is in here,
my mother is in here,

689
00:44:00,302 --> 00:44:02,512
there is a madman
on the loose...

690
00:44:02,554 --> 00:44:04,473
Oh! Oh, God!

691
00:44:12,314 --> 00:44:13,857
Goodbye, Michael.

692
00:44:46,431 --> 00:44:49,768
This is for you,
whenever you need it.

693
00:45:07,327 --> 00:45:09,663
She's here. She's here.
We found her. Laurie's here.

694
00:45:09,704 --> 00:45:12,165
She's in recovery.

695
00:45:12,207 --> 00:45:13,542
It's lucky she survived.

696
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:15,303
I just heard from
one of the police officers

697
00:45:15,335 --> 00:45:16,711
at her compound.

698
00:45:16,753 --> 00:45:18,839
11 dead bodies.
They're all first responders.

699
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,757
Holy shit.
Cameron's in there.

700
00:45:20,799 --> 00:45:22,759
Three of his friends
were killed.

701
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:24,529
- It's a madhouse.
- All right, Lonnie, listen.

702
00:45:24,553 --> 00:45:26,596
The only way
we're gonna stop this

703
00:45:26,638 --> 00:45:28,557
is if we all come together
on this.

704
00:45:28,598 --> 00:45:29,808
You're goddamn right.

705
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,560
- All right. All right.
- All right?

706
00:45:33,478 --> 00:45:35,897
How about this sassy tackle?

707
00:45:37,441 --> 00:45:38,900
You have a permit for all these?

708
00:45:38,942 --> 00:45:39,985
Some of 'em.

709
00:45:40,026 --> 00:45:42,612
Dad.
Hey, hey.

710
00:45:43,905 --> 00:45:45,824
- Where's your girlfriend?
- Uh, she's okay.

711
00:45:45,866 --> 00:45:47,677
She's gonna stay
with her family. -Good for her.

712
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:49,244
- Hey, Mr. Doyle.
- Hey, buddy.

713
00:45:49,286 --> 00:45:51,621
Lonnie, check it out.

714
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:56,752
You guys are coming, too?

715
00:45:56,793 --> 00:45:58,211
Couldn't let you have
all the fun.

716
00:45:58,253 --> 00:45:59,963
So many victims
in our neighborhood.

717
00:46:00,005 --> 00:46:01,482
Close friends of ours,
and we just want to help out.

718
00:46:01,506 --> 00:46:02,734
I'm a doctor.
My husband's a nurse.

719
00:46:02,758 --> 00:46:04,342
I should've guessed.

720
00:46:04,384 --> 00:46:06,195
All right, we have to give all
these people protection.

721
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:07,905
You got to share your shit,
Lonnie. -All right.

722
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:09,806
You coming with us?

723
00:46:09,848 --> 00:46:11,850
Let's see what you got.

724
00:46:11,892 --> 00:46:13,769
Yeah, just help yourself.

725
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:18,732
Michael Myers has haunted
this town for 40 years.

726
00:46:20,442 --> 00:46:22,235
Tonight, we hunt him down.

727
00:46:28,116 --> 00:46:30,243
Excuse me.
I need some good people.

728
00:46:30,285 --> 00:46:32,287
People who aren't afraid
to get their hands dirty.

729
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:33,997
Everybody else needs to go home.

730
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,793
So, what do we do
if we find him?

731
00:46:37,834 --> 00:46:39,503
Go inside. Go inside.

732
00:46:39,544 --> 00:46:41,254
It's not safe to be out. Go.

733
00:46:41,296 --> 00:46:42,798
It's not safe to be out.

734
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,467
Man, I had an altercation
with Myers about an hour ago,

735
00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:47,010
but he escaped.

736
00:46:47,052 --> 00:46:48,780
Now, listen, boys,
there's strength in numbers.

737
00:46:48,804 --> 00:46:50,847
You cover Spring Creek
to the bypass,

738
00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:52,891
and then let me know
if you see anything.

739
00:46:52,933 --> 00:46:56,019
This man is a threat,
and we need to stop him tonight!

740
00:46:57,604 --> 00:46:59,606
Nobody ever took him seriously.

741
00:46:59,648 --> 00:47:01,399
- Who?
- Dr. Loomis,

742
00:47:01,441 --> 00:47:03,443
Michael's first doctor.

743
00:47:03,485 --> 00:47:05,112
He knew a killer
when he saw one.

744
00:47:05,153 --> 00:47:07,030
Now, the only way to catch him

745
00:47:07,072 --> 00:47:09,783
is to play by his own game...
The element of surprise.

746
00:47:09,825 --> 00:47:11,576
So he thinks
you're going one place,

747
00:47:11,618 --> 00:47:13,829
then you pop up someplace else.

748
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,831
And keep your eyes open.

749
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:19,793
Eyes open.

750
00:47:25,173 --> 00:47:27,467
Wait, what's going on
over there?

751
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:29,344
Baby, who is that?

752
00:47:29,386 --> 00:47:31,388
Looks like kids.

753
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:32,889
They all alone?

754
00:47:32,931 --> 00:47:35,016
Marion, give me the flashlight.

755
00:47:35,058 --> 00:47:37,144
It's the wrong night to be out.

756
00:47:37,185 --> 00:47:38,311
Careful, Lindsey.

757
00:47:38,353 --> 00:47:40,063
- Lindsey, I wouldn't go...
- Stay here.

758
00:47:43,525 --> 00:47:45,152
Never fired a gun before.

759
00:47:45,193 --> 00:47:47,654
Right, so I don't even know
why they gave you a gun.

760
00:47:47,696 --> 00:47:49,531
It's big, too.
Can you handle it?

761
00:47:49,573 --> 00:47:50,824
That's a no.

762
00:47:50,866 --> 00:47:52,009
Give me, give me.
I shot this shit before.

763
00:47:52,033 --> 00:47:53,493
Okay. If you want it.

764
00:47:53,535 --> 00:47:54,578
I got it.

765
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:56,371
Okay. Fine.

766
00:47:58,498 --> 00:48:00,208
Hey.

767
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,169
What are you guys
doing out here?

768
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,004
It's Halloween.
We've been trick-or-treating.

769
00:48:04,045 --> 00:48:05,606
- We got a whole bag of candy.
- You guys should not be

770
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:06,983
out here right now, okay?
It's not safe.

771
00:48:07,007 --> 00:48:08,192
- You gonna kill me?
- CHRISTY No.

772
00:48:08,216 --> 00:48:09,342
Satan, not today.

773
00:48:09,384 --> 00:48:11,511
- Oh, I'm so scared.
- Are you guys alone?

774
00:48:11,553 --> 00:48:13,054
- Where are your parents?
- No.

775
00:48:13,096 --> 00:48:14,765
No, we're waiting
for our friend.

776
00:48:14,806 --> 00:48:16,409
And, like, there's
a creepy man in a white mask,

777
00:48:16,433 --> 00:48:19,144
and he keeps, like, trying
to play hide-and-seek with us,

778
00:48:19,186 --> 00:48:21,354
- and he thinks...
- And I think he's a pervert.

779
00:48:21,396 --> 00:48:22,647
Where did you see him?

780
00:48:22,689 --> 00:48:23,899
He's just hiding behind trees.

781
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,042
And he pops out like,
"Peekaboo!"

782
00:48:25,066 --> 00:48:26,693
I mean, we're not
three years old.

783
00:48:26,735 --> 00:48:28,045
- Come on, man!
- Oh, look, there he is.

784
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:30,739
- Oh, hello!
- Hello.

785
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:32,783
MINDY
What the hell are you doing?

786
00:48:34,576 --> 00:48:36,745
You want some candy?

787
00:48:39,414 --> 00:48:41,291
Is that Dennis's mask?

788
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:43,001
Run. Go home now.

789
00:48:43,043 --> 00:48:45,045
Before he kills us all!
Get out of here!

790
00:48:45,087 --> 00:48:46,880
Run! Do not turn around!

791
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:48,799
Keep going home!

792
00:48:49,758 --> 00:48:51,134
Oh, my God.

793
00:48:51,176 --> 00:48:53,053
What if someone is disabled?

794
00:48:53,095 --> 00:48:54,906
Like, that doesn't make any
sense... -Yeah, but...

795
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,807
What the hell is that?

796
00:48:56,848 --> 00:48:58,517
- What the fuck?
- It's Michael.

797
00:49:03,105 --> 00:49:05,398
Fuck this bullshit! Drive!

798
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,900
Go! Go!

799
00:49:15,867 --> 00:49:17,494
Drive the fucking...

800
00:49:19,246 --> 00:49:20,580
God!

801
00:49:22,457 --> 00:49:24,835
- No, whoa! Jesus, Marion.
- Marion, watch it!

802
00:49:29,297 --> 00:49:30,900
- Marion, the door's locked!
- I don't want to die in here!

803
00:49:30,924 --> 00:49:32,443
- Unlock the door!
- Unlock the door! -Oh!

804
00:49:32,467 --> 00:49:34,362
- Come on! -Let me out of here!
- Move! He's behind you!

805
00:49:34,386 --> 00:49:36,430
- The door's locked, Marion.
- Move!

806
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:42,269
Go, go!

807
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:43,103
Vanessa, go!

808
00:49:43,145 --> 00:49:45,021
Get out of the fucking car!

809
00:49:45,063 --> 00:49:47,816
I love you, baby!

810
00:49:47,858 --> 00:49:50,193
No!

811
00:49:50,235 --> 00:49:52,279
Let go of her!

812
00:49:53,321 --> 00:49:55,907
Okay, come on. We got to go.
We got to go. -Oh, God.

813
00:49:57,492 --> 00:49:59,953
MARION No.

814
00:49:59,995 --> 00:50:01,496
Shoot him! Shoot him, Marion!

815
00:50:01,538 --> 00:50:02,956
Hey, Michael.

816
00:50:02,998 --> 00:50:05,292
This is for Dr. Loomis.

817
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:14,926
- Oh, God. No!
- Marion!

818
00:50:24,352 --> 00:50:26,688
Come on. Die.

819
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:29,483
Die, die, die!

820
00:53:21,655 --> 00:53:24,157
Mom. Oh, God. No, wait.

821
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:26,827
Stop, stop, please.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

822
00:53:26,868 --> 00:53:28,370
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

823
00:53:28,412 --> 00:53:31,206
You had a knife
in your fucking stomach.

824
00:53:31,248 --> 00:53:33,542
It's a paper cut.

825
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:35,502
Where's Allyson?

826
00:53:36,628 --> 00:53:39,089
She was supposed
to be in here, with you.

827
00:53:39,131 --> 00:53:41,007
- You didn't see her?
- Nah...

828
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:43,552
I'm so geeked out
on pain meds, kiddo.

829
00:53:43,593 --> 00:53:46,054
Uh, uh, no.

830
00:53:48,974 --> 00:53:50,559
Is everything okay?

831
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:54,438
She probably just needed
some fresh air.

832
00:53:56,815 --> 00:54:00,569
My God, they just leave your
bloody shirt just sitting here?

833
00:54:02,904 --> 00:54:04,781
Karen.

834
00:54:05,824 --> 00:54:08,076
Karen.

835
00:54:09,077 --> 00:54:11,246
Michael's gone.

836
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,749
We got him.

837
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:15,542
That's right. We got him.

838
00:54:15,584 --> 00:54:19,337
We burned him
to the goddamn ground.

839
00:54:19,379 --> 00:54:21,673
Excuse us.

840
00:54:21,715 --> 00:54:23,925
Pardon.

841
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:25,510
- Uh, over here.
- Frank?

842
00:54:25,552 --> 00:54:27,721
Go a little further back.
Okay. Okay.

843
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:29,055
- Got the draw sheet?
- Yeah.

844
00:54:29,097 --> 00:54:30,390
One, two...

845
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:31,975
There you go.

846
00:54:32,017 --> 00:54:33,435
Okay.

847
00:54:34,978 --> 00:54:36,772
You knew my dad?

848
00:54:36,813 --> 00:54:39,107
Yeah, I knew Ray.

849
00:54:39,149 --> 00:54:42,068
He used to sell me peyote.

850
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:46,281
I remember once we were out
on Lake Cherokee in this canoe

851
00:54:46,323 --> 00:54:48,742
with a shaman from Little Rock.

852
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:52,662
Your-your daddy got freaked out

853
00:54:52,704 --> 00:54:54,498
by his own reflection.

854
00:54:54,539 --> 00:54:57,042
He took off his pants,
and he jumped in.

855
00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:01,254
I stopped doing drugs with him,

856
00:55:01,296 --> 00:55:04,132
but I'll-I'll miss him.

857
00:55:04,174 --> 00:55:05,967
Dad.
What? It's true.

858
00:55:06,009 --> 00:55:08,053
No, no, no.
Dad, look, right there.

859
00:55:08,095 --> 00:55:10,347
You see that? That's Tommy.

860
00:55:10,388 --> 00:55:12,808
Yeah.
Whose car is that?

861
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:15,143
Lindsey's. Shit.

862
00:55:18,814 --> 00:55:20,273
Lindsey's car.

863
00:55:20,315 --> 00:55:22,192
It's covered in blood.
There's no bodies.

864
00:55:22,234 --> 00:55:24,152
It's Michael.

865
00:55:24,194 --> 00:55:25,987
He's here.

866
00:55:26,029 --> 00:55:28,323
Come on, I need you guys.
Come on.

867
00:55:28,365 --> 00:55:29,533
Be careful now, all right?

868
00:55:29,574 --> 00:55:30,951
Keep your heads up, eyes open.

869
00:55:30,992 --> 00:55:32,619
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

870
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,122
Lindsey!

871
00:55:35,163 --> 00:55:37,332
Okay.
Just be safe, okay?

872
00:55:37,374 --> 00:55:39,167
You, too. Lindsey!

873
00:55:39,209 --> 00:55:41,294
Lindsey!

874
00:55:43,797 --> 00:55:45,132
Lindsey!

875
00:55:45,173 --> 00:55:47,175
Marion!
Marion!

876
00:55:51,096 --> 00:55:52,931
You guys be careful, okay?

877
00:55:52,973 --> 00:55:54,641
Keep your heads up.

878
00:55:56,143 --> 00:55:58,353
Oh, shit, Tommy.

879
00:56:02,023 --> 00:56:04,192
Oh, fuck.

880
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:10,907
Oh, God.

881
00:56:26,882 --> 00:56:28,425
Fuck me.

882
00:56:28,467 --> 00:56:30,343
Yo, Dad, Dad.
What's over there?

883
00:56:30,385 --> 00:56:32,596
We found something.

884
00:56:33,722 --> 00:56:35,515
Oh, God.

885
00:56:38,226 --> 00:56:40,854
Oh, I'm sorry.

886
00:56:40,896 --> 00:56:43,356
- That's Marion, Lonnie.
- He did this.

887
00:56:43,398 --> 00:56:46,359
Oh, God, Marion.

888
00:56:46,401 --> 00:56:48,987
Tommy, what the fuck?

889
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:51,740
I'm gonna get you.

890
00:56:51,782 --> 00:56:54,242
Come and get it, man.

891
00:57:00,874 --> 00:57:02,250
Over here.

892
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:04,503
She's over here.

893
00:57:04,544 --> 00:57:07,089
LINDSEY I saw his face.

894
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:08,298
I saw everything.

895
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,549
He's still out there.

896
00:57:09,591 --> 00:57:11,134
- She's lucky to be alive.
- I saw him.

897
00:57:11,176 --> 00:57:12,385
You saw his face?

898
00:57:12,427 --> 00:57:14,554
He's still out there, Tommy.

899
00:57:14,596 --> 00:57:16,556
You'll be okay, Lindsey.

900
00:57:16,598 --> 00:57:18,100
You're gonna be okay.

901
00:57:18,141 --> 00:57:20,727
He's still out there.

902
00:57:23,897 --> 00:57:25,774
Frank.

903
00:57:28,068 --> 00:57:30,028
Frank, are you awake?

904
00:57:37,452 --> 00:57:40,288
Do you remember that night?

905
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,624
At the bar?

906
00:57:43,834 --> 00:57:46,128
You know, I-I never
said anything,

907
00:57:46,169 --> 00:57:48,505
'cause I couldn't be sure.

908
00:57:51,341 --> 00:57:53,677
I was so messed up.

909
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:02,769
But you helped me.

910
00:58:06,815 --> 00:58:08,650
I always liked you.

911
00:58:11,736 --> 00:58:14,614
You so crazy.

912
00:58:14,656 --> 00:58:16,616
Fuck you.

913
00:58:19,786 --> 00:58:21,329
Hi.

914
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:24,332
Hi.

915
00:58:26,126 --> 00:58:28,044
I remember that night.

916
00:58:28,086 --> 00:58:29,880
Yeah.

917
00:58:31,506 --> 00:58:33,300
I kissed you.

918
00:58:33,341 --> 00:58:35,302
Yeah.

919
00:58:35,343 --> 00:58:37,179
I remember.

920
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,473
You held my hand.

921
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:42,642
That was it.

922
00:58:42,684 --> 00:58:45,562
Now, I was hoping for more.

923
00:58:47,105 --> 00:58:50,192
But I knew you were sweet for...

924
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,571
Ben Tramer.

925
00:58:59,743 --> 00:59:01,119
Frank.

926
00:59:04,122 --> 00:59:05,957
We got him.

927
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,544
We killed Michael.

928
00:59:10,337 --> 00:59:12,130
You ki...

929
00:59:14,925 --> 00:59:16,885
Well, it's about time.

930
00:59:16,927 --> 00:59:18,678
Ow.

931
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,306
Ow. Don't make me laugh.

932
00:59:21,348 --> 00:59:23,767
Oh, good. You're awake.

933
00:59:25,602 --> 00:59:27,437
Now, on a scale from one to ten,

934
00:59:27,479 --> 00:59:30,232
what is your pain level,
with ten being the worst?

935
00:59:30,273 --> 00:59:31,733
Number 11.

936
00:59:32,609 --> 00:59:34,277
This will make the pain go away.

937
00:59:36,738 --> 00:59:38,031
Laurie.

938
00:59:38,073 --> 00:59:40,826
Nurse, will you do me a favor?

939
00:59:41,618 --> 00:59:43,370
Help out my friend here.

940
00:59:43,412 --> 00:59:45,956
Make it a double.

941
00:59:45,997 --> 00:59:48,458
You stood up to that monster.

942
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,502
I tried, Tommy.

943
00:59:50,544 --> 00:59:52,546
You know, when we were kids,

944
00:59:52,587 --> 00:59:54,548
we used to all dare each other

945
00:59:54,589 --> 00:59:56,550
to sneak into
the old Myers house.

946
00:59:58,093 --> 01:00:01,388
Lonnie was the only one
brave enough to do it.

947
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:03,181
I lied.

948
01:00:04,266 --> 01:00:07,060
I never made it inside.

949
01:00:07,102 --> 01:00:09,146
When they arrested
Michael that night,

950
01:00:09,187 --> 01:00:11,815
I was telling my wife
that my daughter was killed,

951
01:00:11,857 --> 01:00:14,818
so I wasn't there to put
a bullet in his brain,

952
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,903
like we should have.
This is no time for prudence.

953
01:00:16,945 --> 01:00:19,239
How'm I supposed to know
if my brother's alive or not?

954
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:21,509
I-I don't know. -I've been
waiting here for over an hour.

955
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:23,452
Who the hell's in charge here?

956
01:00:23,493 --> 01:00:25,012
Authorized medical
and security personnel only.

957
01:00:25,036 --> 01:00:26,756
There's not enough medical
or security help.

958
01:00:26,788 --> 01:00:28,266
- He's going to kill everybody!
- You need to relax.

959
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,851
We've requested backup officers
and medical staff

960
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:31,352
from Russellville
and Eaton County for support,

961
01:00:31,376 --> 01:00:32,669
but no confirmation.

962
01:00:32,711 --> 01:00:34,588
We can't handle
this scope a crime scene.

963
01:00:34,629 --> 01:00:36,631
My son.
My son Oscar, is he here?

964
01:00:36,673 --> 01:00:37,799
Uh, I got a call.

965
01:00:37,841 --> 01:00:39,509
I'm his mother. Is he alive?

966
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,903
I have no idea, but triage
expansion just opened up.

967
01:00:40,927 --> 01:00:42,405
I'm gonna have you sign in
right here.

968
01:00:42,429 --> 01:00:43,764
It's spelled B-E-R-L-U-C-C-H-I.

969
01:00:43,805 --> 01:00:45,182
Clear the hallway, please.

970
01:00:45,223 --> 01:00:46,224
Somebody help!

971
01:00:46,266 --> 01:00:47,601
Please, emergency.

972
01:00:47,642 --> 01:00:48,786
Take her to
the emergency room, please.

973
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,353
You're gonna be okay, Linds.

974
01:00:50,395 --> 01:00:51,646
He's still out there, Tommy.

975
01:00:51,688 --> 01:00:53,398
- Be careful.
- Karen.

976
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,150
How are you doing?
How's your mom?

977
01:00:55,192 --> 01:00:56,711
- How's Laurie? Is she okay?
- Where's my daughter?

978
01:00:56,735 --> 01:00:58,111
She's okay. She's fine.

979
01:00:58,153 --> 01:00:59,213
She's with Lonnie and Cameron.

980
01:00:59,237 --> 01:01:00,405
No, no, but he's coming here.

981
01:01:00,447 --> 01:01:01,716
She's not supposed
to be with them.

982
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,658
He's coming here?
How do you know that?

983
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,536
All right, secure a perimeter.
Hospital's on lockdown.

984
01:01:06,578 --> 01:01:09,122
All right, listen, folks.
Listen! -

985
01:01:09,164 --> 01:01:10,624
Folks, please.

986
01:01:10,665 --> 01:01:12,292
The Boogeyman is at large.

987
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:15,128
He's got no choice
but to emerge.

988
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:16,963
He is an apex predator.

989
01:01:17,005 --> 01:01:19,299
When he surfaces,
there will be no pause.

990
01:01:19,341 --> 01:01:20,801
There will be no empathy.

991
01:01:20,842 --> 01:01:23,470
This ends when Michael is dead!

992
01:01:23,512 --> 01:01:25,680
Michael Myers will be
executed tonight,

993
01:01:25,722 --> 01:01:28,725
and it will not go
without witness!

994
01:01:28,767 --> 01:01:32,062
We need all of you.

995
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:34,523
Evil dies tonight!

996
01:01:34,564 --> 01:01:35,565
Evil dies tonight!

997
01:01:35,607 --> 01:01:37,484
All right, everybody, calm down.

998
01:01:37,526 --> 01:01:38,628
The Sheriff's Department
has this...

999
01:01:38,652 --> 01:01:39,754
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1000
01:01:39,778 --> 01:01:41,071
Sheriff, we will not calm down.

1001
01:01:41,113 --> 01:01:42,739
We have watched
your department fail...

1002
01:01:42,781 --> 01:01:44,408
- fail tonight!
- Tommy's right!

1003
01:01:44,449 --> 01:01:45,700
This is Haddonfield.

1004
01:01:45,742 --> 01:01:47,661
This is our town.

1005
01:01:47,702 --> 01:01:50,580
He killed my daughter
40 years ago

1006
01:01:50,622 --> 01:01:52,582
and desecrated her body.

1007
01:01:52,624 --> 01:01:53,834
Evil dies tonight.

1008
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:55,335
Goddamn it, Brackett!

1009
01:01:55,377 --> 01:01:57,504
I am the law, not you.

1010
01:01:57,546 --> 01:01:59,673
- Fuck off, Barker.
- Jonesy, get over there!

1011
01:01:59,714 --> 01:02:00,924
Robin, I need you up there.

1012
01:02:00,966 --> 01:02:02,592
I need you over here.
You two...

1013
01:02:02,634 --> 01:02:03,969
Laurie!

1014
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:05,554
Tommy, you can't
go in there! -Tommy?

1015
01:02:05,595 --> 01:02:07,281
- Tommy, you can't go in there!
- Laurie. Laurie.

1016
01:02:07,305 --> 01:02:08,849
- Tommy!
- Tommy.

1017
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:10,809
- Laurie. He killed Marion.
- Tommy.

1018
01:02:10,851 --> 01:02:13,437
- And he attacked Lindsey, too.
- What? Karen.

1019
01:02:13,478 --> 01:02:15,623
We didn't know for sure.
I didn't know what to tell you.

1020
01:02:15,647 --> 01:02:18,066
Mom, I just want you to be okay.

1021
01:02:18,108 --> 01:02:20,086
Listen, I just want you to know,
when he gets here,

1022
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:23,029
I'm gonna fucking kill him,
because 40 years ago,

1023
01:02:23,071 --> 01:02:25,532
when I was a kid,
you protected me. -Yeah.

1024
01:02:25,574 --> 01:02:27,993
So, tonight,
I'm gonna protect you. Okay?

1025
01:02:28,034 --> 01:02:30,370
Nurse.
You know, I appreciate you,

1026
01:02:30,412 --> 01:02:32,414
but could you get out, please?

1027
01:02:32,456 --> 01:02:34,332
Like, get out now!

1028
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,710
We had him.

1029
01:02:36,752 --> 01:02:38,211
How did he escape?

1030
01:02:38,253 --> 01:02:39,713
I don't know. I don't know.

1031
01:02:39,755 --> 01:02:41,399
What do we do? We don't
have the police support.

1032
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:43,049
We fight.

1033
01:02:43,091 --> 01:02:44,301
We always fight.

1034
01:02:44,342 --> 01:02:46,970
- Go! Find him, Tommy!
- Yeah. I will. I will.

1035
01:02:47,012 --> 01:02:48,930
- I... No.
- Mom, don't. Don't.

1036
01:02:48,972 --> 01:02:50,474
I need you to listen to me.

1037
01:02:50,515 --> 01:02:52,184
You need to listen to me
right now, okay?

1038
01:02:52,225 --> 01:02:55,604
All right, a lifetime
of preparation, and for what?

1039
01:02:55,645 --> 01:02:57,481
Ray is dead.

1040
01:02:57,522 --> 01:02:59,065
So many people are dead.

1041
01:02:59,107 --> 01:03:00,567
We're not equipped.

1042
01:03:00,609 --> 01:03:03,403
Allyson's run off
with crazy Lonnie Elam.

1043
01:03:03,445 --> 01:03:05,572
People are losing their minds.

1044
01:03:05,614 --> 01:03:08,158
There are authorities
who are trained

1045
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,161
to deal with exactly
this kind of... this...

1046
01:03:11,203 --> 01:03:13,705
There's a system.

1047
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:16,917
Well, the system failed.

1048
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:18,835
Now, get the fuck out of my way.

1049
01:03:18,877 --> 01:03:20,754
- Don't. No. No.
- No, no, no. Get away.

1050
01:03:20,796 --> 01:03:21,939
- What are you doing?
- Karen, no!

1051
01:03:21,963 --> 01:03:22,982
- Stop right now!
- Get away!

1052
01:03:23,006 --> 01:03:24,549
I am not gonna let you do this.

1053
01:03:24,591 --> 01:03:25,926
- No. Mom.
- Get out of my way.

1054
01:03:25,967 --> 01:03:27,803
Move! -Mom, please,
what are you doing?

1055
01:03:30,013 --> 01:03:32,432
Do you even know what that is?

1056
01:03:34,434 --> 01:03:36,311
It makes the pain go away.

1057
01:03:42,692 --> 01:03:44,277
Let him come for me.

1058
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:45,487
No.

1059
01:03:45,529 --> 01:03:47,781
Let him take my head
as I take his.

1060
01:03:47,823 --> 01:03:50,534
- No.
- Maybe the only way he can die

1061
01:03:50,575 --> 01:03:51,701
is if I die, too.

1062
01:03:51,743 --> 01:03:54,454
- No.
- Karen, you and Allyson

1063
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:56,164
should not have to keep running

1064
01:03:56,206 --> 01:03:59,876
because of the darkness
that I created, honey.

1065
01:03:59,918 --> 01:04:02,462
So you just have to let me go.

1066
01:04:02,504 --> 01:04:04,548
- Karen, move!
- Mom, stop. Stop, Mom.

1067
01:04:04,589 --> 01:04:06,925
Listen. Mom.

1068
01:04:09,302 --> 01:04:11,972
Stop.

1069
01:04:12,013 --> 01:04:15,225
I am not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1070
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:19,563
We want to get married.

1071
01:04:19,604 --> 01:04:21,731
Um...

1072
01:04:21,773 --> 01:04:24,860
Uh, I-I guess, uh, right away.

1073
01:04:24,901 --> 01:04:26,653
Right away, yeah. Right away.

1074
01:04:26,695 --> 01:04:29,823
The waggle dance
is how bees communicate.

1075
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:31,825
They share the information
where the flower is

1076
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:33,660
with the rest of the colony.

1077
01:04:33,702 --> 01:04:37,706
They communicate
the precise location

1078
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:39,166
by shaking their butts.

1079
01:04:39,207 --> 01:04:41,251
What is in that honey?

1080
01:04:41,293 --> 01:04:43,628
WOMAN Hey, Mom,
he wants to talk to you.

1081
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:46,757
Hello, Mom.
Seymour Moskowitz.

1082
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:48,633
Right. Jewish.

1083
01:04:48,675 --> 01:04:52,179
My mom kept bees
before she died.

1084
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,475
I'm sorry.

1085
01:04:56,516 --> 01:04:58,185
I'm sorry, baby.

1086
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:05,358
And now they're
at the back door.

1087
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,528
Halloween's over, kids!

1088
01:05:14,242 --> 01:05:16,286
I'll handle it.

1089
01:05:26,296 --> 01:05:27,714
Knock it off!

1090
01:05:33,136 --> 01:05:35,889
Well, now they're
at the front door.

1091
01:05:42,896 --> 01:05:45,398
Let's scare the shit
out of these kids.

1092
01:05:57,077 --> 01:05:59,121
John.

1093
01:06:00,205 --> 01:06:02,749
Don't you know
whose house this was?

1094
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,418
Huh?

1095
01:06:04,459 --> 01:06:06,503
Honey, don't do anything stupid.

1096
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:08,338
We don't want to get sued.

1097
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:12,467
I bet those bitches
are in the bushes.

1098
01:06:13,927 --> 01:06:16,471
Did you lock the back door?

1099
01:06:16,513 --> 01:06:18,181
Uh...

1100
01:06:18,223 --> 01:06:19,474
I'll check.

1101
01:06:21,476 --> 01:06:24,187
Next time, I'm coming
with a pitchfork.

1102
01:06:39,494 --> 01:06:41,079
Big John?

1103
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:43,457
Big John?

1104
01:06:47,669 --> 01:06:49,504
Yes, Little John?

1105
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:53,759
Someone's in our house.

1106
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,511
And it's not a child.

1107
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,519
Fuck that.

1108
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:20,035
I got this knife.

1109
01:07:24,873 --> 01:07:27,167
I got this knife.

1110
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:40,764
Fuck off, man.

1111
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,933
Get out of my face.

1112
01:07:42,974 --> 01:07:44,726
Lonnie, where are you?

1113
01:07:44,768 --> 01:07:46,520
I'm at the hospital right now.

1114
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:48,313
Yeah, I brought her in to E.R.

1115
01:07:49,898 --> 01:07:52,067
Is that him?

1116
01:07:53,276 --> 01:07:55,362
I saw that guy on TV.

1117
01:07:55,403 --> 01:07:57,447
Back, back, back.

1118
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,748
You know what I mean?

1119
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,210
I have no answer for you.

1120
01:08:11,211 --> 01:08:13,255
Help me.

1121
01:08:14,589 --> 01:08:15,966
Help me!

1122
01:08:21,012 --> 01:08:22,264
Tommy, what's happening?

1123
01:08:22,305 --> 01:08:23,849
- I don't know.
- Who is it?

1124
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:25,225
Um...

1125
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,519
Help me! -Who is it?
Is it Michael?

1126
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:29,479
- Is it him? -I don't know.
- It's Michael.

1127
01:08:29,521 --> 01:08:30,730
Michael's here.

1128
01:08:30,772 --> 01:08:31,898
He's not wearing his mask!

1129
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:33,984
- It's Michael.
- Michael!

1130
01:08:34,025 --> 01:08:36,570
Michael! Stop!

1131
01:08:38,655 --> 01:08:39,906
Stop!

1132
01:08:39,948 --> 01:08:41,134
Mom, Mom, you're not
going near him.

1133
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:42,659
- I'm gonna go.
- No, you're not.

1134
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:43,952
Block the doorway!

1135
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:46,121
Don't let him leave!

1136
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:48,457
- He's getting away.
- Tommy, get him!

1137
01:08:48,498 --> 01:08:50,083
Excuse me.

1138
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:53,086
Evil dies tonight!

1139
01:08:53,128 --> 01:08:54,463
- Evil dies tonight!
- Come on!

1140
01:08:54,504 --> 01:08:58,592
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1141
01:08:58,633 --> 01:09:01,219
Evil dies tonight!

1142
01:09:01,261 --> 01:09:04,139
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1143
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:06,224
Evil dies tonight!

1144
01:09:06,266 --> 01:09:10,562
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1145
01:09:13,356 --> 01:09:15,275
Little John?

1146
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:17,569
Big John.

1147
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:19,112
Yeah.

1148
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:33,794
Little John?

1149
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:35,545
Big John.

1150
01:09:50,018 --> 01:09:53,355
Little John, the study's clear.

1151
01:10:48,618 --> 01:10:50,579
Big John!

1152
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,765
Big John.

1153
01:11:09,806 --> 01:11:11,057
No.

1154
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:13,518
Big John.

1155
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:21,276
Michael.

1156
01:11:25,697 --> 01:11:28,241
You've come home.

1157
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:38,001
No!

1158
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:50,680
No, no, no, that's not...

1159
01:11:50,722 --> 01:11:53,391
- That's not him. It's not him!
- It's not him? It's not him!

1160
01:11:53,433 --> 01:11:55,102
- That's not Michael!
- It's not him!

1161
01:11:55,143 --> 01:11:57,270
- It's not him! It's not him!
- Get him!

1162
01:11:57,312 --> 01:11:58,313
It's not him!

1163
01:11:58,355 --> 01:12:00,774
You fucking sheep, it's not him!

1164
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,527
- It's not him! It's not him!
- Get out of the way!

1165
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:10,117
Mom, Mom, Mom!

1166
01:12:10,158 --> 01:12:11,159
Mom. Mom.

1167
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:13,078
Mom. Mom!

1168
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,621
I got to get you out of here.

1169
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:15,789
Tommy!

1170
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:18,166
Get back here!

1171
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:21,128
Help! Help!

1172
01:12:21,169 --> 01:12:23,797
Somebody help me!

1173
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,176
Mom! Okay.

1174
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:30,470
Okay. Okay, be careful.

1175
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:33,890
- I got it, Sheriff.
- You're gonna be okay.

1176
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:35,308
Come on.
Get him!

1177
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,685
It's not him.
I know, Mom.

1178
01:12:36,726 --> 01:12:38,854
I got her. I got her.
Go, go, go.

1179
01:12:38,895 --> 01:12:40,522
- It's... not him.
- Your arm.

1180
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:42,291
- All right, let's get her...
- They're after the wrong guy.

1181
01:12:42,315 --> 01:12:44,635
- Let's get her into bed.
- It's not him. It's not Michael.

1182
01:12:56,496 --> 01:12:58,665
Get out of the way!

1183
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,834
Okay, Mom. Come on.

1184
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,335
We got you.

1185
01:13:02,377 --> 01:13:03,754
All right, gentle. Careful.

1186
01:13:03,795 --> 01:13:05,839
Careful. I can handle this.

1187
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,924
Be careful of your head.

1188
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:10,010
Okay. All right.

1189
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:11,094
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1190
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:12,637
All right, look, stay here.

1191
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:14,490
There's gonna be guards
outside the door, all right?

1192
01:13:14,514 --> 01:13:16,200
Be careful. -I'm gonna get
a nurse to get you

1193
01:13:16,224 --> 01:13:17,577
- all hooked up again, okay?
- You be careful.

1194
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:19,519
Hospital staff sightings
on the second floor.

1195
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:24,858
Please stop!

1196
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,402
Please! It's not Michael!

1197
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:28,862
You don't know
what he looks like!

1198
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:30,906
We're in the stairwell. Move!

1199
01:13:30,947 --> 01:13:33,492
Watch it, asshole. Karen.

1200
01:13:33,533 --> 01:13:36,411
You okay?
Here, move over to the side.

1201
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:38,889
To the side with them.
Careful, careful.

1202
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,540
- He's up there!
- Stop! It's not him!

1203
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,751
- Get out of my way!
- Tommy, stop! Chill out.

1204
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:44,753
Get a grip, Tommy!

1205
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:47,005
Get the fuck out of the way!

1206
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:50,092
Knock it off!

1207
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,638
Tommy!

1208
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:56,389
We're gonna kill him!

1209
01:13:56,431 --> 01:13:57,891
CROWD Evil dies tonight!

1210
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,894
It's all happening.

1211
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,605
Michael's masterpiece.

1212
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:06,650
He created this chaos, but...

1213
01:14:06,691 --> 01:14:10,278
I'm the one that brought it all
onto Haddonfield.

1214
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,657
I could have made
all this go away.

1215
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:18,370
It was that night
that you were attacked.

1216
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:20,872
It's not your fault.

1217
01:14:20,914 --> 01:14:23,291
It's mine.

1218
01:14:27,587 --> 01:14:29,714
It was an accident.

1219
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:33,844
I was lost in my own regret.

1220
01:14:33,885 --> 01:14:35,387
Did Michael kill again?

1221
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:38,181
I saw the look

1222
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:40,517
in Loomis's eyes.

1223
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:43,937
All he wanted was more blood.

1224
01:14:45,188 --> 01:14:47,190
More death.

1225
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:48,775
And I couldn't take it.

1226
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:50,944
And then in that moment,
all I could think was that

1227
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:54,406
inside that monster,
there was somebody's baby boy.

1228
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:59,327
Purely and simply evil.

1229
01:14:59,369 --> 01:15:02,289
No! Don't!

1230
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:05,542
I could have made
all this go away.

1231
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:08,920
It's not your fault.

1232
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:11,173
It's mine.

1233
01:15:11,214 --> 01:15:13,508
But now I know...

1234
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:19,389
there's nothing
inside that man but pure evil.

1235
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:21,516
It's not just Michael.

1236
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:24,728
It's what he's done
to this town, these people.

1237
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,148
Decent people.

1238
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,983
You're a good man, Frank.

1239
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,568
You were doing your job.

1240
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,488
But now it needs to die.

1241
01:15:34,529 --> 01:15:38,366
'Cause every time
somebody's afraid,

1242
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,827
the Boogeyman wins.

1243
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:44,331
It needs to die.

1244
01:15:44,372 --> 01:15:48,585
And I'm the one
that needs to kill it.

1245
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:18,156
It's not you.

1246
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:20,075
I know it's not you.

1247
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:24,413
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1248
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,091
I know you're scared.

1249
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:39,094
They're scared, too.

1250
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,724
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.

1251
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,745
Okay.

1252
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:07,581
Okay. I know. I know.

1253
01:17:07,622 --> 01:17:10,333
I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna help you.

1254
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:12,043
Okay, come on. Come on.

1255
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:15,464
Let go of my hand.

1256
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:16,757
That's good.

1257
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,467
I'm gonna lock these doors.

1258
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,429
Okay.

1259
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,139
Okay. Lock this behind me.

1260
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:26,808
They're coming.

1261
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:28,935
They're coming.

1262
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:31,229
Come on!

1263
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:41,698
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.

1264
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,203
It's him.

1265
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:48,497
Get him! Get him!

1266
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:19,152
Evil dies tonight!

1267
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,403
Evil dies tonight!

1268
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:23,532
Evil dies tonight!

1269
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:36,086
Evil dies tonight!

1270
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:43,593
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1271
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:47,514
Stop them!

1272
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:49,307
It's not him?

1273
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:32,267
- Move!
- Evil dies tonight!

1274
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:34,060
Evil dies tonight!

1275
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,106
Oh, my God.
He's dead.

1276
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,068
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

1277
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,070
Evil dies tonight!

1278
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:55,248
Leigh! Leigh!

1279
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,501
No. It's not him.

1280
01:19:57,542 --> 01:19:59,753
It's not him, Tommy.

1281
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:03,256
He's always worn a mask.
How do we know it's not him?

1282
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:04,758
How do we know, Leigh?

1283
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:15,977
Now he's turning us
into monsters.

1284
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,049
I swear I was just trying
to do the right thing.

1285
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:48,427
Look at me.

1286
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:55,308
What I'm thinking is
the killer was choking him,

1287
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,477
Pete went for his gun.

1288
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:00,439
As he pulled it up, it went off.

1289
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,776
Give me your gun.

1290
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:06,945
Don't look at it.

1291
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:09,740
Just be cool
and give me your gun.

1292
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:11,825
Take this.

1293
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,660
It was an accident.

1294
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,328
He shot himself.

1295
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,038
Got it?

1296
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,183
Just because
your intentions are good

1297
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,376
doesn't mean things
always work out.

1298
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:25,839
I stood in the way.

1299
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,841
It was me.

1300
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,343
- It wasn't him.
- Let me find him, then.

1301
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:31,845
He's after me.

1302
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,638
No, he's not.

1303
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,182
Frank.

1304
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,976
He's not.

1305
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:40,353
It was the doctor that took him
to your house tonight.

1306
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:41,730
It wasn't Michael.

1307
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:44,065
It's not about you.

1308
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,860
- Doctor, get back in the car!
- No!

1309
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,029
I'm still gonna blow
this motherfucker's brains out.

1310
01:21:50,363 --> 01:21:52,407
Mom! Mom!

1311
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:54,659
Help!

1312
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:58,872
He's a six-year-old boy
with the strength of a man

1313
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,624
and the mind of an animal.

1314
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:02,793
I know. I've seen his face.

1315
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:06,046
I looked in his eyes
when I took off his mask.

1316
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:08,381
Did you know that
when he was a little boy

1317
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:11,676
he used to stand
in his sister's bedroom and...

1318
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:13,887
stare out the window?

1319
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:16,014
My partner died

1320
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:18,642
the night he stood
on that same spot.

1321
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:20,852
But for an instant,

1322
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:24,106
before his death, he knew.

1323
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:26,900
Maybe he wasn't looking out.

1324
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:30,362
Maybe he was looking in.

1325
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,698
At his reflection.

1326
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,534
At himself.

1327
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:40,122
Who knows what makes him kill,
what motivates him?

1328
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:45,460
But in his heart,
it always seemed to me

1329
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:48,380
he wants one thing.

1330
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:51,007
He's going home.

1331
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,051
He went from Laurie's
compound... -Mm-hmm.

1332
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:54,928
The victims in her neighborhood,

1333
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,638
to the park, okay?

1334
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,641
If you track those locations,
that's a straight line,

1335
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:01,768
basically an arrow
pointing straight

1336
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:05,188
to Lampkin Lane,
Michael's childhood home.

1337
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:09,151
I came face-to-face with
this asshole when I was a kid.

1338
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:13,321
He creeps, he kills,
he goes home.

1339
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,453
Then that's where we're going.

1340
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,163
Yeah.

1341
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:30,547
Karen. Karen.

1342
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:31,798
Listen, I'm sorry.

1343
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,341
You were right, okay?
I'm sorry.

1344
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:36,470
Tommy, you took my daughter
to chase a killer,

1345
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,513
and an innocent man is dead.

1346
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:40,640
Fuck it.
None of us are innocent.

1347
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:42,851
Karen, listen. Listen.
I fucked up.

1348
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:44,352
I fucked up. I'm sorry.

1349
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:46,062
So, what now?

1350
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:48,440
You're sorry? You're just gonna
stand here hating yourself?

1351
01:23:48,482 --> 01:23:49,608
No.

1352
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:51,651
I got to keep trying.

1353
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,153
But if I go down,

1354
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:55,614
I'm gonna go down swinging.

1355
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:00,368
I need a car.

1356
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:03,080
I have a car.

1357
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:25,519
Okay, so the key is
we stick together.

1358
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,187
No, I'm going in alone.

1359
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:28,855
- What?
- Mr. Elam.

1360
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,732
You fucking dummy,
you brought your kid

1361
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:32,609
- to the belly of the beast.
- Dad, no.

1362
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:34,277
Mr. Elam, with all due respect,

1363
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:36,530
you really expect me
to sit here while you go inside

1364
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:38,532
and confront the man
that killed my father?

1365
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:40,951
No, I don't expect you to.

1366
01:24:40,992 --> 01:24:43,203
But I'm asking, Allyson.

1367
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,539
For your sake and my son's.

1368
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:48,375
Okay? Just stay here.

1369
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:52,879
You see anything suspicious,
you honk the horn, all right?

1370
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:55,215
But you stay safe.

1371
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:57,008
All right?

1372
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:04,141
I will see you
at the finish line, buddy.

1373
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:01,990
Okay.

1374
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:13,043
This is so fucked up.

1375
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:20,550
Cameron, let's go.

1376
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,552
Come on.

1377
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:23,678
Go, go, go, go!

1378
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:34,439
Okay.

1379
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:46,618
Dad?

1380
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,505
CAMERON Allyson.

1381
01:26:58,547 --> 01:27:00,382
Over there.

1382
01:29:32,743 --> 01:29:34,578
Dad.

1383
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:40,624
Cameron?

1384
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:09,654
Allyson!

1385
01:30:09,696 --> 01:30:10,697
Cameron!

1386
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:20,707
Cameron!

1387
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:23,418
No!

1388
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:27,756
Cameron! No!

1389
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,050
Cameron!

1390
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:32,969
ALLYSON No.

1391
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:34,888
No, no, no, no!

1392
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:36,765
No!

1393
01:30:36,807 --> 01:30:38,850
- Allyson!
- No!

1394
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:44,898
Come and get me, motherfucker!

1395
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,025
Come and get me.

1396
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:19,057
Leave him alone!

1397
01:31:20,809 --> 01:31:22,352
No.

1398
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:24,229
No. No!

1399
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:26,606
No!

1400
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:32,487
No!

1401
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:47,502
Do it. Do it.

1402
01:31:48,295 --> 01:31:49,755
Do it!

1403
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,610
Mom.

1404
01:32:24,748 --> 01:32:26,708
Mom.

1405
01:32:33,215 --> 01:32:34,508
No, Mom.

1406
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,009
You want your mask?

1407
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:37,469
Come and get it!

1408
01:32:37,511 --> 01:32:40,347
You want to fucking
kill someone, take me!

1409
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:43,058
Mom. No, Mom.

1410
01:32:46,353 --> 01:32:48,313
I'm an innocent woman,

1411
01:32:48,355 --> 01:32:50,357
just like your sister was.

1412
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:52,400
It was Halloween night.

1413
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:54,319
She was in her bedroom.

1414
01:32:54,361 --> 01:32:56,530
And it was right here.

1415
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:58,448
Your house.

1416
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:01,368
Can't you feel it?

1417
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:03,370
ALLYSON
No. No, Mom.

1418
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:08,542
Mom, no.

1419
01:33:15,674 --> 01:33:18,427
Mom!

1420
01:33:56,798 --> 01:33:58,633
Gotcha.

1421
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,230
Hey, Michael.

1422
01:34:12,272 --> 01:34:13,857
It's Halloween.

1423
01:34:13,899 --> 01:34:17,027
Everyone's entitled
to one good scare.

1424
01:34:57,901 --> 01:35:01,113
Light him up.
Let's take him.

1425
01:35:42,404 --> 01:35:43,989
We got this, Karen.

1426
01:35:45,407 --> 01:35:47,659
Go be with your daughter.

1427
01:36:11,641 --> 01:36:13,643
I always thought Michael Myers

1428
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:17,731
was flesh and blood,
just like you and me,

1429
01:36:17,773 --> 01:36:19,608
but a mortal man
could not have survived

1430
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,151
what he's lived through.

1431
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:24,488
The more he kills,

1432
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,239
the more he transcends

1433
01:36:26,281 --> 01:36:29,910
into something else
impossible to defeat.

1434
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:31,620
Fear.

1435
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:33,622
People are afraid.

1436
01:36:33,663 --> 01:36:37,000
That is the true curse
of Michael.

1437
01:36:37,042 --> 01:36:39,753
He'll always be here, won't he?

1438
01:36:39,795 --> 01:36:41,963
Even when we can't see him.

1439
01:36:48,011 --> 01:36:50,305
You can't defeat it
with brute force.

1440
01:36:51,807 --> 01:36:54,935
If we only knew then
what we know now.

1441
01:37:33,056 --> 01:37:35,308
It is the essence of evil.

1442
01:37:37,394 --> 01:37:39,312
The anchor that divides us.

1443
01:37:40,647 --> 01:37:44,359
It is the terror that grows
stronger when we try to hide.

1444
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:20,187
If they don't stop him tonight,

1445
01:38:20,228 --> 01:38:22,522
maybe we'll find him tomorrow.

1446
01:38:22,564 --> 01:38:24,107
Or next Halloween,

1447
01:38:24,149 --> 01:38:27,778
when the sun sets
and someone is alone.

1448
01:39:04,314 --> 01:39:07,901
You can't close your eyes
and pretend he isn't there.

1449
01:39:12,948 --> 01:39:15,242
Because he is.
