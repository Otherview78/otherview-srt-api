1
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,064
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,281
You know...

3
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:59,453
I'll bet I could fry an egg
on your head right now.

4
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,997
If I wanted to.

5
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,500
You know, kiddo...

6
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:13,592
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,

7
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:20,015
to know that there's nothing
sadistic in my actions.

8
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:26,021
Well, maybe towards those other jokers.

9
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,483
But not you.

10
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,154
No, kiddo.

11
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,198
At this moment...

12
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,161
This is me...

13
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,831
At my most... Masochistic.

14
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,459
Bill...

15
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,044
It's your baby.

16
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,824
Coming!

17
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,577
Sarah, I cannot believe you are early.

18
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,935
What you gonna do now, huh?
What you got?

19
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,312
I got your ass!
Remember that? Huh? Remember?

20
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,157
Okay. Come on, bitch.

21
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,828
Come on. Bring it on.

22
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:13,785
Mommy, I'm home.

23
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,662
Hey, baby.

24
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,664
How was school?

25
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,210
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?

26
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,795
Oh.

27
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,382
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his little ass

28
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,634
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.

29
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,885
That's what happened, baby.

30
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,846
- Barney did this?
- Baby...

31
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,931
Now, you can't come in here.

32
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,934
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.

33
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,861
This is an old friend of mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

34
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,238
Hi, honey.

35
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,906
I'm ...

36
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,324
What's your name?

37
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,747
Her name is Nikki.

38
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,707
Nikki.

39
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,586
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.

40
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,922
How old are you, Nikki?

41
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,010
Nikki...

42
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,762
... asked you a question.

43
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,890
I'm 4.

44
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,933
4 years old, eh?

45
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:24,773
You know, I had a little girl once.

46
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,901
She'd be about 4 now.

47
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,824
Now, baby, me and mommy's friend
got some grown-up talk

48
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:35,992
to talk about.

49
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,702
So you can go in your room now.

50
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,371
And I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.

51
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,457
Okay?

52
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,001
Nikkia!

53
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,963
In your room. Now.

54
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,852
You want some coffee?

55
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,313
Yeah. Sure.

56
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,905
<i>This Pasadena homemaker's name

57
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,490
<i>is Jeanne Bell.

58
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,992
<i>Her husband is Dr. Lawrence Bell.

59
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,745
<i>But back when we were acquainted,
four years ago,

60
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,039
<i>her name was Vernita Green.

61
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,792
<i>Her code name was Copperhead.

62
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,460
<i>Mine, Black Mamba.

63
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,003
Do you have a towel?

64
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,923
Yeah.

65
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,469
Thanks.

66
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,304
You still take cream and sugar, right?

67
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,514
Yeah.

68
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,395
So I suppose it's a little late
for an apology, huh?

69
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,897
You suppose correctly.

70
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,024
Look, bitch, I need to know

71
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,819
if you're gonna start any more
shit around my baby girl.

72
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,988
You can relax for now.

73
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,950
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?

74
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,745
That's being more rational

75
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,998
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.

76
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:09,002
It's mercy, compassion,
and forgiveness I lack.

77
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,379
Not rationality.

78
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,468
Look.

79
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,888
I know I fucked you over.

80
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,055
I fucked you over bad.

81
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,892
I wish to God I hadn't, but I did.

82
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,561
You have every right to want to get even.

83
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,897
No, no, no, no, no.

84
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,440
No.

85
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,985
To get even, even Stephen,

86
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,071
I would have to kill you,

87
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,700
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,

88
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,077
then wait for your husband, the
good Dr. Bell, to come home,

89
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,580
and kill him.

90
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,916
That would be even, Vernita.

91
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,210
That'd be about square.

92
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,046
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.

93
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,964
But I can't.

94
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,052
All I can tell you is that I'm
a different person now.

95
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,096
Oh, great.

96
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,097
I don't care.

97
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,099
Be that as it may,

98
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,144
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.

99
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:12,690
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.

100
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,903
Bitch, you can stop right there.

101
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,656
Just because I have no wish to murder you

102
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,157
before the eyes of your daughter

103
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,660
does not mean that parading
her around in front of me

104
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,579
is gonna inspire sympathy.

105
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,874
You and I have unfinished business.

106
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,001
And not a goddamn fucking
thing you've done

107
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,503
in the subsequent four years,

108
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,882
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.

109
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,177
So when do we do this?

110
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,554
It all depends.

111
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,015
When do you want to die?

112
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,977
Tomorrow? The day after tomorrow?

113
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,478
How about tonight, bitch?

114
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,814
Splendid. Where?

115
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,108
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach our little league

116
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,193
about a mile from here.

117
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,279
We meet there around 2:30 in the morning,

118
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:03,199
dressed all in black,
your hair in a black stocking.

119
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,160
And we have us a knife fight.

120
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,162
We won't be bothered.

121
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,206
Now...

122
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,251
I have to fix Nikki's cereal.

123
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,178
Bill always said you were one
of the best ladies he ever saw

124
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,805
with an edged weapon.

125
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,057
Fuck you, bitch.

126
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,476
I know he didn't qualify that shit.

127
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,938
So you can just kiss my
motherfucking ass, Black Mamba.

128
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,108
Black Mamba.

129
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,861
I should have been motherfucking Black Mamba.

130
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,903
Weapon of choice? Hey,

131
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,322
if you want to stick with
your butcher knife,

132
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,990
that's fine with me.

133
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,994
Very funny, bitch.

134
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,038
Very funny!

135
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,015
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.

136
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,061
For that, I'm sorry.

137
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,606
But you can take my word for it.

138
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,112
Your mother had it coming.

139
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,046
When you grow up...

140
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,633
If you still feel raw about it...

141
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,680
I'll be waiting.

142
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,961
<i>Y'all, come on out to Dallas, ya hear?

143
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,423
<i>This is rockabilly rhythms on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

144
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,092
<i>And next, we got some record.

145
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,845
<i>Very own wild man, Charlie feathers.

146
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:33,177
Well, give me the gory details, son number one.

147
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,097
It's a goddamn massacre, pop.

148
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,269
They wiped out the whole wedding party,
execution style.

149
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,438
Give me a figure.

150
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,566
Nine dead bodies.

151
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,110
And we're talking the whole shebang.

152
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,238
Bride. Groom.

153
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,073
Reverend.

154
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,534
Reverend's wife.

155
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,286
Hell, they even shot that old colored fella

156
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,038
that plays the organ.

157
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,374
It would appear to me
somebody objected to this union

158
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,043
and wasn't able to hold their peace.

159
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:14,135
Good gravy, Marie.

160
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,225
What'd I tell you, pop?

161
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,395
It's like a goddamn Nicaraguan death squad.

162
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,315
You better shit-can that blasphemy, boy.

163
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,941
You're in a house of worship.

164
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,026
Sorry, pop.

165
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,281
Well, this is definitely the work of professionals.

166
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:40,036
I'd guesstimate Mexican mafia hit squad.

167
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,580
Four, maybe five strong.

168
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,457
How can you tell?

169
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,002
Well, a sure and steady hand did this.

170
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,714
This ain't no squirrelly amateur.

171
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,051
This is the work of a salty dog.

172
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,304
You can tell by the cleanliness of the carnage.

173
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,682
Now, a kill-crazy rampage, though it may be,

174
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,061
all the colors are kept inside the lines.

175
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:09,023
If you was a moron, you could almost admire it.

176
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,037
Who's the bride?

177
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,622
Don't know.

178
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,248
The name on the marriage certificate

179
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,001
is Arlene Machiavelli.

180
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,128
That's a fake.

181
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,172
We've all just been calling her "the bride"

182
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,382
on account of the dress.

183
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,967
You can tell she was pregnant.

184
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,636
Man would have to be a mad dog

185
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:43,182
to shoot a goddamn good-looking
gal like that in the head.

186
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,560
Look at her.

187
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:54,026
Hay-colored hair. Big eyes.

188
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,028
She's a little blood-spattered angel.

189
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,951
Son number one?

190
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,327
Yeah?

191
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:08,165
This tall drink of cocksucker ain't dead.

192
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,698
I might never have liked you.

193
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:50,160
Point in fact, I despise you.

194
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:55,499
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

195
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,797
Dying in our sleep is a luxury

196
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,884
that our kind is rarely afforded.

197
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:08,679
My gift to you.

198
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,896
For fuck's sake.

199
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,609
Hello, Bill.

200
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,404
What's her condition?

201
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,698
Comatose.

202
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,825
Where is she?

203
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,245
I'm standing over her right now.

204
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,456
That's my girl.

205
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,086
Elle, you're going to abort the mission.

206
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,171
<i>What?!

207
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,797
We owe her better than that.

208
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,591
Oh, you don't owe her shit!

209
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,259
Will you keep your voice down?

210
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,261
You don't owe her shit!

211
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,388
May I say one thing?

212
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,307
Speak.

213
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,393
Y'all beat the hell out of that woman.

214
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,479
But you didn't kill her.

215
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,356
And I put a bullet in her head.

216
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,567
But her heart just kept on beating.

217
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,402
Now, you saw that yourself

218
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:11,200
with your own beautiful blue eye, did you not?

219
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,828
<i>We've done a lot of things to this lady.

220
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:18,916
<i>And if she ever wakes up, we'll do a whole lot more.

221
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,378
But one thing we won't do

222
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,715
is sneak into her room in the night like a filthy rat

223
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,761
<i>and kill her in her sleep.

224
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,472
<i>And the reason we won't do that thing

225
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:38,727
is because that thing would lower us.

226
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,854
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

227
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,941
I guess.

228
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,652
Do you really have to guess?

229
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,696
No.

230
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:52,783
I don't really have to guess. I know.

231
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,286
Come on home, honey.

232
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,665
Affirmative.

233
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,835
I love you very much.

234
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,546
I love you, too.

235
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,967
Bye-bye.

236
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,439
Thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?

237
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,611
Word of advice, shithead.

238
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,865
Don't you ever wake up.

239
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:11,862
<i>At this moment, this is me...

240
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,323
At my most masochistic.

241
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,576
Bill, it's your baby.

242
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,975
Oh, my baby.

243
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,752
Four years.

244
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,546
Four years.

245
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,786
The price is $75 a fuck, my friend.

246
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,038
You getting your freak on or what?

247
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,665
Oh, yeah, boy.

248
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,963
20, 40, 60, 75.

249
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,007
Yeah. Now, here's the rules.

250
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,550
Rule number one.

251
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,010
No punching her.

252
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,595
Nurse comes in tomorrow and she got her a shiner

253
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,347
or less some teeth, jig's up.

254
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,099
So no knuckle sandwiches under no circumstances.

255
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,976
And by the way, this little cunt's a spitter.

256
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,271
It's a motor-reflex thing.
But spit or no, no punching.

257
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,981
Now, are we absolutely, positively clear

258
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,483
- on rule number one?
- Yeah.

259
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,026
Good. Now, rule number two.

260
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,903
No monkey bites, no hickeys.

261
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,572
In fact, no leaving no marks of no kind.

262
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,491
After that, it's all good, buddy.

263
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,078
Now, her plumbing down there don't work no more.

264
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,746
So feel free to come in her all you want.

265
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,081
Keep the noise down. Try not to make a mess.

266
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,582
I'll be back in 20.

267
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,543
Yeah.

268
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,128
Oh, shit.

269
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,630
By the way...

270
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,340
Not all the time, but sometimes

271
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,051
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

272
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,261
If she dry, you just lube up with this

273
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,595
and you'll be good to go.

274
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,890
Bon appetit, good buddy.

275
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:41,113
Oh, yeah.

276
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,781
Oh, god damn.

277
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:46,576
You are the best-looking girl I've had today.

278
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,668
Yo, stud! Time's up, buddy.

279
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,420
Coming in, ready or not.

280
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,007
Hey, buddy, did you have
yourself a good time, man?

281
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,165
Where's Bill?!

282
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,001
Where's Bill?!

283
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,253
Please stop hitting me.

284
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:21,671
Where's Bill?!

285
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,883
I don't know who Bill is!

286
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,259
Bullshit!

287
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:38,146
Well, ain't you the slice
of cutie pie they said you was?

288
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,607
Jane Doe, huh? Oh, we don't know
shit about you, do we?

289
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,193
Well, I'm from Huntsville, Texas.

290
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:47,030
My name is Buck, and I'm here to fuck.

291
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,036
Your name is Buck.

292
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,996
Right?

293
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,125
And you came here to fuck.

294
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,668
Right?

295
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,128
Wait a minute. Wait.

296
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,947
"Pussy wagon."

297
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,158
You fucker.

298
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,271
<i>Texas Okay.

299
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,879
Wiggle your big toe.

300
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,303
Wiggle your big toe.

301
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,980
Wiggle your big toe.

302
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,613
Wiggle your big toe.

303
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,286
Wiggle your big toe.

304
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,913
<i>As I lay in the back of Buck's truck,

305

00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,251
Wiggle your big toe.

307
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:32,047
<i>...I could see the faces of
the cunts who did this to me.

308
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,343
<i>And the dicks responsible.

309
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:42,140
<i>Members all of the Deadly Viper
assassination squad.

310
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,144
<i>When fortune smiles on something

311
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,480
<i>as violent and ugly as revenge,

312
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,400
<i>it seems proof like no other

313
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,444
<i>you're doing His will.

314
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,197
<i>At a time when I knew the least
about my enemies,

315
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,324
<i>the first name on my death list,

316
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:03,119
<i>O-Ren Ishii, was the easiest to find.

317
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:06,122
<i>But, of course, when one manages the difficult task

318
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:08,583
<i>of becoming queen of the Tokyo underworld,

319
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,127
<i>one doesn't keep it a secret, does one?

320
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,561
<i>O-Ren Ishii was born
on an American military base

321
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,064
<i>in Tokyo, Japan.

322
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,693
<i>The half-Japanese, half-chinese
American army brat

323
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:38,113
<i>made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of nine.

324
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,198
<i>It was at that age she witnessed

325
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,283
<i>the death of her parents at the hands

326
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:47,997
<i>of Japan's most ruthless
Yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.

327
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,235
Mommy.

328
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:16,391
<i>She swore revenge.

329
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:21,479
<i>Luckily for her,
Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile.

330
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,859
<i>At 11, she got her revenge.

331
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:14,008
<i>By 20, she was one of the top female

332
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,094
<i>assassins in the world.

333
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:06,018
<i>At 25, she did her part in the killing

00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,955
<i>She should have killed 10.

338
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:30,877
<i>However, before satisfaction would be mine,

<i>first things first.

340
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:36,048
Wiggle your big toe.

341
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,183
Hard part's over.

342
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:49,020
Now, let's get these other piggies wiggling.

343
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,890
Welcome to Air O. May I help you?

344
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,059
Okinawa. One-way.

345
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,712
Hi.

346
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,890
You English?

347
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:10,268
Almost. American.

348
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:13,104
American. Welcome, American.

349
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,648
Domo.

350
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,234
My English very good.

351
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,779
You said "domo." Can you speak Japanese?

352
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,114
No, no.

353
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,992
Just a few words I learned since yesterday.

354
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,703
Um, may I sit at the bar?

355
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,998
Oh, sure, sure, sure. Please sit.

356
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,836
What other words did you learn?

357
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,922
Oh, just a minute.

358
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,024
Shut up!

359
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,901
Get your ass out here!

360
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,695
Uh, excuse me.

361
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,576
Uh, what other Japanese do you know?

362
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:09,994
Oh, let's see.

363
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,996
Um, "arigato."

364
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,415
"Arigato." Good!

365
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,711
I already said "domo", right?

366
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,173
"Konn-itch-iwa."

367
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,093
"Kohn-nee-chee-wah."

368
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,345
Konnichi wa. Please repeat.

369
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,013
Konnichi wa.

370
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,056
Perfect.

371
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:31,974
Good, good, good.

372
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:34,935
You say Japanese word like you Japanese.

373
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,145
Oh, now you're making fun of me!

374
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:39,148
No, no, no, no. Serious business.

375
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,818
Pronunciation very good.

376
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:46,572
You say arigato like we say arigato.

377
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,119
Well, thank you. I mean...

378
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,662
Arigato.

379
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,083
You should learn Japanese.

380
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:58,626
Very easy.

381
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,629
No kidding. I heard it was kind of hard.

382
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,798
Most difficult.

383
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,883
But you have Japanese tongue.

384
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,263
Okay, okay.

385
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:13,099
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

386
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:17,603
Oh. Oh, my god.

387
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,751
I beg your pardon?

388
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,087
Uh, drink.

389
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,338
Oh, yes.

390
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:47,091
Um, a bottle of warm sake, please.

391
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,926
Warm sake?

392
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,137
Very good!

393
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:27,256
Do you understand?

394
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,010
Do you understand me?

395
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:36,015
Sorry.

396
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,978
Oh! Oh, oh. First time in Japan?

397
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:46,025
What brings you to Okinawa?

398
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,027
I came to see a man.

399
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,779
Oh, yeah.

400
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,324
You have a friend live in Okinawa?

401
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,075
Not quite.

402
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,911
Not friend?

403
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,662
I never met him.

404
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,789
Never?

405
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:02,333
Who is he?

406
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,168
May I ask?

407
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,005
Hattori Hanzo.

408
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:45,751
You must have big rats,
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.

409
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,047
Huge.

410
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,803
May I?

411
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,847
You may.

412
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,018
Wait.

413
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,604
Try the second one down.

414
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:23,492
Funny.

415
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,078
You like samurai swords...

416
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,583
I like baseball.

417
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,181
Then give me one of these.

418
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,641
These are not for sale.

419
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,312
I didn't say "sell me."

420
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,230
I said "give me."

421
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:40,778
Why should I help you?

422
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:46,116
Because my vermin is a former student of yours.

423
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,538
And considering the student,

424
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:57,085
I'd say you have a rather large obligation.

425
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,985
Domo.

426
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,133
<i>It was one year after

427
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,510
<i>the massacre in el Paso, Texas,

428
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:17,512

<i>over who would rule vice in the city of Tokyo.

<i>When the final sword was sheathed,

00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,944
<i>it was O-Ren Ishii and her powerful posse...

00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,949
<i>... The crazy 88, that proved the victor.

436
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,162
<i>The pretty lady to O-Ren's right,

437
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:45,040

438

<i>The young girl in the school-girl uniform

443
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:06,770
<i>is O-Ren's personal bodyguard, 17-year-old Gogo Yubari.

444
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,898
<i>Gogo may be young, but what she lacks in age,

445
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,734
<i>she makes up for in madness.

446
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,529
<i>See what I mean?

01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:16,214

452
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,596
<i>I'll tell you.

453
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,724
<i>The subject of O-Ren's blood and nationality

454
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,143
<i>came up before the council only once

455
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:33,273
<i>the night O-Ren assumed power over the crime council.

456
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,817
<i>The man who seems bound and determined

01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:38,195
<i>to break the mood is Boss Tanaka.

458
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:42,073
<i>And what Boss Tanaka thinks is...

459
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,087
As your leader...

460
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:02,756
...I encourage you from time to time,

461
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,966
and always in a respectful manner,

462
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,052
to question my logic.

463
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,720
If you're unconvinced

464
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:11,014
a particular plan of action I've decided is the wisest,

465
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,098
tell me so.

466
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,975
But allow me to convince you.

467
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:16,102
And I promise you, right here and now,

468
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:19,898
no subject will ever be taboo.

469
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:23,068
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.

470
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,072
The price you pay

471
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:30,033
for bringing up either my Chinese or American heritage

472
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,951
as a negative is...

473
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:34,120
I collect your fucking head.

474
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,748
Just like this fucker here.

475
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,294
Now, if any of you sons of bitches

476
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:46,257
got anything else to say, now is the fucking time!

477
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,178
I didn't think so.

478
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:58,061
One ticket to Tokyo, please.

479
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:35,009
Hello.

480
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,984
Gogo.

481
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:37,570
So, O-Ren...

482
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,531
Any more subordinates for me to kill?

483
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:43,534
Hi!

484
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,373
Bingo.

485
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:02,845
Gogo...

486
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:06,140
I know you feel you must protect your mistress.

487
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:09,852
But I beg you...

488
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:12,771
Walk away.

489
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:45,150
Is that what I think it is?

490
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:47,903
You didn't think it was gonna be that easy, did you?

491
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:52,116
You know, for a second there,

492
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:55,119
yeah, I kind of did.

493
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:58,080
Silly rabbit.

494
01:21:58,163 --> 01:21:59,289
Trix are for...

495
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:00,749
Kids.

496
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:31,097
This is what you get

497
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:34,100
for fucking around with Yakuzas!

498
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:36,144
Go home to your mother!

499
01:29:57,809 --> 01:30:00,896
Except you, Sofie!

500
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:04,608
You stay right where you are.

501
01:30:57,827 --> 01:31:00,497
Your instrument is quite impressive.

502
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,173
Okinawa.

503
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,181
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

504
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:39,048
Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords.

505
01:34:41,301 --> 01:34:44,554
You may not be able to fight like a samurai...

506
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:50,643
But you can at least die like a samurai.

507
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,819
Sofie...

508
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:53,362
Sofie...

509
01:39:53,446 --> 01:39:55,740
My Sofie...

510
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:58,159
I'm so sorry.

511
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:05,082
Please. Please forgive my betrayal.

512
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:06,918
No more of that.

513
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:08,711
But still...

514
01:40:08,794 --> 01:40:12,882
But still nothing...

515
01:40:12,965 --> 01:40:16,594
Except my aching heart over what she's done

516
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:20,223
to my beautiful and brilliant Sofie.

517
01:40:20,306 --> 01:40:22,850
I've kept you alive for two reasons.

518
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:26,062
The first reason is information.

519
01:40:31,067 --> 01:40:36,030
But I am gonna ask you questions.

520
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:40,952
And every time you don't give me answers,

521
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:44,038
I'm gonna cut something off.

522
01:40:44,121 --> 01:40:45,998
And I promise you,

523
01:40:46,082 --> 01:40:50,169
they will be things you will miss!

524
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:51,212
Give me your other arm!

525
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:59,971
I want all the information on the Deadly Vipers.

526
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:01,389
If you had to guess...

527
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:02,890
What they've been doing...

528
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:04,141
...Why she left you alive...

529
01:41:04,225 --> 01:41:05,810
...And where I can find them.

530
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:07,562
...What would be your guess?

531
01:41:09,564 --> 01:41:12,733
Guessing won't be necessary.

532
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:14,443
She informed me.

533
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,906
She... she said I could keep my wicked life

534
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:21,117
for two reasons.

535
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,286
As I said before,

536
01:41:23,369 --> 01:41:27,498
I've allowed you to keep your
wicked life for two reasons.

537
01:41:27,582 --> 01:41:30,001
And the second reason is...

538
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:33,212
So you can tell him, in person,

539
01:41:33,296 --> 01:41:37,091
everything that happened here tonight.

540
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:40,303
I want him to witness the extent of my mercy

541
01:41:40,386 --> 01:41:43,472
by witnessing your deformed body.

542
01:41:43,889 --> 01:41:45,308
I want you to tell him

543
01:41:45,391 --> 01:41:48,185
all the information you just told me.

544
01:41:48,269 --> 01:41:51,272
I want him to know what I know.

545
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:55,484
I want him to know I want him to know.

546
01:41:55,568 --> 01:41:58,112
And I want them all to know

547
01:41:58,195 --> 01:42:04,160
they'll all soon be as dead as O-Ren.

548
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,332
That woman...

549
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:54,210
Deserves her revenge.

550
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:01,050
And...

551
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:03,302
We deserve to die.

552
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:10,559
<i>She must suffer to her last breath.

553
01:43:23,114 --> 01:43:25,950
How did you find me?

554
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:27,868
I'm the man.

555
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:35,209
One more thing, Sofie.

556
01:43:35,292 --> 01:43:39,338
Is she aware her daughter is still alive?
