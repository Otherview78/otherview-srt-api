1
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,126
<i>I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.</i>

2
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:47,924
<i>I want my environment
to be a product of me.</i>

3
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,387
<i>Years ago, we had the Church.</i>

4
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:58,184
<i>That was only a way
of saying we had each other.</i>

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,730
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

6
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:05,107
It put hate in your heart.

7
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,653
<i>The Knights of Columbus were
real head-breakers.</i>

8
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,071
<i>True guineas.</i>

9
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:12,782
<i>They took over their piece of the city.</i>

10
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:19,330
<i>Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get
a fucking job...</i>

11
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:23,668
<i>...we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.</i>

12
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:27,129
<i>That's what the niggers don't realize.</i>

13
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,550
<i>If I got one thing
against the black chappies, it's this:</i>

14
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,844
<i>No one gives it to you.</i>

15
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,930
<i>You have to take it.</i>

16
00:01:57,368 --> 00:02:01,163
Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.

17
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,833
Won't happen again, Mr. C.

18
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:10,256
Carmen's developing
into a fine young lady.

19
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:12,550
You should be proud.

20
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,898
You get your period yet, Carmen?

21
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,042
You Johnny Sullivan's kid?

22
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,213
- You live with your grandmother?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:55,760
Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread,
couple half-gallons of milk.

24
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,471
Do you like bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.

25
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:03,225
Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?

26
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,104
You do good in school?

27
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:12,234
- Yeah.
- That's good. I did too.

28
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,987
They call that a paradox.

29
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:20,117
Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.

30
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:29,877
You ever wanna earn a little extra money,
you come by I Street.

31
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,755
You know where I am on I Street?

32
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,548
Good.

33
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,259
- Good boy.
- Thanks.

34
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,182
To you, O Lord, we commend the soul
of Alphonsus, your servant.

35
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,351
In the sight of this world,
he is now dead.

36
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:48,646
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

37
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:51,148
- Amen.
- <i>The Church wants you in your place.</i>

38
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,859
Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.

39
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:57,530
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

40
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,865
A man makes his own way.

41
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,659
No one gives it to you.

42
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,661
You have to take it.

43
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:08,124
- James Joyce.
- Smart, Colin.

44
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,751
Guineas from the North End,
down Providence...

45
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,629
...tried to tell me what to do.

46
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:17,550
And something maybe happened to them.

47
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,720
Maybe like that:

48
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:32,231
Jeez. She fell funny.

49
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,653
Francis, you really should see somebody.

50
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,115
<i>When you decide to be something,
you can be it.</i>

51
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,535
That's what they don't tell you
in the Church.

52
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:49,248
When I was your age, they would say
we could become cops or criminals.

53
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:52,209
Today what I'm saying to you is this:

54
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:55,921
When you're facing a loaded gun...

55
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,050
...what's the difference?

56
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,055
<i>That's my boy.</i>

57
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:08,350
Terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile...

58
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,228
...as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.

59
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:14,482
Take, for instance, what you carry,
9 mm hollow-point.

60
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,277
When the hollow-point hits the skull,
what happens is it mushrooms.

61
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:21,322
<i>When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...</i>

62
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:24,658
...ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades--

63
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:25,951
Sir, yes, sir!

64
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,580
<i>--Tearing their internal organs,
their liver, their lungs, their heart...</i>

65
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:33,292
...bringing tissue, bone, blood,
brain matter, and that's called a blowback.

66
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,385
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

67
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:47,348
Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.

68
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:51,227
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.

69
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,188
Pencils.

70
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,237
Begin.

71
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,955
What are you looking at?

72
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,167
Forget it.

73
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:18,963
Your father was a janitor,
his son's only a cop.

74
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,261
Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.

75
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,221
They are.

76
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:30,975
So she tells me, "You never finish anything.
You finish the police course...

77
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:36,564
...you get taken care of again, baby."
So after graduation, I get a blow job again.

78
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,567
That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderful woman.

79
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,776
Fuck yourself.

80
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,320
Put it this way.
You're a black guy in Boston.

81
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,031
You don't need any help from me
to be completely fucked.

82
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:49,493
The Massachusetts State Police
has a long tradition of excellence.

83
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:53,163
Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance...

84
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,417
...into one of the finest law enforcement
agencies in our nation.

85
00:06:56,584 --> 00:07:00,337
As the governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I am confident...

86
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:05,884
...each and every one of you will serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.

87
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,012
Congratulations to all our new troopers.

88
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,265
Thank you. You are dismissed.

89
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:25,487
Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out
of the gate, congratulations.

90
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:29,408
- We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
- No, I'll catch up with you guys.

91
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,377
School's out.

92
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,048
Thank you, Frank.

93
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,883
You earned it.

94
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,094
No more pencils, no more books.

95
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,806
All right.

96
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,516
<i>This is not the regular police...</i>

97
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,560
- <i>...this is the state police.</i>
- And fire!

98
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,896
<i>Your training will illustrate the difference.</i>

99
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:01,732
State police, search warrant!
State police, open the door!

100
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,275
<i>What's the difference?</i>

101
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,861
- Go, go, go!
- <i>Sir, yes, sir!</i>

102
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,073
<i>-Is that understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

103
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,409
Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.

104
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,340
Congratulations on passing
the detective's exam, and welcome...

105
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:30,010
- ...to the Special Investigation Unit.
- Whoop-de-fucking-do.

106
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,055
We won't be working together,
that is, directly.

107
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:37,059
You'll be working for Captain Ellerby,
but I like to see everybody.

108
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,730
You're a worker. You rise fast.

109
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,899
Like a 12-year-old's dick.

110
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,112
- Thank you, sergeant.
- My pleasure.

111
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,614
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

112
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:00,040
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, hon.

113
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,837
You can go in there now.

114
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:12,761
You can sit.

115
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,435
So...

116
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,355
Do you know what we do here?
My section?

117
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,318
- Yes, sir, I have an idea--
- Let's say you have no idea...

118
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,195
...and leave it at that, okay?

119
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,865
No idea. Zip. None.

120
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,994
If you had an idea what we do, we would
not be good at what we do, would we?

121
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,662
We would be cunts.

122
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,873
Are you calling us cunts?

123
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,459
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.

124
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,545
I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.

125
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:51,175
So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

126
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,886
Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

127
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,684
He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.

128
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:05,189
Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.

129
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:09,067
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

130
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,197
That's right.

131
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,741
- I remember his funeral.
- Oh, good.

132
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,160
Closed casket?

133
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,580
That's right.

134
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,124
So tell anybody up at Deerfield--

135
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,419
Before you got kicked out for whaling
on a gym teacher with a chair.

136
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,005
- -You had an uncle met his demise
like that?

137
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,928
I got a question.

138
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,180
How fucked up are you?

139
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,568
Hi, Darlene.

140
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,991
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

141
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:02,955
- SIU. What a country.
- Perfect.

142
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,084
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

143
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,420
You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.

144
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,257
We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.

145
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:18,136
All right, look it, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.

146
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,430
You got any suits,
or do you like...

147
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,433
...coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?

148
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,438
You got quite the family tree.
That maggot uncle of yours...

149
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,942
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns...

150
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:35,153
...to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

151
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,657
- ...from our normative behavior.
- And what's this got to do with me?

152
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,617
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

153
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,958
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

154
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,670
You have been selected for it
on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.

155
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,965
This is an elite unit.

156
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:59,386
Our job is to smash
or marginally disrupt...

157
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,638
...organized crime in this city...

158
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,516
...by enhanced cooperation
with the FBI...

159
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:07,477
...represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

160
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,813
And we will do it.

161
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,442
And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.

162
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,903
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.

163
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,155
Jackie met his demise.

164
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,240
Last known photograph.

165
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,869
Costello uses three key guys.

166
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:27,581
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.

167
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,459
She's straight out of <i>Going My Way.</i>

168
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,711
Delahunt, muscle.

169
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:36,840
French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

170
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,760
We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want all ideas...

171
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,095
...so I can pass them off as my own.

172
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,390
Work hard, you'll rise fast.
You're in the best possible position...

173
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,351
...in the department.
Let's go to work.

174
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,811
Your old man was a fucking hump
from Southie.

175
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,940
Baggage handler at the airport, right?

176
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,567
Family's all criminals except
for the old man, huh?

177
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:58,195
And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.

178
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:02,240
Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old
boy, living on a beach in Thailand.

179
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,327
Fucking family's dug
into the Southie projects like ticks.

180
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,788
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

181
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:11,833
...on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.

182
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,211
You were kind of a double kid,
I bet, right?

183
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,339
One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.

184
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:20,759
You're upper-middle class during the weeks,
then you're hanging...

185
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,887
...in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey...

186
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,556
...on the weekends. I got that right?

187
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,519
Yup. You have different accents?

188
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,563
You did, didn't you,
you little fucking snake?

189
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,984
- You were like different people.
- You a psychiatrist?

190
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,112
If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.

191
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,782
And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouldn't get an answer.

192
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:49,037
Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker
like you doing in the staties?

193
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,542
Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?

194
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:56,336
- Who said that?
- Hawthorne.

195
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,799
What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?

196
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,138
We have a question.

197
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:11,977
Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?

198
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,437
It's an honest question.

199
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,274
Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

200
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,110
A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger
through a window--

201
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:23,071
I'm set without your
own personal job application, sergeant.

202
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,490
- What did you say?
- Sir, what do you want from me?

203
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,783
Hey, he can't help you.

204
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,910
I know what you are.
I know what you are...

205
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,454
...and I know what you're not.

206
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,041
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
help you understand something.

207
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,168
You're no fucking cop.

208
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,881
He's right.
We deal in deception here.

209
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,884
What we do not deal with
is self-deception.

210
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,887
Five years from now you could be
anything else in the world.

211
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:50,640
But you will not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.

212
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,477
- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of that.

213
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,811
Guaran-fucking-teed.

214
00:14:57,064 --> 00:15:01,651
You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

215
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,781
You don't have much family.

216
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,450
I don't have any family.

217
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,459
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?

218
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:20,545
Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?

219
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:24,132
- That Stephanie?
- Yeah, that Stephanie.

220
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:28,136
- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.
- Trying to prove something to the family?

221
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:33,308
When you say "the family,"
who do you mean exactly? You?

222
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,686
You always have to question everything,
don't you?

223
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:40,899
Maybe it would've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.

224
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,777
"Am I an asshole?
Are my kids a mess?

225
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:48,657
Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?"
I mean, those are questions, right?

226
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:53,578
"Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?"

227
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,710
Do you need some money for the funeral?

228
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:06,758
When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.

229
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,389
It's lovely. You get the high ceilings,
the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.

230
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:15,183
The fridge has got an alarm in it
in case you have...

231
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,562
...eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.

232
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,732
Well, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.

233
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,278
I mean, you move in,
you're upper-class by about Tuesday.

234
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,032
- So you're a cop.
- A state-police detective.

235
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,034
A state-police detective.

236
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,538
And are you a married
state-police detective?

237
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,206
No.

238
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,793
Because this is kind of a--
Sort of a big place and--

239
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,004
I have a co-signer.

240
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:48,884
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend
to have a house guest. That's cool. Good.

241
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,344
- Yeah, it's got--
- Just give me the papers.

242
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,972
Sure.

243
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:59,269
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

244
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,980
- Amen.
- May she rest in peace. Amen.

245
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:05,358
May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed...

246
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,737
...through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

247
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,698
Amen.

248
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,138
So what do I do?

249
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:39,267
There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a regular cop...

250
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,519
...but there's a bonus involved.

251
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,022
Tax-free.

252
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:49,945
We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
You'll be convicted of a crime.

253
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:53,823
We're thinking a guilty plea
to assault and battery would make sense.

254
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,075
Given your nature.

255
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:58,245
You'll do enough jail time
to convince anyone this is no setup.

256
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,956
You'll be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink...

257
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,832
...the whole nine yards.

258
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,337
You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.

259
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,839
We need you, pal.

260
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,884
You've already pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.

261
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:17,013
- Every weekend, sergeant.
- Perfect.

262
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,517
Do it again.

263
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,353
For me.

264
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:00,598
- Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

265
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,685
Well, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on I Street.

266
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:07,188
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.

267
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:10,025
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.

268
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,877
- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.

269
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,963
- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?

270
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,133
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

271
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:39,471
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

272
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,931
I got kicked out, like, four months ago.

273
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,309
Yeah, it was in the papers.

274
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,854
So you know.

275
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,857
And why are we graced
with your presence?

276
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,818
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

277
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:57,113
- Look at the smile.
- My mother had them. My...

278
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,949
My mother's dead.

279
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,496
I'm sorry. Sorry for your troubles.

280
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,248
I was at a funeral myself, man.

281
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,377
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

282
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,839
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

283
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,175
- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.

284
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,678
I got, like--

285
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:24,307
- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.

286
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:27,268
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

287
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,105
In your line of work, if I gave you...

288
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,983
...like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

289
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,487
You know what you--

290
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,989
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

291
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:44,285
- What? What?
- Come on, man.

292
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:48,331
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

293
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,166
What, you want me to say it?

294
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,840
I'm not a cop, all right?

295
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:01,177
- I'm your fucking cousin.
- You're bad.

296
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,181
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

297
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,894
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

298
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:13,606
If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

299
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:17,235
<i>R is for Ricans
P is for pigs</i>

300
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:20,530
Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

301
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:23,658
That's right. You used to be a cop.

302
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:27,245
When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.

303
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,874
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.

304
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,500
This side of Worcester.

305
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,379
- Says who?
- Says him. Says Costello.

306
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,548
God says, as far as you're...

307
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,550
...concerned.

308
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:46,598
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

309
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,142
- Cunt cop.
- No, no, no.

310
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,061
He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.

311
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,731
Well, I knew his father.

312
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,609
- I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
- Jackie was all right.

313
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,278
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

314
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,405
Fucking guineas.

315
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:05,074
- To Jackie.
- Uncle Jackie.

316
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,369
Cranberry juice.

317
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,706
It's a natural diuretic.

318
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:15,084
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

319
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:18,171
What, do you got your period?

320
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,802
- Fucking--!
- Get off!

321
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:31,601
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

322
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,687
Do you know me?

323
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,731
No. No.

324
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:41,110
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit...

325
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,279
...and there's guys you can't.

326
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,448
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

327
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,867
...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

328
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,703
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:

329
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,915
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

330
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,295
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.

331
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:04,384
I fucking know you. I know your family.

332
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:06,511
You make one more drug deal...

333
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:09,514
...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

334
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,976
...and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

335
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,271
I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

336
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:21,150
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

337
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,612
What are you drinking?

338
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,580
A cranberry juice.

339
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,041
What is it, your period?

340
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,339
Get him a cranberry juice.

341
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,889
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.

342
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,727
What? "Oh," fucking what?

343
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:00,857
Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:02,692
Sorry I'm late.

345
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,820
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.

346
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,572
His undercover work is extensive.

347
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,991
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

348
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,368
Okay, my people are out there.

349
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:15,121
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

350
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,707
You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

351
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:20,710
You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.

352
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,838
Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.

353
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:26,257
- Fuck yourself.
- I'm tired from fucking your wife.

354
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,718
- How's your mother?
- Tired from fucking my father.

355
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,720
Good. Today, girls...

356
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,764
...what I have is microprocessors.

357
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:37,268
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors...

358
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:40,021
...from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

359
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:42,440
These are the kind
they put into computers...

360
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:45,443
...that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

361
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,445
...from a couple hundred miles away.

362
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:50,448
These pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece.

363
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:53,201
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

364
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:56,287
...walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

365
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,539
...has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday...

366
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,084
...but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

367
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,419
You know where that dirtball
started his life?

368
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,129
Southie projects.

369
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:07,965
- What was his name, the departed?
- Myles Kennefick.

370
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:11,177
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

371
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,096
- ...which happens to--
- South Boston?

372
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:16,307
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

373
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:19,686
His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

374
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,607
We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.

375
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,192
We're here to nail Costello.

376
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,819
All right, look. We got a guy...

377
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,530
...says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

378
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:33,157
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

379
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,743
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

380
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,330
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the Bureau.

381
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:43,251
Without asking for too many details,
do you have anyone in with Costello now?

382
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,003
Maybe. Maybe not.

383
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,880
Maybe fuck yourself.

384
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,383
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

385
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,468
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

386
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,262
You girls have a good day.

387
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,725
Normally he's a very nice guy.

388
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,810
Don't judge him from this meeting alone.

389
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:07,024
Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.

390
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,943
I knew Myles.

391
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,946
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

392
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,282
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

393
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,452
Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people...

394
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,455
...who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

395
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,457
Allegedly.

396
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,625
Allegedly.

397
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,253
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

398
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,380
But not the robbery. That's not wrong.

399
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:31,632
He did something else wrong?

400
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:36,929
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

401
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,975
I mean, fuck yourself.

402
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:45,062
- Did you get that?
- "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?

403
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:48,691
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Different breed down here, sarge.

404
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:51,652
I need a cup of coffee.

405
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,668
You making a house call?

406
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,296
Have I seen you professionally?

407
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:13,966
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

408
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,804
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty...

409
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,557
...and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.

410
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:25,561
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.

411
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,396
I have an appointment on this floor.

412
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:31,067
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.

413
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:33,319
- I'm one more up.
- Oh, fancy policeman.

414
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:35,571
- Yeah, that's right, fancy.
- Are you a statie?

415
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:38,908
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

416
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,368
Suffolk, nights?

417
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:43,412
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

418
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:47,083
- When's the last time you checked?
- Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

419
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,002
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insulting you.

420
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,839
Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

421
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,800
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.

422
00:27:55,967 --> 00:28:01,097
I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

423
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:03,474
That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.

424
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,686
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.

425
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,354
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

426
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:21,951
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.

427
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:24,954
No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't--

428
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:28,291
All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

429
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,586
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.

430
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,045
All right, have a nice day.

431
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,048
Cut him here.

432
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,301
Bye-bye.

433
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:43,556
Jerk-ass!

434
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:46,392
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.

435
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,104
Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

436
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:53,232
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

437
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,902
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?

438
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,113
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

439
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,489
I'm trying to help you.

440
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:04,118
You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

441
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:07,747
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.

442
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:11,375
See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.

443
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,378
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

444
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,006
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

445
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:20,009
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

446
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,428
These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?

447
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,847
Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

448
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:28,100
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Know what I'm saying?

449
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,810
You fellas come from Providence?

450
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,021
It isn't any of your business, is it, now?

451
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,732
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

452
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:47,745
Hey! You are killing my business, man!

453
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,705
Fuck!

454
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:53,042
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

455
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:00,299
Get out of here. Get out of here!

456
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:10,643
- Now, you also do probation work, right?
- That's right, I see violent offenders.

457
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:14,897
- Oh, bad guys.
- Not necessarily.

458
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:23,531
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.

459
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:25,241
Was your meal okay?

460
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:26,993
Yeah, no, the lobster was good.

461
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,579
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

462
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,087
I'm waiting for you to make your move.

463
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,173
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

464
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,717
I don't even know what it is.

465
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:52,810
So what's it like having people
find themselves...

466
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:54,854
...in your office all day long?

467
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,648
Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?

468
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:01,360
Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?

469
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,945
- No, no, no.
- No?

470
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:05,448
No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.

471
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,993
Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

472
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,578
Yeah, I do.

473
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,914
Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.

474
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,710
Who says I wanna see you again?

475
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:23,340
Don't you?

476
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,969
- You should see your face.
- Don't you?

477
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,596
Course I wanna see you again.

478
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,307
What Freud said about the Irish is...

479
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:35,770
...we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

480
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:39,065
- Yeah, he said that.
- I know he did.

481
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,401
So you're up shit's creek with a client list
full of mick cops.

482
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,570
I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.

483
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,906
Why do you do it, then?

484
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,242
Some people do get better.

485
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,580
Fair enough.

486
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:58,459
Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

487
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,669
Including the criminals?

488
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,089
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

489
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,009
I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.

490
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:11,013
- Wait. You are trouble.
- You don't know the half of it.

491
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,265
I'll arrest you right now.

492
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:16,352
<i>My word against yours.</i>

493
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:19,897
- -Then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.

494
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,692
I say, "Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?"

495
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:27,863
He goes, "Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners," so...

496
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,952
So I say to him,
"Princess Carolina of Monaco..."

497
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:36,997
Schuyler.

498
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:52,972
Do you know who I am?

499
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,726
No.

500
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,068
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

501
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,747
His real name Mr. French?

502
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,335
No.

503
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,924
Come with me.

504
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:37,725
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

505
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:44,690
You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.

506
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:48,444
And this can cause me a lot of problems.

507
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,328
Those guys you tuned up...

508
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,622
...they're connected down Providence.

509
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,583
What they're gonna do...

510
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,337
...is come back with some guys
and kill you.

511
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,548
Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.

512
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,134
Unless I stop them.

513
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,345
Do you want me to stop them?

514
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,725
Is this something I can't do personally?

515
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:25,397
I'm gonna have my associate search you.

516
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,858
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

517
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:30,778
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

518
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,821
Shoes.

519
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:40,955
I knew your father.

520
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:47,253
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

521
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:51,090
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

522
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,927
- Stand.
- He didn't complain.

523
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,846
Yeah, that was his problem.

524
00:34:58,472 --> 00:34:59,848
Who said he had a problem?

525
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,687
I just said he had a fucking problem.

526
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,315
There's a man could've been anything.

527
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,859
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

528
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:14,488
- Fuck.
- I'm saying he worked at the airport.

529
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,532
- He's clean.
- Arm.

530
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:17,950
Yeah, come on.

531
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:19,660
What arm? What fucking arm?

532
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:23,163
Show me your arm. Flip it.

533
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:33,507
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

534
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,552
He's clean.

535
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,014
And if I can slander my own
environment...

536
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,976
...it makes me sad, this regression.

537
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:49,106
Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan...

538
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:53,569
...to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

539
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,697
I just can't know.

540
00:35:57,156 --> 00:36:01,368
I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.

541
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,748
- Are you still a cop?
- No! No!

542
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,251
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

543
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:12,254
I am not a fucking cop!

544
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:18,093
Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerk off fucking cousin?

545
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,430
Yes. Yes, yes.

546
00:36:22,473 --> 00:36:24,600
All right, all right, all right.

547
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,603
You're okay. You'll be all right.

548
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,981
Get your hand taken care of.

549
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:36,612
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

550
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:41,533
As for our problem with Providence...

551
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,162
...let's not cry over spilled guineas.

552
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,667
Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

553
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:58,300
Just kidding. How's your mother?

554
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:00,677
She's on her way out.

555
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,931
We all are. Act accordingly.

556
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,475
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

557
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:08,811
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

558
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:12,106
- What's got you all hot and bothered?
- Get in the car. You'll see.

559
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,567
Do you trust him?

560
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,444
Well, these days...

561
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,738
...who's reliable?

562
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,241
His Uncle Jackie was.

563
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:27,413
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.

564
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:34,044
I'm reliable.

565
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:38,298
Arnold, you're one in a million.

566
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,135
Ten. Ten million.

567
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:45,764
What about your wife, Arnold?

568
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:49,852
Well, I thought she was.

569
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,105
She wasn't.

570
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,276
Well, she got reliable.

571
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:02,406
Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?

572
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:05,617
Another county heard from.

573
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,536
One too many. She got a big mouth.

574
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:09,788
Answer this for me, will you?

575
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:34,188
The principles of detection tell me
these two gentlemen came from Providence.

576
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:38,066
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd
appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.

577
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,986
Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.

578
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,613
Thanks.

579
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:49,119
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
post traumatic stress.

580
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,079
Can I meet you for lunch?

581
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,539
All right, see you then.

582
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,754
Who's the lead detective?

583
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:01,757
Good. He's a lox.

584
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:13,977
Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas
for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...

585
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,896
<i>...and he'll say so.</i>

586
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:20,359
Look in his car, you'll find the gun
that did it, registered, official. Providence.

587
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:22,736
In the trunk or the glove compartment?

588
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,073
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

589
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,997
Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the 6:00 news.

590
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,457
No wonder you get ahead.

591
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:43,715
Have a seat, Bill.

592
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,850
Do you know John Lennon?

593
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:58,021
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.

594
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:02,693
Lennon said:

595
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,153
"I'm an artist.

596
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,700
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it."

597
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:15,330
I tell you, Mr. Costello...

598
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:18,750
... I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

599
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,510
Smart-mouth.

600
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,346
Too bad.

601
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,850
If you'll indulge me...

602
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,769
Now what?

603
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:41,231
Choir practice.

604
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:43,609
Choir practice...

605
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:50,866
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

606
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:55,787
...a man could look at anything...

607
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:57,623
...and make something out of it.

608
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,249
For instance...

609
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,835
... I look at you and I think:

610
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:05,172
What could I use you for?

611
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,176
Get rid of this.

612
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:10,844
French.

613
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:13,472
<i>Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.</i>

614
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,349
Maybe we could work something out.

615
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:19,478
- Good.
- And send this to his wife.

616
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,605
It was nice the way
you asked the guy...

617
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:24,024
...which hand he jerked off with.

618
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,109
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

619
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,946
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.

620
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,832
That was quick.
You think he's dead already?

621
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,710
<i>We have to do it by phone.
I won't do it...</i>

622
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:46,129
...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

623
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,715
- You don't know what this is like.
- <i>Microprocessors.</i>

624
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:51,176
- Micro what?
- <i>Microprocessors.</i>

625
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:54,221
We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years...

626
00:41:54,388 --> 00:41:57,307
...and Costello is selling them
military technology.

627
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,893
Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.

628
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,312
<i>Anybody says anything about
anything like that...</i>

629
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:03,480
...you let us know.

630
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,653
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

631
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,322
Jimmy Pappas.

632
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:14,491
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

633
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:17,953
Jimmy had a rough month.

634
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,455
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...

635
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:23,834
...and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

636
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,836
I believe it's been in the papers.

637
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:29,047
You seem quite happy with that result.

638
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,217
It's a fucking result.

639
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:35,637
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

640
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:38,849
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

641
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:44,104
I think you are a cop, my son.

642
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:47,441
- Where's your license?
- What license?

643
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:50,527
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.

644
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:53,822
But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.

645
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:57,409
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

646
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:00,120
That means you're bringing
undesirable elements...

647
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:02,205
...into Mr. Costello's area.

648
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:10,172
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

649
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:11,339
Hey.

650
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,634
That's Jimmy Bags.

651
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:21,516
- He was rea-- I don't know.
- What the fuck you doing?

652
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:24,352
I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.

653
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,313
There's no profit, I pay him two grand.

654
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,356
Then make more money.
This is America.

655
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:31,860
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

656
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:34,654
- Make more money.
- That's the spirit!

657
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,907
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry about it.

658
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,618
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

659
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:42,913
It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.

660
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,957
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.

661
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:50,378
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim--

662
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:52,255
Hi, Captain.

663
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:53,632
This crazy fuck...

664
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:55,926
- ...knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
- So?

665
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,220
- He was--
- He was reaching for his cigarettes.

666
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:01,223
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasn't for no reason, Frank.

667
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,641
He reached into his coat.

668
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:05,060
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

669
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:07,646
Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

670
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:09,898
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

671
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:12,317
Queenan's compartmentalizing
everything in SIU...

672
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:13,819
...which is the right thing.

673
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,613
I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.

674
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,032
Bottom line...

675
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:21,284
...we think we might have a problem.

676
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:24,329
We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.

677
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,416
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

678
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,877
Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?

679
00:44:31,044 --> 00:44:33,630
No, no, not presently.

680
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:35,257
But I'm working on that.

681
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,551
Here, Bill, this is for you.

682
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:41,847
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

683
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,517
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

684
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:48,603
You wait. We'll call you.

685
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,438
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got that.

686
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:53,525
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- I got that.

687
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:55,318
Good.

688
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,697
Hi, Dad.

689
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:01,658
I got promoted. All right.

690
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,177
Excuse me for one second.

691
00:45:22,304 --> 00:45:24,097
You know...

692
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:27,726
...if your father were alive...

693
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:29,978
...and saw you here sitting with me...

694
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:32,397
...let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

695
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:35,358
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

696
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,777
And he could do it...

697
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:42,240
...which is maybe something
you don't know about William Costigan Sr.

698
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:51,625
- So he never--? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.

699
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:55,295
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

700
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:57,756
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

701
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,467
Your Uncle Jackie...

702
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:05,388
...he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

703
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:10,018
And I think about this.

704
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:18,610
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

705
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:22,322
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

706
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:24,532
School?

707
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:29,245
With all due respect, Mr. Costello...

708
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:31,539
...school is out.

709
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:35,043
Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.

710
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:38,088
Good day, Fathers.

711
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:42,258
- Mr. Costello.
- Good morning, Francis, good morning.

712
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:45,095
You recall our chat?

713
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:47,514
Little boys...

714
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:52,102
...sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...

715
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,105
"I am as God made me."
Was that your rationale?

716
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:02,529
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

717
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:06,741
May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.

718
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:12,205
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

719
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:15,750
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

720
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,753
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

721
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,588
Pay them.

722
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,968
Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.

723
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,936
- What do you got for me?
- Uniform clipped him for suspended license.

724
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:37,439
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation--

725
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,566
More than one. He's one of Costello's.

726
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:42,277
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

727
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:45,113
He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

728
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,949
- Who's the lawyer?
- Didn't know the name. Just a number.

729
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:50,076
Beeper number.

730
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:53,079
- And the guy didn't show up?
- No.

731
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:56,458
- And he beeped him?
- Twice.

732
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,131
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

733
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:05,467
- What?
- Turn the fucking camera off.

734
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:09,054
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.

735
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,306
Whose briefcase is this? All right.

736
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:12,724
- It's off?
- You're good.

737
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:15,560
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

738
00:48:15,852 --> 00:48:18,063
- He can't do that.
- He just did.

739
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:21,691
- You my attorney?
- What do you think?

740
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:24,861
Have you made statements
or phone calls...

741
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:26,696
... I need to be made aware of?

742
00:48:28,782 --> 00:48:31,409
I beeped you.

743
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,704
The card they gave me. That's it.

744
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:38,291
- That's it?
- That's it.

745
00:48:41,503 --> 00:48:42,921
You need to call your mother...

746
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:45,381
...tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

747
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:53,640
Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.

748
00:48:56,893 --> 00:49:00,230
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

749
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,025
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

750
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,529
So make the call.

751
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,662
Lookit, fuck stick,
you don't gotta trust me...

752
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:19,707
...just listen to what I'm saying to you.

753
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:41,020
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

754
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,106
<i>Sorry, yeah, I got held up.</i>

755
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:47,569
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

756
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:51,865
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

757
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:53,783
Bye.

758
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:57,203
Everybody out. Move.

759
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:15,555
Thank you.

760
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:18,266
So who are you?

761
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:21,895
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

762
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,730
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

763
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:27,233
All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.

764
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,111
I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there...

765
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:32,363
...and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

766
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,909
- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.

767
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:48,880
The light's nice here in the morning.

768
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:56,471
So do you wanna talk about last night?

769
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:06,648
You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make
too big a deal out of it.

770
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:14,155
It's actually quite common.

771
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:15,949
I gotta go to work.

772
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:27,001
Do you lie?

773
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:30,880
Why? Do you?

774
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:32,757
No, I'm asking if you lie.

775
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:36,219
Honesty is not synonymous with truth.

776
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:38,513
Yeah, you lie.

777
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,847
You lie.

778
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,684
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally...

779
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,894
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?

780
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:50,525
Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.

781
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:55,947
So you had a parent who was a drunk.

782
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:01,536
Did you?

783
00:52:01,703 --> 00:52:03,371
No.

784
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:07,417
Let's keep it with you.

785
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:10,211
Talk about how you feel.

786
00:52:12,005 --> 00:52:14,299
<i>How I feel.</i>

787
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,384
<i>How I feel.</i>

788
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:38,948
- Fuck.
- Brian, stop it.

789
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:47,165
No. Please. No.

790
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:49,125
Ain't gonna hurt you.

791
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:53,963
<i>You sit there...</i>

792
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,382
...with a mass murderer.

793
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:58,343
A mass murderer.

794
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:01,721
Your heart rate is jacked.

795
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:04,515
And your hand...

796
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:07,602
...steady.

797
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:14,275
That's one thing I figured out about myself
in prison. My hand...

798
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:16,652
...does not shake.

799
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:18,946
Ever.

800
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:29,957
Wake the fuck up.

801
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:34,420
There was a cop leaving when I came in.

802
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:36,798
How did you know he was a cop?

803
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:41,761
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

804
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:44,097
- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.

805
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:47,475
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

806
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:50,853
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

807
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,398
Should I?

808
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:57,026
So do they all come in here...

809
00:53:57,193 --> 00:53:59,445
...and cry, your cops?

810
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:02,907
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

811
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:06,285
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons--

812
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:08,579
Use their weapons?

813
00:54:09,122 --> 00:54:10,581
Let me tell you something.

814
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:13,042
They signed up to use their weapons.

815
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:15,670
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

816
00:54:15,837 --> 00:54:18,756
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

817
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:21,968
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

818
00:54:22,135 --> 00:54:23,928
Except for a cop on TV.

819
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:33,271
<i>I looked at your file.</i>

820
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:36,983
I see that you have a record of assault.

821
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,693
Yeah.

822
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,987
<i>So what was it like for you in jail?</i>

823
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:45,616
What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

824
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,618
Did something happen to you?

825
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:49,412
No.

826
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:56,085
- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.
- Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

827
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:59,672
...and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

828
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,717
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.

829
00:55:02,884 --> 00:55:05,261
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.

830
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:07,054
It's been a year. I've had enough!

831
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:10,349
Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?

832
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:13,644
- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.

833
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:16,189
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

834
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:19,901
We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

835
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,111
How about we just erase your file, huh?

836
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:24,071
How about we erase your file...

837
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,657
...and you're just
another soldier for Costello...

838
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:30,077
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?

839
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:33,831
How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!

840
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:36,125
- That was a joke. Come on.
- That wasn't a joke.

841
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:38,544
You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

842
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:44,091
- ...you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

843
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:48,137
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

844
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:51,015
For chrissake, be smart.

845
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:54,477
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

846
00:55:54,644 --> 00:55:56,229
Come on, get in the car.

847
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,773
Both of you, get in the car.

848
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,735
When are you gonna take Costello?

849
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:05,029
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

850
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:08,491
...of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?

851
00:56:08,658 --> 00:56:10,368
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

852
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:13,454
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

853
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:17,333
What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

854
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,210
- That what you want?
- That'd stick.

855
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:21,128
Will you shut up?

856
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,673
We are building a case and it takes time.

857
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,091
You know that.

858
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,261
Something's wrong.

859
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,846
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

860
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:34,475
Yeah, maybe.

861
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:37,770
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?

862
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:39,939
No bullshit.

863
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:43,651
I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.

864
00:56:46,529 --> 00:56:48,072
You serious?

865
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:50,032
I'm afraid so.

866
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:56,622
Have you heard anything like that?

867
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,457
Jesus Christ.

868
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:02,503
Hang tight for me, kid.

869
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,463
Just a little while longer.

870
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,924
We are this close:

871
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:10,720
All right?

872
00:57:12,013 --> 00:57:13,764
<i>What do you expect coming in here?</i>

873
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,726
- I have to come here.
- I know you have to come here.

874
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:19,854
But now that you're here...

875
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,897
...what do you want?

876
00:57:22,315 --> 00:57:23,733
You want the truth?

877
00:57:26,027 --> 00:57:27,612
Valium.

878
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:31,073
If you lied, you would have an easier time
getting what you wanted.

879
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,660
- What's that say about what you do?
- We should have a few more meetings...

880
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:38,539
- ...before we even talk about prescriptions.
- Look, I'm having panic attacks.

881
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:43,044
Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.

882
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,795
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

883
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,505
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

884
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:49,383
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

885
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,385
...and you're gonna close my file?

886
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:55,181
- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I--
- I thought I was supposed to tell...

887
00:57:55,348 --> 00:57:57,933
- ...the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.

888
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:02,229
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...

889
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,397
...and what do you do?

890
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:07,652
What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?

891
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:10,571
You're fucking ridiculous.

892
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:20,122
Two pills?

893
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,167
Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch...

894
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:25,503
...and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?

895
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,673
- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit?
- You can leave!

896
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,258
What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.

897
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:35,846
And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

898
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:38,849
<i>Fuck.</i>

899
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:50,236
Why is the last patient of the day
always the hardest one?

900
00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:52,196
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

901
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:54,281
- It's not supernatural.
- Listen.

902
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:59,537
Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody
that you have to see or they put you in jail.

903
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:02,581
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.

904
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,168
What's this?

905
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:09,463
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 Lorazepam.

906
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:11,215
Yeah?

907
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:13,008
Is it enough to commit suicide?

908
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,095
Maybe it is. All right? Okay?

909
00:59:16,262 --> 00:59:18,431
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

910
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:22,309
Because according to my standards,
you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.

911
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:26,147
You know, and too damn bad
if you don't like my initial clinical reaction.

912
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,565
Thank you.

913
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:31,360
I'm transferring you to another counselor.

914
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:33,529
- Good.
- Okay.

915
00:59:35,156 --> 00:59:37,283
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

916
00:59:44,123 --> 00:59:47,001
Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

917
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:48,502
Come on in.

918
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:53,632
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

919
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,384
Yes, those.

920
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:59,305
I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.

921
00:59:59,472 --> 01:00:02,016
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building...

922
01:00:02,183 --> 01:00:04,435
...that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.

923
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:08,189
I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.

924
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,232
- You guys know anything about this?
- No.

925
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:13,486
Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.

926
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,029
Our unit will not take action.

927
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:19,533
I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

928
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,869
...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?

929
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:26,040
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

930
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:29,794
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

931
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,505
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

932
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:35,424
All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

933
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:37,927
Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.

934
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,137
This lead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.

935
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:44,892
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.

936
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,107
- Hi, Dad?
- Yes.

937
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,443
<i>Yeah, something big came up at work.</i>

938
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:57,112
- I'm not gonna be home for supper.
- <i>Too bad.</i>

939
01:00:57,947 --> 01:00:59,865
Your mother worked all goddamn day.

940
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:03,536
We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

941
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,871
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.

942
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:12,169
So we'll just-- I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.

943
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,839
Your mother will be proud.

944
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,882
All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

945
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,677
The readiness is all.

946
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:24,306
You know the players. Call the game.

947
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,268
Thank you.

948
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:30,437
- You ready?
- Is your highness...

949
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,774
...gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

950
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:36,652
What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?

951
01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:39,780
A confessional seal, these days...

952
01:01:39,947 --> 01:01:41,574
... I'm not so sure.

953
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:49,290
He'll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.

954
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:51,959
All cell-phone signals
are under surveillance...

955
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:54,879
...through the courtesy of
our federal friends over there.

956
01:01:57,381 --> 01:02:01,176
Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

957
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:05,556
Keep an eye on this one.

958
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:35,556
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

959
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:43,010
All right, here we go.

960
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,973
There's Costello. Mr. French.

961
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:49,975
There's Fitzy, Delahunt...

962
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:52,186
...and the new guy, Billy Costigan.

963
01:02:58,734 --> 01:03:01,195
Time is 10:46.

964
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,366
All right, turn off your cell phones.

965
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:08,535
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

966
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:34,311
- We have a blind spot.
- Why do we have a blind spot?

967
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,397
We had two hours' notice. Two hours.

968
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:39,274
- Fuck you think this is, NASA?
- It never crossed my mind.

969
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:42,528
- Have you got a camera in the back?
- What back?

970
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:51,912
- How you going, Robert?
- Good, Mr. Costello.

971
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:55,916
I wanna tell you, at least two
of these gents have machine guns.

972
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:12,182
He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitless.

973
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:15,477
Government man. Scared.

974
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:19,606
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

975
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:23,152
...to come to a business transaction...

976
01:04:23,444 --> 01:04:25,237
...with automatic weapons.

977
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:35,039
For his own good, tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids...

978
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,833
...none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

979
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,295
Because here, in this country...

980
01:04:41,754 --> 01:04:44,298
...it don't add inches to your dick.

981
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:46,633
You get a life sentence for it.

982
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:07,571
If we had some Homeland Security money
like some douche bags I could mention...

983
01:05:07,738 --> 01:05:09,907
- Any calls?
- They turned off their cell phones.

984
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:12,618
Search randomly for calls
made from the area.

985
01:05:12,785 --> 01:05:15,162
Eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area.

986
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:16,830
Then narrow the area.

987
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:19,541
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

988
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:21,627
Why did they turn their phones off?

989
01:05:21,794 --> 01:05:24,755
- Wait. There's still one phone up.
- Where?

990
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:38,811
The buyers are there.

991
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:45,859
You know, direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages.

992
01:05:46,026 --> 01:05:47,528
Not to my guy.

993
01:05:48,028 --> 01:05:50,781
This is unbelievable.
Who put the cameras in this place?

994
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:52,407
Oh, who the fuck are you?

995
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:56,078
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

996
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:02,543
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

997
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:07,005
...they'd better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars.

998
01:06:12,136 --> 01:06:15,556
What we generally do, in this country...

999
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,891
...is one guy...

1000
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,227
...brings the items...

1001
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:22,729
...and the other guy...

1002
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:24,314
...pays him.

1003
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:30,112
No "tickee"...

1004
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,948
...no laundry.

1005
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:43,500
Go ahead, Fitz.

1006
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,603
Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?

1007
01:07:04,313 --> 01:07:06,398
Please tell me those cars aren't empty.

1008
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:11,612
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me
that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!

1009
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,119
They didn't figure we had a navy.

1010
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,211
Did you put a camera in the back?

1011
01:07:28,921 --> 01:07:31,131
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

1012
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:35,719
You stupid fucking hard-on!

1013
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:38,096
You fucked this whole thing up!

1014
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:41,516
What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!

1015
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:44,978
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!

1016
01:07:45,354 --> 01:07:47,481
Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

1017
01:07:47,648 --> 01:07:49,900
<i>I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on.</i>

1018
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:53,070
Queenan had a funeral to go to.
This is my shift. Calm down.

1019
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:55,280
Why shouldn't I get
on a fucking plane, huh?

1020
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:58,075
Meet up? You actually want me dead?

1021
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:01,078
Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, all right?

1022
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:02,704
- <i>Where's Queenan?</i>
- He's not here.

1023
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:05,958
They knew you had cameras in the building.
They knew everything.

1024
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:09,294
There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.

1025
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:13,507
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?

1026
01:08:13,674 --> 01:08:17,177
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have
a sealed wiretap warrant...

1027
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:21,848
...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell
anyone in our division, but tell SIU.

1028
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,476
Flush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.

1029
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:26,520
That's what we do first. Narrow it down.

1030
01:08:26,687 --> 01:08:29,731
- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
- <i>He's not here.</i>

1031
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:33,026
You wanna meet up
or you got something real, call me back.

1032
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:42,202
- -Changing your life radically.

1033
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:44,746
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

1034
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:46,957
- Right?
- Yeah.

1035
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:52,212
How long you been with this guy?

1036
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,716
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

1037
01:08:58,385 --> 01:09:01,596
- Four months. Almost four months.
- Four months.

1038
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,307
Do you love him?

1039
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,936
It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.

1040
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:09,479
It's very serious.

1041
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:13,358
Is he a headcase like me?
I'm just curious.

1042
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:15,986
No more than I am.

1043
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,613
I know that it's a serious relationship.

1044
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:21,491
I know there are ups and downs. Right?

1045
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,994
People have doubts and problems.

1046
01:09:24,453 --> 01:09:28,123
Well, not problems, but doubts.

1047
01:09:30,876 --> 01:09:34,629
What would you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?

1048
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:43,013
I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.

1049
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:46,725
You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?

1050
01:09:46,892 --> 01:09:48,977
Right? We talked about that.

1051
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,485
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1052
01:09:57,069 --> 01:09:59,112
Want a French doughnut?

1053
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:01,073
Yeah.

1054
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:04,117
- Hey, can I look it?
- Yeah.

1055
01:10:04,493 --> 01:10:05,744
Sure.

1056
01:10:08,372 --> 01:10:10,999
- All right, we're not having this out.
- What?

1057
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:13,335
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

1058
01:10:13,794 --> 01:10:15,295
Look, I respect who you are...

1059
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:17,631
...just, you know, not in the living room.

1060
01:10:17,798 --> 01:10:19,383
We might have company.

1061
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:21,551
- Company?
- Yeah, company.

1062
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:25,680
- Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
- Why not? You do.

1063
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:29,559
No, what you do. The degrees and all,
everything you got. You're hot shit.

1064
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:30,936
Yeah?

1065
01:10:31,103 --> 01:10:34,022
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counselor?

1066
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:37,734
Because I believe in public service.

1067
01:10:39,486 --> 01:10:42,864
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?

1068
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:46,118
- No, don't start with me. Don't--
- Hey.

1069
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:49,413
Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!

1070
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,289
- The phone.
- Forget the phone.

1071
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:52,916
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

1072
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:55,335
This is your first phone call
in the new house.

1073
01:10:55,502 --> 01:10:57,671
You live here now. You're a resident.

1074
01:10:59,673 --> 01:11:01,383
Mayor Sullivan's office.

1075
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:04,344
<i>Put Colin on the phone right now.</i>

1076
01:11:04,845 --> 01:11:06,138
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1077
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:07,848
What?

1078
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:10,434
I think it's a guy with--

1079
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,604
- It's like a cancer guy.
- Hello.

1080
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:17,941
What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?

1081
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:21,153
Something for work.

1082
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:25,198
Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get--

1083
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:27,659
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

1084
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:30,454
Remember I told you that we were--
She was gonna move in?

1085
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,289
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- She moved in.

1086
01:11:32,456 --> 01:11:36,209
- You better get organized, quick.
- Hey, last time I checked, I tipped you off...

1087
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,211
...and you're not in jail.

1088
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:41,798
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

1089
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:45,719
Do you like Little Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?

1090
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:49,764
Yes. Yes, I do.

1091
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:51,558
So earn it.

1092
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:54,519
I'm getting the feeling...

1093
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:56,563
...we got a cop in my crew.

1094
01:11:56,897 --> 01:11:59,274
Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeling too.

1095
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:02,235
He's one of yours. Inside.

1096
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:03,528
<i>Have you seen anything?</i>

1097
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:07,282
I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1098
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:08,658
- Doing my best.
- <i>Your best?</i>

1099
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:11,703
What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?

1100
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:13,413
Look, Frank, if you don't relax--

1101
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:17,459
If you don't relax, I can't relax. All right?
Now, what I need you to do...

1102
01:12:17,626 --> 01:12:21,087
<i>...get me information on the people
with you last night. Your crew.</i>

1103
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:23,215
Get me social-security numbers, get me--

1104
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:27,552
Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?

1105
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:30,972
All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
All right. I'm sorry.

1106
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:34,351
If you could, please.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...

1107
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:39,064
...just all the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.

1108
01:12:39,231 --> 01:12:41,024
<i>If you can get me that information...</i>

1109
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:43,610
... I can-- We're gonna handle it.
I can handle it.

1110
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:45,987
Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.

1111
01:12:46,154 --> 01:12:47,906
<i>I'll get you the records and whatnot.</i>

1112
01:12:48,073 --> 01:12:51,243
<i>But listen to me, son.
Don't disappoint me on this...</i>

1113
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:54,704
...or some other guy will be putting
their fat cock...

1114
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:57,374
...up Little Miss Freud's ass.

1115
01:13:04,172 --> 01:13:06,550
How are you, Francis?

1116
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:15,225
- My mother called me Francis.
- I know she did.

1117
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:18,186
And your father called you the tumor.

1118
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:21,022
And what did your father
call you, Charlie?

1119
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:25,193
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasn't around.

1120
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,487
You have a boss
that has a laryngectomy?

1121
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:31,575
No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.

1122
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,743
You're lying to me.

1123
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:36,871
Not exactly.

1124
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:40,500
What did you do with
the real microprocessors, Frank?

1125
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:43,670
Microprocessors.

1126
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:45,380
Oh, yeah.

1127
01:13:45,547 --> 01:13:48,717
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

1128
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:52,220
...at the border carrying some light sockets
or something.

1129
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,766
I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.

1130
01:13:57,434 --> 01:14:00,103
Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?

1131
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:04,232
There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.

1132
01:14:04,608 --> 01:14:09,362
And I cannot allow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation...

1133
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:11,573
...or your life.

1134
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:15,535
No, really, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.

1135
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:18,079
Okay, then just say that.

1136
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:21,374
All right, I will.

1137
01:14:22,042 --> 01:14:24,210
Oh, that's the movers.

1138
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:26,129
Yeah, you still wanna stay?

1139
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,215
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1140
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:33,053
Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.

1141
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:35,472
I'm gonna get you.

1142
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:39,517
If you could've, you would've.

1143
01:14:39,768 --> 01:14:43,355
But I guess you like to go
at your own pace.

1144
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:47,901
Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.

1145
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:56,910
<i>Frankie.</i>

1146
01:14:57,869 --> 01:14:59,329
<i>Frankie!</i>

1147
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:02,290
<i>Your mother forgives me.</i>

1148
01:15:07,087 --> 01:15:08,922
You take off an armored car at the mall.

1149
01:15:09,089 --> 01:15:11,132
What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?

1150
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:14,135
- Fucking now I do!
- What the fuck do you do?

1151
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:18,723
I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.

1152
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:21,393
FBI? What the fuck
you talking about, FBI?

1153
01:15:24,813 --> 01:15:26,356
My God, is that French out there?

1154
01:15:26,523 --> 01:15:28,692
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?

1155
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,777
Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.

1156
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,947
Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor...

1157
01:15:34,114 --> 01:15:37,909
...very limited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, all right?

1158
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,328
- Just tell me what you fucking said.
- Forget it.

1159
01:15:40,495 --> 01:15:44,416
I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.

1160
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,251
Fuck!

1161
01:15:46,418 --> 01:15:49,713
Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?

1162
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:53,842
Why do you think he never gets busted?
Costello's a protected FBI informant.

1163
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:56,511
He'll trade you out.

1164
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:59,597
I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.

1165
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:02,851
I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!

1166
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:06,020
It fucking hurts!

1167
01:16:13,528 --> 01:16:15,780
Hey. It's me.

1168
01:16:15,947 --> 01:16:18,283
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

1169
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:23,246
Costello's giving people up to the FBI.

1170
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:27,709
- The FBI?
- He is giving information to the FBI.

1171
01:16:27,876 --> 01:16:30,253
He's a protected fucking informant.

1172
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:34,674
I mean, aren't they always trying to make it
a federal case and it never gets made?

1173
01:16:35,842 --> 01:16:38,470
Go around the back.
I'll open the door. Go on.

1174
01:16:42,182 --> 01:16:45,518
- Here's some ice water.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

1175
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:52,317
That's my son, Patrick.

1176
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:55,737
- Goes to Notre Dame.
- Oh, yeah?

1177
01:16:55,904 --> 01:16:59,282
My wife's asleep but she left some
supper out. You want something to eat?

1178
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:00,950
No. No, thanks.

1179
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:04,704
Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.

1180
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:06,539
Come on.

1181
01:17:42,075 --> 01:17:43,284
You want some coke?

1182
01:17:48,832 --> 01:17:50,750
There it is.

1183
01:17:51,376 --> 01:17:53,878
Don't move till you're numb.

1184
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:10,812
Come on. Get inside.

1185
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:14,983
Boss wants your real name...

1186
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:18,695
...your social and license number,
your bank account numbers.

1187
01:18:18,862 --> 01:18:20,947
I don't have a bank account.

1188
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:24,325
- I'm a cash business myself.
- What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

1189
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:28,454
Just fill the fucking paper in. Your real name
and all your account numbers.

1190
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:30,456
Then we wait here.

1191
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:34,002
- You're shitting me.
- No, I ain't.

1192
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:47,515
Put the forms in there.

1193
01:18:51,019 --> 01:18:53,396
I don't know if this
is how you spell "citizens."

1194
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:56,232
But fuck it, you know?

1195
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:59,193
No, no, no. Come here.

1196
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:06,159
What, are you fucking retarded
or something?

1197
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:08,494
That ain't fucking right.

1198
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:09,954
Are you kidding me?

1199
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:11,414
Look at this. Look.

1200
01:19:12,165 --> 01:19:14,167
"Citizens." Look.

1201
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,835
Billy, he said to stay here.

1202
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,755
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.

1203
01:19:18,922 --> 01:19:20,298
Where the fuck are you going?

1204
01:19:20,465 --> 01:19:24,636
I'm not staying, all right?
You can tell him I said that.

1205
01:19:43,947 --> 01:19:45,990
- Hey.
- Hi.

1206
01:19:48,034 --> 01:19:50,078
- It's pouring out there.
- Yeah.

1207
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:58,878
Look...

1208
01:19:59,045 --> 01:20:00,797
- ...if this is inappropriate, I--
- No.

1209
01:20:00,964 --> 01:20:03,591
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

1210
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:08,388
So you moving out or you moving in?

1211
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,349
I've still got
three weeks left on the lease.

1212
01:20:20,525 --> 01:20:22,193
That's me.

1213
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:26,739
Yeah, I know.

1214
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:36,541
- Hedging your bets?
- No. No.

1215
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,292
You have to choose.

1216
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:41,129
- You have to make a--
- A decision.

1217
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:44,716
A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.

1218
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:47,135
- You have to--
- Move in with your boyfriend?

1219
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:49,929
Yes. Otherwise it's...

1220
01:20:50,847 --> 01:20:53,766
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

1221
01:21:04,569 --> 01:21:09,782
I have to say your vulnerability
is really freaking me out right now.

1222
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:16,664
Is it real?

1223
01:21:20,585 --> 01:21:22,295
I think so.

1224
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:30,094
You don't have any cats.

1225
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:31,804
No.

1226
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,557
I like that.

1227
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:48,047
I don't get it.

1228
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:53,594
We are all convinced
that Costello has at least...

1229
01:22:53,761 --> 01:22:56,931
...one mole inside
the Special Investigations Unit.

1230
01:22:57,098 --> 01:23:01,352
You will investigate everybody
and anybody.

1231
01:23:01,519 --> 01:23:05,690
Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.

1232
01:23:05,857 --> 01:23:09,110
We looked at all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record.

1233
01:23:09,277 --> 01:23:12,613
Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.

1234
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:14,240
I have an immaculate record.

1235
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:17,410
How is your wedding coming along?

1236
01:23:17,577 --> 01:23:19,996
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

1237
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:22,915
- That's outstanding.
- Yeah.

1238
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:25,251
Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.

1239
01:23:25,418 --> 01:23:28,296
Lets people know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stable.

1240
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:31,132
People see the ring, think at least
someone can stand him.

1241
01:23:31,299 --> 01:23:35,386
Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.

1242
01:23:36,179 --> 01:23:38,598
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

1243
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:41,767
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you.

1244
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:33,527
Be dirty, be dirty.

1245
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:37,907
Yeah...

1246
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,831
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

1247
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:49,752
- See anything you like, Col?
- I almost fucking shot you.

1248
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:52,838
- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you?
- Sit down.

1249
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:57,051
I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.

1250
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:59,136
You're not cracking up, are you?

1251
01:25:00,054 --> 01:25:02,640
- I don't crack up.
- Pick a place like this...

1252
01:25:02,807 --> 01:25:04,684
...where any cop could see you. Jesus.

1253
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:08,020
If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?

1254
01:25:08,646 --> 01:25:10,314
I own the place.

1255
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:15,194
Why am I not fucking surprised?

1256
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:20,283
- All right, look it, I gotta tell you--
- You're getting reassigned. I know.

1257
01:25:20,992 --> 01:25:22,451
How the fuck do you know that?

1258
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,912
- Where'd they put you?
- Hey, Frank.

1259
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:28,666
I gotta find myself.

1260
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:30,418
You're telling me, sonny boy.

1261
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:33,421
I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.

1262
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:37,800
With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself...

1263
01:25:37,967 --> 01:25:40,052
... I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.

1264
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:44,640
I know, but, Frank, look it.
For me, you gotta lay low.

1265
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:46,642
- Right now.
- Collie...

1266
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:49,228
...laying low is not what I do.

1267
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:52,064
All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.

1268
01:25:52,231 --> 01:25:54,442
What good am I to you
if you don't listen to me?

1269
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:56,235
What good am I if you don't listen?

1270
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:04,160
Queenan is compartmentalizing.
He's splitting everything up.

1271
01:26:04,327 --> 01:26:05,995
He's fucking smart. You know this.

1272
01:26:06,162 --> 01:26:09,749
I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.

1273
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:14,462
Okay.

1274
01:26:18,299 --> 01:26:21,177
But Colin,
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1275
01:26:21,344 --> 01:26:25,389
...that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1276
01:26:25,556 --> 01:26:29,769
...most likely,
it won't be me who suffers for it.

1277
01:26:30,728 --> 01:26:33,230
Now, why would you have to
remind me of that?

1278
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:38,569
Would I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking already know that?

1279
01:26:38,736 --> 01:26:41,155
Frank, you gotta trust me.

1280
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:44,075
All right? Just trust me, Frank.

1281
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:49,872
Hey, it fucking involves lying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1282
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:51,707
Right?

1283
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:54,502
Maybe because
it's always been so easy...

1284
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:59,298
...for me to get cunt that I never understood
jerking off in a theater.

1285
01:27:05,805 --> 01:27:07,390
Christ.

1286
01:27:09,517 --> 01:27:12,061
Who knows what's easy?

1287
01:27:12,812 --> 01:27:17,483
Colin, I know you'll take care
of business.

1288
01:28:02,236 --> 01:28:03,696
Shit!

1289
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:44,069
Fuck.

1290
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:03,691
Hey, how you doing?

1291
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:06,026
Hi, Darlene, hi.

1292
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:12,074
- That's it for me.
- Yeah, see you.

1293
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:13,951
Have a good one.

1294
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:39,226
I smell a rat.

1295
01:30:45,858 --> 01:30:47,109
Jesus Christ.

1296
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:49,778
You got a girlfriend?

1297
01:30:51,697 --> 01:30:53,365
No.

1298
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:55,618
No, no. Why, what does that matter?

1299
01:30:57,369 --> 01:30:58,704
It depends.

1300
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:04,543
I'm sure by now you know...

1301
01:31:05,169 --> 01:31:08,297
... I got an informer in my outfit.

1302
01:31:09,256 --> 01:31:10,507
Cop.

1303
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:15,929
Staties, Boston Police Department,
I'm not sure.

1304
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:18,265
Jesus Christ.

1305
01:31:19,892 --> 01:31:22,519
Are you sure it's not the FBI?

1306
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:26,857
It ain't the FBI.

1307
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,818
Ex-wife.

1308
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:33,197
Old girlfriend.

1309
01:31:34,573 --> 01:31:36,492
Or stupid.

1310
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:41,038
That is what brings you down
in this business.

1311
01:31:41,205 --> 01:31:42,915
Stupid, huh?

1312
01:31:43,582 --> 01:31:45,459
Well, I guess that leaves me out.

1313
01:31:49,713 --> 01:31:55,094
You know, past days, situation like this,
I kill everybody.

1314
01:31:55,803 --> 01:31:58,263
Everybody who works for me.

1315
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:01,016
Right. You know, Frank...

1316
01:32:01,183 --> 01:32:03,268
... I look around at your other guys...

1317
01:32:04,103 --> 01:32:07,022
I mean, they're all murderers, right?
Right?

1318
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:10,859
And I think, "Could I do murder?"

1319
01:32:12,945 --> 01:32:16,115
And all I can answer myself is:

1320
01:32:17,616 --> 01:32:19,618
"What's the difference?"

1321
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:22,705
Give them up to the Almighty.

1322
01:32:23,247 --> 01:32:25,958
You see, that's my point, you know?

1323
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:31,213
You accuse me once, I put up with it.

1324
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:32,715
You accuse me twice...

1325
01:32:34,341 --> 01:32:36,260
... I quit.

1326
01:32:36,844 --> 01:32:41,265
You pressure me to fear for my life and
I will put a fucking bullet in your head...

1327
01:32:41,432 --> 01:32:44,351
...as if you were anybody else. Okay?

1328
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:59,158
You got something
you wanna ask me?

1329
01:33:01,326 --> 01:33:05,330
Look, you're 70 years old, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?

1330
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:08,500
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

1331
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:11,003
- One of your guys is gonna pop you.
- Yeah, yeah.

1332
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:13,505
As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?

1333
01:33:13,672 --> 01:33:17,259
You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they will catch you.

1334
01:33:17,426 --> 01:33:19,553
I haven't needed the money...

1335
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:23,849
...since I took Archie's milk money
in the third grade.

1336
01:33:24,016 --> 01:33:27,311
Tell you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.

1337
01:33:28,771 --> 01:33:30,606
But I like it.

1338
01:33:31,774 --> 01:33:34,526
Point I'm making here is, Bill...

1339
01:33:34,693 --> 01:33:37,529
... I got this rat...

1340
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:42,034
...this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat...

1341
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:44,578
...and it brings up questions.

1342
01:33:44,745 --> 01:33:48,749
You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.

1343
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,835
Girlfriend...

1344
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:58,550
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

1345
01:33:59,301 --> 01:34:01,970
Social-security numbers.

1346
01:34:02,137 --> 01:34:05,057
- Yeah.
- Everybody's fucking numbers.

1347
01:34:05,224 --> 01:34:08,060
Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?

1348
01:34:08,227 --> 01:34:10,604
Because I'll give you
the fucking answer, all right?

1349
01:34:10,771 --> 01:34:12,731
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

1350
01:34:12,898 --> 01:34:16,193
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

1351
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:17,736
I'm not the fucking rat.

1352
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:21,198
Start with you agree there is a rat.

1353
01:34:22,074 --> 01:34:23,617
You said there is one, all right?

1354
01:34:23,784 --> 01:34:27,329
I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.

1355
01:34:27,496 --> 01:34:29,581
Sure. Sure, Will.

1356
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:34,253
You, William. What would you do?

1357
01:34:39,258 --> 01:34:40,801
Frank, how many of these guys...

1358
01:34:40,968 --> 01:34:43,387
...have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled?

1359
01:34:43,554 --> 01:34:46,515
Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.

1360
01:34:46,682 --> 01:34:49,643
It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.

1361
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:53,355
The question is,
and this is the only question...

1362
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:58,694
...who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?

1363
01:34:59,611 --> 01:35:02,781
The only one
who could do what I do is me.

1364
01:35:04,074 --> 01:35:07,494
Lot of people had to die
for me to be me.

1365
01:35:09,997 --> 01:35:12,040
You wanna be me?

1366
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:18,422
I probably could be you. Yeah.

1367
01:35:18,589 --> 01:35:20,090
Yeah, I know that much.

1368
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:24,469
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

1369
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:26,889
I don't wanna be you.

1370
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:32,811
"Heavy lies the crown" sort of thing.

1371
01:35:33,312 --> 01:35:34,771
Yeah.

1372
01:35:35,606 --> 01:35:38,066
- Francis.
- I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm--

1373
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:42,321
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.
- All right. Good night.

1374
01:35:44,823 --> 01:35:47,701
You know what I like about restaurants?

1375
01:35:47,868 --> 01:35:49,745
The fucking food? I don't know. What?

1376
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:54,166
You learn a lot watching things eat.

1377
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:58,712
There's a boat coming up Gloucester.

1378
01:35:59,671 --> 01:36:02,507
French will give you all the details.
Don't forget.

1379
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:05,844
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

1380
01:36:10,015 --> 01:36:15,270
In the future, I tell you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?

1381
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:18,357
I got it. Okay?

1382
01:36:20,734 --> 01:36:22,319
Excuse me...

1383
01:36:22,486 --> 01:36:25,155
- ... French, I forgot my...
- Okay, Francis.

1384
01:36:25,322 --> 01:36:26,323
...cigarette.

1385
01:36:29,284 --> 01:36:31,620
Eat something.

1386
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:41,254
Problem?

1387
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:44,967
Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks
like you, okay? I don't like them.

1388
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:47,469
The day you wouldn't take a promotion,
let me know.

1389
01:36:47,636 --> 01:36:49,763
If you'd taken care of this
I wouldn't be here.

1390
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:53,475
- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
- I need the identity of your undercovers.

1391
01:36:53,642 --> 01:36:57,229
Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately,
there's no promotion involved for you.

1392
01:36:57,396 --> 01:36:58,397
Fucking prick.

1393
01:36:58,772 --> 01:37:01,775
- Hi, captain.
- Look who's here. The prom queen.

1394
01:37:01,942 --> 01:37:04,277
- They are not happy with me.
- What do you expect?

1395
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:07,948
Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find Costello's rat.

1396
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:11,326
They want to find the leak
as much as you do.

1397
01:37:11,785 --> 01:37:15,872
Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who Costello's rat is.

1398
01:37:17,582 --> 01:37:20,502
- But he lost him in the streets.
- Really?

1399
01:37:22,838 --> 01:37:26,091
- Well, did he get a look at the guy?
- No.

1400
01:37:26,258 --> 01:37:29,052
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.

1401
01:37:29,219 --> 01:37:30,429
No.

1402
01:37:32,931 --> 01:37:35,809
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.

1403
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:40,272
Costello can't do much business without
coordinating with his source...

1404
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:42,315
...who is here in SIU.

1405
01:37:44,109 --> 01:37:46,445
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1406
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:56,747
<i>You're gonna be looking at my people...</i>

1407
01:37:56,955 --> 01:38:01,168
<i>...going through their bank statements,
their phone calls and medical records.</i>

1408
01:38:01,334 --> 01:38:06,131
<i>Don't be surprised if they don't buy you
a beer or invite you into their homes.</i>

1409
01:38:07,591 --> 01:38:09,593
<i>Let me get you a coffee.</i>

1410
01:38:12,512 --> 01:38:15,766
<i>If I wasn't
with the Massachusetts State Police...</i>

1411
01:38:16,391 --> 01:38:19,311
...if I did it full-time, law school...

1412
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:22,105
... I'd be through it in a year.

1413
01:38:23,398 --> 01:38:25,317
If I wasn't a trooper.

1414
01:38:29,613 --> 01:38:32,449
But another city. I was thinking that.

1415
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:35,410
Another city.

1416
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:37,996
Another city, huh?

1417
01:38:39,498 --> 01:38:42,626
Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.

1418
01:38:43,168 --> 01:38:46,421
<i>I want you to know,
you don't got to stay.</i>

1419
01:38:48,757 --> 01:38:50,550
If we're not gonna make it...

1420
01:38:50,717 --> 01:38:55,180
...it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capable.

1421
01:38:56,515 --> 01:39:00,852
I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something
being wrong for the rest of my life.

1422
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:13,448
<i>It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.</i>

1423
01:39:31,716 --> 01:39:34,469
- Of course I know how to spot a cop.
- How's that?

1424
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:37,681
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.

1425
01:39:37,848 --> 01:39:41,101
Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.

1426
01:39:41,268 --> 01:39:42,269
Yeah.

1427
01:39:42,435 --> 01:39:46,148
Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.

1428
01:39:46,773 --> 01:39:49,609
- Okay.
- You get it now, do you?

1429
01:39:55,574 --> 01:39:57,534
- What about this guy?
- Cop.

1430
01:40:00,078 --> 01:40:02,831
Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?

1431
01:40:04,583 --> 01:40:06,918
She ignored us so she must be a cop.

1432
01:40:07,085 --> 01:40:09,421
She's probably
the fucking police commissioner.

1433
01:40:20,932 --> 01:40:24,936
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

1434
01:40:26,688 --> 01:40:31,318
- I thought I was on for this.
- I changed my mind. Take the night off.

1435
01:40:31,484 --> 01:40:35,697
Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.

1436
01:40:36,448 --> 01:40:39,034
- Jimmy, bring a mop.
- Out the back.

1437
01:40:40,035 --> 01:40:42,120
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

1438
01:40:42,287 --> 01:40:44,623
- ...and there's guys that don't.
- And a pail.

1439
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,627
You're a cop.

1440
01:40:49,127 --> 01:40:50,462
What?

1441
01:40:50,629 --> 01:40:52,756
You ignored us, you're a cop.

1442
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:57,510
We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-looking women are cops.

1443
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:02,098
Well, I'm going home, all right?
He's playing with his new guys.

1444
01:41:02,265 --> 01:41:04,184
- See you later, all right?
- See you later.

1445
01:41:11,024 --> 01:41:14,110
He's moving something with all new guys.
A whole new crew.

1446
01:41:14,277 --> 01:41:17,489
No, no, I can't tell you what or where.
It's probably disinformation.

1447
01:41:17,656 --> 01:41:20,951
Just keep following him, all right?
Listen, I need to see you today.

1448
01:41:21,117 --> 01:41:22,535
- <i>Tomorrow.</i>
- No, no, no. Today.

1449
01:41:22,702 --> 01:41:25,080
- You heard nothing about drugs?
- <i>No.</i>

1450
01:41:25,247 --> 01:41:28,708
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?

1451
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:32,671
Not a thing. And I would have.
That information would have come to me.

1452
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:36,174
It ain't Bill.

1453
01:41:36,341 --> 01:41:38,093
No way, he says.

1454
01:41:50,605 --> 01:41:52,983
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1455
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:54,693
Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.

1456
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:59,239
I want constant surveillance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.

1457
01:42:00,282 --> 01:42:01,992
Good. Thank you.

1458
01:42:04,828 --> 01:42:08,748
Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we following Captain Queenan?

1459
01:42:08,915 --> 01:42:10,834
To find out about the good Catholic life?

1460
01:42:11,001 --> 01:42:14,170
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely...

1461
01:42:14,337 --> 01:42:18,091
...however fucking painful it might be
to your delicate fucking sensibilities.

1462
01:42:18,258 --> 01:42:20,260
Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?

1463
01:42:20,427 --> 01:42:23,972
- <i>I just don't like it, sarge. Don't feel right.</i>
- I have reason to believe...

1464
01:42:24,139 --> 01:42:26,891
...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.

1465
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:29,352
So just follow him and don't get made.

1466
01:42:32,689 --> 01:42:35,567
Sarge, we got the target coming out.

1467
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:13,271
Hey. Where are you?

1468
01:43:13,438 --> 01:43:15,398
<i>Look down the car.</i>

1469
01:43:16,775 --> 01:43:19,277
- <i>You got me?</i>
- Yeah, I gotcha.

1470
01:43:19,444 --> 01:43:21,279
Is there a reason you would have a tail?

1471
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:23,198
No.

1472
01:43:24,824 --> 01:43:27,660
- Because I think--
- Billy, I don't have a tail.

1473
01:43:28,995 --> 01:43:32,624
Get off at the next stop, all right?
South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.

1474
01:43:32,791 --> 01:43:35,085
South Station. Wait 10 minutes.

1475
01:44:10,995 --> 01:44:14,207
He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

1476
01:44:14,374 --> 01:44:16,918
You got that? 344 Wash.

1477
01:44:21,089 --> 01:44:22,715
Yeah, he went up to the top floor.

1478
01:44:27,303 --> 01:44:29,973
Building's empty. No tenants here.

1479
01:44:31,474 --> 01:44:34,769
He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He--

1480
01:44:35,603 --> 01:44:37,105
He's getting spooky, captain.

1481
01:44:37,272 --> 01:44:38,398
- What?
- I just saw him.

1482
01:44:38,565 --> 01:44:41,109
He had blood on his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.

1483
01:44:47,699 --> 01:44:50,118
I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.

1484
01:44:50,743 --> 01:44:53,705
He's not including his regular guys.
But I'll tell you something.

1485
01:44:53,872 --> 01:44:57,417
Sooner or later he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.

1486
01:44:57,584 --> 01:44:59,919
- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!
- All right!

1487
01:45:06,759 --> 01:45:09,721
I think we got him. I think Queenan's
meeting with him right now.

1488
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:11,598
All right, all right. Listen to me.

1489
01:45:11,764 --> 01:45:14,559
I'm really sorry for your trouble.
I swear to God I am.

1490
01:45:14,726 --> 01:45:18,021
I'll get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'll get you out.

1491
01:45:19,063 --> 01:45:20,148
Yeah?

1492
01:45:20,315 --> 01:45:23,026
Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.

1493
01:45:23,193 --> 01:45:25,528
- What about the FBI?
- They're compromised.

1494
01:45:25,695 --> 01:45:27,113
- They're what?
- They're fucked.

1495
01:45:31,159 --> 01:45:32,327
- Yeah.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

1496
01:45:32,494 --> 01:45:34,787
We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.

1497
01:45:35,246 --> 01:45:37,248
<i>Listen, we're gonna take him out.
Lookit:</i>

1498
01:45:37,415 --> 01:45:40,043
The address is 314 Washington Street.
You got it?

1499
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:41,628
All right, we'll see you there.

1500
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:43,421
- What?
- You were followed.

1501
01:45:43,588 --> 01:45:45,173
- By who?
- By Costello's people.

1502
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:46,758
- Impossible.
- One of the cops...

1503
01:45:46,925 --> 01:45:49,677
...he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.

1504
01:45:50,637 --> 01:45:52,180
Come on!

1505
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:01,272
What the fuck is going on?

1506
01:46:02,398 --> 01:46:05,235
Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's
meeting with all of them.

1507
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:08,571
Yeah, he must be our guy.

1508
01:46:08,738 --> 01:46:12,033
<i>Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.
Those guys aren't fucking around.</i>

1509
01:46:16,955 --> 01:46:19,791
Ah, Christ, it's too late.
Let's go back up.

1510
01:46:23,878 --> 01:46:25,672
- Shit!
- You got to get out of here!

1511
01:46:25,838 --> 01:46:27,674
- Take the fire escape.
- What about you?

1512
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:30,885
I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!

1513
01:46:48,486 --> 01:46:51,072
- One of you mugs got a light?
- Where's your boy?

1514
01:46:51,239 --> 01:46:54,284
- He's studying law at Notre Dame.
- Where's your fucking boy?

1515
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:56,536
- Hey! Hey!
- Goddamn motherfucker!

1516
01:46:56,703 --> 01:46:58,746
- Fucking kill you!
- Where's your fucking boy?

1517
01:47:15,054 --> 01:47:18,057
What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?

1518
01:47:22,395 --> 01:47:24,439
Sarge, something
just came off the building.

1519
01:47:25,231 --> 01:47:27,317
What the fuck?

1520
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:31,362
Fuck.

1521
01:47:31,529 --> 01:47:33,448
What do you mean,
off the building?

1522
01:47:33,615 --> 01:47:36,326
- Something came off the fucking roof.
- It's a fucking body.

1523
01:47:45,084 --> 01:47:46,919
We can't get a visual.
Want us to get out?

1524
01:47:47,086 --> 01:47:49,881
We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.

1525
01:47:50,465 --> 01:47:51,966
- Where were you?
- What happened?

1526
01:47:52,133 --> 01:47:53,926
You're fucking late! Get in the van!

1527
01:47:54,093 --> 01:47:55,470
What do you mean,
off the roof?

1528
01:47:55,637 --> 01:47:57,305
What's going on? I came to meet you.

1529
01:47:57,472 --> 01:47:59,015
- What the fuck--?
- Get in the van!

1530
01:47:59,182 --> 01:48:02,101
I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?

1531
01:48:02,268 --> 01:48:04,354
No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.

1532
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,648
- Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
- I need information.

1533
01:48:06,814 --> 01:48:08,191
What came off the roof?

1534
01:48:08,358 --> 01:48:09,859
- No pursuit.
- That's bullshit.

1535
01:48:10,026 --> 01:48:11,778
Fuck this.

1536
01:48:19,869 --> 01:48:21,496
Fitzy! Get in the van!

1537
01:48:22,997 --> 01:48:25,917
Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!

1538
01:48:26,084 --> 01:48:27,752
All right. I got him.

1539
01:48:34,175 --> 01:48:36,386
32X to CP. We're being fired upon!

1540
01:48:36,552 --> 01:48:39,931
<i>An officer is down. I repeat,
an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!</i>

1541
01:48:40,098 --> 01:48:42,141
<i>Send some back--</i>

1542
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:02,620
So do you know
why Queenan went into that building?

1543
01:49:02,787 --> 01:49:04,664
- No.
- Well, a better question...

1544
01:49:04,831 --> 01:49:06,999
...is why the fuck
were your guys following him?

1545
01:49:07,166 --> 01:49:09,919
I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.

1546
01:49:10,086 --> 01:49:12,463
- Why?
- That's Internal Investigations' business.

1547
01:49:13,381 --> 01:49:15,049
Fucking piece of shit!

1548
01:49:15,216 --> 01:49:16,718
- All right.
- Hey, hey!

1549
01:49:16,884 --> 01:49:18,261
- Fucking bitch!
- Let him go!

1550
01:49:18,428 --> 01:49:21,597
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain
anything to anybody!

1551
01:49:21,764 --> 01:49:23,933
I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!

1552
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:26,310
- Come on!
- I don't give a fuck what you think!

1553
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:29,897
I got reason to believe that Queenan
got killed by his fucking undercover.

1554
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:31,149
That's a fucking lie.

1555
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:34,902
He has fucking information
in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.

1556
01:49:35,069 --> 01:49:36,654
I need access to those files.

1557
01:49:36,821 --> 01:49:39,866
I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'll give it to you.

1558
01:49:40,032 --> 01:49:42,160
- That's a fucking lie.
- Nobody calls me a liar!

1559
01:49:42,326 --> 01:49:45,163
Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unlock those files.

1560
01:49:45,329 --> 01:49:48,166
- Dignam, take a leave of absence.
- Take a leave of what?

1561
01:49:48,332 --> 01:49:51,294
Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.

1562
01:49:51,461 --> 01:49:53,838
I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.

1563
01:49:54,005 --> 01:49:57,383
World needs plenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.

1564
01:49:57,550 --> 01:49:59,010
Good.

1565
01:50:00,845 --> 01:50:02,472
- Piece of shit.
- Fuck off.

1566
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:06,225
- I need those codes.
- No.

1567
01:50:06,392 --> 01:50:08,519
You want those codes.

1568
01:50:11,647 --> 01:50:13,357
So where the fuck were you?

1569
01:50:15,026 --> 01:50:17,612
Well, boss told me to go home.

1570
01:50:17,779 --> 01:50:21,991
Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you weren't at fucking home.

1571
01:50:22,158 --> 01:50:23,618
So where the fuck were you?

1572
01:50:24,202 --> 01:50:27,121
I was at the grocery store
with no signal, all right?

1573
01:50:27,288 --> 01:50:29,290
When I got the signal, I got the call.

1574
01:50:29,457 --> 01:50:32,502
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

1575
01:50:32,668 --> 01:50:34,712
Billy. Billy.

1576
01:50:41,093 --> 01:50:42,637
Yeah?

1577
01:50:44,847 --> 01:50:46,849
Yeah?

1578
01:50:47,308 --> 01:50:49,477
You know what I thought today?

1579
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:52,980
What's that?

1580
01:50:53,981 --> 01:50:57,443
Who didn't show up today is the rat.

1581
01:51:00,905 --> 01:51:02,281
Yeah?

1582
01:51:03,324 --> 01:51:07,119
- So?
- And you never been late in your life.

1583
01:51:09,038 --> 01:51:11,249
When I called you...

1584
01:51:11,415 --> 01:51:13,668
... I made a mistake.

1585
01:51:13,835 --> 01:51:17,630
I gave you the wrong address...

1586
01:51:17,797 --> 01:51:21,634
...but you showed up at the right one...

1587
01:51:22,093 --> 01:51:24,011
...didn't you?

1588
01:51:25,263 --> 01:51:27,849
Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?

1589
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:30,434
Tell me why.

1590
01:51:53,332 --> 01:51:56,752
That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.

1591
01:51:56,919 --> 01:51:58,713
He's dead.

1592
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,506
I'm going home.

1593
01:52:00,673 --> 01:52:03,467
- Your guys should not have done that.
- <i>One of us had to die.</i>

1594
01:52:03,634 --> 01:52:05,678
With me it tends to be the other guy.

1595
01:52:05,845 --> 01:52:07,305
But Queenan.
Now I got no access.

1596
01:52:07,471 --> 01:52:10,683
You killed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

1597
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:13,519
- <i>He resigned.</i>
- I don't give a fuck about Dignam.

1598
01:52:13,686 --> 01:52:15,146
<i>He put in his papers, Frank.</i>

1599
01:52:15,313 --> 01:52:19,400
- He left. I don't know where he is.
- Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.

1600
01:52:19,567 --> 01:52:20,985
<i>That Irish pissant...</i>

1601
01:52:21,152 --> 01:52:24,822
...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.

1602
01:52:24,989 --> 01:52:27,074
<i>Let's give him a whiff.</i>

1603
01:52:27,241 --> 01:52:30,912
- I will.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1604
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:34,248
Sweetheart.

1605
01:52:34,415 --> 01:52:36,626
You're giving me a hard-on.

1606
01:52:37,209 --> 01:52:38,628
Are you sure it's me?

1607
01:52:39,128 --> 01:52:42,381
Not all that talk
about whiffing and crawling up asses?

1608
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,842
Watch your fucking mouth.

1609
01:52:45,009 --> 01:52:47,470
No. You watch it.

1610
01:52:48,179 --> 01:52:50,473
Let me straighten you out.

1611
01:52:58,356 --> 01:53:01,233
I tried to call you a few times.

1612
01:53:04,445 --> 01:53:06,197
I know.

1613
01:53:32,598 --> 01:53:36,519
Listen, I can't be a friend to you.

1614
01:53:41,649 --> 01:53:43,567
I'm sorry.

1615
01:53:50,032 --> 01:53:51,742
Yeah...

1616
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:57,957
... I know.

1617
01:56:06,585 --> 01:56:08,087
Yeah.

1618
01:56:08,879 --> 01:56:12,133
You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.

1619
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:14,135
Who are you?

1620
01:56:14,385 --> 01:56:16,637
So it is you.

1621
01:56:17,847 --> 01:56:20,850
Well, thank God you're all right.
We were very worried.

1622
01:56:22,226 --> 01:56:23,894
Who are you?

1623
01:56:24,770 --> 01:56:26,814
This is Sergeant Sullivan.

1624
01:56:26,981 --> 01:56:28,732
I'm taking over Queenan's unit.

1625
01:56:29,441 --> 01:56:31,485
Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.

1626
01:56:31,652 --> 01:56:32,987
<i>Staff Sergeant Dignam...</i>

1627
01:56:33,154 --> 01:56:36,365
...is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.

1628
01:56:36,532 --> 01:56:38,742
We're all very upset.

1629
01:56:39,368 --> 01:56:42,121
<i>I think the best thing would be
for you to come in.</i>

1630
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:46,000
We need you to come in.
Can you come in?

1631
01:56:47,459 --> 01:56:48,460
<i>We'll meet--</i>

1632
01:57:27,625 --> 01:57:29,960
<i>Police confirm
the body of the man found dead...</i>

1633
01:57:30,127 --> 01:57:32,087
<i>...in the Fenway marshes
yesterday...</i>

1634
01:57:32,254 --> 01:57:35,257
<i>...is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...</i>

1635
01:57:35,424 --> 01:57:37,927
<i>...the city of Boston.
This was the scene yesterday...</i>

1636
01:57:38,093 --> 01:57:41,055
<i>...when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.</i>

1637
01:57:41,222 --> 01:57:42,806
<i>As for who did this or why...</i>

1638
01:57:42,973 --> 01:57:45,351
<i>...that's something police
are working on right now.</i>

1639
01:57:45,517 --> 01:57:48,979
- I don't believe it.
- What can't you believe?

1640
01:57:49,230 --> 01:57:52,691
I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

1641
01:57:52,858 --> 01:57:54,818
Tell me how they found him so fast.

1642
01:57:54,985 --> 01:57:57,613
Somebody walking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?

1643
01:57:57,780 --> 01:57:59,949
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

1644
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:02,243
Must have been a big fucking dog, man.

1645
01:58:02,409 --> 01:58:04,662
I spent all fucking night doing it, man.

1646
01:58:04,995 --> 01:58:06,330
I'm embarrassed.

1647
01:58:06,997 --> 01:58:09,667
I still don't believe he was a cop.
I don't believe it.

1648
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:14,338
The cops are saying he's a cop...

1649
01:58:14,713 --> 01:58:16,924
...so I won't look for the cop.

1650
01:58:18,175 --> 01:58:19,843
Are you soft, Fitz?

1651
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:24,974
When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh...

1652
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:28,060
...you dump him in the marsh.

1653
01:58:29,019 --> 01:58:32,398
Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday...

1654
01:58:32,564 --> 01:58:34,692
...to get a fucking blow job!

1655
01:58:35,442 --> 01:58:37,611
Don't laugh!

1656
01:58:38,445 --> 01:58:41,365
This ain't reality TV!

1657
01:58:45,286 --> 01:58:47,037
Proceed.

1658
01:59:09,518 --> 01:59:10,978
- What?
- Yeah.

1659
01:59:11,145 --> 01:59:13,897
You got a tail. Two cars.
Not very subtle.

1660
01:59:14,064 --> 01:59:17,651
They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.

1661
01:59:17,818 --> 01:59:18,944
So get rid of them.

1662
01:59:19,111 --> 01:59:22,239
There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.

1663
01:59:22,406 --> 01:59:24,616
Get rid of the fucking tail!

1664
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:31,123
All right.

1665
01:59:37,421 --> 01:59:40,632
Fucking rats. It's wearing me thin.

1666
01:59:40,799 --> 01:59:43,594
Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.

1667
01:59:59,943 --> 02:00:03,280
Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello.
There's no need to surveil him.

1668
02:00:03,447 --> 02:00:05,783
- What are you saying?
- I got it from an undercover.

1669
02:00:05,949 --> 02:00:08,619
He knows he's being followed.
So let the UC take him in.

1670
02:00:08,827 --> 02:00:10,204
- Undercover?
- Queenan's guy.

1671
02:00:10,371 --> 02:00:13,040
He called when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.

1672
02:00:13,207 --> 02:00:16,126
- You give him to me.
- No, I can give you Costello's destination.

1673
02:00:16,335 --> 02:00:18,796
- You know where he's going?
- Yes. And what he's doing.

1674
02:00:18,962 --> 02:00:21,131
Get rid of the tail,
get Special Ops on standby.

1675
02:00:21,298 --> 02:00:23,759
- We'll take this prick tonight.
- Let's go. Now.

1676
02:00:23,926 --> 02:00:26,929
All units fall back.
All units fall back.

1677
02:00:47,282 --> 02:00:49,326
It's the warehouse he owns
over on Sheffield.

1678
02:00:49,493 --> 02:00:52,162
He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.

1679
02:01:16,395 --> 02:01:17,938
Load it.

1680
02:01:25,946 --> 02:01:28,240
Frank, how do you know
you don't have a tail, huh?

1681
02:01:29,533 --> 02:01:31,493
Were you not in the fucking car?

1682
02:01:31,660 --> 02:01:34,705
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

1683
02:01:37,916 --> 02:01:39,710
Load.

1684
02:01:47,301 --> 02:01:49,136
Go, go!

1685
02:01:51,555 --> 02:01:53,223
Come on, what are you waiting for?

1686
02:01:55,225 --> 02:01:57,352
Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.

1687
02:01:57,519 --> 02:02:00,981
- Watch your fucking back.
- Move out! Go on!

1688
02:02:09,990 --> 02:02:12,409
Cocksuckers.

1689
02:02:18,415 --> 02:02:21,001
Motherfucking shit!

1690
02:02:24,421 --> 02:02:26,089
Motherfucking...!

1691
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:31,762
Back the fuck up!

1692
02:02:31,929 --> 02:02:34,056
They fucking shot me.

1693
02:02:37,768 --> 02:02:38,894
Get down!

1694
02:02:41,897 --> 02:02:43,440
Come on, fucking bastards!

1695
02:03:02,167 --> 02:03:03,627
Fuck it.

1696
02:03:43,083 --> 02:03:46,837
How the fuck did this happen?

1697
02:03:48,255 --> 02:03:50,841
You're an FBI informant?

1698
02:03:51,008 --> 02:03:53,218
Are you fucking kidding me?

1699
02:03:54,678 --> 02:03:56,388
Grow up.

1700
02:03:57,097 --> 02:04:00,017
Of course I talk to the FBI.

1701
02:04:00,183 --> 02:04:01,685
Do they know who I am?

1702
02:04:03,645 --> 02:04:08,025
I never gave up anybody
who wasn't going down anyway.

1703
02:04:09,026 --> 02:04:11,486
Nobody knows nothing.

1704
02:04:13,071 --> 02:04:14,573
Frank.

1705
02:04:14,865 --> 02:04:17,784
Frank. Frank.

1706
02:04:17,951 --> 02:04:19,953
Do they know about me?

1707
02:04:21,663 --> 02:04:24,207
I know about you, Collie.

1708
02:04:24,374 --> 02:04:27,210
You know I'd never give you up.

1709
02:04:27,919 --> 02:04:30,714
- You're like a--
- What? Like a son?

1710
02:04:31,590 --> 02:04:34,968
To you? Is that what this is about?

1711
02:04:35,927 --> 02:04:40,265
All that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.

1712
02:05:02,287 --> 02:05:04,748
Fucking rat prick!

1713
02:05:26,311 --> 02:05:27,938
<i>Frank?</i>

1714
02:05:28,105 --> 02:05:29,606
Yeah?

1715
02:05:31,316 --> 02:05:32,567
Who's this?

1716
02:05:34,444 --> 02:05:36,113
Gwen?

1717
02:05:37,239 --> 02:05:39,324
Where the hell's Frank?

1718
02:05:40,409 --> 02:05:42,202
Frank got shot.

1719
02:05:45,038 --> 02:05:47,457
Gwen, we lost Frank.

1720
02:05:55,799 --> 02:05:57,467
I got him!

1721
02:05:57,634 --> 02:06:00,053
I got Costello here!

1722
02:06:04,182 --> 02:06:06,685
Hey, good job, sarge.

1723
02:06:07,477 --> 02:06:09,020
No, it's...

1724
02:06:10,439 --> 02:06:12,023
For you.

1725
02:06:13,108 --> 02:06:16,153
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

1726
02:06:19,656 --> 02:06:22,909
He's been waiting here
a long time for you.

1727
02:06:23,118 --> 02:06:25,537
How'd you get him without the files?

1728
02:06:25,704 --> 02:06:28,498
Caller ID on Queenan's phone.

1729
02:06:29,499 --> 02:06:30,834
You know that guy?

1730
02:06:31,001 --> 02:06:33,879
Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.

1731
02:06:41,344 --> 02:06:43,013
Good to see you, trooper.

1732
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:45,849
- Yeah.
- Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.

1733
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:47,559
- Yeah.
- So.

1734
02:06:49,102 --> 02:06:50,854
Now, how long were you undercover?

1735
02:06:51,021 --> 02:06:52,939
Long time.

1736
02:06:53,106 --> 02:06:54,941
- Long fucking time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1737
02:06:55,358 --> 02:07:00,280
Well, I can't even tell you the debt...

1738
02:07:03,116 --> 02:07:06,453
I just want you to know I'll be
recommending you for the Medal of Merit.

1739
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:08,330
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1740
02:07:09,247 --> 02:07:11,625
That's kind of like a gold star
around here, huh?

1741
02:07:13,668 --> 02:07:15,462
It's the highest honor we got.

1742
02:07:15,629 --> 02:07:18,423
Look, I just want
my identity back, all right?

1743
02:07:18,590 --> 02:07:20,592
- That's all.
- All right.

1744
02:07:20,759 --> 02:07:23,678
- I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
- No, no.

1745
02:07:23,845 --> 02:07:27,432
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

1746
02:07:27,724 --> 02:07:30,685
Check your computer. Go on.
You'll have to excuse my behavior.

1747
02:07:30,852 --> 02:07:34,815
My only contact in the last six months
has been a police shrink.

1748
02:07:37,442 --> 02:07:39,736
How's that working for you?

1749
02:07:39,903 --> 02:07:41,655
Is it helpful?

1750
02:07:42,405 --> 02:07:45,158
What are you gonna do
about Costello's rat in this building?

1751
02:07:47,744 --> 02:07:50,997
- I'm gonna find the prick.
- Yeah.

1752
02:07:51,414 --> 02:07:54,125
I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.

1753
02:07:54,292 --> 02:07:57,462
- Good.
- Anything you can do to help me...

1754
02:07:57,629 --> 02:08:01,466
You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name--? You know, anything.

1755
02:08:01,633 --> 02:08:04,261
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

1756
02:08:04,427 --> 02:08:06,972
I'm all done being a cop, all right?

1757
02:08:07,138 --> 02:08:09,307
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

1758
02:08:09,474 --> 02:08:11,893
All right. That'll be
the best thing for everybody.

1759
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:13,436
Fair enough.

1760
02:08:14,062 --> 02:08:18,525
I just, I can't get into your file
unless I have your password.

1761
02:08:20,694 --> 02:08:21,736
It's my name.

1762
02:08:22,529 --> 02:08:24,906
William Costigan Jr.

1763
02:08:25,073 --> 02:08:28,326
They gave it to me in case I had to
explain myself to someone like you.

1764
02:08:28,910 --> 02:08:30,829
It's your name.

1765
02:08:32,956 --> 02:08:34,332
All right.

1766
02:08:34,499 --> 02:08:37,210
Fucking unreal, that--
Well, makes a lot of sense.

1767
02:08:37,377 --> 02:08:39,629
Listen, Bill, I gotta run this
in the other room.

1768
02:08:39,796 --> 02:08:42,048
This computer's getting
all frigging blooey on me.

1769
02:08:42,215 --> 02:08:45,969
Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.

1770
02:10:19,312 --> 02:10:23,149
All right, everything checks out,
so let's get you paid.

1771
02:10:54,097 --> 02:10:55,890
I know.

1772
02:10:57,434 --> 02:10:59,936
I know. I'm not--
I'm not here for that, okay?

1773
02:11:00,186 --> 02:11:01,771
I'm not.

1774
02:11:03,982 --> 02:11:07,277
Listen. I've gotta give you something.

1775
02:11:07,444 --> 02:11:09,863
Something I need you to keep.

1776
02:11:10,030 --> 02:11:11,614
For me.

1777
02:11:13,908 --> 02:11:15,493
Okay?

1778
02:11:19,122 --> 02:11:23,418
- What is it?
- This is for you to hold. Only you.

1779
02:11:23,585 --> 02:11:27,547
You open this if something happens to me
or if I call you and I tell you to open it.

1780
02:11:27,714 --> 02:11:30,300
You're the only person
I can trust, all right?

1781
02:11:31,885 --> 02:11:33,470
Please.

1782
02:11:37,015 --> 02:11:39,434
- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry to even--

1783
02:11:39,601 --> 02:11:42,312
I'm sorry to even show up here
like this, you know?

1784
02:11:42,479 --> 02:11:45,732
I-- There's just no one else
I could give it to.

1785
02:11:47,150 --> 02:11:49,319
There's no one else.

1786
02:11:50,111 --> 02:11:52,822
- I'm really sorry.
- I...

1787
02:11:53,448 --> 02:11:55,408
You know, I have...

1788
02:11:55,575 --> 02:11:57,994
- I...
- Whatever you have to say...

1789
02:11:58,161 --> 02:12:00,371
...think about it real hard, all right?

1790
02:12:00,538 --> 02:12:04,084
If you still wanna tell me,
you tell me in two weeks, okay?

1791
02:12:33,863 --> 02:12:35,782
I was dreaming I was dead.

1792
02:12:37,158 --> 02:12:41,371
Death is hard. Life is much easier.

1793
02:12:42,288 --> 02:12:45,542
- What's this?
- Open it.

1794
02:12:54,384 --> 02:12:57,053
- Really?
- Yeah.

1795
02:12:58,054 --> 02:12:59,556
Really?

1796
02:13:00,223 --> 02:13:01,724
Yeah.

1797
02:13:01,891 --> 02:13:05,478
And they say
that this little speck...

1798
02:13:05,645 --> 02:13:07,856
...is a penis.

1799
02:13:11,109 --> 02:13:12,986
It's a boy.

1800
02:13:13,153 --> 02:13:15,947
Yeah, well,
one usually follows the other.

1801
02:13:17,448 --> 02:13:19,450
Can you still...?

1802
02:14:10,001 --> 02:14:12,003
<i>I hope I won't have to remind you...</i>

1803
02:14:12,170 --> 02:14:16,382
<i>...that if you don't find this cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...</i>

1804
02:14:16,549 --> 02:14:20,220
<i>...you can assume it won't be me
who pays for it.</i>

1805
02:14:20,386 --> 02:14:23,223
<i>Now, why would you
have to remind me of that?</i>

1806
02:14:23,389 --> 02:14:28,686
<i>Would I--? Would I be any good at what
I do if I didn't fucking already know that?</i>

1807
02:14:28,853 --> 02:14:32,065
<i>Frank, you gotta trust me.
I can get the rat.</i>

1808
02:14:32,232 --> 02:14:34,609
<i>You just gotta let me do it
my way, Frank.</i>

1809
02:14:34,776 --> 02:14:38,154
<i>Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.</i>

1810
02:14:38,321 --> 02:14:42,158
<i>Hey, it fucking involves lying and
I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?</i>

1811
02:14:45,870 --> 02:14:47,455
What?

1812
02:14:51,042 --> 02:14:52,543
What?

1813
02:14:54,837 --> 02:14:57,173
<i>-We got a cop in my crew.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

1814
02:14:57,340 --> 02:15:01,302
<i>-I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
- He's one of yours. Inside.</i>

1815
02:15:01,469 --> 02:15:02,804
<i>-You seen anything?
- Frank.</i>

1816
02:15:02,971 --> 02:15:06,557
<i>I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.</i>

1817
02:15:06,724 --> 02:15:11,312
- <i>I'm doing my--</i>
- You know what, I thought I was the liar.

1818
02:15:11,479 --> 02:15:14,399
Hey, I can explain that!

1819
02:15:19,570 --> 02:15:21,614
Costello recorded everything.

1820
02:15:21,781 --> 02:15:26,369
He put all the tapes in a box and kept them
with his lawyer. That was his insurance.

1821
02:15:26,536 --> 02:15:28,037
His lawyer came to me.

1822
02:15:28,204 --> 02:15:29,956
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

1823
02:15:30,123 --> 02:15:32,125
<i>Costello trusted me more than anyone.</i>

1824
02:15:32,792 --> 02:15:36,004
Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.

1825
02:15:36,504 --> 02:15:39,090
- What do you want?
- I told you I want my identity back...

1826
02:15:39,257 --> 02:15:41,301
...you two-faced faggot.

1827
02:15:41,592 --> 02:15:45,430
- All right, where are you?
- Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

1828
02:15:45,596 --> 02:15:47,557
You keep your cell on.

1829
02:15:59,652 --> 02:16:01,404
Open the door.

1830
02:16:05,408 --> 02:16:09,412
Open-- Didn't we already talk about this?

1831
02:16:10,580 --> 02:16:12,749
This is my job.

1832
02:16:38,024 --> 02:16:40,026
- Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
- Hey!

1833
02:16:40,193 --> 02:16:41,736
Put the fucking gun down!

1834
02:16:41,903 --> 02:16:45,114
Put the gun down, all right?
I came here to talk some sense into you.

1835
02:16:45,281 --> 02:16:46,866
- Hands!
- Just act professional.

1836
02:16:47,033 --> 02:16:49,077
- I can get you your money.
- What did you say?

1837
02:16:49,243 --> 02:16:52,830
- I can get you your money.
- You didn't come here to talk, all right?

1838
02:16:52,997 --> 02:16:55,958
- You came here to get arrested.
- You got fucking tapes? Of what?

1839
02:16:56,125 --> 02:16:59,629
Costello was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.

1840
02:16:59,796 --> 02:17:01,798
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

1841
02:17:01,964 --> 02:17:03,841
Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!

1842
02:17:04,008 --> 02:17:06,427
What is this, a citizen's arrest?
Blow me, all right?

1843
02:17:06,594 --> 02:17:09,430
Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.
You understand that, Bill?

1844
02:17:09,597 --> 02:17:11,474
- No one knows you.
- Shut the fuck up!

1845
02:17:11,641 --> 02:17:14,936
I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State Police. Who the fuck are you?

1846
02:17:15,103 --> 02:17:18,231
- I erased you!
- You erased me, huh?

1847
02:17:18,398 --> 02:17:21,067
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.

1848
02:17:21,234 --> 02:17:23,694
This bullet would
go right through your fucking head!

1849
02:17:23,861 --> 02:17:26,572
- Watch what happens!
- What, so you can get the parade, huh?

1850
02:17:26,739 --> 02:17:31,202
The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!

1851
02:17:31,369 --> 02:17:34,163
- That's the stupidest thing you could do.
- Shut the fuck up!

1852
02:17:36,874 --> 02:17:39,127
I could give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.

1853
02:17:39,293 --> 02:17:41,003
I'm still fucking arresting you.

1854
02:17:41,421 --> 02:17:43,339
Get up.

1855
02:17:44,507 --> 02:17:47,510
Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.

1856
02:17:47,677 --> 02:17:50,221
I called you. You specifically. Look:

1857
02:17:50,388 --> 02:17:53,766
You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I told you to meet me downstairs.

1858
02:17:53,933 --> 02:17:56,894
Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!

1859
02:17:57,061 --> 02:17:59,188
Where's Dignam?
I told you to bring Dignam!

1860
02:17:59,355 --> 02:18:01,607
Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot!

1861
02:18:01,774 --> 02:18:05,486
- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?

1862
02:18:05,653 --> 02:18:10,324
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!

1863
02:18:12,702 --> 02:18:14,662
Maybe you do.

1864
02:18:14,829 --> 02:18:16,956
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

1865
02:18:17,123 --> 02:18:20,084
I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, all right?

1866
02:18:20,251 --> 02:18:23,212
- Would you shoot this fucking prick!
- You know who I am.

1867
02:18:23,379 --> 02:18:25,506
- You know who I am.
- Shoot this fucking prick.

1868
02:18:25,673 --> 02:18:27,884
I'm taking him downstairs now.

1869
02:18:31,179 --> 02:18:33,014
You know who I am.

1870
02:18:58,122 --> 02:18:59,999
Shut up.

1871
02:19:01,042 --> 02:19:04,086
I can't wait to see you explain this
to a Suffolk County jury...

1872
02:19:04,253 --> 02:19:05,421
...you fucking cocksucker.

1873
02:19:05,588 --> 02:19:08,132
This is gonna be fucking fun.

1874
02:19:19,268 --> 02:19:21,604
Just fucking kill me.

1875
02:19:23,189 --> 02:19:25,358
Just fucking kill me.

1876
02:19:27,610 --> 02:19:29,695
I am killing you.

1877
02:20:05,898 --> 02:20:08,651
Did you think you were the only one
he had on the inside?

1878
02:20:08,859 --> 02:20:11,153
Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.

1879
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:13,030
It's you and me now, you understand?

1880
02:20:13,197 --> 02:20:16,075
We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?

1881
02:20:29,672 --> 02:20:31,299
Give me that.

1882
02:20:46,689 --> 02:20:50,067
<i>Right. Slow. March.</i>

1883
02:20:58,284 --> 02:21:00,494
<i>I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...</i>

1884
02:21:00,661 --> 02:21:05,207
<i>...at which time he drew down on me,
and I was able to squeeze off one shot...</i>

1885
02:21:05,374 --> 02:21:07,543
<i>...and strike him in the head.</i>

1886
02:21:07,710 --> 02:21:10,129
<i>At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...</i>

1887
02:21:10,296 --> 02:21:12,506
<i>...on both
Troopers Brown and Costigan...</i>

1888
02:21:12,673 --> 02:21:15,843
...and discovered that they had expired.

1889
02:21:19,013 --> 02:21:21,265
I just wanna go on record.

1890
02:21:22,016 --> 02:21:25,978
I'm recommending William Costigan
for the Medal of Merit.

1891
02:21:36,947 --> 02:21:39,283
- Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.
- Ready?

1892
02:21:39,450 --> 02:21:42,370
- And let perpetual light shine upon him.
- Fold.

1893
02:21:42,536 --> 02:21:45,331
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1894
02:21:45,498 --> 02:21:47,833
May his soul and the souls...

1895
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:52,838
...of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

1896
02:21:53,005 --> 02:21:54,590
Amen.

1897
02:22:24,036 --> 02:22:26,288
Detail. Half left. Face.

1898
02:22:27,623 --> 02:22:29,625
Prepare to fire.

1899
02:22:29,875 --> 02:22:31,502
Fire.

1900
02:22:31,669 --> 02:22:34,171
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1901
02:22:35,089 --> 02:22:38,134
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1902
02:22:38,551 --> 02:22:41,846
Detail. Half right. Face.

1903
02:22:55,276 --> 02:22:57,653
I'll catch up with you guys.

1904
02:23:04,910 --> 02:23:06,746
What about the baby?

1905
02:23:24,472 --> 02:23:26,098
Hi, pup.

1906
02:23:57,630 --> 02:23:59,256
Okay.

1907
02:31:13,815 --> 02:31:15,817
