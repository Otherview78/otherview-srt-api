1
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:52,939
<i>- There he is!
- Shh!</i>

2
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:54,059
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

3
00:00:54,223 --> 00:00:57,739
<i>Superman, Superman,
can we ask you some questions?</i>

4
00:00:57,903 --> 00:00:59,132
<i>It's for our podcast.</i>

5
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:00,344
<i>Well, in that case...</i>

6
00:01:00,504 --> 00:01:03,258
<i>- How many people have you saved?
- I...</i>

7
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:05,700
<i>Never mind. Does your thing
really stand for hope?</i>

8
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:06,934
<i>Yes. It does.</i>

9
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:08,464
<i>But it looks like an "S".</i>

10
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:09,978
<i>Yes. It's meant to. It's...</i>

11
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:13,301
<i>It's meant to wind like a river.</i>

12
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:15,297
<i>It comes and goes. My...</i>

13
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:20,543
<i>A man I knew used to say
hope is like your car keys.</i>

14
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:24,262
<i>Easy to lose, but if you dig around,
it's usually close by.</i>

15
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:26,224
<i>Did you ever fight a hippo?</i>

16
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,386
<i>No. Shh! That's dumb.</i>

17
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:29,339
<i>But hippos are the most deadly.</i>

18
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:31,338
<i>Uh... What is, uh...</i>

19
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,344
<i>What's the best thing
about planet Earth?</i>

20
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:34,503
<i>Hmm...</i>

21
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:04,114
What are you doing?

22
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:07,513
Wait. No, wait. Wait. Wait!

23
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,873
Please! Please, man. Please!

24
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:15,548
What do you want from me?

25
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:17,069
Fear.

26
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:19,747
They can smell it.

27
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:21,874
What the hell?

28
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:32,318
What was that?

29
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:33,677
A scout.

30
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:35,956
From space?

31
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:37,802
<i>Like an alien army?</i>

32
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:39,556
<i>Alfred, are you seeing this?</i>

33
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:42,473
I am.
Matches the other sightings.

34
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:46,595
And that pattern is all over
Luthor's notes.

35
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:48,403
Prep the jet. We're going north tonight.

36
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:51,764
Good. It's time then.

37
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:56,153
It's 'cause they know
he's dead, right?

38
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:57,993
Superman.

39
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:00,724
He's gone.

40
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:03,482
<i>Where does that leave us?</i>

41
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,377
Drop your guns now!

42
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:08,571
Excuse me.

43
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:13,896
Go!

44
00:08:18,102 --> 00:08:20,094
Move it! Move! Move!

45
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:24,658
Get down!

46
00:08:25,742 --> 00:08:27,700
Line them up along the wall!

47
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:29,013
Keep them quiet!

48
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:34,536
<i>Children, stay close to me.</i>

49
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,819
Who are you?

50
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:05,740
The Lasso of Hestia compels you
to reveal the truth.

51
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:08,020
Now, who are you?

52
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:11,620
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists.

53
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:13,923
We know that sin has brought on
this plague of aliens.

54
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:15,540
Why the hostages?

55
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:17,945
You're too late.

56
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:20,144
The countdown's already begun.

57
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:24,307
In a few minutes, four city blocks...

58
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:27,468
<i>While the world watches.</i>

59
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:30,818
<i>Hush!</i>

60
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:31,984
Shut up!

61
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:33,946
This is man's best hope.

62
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:36,022
Down with the modern world.

63
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:38,423
Back to the Dark Ages

64
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:41,349
and the safety of holy fear.

65
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:44,269
Quiet!

66
00:10:22,593 --> 00:10:24,153
This would've been over quickly, but...

67
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:27,544
No! Don't!

68
00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:50,155
I don't believe it.

69
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:51,630
<i>What are you?</i>

70
00:10:51,795 --> 00:10:53,149
A believer.

71
00:11:30,198 --> 00:11:32,031
<i>I'm asking for your help.</i>

72
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:37,637
I believe there is a stranger
who comes to this village from the sea.

73
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,070
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

74
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,998
Brings fish.

75
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,917
<i>He comes on the king tide.</i>

76
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,549
That was last night.

77
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,801
Icebergs in the harbor, four months
since the last ship got through.

78
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:59,915
Well, this stranger doesn't come
by ship.

79
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:04,991
There are enemies coming from far away.

80
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:07,962
I need warriors.

81
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:11,633
<i>I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.</i>

82
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:15,560
Look, I'll give you 25,000
to talk to this man right now.

83
00:12:15,722 --> 00:12:16,918
<i>Outside.</i>

84
00:12:39,644 --> 00:12:41,876
Tell me what those three boxes are
and I'll make it 30.

85
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:47,325
You should get out.

86
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:49,045
Can you at least point me to Atlantis?

87
00:12:52,086 --> 00:12:53,236
Arthur Curry.

88
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:02,441
Also known as Protector of the Oceans.

89
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:04,479
The Aquaman.

90
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:08,480
I hear you can talk to fish.

91
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,647
So let me get this straight.

92
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:16,364
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

93
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:18,406
It's worked for 20 years in Gotham.

94
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:20,361
Oh, that shithole.

95
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:22,366
When the fight comes, we'll need you.

96
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,088
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

97
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:25,624
'Cause I don't like you coming here,

98
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:27,609
digging into my business
and getting into my life.

99
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,721
People from Atlantis tell me, "Do this."
Now you say, "Do that."

100
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:31,959
I wanna be left alone.

101
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:34,545
Is that why you help these people
out here in the middle of nowhere?

102
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:35,844
'Cause you can just leave?

103
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:38,206
I help them 'cause no one else does.

104
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,125
If you want to protect them,
you need to work with me.

105
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,203
"Strong man is strongest alone."
You ever heard that?

106
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,690
That's not a saying.

107
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,490
That's the opposite
of what the saying is.

108
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,840
Yeah...

109
00:13:49,891 --> 00:13:51,848
<i>Doesn't mean I'm wrong.</i>

110
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:53,650
You ever hear of Superman?

111
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:55,524
He died fighting next to me.

112
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:57,125
My point exactly.

113
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:00,846
What's in the three boxes?

114
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:02,812
It's ancient history.

115
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:04,012
What is it?

116
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,812
Mankind's melting the polar ice caps,
destroying the ecosystem.

117
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,088
They got it coming?

118
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:11,643
Hey, I don't mind if the oceans rise.

119
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:13,486
How about if they boil?

120
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,567
Dressed like a bat.

121
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:18,292
You're out of your mind, Bruce Wayne.

122
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,083
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

123
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:38,533
So, you say you have no way
of reconnecting with this Aquaman?

124
00:14:38,735 --> 00:14:40,852
Oh, I put a tracking device
in his coat,

125
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:42,005
but he left without it.

126
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,807
May, in fact, not have been his coat.

127
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:50,170
Those squares from Luthor's notes.

128
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:52,487
I think they must be containers
of some kind.

129
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:53,692
Of what?

130
00:14:53,856 --> 00:14:56,087
I don't know. Money. Power.

131
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,812
<i>- Something worth starting a war over.
- Hmm.</i>

132
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:03,297
Well, we've had luck with one person
on the team list.

133
00:15:03,497 --> 00:15:06,456
<i>Barry Allen of Central City.</i>

134
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:08,576
He's completely off the grid.

135
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:11,936
Squatting, I think.
Moves suddenly and often.

136
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:13,288
Disappearing act.

137
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,415
<i>But he does visit his father.</i>

138
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:18,738
In prison for murdering his mother.

139
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:19,938
Jesus.

140
00:15:20,098 --> 00:15:22,455
<i>Young Barry always protested
his father's innocence.</i>

141
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:25,049
<i>But he was nine
and nobody listened to him.</i>

142
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,379
We have somebody at the prison?

143
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,371
<i>Oh, yeah. We'll find the address.</i>

144
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:31,894
What about, uh, Diana?

145
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,460
Well, you have her number.

146
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,620
What, you could've called her.

147
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,060
Oh. Perhaps I should fly to Paris
with a handwritten note.

148
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,732
"Will you be Bruce's teammate?
Check yes or no."

149
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,574
I'm only interested in her skillset.

150
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,215
I'm sure you are.

151
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:48,656
Can we?

152
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:52,093
Uh, well, facial recognition's
a bit dodgy on this one.

153
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,213
<i>But they've got a partial match.</i>

154
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:56,055
<i>A Victor Stone.</i>

155
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,292
<i>Genius IQ,</i>

156
00:15:57,462 --> 00:16:01,376
football scholarship to GCU
and deceased.

157
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:04,216
Figures. Fairy tales and ghost stories.

158
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:05,611
One misses the days

159
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:09,379
when one's biggest concerns
were exploding wind-up penguins.

160
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:11,057
The simple life.

161
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,097
I don't recognize this world.

162
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:17,056
I don't have to recognize it.

163
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:20,695
I just have to save it.

164
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:28,333
Here to see Henry Allen.

165
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,259
Sign.

166
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:36,300
Hurry it up, will you?

167
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,060
What, you got a problem?

168
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:43,546
No, there's no problem.

169
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:46,256
Better not be.

170
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:52,056
You know where to go.

171
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,980
Are those prescription?

172
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:05,941
Or are you just trying to look brainy?

173
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:12,105
Because you're
holding yourself back.

174
00:17:12,188 --> 00:17:13,338
You're going in circles.

175
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:15,944
You're working three dead-end jobs,
going on four.

176
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:17,429
Where do you even have the time?

177
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:18,549
I make the time.

178
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,349
And this is all to pay
for a criminal justice degree, huh?

179
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:23,429
Okay, I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

180
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:25,029
The investigation was botched.

181
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:26,189
Give me your hand, man.

182
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,670
I want you to listen to me, Barry,
because I mean this.

183
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,709
I want you to give all that up.

184
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:45,550
And I want you to stop coming to see me.

185
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,990
I am a drag on your life.

186
00:17:52,712 --> 00:17:55,671
Please don't ever say that to me again.

187
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:56,942
Please?

188
00:17:57,112 --> 00:17:59,627
You can be whatever you want to be.
You're brilliant, man.

189
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:04,269
Absolute best of the best.

190
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,512
I can't sit here

191
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:10,308
and watch you run in place
in Central City

192
00:18:10,473 --> 00:18:15,265
for some old dude
who is not going anywhere.

193
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:17,869
- Dad, that's not true. That's not true.
- It's time.

194
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:19,548
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

195
00:18:19,714 --> 00:18:21,194
I want you to make your own future.

196
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:23,306
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

197
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:25,785
<i>Open gate.</i>

198
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:50,196
Lab's all yours, Howard.

199
00:18:50,357 --> 00:18:53,156
11:30. Early night for you, Silas.

200
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:56,077
Yes. Early.

201
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:58,635
I never got to say...

202
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,829
I'm very sorry about what happened.

203
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:05,715
Victor was a wonderful kid.

204
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:08,838
Thank you.

205
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:21,549
<i>Victor.</i>

206
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,639
Victor, you're not stuck up here.

207
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,400
You can have a life.
You can have more than...

208
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,595
If you stay up here brooding...

209
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:35,681
<i>I'm processing.</i>

210
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,312
I can access everything.

211
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:40,161
But I can't put it all together.

212
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:44,201
Not yet. But if you worked with me,
if we had the change engine...

213
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:47,560
So you'd do to someone else
what you did to me.

214
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:48,722
No.

215
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:50,953
The box stays hidden.

216
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:53,956
If you could see what we're learning
from the Kryptonian ship...

217
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:56,837
I think the change engine
could integrate with its energy,

218
00:19:57,003 --> 00:19:58,073
get it powered up and...

219
00:19:58,243 --> 00:19:59,359
<i>Does anybody know?</i>

220
00:19:59,443 --> 00:20:00,443
What?

221
00:20:00,603 --> 00:20:02,196
At the lab.

222
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:03,483
Does anybody know I'm alive?

223
00:20:04,043 --> 00:20:05,716
Uh...

224
00:20:06,843 --> 00:20:08,764
<i>- I didn't think you were ready for...
- To what?</i>

225
00:20:09,244 --> 00:20:10,883
For them to see the monster?

226
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:13,999
You are not a monster.

227
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:16,878
It's weird that you thought I meant me.

228
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:21,519
What I did...

229
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:25,804
I lost your mother in that accident.

230
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,720
<i>I wasn't about to...</i>

231
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:31,520
I couldn't bear to lose my son.

232
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:33,325
But you did.

233
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,557
I got a language in my head
that I don't speak.

234
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:40,443
It's not just digital. It's alien.

235
00:20:41,726 --> 00:20:44,447
Every day, I wake up different.

236
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,687
Modified.

237
00:20:48,887 --> 00:20:49,957
<i>How do you...</i>

238
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,241
Couldn't do that last night.

239
00:20:59,328 --> 00:21:01,524
<i>Ever since we got visitors
from Krypton</i>

240
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:04,328
people have been waiting
for the next alien invasion.

241
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:08,726
Now I gotta wonder if I'm it.

242
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:26,485
Any changes today?

243
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:28,170
No, my Queen.

244
00:22:29,576 --> 00:22:33,206
The Mother Box has awoken,
yet nothing has happened.

245
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:37,650
It has slept for thousands of years
since the First Age.

246
00:22:37,817 --> 00:22:39,410
Why did it wake at all?

247
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:50,130
Amazons! On your mark!

248
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:00,054
<i>Yes, soldiers! Fight on!</i>

249
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:01,579
<i>Ready!</i>

250
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,689
Steppenwolf.

251
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,420
<i>Mother.</i>

252
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,541
Millennia in exile, searching...

253
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:28,297
At last you call me home.

254
00:23:28,461 --> 00:23:30,418
You will not like your welcome.

255
00:23:30,861 --> 00:23:33,421
Oh, I think I will.

256
00:23:38,422 --> 00:23:39,492
<i>Steady!</i>

257
00:23:43,062 --> 00:23:44,062
Forward!

258
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:57,700
Gather the legions!

259
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:59,304
You must seal the cage!

260
00:23:59,464 --> 00:24:01,262
Go!

261
00:24:01,464 --> 00:24:02,944
Flank right!

262
00:24:08,945 --> 00:24:10,015
Yes.

263
00:24:10,705 --> 00:24:11,775
Run.

264
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:13,135
Seal the gates!

265
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:37,421
Keep it moving.

266
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:43,387
Got it! Go!

267
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:54,588
Enough.

268
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:06,026
Noble Queen, why do you fight?

269
00:26:06,755 --> 00:26:10,954
After the unity,
you will join my legion

270
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,506
and you will know the righteousness
of power.

271
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,471
You will love me.

272
00:26:29,957 --> 00:26:32,233
You all will.

273
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,350
We have to light
the ancient warning fire.

274
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,352
The fire has not burned for 5,000 years.

275
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,159
Men won't know what it means.

276
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,674
Men won't.

277
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,920
She will.

278
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:25,035
Listen to me, Diana.

279
00:27:45,603 --> 00:27:47,835
What did you do
this weekend, Diana?

280
00:27:48,004 --> 00:27:49,597
- Me?
- Yeah.

281
00:27:49,804 --> 00:27:51,636
Nothing very interesting.

282
00:27:51,764 --> 00:27:54,677
That's all you ever tell us.

283
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:56,995
What can I say, I'm not that exciting.

284
00:27:57,084 --> 00:27:59,281
<i>...so-called shrine of the Amazons,</i>

285
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:03,155
<i>an enormous bonfire burned
right behind me</i>

286
00:28:03,325 --> 00:28:07,842
<i>baffling absolutely everyone from locals
to government authorities alike.</i>

287
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:10,995
<i>The fire could be seen for miles on end.</i>

288
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:12,885
Invasion.

289
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:17,482
<i>On the local scene this janitor's wife
had some strong words</i>

290
00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:21,196
<i>for the aliens she says stole her man.</i>

291
00:28:21,406 --> 00:28:25,037
<i>My Howard is a good man.
He's a provider.</i>

292
00:28:26,127 --> 00:28:28,562
<i>And these aliens are gonna
f♪♪♪♪♪♪ probe him?</i>

293
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:30,967
<i>Come down to the Lakeview</i>

294
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:34,599
<i>and I'll stick a f♪♪♪♪♪♪ probe
up your alien a♪♪. You...</i>

295
00:28:34,808 --> 00:28:37,846
<i>I found a little place.
By the diner.</i>

296
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,442
<i>Suits me just fine.</i>

297
00:28:39,648 --> 00:28:41,082
I wish you'd said something.

298
00:28:41,248 --> 00:28:43,365
<i>Oh, no.
I got behind in the payments.</i>

299
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:47,848
And you know the banks jump like
a cougar if you miss by a dime.

300
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:50,086
Place was too big for me, anyway.

301
00:28:50,249 --> 00:28:52,286
Shuffling around like an old ghost.

302
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:55,288
Well, I might've been able
to talk to someone, or...

303
00:28:55,489 --> 00:28:59,120
You had enough to deal with. Don't need
to add "mother-in-law" to the list.

304
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,170
Not that I was ever...

305
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,850
<i>Hey, Lane.</i>

306
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:07,443
Who was your source, um,
the activist in that university?

307
00:29:08,051 --> 00:29:09,371
Well, it's my source.

308
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:12,126
<i>I got tapped for the kidnapping story.</i>

309
00:29:12,371 --> 00:29:15,523
There were all those student protests.
Anyway, I'm thinking it's political.

310
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:17,563
<i>So, who's your guy?</i>

311
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:19,729
Well, I'll see if she'll take your call.

312
00:29:19,852 --> 00:29:22,447
So it's a she. Hmm.

313
00:29:24,692 --> 00:29:26,126
It's not a she.

314
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,483
Sounds like you should be working
that story.

315
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:31,409
I'm...

316
00:29:32,653 --> 00:29:34,212
I'm not ready yet.

317
00:29:34,453 --> 00:29:36,843
I'm perfectly happy doing fluff pieces

318
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:38,811
about kitten grooming.

319
00:29:39,053 --> 00:29:40,533
For a while.

320
00:29:41,853 --> 00:29:44,608
It was, uh,
hard coming back here at all.

321
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:48,648
Well, I can hardly read the news,
anyway.

322
00:29:48,814 --> 00:29:50,533
So much bitterness.

323
00:29:51,174 --> 00:29:53,644
Of course I think it's all
because he's gone.

324
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:57,287
But I suppose a mother does.

325
00:29:59,175 --> 00:30:02,134
But it's not like there's any less
that needs reporting.

326
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:05,050
And Clark promised me you were
gonna bring home another Pulitzer.

327
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:06,216
Oh, did he?

328
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:07,571
Oh, yes. He did.

329
00:30:07,736 --> 00:30:11,013
He said that you were the thirstiest
young woman that he'd ever met.

330
00:30:13,216 --> 00:30:14,411
Hungriest.

331
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,129
Yeah.

332
00:30:18,097 --> 00:30:22,535
He said you could smell a story
further away than he could hear.

333
00:30:24,737 --> 00:30:28,448
Well, stories just made sense.

334
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:32,415
It was more than just a puzzle.
It was about the truth.

335
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:37,411
It was about seeing the engine
of the world.

336
00:30:38,098 --> 00:30:39,931
When it still ran.

337
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:51,374
<i>Victor Stone. Deceased.</i>

338
00:31:33,063 --> 00:31:34,099
That one.

339
00:31:35,063 --> 00:31:37,215
Pretty sure that's what made
the alien go crazy.

340
00:31:37,424 --> 00:31:39,461
<i>I'll see about rigging something
for the suit.</i>

341
00:31:39,624 --> 00:31:40,694
<i>Won't be quick.</i>

342
00:31:40,864 --> 00:31:42,617
Anything that can give me an edge.

343
00:31:54,465 --> 00:31:57,697
You know, I paid millions of dollars
for this building's security.

344
00:31:57,905 --> 00:32:00,421
Yeah, it looked expensive.

345
00:32:04,066 --> 00:32:05,102
Hi.

346
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:07,735
A new toy?

347
00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:09,784
Prototype troop carrier.

348
00:32:10,866 --> 00:32:13,939
I once knew a man
who would have loved to fly it.

349
00:32:14,107 --> 00:32:15,257
<i>Yeah.</i>

350
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:18,141
<i>We're gonna need more than a pilot.</i>

351
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:20,187
I think there's an attack coming.

352
00:32:20,387 --> 00:32:21,707
<i>Not coming, Bruce.</i>

353
00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:24,420
It's already here.

354
00:32:27,788 --> 00:32:31,145
<i>They called him Steppenwolf,
the end of worlds.</i>

355
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:35,267
<i>He lived only to conquer.</i>

356
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,548
<i>Millions fell before his blade,</i>

357
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:42,059
<i>or rose again as his Parademons.</i>

358
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:44,664
<i>Nightmare creatures who feed on fear.</i>

359
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,950
Yeah, I think I met one.

360
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,510
We didn't hit it off.

361
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,706
Here in Gotham?

362
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,950
They're all over.
They're looking for his boxes?

363
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,464
The Mother Boxes.

364
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,900
Mother Boxes.

365
00:32:58,071 --> 00:33:00,047
I guess Steppenwolf took the one
your people were guarding.

366
00:33:00,071 --> 00:33:01,710
That leaves two more.

367
00:33:01,871 --> 00:33:02,987
I'm impressed.

368
00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:05,143
Don't be.
I have no idea what's in them.

369
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:07,189
A weapon? Some kind of power?

370
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:09,264
They don't contain power.

371
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:12,708
They are power.

372
00:33:13,712 --> 00:33:15,988
<i>Carried from planet to planet,</i>

373
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:19,270
<i>the Mother Boxes combine
to form the unity.</i>

374
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:23,063
<i>An apocalyptic power
that not only destroys worlds,</i>

375
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:26,431
<i>but transforms them
into the primordial hellscape</i>

376
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:28,471
<i>of Steppenwolf's birth world.</i>

377
00:33:30,353 --> 00:33:31,913
<i>We should have died.</i>

378
00:33:32,074 --> 00:33:34,270
<i>But we formed our own unity.</i>

379
00:33:34,874 --> 00:33:37,389
<i>Amazons, Atlanteans,</i>

380
00:33:37,634 --> 00:33:41,389
<i>all the tribes of men
fought side by side.</i>

381
00:33:43,715 --> 00:33:44,751
<i>Warriors of legend,</i>

382
00:33:48,955 --> 00:33:50,833
<i>allies from other worlds,</i>

383
00:33:52,675 --> 00:33:55,794
<i>even the gods themselves
all acted as one.</i>

384
00:33:56,636 --> 00:33:59,674
<i>Laying down their lives
to drive Steppenwolf away.</i>

385
00:34:11,797 --> 00:34:13,914
<i>Some say it drove him mad.</i>

386
00:34:14,077 --> 00:34:16,751
<i>The disgrace of his first retreat.</i>

387
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:19,513
<i>He swore our alliance would crumble.</i>

388
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,477
<i>That darkness would cover the Earth.</i>

389
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:28,997
<i>And that he would return when it did.</i>

390
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,034
<i>Left behind,</i>

391
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,471
<i>the Mother Boxes were too dangerous
to be kept together.</i>

392
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:42,799
<i>One was entrusted to the Amazons.</i>

393
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,353
<i>One to the Atlanteans.</i>

394
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,279
<i>Both sealed and guarded
in secure strongholds.</i>

395
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,552
<i>The Box of Men was buried in secret</i>

396
00:34:55,121 --> 00:34:59,354
<i>so that no tribe would be tempted
to use its power over another.</i>

397
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:06,120
Such harmony out of such horror.

398
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:08,638
It was truly an Age of Heroes.

399
00:35:09,202 --> 00:35:12,240
Something tells me we're not getting
the band back together.

400
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,473
The Atlanteans were forced undersea,

401
00:35:14,642 --> 00:35:17,317
and the Amazons to an island
they can never leave.

402
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:20,595
Well, I wouldn't count on
the tribes of men.

403
00:35:20,763 --> 00:35:23,358
We tend to act like the Doomsday Clock
has a snooze button.

404
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:26,242
- How long until...
- Days.

405
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,244
At most.

406
00:35:29,284 --> 00:35:31,958
Steppenwolf's mistake last time
was attacking us.

407
00:35:32,124 --> 00:35:34,593
He wanted to make the Earth kneel
before he destroyed us.

408
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:37,564
This time he'll just go after the boxes.

409
00:35:38,725 --> 00:35:41,115
I got a location for
one of our recruits. Barry Allen.

410
00:35:41,325 --> 00:35:43,920
What about the other one?
Victor Stone?

411
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,485
I was hoping you would dig him up.

412
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:51,082
We're asking people we don't know
to risk their lives.

413
00:35:51,326 --> 00:35:52,442
I know.

414
00:35:54,006 --> 00:35:55,565
That's how this works.

415
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:30,004
Barry Allen, Bruce Wayne.

416
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:32,562
You said that like it explains

417
00:36:32,729 --> 00:36:35,119
why there's a total stranger
in my place

418
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,640
sitting in the dark
in my second favorite chair.

419
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,323
Tell me about this.

420
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:48,764
This is a person who looks exactly
like me, but who is definitely not me.

421
00:36:50,051 --> 00:36:52,327
<i>Very attractive Jewish boy.</i>

422
00:36:53,131 --> 00:36:56,090
<i>Somebody who, I don't know,
stole your pocket watch?</i>

423
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:58,129
<i>Or railroads?</i>

424
00:36:58,332 --> 00:37:00,210
I know you have abilities.

425
00:37:00,372 --> 00:37:02,443
I just don't know what they are.

426
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:05,247
My special skills include viola,

427
00:37:05,412 --> 00:37:08,325
web design, fluent in sign language...

428
00:37:08,532 --> 00:37:09,532
Gorilla sign language.

429
00:37:09,692 --> 00:37:13,926
Silica-based quartz sand fabric,
abrasion resistant, heat resistant.

430
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:16,130
Uh, yeah, I do competitive ice dancing.

431
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,893
It's what they use on the space shuttle

432
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:19,811
to prevent it from burning up
on reentry.

433
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:22,409
I do very competitive ice dancing.

434
00:37:23,854 --> 00:37:26,449
Whoever you're looking for, it's not me.

435
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:52,046
You're the Batman?

436
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,690
So, you're fast.

437
00:37:54,656 --> 00:37:56,296
That feels like an oversimplification.

438
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:59,973
I'm putting together a team.
People with special abilities.

439
00:38:00,137 --> 00:38:01,696
You see, I believe enemies are coming.

440
00:38:01,857 --> 00:38:03,610
Stop right there. I'm in.

441
00:38:04,217 --> 00:38:05,936
- You are?
- Yeah, uh...

442
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,291
I need friends.

443
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:14,090
People are difficult.
They require a lot of focus. They, uh...

444
00:38:14,178 --> 00:38:17,057
They have, like, a rhythm that
I haven't quite been able to...

445
00:38:17,218 --> 00:38:18,218
Like brunch!

446
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:21,018
Like, what is brunch?

447
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:24,695
You wait in line for an hour
for, essentially, lunch.

448
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:26,179
I mean...

449
00:38:26,979 --> 00:38:28,174
I don't know.

450
00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:31,892
People are a little slow.

451
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,060
I'll try to keep up.

452
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,813
Can I keep this?

453
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,329
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

454
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,716
and it seems to manipulate space-time.

455
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,061
I call it the Speed Force.

456
00:38:42,261 --> 00:38:44,157
Causes me to burn
a tremendous amount of calories.

457
00:38:44,181 --> 00:38:46,776
So I'm just a black hole of snacks.

458
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:48,694
I am a "snack" hole.

459
00:38:49,701 --> 00:38:52,580
How many people
are on this special fight team?

460
00:38:52,741 --> 00:38:54,381
Three, including you.

461
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:56,295
Three? Against what?

462
00:38:57,062 --> 00:38:58,542
I'll tell you on the plane.

463
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:00,136
The plane?

464
00:39:00,902 --> 00:39:02,541
What are your superpowers again?

465
00:39:03,222 --> 00:39:04,542
I'm rich.

466
00:39:28,985 --> 00:39:32,501
The program always gets twitchy
with this footage.

467
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:44,066
You know who we are.

468
00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:50,301
Are you Victor Stone?

469
00:39:56,187 --> 00:39:57,462
I need to speak to you.

470
00:39:59,587 --> 00:40:01,306
No. Face-to-face.

471
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:02,982
I'm old-fashioned that way.

472
00:40:06,228 --> 00:40:09,904
If I was going to attack you,
I would have done it by the lake.

473
00:40:13,749 --> 00:40:15,342
Looks like you have a date, Ms. Prince.

474
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:19,709
About time somebody here did.

475
00:40:52,152 --> 00:40:53,586
Face-to-face.

476
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:56,111
I've been doing some tracking.

477
00:40:58,592 --> 00:41:01,711
What you're looking for
is sticking to the dead zones.

478
00:41:01,913 --> 00:41:04,587
If it gets in front of a camera,
causes a surge...

479
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:06,513
I'll let you know.

480
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:07,743
That's not good enough.

481
00:41:07,953 --> 00:41:09,706
Not good enough?

482
00:41:09,873 --> 00:41:11,228
<i>For you.</i>

483
00:41:11,914 --> 00:41:15,624
Look, I don't know you, and I don't know
how you got these gifts.

484
00:41:15,794 --> 00:41:16,944
Gifts?

485
00:41:17,114 --> 00:41:18,867
No one else can do what you do.

486
00:41:20,074 --> 00:41:22,350
If these are gifts,

487
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:24,108
then why am I the one paying for them?

488
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:25,788
We need you, Victor.

489
00:41:27,115 --> 00:41:28,629
And maybe you need us.

490
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:30,909
I do fine alone.

491
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:33,910
I told myself the same for a long time.

492
00:41:39,076 --> 00:41:41,466
I lost someone I loved once.

493
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:46,634
I shut myself off...

494
00:41:47,637 --> 00:41:48,753
From everyone.

495
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:52,027
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

496
00:41:54,957 --> 00:41:57,712
The truth is I'm still working on it.

497
00:41:57,878 --> 00:42:00,791
And if you agreed to meet me,

498
00:42:02,638 --> 00:42:04,675
you're working on it, too.

499
00:42:06,078 --> 00:42:07,148
<i>Trust me, Victor.</i>

500
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,910
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

501
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:21,517
<i>Something came down from the sky!</i>

502
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,909
<i>Cortlandt, you're cutting out.</i>

503
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,150
<i>Please help me!</i>

504
00:42:46,802 --> 00:42:48,202
Whiskey.

505
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:50,202
And one for Ahab, there.

506
00:42:50,322 --> 00:42:51,676
From the sky.

507
00:42:52,682 --> 00:42:54,595
I... I heard a cannon.

508
00:42:54,763 --> 00:42:55,992
To ocean's rage.

509
00:42:56,203 --> 00:42:57,203
<i>They came.</i>

510
00:42:58,083 --> 00:43:01,759
<i>Monsters from the sky.</i>

511
00:43:02,683 --> 00:43:04,515
<i>Tore right through my boat.</i>

512
00:43:06,244 --> 00:43:07,473
Monsters.

513
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:10,400
It's on him.

514
00:45:35,497 --> 00:45:37,170
You took a hell of a hit.

515
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:38,777
You all right?

516
00:45:38,857 --> 00:45:40,291
<i>At last.</i>

517
00:45:40,497 --> 00:45:42,807
The firstborn of beloved Queen Atlanna.

518
00:45:45,137 --> 00:45:46,207
Wait.

519
00:45:48,218 --> 00:45:49,218
Please.

520
00:45:52,298 --> 00:45:53,368
I knew her.

521
00:45:55,498 --> 00:45:56,932
Well, that makes one of us.

522
00:45:57,098 --> 00:45:58,692
When my parents fought in the wars

523
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:01,019
she took me in.

524
00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:02,179
What a saint.

525
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,092
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

526
00:46:04,259 --> 00:46:06,171
Your Queen left me
on my father's doorstep

527
00:46:06,259 --> 00:46:07,395
and never gave me another thought.

528
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:09,616
Your mother left you to save your life.

529
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,490
Cannot imagine how it hurt her.

530
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,094
What it cost her.

531
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,773
But you're not a defenseless child now.

532
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,300
It would have been her responsibility

533
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:24,295
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop it.

534
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:26,851
Now,

535
00:46:27,981 --> 00:46:28,981
it's yours.

536
00:46:31,261 --> 00:46:33,982
Then I'm gonna need something from you.

537
00:47:33,547 --> 00:47:35,539
<i>I see, Mother.</i>

538
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:40,137
<i>I see why you waited to summon me.</i>

539
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:45,863
<i>The Kryptonian's death plunged
this timid world into such terror.</i>

540
00:47:46,028 --> 00:47:48,463
<i>Amazons, Atlanteans,</i>

541
00:47:48,628 --> 00:47:52,668
each stands and falls alone.

542
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:59,939
I know, Mother,
you've waited too long for the unity.

543
00:48:00,149 --> 00:48:03,108
I know. But you will feed.

544
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:09,820
And my exile will come to an end.

545
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:14,030
I will take my place among the New Gods.

546
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,944
Find the last one!

547
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:21,828
Its power will cleanse this world.

548
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:25,070
For the unity!

549
00:48:26,751 --> 00:48:28,345
<i>For Darkseid.</i>

550
00:48:37,272 --> 00:48:39,230
Oh, Victor.

551
00:48:50,153 --> 00:48:51,383
Asshole!

552
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:54,149
Eight kidnappings.
Six in Metropolis, two here.

553
00:48:54,314 --> 00:48:56,510
All the vics work for S. T. A. R. Labs.

554
00:48:58,674 --> 00:49:01,109
"Attacked by a flying vampire."

555
00:49:01,755 --> 00:49:05,465
"Suspect was a giant bat
with huge fangs."

556
00:49:05,635 --> 00:49:07,035
One of them was a little kid.

557
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:09,312
Scared.
Won't say a word but drew this.

558
00:49:09,475 --> 00:49:11,626
- Looks like...
- I know what it looks like.

559
00:49:12,355 --> 00:49:14,632
Come on, you think he fights criminals
for 20 years here

560
00:49:14,796 --> 00:49:17,914
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

561
00:49:18,836 --> 00:49:20,395
I'll talk to him tonight.

562
00:49:20,996 --> 00:49:22,988
World's gone crazy, Jim.

563
00:49:23,156 --> 00:49:25,114
Maybe he did, too.

564
00:49:29,157 --> 00:49:30,386
Did you find the cyborg?

565
00:49:31,797 --> 00:49:33,356
We spoke.

566
00:49:33,557 --> 00:49:34,911
Give him time.

567
00:49:36,117 --> 00:49:37,757
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

568
00:49:37,918 --> 00:49:39,398
Hi, Barry, I'm Diana.

569
00:49:39,598 --> 00:49:41,794
That's not right. Great.

570
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:43,870
- So this is us?
- Yeah, this is us.

571
00:49:44,078 --> 00:49:45,194
Oh!

572
00:49:45,278 --> 00:49:46,792
Awesome!

573
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:48,759
That's the Bat-Signal! That's your...
Oh. Shh.

574
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,592
Sorry. That's your signal.

575
00:49:50,759 --> 00:49:51,919
That means we have to go now.

576
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:53,552
Yeah, that's... That's what that means.

577
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:56,154
It's so cool.

578
00:50:30,722 --> 00:50:32,122
How many of you are there?

579
00:50:32,802 --> 00:50:34,362
Not enough.

580
00:50:35,443 --> 00:50:37,719
Eight people abducted from
or near S. T. A. R. Labs.

581
00:50:38,323 --> 00:50:40,042
<i>Here's the potential perp.</i>

582
00:50:40,603 --> 00:50:41,923
Parademons.

583
00:50:42,163 --> 00:50:43,597
Okay.

584
00:50:43,803 --> 00:50:45,940
The demons must have
caught the scent of the Mother Box.

585
00:50:45,964 --> 00:50:48,524
They carried people away to find out
what they know.

586
00:50:48,684 --> 00:50:50,324
- So the eight may still be alive.
- Nine.

587
00:50:53,924 --> 00:50:55,995
The head of S. T. A. R. Labs
was taken as well.

588
00:50:57,125 --> 00:50:58,241
<i>You made it.</i>

589
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:02,920
<i>So then, there must be a nest nearby.</i>

590
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:06,277
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

591
00:51:06,485 --> 00:51:08,159
No pattern I can see.

592
00:51:08,366 --> 00:51:09,662
The lines on the map don't converge.

593
00:51:09,686 --> 00:51:10,961
On land.

594
00:51:11,126 --> 00:51:13,561
<i>These lead back to Braxton Island
between the two cities.</i>

595
00:51:13,726 --> 00:51:14,842
<i>Gotham Harbor.</i>

596
00:51:15,006 --> 00:51:16,201
These are air vents.

597
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:18,562
They all lead down to the tunnel for
Metropolis Project

598
00:51:18,686 --> 00:51:20,519
that was abandoned in '29.

599
00:51:23,127 --> 00:51:24,766
Do you really think that...

600
00:51:26,047 --> 00:51:29,006
Oh, wow. They just...
They really just vanish.

601
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:30,237
Huh? Oh.

602
00:51:30,767 --> 00:51:32,088
That's rude.

603
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:01,167
<i>- Where are we, Alfred?
- Braxton Island.</i>

604
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:05,763
You should be directly under
the venting tower for the tunnel.

605
00:52:05,931 --> 00:52:08,844
<i>Now look to your left,
you should see a staircase.</i>

606
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:11,088
<i>It'll give you access
to the machine room.</i>

607
00:52:17,332 --> 00:52:19,051
Define "access."

608
00:52:19,972 --> 00:52:22,009
One at a time.
The bridge may not...

609
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:23,922
Hold.

610
00:52:29,133 --> 00:52:31,728
<i>Just tell me the truth.</i>

611
00:52:31,893 --> 00:52:34,453
<i>Please, just let us go.
I have a family.</i>

612
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:35,842
<i>Wrong answer.</i>

613
00:52:37,093 --> 00:52:38,368
<i>Humans.</i>

614
00:52:38,533 --> 00:52:42,813
<i>The stench of your fear
is making my soldiers hungry.</i>

615
00:52:42,974 --> 00:52:44,772
Shall I feed them?

616
00:52:46,654 --> 00:52:49,965
You've been near the Mother Box.
Her scent is on you.

617
00:52:50,134 --> 00:52:52,445
Please. We have families.

618
00:52:52,615 --> 00:52:54,971
Why does everyone keep telling me that?

619
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:57,127
<i>Please, please.</i>

620
00:52:57,295 --> 00:52:59,605
<i>I don't need to hurt you...</i>

621
00:52:59,855 --> 00:53:02,370
Right. Okay, yeah.
Here's the thing. Um...

622
00:53:02,455 --> 00:53:07,895
See, I'm afraid of bugs and, uh,
guns and obnoxiously tall people.

623
00:53:08,096 --> 00:53:10,247
And murder. And I can't be here.

624
00:53:10,336 --> 00:53:13,568
It's really cool you guys seem ready
to do battle and stuff,

625
00:53:13,736 --> 00:53:16,206
but full transparency,
I've never done battle.

626
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:18,693
I've just pushed some people
and run away.

627
00:53:19,337 --> 00:53:20,771
Save one.

628
00:53:20,937 --> 00:53:21,937
What?

629
00:53:22,057 --> 00:53:23,491
Save one person.

630
00:53:23,937 --> 00:53:26,169
Uh... Which one?

631
00:53:26,378 --> 00:53:29,450
Don't talk, don't fight.
Get in, get one out.

632
00:53:29,658 --> 00:53:30,887
And then?

633
00:53:31,178 --> 00:53:32,578
You'll know.

634
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:35,528
Okay.

635
00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:39,252
Useless.

636
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:42,218
You then.

637
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:46,978
Where is my Mother Box?

638
00:53:48,619 --> 00:53:50,373
I'll die before I tell you.

639
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,852
At last, one that doesn't whine.

640
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,854
But you will scream.

641
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:04,741
Dad.

642
00:54:05,501 --> 00:54:06,651
Victor.

643
00:54:06,821 --> 00:54:10,212
Ah. You were born of her.

644
00:54:10,901 --> 00:54:12,894
A creature of chaos.

645
00:54:13,502 --> 00:54:14,572
Not how I see it.

646
00:54:14,782 --> 00:54:16,455
Give it time.

647
00:54:17,342 --> 00:54:18,412
Ahh!

648
00:54:29,623 --> 00:54:31,501
Amazon!

649
00:54:40,464 --> 00:54:42,421
Okay.

650
00:54:42,584 --> 00:54:44,496
Save one. Save one.

651
00:54:54,665 --> 00:54:56,258
This one is mine.

652
00:54:58,306 --> 00:55:00,377
You overestimate yourself.

653
00:55:00,586 --> 00:55:06,423
Child, my ax is still slick
with the blood of your sisters.

654
00:55:20,788 --> 00:55:22,507
Alfred, I need the Knightcrawler.

655
00:55:22,668 --> 00:55:24,341
Thought you'd never ask.

656
00:55:24,508 --> 00:55:26,864
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

657
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:42,149
- Okay, you good?
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

658
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:44,910
At the end of the hall,
there should be stairs. Go!

659
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,027
He's after the change engine.
His Mother Box.

660
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:48,326
You have to keep him from it.

661
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:50,990
- Help people get to safety. Go!
- Promise me!

662
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:27,949
Finish her!

663
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,914
<i>Sorry, guys.</i>

664
00:56:35,114 --> 00:56:36,753
I didn't bring a sword.

665
00:56:49,835 --> 00:56:52,509
Jesus. He is tall.

666
00:57:37,879 --> 00:57:38,880
Oh, fuck.

667
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:52,637
Uh...

668
00:58:02,722 --> 00:58:06,955
So, you have the blood of the Old Gods
in you.

669
00:58:12,682 --> 00:58:14,561
The Old Gods died.

670
00:58:24,003 --> 00:58:25,279
No!

671
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:44,999
<i>Heads up.</i>

672
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:58,286
Thanks, Alfred,
but I'll take it from here.

673
00:58:58,526 --> 00:59:00,519
Uh, do I know you?

674
00:59:17,568 --> 00:59:20,367
Primitive beings.

675
00:59:25,089 --> 00:59:26,728
What are we under right now?

676
00:59:29,489 --> 00:59:30,889
Gotham Harbor.

677
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:35,760
You all need to move.

678
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:36,850
You get him out.

679
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:38,000
Diana, there's no time.

680
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,202
Also among my fears is drowning.

681
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:42,481
You are a distraction.

682
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,208
Mother is calling.

683
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:50,360
<i>Diana, come on!</i>

684
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:22,650
Oh, come on.

685
01:00:26,534 --> 01:00:27,570
Whoa!

686
01:00:42,576 --> 01:00:43,896
The change engine.

687
01:00:49,336 --> 01:00:50,895
<i>Did he just bail?</i>

688
01:00:51,976 --> 01:00:55,857
<i>Millions in structural damage.
You haven't lost your touch.</i>

689
01:00:56,017 --> 01:00:58,851
But it's good to see you
playing well with others.

690
01:01:02,417 --> 01:01:04,249
Dressed like a bat.

691
01:01:04,417 --> 01:01:05,534
I dig it.

692
01:01:06,298 --> 01:01:08,688
May be temporary.

693
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:11,129
So, what made you change your mind?

694
01:01:11,298 --> 01:01:12,368
Steppenwolf.

695
01:01:13,418 --> 01:01:14,898
He took the Mother Box from Atlantis.

696
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:17,894
All he needs now is the lost Box of Men.

697
01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:19,259
If he doesn't already have it.

698
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:24,133
He doesn't have it.

699
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:14,255
Wow! It's like a cave.

700
01:02:16,664 --> 01:02:18,781
Like a Batcave.

701
01:02:22,944 --> 01:02:24,094
<i>Barry.</i>

702
01:02:25,424 --> 01:02:27,576
My father called it
a change engine.

703
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:30,260
It was found by the British
during World War I.

704
01:02:30,425 --> 01:02:33,623
They studied it, but they
couldn't even date it, it's so old.

705
01:02:34,385 --> 01:02:37,982
It was shelved till
the night Superman died.

706
01:02:38,146 --> 01:02:40,217
Then she lit up like Christmas.

707
01:02:40,386 --> 01:02:41,562
They brought it to S. T. A. R. Labs

708
01:02:41,586 --> 01:02:44,943
where my father recognized it
as a perpetual energy matrix.

709
01:02:45,106 --> 01:02:48,099
Oh, that sounds cool.
I thought it was like a nuclear bomb.

710
01:02:48,186 --> 01:02:50,383
A Mother Box destroys as it creates.

711
01:02:51,427 --> 01:02:54,181
It's a cycle of life,
but a million times faster.

712
01:02:54,947 --> 01:02:57,416
<i>My father thought it was
the key to unlimited energy.</i>

713
01:02:57,747 --> 01:02:58,942
<i>New formulas.</i>

714
01:02:59,587 --> 01:03:01,545
Cellular regeneration.

715
01:03:01,668 --> 01:03:03,546
<i>But it's too volatile to control.</i>

716
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:05,267
He used it on you.

717
01:03:05,828 --> 01:03:07,706
I was in an accident.

718
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:10,064
<i>Should've died.</i>

719
01:03:10,308 --> 01:03:12,744
<i>My father thought
that he could use the Mother Box</i>

720
01:03:12,909 --> 01:03:15,868
<i>to rebuild the broken parts of me
with a few cybernetic enhancements.</i>

721
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:18,061
<i>Instead, he built a living machine</i>

722
01:03:18,269 --> 01:03:20,261
that may be stronger than its host.

723
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:21,545
<i>Too much.</i>

724
01:03:22,149 --> 01:03:23,425
Too much life.

725
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:26,029
What's on your weird mind?

726
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:31,140
Muscles, coordination,
basic cellular integrity.

727
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:33,461
A human being can only absorb so much.

728
01:03:34,751 --> 01:03:37,664
The Mother Box was designed
to reshape a planet.

729
01:03:37,871 --> 01:03:39,021
So?

730
01:03:39,191 --> 01:03:42,104
So, what if you were stronger
than a planet?

731
01:03:42,911 --> 01:03:46,792
Your cells lying dormant,
but incapable of decay.

732
01:03:47,512 --> 01:03:49,390
<i>If you were in a conductive field,</i>

733
01:03:50,032 --> 01:03:51,625
a boost from the Mother Box...

734
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:53,909
Could bring him back to life.

735
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:59,510
The Kryptonian ship has an amniotic
chamber, which would be a perfect...

736
01:03:59,633 --> 01:04:00,633
No.

737
01:04:00,793 --> 01:04:02,227
<i>- Diana.
- Bruce, no.</i>

738
01:04:02,393 --> 01:04:04,862
You have no idea what kind of power
you are dealing with.

739
01:04:05,033 --> 01:04:06,593
Even if there's a fraction of a chance?

740
01:04:06,673 --> 01:04:09,234
That what? That we could raise a monster
like Luthor did?

741
01:04:09,394 --> 01:04:10,914
We have tech Luthor's never even seen.

742
01:04:10,954 --> 01:04:12,627
Superman is dead.

743
01:04:13,714 --> 01:04:15,148
We all wish he weren't.

744
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:16,907
We don't know what state he's in.

745
01:04:17,074 --> 01:04:18,906
We know we can't bring him back.

746
01:04:19,074 --> 01:04:21,670
But this is science beyond our limits.

747
01:04:21,835 --> 01:04:23,731
And that's what science is for.
To do what's never been done.

748
01:04:23,755 --> 01:04:24,791
To make life better.

749
01:04:24,955 --> 01:04:26,150
Or to end it.

750
01:04:26,755 --> 01:04:28,155
Technology is like any other power.

751
01:04:28,315 --> 01:04:31,706
Without reason, without heart,
it destroys us.

752
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:34,549
You're risking lives.

753
01:04:35,476 --> 01:04:36,956
Theirs and maybe countless more.

754
01:04:37,196 --> 01:04:39,506
We don't have time for a control group.

755
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:41,349
Is it a risk? Yes. But it's necessary.

756
01:04:41,556 --> 01:04:43,070
Why, because of your guilt?

757
01:04:45,477 --> 01:04:47,434
Bruce, I was there.

758
01:04:47,597 --> 01:04:49,316
You didn't kill Superman.

759
01:04:50,957 --> 01:04:53,392
At some point, even you have to learn
to move on.

760
01:04:54,037 --> 01:04:55,916
Steve Trevor tell you that?

761
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:11,631
Superman was a beacon to the world.

762
01:05:12,759 --> 01:05:14,239
Why aren't you?

763
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:17,912
<i>You're an inspiration, Diana.</i>

764
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,873
You don't just save people,

765
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,992
you make them see their better selves.

766
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,599
<i>And yet, I'd never heard of you</i>

767
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,358
until Luthor lured you out by stealing
a picture of your dead boyfriend.

768
01:05:31,681 --> 01:05:36,551
You shut yourself down for a century,
so let's not talk about me moving on.

769
01:05:38,241 --> 01:05:41,633
You know that if she kills you,
we'll cover for her.

770
01:05:41,802 --> 01:05:43,600
We are not enough!

771
01:05:43,802 --> 01:05:45,475
Each of us, in our own way,
is held back.

772
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:48,218
And I promise you, Steppenwolf is not
out there talking about ethics.

773
01:05:48,242 --> 01:05:50,837
He's trying to burn down the world!

774
01:05:51,042 --> 01:05:54,275
The way we're gonna stop him
is by using his power,

775
01:05:54,443 --> 01:05:57,436
this power, against him.

776
01:05:58,323 --> 01:05:59,518
I agree.

777
01:06:01,523 --> 01:06:04,483
I don't like the idea of reintegrating
with the Mother Box,

778
01:06:04,644 --> 01:06:06,900
but I was running the numbers
while you were being an asshole

779
01:06:06,924 --> 01:06:09,244
<i>and there is a high probability
that we can bring him back.</i>

780
01:06:09,404 --> 01:06:12,476
Right, right. But we mean bring him back
in like a "Yay, he's back!" way,

781
01:06:12,644 --> 01:06:16,958
<i>not in like a Pet Sematary scenario.</i>

782
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:18,684
You lose something when you die.

783
01:06:19,445 --> 01:06:21,084
Even Superman.

784
01:06:21,245 --> 01:06:22,884
Maybe not his mind.

785
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,399
Maybe his soul.

786
01:06:24,965 --> 01:06:27,526
I'll have a contingency plan for that.

787
01:06:27,686 --> 01:06:30,155
If he wakes up
and you're the first thing he sees,

788
01:06:30,806 --> 01:06:32,320
you'll need one.

789
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:45,679
Well, that was fun while it didn't last.

790
01:06:45,847 --> 01:06:48,487
She could've stopped me.
I practically dared her to.

791
01:06:48,647 --> 01:06:50,605
I don't see why you're pushing her.

792
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:53,888
We have to boost the signal.

793
01:06:54,048 --> 01:06:55,568
Put it through the Batmobile speakers.

794
01:06:55,608 --> 01:06:56,984
Yeah, now you're changing the subject.

795
01:06:57,008 --> 01:06:58,442
I have a contingency.

796
01:06:58,608 --> 01:07:00,440
<i>Diana was right about the risk.</i>

797
01:07:00,648 --> 01:07:03,369
If the plan goes south,
we're gonna bring in the big guns.

798
01:07:03,609 --> 01:07:04,929
But that's not...

799
01:07:05,289 --> 01:07:07,246
Those are very big guns.

800
01:07:07,449 --> 01:07:08,599
You've got a team here.

801
01:07:08,769 --> 01:07:11,329
Superman would bring this team together
better than I ever could.

802
01:07:11,409 --> 01:07:13,686
- His strength...
- It doesn't matter how strong you are.

803
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:15,370
<i>Or what abilities you might have...</i>

804
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:17,123
He was more human than I am.

805
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:23,290
He lived in this world.

806
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:25,926
Fell in love. Had a job.

807
01:07:27,171 --> 01:07:28,685
Despite all that power.

808
01:07:30,531 --> 01:07:32,284
The world needs Superman.

809
01:07:35,571 --> 01:07:37,564
And the team needs Clark.

810
01:07:37,812 --> 01:07:39,371
And what does Clark need?

811
01:07:40,732 --> 01:07:42,451
Maybe he's at peace.

812
01:07:43,372 --> 01:07:44,806
He'll get over it.

813
01:07:55,493 --> 01:07:58,771
You know, I could do this
a lot faster. I just...

814
01:07:58,934 --> 01:08:00,534
Is it weird that it feels disrespectful?

815
01:08:01,054 --> 01:08:02,249
Yep.

816
01:08:03,694 --> 01:08:05,731
Do... Do you feel a sense of confidence

817
01:08:05,894 --> 01:08:09,854
that we're not doing something
horribly wrong and macabre here?

818
01:08:10,455 --> 01:08:11,491
Not really.

819
01:08:12,055 --> 01:08:14,615
- Okay, then why...
- Because I saw Steppenwolf up close.

820
01:08:14,855 --> 01:08:18,531
The stories Diana told us.
I believe them.

821
01:08:19,335 --> 01:08:20,928
But we gotta stop him.

822
01:08:21,095 --> 01:08:22,371
That's the plan.

823
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:24,691
That's the plan.

824
01:08:27,976 --> 01:08:30,013
Okay. We're not ready for...

825
01:08:30,176 --> 01:08:32,247
...racially charged...

826
01:08:34,417 --> 01:08:35,976
You got struck by lightning, huh?

827
01:08:36,577 --> 01:08:39,376
Uh, yeah, that's the abridged version.

828
01:08:39,537 --> 01:08:41,688
- And you...
- Explosion.

829
01:08:41,857 --> 01:08:43,052
Woke up in a lab.

830
01:08:43,297 --> 01:08:44,652
So we're the accidents.

831
01:08:46,258 --> 01:08:47,533
Yeah, that's us.

832
01:08:48,418 --> 01:08:50,853
Hey. No, no.

833
01:09:03,019 --> 01:09:05,011
<i>We're approaching
the Kryptonian ship.</i>

834
01:09:05,179 --> 01:09:06,898
<i>ETA 30 seconds.</i>

835
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,299
I'm here for him.

836
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:17,611
- I swear I would never...
- Save it.

837
01:09:38,502 --> 01:09:40,095
- Okay.
- Okay.

838
01:09:40,822 --> 01:09:41,822
Okay.

839
01:10:03,024 --> 01:10:04,663
This is amazing.

840
01:10:05,825 --> 01:10:07,100
This is crazy.

841
01:10:07,305 --> 01:10:09,137
Oh, what, now it's crazy?

842
01:10:09,785 --> 01:10:12,061
You lunatics better know
what you're doing.

843
01:11:01,629 --> 01:11:03,986
<i>Welcome.</i>

844
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:07,988
Lex Luthor fried the circuits
bringing his creature to life.

845
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:10,182
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

846
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,063
I might be able to do it.

847
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:15,047
<i>I might be able to jump-start it.</i>

848
01:11:15,071 --> 01:11:16,207
If I can get enough distance,

849
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:18,071
I can conduct
a significant electrical current.

850
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:19,989
I might be able to wake the box.

851
01:11:21,471 --> 01:11:23,906
- If that's still what we want.
- We have to try.

852
01:11:28,872 --> 01:11:30,511
This must be the end of the line.

853
01:11:30,672 --> 01:11:31,947
<i>So, I'm in position.</i>

854
01:11:35,552 --> 01:11:36,622
<i>The Mother Box is ready.</i>

855
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:39,223
<i>You have to charge it
the moment it touches the fluid.</i>

856
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:41,233
- Five.
- Five.

857
01:11:41,433 --> 01:11:44,028
Diana's right. This is a bad idea.

858
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,147
- Four.
- Four.

859
01:11:47,793 --> 01:11:49,547
<i>- Three.
- Three.</i>

860
01:11:49,754 --> 01:11:51,029
Two.

861
01:11:51,834 --> 01:11:53,188
Two.

862
01:11:53,874 --> 01:11:54,874
<i>One.</i>

863
01:13:39,803 --> 01:13:41,237
He's back.

864
01:13:56,085 --> 01:13:58,554
<i>Dispatch, this is 3-Adam-1-6.
Backing up Code Three.</i>

865
01:13:58,765 --> 01:13:59,965
<i>I'm currently two minutes out.</i>

866
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:04,565
He's not all right.

867
01:14:05,405 --> 01:14:06,442
<i>Copy that.</i>

868
01:14:08,566 --> 01:14:09,841
He's scanning us.

869
01:14:10,006 --> 01:14:11,006
What?

870
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:13,246
Arthur, you need to relax.
Your adrenaline's spiking.

871
01:14:13,286 --> 01:14:14,481
Because he's not all right.

872
01:14:14,646 --> 01:14:15,646
Oh, no.

873
01:14:15,766 --> 01:14:18,566
Should we bow? Or show our bellies?

874
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,206
Victor? Victor!

875
01:14:23,847 --> 01:14:25,247
- Shit!
- What are you doing?

876
01:14:25,367 --> 01:14:27,438
- It's my armor's defense system.
- No!

877
01:14:27,527 --> 01:14:29,679
It's stronger since the interface.
I can't control it.

878
01:14:29,808 --> 01:14:31,037
- Victor, no!
- Victor!

879
01:14:31,168 --> 01:14:32,966
<i>Just think
happy thoughts, Victor.</i>

880
01:14:33,048 --> 01:14:34,482
<i>Go to a happier place.</i>

881
01:14:46,129 --> 01:14:47,129
Kal-El, no!

882
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:57,726
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.

883
01:14:58,530 --> 01:14:59,530
<i>Pet Sematary.</i>

884
01:15:05,531 --> 01:15:07,807
Arthur, we need to restrain him.

885
01:15:12,731 --> 01:15:13,960
<i>I got him.</i>

886
01:15:31,973 --> 01:15:35,205
Kal-El, the last son of Krypton.

887
01:15:36,733 --> 01:15:38,851
Remember who you are.

888
01:15:40,574 --> 01:15:42,327
Tell me who you...

889
01:16:39,379 --> 01:16:40,379
<i>Clark.</i>

890
01:16:45,019 --> 01:16:46,339
I know you.

891
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,858
Please don't make me do this.

892
01:17:16,022 --> 01:17:18,014
Alfred, I need the big gun...

893
01:17:23,423 --> 01:17:25,176
You did this.

894
01:17:25,343 --> 01:17:26,697
I had to.

895
01:17:27,303 --> 01:17:29,101
You won't let me live.

896
01:17:30,143 --> 01:17:32,021
You won't let me die.

897
01:17:32,183 --> 01:17:34,141
The world needs you.

898
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,702
But does it need you?

899
01:17:42,304 --> 01:17:43,374
Tell me.

900
01:17:45,865 --> 01:17:47,345
Do you bleed?

901
01:17:49,345 --> 01:17:50,381
<i>Clark?</i>

902
01:17:59,186 --> 01:18:00,256
Clark.

903
01:18:01,906 --> 01:18:02,976
Please.

904
01:18:22,228 --> 01:18:23,228
Please.

905
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:31,745
Please.

906
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:33,825
Just go.

907
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:35,745
Yeah.

908
01:18:36,989 --> 01:18:38,025
Let's go.

909
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:53,021
Yeah, something is definitely bleeding.

910
01:19:13,192 --> 01:19:14,342
The Mother Box.

911
01:19:16,233 --> 01:19:17,713
<i>He has the last one.</i>

912
01:19:32,714 --> 01:19:34,194
You brought us here.

913
01:19:35,634 --> 01:19:36,750
You remembered.

914
01:19:39,835 --> 01:19:41,030
This is home.

915
01:19:43,595 --> 01:19:44,745
You smell good.

916
01:19:48,795 --> 01:19:50,070
Did I not before?

917
01:20:05,877 --> 01:20:06,877
Don't do that.

918
01:20:07,437 --> 01:20:09,030
<i>We just got our asses
handed to us.</i>

919
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:11,115
And Steppenwolf has got the third box.

920
01:20:11,277 --> 01:20:12,996
<i>So we find them.</i>

921
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:15,356
If the boxes are even close
to each other,

922
01:20:15,518 --> 01:20:18,590
there is going to be
some kind of energy surge.

923
01:20:18,758 --> 01:20:19,934
Steppenwolf's gonna
be keeping them

924
01:20:19,958 --> 01:20:21,174
somewhere where they don't read.

925
01:20:21,198 --> 01:20:22,917
No Internet, no satellite coverage.

926
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:25,236
<i>- Well, that narrows it down.
- Not enough.</i>

927
01:20:26,079 --> 01:20:27,149
So, you can't find them.

928
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:29,073
Or maybe you don't want to.

929
01:20:32,439 --> 01:20:33,589
Arthur.

930
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:35,335
Yeah, that was a great way
to get rid of Superman.

931
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:37,556
Man, I'm not doing this on purpose.

932
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,512
Right. 'Cause you can't control
the machine.

933
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,999
Uh, so, is this a bad time
to bring up my blood sugar?

934
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,596
Very hungry.

935
01:20:49,641 --> 01:20:50,961
Victor.

936
01:20:51,561 --> 01:20:54,554
You can find the boxes.
You share their energy.

937
01:20:55,321 --> 01:20:57,517
I know it's frightening,
but if you go under,

938
01:20:57,681 --> 01:21:00,322
I promise, we will pull you back out.

939
01:21:03,802 --> 01:21:06,601
Just keep the little merman away from me
while I work.

940
01:21:10,242 --> 01:21:12,155
Barry, go find Alfred in the pantry.

941
01:21:12,403 --> 01:21:15,919
When you come back, get online.
Everybody checks everybody else's work.

942
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:18,278
Listen.

943
01:21:18,363 --> 01:21:22,198
I was wondering if you could
put out a, you know, a feeler.

944
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:25,400
Like, aquatic. You know.

945
01:21:26,644 --> 01:21:28,795
I don't know... Do you talk to fish?

946
01:21:30,444 --> 01:21:33,039
The water does the talking.

947
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:35,119
Of course.

948
01:21:35,245 --> 01:21:37,714
If the current comes in strange,
it might point the way.

949
01:21:37,845 --> 01:21:38,961
Okay.

950
01:22:02,727 --> 01:22:03,727
<i>Wait.</i>

951
01:22:04,527 --> 01:22:05,677
Let me.

952
01:22:06,647 --> 01:22:08,401
It's just a little out of place.

953
01:22:10,928 --> 01:22:14,160
So, Clark seemed to share
your view on being woken up.

954
01:22:14,248 --> 01:22:15,648
He could've killed you.

955
01:22:16,288 --> 01:22:18,120
I was willing to make the trade.

956
01:22:20,049 --> 01:22:22,166
And bringing in Lois Lane?

957
01:22:22,249 --> 01:22:24,400
Remember what you told me
about heart in the hangar?

958
01:22:24,489 --> 01:22:25,718
I bet you...

959
01:22:25,809 --> 01:22:27,402
...thought I wasn't listening.

960
01:22:28,329 --> 01:22:29,558
Thank you.

961
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:35,400
You know you can't do this forever.

962
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:36,686
I can barely do it now.

963
01:22:37,650 --> 01:22:38,845
Steppenwolf.

964
01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:40,600
This is the job.

965
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:41,806
<i>It's my job.</i>

966
01:22:43,011 --> 01:22:45,526
And I haven't been doing it.
I've been reacting.

967
01:22:46,571 --> 01:22:47,925
Not leading.

968
01:22:50,611 --> 01:22:52,371
You know, what you said
about Steve Trevor...

969
01:22:52,451 --> 01:22:54,170
It wasn't my business. I'm sorry.

970
01:22:56,212 --> 01:22:58,647
You were pushing me to lead the team,

971
01:22:59,532 --> 01:23:01,012
but leaders get people killed.

972
01:23:02,732 --> 01:23:04,803
I fought always

973
01:23:05,973 --> 01:23:07,168
when I was needed.

974
01:23:08,333 --> 01:23:12,247
But to lead, to step into the light
and to say to people,

975
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:13,972
"This is worth your life."

976
01:23:16,133 --> 01:23:17,568
When it's your fault...

977
01:23:19,974 --> 01:23:21,727
They're all Steve Trevor.

978
01:23:24,414 --> 01:23:27,805
We make it through tonight,
you can stay in the shadows forever.

979
01:23:29,575 --> 01:23:31,055
Dress up like a bat.

980
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:32,251
<i>I won't even sue.</i>

981
01:23:33,455 --> 01:23:35,845
If we get through the night.

982
01:23:56,617 --> 01:23:57,937
Are you okay?

983
01:24:00,337 --> 01:24:03,216
You brought us here, but you've
hardly spent a minute in the house.

984
01:24:03,698 --> 01:24:05,257
I know. It's...

985
01:24:07,938 --> 01:24:09,736
I just got out of a wooden box.

986
01:24:12,458 --> 01:24:13,858
What was it like?

987
01:24:15,579 --> 01:24:16,729
Coming back?

988
01:24:20,979 --> 01:24:21,979
Itchy.

989
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:25,259
<i>I mean, honestly,</i>

990
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:28,491
weird in so many ways.

991
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:31,254
<i>But mostlyjust...</i>

992
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:33,013
I wasn't strong.

993
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:37,734
<i>I didn't, um...</i>

994
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:40,733
You would've been
very disappointed in me.

995
01:24:40,941 --> 01:24:46,335
I wasn't Lois Lane,
the dedicated reporter. I just...

996
01:24:47,701 --> 01:24:48,896
It's okay.

997
01:24:51,822 --> 01:24:53,381
I'm the idiot who left.

998
01:24:54,662 --> 01:24:56,301
But I'm back now.

999
01:24:56,902 --> 01:24:58,700
And I'm gonna make things right.

1000
01:25:17,664 --> 01:25:18,814
Ah.

1001
01:25:19,584 --> 01:25:20,984
You called Mom.

1002
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,374
Of course.

1003
01:25:23,544 --> 01:25:24,695
Thank you.

1004
01:25:27,425 --> 01:25:31,339
I was hoping it was gonna take you
longer to recover.

1005
01:25:32,665 --> 01:25:33,665
Why?

1006
01:25:34,865 --> 01:25:38,018
Because now I have to send you away.

1007
01:25:39,746 --> 01:25:41,226
Bruce.

1008
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,059
He needs you.

1009
01:25:43,266 --> 01:25:46,304
Fate of the world, I think that's
the deal. He was pretty tense.

1010
01:25:46,987 --> 01:25:49,946
Well, I guess I do owe him one.

1011
01:25:50,027 --> 01:25:51,143
Right.

1012
01:25:52,467 --> 01:25:53,821
But no dying.

1013
01:25:54,987 --> 01:25:56,501
And I get the exclusive.

1014
01:25:57,187 --> 01:25:58,907
Yes, ma'am.

1015
01:26:35,071 --> 01:26:36,300
Are you really you?

1016
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:37,984
I'm really me, Ma.

1017
01:26:38,751 --> 01:26:39,867
Oh!

1018
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:51,226
At last.

1019
01:26:53,352 --> 01:26:55,709
Praise to the unity!

1020
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:00,430
<i>The three as one!</i>

1021
01:27:28,075 --> 01:27:31,308
Praise to the mother of horrors.

1022
01:27:41,036 --> 01:27:42,312
Is Steppenwolf there?

1023
01:27:42,477 --> 01:27:44,196
Just a minute.

1024
01:27:45,117 --> 01:27:46,187
Sorry.

1025
01:27:46,757 --> 01:27:48,589
It's Pozharnov in northern Russia.

1026
01:27:48,837 --> 01:27:50,112
The nuclear plant.

1027
01:27:50,277 --> 01:27:52,030
Had a meltdown 30 years ago.

1028
01:27:52,237 --> 01:27:53,974
Uh-huh. There have been some attempts
to resettle nearby.

1029
01:27:53,998 --> 01:27:56,558
But it looks like really rough sledding.

1030
01:27:57,278 --> 01:27:59,918
Who picks this place to put down roots?

1031
01:28:00,118 --> 01:28:02,094
People that have been kicked out
of everywhere else.

1032
01:28:02,118 --> 01:28:05,476
<i>The Earth starts changing,
it will hit them first.</i>

1033
01:28:05,719 --> 01:28:08,109
- How long have we got?
- A few hours.

1034
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:10,392
Transport won't fly that fast.

1035
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:13,238
It will for me.

1036
01:28:54,403 --> 01:28:57,475
The unity brings all three boxes
together in perfect sync.

1037
01:28:59,003 --> 01:29:01,234
Its power builds
until it can't be contained.

1038
01:29:02,364 --> 01:29:05,596
But if I can cause a delay between
each box, even for a nanosecond,

1039
01:29:05,764 --> 01:29:08,233
its energy will cascade, form a loop.

1040
01:29:08,404 --> 01:29:10,077
They'll feed on each other.

1041
01:29:10,204 --> 01:29:11,724
And that's it?
We just pull them apart?

1042
01:29:11,764 --> 01:29:13,484
<i>No fuss, no muss.</i>

1043
01:29:13,645 --> 01:29:16,080
Separating the boxes
is still gonna cause a massive surge.

1044
01:29:16,205 --> 01:29:17,400
I'll have to be there.

1045
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:19,443
<i>But you guys should think about
getting clear.</i>

1046
01:29:19,525 --> 01:29:20,879
We're with you till it's done.

1047
01:29:20,965 --> 01:29:23,246
Honestly, I think we're all
gonna be dead way before that.

1048
01:29:23,765 --> 01:29:24,802
<i>And you know what?</i>

1049
01:29:24,966 --> 01:29:27,561
I don't mind. It's an honorable end.

1050
01:29:28,566 --> 01:29:30,523
But we gotta shut Steppenwolf down.

1051
01:29:31,406 --> 01:29:32,886
Superman's a no-show.

1052
01:29:32,966 --> 01:29:34,923
You got no powers. No offense.

1053
01:29:35,006 --> 01:29:37,761
<i>This guy might be working for the enemy,
we don't know.</i>

1054
01:29:37,927 --> 01:29:39,884
You're tripping over your feet and mine.

1055
01:29:40,847 --> 01:29:41,997
Oof...

1056
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:43,163
You're gorgeous.

1057
01:29:43,327 --> 01:29:46,126
<i>And fierce, and strong, and... Mmm.</i>

1058
01:29:46,207 --> 01:29:48,704
I know we went to war with the Amazons,
but that was before my time.

1059
01:29:48,728 --> 01:29:51,197
And you know what? I don't wanna die.

1060
01:29:51,488 --> 01:29:53,400
I'm young.
There's shit that I want to do.

1061
01:29:54,368 --> 01:29:57,805
<i>I just feel like I didn't really
embrace the sea or the land.</i>

1062
01:29:57,968 --> 01:29:59,369
I've been a loner my whole life.

1063
01:29:59,449 --> 01:30:02,362
But being part of something
bigger like this...

1064
01:30:03,969 --> 01:30:07,041
Maybe I'm scared because I'm meant to...

1065
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:20,690
I think that was beautiful.

1066
01:30:24,171 --> 01:30:25,810
You say a word about this

1067
01:30:25,971 --> 01:30:27,610
and you'll meet every piranha I know.

1068
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:33,568
I honestly didn't hear anything after,
"We're all gonna die."

1069
01:30:53,773 --> 01:30:57,768
Ah. Let them come.

1070
01:31:04,774 --> 01:31:07,334
I'm going to take out that tower
and knock down that shield dome.

1071
01:31:07,934 --> 01:31:09,210
<i>You get to Steppenwolf.</i>

1072
01:31:09,375 --> 01:31:11,571
Don't wait for me, just do the job.

1073
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,692
All right, Alfred.
Are we set for broadcast?

1074
01:32:17,901 --> 01:32:20,860
Playing all your favorite hits.

1075
01:32:30,622 --> 01:32:33,296
Come on. Follow me, you damn insects.

1076
01:32:44,143 --> 01:32:45,497
They're coming.

1077
01:32:47,183 --> 01:32:48,776
They're all coming.

1078
01:32:51,864 --> 01:32:52,900
<i>Ah.</i>

1079
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:55,499
We might not have thought this through.

1080
01:32:59,224 --> 01:33:00,624
He's clearing the field.

1081
01:33:01,264 --> 01:33:02,384
He won't last three minutes.

1082
01:33:02,985 --> 01:33:04,101
Then let's use them.

1083
01:33:07,865 --> 01:33:09,060
On my lead.

1084
01:34:22,111 --> 01:34:23,147
<i>Critical damage.</i>

1085
01:34:24,752 --> 01:34:26,664
Son of a bitch.

1086
01:34:29,832 --> 01:34:31,312
Oh, snap!

1087
01:34:34,953 --> 01:34:35,953
You're welcome.

1088
01:34:39,233 --> 01:34:40,233
Yeah!

1089
01:34:40,393 --> 01:34:41,713
This isn't the plan.

1090
01:34:41,793 --> 01:34:43,147
<i>No, Master Wayne.</i>

1091
01:34:43,793 --> 01:34:45,591
This is the team.

1092
01:34:45,713 --> 01:34:47,228
Hey, blame the lady.

1093
01:34:47,394 --> 01:34:49,465
We would've left you,
but she didn't ask for a vote.

1094
01:34:52,834 --> 01:34:55,110
<i>So, your genius move is dying?</i>

1095
01:34:55,314 --> 01:34:56,907
You really are out of your mind.

1096
01:34:57,114 --> 01:34:59,107
I'm not the one who brought a pitchfork.

1097
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:02,992
Yahoo!

1098
01:35:22,317 --> 01:35:23,512
Ride ain't over yet.

1099
01:35:23,677 --> 01:35:24,827
My man.

1100
01:36:10,401 --> 01:36:12,313
<i>Is this what conquering is?</i>

1101
01:36:12,481 --> 01:36:14,393
Hiding from the fight?

1102
01:36:14,601 --> 01:36:15,955
Oh, no.

1103
01:36:17,041 --> 01:36:18,556
You're all mine.

1104
01:36:24,842 --> 01:36:26,482
- Thanks for the lift.
- Yeah, no problem.

1105
01:36:26,562 --> 01:36:28,633
- You got this?
- Whoa!

1106
01:36:29,602 --> 01:36:30,859
These things are gonna keep coming.

1107
01:36:30,883 --> 01:36:32,795
Okay. You get technical,
I'm on bug duty.

1108
01:36:32,963 --> 01:36:33,999
Let's do it.

1109
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:41,957
Yes! That was gross! Oh...

1110
01:37:01,965 --> 01:37:03,319
Thank you.

1111
01:37:04,886 --> 01:37:06,036
This is...

1112
01:37:07,926 --> 01:37:09,246
This is a lot.

1113
01:37:29,368 --> 01:37:31,883
Now do you see it?

1114
01:37:51,930 --> 01:37:53,210
<i>Whatever
you're in the middle of,</i>

1115
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:54,804
<i>it's spreading for miles.</i>

1116
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:57,724
Satellites show civilians moving east.

1117
01:37:58,330 --> 01:37:59,764
They're not gonna make it.

1118
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:00,966
Barry.

1119
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:03,203
<i>I need you to take a walk.</i>

1120
01:38:09,691 --> 01:38:11,523
God, I hope this is east.

1121
01:38:57,255 --> 01:39:00,647
You're not worthy to touch Mother.

1122
01:39:01,416 --> 01:39:02,770
She's power,

1123
01:39:02,936 --> 01:39:06,407
and power is the only law.

1124
01:39:12,257 --> 01:39:15,056
You're all too weak to see the truth.

1125
01:39:15,137 --> 01:39:16,137
<i>Well,</i>

1126
01:39:18,537 --> 01:39:20,017
<i>I believe in truth.</i>

1127
01:39:21,417 --> 01:39:23,887
But I'm also a big fan of justice.

1128
01:39:31,938 --> 01:39:32,974
All right.

1129
01:39:37,299 --> 01:39:38,938
Kryptonian!

1130
01:39:56,461 --> 01:39:57,497
So, how do I help?

1131
01:39:57,661 --> 01:39:58,777
We buy him some time,

1132
01:39:58,981 --> 01:40:01,141
he can stop that box
from destroying all life on Earth.

1133
01:40:02,581 --> 01:40:03,581
We hope.

1134
01:40:03,741 --> 01:40:06,336
Well, I knew you didn't bring me back
'cause you liked me.

1135
01:40:06,901 --> 01:40:09,212
I don't not...

1136
01:40:15,262 --> 01:40:16,616
- Civilians.
- Barry's headed...

1137
01:40:16,782 --> 01:40:18,011
There's too many of them.

1138
01:40:26,943 --> 01:40:27,943
Come on.

1139
01:40:41,824 --> 01:40:44,499
Okay, this is definitely east.

1140
01:40:51,105 --> 01:40:52,105
Slowpoke.

1141
01:40:52,705 --> 01:40:54,106
Oh, it's on.

1142
01:40:54,346 --> 01:40:55,626
I'll take the ones on the right.

1143
01:40:58,346 --> 01:40:59,382
It's okay. Uh...

1144
01:41:00,426 --> 01:41:02,224
Hold on. Hold on. Yeah.

1145
01:41:20,428 --> 01:41:21,623
Dostoevsky!

1146
01:41:38,989 --> 01:41:41,266
Is this guy still bothering you?

1147
01:41:55,031 --> 01:41:56,101
Superman!

1148
01:41:56,271 --> 01:41:57,830
<i>We gotta pull these things apart.</i>

1149
01:41:57,991 --> 01:42:00,460
A couple more seconds,
you'll see your opening.

1150
01:42:01,231 --> 01:42:02,301
Any blowback?

1151
01:42:02,511 --> 01:42:03,662
Big time.

1152
01:42:03,832 --> 01:42:05,266
But I think we can take it.

1153
01:42:05,472 --> 01:42:06,472
Good.

1154
01:42:07,352 --> 01:42:09,309
'Cause I really like being alive.

1155
01:42:09,832 --> 01:42:11,471
So do I.

1156
01:42:34,554 --> 01:42:35,908
Clark.

1157
01:42:41,475 --> 01:42:43,706
I take it back.

1158
01:42:43,875 --> 01:42:45,275
I wanna die.

1159
01:42:49,236 --> 01:42:52,035
<i>Man, my toes hurt!</i>

1160
01:42:52,116 --> 01:42:55,075
I don't even understand the physics
of how my toes hurt.

1161
01:42:56,876 --> 01:42:59,516
Children. I work with children.

1162
01:43:02,597 --> 01:43:05,476
Uh... Have you guys seen
what's going on outside?

1163
01:43:14,878 --> 01:43:18,508
I am the end of worlds!

1164
01:43:19,278 --> 01:43:23,512
Who are you to defy me?

1165
01:43:24,559 --> 01:43:27,597
This world is my right!

1166
01:43:49,041 --> 01:43:50,634
No!

1167
01:43:50,841 --> 01:43:52,355
This cannot be.

1168
01:43:52,561 --> 01:43:54,200
You recognize that smell?

1169
01:43:56,081 --> 01:43:57,117
Fear.

1170
01:44:00,722 --> 01:44:02,634
No! Leave me!

1171
01:44:06,122 --> 01:44:08,318
Get off me! I command you.

1172
01:44:10,803 --> 01:44:12,362
<i>No!</i>

1173
01:44:12,843 --> 01:44:14,880
No!

1174
01:44:17,083 --> 01:44:18,802
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

1175
01:44:18,963 --> 01:44:20,557
I'll kill you all!

1176
01:44:45,966 --> 01:44:47,241
Booyah!

1177
01:45:12,568 --> 01:45:14,127
I'm glad I didn't miss this.

1178
01:45:15,488 --> 01:45:16,683
So am I.

1179
01:45:17,368 --> 01:45:18,369
Yeah.

1180
01:45:18,569 --> 01:45:19,969
Now she's glad.

1181
01:45:50,731 --> 01:45:53,645
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

1182
01:45:54,252 --> 01:45:57,165
I just undid a mistake, that's all.

1183
01:46:06,253 --> 01:46:08,245
How did you get the house back
from the bank?

1184
01:46:09,373 --> 01:46:10,773
I bought the bank.

1185
01:46:13,133 --> 01:46:14,408
The whole bank?

1186
01:46:14,573 --> 01:46:17,214
It's like a reflex with me.
I don't know.

1187
01:46:20,614 --> 01:46:21,614
What?

1188
01:46:22,214 --> 01:46:25,048
It's actually the worst job you can get
in a crime lab.

1189
01:46:25,254 --> 01:46:27,724
But, uh, my foot's in the door.

1190
01:46:28,175 --> 01:46:30,610
Yeah, I got a recommendation
from a friend.

1191
01:46:30,775 --> 01:46:32,334
This is like a "job" job?

1192
01:46:33,135 --> 01:46:34,171
"Job" job.

1193
01:46:38,095 --> 01:46:39,496
Look at you go.

1194
01:46:57,737 --> 01:47:02,893
<i>Darkness, the truest darkness,
is not the absence of light.</i>

1195
01:47:04,898 --> 01:47:08,494
<i>It is the conviction
that the light will never return.</i>

1196
01:47:08,658 --> 01:47:10,889
Must be 100, 150 feet.

1197
01:47:11,498 --> 01:47:12,614
Must be.

1198
01:47:14,059 --> 01:47:15,698
Big round table.

1199
01:47:15,859 --> 01:47:18,090
Six chairs, right there.

1200
01:47:19,139 --> 01:47:20,653
But room for more.

1201
01:47:23,259 --> 01:47:24,535
But room for more.

1202
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:28,855
<i>But the light always returns</i>

1203
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:30,898
<i>to show us things familiar.</i>

1204
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:35,094
<i>Home, family,</i>

1205
01:47:36,901 --> 01:47:41,657
<i>and things entirely new,
or long overlooked.</i>

1206
01:47:46,941 --> 01:47:51,653
<i>It shows us new possibilities
and challenges us to pursue them.</i>

1207
01:47:53,262 --> 01:47:55,060
Yeah, and Jerry Monasco
runs the whole kit.

1208
01:47:55,222 --> 01:47:57,134
I mean, he did the Bilbao job
two years ago.

1209
01:47:57,302 --> 01:47:59,022
Yeah, he has it all in storage
in Croydon.

1210
01:47:59,183 --> 01:48:00,936
- The Belgian?
- Right, yeah, the Belgian.

1211
01:48:01,103 --> 01:48:04,221
<i>This time,
the light shone on the heroes</i>

1212
01:48:04,383 --> 01:48:08,013
<i>coming out of the shadows
to tell us we won't be alone again.</i>

1213
01:48:10,344 --> 01:48:14,816
<i>Our darkness was deep
and seemed to swallow all hope.</i>

1214
01:48:15,544 --> 01:48:18,343
<i>But these heroes
were here the whole time</i>

1215
01:48:19,184 --> 01:48:24,305
<i>to remind us that hope is real,
that you can see it.</i>

1216
01:48:28,865 --> 01:48:31,221
<i>All you have to do is look,</i>

1217
01:48:33,786 --> 01:48:35,061
<i>up in the sky.</i>

1218
01:49:33,631 --> 01:49:35,862
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

1219
01:49:36,671 --> 01:49:37,991
Not at all, Barry.

1220
01:49:38,751 --> 01:49:39,751
Curious myself.

1221
01:49:39,911 --> 01:49:41,791
Yeah, and it's not
like a competition, you know?

1222
01:49:41,911 --> 01:49:44,063
Well, it is a competition.

1223
01:49:44,232 --> 01:49:47,066
But, you know, it's not like
a macho, uh, measuring thing.

1224
01:49:47,232 --> 01:49:48,666
But if I win, you're off the team.

1225
01:49:54,953 --> 01:49:55,989
- No...
- Oof.

1226
01:49:57,753 --> 01:49:59,267
If I win...

1227
01:49:59,633 --> 01:50:02,387
Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to brunch.

1228
01:50:02,593 --> 01:50:04,949
Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

1229
01:50:05,554 --> 01:50:07,068
I feel stung by that.

1230
01:50:08,874 --> 01:50:10,370
Okay, but if I win,
I get to tell everyone.

1231
01:50:10,394 --> 01:50:11,394
Deal.

1232
01:50:12,314 --> 01:50:13,314
Which coast?

1233
01:50:14,154 --> 01:50:15,986
Uh, you know,
I've never seen the Pacific.

1234
01:50:17,435 --> 01:50:18,585
Which is that way.

1235
01:50:18,795 --> 01:50:21,708
Because the sun, and it's...

1236
01:58:07,876 --> 01:58:09,156
All right, let's keep it moving.

1237
01:58:09,196 --> 01:58:11,267
<i>Come on, Luthor. Let's go.</i>

1238
01:58:12,556 --> 01:58:13,556
<i>Luthor!</i>

1239
01:58:22,877 --> 01:58:26,188
All right, stop jerking around, Luthor,
or I'm gonna have to come in there.

1240
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,231
Ah! There he is. Welcome aboard.

1241
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:03,153
Care for a glass of Goût de Diamants?

1242
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:07,561
I was just celebrating God's return out
of the ground and back up into the sky.

1243
01:59:08,281 --> 01:59:11,479
He and his odd little friends
are forming some sort of league.

1244
01:59:11,601 --> 01:59:12,921
You better not
be wasting my time.

1245
01:59:13,121 --> 01:59:16,911
No. I have too much to live for
