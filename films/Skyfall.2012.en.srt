1
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,922
Ronson's down.

2
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:29,590
He needs medical evac.

3
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:31,425
Where is it? Is it there?

4
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:32,510
Hard drive's gone.

5
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,512
Are you sure?

6
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,475
It's gone. Give me a minute.

7
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,519
They must have it. Get after them.

8
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,525
I'm stabilizing Ronson.

9
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:48,859
We don't have the time.

10
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:50,528
I have to stop the bleeding!

11
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,613
Leave him!

12
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,649
Have you got him?

13
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,609
He's in the black Audi.

14
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,528
What about Ronson?

15
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,696
He's been hit.

16
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,906
We're sending an emergency evacuation squad.

17
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,616
They'll be too bloody late!

18
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,286
He's seen us.

19
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,830
Medical evac for Ronson five minutes away.

20
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:51,172
That's all right. You weren't using it.

21
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,593
I wasn't using that one, either.

22
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,306
Keep your head down.

23
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,467
Just get clear!

24
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,054
Tanner, which way?

25
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,848
Keep going. I can direct you from here.

26
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,516
You both know what's at stake here.

27
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,184
We can't afford to lose that list.

28
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,310
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,467
Where are they now?

30
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,011
They appear to be on the rooftops of the Grand Bazaar.

31
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:32,011
Subtitle www.movieddl.me

32
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:56,273
Take a left. There's a bridge. You can cut him off.

33
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:28,556
Down, sir!

34
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,411
What happened? They're on the train, ma'am.

35
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:51,704
What do you mean on the train?

36
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,080
I mean, they're on top of a train.

37
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,623
Well, get after them, for God's sake!

38
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,530
She's going out of range.

39
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:27,990
We've lost tracking. We're blind here.

40
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,992
What's going on? I'm still with them.

41
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,202
Get me CCTV, satellite, anything!

42
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,504
What was that?

43
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,089
VW Beetles.

44
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:26,757
I think.

45
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,368
Bond! He's uncoupling the cars.

46
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,158
007, are you all right?

47
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,326
Just changing carriages.

48
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,913
What's going on? Report!

49
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,749
It's rather hard to explain, ma'am.

50
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,542
007's still in pursuit.

51
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,150
Looks like there isn't much more road.

52
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,236
I don't think I can go any further.

53
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,272
I may have a shot.

54
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,613
It's not clean.

55
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,365
Repeat, I do not have a clean shot.

56
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,833
There's a tunnel ahead. I'm gonna lose them.

57
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,626
Can you get into a better position?

58
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,336
Negative. There's no time.

59
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,464
Take the shot.

60
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,759
I said take the shot.

61
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,804
I can't! I may hit Bond.

62
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,139
Take the bloody shot!

63
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,872
Agent down.

64
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,755
This is the end

65
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,845
Hold your breath and count to ten

66
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:30,602
Feel the earth move and then

67
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:37,859
Hear my heart burst again

68
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:42,239
For this is the end

69
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:49,287
I've drowned and dreamt this moment

70
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:55,919
So overdue, I owe them

71
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:02,676
Swept away, I'm stolen

72
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,973
Let the sky fall

73
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,851
When it crumbles

74
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,187
We will stand tall

75
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,606
And face it all together

76
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,067
At Skyfall

77
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,658
Skyfall is where we start

78
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:33,123
A thousand miles and poles apart

79
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,713
Where worlds collide and days are dark

80
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,132
You may have my number

81
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,009
You can take my name

82
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:49,723
But you'll never have my heart

83
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,225
Let the sky fall

84
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,145
When it crumbles

85
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,398
We will stand tall

86
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:02,319
And face it all together

87
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,905
Let the sky fall

88
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,991
When it crumbles

89
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,703
We will stand tall

90
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:16,500
And face it all together At Skyfall

91
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,174
Where you go I go

92
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,385
What you see I see

93
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:32,891
I know I'd never be me without the security

94
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:37,229
Of your loving arms

95
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:40,190
keeping me from harm

96
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:45,153
Put your hand in my hand and we'll stand

97
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,116
Let the sky fall

98
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,536
When it crumbles

99
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,205
We will stand tall

100
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:59,668
And face it all together

101
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,878
Let the sky fall

102
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,339
When it crumbles

103
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,717
We will stand tall

104
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,887
And face it all together

105
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,557
At Skyfall

106
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,934
Let the sky fall

107
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:23,316
We will stand tall

108
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,695
At Skyfall

109
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,235
It's like being summoned to the headmaster's study.

110
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,737
It's a new Chairman. Just standard procedure.

111
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,989
Bloody waste of my time is what I call it.

112
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,158
I'm sorry to have to deal with such

113
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,244
a delicate subject at our first encounter.

114
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,331
But, um...

115
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,667
I have to be frank with you.

116
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,835
I think that would be a good idea.

117
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,882
The Prime Minister's concerned.

118
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,511
Well, you can tell him my operatives are pursuing every avenue.

119
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,680
Have you considered pulling out the agents?

120
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,181
I've considered every option.

121
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,600
Forgive me, that sounds like an evasion.

122
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,686
Forgive me, but why am I here?

123
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,774
Three months ago, you lost the computer drive containing the identity

124
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,360
of almost every NATO agent embedded in

125
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,904
terrorist organizations across the globe.

126
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,408
A list which, in the eyes of our allies, never existed.

127
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:40,412
So if you'll forgive me, I think you know why you're here.

128
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,372
Are we to call this "civilian oversight"?

129
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,042
No, we're to call this "retirement planning."

130
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,754
Your country has only the highest respect for you

131
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,881
and your many years of service.

132
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,800
When your current posting is completed,

133
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:57,053
you'll be awarded GCMG with full honors.

134
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,223
Congratulations.

135
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,100
You're firing me.

136
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,644
No, ma'am, I'm here to oversee the transition period

137
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,480
leading to your voluntary retirement in two months' time.

138
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,400
Your successor has yet to be appointed, so we'll be asking you...

139
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,277
I'm not an idiot, Mallory.

140
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,071
I know I can't do this job forever

141
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,365
but I'll be damned if I'm going to leave the department

142
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,492
in worse shape than I found it.

143
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,162
M, you've had a great run.

144
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,289
You should leave with dignity.

145
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:27,584
Oh, to hell with dignity. I'll leave when the job's done.

146
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,812
Yes?

147
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,482
Now?

148
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:56,446
Ma'am, alert from Q-Branch. Someone's trying to decrypt the stolen hard drive.

149
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,948
We're tracing the encryption signal.

150
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:00,617
Localizing now.

151
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,121
Centering in the UK.

152
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,541
London.

153
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,627
Get us back to base as soon as possible.

154
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,135
It's coming from MI6.

155
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,470
What?

156
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,764
The data packet is linking to our network.

157
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,475
Correction. This is behind our firewall.

158
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,102
We should shut down.

159
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,186
No, track it.

160
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,397
We have to know where it's coming from.

161
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,315
Strip the headers. Trace the source.

162
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,359
How the hell did they get into our system?

163
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,319
Getting trace back now.

164
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,492
It appears...

165
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,578
It appears to be your computer, ma'am.

166
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,330
Shut it down.

167
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,504
What is this?

168
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,861
For God's sake!

169
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,406
Just get out of the way!

170
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,033
Don't you recognize the car? Madam.

171
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,638
Oh...!

172
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,353
This is CNN Breaking News.

173
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:00,023
Emergency crews are still attempting to assess

174
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,525
the damage as investigators hunt for leads

175
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,736
in what now appears to be a major

176
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,946
terrorist attack in the heart of London.

177
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:11,784
No-one has yet claimed responsibility for what sources are calling

178
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:16,205
a possible "cyber-terrorist assault" on the British Secret Service.

179
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,583
Early reports from the scene indicate

180
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,918
at least six dead, many more injured,

181
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:24,047
with victims being evacuated to local hospitals

182
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,965
within minutes of the explosion.

183
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,152
It's time to go, ma'am.

184
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,407
I'm going to find whoever did this.

185
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,375
Where the hell have you been?

186
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,128
Enjoying death.

187
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,048
007 reporting for duty.

188
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,015
Why didn't you call?

189
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,476
You didn't get the postcard?

190
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,729
You should try it some time. Get away from it all.

191
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,689
It really lends perspective.

192
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,150
Ran out of drink where you were, did they?

193
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:08,985
What was it you said?

194
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,487
"Take the bloody shot."

195
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,030
I made a judgment call.

196
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,658
You should have trusted me to finish the job.

197
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,660
It was the possibility of losing you

198
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:20,329
or the certainty of losing all those other agents.

199
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,332
I made the only decision I could and you know it.

200
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,668
I think you lost your nerve.

201
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:28,254
What do you expect, a bloody apology?

202
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,047
You know the rules of the game.

203
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:31,591
You've been playing it long enough.

204
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:32,717
We both have.

205
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:34,927
Maybe too long.

206
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,263
Speak for yourself.

207
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:41,851
Ronson didn't make it, did he?

208
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,020
No.

209
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,858
So this is it.

210
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,277
We're both played out.

211
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,405
Well, if you believe that, why did you come back?

212
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,199
Good question.

213
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,786
Because we're under attack.

214
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,790
And you know we need you.

215
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,295
Well, I'm here.

216
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:14,634
You'll have to be debriefed and declared fit for active service.

217
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,553
You can only return to duty when you've passed the tests,

218
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,056
so take them seriously.

219
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,642
And a shower might be in order.

220
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,894
I'll go home and change.

221
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:29,065
Oh, we've sold your flat, put your things into storage.

222
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:33,236
Standard procedure on the death of an unmarried employee

223
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,613
with no next of kin.

224
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,406
You should have called.

225
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,283
I'll find a hotel.

226
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,911
Well, you're bloody well not sleeping here.

227
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:12,441
The assailant hacked into the environmental control system,

228
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,110
locked out the safety protocols

229
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:17,613
and turned on the gas, all of which should have been impossible.

230
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:20,116
On top of that, they hacked into her files.

231
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:23,536
They knew her appointments, knew she'd be out of the building.

232
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,454
They weren't targeting her.

233
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,040
They wanted her to see it.

234
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,751
Where are we, Tanner?

235
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,169
New digs.

236
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,222
The old building was declared "strategically vulnerable".

237
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,474
That's putting it mildly.

238
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,978
He was able to breach the most secure computer system in Britain.

239
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,855
So we're on war footing now.

240
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,858
This was part of Churchill's bunker.

241
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:55,568
We're still discovering tunnels

242
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:56,986
dating back to the 18th Century.

243
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:59,488
Quite fascinating, if it wasn't for the rats.

244
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,157
When do I see M?

245
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,702
Tomorrow you'll see M and Mallory, too, if you're lucky.

246
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:05,995
Who's Mallory?

247
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:08,831
The new Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee.

248
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:09,999
Charming man. I think you and he

249
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,500
are really going to hit it off.

250
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,755
Welcome to the new MI6.

251
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,899
We've attempted to trace the computer message, but

252
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:38,027
it was sent by an asymmetrical security algorithm,

253
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:39,695
which bounced the signal all over the globe

254
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,781
through over a thousand different servers.

255
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,574
And now that they've accessed M's codes,

256
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,369
it's only a matter of time before they're able to decrypt the list.

257
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,955
Q-Branch have been analyzing the picture but so far nothing.

258
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:52,375
The general feeling is it's probably someone from her past.

259
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,044
Perhaps when she was running things in Hong Kong.

260
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,545
She's no idea what it all means.

261
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:57,797
You believe that?

262
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,966
The truth is, we don't have a clue who took the list

263
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,386
Or what they plan to do with it.

264
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:11,519
We can always do this later.

265
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:15,439
You know what? Let's.

266
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,468
I'd like to start with some simple word associations.

267
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,970
Just tell me the first word that pops into your head.

268
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,514
For example, I might say "Day" and you might say...

269
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,640
Wasted.

270
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:37,229
All right.

271
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:42,943
Gun.

272
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,030
Shot. Agent.

273
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:47,531
Provocateur.

274
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:48,616
Woman.

275
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:49,658
Provocatrix.

276
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:50,868
Heart.

277
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:51,994
Target.

278
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,205
Bird.

279
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,539
Sky.

280
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:56,749
M.

281
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:57,917
Bitch.

282
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:01,420
Sunlight.

283
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:02,671
Swim.

284
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,507
Moonlight. Dance.

285
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:05,841
Murder.

286
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,259
Employment.

287
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,553
Country. England.

288
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,097
Skyfall.

289
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,937
Skyfall.

290
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:22,608
Done.

291
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,866
Well, this is going well.

292
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,499
Get these analyzed.

293
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,085
For her eyes only.

294
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,115
She's ready for you.

295
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,701
I'm sorry, have we met before?

296
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,621
I'm the one who should say "sorry".

297
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,708
It was only four ribs.

298
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,211
Some of the less vital organs.

299
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,422
Nothing major.

300
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,387
Not enough excitement in Istanbul?

301
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,139
I've been reassigned.

302
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,308
Temporary suspension from field work.

303
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,893
Really? Mmm.

304
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,645
Something to do with killing 007.

305
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,772
Well, you gave it your best shot.

306
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,649
That was hardly my best shot.

307
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,068
I'm not sure I could survive your best.

308
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:30,986
I doubt you'll get the chance.

309
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,406
Well, do me a favor, will you? If they do ever let you back out there,

310
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,159
warn me first.

311
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,496
I'm assisting Gareth Mallory in the transition,

312
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:42,498
and then I'll be back in the field.

313
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,333
That's what you want?

314
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,918
Yes, of course.

315
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,670
It's not for everyone.

316
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,089
Ah, 007. It's this way.

317
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:55,594
In your defense, a moving target is much harder to hit.

318
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:59,265
Then you better keep moving.

319
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:11,694
The whole office goes up in smoke

320
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,570
and that bloody thing survives.

321
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:17,574
Your interior decorating tips have always been appreciated, 007.

322
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,911
007, Gareth Mallory.

323
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,454
I hope I haven't missed anything.

324
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,039
The PM does prattle on in a crisis.

325
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,291
Bond.

326
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:26,792
Mallory.

327
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,425
I've just been reviewing Bond's tests.

328
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:38,053
It seems you've passed... by the skin of your teeth.

329
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:40,264
You're back on active service.

330
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,349
Congratulations.

331
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,600
Thank you.

332
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,436
I'll, um...

333
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,645
I'll be outside.

334
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,981
I only have one question.

335
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,567
Why not stay dead?

336
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,280
You have the perfect way out. Go and live quietly somewhere.

337
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:59,658
Not many field agents get to leave this cleanly.

338
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,452
Do you get out in the field much?

339
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:06,165
You don't need to be an operative to see the obvious.

340
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,792
It's a young man's game.

341
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,587
Look, you've been seriously injured.

342
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,006
There's no shame in saying you've lost a step.

343
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,092
The only shame would be not admitting it until it's too late.

344
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,180
Hire me or fire me. It's entirely up to you.

345
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,266
If he says he's ready, he's ready.

346
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,853
Perhaps you can't see it, or maybe you won't.

347
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,646
What exactly are you implying?

348
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,648
You're sentimental about him.

349
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:36,820
As long as I'm head of this department, I'll choose my own operatives.

350
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:40,866
Fair enough.

351
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,039
Good luck, 007.

352
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,875
Don't cock it up.

353
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:58,717
We've analyzed the shrapnel fragments.

354
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:01,095
You're lucky it wasn't a direct hit

355
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,554
or it would have cut you in half.

356
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,974
It's a depleted uranium shell. Military grade.

357
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,019
Hard to get, extremely expensive,

358
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,814
and only used by a select few.

359
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,149
Recognize anyone?

360
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:17,069
Him.

361
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,489
Okay. Name's Patrice.

362
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:23,033
He's a ghost. No known residence or country of origin.

363
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,743
So how do we find him?

364
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:28,080
Well, luckily, we still have one or two friends left in the CIA.

365
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,998
They're after him for the Yemeni ambassador's murder,

366
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:31,875
and they're getting close.

367
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,002
Intel is he's going to be in Shanghai

368
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:35,921
in two days time, probably on a job.

369
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,674
You're to go there and await further instructions.

370
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,759
If he turns up, he's yours.

371
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:44,221
Find out who he works for and who has the list.

372
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,390
Then terminate him, for Ronson.

373
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,016
With pleasure.

374
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,686
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

375
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,480
No.

376
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,359
Report to the new Quartermaster for your documentation.

377
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,903
He hasn't set up shop yet, but Tanner will

378
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,030
put you two together. Good luck.

379
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,283
Thank you.

380
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:08,829
007.

381
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,041
You are ready for this?

382
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,461
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,550
I didn't know Bond passed the tests.

384
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,385
He didn't.

385
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:55,375
Always makes me feel a little melancholy.

386
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:59,296
A grand old warship being ignominiously hauled away for scrap.

387
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:04,885
The inevitability of time, don't you think?

388
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:08,889
What do you see?

389
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:12,518
A bloody big ship.

390
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,853
Excuse me.

391
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:16,605
007...

392
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,192
I'm your new Quartermaster.

393
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:23,612
You must be joking.

394
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,822
Why, because I'm not wearing a lab coat?

395
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,950
Because you still have spots.

396
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:30,786
My complexion is hardly relevant.

397
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,871
Well, your competence is.

398
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,666
Age is no guarantee of efficiency.

399
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:38,544
And youth is no guarantee of innovation.

400
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,671
I'll hazard I can do more damage

401
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:42,339
on my laptop sitting in my pajamas

402
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,049
before my first cup of Earl Grey

403
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,842
than you can do in a year in the field.

404
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:47,553
Oh, so why do you need me?

405
00:39:49,263 --> 00:39:51,223
Every now and then a trigger has to be pulled.

406
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:53,809
Or not pulled.

407
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,062
It's hard to know which in your pajamas.

408
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,651
Q.

409
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,528
007.

410
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:10,284
Ticket to Shanghai.

411
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,618
Documentation and passport.

412
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,953
Thank you.

413
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,204
And this.

414
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,586
Walther PPK/S 9mm short.

415
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,590
There's a micro-dermal sensor in the grip.

416
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:28,260
It's been coded to your palm print so only you can fire it.

417
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,514
Less of a random killing machine, more of a personal statement.

418
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:34,016
And this?

419
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,728
Standard issue radio transmitter.

420
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,732
Activate it and it broadcasts your location.

421
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,650
Distress signal.

422
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,445
And that's it.

423
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,282
A gun...

424
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,451
...and a radio.

425
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,788
Not exactly Christmas, is it?

426
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:00,042
Were you expecting an exploding pen?

427
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,712
We don't really go in for that anymore.

428
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,221
Good luck out there in the field.

429
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:16,808
And please return the equipment in one piece.

430
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:23,732
Brave new world.

431
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,941
Who's got the list?

432
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,198
Tell me! Who are you working for?

433
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:24,332
Tanner... He's posted the first five names.

434
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:27,502
Their cover's blown. They're in danger. Get them out now.

435
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:09,252
Room service.

436
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,722
I didn't order anything. Not even you.

437
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,724
I've got some new information.

438
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:27,478
Aren't you a little overqualified to be delivering messages?

439
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:30,231
It's all part of the learning curve.

440
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:32,650
And Q's afraid of flying.

441
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:34,861
Of course he is.

442
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:38,740
So whoever stole the list has already decrypted it.

443
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,909
They posted the first five names on the web.

444
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:44,287
Well, it was only a matter of time.

445
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:45,872
Well, that's just the start.

446
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,916
They're posting five more next week, and the week after.

447
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:51,711
It's some kind of sadistic game.

448
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,760
Cut-throat razor.

449
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:02,096
How very traditional.

450
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:06,100
Well, I like to do some things the old-fashioned way.

451
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,397
Sometimes the old ways are the best.

452
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:24,619
Are you putting your life in my hands again?

453
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,289
M's...

454
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:31,626
...already briefed me on the list.

455
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,962
Raising the tantalizing question

456
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:37,131
of what you're really doing here.

457
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:40,885
My official directive was to help...

458
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,639
"in any way I can."

459
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,810
Like spying for Mallory.

460
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,481
You know, Mallory's not as bad as you think.

461
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:56,484
He's a bureaucrat.

462
00:53:57,235 --> 00:53:59,278
You should do your homework.

463
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,448
Gareth Mallory was a Lieutenant Colonel...

464
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:05,284
Lieutenant Colonel in Northern Ireland, Hereford Regiment.

465
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,870
Spent three months at the hands of the IRA.

466
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:12,333
So there's more to him than meets the eye.

467
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,337
We'll see.

468
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:19,674
Keep still.

469
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:24,178
This is the tricky part.

470
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,692
Now that's better.

471
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,069
You look the part now.

472
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,196
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

473
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:45,491
And what part's that?

474
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,036
Old dog,

475
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,039
new tricks.

476
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:05,446
Good evening.

477
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:06,989
Evening.

478
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:08,950
Don't touch your ear.

479
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,286
I've got three exits,

480
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:15,122
lots of blind spots.

481
00:56:15,665 --> 00:56:17,291
I've got them covered.

482
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,633
You look beautiful in that dress.

483
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,426
You don't scrub up so bad yourself.

484
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:30,471
It's amazing what one can do with an extra pair of hands.

485
00:56:30,972 --> 00:56:32,640
You're telling me.

486
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,018
Do you gamble?

487
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:37,853
I like a little flutter now and then.

488
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:42,984
Who doesn't like to take chances?

489
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,324
Good evening, sir. How may I help you?

490
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,493
I'd like to cash this in, please.

491
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,501
One moment, sir.

492
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:34,535
Good fortune tonight, sir.

493
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,209
Let's hope so.

494
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:52,887
With compliments of the house.

495
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:54,722
Thank you.

496
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:18,412
Now you can afford to buy me a drink.

497
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,917
Maybe I'll even stretch to two.

498
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:26,587
I'm guessing I've got four million euros in here.

499
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:29,548
Not bad. I like this game.

500
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:31,801
Why don't we play another?

501
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:34,929
I don't gamble.

502
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:39,934
I'm not very lucky.

503
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:42,269
A little like our friend in Shanghai.

504
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,610
I've been waiting to see who would redeem the chip.

505
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:53,489
You made such a bold entrance into our little drama.

506
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:55,908
Did I over-complicate the plot?

507
00:58:57,243 --> 00:59:00,121
Who doesn't appreciate the occasional twist, Mr...?

508
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:02,039
Bond.

509
00:59:02,123 --> 00:59:03,416
James Bond.

510
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,960
Severine.

511
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:10,798
So, Mr. Bond, shall we discuss your next performance over that drink?

512
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:12,967
I'd like that.

513
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,139
Will your friends be joining us?

514
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:22,977
That, I'm afraid, is inevitable.

515
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:27,523
She's pretty.

516
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:28,858
Now, now.

517
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:31,152
If you like that sort of thing.

518
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:33,529
I'll keep you posted.

519
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:46,500
Perfect.

520
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:52,047
Would you mind if I asked you a business question?

521
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,675
Depends on the question.

522
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,887
It has to do with death.

523
00:59:59,472 --> 01:00:02,224
A subject in which you're well-versed.

524
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:04,185
And how would you know that?

525
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:08,397
Only a certain kind of woman wears a backless dress

526
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,734
with a Beretta 70 strapped to her thigh.

527
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:14,945
One can never be too careful when

528
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,865
handsome men in tuxedos carry Walthers.

529
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,245
I am correct in assuming you killed Patrice?

530
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,706
Yes.

531
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,251
Might I ask why?

532
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:32,254
I want to meet your employer.

533
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,061
Be careful what you wish for.

534
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:50,189
You're scared.

535
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,942
Thank you for the drink,

536
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,570
Mr. Bond.

537
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:06,413
You put on a good show.

538
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,543
But ever since we sat down, you haven't stopped

539
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:12,628
looking at your bodyguards.

540
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:16,632
Now, three of them is a bit excessive.

541
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:20,553
They're controlling you. They're not protecting you.

542
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:25,975
The tattoo on your wrist is Macau sex trade.

543
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:30,604
You belonged to one of the houses. What were you? 12? 13?

544
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,316
I'm guessing he was your way out.

545
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,778
Perhaps you thought you were in love.

546
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:41,657
But that was a long time ago.

547
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,120
You know nothing about it.

548
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,790
I know when a woman is afraid and pretending not to be.

549
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:55,170
How much do you know about fear?

550
01:01:56,005 --> 01:01:57,506
All there is.

551
01:01:58,966 --> 01:02:00,634
Not like this.

552
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:04,805
Not like him.

553
01:02:06,265 --> 01:02:07,683
I can help you.

554
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:09,810
I don't think so.

555
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:10,978
Let me try.

556
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:14,815
How?

557
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,651
Bring me to him.

558
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:21,488
Can you kill him?

559
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:22,656
Yes.

560
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:25,326
Will you?

561
01:02:26,035 --> 01:02:27,828
Someone usually dies.

562
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,376
Perhaps you can.

563
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,803
When I leave, they're going to kill you.

564
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:49,808
If you survive, I'm on the Chimera. North harbor.

565
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,394
Berth seven.

566
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,898
We cast off in an hour.

567
01:03:01,362 --> 01:03:03,405
Very nice to have met you, Mr. Bond.

568
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:06,575
Good luck.

569
01:04:32,828 --> 01:04:34,038
Good luck with that.

570
01:04:58,687 --> 01:04:59,813
Thank you.

571
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:06,111
Put it all on red.

572
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:10,657
It's the circle of life.

573
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:35,974
Yes!

574
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,730
It's time to cast off.

575
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:44,858
All right.

576
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:43,250
I like you better without your Beretta.

577
01:06:46,712 --> 01:06:48,589
I feel naked without it.

578
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:06,982
Good evening.

579
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:10,569
The controversy surrounding the Ministry of Defence has escalated today

580
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:14,323
as images of the Husein assassination continue to circulate.

581
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:16,408
We should warn you, some viewers

582
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,285
might find these images disturbing.

583
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:22,956
Captain Husein, an MI6 operative embedded in the Middle East,

584
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,042
was one of the five agents exposed

585
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:26,960
in what is now being considered

586
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:30,631
the greatest internal security breach in modern British history.

587
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:34,801
The Prime Minister continues to express public support for MI6

588
01:07:34,927 --> 01:07:37,012
while the opposition has taken the position...

589
01:07:37,346 --> 01:07:39,806
Has taken the position we're a bunch of antiquated bloody idiots

590
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,976
fighting a war we don't understand and can't possibly win.

591
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:45,229
Look, three of my agents are dead already.

592
01:07:45,354 --> 01:07:47,189
Don't embroil me in politics now.

593
01:07:47,648 --> 01:07:50,651
The Prime Minister's ordered an inquiry. You'll have to appear.

594
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:54,071
Oh, standing in the stocks at midday? Who's antiquated now?

595
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,406
For Christ's sake, listen to yourself. We're a democracy,

596
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,117
accountable to the people we're trying to defend.

597
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:02,329
We can't keep working in the shadows. There are no more shadows.

598
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:04,248
You don't get this, do you?

599
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:08,710
Whoever's behind this, whoever's doing it, he knows us.

600
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:12,089
He's one of us. He comes from the same place as Bond.

601
01:08:12,631 --> 01:08:14,216
The place you say doesn't exist.

602
01:08:15,509 --> 01:08:17,010
The shadows.

603
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:57,175
It's not too late. We could turn back now.

604
01:09:03,724 --> 01:09:05,684
I wouldn't be so sure.

605
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:45,807
They abandoned it almost overnight.

606
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:50,228
He made them think there was a leak at the chemical plant.

607
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:54,941
It's amazing the panic you can cause with a single computer.

608
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:59,946
He wanted the island, so he took it.

609
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:04,117
Does he always get what he wants?

610
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:06,578
More than you know.

611
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:10,957
I'm sorry.

612
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:41,780
Hello, James. Welcome.

613
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,658
Do you like the island?

614
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,538
My grandmother had an island.

615
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:53,208
Nothing to boast of. You could walk around it in an hour.

616
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:56,378
But still, it was, it was a paradise for us.

617
01:10:57,212 --> 01:10:59,506
One summer, we went for a visit

618
01:10:59,673 --> 01:11:03,635
and discovered the place had been infested with rats!

619
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:08,223
They'd come on a fishing boat and gorged themselves on coconut.

620
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:11,059
So how do you get rats off an island? Hmm?

621
01:11:11,852 --> 01:11:13,728
My grandmother showed me.

622
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:17,357
We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid,

623
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:19,734
then wired coconut to the lid as bait.

624
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:21,862
And the rats would come for the coconut and...

625
01:11:23,697 --> 01:11:25,532
...they would fall into the drum.

626
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:29,744
And after a month, you have trapped all the rats.

627
01:11:30,704 --> 01:11:32,414
But what do you do then?

628
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:35,375
Throw the drum into the ocean?

629
01:11:36,251 --> 01:11:38,378
Burn it? No.

630
01:11:38,712 --> 01:11:40,755
You just leave it.

631
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:44,092
And they begin to get hungry.

632
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:46,720
And one by one...

633
01:11:49,014 --> 01:11:50,724
...they start eating each other

634
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:54,227
until there are only two left. The two survivors.

635
01:11:54,895 --> 01:11:57,022
And then what? Do you kill them? No.

636
01:11:57,731 --> 01:12:00,942
You take them and release them into the trees.

637
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:04,112
But now they don't eat coconut anymore.

638
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:06,781
Now they only eat rat.

639
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:10,785
You have changed their nature.

640
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:14,164
The two survivors,

641
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,666
this is what she made us.

642
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:21,463
I made my own choices.

643
01:12:21,755 --> 01:12:23,840
You think you did.

644
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:26,426
That's her genius.

645
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:32,349
Station H. Am I right? Hong Kong.

646
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:33,642
Mm-hmm.

647
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,269
'86 to '97.

648
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:39,231
Back then, I was her favorite.

649
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:42,901
And you're not nearly the agent I was, I can tell you that.

650
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:49,074
Just look at you, barely held together by your pills and your drink.

651
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:50,951
Don't forget my pathetic love of country.

652
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:56,623
You're still clinging to your faith in that old woman.

653
01:12:57,082 --> 01:12:59,459
When all she does is lie to you. She never lied to me.

654
01:12:59,543 --> 01:13:01,169
No? No.

655
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:03,713
What did you score in your marksmanship evaluation?

656
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:05,090
70.

657
01:13:06,508 --> 01:13:07,801
40.

658
01:13:09,803 --> 01:13:12,264
Did she tell you the psychologist cleared you for duty?

659
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:14,683
Yes. No. No.

660
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:27,612
Medical evaluation: Fail. Physical evaluation: Failed.

661
01:13:27,946 --> 01:13:30,115
Psychological evaluation: "Alcohol

662
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,450
"and substance addiction indicated."

663
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,622
"Pathological rejection of authority

664
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:40,166
"based on unresolved childhood trauma."

665
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:48,508
"Subject is not approved for field duty

666
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:51,678
"and immediate suspension from service advised."

667
01:13:52,012 --> 01:13:54,055
What is this if not betrayal?

668
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:58,184
She sent you after me knowing you're not ready, knowing you'll likely die.

669
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:00,854
Mommy was very bad!

670
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:05,400
Hmm?

671
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:23,418
Ooh.

672
01:14:24,711 --> 01:14:26,713
See what she's done to you?

673
01:14:28,048 --> 01:14:30,717
Well, she never tied me to a chair.

674
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:32,510
Her loss.

675
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,558
Are you sure this is about M?

676
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:40,018
It's about her.

677
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:43,229
And you, and me.

678
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:47,233
You see, we are the last two rats.

679
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:49,694
We can either eat each other...

680
01:14:52,864 --> 01:14:53,865
Hmm?

681
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:58,286
...or eat everyone else.

682
01:15:01,081 --> 01:15:04,584
How you're trying to remember your training now.

683
01:15:06,086 --> 01:15:08,546
What's the regulation to cover this?

684
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:15,428
Well, first time for everything. Yes?

685
01:15:18,473 --> 01:15:21,434
What makes you think this is my first time?

686
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:24,729
Oh, Mr. Bond!

687
01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:31,111
All that physical stuff... So dull, so dull.

688
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:35,198
Chasing spies...

689
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:37,367
so old-fashioned!

690
01:15:40,787 --> 01:15:42,622
Your knees must be killing you.

691
01:15:47,419 --> 01:15:48,753
England.

692
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:51,631
The Empire! MI6!

693
01:15:52,173 --> 01:15:54,092
You're living in a ruin as well,

694
01:15:54,384 --> 01:15:55,969
you just don't know it yet.

695
01:15:57,345 --> 01:16:01,808
At least here there are no old ladies giving orders and no little...

696
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:03,893
Bip!

697
01:16:03,977 --> 01:16:06,479
Gadgets from those fools in Q-Branch.

698
01:16:09,524 --> 01:16:14,028
If you wanted, you could pick your own secret missions. As I do.

699
01:16:16,531 --> 01:16:17,782
Name it.

700
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:19,826
Name it.

701
01:16:22,704 --> 01:16:25,582
Destabilize a multinational by manipulating stocks...

702
01:16:25,749 --> 01:16:26,750
Bip. Easy.

703
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:31,171
Interrupt transmissions from a spy satellite over Kabul...

704
01:16:31,463 --> 01:16:32,464
Done.

705
01:16:33,006 --> 01:16:37,135
Hmm. Rig an election in Uganda. All to the highest bidder.

706
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:39,846
Or a gas explosion in London.

707
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,515
Just point and click.

708
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:44,642
Well, everybody needs a hobby.

709
01:16:50,482 --> 01:16:52,317
So what's yours?

710
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:56,529
Resurrection.

711
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:02,160
Let me show you something.

712
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:16,716
Tells a story, doesn't it?

713
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:22,680
They left the island so quickly,

714
01:17:22,806 --> 01:17:24,557
they couldn't decide what to take,

715
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,768
what to leave, what was important.

716
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:31,022
And seeing this every day reminds me to focus on the essentials.

717
01:17:31,231 --> 01:17:34,901
There's nothing...nothing superfluous in my life.

718
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:38,738
When a thing is redundant, it is eliminated.

719
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,084
50-year-old Macallan.

720
01:17:51,626 --> 01:17:54,546
A particular favorite of yours, I understand.

721
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:59,092
So, what's the toast?

722
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,721
"To the women we love"?

723
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:05,265
Hmm.

724
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:15,942
Darling.

725
01:18:16,818 --> 01:18:19,612
Darling, your lovers are here.

726
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:26,619
No, no, no, no.

727
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:29,163
Stand up straight. Keep still.

728
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:32,959
And whatever you do, don't lose your head.

729
01:18:33,126 --> 01:18:34,502
Don't lose...

730
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:36,170
your head.

731
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:40,800
Don't lose your head.

732
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:44,596
Time to redeem your marksmanship scores.

733
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:47,473
Let's see.

734
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:52,478
Who can be the first to knock the glass from her head?

735
01:18:58,526 --> 01:19:01,321
And just to be sporting, I'll let you go first.

736
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:21,841
Let's see who ends up on top.

737
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:36,689
Oh, I can't believe it.

738
01:19:37,023 --> 01:19:40,485
I can't believe it! Did you really die that day?

739
01:19:41,486 --> 01:19:45,323
Is there any, any of the old 007 left?

740
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:55,208
My turn.

741
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:01,714
I win. What do you say to that?

742
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,511
It's a waste of good Scotch.

743
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:21,442
What are you going to do now? Take me back to her? All on your own?

744
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:23,903
Who says I'm on my own?

745
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,258
It's the latest thing from Q-Branch.

746
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:47,760
It's called a radio.

747
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,950
All right, time to say hello.

748
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:45,985
You're smaller than I remember!

749
01:21:47,028 --> 01:21:48,988
Whereas I barely remember you at all.

750
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:52,492
Strange. For me, it feels just like yesterday.

751
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:55,870
Are you surprised?

752
01:21:56,162 --> 01:21:59,415
Not particularly. But then you always were a slippery one.

753
01:21:59,749 --> 01:22:01,876
Maybe that's why you liked me so much.

754
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:03,711
You flatter yourself.

755
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:05,338
No remorse.

756
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:09,884
Just as I had imagined.

757
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,178
Regret is unprofessional.

758
01:22:19,185 --> 01:22:20,520
"Regret is unprofessional."

759
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:25,691
They kept me for five months in a room with no air. They tortured me.

760
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:28,861
And I protected your secrets. I protected you.

761
01:22:30,196 --> 01:22:33,282
But they made me suffer. And suffer.

762
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:36,869
And suffer.

763
01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:39,872
Until I realized...

764
01:22:41,082 --> 01:22:43,376
...it was you who betrayed me.

765
01:22:44,961 --> 01:22:46,379
You betrayed me.

766
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:50,800
So, I had only one thing left.

767
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,222
My cyanide capsule in my back left molar.

768
01:22:56,389 --> 01:22:58,891
You remember, right?

769
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:05,064
So I broke the tooth and...

770
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:07,567
...bit into the capsule.

771
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:09,569
And it...

772
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:15,741
It burned all my insides.

773
01:23:16,242 --> 01:23:17,952
But I didn't die.

774
01:23:21,164 --> 01:23:23,916
Life clung to me like a disease.

775
01:23:28,421 --> 01:23:29,589
And then...

776
01:23:29,797 --> 01:23:33,593
I understood why I had survived.

777
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:39,765
I needed to look in your eyes one last time.

778
01:23:43,311 --> 01:23:44,770
Well, I hope it was worth it.

779
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,776
Mr. Silva, you're going to be transferred to Belmarsh Prison

780
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:53,779
where you'll be remanded in custody

781
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:55,615
until the Crown Prosecution Service

782
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:57,491
deem you fit to stand trial for...

783
01:23:57,617 --> 01:23:59,785
Say my name. Say it.

784
01:24:00,203 --> 01:24:01,954
My real name.

785
01:24:02,872 --> 01:24:04,498
I know you remember it.

786
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:07,960
Your name is on the memorial wall

787
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:10,129
of the very building you attacked.

788
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,632
I will have it struck off.

789
01:24:13,216 --> 01:24:17,553
Soon your past will be as nonexistent as your future.

790
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,473
I'll never see you again.

791
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:25,311
Do you know what it does to you?

792
01:24:27,647 --> 01:24:29,732
Hydrogen cyanide?

793
01:24:42,328 --> 01:24:44,830
Look upon your work,

794
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:47,166
Mother.

795
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,790
Let me know what you recover from his computer.

796
01:25:27,915 --> 01:25:31,377
Has he transmitted the lists? If so, to whom? I want this resolved.

797
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,545
Yes, ma'am.

798
01:25:38,968 --> 01:25:41,387
His name is Tiago Rodriguez.

799
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,556
He was a brilliant agent.

800
01:25:44,557 --> 01:25:47,727
But he started operating beyond his brief, hacking the Chinese.

801
01:25:48,394 --> 01:25:52,481
The handover was coming up and they were onto him, so I gave him up.

802
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:55,735
I got six agents in return and a peaceful transition.

803
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:58,988
We should go, ma'am. Board of Inquiry begins in 30 minutes.

804
01:25:59,405 --> 01:26:01,490
I want to know what's on that computer.

805
01:26:14,295 --> 01:26:16,797
Now, looking at Silva's computer,

806
01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:21,218
it seems to me he's done a number of slightly unusual things.

807
01:26:21,302 --> 01:26:24,305
He's established failsafe protocols to wipe the memory

808
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:26,974
if there's any attempt to access certain files.

809
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:30,519
Only six people in the world could program safeguards like that.

810
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:32,646
Of course there are. Can you get past them?

811
01:26:33,481 --> 01:26:34,982
I invented them.

812
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:39,487
Right, then.

813
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,991
Let's see what you've got for us, Mr. Silva.

814
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:47,787
We're in.

815
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:56,754
Sir, what do you make of this?

816
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:03,594
It's his Omega site.

817
01:27:04,637 --> 01:27:06,305
Most encrypted level he has.

818
01:27:08,224 --> 01:27:11,977
Looks like obfuscated code to conceal its true purpose.

819
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:15,439
Security through obscurity.

820
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:19,860
Ladies and gentlemen, if I might have order?

821
01:27:21,028 --> 01:27:22,655
I'd like to begin the proceedings.

822
01:27:24,824 --> 01:27:27,493
We're gathered today to address important issues

823
01:27:27,618 --> 01:27:30,162
concerning the future of our national security.

824
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:37,837
Going somewhere?

825
01:27:40,256 --> 01:27:43,551
So you believe your stewardship of MI6 during the recent crisis

826
01:27:43,676 --> 01:27:45,010
has been up to scratch?

827
01:27:45,386 --> 01:27:48,472
Well, I believe we have apprehended the responsible party

828
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:50,349
and are taking all necessary steps

829
01:27:50,474 --> 01:27:53,185
to ensure that the sensitive information is contained.

830
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,562
Oh,

831
01:27:54,687 --> 01:27:56,313
so it's a job well done.

832
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:58,149
I'm not saying it's gone perfectly, but...

833
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:00,943
You'll forgive me for not putting up the bunting.

834
01:28:01,444 --> 01:28:03,320
I find it rather difficult to overlook monument a I

835
01:28:03,446 --> 01:28:05,364
security breaches and dead operatives

836
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:08,284
for which you are almost single-handedly responsible.

837
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:13,664
He's using a polymorphic engine to mutate the code.

838
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:16,000
Whenever I try to gain access, it changes.

839
01:28:16,709 --> 01:28:19,211
It's like solving a Rubik's cube that's fighting back.

840
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:26,385
Stop.

841
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:29,513
Go in on that.

842
01:28:36,187 --> 01:28:37,229
Granborough.

843
01:28:37,897 --> 01:28:41,692
Granborough Road. It's an old Tube station on the Metropolitan Line.

844
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:43,444
Been closed for years.

845
01:28:45,488 --> 01:28:47,072
Use that as a key.

846
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,085
Oh, look, it's a map!

847
01:29:02,338 --> 01:29:03,422
It's London.

848
01:29:04,507 --> 01:29:06,800
Subterranean London.

849
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:10,596
What's going on? Why are the doors open?

850
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,066
Oh, no.

851
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:24,401
Can someone tell me how the hell he got into our system?

852
01:29:28,614 --> 01:29:30,032
Oh, shit.

853
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:33,160
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

854
01:29:34,954 --> 01:29:36,121
He hacked us.

855
01:29:43,754 --> 01:29:45,172
Oh, no.

856
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:54,515
Q.

857
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,350
He's gone.

858
01:30:05,943 --> 01:30:07,903
I'm in a stairwell below isolation.

859
01:30:08,237 --> 01:30:09,655
Do you read me, Q?

860
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:11,323
I can hear you. I'm looking for you.

861
01:30:22,293 --> 01:30:23,544
Got you. Tracking your location.

862
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:25,796
Just keep moving forward.

863
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:28,382
Enter the next service door on your right.

864
01:30:35,222 --> 01:30:37,224
If you're through that door, you should be in the Tube.

865
01:30:38,017 --> 01:30:39,476
I'm in the Tube.

866
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:44,148
Bond, this isn't an escape. This was years in the planning.

867
01:30:44,273 --> 01:30:46,859
He wanted us to capture him, he wanted us to access his computer.

868
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,569
It was all planned.

869
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:52,197
Blowing up HQ. Knowing the emergency protocols.

870
01:30:52,323 --> 01:30:54,033
Knowing we'd retreat down here.

871
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:58,537
I've got all that. It's what he's got planned next that worries me.

872
01:30:59,038 --> 01:31:02,082
District Line is the closest. There's a service door on your left.

873
01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:04,793
Got it.

874
01:31:08,547 --> 01:31:09,715
It won't open.

875
01:31:09,882 --> 01:31:11,091
It will. Put your back into it.

876
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:13,636
Why don't you come down here and put your back into it?

877
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:19,016
No, it's stuck.

878
01:31:20,017 --> 01:31:22,394
Oh, good. There's a train coming.

879
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:29,234
Hmm. That's vexing.

880
01:31:42,331 --> 01:31:43,540
I'm through.

881
01:31:44,375 --> 01:31:45,876
Told you.

882
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:47,961
We alerted security. Police are on their way.

883
01:32:25,499 --> 01:32:26,792
Where are you now?

884
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:28,168
Temple Tube station.

885
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:29,962
Along with half of London.

886
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:36,093
Oh, I see you. There you are.

887
01:32:36,677 --> 01:32:40,347
I know where I am, Q. Where's he?

888
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,433
Give us a second. I'm looking for him.

889
01:32:42,558 --> 01:32:44,017
Mind the gap.

890
01:32:50,941 --> 01:32:52,818
There's too many people. I can't see him.

891
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:55,070
Welcome to rush hour on the Tube.

892
01:32:55,696 --> 01:32:57,322
Not something you'd know much about.

893
01:32:57,823 --> 01:32:59,908
Mind the gap.

894
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:10,961
The train's leaving. Do I get on the train?

895
01:33:11,545 --> 01:33:14,214
Don't get on. I'm not sure he's on it. Give us a minute.

896
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:18,051
Do I get on the train?

897
01:33:24,016 --> 01:33:25,017
Bond.

898
01:33:25,142 --> 01:33:26,977
What? Get on the train.

899
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:42,743
He's keen to get home.

900
01:33:43,619 --> 01:33:44,995
Will you open the door, please?

901
01:33:47,623 --> 01:33:49,583
Open the door.

902
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:54,755
Health and Safety. Carry on.

903
01:34:01,553 --> 01:34:02,596
Where are you?

904
01:34:02,805 --> 01:34:04,765
Take a wild guess, Q.

905
01:34:05,182 --> 01:34:07,559
He's in disguise, dressed as a policeman.

906
01:34:07,726 --> 01:34:09,186
Of course he is.

907
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:33,001
Where's he going? Where's he going?

908
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:43,220
He's going for M. Tell Tanner. Get her out of there.

909
01:34:43,637 --> 01:34:47,099
You've overlooked, or chosen to ignore, hard evidence

910
01:34:47,975 --> 01:34:50,853
and consistently, almost obstinately...

911
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:53,522
Silva's escaped. Bond's in pursuit.

912
01:34:53,814 --> 01:34:56,358
We need to get you to a secure location immediately.

913
01:34:56,483 --> 01:34:58,360
I'll be damned if I'm gonna show her my back.

914
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:00,612
Are we straining your attention?

915
01:35:01,405 --> 01:35:04,491
No. Please, Minister, proceed.

916
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:14,001
Excuse me.

917
01:35:32,603 --> 01:35:33,645
Move! Move!

918
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:39,211
It's as if you insist on pretending

919
01:36:39,336 --> 01:36:41,338
we still live in a golden age of espionage

920
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:44,299
where human intelligence was the only resource available.

921
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:47,135
Well, I find this rather old-fashioned belief

922
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:49,554
demonstrates a reckless disregard for...

923
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:51,974
Excuse me, Minister, I don't mean to interrupt,

924
01:36:52,057 --> 01:36:54,184
but just for the sake of variety,

925
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,645
might we actually hear from the witness?

926
01:36:58,647 --> 01:36:59,898
Of course.

927
01:37:03,235 --> 01:37:04,361
Thank you.

928
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,721
Oh!

929
01:37:33,015 --> 01:37:34,766
I won't miss next time, Mr. Silva.

930
01:37:35,225 --> 01:37:38,603
Not bad. Not bad, James, for a physical wreck.

931
01:37:39,104 --> 01:37:41,148
Oi. Thank you.

932
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:42,607
You caught me.

933
01:37:44,526 --> 01:37:47,446
Now, here's your prize.

934
01:37:47,696 --> 01:37:51,116
The latest thing from my local toy store.

935
01:37:51,575 --> 01:37:53,785
It's called radio.

936
01:37:58,749 --> 01:37:59,750
Whew!

937
01:38:02,294 --> 01:38:04,046
I do hope that wasn't for me.

938
01:38:04,713 --> 01:38:05,797
No.

939
01:38:06,465 --> 01:38:07,758
But that is.

940
01:38:59,184 --> 01:39:00,519
Chairman, Ministers.

941
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:03,146
Today I've repeatedly heard how

942
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:05,524
irrelevant my department has become.

943
01:39:05,774 --> 01:39:07,734
Why do we need agents? The Double-O section?

944
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:09,861
Isn't it all rather quaint?

945
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:14,491
Well, I suppose I see a different world than you do.

946
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:19,204
And the truth is that what I see frightens me.

947
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:25,001
I'm frightened because our enemies are no longer known to us.

948
01:39:25,627 --> 01:39:27,420
They do not exist on a map.

949
01:39:27,504 --> 01:39:30,006
They're not nations. They are individuals.

950
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:34,845
Look around you. Who do you fear?

951
01:39:36,012 --> 01:39:38,723
Can you see a face? A uniform? A flag? No.

952
01:39:40,058 --> 01:39:42,227
Our world is not more transparent now.

953
01:39:42,394 --> 01:39:44,020
It's more opaque.

954
01:39:44,312 --> 01:39:45,730
It's in the shadows.

955
01:39:47,232 --> 01:39:49,234
That's where we must do battle.

956
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:53,321
So, before you declare us irrelevant, ask yourselves,

957
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:57,200
how safe do you feel?

958
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:03,498
I've just one more thing to say.

959
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:06,585
My late husband was a great lover of poetry.

960
01:40:06,835 --> 01:40:08,170
And, um...

961
01:40:08,837 --> 01:40:12,591
I suppose some of it sunk in, despite my best intentions.

962
01:40:13,425 --> 01:40:17,762
And here today I remember this, I think from Tennyson:

963
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:23,435
"We are not now that strength,

964
01:40:23,685 --> 01:40:26,438
"which in old days Moved earth and heaven;

965
01:40:27,856 --> 01:40:30,108
"That which we are, we are;

966
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:33,945
"One equal temper of heroic hearts,

967
01:40:34,571 --> 01:40:37,282
"Made weak by time

968
01:40:37,699 --> 01:40:39,117
"and fate,

969
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:41,953
"but strong in will

970
01:40:42,454 --> 01:40:44,247
"To strive, to seek,

971
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:46,583
"to find

972
01:40:46,875 --> 01:40:48,919
"and not to yield."

973
01:42:10,959 --> 01:42:12,294
Go, go, go, go!

974
01:42:12,377 --> 01:42:13,378
Move!

975
01:42:13,837 --> 01:42:15,380
Move! Go! Move!

976
01:42:55,837 --> 01:42:58,923
007, what the hell are we doing? Are you kidnapping me?

977
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:00,759
That would be one way of looking at it.

978
01:43:03,845 --> 01:43:06,014
Too many people are dying because of me.

979
01:43:06,264 --> 01:43:08,433
If he wants you, he'll have to come and get you.

980
01:43:08,558 --> 01:43:10,977
We've been one step behind Silva from the start.

981
01:43:11,061 --> 01:43:13,229
It's time to get out in front, change the game.

982
01:43:14,189 --> 01:43:15,398
And I'm to be the bait?

983
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:21,571
All right. But just us. No one else.

984
01:43:23,114 --> 01:43:25,450
Q? I need help.

985
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:27,619
I'm tracking the car. Where are you going?

986
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:29,662
I've got M. We're about to disappear.

987
01:43:30,163 --> 01:43:31,247
What?

988
01:43:31,456 --> 01:43:33,625
I need you to lay a trail of breadcrumbs impossible to follow

989
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:35,960
for anyone except Silva. Think you can do it?

990
01:43:37,921 --> 01:43:39,881
I'm guessing this isn't strictly official.

991
01:43:39,964 --> 01:43:41,132
Not even remotely.

992
01:43:41,424 --> 01:43:44,344
So much for my promising career in espionage.

993
01:43:53,103 --> 01:43:55,563
I'm not hiding in there, if that's your brilliant plan.

994
01:43:55,647 --> 01:43:57,357
We're changing vehicles.

995
01:43:58,191 --> 01:44:01,611
Trouble with company cars is they have trackers.

996
01:44:11,246 --> 01:44:14,249
Oh, and I suppose that's completely inconspicuous.

997
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:16,126
Get in.

998
01:44:38,982 --> 01:44:40,859
It's not very comfortable, is it?

999
01:44:42,861 --> 01:44:44,863
Are you gonna complain the whole way?

1000
01:44:44,988 --> 01:44:47,031
Oh, go on then, eject me. See if I care.

1001
01:44:50,285 --> 01:44:51,327
Where are we going?

1002
01:44:53,246 --> 01:44:54,539
Back in time.

1003
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:57,959
Somewhere we'll have the advantage.

1004
01:44:59,711 --> 01:45:01,171
It's a fine line.

1005
01:45:01,296 --> 01:45:03,798
Make the breadcrumb too small and he might miss it.

1006
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:06,134
Too big and Silva will smell a rat.

1007
01:45:06,551 --> 01:45:08,887
But do you think even Silva will be able to spot that?

1008
01:45:09,637 --> 01:45:11,514
He's the only one who could.

1009
01:45:13,892 --> 01:45:15,018
Sir.

1010
01:45:16,561 --> 01:45:17,562
Oh.

1011
01:45:18,062 --> 01:45:19,314
What are you doing?

1012
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:20,732
We're just...monitoring.

1013
01:45:20,857 --> 01:45:23,485
Creating a false tracking signal for Silva to follow.

1014
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:26,321
Well, sir, um... Well, no.

1015
01:45:26,529 --> 01:45:28,406
Excellent thinking. Get him isolated.

1016
01:45:28,573 --> 01:45:30,492
Send him on the A9. It's the direct route.

1017
01:45:30,575 --> 01:45:32,744
You can monitor his progress more accurately

1018
01:45:32,869 --> 01:45:34,704
and confirm it with the traffic cameras.

1019
01:45:34,913 --> 01:45:36,956
But what if the PM finds out?

1020
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:39,876
Then we're all buggered.

1021
01:45:40,585 --> 01:45:41,920
Carry on.

1022
01:46:24,212 --> 01:46:26,047
Is this where you grew up?

1023
01:46:26,714 --> 01:46:27,715
Mm.

1024
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:32,178
How old were you when they died?

1025
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:37,976
You know the answer to that.

1026
01:46:40,311 --> 01:46:42,438
You know the whole story.

1027
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:52,907
Orphans always make the best recruits.

1028
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,665
Storm's coming.

1029
01:48:00,683 --> 01:48:01,851
Christ.

1030
01:48:01,934 --> 01:48:02,935
Mm-hmm.

1031
01:48:04,479 --> 01:48:06,522
No wonder you never came back.

1032
01:49:00,284 --> 01:49:01,703
James.

1033
01:49:01,911 --> 01:49:03,705
James Bond.

1034
01:49:03,955 --> 01:49:04,956
Good God.

1035
01:49:06,708 --> 01:49:08,084
Are you still alive?

1036
01:49:09,794 --> 01:49:11,546
It's nice to see you, too.

1037
01:49:13,923 --> 01:49:16,300
M, this is Kincade.

1038
01:49:16,801 --> 01:49:18,636
Gamekeeper here since I was a boy.

1039
01:49:19,137 --> 01:49:20,221
Pleased to meet you, Emma.

1040
01:49:20,346 --> 01:49:21,472
Mr. Kincade.

1041
01:49:23,433 --> 01:49:24,934
You're a tad late. They've sold the place,

1042
01:49:25,309 --> 01:49:26,561
when they thought you were dead.

1043
01:49:26,644 --> 01:49:28,312
It seems they were wrong.

1044
01:49:29,605 --> 01:49:30,940
What are you doing here?

1045
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:32,984
Some men are coming to kill us.

1046
01:49:34,652 --> 01:49:35,820
But we're gonna kill them first.

1047
01:49:37,822 --> 01:49:39,240
Then we'd better get ready.

1048
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:43,244
Do we still have a gun room?

1049
01:49:43,995 --> 01:49:44,996
Ah.

1050
01:49:46,956 --> 01:49:51,335
They sold the lot to a collector from Idaho or some such place.

1051
01:49:51,794 --> 01:49:53,921
They were shipped out weeks ago.

1052
01:49:54,464 --> 01:49:55,840
There's just...

1053
01:49:56,507 --> 01:50:00,011
your father's old hunting rifle.

1054
01:50:01,137 --> 01:50:02,972
We couldn't let that go.

1055
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:10,354
And this is what we've got.

1056
01:50:12,023 --> 01:50:15,026
There might be a couple of sticks of dynamite from the quarry.

1057
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:17,695
But if all else fails,

1058
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:22,366
sometimes the old ways are the best.

1059
01:50:28,372 --> 01:50:30,875
So who is it we're supposed to be fighting?

1060
01:50:31,209 --> 01:50:33,544
No "we" in it, Kincade.

1061
01:50:34,045 --> 01:50:35,630
This is not your fight.

1062
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:38,883
Try and stop me, you jumped-up little shit.

1063
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:43,930
Now, remember what I taught you. Don't let it pull to the left.

1064
01:50:45,389 --> 01:50:47,225
I'll do my best.

1065
01:50:55,983 --> 01:50:57,944
What did you say you did for a living?

1066
01:51:13,668 --> 01:51:14,961
Emma!

1067
01:51:15,753 --> 01:51:17,380
I brought you some things.

1068
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:22,760
The nights get cold here.

1069
01:51:23,219 --> 01:51:25,179
Thank you, Mr. Kincade.

1070
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:27,598
It's a beautiful old house.

1071
01:51:27,765 --> 01:51:28,808
She is.

1072
01:51:29,767 --> 01:51:34,689
And like all great ladies, she still has her secret ways.

1073
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:36,315
Let me show you this.

1074
01:51:41,612 --> 01:51:42,780
Priest's hole?

1075
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:45,449
Yeah, from Reformation times.

1076
01:51:45,950 --> 01:51:48,119
The tunnel leads under the moor.

1077
01:51:48,244 --> 01:51:50,413
If you get in danger, this is the place to come.

1078
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:56,377
The night I told him his parents had died, he hid in here for two days.

1079
01:51:58,796 --> 01:51:59,964
When he did come out...

1080
01:52:00,631 --> 01:52:02,300
he wasn't a boy anymore.

1081
01:52:03,843 --> 01:52:06,095
Eh. Must get on.

1082
01:54:06,507 --> 01:54:08,426
I fucked this up, didn't I?

1083
01:54:10,136 --> 01:54:11,303
No.

1084
01:54:13,222 --> 01:54:14,932
You did your job.

1085
01:54:20,062 --> 01:54:21,731
I read your obituary of me.

1086
01:54:23,482 --> 01:54:24,608
And?

1087
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:25,901
Appalling.

1088
01:54:26,736 --> 01:54:28,237
Yeah, I knew you'd hate it.

1089
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:32,867
I did call you "an exemplar of British fortitude".

1090
01:54:33,743 --> 01:54:35,411
That bit was all right.

1091
01:54:40,624 --> 01:54:41,751
You ready?

1092
01:54:42,334 --> 01:54:45,421
I was ready before you were born, son.

1093
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:06,210
Welcome to Scotland.

1094
01:57:23,078 --> 01:57:24,121
You dropped something.

1095
01:57:50,648 --> 01:57:51,690
You hurt?

1096
01:57:52,566 --> 01:57:54,902
Only my pride. I never was a good shot.

1097
01:58:00,908 --> 01:58:01,992
He's not here.

1098
01:58:02,743 --> 01:58:03,869
He's not here.

1099
01:58:38,404 --> 01:58:40,239
Always got to make an entrance.

1100
01:58:41,824 --> 01:58:43,867
You two, go to the kitchen. Now.

1101
01:59:08,058 --> 01:59:09,059
Get behind the arch!

1102
01:59:52,519 --> 01:59:54,063
Go to the chapel. Use the tunnel.

1103
02:01:15,978 --> 02:01:20,190
Everyone, listen to me! Don't you dare touch her. She's mine.

1104
02:01:37,207 --> 02:01:38,542
Can your friend come out and say hello?

1105
02:02:46,527 --> 02:02:48,612
Come on. This way.

1106
02:03:46,461 --> 02:03:48,505
I always hated this place.

1107
02:03:58,890 --> 02:04:00,350
Are you getting warm?

1108
02:05:29,314 --> 02:05:31,483
Just make sure Bond's dead!

1109
02:05:34,861 --> 02:05:37,072
Now it's me and her.

1110
02:07:35,190 --> 02:07:38,652
You see what comes of all this running around, Mr. Bond?

1111
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:42,072
All this jumping and fighting.

1112
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:44,115
It's exhausting!

1113
02:07:47,285 --> 02:07:48,745
Relax.

1114
02:07:50,413 --> 02:07:52,165
You need to relax.

1115
02:08:10,976 --> 02:08:13,770
Ah, well... Mother's calling.

1116
02:08:15,397 --> 02:08:17,524
I'll give her a goodbye kiss for you.

1117
02:08:36,918 --> 02:08:38,962
Oh, my God.

1118
02:10:36,621 --> 02:10:38,498
Of course.

1119
02:10:38,915 --> 02:10:40,542
It had to be here.

1120
02:10:42,919 --> 02:10:44,546
It had to be this way.

1121
02:10:46,006 --> 02:10:47,465
Thank you.

1122
02:10:47,590 --> 02:10:49,300
I can't find it no... Don't.

1123
02:10:53,263 --> 02:10:55,849
Please. Don't.

1124
02:11:11,156 --> 02:11:13,575
You're hurt. You're hurt.

1125
02:11:17,829 --> 02:11:19,748
What have they done to you?

1126
02:11:20,290 --> 02:11:22,417
What have they done to you?

1127
02:11:54,908 --> 02:11:56,451
Free both of us.

1128
02:11:56,910 --> 02:11:58,620
Free both of us...

1129
02:11:59,954 --> 02:12:01,206
with the same bullet.

1130
02:12:02,957 --> 02:12:04,125
Do it.

1131
02:12:04,709 --> 02:12:05,835
Do it.

1132
02:12:07,962 --> 02:12:09,172
Only you can do it.

1133
02:12:09,964 --> 02:12:11,216
Do it.

1134
02:12:27,023 --> 02:12:28,274
Ah!

1135
02:12:54,217 --> 02:12:56,010
Last rat standing.

1136
02:13:06,271 --> 02:13:09,274
007. What took you so long?

1137
02:13:09,566 --> 02:13:12,527
Well, I got into some deep water.

1138
02:13:14,445 --> 02:13:15,446
Oh!

1139
02:13:28,543 --> 02:13:30,628
I suppose it's...

1140
02:13:31,045 --> 02:13:33,381
too late to make a run for it?

1141
02:13:39,554 --> 02:13:41,472
Well, I'm game if you are.

1142
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:54,235
I did get one thing right.

1143
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:19,779
Wow.

1144
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:23,199
I didn't even know you could come up here.

1145
02:15:24,534 --> 02:15:26,369
Hate to waste a view.

1146
02:15:26,744 --> 02:15:28,454
I can see why.

1147
02:15:30,248 --> 02:15:33,126
I thought you were going back out on active service.

1148
02:15:34,627 --> 02:15:36,421
I declined.

1149
02:15:38,089 --> 02:15:39,465
You said it yourself,

1150
02:15:40,049 --> 02:15:41,801
fieldwork's not for everyone.

1151
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:45,638
If it helps, I feel a lot safer.

1152
02:15:50,935 --> 02:15:52,812
Her will was read today.

1153
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:55,231
She left you this.

1154
02:16:07,493 --> 02:16:10,371
Maybe it was her way of telling you to take a desk job.

1155
02:16:11,247 --> 02:16:12,999
Just the opposite.

1156
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:17,503
Thank you.

1157
02:16:36,439 --> 02:16:38,983
You know, we've never formally been introduced.

1158
02:16:42,653 --> 02:16:44,113
Well, my name's Eve.

1159
02:16:44,906 --> 02:16:46,324
Eve Moneypenny.

1160
02:16:47,283 --> 02:16:49,869
Well, I look forward to our time together, Miss Moneypenny.

1161
02:16:50,370 --> 02:16:54,540
Me, too. I'm sure we'll have one or two close shaves.

1162
02:16:56,918 --> 02:16:57,960
Morning, 007.

1163
02:16:58,086 --> 02:16:59,128
Good morning, Tanner.

1164
02:16:59,545 --> 02:17:00,546
He'll see you now.

1165
02:17:15,978 --> 02:17:17,313
How's the arm, sir?

1166
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:20,441
What? Oh, it's fine.

1167
02:17:20,566 --> 02:17:21,818
It'll get better.

1168
02:17:21,943 --> 02:17:24,821
All pretty shocking for someone unused to fieldwork.

1169
02:17:27,824 --> 02:17:31,327
So, 007... Lots to be done.

1170
02:17:35,498 --> 02:17:37,417
Are you ready to get back to work?

1171
02:17:39,335 --> 02:17:41,421
With pleasure, M.

1172
02:17:43,673 --> 02:17:45,675
With pleasure.
