00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,200
A long time ago
in a galaxy far, far away....

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,400
STAR WARS

00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,240
Episode IX
THE RISE OF SKYWALKER

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,320
The dead speak! The galaxy
has heard a mysterious broadcast,

6
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,600
a threat of REVENGE in the sinister
voice of the late EMPEROR PALPATINE.

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,360
GENERAL LEIA ORGANA dispatches
secret agents to gather intelligence,

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,600
while REY,
the last hope of the Jedi,

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,440
trains for battle against
the diabolical FIRST ORDER.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Meanwhile, Supreme Leader KYLO REN

11
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,000
rages in search of
the phantom Emperor,

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,000
determined to destroy
any threat to his power....

13
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,520
At last.

14
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,600
Snoke trained you well.

15
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,360
I killed Snoke.

16
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,200
I'll kill you.

17
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
My boy.

18
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,640
I made Snoke.

19
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,280
I have been every voice...

20
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
you have ever heard...

21
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,320
<i>inside your head.</i>

22
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,560
The First Order
was just the beginning.

23
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,960
I will give you
so much more.

24
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,600
You'll die first.

25
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,160
I have died before.

26
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,600
The dark side of the Force
is a pathway...

27
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,680
to many abilities
some consider to be...

28
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,200
unnatural.

29
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,200
What could you give me?

30
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,840
Everything.

31
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,480
A new Empire.

32
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,720
<i>The might of the Final Order
will soon be ready.</i>

33
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,760
<i>It will be yours
if you do as I ask.</i>

34
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,520
Kill the girl!

35
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,200
End the Jedi...

36
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,400
and become what your
grandfather Vader could not.

37
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,120
You will rule
all the galaxy...

38
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,800
as the new emperor.

39
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,200
But beware...

40
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,360
she is not
who you think she is.

41
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,680
Who is she?

42
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,480
Are you ever gonna go?

43
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,760
- He can't beat us every time.
- Apparently he does.

44
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,960
How does he do it?

45
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,120
This guy right here?
It's 'cause he cheats.

46
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,920
I'm kidding!

47
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,200
- Oh, come on. Take your turn.
- You're 250 years old.

48
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,560
You're taking forever.
That's cheating.

49
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,800
Of course
you're better than us.

50
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,880
That's why we think
you're cheating.

51
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,880
- Don't worry!
- We're not gonna turn it off.

52
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,720
- He's cheating.
- Definitely.

53
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,960
Klaud, I hope
you fixed that surge.

54
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,480
T-minus five.

55
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,720
Artoo.

56
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,240
Boolio, good to see you.
You got something for us?

57
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,120
From a new ally!
A spy in the First Order!

58
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
A spy? Who?

59
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,320
I don't know!

60
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,360
Transfer the message!
Get it to Leia, hurry!

61
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,040
This could be big, Artoo.

62
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,760
<i>Locked on target.</i>

63
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,440
Finn, we're about
to be cooked!

64
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,640
We're almost there!

65
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,480
Poe, we got it.

66
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,920
How do we thank you?

67
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,600
Win the war!

68
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,120
Sorry, I'm sorry! I know!

69
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,120
Finn, you're supposed to be
getting rid of those things!

70
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,080
Ooh!

71
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,280
- I got one!
- How many are left?

72
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,440
Too many.

73
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,400
What?

74
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,440
Good thinking, Chewie.

75
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,040
Finn, we can boulder
these TIEs!

76
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,520
I was just thinking that.

77
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,960
Ha!

78
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,960
<i>Get us back to base!</i>

79
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,640
How thick do you think
that ice wall is?

80
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,280
- Poe!
- I know, I know!

81
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,440
What are you doing?

82
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,120
Lightspeed skipping.

83
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,760
How do you know
how to do that?

84
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,280
Yeah, well,
Rey's not here, is she?

85
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,640
Last jump, maybe forever.

86
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,680
Hold on!

87
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,280
Be with me.

88
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,880
Be with me.

89
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,600
Be with me.

90
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,600
They're not with me. Ugh.

91
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,800
Rey.

92
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,000
Be patient.

93
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,680
I'm starting to
think it isn't possible...

94
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,120
to hear voices of the Jedi
who came before.

95
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,360
Nothing's impossible.

96
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,120
I'm gonna run
the training course.

97
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,960
<i>No!</i>

98
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,000
Join me.

99
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,720
<i>Join me.</i>

100
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,280
<i>Ben, no!</i>

101
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,320
<i>You killed him!</i>

102
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,760
Ben!

103
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,960
BB-8,
I'm so sorry.

104
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,520
I didn't finish
the training course.

105
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,960
Got distracted.

106
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,320
I'm just
not feeling myself.

107
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,400
I know it looks...

108
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,480
It looks like
I'm making excuses.

109
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,080
Don't tell me
what things look like.

110
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,360
Tell me what they are.

111
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,960
I think I'm just tired.
That's all.

112
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,600
General...

113
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,680
the <i>Falcon</i>
still hasn't arrived.

114
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,280
Commander's asking
for guidance.

115
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,400
I will earn
your brother's saber...

116
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,720
one day.

117
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,640
No, you can't do it for me.

118
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,120
Never underestimate
a droid.

119
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,960
Yes, Master.

120
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,040
Rey!

121
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,400
<i>Falcon's</i> back!

122
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,520
Come on, get over here!

123
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,920
I need a fire crew here!

124
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,200
And another one in the back!
Go, go!

125
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,960
Coming!

126
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,000
It's on fire!

127
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
Whole thing's on fire.
All of it.

128
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,000
- It's on fire.
- Hey.

129
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,320
- Hey!
- There's a spy?

130
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,280
Really could have used
your help out there.

131
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,200
How'd it go?

132
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,960
Really bad, actually.
Really bad.

133
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,880
- Han's ship...
- What'd you do to the droid?

134
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,240
What'd you do
to the <i>Falcon?</i>

135
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,680
The <i>Falcon</i> in
a lot better shape than he is.

136
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,880
BB-8's not on fire.

137
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,440
What's left of him
isn't on fire.

138
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,680
- Tell me what happened.
- You tell me first.

139
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,120
- You know what you are?
- What?

140
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,520
You're difficult.
Really difficult.

141
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,880
- You're a difficult man.
- You, you are...

142
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,520
- Rey.
- Finn. Oh.

143
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,000
You made it back.

144
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,280
Yeah. Barely.

145
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,360
- So, bad mood?
- Me?

146
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,880
- Him.
- Always.

147
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,720
Do we have a spy?

148
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,480
Well...

149
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,920
You lightspeed skipped?

150
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,120
Yeah, well, it got us
back here, didn't it?

151
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,480
Poe, the compressor's down.

152
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,840
- Oh, I know, I was there.
- Every time.

153
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,080
You can't lightspeed skip
the <i>Falcon!</i>

154
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,360
Actually,
it turns out you can.

155
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,000
All right, guys,
we just landed, okay?

156
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,200
What happened?

157
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,040
Bad news,
that's what happened.

158
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
No spy?

159
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,200
No. Spy.

160
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,520
Did we make contact
with a spy or not?

161
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,760
There's a mole
in the First Order,

162
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,840
and they sent us a message.

163
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,040
You dropped a tree on him?

164
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,080
You blew
both sub-alternators?

165
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,280
Well,
you know what...

166
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,680
maybe you should've been
out there with us!

167
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,560
You know I wanna be
out there with you.

168
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,760
Yeah, but you're not.

169
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,360
You're here training.
For what?

170
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,880
You're the best fighter
we have.

171
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,640
We need you.

172
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,360
Out there, not here.

173
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,720
Junior...

174
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,920
get Artoo
into reconditioning.

175
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,080
It's true.

176
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,320
What's the message?

177
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,920
We've decoded the intel
from the First Order spy...

178
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,800
and it confirms the worst.

179
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,520
Somehow,
Palpatine returned.

180
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,040
Wait.
Do we believe this?

181
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,400
It cannot be.

182
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,480
The Emperor is dead.

183
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,360
Dark science.
Cloning.

184
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,680
Secrets only the Sith knew.

185
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,640
He's been planning
his revenge.

186
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,240
His followers have been
building something for years.

187
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,800
The largest fleet
the galaxy has ever known.

188
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,240
He calls it
the Final Order.

189
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,920
In 16 hours, attacks
on all free worlds begin.

190
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,360
The Emperor and his fleet
have been hiding

191
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,640
in the Unknown Regions.

192
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,760
On a world called Exegol.

193
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,280
Exegol does not appear
on any star chart.

194
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,680
But legend describes it as
the hidden world of the Sith.

195
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,120
There were always whispers

196
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,680
of his hunger to cheat death.

197
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,000
So, Palpatine's been
out there all this time.

198
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,480
Pulling the strings.

199
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,040
Always. In the shadows.
From the very beginning.

200
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,400
If we want to stop him,
we must find him.

201
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,040
Must find Exegol.

202
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,400
General?

203
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,720
Can I speak with you?

204
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,240
I know how to get
to Exegol.

205
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,320
- Tell me.
- Luke searched for it.

206
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,800
For a long time.
He nearly found it.

207
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,040
There are ciphers here
I can't read.

208
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,640
But he said to get there,
you need one of these.

209
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,560
A Sith wayfinder.

210
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,440
They're compasses
that lead the way to Exegol.

211
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,040
To stop what we both know
is coming...

212
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,080
I need to finish
what Luke started.

213
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,400
Find Exegol.

214
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,600
Find the Emperor.

215
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,000
No.

216
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,240
I don't want to go without
your blessing, but I will.

217
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,880
I will.

218
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,720
It's what you would do.

219
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,400
So, you got her
up and running?

220
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,920
You were right before.

221
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm gonna pick up
Luke's search for Exegol.

222
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,240
I'm gonna start
where his trail went cold.

223
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,080
The Forbidden Desert
of Pasaana.

224
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,320
Yeah, I know.
We're going with you.

225
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,200
Chewie, you get
that compressor fixed?

226
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,080
I need to go alone.

227
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,360
Yeah. Alone with friends.

228
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,640
It's too dangerous, Finn.

229
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,360
We go together.

230
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,000
I wholeheartedly agree.

231
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,080
Rose, last chance.

232
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,960
The General asked me to study
the specs of old Destroyers.

233
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,280
So we can stop the fleet
if you find it.

234
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,120
"If"?

235
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,120
When.

236
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,160
When.

237
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,160
Hey, we should get going.

238
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,400
What is it?

239
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,920
Nothing.

240
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,600
In the event
that I do not return...

241
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,920
I want you to know

242
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,160
that you have been
a real friend, Artoo.

243
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,720
My best one, in fact.

244
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,240
There's so much
I want to tell you.

245
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,640
Tell me when you get back.

246
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,720
Rey...

247
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,680
never be afraid
of who you are.

248
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,480
It is.

249
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,080
<i>Knights of Ren.</i>

250
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,240
<i>Ghouls.</i>

251
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,200
<i>We have a spy
in our ranks...</i>

252
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,160
<i>who just sent a message
to the Resistance.</i>

253
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,200
<i>Whoever this traitor is
won't stop us.</i>

254
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,800
<i>With what I've seen
on Exegol...</i>

255
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,760
<i>the First Order is about to
become a true Empire.</i>

256
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,240
<i>I sense unease about
my appearance, General Hux.</i>

257
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,920
About the mask?

258
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,320
No, sir. Well done.

259
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,440
I like it.

260
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,560
Forgive me, sir,
but these allies on Exegol...

261
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,720
they sound like a cult.

262
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,680
Conjurers
and soothsayers.

263
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,840
They've conjured
legions of Star Destroyers.

264
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,080
The Sith fleet
will increase our resources

265
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,720
ten-thousandfold.

266
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,960
Such range and power
will correct the error

267
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,520
of Starkiller Base.

268
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,240
We'll need
to increase recruitments.

269
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,160
Harvest more of
the galaxy's young.

270
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,320
This fleet,
what is it, a gift?

271
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,640
What is he asking for
in return?

272
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,640
<i>Prepare to crush
any worlds that defy us.</i>

273
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,320
<i>My knights and I
are going hunting</i>

274
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,880
<i>for the scavenger.</i>

275
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,400
You sure
this is it?

276
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,120
These are
the exact coordinates

277
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,440
that Master Luke
left behind.

278
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,320
What is this?

279
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,040
The Acky Acky
Festival of the Ancestors.

280
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,760
This celebration occurs
only once every 42 years.

281
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,560
Well, that's lucky.

282
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,280
Lucky indeed.

283
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,760
This festival is known
for both its colorful kites...

284
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,960
and its delectable sweets.

285
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,360
I've never seen
anything like this.

286
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,160
I've never seen
so few wayfinders.

287
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,040
There's always random
First Order patrols

288
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,560
in crowds like these.

289
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,920
So, keep your heads
down.

290
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,040
Chewie.

291
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,640
Let's split up.
See what the locals know.

292
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,400
She is saying,
"Welcome."

293
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,120
Her name is Nambi Ghima.

294
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,800
That's an excellent name.
I'm Rey.

295
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,200
She would be honored
to know your family name, too.

296
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,600
I don't have one.

297
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,960
I'm just Rey.

298
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,120
<i>Palpatine wants you dead.</i>

299
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,920
- Serving another master?
- <i>No.</i>

300
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,920
<i>I have other plans.</i>

301
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,720
<i>I offered you
my hand once.</i>

302
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,360
<i>You wanted to take it.</i>

303
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,600
<i>Why didn't you?</i>

304
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,600
You could've killed me.

305
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,040
Why didn't you?

306
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,240
<i>You can't hide, Rey.</i>

307
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,280
<i>Not from me.</i>

308
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,360
I see through the cracks
in your mask.

309
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,800
You're haunted.

310
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,800
You can't stop seeing
what you did to your father.

311
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,160
<i>Do you still
count the days</i>

312
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,640
<i>since your parents left?</i>

313
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,520
<i>Such pain in you,
such anger.</i>

314
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,400
<i>I don't wanna
have to kill you.</i>

315
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,800
<i>I'm going to find you</i>

316
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,640
<i>and I'm going to turn you
to the dark side.</i>

317
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,080
<i>When I offer you
my hand again...</i>

318
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,000
<i>you'll take it.</i>

319
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,840
We'll see.

320
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,040
Has he seen him?

321
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,080
We have to go.
Back to the <i>Falcon.</i> Now.

322
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,880
- Why?
- It's Ren.

323
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,440
Sir,
we've had this analyzed.

324
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,000
It comes
from the Middian System,

325
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,360
Pasaana, Forbidden Valley.

326
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,680
<i>Prepare my ship.</i>

327
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,680
<i>Alert the local troops.
Send a division.</i>

328
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,960
Yes, Supreme Leader.

329
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,960
<i>Freeze.</i>

330
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,120
<i>Hold it right there.</i>

331
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,800
<i>I've located
the Resistance fugitives.</i>

332
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,880
<i>All units, report...</i>

333
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,680
<i>Follow me.</i>

334
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,760
<i>Hurry.</i>

335
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,720
<i>Leia sent me
a transmission.</i>

336
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,280
Okay.

337
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,040
How'd you find us?

338
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,600
Wookiees
stand out in a crowd.

339
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,640
It's good to see you too,
old buddy.

340
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,640
This is
General Lando Calrissian.

341
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,680
We know who he is,
Threepio.

342
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,800
It is an honor, General.

343
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,360
General Calrissian,
we're looking for Exegol.

344
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,320
Of course you are.

345
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,160
Only two were made.

346
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,200
A Sith wayfinder.

347
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,040
Luke Skywalker came here
to find one.

348
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,800
I know.
I was with him.

349
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,040
Luke and I were tailing
an old Jedi hunter.

350
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,720
Ochi of Bestoon.

351
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,920
He was carrying a clue

352
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,400
that could lead
to a wayfinder.

353
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,280
We followed his ship halfway
across the galaxy here.

354
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,400
When we got to his ship,
it was abandoned...

355
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,280
No clue. No wayfinder.

356
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,520
Is Ochi's ship still here?

357
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,320
It's out in the desert,
where he left it.

358
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,520
We need to get to that ship.
Search it again.

359
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,040
I got a bad feeling
about this.

360
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,480
Ochi's ship
is out past Lurch Canyon.

361
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,640
- Go.
- Thank you, General.

362
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,680
You too, Chewie.

363
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,360
Leia needs pilots, General.

364
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,360
My flying days are long gone.

365
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,880
But do me a favor...

366
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,920
give Leia my love.

367
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,320
You should
give it to her yourself.

368
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,560
Thank you.

369
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,680
There!
Those speeders.

370
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,080
How do you know
how to do that?

371
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,760
No need to worry.
I made it.

372
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,680
We gotta go.

373
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,720
<i>We've spotted the fugitives.</i>

374
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,840
Oh! They fly now!

375
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,240
They fly now?

376
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,760
They fly now.

377
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,320
Did we lose them?

378
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,960
- Looks like it!
- Excellent job, sir!

379
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,320
Terrible job, sir!

380
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,680
Not now, BB-8.

381
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,080
Never underestimate a droid.

382
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,240
Poe!

383
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,880
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

384
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,200
Right, ho!

385
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Ochi's ship.

386
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,680
I've seen that ship before.

387
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,760
Rey!

388
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,000
You get all
of them?

389
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,800
What the hell is this?

390
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,440
Sinking fields!
Try to grab something!

391
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,400
Will this agony ever end?

392
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Come on!

393
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,360
BB-8! No!

394
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,400
Rey.

395
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,720
Rey, I never told you...

396
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,560
What? Finn!

397
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,920
General.

398
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,960
We're getting reports
of a raid

399
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,320
at the Festival
of Ancestors.

400
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,840
This mission is everything.
We cannot fail.

401
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,600
Any word from Rey?

402
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,480
<i>Falcon's</i> not responding.

403
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,920
Do you have to say it
like that?

404
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,000
Like what?

405
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,440
Do me a personal favor?
Be optimistic.

406
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,600
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,560
Uh, this is...
This is terrific.

408
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,280
You're not gonna believe how
well this is gonna turn out.

409
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,520
It's gonna be great.

410
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,440
Rey! Finn!

411
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,560
You didn't say my
name, sir, but I'm all right.

412
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,760
- You all right?
- Yeah.

413
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,800
Where's Finn?

414
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,840
Where's Chewie?

415
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,560
I'm good.

416
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,040
Ah.
Master Finn.

417
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,360
What is this place?

418
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,800
This isn't
the afterlife, is it?

419
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,880
Are droids allowed here?

420
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,920
I thought
we were goners.

421
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,280
We might still be.

422
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,760
Which way out?

423
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,480
We have to hurry.

424
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,000
- So, what was it?
- What?

425
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,960
- What you were gonna tell me?
- When?

426
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,480
When you were sinking
in the sand, you said...

427
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,080
"I never told you..."

428
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,080
I'll tell you later.

429
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,920
You mean
when Poe's not here?

430
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,120
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

431
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,160
We're gonna die
in sand burrows

432
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,280
and we're all
keeping secrets?

433
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,520
I'll tell you
when you tell us

434
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,760
about all that shifty stuff
you do.

435
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,880
I do not wanna know
what made these tunnels.

436
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,240
Judging by
the circumference

437
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,360
of the tunnel walls...

438
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,920
I said
I do not wanna know.

439
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,160
Not.

440
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,320
What's that?

441
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,440
- Is that a speeder?
- What?

442
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,720
An old one.

443
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,560
Perhaps we will
find the driver.

444
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,960
Yep, BB-8, I think dead, too.

445
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,400
Oh, my.
A hex charm.

446
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
A what?

447
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,640
A common emblem
of Sith loyalists.

448
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,760
Sith.

449
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,000
This was Ochi's?

450
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,240
Luke sensed it.
Ochi never left this place.

451
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,640
And he ended up
down here.

452
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,960
He was headed
for his ship.

453
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,520
Same thing happened to us,
happened to him.

454
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,960
So, how did
Ochi get out?

455
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,920
He didn't.

456
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,400
No, he didn't.

457
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,760
Bones.

458
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,120
I don't like bones.

459
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,400
Bones?
Never a good sign.

460
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,720
Yeah, I see it.

461
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,920
Horrible things...

462
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,120
have happened with this.

463
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,800
There's writing on it.

464
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,080
Perhaps I can translate.

465
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,920
Oh. The location
of the wayfinder,

466
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,080
has been inscribed
upon this dagger.

467
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,800
It's the clue that Master
Luke was looking for.

468
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,760
- And?
- Where's the wayfinder?

469
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,560
I am afraid
I cannot tell you.

470
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,560
20.3 fazillion languages,
you can't read that?

471
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,120
Oh, I have read it, sir.

472
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,160
I know exactly
where the wayfinder is.

473
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,320
Unfortunately,
it is written

474
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,080
in the runic language
of the Sith.

475
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,400
So what?

476
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,480
My programming forbids
me from translating it.

477
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,880
So, you're telling us
the one time

478
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
we need you to talk,
you can't?

479
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,120
Irony, sir.

480
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,800
I am mechanically
incapable

481
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,520
of speaking translations
from Sith.

482
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,840
I believe the rule
was passed

483
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,120
by the Senate of
the Old Republic...

484
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,480
Serpent! Serpent! Serpent!

485
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,840
Rey.

486
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,680
- Finn.
- Shh.

487
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,240
- I'm gonna blast it.
- Don't blast it.

488
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,560
I just transferred
a bit of life.

489
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,400
Force energy
from me to him.

490
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,960
You would've done the same.

491
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,120
We cannot possibly fly
in that old wreck.

492
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,600
We gotta keep moving.

493
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,120
Find someone who can
translate that dagger.

494
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,760
Like a helpful droid.

495
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,280
I suggest we return to
the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> at once.

496
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,040
They'll be waiting for us
at the <i>Falcon.</i>

497
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,480
Yeah,
they'll throw us in the Pits of Griq.

498
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,920
Yeah. And use you
as a target droid.

499
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,880
You both make
excellent points, at times.

500
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,760
What is it?

501
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,280
I'll be right behind you.

502
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,120
It's okay.

503
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,840
Let's see what we got.

504
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,560
Let's get
those converters fired up.

505
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,360
What a filthy ship!

506
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,160
Look at that.

507
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,320
Where is she?

508
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,880
Finn,
help me out over here.

509
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,480
Chewie, tell Rey we gotta go.

510
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,320
What's she doing?

511
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,640
Where the hell's Chewie?

512
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,520
It's Ren.

513
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,720
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

514
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,600
<i>Get in the transport.</i>

515
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,760
<i>Move, animal!</i>

516
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,440
Rey!

517
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,960
Rey!

518
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,160
They got Chewie!
They got him!

519
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,200
Chewie!

520
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,360
No!

521
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,520
Rey!

522
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,120
We gotta go!
They're coming!

523
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,640
Rey, come on!

524
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,800
Rey!

525
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,280
- We gotta go!
- Chewie.

526
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Rey, come on!

527
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,040
I lost control.

528
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,720
It wasn't your fault.

529
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,720
It was.

530
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,920
No. It was Ren.
He made you do it.

531
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,360
Chewie's gone.

532
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,520
That power came from me.

533
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,560
Finn, there are things
you don't know.

534
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,520
Then tell me.

535
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,880
I, uh, had a vision.

536
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,280
Of the throne of the Sith.

537
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,160
And who was on it.

538
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,760
Ren?

539
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,520
And me.

540
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,480
We recovered
the scavenger's ship,

541
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,920
but she got away.

542
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,720
Under command
of the Knights of Ren,

543
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,040
we suffered losses.

544
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,640
- A transport was destroyed.
- I've seen the report.

545
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,200
That all?

546
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,880
No, Allegiant General.

547
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,680
There was another transport
in the desert.

548
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,080
It brought back
a valuable prisoner.

549
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,120
Prisoner?

550
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,600
The beast used to fly
with Han Solo.

551
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,480
Take it to Interrogation Six.

552
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,600
<i>Move it.</i>

553
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,120
We've only got
eight hours left.

554
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,480
So, what are we gonna do?

555
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,040
What can we do?
We gotta go back to base.

556
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,920
We don't have time to go back.
We are not giving up.

557
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,600
If we do that,
Chewie died for nothing.

558
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,880
Poe, Chewie
had the dagger!

559
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,200
Well, then we gotta
find another way.

560
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,680
Well, there isn't.
That was the only clue

561
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,000
to the wayfinder thing,
and it's gone.

562
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,240
So true.

563
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,440
The inscription lives
only in my memory now.

564
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,960
Hold on.

565
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,880
The inscription that was on
the dagger is in your memory?

566
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,280
Yes, Master Poe.

567
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,120
But the translation
from a forbidden language

568
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,520
cannot be retrieved.

569
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,520
That is short of a complete
redacted memory bypass.

570
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,760
A complete what?

571
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,160
It's a terribly
dangerous and sinful act...

572
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,040
performed on unwitting droids
by dregs and criminals.

573
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,280
Let's do that.

574
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,000
I know
a black market droidsmith.

575
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,320
Black market droidsmith?

576
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,120
- But he's on Kijimi.
- What's wrong with Kijimi?

577
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,680
I had a little bad luck
on Kijimi.

578
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,160
But if this mission fails,
it's all been for nothing.

579
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,880
All we've done,
all this time.

580
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,640
We're all in this.

581
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,120
Until the end.

582
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,400
For Chewie.

583
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,600
- Hands?
- Hands.

584
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,080
For Chewie.

585
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,800
Kijimi.

586
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,880
Battery charged.

587
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,120
Hello.

588
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,400
Hello.

589
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,160
- Hello.
- No... No, thank you.

590
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,080
Looks like someone
treated him badly.

591
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,880
It's all right.
You're with us now.

592
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,440
<i>U-A-T-T walker patrol,</i>

593
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,960
<i>head down thoroughfare 60.</i>

594
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,520
<i>Open up.
You're wanted for questioning.</i>

595
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,160
<i>Check this side of the street.</i>

596
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,920
<i>Door is locked.</i>

597
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,400
<i>Move on to the next one.</i>

598
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,200
<i>Give me
regular reports, please.</i>

599
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,640
<i>You, up against the wall.</i>

600
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,800
<i>Show me your identification.</i>

601
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,160
<i>Where is your identification?</i>

602
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,960
They're everywhere.

603
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,720
Please, leave her alone.
She didn't do anything.

604
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,200
All right,
I know what we should do.

605
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,800
So do I.
We should leave.

606
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,400
Clam it, Threepio.

607
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,560
Follow me.

608
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,880
All right.
Let's head down this way.

609
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,280
<i>Heard you were
spotted at Monk's Gate.</i>

610
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,240
<i>Thought, "He's not stupid
enough to come back here."</i>

611
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,680
Oh, you'd be surprised.

612
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,120
- Who's this?
- What's going on?

613
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,160
Guys, this is Zorii.
Zorii, this is Rey and Finn.

614
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,880
<i>I could pull this
trigger right now.</i>

615
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,480
- I've seen you do worse.
- <i>For a lot less.</i>

616
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,400
Can we just, uh...
talk about this?

617
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,640
<i>I wanna see your
brains in the snow.</i>

618
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,880
So, you're still mad?

619
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,240
Zorii, we could
use your help.

620
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,960
We gotta crack this droid's
head open and fast.

621
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,120
Pardon me!

622
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,480
We're trying to find
Babu Frik.

623
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,520
<i>Babu?
Babu only works with the crew.</i>

624
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,760
<i>That's not you anymore.</i>

625
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,000
What crew?

626
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,400
<i>Oh, funny
he never mentioned it.</i>

627
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,040
<i>Your friend's old job
was running spice.</i>

628
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,440
You were a spice runner?

629
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,040
- You were a stormtrooper?
- Were you a spice runner?

630
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,560
Were you a scavenger?
We could do this all night.

631
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,040
<i>You don't have
all night.</i>

632
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,320
<i>You know, I'm still digging
out of the hole you put me in</i>

633
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,200
<i>when you left
to join the Resistance.</i>

634
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,200
<i>You.</i>

635
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,840
<i>You're the one
they're looking for.</i>

636
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,880
<i>Bounty for her
just might cover us.</i>

637
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,760
- <i>Djak'kankah!</i>
- Don't <i>djak'kankah.</i>

638
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,640
We could really use
your help.

639
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,800
Please.

640
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,240
<i>Not that you care...</i>

641
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,920
<i>but I think you're okay.</i>

642
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,600
I care.

643
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,160
<i>T-18's online yet?</i>

644
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,680
<i>Yes, sir.
Scouting the perimeter.</i>

645
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,080
<i>Walkers.
Stay close by.</i>

646
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,000
Poe Dameron, spice runner.
Runner of spice.

647
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,680
- All right.
- Get your spice!

648
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,440
- Come on, Threepio.
- Oh.

649
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,040
<i>Babu's in the back.</i>

650
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,360
Don't mind us.

651
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,640
I haven't the faintest idea
why I agreed to this.

652
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,080
I must be malfunctioning.

653
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,400
Babu Frik?

654
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,040
Can you help us with this?

655
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,440
Zorii?
Is this gonna work?

656
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,640
<i>He says
he's found something</i>

657
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,880
<i>in your droid's
forbidden memory bank.</i>

658
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,520
<i>Words, translated
from Sith.</i>

659
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,640
- That's it.
- Yeah, that's what we need.

660
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,360
<i>Who are you hanging out
with that speaks Sith?</i>

661
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,840
Can you make him...

662
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,960
Babu, can you make him
translate it?

663
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,040
<i>Yes. But it will
cause a complete...</i>

664
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,600
A complete
memory wipe.

665
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,400
Wait, wait, wait.
We make him translate it...

666
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,800
he won't remember...
anything?

667
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,760
Droid, memory go blank.

668
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,920
- Oh!
- Blank, blank.

669
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,120
There must be
some other way.

670
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,520
Doesn't Artoo back up
your memory?

671
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,800
Oh, please.

672
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,720
Artoo's storage units
are famously unreliable.

673
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,760
You know the odds
better than any of us.

674
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,960
Do we have a choice?

675
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,640
If this mission fails...

676
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,280
it was all for nothing.

677
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,080
All we've done...

678
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,520
all this time.

679
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,520
What are you doing there,
Threepio?

680
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,120
Taking one last look,
sir...

681
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,520
at my friends.

682
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,400
Sad.

683
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,480
Uh-oh.

684
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,200
<i>Night raids
are gonna start soon.</i>

685
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,880
- <i>I'll keep lookout.</i>
- I'm coming with you.

686
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,400
<i>You still
don't trust me, huh?</i>

687
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,520
Did you
ever trust me?

688
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,760
<i>Nope.</i>

689
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,280
<i>Report,
General Pryde.</i>

690
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,560
There's been
a development, sir.

691
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,760
The Knights of Ren
have tracked the scavenger.

692
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,320
To a settlement
called Kijimi.

693
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,560
Shall we destroy
the city,

694
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,840
Supreme...?

695
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,800
I just had an idea.

696
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,520
There's something else
we could try.

697
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,080
How long's it been
like this?

698
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,120
<i>First Order took most
of the kids a long time ago.</i>

699
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,440
<i>Can't stand the cries
anymore.</i>

700
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,400
<i>I've saved up enough
to get out.</i>

701
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,680
<i>I'm going to the Colonies.</i>

702
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,600
How? All those hyperlanes
are blocked.

703
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,880
That's a First Order
Captain's medallion.

704
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,400
I've never seen a real one.

705
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,240
<i>Free passage
through any blockade.</i>

706
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,200
<i>Landing privileges,
any vessel.</i>

707
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,920
<i>Wanna come with me?</i>

708
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,360
I can't walk out
on this war.

709
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,000
Not till it's over.

710
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,400
Maybe it is.

711
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,160
We sent out a call for help
at the Battle of Crait.

712
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,720
Nobody came.

713
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,480
Everyone's so afraid.

714
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,360
They've given up.

715
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,160
<i>No, I don't believe
you believe that.</i>

716
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,600
<i>Hey.</i>

717
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,880
<i>They win by making you
think you're alone.</i>

718
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,720
<i>Remember?</i>

719
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,080
<i>There's more of us.</i>

720
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,920
Squeaky wheel.

721
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,560
I have a squeaky wheel.

722
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,400
Squeak eliminated.

723
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,120
Thank you.

724
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,320
Very kind.

725
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,160
Something's not right
about all of this.

726
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,400
Hmm?

727
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,640
I know
where I've seen it.

728
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,040
The ship he was on.
Ochi's ship.

729
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,400
What?

730
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,160
The day my parents left.

731
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,480
They were on that ship.

732
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,560
Are you sure?

733
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,040
<i>There's an
incoming Destroyer.</i>

734
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,440
We gotta go now.
Did we get it? Babu?

735
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,440
Yep. Droid is ready!

736
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,000
The Emperor's wayfinder

737
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,520
is in the Imperial vault.

738
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,560
At delta 3-6, transient
9-3-6, bearing 3-2...

739
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,920
on a moon
in the Endor system.

740
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,280
From the southern shore.

741
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,080
Only this blade tells.

742
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,480
Only this blade tells.

743
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,280
The Endor system.

744
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,400
Where the last war ended?

745
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,520
Rey!

746
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,000
Ren's Destroyer.

747
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,200
He's here?

748
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,600
Chewie?

749
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,320
What about him?

750
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,200
He's on Ren's ship.

751
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,680
He's alive.

752
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,280
What? How?

753
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,360
He's alive! He must've
been on a different transport.

754
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,760
We gotta go get him.

755
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,880
<i>Your friend's
on that sky trash?</i>

756
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,200
I guess he is.

757
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,520
Might I introduce myself.

758
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,840
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg
relations. And you are?

759
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,960
Okay, that's gonna be
a problem.

760
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,480
Hello.
I Babu Frik.

761
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,880
Why, hello!

762
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,600
Threepio, move your metal ass.
We're almost there.

763
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,760
How dare you!
We've only just met.

764
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,880
<i>Poe.</i>

765
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,160
<i>Might get you
on a capital ship.</i>

766
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,360
<i>Go help your friend.</i>

767
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,120
Zorii, I don't think
I can take this.

768
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,880
<i>I don't care
what you think.</i>

769
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,560
We have to go. Now.

770
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,640
- Come with us.
- <i>Poe.</i>

771
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,720
Can I kiss you?

772
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,960
<i>Go.</i>

773
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,560
We've done nothing wrong!

774
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,000
<i>No sudden moves.</i>

775
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,560
<i>What is that? Stop moving.</i>

776
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,240
Medallion's good.

777
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,120
Clear for entrance
into hangar 12.

778
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,200
Hang on, Chewie.

779
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,640
We're coming.

780
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,120
Whoever this Chewie
person is, this is madness!

781
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,200
<i>Credentials and manifest.</i>

782
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,880
<i>Close the blast doors.</i>

783
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,840
- You three, stay there.
- Happily.

784
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,840
Which way?

785
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,280
Uh, no idea. Follow me.

786
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,400
<i>Drop your weapons.</i>

787
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,280
It's okay that we're here.

788
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,560
<i>It's okay that you're here.</i>

789
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,960
<i>It's good.</i>

790
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,400
You're relieved
that we're here.

791
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,520
<i>Thank goodness you're here.</i>

792
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,600
<i>Welcome, guys.</i>

793
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,920
Does she do that to us?

794
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,840
We're looking for a prisoner
and his belongings.

795
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,680
The cameras.

796
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,400
They said
Chewie's this way.

797
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,360
Rey, come on.

798
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,440
The dagger is on this ship.
We need it.

799
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,360
Why?

800
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,840
A feeling. I'll meet you
back at the hangar.

801
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,040
Rey, you can't just...

802
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,160
Chewie.

803
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,560
<i>Search the city again.</i>

804
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,800
<i>She's close.</i>

805
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,400
Of course
we came for you, Chewie.

806
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,160
Yeah, Rey's here.
She's gonna get the dagger.

807
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,280
Whose ship is this?

808
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,520
The ship's this way.
Follow me.

809
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,640
<i>Over here!</i>

810
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,680
Wrong way!

811
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,600
There's not really
a right way, is there?

812
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,800
<i>I found them.</i>

813
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,160
<i>Blast them!</i>

814
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,240
<i>Over here!</i>

815
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,200
<i>There they are.
Get them!</i>

816
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,920
- We close?
- Straight ahead.

817
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,080
<i>Blast them!</i>

818
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,040
<i>Halt!</i>

819
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,720
Poe!

820
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,640
Are you okay?

821
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,440
Nope.

822
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,240
<i>You there, hands up!</i>

823
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,080
<i>Drop your weapons now!</i>

824
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,520
<i>Put your weapons down!</i>

825
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,120
<i>Drop them!</i>

826
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,880
<i>Drop them now!</i>

827
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,640
Hey, fellas.

828
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,680
<i>Shut up, scum.</i>

829
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,440
<i>No!</i>

830
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,680
<i>No!</i>

831
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,920
No.

832
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,200
<i>Rey.</i>

833
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,960
<i>Wherever you are...</i>

834
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,720
<i>you are hard to find.</i>

835
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,480
You're hard to get rid of.

836
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,480
<i>I pushed you in the desert,</i>

837
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,320
<i>because I needed to see it.</i>

838
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,400
<i>I needed you to see it.</i>

839
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,960
<i>Who you are.</i>

840
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,120
<i>I know
the rest of your story.</i>

841
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,080
<i>Rey.</i>

842
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,760
You're lying.

843
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,960
<i>I never lied to you.</i>

844
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,480
<i>Your parents were no one.</i>

845
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,120
<i>They chose to be.</i>

846
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,400
<i>To keep you safe.</i>

847
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,520
Don't!

848
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,400
<i>You remember
more than you say.</i>

849
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,760
<i>I've been in your head.</i>

850
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,800
I don't want this!

851
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,880
<i>Search your memories.</i>

852
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,920
No!

853
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,520
<i>Remember them.</i>

854
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,840
<i>See them.</i>

855
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,840
My love.
Rey, be brave.

856
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,720
You'll be safe here.

857
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,600
I promise.

858
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,560
Come back!

859
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,520
No!

860
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,160
<i>They sold you
to protect you.</i>

861
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,120
Stop talking.

862
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,320
<i>Rey, I know
what happened to them.</i>

863
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,880
<i>Move it.</i>

864
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,640
<i>Allegiant General,</i>

865
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,880
<i>the scavenger is not
with them.</i>

866
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,000
Take them away.
Terminate them.

867
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,680
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>

868
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,040
<i>You don't know
the whole story.</i>

869
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,000
<i>It was Palpatine
who had your parents taken.</i>

870
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,400
<i>He was looking for you.</i>

871
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,080
<i>But they wouldn't say
where you were.</i>

872
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,480
<i>So he gave the order.</i>

873
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,080
She isn't on Jakku.
She's gone.

874
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,200
No!

875
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,680
No!

876
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,440
<i>So that's where you are.</i>

877
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,280
<i>You know why the Emperor's
always wanted you dead.</i>

878
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,760
No.

879
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,160
<i>I'll come tell you.</i>

880
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,840
<i>She was in my quarters.
Lock down the ship.</i>

881
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,760
Actually...

882
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,880
I'd like to do this myself.

883
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,680
What were you gonna
tell Rey before?

884
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,160
You still on that?

885
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,480
Oh, I'm sorry,
is this a bad time?

886
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,120
Yeah.
Sort of is a bad time, Poe.

887
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,600
Well, 'cause later doesn't
really look like an option.

888
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,720
If you're gonna let
something off your chest,

889
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,960
maybe now's not
the worst time to...

890
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,400
I'm the spy.

891
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,040
- What?
- You?

892
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,480
We don't have much time.

893
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,600
I knew it.

894
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,040
No, you did not.

895
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,000
<i>What's your operating number?</i>

896
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,920
<i>That's not even a language.</i>

897
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,000
Oh, dear!
My first laser battle.

898
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,320
- Where are the others?
- They haven't come back.

899
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,400
Find them.

900
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,960
- Go.
- Yes.

901
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,840
Friends ahead.

902
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,200
Oh, yes,
there they are!

903
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,560
BB-8, come on!

904
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:51,760
I'll shut down the
impeders. You've got seconds.

905
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,400
There she is.

906
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,240
She's a survivor.

907
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,480
Wait. Wait.

908
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,360
- Blast me in the arm. Quick.
- What?

909
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,520
Or they'll know.

910
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,320
No! Ahh!

911
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,040
Why are you helping us?

912
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,120
I don't care if you win.

913
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,720
I need Kylo Ren to lose.

914
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,720
Why did the Emperor
come for me?

915
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,160
Why did he want
to kill a child?

916
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,720
Tell me.

917
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,880
<i>Because he saw
what you would become.</i>

918
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,680
<i>You don't just have power.</i>

919
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,200
<i>You have his power.</i>

920
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,440
<i>You're his granddaughter.</i>

921
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,240
<i>You are a Palpatine.</i>

922
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,280
<i>My mother
was the daughter of Vader.</i>

923
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,320
<i>Your father
was the son of the Emperor.</i>

924
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,200
<i>What Palpatine
doesn't know</i>

925
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,680
<i>is we're a dyad
in the Force, Rey.</i>

926
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,560
<i>Two that are one.</i>

927
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,440
<i>We'll kill him together
and take the throne.</i>

928
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,080
You know
what you need to do.

929
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,320
You know.

930
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,280
I do.

931
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,640
Hold her steady.

932
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,160
Finn, move fast!

933
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,880
Rey!

934
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,840
Come on!

935
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,920
Come on!
I got you!

936
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,080
It was a coordinated
incursion, Allegiant General.

937
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,440
They overpowered the guards

938
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,080
and forced me
to take them to their ship.

939
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,520
I see.

940
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,840
Get me the Supreme Leader.

941
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,960
Yes, sir.

942
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,920
Tell him we found our spy.

943
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,320
I don't know why
they're not following us,

944
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,360
but I don't trust it.

945
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,120
Landing gear's busted?
How busted?

946
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,680
All that matters is the wayfinder.
Finding Exegol.

947
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,280
That's what we're doing.

948
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,720
He killed my mother.

949
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,800
And my father.

950
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,760
I'm going to find
Palpatine...

951
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,520
and destroy him.

952
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,760
Rey...

953
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,240
that doesn't sound
like you.

954
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,040
Rey, I know you...

955
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,960
People keep telling me
they know me.

956
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,080
I'm afraid no one does.

957
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:33,520
<i>The Jedi
apprentice still lives.</i>

958
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,360
<i>Perhaps you
have betrayed me.</i>

959
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:41,360
<i>Do not make me
turn my fleet against you.</i>

960
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,440
<i>I know where she's going.</i>

961
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,720
<i>She'll never be a Jedi.</i>

962
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,320
<i>Make sure of it.</i>

963
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,680
<i>Kill her.</i>

964
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,720
What...
What is that?

965
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,960
It's the Death Star.

966
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,240
A bad place
from an old war.

967
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,720
It's gonna take us years to
find what we're looking for.

968
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,760
Oh, dear.

969
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,800
"Only this blade tells."

970
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,920
The wayfinder's there.

971
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,120
Heads up.

972
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,640
Rough landing.

973
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,760
- I've seen worse.
- I've seen better.

974
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,040
Are you Resistance?

975
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,640
That depends.

976
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,880
We picked up a transmission
from someone named Babu Frik.

977
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,320
Babu Frik? Oh,
he's one of my oldest friends.

978
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,880
He said you'd come.

979
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,600
He said
you were the last hope.

980
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,880
We have to get to that wreck.

981
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,640
There is something
inside there we need.

982
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,040
I can take you there
by water.

983
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,040
- Have you seen the water?
- Not now.

984
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,560
Too dangerous.

985
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:52,880
We can go
first light tomorrow.

986
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,040
We can't wait that long.
We don't have the time.

987
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,680
Or the choice.

988
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,400
Let's get that ship fixed.

989
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,760
Do you have any spare parts?

990
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,880
Some.

991
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,280
- I'm Jannah.
- I'm Poe.

992
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,920
Hello.

993
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,480
No, thank you. No, thank you.

994
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,360
What a dreadful situation.

995
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,720
Is every day like this
for you people?

996
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,760
Madness.

997
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,520
Did we ever find
his volume control?

998
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,720
It's an O-6,
but should work.

999
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,000
Thank you.

1000
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,520
This is a First Order part.

1001
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,480
There's an old cruiser
on the west ridge.

1002
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,720
Stripped for parts.

1003
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,480
The one we were assigned to.

1004
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,520
The one we escaped in.

1005
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,840
Okay, wait.
You were First Order?

1006
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:45,840
Not by choice.

1007
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,120
We were conscripted
as kids. All of us.

1008
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,720
I was TZ-1719.
Stormtrooper.

1009
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,080
FN-2187.

1010
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,000
You?

1011
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,440
I never knew
there were more.

1012
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,640
Deserters? All of us here
were stormtroopers.

1013
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,360
We mutinied at the battle
of Ansett Island.

1014
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,440
They told us
to fire on civilians.

1015
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,560
We wouldn't do it.

1016
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,360
We laid our weapons down.

1017
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,160
- All of you?
- The whole company.

1018
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,680
I don't even know
how it happened.

1019
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,440
It wasn't a decision, really,
it was like...

1020
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,400
An instinct.

1021
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,640
Feeling.

1022
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,560
A feeling.

1023
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,440
The Force.

1024
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,040
The Force
brought me here.

1025
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,720
It brought me to Rey.
And Poe.

1026
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,120
You say that
like you're sure it's real.

1027
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,720
It's real.

1028
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,240
I wasn't sure then...

1029
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,320
but I am now.

1030
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,840
What is it, buddy?

1031
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,840
What do you mean
you haven't seen her?

1032
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,000
She took the skimmer?

1033
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,720
What the hell
was she thinking?

1034
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,640
Poe, we gotta go
after her.

1035
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:43,920
We'll get
the <i>Falcon</i> fixed,

1036
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,280
and get out there
as fast as we can.

1037
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,800
No,
we're gonna lose her.

1038
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,840
Look, she left us!
What do you wanna do? Swim?

1039
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,960
She's not herself.

1040
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,120
You have no idea
what she's fighting.

1041
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,280
And you do?

1042
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,440
Yeah, I do.

1043
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,400
And so does Leia.

1044
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,440
Well, I'm not Leia.

1045
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,880
That's for damn sure.

1046
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,720
Finn.

1047
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,800
There's another skimmer.

1048
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,120
Don't be afraid
of who you are.

1049
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,760
Look at yourself.

1050
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,760
You wanted to prove to my
mother that you were a Jedi...

1051
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,560
but you've proven
something else.

1052
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,880
You can't go back to her now.

1053
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,960
Like I can't.

1054
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,120
Give it to me.

1055
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,480
The dark side
is in our nature.

1056
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,680
Surrender to it.

1057
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,600
Give it...

1058
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,760
to me.

1059
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,840
The only way you're getting
to Exegol is with me.

1060
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,640
No!

1061
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:04,240
Leia knows
what must be done, Artoo.

1062
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,120
To reach her son now...

1063
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:10,680
will take all the strength
she has left.

1064
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,280
Rey!

1065
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,800
Rey!

1066
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,560
No!

1067
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,280
No, we can't follow them!

1068
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,240
- I can't leave her!
- We can't!

1069
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,280
Rey!

1070
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,080
Ben.

1071
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,040
Leia.

1072
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,160
I did want
to take your hand.

1073
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,080
Ben's hand.

1074
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,720
Goodbye, dear princess.

1075
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,840
Poe,
something's happened.

1076
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,320
- Finn.
- This can't wait.

1077
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,200
We've gotta see
the General.

1078
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,080
She's gone.

1079
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,160
Chewie...

1080
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,880
Hey, kid.

1081
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,320
I miss you, son.

1082
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,480
Your son is dead.

1083
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,840
No.

1084
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,720
Kylo Ren is dead.

1085
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,440
My son is alive.

1086
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,160
You're just a memory.

1087
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,440
Your memory.

1088
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,720
Come home.

1089
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,360
It's too late.

1090
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,440
She's gone.

1091
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:22,160
Your mother's gone.

1092
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:24,880
But what she stood for,
what she fought for...

1093
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,720
that's not gone.

1094
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,680
Ben.

1095
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,320
I know
what I have to do...

1096
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,240
but I don't know if I have
the strength to do it.

1097
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,800
You do.

1098
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,640
Dad...

1099
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,680
I know.

1100
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:33,520
<i>The Princess of Alderaan
has disrupted my plan...</i>

1101
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,720
<i>but her foolish act
will be in vain.</i>

1102
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:41,560
<i>Come to me on Exegol,
General Pryde.</i>

1103
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,160
As I served you
in the old wars,

1104
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,760
I serve you now.

1105
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:52,000
<i>Send a ship
to a world they know.</i>

1106
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,480
<i>Let it burn.</i>

1107
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,960
<i>The Final Order begins.</i>

1108
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,400
<i>She will come,
her friends will follow.</i>

1109
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,800
Yes, my lord.

1110
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,440
Levels
holding steady at 85%.

1111
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,560
Captain.

1112
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,920
- Kijimi is in range.
- Fire.

1113
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,800
<i>Kijimi? How?</i>

1114
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,160
A blast
from a Star Destroyer.

1115
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,760
A ship from
the new Sith fleet.

1116
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,240
Out of the Unknowns.

1117
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,680
The Emperor sent a ship
from Exegol.

1118
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,200
Does that mean every ship
in the fleet...

1119
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,760
Has planet-killing weapons.
Of course they do.

1120
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,000
All of them.

1121
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,760
This is how he finishes it.

1122
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,120
Listen.

1123
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,960
It's on every frequency.

1124
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,720
"The Resistance is dead.

1125
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,480
"The Sith flame will burn.

1126
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,520
"All worlds,
surrender or die.

1127
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:15,280
"The Final Order begins."

1128
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,800
Leia made you acting general.

1129
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,520
What now?

1130
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,840
I gotta tell you,
I don't really know...

1131
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,160
how to do this.

1132
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,160
What you did...

1133
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,600
I'm not ready.

1134
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,400
Neither were we.

1135
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:46,640
Luke, Han, Leia, me...

1136
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,600
Who's ever ready?

1137
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,400
How'd you do it?

1138
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:55,400
Defeat an empire
with almost nothing.

1139
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,880
We had each other.

1140
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,680
That's how we won.

1141
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,600
Hey, don't touch that.
That's my friend's.

1142
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,640
Sorry.
She is gone?

1143
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,560
Yeah, she's gone.

1144
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,800
I don't know where.

1145
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,120
I miss her.

1146
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,360
I miss her, too.

1147
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,520
So, what's your name?

1148
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,080
I gotta talk to you
about something.

1149
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,640
I can't do this alone.

1150
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:23,080
I need you in command
with me.

1151
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,040
This droid has...
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1152
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,320
- General.
- General.

1153
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,240
This droid has a ton
of information about Exegol.

1154
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:29,920
- Wait, what? Cone-face?
- I am D-O.

1155
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:30,960
Sorry, D-O.

1156
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,360
He was going to Exegol
with Ochi of Bestoon.

1157
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,800
Why was Ochi going there?

1158
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,080
To bring the little girl

1159
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,560
he was supposed to take
from Jakku to the Emperor.

1160
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,520
He wanted her alive.

1161
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:31,960
A Jedi's weapon
deserves more respect.

1162
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:36,200
Master Skywalker.

1163
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,880
What are you doing?

1164
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,520
I saw myself
on the dark throne.

1165
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,040
I won't let it happen.

1166
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,640
I'm never leaving this place.
I'm doing what you did.

1167
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,200
I was wrong.

1168
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,600
It was fear
that kept me here.

1169
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,840
What are you most afraid of?

1170
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,120
Myself.

1171
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,880
Because you're a Palpatine.

1172
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,800
Leia knew it, too.

1173
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:11,280
She didn't tell me.

1174
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,720
She still trained me.

1175
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,480
Because she saw
your spirit.

1176
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:25,040
Your heart.

1177
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:28,840
Rey.

1178
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,240
Some things are stronger
than blood.

1179
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:36,720
Confronting fear
is the destiny of a Jedi.

1180
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,360
Your destiny.

1181
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,400
If you don't face
Palpatine...

1182
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,560
it will mean the end
of the Jedi.

1183
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,880
And the war will be lost.

1184
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,080
There's something my sister
would want you to have.

1185
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,400
Leia's saber.

1186
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:12,560
It was the last night
of her training.

1187
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,960
<i>Leia told me that she had
sensed the death of her son</i>

1188
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:35,480
<i>at the end of her Jedi path.</i>

1189
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:39,320
<i>She surrendered her saber
to me and said that one day...</i>

1190
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:41,400
it would be picked up
again...

1191
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,400
by someone who would
finish her journey.

1192
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:49,520
A thousand generations
live in you now.

1193
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:53,320
But this is your fight.

1194
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:56,080
You'll take both sabers
to Exegol.

1195
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,640
I can't get there.

1196
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:02,480
I don't have the wayfinder.
I destroyed Ren's ship.

1197
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,880
You have everything you need.

1198
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:15,960
Two were made.

1199
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,800
Oh, hello. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1200
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,080
And you are?

1201
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,520
What?

1202
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,640
Well, I am quite certain
I would remember

1203
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,120
if I had a best friend.

1204
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,280
You want to put what
in my head?

1205
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,640
Under no circumstances...

1206
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:33,520
Memory restoration complete.

1207
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,120
Artoo, have you heard?

1208
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,800
I am going with Mistress Rey
on her very first mission.

1209
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,600
I already have?

1210
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,720
Picking up a signal?
From whom?

1211
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,760
All the information you need
for an airstrike on Exegol.

1212
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,000
Yeah, except
how to get there.

1213
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Are you seeing
these atmo readings?

1214
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
It's a mess out there.

1215
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,120
Magnetic crossfields.

1216
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,800
Gravity wells,
solar winds.

1217
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:58,960
How does a fleet
even take off from there?

1218
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,120
Terribly sorry.

1219
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:01,520
I'm afraid
Artoo's memory bank

1220
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,960
must be crossed
with his logic receptors.

1221
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:07,000
He says he is receiving
a transmission from

1222
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,280
Master Luke.

1223
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,480
That's an old craft ID.

1224
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:13,200
That's Luke Skywalker's
X-wing.

1225
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,240
It's transmitting
course marker signals

1226
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:17,040
on its way
to the Unknown Regions.

1227
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,320
It's Rey.

1228
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,240
<i>She's going to Exegol.</i>

1229
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,040
She's showing us.

1230
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:31,840
She's showing us
how to get there.

1231
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,880
Then we go together.

1232
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,520
Come on, buddy,
we need you.

1233
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,240
<i>As long as those
Star Destroyers are on Exegol</i>

1234
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:47,280
we can hit them.

1235
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:48,280
Hit them how?

1236
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:49,560
They can't activate
their shields

1237
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,920
until they leave atmosphere.

1238
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,200
Which isn't easy on Exegol.

1239
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:54,080
Ships that size
need help taking off.

1240
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,840
Nav can't tell
which way's up out there.

1241
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,320
So, how do the ships
take off?

1242
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:59,040
They use a signal
from a navigation tower,

1243
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,560
like this one.

1244
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:02,440
Except they won't.

1245
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:03,840
Air team's gonna
find the tower,

1246
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,200
ground team's
gonna blast it.

1247
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,920
- Ground team?
- I have an idea for that.

1248
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,840
Once the tower's down,
the fleet will be stuck in atmo...

1249
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:09,880
for just minutes,

1250
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:11,640
with no shields,
and no way out.

1251
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:12,840
We think hitting the cannons

1252
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:14,720
might ignite
the main reactors.

1253
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,160
That's our chance.

1254
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,960
We need to pull
some Holdo maneuvers.

1255
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,280
Do some real damage.

1256
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:20,920
Come on.
That move is one in a million.

1257
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:22,280
Fighters and freighters
can take out their cannons

1258
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,640
if there are enough of us.

1259
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,160
There aren't enough of us!

1260
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:27,160
He's right. We'd be
no more than bugs to them.

1261
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,160
That's where Lando
and Chewie come in.

1262
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:31,360
They'll take the <i>Falcon</i>
to the Core Systems.

1263
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,720
Send out a call for help
for anybody listening.

1264
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,000
We've got friends
out there.

1265
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,560
They'll come if they
know there's hope.

1266
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,040
They will.

1267
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:42,840
First Order wins by making
us think we're alone.

1268
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,360
We're not alone.

1269
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,800
Good people will fight
if we lead them.

1270
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,120
<i>Leia never gave up.</i>

1271
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,520
<i>And neither will we.</i>

1272
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,840
<i>We're gonna show them
we're not afraid.</i>

1273
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,560
<i>What our mothers
and fathers fought for...</i>

1274
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,480
<i>we will not let die.</i>

1275
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:09,960
<i>Not today.</i>

1276
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,800
<i>Today, we make
our last stand.</i>

1277
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,120
<i>For the galaxy.</i>

1278
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:19,200
<i>For Leia.</i>

1279
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,400
For everyone we've lost.

1280
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,280
They've taken enough of us.

1281
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,160
Now we take the war to them.

1282
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,160
<i>She's on approach.</i>

1283
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:58,880
<i>All ships rise
to deployment altitude.</i>

1284
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,920
I know
it's a rough ride...

1285
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:40,400
but stay locked
on Rey's course.

1286
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,600
<i>Clear run frequency.</i>

1287
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,880
<i>Captain, we have
Resistance craft incoming.</i>

1288
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,000
Allegiant General...

1289
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,320
<i>Use ion cannons!</i>

1290
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,840
Look at that fleet.

1291
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:03,920
Damn it!

1292
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:06,840
Welcome to Exegol.

1293
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,400
Watch your starboard, Wexley!

1294
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,560
- Whoa!
- Get to their altitude.

1295
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,560
They can't fire on us
without hitting each other.

1296
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,960
Don't give up.

1297
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,440
Help is coming.

1298
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:22,840
There it is.

1299
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,560
Poe, I see it.

1300
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:25,840
I've got a visual
on the tower.

1301
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,480
- Incoming TIEs!
- I see 'em!

1302
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,600
I got you, Finn.

1303
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:21,600
- You ready back there?
- Never been readier.

1304
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,840
They're targeting
the navigation tower...

1305
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,000
so the fleet can't deploy.

1306
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,360
Then we won't use
that tower.

1307
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,040
Switch over the source
of navigation signal

1308
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,280
to this ship.

1309
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,120
We'll guide
the fleet out ourselves.

1310
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:41,000
The navigation tower
has been deactivated.

1311
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,840
- What?
- Those ships need that signal.

1312
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,440
It's gotta be coming
from somewhere.

1313
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:46,160
<i>They figured out
what we're doing.</i>

1314
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,040
<i>Call off the ground invasion.</i>

1315
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:50,240
Wait.

1316
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:52,480
The nav signal's coming
from that command ship.

1317
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,040
That's our drop zone.

1318
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,320
How do you know?

1319
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:57,120
A feeling.

1320
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:58,840
You wanna launch
a ground invasion

1321
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,120
on a Star Destroyer?

1322
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,560
I don't want to,
but we can't take out

1323
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,720
that ship's nav system
from the air.

1324
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:04,080
Give us cover.

1325
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,440
We gotta keep that fleet
there till help arrives.

1326
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,800
- We hope.
- We hope.

1327
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,280
You heard the General.

1328
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,760
All Wings,
cover that lander.

1329
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,320
They've landed
a troop carrier.

1330
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,280
- Jam the speeders.
- I can't, sir.

1331
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:21,240
Why not?

1332
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,320
They're not using speeders.

1333
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,440
Not bad
for one lesson.

1334
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:32,760
You had a good teacher!

1335
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,040
Keep going!

1336
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:47,800
You're doing great, buddy!

1337
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,520
The tower's up ahead.

1338
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:54,240
Long have I waited.

1339
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:07,680
For my grandchild
to come home.

1340
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,400
I never wanted you dead.

1341
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:15,080
I wanted you here...

1342
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:17,320
Empress Palpatine.

1343
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:21,480
You will take the throne.

1344
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:28,440
It is your birthright
to rule here.

1345
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:32,080
It is in your blood.
Our blood.

1346
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:36,400
I haven't come
to lead the Sith...

1347
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,120
I have come
to end them.

1348
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:40,080
As a Jedi?

1349
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,640
- Yes.
- No.

1350
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:46,520
Your hatred, your anger.

1351
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,880
You want to kill me.

1352
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:52,080
That is what I want.

1353
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,920
Kill me...

1354
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:58,440
and my spirit
will pass into you.

1355
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:02,120
As all the Sith
live in me...

1356
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:04,960
you will be Empress...

1357
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,120
we will be one.

1358
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:16,160
Those thrusters are hot.
How are we doing?

1359
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,640
We're gonna blow our way in,
and take out that nav tower.

1360
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,080
All the hatches
are blast-proof!

1361
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:21,480
All right, BB-8,
you're up!

1362
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:22,840
I'll cover you.

1363
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,560
This should do it.

1364
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:04,120
There it goes.

1365
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:06,800
Nice one, Finn.

1366
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,920
Nav signal's down,
but not for long.

1367
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,320
We're offline, sir.

1368
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:12,720
Reset the navigation signal!

1369
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:13,720
Minutes away, sir.

1370
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:17,400
- Finn, let's go!
- No, no, wait, listen.

1371
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:18,640
The crown cannons
have stopped.

1372
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:19,760
They're resetting
their systems.

1373
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:22,320
- So?
- I gotta go do something.

1374
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,640
I'm staying with you.

1375
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,080
Still no <i>Falcon</i> or backup.

1376
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,520
I don't know, Artoo.
Maybe nobody else is coming.

1377
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:33,680
What do we do, General?

1378
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,400
We gotta hit them ourselves.

1379
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,480
What can we do
against these things?

1380
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:39,360
<i>Just stay alive!</i>

1381
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,760
The time has come!

1382
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:56,520
With your hatred,
you will take my life.

1383
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:58,520
And you will ascend.

1384
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,240
All you want is for me
to hate, but I won't.

1385
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:05,280
Not even you.

1386
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:09,320
Weak.
Like your parents.

1387
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,200
My parents were strong.

1388
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,080
They saved me from you.

1389
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:19,480
Your Master, Luke Skywalker,
was saved by his father.

1390
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:22,920
The only family
you have here...

1391
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:24,720
is me.

1392
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:48,240
They don't have long.

1393
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:51,600
<i>No one is coming
to help them.</i>

1394
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:55,440
<i>And you are the one
who led them here.</i>

1395
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:00,040
<i>Strike me down.
Take the throne.</i>

1396
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:02,320
<i>Reign over the new Empire...</i>

1397
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:05,040
<i>and the fleet will be yours.</i>

1398
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:10,480
<i>Only you have the power
to save them.</i>

1399
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:17,040
<i>Refuse,
and your new family...</i>

1400
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,760
dies.

1401
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,520
Good.

1402
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:50,680
Ow.

1403
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:56,720
Finn, where are you?
The lander's leaving.

1404
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:59,240
- <i>Finn!</i>
- Go without us.

1405
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,080
We're taking
this entire ship down.

1406
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:04,120
What? How?

1407
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:05,520
<i>We're gonna hit
the command deck.</i>

1408
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:09,080
Rose, please. Go.

1409
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,600
- Rose!
- Rose!

1410
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,160
I'll get the trigger!

1411
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,000
The ritual begins.

1412
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:22,440
She will strike me down...

1413
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:25,760
and pledge herself
as a Sith.

1414
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,680
<i>She will draw her weapon.</i>

1415
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:52,680
She will come to me.

1416
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,760
She will take her revenge.

1417
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:16,720
And with a stroke
of her saber...

1418
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:19,480
the Sith are reborn!

1419
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:23,280
The Jedi are dead!

1420
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:44,800
Do it!

1421
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:47,080
Make the sacrifice!

1422
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:57,400
Stand together,
die together.

1423
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:09,240
The lifeforce of your bond...

1424
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:14,880
a dyad in the Force.

1425
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:18,040
A power like life itself.

1426
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:22,360
Unseen for generations.

1427
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:24,160
And now...

1428
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:30,440
the power of two restores
the one, true Emperor.

1429
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:52,080
<i>Snap,
they're on your tail.</i>

1430
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,080
Yeah, I see 'em!

1431
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:55,040
No, no, no, Snap, Snap!

1432
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:56,480
No!

1433
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:00,960
<i>Alpha Three is down.</i>

1434
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,400
<i>They're on my tail!
I can't get...</i>

1435
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:05,120
<i>They're everywhere!</i>

1436
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,280
<i>Delta leader's hit!</i>

1437
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,320
<i>Losing altitude!</i>

1438
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,080
<i>General,
what's our next move?</i>

1439
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:14,160
<i>Poe, what now?</i>

1440
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:15,520
My friends...

1441
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:18,960
I'm sorry.

1442
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:21,680
I thought we had a shot.

1443
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:26,160
But there's just
too many of them.

1444
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:28,720
<i>But there are
more of us, Poe.</i>

1445
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,480
<i>There are more of us.</i>

1446
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:44,560
Look at this.

1447
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:55,800
Lando, you did it.
You did it!

1448
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:59,240
Hit those underbelly cannons.

1449
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:01,720
Every one we knock out
is a world saved.

1450
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:05,840
Nice flying, Lando.

1451
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:17,360
We have a ship down.
We lost a Destroyer.

1452
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,920
Systems not responding.

1453
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:20,000
Where did they get
all these fighter craft?

1454
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,200
They have no navy.

1455
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:24,080
It's not a navy, sir,
it's just people.

1456
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,360
<i>So long, sky trash!</i>

1457
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:37,560
Who's that flyer?

1458
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:39,880
<i>Take a guess,
spice runner.</i>

1459
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:44,400
Ha! Zorii! You made it!

1460
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:59,800
Look what you have made.

1461
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:21,080
As once I fell...

1462
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:25,080
so falls
the last Skywalker.

1463
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:35,560
Do not fear
that feeble attack...

1464
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:37,760
my faithful.

1465
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:41,560
Nothing will stop
the return of the Sith!

1466
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,640
Artoo, my systems
are failing.

1467
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:56,920
Does anyone copy?

1468
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:38,240
Be with me.

1469
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:44,440
Be with me.

1470
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:51,640
Be with me.

1471
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:57,920
<i>These are
your final steps, Rey.</i>

1472
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:00,680
<i>Rise and take them.</i>

1473
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:02,560
- <i>Rey.</i>
- <i>Rey.</i>

1474
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:03,920
<i>Rey.</i>

1475
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:05,560
<i>Bring back
the balance, Rey, as I did.</i>

1476
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:08,080
<i>In the night,
find the light, Rey.</i>

1477
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,760
<i>You're not alone, Rey.</i>

1478
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:11,680
<i>Alone never have you been.</i>

1479
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:14,880
<i>Every Jedi
who ever lived lives in you.</i>

1480
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,080
<i>The Force surrounds you, Rey.</i>

1481
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:17,440
<i>Let it guide you.</i>

1482
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:18,920
<i>As it guided us.</i>

1483
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:20,560
<i>Feel the Force
flowing through you, Rey.</i>

1484
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:21,840
<i>Let it lift you.</i>

1485
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,520
<i>Rise, Rey.</i>

1486
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,160
<i>We stand behind you, Rey.</i>

1487
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:26,400
<i>Rey.</i>

1488
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,400
<i>Rise in the Force.</i>

1489
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:32,160
<i>In the heart of a Jedi
lies her strength.</i>

1490
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:34,440
- <i>Rise.</i>
- <i>Rise.</i>

1491
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:39,680
<i>Rey, the Force
will be with you, always.</i>

1492
01:53:57,120 --> 01:54:00,440
Let your death
be the final word...

1493
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:03,160
in the story of rebellion.

1494
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:15,880
I'm back on!
This is our last chance.

1495
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:17,920
We gotta hit
those cannons now!

1496
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:24,640
You are nothing!

1497
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:28,800
A scavenger girl is no
match for the power in me.

1498
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:35,520
I am all the Sith!

1499
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:39,960
And I...

1500
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,720
I'm all the Jedi.

1501
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,760
Poe, the command ship!

1502
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,680
<i>Their fleet is stuck here!</i>

1503
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:41,000
They're toast!
Come on!

1504
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:46,160
Finn, you seeing this?

1505
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:47,760
Finn didn't board
the lander.

1506
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:50,000
They're still
on that command ship?

1507
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:02,800
I see them.
I'm going to get them.

1508
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,280
General,
you won't make it.

1509
01:56:04,280 --> 01:56:05,600
Trust me, I'm fast!

1510
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:07,560
<i>Not as fast
as this ship.</i>

1511
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,400
Hold on, Chewie!

1512
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:23,160
Finn!

1513
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,880
No, Rey.

1514
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:17,520
Ben.

1515
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:37,720
<i>There, look!</i>

1516
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:39,920
Red Five is in the air.

1517
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:41,280
Rey's alive.

1518
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:44,400
I see her.

1519
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:47,080
<i>People are rising up
all over the galaxy.</i>

1520
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:50,200
<i>Poe. We did it.</i>

1521
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:51,200
We did it.

1522
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:47,280
Happy.

1523
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:52,280
Chewie!

1524
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:22,800
Hi!

1525
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:24,000
Good job!

1526
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:29,840
Chewie.

1527
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:34,200
This is for you.

1528
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,480
Did you hear that?

1529
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:20,560
Where are you from,
General?

1530
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,480
The Gold system.

1531
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:28,240
Well, what about you, kid?

1532
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:30,440
Oh.

1533
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:31,760
I don't know.

1534
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:35,320
Well, let's find out.

1535
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:11,280
There's been no one
for so long.

1536
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:13,480
Who are you?

1537
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:16,400
I'm Rey.

1538
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:18,560
Rey who?

1539
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:43,840
Rey Skywalker.

1540
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:05,640
