1
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,039
<i>It took the Earth's population</i>
<i>100,000 years to reach a billion people.</i>

2
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,156
<i>And then just 100 more</i>
<i>to reach two billion.</i>

3
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,596
<i>And only 50 years to double again.</i>

4
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,033
<i>Four billion people in 1970.</i>
<i>We're nearly at eight billion now.</i>

5
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,717
<i>We are destroying the very means</i>
<i>by which life is sustained.</i>

6
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,156
<i>Every single global ill</i>
<i>that plagues the Earth...</i>

7
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,358
<i>...can be traced back to human</i>
<i>overpopulation.</i>

8
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,959
<i>Why do we demand inaction?</i>

9
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,831
<i>We clear-cut. We dump.</i>
<i>We consume. We destroy.</i>

10
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,752
<i>Half the animal species on Earth</i>
<i>have vanished...</i>

11
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,639
<i>...in the last 40 years.</i>

12
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,793
<i>But still we keep attacking</i>
<i>our own environment.</i>

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,755
<i>Does it take a catastrophe</i>
<i>to learn our lesson? To get our attention?</i>

14
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,360
<i>Nothing changes behavior like pain.</i>

15
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,912
<i>Maybe pain can save us.</i>

16
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,953
<i>There's a switch.</i>

17
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,634
<i>If you throw it...</i>

18
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,472
<i>...half the people on Earth will die.</i>

19
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,355
<i>But if you don't...</i>

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,718
<i>...the human race will be extinct</i>
<i>in a hundred years.</i>

21
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,039
<i>What will you do?</i>

22
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,591
<i>Mankind is the cancer in its own body.</i>

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,354
<i>Do you love humanity enough to save it?</i>

24
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,273
<i>In case they find me, I left you a path.</i>

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,839
<i>The hardest one yet.</i>

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,034
<i>Inferno will be at the end.</i>

27
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,798
<i>You are my contingency plan.</i>

28
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,078
<i>You are humanity's final hope.</i>

29
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,475
<i>Make sure Inferno is unleashed.</i>

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,354
<i>Seek and find.</i>

31
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,440
Long road...

32
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,554
...but here we are.

33
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,633
Better me than the Americans.

34
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,717
You're going to want to tell me
where it is.

35
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,797
Yes, Mr. Bouchard.

36
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,149
I know I will.

37
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,637
<i>Tell them humanity is the disease.</i>

38
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,593
<i>Inferno is the cure.</i>

39
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,030
Traitors!

40
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,311
<i>Suffer, sinners. Pay for your sins.</i>

41
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,599
<i>Sinners, pay for your sins.</i>

42
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,510
<i>Pay for your sins.</i>

43
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,070
<i>Suffer, sinners. Pay for your sins.</i>

44
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,516
<i>Ruin of souls.</i>

45
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,237
- One moment, please.
- What is going...

46
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,874
- What is happening?
- Dr. Brooks?

47
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,032
<i>Abandon all hope.</i>

48
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,350
<i>All hope.</i>

49
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,919
<i>Sinners, pay for your sins.</i>

50
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,312
Mr. Langdon, I'm Dr. Brooks.

51
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,110
We're gonna do a few checks.
Nothing to worry about.

52
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,111
We'll get rid of this, shall we?

53
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,512
Do you know what day of the week it is?

54
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,840
Saturday.

55
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,711
It's Monday. 20th of June.

56
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,357
Monday, the 20th of June.

57
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,195
Do you know where we are?

58
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,200
Boston.

59
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,320
Mass General.

60
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,234
And what's the last thing
you can remember?

61
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,960
I was on campus.

62
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,154
Everything is blurry. It's out of focus.

63
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,359
Was I in some kind of an accident?

64
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,796
We'll get to that.

65
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,116
Is there someone we should call for you?

66
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,755
No.

67
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,116
Your wife? Family?

68
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,273
No, no. I'm not married.

69
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,355
Professor Langdon,
you're suffering from a head trauma.

70
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,831
You appear to have
mild retrograde amnesia.

71
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,070
We've done a CT scan.

72
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,675
There's no evidence
of intracranial bleeding.

73
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,400
Which is very reassuring, long-term.

74
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,358
Just try to relax.

75
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,679
Neurologically, you seem to be fine.

76
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,114
Your memory will return
over the next several days.

77
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,840
So we'll wait and watch.

78
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,197
Can you turn off the lights, please?

79
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,316
Of course.

80
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,473
If the head trauma was bad enough
to cause cerebral contusions...

81
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,030
- ...photosensitivity is common.
- Could you please turn off the lights?

82
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,680
What am I doing in Florence?

83
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,069
That's il Duomo.
That's the Palazzo Vecchio, isn't it?

84
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,796
Yes.

85
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,038
Well, how did I get here?

86
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,316
You came to our emergency room
three hours ago with a head wound.

87
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,031
Was I with a woman?

88
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,032
No, a cab driver brought you in.

89
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,198
No wallet, no phone, no ID.

90
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,513
How the heck do you know my name?

91
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,676
We've met.

92
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,396
I saw you lecture at Imperial College
London. We spoke afterwards.

93
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,674
You were very nice to me.

94
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,630
We met?

95
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,118
Sorry, that's not quite fair.
I was 9 at the time.

96
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,115
- Wait, 9 years old?
- I was crazy about puzzles.

97
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,079
And I liked your books.

98
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,834
Maybe not <i>Lost Language of Ideograms.</i>
But the others.

99
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,516
Okay.

100
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,109
I read them all.

101
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,600
What a weird kid.

102
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,159
I was, actually.

103
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,514
- Did I say that out loud?
- You did.

104
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,554
I'm very sorry.

105
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,675
Professor Langdon, the headaches
are going to be intense initially.

106
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,590
And you can also expect nausea,
confusion and dizziness.

107
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,557
That was the front desk.
The police are here to see you.

108
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,909
Me? Why?

109
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,960
Before you talk to them, professor,
you should know all the facts of your case.

110
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,158
Your head wound wasn't caused by an
accident. It was the result of a gunshot.

111
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,392
A bullet grazed the top of your skull,
and you most likely took a bad fall...

112
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,875
...which is what caused the concussion.

113
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,115
If the bullet had been an inch
to the side, it could've killed you.

114
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,429
Come on, come on.

115
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,276
It's okay. It's okay. Come on.

116
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,959
Taxi!

117
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,396
Get in!

118
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,156
Is he drunk or what?

119
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,395
What was that?

120
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,469
Drive!

121
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,715
Drive! Drive!

122
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,793
- What's going on?
- No idea.

123
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,794
This is gonna hurt.

124
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,753
It's okay. It's okay.

125
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,679
<i>Robert.</i>

126
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,910
<i>Seek and find.</i>

127
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,995
<i>Seek and find.</i>

128
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,032
This is my apartment.

129
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,193
You're still in Florence.

130
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,592
- I'm gonna call the police.
- Wait up.

131
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,760
A policewoman just tried to kill us.

132
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,879
Okay. We'll call the U.S. Consulate
instead if you like.

133
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,157
Just wait. Just give me...

134
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,913
Give me a minute.

135
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,670
Get a hold of things.

136
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,911
Why was someone shooting at you?

137
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,920
I don't know.

138
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,670
Also, when you came into E.R., you were
mumbling something over and over.

139
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,277
<i>Very sorry. Very sorry.</i>

140
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,757
<i>Very, very sorry.</i>

141
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,439
"Very sorry"?

142
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,356
Do you have any idea
why you'd be saying this?

143
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,590
No.

144
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,353
Why was someone shooting at you?

145
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,116
You can keep asking me these questions,
lady, but I'm not gonna know the answers!

146
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,794
My name's Sienna.

147
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,118
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

148
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,796
Hello.

149
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,395
Hi.

150
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,474
Just, you ask a lot of questions.

151
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,916
Yeah, I'm feeling a tad vulnerable
right now.

152
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,800
I'm with someone
other people want to shoot at.

153
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,235
I'm sorry.

154
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,276
Questions are important.
It'll help you recover.

155
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,274
Can I ask you for a cup of...?

156
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,114
Well, it's brown and it's hot...

157
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,512
...and people drink it in the morning
for energy.

158
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,311
- Tea.
- Tea. No! The other one.

159
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,073
- Coffee.
- Coffee!

160
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,597
Could I have a cup of coffee?

161
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,870
Sure.

162
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,115
Thank you.

163
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,957
You are very organized.

164
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,557
I like things tidy.

165
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,119
Thank you for helping me at the hospital.

166
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,112
That was very courageous.

167
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,112
It was just reflexes.

168
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,995
Very sorry.

169
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,716
Very...

170
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,880
...sorry.

171
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,314
I'm having visions.

172
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,598
It's the head trauma.

173
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,114
You won't be able to trust
your own thoughts for a while.

174
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,510
Saw a plague mask.

175
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,038
It's the kind that medieval doctors
wore during the Black Death.

176
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,873
You said something about that.

177
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,871
You were talking in the cab.
It was mostly incoherent...

178
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,358
...but I did hear the word "mask."

179
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,640
Anything else?

180
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,680
Bodies.

181
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,117
And blood and fire...

182
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,918
<i>...and hell.</i>

183
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,473
And there's a woman.

184
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,590
Yeah, there's a woman, and she seemed...

185
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,319
<i>Seek and find.</i>

186
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,360
It all seems so dangerous.

187
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,796
Look, you gotta have somebody
we should call.

188
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,315
I do?

189
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,756
Why?

190
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,317
Was I wearing my watch
when I was brought to the hospital?

191
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,550
No.

192
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,393
You weren't wearing a watch.

193
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,240
It was important to me.

194
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,159
It was a gift from my parents.

195
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,118
Look, you should go ahead and clean up.

196
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,120
Your clothes are covered in blood but I think
I've got something that might fit you.

197
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,797
Once you get dressed,
we'll call the police, okay?

198
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,189
No, no.

199
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,114
The consulate.

200
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,280
Right.

201
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,960
The consulate.

202
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,160
Coffee.

203
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,669
Ignazio?

204
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,958
"What we stole is safely hidden,
as am I. Paradise Twenty-five."

205
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,158
"Now they're after me too."

206
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,153
"Is safely hidden."

207
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,076
"As am I."

208
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,319
What we stole?

209
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,716
Ignazio?

210
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,516
I've left your things in the bathroom.

211
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,600
Try these.

212
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,434
Whose are they?

213
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,389
A friend's.

214
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,074
Does he live here?

215
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,600
Sometimes.

216
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,396
Sometimes, huh?

217
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,679
You're being rude.

218
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,992
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not like this.

219
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,873
You kind of are.

220
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,954
<i>I found this in my old jacket.</i>

221
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,873
It's a bio tube.

222
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,396
They're used to transport
dangerous substances.

223
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,720
What are you doing with it?

224
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,280
I have no idea.

225
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,274
It's a high-end unit.

226
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,510
Government issue.

227
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,954
It's got thumbprint recognition:

228
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,397
Security in case it's lost or stolen.

229
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,192
Tubes like this can only be opened
by a specified individual.

230
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,514
Well, it sure as hell isn't me.

231
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,797
- Then why do you have it?
- I don't know.

232
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,952
I'm getting the number for the consulate.

233
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,992
No, please. Wait.

234
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,277
I have waited. This isn't right.

235
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,152
Why do you have it? Where did you get it?

236
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,154
There is a simple way to find out
if this thing belongs to me.

237
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,959
Either my thumb will open it, or it won't.

238
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,793
Open it? Are you insane?

239
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,032
If it's a viral agent,
will it be released if I open it?

240
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,196
No.

241
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,514
No, there'd be an inner sleeve.
Maybe even two.

242
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,274
Before I put myself in anyone's hands,
I wanna know what this thing is...

243
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,998
...and what I'm involved with.

244
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,319
That makes sense, doesn't it?

245
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,390
Yes.

246
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,632
So we agree...

247
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,194
...we're opening it.

248
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,555
Well, that explains it. It is mine.

249
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,960
This is a cylinder seal...

250
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,710
...made of ivory.

251
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,116
No.

252
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,560
It's bone.

253
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,230
Human.

254
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,070
Three-headed, man-eating Satan.

255
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,709
A common image from the Middle Ages.

256
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,640
Associated with the Black Plague.

257
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,157
The three gnashing mouths are symbolic...

258
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,630
...of how effectively the plague
ate through the population.

259
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,071
Yet you can't remember
the word for coffee.

260
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,436
Explains my visions. Sort of.

261
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,560
You hear that?

262
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,112
This could be a Faraday pointer.

263
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,951
So why this?

264
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,993
It's Botticelli.

265
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,072
It's his <i>Map of Hell.</i>

266
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,318
He painted it as an illustration
of Dante's <i>Inferno.</i>

267
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,951
I studied Dante when I was younger.

268
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,073
Probably in kindergarten.

269
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,356
I was a bit obsessed.

270
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,793
Dante defined
our modern conception of hell.

271
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,556
Our vision of it hasn't changed
since he defined it 700 years ago.

272
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,869
Botticelli drew it
but Dante created hell as we know it.

273
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,479
This is what I have been seeing.

274
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,320
Torment.

275
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,275
Sinners.

276
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,393
Branded with letters.

277
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,320
Liars covered with rashes.

278
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,509
Soothsayers with their heads
ripped backwards.

279
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,110
- Serpents.
- The punishment for thievery.

280
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,873
<i>Suffer, sinners. Pay for your sins.</i>

281
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,111
So you have no idea why you have this.

282
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,352
I think maybe we call the consulate now.

283
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,230
Right.

284
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,956
<i>Professor Langdon?</i>

285
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,520
Hello, yes.

286
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,040
Speaking.

287
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,398
<i>Thank heavens you're alive.</i>
<i>We've been looking for you.</i>

288
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,360
You have?

289
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,120
<i>Are you still in possession?</i>

290
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,114
<i>Mr. Langdon, do you have the tube?</i>

291
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,392
- Yes.
<i>- Where are you located?</i>

292
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,515
<i>Professor, we can't help you</i>
<i>if we can't find you.</i>

293
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,031
That's the consulate.
Now, how did they know?

294
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,429
Because they know.

295
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,275
What do we do?

296
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,913
Tell them you're over there.

297
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,476
- Hello?
<i>- Professor, we were cut off.</i>

298
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,835
Yes, sorry.

299
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,990
<i>Where are you located?</i>

300
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,998
I am at a hotel.

301
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,795
Pensione La Fiorentina.

302
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,520
<i>Stay in your room.</i>
<i>We're sending someone now.</i>

303
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,799
Well, I'll wait here. Room 39.

304
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,676
Okay.

305
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,156
We wait and see who they send.

306
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,194
Langdon accessed his e-mail account...

307
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,431
...from an unmasked LP address
here in Florence.

308
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,711
- When?
- Seven minutes ago.

309
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,520
Via Dolorosa, number 12. Apartment 3C.

310
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,114
Via Dolorosa. How long?

311
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,430
Twelve minutes.

312
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,920
Go! I want that pointer back!

313
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,799
And I want Langdon. Whatever it takes.

314
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,758
Let's get him. Go, go, go. Now!

315
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,912
Look at this. This is odd.

316
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,510
This area here.
This is Dante's eighth level of hell.

317
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,479
It's called the <i>Malebolge.</i>
It means evil ditches.

318
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,040
There's ten of them.

319
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,239
This letter "R," here...

320
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,075
...is not in the original painting.

321
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,515
It's been added.

322
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,000
Here's another one.

323
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,112
- Where?
- An "E."

324
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,793
- On seducers whipped by demons.
- Here's a "C" on the cheek of a...

325
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,510
A grafter. A con man
trapped in a river of boiling tar.

326
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,876
- "V." "R."
- There.

327
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,271
- "T."
- There. "A."

328
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,156
What is that? I think that's text.
Is that in English?

329
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,717
"The truth...

330
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,996
...can be glimpsed only...

331
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,514
...through the eyes of...

332
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,070
...death.

333
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,873
Zobrist."

334
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,434
"Bertrand Zobrist...

335
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,759
...American billionaire."
That must be nice.

336
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,360
"Bioengineer notorious for radical views."

337
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,634
Here he is.

338
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,639
<i>It took the Earth's population</i>
<i>100,000 years to reach a billion people.</i>

339
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,839
And then just a hundred more
to reach two billion.

340
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,236
And only 50 years to double again...

341
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,555
<i>...to four billion people in 1970.</i>

342
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,473
We're nearly at eight billion now.

343
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,917
<i>Bartlett gives the example of a beaker.</i>

344
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,517
With a single bacterium in it, one
that divides and doubles every minute.

345
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,596
If you place the first bacterium into
the beaker at 11:00...

346
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,639
...and it's completely full by 12...

347
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,840
...at what time is the beaker
still only half full?

348
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,116
11:59.

349
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,796
<i>That's what time it is for us.</i>

350
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,314
In 40 years, 32 billion people...

351
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,716
...will fight to survive.

352
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,715
They'll fail.

353
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,078
We're a minute to midnight.

354
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,956
Every single global ill
that plagues the Earth...

355
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,557
<i>...can be traced back</i>
<i>to human overpopulation.</i>

356
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,310
<i>But serious birth control measures,</i>
<i>they don't stand a chance.</i>

357
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,158
"Outrageous! Violation of my rights!"

358
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,314
"Invasion of my privacy!"
"Don't tell me what to do!"

359
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,549
<i>And still, we keep attacking</i>
<i>our own environment.</i>

360
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,272
There have been five major extinctions...

361
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,079
<i>...in the Earth's history...</i>

362
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,352
...and unless we take bold,
immediate action...

363
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,877
...the sixth extinction...

364
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,159
...will be our own.

365
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,872
We're a minute to midnight.

366
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,274
- Looks like he's got a lot of followers.
- Yeah, from all over the world.

367
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,433
He is compelling.

368
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,439
"A two-year disappearance during which
some authorities feared Zobrist...

369
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,230
...may have designed
an opportunistic viral pathogen."

370
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,951
He created a plague.

371
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,394
But why Dante?

372
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,112
Why this map of hell? Is this supposed
to be a puzzle or a challenge?

373
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,714
Or a suicide note.

374
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,516
He killed himself three days ago.

375
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,196
The levels.

376
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,675
The levels are out of order.
That's what's been bothering me.

377
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,870
The circles of hell have been rearranged.

378
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,871
It's the same woman from the hospital.

379
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,472
We can't stay here. And we certainly
can't trust the consulate.

380
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,791
Flatterers adrift in excrement.
That's not right.

381
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,111
If a plague exists, do you know
how many governments would want it?

382
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,073
Clerical profiteers. Not there.

383
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,590
- And what they'd do to get it?
- Sowers of discord there? No.

384
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,830
A biological weapon?

385
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,430
The letters.

386
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,316
He has assigned a letter to each sin
and then changed their order.

387
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,755
He's made an anagram.

388
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,109
Yes! Anagram!

389
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,630
Let's go.

390
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,031
- I know another way out.
- E, C, R.

391
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,477
If you have a phone, best leave it here.

392
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,030
They might track it.

393
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,955
Phone? I'm not even
wearing my own clothes.

394
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,918
Good. Let's go.

395
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,119
Robert Langdon. World Health Organization.

396
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,760
V, R, O...

397
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,354
Gotta rearrange these letters.
Over, code, covered, cat.

398
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,078
I used to be good at this.

399
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,676
<i>Cerca trova.</i>

400
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,030
It's Italian.

401
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,520
It means "seek and find."

402
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,992
<i>"Cerca trova"?</i> Yes!

403
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,877
I know why I am in Florence.

404
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,760
<i>The World Health Organization</i>
<i>has landed. Stand by.</i>

405
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,713
Be advised: Agent Bouchard
from the Paris office is already here.

406
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,278
- W.H.O. Bring me up to speed.
- Bouchard is up there now.

407
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,076
Where are we going?

408
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,630
The Palazzo Vecchio.
Near the Boboli Gardens.

409
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,711
There's no sign of them. Bouchard says
Langdon is gone and so is the pointer.

410
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,600
Well, I need better.

411
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,514
I need better from you, from you,
from all of us.

412
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,950
Better!

413
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,109
Work faster. Work smarter.
Don't trust anyone!

414
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,754
Let's do that.

415
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,595
- Yes, ma'am. Let's travel.
- Yes.

416
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,755
We may be compromised.

417
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,357
Tell her people nothing. Understood?

418
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,510
<i>Identification?</i>

419
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,909
Vayentha.

420
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,190
<i>Go ahead.</i>

421
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,153
I need to speak to the provost.

422
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,635
<i>Hold on.</i>

423
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,518
...transfer of £400,000 to Zurich
account number 0883011.

424
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,679
So the W.H.O. beat you to Mr. Langdon,
Vayentha.

425
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,760
Provost isn't going to like that.

426
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,156
I know him.
He's going to want to liquidate.

427
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,996
Tell him this isn't Berlin.
He tries anything and I will find him.

428
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,398
Try to reacquire and make contact
in 60 minutes.

429
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,552
Did you hear me? I am not disposable.

430
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,356
<i>Vayentha, get the Faraday pointer</i>
<i>before the government does.</i>

431
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,195
Shit.

432
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,877
Mr. Sims. There's been a deviation.

433
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,391
Sorry to hear that. What operation?

434
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,837
Florence. Our new player
seems to have gone off-script.

435
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,440
How unprofessional.

436
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,710
And now the W.H.O.
has overtaken our position.

437
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,798
Tell Vayentha if she values her position,
she will remove Langdon.

438
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,996
Body not found.

439
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,596
Better yet, a mugging gone awry.

440
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,436
A blade, I think.
Cash gone, wallet remains.

441
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,276
Let's have a quick identification
and move on. Move on. Move on.

442
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,235
Professor Langdon is out of frame.

443
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,154
And in possession of the tube?

444
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,717
Yes. He has the Faraday pointer.

445
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,800
It was such a good frame.
What is Vayentha's condition?

446
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,032
Intact, but anxious.

447
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,554
She should be.

448
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,191
What in God's name
has this client gotten us into?

449
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,319
No, no, no. It is rhetorical.

450
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,071
When are we due
to receive the client's video?

451
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,150
It just arrived. His instructions
are to upload it in 24 hours.

452
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,515
I want to look at it now.

453
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,080
But the client, Mr. Zobrist...

454
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,671
The client is dead.
I want to see the video.

455
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,912
That's a violation of our protocols.

456
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,313
We are not the government.
We get things done.

457
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,439
Mr. Arbogast...

458
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,274
...chief among the attributes
that makes us so very good at our job...

459
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,717
...is that, as far as the world
is concerned, we don't exist.

460
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,711
If this video implicates
or even mentions us in any way...

461
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,237
...I want to stop its release
for the benefit of all our clients.

462
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,274
You asked me to avoid abnormalities
in procedure, that's all.

463
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,559
What about Mr. Zobrist
has ever remotely resembled normal?

464
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,394
- Well, I...
- Also rhetorical.

465
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,199
Bring me the video.

466
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,119
In the Palazzo's Hall of Five Hundred,
there's a famous mural:

467
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,351
Giorgio Vasari's <i>Battle of Marciano.</i>

468
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,836
Near the top of the mural
is a coded message.

469
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,992
It's one of the art world's
most famous puzzles.

470
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,276
And what's the message?

471
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,994
<i>Cerca trova.</i>

472
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,916
Seek and find.

473
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,915
And at the hospital,
when I kept saying I was sorry...

474
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,640
- Very sorry. Over and over.
- Maybe that's not what I meant.

475
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,520
The name of the artist, Vasari.
I could have been saying "Vasari."

476
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,036
That's good. You seem clearer.

477
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,270
Yeah. I am.

478
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,033
What's your middle name?

479
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,398
Well, I am. I am.

480
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,955
Zobrist is dead,
but if his plague is real...

481
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,951
...then this map, it's a trail
he has left so someone can find it.

482
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,196
Who?

483
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,714
Well, someone who believes
the same as he does.

484
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,030
And that's why you have it?

485
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,796
- I don't remember ever meeting Zobrist.
- There's a lot you don't remember.

486
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,554
Maybe they...

487
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,839
Maybe they came to you.
Wanted your help with the path.

488
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,435
- Because I lecture on Dante?
- Exactly.

489
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,718
They'd show you this Faraday pointer,
try to convince you of their cause.

490
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,590
- Mass murder?
- You said you found him compelling.

491
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,834
His argument, his rhetoric, not this plan.

492
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,435
Zobrist is a psychopath.

493
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,718
Well, maybe they tricked you.
Sent someone you knew.

494
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,917
<i>It's a minute to midnight.</i>

495
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,676
- Is that for us?
- Logic would suggest.

496
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,430
Damn it!

497
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,032
Here, come on. Follow me.
We can get there through the garden.

498
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,794
Okay, the Palazzo Vecchio is this way.

499
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,670
We just flagged a car charged to
her credit card within the past hour.

500
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,559
Antoine, did you speak to the police?

501
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,757
Someone saw them running in the park.

502
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,630
Tell the local police that the W.H.O.
needs their full cooperation.

503
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,919
Airspace over Boboli Gardens
is under W.H.O. command.

504
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,391
Send in the canine units.

505
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,951
I'm from Uffizi Station.
Commander is sending reinforcements.

506
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,231
Get more officers in there now.

507
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,599
<i>Command one to dispatch.</i>
<i>Suspects in sight.</i>

508
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,074
Dammit!
Delta, check the stairs to the north.

509
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,319
There's a small gray door down here.

510
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,190
It'll take us through to the Vasari Corridor,
right across the Ponte Vecchio...

511
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,238
...into the Palazzo.

512
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,074
That's the door. See?

513
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,276
Now!

514
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,910
Grotto sector clear.

515
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,634
Is the garden completely walled?

516
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,033
On all sides. The only exits are through
the Palazzo Pitti on the north side...

517
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,431
...and through the visitors' gates
on the east and the west sides.

518
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,836
No other way out?

519
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,552
I suppose if you count the Vasari Gate.
But it's ancient. No one knows about it.

520
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,750
Langdon does.

521
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,800
<i>Double back</i>
<i>and take position over Vasari Corridor.</i>

522
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,511
<i>I repeat: Vasari Corridor.</i>

523
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,360
<i>The professor has become a liability,</i>
<i>Vayentha.</i>

524
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,958
The provost has issued a kill order.
Eliminate Langdon.

525
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,432
<i>Fail and you will be held accountable.</i>

526
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,399
<i>Am I making myself clear?</i>

527
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,199
Copy that, sir.

528
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,034
There. That's the Vasari fresco.

529
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,271
<i>The Battle of Marciano.</i>

530
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,996
<i>There. There.</i>

531
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,834
Look, look, look.

532
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,556
Okay, see the two farmhouses?
Dead center, up high.

533
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,993
Come down to its four o'clock,
and you'll see a small green flag.

534
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,312
<i>- "Cerca trova."</i>
- Yeah.

535
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,789
"Seek and find."

536
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,475
<i>Seek and find.</i>

537
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,031
We sought it and we found it.

538
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,953
So now what?

539
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,551
The words Zobrist added to the painting:

540
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,310
"The truth can be glimpsed
only through the eyes of death."

541
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,355
Eyes of death...

542
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,279
Whose eyes?

543
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,600
Was I given an injection?

544
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,956
When?

545
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,197
At the hospital, with a hypodermic?

546
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,512
No. You were intubated.
Anything you got came through the IV.

547
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,953
Not at the hospital.

548
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,795
I was fully dressed.

549
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,920
I was in the back of some car
at some point in the last two days.

550
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,835
And something was injected
into my bloodstream...

551
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,310
...and now I'm showing signs
of an illness.

552
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,600
What if...?

553
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,560
What if what?

554
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,116
Sienna, what if I'm the carrier?

555
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,996
Look...

556
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,880
...if you've got it,
then I've got it, too...

557
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,670
...and everyone we've come
into contact with has it and will likely die.

558
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,870
But if you don't...

559
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,432
...if they gave you a narcotic
or an hallucinogen or anything else...

560
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,794
...then we still have a chance
to save half the world.

561
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,795
It's worth a try, isn't it?

562
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,596
Professor.

563
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,998
It is you. You're back so soon.

564
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,311
I have no idea who this woman is.

565
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,793
I almost didn't recognize you
in that suit. You've been shopping?

566
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,673
Professor, you bumped your head?

567
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,637
In the shower, yes. Yes.
It was quite a tumble.

568
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,479
I'm sorry, this is Sienna, my niece.

569
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,597
You're in Italy, professor.
You don't have to say "niece."

570
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,599
- No, it's not...
- No, he's not...

571
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,712
Marta Alvarez. Pleasure to meet you.

572
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,434
Is Ignazio with you again?

573
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,320
Ignazio?

574
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,755
Ignazio couldn't make it this morning.

575
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,670
I'm sorry to bother you, Marta...

576
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:03,434
...but I can imagine you know
why I'm back again.

577
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,349
Really?

578
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,270
Of all the treasures in the Palazzo.

579
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,073
He and <i>il Duomino</i> spent almost an hour
with it up there last night.

580
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,755
It's so morbid.

581
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,672
No. No. It's cool.

582
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,715
All right. Come on,
I'm headed up that way.

583
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,719
He's an extremely resourceful man.

584
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,715
I was told you were as well, Mr. Bouchard.

585
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,438
So tell me:

586
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,799
- What do you think he's doing?
- What do you think you are doing?

587
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,794
I brought you the pointer,
and now it's gone. You have a leak.

588
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,431
We lose him in the street,
reacquire him at the doctor's apartment...

589
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,280
I can handle boots on the ground.
We don't need your help.

590
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,760
What if he's injured?

591
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,280
A head wound?

592
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,240
What, you think he's confused?
Doesn't know what he's doing?

593
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,840
It's possible.

594
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,993
How far did he get that night,
before he disappeared?

595
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,199
To the Hall of Five Hundred.

596
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,158
So let's stop chasing him.

597
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,478
Anticipate him instead.

598
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,797
Not so fast. Please.

599
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,918
I'm about to burst.

600
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,955
It's such a romantic date
he takes you on, to see a death mask.

601
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,277
They were common practice in the 1500s.

602
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,190
It's essentially just a plaster cast
of someone's face...

603
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,960
...made a few moments
after that person dies.

604
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,394
"Through the eyes of death."

605
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,916
Whose face was used for this mask?

606
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,640
The poet, Dante.

607
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,430
It is a romantic story, I suppose.

608
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,435
Dante loved Florence.
He was prominent and powerful...

609
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,354
...but the political winds changed
and he was exiled.

610
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,399
They threatened to burn him
at the stake if he ever returned.

611
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,798
Actually, some people say Dante's exile...

612
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,839
...is the reason
his death mask looks so sad.

613
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,755
No. No, it was because of Beatrice.

614
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,080
Dante only knew her from afar, but
he was obsessed with her his entire life.

615
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,395
Your niece is a romantic, professor.

616
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,037
They say Dante wrote <i>Inferno</i>
about his journey out of hell to reach her.

617
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,799
But he never made it.

618
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,717
She married someone else.

619
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,879
That happens.

620
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,350
Does it?

621
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,440
Who left who?

622
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,996
Things fall apart
if you don't look after them.

623
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,672
Oh, we ask that you stay
behind the stanchions, please.

624
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,950
Thank you.

625
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,271
Good timing, professor.
We've only just opened.

626
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,359
Marta.

627
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,790
- There. That's us.
- Let it play from here.

628
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,430
That's Ignazio Busoni.

629
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,718
I've known him for years.
He's the Dante scholar.

630
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,799
The mask's owner insists
on the stanchions to keep people back.

631
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,234
He doesn't even permit staff
to open the case without him present.

632
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,199
So the mask is not owned by the museum?

633
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,115
No. A private collector bought it from us
and allows us to display it in perpetuity.

634
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,917
It's common practice to raise funds.

635
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:06,916
Who is the collector?

636
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,039
Bertrand Zobrist. The billionaire.

637
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,919
His ideas were quite eccentric, but still,
it's such a shame what happened.

638
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,073
That's where I got the call.

639
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,715
Professor, I don't know what to say.

640
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,116
I'm appalled.

641
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,790
Professor Langdon.

642
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,476
Look, there's an explanation
for all of this.

643
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,839
It's the carabinieri.
They're setting off the metal detectors.

644
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,400
Who are the others?

645
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,880
Government agents.

646
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,554
We have an intrusion.

647
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,956
I'll be right back.

648
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,994
Marta, stay in this room.
We'll be right outside.

649
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,110
They can't bring loaded weapons in here.

650
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,557
- Professor, I very much respect you...
- Marta.

651
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,279
- ...but I do not understand...
- Please.

652
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,550
- ...why you have done this.
- Please sit down.

653
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,110
- I'm going to explain this to you.
- This is not okay.

654
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,549
I do not know where that mask is.

655
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,111
But I will do everything I can
to find it and return it to you.

656
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,277
What are you doing?! Professor, please!

657
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,511
Professor, come back here!
You can't do that!

658
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,360
Professor, please don't.

659
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,598
- Professor!
- Just don't follow us.

660
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,274
Please! Don't do this.

661
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,550
Professor!

662
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,150
Parker.

663
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,153
Let's just calmly find a way out of here.

664
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,509
Why didn't you tell me about Ignazio?

665
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,872
Would you have helped me
if you knew I was a thief?

666
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,273
- You lied to me when you asked my help.
- Well, technically, I withheld.

667
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,752
- If I really took that mask...
- You did take the mask. I just saw you.

668
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,719
This is not your problem.
You don't have to stay.

669
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,709
Of course I do.

670
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,271
Human lives are at stake. I just want
to know that I'm on the right side.

671
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,476
You are.

672
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,715
I swear.

673
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,876
Good. Then let's find
what we're looking for.

674
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,474
Call this Ignazio and ask him
where he hid the mask.

675
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,236
Ignazio's disappeared. Gone into hiding.

676
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,749
He said they were chasing him, too,
but he left a clue.

677
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,240
An e-mail. "Paradise Twenty-five."

678
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,120
That's a reference to Dante's
<i>Divine Comedy,</i> Canto XXV.

679
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,794
But I need a copy of the book.

680
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,555
Copy of the book? That's quaint.

681
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,393
I use Google.

682
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,758
They're closing down the museum.
Only the main exit's gonna be open.

683
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,835
Well, then we will go through Armenia.

684
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,671
<i>Please move in an orderly fashion</i>
<i>through the main gate.</i>

685
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,756
All exit doors are now sealed.
This is the only way in or out.

686
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,118
What about hidden exits? Tunnels?
Concealed doorways?

687
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,035
It's a 700-year-old palazzo, <i>signore.</i>
There are a number of them.

688
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,554
Show me.

689
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,314
Armenia.

690
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,956
Professor. How worldly.

691
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,759
"Secrets of the Palazzo Invisible."

692
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,480
It's a great tour,
you should take it some time.

693
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,839
We should be safe here for a minute.

694
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,076
Go.

695
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,230
"By then with other voice,
with other fleece...

696
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,679
...I shall return as poet and put on at
my baptismal font, the laurel crown."

697
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,876
Baptismal font.

698
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,509
Il Duomo. The cathedral
where Dante was baptized.

699
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,390
That's where Ignazio works.
It's where he hid the mask.

700
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,120
This area's clear!

701
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,630
They're gonna think
we're headed down to the exit.

702
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,756
Then we go up.

703
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,110
All right.

704
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,120
We're right above
the Hall of Five Hundred.

705
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,876
There's a stairway leading
down to the street on the other side.

706
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,037
So one step at a time, huh?

707
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,996
Okay.

708
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,680
You afraid of heights?

709
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,510
A little.

710
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,190
I'm uncomfortable in tight spaces.

711
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,353
So don't look down.

712
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,590
Or do.

713
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,200
I can never remember which.

714
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,430
Yeah, yeah.

715
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,909
It's not that hard.

716
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,555
Come on. Good.

717
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,430
Sienna!

718
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,439
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

719
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,829
You okay?

720
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,238
All right, just crawl
along that beam there...

721
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,074
...and I'll meet you on the far side,
by the ladder.

722
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,670
Sir.

723
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,873
Give me six men stationed here.
Safeties off.

724
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,149
You're being stupid now,
Professor Langdon.

725
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,431
Go, go. Get out of here. Go!

726
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,553
They needed you,
but now they've changed their minds.

727
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,910
Get these people out!

728
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,639
Everyone out! Clear the room!

729
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,400
Give me that.

730
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,634
These doors. Here.

731
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,311
Eastern side. That's where they're headed.

732
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,354
Go, move! Quick!

733
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,589
<i>Bouchard? Agent Bouchard, come in.</i>

734
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,798
<i>What is your location?</i>

735
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,474
<i>Agent Bouchard, come in.</i>

736
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,875
That same word is on the envelope
the video arrived in.

737
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,550
Along with the date.
That date is tomorrow.

738
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:29,157
Well, thank you. That was not lost on me.

739
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,359
<i>The darkest places in hell...</i>

740
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:36,275
<i>...are reserved for those who refuse</i>
<i>to act in time of crisis.</i>

741
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,519
<i>Dante's hell isn't fiction anymore.</i>
<i>It's prophecy.</i>

742
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,794
<i>We have created our own hell on Earth.</i>

743
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,880
Oh, my.

744
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,351
<i>The warnings have been obvious,</i>
<i>the solutions ignored.</i>

745
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,517
<i>So I took action.</i>

746
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,274
<i>If you're watching this...</i>

747
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,360
<i>...it means the Inferno virus</i>
<i>was released last night at midnight...</i>

748
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:02,400
<i>...and is now being carried</i>
<i>to every corner of the Earth.</i>

749
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,153
Oh, my.

750
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,437
<i>Within six days of its release...</i>

751
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:10,879
<i>...the virus will replicate itself</i>
<i>in every man, woman and child on Earth.</i>

752
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,639
<i>Expect the current...</i>

753
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,030
<i>The current population</i>
<i>to be culled by half.</i>

754
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,553
<i>The survivors will witness...</i>

755
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,239
<i>...horrors...</i>

756
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,911
<i>...unknown to this planet.</i>

757
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,116
<i>But I want them to know why.</i>

758
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,078
<i>That this was our doing.</i>

759
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,960
<i>And this is our salvation.</i>

760
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,680
<i>Now is the time.</i>

761
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,516
<i>Today is...</i>

762
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,550
There's more.

763
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,552
I believe I've got the gist.

764
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,239
It appears our organization
has spent the last several years...

765
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,834
...in the employ of a madman...

766
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,793
...who now intends
to commit a mass murder...

767
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,071
...using a deadly plague
of his own creation...

768
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,072
...at some point in the next 24... Sorry.

769
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,992
Less than 12 hours.

770
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:02,110
So let's do our level best
not to fuck things up any worse...

771
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,795
...than we already have, shall we?

772
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,992
Without the Faraday pointer,
no one can find the virus.

773
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,880
Where's Professor Langdon now?

774
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,477
He was with Dr. Brooks in the Boboli
Gardens, but we seem to have lost visual.

775
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,355
And I'm afraid we've had
no contact from Vayentha.

776
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,795
I see.

777
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,672
I'm going to Florence myself.

778
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:36,590
Test her for signs of contagion
and quarantine this place.

779
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,873
If we don't find Langdon very soon...

780
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,839
...we're going to be looking
at a great many more dead bodies.

781
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,430
Are you all right?

782
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,789
It's weakness. Just weakness, goddamn it.

783
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,994
We'll just take a moment.

784
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,153
Did you see her down there?

785
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,236
Yes.

786
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,552
Everything I've done, every bit of work
and study since I was 11...

787
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,353
...was to stop death, not cause it.

788
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,716
It was self-defense.
That woman was trying to kill us.

789
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,791
I don't know if I can finish this.

790
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,840
I understand if you can't.

791
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:41,438
Look, Zobrist is the murderer, not you.

792
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,629
You saved me.

793
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,951
You don't have to take another step.

794
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,034
No, you're right.

795
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:55,478
I did what was necessary,
and I'll do it again if I need to.

796
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,319
I pray that you don't.

797
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,115
Looks like it's closed for repairs.

798
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,278
Okay, this way.

799
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,315
There.

800
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,437
The baptismal font.

801
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:01,634
Dante again. Always Dante. Why Dante?

802
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,995
Acrylic gesso.

803
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:06,471
- What, you mean paint?
- Water-soluble paint.

804
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,514
Smells like a wet dog.

805
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,595
Look at that. There's writing.

806
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:23,119
"Seek the treacherous doge of Venice...

807
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,793
...who severed the heads from horses."

808
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,155
Venice.

809
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:34,117
Where Dante was infected
with the disease that killed him.

810
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:40,031
"Kneel within the gilded museum
of holy wisdom...

811
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:44,399
...and listen for the sounds...

812
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,199
...of trickling water.

813
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:53,630
Deep into the sunken palace where the...

814
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,231
...chthonic monster waits."

815
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,472
The plague itself. Underwater.

816
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:05,040
"Submerged in the blood-red waters...

817
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,592
...of the lagoon that reflects no stars."

818
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,836
Professor.

819
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,555
Could you please tell me
what the hell you're doing?

820
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,950
- Why haven't you called in?
- Who are you?

821
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,194
Christoph Bouchard.
From the World Health Organization.

822
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,950
- We've met.
- We've met?

823
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,432
You really don't remember?
It was just two days ago.

824
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,751
He's suffering the effects
of a head wound.

825
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,719
He can't remember the events
of the last 48 hours.

826
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,199
I'm the one who flew to Cambridge
and asked for your help.

827
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,871
I gave you the pointer to decode.

828
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,391
- Professor Langdon?
- Yes?

829
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,514
<i>Okay, yeah. Yeah.</i>

830
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,273
I remember.

831
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,516
Who are you?

832
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,758
I was the ER doctor at the hospital
when the professor came in.

833
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,797
What is the last thing you remember?

834
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,078
I was on the street. I think it was here.

835
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,600
I was with a woman.

836
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,318
- And I was given an injection.
- Elizabeth Sinskey.

837
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,830
Elizabeth?

838
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,673
<i>From the World Health Organization.</i>

839
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,274
Do you know her?

840
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:25,077
I do. But I haven't seen Elizabeth
in years.

841
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,274
- She's the reason I followed you alone.
- What do you mean?

842
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,638
I believe Dr. Sinskey's working
with a foreign government...

843
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,399
...to find and sell the virus.

844
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,791
No, no, no. That's not possible.

845
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,519
People change, professor.

846
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,280
I've been chasing Bertrand Zobrist
for two years...

847
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,672
...and someone has been working
against me.

848
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,272
Let's get to the point.
Do you know where the virus is?

849
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,040
I assume you have
some sort of credentials.

850
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:56,754
Call the W.H.O. if you like.
Check me out. But do it quickly.

851
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,719
Venice. We think it's Venice.

852
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,677
Good. It's two hours by train. Come on.

853
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,400
If I could find you, so can the others.

854
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,917
I'm buying you both plane tickets
to Geneva.

855
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,549
No, not Geneva, he said Venice.

856
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,989
I heard that.

857
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,872
Excuse us. Please watch yourselves.

858
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,600
Step back, please. Excuse us.

859
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,995
Excuse us.

860
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,753
Watch yourselves, please.

861
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,274
This is the plane to Geneva?

862
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,392
Yes, but we just closed the doors.

863
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,473
Keep the plane at the gate.
We need to check every passenger.

864
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,552
That will be a waste of time.

865
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,433
And we have very little of that.

866
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:57,477
Three days ago, after two years
of searching, I found Zobrist.

867
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,997
<i>He killed himself, but we took</i>
<i>a package from his pocket.</i>

868
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,350
And what was in it?

869
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,319
The Faraday pointer with the <i>Map of Hell.</i>

870
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:09,713
A puzzle. Specifically designed
for his follower to solve.

871
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,600
We brought it to you.

872
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,037
And we were in the process of decoding it
when you were kidnapped.

873
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,432
Professor Langdon.

874
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,958
You were with Dr. Sinskey at the time.

875
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,640
Elizabeth, yes.

876
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:33,272
Did she tell you about any
third-party interest in the virus?

877
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,230
I don't remember.

878
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,880
Did she have financial problems?

879
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,190
I don't know.

880
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,556
- Did she carry more than one cell phone?
- I don't know.

881
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:43,750
- Think!
- He doesn't remember.

882
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,071
Millions of people will die, professor.

883
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,469
I don't have time for this bullshit.

884
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,433
"I don't know, I don't remember."

885
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,074
Stop. You're not helping him.

886
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,952
"The gilded museum," is that Saint Mark's?

887
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,239
All of Venice is a museum.

888
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:01,400
Saint Mark's has the <i>Horses of</i>
<i>Constantinople.</i> They're bronze statues.

889
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,790
Can I see that?

890
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:08,790
I wouldn't touch it.

891
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,119
I wasn't planning on it.

892
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,240
Professor?

893
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,990
Professor Langdon? Professor Langdon?

894
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,440
Professor Langdon.

895
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,320
Yes?

896
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,634
Hello, Robert.

897
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,514
Elizabeth.

898
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,872
It's been a long time.

899
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,760
Too long.

900
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,919
What brings you here?

901
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,355
The W.H.O. needs your help.

902
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,350
My help?

903
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,637
I hope you still remember your Dante.

904
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,795
What just happened?

905
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,599
Are you all right?

906
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:15,229
Could you get some water?
He could be dehydrated.

907
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,752
Some food. Maybe some fruit,
or something from the machine?

908
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,915
- Quickly.
- Sure.

909
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,356
Thank you.

910
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,037
- Is he lying?
- Through his teeth.

911
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,874
He was not the one
that came to Cambridge to see me.

912
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,634
Bouchard, I need help.
Quickly. I think he's collapsed.

913
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,515
He's in there. I can't open the door.

914
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,716
Langdon.

915
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,150
Are you okay?

916
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,597
<i>- Toilet occupied.</i>
- Langdon, are you okay?

917
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,954
Come on, let's go!

918
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,279
You're telling me that, for two years...

919
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,114
...you and your organization
have been working against me?

920
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,630
That is correct.

921
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,031
To shield Bertrand Zobrist
and his research?

922
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,192
To hide him, to protect him?

923
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,629
Regrettably, yes.

924
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:50,795
And that all of my attempts to prevent him
from initiating a worldwide pandemic...

925
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,235
...have failed because of you?

926
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,396
Incisive sum-up, yes.

927
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,995
Now you have the temerity to ask...

928
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:01,312
...that I simply decide to trust you?

929
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,834
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't see any other way.

930
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,553
Who, exactly, does your group work for?

931
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,358
Our clients, of course.

932
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,429
We are a private security firm.
A very successful one.

933
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,439
May I ask...

934
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,630
...the gentleman who was with you,
Agent Bouchard...

935
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,515
...where is he now?

936
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,716
We don't know. We lost track of him.

937
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,551
Then the situation is worse
than you think.

938
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,475
There's only one reason
he would move out of pocket.

939
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,359
He wants Mr. Langdon to himself.

940
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,676
Why?

941
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,918
To find the virus and sell it
to the highest bidder, I assume.

942
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,914
Leverage, blackmail.
You know, the usual shit.

943
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,118
I don't think we have anything further
to discuss, Mr. Sims.

944
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,432
And I have less than eight hours
to find this pathogen. Excuse me.

945
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,520
From what I understand,
you knew the professor some time ago.

946
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:03,915
Personally.

947
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,639
You care about him.

948
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:13,878
You would even ally with an unscrupulous
character such as myself to protect him.

949
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,394
Wouldn't you?

950
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:22,950
My organization has the resources
to find your professor.

951
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,320
If you wanted to start a plague,
this is where you'd do it.

952
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:54,916
Yeah.

953
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,838
20 million people a year come here
from every corner of the globe.

954
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,635
During the Black Death...

955
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,192
...the Venetians made all the ships anchor
in the harbor for 40 days...

956
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,477
...before they would allow
the crews into the city.

957
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:10,109
Making sure that they were not carrying
the plague.

958
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:14,593
The word "quarantine" comes from
the Italian <i>"quaranta."</i> Forty.

959
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,791
It's nice to have you back, professor.

960
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,316
There.

961
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,440
The horses.

962
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,909
These are recreations. The originals
are in a museum for preservation.

963
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,879
We should be quick.
Bouchard knows we're coming here.

964
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:42,915
Ask that guide if the heads have
ever been severed from these horses.

965
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,357
According to the tale,
during the Crusades...

966
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,796
...the horses were looted
from Constantinople.

967
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,999
But they were too large
to be loaded on board the ships.

968
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,591
So their heads were removed
and then reattached.

969
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,035
By whom?

970
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,313
- Enrico Dandolo.
- The doge who lived forever.

971
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,554
Of course, Enrico Dandolo.

972
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,076
Dandolo tricked the Venetians
into the Crusades.

973
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:29,993
He was supposed to sail
his ships to Egypt...

974
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,277
...but he sacked Constantinople instead.

975
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,633
I'm sorry. Of course.

976
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,396
"The gilded museum of holy wisdom."

977
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,553
Are we in the wrong basilica?

978
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,274
We're in the wrong country.

979
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,160
Dandolo ruled Venice,
but he was not buried here.

980
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,040
- So where was he buried?
- Hagia Sophia.

981
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,717
- Istanbul.
- Istanbul.

982
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,435
There's always a way out.

983
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,110
Here, here.

984
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,717
Let's see if we can get that open.

985
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:52,996
I'll give you a hand.

986
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,350
I got your foot.

987
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,000
Can you get it?

988
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,199
Is there someone there?

989
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,119
- A hundred Euro.
- Here. I got it.

990
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,794
What are you doing?

991
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,870
You called him a murderer. A psychopath.

992
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,590
What?

993
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,470
But history will call us saviors.

994
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,792
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

995
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,276
I'm not afraid to act, Robert.

996
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,075
But doing nothing terrifies me.

997
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:10,791
The path and the pointer,
he left that all for you.

998
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,397
Zobrist. You knew him?

999
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,519
"Knew him"?

1000
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,879
I loved him.

1001
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,758
You're wearing his suit.

1002
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,510
No. Sienna, no.

1003
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,273
Thank you, Robert.

1004
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,837
Thank you for everything.

1005
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,232
No! No!

1006
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,470
Sienna, no!

1007
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,154
Sienna!

1008
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,031
No, Sienna! Sienna, no!

1009
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,036
<i>Slow down, slow down. You're too fast.</i>

1010
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,271
Oh, come on. Come on.

1011
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:42,837
<i>- This took me three days!</i>
<i>- Too easy!</i>

1012
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,634
I love it.

1013
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,469
Everything before you was just...

1014
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,034
...an idea.

1015
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,633
Now it's real.

1016
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:23,472
Love awakens the soul to act.

1017
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,839
That's not fair.

1018
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,630
Quoting Dante to me.

1019
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,319
But it's "beauty"...

1020
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,634
...not "love."

1021
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,236
What?

1022
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,758
It's a minute to midnight.

1023
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,911
That's sooner than I expected.

1024
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,793
Where are we going?

1025
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,960
I see.

1026
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,510
We planned it together.

1027
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,440
We designed it together.

1028
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,190
But this part belongs only to you.

1029
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:42,400
It's just safer if you don't know where.

1030
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,840
What if they find you first?

1031
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:52,400
What then?

1032
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,556
If you want to know you're not alone...

1033
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,072
...you gotta start by trusting me.

1034
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,596
<i>And unless we take bold,</i>
<i>immediate action...</i>

1035
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,198
...the sixth extinction...

1036
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,799
<i>...will be our own.</i>

1037
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,120
You were right.

1038
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,477
I'm gonna make you another path.

1039
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,798
Inferno will be at the end.

1040
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:40,070
If something should happen to me,
the first clue will be delivered to you.

1041
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,069
I know you'll do what must be done.

1042
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,673
Seek and find.

1043
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,753
You're not alone.

1044
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,800
So...

1045
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,397
...a beautiful young woman
went for the bad guy.

1046
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,636
That happens.

1047
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,713
You look disappointed.

1048
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,114
I'll give you a minute.

1049
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:14,957
Elizabeth is not the one
who wants the virus to sell.

1050
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:16,756
You are.

1051
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,119
You've been used.

1052
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,513
Elaborate schemes created by people
to get you to do what they want.

1053
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,359
But me?

1054
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,713
I'm very direct.

1055
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:36,436
And this is a moment
of great opportunity for me.

1056
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,320
So where is the virus?

1057
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,633
Come on, professor.

1058
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,671
How much life is there in the world?

1059
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,640
How much more is fighting to be born?

1060
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:59,354
Nothing wrong with thinning the herd
once in a while.

1061
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,550
It's healthy.

1062
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,800
I've seen many acts of God:

1063
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,555
Famine, typhoons, cholera.

1064
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,229
And you know what?

1065
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,230
Sometimes, it hits the right people.

1066
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:24,432
- That's inhuman.
- Humanity is inhuman.

1067
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,277
Life may be cheap.
But a means to end it on a mass scale?

1068
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,796
No one ever stops paying for that.

1069
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,229
I'm going to ask you for the last...

1070
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:46,910
Terribly sorry.

1071
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,549
Didn't see any other way.

1072
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:55,199
Must do this quickly.

1073
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,517
The less blood, the better.

1074
01:26:58,600 --> 01:26:59,795
Who are you?

1075
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,639
A facilitator.

1076
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,879
Among other things,
my company creates illusions.

1077
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,919
You never had a real head wound.

1078
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,873
But I lost my memory.

1079
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,878
Chemically induced.

1080
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:20,312
We gave you an injection
of benzodiazepines.

1081
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:25,113
Sorry. They can produce a skin rash.
Should fade in a day or so.

1082
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:33,109
All of this was a fake?

1083
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,158
I prefer "created reality."

1084
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:40,280
My agents kidnapped you...

1085
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,316
...and cleared your memory
so we could create a fresh scenario...

1086
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:47,951
...whereby you would be invested
in the idea of helping us.

1087
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:50,680
A small incision was made...

1088
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,672
<i>...in your scalp to give...</i>

1089
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,911
...the impression of a bullet graze.

1090
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,836
There are no locks on hospital doors.

1091
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:00,515
Exactly.

1092
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,394
Highest marks.

1093
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,678
What about the policewoman
who shot the doctor in the hospital?

1094
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,349
Also with me. Her gun fired blanks.

1095
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,357
<i>And there were squibs in the door.</i>

1096
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,239
<i>The doctor was an agent</i>
<i>wearing a blood packet.</i>

1097
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:17,314
The taxi driver at the hospital
was working for us as well.

1098
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:22,511
In the Palazzo Vecchio,
she tried to kill me. With real bullets.

1099
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,109
At my behest.

1100
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:30,311
When things had appeared to go tits up,
I tried to sweep it all away quickly.

1101
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,914
By killing me?

1102
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,595
Oh, I apologize unreservedly, Mr. Langdon.

1103
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,676
I did lose an experienced agent.

1104
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:49,876
There's a great deal of situational
ebb and flow in my line of work.

1105
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,111
Look, here we both are now.

1106
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,190
I know I behaved terribly.

1107
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:02,192
But a puzzle needed solving.

1108
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,431
Who better to solve it than you?

1109
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,393
Glance away, will you?

1110
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,833
Not my best work.

1111
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,991
But it'll do for the Italians.

1112
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:32,400
Zobrist had followers everywhere,
but Sienna Brooks came to me for help.

1113
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,074
Or so I thought.

1114
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:38,834
She came to us with serious concerns
shortly after Zobrist died.

1115
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,874
Somehow, she knew Zobrist had hired us.

1116
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,911
She said he was doing biological work
that could be lethal in the wrong hands.

1117
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:50,073
She didn't mention a plague.
But we heard enough to be alarmed.

1118
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:53,990
So we agreed to work with her
to find Zobrist's project.

1119
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:58,080
And when Dr. Sinskey brought you in,
we saw an opportunity.

1120
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,912
- It was Elizabeth who came to see me.
- Yes.

1121
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:05,558
<i>Dr. Sinskey got the Faraday pointer</i>
<i>from Agent Bouchard.</i>

1122
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,352
<i>She brought it to you to decode.</i>

1123
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,876
<i>And she even secured it</i>
<i>with your thumbprint.</i>

1124
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,078
<i>That left us with no choice.</i>

1125
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,277
So we took you from her on the street.

1126
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,910
The hospital scenario encouraged you
to trust Dr. Brooks.

1127
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:25,839
And your call to the consulate
was answered by our man.

1128
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,434
<i>Professor Langdon?</i>

1129
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,990
Thank heavens you're alive.
We've been looking for you.

1130
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,355
Are you still in possession?

1131
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,432
You had the pointer and we had you.

1132
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,480
It was all working seamlessly
until Miss Brooks stole you away.

1133
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,155
To make sure the virus is released.

1134
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,354
It appears.

1135
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,831
Young people are disappointing.

1136
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:51,712
I find they become tolerable around 35.

1137
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:56,751
You mentioned Dr. Sinskey.

1138
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,313
I've been so worried.

1139
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,636
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1140
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,760
- Are you?
- I'm okay.

1141
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,040
I'm all right.

1142
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,840
Thank God.

1143
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,951
- Do you know where the virus is?
- Istanbul.

1144
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,239
<i>Now is the time.</i>

1145
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,634
<i>Today is our rebirth.</i>

1146
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,517
<i>Inferno is salvation.</i>

1147
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:45,751
I am so sorry I brought you into this,
Robert, after all these years.

1148
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,719
No. I'm glad you did.

1149
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,837
I met him, you know. Zobrist.

1150
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:54,316
Two years ago. He asked for my help.

1151
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,994
He wanted the W.H.O.
to endorse mass sterilization...

1152
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,271
...in drinking water and staple foods.

1153
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,311
So I threw him out of my office,
put him on a watch list...

1154
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:08,152
...but he disappeared...

1155
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:13,438
...and I suppose that's when Zobrist
hired Sims.

1156
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,274
I should probably have had... Yeah.

1157
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:18,590
I don't know.

1158
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:23,352
What? You have always blamed yourself
for things that weren't your fault.

1159
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,957
Still very sweet.

1160
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,518
Here. The doorway.

1161
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:01,911
I wish it would've happened differently
back then.

1162
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,672
We didn't look after it. It fell apart.

1163
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,319
Is that a regret?

1164
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,997
Only when I think about it.

1165
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,959
The most interesting things
happen in doorways.

1166
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:28,470
At the borders, right along the edges.

1167
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:35,194
Ancient fishermen learned to sail
where the warm water met the cold.

1168
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:40,238
The little fish would reach the edge
of the warm water and they'd stop...

1169
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:43,950
...and the big fish would come out
of the cold water and they'd eat them.

1170
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:47,796
And the fishermen, well,
they caught everybody.

1171
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,315
Doorways.

1172
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:01,160
Not one particle of you has changed,
Robert.

1173
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,558
You talk too much.

1174
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:10,194
And then...

1175
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,920
...not at all.

1176
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:15,594
Elizabeth.

1177
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:22,675
I couldn't ask you not to go to Geneva.

1178
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,430
Couldn't.

1179
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,958
I didn't want to ask you
to leave Cambridge.

1180
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,917
Is that how it happened?

1181
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:42,032
I don't trust my memory anymore.

1182
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,512
I never forget anything.

1183
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:47,155
Well, that's a gift.

1184
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,720
No. It isn't.

1185
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:09,397
Leave him alone! What are you doing?
Where are you...? Leave him alone!

1186
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:10,710
Turn around!

1187
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,871
Don't look at me, bitch. Look away.

1188
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,236
Stop it!

1189
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:22,236
Don't look!

1190
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,194
Robert!

1191
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:49,589
Thanks.

1192
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,074
I'm a friend of the poet.

1193
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,478
For what did Zobrist die?

1194
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,793
That others may live.

1195
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:57,320
I've come very far
to make sure nothing interferes.

1196
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,519
<i>The delivery system we designed...</i>

1197
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:02,030
<i>...will discharge the viral agent</i>
<i>by midnight tonight.</i>

1198
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:04,476
<i>But there are others</i>
<i>who are on their way to stop it.</i>

1199
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:09,357
I need to find it before they do and
trigger an explosion to ensure its release.

1200
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:11,394
How do we help?

1201
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:16,033
During the Plague of Justinian...

1202
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:19,750
...5000 people died every day
in the streets of Istanbul.

1203
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:22,355
The border between East and West,
another doorway.

1204
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:25,915
Which is why he chose it.

1205
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,992
If the bag's intact, we can contain it.

1206
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,880
But if someone ruptures it
before we get there...

1207
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:37,795
...95 percent of the Earth's population
will be infected in four to seven days.

1208
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:15,556
Professor. Doctor. My name is Mirsat,
I am the curator here.

1209
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,031
Have you completely
evacuated the building?

1210
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:30,352
Well, to the extent that we can,
but the place is massive.

1211
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:33,354
Could you tell me specifically
what it is you're looking for?

1212
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,557
The tomb of Enrico Dandolo.

1213
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,319
Of course. This way.

1214
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:51,000
"Kneel within the gilded museum
of holy wisdom.

1215
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:54,917
Listen for the sounds of trickling water.

1216
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,391
Follow deep into the sunken palace."

1217
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,993
- I hear water flowing under these stones.
- Where does it go?

1218
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,152
It's just drainage.
It goes to the city cistern.

1219
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,152
We are looking for a large
underground space...

1220
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:18,313
...perhaps with columns,
artificially lit from within.

1221
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,790
That's it. The ancient cistern.

1222
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,076
Sixth century.

1223
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:25,399
Well, some call it "The Sunken Palace."

1224
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:26,876
Take us there.

1225
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,277
His words can only mean one thing:

1226
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,359
"The Sunken Palace."

1227
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:36,480
Once we descend, you'll see exactly
what he described.

1228
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:42,276
How do I use it?

1229
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:47,194
There's a cap in the putty of each brick.

1230
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:50,034
The device also has a detonation button.

1231
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:54,032
A call from this cell phone
will trigger the explosion.

1232
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:56,078
And that's enough to break the bag?

1233
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,914
The walls are cement, all around.

1234
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:03,074
You need both bombs, different angles,
as far apart as you can.

1235
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,038
That will break the bag.

1236
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:15,032
History says that the Black Plague
caused misery and death.

1237
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,396
But what they don't tell us...

1238
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:20,120
...is that it also produced
a leaner population...

1239
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,198
...and gave birth to the Renaissance.

1240
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:25,876
And we are rushing as fast as we can
into the seventh circle of hell.

1241
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,719
The suicidal and the profligate.

1242
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:30,395
Why is suffering later
preferable to suffering now?

1243
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:35,191
What if we embrace it?
I mean, maybe pain can save us.

1244
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:38,320
You're getting this, aren't you?

1245
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,917
I can see that you are.

1246
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:44,074
I mean, I need to know that I'm not alone.

1247
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,515
Too many damned people.

1248
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:01,870
He's chosen well.

1249
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:05,920
I need schematics of all conduits
in and out of the cistern.

1250
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:09,916
Full isolation and containment protocols.

1251
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:12,555
Physical and chemical barriers along...
Wait!

1252
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:19,670
- This is the city's water supply?
- Well, not anymore. We've modernized.

1253
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:23,237
- But there is water in there?
- Yes, it eventually filters into the earth.

1254
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:25,960
- But why are all these people here?
- It's a tourist attraction.

1255
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:27,554
The acoustics are excellent.

1256
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:31,113
Tonight is the summer solstice concert.
Very popular.

1257
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,954
People come from all over the world
to hear it.

1258
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:36,911
He created a bioaerosol.

1259
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:39,472
So it will spread in the air.

1260
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:43,237
- Empty the place.
- No! Contain it.

1261
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:48,117
Jam all communications down there.
No messages get in or out.

1262
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:49,509
Got it.

1263
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:52,760
Shall we go in?

1264
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:59,549
Robert, you don't have to go in there
with us.

1265
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:01,514
Yes, I do.

1266
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:21,797
"Blood-red waters of the lagoon
that reflects no stars."

1267
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,633
My God, this is a labyrinth!

1268
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,874
How many sections?

1269
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:28,680
There are dozens, professor. Dozens.

1270
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:32,120
Let's find it.

1271
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:35,000
Check every section. Every column.

1272
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,799
Check them all.

1273
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,195
Spread out.

1274
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:50,832
Cut off cell phone service now!

1275
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,514
- No communication.
- Yes, sir.

1276
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:03,079
<i>Who's our U.S. contact over here?</i>
<i>I need some help.</i>

1277
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,600
- Here, this way. Medusa.
- The Greek spirit? Why?

1278
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,153
Belongs to a specific category
of Greek spirits. The chthonic monsters.

1279
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:15,637
- This is it?
- Yes.

1280
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:18,634
The color, the columns,
exactly what we saw in the video.

1281
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:22,120
This is the area, so spread out.
Check pillars.

1282
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:25,512
- I'll take the wall line.
- The corners. Under the walkway.

1283
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:29,870
If you find anything,
report to me immediately.

1284
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:34,559
The bag is here somewhere. Seconds matter.

1285
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,271
Excuse me. Excuse me. What's going on?

1286
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,432
Sir, I need you to step aside.

1287
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:55,471
Step aside! Everyone!

1288
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:34,759
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm.</i>

1289
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:46,676
I got it!

1290
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:49,111
It's here! In this far corner!

1291
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,434
Don't!

1292
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:55,229
- HAZMAT guys aren't set yet.
- Can't wait.

1293
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:01,596
Quickly! This could break any moment.

1294
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,714
Sienna!

1295
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,149
Sienna!

1296
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:40,674
Does this cube nitrogen purge
without glove access?

1297
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:42,274
- It should.
- It better.

1298
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:54,158
Sienna! Sienna.

1299
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:57,996
There are too many of us down here.
You won't get to that bag before we do.

1300
01:46:58,160 --> 01:47:00,914
No. But I can make sure it breaks.

1301
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:04,630
Come on, don't do this, Sienna, don't.
You'll be murdering innocents.

1302
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,510
Yes, people will die, a lot of them,
but the crisis will be averted.

1303
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:12,190
It's what nature demands.

1304
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:15,120
The problem won't just be slowed down,
it'll be solved. Permanently.

1305
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:19,360
Killing billions to save lives?
That's the logic of tyrants.

1306
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:22,877
- For a greater good, humanity...
- Genius does not come with extra rights.

1307
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:26,551
No, it comes with the responsibility
to take action when others won't.

1308
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,200
You wanna do something? Fine.

1309
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:31,910
Then scream at the top of your lungs
and invent and lead!

1310
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:37,314
If you love humanity, if you love
this planet, you'd do anything to save it.

1311
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:39,437
The greatest sins in human history...

1312
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:41,871
...have been committed
in the name of love.

1313
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:44,396
No one will look on this act
and call it love.

1314
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,114
They'll be alive.

1315
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,675
What does it matter
what they say about us?

1316
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:35,479
Hey, what are you doing? No!

1317
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:26,993
No. Don't shoot the box!

1318
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:44,959
Robert, get clear!

1319
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,673
Are you all right? You all right?

1320
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:04,996
I'm fine.

1321
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:07,880
Where's the box? Where's the box?

1322
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:54,076
It's contained.

1323
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,034
No breach.

1324
01:51:57,800 --> 01:52:00,235
The virus is completely contained.

1325
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:02,674
The virus is contained.

1326
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:05,958
<i>- All medical units stand by.</i>
- We'll take it from here, Dr. Sinskey.

1327
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:09,914
<i>Target is contained</i>
<i>and preparing for transport.</i>

1328
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:19,749
<i>Containment confirmed.</i>
<i>I repeat, containment confirmed.</i>

1329
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,238
All right. I'm on it.

1330
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,515
She thought she was saving the world.

1331
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:11,800
So did they all.

1332
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:24,718
So, what happens now?

1333
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:28,712
We take it back to Geneva
for taxonomy and isolation.

1334
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:31,876
We have to generate
a metagenome sequence first...

1335
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:34,191
...to get an idea
of what we're dealing with.

1336
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,631
There's a lot of work to be done.

1337
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:46,319
And you? Cambridge?

1338
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:51,035
Yeah.

1339
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:55,430
Dr. Sinskey?

1340
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:02,636
Life pulls us apart again.

1341
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:07,196
Like Dante and Beatrice.

1342
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,352
I have something for you.

1343
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:29,720
I picked this up the night you were taken.

1344
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:32,560
I seem to remember
it was important to you.

1345
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:38,993
Yes. Yes, it is.

1346
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:45,153
Do you ever think...

1347
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:49,271
...about what could happen
with you and me?

1348
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:52,355
I do.

1349
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:59,558
I guess life must have its mysteries,
professor.

1350
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,559
Even for us.

1351
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:39,835
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

1352
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,674
Have you seen Marta Alvarez
of the museum staff?

1353
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:46,317
Marta isn't here just now.
She's had her baby.

1354
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:47,755
She had her baby?

1355
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:50,634
Oh, that is great news. Great news.

1356
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:53,031
You might tell someone
that the lights on the Dante mask...

1357
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:55,237
...should be turned on
because I could barely see it.

1358
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:59,553
I know, I'm sorry, sir, the Dante mask
is no longer here. It was stolen.

1359
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:01,992
Really? I was just looking at it.

1360
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:05,109
Excuse me.
