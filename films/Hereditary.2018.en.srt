1
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,576
Come on, Peter.

2
00:03:04,328 --> 00:03:07,329
Wake up. Peter. Wake up.

3
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:10,177
Here's your suit.

4
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:17,091
Do you know if your sister
slept in her room last night?

5
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:19,662
I don't know.

6
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,083
Come on, Peter. Get up.

7
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:49,956
Oh, Charlie.
For God's sake, come on!

8
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,338
It was freezing last night!

9
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:56,431
That's how you get pneumonia.

10
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,986
That's okay.

11
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,457
Okay, come on.
Let's go. We're late.

12
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,305
Your mother's
in the car already.

13
00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:15,165
Um...

14
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:21,229
It's heartening to see so many
strange new faces here today.

15
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:26,023
Um, I know my mom
would be very touched

16
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:29,195
and probably a little
suspicious...

17
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:33,082
um, to see this turnout. So.

18
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:41,638
My mother was a very secretive
and private woman.

19
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:43,677
She had private rituals,

20
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:46,763
private friends,
private anxieties.

21
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:48,833
It honestly feels
like a betrayal

22
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:51,083
just to be standing here
talking about her.

23
00:04:57,883 --> 00:05:00,483
<i>She was a very difficult woman
to read.</i>

24
00:05:01,407 --> 00:05:04,290
<i>If you ever thought you knew
what was going on with her,</i>

25
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:06,664
<i>and God forbid
you tried to confront that.</i>

26
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,902
<i>But when her life
was unpolluted,</i>

27
00:05:11,972 --> 00:05:14,405
<i>she could be
the sweetest, warmest,</i>

28
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:16,458
<i>most loving person
in the world.</i>

29
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:20,208
She was also
incredibly stubborn,

30
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:22,811
which maybe, explains me.

31
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,425
You could always count on her
to always have the answer.

32
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,489
And if
she ever was mistaken,

33
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:33,796
and well,
that was your opinion...

34
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:38,642
And you were wrong.

35
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,816
There aren't nuts in that?

36
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,798
- No.
- Good.

37
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,176
Does that have nuts? 'Cause
we don't have the EpiPen.

38
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:10,189
I know.

39
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:41,934
Hello, Rexy! Good dog.

40
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,543
Shoes off, everybody.

41
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,099
Charlie, shoes off.

42
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:55,759
It does feel weird.

43
00:06:57,124 --> 00:06:58,324
Yeah.

44
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,171
Should I be sadder?

45
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:05,644
You should be
whatever you are. It'll come.

46
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:29,208
Hey, how's it going?

47
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:30,950
Mmm, just working.

48
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,334
Taking a break
from avoiding the show.

49
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,256
So, you still toiling away
at the hospice?

50
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,396
Yeah, between this
and the, uh, preschool.

51
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:51,187
So what's our deadline now?
Seven months?

52
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:54,520
- Six and a half.
- Ooh, coming up.

53
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:57,869
Any ideas for titles?

54
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:06,701
Come in.

55
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:08,870
Hey...

56
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:11,020
- Goodnight, kiddo.
- Goodnight.

57
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:17,170
Are you, uh... Are you feeling
okay about everything?

58
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:19,130
Yeah. Fine.

59
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:21,244
A little sad?

60
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:24,592
Mmm...

61
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:27,816
Yeah, I get it. I know.

62
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:29,793
- Goodnight.
- Night.

63
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:31,149
Love you.

64
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:47,361
Who's this?

65
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:51,375
That's Grandma?

66
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,343
You know
you were her favorite, right?

67
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:07,782
Even when
you were a little baby,

68
00:09:07,784 --> 00:09:08,506
she wouldn't let me feed you

69
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:10,178
because she needed
to feed you.

70
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:11,892
Drove me crazy.

71
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:14,923
She wanted me to be a boy.

72
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:21,917
You know, I was a tomboy
when I was growing up.

73
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:26,739
I hated dresses
and dolls and pink.

74
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:30,364
Who's gonna take care of me?

75
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:33,518
Um, excuse me.

76
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,617
You don't think
I'm gonna take care of you?

77
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:38,575
But when you die.

78
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,851
Well, then...

79
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:45,627
Dad will take care of you.

80
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:48,269
Or Peter.

81
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:06,826
You never cried as a baby.

82
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,194
You know that?

83
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:13,680
Even when you were born.

84
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:24,785
Did you feel
like you wanted to cry today?

85
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:32,050
You think it might feel
like a relief?

86
00:10:57,376 --> 00:10:58,778
Goodnight, sweetheart.

87
00:12:50,611 --> 00:12:51,857
Mom?

88
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:34,820
I just scared myself
in the workshop.

89
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:38,405
With... With what?

90
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:44,641
No.

91
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:07,665
Are you done?

92
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,832
Almost.

93
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:15,509
So, maybe we finish the toy
after the quiz.

94
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,756
What do you think?

95
00:14:18,711 --> 00:14:20,205
- Okay.
- Okay.

96
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:31,199
Oh, my God! What was that?

97
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:46,486
So, if we go by the rule

98
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,892
that the hero is undone
by his fatal flaw,

99
00:14:49,943 --> 00:14:52,511
what is Heracles' flaw?

100
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:54,907
Arrogance.

101
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,496
Okay. Why?

102
00:14:57,913 --> 00:15:00,680
Because he literally refuses
to look at all the signs

103
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:03,639
that are literally handed
to him the entire play.

104
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:06,314
Okay, interesting.

105
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,624
So he thinks he has control.

106
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,121
But let's all remember,

107
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,251
Sophocles wrote the oracle
so that it was unconditional,

108
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:17,276
meaning, Heracles never had
any choice, right?

109
00:15:17,345 --> 00:15:20,169
So does that make it
more tragic or less tragic

110
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:22,475
that if he has a choice?

111
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:24,518
- Less.
- Okay.

112
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:26,516
- Why?
- Because.

113
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:31,082
Care to
weigh in, Peter?

114
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,773
Um, about which part?

115
00:15:37,022 --> 00:15:38,111
I think it's more tragic

116
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:39,887
because if it's all
just inevitable,

117
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:42,306
then that means that
the characters had no hope.

118
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:43,215
They never had hope

119
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:45,103
because they're all just,
like, hopeless.

120
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:46,062
They're all like pawns

121
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:48,620
in this horrible,
hopeless machine.

122
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:04,538
- Hello!
- Hi!

123
00:17:46,952 --> 00:17:48,485
Did you go up
in my mom's room?

124
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:50,861
No.

125
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:53,446
Mmm. Door was open.

126
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,452
Hello?

127
00:18:00,484 --> 00:18:02,064
Sorry. I know it's irrational.

128
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:03,828
- No problem.
- Thank you.

129
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:06,977
Hey, Dad. It's the cemetery.

130
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,426
About what?

131
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:10,482
Let me see.

132
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:13,898
Hello? Yes.

133
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:22,660
What does that mean?

134
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:24,741
Desecrated?

135
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:31,005
But it's only been a week.

136
00:18:34,427 --> 00:18:37,376
Yes, okay, yes. Sure.

137
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:38,947
All right. I understand.
Yes...

138
00:18:39,003 --> 00:18:41,908
Uh, why don't I call you back?
Yes. Goodbye.

139
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:43,084
What was it?

140
00:18:44,934 --> 00:18:47,352
Uh, just some billing crap.

141
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:51,056
Okay, well, I'm, uh...
I'm gonna go see a movie.

142
00:18:52,183 --> 00:18:53,288
Okay.

143
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:21,442
He would say

144
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:24,808
"I'm a burden, I'm a burden,
I'm a burden."

145
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,248
And I would
tell him, "No, no."

146
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,113
But yes,
he was a burden.

147
00:19:41,818 --> 00:19:44,925
Now we've set aside
some time for any newcomers

148
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:46,760
who might like to speak.

149
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:48,534
So, anyone.

150
00:19:48,595 --> 00:19:51,997
If it's your first
or second time with us,

151
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:53,637
the floor is open.

152
00:19:57,347 --> 00:20:00,237
Yes. Would you like to...

153
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:01,546
Maybe not.

154
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,828
Okay. No pressure.

155
00:20:12,475 --> 00:20:13,608
My name's Annie.

156
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,139
Hi, Annie.

157
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:18,676
My mom died a week ago.

158
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,153
So I'm just here
for trying it.

159
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:25,745
I have a lot of resistance
to things like this,

160
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:28,901
but I came to these
a couple years ago.

161
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:32,049
Well, I was forced to come
and I guess it, um...

162
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,435
I guess it helped. So, um...

163
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:42,014
My mom was old and she wasn't
all together there at the end.

164
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:44,439
And we were pretty much
estranged before that,

165
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:47,362
so it really wasn't
a huge blow.

166
00:20:47,654 --> 00:20:52,894
But I did love her.

167
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:55,774
And she didn't have
an easy life.

168
00:20:55,825 --> 00:20:58,961
She had DID, which became
extreme at the end.

169
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,645
And dementia.

170
00:21:00,747 --> 00:21:04,781
And my father died when I was
a baby from starvation,

171
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:07,679
um, because he had
psychotic depression

172
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:08,476
and he starved himself,

173
00:21:08,478 --> 00:21:10,744
which I'm sure was just
as pleasant as it sounds.

174
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:12,333
And then there's my brother.

175
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:14,383
My older brother
had schizophrenia

176
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:15,713
and when he was 16

177
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,488
he hanged himself
in my mother's bedroom

178
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,198
and of course
the suicide note blamed her

179
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:22,634
accusing her of putting people
inside him. So.

180
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:28,310
That was my mom's life.

181
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,997
And then she lived
in our house

182
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:43,712
at the end before hospice.

183
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:45,266
We weren't even talking
before that.

184
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:47,329
I mean, we were
and then we weren't.

185
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:49,223
And then we were.

186
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:53,684
She's completely manipulative.

187
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,105
Until my husband finally
enforced a no-contact rule,

188
00:21:57,163 --> 00:21:59,426
which lasted until I got
pregnant with my daughter.

189
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,591
I didn't let her
anywhere near me

190
00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:02,245
when I had my first, my son,

191
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:04,112
which is why I gave her
my daughter,

192
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,576
who she immediately
stabbed her hooks into.

193
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,668
And I just...
I felt guilty again.

194
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:11,149
I felt guilty again.

195
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:12,447
When she got sick,

196
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:14,688
not that she was really even
my mom at the end,

197
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,324
and not that she would ever
feel guilty about anything.

198
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:27,473
And I just don't want to put
any more stress on my family.

199
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,102
I'm not even really sure
if they could...

200
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,512
Could give me that support.

201
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:40,839
And I just...
I just feel like...

202
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:46,397
I just sometimes
feel like it's all ruined.

203
00:22:49,194 --> 00:22:53,362
And then I realize
that I am to blame.

204
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,003
Or not that I'm to blame,

205
00:22:57,048 --> 00:23:01,816
but I am blamed! I'm...

206
00:23:03,003 --> 00:23:06,686
And what do you think
you feel blamed for?

207
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:11,406
I don't know.

208
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:16,566
<i>Hey, what's
going on in town</i>

209
00:23:16,568 --> 00:23:18,385
<i>anyway, Mister?
A convention or something?</i>

210
00:23:18,387 --> 00:23:19,094
<i>What?</i>

211
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:20,325
<i>Well, those clothes
you're wearing.</i>

212
00:23:20,327 --> 00:23:21,302
<i>I talked to a guy this morning</i>

213
00:23:21,304 --> 00:23:23,266
<i>who was wearing
the same kind of outfit.</i>

214
00:23:23,383 --> 00:23:25,656
<i>Maybe it's the guy
you're looking for, huh?</i>

215
00:23:25,658 --> 00:23:27,023
<i>You spoke to him?</i>

216
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:29,391
<i>What did he tell you?
Where did he go?</i>

217
00:23:29,463 --> 00:23:30,786
<i>Hey, what's the matter
with you?</i>

218
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,026
<i>Hey, take your hands off me.</i>

219
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,542
<i>You will tell me
what he said to you!</i>

220
00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:34,597
<i>Well why should I?</i>

221
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:36,246
<i>Hey, who do you think
you are anyway?</i>

222
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:39,817
<i>He came in
with the dog tags!</i>

223
00:23:39,924 --> 00:23:41,089
<i>Wanted to know
about the address</i>

224
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:42,299
<i>and I told him how to find it.</i>

225
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,338
Where?

226
00:25:48,263 --> 00:25:51,917
Hey, um, do you think
I could maybe borrow

227
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,452
one of the cars tonight?

228
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:56,136
Why? Where are you going?

229
00:25:56,312 --> 00:25:59,043
Oh, just like
a school barbecue thing.

230
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,027
Oh, so you're not eating
with us?

231
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,910
No, I was still gonna
eat here.

232
00:26:03,034 --> 00:26:04,449
Well, you can eat there
if you want. I just didn't...

233
00:26:04,451 --> 00:26:07,071
No, no, no. I'm gonna
eat here. I just, I...

234
00:26:07,126 --> 00:26:09,826
Just be going to hang out.

235
00:26:12,408 --> 00:26:13,608
No drinking?

236
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,164
We're not even old enough
to get drinks if we wanted to.

237
00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:21,337
Well, that's a crock. I'm just
asking if you're drinking.

238
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:23,383
Well, I just answered no.

239
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:26,803
You gonna take your sister?

240
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:31,159
Uh... Does she want to go?

241
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,458
Have you asked her?

242
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:39,307
Charlie?

243
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:10,763
Charlie!

244
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:17,082
I mean, what are you doing?
Leaving the house barefoot?

245
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,302
Are you some kind of idiot?

246
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:21,008
You can't roam around
with no shoes and no coat.

247
00:27:21,178 --> 00:27:22,942
- I want Grandma.
- Oh.

248
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,073
Oh, what?
You're angry with me now?

249
00:27:29,478 --> 00:27:31,914
You are going to this...
Hey, socks off.

250
00:27:32,054 --> 00:27:33,855
You're going to this party
with your brother.

251
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,454
What party?

252
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:38,164
Some school hangout
with other kids.

253
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:40,496
That's okay.

254
00:27:40,498 --> 00:27:43,616
No, it's not okay.
You're going.

255
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:45,210
- Why?
- Because it'll be fun.

256
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:47,196
Because you'll get to hang out
with other kids.

257
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:48,470
- With who?
- With your...

258
00:27:48,522 --> 00:27:50,220
With your brother.
With other kids.

259
00:27:55,553 --> 00:27:57,135
- Fine.
- Good. You're going.

260
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:59,168
- She's going with you.
- Great.

261
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:01,061
Now this really means
no drinking.

262
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,897
Yeah, I really wasn't
going to.

263
00:29:39,164 --> 00:29:40,641
<i>Whoa. Hi.</i>

264
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:43,367
Oh. Hi.

265
00:29:44,026 --> 00:29:45,360
How's the party?

266
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,720
Why? You wanna know
if you should come?

267
00:29:49,117 --> 00:29:51,129
Uh, yeah. What do ya think?

268
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:54,924
Either way.

269
00:29:57,575 --> 00:29:59,941
Hey, do you happen
to smoke at all?

270
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:01,614
I have really good weed.

271
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:10,288
- The other room has a bong.
- Sick.

272
00:30:15,822 --> 00:30:17,359
Do you wanna wait out here
for a second?

273
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:19,422
- No.
- Charlie, please, just...

274
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,304
It'll be two minutes
and then we can hang out.

275
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:24,315
You can draw.
Please, Charlie. I'm...

276
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,055
Oh, shit, look. They're
giving out chocolate cake.

277
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:29,313
Not to everyone.

278
00:30:29,315 --> 00:30:30,652
Yes to everyone. It's a party.

279
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:32,692
- I don't know anyone.
- Nobody does.

280
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,498
Just walk over and stand there
and they'll give you a piece.

281
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:37,513
Hurry up. They're gonna
run out. Come on, Charlie.

282
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,592
Hey, guys. Peter has weed.

283
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:12,098
That was
your sister downstairs?

284
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,435
Yeah. Charlie.

285
00:31:16,356 --> 00:31:17,623
Is your sister hot?

286
00:31:20,423 --> 00:31:22,410
I actually saw her
drawing me last week.

287
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:23,541
Oh, yeah?

288
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:26,332
Yeah. She made me
look retarded.

289
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:28,001
Yeah. That's Charlie.

290
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:58,748
Peter?

291
00:31:58,937 --> 00:32:01,804
Charlie.

292
00:32:02,157 --> 00:32:04,424
What's up?

293
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:10,120
Are you okay?

294
00:32:11,717 --> 00:32:13,585
It's hard to breathe.

295
00:32:15,245 --> 00:32:16,311
What do you mean?

296
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:19,630
I think my throat's
getting bigger.

297
00:33:09,002 --> 00:33:11,160
It's okay, Charlie. We're
almost at the hospital, okay?

298
00:33:29,124 --> 00:33:31,124
Charlie!

299
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,272
You okay.

300
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:56,530
Okay.

301
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:06,761
Okay, good.
They're home.

302
00:36:07,423 --> 00:36:08,489
Good.

303
00:37:05,436 --> 00:37:07,593
I'm running out
for some balsam wood.

304
00:37:07,595 --> 00:37:08,820
You want anything?

305
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:11,319
I'm good, sweetheart.
Drive safe.

306
00:37:11,374 --> 00:37:13,997
Okay. Back in 20.

307
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:54,974
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

308
00:37:59,597 --> 00:38:03,779
Oh, no. I can't, I can't...

309
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:09,317
I just want to die!

310
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:18,081
Oh, God. It hurts too much!

311
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:20,219
I just need to die!

312
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,161
Charlie!

313
00:38:32,235 --> 00:38:36,094
Oh, God.

314
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:45,368
Oh, Charlie!

315
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:20,330
Hey, are you guys friends
with Becky on Facebook?

316
00:42:20,931 --> 00:42:22,631
You're friends with Becky?

317
00:42:23,218 --> 00:42:25,753
I said "Facebook friends."

318
00:42:26,673 --> 00:42:28,467
But seriously,
you see her statuses, bro?

319
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:30,254
Oh, my God,
dude, I know.

320
00:42:30,301 --> 00:42:32,785
- Like, every ten seconds.
- For real.

321
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,582
Oh, dude, what about, uh,
fucking... Let me hit that.

322
00:42:36,645 --> 00:42:38,713
- Brian?
- Brian and his girlfriend.

323
00:42:38,786 --> 00:42:40,020
He calls her something...

324
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:42,185
He calls her something really
goofy, dude. What does he...

325
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:43,306
Oh, he calls her princess.

326
00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:48,093
Who fucking calls
their girlfriend "princess"?

327
00:42:48,141 --> 00:42:49,806
What the fuck?

328
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,641
Dude, he's like,

329
00:42:50,672 --> 00:42:53,369
"I'm picking up
my princess from the airport.

330
00:42:53,424 --> 00:42:55,625
Fucking eating cous...
What the fuck.

331
00:42:55,688 --> 00:42:56,454
It's couscous.

332
00:42:56,503 --> 00:42:59,637
Couscous. I don't give a shit,
"...with my princess."

333
00:42:59,692 --> 00:43:00,970
You hit that shit?

334
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,126
Who's his girlfriend?

335
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:05,644
Some, uh, some fucking
stupid college chick.

336
00:43:06,901 --> 00:43:07,900
Oh, damn.

337
00:43:07,939 --> 00:43:10,319
I wanna fucking stupid
college princess, bro.

338
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:12,097
Yeah.

339
00:43:12,161 --> 00:43:13,897
Oh, hey dude.
Dude, dude, dude.

340
00:43:13,957 --> 00:43:15,116
Are you... Are you all right?

341
00:43:17,851 --> 00:43:20,517
I think I'm having a...
Like a reaction.

342
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,098
My throat is...

343
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,933
I think my throat
is getting bigger.

344
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,601
Dude, it's just it's...
It's just weed.

345
00:43:27,786 --> 00:43:29,505
Chill, man. It's all right.

346
00:43:29,678 --> 00:43:31,458
Just hold my hand. Hold on.

347
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:11,558
Uh, I'm so sorry
to chase you down.

348
00:45:11,605 --> 00:45:14,204
Uh, were you not
coming in, or...

349
00:45:14,885 --> 00:45:18,203
I... No, I just, um...
I forgot something.

350
00:45:18,256 --> 00:45:21,141
Oh, okay, sorry.
Sorry, I just...

351
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,713
I recognized you
from a few months ago.

352
00:45:24,585 --> 00:45:28,323
Oh, God.
I feel very silly. I'm Joan.

353
00:45:29,584 --> 00:45:30,919
Hi.

354
00:45:30,975 --> 00:45:32,581
Are you doing better?

355
00:45:33,757 --> 00:45:36,289
- What?
- After your mother?

356
00:45:36,939 --> 00:45:39,407
What? No, no.
That's not...

357
00:45:41,983 --> 00:45:44,901
My, um...
My daughter was killed.

358
00:45:45,305 --> 00:45:48,698
Oh. I'm...

359
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,328
I'm so, so sorry.

360
00:45:52,177 --> 00:45:55,056
Oh, would you like to
come in with me?

361
00:45:55,142 --> 00:45:57,065
Or we could even
just have a coffee.

362
00:45:57,111 --> 00:45:59,811
Uh, I'm sorry.
Really, I, um...

363
00:45:59,897 --> 00:46:02,407
I can't...
I really did forget something.

364
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:03,866
My son died.

365
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,115
Oh.

366
00:46:09,712 --> 00:46:11,245
I'm so sorry.

367
00:46:11,817 --> 00:46:13,517
How old was yours?

368
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:18,264
Thirteen.

369
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:21,625
God. That's awful.

370
00:46:23,372 --> 00:46:28,952
My son and my grandson
drowned four months ago.

371
00:46:29,395 --> 00:46:31,088
The little one was seven.

372
00:46:31,459 --> 00:46:32,874
Oh, my God!

373
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,825
I've been coming here
for a couple of months now.

374
00:46:37,848 --> 00:46:39,467
And it has helped.

375
00:46:39,686 --> 00:46:42,188
It doesn't
make it easier obviously,

376
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:46,678
but sometimes
it makes it less lonely.

377
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,165
Okay.

378
00:46:50,255 --> 00:46:52,988
And now I'm about to
embarrass myself but, uh,

379
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:59,290
if you need someone
to talk to...

380
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:01,645
'Cause we all do.

381
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:09,382
If you need it.

382
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:14,701
Okay.

383
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:17,096
Thank you. Really.

384
00:47:19,792 --> 00:47:20,873
Okay.

385
00:47:25,633 --> 00:47:26,844
Bye-bye.

386
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:41,276
- Hey.
- Hey.

387
00:47:42,698 --> 00:47:45,151
- I'm going to bed.
- Where were you?

388
00:47:45,223 --> 00:47:49,058
At the movies.
Gonna go to bed.

389
00:47:49,106 --> 00:47:51,241
Okay. I'll come up with you.

390
00:47:51,855 --> 00:47:52,968
Okay.

391
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,336
I'll be right back.

392
00:48:16,424 --> 00:48:18,867
No you won't.
You're taking the blanket.

393
00:48:19,705 --> 00:48:21,172
I can't sleep.

394
00:48:23,566 --> 00:48:25,133
It's freezing out there.

395
00:48:26,182 --> 00:48:27,661
Well, the heater's up there.

396
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:30,318
Okay.

397
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:33,323
Is that okay?

398
00:48:35,421 --> 00:48:37,390
If it gets too cold,
come back in.

399
00:48:42,328 --> 00:48:43,901
I just need to sleep.

400
00:50:13,388 --> 00:50:14,388
Shit.

401
00:51:18,204 --> 00:51:20,239
Oh, Annie. You came.

402
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:21,653
It's a little earlier
than we said.

403
00:51:21,655 --> 00:51:24,011
Ah, you're perfect.
Come in. Come in.

404
00:51:31,285 --> 00:51:33,711
Uh, your welcome mat.

405
00:51:34,118 --> 00:51:36,405
Ah!
It's kind of cute, huh?

406
00:51:36,407 --> 00:51:39,181
Yeah. My mother used to
embroider ones just like that.

407
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:41,515
Did she really?
Isn't that funny?

408
00:51:42,428 --> 00:51:44,461
Please come in. Sit.

409
00:51:45,675 --> 00:51:47,576
First there's the...

410
00:51:48,685 --> 00:51:50,642
The smell of something wrong.

411
00:51:52,538 --> 00:51:56,598
And then the body.

412
00:51:57,657 --> 00:52:03,492
Covered in black blood,
like tar.

413
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:12,586
And her head wasn't there
so I couldn't see her face.

414
00:52:12,627 --> 00:52:15,095
But they were gone.

415
00:52:16,382 --> 00:52:20,242
And her hands,
and her little finger nails.

416
00:52:55,842 --> 00:52:58,143
How is your relationship
with your son?

417
00:52:59,506 --> 00:53:01,562
- Peter?
- Hmm.

418
00:53:02,745 --> 00:53:04,853
Oh, God. Um...

419
00:53:07,786 --> 00:53:09,754
Okay, I sleepwalk.

420
00:53:12,235 --> 00:53:14,996
I mean, I haven't done it
in years, but, um...

421
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:18,740
A couple years ago,
I woke up

422
00:53:19,271 --> 00:53:22,316
and I was standing
next to Peter in Charlie's bed

423
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:25,460
when they shared a room.

424
00:53:27,683 --> 00:53:28,894
And they were

425
00:53:30,826 --> 00:53:33,793
completely covered
in paint thinner.

426
00:53:35,268 --> 00:53:36,869
And so was I.

427
00:53:37,776 --> 00:53:39,311
From head to toe.

428
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:45,426
And I was standing there
with a box of matches

429
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:47,207
and an empty can
of paint thinner.

430
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:51,468
And I woke myself up
striking the match,

431
00:53:51,509 --> 00:53:54,699
which also woke Peter up,
and he started to scream.

432
00:53:56,502 --> 00:53:58,437
And I immediately put
the match out.

433
00:53:58,507 --> 00:54:00,602
Like, immediately.

434
00:54:00,678 --> 00:54:03,154
I mean, I was just
as shocked as he was.

435
00:54:04,445 --> 00:54:07,318
And it was impossible
to convince them

436
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,439
that it was just sleepwalking,

437
00:54:09,558 --> 00:54:13,427
which of course it was, but...

438
00:54:14,142 --> 00:54:16,177
The timing was awful.

439
00:54:16,247 --> 00:54:19,053
Peter and I had gotten into
this stupid quarreling phase,

440
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:22,122
just forever arguing
about nothing, such...

441
00:54:24,715 --> 00:54:26,215
Frivolous stuff.

442
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:31,787
And Peter always held it
against me.

443
00:54:32,591 --> 00:54:34,164
And there was nothing
I can say

444
00:54:34,226 --> 00:54:36,260
and nothing I can do

445
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:39,745
because it happened.

446
00:54:42,995 --> 00:54:44,794
While I was asleep.

447
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,238
Hey! That was quick.

448
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:53,681
Did you bike all the way here?

449
00:54:53,775 --> 00:54:56,039
Um, no. Actually my friend
drove me home.

450
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:59,235
Oh, uh, by the way,
Peter, have you, um...

451
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:02,341
Have you signed up for that,
uh, SAT prep course?

452
00:55:02,406 --> 00:55:03,233
I'll do it tomorrow.

453
00:55:03,235 --> 00:55:04,771
Yeah, you know what,
you gotta do that

454
00:55:04,773 --> 00:55:06,305
because it's coming up.

455
00:55:42,459 --> 00:55:44,227
Jesus Christ, Annie.

456
00:55:45,678 --> 00:55:48,200
You're not planning on letting
him see that, are you?

457
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:49,885
- Who?
- Peter.

458
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:51,771
How do you think he's gonna
feel when he sees that?

459
00:55:51,773 --> 00:55:53,396
What? It's not about him.

460
00:55:53,398 --> 00:55:54,512
Oh, no?

461
00:55:54,514 --> 00:55:56,909
No. It's a neutral view
of the accident.

462
00:56:06,669 --> 00:56:08,494
Are you, uh, are you
coming down to dinner?

463
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:09,155
I'm making dinner.

464
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,489
No, I made the dinner.
I came to get you.

465
00:56:11,623 --> 00:56:14,280
Come, stay, whatever you want.
I don't really give a shit.

466
00:57:01,538 --> 00:57:03,133
This is really good, Dad.

467
00:57:04,475 --> 00:57:05,543
Thanks, buddy.

468
00:57:24,905 --> 00:57:26,422
You okay, Mom?

469
00:57:30,172 --> 00:57:31,173
What?

470
00:57:33,401 --> 00:57:35,368
Is there something
on your mind?

471
00:57:37,808 --> 00:57:39,608
Is there something
on your mind?

472
00:57:42,355 --> 00:57:47,032
It just seems like there might
be something you wanna say.

473
00:57:47,034 --> 00:57:48,447
- Peter...
- Like what?

474
00:57:48,486 --> 00:57:50,657
I mean, why would I wanna
say something

475
00:57:50,709 --> 00:57:52,593
so I can watch you
sneer at me.

476
00:57:53,939 --> 00:57:55,847
Sneer at you?
I don't ever sneer at you.

477
00:57:55,926 --> 00:57:56,999
Oh, sweetie.
You don't have to.

478
00:57:57,023 --> 00:57:58,447
You get your point across.

479
00:57:58,649 --> 00:58:00,532
Okay, so fine. Then say
what you wanna say then.

480
00:58:00,596 --> 00:58:01,276
Peter.

481
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:05,774
I don't wanna say anything.
I've tried saying things.

482
00:58:05,813 --> 00:58:07,256
Okay, so try again.
Release yourself.

483
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,829
Oh, release you, you mean.

484
00:58:08,876 --> 00:58:10,949
Yeah, fine. Release me.
Just say it.

485
00:58:10,981 --> 00:58:12,331
Just fucking say it!

486
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:14,798
Don't you swear at me,
you little shit!

487
00:58:14,853 --> 00:58:16,750
Don't you ever
raise your voice at me!

488
00:58:16,806 --> 00:58:18,632
I am your mother!

489
00:58:18,694 --> 00:58:20,131
Do you understand?

490
00:58:20,133 --> 00:58:24,173
All I do is worry and slave
and defend you.

491
00:58:24,175 --> 00:58:27,934
And all I get back is that
fucking face on your face.

492
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:31,248
So full of disdain
and resentment

493
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,168
and always so annoyed.

494
00:58:33,225 --> 00:58:35,284
Well, now your sister is dead.

495
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:39,106
And I know you miss her,
and I know it was an accident

496
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,469
and I know you're in pain.

497
00:58:40,505 --> 00:58:42,543
And I wish I could take that
away for you.

498
00:58:42,606 --> 00:58:45,297
I wish I could shield you
from the knowledge

499
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:49,349
that you did what you did,
but your sister is dead!

500
00:58:50,028 --> 00:58:51,828
She's gone forever!

501
00:58:53,462 --> 00:58:55,605
And what a waste.

502
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:58,313
If it could have maybe brought
us together or something.

503
00:58:58,367 --> 00:59:00,352
If you could have just said,
"I'm sorry",

504
00:59:00,399 --> 00:59:02,460
or faced up to what happened.

505
00:59:02,522 --> 00:59:05,022
Maybe then we could do
something with this.

506
00:59:05,092 --> 00:59:07,755
But you can't take
responsibility for anything!

507
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:10,594
So now I can't accept...

508
00:59:10,695 --> 00:59:14,800
And I can't forgive because...

509
00:59:17,342 --> 00:59:20,597
Because nobody admits
anything they've done!

510
00:59:52,228 --> 00:59:53,628
What about you, Mom?

511
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,225
She didn't wanna go
to the party.

512
01:00:03,251 --> 01:00:05,050
So why was she there?

513
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,980
All right. We're
stopping this right now.

514
01:00:10,727 --> 01:00:11,892
That's it.

515
01:00:14,052 --> 01:00:17,271
I said stop right now.

516
01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:18,572
Fine!

517
01:00:26,184 --> 01:00:27,183
Fine.

518
01:01:40,769 --> 01:01:42,002
Joan?

519
01:01:42,984 --> 01:01:45,546
Oh! Annie!

520
01:01:45,548 --> 01:01:48,708
- Hey.
- Oh!

521
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:50,938
- Annie!
- Hi!

522
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,031
Oh, my!

523
01:01:54,266 --> 01:01:55,756
How are you?

524
01:01:55,827 --> 01:01:57,955
- Oh, Annie! I'm...
- Are you okay?

525
01:01:59,616 --> 01:02:03,983
I'm... I am, yes.
I'm really good.

526
01:02:03,985 --> 01:02:08,090
- I'm really, really...
- Okay.

527
01:02:08,957 --> 01:02:12,608
Something's...
Something happened, Annie,

528
01:02:12,678 --> 01:02:17,467
and I feel completely
turned around.

529
01:02:17,556 --> 01:02:19,826
What happened?

530
01:02:19,896 --> 01:02:21,745
I don't even know
if I should say.

531
01:02:21,747 --> 01:02:22,988
What do you mean?

532
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,724
You're gonna think I am crazy!

533
01:02:24,726 --> 01:02:25,791
No, not at all.

534
01:02:25,855 --> 01:02:28,138
Oh. Okay.

535
01:02:29,099 --> 01:02:30,334
All right, come on.

536
01:02:32,728 --> 01:02:37,235
I met a spiritual medium.

537
01:02:38,627 --> 01:02:41,672
They were performing
an open séance.

538
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:43,432
I know, I know
what you're thinking,

539
01:02:43,434 --> 01:02:45,198
but they asked me to attend.

540
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:48,025
They were bringing skeptics
in and scientists.

541
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,704
So I went, fully skeptical.

542
01:02:50,758 --> 01:02:55,194
And what I experienced there,
Annie, was truly...

543
01:02:55,393 --> 01:02:56,137
Open séance...

544
01:02:56,139 --> 01:03:02,101
They brought in the spirit of
a man from the 19th century.

545
01:03:02,172 --> 01:03:05,963
And no, no, not in a kind of
smoke and mirrors way, no.

546
01:03:05,965 --> 01:03:07,167
And the man sitting
next to me

547
01:03:07,169 --> 01:03:10,492
was a completely
cynical neurologist

548
01:03:10,494 --> 01:03:14,833
and he looked permanently
changed by the end of it.

549
01:03:14,888 --> 01:03:18,022
No, I... I... I know
what you're thinking. I do.

550
01:03:18,076 --> 01:03:21,763
But I... I approached
the medium afterwards

551
01:03:21,834 --> 01:03:24,578
and I asked her about my son
and my grandson

552
01:03:24,605 --> 01:03:27,639
and she came to my apartment
and she...

553
01:03:33,173 --> 01:03:35,319
She ended up performing...

554
01:03:36,293 --> 01:03:40,651
Well... She conjured
my grandson.

555
01:03:41,627 --> 01:03:44,495
No, no, no, I know, I know
what that smile is. I know.

556
01:03:44,497 --> 01:03:46,965
Annie, Annie...
I wouldn't believe it either,

557
01:03:46,967 --> 01:03:48,578
I didn't believe it,

558
01:03:48,919 --> 01:03:52,495
but I heard his voice.

559
01:03:53,217 --> 01:03:56,009
I felt his presence
in the room.

560
01:03:56,011 --> 01:03:58,468
Annie, this is real.

561
01:04:00,204 --> 01:04:01,977
What are you doing right now?

562
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:04,040
I'm just here shopping.

563
01:04:04,042 --> 01:04:05,448
Do you wanna come over?

564
01:04:05,651 --> 01:04:08,963
Oh, Annie. Please, Annie.
I really think you should.

565
01:04:09,038 --> 01:04:11,973
It would be everything
if you came.

566
01:04:24,584 --> 01:04:26,218
Nice mood setter.

567
01:04:36,069 --> 01:04:37,468
Okay.

568
01:04:39,205 --> 01:04:41,513
I'm going to put my hand
on the glass,

569
01:04:42,847 --> 01:04:44,988
but I'm not going to
add pressure.

570
01:04:45,865 --> 01:04:47,465
You do the same.

571
01:04:56,237 --> 01:04:57,736
All right.

572
01:05:02,984 --> 01:05:04,378
Louis...

573
01:05:06,866 --> 01:05:09,900
Louis, are you here?
It's Grandma.

574
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:24,799
Louis, if you are here
with us,

575
01:05:25,997 --> 01:05:29,463
please just try
and slide the glass.

576
01:05:33,876 --> 01:05:37,746
Louis, if you're here...

577
01:05:40,672 --> 01:05:41,971
Hi, Louis!

578
01:05:42,029 --> 01:05:45,532
- Hi, Louis!
- How did you do that?

579
01:05:46,447 --> 01:05:50,836
Louis, I'm going to ask you
some questions. Okay, sweetie?

580
01:05:51,258 --> 01:05:55,584
If the answer is yes,
slide the glass to the right.

581
01:05:55,976 --> 01:05:57,574
If it's no,

582
01:05:57,716 --> 01:06:00,863
slide it the other way,
to the left.

583
01:06:00,995 --> 01:06:02,668
Do you understand?

584
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:09,279
Louis, are you okay?

585
01:06:12,223 --> 01:06:13,823
Are you in pain?

586
01:06:15,076 --> 01:06:18,316
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay. It's okay.

587
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:20,548
It's okay. It's okay.

588
01:06:20,611 --> 01:06:23,711
Louis, I brought
your chalkboard.

589
01:06:24,003 --> 01:06:26,702
Remember your chalkboard?

590
01:06:27,674 --> 01:06:29,641
Can you write something?

591
01:06:58,244 --> 01:07:02,148
Oh, Louis!
I love you, sweetheart!

592
01:07:02,495 --> 01:07:04,595
I'm sorry.
Could we stop?

593
01:07:05,245 --> 01:07:06,040
What?

594
01:07:06,087 --> 01:07:08,190
- I'm sorry.
- Please...

595
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:10,721
Louis, we're going to stop
for a second,

596
01:07:10,783 --> 01:07:12,649
but I'll be right back.

597
01:07:16,429 --> 01:07:17,155
Are you all right?

598
01:07:17,157 --> 01:07:18,649
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I really...

599
01:07:18,651 --> 01:07:20,220
I understand, I understand.

600
01:07:20,222 --> 01:07:22,248
That's exactly how I reacted
the first time.

601
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,744
I have to go. Okay.
I'm... I'm sorry. Thank you.

602
01:07:23,746 --> 01:07:26,513
- No, no. It's okay. It's okay.
- Thank you. Yeah.

603
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:36,848
I know. I know, honey.

604
01:07:36,925 --> 01:07:38,897
If you want to try this
on your own...

605
01:07:38,955 --> 01:07:41,521
- God...
- It's okay. It's okay.

606
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:43,653
First light the candle,

607
01:07:43,724 --> 01:07:46,478
then choose an item that
belonged to your daughter.

608
01:07:46,534 --> 01:07:49,334
That will be your link.
Mine was the chalkboard.

609
01:07:49,389 --> 01:07:50,755
That's my link.

610
01:07:50,937 --> 01:07:53,004
It's all right.
It's all right.

611
01:07:53,124 --> 01:07:55,769
It's okay. There you go.

612
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:57,305
Then when you're ready,

613
01:07:57,662 --> 01:07:59,631
read this out loud,

614
01:07:59,633 --> 01:08:02,561
every syllable,
very carefully.

615
01:08:02,837 --> 01:08:05,187
Sorry, why?
What is it?

616
01:08:05,234 --> 01:08:06,712
I don't know
what language it is.

617
01:08:06,714 --> 01:08:08,900
The medium
had me read it first.

618
01:08:08,974 --> 01:08:10,940
It's to make things start.

619
01:08:11,027 --> 01:08:13,540
But remember,
your whole family...

620
01:08:13,565 --> 01:08:16,274
Every member needs to be
in the house.

621
01:08:16,345 --> 01:08:19,096
Your son, everyone.
Very important.

622
01:08:19,098 --> 01:08:20,819
- Okay.
- Okay?

623
01:08:21,203 --> 01:08:23,372
Deep breath.

624
01:08:23,406 --> 01:08:25,159
You didn't kill her, Annie.

625
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:31,648
What?

626
01:08:32,271 --> 01:08:34,205
She isn't gone.

627
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:22,924
Mom?
What are you doing?

628
01:11:28,011 --> 01:11:29,526
What's going on?

629
01:11:30,681 --> 01:11:32,346
You're sleepwalking.

630
01:11:39,138 --> 01:11:42,971
I'm sorry. Is Charlie here?

631
01:11:45,703 --> 01:11:47,698
Why are you scared of me?

632
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,883
What?

633
01:11:56,816 --> 01:11:58,781
I never wanted
to be your mother.

634
01:12:03,639 --> 01:12:04,745
Why?

635
01:12:05,325 --> 01:12:06,992
I was scared.

636
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:12,066
I didn't feel like a mother.

637
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,554
But she pressured me.

638
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:16,802
Then why did you have me?

639
01:12:16,851 --> 01:12:19,721
It wasn't my fault.
I tried to stop it.

640
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,070
How?

641
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:27,606
I tried to have a miscarriage.

642
01:12:30,538 --> 01:12:31,723
How?

643
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:33,944
However I could.

644
01:12:33,946 --> 01:12:37,050
I did everything they told me
not to do but it didn't work.

645
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:39,485
I'm happy it didn't work.

646
01:12:39,891 --> 01:12:41,736
You tried to kill me.

647
01:12:41,793 --> 01:12:43,588
No, I did not. I love you!

648
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:44,822
You tried to kill me!

649
01:12:44,846 --> 01:12:46,694
- I love you!
- Why did you try to kill me?

650
01:12:46,718 --> 01:12:48,218
I didn't!
I was trying to save you!

651
01:12:48,274 --> 01:12:50,318
Why did you try to kill me?

652
01:13:17,069 --> 01:13:18,246
Peter?

653
01:13:20,322 --> 01:13:21,884
Peter, sweetheart? Wake up.

654
01:13:21,886 --> 01:13:24,110
- What?
- It's okay. It's me.

655
01:13:24,157 --> 01:13:26,601
I am so, so sorry
for everything.

656
01:13:26,657 --> 01:13:28,063
- Please, please forgive me.
- It's okay.

657
01:13:28,087 --> 01:13:29,280
I can't stand
the things I said.

658
01:13:29,282 --> 01:13:30,749
It's okay. It's okay.

659
01:13:32,356 --> 01:13:34,705
Can you get up, sweetheart?
We're gonna try something.

660
01:13:34,729 --> 01:13:36,217
I was having a nightmare.

661
01:13:36,256 --> 01:13:37,717
Oh, it's okay.
We can do something.

662
01:13:37,764 --> 01:13:38,581
Do what?

663
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:40,618
I figured it out.
Come on, come on.

664
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:46,085
Steven. Baby. Steve, wake up.

665
01:13:47,265 --> 01:13:48,591
- What?
- Come downstairs.

666
01:13:48,655 --> 01:13:49,889
We're gonna try
something together.

667
01:13:49,913 --> 01:13:52,061
Come on, come on.

668
01:13:54,525 --> 01:13:56,011
Steve, come on. Let's go.

669
01:14:10,609 --> 01:14:12,374
- Dad?
- It's okay.

670
01:14:20,347 --> 01:14:21,774
Come on, come on!

671
01:14:28,245 --> 01:14:30,909
Okay. So...

672
01:14:31,032 --> 01:14:33,027
It's freezing in here.

673
01:14:33,056 --> 01:14:34,755
Wait! No, no, no.
What are you doing? Wait!

674
01:14:34,779 --> 01:14:35,755
I'm gonna close the window.

675
01:14:35,757 --> 01:14:37,201
No, no.
We can't change anything.

676
01:14:37,203 --> 01:14:38,702
I don't wanna mess it up.

677
01:14:38,866 --> 01:14:41,112
Everyone needs to sit.
Come sit.

678
01:14:41,943 --> 01:14:43,496
My friend Joan taught me
how to do this.

679
01:14:43,519 --> 01:14:46,153
What friend Joan?

680
01:14:46,396 --> 01:14:47,717
We need our palms on the table

681
01:14:47,719 --> 01:14:49,404
and our fingers to touch.
Please.

682
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:50,844
What are we doing here, Annie?

683
01:14:50,889 --> 01:14:52,323
Please. You'll see.

684
01:14:54,298 --> 01:14:57,456
Please. Trust me.

685
01:15:00,879 --> 01:15:02,303
All right, fine.

686
01:15:06,069 --> 01:15:08,135
We can do it over here then.

687
01:15:08,763 --> 01:15:11,063
Peter. Okay.

688
01:15:12,272 --> 01:15:14,703
Okay, Steve. Come on.

689
01:15:15,631 --> 01:15:17,475
I need you both
to concentrate.

690
01:15:17,477 --> 01:15:18,367
On what?

691
01:15:18,369 --> 01:15:19,353
Think about Charlie,
if you can.

692
01:15:19,355 --> 01:15:21,785
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- Sweetheart, please, please.

693
01:15:21,787 --> 01:15:22,855
I tried this 20 minutes ago

694
01:15:22,857 --> 01:15:24,257
- and it worked.
- What worked?

695
01:15:24,259 --> 01:15:25,234
I would not be bringing you
down here if it didn't.

696
01:15:25,236 --> 01:15:26,094
Well, I just need to show you.

697
01:15:26,096 --> 01:15:29,775
- Show what?
- Fuck! I'm a...

698
01:15:30,205 --> 01:15:31,377
I'm a medium, okay?

699
01:15:31,379 --> 01:15:32,756
I was
seeing apparitions earlier

700
01:15:32,758 --> 01:15:34,994
and I just shook them off
and I shouldn't have.

701
01:15:35,282 --> 01:15:36,369
Please, I know how it sounds,

702
01:15:36,393 --> 01:15:37,414
but there's no way
to talk about it.

703
01:15:37,438 --> 01:15:39,627
I just need to show you, okay?
Please, you'll see.

704
01:15:39,682 --> 01:15:41,536
- I'm completely lucid.
- Peter, go to bed.

705
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:43,315
What! No, no, no!
Peter, please!

706
01:15:43,354 --> 01:15:44,315
We need to do this
as a family.

707
01:15:44,317 --> 01:15:47,112
This needs all our energies,
okay? Together.

708
01:15:47,148 --> 01:15:49,583
All right, I'll stay.

709
01:15:49,821 --> 01:15:51,414
Steve. Steve, please.

710
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:53,742
I really, really need you
to be open to this.

711
01:15:53,744 --> 01:15:56,806
Please, please.
I promise... Both of you.

712
01:15:56,874 --> 01:15:59,761
Please. I need you
to be open. Please.

713
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:03,616
Come on, Steve.
Come on, come on. I promise.

714
01:16:03,618 --> 01:16:06,708
Okay.

715
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:08,850
Okay, good.

716
01:16:09,184 --> 01:16:11,220
So, I read that earlier.

717
01:16:11,222 --> 01:16:13,055
I don't think
I need to read that again.

718
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,721
What language is even that?

719
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,567
Try to concentrate.

720
01:16:25,388 --> 01:16:26,509
Charlie?

721
01:16:28,044 --> 01:16:29,651
Charlie, are you here?

722
01:16:37,758 --> 01:16:39,291
Charlie, it's Mommy.

723
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:41,898
And Daddy and Peter.

724
01:16:49,114 --> 01:16:51,649
Charlie, if you're
in this room with us,

725
01:16:51,861 --> 01:16:53,759
I'm gonna have us all
touch the glass.

726
01:16:53,761 --> 01:16:55,194
Don't add pressure.

727
01:16:56,343 --> 01:16:57,875
Now if you're in here,
Charlie,

728
01:16:57,961 --> 01:17:00,248
I want you to move
the glass for us.

729
01:17:00,317 --> 01:17:01,500
Even if it's just a tiny bit.

730
01:17:01,502 --> 01:17:02,606
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Annie!
- Even if it's just the tiniest

731
01:17:02,608 --> 01:17:04,242
little movement.
Okay, Charlie?

732
01:17:06,545 --> 01:17:07,602
Okay.

733
01:17:08,681 --> 01:17:12,540
Shit. What the hell?

734
01:17:13,413 --> 01:17:15,380
- What?
- You don't feel that?

735
01:17:15,933 --> 01:17:16,872
What? Feel what?

736
01:17:16,874 --> 01:17:20,763
Like, you don't feel
the air flexing?

737
01:17:24,198 --> 01:17:26,263
Wow! Yes!

738
01:17:26,265 --> 01:17:28,632
Thank you, Charlie!
That was so good!

739
01:17:28,896 --> 01:17:32,202
Okay. Now, Charlie,
what I'd like for you to do

740
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:35,166
is I'd like for you to show
them what you did earlier.

741
01:17:39,537 --> 01:17:41,057
Can you show them what
you just did for me before?

742
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:43,178
- Mom.
- She's gonna do it.

743
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:49,974
- That's enough!
- What! No, no, no!

744
01:17:49,976 --> 01:17:52,304
Listen,
when I did this earlier,

745
01:17:52,683 --> 01:17:55,389
this manifested on the page.
I saw it!

746
01:17:55,391 --> 01:17:56,837
- I saw it!
- What is it?

747
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:58,290
- It's Charlie!
- Annie!

748
01:17:58,292 --> 01:17:59,449
Charlie, did you want to draw
some more?

749
01:17:59,473 --> 01:18:01,517
- You can keep going.
- Stop it! Stop it!

750
01:18:01,548 --> 01:18:03,763
Okay, we need to keep
our fingers touching...

751
01:18:03,765 --> 01:18:05,484
You are scaring him!

752
01:18:05,486 --> 01:18:07,979
No, I am not!
Peter, Peter, listen...

753
01:18:07,981 --> 01:18:09,101
Stop it!

754
01:18:09,103 --> 01:18:11,588
Listen to me.
There is no need to be scared.

755
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:12,760
This is your sister.

756
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:15,038
Mom.

757
01:18:17,936 --> 01:18:20,626
Charlie, what's wrong?

758
01:19:00,907 --> 01:19:01,906
Hello?

759
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:06,267
- Mom?
- Mom? Mom?

760
01:19:06,269 --> 01:19:07,351
I don't like this.

761
01:19:07,353 --> 01:19:08,977
- Dad, I don't like this.
- What's happening?

762
01:19:08,979 --> 01:19:10,351
- Please stop.
- Annie, please, stop this.

763
01:19:10,353 --> 01:19:11,408
- What's going on?
- Please stop this.

764
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:12,817
- Please.
- Mom!

765
01:19:12,819 --> 01:19:14,371
You're really freaking me out.
Please stop.

766
01:19:14,373 --> 01:19:15,541
What's happening?
Why is everyone scared?

767
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:16,782
Dad, make it stop.

768
01:19:17,337 --> 01:19:18,685
Why
are you scaring me!

769
01:19:18,734 --> 01:19:20,937
Make it stop! Make it stop!
Make it fucking stop!

770
01:19:20,984 --> 01:19:23,023
- Make it stop!
- Where's Mom!

771
01:19:23,087 --> 01:19:26,064
Stop it!
Stop it now! Please stop!

772
01:19:26,108 --> 01:19:28,109
Mom? Peter?
Peter, I'm scared.

773
01:19:28,158 --> 01:19:30,119
Dad, make it stop!

774
01:19:30,207 --> 01:19:33,965
What the hell?
What are you doing?

775
01:19:42,821 --> 01:19:44,288
What happened?

776
01:20:28,572 --> 01:20:31,076
Our country has had
many ups and downs

777
01:20:31,078 --> 01:20:32,389
economically speaking.

778
01:20:32,391 --> 01:20:33,856
We've talked
about the struggles

779
01:20:33,894 --> 01:20:38,743
during the 1800s
compared to the fall of 1929,

780
01:20:39,006 --> 01:20:41,600
in an era that
become known appropriately

781
01:20:41,655 --> 01:20:43,302
as the Great Depression.

782
01:20:43,304 --> 01:20:47,355
For a decade we suffered
through many, many hardships.

783
01:20:47,403 --> 01:20:52,272
In 1929, Wall Street had been
going so well

784
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:56,292
that when it finally crashed
because of the Great Boom,

785
01:20:56,355 --> 01:21:00,920
it caused a huge decline
in the economy.

786
01:21:01,026 --> 01:21:04,653
So much so
that it caused food lines.

787
01:21:07,493 --> 01:21:10,798
This is where
the Federal Government has,

788
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,197
or still has...

789
01:21:22,865 --> 01:21:25,107
Uh, uh. Yes, Peter?

790
01:21:25,109 --> 01:21:27,638
Um, I'm sorry.
I have to go to the bathroom.

791
01:21:27,715 --> 01:21:30,285
Um, of course. Take the pass.

792
01:21:33,846 --> 01:21:35,169
As I was saying...

793
01:21:40,799 --> 01:21:41,798
Hello?

794
01:21:42,053 --> 01:21:43,767
<i>Can you guess
who just called me from school</i>

795
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:45,784
<i>in complete hysterics?</i>

796
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:49,283
- Charlie?
- <i>What?</i>

797
01:21:50,692 --> 01:21:52,945
Uh, nothing. What happened?

798
01:21:52,947 --> 01:21:54,441
<i>Peter just called me, Annie,</i>

799
01:21:54,443 --> 01:21:56,550
<i>terrified,
crying in the halls,</i>

800
01:21:56,552 --> 01:21:57,655
<i>convinced
he's being threatened</i>

801
01:21:57,657 --> 01:22:00,117
<i>by some vengeful spirit.</i>

802
01:22:00,172 --> 01:22:02,193
Why does he think
he's being threatened?

803
01:22:02,231 --> 01:22:05,235
<i>Listen to me, Annie.
I have a son to protect.</i>

804
01:22:05,711 --> 01:22:06,412
What does that mean?

805
01:22:06,414 --> 01:22:08,715
<i>It means that that's what
I'm worried about right now</i>

806
01:22:08,753 --> 01:22:09,631
<i>and that's how...</i>

807
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,065
Hey, don't talk to me
like this.

808
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,698
He's my son too...

809
01:22:12,955 --> 01:22:13,954
Oh!

810
01:22:24,598 --> 01:22:27,158
Do not hang up on me again.

811
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:30,489
I am not sleepwalking anymore.
Do you understand?

812
01:22:55,624 --> 01:22:56,644
<i>At the tone,</i>

813
01:22:56,646 --> 01:22:58,777
<i>please record
your voice message.</i>

814
01:22:58,779 --> 01:23:00,248
<i>When you are
finished recording,</i>

815
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:03,297
<i>you may hang up or press pound
for more options.</i>

816
01:23:03,299 --> 01:23:05,148
<i>Annie, hi!</i>

817
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:07,396
<i>This is Patrick
at the Archer Gallery.</i>

818
01:23:07,398 --> 01:23:10,847
<i>Um, I was just calling
first to see how you're doing,</i>

819
01:23:10,849 --> 01:23:12,527
<i>how your family's doing.</i>

820
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:13,819
<i>We've all been thinking
about you</i>

821
01:23:13,821 --> 01:23:16,076
<i>and just worrying about you</i>

822
01:23:16,078 --> 01:23:18,170
<i>and hoping you're okay.</i>

823
01:23:18,172 --> 01:23:20,734
<i>You guys have been in our
constant thoughts and prayers.</i>

824
01:23:20,736 --> 01:23:26,022
<i>And then also, uh, we just
wanted to, well, to say first,</i>

825
01:23:26,024 --> 01:23:28,773
<i>if you need us to postpone
the show or push the date,</i>

826
01:23:28,805 --> 01:23:30,659
<i>it's obviously more than okay.</i>

827
01:23:30,893 --> 01:23:34,820
<i>And if not, uh,
we just wanna call and see</i>

828
01:23:34,864 --> 01:23:38,125
<i>if we could help
in any way or offer...</i>

829
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:52,781
Oh, jeez. That smell.

830
01:24:02,264 --> 01:24:04,390
Annie?
What's that smell?

831
01:24:29,835 --> 01:24:31,375
What the fuck happened here?

832
01:24:32,405 --> 01:24:34,692
I didn't feel like
looking at it anymore.

833
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:24,357
Charlie?

834
01:28:04,442 --> 01:28:06,994
Peter?
Oh my God, Peter!

835
01:28:08,086 --> 01:28:09,507
What's wrong, baby?
What's happening?

836
01:28:09,509 --> 01:28:10,552
What are you doing?

837
01:28:10,554 --> 01:28:11,567
What do you mean?

838
01:28:11,569 --> 01:28:13,233
You were pulling on my head!

839
01:28:13,235 --> 01:28:14,384
What? No I wasn't.
I just came in.

840
01:28:14,408 --> 01:28:16,681
You were screaming.
What happened?

841
01:28:16,751 --> 01:28:17,994
I saw Charlie in the corner

842
01:28:17,996 --> 01:28:19,970
and then you started
trying to pull my head off!

843
01:28:19,972 --> 01:28:21,932
Oh, Peter.
I would never do that to you.

844
01:28:21,934 --> 01:28:23,750
Are you crazy? Please, baby.

845
01:28:25,144 --> 01:28:26,712
What corner
did you see Charlie?

846
01:28:28,423 --> 01:28:29,776
Peter, listen to me.

847
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,960
I don't know what's happening
or what you just saw,

848
01:28:32,023 --> 01:28:33,662
but I am stopping this.

849
01:28:33,724 --> 01:28:35,743
Do not tell Dad
what you just said to me.

850
01:28:35,776 --> 01:28:37,858
Do not, okay?
Because it is not true.

851
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:38,745
Something is happening

852
01:28:38,747 --> 01:28:39,814
and I'm the only one
who could stop it.

853
01:28:39,816 --> 01:28:41,800
Do you understand?
I'm the only one

854
01:28:41,802 --> 01:28:43,123
who can fix this.

855
01:31:24,798 --> 01:31:25,908
Joan?

856
01:31:30,466 --> 01:31:32,773
Joan, please.
I need to talk to you.

857
01:31:36,370 --> 01:31:39,189
Joan, I really need
to ask you a question.

858
01:31:46,576 --> 01:31:47,777
Joan!

859
01:32:10,491 --> 01:32:12,007
Peter!

860
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,764
Peter!

861
01:32:21,290 --> 01:32:23,243
Peter!

862
01:32:27,055 --> 01:32:29,340
I expel you!

863
01:32:33,137 --> 01:32:34,970
Zantany!

864
01:32:39,735 --> 01:32:41,166
Dagdany!

865
01:32:43,612 --> 01:32:45,419
Aparagon!

866
01:32:47,885 --> 01:32:49,659
Peter!

867
01:32:49,950 --> 01:32:53,080
Get out!

868
01:32:57,373 --> 01:32:58,858
Peter!

869
01:33:28,926 --> 01:33:30,131
Oh, God.

870
01:36:58,951 --> 01:37:01,918
...so everyone
feels justified.

871
01:37:03,559 --> 01:37:07,197
Iphigenia's murder
was commanded by the gods.

872
01:37:37,886 --> 01:37:40,456
So, really,
Agamemnon had no choice...

873
01:38:09,145 --> 01:38:10,478
Peter.

874
01:38:12,435 --> 01:38:14,201
Peter, what's wrong?

875
01:38:16,684 --> 01:38:18,783
Peter, are you all right?

876
01:38:24,286 --> 01:38:26,759
Can he breathe?

877
01:38:26,883 --> 01:38:28,333
Peter,
what are you doing, man?

878
01:39:09,992 --> 01:39:12,556
<i>Call from West High School.</i>

879
01:39:32,739 --> 01:39:33,973
Hello.

880
01:39:35,102 --> 01:39:36,265
Yes, it is.

881
01:40:14,506 --> 01:40:16,222
Oh, thank God.

882
01:40:18,417 --> 01:40:20,922
Wait, what? Oh my God!

883
01:40:20,977 --> 01:40:23,643
What happened?
What happened to him?

884
01:40:23,705 --> 01:40:25,773
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

885
01:40:25,806 --> 01:40:29,497
Oh my God. Oh, no.
Oh, who did that?

886
01:40:29,563 --> 01:40:31,975
He did it, apparently,
to himself.

887
01:40:33,628 --> 01:40:35,198
Smashed his face
into his own desk.

888
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,855
Okay, Steve. Wait, wait.
Wait, Steve. Listen.

889
01:40:37,857 --> 01:40:40,432
Take his feet.
Please, take his feet.

890
01:40:45,978 --> 01:40:49,136
Steve, uh, upstairs...

891
01:40:49,197 --> 01:40:53,308
In the attic when you were
gone, I went up there and I...

892
01:40:53,355 --> 01:40:54,311
I just... I really need you

893
01:40:54,313 --> 01:40:56,146
to go up there
and see what I saw.

894
01:40:57,233 --> 01:40:58,806
There's a body.

895
01:40:59,827 --> 01:41:01,114
Yeah. I mean,
I think it's my mother,

896
01:41:01,116 --> 01:41:02,951
I think, but I can't tell
because the skin's all black

897
01:41:02,953 --> 01:41:05,486
and she's all distended
but the head is gone.

898
01:41:06,913 --> 01:41:09,880
Will you, please? I just need
you to go and see upstairs.

899
01:41:11,636 --> 01:41:14,283
Please, Steve.

900
01:41:25,897 --> 01:41:27,331
And then there's more.

901
01:41:27,982 --> 01:41:30,742
You mean more than your
mother's headless body?

902
01:41:30,831 --> 01:41:32,264
Of course there is.

903
01:42:19,984 --> 01:42:22,210
- Jesus, fuck!
- Okay, there's more.

904
01:42:22,212 --> 01:42:23,950
What the fuck was that?

905
01:42:23,952 --> 01:42:25,294
Why didn't you
call the police?

906
01:42:25,296 --> 01:42:26,937
The police can't help us.

907
01:42:27,522 --> 01:42:28,360
Who the fuck is that up there?

908
01:42:28,362 --> 01:42:30,593
Do you remember Joan,
my friend whose grandson died?

909
01:42:30,595 --> 01:42:33,103
- She took me to her apartment.
- It did look like your mother.

910
01:42:33,162 --> 01:42:34,796
Well, listen. She taught me
how to do the séance.

911
01:42:34,798 --> 01:42:37,287
I didn't even want to, but she
brought her grandson back

912
01:42:37,289 --> 01:42:39,529
and I saw it and felt it just
like you did with Charlie.

913
01:42:39,531 --> 01:42:41,933
Now, look.
This is my mother's album.

914
01:42:41,935 --> 01:42:43,594
Now look here. See this?

915
01:42:43,596 --> 01:42:46,111
See her?
That's her. That's Joan.

916
01:42:46,113 --> 01:42:47,465
She didn't even mention
knowing my mom

917
01:42:47,467 --> 01:42:49,226
and I've never met her before,
but she approached me.

918
01:42:49,228 --> 01:42:50,513
She consoled me.

919
01:42:50,515 --> 01:42:52,720
She told me about this séance,
and she showed me how.

920
01:42:52,722 --> 01:42:53,864
Now look at this.
See this symbol?

921
01:42:53,888 --> 01:42:54,829
On the necklace
my mom gave me.

922
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:56,707
It's her necklace, right?
They're both wearing it,

923
01:42:56,709 --> 01:42:58,855
and they're wearing it
in every photo.

924
01:42:58,857 --> 01:43:00,950
And look at that pattern!
Did you see up there?

925
01:43:00,952 --> 01:43:03,508
This was painted
above the body, right?

926
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:04,990
In blood!

927
01:43:06,109 --> 01:43:10,045
You dug up the grave.
It was you, wasn't it?

928
01:43:10,123 --> 01:43:10,800
What?

929
01:43:10,802 --> 01:43:11,700
All those nights you were

930
01:43:11,702 --> 01:43:13,000
pretending to go
to the movies.

931
01:43:13,002 --> 01:43:14,040
You're not even listening!

932
01:43:14,042 --> 01:43:15,783
And then the day
the cemetery called, I said,

933
01:43:15,785 --> 01:43:17,993
"Oh, I won't tell her
because she'd be worried."

934
01:43:17,995 --> 01:43:20,299
Oh, God damn it!
Listen to me, Steve!

935
01:43:20,301 --> 01:43:21,816
I know you don't trust me

936
01:43:21,818 --> 01:43:23,709
and there is nothing
I can do about that.

937
01:43:24,475 --> 01:43:26,977
But they put a curse on us
when we brought Charlie back.

938
01:43:26,979 --> 01:43:28,961
We made a pact with something.

939
01:43:28,963 --> 01:43:29,878
Something that is
in this house.

940
01:43:29,909 --> 01:43:31,708
I don't know what it is
but it is after Peter.

941
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:34,620
I watched these pages fill.

942
01:43:34,622 --> 01:43:37,177
All of them are Peter!

943
01:43:37,588 --> 01:43:39,601
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I did.

944
01:43:39,603 --> 01:43:42,645
I don't know what I did
but Peter is in danger...

945
01:43:43,108 --> 01:43:45,076
And I started it.

946
01:43:45,607 --> 01:43:47,713
Now if we destroy this book,

947
01:43:48,212 --> 01:43:50,024
it will take me too.

948
01:43:51,079 --> 01:43:52,551
I tried to burn it. I tried.

949
01:43:52,553 --> 01:43:54,417
But my arm caught on fire
on its own

950
01:43:54,419 --> 01:43:55,979
as if I was linked to it
because I am linked to it.

951
01:43:55,981 --> 01:43:58,549
I understand this now. Please!

952
01:43:59,028 --> 01:44:01,029
If we don't destroy
this book...

953
01:44:04,087 --> 01:44:05,790
Peter will...

954
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:09,987
Oh, God. Do you understand?

955
01:44:11,238 --> 01:44:15,537
We have to do this. Please,
please, please, please.

956
01:44:15,614 --> 01:44:17,080
For Peter.

957
01:44:28,331 --> 01:44:30,398
I need you to trust me, Steve.

958
01:44:32,132 --> 01:44:35,072
It needs to be me.
It's my fault.

959
01:44:35,074 --> 01:44:38,689
It's my fault.
I know it's my fault. Please.

960
01:44:38,691 --> 01:44:41,792
Please, I need you
to throw it in the fire.

961
01:44:42,993 --> 01:44:44,330
Please, I just...
I can't do it.

962
01:44:44,332 --> 01:44:46,791
I can't.
I'm just too fucking scared.

963
01:44:46,793 --> 01:44:48,666
But if we don't do it...

964
01:44:48,668 --> 01:44:51,235
If we don't do it,
it's gonna be Peter,

965
01:44:51,291 --> 01:44:54,635
it's gonna be our son.
Okay, I know this. I know so.

966
01:44:54,637 --> 01:44:57,658
Just, please, please,
please, please, please...

967
01:45:02,657 --> 01:45:05,196
Steve, please.
Please understand, baby.

968
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:09,743
Please, please.
Please throw it in the fire.

969
01:45:18,015 --> 01:45:20,062
Sweetheart, please.

970
01:45:20,329 --> 01:45:22,663
Please take it, take it.
You gotta do it.

971
01:45:22,665 --> 01:45:23,771
You gotta do it.

972
01:45:24,070 --> 01:45:26,058
Okay. Thank you, thank you.

973
01:45:26,128 --> 01:45:30,219
Okay, here. Okay.

974
01:45:30,265 --> 01:45:32,199
Now listen to me.
Listen to me.

975
01:45:39,522 --> 01:45:43,737
Oh! You are
the love of my life.

976
01:45:48,821 --> 01:45:52,438
I love you, Steve.
I love you so, so much.

977
01:45:53,296 --> 01:45:55,810
Oh, God, I love you so much.

978
01:45:55,937 --> 01:45:57,749
And I love Peter so much.

979
01:46:02,033 --> 01:46:03,485
Now please, just...

980
01:46:05,015 --> 01:46:06,815
Please just throw it in.

981
01:46:24,856 --> 01:46:27,043
I'm not gonna do this
with you anymore.

982
01:46:27,798 --> 01:46:29,846
What? No, no, no!

983
01:46:29,902 --> 01:46:32,169
No, no,
it's not helpful for you.

984
01:46:32,882 --> 01:46:35,417
You are sick, Annie.

985
01:46:36,214 --> 01:46:37,935
I need to call the police.

986
01:46:38,945 --> 01:46:40,778
Oh, God!

987
01:47:47,859 --> 01:47:48,926
Mom?

988
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:53,786
Dad?

989
01:49:30,779 --> 01:49:31,911
Mom?

990
01:49:33,059 --> 01:49:34,058
Dad?

991
01:50:00,180 --> 01:50:01,580
Hello?

992
01:50:49,333 --> 01:50:50,965
Mom?

993
01:53:30,077 --> 01:53:32,658
Stop! Mom, please stop!

994
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:34,911
Mom, I'm sorry!
Okay, I'm sorry.

995
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:42,443
Mommy. Mommy, please.
I'm begging you.

996
01:53:42,459 --> 01:53:44,159
I'm begging you to stop.

997
01:53:52,357 --> 01:53:53,495
Mommy?

998
01:55:10,404 --> 01:55:12,209
Just gotta wake up.

999
01:55:12,211 --> 01:55:14,531
You just gotta wake up.
Come on. You're okay.

1000
01:55:14,533 --> 01:55:17,711
Just wake up. Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

1001
02:01:34,038 --> 02:01:38,352
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
It's all right.

1002
02:01:38,892 --> 02:01:40,247
Charlie...

1003
02:01:44,116 --> 02:01:45,650
You're all right now.

1004
02:01:48,521 --> 02:01:52,532
You are Paimon,

1005
02:01:53,576 --> 02:01:56,478
one of the eight kings
of Hell.

1006
02:01:59,241 --> 02:02:02,076
We have looked
to the Northwest

1007
02:02:02,078 --> 02:02:03,987
and called you in.

1008
02:02:04,885 --> 02:02:07,942
We've corrected
your first female body

1009
02:02:08,311 --> 02:02:12,843
and give you now
this healthy male host.

1010
02:02:13,546 --> 02:02:19,143
We reject the Trinity and pray
devoutly to you, great Paimon.

1011
02:02:19,565 --> 02:02:23,823
Give us your knowledge
of all secret things.

1012
02:02:24,198 --> 02:02:28,846
Bring us honor, wealth,
and good familiars.

1013
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:32,425
Bind all men to our will,

1014
02:02:32,510 --> 02:02:38,506
as we have bound ourselves
for now and ever to yours.

1015
02:02:45,654 --> 02:02:47,388
Hail, Paimon!

1016
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:50,601
Hail, Paimon!

1017
02:02:51,693 --> 02:02:54,196
Hail, Paimon!

1018
02:02:55,324 --> 02:02:57,523
Hail!
