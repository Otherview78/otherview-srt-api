1
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,412
This is your lunch, okay?

2
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,581
Now, I put $1 in there
so you can buy some milk.

3
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,500
You can ask one of the big kids
where to do that.

4
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,169
Do you remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.

5
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,130
Put it in your pocket,
I don't want you to lose it.

6
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,758
Okay? You ready?

7
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,802
I think so.

8
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,764
It's Cady's big day.

9
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,726
<i>I guess it's natural for parents to cry
on their kid's first day of school,</i>

10
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,563
<i>but, you know, this usually happens
when the kid is five.</i>

11
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:06,149
<i>I'm 16 and until today,
I was home-schooled.</i>

12
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,236
<i>I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."</i>

13
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,865
<i>X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P. Xylocarp.</i>

14
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,868
<i>Or that we're weirdly religious
or something.</i>

15
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:21,498
And on the third day, God created
the Remington bolt-action rifle

16
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,042
so that man could fight the dinosaurs

17
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,919
and the homosexuals.

18
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,546
- Amen.
- Amen.

19
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,172
<i>But my family's totally normal.</i>

20
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,092
<i>Except for the fact that both
my parents are research zoologists</i>

21
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,428
<i>and we've spent
the last 12 years in Africa.</i>

22
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,762
<i>I had a great life.</i>

23
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,932
<i>But then my mom got offered tenure
at Northwestern University,</i>

24
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:42,561
<i>so it was goodbye Africa
and hello high school.</i>

25
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,233
I'm okay. Sorry. I'll be careful.

26
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,011
Hi.

27
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,138
I don't know if anyone
told you about me.

28
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,641
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.

29
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,644
Talk to me again and I'll kick your ass.

30
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,358
You don't wanna sit there.

31
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,569
Kristen Hadley's boyfriend
is gonna sit there.

32
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,488
Hey, baby.

33
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,246
He farts a lot.

34
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,799
Hey, everybody.

35
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,510
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

36
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,430
It's not you. I'm bad luck.

37
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,895
Ms. Norbury?

38
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,147
My T-shirt's stuck to my sweater,
isn't it?

39
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,191
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.

40
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,693
Is everything all right in here?

41
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:17,114
- Yeah.
- So, how was your summer?

42
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,865
I got divorced.

43
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,244
My carpal tunnel came back.

44
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,621
- I win.
- Yes, you do.

45
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,710
Well, I just wanted to let everyone know
that we have a new student joining us.

46
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,337
She just moved here
all the way from Africa.

47
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,005
Welcome.

48
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,134
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.

49
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,595
Her name is Cady. Cady Heron.

50
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,347
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.

51
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,058
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.

52
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,935
I have a nephew named Anfernee,

53
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,479
and I know how mad he gets
when I call him Anthony.

54
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,398
Almost as mad as I get
when I think about the fact

55
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,817
that my sister named him Anfernee.

56
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,694
Well, welcome, Cady.

57
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,864
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.

58
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:03,660
And if you need anything
or if you wanna talk to somebody...

59
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,078
Thanks.

60
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,915
Maybe some other time,
when my shirt isn't see-through.

61
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,333
Okay.

62
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,670
Okay. Good day, everybody.

63
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,591
<i>The first day of school was a blur,</i>

64
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,968
<i>a stressful, surreal blur.</i>

65
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,929
<i>I got in trouble for
the most random things.</i>

66
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:26,433
- Where are you going?
- I have to go to the bathroom.

67
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,226
You need the lavatory pass.

68
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,937
Okay. Can I have the lavatory pass?

69
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,939
Nice try. Have a seat.

70
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,776
<i>I had never lived in a world
where adults didn't trust me,</i>

71
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,068
<i>where they were always yelling at me.</i>

72
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,154
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!

73
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,322
No food in class!

74
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,908
Stay in your assigned seat!

75
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,335
I told you, I saw the whole thing.

76
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,003
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?

77
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,799
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.

78
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,384
<i>I had a lot of friends in Africa.</i>

79
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,722
What?

80
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,099
<i>But so far, none in Evanston.</i>

81
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,283
Hey. How was your first day?

82
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,590
Is that your natural hair color?

83
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,051
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.

84
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,678
Thank you.

85
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,388
See, this is the color I want.

86
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,891
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.

87
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,227
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.

88
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,896
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!

89
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,315
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.

90
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,278
Do you guys know where Room G14 is?

91
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,198
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday,
Room G14."

92
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,826
I think that's in the back building.

93
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,037
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.

94
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,622
Thanks.

95
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,626
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!

96
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,921
Health. Spanish.

97
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,883
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?

98
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,594
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?

99
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,722
Because it's the same in every country.

100
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,433
That's beautiful. This girl is deep.

101
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,436
Where's the back building?

102
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,521
It burned down in 1987.

103
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,399
Won't we get in some sort of
trouble for this?

104
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,276
Why would we get you into trouble?

105
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,111
We're your friends.

106
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:47,198
<i>I know it's wrong to skip class,
but Janis said we were friends,</i>

107
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,118
<i>and I was in no position
to pass up friends.</i>

108
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,538
<i>I guess I'll never know what I missed
on that first day of health class.</i>

109
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:57,167
Don't have sex,
because you will get pregnant and die.

110
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,336
Don't have sex
in the missionary position.

111
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,796
Don't have sex standing up.

112
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,132
Just don't do it, promise?

113
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,801
Okay, everybody take some rubbers.

114
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,803
Why didn't they just keep
home-schooling you?

115
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,931
They wanted me to get socialized.

116
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,767
You'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.

117
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,187
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.

118
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,147
- What?
- Own it.

119
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,815
How do you spell your name again,
Cady?

120
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,068
It's Cady. C-A-D-Y.

121
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,528
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.

122
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,155
In the name of all that is holy,

123
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,574
will you look
at Karen Smith's gym clothes?

124
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,577
Of course all The Plastics
are in the same gym class.

125
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,288
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.

126
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,792
If North Shore was <i>Us Weekly,</i>
they would always be on the cover.

127
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,460
That one there, that's Karen Smith.

128
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,922
She is one of the dumbest girls
you will ever meet.

129
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,883
Damian sat next to her
in English last year.

130
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,594
She asked me how to spell "orange."

131
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,597
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.

132
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,433
She's totally rich because her dad
invented Toaster Strudel.

133
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,310
Gretchen Wieners knows
everybody's business.

134
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,145
She knows everything about everyone.

135
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,607
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.

136
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,486
And evil takes a human form
in Regina George.

137
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,532
Don't be fooled, because she may seem
like your typical selfish, back-stabbing,

138
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,117
slut-faced ho-bag.

139
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,829
But in reality,
she is so much more than that.

140
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,288
She's the queen bee.

141
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,041
The star. Those other two
are just her little workers.

142
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,835
Regina George.

143
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,671
How do I even begin
to explain Regina George?

144
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,631
Regina George is flawless.

145
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,009
She has two Fendi purses
and a silver Lexus.

146
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,219
I hear her hair's insured for $10,000.

147
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,389
I hear she does car commercials
in Japan.

148
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,266
Her favorite movie is <i>Varsity Blues.</i>

149
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,435
One time,
she met John Stamos on a plane.

150
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,894
And he told her she was pretty.

151
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,355
One time, she punched me in the face.

152
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,898
It was awesome.

153
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,318
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.

154
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,446
- Who cares?
- I care.

155
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,573
Every year, the seniors throw
this dance for the underclassmen

156
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,199
called The Spring Fling.

157
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,535
And whomsoever is elected
Spring Fling King and Queen

158
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,579
automatically becomes head of
the Student Activities Committee.

159
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,540
And since I am an active member of
the Student Activities Committee,

160
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,834
I would say, yeah, I care.

161
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,171
Wow, Damian,
you've truly out-gayed yourself.

162
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,051
Here. This map is gonna be
your guide to North Shore.

163
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,803
Now, where you sit
in the cafeteria is crucial

164
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,221
because you got everybody there.

165
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,974
You got your freshmen, ROTC guys,

166
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,477
preps, J.V. jocks,

167
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,896
Asian nerds,

168
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,899
<i>cool Asians,</i>

169
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,901
<i>varsity jocks,</i>

170
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,320
<i>unfriendly black hotties,</i>

171
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,739
<i>girls who eat their feelings,</i>

172
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,866
<i>girls who don't eat anything,</i>

173
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,826
<i>desperate wannabes,</i>

174
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,244
<i>burnouts,</i>

175
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,622
<i>sexually active band geeks,</i>

176
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,459
<i>the greatest people you will ever meet
and the worst.</i>

177
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,586
<i>Beware of The Plastics.</i>

178
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,883
Hey. We're doing a lunchtime survey
of new students.

179
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,468
Can you answer a few questions?

180
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,929
- Okay.
- Is your muffin buttered?

181
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,431
What?

182
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:02,769
Would you like us to assign someone
to butter your muffin?

183
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,146
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?

184
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,107
Jason, why are you such a skeez?

185
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,275
I'm just being friendly.

186
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,944
You were supposed
to call me last night.

187
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,322
Jason. You do not come to a party
at my house with Gretchen

188
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,951
and then scam on some poor, innocent
girl right in front of us three days later.

189
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,661
She's not interested.

190
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,788
Do you wanna have sex with him?

191
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,916
- No, thank you.
- Good. So it's settled.

192
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,127
So you can go shave your back now.

193
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,795
Bye, Jason.

194
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,171
Bitch.

195
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,091
Wait. Sit down.

196
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,053
Seriously, sit down.

197
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,808
Why don't I know you?

198
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,477
I'm new. I just moved here from Africa.

199
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,188
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.

200
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,773
Wait. What?

201
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,316
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.

202
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,402
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.

203
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,156
So you've actually never been
to a real school before?

204
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,824
Shut up.

205
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,076
Shut up.

206
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,163
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.

207
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,707
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.

208
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,417
But you're, like, really pretty.

209
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,836
- Thank you.
- So you agree.

210
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,213
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.

211
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,175
- I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.

212
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,136
- Where did you get it?
- My mom made it for me.

213
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,847
- It's adorable.
- It's so fetch.

214
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,684
- What is "fetch"?
- It's, like, slang from England.

215
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,812
So if you're from Africa,
why are you white?

216
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,900
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask
people why they're white.

217
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,527
Could you give us some privacy for,
like, one second?

218
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,196
Yeah, sure.

219
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,449
What are you doing?

220
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,913
Okay, you should just know
that we don't do this a lot,

221
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,040
so this is, like, a really huge deal.

222
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,292
We wanna invite you
to have lunch with us

223
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,169
every day for the rest of the week.

224
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,046
- It's okay...
- Coolness.

225
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,923
So we'll see you tomorrow.

226
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,966
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.

227
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,844
Oh, my God!
Okay, you have to do it, okay?

228
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,472
And then you have to tell me
all the horrible things that Regina says.

229
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,641
Regina seems sweet.

230
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,226
Regina George is not sweet.

231
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,312
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!

232
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,647
She's fabulous, but she's evil.

233
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,815
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.

234
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,609
I love your work!

235
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,195
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?

236
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,322
Regina. You seem to really hate her.

237
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,990
Yes. What's your question?

238
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,493
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor

239
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,579
- that Janis was...
- Damian! Shall we not?

240
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,456
Now, look,
this isn't about hating her, okay?

241
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,500
I just think that it would be, like,
a fun little experiment

242
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,294
if you were to hang out with them
and then tell us everything that they say.

243
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,546
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.

244
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,423
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?

245
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,884
Would you just do it? Please?

246
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,221
Okay, fine. Do you have anything pink?

247
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,681
- Yes.
- No.

248
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,434
<i>By eighth period,
I was so happy to get to math class.</i>

249
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,979
<i>I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.</i>

250
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,398
<i>Nothing in math class
could mess me up.</i>

251
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,442
Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?

252
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,821
<i>I've only had one other crush in my life.</i>

253
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,572
<i>His name was Nfume, and we were five.</i>

254
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,866
I like you.

255
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,618
Go away!

256
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,787
<i>It didn't work out.</i>

257
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,790
<i>But this one hit me like a big,
yellow school bus.</i>

258
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,126
- Cady, what do you say?
- <i>He was...</i>

259
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,877
...so cute.

260
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:20,049
I mean, A-sub-N equals
N plus one over four.

261
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,343
That's right.

262
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,470
That's good. Very good.

263
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,390
All right, let's talk about your homework.

264
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,685
Hey. How was your second day?

265
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,104
- Fine.
- Were people nice?

266
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,940
- No.
- Did you make any friends?

267
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,233
Yeah.

268
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,572
<i>Having lunch with The Plastics was like
leaving the actual world</i>

269
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,198
<i>and entering Girl World.</i>

270
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,451
<i>And Girl World had a lot of rules.</i>

271
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,536
You can't wear a tank top two days
in a row,

272
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,789
and you can only wear your hair
in a ponytail once a week.

273
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,167
So I guess you picked today.

274
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,670
And we only wear jeans
or track pants on Fridays.

275
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,174
Now, if you break any of these rules,
you can't sit with us at lunch.

276
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,551
Well, I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.

277
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,595
Okay, like, if I was wearing jeans today,

278
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,931
I would be sitting over there
with the art freaks.

279
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,643
And we always vote before we ask
someone to eat lunch with us,

280
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,646
because you have to be considerate of
the rest of the group.

281
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,857
I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt
without asking your friends first

282
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,360
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?

283
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,528
Right. And it's the same with guys.

284
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:26,616
Like, you may think you like someone,
but you could be wrong.

285
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,453
120 calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?

286
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,705
Forty-eight into 120?

287
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,166
I'm only eating foods with less than
30% calories from fat.

288
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,126
It's 40%.

289
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,630
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100,

290
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,925
and then you cross-multiply
and get the value of X.

291
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,761
Whatever. I'm getting cheese fries.

292
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,100
So have you seen any guys
that you think are cute yet?

293
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,060
Well, there's this guy
in my calculus class...

294
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,062
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?

295
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,564
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!

296
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,942
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.

297
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,902
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.

298
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,237
They went out for a year.

299
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,532
Yeah, and then she was devastated
when he broke up with her last summer.

300
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,367
I thought she dumped him
for Shane Oman.

301
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,662
Okay, irregardless. Ex-boyfriends
are just off-limits to friends.

302
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,040
I mean, that's just, like,
the rules of feminism.

303
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,460
Don't worry.
I'll never tell Regina what you said.

304
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,422
It'll be our little secret.

305
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,260
We define the sum of the infinite
geometric series...

306
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,345
<i>Even though
I wasn't allowed to like Aaron,</i>

307
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,056
<i>I was still allowed to look at him.</i>

308
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,226
<i>And think about him.</i>

309
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,563
<i>And talk to him.</i>

310
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,941
- Hey...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?

311
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,526
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor,

312
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,445
captain of the North Shore Mathletes.

313
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,946
We participate in math challenges

314
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,656
against other high schools
around the state,

315
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,200
and we can get twice as much funding
if we've got a girl.

316
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,910
So you should think about joining.

317
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,913
- You'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.

318
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,708
Great, great. Let me give you my card.

319
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,129
Okay. So think it over,

320
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,257
because we'd like to get jackets.

321
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,217
Okay.

322
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,564
Hey.

323
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,694
Get in, loser. We're going shopping.

324
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,030
<i>Regina's like the Barbie doll
I never had.</i>

325
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,782
<i>I'd never seen anybody so glamorous.</i>

326
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,079
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.

327
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,664
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.

328
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:39,999
- No! No, no.
- No, no.

329
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,835
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.

330
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,172
Damn, you are so lucky
you have us to guide you.

331
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,852
<i>Being at Old Orchard Mall kind of
reminded me of being home in Africa,</i>

332
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:03,314
<i>by the watering hole
when the animals are in heat.</i>

333
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,032
Oh, my God, there's Jason!

334
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,368
Where? There he is.

335
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,872
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.

336
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,708
Wait. Jason's not going out with Taylor.

337
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,294
No. He cannot blow you off like that.

338
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,422
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.

339
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,260
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

340
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,636
No.

341
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,016
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.

342
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,102
Not when you connect from Information.

343
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,311
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello.

344
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,980
May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?

345
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,606
She's not home yet. Who's calling?

346
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,900
This is Susan from
Planned Parenthood.

347
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,318
I have her test results.

348
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,737
If you can have her give me a call
as soon as she can.

349
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,864
It's urgent. Thank you.

350
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,243
She's not going out with anyone.

351
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,620
Okay, that was so fetch.

352
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,629
Mom.

353
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,644
Wow, your house is really nice.

354
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,438
I know, right?

355
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,565
Make sure you check out
her mom's boob job.

356
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,609
They're hard as rocks.

357
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,613
I'm home! Hey, Kylie.

358
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,364
Hey.

359
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,494
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?

360
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,039
Hey, Mrs. George. This is Cady.

361
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,749
Hello, sweetheart.

362
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,710
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.

363
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,925
Just want you to know, if you need
anything, don't be shy, okay?

364
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,012
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.

365
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,806
I'm a cool mom. Right, Regina?

366
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,558
- Please stop talking.
- Okay.

367
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,686
I'm gonna make you girls
a "hump day" treat.

368
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,902
This is your room?

369
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,238
It was my parents' room,
but I made them trade me.

370
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,075
Hey, put on 98.8.

371
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,500
Cady, do you even know who sings this?

372
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,669
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.

373
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:30,920
She's like a Martian.

374
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,632
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please. I hate my calves.

375
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,551
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.

376
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,012
<i>I used to think there was just fat
and skinny.</i>

377
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,807
<i>Apparently, there's a lot of things
that can be wrong on your body.</i>

378
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,685
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.

379
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,603
My nail beds suck.

380
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,442
I have really bad breath in the morning.

381
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:58,030
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4:00 to 6:00!

382
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,283
Thanks.

383
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,412
Is there alcohol in this?

384
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,915
Oh, God, honey, no.
What kind of mother do you think I am?

385
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,375
Why? Do you want a little bit?

386
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,669
'Cause if you're gonna drink,
I'd rather you do it in the house.

387
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,379
- No, thank you.
- Okay.

388
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,216
So, you guys, what is the 411 ?

389
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,803
What has everybody been up to?

390
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,931
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.

391
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,392
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?

392
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,810
Mom.

393
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,438
- Could you go fix your hair?
- Okay.

394
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,983
You girls keep me young.
I love you so much.

395
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,988
Oh, my God, I remember this.

396
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,366
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.

397
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,868
It's our Burn Book.

398
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,911
See, we cut out girls' pictures
from the yearbook,

399
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,038
and then we wrote comments.

400
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,375
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.

401
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,962
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.

402
00:20:56,464 --> 00:21:00,092
"Amber D'Alessio."
She made out with a hot dog.

403
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,178
"Janis lan, dyke."

404
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,639
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.

405
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,517
Yeah. He's almost too gay to function.

406
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,270
That's funny. Put that in there.

407
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,523
<i>Oh, no. Maybe that was
only okay when Janis said it.</i>

408
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,526
And they have this Burn Book
where they write mean things

409
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,946
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?

410
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,741
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.

411
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:27,328
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No. Cady, you gotta steal that book.

412
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,246
- No way!
- Oh, come on. We could publish it,

413
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,916
and then everybody would see
what an ax-wound she really is.

414
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,794
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.

415
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:38,047
Cady, there are two kinds of evil people.

416
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,673
People who do evil stuff,

417
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:43,594
and people who see evil stuff
being done and don't try to stop it.

418
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:47,723
Does that mean I'm morally obligated
to burn that lady's outfit?

419
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,975
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.

420
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,644
I love seeing teachers outside of school.

421
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,271
It's like seeing a dog walk
on its hind legs.

422
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,107
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.

423
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,985
Yeah, moderately-priced soaps
are my calling.

424
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,447
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.

425
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,994
Joking.
Sometimes older people make jokes.

426
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,747
My Nana takes her wig off
when she's drunk.

427
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,041
Your Nana and I have that in common.

428
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,961
No, actually, I'm just here because
I bar tend a couple nights a week

429
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,213
down at P.J. Calamity's.

430
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,549
Cady, I hope you do join Mathletes,
you know,

431
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,008
because we start in a couple weeks

432
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,718
and I would love
to have a girl on the team,

433
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,680
just, you know,
so the team could meet a girl.

434
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,849
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.

435
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,309
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.

436
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,936
Thanks, Damian.

437
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:38,566
Well, this has been
sufficiently awkward,

438
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,693
and I'll see you guys tomorrow.

439
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,528
- Bye.
- Bye.

440
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,947
Oh, man, that is bleak.

441
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,200
So when are you gonna
see Regina again?

442
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,286
I can't spy on her anymore. It's weird.

443
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,707
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.

444
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,211
- Hello?
- I know your secret.

445
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,421
<i>Oh, God, busted.</i>

446
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,132
<i>Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.</i>

447
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,800
Secret? What are you saying about?

448
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,261
Gretchen told me that
you like Aaron Samuels.

449
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,680
I mean, I don't care.
Do whatever you want,

450
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,224
but let me just tell you something
about Aaron.

451
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:16,020
All he cares about is school
and his mom and his friends.

452
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,939
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...

453
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:22,568
Whatever. I mean, I could talk to him
for you if you want.

454
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,028
Really? You would do that?

455
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,654
I mean, nothing embarrassing,
though, right?

456
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,657
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.

457
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,202
But wait. Aren't you so mad
at Gretchen for telling me?

458
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,455
- No.
- Because if you are,

459
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,875
you can tell me.
It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.

460
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,045
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy,
but I'm not mad.

461
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,588
I mean,
I guess she just likes the attention.

462
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,256
See, Gretch?
I told you she's not mad at you.

463
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,966
I can't believe you think I like attention!

464
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,510
Okay, love you. See you tomorrow.

465
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,097
<i>I had survived
my first three-way calling attack.</i>

466
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:55,351
<i>And with Regina's blessing, I started
talking to Aaron more and more.</i>

467
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,604
<i>On October third,
he asked me what day it was.</i>

468
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,439
It's October third.

469
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,358
<i>Two weeks later, we spoke again.</i>

470
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,152
- It's raining.
- Yeah.

471
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:10,074
<i>But I wanted things to move faster,
so I followed my instincts.</i>

472
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,661
Hey, I'm totally lost. Can you help me?

473
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:14,828
- <i>But I wasn't lost.</i>
- Yeah.

474
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,872
<i>I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury
was talking about.</i>

475
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:20,250
It's a factorial,
so you multiply each one by N.

476
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,377
<i>Wrong.</i>

477
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,379
Is that the summation?

478
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:25,965
Yeah, they're the same thing.

479
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,841
<i>Wrong. He was so wrong.</i>

480
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,386
Thanks. I... I get it now.

481
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,221
Lights, please.

482
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,723
Okay. See you guys tomorrow.

483
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,979
We're having a Halloween party
at my friend Chris' tonight.

484
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,231
Do you wanna come?

485
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,983
Yeah, sure.

486
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,443
Great. Here's where it is.

487
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,071
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.

488
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,698
Okay.

489
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:55,786
That flyer admits one person only,
so don't bring some other guy with you.

490
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,955
Grool.

491
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,375
I meant to say "cool"
and then I started to say "great."

492
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,294
Right. Well, grool.

493
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,089
See you tonight.

494
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,678
Hey, Africa.
You staying for the Mathletes meeting?

495
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,763
Yeah, I'll be right back.

496
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,224
<i>Okay, I lied,</i>

497
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,436
<i>but I had to go home
and work on my costume.</i>

498
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,731
<i>In the regular world, Halloween
is when children dress up in costumes</i>

499
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,357
<i>and beg for candy.</i>

500
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,985
<i>In Girl World,
Halloween is the one night a year</i>

501
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,737
<i>when a girl can dress like a total slut</i>

502
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,864
<i>and no other girls
can say anything about it.</i>

503
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:35,576
<i>The hard-core girls just wear lingerie
and some form of animal ears.</i>

504
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,203
Doesn't she look great, honey?

505
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,416
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.

506
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,920
<i>Unfortunately, no one told me
about the slut rule,</i>

507
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,089
<i>so I showed up like this.</i>

508
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:56,972
Hey.

509
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,351
Yes! Yes!

510
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,233
Hey.

511
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,903
Why are you dressed so scary?

512
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,529
It's Halloween.

513
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,573
Have you seen Jason?

514
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,950
You know who's looking fine tonight?

515
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,078
Seth Mosakowski.

516
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:23,165
- Okay, you did not just say that.
- What? He's a good kisser.

517
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,750
He's your cousin.

518
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,086
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.

519
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,088
- Right.
- So you have your cousins

520
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,923
and then you have your first cousins,

521
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,093
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.

522
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,677
That's not right, is it?

523
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,513
That is so not right.

524
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,765
- Hey!
- Hey.

525
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,266
You made it,

526
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,937
and you are a zombie bride.

527
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,439
An "ex-wife."

528
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,566
Love it.
Can I get you something to drink?

529
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,193
- Yeah.
- Be right back.

530
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,569
Thanks.

531
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,490
Karen, stop it.

532
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,784
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!

533
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,747
Hey.

534
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,833
Oh, no.

535
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,251
Didn't anybody tell you?

536
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,378
You were supposed to wear a costume.

537
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,131
Shut up. I need to talk to you.

538
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,050
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.

539
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,136
I invited her tonight.

540
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,472
Well, be careful,
because she has a huge crush on you.

541
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,766
Really? How do you know?

542
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,310
Because she told me.

543
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,938
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.

544
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,899
She's like a little girl.
She, like, writes all over her notebook,

545
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,609
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."

546
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,154
And she made this T-shirt that says,
"I heart Aaron"

547
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,947
and she wears it under all her clothes.

548
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,491
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?

549
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,743
I mean, you're gorgeous.

550
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,372
And, okay, look,
I'm not saying she's a stalker,

551
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,041
but she saved this Kleenex you used

552
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,670
and she said she's gonna do some kind
of African voodoo with it

553
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,714
to make you like her.

554
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,090
What?

555
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,429
<i>This was it.</i>

556
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,140
<i>Regina said she would talk to Aaron
for me, and now she was.</i>

557
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:07,603
I know she's kind of socially retarded
and weird, but she's my friend,

558
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,064
so just promise me
you won't make fun of her.

559
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,192
Of course I'm not gonna
make fun of her.

560
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,110
<i>How could Janis hate Regina?</i>

561
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,279
<i>She was such a good...</i>

562
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,698
<i>Slut!</i>

563
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,874
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.

564
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,668
That's crazy.
Why would I break up with you?

565
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,462
You're so hot.

566
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,055
That's a scary mask, bro.

567
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,890
<i>I had never felt this feeling before.</i>

568
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,725
<i>I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.</i>

569
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,061
<i>My stomach felt like it was going
to fall out my butt.</i>

570
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,356
<i>I had this lump in my throat
like after you dry-swallow a big pill.</i>

571
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,650
<i>I hated Regina. I hated her!</i>

572
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,918
She took him back.

573
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,962
Regina took Aaron back.

574
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:18,131
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?

575
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,050
Because she's a life-ruiner.

576
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,551
She ruins people's lives.

577
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,096
When we were 13,
she made people sign this petition

578
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,348
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian! Please!

579
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,433
Look, she's not gonna get away
with this again, okay?

580
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,852
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?

581
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,440
Regina George is an evil dictator.

582
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,734
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?

583
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,320
You cut off her resources.

584
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,573
Regina would be nothing without her
high-status man candy,

585
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,368
technically good physique

586
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,289
and ignorant band of loyal followers.

587
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,585
Now, Cady, if we want this to work,

588
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,297
you are gonna have to keep hanging out
with them like nothing is wrong.

589
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,299
Can you do it?

590
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:01,466
I can do it.

591
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,885
Okay, let's rock this bitch.

592
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,391
<i>Pretending like nothing was wrong
turned out to be surprisingly easy.</i>

593
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,436
Regina wanted me to tell you that she
was trying to hook you up with Aaron,

594
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,022
but he was just interested
in getting her back,

595
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,440
and that's not Regina's fault.

596
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,984
- No, I know.
- Okay, so you're not mad at Regina?

597
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,861
- God, no.
- Okay, good.

598
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:24,031
Because Regina wanted me
to give you this.

599
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,536
It's called the South Beach Fat Flush,

600
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,122
and all you drink is cranberry juice
for 72 hours.

601
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,332
This isn't even cranberry juice.

602
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,834
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.

603
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,587
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.

604
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,842
Why do you wear your hair like that?
Your hair looks so sexy pushed back.

605
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,928
Cady, will you please tell him
his hair looks sexy pushed back.

606
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,556
<i>Regina was dangling Aaron
in front of me on purpose.</i>

607
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:53,101
<i>I knew how this would be settled
in the animal world.</i>

608
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,445
<i>But this was Girl World.</i>

609
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,114
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.

610
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:10,285
<i>And in Girl World,
all the fighting had to be sneaky.</i>

611
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,664
All this cranberry juice
is making me break out.

612
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,377
Wait. I have this really good
skin stuff I'll bring you.

613
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,586
Okay.

614
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:23,006
<i>We kept our eyes open
for opportunities for sabotage.</i>

615
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,680
Regina.

616
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:32,724
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

617
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,939
- Hey.
- Hey.

618
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,904
Your face smells like peppermint.

619
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,523
This is ass, you guys.

620
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,444
It's been a month, and all we've done
is make Regina's face smell like a foot.

621
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,862
I've been really busy with choir.

622
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,613
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.

623
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,615
We crack Gretchen,
and then we crack the lock

624
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,492
on Regina's whole dirty history.

625
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,286
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.

626
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,455
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.

627
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:39,124
I have to go to Regina's
to practice for the talent show.

628
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,876
We're doing a dance to this song...

629
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,294
<i>-Jingle Bell Rock.
- Jingle Bell Rock.</i>

630
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,462
You guys know that song?

631
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,339
Everybody in the English-speaking world
knows that song.

632
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,049
They do it every year.

633
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,218
Well, I have to learn it.

634
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,470
Go.

635
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,307
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis lan?

636
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,933
I don't know. I mean, she's so weird.

637
00:32:57,017 --> 00:33:00,604
She just, you know, came up to me
and started talking to me about crack.

638
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,481
She's so pathetic.

639
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,608
Let me tell you something
about Janis lan.

640
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,651
We were best friends in middle school.

641
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,737
I know, right? It's so embarrassing.

642
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,906
I don't even... Whatever.

643
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,950
So then in eighth grade, I started
going out with my first boyfriend, Kyle,

644
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,870
who was totally gorgeous,
but then he moved to Indiana.

645
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,331
And Janis was, like,
weirdly jealous of him.

646
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,833
Like, if I would blow her off
to hang out with Kyle,

647
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,960
she'd be like,
"Why didn't you call me back?"

648
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:27,130
And I'd be like,
"Why are you so obsessed with me?"

649
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:30,133
So then, for my birthday party,
which was an all-girls pool party,

650
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:34,346
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you,
because I think you're a lesbian."

651
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,681
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian
at my party.

652
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,142
There are gonna be girls there
in their bathing suits.

653
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,936
I mean, right? She was a lesbian.

654
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,647
So then her mom called my mom
and started yelling at her.

655
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,190
It was so retarded.

656
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,526
And then she dropped out of school
because no one would talk to her.

657
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,361
When she came back in the fall
for high school,

658
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,072
all of her hair was cut off
and she was totally weird,

659
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,533
and now I guess she's on crack.

660
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,537
Oh, my God! I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?

661
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,206
It was my mom's in the '80s.

662
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,583
Vintage. So adorable.

663
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:04,960
Thanks.

664
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,130
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt
I've ever seen.

665
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,218
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?

666
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,430
So are you gonna send
any candy canes?

667
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,350
No. I don't send them. I just get them.

668
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,894
So you better send me one, byotch.

669
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,312
Love you.

670
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,982
<i>I was definitely sending her one.</i>

671
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,151
<i>I was gonna use three candy canes
to crack Gretchen Wieners.</i>

672
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,486
Three, please.

673
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,240
"Why, man, he doth bestride
the narrow world like a colossus"

674
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,242
might translate into,

675
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,953
"Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"

676
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,917
- Candy-cane grams!
- Okay, hurry up.

677
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,336
Taylor Zimmerman? Two for you.

678
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,422
Glenn Cocco?

679
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,842
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.

680
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,428
And Cady Heron.

681
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,929
Do we have a Cady Heron here?

682
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,599
- It's Cady.
- Cady, here you go.

683
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,893
One for you.
And none for Gretchen Wieners. Bye.

684
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,939
Who's that from?

685
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,609
"Thanks for being such a great friend.
Love, Regina."

686
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,152
That's so sweet.

687
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,988
Okay, back to Caesar.

688
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,532
<i>Once Gretchen thought Regina
was mad at her,</i>

689
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,618
<i>the secrets started pouring out.</i>

690
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,620
<i>All I had to do was wait
for one we could use.</i>

691
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,204
<i>Thank you.</i>

692
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,126
<i>Welcome to the North Shore
High School winter talent show.</i>

693
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,629
<i>Let me hear you make some noise.</i>

694
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,802
<i>All right, settle down.</i>

695
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:42,057
<i>Our first act calls himself
a star on the rise.</i>

696
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,434
<i>Let's hear it for Damian.</i>

697
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,566
<i>Don't look at me.</i>

698
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:56,988
<i>Every day is so wonderful...</i>

699
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:01,493
I mean, why would Regina send
you guys candy canes and not me?

700
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,244
Maybe she forgot about you.

701
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,121
Yeah, Regina has been acting
kind of weird lately.

702
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,165
I mean, is something bothering her?

703
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,627
Well, I mean, her parents totally
don't sleep in the same bed anymore,

704
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,837
if that's what you mean.

705
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,006
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.

706
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:20,011
<i>I am beautiful in every single way</i>

707
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:24,849
<i>Yes, words can't bring me down</i>

708
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:28,978
<i>Don't you bring me down today...</i>

709
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:33,400
I mean, no offense, but why would
she send you a candy cane?

710
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,985
She doesn't even like you that much.

711
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,278
Maybe she feels weird around me

712
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:41,074
because I'm the only person
that knows about her nose job.

713
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:44,369
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.

714
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,371
<i>Yo, yo, yo.</i>

715
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:50,458
<i>All you sucker MCs
Ain't got nothing on me</i>

716
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,669
<i>From my grades to my lines
You can't touch Kevin G</i>

717
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,796
<i>I'm a Mathlete
So nerd is inferred</i>

718
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,840
<i>But forget what you heard
I'm like James Bond the Third</i>

719
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,883
<i>Shaken not stirred
I'm Kevin Gnapoor</i>

720
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,052
<i>The G is silent
When I sneak in your door</i>

721
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,138
<i>And make love to your woman
On the bathroom floor</i>

722
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,515
<i>I don't play it like Shaggy
You'll know it was me</i>

723
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,727
<i>Because the next time you see her
She'll be like, "Kevin G!"</i>

724
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,895
<i>Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.</i>

725
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,148
<i>Happy holidays, everybody.</i>

726
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,196
<i>K. G. and the Power of Three.</i>

727
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,615
<i>That was something.</i>

728
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,952
Does it bother you that they still use
your original choreography?

729
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,412
Shut up.

730
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,830
Damn.

731
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,124
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there

732
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,001
shaking that thing.

733
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,422
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.

734
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,882
But I'm always on your left.

735
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,467
Well, that was when
there were three of us,

736
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,427
and now the tallest go in the middle.

737
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,804
But the whole dance will be backwards.

738
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,473
I'm always on your left.

739
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:50,185
And right now you're getting
on my last nerve. Switch.

740
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:54,230
<i>And, finally,
please welcome to the stage</i>

741
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,275

That was the best it ever went!

00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,300
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.

756
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,386
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.

757
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,388
Cady's blushing. Oh, my God.

758
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,724
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.

759
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,809
That's why you wanted
to join the Mathletes.

760
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,895
Mathletes? You hate math.

761
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,688
Look how red she is.

762
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,065
You love him,
and he totally complimented you.

763
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,817
That is so fetch.

764
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,361
Gretchen, stop trying to make
"fetch" happen.

765
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:06,487
It's not going to happen.

766
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,996
"Why should Caesar get
to stomp around like a giant

767
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:19,167
"while the rest of us try not to get
smushed under his big feet?

"What's so great about Caesar?

00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,921
"Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.

<i>Gretchen Wieners had cracked.</i>

777
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:43,358
Okay, if you even knew
how mean she really is...

778
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,320
You know that I'm not allowed to wear
hoop earrings, right?

779
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,657
Yeah. Two years ago, she told me
that hoop earrings were her thing

780
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,700
and that I wasn't allowed
to wear them anymore.

781
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,786
And then for Hanukkah,
my parents got me this pair

782
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,664
of really expensive white-gold hoops.

783
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,292
And I had to pretend like
I didn't even like them,

784
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,211
and it was so sad.

785
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,837
And you know she cheats on Aaron?

786
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,131
Yes. Every Thursday he thinks
she's doing SAT prep,

787
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:10,176
but really she's hooking up with
Shane Oman in the projection room

788
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:13,388
above the auditorium,
and I never told anybody that,

789
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:17,266
because I'm such a good friend.

790
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:24,607
<i>Jackpot. Gretchen's secret had put
the plan back in motion.</i>

791
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,651
<i>After Christmas break,
we tried every Thursday</i>

792
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,529
<i>to help Aaron catch Regina in the act.</i>

793
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:03,479
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

794
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:04,939
My purse!

795
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,692
Looks like he's headed for
the projection room

796
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,652
above the auditorium!

797
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,621
Coach Carr?

798
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,208
Trang Pak?

799
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,502
Guys, why did we think
we could do this? We're amateurs.

800
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,380
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.

801
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:31,299
What are Kälteen bars?

802
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,342
They're these weird
Swedish nutrition bars.

803
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:37,972
My mom used to give them to the kids
in Africa to help them gain weight.

804
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,436
They're these weird nutrition bars
my mom uses to lose weight.

805
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,104
Give me it.

806
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,902
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.

807
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,279
Yeah, you know,
there's some weird ingredient in them

808
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,114
that's not legal in the U.S. yet.

809
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,158
- Ephedrine?
- No.

810
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,494
- Phentermine.
- No.

811
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,165
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.

812
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,251
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.

813
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:09,754
Oh, my God,
what are you talking about?

814
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,048
- You're so skinny.
- Shut up.

815
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:13,841
Yes.

816
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,510
<i>The weird thing about
hanging out with Regina</i>

817
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,261
<i>was that I could hate her,
and at the same time,</i>

818
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,846
<i>I still wanted her to like me.</i>

819
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,432
Okay, you have really good eyebrows.

820
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,559
- Thanks.
- Move.

821
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:24,727
<i>Same with Gretchen.</i>

822
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,229
<i>The meaner Regina was to her,</i>

823
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,648
<i>the more Gretchen
tried to win Regina back.</i>

824
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,525
<i>She knew it was better to be
in The Plastics,</i>

825
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,319
<i>hating life, than to not be in at all.</i>

826
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:36,906
<i>Because being with The Plastics
was like being famous.</i>

827
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,324
<i>People looked at you all the time,</i>

828
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,868
<i>and everybody just knew
stuff about you.</i>

829
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,037
That new girl moved here from Africa.

830
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,748
I saw Cady Heron wearing
Army pants and flip-flops,

831
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,126
so I bought Army pants and flip-flops.

832
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,378
That Cady girl is hot.

833
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,255
She might even be hotter
than Regina George.

834
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:55,133
I hear Regina George
is dating Aaron Samuels again.

835
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:58,427
The two were seen canoodling
at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.

836
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:01,055
<i>They've been inseparable ever since.</i>

837
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,900
<i>I was a woman possessed.</i>

838
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,903
<i>I spent about 80% of my time
talking about Regina,</i>

839
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,238
<i>and the other 20% of the time,</i>

840
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,990
<i>I was praying for someone else
to bring her up</i>

841
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,200
<i>so I could talk about her more.</i>

842
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,536
She's not even that good-looking
if you really look at her.

843
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,538
I don't know.
Now that she's getting fatter,

844
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,290
she's got pretty big jugs.

845
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,167
<i>I could hear people
getting bored with me,</i>

846
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,920
<i>but I couldn't stop.
It just kept coming up like word vomit.</i>

847
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,922
I have this theory
that if you cut all her hair off,

848
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,465
she'd look like a British man.

849
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:39,427
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.

850
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,429
Hey, I'm having an art show.

851
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,681
So you should take a night off
from your double life.

852
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,225
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.

853
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,187
What is that smell?

854
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,230
Regina gave me some perfume.

855
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,649
You smell like a baby prostitute.

856
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,026
Thanks.

857
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,488
<i>Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse
I could to talk to Aaron.</i>

858
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,700
I don't get this. Do you get any of this?

859
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,619
Nice job, Cady.

860
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,955
Kind of seems like you get it.

861
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:12,210
<i>If I was gonna keep this going,
I was gonna have to really commit.</i>

862
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,171
Not your best.

863
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,965
Damn, Africa, what happened?

864
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,801
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.

865
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:23,221
You know, I think I need a tutor.

866
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:26,390
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna
get together after school or something.

867
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,309
Do you think Regina would mind?

868
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,478
No. You guys are friends.

869
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,066
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.

870
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,526
So, what did you get for this one?

871
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,528
Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.

872
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:43,074
- <i>Wrong.</i>
- But then when I checked it, I got one.

873
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,283
<i>There you go.</i>

874
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:45,993
I got one, too.

875
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,247
Yeah, you have to check it
because sometimes the product

876
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:52,250
of two negative integers
is a positive number.

877
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:55,086
Yeah, like negative four
and negative six.

878
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,338
That's right. That's good.

879
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,174
Well, you're a good tutor.

880
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,353
Man, look, I... I can't do this.

881
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,856
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?

882
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,526
Look, I know she can be really mean
sometimes, but...

883
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,320
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?

884
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:22,863
Look, there's good
and bad to everybody.

885
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,199
Right? Regina's just...

886
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,701
She's just more up-front about it.

887
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,244
<i>Oh, no. It was coming up.</i>

888
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,162
<i>The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...</i>

889
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,498
She's cheating on you!

890
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,668
What?

891
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,841
Did he say why?

892
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:45,094
Somebody told him about Shane Oman.

893
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,220
Who?

894
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,306
He said some guy on the baseball team.

895
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,932
Baseball team?

896
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,145
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.

897
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,647
You wanna do something fun?

898
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,399
You wanna go to Taco Bell?

899
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,944
I can't go to Taco Bell.
I'm on an all-carb diet.

900
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,238
God, Karen, you are so stupid!

901
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,407
Regina, wait. Talk to me.

902
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,618
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.

903
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,079
You're not stupid, Karen.

904
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,998
No. I am, actually.

905
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,667
I'm failing almost everything.

906
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:20,004
Well, there must be something
you're good at.

907
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,590
I can put my whole fist in my mouth.

908
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,841
Wanna see?

909
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,010
No. That's okay.

910
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,803
Anything else?

911
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,181
I'm kind of psychic.

912
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,183
I have a fifth sense.

913
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,854
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.

914
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:40,066
My breasts can always tell
when it's gonna rain.

915
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,028
Really? That's amazing.

916
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,865
Well, they can tell when it's raining.

917
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,954
<i>I have to admit, I was mildly horrified</i>

918
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,499
<i>when Aaron didn't immediately ask me
to be his girlfriend.</i>

919
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,918
<i>I mean, I know he was sad,
but how much time did he need?</i>

920
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,294
<i>Regina had moved on.</i>

921
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:07,093
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks? A condom?

922
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:10,471
Let me know. Oh, God love you.

923
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,182
<i>But overall,
the plan was going pretty well.</i>

924
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,476
<i>Aaron had dumped Regina,
and she was unknowingly</i>

925
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,645
<i>eating 5,000 calories a day.</i>

926
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,480
<i>It was time to turn our attention to
the army of skanks.</i>

927
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:25,778
<i>And finally, the nominees for
Spring Fling Queen are as follows.</i>

928
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:27,780
Regina George.

929
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,575
<i>Gretchen Wieners.</i>

930
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,538
<i>Janis lan.</i>

931
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,416
What is happening to the world?

932
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,418
<i>And the final nominee...</i>

933
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,920
I couldn't help myself. It was so easy.

934
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,797
<i>...is Cady Heron.</i>

935
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,800
Damian, you put me in there, too?
That's not part of the plan.

936
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,427
I didn't put you in there.

937
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,012
You mean I'm really nominated?

938
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,644
<i>In January, Regina had put
a Spring Fling dress on hold</i>

939
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,271
<i>at a store called 1-3-5.</i>

940
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,314
<i>But being Plastic,
she needed our advice</i>

941
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:03,774
<i>before she could actually buy it.</i>

942
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,026
Can someone zip me up?

943
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,739
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.

944
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,033
Okay, it must be marked wrong.

945
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:16,078
Cady, all I've been eating
are these Kälteen bars. They suck.

946
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,414
No, no, this is just how they work.

947
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,040
This is all your water weight.

948
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:23,210
First you bloat,
and then you drop 10 pounds like that.

949
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:25,629
Well, the Kälteen bars
have burned up all your carbs,

950
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,798
and now your body's
just running on water.

951
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,342
But once the water's gone,
then you'll be all muscle.

952
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,219
It explains it all on the label.

953
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,971
You know Swedish?

954
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,849
Yeah, everyone in Africa
can read Swedish.

955
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,143
Ma'am, do you have this
in the next size up?

956
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:42,271
Sorry. We only carry sizes 1, 3 and 5.

957
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,148
You could try Sears.

958
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:56,911
Cady.

959
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:00,956
I need your parents to sign this
so they know that you're failing.

960
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,082
Failing?

961
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,834
You know what's weird
about your quizzes, Cady,

962
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:07,796
is that all the work is right
and just the answers are wrong.

963
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,590
- Really?
- Really.

964
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,301
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend

965
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,179
may seem like the most important thing
in the world right now,

966
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,182
but you don't have to dumb yourself
down to get guys to like you.

967
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,975
- <i>How would you know?</i>
- I know,

968
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,061
"How would I know," right?

969
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:25,439
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.

970
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,984
The only guy that ever calls my house
is Randy from Chase Visa.

971
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,361
And you know why?

972
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,197
Because I'm a pusher. I push people.

973
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,158
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.

974
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,661
I pushed myself into working three jobs.

975
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,246
And now I'm gonna push you,

976
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,206
because I know
you're smarter than this.

977
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,374
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.

978
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,210
And if there's anything I can do
for extra credit, please let me know.

979
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,711
I will.

980
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,881
I hate her! I mean,
she's totally failing me on purpose

981
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,716
because I didn't join
those stupid Mathletes!

982
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,968
She was so queer.

983
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,304
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."

984
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,223
What does that even mean?

985
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,225
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.

986
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,977
She said she works three jobs.

987
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,562
You know, I bet she sells
drugs on the side

988
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,188
to pay for her pathetic divorce.

989
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:08,399
You let it out, honey.

990
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,484
Put it in the book.

991
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,324
<i>I know it may look like
I'd become a bitch,</i>

992
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,952
<i>but that's only because
I was acting like a bitch.</i>

993
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,663
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?

994
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,915
I got busy. Sorry.

995
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:28,043
So you need a ride to my art show
this weekend?

996
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,421
No. I have to go to Madison
with my parents.

997
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,214
I'm so sorry.

998
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,966
Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?

999
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,261
Can't. I'm doing major
Plastic sabotage tonight.

1000
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,972
But we don't have anything
planned for tonight.

1001
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,516
I planned this one on my own.

1002
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,268
Love you. Bye.

1003
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,022
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her

1004
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,940
because she's running for
Spring Fling Queen.

1005
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:53,319
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.

1006
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:55,529
I think somebody nominated her
as a joke or something.

1007
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:58,907
And when nobody votes for her,
she's gonna have a total meltdown.

1008
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:01,410
And who's gonna have
to take care of her? Me.

1009
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,455
So you don't think anyone
will vote for her?

1010
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:06,957
Cady, she's not pretty.

1011
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,251
I mean, that sounds bad, but whatever.

1012
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:11,462
The Spring Fling Queen
is always pretty.

1013
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,380
And the crazy thing is,
is that it should be Karen,

1014
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,592
but people forget about her
because she's such a slut.

1015
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,553
Anyway, I gotta go. I'm going to bed.

1016
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,266
Well, she's not mad at you.

1017
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,560
- Hold on.
- Are you okay?

1018
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:36,362
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad

1019
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:39,490
about you,
you'd want me to tell you, right?

1020
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,866
- No.
- What if it was someone

1021
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,576
you thought was your friend?

1022
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,870
What are you... Hold on. Other line.

1023
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,997
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.

1024
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,666
- Hello?
- Let's go out.

1025
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:50,834
Okay, hold on.
I'm on the other line with Gretchen.

1026
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,420
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.

1027
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,631
- Hold on.
- Okay, hurry up.

1028
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,841
It's Regina.

1029
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,594
She wants to hang out with me tonight,
but she told me not to tell you.

1030
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,513
Do not hang out with her.

1031
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,349
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.

1032
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,601
You can tell me. Hold on.

1033
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,021
Oh, my God, she's so annoying.

1034
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,481
Who is?

1035
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,775
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.

1036
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,527
Right. Hold on.

1037
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:22,616
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know. Just get rid of her.

1038
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,036
Okay, what is it?

1039
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,623
Regina says everyone hates you
because you're such a slut.

1040
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,417
She said that?

1041
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,794
You didn't hear it from me.

1042
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:37,172
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever. She has a right to know.

1043
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,091
I can't go out.

1044
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,468
I'm sick.

1045
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,137
Boo. You whore.

1046
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:52,229
Regina, we have to talk to you.

1047
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,523
Is butter a carb?

1048
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,819
- Yes.
- Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.

1049
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,155
It's Monday.

1050
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,407
- So?
- So that's against the rules,

1051
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,409
and you can't sit with us.

1052
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,036
Whatever. Those rules aren't real.

1053
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,539
They were real that day I wore a vest.

1054
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:14,334
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!

1055
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,844
These sweatpants are all
that fits me right now.

1056
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,435
Fine.

1057
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,771
You can walk home, bitches.

1058
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,357
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!

1059
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,659
<i>Gretchen and Karen followed me
around all afternoon.</i>

1060
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:49,828
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?

1061
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:52,122
I have to go to Madison with my parents.

1062
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,624
What...

1063
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,126
We have tickets for this thing.

1064
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,795
- What?
- What?

1065
00:54:57,878 --> 00:55:00,005
<i>Was I the new queen bee?</i>

1066
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,425
I can try and get out of it.

1067
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,802
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1068
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,805
Because I told my friend Janis
I'd go to her art show.

1069
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,807
We've had these tickets for months.

1070
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,142
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.

1071
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:15,103
But she's my friend,
and I made her a promise.

1072
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:18,899
I think Cady's old enough
to spend one night on her own.

1073
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:24,613
<i>I had learned how to control
everyone around me.</i>

1074
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:28,784
Hey. I'm having a small get-together
at my house tomorrow night.

1075
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,787
- Is Regina going?
- No. Do you think I'm an idiot?

1076
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,499
No, it's just gonna be a few cool people,
and you better be one of them, byotch.

1077
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,584
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.

1078
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,711
I love that shirt on you.

1079
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,512
<i>Aaron Samuels was going to be
in my house at my party.</i>

1080
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,889
<i>Everything had to be perfect.</i>

1081
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,770
<i>And this time when Aaron saw me,</i>

1082
00:55:56,854 --> 00:56:00,023
<i>I wouldn't be caught
in some ridiculous costume.</i>

1083
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,483
Hey, guys.

1084
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,486
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!

1085
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,405
I know, right?

1086
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,448
Okay, so I got enough cheese
and crackers for eight people.

1087
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,367
Do you think that's enough?

1088
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,160
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1089
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:13,579
Okay.

1090
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,293
<i>It was not enough.</i>

1091
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:22,045
<i>Somehow, the word had gotten out
about my small get-together.</i>

1092
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,298
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.

1093
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,383
He's just using her to make you mad.

1094
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,052
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.

1095
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,515
Dude, put on
the Ramayana Monkey Chant.

1096
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,152
- Do I know you?
- Deek! What up, dog?

1097
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,411
She thinks she's gonna
have a party and not invite me?

1098
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,496
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.

1099
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,666
I like, invented her,
you know what I mean?

1100
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,467
Jason.

1101
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,511
I have to talk to you.

1102
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,430
Whatever.

1103
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,767
- I love you.
- I know, I know.

1104
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,897
Hey! Put that down!

1105
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,197
<i>Was Aaron blowing me off?</i>

1106
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,998
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.

1107
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:41,917
- <i>Oh, no.</i>
- Look,

1108
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,088
I don't wanna hurt your feelings,
but I only date women of color.

1109
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,215
I have to pee.

1110
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:02,312
Get out.

1111
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,358
- Hey.
- Hey.

1112
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:49,818
I've been looking for you everywhere.

1113
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,361
Me, too.

1114
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:54,781
Wow, you look...

1115
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,118
- New clothes?
- Thanks.

1116
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,038
You wanna go downstairs?

1117
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,290
No, no. Let's stay here.

1118
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,503
Thanks for getting me
to come out tonight.

1119
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:09,755
Yeah, sure, no problem.

1120
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,050
I've wasted too much time
being pissed off at Regina.

1121
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:14,634
No more liars.

1122
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,553
I would never lie to you.

1123
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,430
I know, I know.

1124
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,223
Although...

1125
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:22,726
Okay, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once,

1126
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,103
but you're totally gonna laugh
when I tell you, so...

1127
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,855
Tell me what?

1128
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,151
I pretended to be bad at math
so that you'd help me.

1129
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,404
But the thing is,
I'm not really bad at math.

1130
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:37,741
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.

1131
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:40,410
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?

1132
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:43,080
Wait. You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.

1133
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:45,916
No. Not on purpose. Just, you know...

1134
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,709
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.

1135
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:49,544
So why didn't you just talk to me?

1136
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,713
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.

1137
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:53,340
Because you were her property...

1138
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,634
- Her property?
- No. Shut up. Not her property...

1139
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,427
No, don't tell me to shut up.

1140
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,596
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?

1141
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,224
You are just like a clone of Regina.

1142
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:05,227
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...

1143
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:09,856
<i>Oh, no. It was coming up again.
Word vomit. No, wait a minute...</i>

1144
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,191
What is this?

1145
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,734
<i>Actual vomit.</i>

1146
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,614
Aaron!

1147
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,825
Aaron, wait! Just...

1148
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:23,829
Okay. Call me.

1149
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,670
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.

1150
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,547
I'm sorry. I can explain.

1151
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,841
Explain how you forgot
to invite us to your party?

1152
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:37,759
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.

1153
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:40,470
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.

1154
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:42,931
Hey, buddy,
you're not pretending anymore.

1155
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:46,434
You're Plastic. Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.

1156
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,019
Curfew, 1 :00 a.m. It is now 1 :10.

1157
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:50,188
Did you have an awesome time?

1158
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:53,441
Did you drink awesome shooters
and listen to awesome music,

1159
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:56,278
and then just sit around and soak up
each other's awesomeness?

1160
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,946
You know what?
You're the one who made me like this

1161
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,532
so you could use me for
your eighth-grade revenge.

1162
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,660
God! See, at least me
and Regina George know we're mean.

1163
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:08,039
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "I used to live in Africa

1164
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:10,250
"with all the little birdies
and the little monkeys."

1165
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,420
You know what? It's not my fault you're,
like, in love with me or something!

1166
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,172
- What?
- Oh, no, she did not!

1167
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,674
See? That is the thing with you Plastics.

1168
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,093
You think that everybody
is in love with you,

1169
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:22,679
when actually everybody hates you.

1170
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,723
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.

1171
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,683
He broke up with Regina
and guess what.

1172
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,393
He still doesn't want you.

1173
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:31,897
So why are you still messing with
Regina, Cady? I'll tell you why.

1174
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,066
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!

1175
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:39,613
Here. You can have this. It won a prize.

1176
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,159
And I want my pink shirt back!

1177
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,536
I want my pink shirt back!

1178
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:02,761
Hon, slow down.

1179
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,805
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.

1180
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,099
Why are you eating a Kälteen bar?

1181
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:10,727
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.

1182
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:15,148
Coach Carr makes us eat those when
we wanna move up a weight class.

1183
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,234
What?

1184
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,654
They make you gain weight like crazy.

1185
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,031
Mother...

1186
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:55,146
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch

1187
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:58,483
I've ever met.

1188
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:02,028
Do not trust her.

1189
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:07,492
She is a fugly slut!

1190
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:32,809
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.

1191
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:35,103
Is this true?

1192
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,731
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?

1193
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,400
Good Lord.

1194
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:44,321
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."

1195
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,114
Fat whore.

1196
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:51,745
Okay, calm down, Miss George.

1197
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:55,081
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.

1198
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,293
Don't worry.
We're gonna find out who did it.

1199
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:01,838
There's only three girls
in the whole school who aren't in it.

1200
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,507
At your age,
you're gonna be having a lot of urges.

1201
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:08,136
You're gonna want to take off
your clothes and touch each other.

1202
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:12,599
But if you do touch each other,
you will get chlamydia and die.

1203
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,142
Coach Carr.

1204
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:21,274
Cady Heron, they wanna see you
in the principal's office.

1205
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:26,488
All right, chlamydia. K-L-A...

1206
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,534
In here, Miss Heron.

1207
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:42,712
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.

1208
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,427
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.

1209
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:51,930
I mean, yes, I've seen it before,
but it's not mine.

1210
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,723
You better get your story straight,
Miss Heron,

1211
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,558
because I'm not messing around here.

1212
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,644
It's not ours. It's Regina's.

1213
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:01,648
Yeah, she's trying to make it look like
we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.

1214
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,608
Miss Wieners, why would Regina

1215
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:07,779
refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?

1216
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:13,076
Miss Smith,
this is no time to be laughing.

1217
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,413
We're gonna get to the bottom
of this right now.

1218
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:37,600
Maybe we're not in that book
because everybody likes us,

1219
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:40,478
and I don't wanna be punished for
being well-liked.

1220
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:44,399
And I don't think my father,
the inventor of Toaster Strudel,

1221
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,192
would be too pleased to hear about this.

1222
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:57,829
"Made out with a hot dog"?

1223
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:00,540
Oh, my God, that was one time!

1224
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:06,963
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?

1225
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,549
Who wouldn't write that?

1226
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,969
"Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"?

1227
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,721
"And so did Sun Jin Dinh."

1228
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:16,598
You little slut!

1229
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,224
You're the slut!

1230
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:25,565
Hey! Hey! Settle down! All right, hey.

1231
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,318
No. You do not push and...

1232
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,167
Do you have anything else
you wanna say?

1233
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:48,713
No, I can't answer any more questions
until I have a parent or lawyer present.

1234
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,340
Miss Smith?

1235
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,719
Whoever wrote it probably didn't think
anyone would ever see it.

1236
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:57,055
I hope that nobody else
ever does see it.

1237
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,985
Mom, can you pick me up? I'm scared.

1238
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:14,739
- "Janis lan, dyke"?
- That's original.

1239
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:16,783
- "Too gay to function"?
- Hey!

1240
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,202
That's only okay when I say it.

1241
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:22,038
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!

1242
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,958
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!

1243
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,669
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!

1244
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,382
Yeah! Take your top off!

1245
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,636
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!

1246
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,639
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.

1247
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,776
<i>It was full-tilt jungle madness.</i>

1248
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,864
<i>And it wasn't going away.</i>

1249
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:05,915
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.

1250
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:09,419
Coach Carr,
step away from the underage girls.

1251
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,883
Let me help you down there.

1252
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:19,345
Hell, no!
I did not leave the South Side for this!

1253
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:25,268
Oh, crap! My hair!

1254
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:29,647
All junior girls report to the gymnasium,
immediately!

1255
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,065
Immediately!

1256
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,114
<i>Have you ever walked up to people
and realized</i>

1257
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,700
<i>they were just talking about you?</i>

1258
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:45,455
<i>Have you ever had it happen
60 times in a row?</i>

1259
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:47,415
<i>I have.</i>

1260
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:10,605
Never in my 14 years as an educator
have I seen such behavior,

1261
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,274
and from young ladies.

1262
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:17,987
I got parents calling me on the phone
asking, "Did someone get shot?"

1263
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,323
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.

1264
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,824
- No!
- No!

1265
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,326
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?

1266
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,496
Now, I'm not gonna do that,
because we've already paid the DJ,

1267
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:30,083
but don't think that I'm not taking
this book seriously.

1268
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,835
Coach Carr has fled school property.

1269
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:36,839
Ms. Norbury has been
accused of selling drugs.

1270
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,926
Now, what the young ladies
in this grade need

1271
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,095
is an attitude makeover.

1272
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,972
And you're gonna get it right now.

1273
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:48,893
I don't care how long it takes.
I will keep you here all night.

1274
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:50,603
We can't keep them past 4:00.

1275
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:53,106
I will keep you here until 4:00.

1276
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:57,318
Now, what we're gonna try to do is fix
the way you young ladies

1277
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:58,986
relate to each other.

1278
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:01,197
Okay. Lady to lady.

1279
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:05,660
So who has a lady problem
that they'd like to talk about?

1280
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,164
Yes?

1281
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:13,543
Somebody wrote in that book
that I'm lying about being a virgin

1282
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,336
because I use super-jumbo tampons.

1283
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:19,799
But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow
and a wide-set vagina.

1284
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:23,886
Yeah, I can't do this.

1285
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,388
Ms. Norbury.

1286
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:29,392
You're a successful, intelligent,
caring, graceful woman.

1287
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:30,685
I am?

1288
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:33,187
There has to be something that
you can say to these young ladies,

1289
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:35,398
something to help them
with their self-esteem.

1290
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:36,733
It's not a self-esteem problem.

1291
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:40,236
I think they're all pretty pleased
with themselves.

1292
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,030
Okay.

1293
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:48,494
Okay. Everybody, close your eyes.

1294
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:52,373
All right. I want you to raise your hand
if you have ever had a girl

1295
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:55,626
say something bad about you
behind your back.

1296
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,172
Open your eyes.

1297
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,884
Now, close your eyes again.

1298
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,803
And this time, I want you to raise
your hand if you have ever

1299
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:09,015
said anything about a friend
behind her back.

1300
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:16,230
Open them.

1301
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:23,279
There's been some
girl-on-girl crime here.

1302
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:28,075
Okay, so what we could do today
is a couple exercises to help you

1303
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:31,078
express your anger in a healthy way.

1304
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:33,498
Let's start over here.

1305
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:35,458
<i>Ms. Norbury had us confront
each other directly</i>

1306
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,251
<i>about the things that were bothering us,</i>

1307
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:39,378
<i>and it seemed like every clique
had its own problems.</i>

1308
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:42,381
You've been acting really stuck-up
ever since you switched to shortfielder,

1309
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,592
and Dawn agrees with me.

1310
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:46,302
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this.

1311
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:47,428
I'm pitching tomorrow.

1312
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:49,305
Why are you scamming
on my boyfriend?

1313
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:52,391
You're just jealous because
guys like me better.

1314
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:54,602
Nigga, please.

1315
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,605
Okay. Good.

1316
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:01,609
Can I just say that we don't have
a clique problem at this school?

1317
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,820
And some of us shouldn't have
to take this workshop,

1318
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:06,781
because some of us are just victims
in this situation.

1319
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,157
That's probably true.

1320
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,951
How many of you have ever felt

1321
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:13,079
personally victimized
by Regina George?

1322
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:25,508
Good. Okay, who's next?

1323
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,176
Who's next?

1324
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:30,847
Cady.

1325
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:33,182
Do you have anything
you wanna own up to?

1326
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,308
<i>Yes.</i>

1327
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:35,643
No.

1328
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,521
You never made up a rumor
about anybody?

1329
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:39,981
<i>Just that you sell drugs.</i>

1330
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,566
No.

1331
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:44,277
Nothing you want to apologize for?

1332
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,695
<i>I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury</i>

1333
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:48,114
<i>without getting blamed for
the whole Burn Book.</i>

1334
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,407
No.

1335
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,786
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.

1336
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:58,791
Okay, so we're all here
because of this book, right?

1337
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,627
Well, I don't know who wrote this book,

1338
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:05,673
but you all have got to stop calling
each other sluts and whores.

1339
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:08,885
It just makes it okay for guys
to call you sluts and whores.

1340
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:11,637
Who here has ever been called a slut?

1341
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,518
Okay, everybody up.

1342
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:21,522
<i>Ms. Norbury had us write out apologies
to people that we'd hurt in our lives.</i>

1343
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:25,359
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you
a gap-toothed bitch.

1344
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:28,487
"It's not your fault
you're so gap-toothed."

1345
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:33,993
"Gretchen,

1346
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,704
"I'm sorry I laughed at you that time
you got diarrhea

1347
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,164
"at Barnes & Noble,

1348
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,917
"and I'm sorry I told everyone about it,"

1349
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,544
and I'm sorry for repeating it now.

1350
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:50,384
Laura, I don't hate you
because you're fat.

1351
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:52,845
You're fat because I hate you.

1352
01:13:56,515 --> 01:14:00,603
"I just wish we could all get along
like we used to in middle school.

1353
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:04,482
"I wish that I could bake a cake
made out of rainbows and smiles,

1354
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,859
"and we'd all eat it and be happy."

1355
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:09,111
She doesn't even go here!

1356
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:12,615
Do you even go to this school?

1357
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:15,743
No. I just have a lot of feelings.

1358
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,204
Okay, go home.

1359
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,876
Sharon, I think you're doing a great job.

1360
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,586
Thanks. I feel like I'm getting through.

1361
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:28,589
"I'm sorry that people
are so jealous of me,

1362
01:14:28,673 --> 01:14:31,550
"but I can't help it that I'm popular."

1363
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:39,433
Oh, my God! Oh, jeez. Okay, walk it off.
Walk it off.

1364
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,519
Okay, that hurt.

1365
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:44,480
They're okay.

1366
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:46,315
They're okay.

1367
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:51,779
Oh, boy. Okay, who's next?
Who's next? Keep it going.

1368
01:14:55,533 --> 01:15:00,037
Oh, my God. It's her dream come true,
diving into a big pile of girls.

1369
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,582
Okay. Yeah, I've got an apology.

1370
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:10,131
So I have this friend
who is a new student this year,

1371
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:15,386
and I convinced her that it would be fun
to mess up Regina George's life.

1372
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:17,847
So I had her pretend
to be friends with Regina,

1373
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,390
and then she would
come to my house after

1374
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:22,059
and we would just laugh about
all the dumb stuff Regina said.

1375
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:26,188
And we gave her these candy bar things
that would make her gain weight,

1376
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:28,816
and we turned
her best friends against her.

1377
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:31,569
And then... Oh, yeah, Cady.
You know my friend Cady.

1378
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:34,113
She made out with Regina's boyfriend

1379
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,157
and then convinced him
to break up with her.

1380
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,993
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream
instead of face wash.

1381
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,954
God! I am so sorry, Regina.

1382
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:43,831
Really, I don't know why I did it.

1383
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:49,712
I guess it's probably because
I've got a big lesbian crush on you.

1384
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,505
Suck on that!

1385
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:56,927
Janis! Janis! Janis! Janis!

1386
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,101
Regina!

1387
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:07,897
Regina, wait!
I didn't mean for that to happen.

1388
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,899
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.

1389
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,984
Regina, please! Regina, stop!

1390
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:14,987
No! Do you know
what everyone says about you?

1391
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:17,198
They say that
you're a home-schooled jungle freak

1392
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,241
who's a less-hot version of me.

1393
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:21,827
Yeah. So don't try to act so innocent.

1394
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:25,498
You can take that fake apology
and shove it right up your hairy...

1395
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:32,129
<i>And that's how Regina George died.</i>

1396
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:35,424
<i>No, I'm totally kidding,
but she did get hurt.</i>

1397
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:37,927
<i>Some girls say they saw her head
go all the way around,</i>

1398
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,428
<i>but that's just a rumor.</i>

1399
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:42,306
<i>Some people swear they saw me
push her in front of the bus.</i>

1400
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:44,934
<i>That was an even worse rumor.</i>

1401
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:48,395
- Everybody done?
- No. Mom, I didn't do it.

1402
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,856
I don't know what to believe anymore.

1403
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,609
Mom, believe me. I'm your daughter.

1404
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:59,115
Why are my tribal vases under the sink?

1405
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:02,701
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?

1406
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:04,286
I don't know.

1407
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:06,789
This is the fertility vase
of the Ndebele tribe.

1408
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:09,625
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.

1409
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:12,336
Who are you?

1410
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:20,594
Great. All my friends hate me,
and now my mom hates me.

1411
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:23,097
Your mom does not hate you.

1412
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,432
She's afraid of you.

1413
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:30,563
I don't know, maybe we
mainstream-schooled you too soon.

1414
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:35,359
Maybe you should come back and
be home-schooled again for a while.

1415
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:39,280
No. Only thing worse than going back
will be not going back.

1416
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:42,575
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?

1417
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:46,537
Remember when we saw those lions
fighting over the wart hog carcass?

1418
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,247
I'll be the wart hog.

1419
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,083
You're not a wart hog. You're a lion.

1420
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:54,920
Just focus on your studies
for a little while.

1421
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,506
You're still an excellent student, right?

1422
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:00,718
Oh, yeah.
I need you to sign my calculus test.

1423
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,429
- Why?
- I'm failing.

1424
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,893
Okay. You are...

1425
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,771
What do they call it?

1426
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,190
Grounded.

1427
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,941
You're grounded.

1428
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:46,889
She pushed her in front of the bus.

1429
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,641
Did you see her do it?

1430
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,100
Yes.

1431
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:08,744
Did your teacher ever try to sell you
marijuana or ecstasy tablets?

1432
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:11,247
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?

1433
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:13,624
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?

1434
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:17,920
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.

1435
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,046
I know, Aaron,

1436
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:21,215
but after the allegations
against Coach Carr

1437
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,884
turned out to be extremely true,

1438
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:27,054
the school board felt that it was best
that we investigate every claim made

1439
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:28,597
in this Burn Book.

1440
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:31,058
That book was written
by a bunch of stupid girls

1441
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:33,060
who make up rumors
because they're bored

1442
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:35,104
with their own lame lives.

1443
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:38,107
Well, unless someone wants to come
forward and say, "I made it all up,"

1444
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,901
this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...

1445
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:44,697
<i>Oh, no. Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.</i>

1446
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:49,618
Mr. Duvall. I wrote it.

1447
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:54,748
Come on, Cady.

1448
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:05,134
<i>When you get bit by a snake,
you're supposed to suck the poison out.</i>

1449
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:09,054
<i>That's what I had to do,
suck all the poison out of my life.</i>

1450
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,390
<i>I started with Regina,</i>

1451
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,892
<i>who was living proof that
the more people are scared of you,</i>

1452
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:16,061
<i>the more flowers you get.</i>

1453
01:20:16,437 --> 01:20:17,896
<i>Then there was Ms. Norbury,</i>

1454
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:21,567
<i>who was living proof that no good deed
goes unpunished.</i>

1455
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:24,737
Hi. Did you wanna buy some drugs?

1456
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:28,824
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait. I'll grade it right now.

1457
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:35,664
I gotta say,
watching the police search my house

1458
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:39,293
really was the cherry on top
of a fantastic year.

1459
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:43,172
How much trouble did you get in
for telling the truth?

1460
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:44,590
A lot.

1461
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,592
Well, you didn't write
that whole book yourself.

1462
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,927
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?

1463
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,429
No, because I'm trying this new thing

1464
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:52,973
where I don't talk about people
behind their backs.

1465
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,183
That's right.

1466
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:56,268
Getting hit by a bus
is pretty good punishment.

1467
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:57,728
Ninety-four.

1468
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:59,605
Welcome back, nerd.

1469
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:01,357
Thanks.

1470
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:05,611
Anyway, I'm sorry.

1471
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,113
I forgive you.

1472
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:10,657
But as my own personal form
of punishment,

1473
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:14,536
I figured out how
you're gonna earn that extra credit.

1474
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,121
What's up?

1475
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:17,141
Excellent. Great turnout this year.

1476
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,859
- All right. It's all you.
- Okay.

1477
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,861
- Make me look good out there.
- Okay.

1478
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:33,031
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.

1479
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:34,741
- You nervous?
- Yes.

1480
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:36,201
Don't be. You can do this.

1481
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,328
There's nothing to break your focus,

1482
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:41,623
because not one of those
Marymount boys is cute.

1483
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,168
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1484
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:47,254
<i>and welcome to the Illinois High School
Mathletes State Championship.</i>

1485
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:50,674
<i>Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.</i>

1486
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:54,386
<i>Twice the larger of two numbers is
three more than five times the smaller,</i>

1487
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,138
<i>and the sum of four times the larger</i>

1488
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:59,558
<i>and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...</i>

1489
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:01,727
<i>-North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.</i>

1490
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,520
<i>That is correct. Question number two.</i>

1491
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:06,815
<i>Find an odd three-digit number
whose digits add up to 12.</i>

1492
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:08,150
<i>The digits are all different,</i>

1493
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,943
<i>and the difference between
the first two digits</i>

1494
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:11,695
<i>equals the difference between...</i>

1495
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:13,697
<i>-Marymount?
- 741.</i>

1496
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:16,825
<i>-Correct.
- Shoot. I was really rusty.</i>

1497
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,537
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.

1498
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:22,831
She's grounded.

1499
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:26,210
Are they not allowed out
when they're grounded?

1500
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:35,469
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling
King and Queen, people.

1501
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,597
These A-holes will represent you
for a full calendar year.

1502
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,767
I'm gonna vote for Regina George
because she got hit by that bus.

1503
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,978
I'm voting for Cady Heron
because she pushed her.

1504
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:56,865
She's supposed to be grounded,
but he let her out.

1505
01:23:56,949 --> 01:24:00,869
<i>After 87 minutes of very competitive
play, we have a tie.</i>

1506
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:04,206
<i>In the event of a tie,
we move into a sudden-death round.</i>

1507
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:08,210
<i>Each team is given the opportunity
to choose their opponent.</i>

1508
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:12,214
- <i>North Shore, who do you select?</i>
- The girl, dude. The girl.

1509
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:13,882
<i>Contestant Krafft.</i>

1510
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,718
<i>From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.</i>

1511
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:21,682
<i>We pick the girl, too.</i>

1512
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,393
<i>And from North Shore,
Miss Cady Heron.</i>

1513
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:25,978
<i>It's Cady.</i>

1514
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:28,814
Oh, my God, that's me.

1515
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:39,908
<i>Miss Caroline Krafft seriously
needed to pluck her eyebrows.</i>

1516
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:43,829
<i>Her outfit looked like it was picked out
by a blind Sunday school teacher,</i>

1517
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:47,541
<i>and she had some 99¢ lip gloss
on her snaggletooth.</i>

1518
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:50,586
<i>And that's when I realized,
making fun of Caroline Krafft</i>

1519
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:53,255
<i>wouldn't stop her from beating me
in this contest.</i>

1520
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:56,842
<i>Contestants,
find the limit of this equation.</i>

1521
01:24:57,843 --> 01:25:00,429
<i>Calling somebody else fat
won't make you any skinnier.</i>

1522
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,931
<i>Calling someone stupid
doesn't make you any smarter.</i>

1523
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:06,602
<i>And ruining Regina George's life
definitely didn't make me any happier.</i>

1524
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:10,939
<i>All you can do in life is try to solve
the problem in front of you.</i>

1525
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:12,441
<i>The limit is negative one.</i>

1526
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,026
<i>Oh, crap. I lost.</i>

1527
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,194
<i>That answer is incorrect.</i>

1528
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:17,821
<i>Now, we are in a sudden death.</i>

1529
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:22,034
<i>If Miss Heron can answer this problem
correctly, we have a winner.</i>

1530
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:25,787
<i>Limits. Why couldn't I remember
anything about limits?</i>

1531
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:28,457
<i>Limits. That was the week
Aaron got his haircut.</i>

1532
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:31,126
<i>Oh, God, he looked so cute.
Okay, focus, Cady.</i>

1533
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,128
<i>What was on the board
behind Aaron's head?</i>

1534
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:37,132
<i>If the limit never approaches anything...</i>

1535
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:39,301
The limit does not exist.

1536
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:40,969
The limit does not exist!

1537
01:25:41,053 --> 01:25:43,055
<i>Our new state champions,</i>

1538
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:45,724
- <i>the North Shore Mathletes.</i>
- Yeah!

1539
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,818
How do you like me now?

1540
01:25:56,902 --> 01:26:00,322
You like that?
Yeah! Get some! Get some!

1541
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:03,200
Awesome.
You went with the leather sleeves.

1542
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:06,244
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.

1543
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,330
Thanks, K.G.

1544
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:11,541
We're gonna look so kick-ass in these
when we roll into Spring Fling.

1545
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:13,543
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?

1546
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:14,836
Cady, this is your night.

1547
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:17,547
Don't let the haters
stop you from doing your thang.

1548
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:18,840
Did you just say "thang"?

1549
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:21,301
Cady, you don't have to punish
yourself forever.

1550
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:23,303
But I'm grounded.

1551
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:25,222
You're already out.

1552
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:37,776
<i>All right, do we have all of our nominees</i>

1553
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,404
<i>forking and queen on the stage?</i>

1554
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:41,697
<i>Okay, good.</i>

1555
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:45,075
<i>I just wanted to say
that you're all winners,</i>

1556
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:48,954
<i>and I could not be happier
that this school year's ending.</i>

1557
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:51,039
<i>Here we go.</i>

1558
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:55,127
<i>The winner of the Spring Fling King,</i>

1559
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,463
- <i>Shane Oman.</i>
- Yes!

1560
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:01,800
That's what I'm talking about!

1561
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:06,680
<i>And your Spring Fling Queen,</i>

1562
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:09,224
<i>future co-chair of
the Student Activities Board</i>

1563
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:13,854
<i>and winner of two gift certificates
to the Walker Brothers Pancake House,</i>

1564
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,148
<i>Cady Heron.</i>

1565
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:22,320
<i>Where is Cady?</i>

1566
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,824
<i>There she is.</i>

1567
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:43,842
<i>Wow. Thanks.</i>

1568
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:48,764
<i>Well, half the people
in this room are mad at me</i>

1569
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:51,892
<i>and the other half only like me</i>

1570
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:55,270
<i>because they think
I pushed somebody in front of a bus.</i>

1571
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:57,272
<i>So that's not good.</i>

1572
01:27:58,231 --> 01:28:00,692
You know, it's not really required of you
to make a speech.

1573
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:02,819
I'm almost done, I swear.

1574
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:08,158
<i>To all the people whose feelings
that got hurt by the Burn Book,</i>

1575
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:11,036
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

1576
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:15,457
<i>You know, I've never been
to one of these things before,</i>

1577
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:18,877
<i>and when I think about
how many people wanted this</i>

1578
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:22,881
<i>and how many people
cried over it and stuff..</i>

1579
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:27,636
<i>I mean, I think everybody
looks like royalty tonight.</i>

1580
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:31,139
<i>Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.</i>

1581
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:34,851
<i>And Emma Gerber, I mean,
that hairdo must have taken hours,</i>

1582
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:37,229
<i>and you look really pretty.</i>

1583
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:40,440
<i>So,</i>

1584
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:43,902
<i>why is everybody stressing
over this thing?</i>

1585
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:47,572
<i>I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...</i>

1586
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:52,953
<i>Share it.</i>

1587
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:56,915
<i>A piece for Gretchen Wieners,
a partial Spring Fling Queen.</i>

1588
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:01,753
<i>A piece for Janis lan.</i>

1589
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:06,341
Seriously, most people
just take the crown and go.

1590
01:29:06,424 --> 01:29:08,510
<i>And a piece for Regina George.</i>

1591
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:12,514
<i>She fractured her spine,
and she still looks like a rock star.</i>

1592
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:15,350
Thank you.

1593
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:17,936
<i>And some for everybody else.</i>

1594
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:30,365
<i>God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?</i>

1595
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:31,950
Thanks.

1596
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:35,287
<i>All right, have a good time, everyone.</i>

1597
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,461
Look. I'm a queen.

1598
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:45,505
As am I.

1599
01:29:45,589 --> 01:29:47,299
- Hey.
- Hey.

1600
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:50,135
So are we still in a fight?

1601
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:52,804
Are you still an asshole?

1602
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:54,306
I don't think so.

1603
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,683
Well, then I guess we're okay.

1604
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:58,393
Oh, my God, I love this song!

1605
01:29:58,476 --> 01:29:59,853
I hate this song.

1606
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:01,813
I know this song!

1607
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:05,108
Man candy, stage right.

1608
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:11,489
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey. Didn't think you'd make it.

1609
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:14,284
On behalf of the senior class,

1610
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:16,369
I'd like to present you
with two gift certificates...

1611
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:18,705
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.

1612
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:23,460
One gift certificate to
the Walker Brothers Pancake House.

1613
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:25,128
Thank you.

1614
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:32,469
Congratulations on winning State.

1615
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:34,638
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.

1616
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:36,723
I thought I was gonna hurl.

1617
01:30:36,806 --> 01:30:39,142
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.

1618
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:41,770
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.

1619
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:44,397
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

1620
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:46,900
Okay. Grool.

1621
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:13,551
- No.
- No.

1622
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:18,223
- What's up?
- Can I help you?

1623
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:20,809
You Puerto Rican?

1624
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:23,687
- Lebanese.
- I feel that.

1625
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:42,163
<i>In case you're wondering,
The Plastics broke up.</i>

1626
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:44,582
<i>Regina's spine healed,
and her physical therapist</i>

1627
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:47,877
<i>taught her to channel
all her rage into sports.</i>

1628
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:55,885
<i>It was perfect, because the jock girls
weren't afraid of her.</i>

1629
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:02,600
<i>Karen used her special talents to do
the morning weather announcements.</i>

1630
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:04,394
Hi. This is Karen Smith.

1631
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:06,021
It's 68 degrees,

1632
01:32:06,104 --> 01:32:09,774
and there's a 30% chance
that it's already raining.

1633
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:13,236
<i>And Gretchen found herself
a new clique</i>

1634
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:14,821
<i>and a new queen bee to serve.</i>

1635
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:23,663
<i>Aaron went to Northwestern,
so I still get to see him on weekends.</i>

1636
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:26,166
<i>And me? I had gone from
home-schooled jungle freak</i>

1637
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:30,587
<i>to shiny Plastic to most hated person
in the world to actual human being.</i>

1638
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:31,963
Hey.

1639
01:32:32,756 --> 01:32:36,634
<i>All the drama from last year
just wasn't important anymore.</i>

1640
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:40,472
<i>School used to be like a shark tank,
but now I could just float.</i>

1641
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:41,890
Regina.

1642
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:44,517
<i>Finally, Girl World was at peace.</i>

1643
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:50,023
Hey, check it out. Junior Plastics.

1644
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:54,235
<i>And if any freshmen tried
to disturb that peace...</i>

1645
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:57,864
<i>Well, let's just say we knew
how to take care of it.</i>

1646
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:04,996
<i>Just kidding.</i>
