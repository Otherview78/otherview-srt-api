1
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:16,507
Yeah. We got this.

2
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:21,762
<i>...here at
the MGM Grand tonight, Roy.</i>

3
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:25,474
<i>And, you know, when Adonis Creed
lost to "Pretty" Ricky Conlan,</i>

4
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:28,227
<i>he was really a curiosity
more than anything else.</i>

5
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,812
<i>But that was an epic fight,</i>

6
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,731
<i>and since then,
he's reeled off six straight wins,</i>

7
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:36,944
<i>and tonight attempts against
Danny "The Stuntman" Wheeler</i>

8
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,697
<i>to become the heavyweight champion
of the world.</i>

9
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:44,452
<i>It bears mentioning that
Creed actually wagered his Mustang</i>

10
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,954
<i>before their sparring session, Roy.</i>

11
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,875
<i>And rumor has it that same Mustang
is on the line again tonight.</i>

12
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,253
Okay, everybody out. Let's go.

13
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,468
- Hey.
- Hey.

14
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,595
- Feel good?
- Mmm-hmm.

15
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:06,223
Yeah. Remember to
keep your right hand up, okay?

16
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,850
His left is just as strong as his right.

17
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:09,852
- Yep.
- Yeah.

18
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,198
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Okay, good.

19
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,536
It's just another fight, okay?

20
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,165
You got this.

21
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,847
You know,
there's only three steps into that ring.

22
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,183
Just three.

23
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,479
And tonight, it's gonna
look as high as a mountain.

24
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,275
And when you climb through them ropes,

25
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,737
it's gonna be
the loneliest place in the world

26
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,989
because you're gonna be in there
with another fighter

27
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:06,075
who wants to take you out.

28
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:09,203
So now, you gotta ask yourself,

29
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,373
are you here to prove something
to other people

30
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,293
or prove something to yourself?

31
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:21,840
To myself.

32
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,468
Right.

33
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,805
Now, let me ask you something.

34
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:28,889
What?

35
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:31,809
What's with the hair?

36
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:35,521
I combed it. It's a special night.

37
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,233
Shouldn't you be thinking about
something else, wise guy?

38
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:44,488
Now, you can go prove it.

39
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,284
Now go get your Mustang back.

40
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,706
These guys have really
been mixing it up here in the fourth.

41
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,959
So far, Creed's youth
outweighing Wheeler's experience.

42
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,169
Let's go! Let's go, baby. Let's go!

43
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,548
Maybe the most amazing part
of Adonis Creed's journey, Roy...

44
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,216
Don't drop that guard! Sit.

45
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,384
...is that tonight, he fights...

46
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,552
Keep your hands up!

47
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,262
...for the same belt held by
both his trainer, Rocky Balboa,

48
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,181
and his father, the great Apollo Creed.

49
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,517
Whoo!

50
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,812
Wheeler seems to be waking up.
We've seen this before, Roy.

51
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:20,107
When Wheeler smells blood,
he really turns it on.

52
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,032
Come on back.

53
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,959
Come on, D!

54
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:40,628
Three years ago,
that's a knockout.

55
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:44,381
Wheeler's power just isn't the same,
and no doubt Creed can sense it.

56
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,676
You got him. Stay on him!

57
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,888
Creed's on a mission,
really pressing the issue now.

58
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,931
And a big left hook lands flush!

59
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,935
Creed staying in the pocket, Max.
Moving, not running.

60
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,396
Come on, now! Hands up! Hands up!

61
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,732
These two men
are really going at it.

62
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,816
Tell him, Donnie!

63
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:04,860
Another left hook
drives Wheeler back.

64
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:05,986
Come on, baby!

65
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,240
That was a sneaky little uppercut
on the inside,

66
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,867
and Wheeler's hurt by that, Roy.

67
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,661
Yeah, that wobbled
his legs pretty bad.

68
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,621
- Another big shot!
- Hold him, hold him, hold him!

69
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,414
Creed has him in trouble, Max.

70
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,916
Wheeler's doing what he can...

71
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:23,837
Wheeler is down!

72
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,214
Wheeler has hit the canvas!

73
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,007
Now stay there, boy!

74
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,467
Creed taught you!

75
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,968
Come and give me my keys!

76
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:32,096
Get up! Come on, baby!

77
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,472
Get up, get up!

78
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,474
- Wheeler, trying to get up.
- One!

79
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,642
- Stay down!
- Two!

80
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,435
I don't know
if he makes this count, Roy.

81
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,520
Three!

82
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,021
Four!

83
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:42,731
Five!

84
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,149
Six!

85
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,193
Seven!

86
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:47,486
Eight!

87
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,238
Nine!

88
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,240
That's it. That's it.

89
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,325
And it's over, Max.

90
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,452
No way! Adonis Creed...

91
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,496
Give me my keys!

92
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,915
...is the heavyweight champion
of the world.

93
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,711
You know what you just did?

94
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:04,962
Yeah.

95
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,089
Baby, you know what just happened?

96
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,346
When you think of
where this kid has come from,

97
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,641
the most unlikely beginning
for a fighter, Roy.

98
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,852
Growing up the way he did

99
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,938
to make it to the
top of boxing in this way...

100
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,314
It's unprecedented!

101
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,358
Creed! Creed! Creed!

102
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:29,111
It's one thing
to be the number one contender.

103
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,239
It's a whole other thing to be champion.

104
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:38,996
This is the first step
to building a legacy of his own,

105
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,709
and I can hardly wait to see
what's next for Adonis Creed.

106
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,423
Whoa.

107
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,175
I mean, what do you think?

108
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,593
That's...

109
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,303
That is beautiful.

110
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,596
- Right?
- Yeah.

111
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,680
But we gotta hurry up.

112
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,390
I mean, she's about to
get out the shower any second.

113
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,851
Yo, Donnie, why didn't you
tell me about this before?

114
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,102
I didn't know if I was gonna win.

115
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,771
What's that got to do with it?

116
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,189
I don't know.

117
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,775
Look, just tell me what I should do.

118
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,277
You get down on one knee.

119
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,862
People still do that shit?

120
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,697
You can always send her a text.

121
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:16,283
Come on, Unc,
I'm being serious, all right?

122
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,618
I mean, what did you say?

123
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,702
- To Adrian?
- Yeah.

124
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,579
It was a long time ago.

125
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,791
We were at the zoo.
It was winter. It was snowing.

126
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,751
Everything smelled fresh.

127
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,004
There was this tiger.
He had snow on its back.

128
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,341
- And he's walking in the background.
- Okay, I get it. I get it.

129
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,801
Just tell me what you said.

130
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,469
Well, I was getting to that part.

131
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,637
What I said is...

132
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,390
I asked if she would not mind
marrying me very much,

133
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:44,061
which is kind of a dumb way
of saying she's my world,

134
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,397
and she made me better
than I deserved to be.

135
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:49,817
You know?

136
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,403
Yeah.

137
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,448
Listen, why don't you
just turn off your brain

138
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,367
and let your heart do the talking.

139
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,160
Click.

140
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,830
You'll do good.

141
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,165
- Turn my brain off?
- Yeah.

142
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,543
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

143
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,128
- All right.
- All right.

144
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,797
All right, I'm on it.

145
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,097
- Hey, Unc.
- Mmm.

146
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,559
You good?

147
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,562
Yeah, real good. Thank you.

148
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:28,856
- Great.
- All right.

149
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,508
Will you marry me?

150
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:10,898
Listen, B.

151
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,110
I know we've been
dating for a few years now,

152
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,195
and it's just something about us
that just click.

153
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,157
I don't know how to explain it,

154
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,036
but the feeling I get
when you're by my side is a feeling

155
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,245
that I can't live without.

156
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,292
I know I sound crazy, but, look,
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

157
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,716
Will you marry me?

158
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,259
I'm still hungry, babe,

159
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,552
I don't know why.

160
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,974
Are you for real, D?

161
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,810
Yeah, I'm for real.

162
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,520
No, stop playin'.

163
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,772
I ain't playin'.

164
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:54,900
You didn't hear any of that?

165
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:57,903
None of what?

166
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,114
Hmm.

167
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,160
None of what, D?

168
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:15,963
What did you say?

169
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,510
Nothing that you don't already know.

170
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,138
Remind me.

171
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,517
I said that I love you,

172
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,146
and that I need you.

173
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,275
D, do you know
what you're doing right now?

174
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,277
I mean, yeah, kind of.

175
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:40,696
What do you mean, "kind of"?

176
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,366
Babe!

177
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,034
I mean...

178
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,161
To keep it real with you, B,

179
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,289
you're the only person

180
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,376
I wanna share my moments with.

181
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,381
So, Bianca Taylor,

182
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,140
will you marry me?

183
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,185
Yo.

184
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,564
Yo.

185
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,359
- "Yo"? Is that a yes?
- Yes.

186
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,610
It's yes?

187
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,571
Yes!

188
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:23,947
Yeah.

189
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:53,947
<b>Subtitle

190
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,002
Viktor.

191
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:55,872
Our boy's looking good.

192
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,668
I'm sure you heard the good news.

193
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,753
It's time.

194
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,929
You ever thought
about going back to LA?

195
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,265
Please, you're a Philly girl.

196
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,767
Yeah, I guess,

197
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,728
but it'd be nice to have more space.

198
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,314
And your mom's out there...

199
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,691
And them labels, too.

200
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,819
Could help me get my music out
to more people.

201
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,445
Hmm.

202
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,867
I don't know, I feel like I've done
everything I could in Philly, you know?

203
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,998
Time ain't exactly on my side, you know?

204
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,294
Mmm-hmm.

205
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,175
What about Rocky?

206
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,887
Rocky has his life, D.

207
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,972
We gotta start ours.

208
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,804
<i>It's a cold one today, Adrian,
that's for sure.</i>

209
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:40,310
I tried calling our son Bobby
a few times.

210
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,939
But I'd hang up every time
he was about to pick up

211
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,441
because, to tell you the truth,
I didn't know what to say to him.

212
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,110
What if he's moving on,

213
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:52,280
and I'm like this chunk of yesterday
trying to be today?

214
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,448
I just don't fit in.

215
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,577
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

216
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:03,083
Knock on his door and say,
"Hey, how you doing?

217
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,462
What's it been, a lot of years?"
I don't know.

218
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:21,851
I miss you.

219
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,076
You've been hype
ever since you got this jawn.

220
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,370
What are you talking about?

221
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,788
That smile right there.

222
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,041
You're cheezin'.

223
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,335
It's the only thing my pops left me.

224
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,545
I mean, that and these hands.

225
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,008
- You never told me that.
- Yeah.

226
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,510
What's up with you
and these secrets, Don?

227
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,188
How're you doing?
All right, all right.

228
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,858
But look at this, here.

229
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,693
- How you doing?
- Hey.

230
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,698
- Hey, Isabelle.
- Hey, Rock.

231
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:02,994
Hey, listen. Some big guy's
sitting over there, waiting for you.

232
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:04,496
He said you'll know who he is.

233
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,377
Yo, champ.

234
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,671
You gotta take that fight, man.
Shut this dude up.

235
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:17,175
No, Wheeler still talking shit?
It's a little early for a rematch, bro.

236
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,469
Hey, turn the TV up.

237
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,931
<i>...and the tragic history
that connects them.</i>

238
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,320
That you?

239
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,326
Nice pictures.

240
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,830
Yeah, they're okay.

241
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,918
No pictures of me.

242
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,879
No, there's no pictures of that.

243
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,217
Why are you in Philly?

244
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,887
You don't know?

245
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:07,475
<i>Ukrainian boxer Viktor Drago
appeared today in Philadelphia</i>

246
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,310
<i>to issue a very public challenge</i>

247
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:12,856
<i>to recently crowned
heavyweight champion Adonis Creed.</i>

248
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,943
<i>A press conference was held earlier
by boxing promoter Buddy Marcelle.</i>

249
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,113
<i>We came all the way to Philly
to let you know it's serious.</i>

250
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,366
<i>Now, this man here,
he ain't no Danny Wheeler.</i>

251
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,995
<i>And let's be honest, Creed fought him
three years too late, anyway.</i>

252
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:28,746
<i>Easy match.</i>

253
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,125
<i>People in this country love you.</i>

254
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:36,796
But Russia,

255
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,884
no one touch Drago name.

256
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,887
Everything changed that night.

257
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,015
Look, you know, that's like

258
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,809
a million years ago.

259
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,271
Like yesterday to me.

260
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,858
So, you came all the way
over here to tell me that?

261
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,987
<i>It's no coincidence
that Ivan Drago's son shows up</i>

262
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,948
<i>right after Apollo Creed's son
claims the belt.</i>

263
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,493
<i>This is Creed versus Drago.</i>

264
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:09,579
<i>This is the fight
the whole world wants to see.</i>

265
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,539
And this is the fight he should take.

266
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,542
Unless he's afraid of
history repeating itself.

267
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,046
<i>That history
being the infamous 1985 match</i>

268
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:22,091
<i>in which boxing legend Apollo Creed
was killed by Russian fighter</i>

269
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,343
<i>Ivan Drago.</i>

270
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:26,971
<i>Apollo's trainer Rocky Balboa
was heavily criticized</i>

271
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,640
<i>for failing to stop that fight.</i>

272
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,184
D. Baby.

273
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:34,896
It's a publicity stunt.

274
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:39,567
Don't worry about that.

275
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:40,777
<i>And let's not forget,</i>

276
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:46,199
<i>later that year, Balboa defeated Drago
in his own backyard, Russia.</i>

277
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,828
<i>Because of you,
I lose everything.</i>

278
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:53,665
Country.

279
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:55,917
Respect.

280
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:01,589
Wife.

281
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,803
You ever see stray dogs in Ukraine?

282
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,264
They go for days with no food.

283
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,016
People spit on them. They have nothing.

284
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,142
No home.

285
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,938
Only will to survive, to fight.

286
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:22,944
I have son.

287
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,159
All he knows

288
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,495
is this.

289
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,129
My son will break your boy.

290
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:43,881
Been a long day.

291
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:47,510
I think we're done here.

292
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:53,099
Because around here we put strays away.

293
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,282
Hmm.

294
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,250
It's good picture.

295
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,471
I kind of figured you'd be here.

296
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:35,391
You know, I tried calling and calling,
but nobody picked up or anything.

297
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,232
Kind of early to be training,
don't you think, after a fight?

298
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,567
Just trying to clear my head.

299
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:46,903
I get that.

300
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,697
Cheaper than a shrink, that's for sure.

301
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,786
Hey, Don, come on.
I heard what's going on.

302
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,871
But you can't let them get inside.

303
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,208
But I know how you're feeling.

304
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,211
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah, I do.

305
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:07,965
What happened a long time ago,
that ain't got nothing to do with you.

306
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:14,180
Listen, that fight is
what Apollo wanted, all right?

307
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:15,848
It shouldn't have happened.

308
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:17,350
But it did.

309
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:21,604
And you gotta let it go.

310
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,273
Come on.

311
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,405
You've seen him fight, though?

312
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,616
I've seen him on sports TV
and stuff like that.

313
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,119
He's big, but he's raw.

314
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:40,873
He ain't no mean machine like you are,
that's for sure.

315
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:42,792
You know what?

316
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:46,087
I'm gonna cheer you up,
'cause today's gonna be your lucky day.

317
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,047
Christmas just came early for you,

318
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:50,174
'cause I'm gonna hold the bag,
lucky guy.

319
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:52,135
- No, you're the one who's lucky.
- How's that?

320
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,553
'Cause I'm gonna let you
hold the bag for me.

321
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:54,637
Yo.

322
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,348
That's it. That's better.

324

Call it whatever you want.

347

Yeah? What's that?

353
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,023
In the history of boxing,

354
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:14,026
there have been
77 heavyweight champions.

355
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,236
You know that?

356
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,239
But how many do you think they know?

357
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:20,700
Four?

358
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:22,410
Five?

359
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:27,832
The belt ain't enough.

360
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,960
You need a narrative.
Something that sticks to the ribs.

361
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,298
Your dad, he knew that.

362
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,508
Do yourself a favor, brah,

363
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:39,886
and quit while you ahead.

364
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:42,096
Self-preservation.

365
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,850
At least you got that over your old man.

366
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:52,148
That must be Rocky
whispering in your ear.

367
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:01,407
I'm serious.

368
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,702
Amazing voice.

369
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,495
Yo, thank you, Fillmore.

370
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:08,581
For real though, thank you.

371
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,762
How you doing, kid?

372
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,180
We gotta talk.

373
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,975
Let's take a walk and get some air.

374
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:32,104
Okay? Kind of stuffy in here.

375
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,357
Look at that light.

376
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,109
That thing's been broken
for a couple of years.

377
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:38,486
It's driving me crazy.

378
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:40,905
City won't fix it or nothing.

379
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:43,699
What good is a light

380
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,285
that don't light, right?

381
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,747
Kind of funny, but it's stupid, too.

382
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,457
Hey.

383
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,043
I gotta take the fight.

384
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,175
Why?

385
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:03,260
These dudes killed my pops.

386
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:05,888
Now they're parading around,
talking shit?

387
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:07,598
I can't let that slide.

388
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,394
I'm the champ, right?

389
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,562
Yeah.

390
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,272
So I ain't got a choice.

391
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:16,357
Choice?

392
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:20,111
That's the same thing your father said,

393
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:22,363
and he died right here, in my hands.

394
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,366
Look what his choice
put your mother through.

395
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,411
You don't wanna really bring
all that stuff up again, do you, kid?

396
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:29,495
I thought you would get it.

397
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:33,374
If I don't take this fight,
I gotta live with it right now.

398
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:36,043
That kid was raised in hate,
you know what I'm talking about?

399
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,920
You weren't. Don't do it.

400
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,463
- But you did.
- It's different.

401
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:40,548
It was different?

402
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,217
It's a lot different.

403
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,805
I was supposed to be in there
with Drago that night

404
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,265
and not your father.

405
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:51,684
And I could've thrown in the towel,

406
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,728
but I didn't.

407
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:55,896
And I gotta live with that.

408
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,232
And when I did get in that ring,

409
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:01,402
that guy broke things in me

410
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,487
that ain't never been fixed.

411
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,492
It's not worth it.

412
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,287
Not at all.

413
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,332
Why do you wanna fight?

414
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,918
What are you talking about?
I just told you why.

415
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,128
No, you didn't, Donnie.

416
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,172
Why do you wanna fight?

417
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:24,550
I get why they wanna fight you.
I know what they're fighting for.

418
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,676
What about you?

419
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,638
Listen to me,
you got everything to lose.

420
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,140
He's got nothing to lose.

421
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,601
When a fighter ain't got
nothing to lose, he's dangerous.

422
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:34,810
I'm dangerous!

423
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:45,237
You think I'm gonna lose.

424
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,864
I didn't say that.

425
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,785
Same guy that said
he ain't have enough experience.

426
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,871
- Raw, right?
- Yeah.

427
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,083
But you don't think I could beat him.

428
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,668
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- No.

429
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:00,836
No, that's not what I'm saying.

430
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,130
I'm saying
I'm not gonna be here forever.

431
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:04,423
And what's that supposed to mean?

432
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:06,550
That means you gotta
do some smart thinking.

433
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:08,469
Oh, you wanna talk about
smart decisions, Rock?

434
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,680
You in this house all alone.

435
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,140
Who been taking care of you? Me.

436
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:14,934
I've been here for you!

437
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,728
Who else you got?

438
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:24,610
Listen.

439
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,572
I'm taking this fight
with or without you.

440
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,419
It's gotta be without.

441
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,755
I can't do it.

442
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:46,382
So that's it?

443
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:48,801
You walkin' out on me?

444
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,890
At least you ain't gotta worry about
throwing in the towel this time.

445
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,021
Yeah.

446
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:06,152
Yeah.

447
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,184
D, are you okay?

448
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:39,310
Rocky, man.

449
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,187
Rocky what?

450
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,646
He ain't training me for the fight.

451
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:46,275
Wait, you're taking the fight?

452
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,943
All the shit that we've been through.

453
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:50,237
He gonna leave me high and dry.
That's bullshit!

454
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,531
I took care of him when he had cancer.

455
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,074
He could've been dead, B.

456
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:55,743
I'm sure he has his reasons.

457
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:56,911
Oh, yeah? Like what?

458
00:33:58,329 --> 00:33:59,330
Like what?

459
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:04,919
I don't need him.

460
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:53,717
Yo.

461
00:34:58,681 --> 00:34:59,848
I love it.

462
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:01,517
Me, too.

463
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,895
I want just a little piece of that room
for a studio.

464
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:06,855
That works. It's all you.

465
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:09,858
What's wrong?

466
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:12,569
I don't know. Maybe I'm just
a little tired from the flight.

467
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:13,654
I'm okay.

468
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:14,863
We don't have to go out.

469
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,074
We can just stay in, order some food.

470
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,287
Hmm. No, baby, you have to tell her.

471
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,173
So, how's the music?

472
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:35,884
Oh, Donnie didn't tell you?

473
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,096
D?

474
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:41,724
Uh... I forgot.

475
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,935
Oh. Yeah, I signed.

476
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,021
Hello.

477
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,690
Yeah, it's great. The record label
really hit the ground running, too.

478
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,191
I'm up for festivals this summer.

479
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,111
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

480
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:03,912
So, how's Rocky?

481
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:06,623
He didn't wanna make the trip?

482
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:09,001
Nah, Ma, you know how he is

483
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,170
with the traveling.

484
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,100
Okay, Ma.

485
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,146
I'm sure you already guessed it, but...

486
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,230
Oh, yeah.

487
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:32,274
I already know.

488
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,571
All the salt,

489
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,240
shiny hair,

490
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,118
glowing skin.

491
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,164
How far along are you?

492
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:48,874
Mmm?

493
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:52,378
Ma, you think...

494
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,129
You think...

495
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:55,923
Uh-uh.

496
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,007
No.

497
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,426
We couldn't even... No.

498
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,928
Your mamma's got jokes, okay.

499
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,222
No, I'm not.

500
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,182
All right.

501
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:06,725
Mmm-mmm.

502
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,070
- What's it say?
- D, don't touch it.

503
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,114
No, I don't care if you peed on it.
I just want to see...

504
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:21,407
I don't want you to mess it up.

505
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,202
What's it say?

506
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,330
It's two blue lines.

507
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,543
Two blue lines? What does that mean?

508
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:34,420
Two blue lines.

509
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:41,176
Maybe it's broke.

510
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:54,898
That's crazy.

511
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:56,650
Mmm-hmm.

512
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,820
Hell, I don't know, D.

513
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,074
Baby, I don't know.

514
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:11,957
You did say
you always wanted kids, right?

515
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,333
Yeah, but I didn't say so soon.

516
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,005
I don't know if I'm...

517
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:21,592
If we are ready.

518
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:34,855
Let's get ready, then.

519
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,277
Yeah.

520
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,660
<i>Did she tell her family yet?</i>

521
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:52,414
She's, uh, on the phone
with her aunt right now.

522
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,500
Oh, that Bianca's a good one.

523
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:58,003
Why she agreed to marry you,
I do not know.

524
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,255
I don't know either.

525
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,595
Oh, it's good to have you home.

526
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:09,806
Ma, um...

527
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:14,686
That fight

528
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:18,065
between me

529
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,235
and Ivan Drago's son...

530
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:26,615
I'm gonna take it.

531
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:28,867
Okay.

532
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,081
That's it?

533
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,333
What else is there to say?

534
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,751
So, that doesn't bother you?

535
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,294
Oh, you think this doesn't bother me?

536
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,756
You're a grown man.

537
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,259
It doesn't matter
what I or anyone else thinks.

538
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,262
You wanna fight this man,
that's your business.

539
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,138
You don't need my blessings.

540
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:53,433
You clearly don't have Rocky's.

541
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,102
Rocky don't get it.

542
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:57,980
It wasn't his dad.

543
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,109
It changed my life.

544
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:03,902
Your life.

545
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:05,654
You're telling me you don't miss him?

546
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:06,738
Excuse me!

547
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:09,157
Do not try to make this about me.

548
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,368
And don't pretend
that it's about your father.

549
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,204
You became the world champion
without him.

550
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,123
Then why don't I feel like it?

551
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,378
If your father was here, he would
tell you he didn't feel like it either.

552
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:23,589
But he's not.

553
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:29,970
I just hope
you'll be here for your child.

554
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,395
Why are you so stupid?

555
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:43,567
Stop.

556
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,111
D, you're tickling me
with that fake beard.

557
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,613
The disrespect.

558
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:54,745
Why don't you sing for us?

559
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:57,039
No, I am not your jukebox.

560
00:40:57,497 --> 00:41:00,042
I'm not gonna be walking around here,
barefoot and pregnant,

561
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,126
making you sandwiches either.

562
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,463
Did you hear that?
No sandwiches, no singing.

563
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:07,966
Your mamma just hating on us.

564
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,426
Did you hear that?

565
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,973
What if the baby can't, D?

566
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:17,601
Can't what?

567
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,603
Can't hear.

568
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,608
You know it can be hereditary, right?

569
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:30,656
Mmm.

570
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,867
Everything is gonna be fine.

571
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,536
I promise.

572
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:02,521
<i>People are gonna
be all over this fight.</i>

573
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:06,149
It got a lot of bad history, man.

574
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:08,318
Everything.

575
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:09,778
Your dad.

576
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:11,113
And yours, too.

577
00:42:12,406 --> 00:42:13,782
Don't forget that he trained him.

578
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:17,911
I know why you didn't train me before.

579
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:19,329
I wasn't ready.

580
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,123
You was right.

581
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,166
Yeah, but this is different.

582
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,462
<i>Drago's kid...</i>

583
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:29,840
<i>Big.</i>

584
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:32,676
<i>Fast.</i>

585
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:34,177
Strong.

586
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:36,138
Unorthodox.

587
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,934
<i>He's a monster, boy.</i>

588
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,314
It's a balanced breakfast over there.

589
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,150
You think you ready for all that?

590
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:49,609
I gotta be.

591
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,282
But if you ain't gonna do it for me,

592
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:58,535
at least do it for them.

593
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:04,916
Think about it.

594
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,711
<i>Beat what they couldn't beat.</i>

595
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:10,922
<i>Change the way they were remembered.</i>

596
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:16,136
This is our chance to rewrite history.

597
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:22,100
<i>Our history.</i>

598
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,364
<i>His record might be light,
but, believe me,</i>

599
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:38,784
<i>he ain't no under card.</i>

600
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:41,036
So, you gotta be with me.

601
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:43,872
I'm right here.

602
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:48,835
We'll see.

603
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:56,134
We'll see.

604
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,919
<i>Creed versus Drago.</i>

605
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,921
<i>That means something.</i>

606
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:36,258
<i>Did that factor into your decision
to take this fight?</i>

607
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,593
I mean, you can't say Creed
without Drago, right?

608
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,303
This is what y'all want.

609
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,722
It's what everyone wants.

610
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:45,183
<i>Also, can't help but to notice,</i>

611
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:47,936
<i>who won't be in your corner
this time around.</i>

612
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:49,771
<i>Rocky's taking
some family time.</i>

613
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:51,439
<i>But Duke's got me.</i>

614
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,650
<i>His father taught my father
everything he knows.</i>

615
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,652
Speed, D.
That's how we gonna beat him.

616
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,946
<i>Technique, speed...</i>

617
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,365
<i>I'm confident he'll have me
ready for this fight.</i>

618
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:05,328
<i>And knowing what happened
between your father and Drago,</i>

619
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,664
<i>you must have some worry.</i>

620
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,624
What would I be afraid of?

621
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,003
I'm a fighter. This is what I do, right?

622
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,296
Who the champ?

623
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:15,797
It's who I am.

624
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:18,383
Looking good!

625
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:47,954
Creed! Creed! Creed!

626
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:05,805
You're much smaller than your father.

627
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:08,975
Don't you talk about my pop.

628
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:14,648
Hey, we could do this right here, bro.

629
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:15,732
- Step up here!
- D!

630
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,108
He can't help you no more!

631
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:18,818
You hear me?
He can't help behind that ring!

632
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:20,904
You stand there.
All you're doing is talking, homie.

633
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,699
Your pops can't protect you,
you feel me?

634
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:27,369
Don't talk about my father!
Don't turn your back on me!

635
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:29,079
You in my house, homie!

636
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:55,397
Make sure they hold them down.
We're in the dressing room.

637
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:01,945
<i>Jim Lampley here,
along with Roy Jones.</i>

638
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,239
<i>We're moments away
from tonight's main event.</i>

639
00:47:04,406 --> 00:47:06,950
<i>Jim, I would have never thought
in a million years</i>

640
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:09,828
I'd witness another
Creed versus Drago fight.

641
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:12,872
Well, get ready, Roy.
Drago makes his way to the ring.

642
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:15,583
His father leads the way
through the hostile crowd.

643
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:18,545
You can feel the energy.
I'm sure Creed does.

644
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:21,131
He has a big advantage
with the fans in his corner.

645
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:30,682
Stay focused. You're
at home, baby. Focus is the key.

646
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,851
Given Drago's size and style,

647
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:35,937
he'll look to use his power
to counter Creed's speed.

648
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:37,397
Remember why
we're here, man.

649
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:49,951
I'm the champ.

650
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,247
I'm the champ.

651
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,127
I'm the champ.

652
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:51,304
Adonis Creed making
a grand entrance tonight.

653
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:54,099
Like his father,
Creed is ever the showman,

654
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:55,642
and is energizing the crowd.

655
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:05,401
Creed is letting Drago know
exactly who this arena belongs to.

656
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,863
It all feels so Shakespearean.

657
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:14,369
Two sons, raised a world apart,
yet inexorably linked by tragedy.

658
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,625
Now, gentlemen,

659
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,836
I went over the rules
in the dressing room.

660
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:26,005
<i>I wanna caution you to keep
this fight clean at all times.</i>

661
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:27,841
<i>Protect yourself at all times.</i>

662
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,926
<i>And what I say, you must obey.</i>

663
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,387
Good luck. Touch gloves.

664
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:38,893
Touch gloves.

665
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:41,813
Creed fights without
longtime trainer Rocky Balboa.

666
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:44,149
Interesting to see
how Duke manages the corner

667
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:46,067
with so much bad blood
between the fighters.

668
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:47,443
Look at him.

669
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:49,279
He think he gonna run
straight through you.

670
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:50,655
- You show him what's up.
- Yeah.

671
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,824
This is your house, all right?

672
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:56,161
- It's my house.
- Let's go, baby.

673
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,755
Box!

674
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,549
And we're underway.

675
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:11,259
If all goes according to form,

676
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,887
Creed is seen as
the more versatile boxer, quicker...

677
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,180
Yeah, baby, throw that jab! Let it rip!

678
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:17,473
Drago is trying to land
something big.

679
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:19,058
Dig, dig.

680
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:20,268
Downstairs.

681
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:24,147
Creed connects
with a couple of body shots.

682
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:30,612
And a right hand upstairs for Creed.

683
00:50:30,904 --> 00:50:33,323
Drago hasn't thrown
a meaningful punch yet.

684
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:35,241
And another right hand for Creed.

685
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:41,206
Creed blocked that punch

686
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:43,458
and still it knocked him back
into the ropes.

687
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:44,667
Yeah, we good.

688
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:46,127
Creed doesn't like that, Jim.

689
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,963
Don't be stupid, kid. He's baiting you.

690
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:51,883
Creed pressing now, angrily rushes
forward with a volley of punches.

691
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:53,927
He's pulling you in.

692
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,222
A huge left hook by Drago!

693
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:59,015
- Come on, kid.
<i>- Creed shaken up by that punch.</i>

694
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:00,183
Clear your head.

695
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:01,601
Creed commands
the center of the ring,

696
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,519
but there's a hard body shot
to the ribs.

697
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:04,938
And another one on the other side.

698
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:06,856
What you doing, baby? What you doing, D?

699
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:12,028
And a right hand by Drago
that knocks Creed's head back.

700
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,239
Creed can feel the power
behind those punches.

701
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:16,157
And now Drago is on the attack.

702
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:17,700
Jab out, jab out, jab out.
Hands up, let's go!

703
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:19,911
Drago's stalking him
along the ropes.

704
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,247
Get off the ropes, D!

705
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,083
Out the corner!

706
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:28,878
No, D! Out the corner, out the corner!

707
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:37,470
Hard right hand by Drago,
and Creed is shaken

708
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:40,139
as the first round comes to a close.

709
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,850
I think most watching at home
are a little surprised

710
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:45,311
by how impressive Viktor Drago
has looked

711
00:51:45,395 --> 00:51:47,814
in these opening minutes of the fight.

712
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:51,776
<i>With the history these men share,</i>

713
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:53,736
<i>Duke may have his hands full
keeping Creed</i>

714
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,989
<i>from letting his emotions
get the best of him.</i>

715
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:57,532
What you doing, D?

716
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,450
- You need to stick with the game plan.
- I know, I know.

717
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:02,120
Stay off the line. Take your angles.
You ain't taking your angles.

718
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:03,288
I know!

719
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:05,999
If he throws you a left hook...
Come on, man, hold the phone on that.

720
00:52:06,082 --> 00:52:07,834
- You think I don't know that shit?
- Well, if you know it,

721
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:09,127
do it!

722
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:29,647
And now, as we prepare for
round two, this crowd is still buzzing

723
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:33,943
from the vicious rally that Drago
brought forth in the last minute

724
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:35,820
of round number one.

725
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:37,196
Come out smart.

726
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,115
Got Creed in serious trouble
as the round came to a close.

727
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:40,199
Box!

728
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:42,035
And now, round two begins.

729
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:46,080
And Drago comes out throwing,
wasting no time.

730
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,128
- Get off the ropes!
- And Creed is backed

731
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:55,340
into the ropes,
trying to avoid those power shots.

732
00:52:58,009 --> 00:52:59,093
Damn.

733
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:01,012
Things just got ugly fast.

734
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:07,977
And another hard right hand shot,
and Creed is in big trouble now.

735
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,396
Keep moving, Donnie.

736
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:17,820
A massive right hand
sends Creed reeling.

737
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:19,906
He tries to regain his footing.

738
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:21,532
Creed trying to answer back.

739
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:25,661
And now a huge hook sends Creed
flying through the ropes!

740
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:27,872
Come on, kid.

741
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:35,213
Two!

742
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,422
Three!

743
00:53:36,506 --> 00:53:37,548
Four!

744
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,634
Five! Six!

745
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:40,968
That's it, that's it, that's it.

746
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,178
Creed! Creed!

747
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:44,055
- You okay?
- Yeah.

748
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:47,809
Box!

749
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:48,893
Creed needs something

750
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,395
to try to turn this fight around.

751
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,564
Drago just keeps coming.

752
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,109
What a big rib shot!

753
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:57,652
Shit.

754
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,654
Those were two tremendous
right hands to the rib cage.

755
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:02,281
You could've heard that one
in the nosebleed seats.

756
00:54:09,831 --> 00:54:12,834
Creed clearly in pain,
as he finds a way to his feet.

757
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,293
Not ready to give up yet.

758
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,671
I don't know.
This is getting dangerous, Jim.

759
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,676
Okay! Come to me!

760
00:54:22,135 --> 00:54:24,011
And now,
Bayless is gonna let him go again.

761
00:54:24,095 --> 00:54:25,096
Ready?

762
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,681
Box!

763
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,517
He comes barreling
out of the corner.

764
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,144
Huge right hook!

765
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,812
Drago trying to end it.

766
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,232
And Creed delivers a big right hand
at the bell.

767
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:37,692
Get back!
Get back to your corner!

768
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:40,153
Bayless restraining Drago,
seemingly frustrated...

769
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:41,279
Obey my commands.

770
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:43,448
...as he was close
to finishing the fight.

771
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:47,201
You got to show me something.
If not, I'm gonna stop it.

772
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:51,539
Can you fight?

773
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,291
Oh, I'm good, I'm good.

774
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:55,835
Hell no. I'm calling this fight.

775
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:57,086
Nigga, don't call this shit.

776
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:59,088
You ain't got to prove shit to nobody.

777
00:54:59,172 --> 00:55:01,299
Look at you.
Your ribs look like they broke.

778
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,886
You can't call this fight.

779
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:27,116
Hand me my mouthpiece.

780
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:31,913
My mouthpiece.

781
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:43,466
Don't do it.

782
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,511
Now, as we go to round three,

783
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:49,263
Adonis Creed has been beaten up
and bloodied

784
00:55:49,347 --> 00:55:51,682
by an avalanche of power shots

785
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:53,976
from Viktor Drago
in the first two rounds.

786
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:56,854
And we'll see how much
Adonis Creed has left now,

787
00:55:56,938 --> 00:55:58,314
as he tries to stay alive in the fight.

788
00:55:58,397 --> 00:55:59,941
Stop the fight.

789
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,776
Dangerous swings from Drago

790
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,487
as Creed desperately tries
to hold him off.

791
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,864
Drago's still putting
huge pressure on the body.

792
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,408
Come on, stop the fight!

793
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:13,871
And another shot by Drago!
Creed seemingly on his last legs!

794
00:56:13,955 --> 00:56:15,581
- Drago on the attack.
- Come on, D!

795
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:20,795
Oh, and with a devastating shot
to the rib cage.

796
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,004
Stop! Stop!

797
00:56:57,582 --> 00:57:01,085
This is an obvious
disqualification, or so it would appear

798
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:03,129
because Creed was fully down

799
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:05,256
at the moment
that Drago landed that last shot.

800
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,841
- No!
- You wanna kill somebody?

801
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,259
- No way, baby. No!
- Easy, easy!

802
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:10,928
- No. No, no, no!
- Come on.

803
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:12,888
No! Just relax.

804
00:57:29,322 --> 00:57:31,449
<i>This arena is completely silent</i>

805
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:34,035
<i>as the audience waits to see</i>

806
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:37,788
<i>what will be the condition
of young Adonis Creed.</i>

807
00:57:59,352 --> 00:58:03,272
Cracked orbital bone,
two cracked ribs, grade-3 concussion,

808
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:06,025
ruptured kidney, numerous contusions.

809
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,526
Oh...

810
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:09,862
A ruptured kidney, is that--

811
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,697
His injuries will heal
with rest and time,

812
00:58:11,781 --> 00:58:12,823
including the kidney.

813
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:15,242
Now, we shouldn't have
to resort to surgery,

814
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:17,787
but we will need to keep him here
for at least 48 hours, as a precaution.

815
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:22,041
Now he's still numb from the morphine,
but he'll certainly feel it later.

816
00:58:22,792 --> 00:58:24,710
- Okay.
- You okay?

817
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:27,296
Fine, I just gotta sit.

818
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,217
If you're expecting...

819
00:58:31,384 --> 00:58:32,385
No, I'm fine.

820
00:58:32,468 --> 00:58:35,721
No, no, seriously. Take it easy, okay?

821
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:38,808
Excuse me, Dr. Ewell.

822
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:42,436
You have a visitor. Right this way.

823
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:51,696
Bianca.

824
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:53,656
Listen, I'm so sorry everything went...

825
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,574
I should've been there.

826
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:57,910
I'm so sorry.

827
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:00,496
I am.

828
00:59:00,663 --> 00:59:01,789
Me, too.

829
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,624
Is it okay if I see him?

830
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:08,754
What difference do it make
to us? We saw what happened.

831
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:10,339
They doing what they supposed
to be doing.

832
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,758
I don't care.

833
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:15,302
Right. Okay.

834
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:16,721
Got it.

835
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:29,316
WBC's not gonna contest
the referee's decision,

836
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:33,237
so Viktor remains disqualified.

837
00:59:34,864 --> 00:59:35,865
Bottom line,

838
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:38,701
you still the champ.

839
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:41,871
I'm gonna let you rest, man.

840
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:45,166
So, if you need something,
you know, I'm outside.

841
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:55,009
Got some company, D.

842
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,070
You did good.

843
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:16,655
We tried.

844
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,669
You know,
I watched you back in Philadelphia.

845
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:35,007
You showed a ton of heart.
I mean, there's no doubt about it.

846
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:37,092
- Showed a ton of heart.
- Heart?

847
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,347
Man, I ain't trying to hear that shit.

848
01:00:41,514 --> 01:00:43,641
D. It's Rock.

849
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:47,061
- Oh, it's okay. It's all right.
- No, you guys gotta work it out.

850
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:50,564
I lost the fight
before it even started, right?

851
01:00:51,524 --> 01:00:54,360
No. No, no.

852
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:57,613
This guy was...
He's a big guy, he's strong.

853
01:00:57,696 --> 01:00:59,448
He got the reach on you.
He got all kinds of--

854
01:00:59,532 --> 01:01:01,158
Oh, now you're trying to train me?

855
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,704
Be my coach?

856
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,125
No, look at me.

857
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:13,754
Look at me.

858
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,511
What are you still doing here?

859
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:24,765
Here to pick up the pieces?

860
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:26,267
No.

861
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,187
Shouldn't you be in Philly?

862
01:01:30,813 --> 01:01:32,439
- Adonis.
- No, it's okay.

863
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:36,151
I don't want him to get all...

864
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:40,239
Take care of each other.

865
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:43,909
I'm sorry.

866
01:01:58,382 --> 01:01:59,758
Baby.

867
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:05,431
He loves you, D.

868
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:10,269
Look at me.

869
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,315
I'm looking right at you, babe.

870
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:17,526
How's that baby gonna look at me?

871
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:14,375
Adonis, do you really
feel like a champ?

872
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:16,669
Do you think you deserve
to keep the belt?

873
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:18,170
Why would you take
that fight, Adonis?

874
01:03:18,337 --> 01:03:20,047
Is this it for Adonis Creed?

875
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:33,727
I'm cool. I'm cool.

876
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:36,897
- D, please, let me help you, baby.
- I said I can walk.

877
01:03:40,401 --> 01:03:42,277
- Please sit--
- I said I got it.

878
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,663
I don't know.
Lately, it's like...

879
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:38,459
He hasn't really been himself.

880
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:41,378
And I get it.

881
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:44,214
'Cause he's going through a lot.

882
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:47,968
<i>He's just starting physical therapy.</i>

883
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,721
<i>Trying to get himself right.</i>

884
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:52,806
<i>And</i>

885
01:04:54,183 --> 01:04:55,517
<i>he's, uh...</i>

886
01:04:56,477 --> 01:04:57,603
<i>distant</i>

887
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:01,774
<i>and disconnected.</i>

888
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,944
It's like nothing really matters
to him right now.

889
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:08,280
Including me.

890
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:10,699
Which is new.

891
01:05:13,869 --> 01:05:14,953
<i>Yeah.</i>

892
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:20,375
<i>Listen, be there for him,
take care of him,</i>

893
01:05:21,502 --> 01:05:23,337
<i>give him your love.</i>

894
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:26,715
<i>But also, you gotta realize
he's in a place right now</i>

895
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,675
<i>that only he can get himself out of.</i>

896
01:05:28,884 --> 01:05:30,344
And with everything he's going through--

897
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:31,804
With everything
he's going through?

898
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:34,264
You've been in his corner
every step of the way.

899
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:38,727
<i>He's a grown man.</i>

900
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:44,900
<i>He's gotta heal from the inside out.</i>

901
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:47,945
Trust me, I know. I've been there.

902
01:05:48,654 --> 01:05:49,822
Mmm.

903
01:06:34,158 --> 01:06:35,409
Feel her?

904
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:37,995
Yeah.

905
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:41,832
<i>Highlights of Dr ago
silencing critics tonight</i>

906
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,668
<i>with a devastating
first round knockout of Anthony Novak.</i>

907
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:47,212
<i>Here's a post-fight interview
with Max Kellerman.</i>

908
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:51,008
<i>Viktor, here we are just months since
your controversial loss to Adonis Creed.</i>

909
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:52,676
<i>How does this win feel?</i>

910
01:06:52,885 --> 01:06:53,969
<i>What loss?</i>

911
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:55,804
<i>Excuse me.</i>

912
01:06:55,888 --> 01:06:58,432
<i>From your disqualification
to Adonis Creed.</i>

913
01:06:58,557 --> 01:07:00,684
<i>But how does this feel to you tonight?</i>

914
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:04,021
<i>I don't care. Creed must fight me.</i>

915
01:07:04,188 --> 01:07:07,357
- <i>And if he doesn't fight you?</i>
<i>- Then he's no champion.</i>

916
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:11,236
<i>There you have it, Adonis.
Challenge is on the table.</i>

917
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:09,563
Viktor!

918
01:10:09,081 --> 01:10:10,082
What's good?

919
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:12,793
Just maintaining, man.
Long time no see, what's up?

920
01:10:13,168 --> 01:10:18,090
Nothing, man. Just been caught up.
You know, the house, the baby.

921
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:19,591
You know how it is.

922
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,009
Yeah? How Bianca doing?

923
01:10:21,843 --> 01:10:24,221
She's good. She's good.

924
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,306
Good, good, good.

925
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:30,268
Listen, man, I've been meaning
to hit you up, though.

926
01:10:31,395 --> 01:10:33,605
Commissioner wanna know
who we plan to fight next.

927
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:36,108
You ain't gotta fight Drago,

928
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:38,402
but you gotta fight someone.

929
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,654
You gotta defend the belt.

930
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,698
Otherwise, it's gonna be vacated.

931
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:49,454
I could set up a little,
you know, tune-up fight, kind of.

932
01:10:56,378 --> 01:10:57,379
No. You know what, man?

933
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:58,588
Don't worry about
none of that right now.

934
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:01,216
Listen, just come on inside.

935
01:11:01,425 --> 01:11:03,385
Hit the bag, man, warm up.

936
01:11:04,428 --> 01:11:05,720
Yeah.

937
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:09,015
Yeah, I'm gonna grab my stuff,
and I'm gonna meet you in there.

938
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:13,270
All right, man.

939
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:25,198
Put your body weight into that glove.

940
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:27,200
There you go. Lean in it.

941
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,465
Yeah, I called you,
like, a thousand times.

942
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,509
Yeah, it's about the light.

943
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:46,803
How long?

944
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:49,347
You want to be specific? Couple years.

945
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:50,599
Yeah.

946
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:53,560
I mean, how many guys does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

947
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:56,980
I'm not joking.

948
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,317
Can I call you guys back?

949
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,027
Yeah.

950
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:18,418
Wow.

951
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:42,859
Hey, Ma.

952
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:46,029
Ma.

953
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:00,752
Hey, Ma.

954
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:05,966
How you doing, kid?

955
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:09,135
What are you doing here?

956
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:10,595
I hope you don't mind,

957
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:14,307
your mom asked if I would come out
'cause she's worried about you.

958
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:18,812
I am, too.

959
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:20,814
I'm good.

960
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,859
You didn't have to come all this way.

961
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:26,194
By train.

962
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,573
Three days on a train.

963
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,034
It's all right, you know,
gives you time to think.

964
01:13:33,201 --> 01:13:37,539
And you watch all these places
whipping by the windows like postcards.

965
01:13:37,706 --> 01:13:39,499
It's quite an experience.

966
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:41,835
Yeah, I mean, if you say so.

967
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:43,587
Yeah, it was nice.

968
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,381
This is wonderful.

969
01:13:46,548 --> 01:13:49,759
How you have all this out here.

970
01:13:50,844 --> 01:13:52,679
You could have the same.

971
01:13:53,597 --> 01:13:55,348
Yeah, I wouldn't say that.

972
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:58,101
I mean, not just the shiny stuff,

973
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:00,353
but the better stuff.

974
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:03,815
Have a better life.

975
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:09,279
Be a better man.

976
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:14,868
You know, I was thinking about
what you were saying about

977
01:14:14,993 --> 01:14:18,580
what smart decisions have I made lately.

978
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:24,127
Couldn't think of many.

979
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:29,966
You know, I wasn't even there
when my son's son,

980
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:33,303
my grandson,

981
01:14:34,054 --> 01:14:35,263
was born.

982
01:14:36,306 --> 01:14:40,560
I mean, he's like
that tall now probably.

983
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:43,396
I don't even know him.
He doesn't know me.

984
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,401
It's pathetic.

985
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:51,446
Well, why won't you just

986
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:54,199
call him?

987
01:14:55,283 --> 01:14:57,494
It ain't that easy, you know...

988
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:00,997
Listen,

989
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:04,668
I don't want you making
the same mistakes I made.

990
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:07,212
You know what I mean?

991
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:12,008
So, you gotta ask yourself,

992
01:15:13,051 --> 01:15:15,136
what's the valuable stuff?

993
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,931
It's like I asked you before.

994
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:21,351
What were you really fighting for?

995
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:24,979
I was afraid.

996
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,734
Of this.

997
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:34,698
Expectations.

998
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,200
Being the champ.

999
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:42,706
I was scared I couldn't do
what he couldn't.

1000
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,501
It's weird.

1001
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,131
I used to feel like he was a part of me.

1002
01:15:52,716 --> 01:15:54,926
Now I can't hear him, or that thing,

1003
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:57,846
that thing that tells me
to get in the ring.

1004
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,932
Move my feet, keep my hands up.

1005
01:16:01,099 --> 01:16:03,268
Hit anything that gets in my way.

1006
01:16:07,731 --> 01:16:09,524
I can't hear it anymore.

1007
01:16:17,532 --> 01:16:19,617
I don't even know how I lost.

1008
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:21,745
Your mind wasn't right.

1009
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:28,168
And your natural style just won't work
with a guy that big.

1010
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:38,511
You saying yours was better?

1011
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,181
I won, didn't I?

1012
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:50,857
- Good seeing you, Unc.
- Great to see you, too.

1013
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:53,026
I was talking with your mother,

1014
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:58,490
and she says you came up
with this name for the child.

1015
01:16:58,656 --> 01:16:59,866
- Amara.
- Amara.

1016
01:16:59,991 --> 01:17:01,034
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1017
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:02,285
Why, what's wrong with that?

1018
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:05,413
No, it's a beautiful name,
but it's kind of complicated.

1019
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:07,040
Why don't you think about something,

1020
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,292
at least I would,
a little simpler to say,

1021
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:12,629
like "Becky" or "Cate,"
something like that.

1022
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:13,838
Cate Creed?

1023
01:17:13,922 --> 01:17:15,924
Cate Creed. Two "C's." Easy to remember.

1024
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:17,717
You do know she's gonna be black, right?

1025
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:19,928
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

1026
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:22,597
Okay.

1027
01:17:23,515 --> 01:17:25,350
- Hey, Ma.
- Yeah.

1028
01:17:27,227 --> 01:17:28,645
Wait, right now?

1029
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:31,940
- Relax.
- Okay.

1030
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:34,067
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- Mmm-hmm.

1031
01:17:34,901 --> 01:17:37,612
You just gotta be there for her,
okay? That's your job.

1032
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:38,780
I got you, I got you.

1033
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:40,323
- And remember--
- Yeah.

1034
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:43,284
Today is gonna be the best day
of your life. Right here.

1035
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,912
- All right?
- Yeah.

1036
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:49,415
Best day of your life.

1037
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:53,002
- I'm having a baby.
- I feel like I'm having a baby.

1038
01:17:56,089 --> 01:17:57,590
- Boy!
- Hey.

1039
01:17:57,757 --> 01:17:59,175
- What you doing?
- I know--

1040
01:17:59,259 --> 01:18:01,427
No, never mind. Just get in here.

1041
01:18:01,511 --> 01:18:02,720
Okay. Okay, okay.

1042
01:18:02,804 --> 01:18:05,098
Like I said,
I'll be here if you need me.

1043
01:18:06,391 --> 01:18:08,643
- All right.
- All right.

1044
01:18:12,522 --> 01:18:14,440
You know, I'm gonna do what I can.

1045
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:18,695
You being here is more than enough.

1046
01:18:18,862 --> 01:18:20,154
Thank you.

1047
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:12,123
Mr. Balboa?

1048
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:14,375
- Mmm.
- She's here.

1049
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:16,669
Oh, that's great.

1050
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:22,592
That's absolutely good.

1051
01:19:23,176 --> 01:19:24,761
That's fantastic.

1052
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:32,977
Yo!

1053
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:36,481
Hey, Unc, say hi to your goddaughter.

1054
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:38,858
Wow. That's quite an honor.

1055
01:19:40,652 --> 01:19:42,195
- Let me see you.
- Here she is.

1056
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:45,990
Hey, hello, beautiful.

1057
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,284
So, nurse...

1058
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:49,535
Hmm?

1059
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:53,623
...what about the test?

1060
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:56,918
Relax for now.

1061
01:19:57,001 --> 01:20:00,797
We'll run an auditory exam
as soon as you and Amara get some rest.

1062
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:04,926
It's okay, babe.

1063
01:20:06,094 --> 01:20:08,304
Thank God she looks like you.

1064
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:09,806
Yeah, right.

1065
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:17,271
So, is she gonna feel anything?

1066
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,024
No, it's painless. I promise.

1067
01:20:20,984 --> 01:20:22,860
Okay. Now that they're in place,

1068
01:20:22,944 --> 01:20:25,571
what we're gonna do
is give her a series of click stimuli

1069
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:27,198
around 35 decibels

1070
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:29,367
and check her neural responses.

1071
01:20:29,492 --> 01:20:30,702
Is that loud?

1072
01:20:31,202 --> 01:20:32,787
Normal auditory range.

1073
01:20:34,998 --> 01:20:36,082
Okay.

1074
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:37,959
Here we go.

1075
01:20:40,211 --> 01:20:42,338
So what exactly are we looking for?

1076
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,257
A reading. Spikes.

1077
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:18,833
So, we're not seeing
any waves or spikes, uh,

1078
01:21:20,293 --> 01:21:22,837
and given your family history,
there is some cause for concern.

1079
01:21:23,004 --> 01:21:25,131
However, it is very early...

1080
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:53,576
<i>They're gonna run
some more tests.</i>

1081
01:21:54,202 --> 01:21:58,414
They said it's early, and,
uh, sometimes they get false reads.

1082
01:22:03,044 --> 01:22:04,879
Let me ask you something.

1083
01:22:07,173 --> 01:22:09,133
What if it ain't okay?

1084
01:22:10,551 --> 01:22:11,761
I can't think like that.

1085
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:15,306
You gotta, I mean,

1086
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:18,518
how you gonna handle it?

1087
01:22:19,477 --> 01:22:20,561
Hmm?

1088
01:22:25,191 --> 01:22:26,526
I don't wanna go there.

1089
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:28,653
You gonna love her?

1090
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:32,240
How you gonna ask me
a question like that, Rock?

1091
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:34,492
- Yeah, I'm gonna love her.
- Good.

1092
01:22:34,659 --> 01:22:37,453
'Cause she ain't feeling sorry
for herself,

1093
01:22:38,496 --> 01:22:39,914
and you shouldn't either.

1094
01:22:49,674 --> 01:22:52,135
You got a little...

1095
01:22:54,262 --> 01:22:56,139
Oh, it's boxing gloves.

1096
01:22:57,598 --> 01:22:58,933
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1097
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,444
<i>Goodnight Moon.</i>
I love that book.

1098
01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:12,655
Who's that from, babe?

1099
01:23:15,116 --> 01:23:17,785
<i>The unanimous
number one contender Viktor Drago</i>

1100
01:23:17,869 --> 01:23:20,079
<i>has been met with open arms
back in Russia,</i>

1101
01:23:20,163 --> 01:23:22,165
<i>his father's home, which is nice.</i>

1102
01:23:22,248 --> 01:23:25,626
<i>But the question on everyone's mind is,
"Where is Creed?"</i>

1103
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:29,505
<i>If he doesn't choose an opponent soon,
he risks forfeiting the title</i>

1104
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:32,884
<i>and personally, I can't imagine him
being able to live with that.</i>

1105
01:23:35,428 --> 01:23:36,762
You good?

1106
01:23:37,597 --> 01:23:40,308
Yeah. Finally got her to settle.

1107
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:44,187
Hey, I need to get out of the house.

1108
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:47,064
I was gonna go over to the studio.

1109
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,650
You mind watching her until I get back?

1110
01:23:50,318 --> 01:23:52,361
Yeah, of course.

1111
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:54,197
Cool.

1112
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:57,533
Okay, okay.

1113
01:23:58,242 --> 01:23:59,243
Yeah.

1114
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:09,337
You okay?

1115
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:11,797
Yeah, I got it. Yeah.

1116
01:24:12,924 --> 01:24:14,258
Okay.

1117
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:16,636
Bye.

1118
01:24:29,357 --> 01:24:30,524
Hey.

1119
01:24:34,654 --> 01:24:35,738
Baby.

1120
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:38,157
Baby, please.

1121
01:24:38,324 --> 01:24:40,910
Hey, you hungry, right?
Hey, baby, you hungry?

1122
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:52,046
<i>It's Mary Anne.
Please leave a message.</i>

1123
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:54,298
Hey, Ma. Listen, listen.

1124
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:57,051
She won't stop crying.
Can you just tell me how to...

1125
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:59,011
Can you tell me how to
make her stop crying?

1126
01:24:59,095 --> 01:25:01,222
Call me back
when you get this message, okay?

1127
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:35,715
Hey, what's up, baby girl?

1128
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:38,009
Hey, no.

1129
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:40,219
It's okay, baby. No, no.

1130
01:25:40,303 --> 01:25:42,596
No, don't cry. No, not again, please.

1131
01:25:43,264 --> 01:25:44,348
Please.

1132
01:25:44,432 --> 01:25:46,183
No, look, look, look.

1133
01:25:47,685 --> 01:25:48,936
You see that?

1134
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:50,479
Look, look, look.

1135
01:25:51,856 --> 01:25:52,898
Look.

1136
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:09,373
I'm right here.

1137
01:26:59,173 --> 01:27:00,299
I'm sorry.

1138
01:27:02,009 --> 01:27:03,302
I'm sorry.

1139
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:05,346
I'm sorry.

1140
01:27:07,932 --> 01:27:10,393
Hey. No, no, there you go.

1141
01:27:11,435 --> 01:27:12,853
Hey.

1142
01:27:12,937 --> 01:27:14,063
I know.

1143
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:18,776
Mmm-hmm. Daddy's being a bitch, I know.

1144
01:27:39,672 --> 01:27:40,840
Hi.

1145
01:27:42,383 --> 01:27:43,926
How'd you do?

1146
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:50,599
She's a fighter.

1147
01:27:54,145 --> 01:27:55,855
Just like her dad.

1148
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,193
Just like her mom, too.

1149
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,872
I have to fight him again.

1150
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:16,834
I don't wanna be that person
to stop you.

1151
01:28:17,585 --> 01:28:20,337
But I don't wanna end up
like your mom, alone.

1152
01:28:21,672 --> 01:28:22,798
I feel you.

1153
01:28:22,882 --> 01:28:23,883
Do you?

1154
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,804
And it's not just us anymore, D.

1155
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:33,184
I know it sounds crazy
doing all this all over again.

1156
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:37,563
But this won't be the end of me.

1157
01:28:38,022 --> 01:28:39,023
Or you.

1158
01:28:40,024 --> 01:28:41,775
It can't be, 'cause we a team.

1159
01:28:41,859 --> 01:28:44,278
We weren't a team
when you took the fight the last time.

1160
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:49,241
You right.

1161
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:51,494
I'm sorry.

1162
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:56,624
I shouldn't have put you through that.

1163
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,209
Then why?

1164
01:28:59,043 --> 01:29:00,503
Why do it again?

1165
01:29:02,421 --> 01:29:04,006
What do you have to prove?

1166
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:05,174
It's not about that.

1167
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:10,095
You wouldn't be any good to anybody
if you didn't do what you love.

1168
01:29:12,014 --> 01:29:14,058
You wouldn't be able to breathe, right?

1169
01:29:15,518 --> 01:29:19,146
Well, I wouldn't be any good to anybody
if I don't handle this the right way.

1170
01:29:23,776 --> 01:29:25,277
But I need you.

1171
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:28,489
Both of you.

1172
01:29:37,748 --> 01:29:39,083
I'll beat him.

1173
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:47,550
You better.

1174
01:29:50,928 --> 01:29:53,347
You gotta think
about this real hard.

1175
01:29:54,932 --> 01:29:56,934
You got people that need you now.

1176
01:29:57,685 --> 01:29:59,395
That's exactly why I can't lose.

1177
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:02,231
Buddy said the fight
has to be in Russia.

1178
01:30:03,065 --> 01:30:04,108
Take it or leave it.

1179
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:10,656
Russia?

1180
01:30:10,823 --> 01:30:12,074
On their turf.

1181
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:14,034
So Russia it is.

1182
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,751
What you think, Rock?

1183
01:30:24,253 --> 01:30:27,089
It's a clear advantage
if it comes down to a judge's decision.

1184
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:32,219
Well, then we can't let it
get to a judge's decision, right?

1185
01:30:35,014 --> 01:30:37,433
Oh, shit.

1186
01:30:39,518 --> 01:30:40,603
Call the promoter.

1187
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:47,985
So we train here tomorrow, 5:00 a.m.

1188
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:51,071
No, I got other plans.

1189
01:30:51,572 --> 01:30:53,949
- You mean, you wanna go to Philly?
- No.

1190
01:30:54,283 --> 01:30:56,869
Listen, you wanna change things
in a big way,

1191
01:30:57,369 --> 01:30:59,413
then you need to make some big changes.

1192
01:31:55,094 --> 01:31:56,970
You gotta be
messing with me, right?

1193
01:31:58,555 --> 01:32:00,849
Heard this is a place where fighters go,

1194
01:32:01,934 --> 01:32:03,435
you know, to start over.

1195
01:32:03,977 --> 01:32:05,312
Get reborn.

1196
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:10,818
What took y'all so long?

1197
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:12,736
This some wild shit.

1198
01:32:12,986 --> 01:32:15,739
Yeah, sure looks like hell to me.

1199
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:19,326
Since you're going back to hell,
you might as well get used to it.

1200
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:23,455
Let's go.

1201
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:37,803
Go for it.

1202
01:32:42,975 --> 01:32:43,976
Harder.

1203
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:46,729
Harder.

1204
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:48,188
Harder!

1205
01:32:50,733 --> 01:32:51,817
Keep going.

1206
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:08,250
Build that neck.

1207
01:33:31,398 --> 01:33:32,566
Okay, man up.

1208
01:33:33,567 --> 01:33:34,693
No.

1209
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:36,737
I'm good.

1210
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:43,660
That's the fight it's gonna be.
Toe-to-toe. Get used to it.

1211
01:33:45,412 --> 01:33:46,622
Box!

1212
01:33:47,206 --> 01:33:48,457
Take it to the body.

1213
01:34:01,553 --> 01:34:02,930
Take it! Fight the pain.

1214
01:34:04,807 --> 01:34:05,933
You all right?

1215
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:31,667
Get back in there.

1216
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:34,294
Get back in there. Protect yourself.

1217
01:35:34,688 --> 01:35:36,356
Come on, get up, kid.

1218
01:35:37,024 --> 01:35:38,233
Get up.

1219
01:35:42,029 --> 01:35:43,155
Keep moving.

1220
01:35:45,741 --> 01:35:47,034
That's it.

1221
01:37:52,743 --> 01:37:54,494
<i>We're just minutes away
from the fight</i>

1222
01:37:54,578 --> 01:37:56,371
<i>the whole world has been waiting to see.</i>

1223
01:37:56,455 --> 01:37:59,791
The rematch between
Adonis Creed and Viktor Drago

1224
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:02,085
for the heavyweight championship
of the world.

1225
01:38:02,169 --> 01:38:03,879
<i>The unique thing
about this fight, Jim,</i>

1226
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:09,509
<i>is Adonis Creed comes in
a 25-to-1 underdog,</i>

1227
01:38:09,593 --> 01:38:10,969
<i>and he's the champ!</i>

1228
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:13,263
<i>Well, it's gonna be
fascinating to see</i>

1229
01:38:13,346 --> 01:38:16,725
<i>what that does to Creed's mindset
as he enters the ring.</i>

1230
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:18,477
<i>Not to mention Drago's.</i>

1231
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:26,443
Drago! Drago! Drago!

1232
01:39:13,782 --> 01:39:15,575
And there he is.

1233
01:39:15,659 --> 01:39:19,579
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Drago!
Making his way into the arena.

1234
01:39:19,663 --> 01:39:23,375
He does not have the belt,
but to everyone here in Russia

1235
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,127
and to many around the world,

1236
01:39:25,210 --> 01:39:27,462
he is the true heavyweight champion.

1237
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:06,459
It's time, kid.

1238
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:17,596
There was no way Creed
could have run from this fight.

1239
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:21,183
There was such high demand for Adonis
to step back in the ring with Viktor.

1240
01:40:21,308 --> 01:40:25,812
And I'm sure Ivan feels good
to be back home after all these years.

01:42:10,125 --> 01:42:11,668
Come on up, champ.

1260
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:19,092
This is it, Jim.
Creed versus Drago part two.

1261
01:42:19,175 --> 01:42:20,677
Creed looks good tonight,

1262
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:23,471
but it's impossible to forget
what happened to him

1263
01:42:23,555 --> 01:42:26,141
the last time he stepped into the ring
with Drago.

1264
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:30,228
Numerous injuries, not least of all,
a nasty broken rib

1265
01:42:30,312 --> 01:42:32,063
and a ruptured kidney.

1266
01:42:32,147 --> 01:42:33,898
A huge difference in this fight

1267
01:42:33,982 --> 01:42:37,902
is he's got former champ Rocky Balboa
back in his corner.

1268
01:42:37,986 --> 01:42:39,654
And Rocky assures everyone

1269
01:42:39,738 --> 01:42:42,574
this fight will be very different
from its predecessor.

1270
01:42:46,161 --> 01:42:50,498
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen. This is it.

1271
01:42:50,999 --> 01:42:53,335
Twelve rounds of boxing

1272
01:42:53,418 --> 01:42:57,505
for the heavyweight championship
of the world!

1273
01:42:58,131 --> 01:42:59,758
Ladies and gentlemen,

1274
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:02,844
let's get ready to rumble!

1275
01:43:06,473 --> 01:43:10,101
You can feel the nervous energy
in the arena tonight, Jim.

1276
01:43:10,185 --> 01:43:12,771
Creed has some courage
to get back into the ring

1277
01:43:12,854 --> 01:43:14,898
with a man who nearly ended his career.

1278
01:43:14,981 --> 01:43:18,109
A man who is hungry to be champ.

1279
01:43:24,282 --> 01:43:25,325
Fighters,

1280
01:43:26,743 --> 01:43:28,620
I want good, clean fight.

1281
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:33,041
Break when I tell you to break.

1282
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:35,960
You go to your corner
when I tell you to go to your corner.

1283
01:43:42,467 --> 01:43:43,468
Touch gloves.

1284
01:43:43,802 --> 01:43:47,222
Rocky Balboa and Ivan Drago
sharing the ring

1285
01:43:47,305 --> 01:43:49,224
for the first time in 30 years.

1286
01:43:49,391 --> 01:43:53,937
if anyone knows how to take on
a slugger like Drago, it would be Rocky.

1287
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:56,481
You know you got
the fire in your gut,

1288
01:43:56,981 --> 01:43:59,984
and I know you'll do
what needs to be done.

1289
01:44:00,485 --> 01:44:04,614
Because now,
you know what you're fighting for.

1290
01:44:09,077 --> 01:44:12,539
Viktor overwhelmed
Creed's previous game plan,

1291
01:44:12,622 --> 01:44:13,873
and I think it got in Adonis' head.

1292
01:44:15,625 --> 01:44:18,586
It's gonna be interesting to see
how Rocky Balboa has prepared Creed

1293
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:21,673
for what is surely to become
an all-out brawl.

1294
01:44:21,756 --> 01:44:23,007
Ready?

1295
01:44:23,633 --> 01:44:25,009
Ready?

1296
01:44:25,635 --> 01:44:26,886
Box.

1297
01:44:26,970 --> 01:44:28,012
And we're underway.

1298
01:44:28,555 --> 01:44:32,350
Drago comes out swinging
with two hooks that Creed avoids.

1299
01:44:32,809 --> 01:44:34,894
And a big right-hand
right out of the gate.

1300
01:44:34,978 --> 01:44:36,312
Watch that right, Donnie.

1301
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:39,983
Drago a bit surprised
as Creed shakes that punch off.

1302
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:48,741
Drago is pressing hard,
but Creed is not backing off.

1303
01:44:50,201 --> 01:44:51,494
Keep moving, keep moving.

1304
01:44:51,578 --> 01:44:54,205
Creed working a little bit closer
to Drago tonight.

1305
01:44:57,542 --> 01:45:00,420
That is a vicious combination
by Creed.

1306
01:45:04,257 --> 01:45:06,593
And now a right hand by Drago.

1307
01:45:06,676 --> 01:45:09,554
Here we go,
Drago applying pressure.

1308
01:45:09,721 --> 01:45:10,930
- Out the corner!
- Come on, Donnie!

1309
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:15,477
Creed manages to slip away.

1310
01:45:16,978 --> 01:45:17,979
Let's get it.

1311
01:45:20,023 --> 01:45:21,774
Yeah, what's up?

1312
01:45:21,858 --> 01:45:24,652
Now they're squaring off
in the middle of the ring, toe-to-toe.

1313
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:26,029
Taking blows.

1314
01:45:26,112 --> 01:45:27,614
Creed staying in his face.

1315
01:45:27,697 --> 01:45:30,074
And there's the bell!
As a wild first round comes to an end.

1316
01:45:30,158 --> 01:45:31,284
Go to your corner.

1317
01:45:31,659 --> 01:45:34,078
Drago frustrated. Creed is looking
like a different fighter tonight, Max.

1318
01:45:34,162 --> 01:45:36,122
- That's it, D! That's it!
- Yes!

1319
01:45:36,456 --> 01:45:38,541
Oh, yeah, who's saying Drago
now, though?

1320
01:45:40,877 --> 01:45:42,587
See, all that work in the desert
paid off, right?

1321
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:44,214
Yeah, you got him. You got him thinking.

1322
01:45:44,297 --> 01:45:45,715
He wasn't expecting
what you're bringing.

1323
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:48,510
Now, he's gonna bring the heat
the next round, but you're ready for it.

1324
01:45:53,389 --> 01:45:55,183
He overextends his right hand.

1325
01:45:55,266 --> 01:45:56,518
You gonna counter with the right

1326
01:45:56,601 --> 01:45:58,228
and crack him with the left.
You got that?

1327
01:45:58,311 --> 01:45:59,729
Extend the right,
crack him with the left.

1328
01:45:59,812 --> 01:46:03,107
He'll never expect it.
His old man did the same thing to me.

1329
01:46:03,399 --> 01:46:05,068
One early observation, Max.

1330
01:46:05,151 --> 01:46:07,946
I think Creed is withstanding
Drago's combinations

1331
01:46:08,029 --> 01:46:10,073
much better tonight
than in the first fight.

1332
01:46:10,156 --> 01:46:11,157
Box.

1333
01:46:11,407 --> 01:46:13,076
And round two begins.

1334
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:16,371
Drago with a huge left hook.

1335
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:20,291
And a big right hand.

1336
01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:23,628
Drago on the attack again,
now driving Creed back into the ropes.

1337
01:46:23,795 --> 01:46:26,089
He's overextending the right!
Watch the right!

1338
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:30,218
A right and a left for Creed.

1339
01:46:42,605 --> 01:46:45,316
Huge uppercut
has Creed holding on now.

1340
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:47,527
Drago throws him off into the corner.

1341
01:46:51,823 --> 01:46:53,491
- Get out of that corner!
- Get out of the corner!

1342
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:58,496
And Drago throws Creed
to the canvas.

1343
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:03,084
What's going on?

1344
01:47:03,293 --> 01:47:06,963
Shades of the first fight,
but Drago showing restraint this time.

1345
01:47:07,046 --> 01:47:08,047
You good?

1346
01:47:08,131 --> 01:47:09,132
Yes, I'm good.

1347
01:47:11,718 --> 01:47:14,137
- Box.
- Drago explodes from the break.

1348
01:47:14,846 --> 01:47:16,097
And Creed is down!

1349
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:18,016
A flurry of heavy shots!

1350
01:47:18,308 --> 01:47:21,394
Drago's power is just incredible.

1351
01:47:22,854 --> 01:47:24,063
Three.

1352
01:47:24,606 --> 01:47:25,648
Four.

1353
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:28,318
Take the eight count.
Take the full eight.

1354
01:47:28,401 --> 01:47:29,736
Creed taking his time
on the canvas.

1355
01:47:29,819 --> 01:47:30,820
Six.

1356
01:47:31,029 --> 01:47:32,405
Stay down! Breathe!

1357
01:47:32,488 --> 01:47:35,241
He's listening to Rocky,
who has been in this situation before.

1358
01:47:35,325 --> 01:47:36,367
Eight.

1359
01:47:36,451 --> 01:47:38,411
And Creed is back on his feet.
Beats the count.

1360
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:39,537
- Ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

1361
01:47:39,621 --> 01:47:40,663
Box.

1362
01:47:40,747 --> 01:47:42,665
Tie him up. Don't fight him. Tie him up.

1363
01:47:42,749 --> 01:47:44,959
Drago is right back at it.

1364
01:47:47,795 --> 01:47:50,506
So, with the knockdown
and those hard shots at the end,

1365
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:53,426
that round clearly goes to Viktor Drago.

1366
01:47:53,509 --> 01:47:55,970
And you could just feel
he's gaining momentum.

1367
01:47:56,054 --> 01:47:57,639
You knew this was gonna be a war, right?

1368
01:47:57,722 --> 01:47:59,098
You knew that going in there.

1369
01:47:59,182 --> 01:48:01,351
From now on, it's who wants it more,

1370
01:48:01,434 --> 01:48:02,935
and who's got more heart.

1371
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,733
Don't let him crack you. You stay
on the outside, you're gonna get hurt.

1372
01:48:08,816 --> 01:48:10,818
You stay on the inside,
you'll tear him up.

1373
01:48:10,902 --> 01:48:12,195
I'm telling you,
it's all about pressure.

1374
01:48:12,278 --> 01:48:15,531
If you wanna give pain,
you gotta be willing to take the pain.

1375
01:48:25,667 --> 01:48:27,001
Come on!

1376
01:48:31,547 --> 01:48:32,632
- Yes!
- Yes!

1377
01:48:37,387 --> 01:48:39,972
Round four
is another brutal display

1378
01:48:40,056 --> 01:48:42,809
as Creed takes a lot of punishment
from Drago.

1379
01:48:44,936 --> 01:48:47,021
Drago is not slowing down.

1380
01:48:47,105 --> 01:48:49,565
Landing a big shot after the bell.

1381
01:48:51,025 --> 01:48:52,151
What is your problem?

1382
01:48:52,235 --> 01:48:53,361
Yo!

1383
01:48:55,363 --> 01:48:58,157
The violent chess match
continues, Jim.

1384
01:48:59,117 --> 01:49:01,035
Oh, and Creed is down again.

1385
01:49:01,703 --> 01:49:02,787
Donnie, get up.

1386
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:07,125
Drago clearly dominating
this fight, but Creed will not give up.

1387
01:49:07,208 --> 01:49:08,835
He is taking a lot of punishment.

1388
01:49:08,918 --> 01:49:10,336
You gotta stay in his face.
Look at me.

1389
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:12,422
You gotta stay in his face.

1390
01:49:12,505 --> 01:49:15,174
And when you see an opportunity,
you go after it.

1391
01:49:19,512 --> 01:49:20,638
There you are!

1392
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:25,351
Drago is cut now.

1393
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:31,482
As we enter round eight,

1394
01:49:31,566 --> 01:49:34,777
we are deeper into this fight
than anyone expected.

1395
01:49:34,861 --> 01:49:37,989
Creed must sense he's behind.
He's trying to force the action.

1396
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:42,034
Yes, baby!

1397
01:49:50,835 --> 01:49:53,880
What we are seeing tonight
is Adonis Creed

1398
01:49:53,963 --> 01:49:57,133
standing up to the awesome power
of Viktor Drago.

1399
01:49:57,216 --> 01:49:58,885
He's not going anywhere.

1400
01:50:08,519 --> 01:50:10,313
Viktor Drago looks tired, Max.

1401
01:50:10,396 --> 01:50:14,025
Keep in mind, he's never had to go past
the 4th round in a professional fight.

1402
01:50:17,570 --> 01:50:19,739
- Hey! What was that?
- Take the point, ref!

1403
01:50:19,822 --> 01:50:21,282
And Drago drops Creed

1404
01:50:21,365 --> 01:50:22,867
- with two nasty body shots.
- Come on!

1405
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:24,952
- He held him and hit him.
- One.

1406
01:50:25,453 --> 01:50:28,414
Viktor holding and maybe
getting away with something there.

1407
01:50:28,498 --> 01:50:30,249
The ref must not have seen it.

1408
01:50:32,335 --> 01:50:33,377
Come on.

1409
01:50:33,461 --> 01:50:36,255
I think Rocky Balboa
has a decision to make here, Jim.

1410
01:50:36,339 --> 01:50:37,965
He knows better than anyone

1411
01:50:38,049 --> 01:50:41,636
how this same story played out
three decades ago.

1412
01:50:41,719 --> 01:50:43,095
Donnie, Donnie, talk to me.

1413
01:50:43,179 --> 01:50:44,180
Donnie.

1414
01:50:44,555 --> 01:50:45,807
Your ribs?

1415
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:47,266
You think it's broke?

1416
01:50:57,527 --> 01:50:58,778
What do you wanna do, Donnie?

1417
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:01,739
You wanna call it?

1418
01:51:06,744 --> 01:51:07,954
I didn't think so.

1419
01:51:13,251 --> 01:51:14,669
Now he's gonna come after you,

1420
01:51:14,752 --> 01:51:16,671
and he's gonna try to break
on that rib some more.

1421
01:51:17,255 --> 01:51:18,381
But that's okay.

1422
01:51:18,714 --> 01:51:20,299
'Cause you like the pain.
You can take it.

1423
01:51:20,383 --> 01:51:22,635
You know why? Because you're dangerous.

1424
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:25,263
- I'm dangerous.
- That's right.

1425
01:51:25,721 --> 01:51:27,098
Ten seconds out.

1426
01:51:44,448 --> 01:51:46,534
Now here we go with round ten

1427
01:51:46,617 --> 01:51:48,828
of what has become a war of attrition.

1428
01:51:49,078 --> 01:51:53,291
Drago seemingly ahead on the scorecards,
but Creed refusing to back down.

1429
01:51:53,374 --> 01:51:54,834
That's it, Donnie. Good.

1430
01:51:55,376 --> 01:51:57,920
Creed using whatever he has
left in the tank.

1431
01:51:58,296 --> 01:52:00,006
Drago working the body.

1432
01:52:00,089 --> 01:52:01,215
Tie him up!

1433
01:52:06,596 --> 01:52:08,347
And down goes Creed again.

1434
01:52:08,556 --> 01:52:11,017
And this could be the end of the fight.

1435
01:52:40,838 --> 01:52:42,131
Get up, D.

1436
01:52:54,477 --> 01:52:57,563
No man should be able to
fight through that beating,

1437
01:52:57,647 --> 01:52:59,398
but Adonis Creed
wills himself off the canvas.

1438
01:52:59,482 --> 01:53:00,942
- What's your name?
- Creed.

1439
01:53:01,233 --> 01:53:02,485
What's your name?

1440
01:53:03,069 --> 01:53:04,236
Creed!

1441
01:53:07,865 --> 01:53:08,866
Box!

1442
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:12,912
Adonis Creed knows
there is no way around Viktor Drago.

1443
01:53:12,995 --> 01:53:14,622
He has to go through him.

1444
01:53:16,415 --> 01:53:17,541
Dig!

1445
01:53:18,584 --> 01:53:19,877
Dig! Dig!

1446
01:53:19,961 --> 01:53:21,337
Creed suddenly finding
another gear!

1447
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:22,421
Come on!

1448
01:53:23,798 --> 01:53:25,174
Drago's on his heels.

1449
01:53:30,554 --> 01:53:32,431
And down goes Drago!

1450
01:53:34,809 --> 01:53:36,477
That's it! That's right!

1451
01:53:37,937 --> 01:53:39,480
What a wild turn of events.

1452
01:53:42,775 --> 01:53:43,859
Two.

1453
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:46,487
Donnie, he gets up, you go after him.

1454
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:47,655
Three.

1455
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:50,324
Four.

1456
01:53:52,368 --> 01:53:53,536
Five.

1457
01:53:55,538 --> 01:53:57,623
- Six.
- Drago beats the count.

1458
01:53:57,707 --> 01:54:01,585
I can't believe either of
these guys are still on their feet.

1459
01:54:06,757 --> 01:54:07,967
Box.

1460
01:54:12,638 --> 01:54:16,559
Drago seemingly so far ahead
on points, he just needs to stay upright

1461
01:54:16,642 --> 01:54:18,185
and make it to the end.

1462
01:54:18,686 --> 01:54:22,148
Here comes Creed again,
driving Drago back into the ropes.

1463
01:54:22,231 --> 01:54:23,733
- Dig! Dig! Dig!
- Yeah!

1464
01:54:26,694 --> 01:54:27,987
Come on, take him down!

1465
01:54:29,530 --> 01:54:30,614
Come on, baby.

1466
01:54:34,702 --> 01:54:36,579
And Viktor Drago is down!

1467
01:54:36,662 --> 01:54:37,830
Again!

1468
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:40,708
What a turn this fight has taken.

1469
01:54:51,385 --> 01:54:53,804
Creed doubled over in pain

1470
01:54:53,888 --> 01:54:56,682
as Drago tries to
pick himself up off the floor.

1471
01:55:26,629 --> 01:55:30,341
Drago summons the strength,
manages to make the count.

1472
01:55:44,438 --> 01:55:46,190
They're still swinging, Max.

1473
01:55:46,899 --> 01:55:48,901
Creed continuing to connect.

1474
01:55:48,984 --> 01:55:51,529
And this is becoming hard to watch, Jim.

1475
01:55:51,779 --> 01:55:53,989
I don't think Drago has anything left,

1476
01:55:54,073 --> 01:55:56,325
but he refuses to give up.

1477
01:56:20,599 --> 01:56:22,434
And that's it! It's over!

1478
01:56:23,602 --> 01:56:25,980
Drago's corner
throws in the towel.

1479
01:56:26,063 --> 01:56:29,483
And Adonis Creed
defends his title.

1480
01:56:29,567 --> 01:56:31,235
Defends his name.

1481
01:56:31,318 --> 01:56:33,487
Creates his own legacy.

1482
01:56:33,571 --> 01:56:37,616
He is still the heavyweight champion
of the world.

1483
01:56:39,201 --> 01:56:44,248
And the Russian crowd is standing
and cheering for the American fighter.

1484
01:56:59,346 --> 01:57:01,182
Where's B at? Where's B?

1485
01:57:01,265 --> 01:57:03,225
Easy, easy, easy.

1486
01:57:03,309 --> 01:57:06,187
Hey, back up. Everybody back up.
We need air.

1487
01:57:06,979 --> 01:57:08,147
Yeah.

1488
01:57:11,609 --> 01:57:13,235
- We did it.
- We did it.

1489
01:57:37,384 --> 01:57:39,053
- Let's go home.
- Let's go, D.

1490
01:57:46,101 --> 01:57:48,145
I'm good, Ma. I'm good.

1491
01:57:55,611 --> 01:57:58,072
- I did it. I did it.
- You did it.

1492
01:57:58,239 --> 01:57:59,573
Hey, Unc.

1493
01:58:12,836 --> 01:58:14,588
It's your time.

1494
01:58:32,648 --> 01:58:34,817
Hey, okay, back up.

1495
01:59:13,772 --> 01:59:15,107
What's up, Pops?

1496
01:59:20,612 --> 01:59:23,115
I'm sorry it took me so long
to come see you.

1497
01:59:28,537 --> 01:59:31,040
I'm not sure how
this is supposed to go. Um...

1498
01:59:34,710 --> 01:59:37,296
I guess I should tell you that
Mom's doing pretty good.

1499
01:59:37,921 --> 01:59:40,257
You know, she's holding up.

1500
01:59:42,551 --> 01:59:43,719
So is Rocky.

1501
01:59:44,845 --> 01:59:46,013
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

1502
01:59:46,096 --> 01:59:47,348
<i>He's a tough dude.</i>

1503
01:59:49,350 --> 01:59:51,310
<i>I can see why you liked him.</i>

1504
01:59:54,021 --> 01:59:56,482
I also see why
you wanted to fight him, too.

1505
02:00:05,949 --> 02:00:07,326
Look, um,

1506
02:00:09,536 --> 02:00:11,663
I just came here to tell you that...

1507
02:00:18,253 --> 02:00:19,755
That I did it.

1508
02:00:23,592 --> 02:00:25,636
But I didn't do it for you.

1509
02:00:29,181 --> 02:00:30,724
<i>Or because of them.</i>

1510
02:00:33,018 --> 02:00:36,188
<i>I did it because it was my fight.</i>

1511
02:00:38,482 --> 02:00:40,150
<i>And when I stepped into that ring,</i>

1512
02:00:43,195 --> 02:00:44,822
it wasn't just about me.

1513
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:49,159
Hello.

1514
02:00:51,787 --> 02:00:53,038
You must be Logan.

1515
02:00:53,330 --> 02:00:54,581
Yes. Who are you?

1516
02:00:54,873 --> 02:00:56,166
Lo, who is it?

1517
02:00:57,126 --> 02:01:00,045
<i>Sometimes we think
we have to do it all on our own.</i>

1518
02:01:00,671 --> 02:01:01,922
Hey, Robert.

1519
02:01:03,298 --> 02:01:04,508
<i>But we don't.</i>

1520
02:01:06,135 --> 02:01:09,012
I was just around
in the neighborhood, so...

1521
02:01:15,352 --> 02:01:17,020
This is your grandfather.

1522
02:01:28,699 --> 02:01:31,785
You look just like his mother.

1523
02:01:34,204 --> 02:01:35,539
Yeah, I know.

1524
02:01:42,796 --> 02:01:44,923
I wanna introduce you to somebody.

1525
02:01:55,809 --> 02:01:57,352
Do you wanna come inside?

1526
02:02:05,027 --> 02:02:06,195
Yeah.

1527
02:02:06,487 --> 02:02:07,779
Give me that.

1528
02:02:18,248 --> 02:02:20,626
- Is that a ball?
- Yeah.

1529
02:02:21,793 --> 02:02:23,587
- Wanna play catch?
- Yes.

1530
02:02:24,963 --> 02:02:26,256
There you go.

1531
02:02:27,257 --> 02:02:28,342
This

1532
02:02:30,177 --> 02:02:32,971
is your granddaughter. Amara.

1533
02:02:33,722 --> 02:02:35,516
Say what's up to Pop-Pop.
