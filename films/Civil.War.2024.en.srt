1
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:44,227
We are now
closer than we've ever been.

2
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:49,298
We are now closer than
we have ever been to victory.

3
00:00:50,535 --> 00:00:52,332
Some...

4
00:00:52,434 --> 00:00:57,135
Some are already
calling it the greatest...

5
00:00:57,938 --> 00:01:02,174
Some are already
calling it the greatest victory

6
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:06,777
in the history
of mankind.

7
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,754
Some are calling it already...

8
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:23,232
We are closer than
we have ever been to victory.

9
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,233
Some are already calling it
the greatest victory

10
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:29,206
in the history
of military campaigns.

11
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:37,144
Today, I can announce

12
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:39,914
that the so-called
Western Forces

13
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,082
of Texas and California

14
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,588
have suffered
a great loss.

15
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,651
A very great defeat

16
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:49,221
<i>at the hands
of the fighting men and women</i>

17
00:01:49,324 --> 00:01:50,854
<i>of the United States military.</i>

18
00:01:52,295 --> 00:01:54,527
<i>The people
of Texas and California</i>

19
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:57,129
<i>should know that they will be
welcomed back</i>

20
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:58,897
<i>to these United States</i>

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,668
<i>as soon as their illegal
secessionist government is deposed.</i>

22
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,008
<i>I can also confirm
that the Florida alliance</i>

23
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,639
<i>has failed in its attempt</i>

24
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:11,815
<i>to force the brave people
of the Carolinas</i>

25
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:13,613
<i>into joining the insurrection.</i>

26
00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:16,517
<i>Citizens of America,</i>

27
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:21,125
<i>we are now closer than ever
to a historic victory.</i>

28
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:24,721
<i>As we eliminate
the final pockets of resistance,</i>

29
00:02:24,824 --> 00:02:28,727
<i>God bless you all
and God Bless America.</i>

30
00:03:50,712 --> 00:03:54,549
Give us some water!
Give us some water!

31
00:03:57,122 --> 00:03:58,920
We've been waiting
for two hours.

32
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:09,126
We want water!

33
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:10,631
My baby!

34
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,940
Lee.

35
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,192
No!

36
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:04,784
You all right?

37
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,426
Help!

38
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:20,965
Here, here.

39
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:23,638
You okay?

40
00:05:24,402 --> 00:05:26,073
I'm fine.

41
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:27,175
- What?
- What?

42
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:28,577
You're Lee Smith?

43
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:32,413
This is crazy.

44
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:34,852
- Take this.
- Oh, no, I can't do that.

45
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:37,019
Take it and put it on.

46
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:39,984
Thank you so much.

47
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,019
Run!

48
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:04,371
You woke up
in Des Moines, Iowa.

49
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:06,339
And he's wearing
my wedding ring.

50
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:08,545
Hey!

51
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,086
Jesus. The wifi
is fucking slow.

52
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:18,954
The word I'm getting,

53
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:20,089
it's July 4th.

54
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,791
The word you're getting.

55
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:24,487
Like everyone in this room
hasn't already heard his bullshit.

56
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:26,426
July 4th, Sam.

57
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:29,159
The optics
are irresistible.

58
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:31,962
The Western Forces
are stopped 120 miles from D.C.

59
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:34,304
The Florida Alliance
aren't far south of that.

60
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:36,799
The WF wasn't stopped.
They stalled.

61
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:38,735
They lost
their supply lines.

62
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:40,170
What is the race to Berlin?

63
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:43,340
There's no coordination
between the secessionists.

64
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:44,878
You watch.

65
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,485
As soon as D.C. falls,
they'll turn on each other.

66
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:51,621
Really?

67
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:53,667
It's every night
this week.

68
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:55,751
- Ugh.
- They'll switch to the generator.

69
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:57,726
Upload was almost done.

70
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:05,096
So where you kids
headed tomorrow?

71
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,540
Staying in New York a while
or venturing out?

72
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,106
Fuck you.

73
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,676
- Come on, Joe.
- So you can beat us there?

74
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:19,176
I couldn't beat you
in a brisk walk.

75
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:25,017
We're going to
D.C., Sammy.

76
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:27,751
Tomorrow morning,
first thing.

77
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:29,291
Yeah, front line, I figured.

78
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:31,221
No, no,
not the frontline.

79
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,026
D.C.

80
00:08:42,006 --> 00:08:43,006
What?

81
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:44,938
I'm gonna photograph
the president.

82
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:48,510
Joe's gonna
interview.

83
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:51,012
Photograph
and interview the president?

84
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,583
In D.C.?

85
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,048
That's the idea.

86
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,623
What the fuck are you talking about?
Are you serious?

87
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:03,691
They shoot journalists
on the side in the capital.

88
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,824
They literally see us
as enemy combatants.

89
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:09,259
Not a single interview
in 14 months.

90
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:11,599
And how are you
gonna do this?

91
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:14,836
We get there
before anyone else does.

92
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:16,867
You think there's a rush

93
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:19,539
to get executed
on the soft lawn?

94
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,772
Sam, July 4th,
July 10th.

95
00:09:21,874 --> 00:09:24,414
Westcoast Forces,
fuckin'

96
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:27,146
Heartland Maoists,
it's all the same.

97
00:09:27,248 --> 00:09:30,885
D.C. is falling and the President
is dead inside the...

98
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:34,556
Interviewing him
is the only story left.

99
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,155
It's not a story
if it never gets filed.

100
00:09:39,357 --> 00:09:41,764
Lee, can I please
talk you out of this bullshit?

101
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:46,136
What do you think
the route's gonna be like?

102
00:09:46,238 --> 00:09:47,631
There's nothing direct.

103
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:50,773
The interstates have vaporized.
And you can't get anywhere near Philly.

104
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,838
So you gotta go west,
maybe as far as Pittsburgh.

105
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,273
Then circle in
from West Virginia.

106
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,749
You already had that route
all figured out, huh, Sammy?

107
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,385
Yeah, okay, I was kind of
looking to get down there myself.

108
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:07,755
- Knew it.
- Not D.C.

109
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,525
I don't want a piece
of your suicide pact.

110
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:12,856
I want Charlottsville, frontline.

111
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,464
- Sam.
- Hear me out.

112
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,773
Just 'cause
I'm a rival news outlet...

113
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:17,327
You're not
a fucking rival.

114
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:19,532
You think I care if you
fight with whatever's left

115
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:20,803
of <i>The New York Times?</i>

116
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:25,742
You're worried
I'm too old.

117
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,942
Can't move quick enough.

118
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:31,110
Aren't you?

119
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:33,509
Sure.

120
00:10:33,611 --> 00:10:34,883
Yes.

121
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:36,819
But...

122
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:43,723
You're gonna make me
explain why I have to be there?

123
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:47,426
If it's the frontline you want, half the press
in this room are gonna be heading there

124
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:48,999
within 24 hours.

125
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:52,395
You want me to walk around
this flipping room begging for a ride?

126
00:10:55,434 --> 00:11:00,171
I'm gonna finish the upload upstairs
and pass out.

127
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:02,913
Hopefully it'll be time
by the time I wake up.

128
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:07,986
My vote,

129
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:11,320
if Sammy wants a ride,
I'm good with it.

130
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:13,189
You two figure it out.

131
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,291
Thank you, Lee.

132
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:16,459
Yeah, thank you, Lee.

133
00:11:17,262 --> 00:11:18,262
Make me the bad guy.

134
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:22,360
Ma'am, just a warning.

135
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:24,930
If you take the elevator,
we do sometimes have power cuts

136
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:26,770
which might mean
a delay in your journey.

137
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:28,505
A delay?

138
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:30,202
We offer the option
to use the stairs.

139
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,072
I'm on the tenth floor.

140
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,812
Your choice, ma'am.

141
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:43,721
Miss Smith?

142
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:46,889
Hey, it's me.

143
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:49,656
Do you
remember me from earlier?

144
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,088
Yeah. How did you know
I was...

145
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:55,126
I didn't mean
to, like, stalk, but, um,

146
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:57,093
I know a lot of the press
use this hotel.

147
00:11:57,195 --> 00:12:00,800
And, um, I wanted
to say thanks.

148
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:03,439
And I want
to give you this back.

149
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:05,670
Oh, no.
It's okay, keep it.

150
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:06,772
- But...
- Keep it.

151
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,245
And buy
a helmet.

152
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:09,605
And some Kevlar, okay,

153
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:11,776
if you're planning
on attending more stuff like that.

154
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:13,280
I am, yeah, going to.

155
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:16,820
I'm a photographer and I wanna be
a war photographer actually.

156
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:21,355
By the way, you have
the same name as my hero.

157
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:22,724
Lee Miller.

158
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,622
She was one of the first
photo journalists

159
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:25,922
into Dacau.

160
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:27,024
Do you know her stuff?

161
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:29,395
Yeah, I know
who Lee Miller is.

162
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,498
Of course.

163
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:35,197
But I want to say that
you're also one of my heroes.

164
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:38,842
And you've got
the same name too.

165
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:40,477
Wow.

166
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:42,780
Thank you.
I'm in good company.

167
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:47,312
- What's your name?
- Jessie.

168
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,183
Jessie Collin.

169
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:53,252
So, Jessie, I've gotta walk up
ten flights of stairs.

170
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:56,925
But, if I ever see you again,

171
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,830
you better be wearing Kevlar
and not fluorescent.

172
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:02,899
You bet.

173
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:14,661
A word.

174
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,101
What the fuck
is that girl doing here?

175
00:15:19,203 --> 00:15:22,070
Right. So, she came over
to the table last night

176
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,271
after you went to bed
and we got talking and...

177
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:26,839
She's very cool.

178
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:28,143
And wanted to tag along.

179
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,877
So she's coming with us?

180
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,813
Lee, you let Sammy
tag along.

181
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:37,413
You think he's gonna do well running for cover
with bullets flying over his head?

182
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:39,453
She's a kid,
did you notice that?

183
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:41,223
She's, like, 23,

184
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:44,489
and she wants to do what we do.
She wants to do what you do.

185
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:47,723
We had to start one day.

186
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:50,528
Were you much older
than she is now?

187
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:02,738
Whatever happens,
she goes no further than Charlottesville.

188
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:12,748
All right. Let's go.

189
00:16:50,322 --> 00:16:51,787
You don't want to miss this.

190
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:14,074
Mr. President, do you regret
any actions implemented

191
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,374
during your third term
in office?

192
00:18:16,476 --> 00:18:18,710
I'm not gonna
softball him, Sammy.

193
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:22,145
In retrospect, Mr. President,
do you still think it was wise

194
00:18:22,247 --> 00:18:23,718
to disband the FBI?

195
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,381
Passive aggressive.

196
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:30,089
Sir, how is your policy evolving in the use
of air strikes against American citizens?

197
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:31,620
Now we're talking.

198
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:33,358
Just be sure
you get the words out

199
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,627
before the piano wire
gets too tight.

200
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,698
There's a gas station
up ahead.

201
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:43,866
Looks open.

202
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,543
We got
over half a tank.

203
00:18:58,184 --> 00:18:59,717
What do you think?

204
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:05,427
Any chance to refuel,
we should take.

205
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:06,790
Okay.

206
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:35,824
Help you, folks?

207
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,491
Just looking for gas.

208
00:19:40,227 --> 00:19:42,595
Y'all look fuel permit.

209
00:19:42,697 --> 00:19:45,763
No, we're...
We're actually just passing through.

210
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:48,832
Can't help, sir.

211
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:52,271
Sir, if we pay.

212
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:54,544
I was never gonna
give it free.

213
00:19:54,646 --> 00:19:55,745
Over the odds.

214
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:56,942
What's over the odds?

215
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:58,574
Three-hundred.

216
00:19:58,676 --> 00:20:00,549
For half a tank
and two cans.

217
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:04,486
Three hundred buys you
a sandwich.

218
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,455
We got ham or cheese.

219
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,622
Three hundred Canadian.

220
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:14,796
Okay.

221
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:23,399
Hey.

222
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:24,536
Stretching your legs?

223
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:27,074
Uh, no, I just saw something
from the road.

224
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:28,542
This isn't going
to take long.

225
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,412
Sure.

226
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:47,962
Are we good?

227
00:20:49,493 --> 00:20:50,663
Yeah, we're good.

228
00:22:04,968 --> 00:22:08,510
I told her,
I don't mind if she looks.

229
00:22:11,477 --> 00:22:13,614
- Who are they?
- Looters.

230
00:22:14,248 --> 00:22:15,484
I just met him.

231
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:18,652
I used to know that guy.

232
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:21,985
Went to high school together.

233
00:22:23,962 --> 00:22:24,988
He didn't talk too much.

234
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:28,662
Much more talkative now.

235
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:34,536
We've been debating what to do
with them for two days now.

236
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,500
We go around in circles.

237
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,477
Tell you what.

238
00:22:43,877 --> 00:22:46,012
Why don't you put us
and them out of our misery

239
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,711
and make a call?

240
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:49,419
I'll put rounds
in them right now.

241
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,983
Or beat 'em up
a little more.

242
00:22:54,993 --> 00:22:56,754
Strap them to the front.

243
00:22:56,856 --> 00:22:58,494
We'll let them go
after a couple of days.

244
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:07,899
Flip the coin if you like.

245
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,135
Would you stand with them?

246
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:15,144
- Stand with them?
- Yeah.

247
00:23:19,612 --> 00:23:21,077
I'd like to take your picture.

248
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:31,553
Okay.

249
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:32,825
Stand over there?

250
00:23:33,457 --> 00:23:34,796
Yeah.

251
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,631
Where do you want me?

252
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:40,030
Uh, between the two.

253
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,604
Got you.

254
00:23:47,738 --> 00:23:49,204
I didn't take a photo.

255
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,212
I didn't take a single photo.

256
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:53,547
I didn't even remember

257
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:56,418
a camera's on me.
Like, oh, my God, like,

258
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,815
why didn't I
just tell him not to shoot them?

259
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:00,366
They're probably
gonna kill them anyway.

260
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,256
- How do you know?
- He doesn't know,

261
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,759
but that's besides the point.

262
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:08,226
Once you start asking yourself
those questions, you can't stop.

263
00:24:08,328 --> 00:24:09,429
So we don't ask.

264
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,828
We record,
so other people ask.

265
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,102
Wanna be a journalist?
That's the job.

266
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:15,970
- Hey, Lee.
- What?

267
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:17,271
Back off.

268
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:18,837
What am I saying
that's wrong?

269
00:24:18,939 --> 00:24:21,408
I'm not saying it's wrong,
she's just shook up.

270
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,478
Lee doesn't understand
shook up.

271
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,744
Whoa, huh?
I'm not being protective of her?

272
00:24:26,846 --> 00:24:29,717
You're the idiot
who let her in this car.

273
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:33,551
What happened back there
is nothing in comparison

274
00:24:33,653 --> 00:24:35,024
to what we're heading into.

275
00:24:35,126 --> 00:24:36,724
You need to understand...

276
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,958
Shit, she's crying.

277
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,127
The back seat
is both kindergarten

278
00:24:44,795 --> 00:24:46,602
and an old people's home.

279
00:24:47,203 --> 00:24:48,399
How did this happen?

280
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:50,499
Lee, what the fuck?

281
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:52,003
Lee's right.

282
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:57,976
I won't make
that mistake again.

283
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:10,218
<i>...on the so-called peace summit
could only be rejected,</i>

284
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,761
<i>duly rejected by all
free thinking Americans.</i>

285
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,898
<i>To the secessionists,
I say only this.</i>

286
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:25,135
<i>I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America.</i>

287
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:31,312
<i>We stand ready to fulfill
the promise of our forefathers,</i>

288
00:25:31,414 --> 00:25:34,210
<i>to the flag, to the nation,</i>

289
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,279
<i>and to God.</i>

290
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:43,056
Stop here a minute.

291
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:46,159
This feel like a good place
for a toilet break?

292
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:47,322
Just pull in.

293
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,646
Come with me.

294
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:09,283
Come with me.

295
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,187
Shoot it.

296
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:50,253
- Shoot the helicopter?
- Yeah.

297
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:52,827
It's gonna make
a good image.

298
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:23,359
FE2s.

299
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:25,191
You don't see them
around much.

300
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:26,758
Yeah.

301
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,324
They're my dad's
cameras actually.

302
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:32,132
No worries,
not dead.

303
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,500
He's...

304
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:34,999
sitting on his farm in Missouri

305
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:36,970
pretending like none of this
is happening.

306
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,289
Lee,

307
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:59,495
I'm sorry for jamming my way
into your ride, okay?

308
00:27:59,597 --> 00:28:01,058
I know
you're really angry about it,

309
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:03,663
and I know you think
I don't know shit, but...

310
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,095
I'm not angry
about that, Jesse.

311
00:28:06,197 --> 00:28:08,800
I don't care what you do,
or don't know.

312
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:11,367
Okay, but you are
angry with me.

313
00:28:11,469 --> 00:28:15,305
There is no version of this
that isn't a mistake.

314
00:28:16,347 --> 00:28:18,275
I know, because I'm it.

315
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:20,409
Joe and Sammy
are it.

316
00:28:21,682 --> 00:28:23,181
- It's my choice.
- Right.

317
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,118
Then I'll remember that

318
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,891
when you lose your shit,
or you get blown up or shot.

319
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,326
Would you photograph
that moment if I get shot?

320
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:40,033
What do you think?

321
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:57,316
Every time I survived
a war zone,

322
00:28:57,618 --> 00:28:59,118
and got the photo,

323
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:02,253
I thought I was sending
a warning home.

324
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:04,893
"Don't do this."

325
00:29:06,362 --> 00:29:07,489
But here we are.

326
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:12,065
So it's existential.

327
00:29:13,368 --> 00:29:14,698
What is?

328
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,201
What's eating you.

329
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:22,207
Don't worry about me, Sammy.

330
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:28,543
Am I allowed to say
I remember you at her age?

331
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:31,980
And I wasn't so different?

332
00:29:32,082 --> 00:29:33,720
You weren't so different.

333
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:35,065
You think
you're being hard on her,

334
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:37,321
and I think
you're being hard on yourself.

335
00:29:38,222 --> 00:29:40,557
- Okay, Rider.
- Damn it, Lee.

336
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:42,029
Stop.

337
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,899
I'm speaking truth.

338
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:46,761
And for the record, sure,
I'm worried about that girl.

339
00:29:47,264 --> 00:29:49,300
And I'm worried
about you too.

340
00:29:51,434 --> 00:29:53,172
What are you worrying
about Lee for?

341
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:58,276
Lee's lost her faith
in the power of journalism.

342
00:29:58,978 --> 00:30:01,517
State of the nation is QED.

343
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:03,978
I can't answer
to that, Sammy.

344
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,514
But I can tell you,

345
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,316
this gunfire,

346
00:30:08,418 --> 00:30:11,190
is getting me
extremely fucking hard.

347
00:30:12,993 --> 00:30:15,331
Look at that shit
light up the sky.

348
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:16,591
It's not our story.

349
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:18,731
Yeah.

350
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:21,935
But you know,
bang bang.

351
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:24,335
We're not going anywhere
near that in the dark.

352
00:30:24,968 --> 00:30:26,172
But sunup?

353
00:30:27,944 --> 00:30:30,143
If they're still at it,
we'll take a look.

354
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:37,920
Cool.

355
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:46,126
Thanks.

356
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:17,993
Action tomorrow.

357
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:21,498
We're going down there?

358
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:23,130
Yeah.

359
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:28,102
But not you.

360
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:29,933
You're gonna...

361
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:31,369
You're gonna hang back.

362
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:34,542
I don't wanna hang back.

363
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:35,644
You have to hang back.

364
00:31:37,174 --> 00:31:39,377
I'm not hanging back.

365
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,085
You should see your face.

366
00:31:45,788 --> 00:31:47,990
Stomach doing turns. Right.

367
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,324
You don't get
a minute of sleep tonight.

368
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,689
My advice,

369
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:57,258
don't expect to sleep.

370
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,567
That way if you do, it's a...

371
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,003
It's a nice surprise.

372
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:06,635
You're gonna sleep?

373
00:32:10,174 --> 00:32:12,014
I got a little bit Ativan.

374
00:32:15,348 --> 00:32:17,151
Got plenty.
I can give you some if you like.

375
00:32:17,983 --> 00:32:19,852
I know, it's okay.

376
00:32:19,954 --> 00:32:22,486
Or, I can stay up with you.

377
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:24,994
Keep you company.

378
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:28,657
No, I...

379
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:33,134
I don't wanna be
a burden or whatever.

380
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:38,238
You sure?

381
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:43,342
But seriously,

382
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:47,379
if you do get freaked out
or something, just wake me up.

383
00:32:48,512 --> 00:32:50,349
It's not nice
being scared alone.

384
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:55,651
Thanks, Joe.

385
00:32:57,186 --> 00:32:58,390
You bet, doll.

386
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:07,091
No!

387
00:34:07,193 --> 00:34:08,493
I said surround the building!

388
00:34:08,927 --> 00:34:10,495
No! Fuck!

389
00:34:13,065 --> 00:34:14,702
Come on!

390
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,206
Get me the fuck
out of here!

391
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,070
I said don't slice
the fucking building!

392
00:34:23,172 --> 00:34:24,446
Got it.

393
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:28,084
Dude, jump in!

394
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:30,417
Get ready to move.

395
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,759
- Get the smoke.
- I gotta get the fuck out of here!

396
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:37,555
- Fuck!
- Slow down!

397
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:44,633
Count of three.
Three, two, one.

398
00:34:44,735 --> 00:34:45,827
Count of three!

399
00:34:58,111 --> 00:35:00,380
Fuck!
Fuck!

400
00:35:01,114 --> 00:35:02,282
You all right?

401
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:03,829
- I'm gonna get him!
- Forget him.

402
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:05,081
- Yeah!
- Yeah, move it!

403
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:06,518
You gotta move!

404
00:35:15,558 --> 00:35:17,430
You gotta get it right now!

405
00:35:23,135 --> 00:35:24,569
Move back!

406
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,274
Move back!

407
00:35:35,184 --> 00:35:37,417
Got you. Hang in.
Stay over there.

408
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,587
Fuck! Give me gauze.

409
00:37:58,696 --> 00:37:59,955
I need help.

410
00:39:51,668 --> 00:39:55,140
Holy fucking shit!

411
00:39:55,242 --> 00:39:56,775
What a fucking rush!

412
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:27,201
- You're press?
- Yes, ma'am.

413
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,170
IDs.

414
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:37,017
Okay. Are you guys
staying the night?

415
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,179
Yeah, just one.

416
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:41,916
Park over there.

417
00:40:42,018 --> 00:40:43,651
There's a canteen
where you can eat.

418
00:40:43,753 --> 00:40:45,486
And no tents available.

419
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:46,825
Thanks, ma'am.

420
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:13,120
You look good.

421
00:41:13,222 --> 00:41:15,518
Eight, nine, ten.

422
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,621
Hey, get in there.

423
00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:17,730
I'm gonna show these kids...

424
00:41:17,754 --> 00:41:19,955
Check this out. Okay!

425
00:41:20,058 --> 00:41:23,026
- Left, right.
- Here you go.

426
00:41:23,593 --> 00:41:24,995
Yeah.

427
00:41:25,728 --> 00:41:27,129
Your turn, son.

428
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,901
Hey, wait up.

429
00:41:51,228 --> 00:41:52,422
Brought you something.

430
00:41:52,524 --> 00:41:53,793
Thanks.

431
00:41:57,695 --> 00:41:58,826
Don't forget to eat.

432
00:41:58,928 --> 00:42:00,129
Yeah, I'm starving.

433
00:42:03,966 --> 00:42:05,838
I'll eat once I handle this.

434
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:09,510
Developing negs on the road.

435
00:42:09,612 --> 00:42:11,811
Yeah, I got myself
a pretty neat travel kit.

436
00:42:12,675 --> 00:42:14,475
I'm impressed.

437
00:42:14,577 --> 00:42:17,214
Want to know the secret
of getting the developer just right?

438
00:42:17,316 --> 00:42:18,316
Hmm.

439
00:42:21,157 --> 00:42:22,486
Body temperature.

440
00:42:22,588 --> 00:42:24,120
- Smart.
- Thank you.

441
00:42:29,198 --> 00:42:34,229
So how about you tell me the story of
how you became a photo journalist?

442
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:37,372
You don't know?

443
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:38,838
I thought I was
one of your heroes.

444
00:42:41,011 --> 00:42:43,612
Yeah, I do.

445
00:42:43,714 --> 00:42:46,811
When you were in college,
you took the motherfucking

446
00:42:46,913 --> 00:42:49,585
legendary photo
of the Antifa massacre.

447
00:42:51,118 --> 00:42:55,151
Then you became
the youngest ever magnum photographer.

448
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,754
That would be
my Wikipedia page.

449
00:42:59,856 --> 00:43:01,124
What's missing
from it?

450
00:43:01,824 --> 00:43:04,094
I don't know. A lot.

451
00:43:07,098 --> 00:43:08,931
Well, that's gotta
sit here for ten minutes.

452
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:11,002
So you might as well
expand a little.

453
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:13,807
What about your folks?

454
00:43:14,907 --> 00:43:17,739
Well, actually
they're on a farm too.

455
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:19,876
- Oh?
- Except, Colorado.

456
00:43:19,978 --> 00:43:22,816
Also pretending
this isn't happening.

457
00:43:23,613 --> 00:43:24,785
No shit.

458
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:30,285
Hey, these are dry.

459
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:32,322
You should check them out.

460
00:43:32,424 --> 00:43:34,058
Sure.

461
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,324
Still need a phone even though
you can't get a signal.

462
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,569
I don't want you
to see these.

463
00:43:48,671 --> 00:43:50,039
Um...

464
00:43:50,142 --> 00:43:52,811
They're not even in focus.
Like...

465
00:43:52,914 --> 00:43:55,684
- Exposure is all wrong.
- Just keep looking.

466
00:43:56,984 --> 00:44:00,381
Figure the strike rate
for keepers is 30 to one.

467
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:29,014
It's a great photo, Jessie.

468
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:51,222
Did we just
drive through a time portal?

469
00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:53,895
It's a twilight zone.

470
00:47:23,492 --> 00:47:25,525
Hey there. Welcome.

471
00:47:25,627 --> 00:47:27,093
Feel free to look around.

472
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,441
Hey.

473
00:47:44,314 --> 00:47:45,342
Out of interest,

474
00:47:47,013 --> 00:47:48,543
are you guys aware
there's like

475
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:51,781
a pretty huge civil war
going on

476
00:47:51,883 --> 00:47:53,053
all across America.

477
00:47:53,851 --> 00:47:55,049
Oh, sure, but,

478
00:47:55,151 --> 00:47:57,090
we just try to stay out.

479
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:03,328
Stay out?

480
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:06,462
With what we see on the news,
seems like it's for the best.

481
00:48:09,536 --> 00:48:10,564
Yeah.

482
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:12,586
Well, let me know
if you want to try anything on.

483
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:15,042
Thanks.

484
00:48:16,907 --> 00:48:18,441
- Lee.
- Mm.

485
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:23,884
What?

486
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:26,284
You're so war torn,
you can't try on a dress?

487
00:48:43,438 --> 00:48:44,438
Jesus.

488
00:48:45,976 --> 00:48:47,942
When you haven't
seen yourself in the mirror...

489
00:48:48,044 --> 00:48:50,308
- Oh, my God. - in a few days.
- Shut the fuck up.

490
00:48:51,408 --> 00:48:53,245
Turn around.
I want to take your photo.

491
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:56,985
No.

492
00:48:58,453 --> 00:48:59,453
Come on.

493
00:48:59,915 --> 00:49:01,121
Yes.

494
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,132
You're gonna
take the photo?

495
00:49:18,234 --> 00:49:19,766
You told me not to rush.

496
00:49:19,868 --> 00:49:22,907
Yeah, but there's a sweet spot,
and you're missing it.

497
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,441
No one will miss
your sweet spot.

498
00:49:26,509 --> 00:49:28,709
Well, no, that was
not the moment.

499
00:49:31,046 --> 00:49:32,319
Okay.

500
00:49:32,421 --> 00:49:33,516
One more.

501
00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:41,355
- Lee.
- Yes.

502
00:49:41,457 --> 00:49:43,531
You're pretty
when you smile.

503
00:49:45,996 --> 00:49:47,233
There you go.

504
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:49,405
Hey.

505
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,041
How about this?

506
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:55,708
Yeah, nice.

507
00:49:58,011 --> 00:49:59,377
Not gonna
take a picture?

508
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:01,478
Right.

509
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,382
You know what, though,
running a little low on film.

510
00:50:07,116 --> 00:50:08,685
You're mean.

511
00:50:08,787 --> 00:50:10,091
I'm out.

512
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,395
I'm gonna go try this on.

513
00:50:31,815 --> 00:50:33,609
You actually
bought something?

514
00:50:36,815 --> 00:50:38,013
She did.

515
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:39,450
She's paying now.

516
00:50:43,151 --> 00:50:45,058
So weird.

517
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,524
This place is like
everything I'd forgotten.

518
00:50:48,398 --> 00:50:49,527
Funny.

519
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:52,430
I was thinking
it felt like everything I remembered.

520
00:50:54,398 --> 00:50:56,236
Look at the tops
of the buildings.

521
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:57,831
Be subtle.

522
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,223
Wouldn't have suited us
anyway, Lee.

523
00:51:17,122 --> 00:51:18,621
We'd have gotten bored.

524
00:51:20,056 --> 00:51:24,023
<i>I remain ready
to accept the full...</i>

525
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:28,102
<i>and unconditional surrender
of the secessionist forces.</i>

526
00:51:28,204 --> 00:51:32,270
<i>Deliberate the people
of the subjugated states</i>

527
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:34,642
<i>and start rebuilding
our great nation.</i>

528
00:51:34,744 --> 00:51:36,441
Enough of this shit.

529
00:51:37,506 --> 00:51:39,474
Words might as well be random.

530
00:51:39,576 --> 00:51:40,976
What do you think
he'll actually say

531
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:43,076
if I do get a microphone
over to him?

532
00:51:43,178 --> 00:51:44,416
Not much.

533
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:49,254
The ones that get taken,
Qaddafi, Mussolini, Ceausescu.

534
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,926
they're always lesser men
than you think.

535
00:51:52,028 --> 00:51:54,162
At the end,
they let you down, Joe.

536
00:51:54,264 --> 00:51:56,659
Just as long as he isn't dead
before I get there.

537
00:52:08,973 --> 00:52:10,178
Hold up.

538
00:52:39,209 --> 00:52:41,472
There was a turn off
three or four miles back.

539
00:52:41,574 --> 00:52:43,942
Maybe we should turn around,
take another route.

540
00:52:44,044 --> 00:52:45,478
Can you see anything?

541
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,577
No.

542
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:50,845
Nothing, no shapes,
no movement, nothing.

543
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:53,752
No.

544
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:58,292
Okay. I'm gonna drive forward,
I think.

545
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:26,080
Should I keep going?

546
00:53:28,822 --> 00:53:29,888
Shit!

547
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:50,509
Where you going?

548
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:52,141
Sammy.

549
00:53:52,178 --> 00:53:53,809
Don't be
such a hotshot.

550
00:53:55,644 --> 00:53:57,516
Just keep
your head down.

551
00:53:57,983 --> 00:53:58,983
No shit.

552
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,399
You want to try
drivin' on?

553
00:54:13,265 --> 00:54:14,467
This guy's a good shot.

554
00:54:43,962 --> 00:54:44,962
Hey.

555
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,362
What's going on?

556
00:54:47,464 --> 00:54:48,798
Someone in that house,

557
00:54:51,004 --> 00:54:52,004
they're stuck.

558
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:54,474
We're stuck.

559
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,575
Who do you think they are?

560
00:54:57,679 --> 00:54:58,679
Hmm.

561
00:54:59,308 --> 00:55:00,546
No idea.

562
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,683
Hey.

563
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:07,454
We're press.

564
00:55:10,253 --> 00:55:11,425
Cool.

565
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,858
Now I understand why it's written
on the side of your vehicle.

566
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:27,702
Are you WF?
Who's givin' you orders?

567
00:55:27,804 --> 00:55:30,939
No one's giving us
orders, man.

568
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:33,843
Someone's trying to kill us.

569
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:36,483
We're trying to kill them.

570
00:55:38,553 --> 00:55:40,685
You don't know
what side they're fighting for?

571
00:55:41,285 --> 00:55:42,720
Oh, I get it.

572
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:44,925
You're retarded.

573
00:55:46,229 --> 00:55:48,429
You don't understand
a word I say.

574
00:55:51,194 --> 00:55:52,330
Yo!

575
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,028
What's over there
in that house?

576
00:55:58,006 --> 00:55:59,006
Someone shooting.

577
00:56:02,844 --> 00:56:03,844
Guys.

578
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:06,744
Shut the fuck up.

579
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:40,849
I got good news.

580
00:57:17,012 --> 00:57:19,152
Why don't you
put your head down then?

581
00:57:19,254 --> 00:57:22,253
Thank you, Sammy.
I'm good.

582
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,090
Take it from an old hand.

583
00:57:24,192 --> 00:57:26,055
Sleep any chance you get.

584
00:57:26,157 --> 00:57:28,694
You never know
what's coming around the next corner.

585
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,896
Yeah, all right.

586
00:58:16,241 --> 00:58:17,241
Sammy.

587
00:58:17,341 --> 00:58:18,345
What?

588
00:58:18,447 --> 00:58:20,680
Got a car
comin' up on us pretty fast.

589
00:58:25,483 --> 00:58:26,684
What do you think?

590
00:58:26,787 --> 00:58:29,656
I don't know.
Maybe they're just in a hurry.

591
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:37,530
Oh, they're in
a hurry, all right.

592
00:58:37,632 --> 00:58:39,765
He smoked his tires
on the last corner.

593
00:58:41,365 --> 00:58:42,768
Okay.

594
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,711
Well, we're not gonna
outrun anyone in this thing.

595
00:58:44,735 --> 00:58:47,039
So slow down a little, Lee.

596
00:58:47,141 --> 00:58:48,304
Let 'em pass.

597
00:58:48,406 --> 00:58:49,676
Roger that.

598
00:59:03,324 --> 00:59:04,691
Don't look out at 'em.

599
00:59:05,326 --> 00:59:07,023
They just roll on by.

600
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,298
Oh, shit. They keep going.

601
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,778
What the fuck?

602
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:27,615
Tony?

603
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:29,479
- Fuck you!
- What the fuck!

604
00:59:29,581 --> 00:59:31,451
How are you guys doing?

605
00:59:31,553 --> 00:59:33,384
You just scared
the shit out of me.

606
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,554
Good. That was
the idea.

607
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:37,425
What the fuck
are you doing here?

608
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:40,221
I don't know, Joe.
What are you doing here?

609
00:59:41,394 --> 00:59:42,394
Fuck you!

610
00:59:42,459 --> 00:59:43,631
Fuck you!

611
00:59:45,629 --> 00:59:46,830
God, small world.

612
00:59:46,933 --> 00:59:49,264
Small world, my ass.
They were following us.

613
00:59:49,366 --> 00:59:51,806
Did you tell them
where we were headed back in New York?

614
00:59:51,908 --> 00:59:53,204
Fuck no.

615
00:59:53,306 --> 00:59:56,971
Hey, Tony, did Joe tell you
where we were going back in New York?

616
00:59:57,073 --> 00:59:59,340
I don't know, Lee.
He was pretty drunk

617
00:59:59,442 --> 01:00:02,045
when he was hitting on that girl
you got on the back seat.

618
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:04,978
- Oh...
- You're a dick.

619
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,286
Look, I must've been
so wasted.

620
01:00:07,388 --> 01:00:10,150
Lee, I'm done with Bohai.

621
01:00:10,253 --> 01:00:12,759
He's not good company.
He drives like a maniac.

622
01:00:18,399 --> 01:00:19,529
Dude, what are you doing?

623
01:00:19,631 --> 01:00:20,827
I come over to your car.

624
01:00:20,929 --> 01:00:22,362
- Tony!
- Dude.

625
01:00:23,306 --> 01:00:24,964
Are you fucking crazy, Tony?

626
01:00:25,067 --> 01:00:27,039
- Dude...
- Keep the car steady.

627
01:00:27,141 --> 01:00:28,267
No! Fuck!

628
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,341
Don't worry.
I've done this before.

629
01:00:31,443 --> 01:00:32,973
What the fuck!

630
01:00:33,075 --> 01:00:36,050
Keep the car
steady, Lee.

631
01:00:36,152 --> 01:00:37,311
Give me a hand.

632
01:00:40,048 --> 01:00:42,386
Get out of here.
Fucking mad.

633
01:00:42,488 --> 01:00:43,818
You're crazy.

634
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,254
No way. That's so fucking...

635
01:00:47,789 --> 01:00:49,325
I gotta do it.

636
01:00:49,427 --> 01:00:50,427
What?

637
01:00:50,528 --> 01:00:51,528
I'm doing it.

638
01:00:51,628 --> 01:00:52,826
Jesus, Lee.

639
01:00:52,928 --> 01:00:54,064
Don't turn the wheel.

640
01:00:58,036 --> 01:01:01,535
My new passenger.
Much better, much better.

641
01:01:01,638 --> 01:01:02,775
Pull over.

642
01:01:02,877 --> 01:01:04,978
Bye bye, Tony.
Bye bye. See you in Washington.

643
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,241
Fuck you!

644
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:23,929
I told you
he drives like a maniac.

645
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:32,102
Where did they go?

646
01:01:42,712 --> 01:01:44,582
This feel funny?

647
01:01:44,684 --> 01:01:46,314
Where did your guy go, Tony?

648
01:01:47,623 --> 01:01:49,082
He's just fucking around,
that's all.

649
01:01:49,184 --> 01:01:50,688
I don't want him
fuckin' around.

650
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,587
I want Jessie
back in this car.

651
01:01:52,689 --> 01:01:53,692
Relax, Lee.

652
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:55,138
He's just showing
how fast he can drive.

653
01:01:55,162 --> 01:01:57,307
- The girl's fine.
- How the fuck do you know if she's fine?

654
01:01:57,331 --> 01:01:58,331
Can you see her?

655
01:01:58,433 --> 01:01:59,800
Whoa!

656
01:02:04,272 --> 01:02:05,272
Fuck!

657
01:02:16,514 --> 01:02:17,851
Oh, fuck.

658
01:03:00,162 --> 01:03:01,162
Shit.

659
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:36,284
We need to go down there. Now.

660
01:04:36,387 --> 01:04:38,453
If we go down there,
they're going to kill us.

661
01:04:39,194 --> 01:04:40,058
No.

662
01:04:40,059 --> 01:04:41,525
Those aren't government forces.

663
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:42,660
Not up here.

664
01:04:42,762 --> 01:04:43,791
We got our press passes.

665
01:04:43,893 --> 01:04:45,230
We're cool.

666
01:04:45,332 --> 01:04:48,529
Those people do not want to be
seen doing what they're doing.

667
01:04:50,735 --> 01:04:52,072
Tell us, Lee.

668
01:04:54,035 --> 01:04:55,170
They're talking.

669
01:04:55,272 --> 01:04:56,943
They're probably
just giving them a scare.

670
01:04:57,045 --> 01:04:58,965
They killed all the people
in that fucking truck.

671
01:04:59,012 --> 01:05:00,118
They could've killed
the whole town,

672
01:05:00,142 --> 01:05:01,143
but they will stop now?

673
01:05:01,245 --> 01:05:02,725
Who knows
where those bodies are from?

674
01:05:03,717 --> 01:05:05,249
Are the bodies in uniform?

675
01:05:05,915 --> 01:05:07,086
No, they're not.

676
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:10,590
I'm going down.

677
01:05:10,693 --> 01:05:12,056
- I'm coming with you.
- Me too.

678
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,253
I'm telling you
every instinct in me says

679
01:05:14,355 --> 01:05:16,261
this is death, okay? Death.

680
01:05:16,363 --> 01:05:20,000
You stay. You stay 'cause you're old
and you can't run.

681
01:05:20,863 --> 01:05:22,268
Fuck it.

682
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:23,434
Shit.

683
01:05:23,537 --> 01:05:24,664
Fuck this.

684
01:05:28,973 --> 01:05:30,377
Just doing the talking.

685
01:05:30,479 --> 01:05:32,045
- Yeah.
- Okay.

686
01:05:45,456 --> 01:05:47,390
White,
there's one hung up in there.

687
01:05:52,896 --> 01:05:54,100
Hey!

688
01:05:54,766 --> 01:05:56,003
Hey, guys.

689
01:06:01,103 --> 01:06:02,306
What's happening?

690
01:06:07,214 --> 01:06:10,317
Guess there's some kind
of misunderstanding here.

691
01:06:10,419 --> 01:06:11,484
Yeah?

692
01:06:11,586 --> 01:06:12,586
Yes, sir.

693
01:06:13,248 --> 01:06:14,752
Those two guys over there,

694
01:06:14,854 --> 01:06:16,122
they're my colleagues.

695
01:06:22,994 --> 01:06:24,427
What kind of colleagues?

696
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:27,065
Journalists, sir.

697
01:06:27,168 --> 01:06:29,069
We're actually just...
We're passing through.

698
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:31,999
Passing through to where?

699
01:06:32,101 --> 01:06:33,374
Charlottsville.

700
01:06:33,476 --> 01:06:34,536
Charlottsville?

701
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,146
What's in Charlottsville?

702
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:42,582
Good hiking.

703
01:06:43,077 --> 01:06:44,249
I hear.

704
01:06:48,854 --> 01:06:50,155
Actually we are...

705
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:53,060
No, we're covering
the university campus there.

706
01:06:53,795 --> 01:06:55,222
They started the new program.

707
01:06:55,325 --> 01:06:56,763
They are re-opening the school,

708
01:06:56,865 --> 01:07:00,333
which is a surreal
feel good story.

709
01:07:00,435 --> 01:07:01,361
Mm-hmm.

710
01:07:01,363 --> 01:07:03,963
And I guess we all need that.

711
01:07:04,065 --> 01:07:05,369
Right?

712
01:07:13,349 --> 01:07:14,576
Yeah.

713
01:07:18,281 --> 01:07:19,682
This guy
is your colleague?

714
01:07:19,784 --> 01:07:20,886
Yeah.

715
01:07:20,988 --> 01:07:22,355
- This guy here?
- Yes, he's my...

716
01:07:24,118 --> 01:07:25,653
That guy?

717
01:07:38,032 --> 01:07:39,538
Sir.

718
01:07:41,674 --> 01:07:42,674
Just...

719
01:07:43,611 --> 01:07:44,611
Just what?

720
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:46,878
- Just what?
- You know what?

721
01:07:46,981 --> 01:07:48,415
- This... Just, please.
- What?

722
01:07:48,517 --> 01:07:49,749
Just, please.

723
01:07:49,852 --> 01:07:50,860
- Sir, please.
- Please. Sure.

724
01:07:50,884 --> 01:07:52,180
- Yes, speak.
- Let us...

725
01:07:52,282 --> 01:07:53,752
We're American journalists.

726
01:07:53,854 --> 01:07:55,081
You told me that already.

727
01:07:55,183 --> 01:07:56,453
Okay, we...

728
01:07:57,384 --> 01:07:59,122
We work for Reuters.

729
01:07:59,224 --> 01:08:00,760
Reuters doesn't
sound American.

730
01:08:00,862 --> 01:08:02,992
It's a news agency.

731
01:08:03,094 --> 01:08:04,094
I know
what Reuters is.

732
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:05,229
Sir. Okay.

733
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,107
- I'm just saying...
- Just saying, just what?

734
01:08:07,131 --> 01:08:08,531
We're American, okay?

735
01:08:11,506 --> 01:08:12,400
Okay.

736
01:08:12,402 --> 01:08:14,174
What kind of American
are you?

737
01:08:18,606 --> 01:08:20,444
Central American,
South American?

738
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:29,354
What?

739
01:08:31,526 --> 01:08:32,687
Florida.

740
01:08:33,429 --> 01:08:34,429
Florida?

741
01:08:36,157 --> 01:08:37,362
Central?

742
01:08:48,043 --> 01:08:49,605
What about you?
Where are you from?

743
01:08:54,276 --> 01:08:55,446
Tell him, Jessie.

744
01:08:59,048 --> 01:09:00,353
Missouri.

745
01:09:00,588 --> 01:09:01,588
Missouri?

746
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:05,489
The "Show-Me" state, right?

747
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:07,728
Yes.

748
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:09,196
You know what they call it?

749
01:09:09,992 --> 01:09:11,031
Yes.

750
01:09:11,133 --> 01:09:12,693
Why do they call it
the "Show-Me" state?

751
01:09:15,362 --> 01:09:16,533
I don't know.

752
01:09:17,299 --> 01:09:18,469
You don't know?

753
01:09:23,645 --> 01:09:24,706
It's American.

754
01:09:25,474 --> 01:09:27,544
It is American. 100 percent.

755
01:09:32,384 --> 01:09:33,814
What about you?
Where are you from?

756
01:09:35,986 --> 01:09:36,986
Colorado.

757
01:09:37,889 --> 01:09:38,889
Colorado.

758
01:09:41,191 --> 01:09:42,724
Colorado, Missouri.

759
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:47,465
That's what I'm talking about.

760
01:09:48,296 --> 01:09:49,434
It's American.

761
01:09:59,014 --> 01:10:00,577
Who is this guy
hiding over here?

762
01:10:01,342 --> 01:10:02,612
Hey. Buddy.

763
01:10:04,515 --> 01:10:06,352
What's your deal?
Where are you from?

764
01:10:08,886 --> 01:10:10,019
Huh?

765
01:10:10,121 --> 01:10:11,357
Where are you from?

766
01:10:13,694 --> 01:10:14,522
What?

767
01:10:14,524 --> 01:10:15,856
You can't speak?
Are you mute?

768
01:10:19,362 --> 01:10:21,367
You can't speak English?

769
01:10:23,137 --> 01:10:24,733
Yes, you can?
Yes, you can.

770
01:10:26,036 --> 01:10:27,036
Okay.

771
01:10:30,742 --> 01:10:33,476
You open your mouth
and tell me where you're from.

772
01:10:33,578 --> 01:10:35,680
Just make sure
it's clear fucking English.

773
01:10:35,782 --> 01:10:36,782
Okay?

774
01:10:39,249 --> 01:10:40,452
Where are you from?

775
01:10:41,419 --> 01:10:43,455
I'm from... I'm from Hong Kong.

776
01:10:44,726 --> 01:10:45,726
Oh, China?

777
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:48,892
China.

778
01:10:52,198 --> 01:10:53,241
- No!
- What?

779
01:10:53,265 --> 01:10:54,733
- You stop it, okay?
- Stop?

780
01:10:54,835 --> 01:10:55,868
No, no, no!

781
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:57,101
- Who the fuck...
- Stop it!

782
01:10:57,203 --> 01:10:58,332
Who do you think you are...

783
01:11:10,984 --> 01:11:12,786
Get in the car!

784
01:11:12,888 --> 01:11:14,585
Get in the fucking car!

785
01:11:56,029 --> 01:11:57,089
Go, go, go, go!

786
01:11:57,291 --> 01:11:58,497
Go!

787
01:13:00,521 --> 01:13:01,522
We gotta stop.

788
01:13:01,624 --> 01:13:02,960
What are you talking about?

789
01:13:03,062 --> 01:13:04,429
I can't drive.

790
01:13:04,531 --> 01:13:06,174
We can't stop.
You gotta fucking drive.

791
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:07,832
- Joe.
- I can't.

792
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:10,096
He's been hit. He's bleeding.

793
01:13:10,764 --> 01:13:12,771
No, no, no, no, no, no.

794
01:13:12,873 --> 01:13:13,968
Fuck!

795
01:13:16,406 --> 01:13:18,271
Fuck! Okay, get up.

796
01:13:18,373 --> 01:13:19,605
Get up.

797
01:13:19,707 --> 01:13:20,947
Let's go.

798
01:13:21,049 --> 01:13:22,911
Come on. Let's go, Sammy.

799
01:13:25,085 --> 01:13:26,178
- Okay.
- Come on.

800
01:13:44,938 --> 01:13:46,134
Fuck!

801
01:17:51,385 --> 01:17:52,713
We just heard about Sammy.

802
01:17:52,815 --> 01:17:53,815
And the other two guys.

803
01:17:53,849 --> 01:17:56,689
Tony. Bohai. Their names.

804
01:17:56,791 --> 01:17:59,451
Lee, I'm really sorry.
I know what he was to you.

805
01:18:00,228 --> 01:18:01,458
It's so fucked up.

806
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,028
Oh, it's so fucked up.

807
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:05,495
It's so fucked up.

808
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:08,999
Now you wait until you hear what these two
embattled motherfuckers have to say.

809
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,265
Joe, I'm just trying to talk to Lee
about Sammy.

810
01:18:11,367 --> 01:18:14,371
I know. Yeah, I heard.
Your condolences means a lot.

811
01:18:14,473 --> 01:18:17,007
Now just tell her.

812
01:18:18,105 --> 01:18:20,309
We loved Sammy, everyone did.

813
01:18:21,842 --> 01:18:23,110
Thank you, Anya.

814
01:18:23,212 --> 01:18:26,413
Fuck. The Western Forces
are moving to D.C.

815
01:18:26,515 --> 01:18:30,119
Earlier today, the government,
military, basically surrendered.

816
01:18:33,327 --> 01:18:35,322
Yeah, that's true.

817
01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:37,995
This is the only protection now.

818
01:18:38,097 --> 01:18:40,492
Few do or die soldiers,
handful of secret service.

819
01:18:41,369 --> 01:18:42,929
WF's gonna roll right in.

820
01:18:43,031 --> 01:18:45,204
So you and I, we're too late.

821
01:18:45,306 --> 01:18:46,364
We missed the story.

822
01:18:46,466 --> 01:18:50,007
And Sammy didn't even die
for anything good.

823
01:19:29,878 --> 01:19:31,246
Where's Joe?

824
01:19:32,352 --> 01:19:33,512
Processing.

825
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:39,892
Me, too.

826
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:52,267
Hardly knew Sammy
compared to you, but...

827
01:19:52,934 --> 01:19:54,137
Yeah, you knew him.

828
01:19:55,436 --> 01:19:59,010
The man you were with,
that's who he was.

829
01:20:04,584 --> 01:20:06,314
It may sound fucked up,

830
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:09,856
but there are so many ways

831
01:20:10,988 --> 01:20:12,485
that it could've ended for him.

832
01:20:13,825 --> 01:20:15,158
And a lot of them were worse.

833
01:20:17,465 --> 01:20:18,898
He didn't want to quit.

834
01:20:24,999 --> 01:20:26,466
These last few days,

835
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:30,877
I've never been scared
like that before.

836
01:20:32,273 --> 01:20:34,881
And I've never
felt more alive.

837
01:24:06,186 --> 01:24:07,357
Sniper!

838
01:24:10,894 --> 01:24:12,230
Man down!

839
01:24:24,074 --> 01:24:26,779
Move! Move, move, move!

840
01:24:26,881 --> 01:24:29,247
Danger detection!
Move, move, move!

841
01:24:56,605 --> 01:24:59,739
- Come here!
- Move, move, move!

842
01:25:19,631 --> 01:25:20,631
Lee?

843
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:23,833
Let's go!

844
01:26:35,342 --> 01:26:37,540
- Go, go, go!
- Come on. Come on.

845
01:26:38,375 --> 01:26:40,312
Got him,
got him, got him.

846
01:26:42,511 --> 01:26:45,548
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go! Go!

847
01:26:49,651 --> 01:26:52,852
Get to the back!
In position now! Go! Go!

848
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:13,580
Fire!

849
01:27:25,357 --> 01:27:26,853
Come on, stay down.
Stay down.

850
01:27:31,732 --> 01:27:32,925
Walk you down.

851
01:27:35,367 --> 01:27:37,301
We're here to help.
What do you need?

852
01:27:37,404 --> 01:27:39,008
We got two over
and two on the tower.

853
01:27:39,032 --> 01:27:41,336
I bet we can send a round
right through that tower.

854
01:27:41,438 --> 01:27:43,469
Yeah, just fuckin' do it,
do it.

855
01:27:43,572 --> 01:27:45,910
Get back. On me.
Drop that bitch.

856
01:27:48,883 --> 01:27:50,514
Lee, get your head down!

857
01:27:51,281 --> 01:27:53,550
What tower? On whose side?

858
01:28:18,912 --> 01:28:20,379
Move, move, move!

859
01:28:24,147 --> 01:28:26,284
Move, move!

860
01:28:26,386 --> 01:28:29,047
Let's just go,
let's go, let's go!

861
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:38,759
Lee, you gotta move, okay?

862
01:28:38,861 --> 01:28:41,928
You have to move.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!

863
01:28:48,539 --> 01:28:49,969
Get down,
get down, get down.

864
01:28:55,108 --> 01:28:57,781
They'll fall again.
Push it back, push it back.

865
01:28:57,883 --> 01:28:59,510
Get back!

866
01:28:59,612 --> 01:29:00,815
Staying clear!

867
01:29:05,487 --> 01:29:07,190
Move it! Move it!

868
01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:08,894
Fuck, Lee.
Let's move.

869
01:29:08,996 --> 01:29:10,462
Move, move, move.

870
01:29:11,028 --> 01:29:12,028
Move!

871
01:29:18,266 --> 01:29:20,135
Move!

872
01:29:20,237 --> 01:29:21,935
Get over here, now!

873
01:29:23,438 --> 01:29:24,938
Come here!

874
01:29:25,706 --> 01:29:26,907
Let's go!
Go, go, go.

875
01:29:28,316 --> 01:29:29,943
Move, move.
Back here, back here.

876
01:29:36,183 --> 01:29:39,486
Kill on the forehead!
Kill on the forehead!

877
01:29:39,588 --> 01:29:41,488
I don't...
Keep it going.

878
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:42,861
Move it. Let's go. Let's go.

879
01:29:42,963 --> 01:29:44,161
Go, go, go, go, go!

880
01:29:44,263 --> 01:29:46,932
- Go now, fast.
- Go, go, go!

881
01:29:47,034 --> 01:29:49,199
You're ready? On my count.

882
01:29:49,302 --> 01:29:52,570
Oh, my God.
So fucking close.

883
01:29:54,603 --> 01:29:56,607
Come on, let's go.
Again.

884
01:29:56,709 --> 01:29:59,473
Western Forces have reached
the White House perimeter.

885
01:29:59,575 --> 01:30:02,010
The president is now surrounded.

886
01:30:02,113 --> 01:30:03,911
We have...

887
01:30:07,951 --> 01:30:09,991
Just give me a minute.
We're gonna have to go again.

888
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:11,622
You get new shit?

889
01:30:12,993 --> 01:30:14,053
Lincoln Memorial.

890
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:15,854
You?

891
01:30:15,855 --> 01:30:17,659
WF rappelling out of a chopper

892
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,891
out on the roof
of the fucking Pentagon.

893
01:30:19,993 --> 01:30:21,830
There's really
only one shot go, huh?

894
01:30:22,729 --> 01:30:24,198
You know he's in there?

895
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:26,999
They got intel from the generals
that surrendered yesterday.

896
01:30:27,101 --> 01:30:29,838
The president's right
in that fucking building.

897
01:30:30,943 --> 01:30:32,311
Fuck.

898
01:30:32,413 --> 01:30:34,480
What do you hear
they're gonna do with him?

899
01:30:34,848 --> 01:30:36,045
Kill.

900
01:30:36,147 --> 01:30:37,679
No capture.

901
01:30:37,782 --> 01:30:39,749
Whoever gets a fucking gun
to his head first.

902
01:30:41,547 --> 01:30:42,785
Hey, Lee!

903
01:30:44,392 --> 01:30:46,052
Don't be mean
about the money shot, huh?

904
01:30:51,294 --> 01:30:52,296
Got the beast.

905
01:30:52,398 --> 01:30:53,994
Two support men
right outside.

906
01:30:55,432 --> 01:30:56,997
President's on the move.

907
01:30:58,469 --> 01:30:59,970
Fuck yeah.
He's bustin' out.

908
01:31:16,486 --> 01:31:17,952
Vehicle coming through!

909
01:31:33,073 --> 01:31:34,606
Beast, beast, beast!

910
01:31:45,119 --> 01:31:46,119
I'm going to war!

911
01:31:58,598 --> 01:32:00,073
His vehicle
has been stopped...

912
01:32:00,097 --> 01:32:01,097
Go!

913
01:32:01,162 --> 01:32:04,031
...by Western forces
as it attempted to escape.

914
01:32:08,207 --> 01:32:09,641
He's not in there.

915
01:32:13,245 --> 01:32:14,646
He's not in there.

916
01:32:16,279 --> 01:32:17,279
What?

917
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:20,580
Okay.

918
01:32:20,682 --> 01:32:21,948
- Let's go.
- But...

919
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:23,561
- Let's go, Jessie.
- What do you mean? What?

920
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:24,887
Come on! Now!

921
01:32:36,170 --> 01:32:37,532
Follow me. Follow me.

922
01:32:37,634 --> 01:32:39,805
I think POTUS is movin' out.

923
01:32:40,207 --> 01:32:41,673
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

924
01:32:51,248 --> 01:32:52,248
Don't...

925
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:53,778
This place is empty.

926
01:34:04,525 --> 01:34:06,153
Just stay the fuck
out of our way.

927
01:34:43,190 --> 01:34:44,861
Secret Service agent,
Joy Butler.

928
01:34:44,963 --> 01:34:47,898
- Drop it.
- I'm unarmed. I'm here to talk.

929
01:34:48,566 --> 01:34:50,428
- Take it?
- Flood it.

930
01:34:59,605 --> 01:35:01,906
I'm here to negotiate
the surrender of the president.

931
01:35:03,282 --> 01:35:04,445
He's here.

932
01:35:04,547 --> 01:35:05,949
You the WF?

933
01:35:06,649 --> 01:35:08,853
Take a wild guess.

934
01:35:08,955 --> 01:35:11,920
Can the president be entrusted
into your safe care?

935
01:35:12,023 --> 01:35:14,622
Yes, ma'am. We'll take
real good care of him.

936
01:35:14,724 --> 01:35:16,059
Just bring him out here.

937
01:35:16,161 --> 01:35:18,105
We're not bringing him anywhere
until we have agreed terms.

938
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:20,292
You need to guarantee a safe
passage for the president.

939
01:35:20,394 --> 01:35:23,665
And we need extraction
to a neutral territory.

940
01:35:23,768 --> 01:35:25,837
We request Greenland or Alaska.

941
01:35:26,569 --> 01:35:27,733
Nah, no terms.

942
01:35:27,835 --> 01:35:29,374
Bring him out here.

943
01:35:29,476 --> 01:35:30,740
We gotta move, sergeant.

944
01:35:30,842 --> 01:35:32,437
Ma'am, the President
is willing...

945
01:35:33,777 --> 01:35:36,177
Gunter! Poi! Jack!
Move him!

946
01:35:42,982 --> 01:35:44,889
Come on, get back!

947
01:35:51,363 --> 01:35:52,363
Just go. Go!

948
01:36:04,443 --> 01:36:05,443
Out! Reloading!

949
01:36:12,881 --> 01:36:13,881
- Get back!
- Get back!

950
01:36:13,948 --> 01:36:15,384
- Look out!
- I got him!

951
01:36:15,486 --> 01:36:16,849
Give it up!

952
01:36:18,589 --> 01:36:20,023
Ready to crash!

953
01:36:20,753 --> 01:36:21,959
Sir!

954
01:36:25,796 --> 01:36:28,196
I'm out. Reloading, reloading.

955
01:36:33,835 --> 01:36:35,038
Press back.

956
01:36:36,604 --> 01:36:37,669
Sir!

957
01:36:37,771 --> 01:36:38,943
Crash it!

958
01:36:42,512 --> 01:36:44,313
Go! Go!

959
01:36:44,415 --> 01:36:45,477
Move it.

960
01:36:46,913 --> 01:36:48,579
Wait! Wait!

961
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:52,858
Don't move!

962
01:36:58,024 --> 01:36:59,560
Chief, clear way!

963
01:36:59,662 --> 01:37:01,291
Roger that!

964
01:37:01,393 --> 01:37:03,794
Fuck the cross!
Fuck the cross!

965
01:37:03,896 --> 01:37:05,035
Check.

966
01:37:05,469 --> 01:37:06,631
Forward.

967
01:37:06,733 --> 01:37:08,848
Cutter, I'm moving across.
I need you to lead us in fire.

968
01:37:08,872 --> 01:37:10,138
Charger,
you're going left.

969
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:13,078
Follow me. I'm going left.
You move when I move.

970
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:14,174
Copy you!

971
01:37:14,175 --> 01:37:15,777
- Guys ready to move?
- Ready, ten!

972
01:37:15,878 --> 01:37:17,478
Move! Move back!
Move!

973
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:18,580
Let's go!

974
01:37:36,698 --> 01:37:37,936
You good?

975
01:37:39,537 --> 01:37:40,631
Stay down.

976
01:37:47,347 --> 01:37:48,512
Beacon flare!

977
01:37:48,614 --> 01:37:50,212
Move! You gotta move on!

978
01:37:50,747 --> 01:37:51,910
Move, move, go!

979
01:37:52,012 --> 01:37:53,413
- Move it!
- Moving.

980
01:37:55,519 --> 01:37:56,519
Ready.

981
01:37:57,691 --> 01:37:59,221
Break out, break out,
break out.

982
01:38:06,533 --> 01:38:08,600
Shakir! Shakir! Shakir!

983
01:38:08,702 --> 01:38:10,969
- I'm out. Reloading.
- Changing.

984
01:38:12,603 --> 01:38:13,603
Perfect crash!

985
01:40:02,713 --> 01:40:03,774
Wait!

986
01:40:05,385 --> 01:40:06,385
Wait!

987
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:18,228
I need a quote.

988
01:40:19,592 --> 01:40:22,298
Don't let... Don't let them
kill me.

989
01:40:25,638 --> 01:40:28,370
Yeah, that will do.
